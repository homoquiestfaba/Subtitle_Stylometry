1
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:48,282
 LOOK.

2
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:51,419
WE'RE GONNA GO SMOKE.
WANT TO COME?

3
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:53,587
UM, NO, THANKS.

4
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,593

WE'LL BE BACK.

5
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,663
SHE'S PROBABLY
JUST IN THE CAR.

6
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,332
YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE, MIKE,
I SWEAR TO GOD.

7
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:12,700
LISTEN, I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING.

8
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,468
NOTHING HAPPENED.
SHE JUST GOT MAD.

9
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:17,671
- OH, SHE GOT MAD? GOT?
- YEAH, GOT.

10
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:20,350
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING
TO SAY TO HER. YOU'RE APOLOGIZING.

11
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,410
- FINE, WHATEVER.
- YOU GUYS...

12
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,536
 IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT
THERE ARE OTHERS OUT HERE

13
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,805
WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME
KINDS OF EXPERIENCES,

14
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,276
WHO'VE BEEN THROUGH
THE SAME KIND OF FEELINGS.

15
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,845
IT CAN BE VERY HARD
TO RELATE TO PEOPLE

16
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:01,582
ABOUT A SUICIDE
IN THE FAMILY.

17
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,584
SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED

18
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:07,321
TO TALK TO PEOPLE
WHO UNDERSTAND.

19
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:10,591
THERE ARE SOME FEELINGS
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE,

20
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,261
EVEN YOUR
VERY BEST FRIENDS,

21
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:15,663
ARE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO RELATE TO.

22
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,466
WELL,

23
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,868
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A
COUPLE OF NEW PEOPLE HERE TODAY,

24
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:24,572
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A COUPLE
OF THEM COULDN'T QUITE MAKE IT.

25
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,574
SO WE ONLY HAVE ONE...

26
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,310
ONE NEW LINK
IN OUR CHAIN.

27
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,912
WHAT WE USUALLY DO
WHEN WE HAVE A NEW MEMBER

28
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,582
IS A SELF-INTRODUCTORY
TYPE OF THING.

29
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,717
OKAY.

30
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,952
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

31
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,324
UM...

32
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,826
MY NAME IS ANGELA.

33
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,761
HI, ANGELA.

34
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:50,464
Angela:
AND...

35
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:58,439
I GUESS
THE REASON I'M HERE

36
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,441
IS BECAUSE...

37
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,886
HI.

38
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,056
ARE YOU BRIAN?

39
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,325
YEAH.

40
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,503
CONTINUE.

41
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,651
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO
TAKE THE BUS?

42
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,386
WHAT?

43
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,954
OH, NO.

44
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,457
I DO IT SOMETIMES
TO SAVE MONEY ON GAS.

45
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,492
OH.

46
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:57,030
I USED TO ALWAYS HAVE TO
TAKE THE BUS WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

47
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:58,599
I HATED IT.

48
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,434
IT MADE ME REALLY
ANXIOUS, YOU KNOW?

49
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:03,704
I FELT LIKE I WAS
GONNA MISS MY STOP.

50
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,739
I ALWAYS GOT NERVOUS THAT
I WAS GONNA MISS MY STOP.

51
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:08,342
IT'S REALLY STRESSFUL.
BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE

52
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:10,478
IT'S-THE-LEAST-I-CAN-DO
SORT OF THINGS, YOU KNOW...

53
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,680
RIDING THE BUS,
THAT IS.

54
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,418
WHY WERE YOU LATE?

55
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,689
MISSED THE BUS.

56
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,324
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

57
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,995
I JUST WAS, I GUESS.

58
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:36,036
MY NAME IS BRIAN.

59
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,039
I KNEW THAT ALREADY.

60
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,875
OH, YEAH.

61
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,412
YOU'RE ANGELA.

62
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:46,580
I KNEW THAT ALREADY ALSO.

63
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,690
WHO WAS IT?

64
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:01,695
MY DAD.

65
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,698
YOU?

66
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,967
MY MOM.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,603
I'M SORRY.

68
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,511
WELL, GOOD LUCK
ON THE BUS, ANGELA.

69
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:18,912
DON'T GET LOST, OKAY?

70
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,648
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

71
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,651
I GUESS I'll SEE YOU NEXT TIME?

72
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,853
I'M PROBABLY NOT GOING
BACK AGAIN IF I CAN HELP IT.

73
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,489
YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO
EITHER.

74
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,623
REALLY?

75
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:31,825
NO.

76
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,494
- WELL...
- I MEAN, I GUESS.

77
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,171
I DON'T KNOW, I HAVEN'T
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

78
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,698
WELL, DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
OUR SORROWS ELSEWHERE THEN?

79
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,066
LIKE WHERE?
LIKE ONLINE?

80
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,135
NO, DEFINITELY
NOT ONLINE.

81
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,438
WELL, NOT LIKE A DATE,
RIGHT?

82
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,974
JUST OUT.
ARE YOU SEEING SOMEONE?

83
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,876
NO. ARE YOU?

84
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,747
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE
ASKING YOU IF I WERE, RIGHT?

85
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:24,512
- HEY, BRENT.
- MORNING, ANGELA.

86
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,814
HOW'S THE SECURITY
BUSINESS?

87
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:36,557
SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

88
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,772
THANKS FOR HELPING US OUT, IAN.
THAT'S REALLY GREAT OF YOU.

89
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,645
ANGELA, HI.

90
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:01,715
HI, MR. LOPES. I DIDN'T KNOW IF
YOU HAD CLASS OR SOMETHING.

91
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,250
NO, I'M JUST HERE
FOR YOU.

92
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,586
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS SO SPECIAL.

93
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,588
NO, I MEAN

94
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,923
I SCHEDULED THIS
MEETING WITH YOU

95
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,059
BECAUSE I NEED
TO KNOW

96
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,895
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU.

97
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,297
I KNOW.
I'M TRYING TO GET...

98
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,532
DO YOU WORK?

99
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:20,934
NO, I DON'T.

100
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,739
JUST TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU, ANGELA,

101
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,675
YOU'RE NOT GONNA PASS
THIS CLASS

102
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,043
THE WAY
THINGS ARE GOING.

103
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:32,045
IT'S NOT THE QUALITY
OF YOUR WORK.

104
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,582
YOU'RE NOT TOO STUPID
FOR THIS CLASS.

105
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,850
IT'S JUST THAT

106
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,752
YOU DON'T
TURN ANYTHING IN.

107
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,990
AT THE SAME TIME,
I CAN'T CUT YOU ANY SLACK

108
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,958
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
GIVEN ME A REASON

109
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,628
TO CUT YOU ANY SLACK,
YOU KNOW?

110
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,631
I... I DON'T KNOW.

111
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,133
I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT'S JUST...

112
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,039
MY GOD.

113
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,108
UM...

114
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:05,679
MY MOTHER DIED
REALLY RECENTLY.

115
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,815
UM...

116
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,917
SHE WASN'T OLD
OR ANYTHING.

117
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,919
SHE...

118
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:14,888
KILLED HERSELF.

119
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:21,194
AND, YOU KNOW, MY DAD'S,
LIKE, NOT IN MY LIFE.

120
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:25,298
WE'RE SORT OF
NOT ON SPEAKING TERMS.

121
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,303
I'M SORRY.

122
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,805
IT'S OKAY.

123
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,107
I CAN SYMPATHIZE.

124
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,744
I LOST MY DAUGHTER BETH
RECENTLY.

125
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,712
SHE HAD TONSILLITIS,

126
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:41,014
YOU KNOW, WHICH USUALLY
ISN'T VERY SERIOUS,

127
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:46,086
BUT THINGS JUST KIND OF...
THEY WENT WRONG.

128
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,989
AND SHE... SHE LEFT US.

129
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,625
AND SHE WAS NINE...

130
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,194
NINE YEARS OLD.
IT WAS REALLY HARD.

131
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,929
I'M SO SORRY.

132
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:59,132
SO I CAN UNDERS...
I UNDERSTAND.

133
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,969
I UNDERSTAND HOW IT CAN BE
REALLY REALLY HARD.

134
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,106
WELL...

135
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,276
I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME

136
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,779
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU, OKAY?

137
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,114
I GUESS I CAN CUT YOU
A LITTLE SLACK NOW.

138
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,787
COME HERE.

139
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,200
- BAD?
- NO, IT'S ANNOYING.

140
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,335
- WHAT DID YOU GET?
- B-MINUS,

141
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,204
WHICH IS SO STUPID.
I HATE THAT GUY.

142
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,807
IF I HAD TO FIND
A NEW ROOMMATE,

143
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,942
I WOULD NEVER PUT UP
ONE OF THESE ADS.

144
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,978
THEY'RE SO WEIRD.
AREN'T THEY WEIRD, ANGE?

145
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,348
UM, I WOULD NEVER
ANSWER ONE.

146
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,751
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE WEIRD.

147
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,062
WELL, THE REASON WHY YOU WOULDN'T
ANSWER ONE IS 'CAUSE THEY'RE SO WEIRD.

148
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,755
I GUESS.

149
00:10:56,356 --> 00:11:00,794
PEOPLE PUT SOME
CRAZY STUFF UP HERE.

150
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,068
OH MY GOD.

151
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,003
WHAT?

152
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,271
YOUR MESSAGE.

153
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,273
I THOUGHT YOU
ALREADY GOT THAT.

154
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,975
NO.

155
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,711
I KNOW.
IT'S SO SAD.

156
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:20,781
GOD, WHEN DID
THIS HAPPEN?

157
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,817
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO
AT THE BEACH.

158
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,726
IT'S HARD TO TELL WITH
KATHERINE, THOUGH, YOU KNOW?

159
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,048
HEY.

160
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,117
HOW WAS WORK?

161
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,822
HOW WAS WORK?

162
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,157
FUCKING AMAZING.

163
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,493
HOW WAS SITTING ALONE
IN THE APARTMENT?

164
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,461
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW
WHAT I DID TODAY?

165
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,932
I BOUGHT CIGARETTES
AND WENT TO THE BANK.

166
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,768
DID YOU ROB THE BANK?

167
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,770
NO.

168
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,106
PITY.

169
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,843
I'M GONNA GO CHANGE.

170
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,146
YOU GOT SOMETHING TODAY.

171
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,129
THERE'S NO ADDRESS ON IT.

172
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,242
SOMEONE MUST HAVE, LIKE,
DROPPED IT OFF OR SOMETHING.

173
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,676
I JUST HEARD.

174
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,281
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

175
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,984
SHE WOULD DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

176
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,256
OH, HONEY,

177
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,259
WHAT IS IT?

178
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,694
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME,
YOU KNOW...

179
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,231
THERE'S STATISTICS...

180
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:07,134
EVERYWHERE.

181
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,668
I KNOW.

182
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,239
MORE PEOPLE KILL THEMSELVES
THAN EACH OTHER.

183
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:16,276
THERE'S MORE SUICIDES
THAN HOMICIDES.

184
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,679
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS, ANGELA?

185
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:24,651
YOU CAN'T BE ALONE.

186
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:28,288
YOU'RE SAFER LIVING
WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER

187
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,723
THAN WITH YOURSELF.

188
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,128
YOU CAN'T RUN
FROM YOURSELF, THOUGH.

189
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,632
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT.

190
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,814
ANGELA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

191
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,550
I'M SORRY, GARRETT...
I MEAN, MR. LOPES.

192
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,420
I CAN'T REALLY STAY, BUT I
JUST WANTED TO STOP BY.

193
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,489
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

194
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:06,159
I JUST... I DON'T THINK I'M
GONNA BE ABLE TO GET MY...

195
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,495
I MEAN, MAYBE,
BUT I DON'T THINK

196
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,497
THAT I'M GONNA BE
ABLE TO GET

197
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,499
YOUR INTRO PARAGRAPH
IN ON TIME.

198
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,436
THINGS ARE HAPPENING.

199
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,505
WELL, THANK YOU FOR
LETTING ME KNOW, ANGELA.

200
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,308
SURE, YEAH.
I MEAN, I'll JUST TRY

201
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,419
AND EMAIL IT TO YOU WHEN I
GET A CHANCE OR SOMETHING...

202
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,312
SOON, I MEAN.

203
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,314
JUST GET IT TO ME
WHEN YOU CAN.

204
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,150
THANKS.

205
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:39,392
I NEVER KNOW IF WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
WAIT FOR THE CHECK OR GO UP TO THE FRONT.

206
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,761
I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

207
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:45,132
OH, WELL, YEAH. BUT I MEAN
AT PLACES LIKE THIS, I GUESS.

208
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,334
I DON'T KNOW.

209
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,671
CHECK, PLEASE.

210
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,641
WHAT?

211
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,376
YOU GO ON LOTS OF DATES,
DON'T YOU?

212
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,744
YOU DON'T?

213
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,380
WELL, NO.

214
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,818
LET'S JUST SAY

215
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,288
FOR THE SAKE OF,
I DON'T KNOW...

216
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,722
SAY THAT...

217
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,358
OKAY, LET'S SAY...

218
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,860
THAT YOU WERE
ON A DATE RIGHT NOW.

219
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,628
- RIGHT THIS MOMENT?
- RIGHT THIS MOMENT.

220
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,830
- WITH YOU?
- WITH ME

221
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,899
OR ANYONE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

222
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,601
OKAY.

223
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,503
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
RIGHT NOW?

224
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,272
WELL, HMM.

225
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,775
I WOULD PROBABLY TRY
TO GET TO KNOW YOU

226
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,143
OR HER,

227
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:34,814
SO I MIGHT ASK,
I DON'T KNOW...

228
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,716
- WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE...?
- CHINESE.

229
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,385
I THOUGHT
IT WASN'T YOU.

230
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:39,852
WHAT'S YOURS?

231
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,688
ITALIAN.

232
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,256
WELL, THEY HAD PASTA.

233
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,424
I DON'T LIKE PASTA.

234
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,526
BUT YOUR FAVORITE
FOOD'S ITALIAN?

235
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,496
THAT'S WEIRD.

236
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:54,267
NO, THAT'S AN INTERESTING
FACT ABOUT ME...

237
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,337
A FACT THAT MIGHT
MAKE YOU THINK

238
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,540
THAT I AM A UNIQUE
AND INTERESTING PERSON.

239
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:04,644
AND YOU ARE
THE ONLY PERSON HERE

240
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,646
THAT KNOWS THAT ABOUT ME
AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

241
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,749
AND THAT IS WHAT'S GONNA
MAKE YOU LIKE ME.

242
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:14,354
OKAY, YOUR TURN.

243
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,622
OKAY.

244
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,958
UM, LET'S SEE...

245
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,561
OH, MY MOM AND I
USED TO SEND

246
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,330
MESSAGES IN A BOTTLE,
LIKE, ALL THE TIME.

247
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,598
WHAT WERE THE MESSAGES?

248
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,934
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T REMEMBER.

249
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,536
I WISH I DID.

250
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,571
DID YOU PUT YOUR
CONTACT INFORMATION ON THEM?

251
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:32,905
SHUT UP.

252
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,907
YOU'RE MAKING FUN
OF MY INTERESTING FACT.

253
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:37,510
DO YOU STILL DO IT...
I MEAN, SEND A MESSAGE?

254
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:41,514
NO, AFTER MY MOM DIED
I JUST GOT SO MAD AT HER

255
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,783
THAT I NEVER WENT BACK
TO THE BEACH.

256
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,519
IT'S LIKE IT CHEATED ME
OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

257
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,888
MAYBE IF YOU
FORGAVE HER...

258
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,523
I DON'T WANT TO.

259
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,326
YOU SHOULD.
IT'S BETTER.

260
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,566
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?
CAN I ASK THAT?

261
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,769
SHE SLIT HER THROAT.

262
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,871
OH MY GOD. WOW.

263
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,440
YEAH, I KNOW.

264
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,876
IN THE KITCHEN.
I FOUND HER.

265
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,245
I'M SORRY.

266
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,847
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?

267
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,518
HE PUT HIS HEAD
IN THE OVEN.

268
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,287
I DIDN'T THINK
PEOPLE REALLY DID THAT.

269
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,589
ME NEITHER.

270
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:24,591
DID SHE LEAVE A NOTE?

271
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,759
NO.

272
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,895
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE,
YOU KNOW.

273
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,830
DOCTORS ARE SUPPOSED
TO HELP PEOPLE.

274
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,300
MY DAD WAS A DOCTOR

275
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,302
AT HUNTER GENERAL.

276
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:38,571
SAME WITH MY MOM.
MAYBE THEY KNEW EACH OTHER.

277
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,308
- THERE MUST BE SOMETHING OFF, YOU KNOW?
- WHAT?

278
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,676
THEY DID IT AT THE SAME TIME,
BOTH DOCTORS.

279
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,977
I DON'T KNOW.

280
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,013
IT'S THE HOSPITAL.

281
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,983
THAT PLACE MUST HAVE
DONE SOMETHING TO THEM.

282
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,753
- MAYBE IF WE WENT...
- NO NO.

283
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,323
YEAH, LET'S GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
MAYBE WE CAN FIND SOMETHING OUT.

284
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,924
I CAN'T GO THERE.

285
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:01,428
I CAN'T GO TO THE PLACES
WHERE SHE'S BEEN.

286
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,530
I CAN'T TOUCH THE THINGS
THAT SHE'S TOUCHED.

287
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,632
I CAN'T.

288
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,541
IF I TELL YOU
SOMETHING,

289
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,743
DO YOU PROMISE
NOT TO TELL ANYONE?

290
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,311
WHO WOULD I TELL?

291
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,412
SERIOUSLY.

292
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:20,780
OF COURSE.

293
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,782
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL.

294
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,517
IT'S JUST...

295
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:25,785
WHAT?

296
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,754
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

297
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,322
WELL, YOU SHOULD
TELL ME.

298
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:31,324
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
GONNA TELL YOU

299
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:33,460
BECAUSE IF I TOLD YOU
THEN I'M MAKING IT A BIG DEAL.

300
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,595
AND IF I DON'T TELL YOU
IT'S LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

301
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,063
SO JUST FORGET IT.

302
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,966
YOU SHOULD TELL ME.

303
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,734
NO.

304
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:45,538
FINE. DON'T.

305
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,911
YOU CAN'T DO THAT,
YOU KNOW.

306
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,446
WHAT?

307
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,548
SAY SOMETHING PROVOCATIVE
AND THEN NOT TELL ME.

308
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:56,983
PROVOCATIVE?

309
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,018
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

310
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,890
WHAT IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING?
THEN WILL YOU TELL ME?

311
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,459
I GUESS SO.

312
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,661
WHAT?

313
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,865
I GOT...

314
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,768
I GOT THIS TAPE.

315
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,938
OF YOUR DAD?

316
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:21,708
- YEAH.
- ME TOO, OF MY MOM.

317
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:24,043
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I DON'T KNOW,

318
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,978
BUT WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
VIDEOTAPE OUR PARENTS?

319
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,614
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
DO THAT?

320
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:29,516
I DON'T KNOW.

321
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,719
ANGELA, I THINK...

322
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,754
I THINK MAYBE
MY DAD DIDN'T...

323
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,990
LIKE, MAYBE
SOMEBODY ELSE DID.

324
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,859
WHAT?

325
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,994
COME ON, LIKE
SOMEBODY KILLED HIM?

326
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,030
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE TO ME ANY OTHER WAY.

327
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:47,667
I GUESS I'M JUST
CONFUSED, YOU KNOW?

328
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,603
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE...

329
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:53,039
MAYBE SOMEBODY'S
TRYING TO HELP US.

330
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,744
LISTEN, WE'RE GONNA BE
FINE, OKAY?

331
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:59,979
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

332
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:04,684
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I JUST SAID THAT.

333
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:09,456
I'M NOT REALLY USED TO
THIS SORT OF THING.

334
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,691
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

335
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,760
THANKS.

336
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:28,508
I SHOULD GO.

337
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,649
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO.

338
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,158
I GET OFF WORK AT 7:00.
I'll COME OVER.

339
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:48,027
YEAH, OKAY.

340
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:52,799
LOCK THE DOOR, OKAY?

341
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,535
- SHUT UP.
- I'll SEE YOU TOMORROW.

342
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:57,537
OKAY, BYE.

343
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:36,008
Brent: YOU KNOW. ARE YOU HAPPY?

344
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,510

SURE.

345
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:40,913
"I'M OUT BOWLING
WITH THE BUDDIES, BABY."

346
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,915
WHEN DID YOU PLAN
ON TELLING ME ALL THIS?

347
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,917
SHUT UP, LISA.
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU

348
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,753
EVERY FUCKING THING
THAT I DO.

349
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,588
YOU KNOW, YOU BORE ME!

350
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:49,822
YOU KNOW WHAT?

351
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:53,893
WHY DON'T YOU GET OFF
YOUR FUCKING HIGH HORSE?

352
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,662
IT'S JUST
A FUCKING HOBBY.

353
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,530
SURE, LIKE IT'S
SO HARD TO BELIEVE

354
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:01,167
THAT I MIGHT WANT TO KNOW WHAT
MY HUSBAND DOES IN HIS SPARE TIME.

355
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,035
ARE YOU HAPPY?

356
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:04,937
YOU'RE DOING THIS
TO MY LIFE.

357
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,939
SHUT UP, LISA.
YOU SHUT UP.

358
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:09,576
YOU FUCKING SHUT
YOUR HOLE. SHUT UP.

359
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:43,109
I JUST DON'T FEEL
SAFE HERE BY MYSELF.

360
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:46,946
BABE, I KNOW.
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

361
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:48,948
YOU KNOW WHAT?

362
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:52,318
EVERYTHING IS
GONNA BE FINE, OKAY?

363
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,520
I'll STAY HERE
UNTIL BRIAN GETS HOME.

364
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:58,891
AND WE'LL JUST WATCH A MOVIE
AND PAINT OUR NAILS.

365
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:02,128
AND I'll MAKE DINNER, OKAY?

366
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:04,630
AND YOU'LL NEVER EVER EVER
HAVE TO BE ALONE AGAIN, OKAY?

367
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:07,666
MY WIFE AND I WANT TO GET
BACK THERE AS SOON AS WE CAN.

368
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,037
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
CITY YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

369
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,238
IS IT?

370
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,040
IT'S JUST GORGEOUS.

371
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:17,243
ARE YOU BACK IN SCHOOL
NOW, BRIAN?

372
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:18,377
EXCUSE ME?

373
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,113
- ARE YOU IN SCHOOL?
- NO.

374
00:31:21,147 --> 00:31:24,350
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I JUST REALLY
HAVEN'T BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT

375
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,285
TOO MUCH RECENTLY,
YOU KNOW?

376
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,520
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

377
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,990
I WANT TO DRIVE A TAXI.

378
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,959
YEAH?

379
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,393
A TAXI?

380
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,362
I KNOW A GUY
WHO DRIVES A TAXI.

381
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,165
I CAN GIVE YOU
HIS NUMBER.

382
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,404
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE
REALLY GREAT.

383
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,939
DEFINITELY GIVE ME
HIS NUMBER.

384
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:49,141
YOU GOT IT.

385
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:03,222
YOU LEFT YOUR PHONE
HERE YESTERDAY.

386
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,024
DO YOU HAVE IT NOW?

387
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:07,393
YEAH, IT'S ON THE TABLE.

388
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,428
WHERE WAS IT?

389
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:12,398
IN THE KITCHEN.

390
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,666
OH, YEAH.

391
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,269
I REMEMBER LEAVING IT
ON THE COUNTER.

392
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:19,681
THAT IS, LIKE, THE THIRD TIME
I'VE HAD TO REPLACE THIS THING.

393
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,440
THANKS FOR FINDING IT.

394
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,675
NO PROBLEM.

395
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,258
ALL RIGHT,
I'M TAKING OFF.

396
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,194
OH. YOU GOT
A HOT DATE?

397
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:44,130
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

398
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:47,533
I HAVE TO CATCH THE BUS.

399
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,702
I'll SEE YOU TOMORROW, OKAY?

400
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:32,951
ARE YOU SURE?

401
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,721
BRIAN IS GONNA BE HERE
IN, LIKE, A MINUTE. I'll BE FINE.

402
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:36,855
REALLY?

403
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,056
YES, REALLY.

404
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,560
BRIT, YOU'VE BEEN
REALLY GREAT.

405
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,862
OH...

406
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:47,433
OH, AND I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS.

407
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,335
PLEASE DON'T STAY
YOU'RE SORRY.

408
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,837
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY SORRY.

409
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,004
OKAY.

410
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:54,716
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T SAY
SORRY TO ME AGAIN.

411
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,475
BRIT, HE'S GONNA BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

412
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:59,044
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MEET HIM YET.

413
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:01,580
ARE YOU TRYING
TO REPLACE ME?

414
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,582
OF COURSE NOT.

415
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,884
- OKAY, BYE.
- BYE.

416
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,420
BYE BYE BYE BYE.

417
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:33,412
HI.

418
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:41,587
I DIDN'T SEE THIS
THE FIRST TIME.

419
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,889
IT WAS ON MINE TOO.

420
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,392
THE SAME EXACT THING?

421
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:47,559
YEAH.

422
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:50,496
SO THAT'S YOUR DAD?

423
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:13,985
ARE YOU MAD AT ME
FOR SOME REASON?

424
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,600
- BABE.
- NO.

425
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:31,537
WHAT IS GOING ON?

426
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,805
I HATE THIS.
I'M TERRIFIED.

427
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,141
MY LIFE IS TERRIFYING.

428
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,677
THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME
FOR ME TO BE ALONE.

429
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,618
YOU'RE NOT.

430
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,055
I KNOW.

431
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:15,601
WHAT'S WRONG?

432
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:24,610
IAN COMMITTED SUICIDE
LAST NIGHT.

433
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:32,250
I DON'T THINK
HE DID IT.

434
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,820
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

435
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:39,157
HE SUFFOCATED HIMSELF
IN THE CAR.

436
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,032
IT WASN'T EVEN
HIS HOUSE.

437
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,671
GOD, THIS
FUCKING SUCKS.

438
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:59,044
I THINK I KNOW
WHO TOOK THE PICTURE.

439
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:03,715
HE USUALLY COMES BACK FROM
WORK RIGHT BEFORE I GO TO SCHOOL.

440
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:05,316
HE'S A SECURITY GUARD.

441
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,185
WHAT ABOUT HIS WIFE?

442
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:09,187
JUST ABOUT TO LEAVE.

443
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,789
OKAY, SO HOW LONG
DO WE HAVE?

444
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,891
AT LEAST 15 MINUTES.

445
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:17,362
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS.

446
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:19,865
WE HAVE TO DO THIS, OKAY?
THERE'S NO BETTER TIME.

447
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:46,658
I THINK THEY HAVE A KEY
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

448
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:14,953
HEY, PUT THAT DOWN.

449
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:44,049
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

450
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:46,785
WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO?

451
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:31,189
OH, YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.

452
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:32,958
YOU'RE ANNOYING.
WHAT ARE YOU...?

453
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:35,393
- WHATEVER.
- WHATEVER.

454
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:49,274
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO DISTRACT HIM OR SOMETHING.

455
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:02,587
I JUST CAME BY TO TELL YOU
THAT I DON'T THINK

456
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,690
I CAN COME BACK TO YOUR
CLASS RIGHT NOW.

457
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:08,326
OKAY.

458
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,796
- WHAT HAPPENED.
- I TOLD HIM.

459
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:13,640
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD HIM.
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.

460
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:15,300
ANGELA, OF COURSE HE DIDN'T.
NO ONE WILL.

461
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:16,834
I THOUGHT HE WOULD.

462
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:19,270
SWEETIE, LET'S GO
TO YOUR HOUSE, OKAY?

463
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:20,847
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO
GO BACK THERE RIGHT NOW.

464
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:23,708
COULD WE PLEASE
JUST GO TO YOURS?

465
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,710
OF COURSE.

466
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:27,778
IT'S OKAY.

467
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:31,649
WE'RE GONNA GET
THROUGH THIS, OKAY?

468
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:06,644
PLEASE NO.

469
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:10,481
I CAN'T.

470
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:17,114
WE WENT INTO HIS HOUSE.
WE CAN'T GO TO THE POLICE.

471
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,017
IAN WOULDN'T KILL HIMSELF.

472
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,952
- MAYBE HE DID.
- NO.

473
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,721
BRIAN.

474
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:26,591
- I TOOK ONE OF THE TAPES.
- BRIAN.

475
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:29,494
IT HAS TO BE HIM, ANGELA.
I HAD TO BE SURE.

476
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:31,496
- Angela: WHY WOULD HE...?
- HEY, GUYS.

477
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:34,031
HEY, GRAHAM.

478
00:55:37,602 --> 00:55:40,004
HEY, ANGEY.

479
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:43,508
OH, SORRY.
HEY, GRAHAM.

480
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,745
WAIT A SECOND.
HOW...

481
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:49,947
DID I INTRODUCE
YOU GUYS?

482
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,081
WHAT?

483
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:53,050
YEAH, THE OTHER DAY
SHE WAS OVER.

484
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,919
NO, I WASN'T.

485
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:59,056
MAYBE IT WAS
SOMEONE ELSE.

486
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,125
Angela: I GUESS I JUST
FIGURED WE HAD MET

487
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:04,929
'CAUSE I'D SEEN YOU SO MANY
TIMES WALK IN AND OUT OF...

488
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:06,531
I GUESS THAT'S
YOUR ROOM?

489
00:56:06,564 --> 00:56:08,533
YEAH, THAT'S MY ROOM.

490
00:56:08,566 --> 00:56:10,868
HOW DID YOU KNOW
HER NAME?

491
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:13,471
YOU MUST HAVE TOLD ME.

492
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:15,440
NO, I DIDN'T.

493
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:17,484
MAYBE SHE JUST LOOKS LIKE AN
ANGELA. I DON'T FUCKING KNOW.

494
00:56:17,508 --> 00:56:18,776
YEAH, BUT YOU
CALLED ME ANGEY.

495
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,678
IT'S A FUCKING
NICKNAME.

496
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,414
YOU KNOW WHAT, GRAHAM?
I'M SORRY, MAN,

497
00:56:23,448 --> 00:56:25,416
CAN YOU GET OUT
OF HERE, PLEASE?

498
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,985
ALL RIGHT.
JESUS.

499
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:32,590
SEE YOU SOON,
ANGELIQUE.

500
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,831
HELLO.

501
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:43,200
HEY, I'M AT YOUR HOUSE.

502
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,604
HUH-UH.
I WAS ON MY WAY TO MY MOM'S

503
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:49,006
AND I WANTED TO STOP HERE
AND SEE YOU FIRST.

504
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:51,041
IT WAS OPEN.

505
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,945
YEAH.
WHERE ARE YOU AT?

506
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:57,615
OH, OF COURSE.

507
00:56:57,648 --> 00:57:00,117
BE SAFE, ANGE.

508
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:03,521
HELLO?

509
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:06,056
I CAN'T HEAR ANYMORE.

510
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,058
ANGE, IF YOU'RE
SAYING SOMETHING,

511
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:10,060
I CAN'T HEAR ANYMORE.

512
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:12,863
I'M HANGING UP.
BYE.

513
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,736
SHE WAS AT MY HOUSE.

514
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,671
INSIDE?

515
00:57:20,705 --> 00:57:22,039
YEAH.

516
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:26,744
LOOK AT THIS.

517
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:31,882
THIS IS THE TAPE
I PULLED FROM HIS HOUSE.

518
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:14,231
HELP ME.

519
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:17,768
HELP. HELP.

520
01:02:17,802 --> 01:02:19,236
HELP.

521
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:49,026
WHAT?

522
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:51,028
WHAT WHAT?

523
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:52,897
NO.

524
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:54,631
OKAY.

525
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,000
LISTEN...

526
01:03:56,033 --> 01:03:58,535
YOU WANT A GRANOLA BAR?

527
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,439
IS IT LATE?

528
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,311
IS GRAHAM HOME?

529
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:12,282
I DON'T KNOW.
HIS DOOR IS ALWAYS CLOSED.

530
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,393
WHAT?

531
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:34,371
I DON'T THINK
I WANT TO GO IN.

532
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:40,077
WHAT'S UP?

533
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:42,079
I JUST
DON'T WANT TO.

534
01:04:42,112 --> 01:04:43,613
THEN WHY ARE WE HERE,
ANGELA?

535
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:45,249
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I
DON'T WANT TO GO IN.

536
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:47,051
WHY?

537
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:53,623
I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
SINCE THE BURIAL.

538
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:56,493
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

539
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:59,096
- I'M STILL MAD AT HER.
- SO?

540
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:01,431
I'M NOT READY
TO FORGIVE HER.

541
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:04,101
YOU HAVE TO.

542
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:09,373
I DON'T HAVE TO.
WHY DO I HAVE TO?

543
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:12,109
I DON'T WANT TO,
SO WHY DO I HAVE TO?

544
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:16,046
SHE MADE A COMMITMENT
TO HER LIFE WHEN SHE HAD ME,

545
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,382
WHICH SHE COMPLETELY IGNORED
WHEN SHE LEFT ME.

546
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,117
YOUR DAD LEFT TOO,
DIDN'T HE?

547
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:22,686
YEAH, WELL,
I DON'T NEED HIM, OKAY?

548
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:25,389
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T NEED
TO LIVE ANYMORE,

549
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:26,723
BUT I NEEDED HER TOO.

550
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,725
AND SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT THAT.

551
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,428
AND SHE JUST LEFT ME.

552
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:33,330
WHATEVER, ANGELA.

553
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:36,100
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE, OKAY?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, HUH?

554
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:38,002
ARE YOU JUST GONNA
STAY MAD AT HER FOREVER?

555
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:39,345
WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU
YOU'RE JUST GONNA SAY,

556
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:41,138
"MY MOM DIED.
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO HER GRAVE"?

557
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:43,107
WHY DO YOU CARE
WHAT I DO?

558
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:46,043
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
THERE'S SOMETHING BETWEEN US.

559
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:50,747
HEY, I KNOW

560
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,217
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU.

561
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,685
I'VE BEEN THERE.

562
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:58,288
I'M CURRENTLY THERE.

563
01:05:58,322 --> 01:06:00,290
I'M GONNA BE
BOLD HERE, ANGELA,

564
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:03,227
AND I'M GONNA SAY
THAT SOMEONE KILLED MY DAD.

565
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,562
I BELIEVE THAT.

566
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,998
AND YOU CAN EITHER
TAKE THINGS

567
01:06:08,032 --> 01:06:09,533
THE WAY YOU HAVE BEEN
ALL THIS TIME

568
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:12,236
AND STAY STUCK IN THIS...

569
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:15,505
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS...
RUT, I GUESS.

570
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:18,442
OR YOU CAN
AT THE VERY LEAST ADMIT

571
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:21,211
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
GOING ON HERE.

572
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:25,249
SOMEONE HATES US.

573
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:33,523
I DON'T KNOW,

574
01:06:33,557 --> 01:06:36,360
MAYBE YOU CAN ASK HER
FOR AN APOLOGY.

575
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:03,153
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

576
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:05,422
MY MOM'S THIS WAY.

577
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:07,424
ARE YOU GONNA
BE OKAY?

578
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:08,692
ARE YOU?

579
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:14,564
I'll SEE YOU SOON.

580
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:23,433
BRIAN!

581
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:28,705
- I GOT A...
- I GOT A TAPE.

582
01:11:08,732 --> 01:11:10,700
IT'S OKAY, COME ON.
WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.

583
01:11:10,734 --> 01:11:12,736
COME ON, IT'S OKAY.
COME ON, WE'LL BE FINE.

584
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,871
COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO GET
BACK TO THE CAR. COME ON.

585
01:11:14,904 --> 01:11:16,740
- I'M COMING.
- WE'LL BE FINE, OKAY?

586
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,518
WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK
TO THE CAR. DON'T WORRY.

587
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:20,710
WE'LL BE FINE, OKAY?
COME ON, LET'S GO.

588
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:22,512
LET'S GO.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

589
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:24,314
I'M COMING.

590
01:11:24,348 --> 01:11:26,459
WE'LL BE FINE. WE'VE GOT TO
GET BACK TO THE CAR, COME ON.

591
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:28,452
WE'LL BE FINE.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

592
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:30,454
LET'S GO, COME ON.
LET'S GO. COME ON, BABY.

593
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:32,422
LET'S GO. WE'VE GOT
TO GET BACK TO THE CAR.

594
01:11:47,704 --> 01:11:50,574
- IT'S FINE. WE'LL BE FINE.
- HE'S GONNA KILL US.

595
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:53,042
WE GOTTA KEEP ON DRIVING
FOR A WHILE, OKAY?

596
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:55,011
WHAT DOES HE WANT?
WHAT THE FUCK DOES HE WANT?

597
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:57,013
WHY DOES HE HATE US?

598
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:59,816
WHY DID HE KILL MY MOM?

599
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,791
I HAVE TO CALL HER AGAIN.
I HAVE TO CALL BRIT.

600
01:12:10,894 --> 01:12:12,929
HEY, BRIT.

601
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:16,466
BRIT?

602
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,338
IT WASN'T BRIT.

603
01:12:38,755 --> 01:12:40,857
WHAT IS IT?

604
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,559
A CAR.

605
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:45,662
IS IT HIS?

606
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,498
THE HEADLIGHTS
ARE OFF.

607
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:50,734
DON'T.

608
01:12:50,767 --> 01:12:53,437
IT'S NOT THAT DARK.

609
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:54,704
IT'S DARK.

610
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:05,515
IT'S OKAY.
HE'S GONE.

611
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:10,086
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?

612
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:12,088
- I DON'T KNOW. JESUS.
- SOMETHING IN YOUR TRUNK?

613
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:14,090
NO.

614
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:16,125
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.
FUCK.

615
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:18,161
OH, GOD.

616
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,466
JESUS CHRIST.
WE HAVE TO STOP.

617
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:24,133
WHAT IS THAT?

618
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:27,771
WE HAVE TO STOP.
I THINK YOUR TIRE BLEW.

619
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:13,643
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

620
01:15:13,677 --> 01:15:15,545
WE NEED TO KEEP ON
DRIVING, OKAY?

621
01:15:15,579 --> 01:15:17,781
BUT THE SPARE'S
UNDER HIM.

622
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:22,719
IS THIS THE ONE?

623
01:15:22,752 --> 01:15:26,022
I THINK SO.

624
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:29,225
IT'S WEIRD.
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG.

625
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,768
I THINK WE SHOULD GO.

626
01:15:38,802 --> 01:15:40,770
WHERE CAN WE GO?

627
01:15:40,804 --> 01:15:42,806
FIND SOMEONE.

628
01:15:42,839 --> 01:15:45,074
AND TELL THEM THAT WE HAVE
MY DEAD NEIGHBOR

629
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:47,611
IN THE TRUNK
WITH A GUN?

630
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:54,183
IF WE GET BACK ON THE ROAD,
HE'LL KILLS US.

631
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:57,754
WE'RE NOT ANY SAFER
IF WE STAY HERE.

632
01:15:57,787 --> 01:16:00,156
YEAH, BUT...

633
01:16:04,628 --> 01:16:08,064
IF I LEAVE IT'S LIKE I NEVER
FORGAVE HER FOR DYING.

634
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:13,069
I CAN'T DO THAT.

635
01:16:18,975 --> 01:16:21,010
OKAY.

636
01:16:27,651 --> 01:16:30,654
THE MOON'S BIG TONIGHT.

637
01:16:30,687 --> 01:16:33,256
I CAN'T TELL
IF IT'S FULL.

638
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:36,926
I NEVER CAN.

639
01:16:39,763 --> 01:16:42,398
I THINK IT IS.

640
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:46,235
IT'S USUALLY FOGGY. YOU CAN'T
SEE THE MOON MOST NIGHTS.

641
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:48,705
YOU CAME HERE AT NIGHT?

642
01:16:48,738 --> 01:16:51,107
WE WENT ALL THE TIME.

643
01:17:12,161 --> 01:17:14,698
EVEN NOW...

644
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:22,005
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW

645
01:17:22,038 --> 01:17:24,808
THAT I'M GLAD
I MET YOU.

646
01:17:32,415 --> 01:17:35,051
I'M GLAD
I MET YOU TOO.

647
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:47,831
- ANGELA.
- MM?

648
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:49,833
IT'S MORNING.

649
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:52,101
LET'S GO.

650
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:56,906
BUT I'M SO COMFORTABLE.

651
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:59,809
COME ON, LET'S GO.

652
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,269
HER NAME WAS BETH.

653
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:18,347
DON'T BOTHER
SCREAMING, OKAY?

654
01:20:18,381 --> 01:20:21,050
BECAUSE NO ONE'S GONNA
HEAR YOU...

655
01:20:21,084 --> 01:20:23,452
NO NEIGHBORS.

656
01:20:33,897 --> 01:20:37,233
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO BE CRYING.

657
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:40,203
SORRY.

658
01:20:40,236 --> 01:20:42,371
SHUT UP!

659
01:20:42,405 --> 01:20:46,442
SEE, THAT'S THE THING...

660
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:50,279
NO ONE EVER
APOLOGIZED TO ME,

661
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:52,982
NOT ONCE.

662
01:20:53,016 --> 01:20:55,518
SO WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

663
01:20:57,653 --> 01:20:59,422
HMM? WHAT?

664
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:01,991
WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

665
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:05,294
I OWE YOU NOTHING.

666
01:21:05,328 --> 01:21:09,098
I OWE YOU HELL.

667
01:21:09,132 --> 01:21:11,534
THEY TOOK IT ALL.

668
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:15,571
THEY TOOK
EVERYTHING I LOVED.

669
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:19,909
IT WAS TONSILLITIS.

670
01:21:21,945 --> 01:21:23,913
TONSILLITIS.

671
01:21:23,947 --> 01:21:26,149
CAN YOU FUCKING
BELIEVE THAT?

672
01:21:26,182 --> 01:21:29,185
IT'S NOT EVEN
A REAL DISEASE.

673
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:30,954
I'M SORRY.

674
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:32,521
SHUT UP!

675
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:37,260
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME.

676
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:39,963
IT HAPPENED TO HER.

677
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:44,968
THAT'S BETH.

678
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:49,572
MY LIFE WAS DESTROYED
BECAUSE OF TWO FUCKING PEOPLE.

679
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:51,574
- I'M SORRY.
- SHUT UP.

680
01:21:51,607 --> 01:21:54,243
SHUT UP. SHUT UP.

681
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:56,445
SHUT UP.
SHUT UP.

682
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:03,519
SEE, THAT'S WHY
I DID IT THIS WAY...

683
01:22:03,552 --> 01:22:06,122
TO KEEP YOU SAFE,
YOU KNOW,

684
01:22:06,155 --> 01:22:09,192
SO NOBODY WOULD EVER KNOW.
THEY WOULD JUST HAVE TO GUESS

685
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:11,594
AND MAKE UP LITTLE STORIES
ABOUT WHY THEIR CHILDREN

686
01:22:11,627 --> 01:22:13,997
OR THEIR PARENTS
HATED THEIR LIVES.

687
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:16,099
WE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO YOU.

688
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:19,135
AND WHAT DID
MY DAUGHTER DO?

689
01:22:21,004 --> 01:22:23,639
YOU ARE TOO STUPID
FOR THIS CLASS.

690
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:26,642
IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHAT YOU DID.

691
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:30,113
IT'S ABOUT WHAT
YOUR PARENTS DID.

692
01:22:31,414 --> 01:22:34,650
THEY DESTROYED
MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE.

693
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:37,987
AND NOW I'M GONNA
DESTROY YOURS.

694
01:22:38,021 --> 01:22:39,989
NO. NO.

695
01:22:40,023 --> 01:22:42,591
I'VE TAKEN
EVERYONE YOU LOVE.

696
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,593
AND NOW I'M GONNA
TAKE YOU.

697
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:46,529
NO.

698
01:22:46,562 --> 01:22:50,166
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
A NORMAL PROCEDURE,

699
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:51,767
ANGELA.

700
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,970
SO COULDN'T YOUR PARENTS
HAVE DONE THEIR JOBS?

701
01:23:05,681 --> 01:23:08,751
NO, IT WASN'T
THEIR FAULT.

702
01:23:08,784 --> 01:23:11,787
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

703
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,590
MAYBE IT WAS WORSE
THAN WHAT THEY THOUGHT.

704
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:30,539
NO NO NO NO.

705
01:23:30,573 --> 01:23:33,409
YOUR PARENTS...

706
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:36,145
