00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:54,971
Hi.

3
00:01:54,973 --> 00:01:58,204
Um, whoever's watching,
I just wanted to say,

4
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:01,171
if you are at the camp
and we're not back yet,

5
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:03,305
that I just wanted to say
don't worry.

6
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:05,937
Uh, the ascension is something
we've all been looking forward to

7
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,337
and we couldn't be happier,

8
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:10,237
so our round-trip from this
place and back

9
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,238
is really something
to celebrate.

10
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,604
So, um...

11
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:17,470
eat and drink and make yourself
comfortable,

12
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:22,070
and we look forward to seeing
you when we return.

13
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:24,938
Um...

14
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,873
Okay. Bye.

15
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:43,137
You seriously spent
$20 on that

16
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,338
and didn't get
the car battery?

17
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,604
You said they did it
already.

18
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:48,238
- Nope. No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

19
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,371
No. I said that
right before we left,

20
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:54,536
I was told that they were all
were gonna kill themselves.

21
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:57,570
And that's why we left
the cult.

22
00:02:57,572 --> 00:03:00,436
She didn't say anything about
killing themselves.

23
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:02,137
She didn't.

24
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:04,170
It's a UFO death cult.

25
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:05,904
It's what they do.

26
00:03:05,906 --> 00:03:08,370
They just call it
something different.

27
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:10,003
I rescued us from a cult.

28
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:12,238
I saved you from mass suicide.

29
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,341
You're welcome.

30
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,204
The, uh, owner still gone?

31
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:31,037
Yep. But be fast.

32
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,837
You want, um, pork or shrimp?

33
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,137
Uh, neither. I'm good.

34
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:38,038
- You're not eating lunch?
- Nope.

35
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,838
Gotta save the money you spent
on antique video equipment

36
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,504
and not the car battery.

37
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,237
Oh, tattoos, those were
an investment.

38
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,406
What?

39
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,437
You know they used to feed us
real food.

40
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,540
You know, vegetables and fish
that's not powder.

41
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:04,571
I'd rather be alive and eat
raman

42
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:08,336
than be dead and eat...
corn.

43
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:12,137
I know they were going to do
it, now they clearly are,

44
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,871
so I was, like,
ten years off.

45
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:16,938
They didn't say anything about
killing themselves.

46
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,537
They said...
Move your head.

47
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,870
They said they were going
somewhere,

48
00:04:20,872 --> 00:04:23,336
and we don't know how long or
where they were going...

49
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:25,437
- Good.
- How's that good?

50
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,070
If we were back at the camp,
we'd have, like,

51
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:29,473
good food and support,
and we wouldn't be

52
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,404
one dirty house away
from being homeless.

53
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:33,038
I need the car.

54
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,571
I've got deprogramming in, like,
half an hour. Ow.

55
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:38,537
I don't want to go to
deprogramming anymore.

56
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,337
Are you gonna be the one to
get another job

57
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:42,269
if we don't qualify for aid?

58
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:44,303
And stop leaving the dome light
on in the car.

59
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:46,370
You're making the car battery
even worse if that's possible.

60
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,571
It was mostly a joke.

61
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:02,071
But, um...

62
00:05:02,073 --> 00:05:05,071
he's not happy.

63
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:08,070
I heard him crying
the other night, again.

64
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:11,137
And, um...

65
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,970
the cult sent us
a good-bye video.

66
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:20,403
Whoa. What was that like?

67
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:22,904
I mean, I was relieved,
at first,

68
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:27,536
because... they're not dead.

69
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:30,137
And then I felt bad.

70
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:32,138
Because now Aaron thinks
I pulled him out

71
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,103
all those years ago
for no reason.

72
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:38,103
All of his memories
of the cult

73
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:42,038
are as a kid or a teenager
or whatever.

74
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,503
So all those memories
are good,

75
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:47,537
and he sees our lives here
as horrible.

76
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:50,137
But, to me,

77
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,236
the thing that makes our lives
here better

78
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:56,138
is thinking for ourselves.

79
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,037
And I don't know why we haven't
been able

80
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,904
to make a living
or make friends...

81
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:04,507
meet girls.

82
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,937
Recovery from cult mind
control is a lifelong process,

83
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,971
and if he resents you for
pulling him out,

84
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:17,236
that's common.

85
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:20,469
Whether he resents me
or he doesn't,

86
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:23,937
feeling responsible for
his well-being 24/7

87
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,172
is exhausting.

88
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,938
They're gonna take the car.

89
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,504
The credit card was
a bad idea.

90
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:39,037
I'll figure it out.

91
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,840
Yeah, okay.

92
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:51,204
I wanna go back.

93
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:53,503
Have fun with that.

94
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:55,436
No, I'm serious.

95
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:57,907
I'm going,
just... for a visit.

96
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:03,071
You have a horrible memory.

97
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:04,537
That place is not
what you think it is.

98
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:07,140
- I know.
- Great. Let's not go.

99
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,439
Why do you wanna go back?

100
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,536
We can say good-bye.

101
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:27,239
Get some closure.

102
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:31,405
They were our family.

103
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:52,136
One day.
One night.

104
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,871
We come straight back.

105
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:58,837
Will that make you
feel better?

106
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,137
Uh...

107
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,603
Because if that'll get you
out of this slump,

108
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:06,172
we can go back.

109
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:09,270
I mean, he's trying.

110
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:11,403
He's trying lots of things,
but...

111
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:14,871
this one time,
by some miracle,

112
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:16,270
we met these girls
at the park,

113
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:20,137
and he takes 'em to this
cheap Mexican food place,

114
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,604
down by the apartment.

115
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:24,337
And, out of, like...

116
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:25,971
out of, like,
nervousness or something,

117
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:30,137
he's like, "I'm an ex-UFO
death cult member."

118
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,103
And she's like, "Okay, I have
to go to the bathroom."

119
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:35,170
And she obviously never
comes back.

120
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:37,406
And her friend never
returned my calls.

121
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:41,971
But that's him, though,
you know?

122
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:44,204
Uh...

123
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:46,370
He's trying to do
the right thing.

124
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:48,537
He really is.

125
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:53,204
But it has to be his way...

126
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:55,469
which never works.

127
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:58,469
And so the only thing that's
worse than this shitty life

128
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,004
he's built for us is having
no fucking control over it.

129
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:03,106
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:07,269
Have you talked
to him about this?

131
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:09,871
No, no, he's my brother.

132
00:09:09,873 --> 00:09:12,070
And you're
sure it's a good idea

133
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:13,304
to go back to the cult?

134
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:15,203
It's not a cult.

135
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,937
It's a commune.

136
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:22,336
Uniforms. Redefining words.

137
00:09:22,338 --> 00:09:26,403
Calling death "ascension."

138
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:29,169
Worshipping a deity
in the forest

139
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:32,204
that no one else knows about.

140
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:35,070
And...

141
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:37,006
castration.

142
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,169
Okay, yeah, that's a cult.

143
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:43,136
But I actually don't remember
any of those things.

144
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:49,504
I just remember, like, bonfires,
family time, and good food.

145
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,604
It's wasn't like they were
keeping us prisoner or anything.

146
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:53,136
Actually, hang on a second.

147
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:54,903
If they were gonna be, like,

148
00:09:54,905 --> 00:09:56,469
pointing machine guns at our
heads

149
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,537
and make us drink cyanide
Kool-Aid,

150
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:01,536
why would you be driving us
there right now?

151
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:04,470
All right, I never saw
anything specifically like that.

152
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:08,203
But in your distorted memory,
we were, like...

153
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:11,536
petting deer and dancing with
koalas.

154
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:13,303
We were, I remember that.

155
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:14,969
Boobs.

156
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:17,571

I just wanted to say I'm doing
my best to take care of him.

167
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:56,571
What?

168
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,036
What?

169
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:01,102
- Nothing.
- I heard you.

170
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:03,269
No, you didn't.

171
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,903

- No.

172
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:07,436
You're praying to her grave.

173
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:09,404
It's not a grave,
it's a memoriam.

174
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:11,203
Ah, talking to a memoriam.

175
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:14,838
That's totally not praying
to a grave.

176
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,037
That's sweet. I think someone's
been by or something.

177

Look. It's brand-new.

178

No, we actually made that from
when we were little

179
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:23,469
because she liked to paint.

180
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:26,837
Wow, that really held up.

181
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:41,571
What the heck are those?

182
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:44,837
It's like a volcanic
event,

183
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:47,237
hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

184
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,604
And then erosion or...

185
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:52,440
something.

186
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:22,937
Hey, mind of I drive
for a bit?

187
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:24,436
Nah, I'll just go
the rest of the way.

188
00:12:24,438 --> 00:12:26,102
You drove the whole way.
I wanna drive.

189
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:28,372
I'm driving.
Get in.

190
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:39,905
Not a cult at all.

191
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:07,570
Smells good.

192
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:10,105
Smells like the barley.

193
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:16,440
Hey!

194
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:27,069
Good to see you two.

195
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,903
What the dickens bring you
all the way out here?

196
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:34,070
Just thought we'd visit while
you're, uh... here.

197
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:36,306
We're always here.

198
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:40,337
You hungry?

199
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,169
I'm always hungry.

200
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:44,106
Let's get you fed.

201
00:14:57,305 --> 00:14:59,506
You boys remember Tim,
right?

202
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:03,469
- How's it going, Tim?
- Hey.

203
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:05,570
You gotta try Tim's
new Hefeweizen.

204
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,170
It is delicious.

205
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:12,037
Whoa! I didn't know you guys
were gonna be here.

206
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,069
It's good to see you guys!

207
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:15,836
- Shane, Anna.
- Hi!

208
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:18,304
This is weird. Aaron is, like,
all grown up.

209
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,404
Do you remember me?

210
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:22,273
Yeah, a little.

211
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:28,369
So, you all look, uh...

212
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:29,837
Healthy?

213
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,369
Fresh food, air, and ale.

214
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:35,069
That'll do it.

215
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:37,137
I was gonna say
exactly the same.

216
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,937
- This is amazing.
- Thank you.

217
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,369
Shane and Anna, they grew
the barley for that batch,

218
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:45,037
so they deserve credit.

219
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,069
- Tim, his beer, is our most profitable export.
- Yeah.

220
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:51,070
Oh! You boys haven't met Lizzy.

221
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,469
It's nice to finally
meet you two.

222
00:15:53,471 --> 00:15:55,872
Everyone says all kinds
of stuff about you.

223
00:15:57,272 --> 00:15:59,869
Thanks. Uh, how'd you
end up here?

224
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,870
I was at a mental health
facility up the road,

225
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:05,204
and I use to wander out
quite a bit.

226
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:08,036
And on one of my wanderings,
I met Tim

227
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:11,239
and just realized
I'm better here.

228
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:18,437
You boys remember Dave,
right?

229
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:21,006
Hey.

230
00:16:22,604 --> 00:16:26,204
You know, Lizzy,
she's a great artist.

231
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:29,003
Actually, her sketches,
they kind of remind me

232
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:30,204
of your photography,
Justin.

233
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,270
Oh, yeah.

234
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:33,336
You were a photographer?

235
00:16:33,338 --> 00:16:35,070
Um, not really.

236
00:16:35,072 --> 00:16:36,404
It's when you were really
little.

237
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:37,970
He was really good.

238
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:41,069
Well, could have been,
given time.

239
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:43,070
It's like Shane's
magic tricks.

240
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:45,204
I'm all right.
It's a million hours, right?

241
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:47,570
- Man, I hope so.
- A million hours?

242
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:49,336
Yeah, a million hours is the
amount of time

243
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:51,203
it takes to actually master
something.

244
00:16:51,205 --> 00:16:54,269
So, if you live to be
115 years old

245
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,970
and you spend your waking,
sleeping moments

246
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:57,970
just dedicated to one thing,
then...

247
00:16:57,972 --> 00:17:00,203
yeah, mastery is
a possibility.

248
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:02,372
Absolutely.

249
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:08,372
That's mine.

250
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:13,170
You think Anna and Shane
are together?

251
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:15,336
Well, they're all castrated.

252
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:17,602
So do you mean, like,
emotionally?

253
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,204
They don't seem castrated.

254
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,369
You don't know how castrated
people act.

255
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:24,336
And you realize she's, like,
20 years older than you.

256
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:26,270
- No, she's not.
- Yes.

257
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:27,469
- No.
- Yeah.

258
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:30,103
They're all in, like, their 40s.
They just look young.

259
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:31,970
It's weird.

260
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:34,836
They just look like they take
care of themselves

261
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:37,372
and don't eat dirty garbage
food.

262
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:42,472
Taking a nap?

263
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:48,340
I... am gonna go for a run.

264
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:13,505
Hey!

265
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:37,436
Uh, okay, actually, I've been
working on this one.

266
00:19:37,438 --> 00:19:39,870
Pick a card, any card.

267
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:42,403
No, no, no, no.

268
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:46,206
He's just gonna keep picking
the same one.

269
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,439
I don't wanna touch the card.
Okay, just put it on top.

270
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:15,103
Can I show you something
back in my cabin?

271
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:18,369
Um... right now?

272
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:20,438
Unless you know
a better time.

273
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,905
Sure.

274
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,838
Try this one.

275
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:49,936
It's interesting.

276
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:53,170
Did a small batch.
Thinking about doing a big run.

277
00:20:53,172 --> 00:20:55,140
That Tim, he is good.

278
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:05,239
You, uh...
you figure it out yet?

279
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:10,336
Not yet.

280
00:21:10,338 --> 00:21:12,402
Eventually, though.

281
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,969
Sometimes I wish I wasn't so
damned left-brained.

282
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:20,170
It either is or it
isn't and...

283
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:23,873
this equation isn't...
yet.

284
00:21:25,171 --> 00:21:28,137
All right.

285
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:29,502
I gotta ask.

286
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,872
What's it solve?

287
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:36,172
Wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

288
00:21:47,304 --> 00:21:51,170
I like that everyone here kind of
has a little thing that they do.

289
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:53,436
Yeah. I mean, some people have
two or three,

290
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,773
but, yeah, everybody has
at least one. Yeah.

291
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,503
So, you're like
the clothing designer?

292
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:05,436
You do the camp's clothes?

293
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:07,102
Yeah, yeah.

294
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,136
I mean, I make a lot of
stuff from scratch, but I...

295
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:11,570
you know, whatever I can find
at thrift stores and...

296
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:12,902
That's where I got this.

297
00:22:12,904 --> 00:22:14,869
Yeah.

298
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:18,170
I used to make a lot of your
clothes. Do you remember that?

299
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:20,402
No. I mean...

300
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:22,468
I'm sorry. It's just been
a long time. Sorry.

301
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,070
Yeah.

302
00:22:25,072 --> 00:22:27,039
Do you wanna see some
of my new designs?

303
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:32,335
Listen, uh, I just wanted
to tell you again

304
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:35,602
that everything you did,

305
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,838
it ranges from "I don't care"
to "All is forgiven."

306
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:44,936
Now, that being said,

307
00:22:44,938 --> 00:22:48,136
why come back now?

308
00:22:48,138 --> 00:22:51,137
The video you sent.

309
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:53,137
What video?

310
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,903
The video.

311
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:58,303
With Anna talking about...

312
00:22:58,305 --> 00:23:00,006
the end.

313
00:23:06,204 --> 00:23:09,471
Never been a suicide on this
property that I'm aware of.

314
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:17,106
In fact, I can assure you that
nothing here ends.

315
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:23,302
All that happens here is that
people live long and healthy lives.

316
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:25,569
Because of that,
they grow to be

317
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,902
the people they want to be.

318
00:23:28,904 --> 00:23:32,105
Pretty simple.

319
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,972
There is something bigger
than us out here.

320
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:43,603
And now that you're both at an
age where you can understand it,

321
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:46,103
it'll become...

322
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:48,806
evident.

323
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:53,806
All right. Uh...

324
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:58,902
All right.

325
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,972
I'll get you another beer.

326
00:24:11,504 --> 00:24:13,903
- You ready?
- Yeah.

327
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:17,870
- Ta-da.
- Oh, whoa.

328
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:19,503
These are good.

329
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:21,235
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

330
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:23,202
Wait. What do you
and Justin do?

331
00:24:23,204 --> 00:24:26,503
Um... we clean.

332
00:24:26,505 --> 00:24:27,937
Impressive?

333
00:24:27,939 --> 00:24:29,235
Didn't you used to like
to fish?

334
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:33,002
Yeah, you know,
when I was a kid, but...

335
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:36,902
I don't think I even remember
how to tie a fishing knot.

336
00:24:36,904 --> 00:24:38,304
You know?

337
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,903
Uh, do you get paid for this?

338
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:44,939
What, for being
alone with you?

339
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:48,570
Come on!

340
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,168
Yes, of course!

341
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,435
I mean, the money comes
from the beer, but...

342
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:55,503
yeah, we all get paid for
everything we do.

343
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:58,172
So you never have to leave?

344
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:05,602
All right.
Black ace.

345
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,937
Just focus on these angels here
for a second.

346
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,403
One, two...

347
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:12,036
So we got your red from
earlier, right?

348
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:14,169
And with this little...

349
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:15,369
black, yeah.

350
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:17,737
I think I see
what you're doing.

351
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:24,202
Come here.
You're gonna pick a card.

352
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:26,939
Come on.

353
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:43,204
Take a look at it.

354
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:48,304
Put it back in
wherever you want.

355
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,105
Very good.

356
00:26:04,138 --> 00:26:05,806
Is that your card?

357
00:26:08,205 --> 00:26:10,472
No.

358
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,168
Have you seen Aaron?

359
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,969
Yeah, he's in Anna's cabin
with her.

360
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:20,902
You all right with that?

361
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:23,439
Why wouldn't I be
all right with that?

362
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:28,403
You wanna see another trick?

363
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:30,236
Come on, just humor me.

364
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:32,806
It's a new one I'm working on.
Come on.

365
00:26:56,003 --> 00:26:58,472
Relax. Relax.

366
00:27:07,137 --> 00:27:10,004
All right! Who's
ready for The Struggle?

367
00:27:41,071 --> 00:27:42,602
Hey, why doesn't Dave talk?

368
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:44,435
Brain injury.

369
00:27:44,437 --> 00:27:47,536
Hal says he fell off a building
while working construction,

370
00:27:47,538 --> 00:27:50,901
and Tim told me it was
self-trephination.

371
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:54,502
You drill a hole in your skull
so you stay permanently high.

372
00:27:54,504 --> 00:27:57,303
He drilled too far.

373
00:27:57,305 --> 00:28:00,602
Ladies and gentlemen,
for most of you,

374
00:28:00,604 --> 00:28:03,036
this requires no explanation.

375
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:05,536
But we have many
traditions here at Camp Arcadia,

376
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:09,436
none more prominent than
The Struggle.

377
00:28:13,304 --> 00:28:17,402
We have the struggle
with passion!

378
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:21,235
The struggle for growth!

379
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:26,001
The struggle with
a higher power!

380
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:28,836
Smiling Dave on a ladder.

381
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:30,368
And...

382
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,435
And...

383
00:28:33,437 --> 00:28:35,335
What, Anna?

384
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:39,570
That would be all of which
we overcome with perseverance.

385
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:41,502
You're the one
who invented this,

386
00:28:41,504 --> 00:28:43,835
so why am I always the one
looking ridiculous emceeing it?

387
00:28:43,837 --> 00:28:46,135
Because I'm reigning champion,
that's why.

388
00:28:49,237 --> 00:28:52,569
That you are.

389
00:28:52,571 --> 00:28:55,135
Whoo!
I need a breather.

390
00:28:55,137 --> 00:28:57,037
Who's next?

391
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,838
Come on, who's next?

392
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:07,139
Aaron?

393
00:29:09,904 --> 00:29:12,036
Nah. I'm good.
Next time. Thank you.

394
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:14,503
Come on.

395
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,303
What do you say, guys,
can we get him up here?

396
00:29:16,305 --> 00:29:19,168
- Come on, man!
- Come on!

397
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,302
Let's go!

398
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:26,205
There you go.

399
00:29:48,571 --> 00:29:51,268
It's all right.
It's all right.

400
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,304
Can I go again?

401
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,172
We never give up.

402
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:47,202
All right!
Whoo!

403
00:30:50,404 --> 00:30:53,468
First man to use
a fishing knot

404
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,136
in The Struggle is victorious!

405
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:02,838
Who's next?

406
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:08,072
Justin?

407
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:16,102
I'm sorry. I really don't
want to right now.

408
00:31:16,104 --> 00:31:17,439
You sure?

409
00:31:26,104 --> 00:31:28,105
All right.

410
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:27,436
Thank you, Lizzy, but I could
really just do this myself.

411
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:29,101
No, it's fine.

412
00:32:29,103 --> 00:32:31,035
I used to clean up sores for
this gun-nut tweaker guy

413
00:32:31,037 --> 00:32:34,236
out in the woods,
so this is nothing.

414
00:32:34,238 --> 00:32:38,002
Sounds like it's a good thing
you're not seeing him anymore.

415
00:32:38,004 --> 00:32:39,968
Oh, we weren't dating.

416
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,403
He was just this guy I was sort
of obsessed with

417
00:32:42,405 --> 00:32:47,139
when I was on lithium,
thorazine, and PCP.

418
00:32:49,304 --> 00:32:51,036
Hey.

419
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:53,135
Thanks for being
such a good sport.

420
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,335
I did not mean at all
for that to happen.

421
00:32:55,337 --> 00:32:58,136
I just never understood
the point of that.

422
00:32:58,138 --> 00:32:59,569
Just silly little metaphors,
you know.

423
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:01,101
Brings the party together.

424
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:03,236
Frankly, it's a little
embarrassing.

425
00:33:03,238 --> 00:33:05,506
All better.

426
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,837
You two have some fun.

427
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:27,369
All right. I'm actually
pretty tired.

428
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:30,405
So I'll see you two
in the morning.

429
00:33:32,171 --> 00:33:34,102
Hey, seriously.

430
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:35,835
Thanks for doing this.

431
00:33:35,837 --> 00:33:38,836
I'm just happy you get to see
how insane it all is.

432
00:33:38,838 --> 00:33:40,902
Yeah, it's pretty weird.

433
00:33:40,904 --> 00:33:45,169
But, uh, I was thinking.
Could we stay for one more day?

434
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:47,101
- You're drunk.
- No.

435
00:33:47,103 --> 00:33:49,302
You are drunk. You smell like
a Long Island Iced Tea.

436
00:33:49,304 --> 00:33:52,236
You're drunk.

437
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,968
Can we just stay through
tomorrow night?

438
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,435
You know, I was talking to Anna.

439
00:33:57,437 --> 00:34:00,535
She said that Hal lets people
take his guns out.

440
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:05,235
We could just kinda...
hang out in the wilderness.

441
00:34:05,237 --> 00:34:07,835
Shoot guns, just you and me,
you know?

442
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,402
Despite all this weirdness, just
kind of enjoy something for once.

443
00:34:10,404 --> 00:34:13,036
I really don't wanna do that.

444
00:34:13,038 --> 00:34:16,502
It doesn't cost anything.

445
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:20,071
All right. I'll let you
stay one more day.

446
00:34:28,103 --> 00:34:30,835
Hey, Tim.

447
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:32,772
What's in there?

448
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:37,105
Brewing equipment.

449
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:46,504
Until the FBI shows up.

450
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,369
Hey, you asleep?

451
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:03,871
Hmm?

452
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,169
I was.

453
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,836
And now all I wanna do
is talk to you.

454
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:14,569
Seriously. Did anything
happen with Anna?

455
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,368
Honestly, no.

456
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,336
Well, she gave me this look
that made me think,

457
00:35:19,338 --> 00:35:22,836
you know, maybe she wanted to
hold hands or something.

458
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:26,105
- Nice.
- Yeah.

459
00:35:33,304 --> 00:35:37,336
Hey, I really think that
you should have this.

460
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:39,935
I really think
it's good for you.

461
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:43,434
But I also think that
you should know

462
00:35:43,436 --> 00:35:45,869
that when you were little,

463
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:49,205
Anna used to, like,
make eyes at you.

464
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,101
Yeah, it's probably because

465
00:35:53,103 --> 00:35:55,868
she's always been
in love with me.

466
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,937
And we were meant to
be together.

467
00:36:02,004 --> 00:36:04,836
Or maybe she's a pedophile.

468
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:06,602
Women can't be
a pedophiles.

469
00:36:06,604 --> 00:36:08,534
- Yes, they can.
- No, they can't.

470
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:10,236
- Yes, they can.
- No, they can't.

471
00:36:10,238 --> 00:36:12,035
Are you, like, redefining
the word pedophile?

472
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:14,937
- In order for a man to have intercourse...
- Go to sleep.

473
00:36:17,504 --> 00:36:19,871
- In order...
- Go to sleep.

474
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:27,069
- Women can't...
- Go to sleep!

Make sure you clean that
before you give it back to Hal.

482
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:52,169
He gets pretty mad if you give
it back dirty.

483
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,602
I can't really imagine
him angry.

484
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,302
I can.

485
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:01,434
So your thing was photography?

486
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:04,337
Nah. I don't really have
a thing yet.

487
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,337
I guess hunting wasn't
your thing either.

488
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,771
I'm just kidding.

00:37:45,403 --> 00:37:48,367

513
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:36,435
Hey, uh, do you have
a minute?

514
00:41:36,437 --> 00:41:39,568
And it was like...

515
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:43,167
something was there.

516
00:41:43,169 --> 00:41:46,501
But-but that I couldn't see.

517
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:50,901
And it left me this...
I think.

518
00:41:50,903 --> 00:41:52,134
Maybe.

519
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:54,935
It's like I said.

520
00:41:54,937 --> 00:41:57,901
You're at an age now where you
can become a part of it.

521
00:41:57,903 --> 00:42:00,101
So it's gonna be
more apparent.

522
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:02,168
Yeah, but you always
speak in metaphors.

523
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:04,235
So you don't trust me?

524
00:42:04,237 --> 00:42:06,002
And you're gonna stand there,
you're gonna tell me

525
00:42:06,004 --> 00:42:09,002
that you have never experienced
anything before?

526
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:12,368
I mean, I remember some things
from when I was a kid,

527
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:15,434
but kids have imaginations,

528
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:20,367
and as a grown man now, I guess
the reason why

529
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:23,935
I sort of dramatically asked you
to come out here

530
00:42:23,937 --> 00:42:26,501
is for you to just tell me,

531
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:30,134
in your own words,

532
00:42:30,136 --> 00:42:33,838
what is it?

533
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:38,302
Who's the leader here, Justin?

534
00:42:38,304 --> 00:42:40,938
Uh, you?

535
00:42:43,837 --> 00:42:45,067
There's never been one.

536
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:47,902
I just talk more.

537
00:42:47,904 --> 00:42:50,968
It's not a very flattering
quality, if you ask me,

538
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:54,435
but one of the things that
I talk a lot about

539
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:57,135
is that I don't have answers.

540
00:42:57,137 --> 00:42:59,901
None of us do.

541
00:42:59,903 --> 00:43:03,935
You wanna know what it is that
runs all this?

542
00:43:03,937 --> 00:43:06,771
You go find it.

543
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:21,201
How is that possible?

544
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:23,935
It's crazy, right?

545
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:27,335
Some kind of atmospheric
mirroring effect.

546
00:43:27,337 --> 00:43:30,502
It's like the Northern Lights.

547
00:43:30,504 --> 00:43:32,502
Anyway, two moons brings
a truth.

548
00:43:32,504 --> 00:43:35,301
Three signifies the ascension.

549
00:43:35,303 --> 00:43:38,135
All right, that just all
sounds like metaphor again.

550
00:43:38,137 --> 00:43:40,001
I know, I know.

551
00:43:40,003 --> 00:43:41,868
You know that physics equation
in my room?

552
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,335
- Yeah.
- That's what it is to me.

553
00:43:45,337 --> 00:43:48,067
And I still haven't
finished that.

554
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:50,335
But what I can tell you,

555
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:53,001
is if you and Aaron,
you stay one more day,

556
00:43:53,003 --> 00:43:55,135
you go fishing in the lake,

557
00:43:55,137 --> 00:43:57,535
and you go out
to this buoy,

558
00:43:57,537 --> 00:44:02,901
you dive straight down and you
grab what you find there.

559
00:44:02,903 --> 00:44:05,001
You're gonna have
your answer.

560
00:44:05,003 --> 00:44:07,001
You know how culty
that sounds, right?

561
00:44:07,003 --> 00:44:10,502
Confirm this thing
for yourself...

562
00:44:10,504 --> 00:44:12,935
and you've gotta admit it.

563
00:44:12,937 --> 00:44:15,435
There it is.

564
00:44:15,437 --> 00:44:17,402
A higher power?

565
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,468
A governing force?
God?

566
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,370
Infinity solved.

567
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:28,134
Now, wouldn't that be
a weight off your shoulders?

568
00:44:28,136 --> 00:44:33,167
And if you like having that
weight gone,

569
00:44:33,169 --> 00:44:37,035
you and Aaron have
a home here.

570
00:44:37,037 --> 00:44:40,971
Even after the third moon.

571
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,267
Aaron, get on up here.

572
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,568
Get on up there!

573
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,168
Get on!
Whoo!

574
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,970
Ow!

575
00:44:58,336 --> 00:45:00,035
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

576
00:45:00,037 --> 00:45:01,235
Here we go.

577
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:19,201
♪ There is a house
in Camp Arcadia ♪

578
00:45:21,036 --> 00:45:24,504
♪ They call
the Rising Sun ♪

579
00:45:26,603 --> 00:45:32,901
♪ My brother was
a photographer ♪

580
00:45:45,436 --> 00:45:48,569
You call that red stuff
"the flower," right?

581
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:51,037
Yeah.

582
00:45:54,436 --> 00:45:57,601
This has been
really good for me.

583
00:45:57,603 --> 00:45:59,936
Well, it's not over yet.

584
00:46:01,337 --> 00:46:03,202
Okay.

585
00:46:03,204 --> 00:46:05,334
So I happen to have
this other talent

586
00:46:05,336 --> 00:46:07,568
that's not making clothes
where I can measure

587
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:11,234
the exact amount of drugs in my
lungs at any given time.

588
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:13,968
If I were to measure out an
exact amount for you

589
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,900
that won't make you feel
weird or sick

590
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:19,101
or paranoid or anything
like that,

591
00:46:19,103 --> 00:46:21,267
would that be something that
you're interested in?

592
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:22,867
Uh...

593
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:24,402
And there's no pressure
at all. I'm not...

594
00:46:24,404 --> 00:46:26,000
No. No, let's do it.

595
00:46:26,002 --> 00:46:28,201
- Really?
- Let's do it. Come on.

596
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:29,569
Come on, before I...

597
00:46:29,571 --> 00:46:32,204
Just follow my lead.
Okay, hold on.

598
00:46:34,537 --> 00:46:35,904
Come here.

599
00:46:58,537 --> 00:47:00,067
How do I know
when I'm high?

600
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:02,601
Come here. Come walk with me.
I'll show you.

601
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:05,100
You know, Tolkien said it,
Lewis said it,

602
00:47:05,102 --> 00:47:07,334
Lovecraft perverted it,

603
00:47:07,336 --> 00:47:11,000
and we just take the definite
face off of it

604
00:47:11,002 --> 00:47:12,967
and we just say, "Hey, here are
the tools,

605
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:15,302
but you make it what you want."

606
00:47:15,304 --> 00:47:16,636
Totally. And the interesting
thing about that is

607
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:20,037
when you look at things like the Hopi...

608
00:47:24,536 --> 00:47:27,201
It's the gun-nut
tweaker guy.

609
00:47:27,203 --> 00:47:30,537
Yeah, that looks like
a gun-nut tweaker.

610
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:09,467
How is that possible?

611
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:13,201
It's like a...
like a heat blur.

612
00:48:13,203 --> 00:48:15,235
You know, it's a natural
illusion.

613
00:48:15,237 --> 00:48:18,268
It has to do with solar winds

614
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:23,035
and magnetic poles and...

615
00:48:23,037 --> 00:48:25,167
Um...

616
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:27,335
No. I have no idea.

617
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,000
Nobody in the camp does,

618
00:48:29,002 --> 00:48:32,068
but they're all around the camp
in a perfect circle.

619
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:34,468
It's why we use a circle emblem.

620
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,168
You usually need the flower to
see it this clearly.

621
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:40,235
Is the reflection solid?
Can you go through it?

622
00:48:40,237 --> 00:48:41,937
Hmm.

623
00:48:44,836 --> 00:48:47,836
This is why you sent me
that video.

624
00:48:49,303 --> 00:48:51,000
What?

625
00:48:51,002 --> 00:48:55,968
The video you sent us talking
about the ascension.

626
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:58,335
No, I didn't.

627
00:48:58,337 --> 00:49:00,302
I mean, yes, I made videos in
case you or my sister

628
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,268
or someone came back to the
camp and we weren't here,

629
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:05,268
but, no, I didn't.

630
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,967
I didn't send that.

631
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:09,034
That's really strange because we
all kind of agreed

632
00:49:09,036 --> 00:49:11,268
that we wouldn't share things
like that,

633
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:14,471
especially after your brother,
you know?

634
00:49:17,003 --> 00:49:18,371
My brother what?

635
00:49:22,836 --> 00:49:25,000
I'm having such a nice time
with you.

636
00:49:25,002 --> 00:49:26,568
I'm so glad you're back.

637
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:28,302
It's just we don't need
to talk about it.

638
00:49:28,304 --> 00:49:29,337
Okay.

639
00:49:48,037 --> 00:49:50,437
Do you hear music?

640
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:02,901
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

641
00:50:02,903 --> 00:50:05,034
Are you all right?

642
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:08,234
I'm fine. I just can't sleep
with everybody up like this.

643
00:50:08,236 --> 00:50:10,435
And I leave these notes
fucking everywhere

644
00:50:10,437 --> 00:50:13,835
saying, please, please, please
shut the hell up!

645
00:50:13,837 --> 00:50:17,601
You, uh...
you don't like the parties?

646
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:21,867
I did for a few nights,
but after a while...

647
00:50:21,869 --> 00:50:23,171
fuck, man!

648
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:27,968
What's your name?

649
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,402
Justin.

650
00:50:29,404 --> 00:50:32,568
I'm Jennifer.

651
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,402
Hey, Jennifer.

652
00:50:34,404 --> 00:50:38,771
So if you don't like it here,
why don't you just leave?

653
00:50:40,535 --> 00:50:43,067
It's a really weird story.

654
00:50:43,069 --> 00:50:45,501
You sure you wanna hear it?

655
00:50:45,503 --> 00:50:48,202
It's possible you're the only
woman here

656
00:50:48,204 --> 00:50:49,600
not taken by several men,

657
00:50:49,602 --> 00:50:53,267
so you'd have to convince
me otherwise.

658
00:50:53,269 --> 00:50:56,533
I'm not hitting on you. That was
mostly me making a joke.

659
00:50:56,535 --> 00:50:59,334
I'm 100 percent married, so...

660
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:01,534
Right.
Very nice to meet you.

661
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:04,367
No, it's fine.
You're...

662
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:06,867
You're all harmless.

663
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:10,000
A little brainwashed
but mostly harmless.

664
00:51:10,002 --> 00:51:12,103
So you're not part
of the camp?

665
00:51:15,303 --> 00:51:19,167
My husband Mike
disappeared near here.

666
00:51:19,169 --> 00:51:22,270
So I came out
looking for him.

667
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,467
He just sort of lost it.

668
00:51:26,469 --> 00:51:30,601
And I wandered until I almost
passed out.

669
00:51:30,603 --> 00:51:33,204
Must have been dehydration
or something.

670
00:51:35,102 --> 00:51:38,302
Hal found me.

671
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:41,368
He said we'd find him.

672
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,771
It'd take some time...

673
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:49,003
but we'd find him.

674
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,201
So how's the search going?

675
00:51:54,203 --> 00:51:56,068
Uh...

676
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:59,568
it's been a few, um...

677
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:03,501
it's been a few...

678
00:52:03,503 --> 00:52:06,467
Our son is with
my parents.

679
00:52:06,469 --> 00:52:08,270
So...

680
00:52:10,203 --> 00:52:12,870
I'm gonna go lay back down.

681
00:52:18,237 --> 00:52:20,271
Nice meeting you.

682
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,070
There's something out here,
isn't there?

683
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:59,370
Yeah.

684
00:53:01,468 --> 00:53:03,235
Yeah, there is.

685
00:53:03,237 --> 00:53:07,068
I saw some things last night
that...

686
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:09,071
I... I can't...

687
00:53:14,036 --> 00:53:17,270
Hey, you're gonna hate this.
Um...

688
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,304
But what if we stayed?

689
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,202
- Like permanently?
- Yeah.

690
00:53:25,204 --> 00:53:27,534
You know, we'd be
taken care of.

691
00:53:27,536 --> 00:53:32,334
Nothing to worry about except
for doing our own thing.

692
00:53:32,336 --> 00:53:34,267
There's kind of an order
to things here, you know?

693
00:53:34,269 --> 00:53:35,601
It's fair.

694
00:53:35,603 --> 00:53:39,470
Like something really is
watching out for us.

695
00:53:42,536 --> 00:53:44,601
I don't know.

696
00:53:44,603 --> 00:53:48,067
I always thought that if I did
experience

697
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:51,035
that there was something more
to all of this,

698
00:53:51,037 --> 00:53:55,304
that I'd like start going to
church or something.

699
00:53:57,002 --> 00:53:59,268
Everybody thinks that.

700
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,837
But last night I was walking
back to the cabin...

701
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:08,970
and there was this girl at one
of the cabins, and she was...

702
00:54:12,036 --> 00:54:13,834
What?

703
00:54:13,836 --> 00:54:17,067
She wasn't all "Kumbaya" like
the rest of the camp.

704
00:54:17,069 --> 00:54:19,567
She was really scared and sad
about something.

705
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:21,301
I don't know, I just...

706
00:54:21,303 --> 00:54:24,401
I don't think comfort
is worth dying for.

707
00:54:24,403 --> 00:54:26,600
Look, man, there is no
mass suicide here.

708
00:54:26,602 --> 00:54:29,400
You're, like, leaping to
conclusions.

709
00:54:29,402 --> 00:54:32,301
We can't go back to our,
like, regular shitty lives

710
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:36,138
knowing that there's actually
something out here.

711
00:54:38,204 --> 00:54:40,501
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

712
00:54:40,503 --> 00:54:45,266
Hal said the answer is at
the bottom of this lake.

713
00:54:45,268 --> 00:54:49,534
So I am going to bottom
of this lake.

714
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,334
Answer to what?

715
00:54:51,336 --> 00:54:54,771
Exactly what "it" is.

716
00:54:56,536 --> 00:54:57,904
Well, that's way culty.

717
00:55:36,902 --> 00:55:38,167
Oh!

718
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:40,167
- Not a god, it's a monster!
- What?

719
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:42,367
There's something down there!
I saw it! It held me down!

720
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:44,501
- What?
- I don't know!

721
00:55:44,503 --> 00:55:46,370
Go!

722
00:56:24,602 --> 00:56:26,201
We're leaving.

723
00:56:26,203 --> 00:56:28,266
- It's a tape.
- I don't care, we're leaving.

724
00:56:28,268 --> 00:56:29,901
Look, man, I know
you've been just...

725
00:56:29,903 --> 00:56:32,366
dying to make something up
and get me out of here.

726
00:56:32,368 --> 00:56:36,067
But I didn't see a monster
or anything.

727
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:38,233
And actually, everything's
fine here.

728
00:56:38,235 --> 00:56:40,202
Fine, you can stay.
I'm leaving.

729
00:56:42,036 --> 00:56:45,233
Look, we both know that's just
not happening, all right?

730
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,867
Look, we'll go back
to the camp.

731
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:49,901
We'll say our good-byes like
we're normal people,

732
00:56:49,903 --> 00:56:51,501
and then we'll go,
all right?

733
00:56:51,503 --> 00:56:53,200
- All right.
- All right. Good.

734
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:54,203
- Great.
- Good!

735
00:56:56,503 --> 00:56:58,867
I wish you guys
could stay longer.

736
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:00,533
Yeah, me, too.

737
00:57:00,535 --> 00:57:03,867
Yeah, really hard to leave,
but we gotta get back to work.

738
00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:06,001
Hey, I drew you
a going-away gift.

739
00:57:06,003 --> 00:57:08,967
Oh. Wow.
Thank you.

740
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:11,366
That's, uh...

741
00:57:11,368 --> 00:57:13,267
that's honest.

742
00:57:13,269 --> 00:57:15,968
Hey.

743
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:18,034
Do you mind if we get
a little...

744
00:57:18,036 --> 00:57:20,234
culty in here?

745
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,133
One last time?

746
00:57:22,135 --> 00:57:25,434
Um... no.

747
00:57:25,436 --> 00:57:27,036
- You sure?
- Yeah.

748
00:57:29,135 --> 00:57:31,366
Everybody...

749
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:34,834
Justin and Aaron found a message
in the lake today.

750
00:57:34,836 --> 00:57:37,534
That's awesome. We haven't had
one of those in a while.

751
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:39,935
Thought we'd have
a viewing ceremony.

752
00:57:39,937 --> 00:57:42,433
- To send 'em off.
- What is it?

753
00:57:42,435 --> 00:57:45,434
It's how to communicate
with us.

754
00:57:45,436 --> 00:57:47,336
With images.

755
00:57:49,236 --> 00:57:51,001
I'm, uh... I'm Michael.

756
00:57:51,003 --> 00:57:53,134
So you guys are, like,
in a church group?

757
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,601
Uh, nice to meet you, Mike.

758
00:57:54,603 --> 00:57:57,099
We're prophets of
the Camp Arcadia faith.

759
00:57:57,101 --> 00:57:59,233
Our whole thing is just making
sure that people know

760
00:57:59,235 --> 00:58:01,501
that self-sacrifice for
the one true god

761
00:58:01,503 --> 00:58:04,234
is the only way to begin the
journey into the cosmos.

762
00:58:04,236 --> 00:58:05,934
Yeah, Justin's
taught me a whole lot

763
00:58:05,936 --> 00:58:07,533
about our coming apocalypse,
so, you know,

764
00:58:07,535 --> 00:58:09,834
if you ever wanna come worship
with us at the camp,

765
00:58:09,836 --> 00:58:11,433
we'd love to have you.

766
00:58:11,435 --> 00:58:13,301
And we also
take small donations.

767
00:58:13,303 --> 00:58:18,234
We're just devoted to...
to... to... to... to...

768
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:27,434
So...

769
00:58:27,436 --> 00:58:31,433
it appears that the message
is forgiveness.

770
00:58:31,435 --> 00:58:35,236
Forgiveness for those lies.

771
00:58:40,336 --> 00:58:43,000
That was embarrassing.

772
00:58:43,002 --> 00:58:47,033
Guys, guys, guys.
Guys, wait up.

773
00:58:47,035 --> 00:58:49,401
I didn't know that's what it
would be.

774
00:58:49,403 --> 00:58:52,534
It's not supposed to be
embarrassing.

775
00:58:52,536 --> 00:58:54,334
It's a lesson.

776
00:58:54,336 --> 00:58:56,033
What does that mean?

777
00:58:56,035 --> 00:58:58,537
Forgiveness.

778
00:59:01,969 --> 00:59:06,500
We forgive you for going out
and evangelizing us

779
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:10,400
as a UFO death cult
or whatever.

780
00:59:10,402 --> 00:59:13,100
Then telling the press,

781
00:59:13,102 --> 00:59:15,871
among other things, that all of
us are castrated.

782
00:59:17,203 --> 00:59:19,200
You are castrated.

783
00:59:19,202 --> 00:59:21,501
As far as I know,

784
00:59:21,503 --> 00:59:24,999
everybody here has
their sex organs.

785
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:27,500
You told me the camp...
they had to do that.

786
00:59:27,502 --> 00:59:29,067
That they sanctioned
all of that.

787
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:31,433
- I never said that.
- Yes, you did! Why...

788
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:33,067
Why did we tell that story?

789
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,533
Why did we go and tell
that story?

790
00:59:34,535 --> 00:59:36,133
I knew there was
something wrong here.

791
00:59:36,135 --> 00:59:38,334
And there is something
very wrong here.

792
00:59:38,336 --> 00:59:39,834
And I did what I had to do
to keep to safe.

793
00:59:39,836 --> 00:59:42,966
- And I'm sorry you're finding out this way...
- You made that all up?

794
00:59:42,968 --> 00:59:46,934
Without trying to throw fuel
on the fire here,

795
00:59:46,936 --> 00:59:51,034
would you say maybe it has something
to do with you wanting to lead?

796
00:59:51,036 --> 00:59:52,501
I'm trying to lead?

797
00:59:52,503 --> 00:59:55,934
Even as a little boy, you were
never comfortable

798
00:59:55,936 --> 00:59:58,537
with there being no leader here
giving definite answers.

799
01:00:00,502 --> 01:00:04,934
Maybe you take crappy pictures
because "it" takes pictures.

800
01:00:04,936 --> 01:00:06,534
Maybe you wanna be "it."

801
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,400
You wanna control, you wanna
be the alpha.

802
01:00:08,402 --> 01:00:09,935
You've led to me
so fucking much.

803
01:00:09,937 --> 01:00:12,035
He lied to you.
Fuck him!

804
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:20,000
I pulled the both of you...

805
01:00:20,002 --> 01:00:23,533
out of your mother's
burning car.

806
01:00:23,535 --> 01:00:28,034
I gave you food,
I gave you shelter,

807
01:00:28,036 --> 01:00:31,203
I gave you every opportunity
to grow.

808
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:35,904
And what you did
to undermine us...

809
01:00:38,136 --> 01:00:40,934
Let's just forget the fact

810
01:00:40,936 --> 01:00:42,400
that we are never
gonna get Dave

811
01:00:42,402 --> 01:00:45,999
to take that damned white
button-up shirt off...

812
01:00:46,001 --> 01:00:49,134
Can you imagine trying to sell
your beer

813
01:00:49,136 --> 01:00:52,434
when someone can find a news
article that makes you look like

814
01:00:52,436 --> 01:00:54,334
a dickless, poison Kool-Aid
drinking,

815
01:00:54,336 --> 01:00:56,201
Heaven's Gate offshoot?

816
01:00:56,203 --> 01:00:58,467
That is our livelihood.

817
01:00:58,469 --> 01:01:01,470
So, no!
Fuck you!

818
01:01:07,837 --> 01:01:11,999
She's up there, terrified,

819
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,034
with some story about
how you're going

820
01:01:15,036 --> 01:01:18,500
to help her find her missing
husband.

821
01:01:18,502 --> 01:01:21,033
What are you doing here, Hal?

822
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:23,035
Walk away, man.

823
01:01:26,001 --> 01:01:28,267
- Come on.
- No.

824
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:29,601
- Let's go.
- No.

825
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:31,537
- Now!
- No!

826
01:01:34,535 --> 01:01:37,033
You are a fucking
cult leader!

827
01:01:37,035 --> 01:01:40,134
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

828
01:01:40,136 --> 01:01:42,970
Or we can go inside and we can
put that to a vote.

829
01:01:44,503 --> 01:01:48,137
But why don't you just make it
easy on everybody.

830
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,999
God damn it, Aaron.

831
01:02:28,102 --> 01:02:29,470
Fuck!

832
01:03:49,168 --> 01:03:52,100
Hey, I'm sorry to come by so late.

833
01:03:52,102 --> 01:03:55,466
I'm, uh, lost and, uh...

834
01:03:57,336 --> 01:04:00,833
Hey, I can hear you
in there.

835
01:04:00,835 --> 01:04:02,233
It's Justin from
ten years ago.

836
01:04:02,235 --> 01:04:04,835
Can you just help me out?

837
01:04:17,403 --> 01:04:20,034
Why are you in my house?!

838
01:04:20,036 --> 01:04:22,466
Why the fuck are you
in my house?!

839
01:04:22,468 --> 01:04:24,401
Uh...

840
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:26,504
God damn it!
Fuck me all to hell!

841
01:04:28,002 --> 01:04:30,366
Just-just sit down
or whatever, all right?

842
01:04:30,368 --> 01:04:34,503
Careful around my bike!
Don't you fucking touch my bike!

843
01:04:40,902 --> 01:04:43,099
So, a decade ago,

844
01:04:43,101 --> 01:04:45,601
I tell you that you're livin'
in some sort of death cult,

845
01:04:45,603 --> 01:04:48,100
and not only were you not bright
enough then to figure it out,

846
01:04:48,102 --> 01:04:50,867
you actually came back.

847
01:04:50,869 --> 01:04:52,366
You are not smart.

848
01:04:52,368 --> 01:04:55,301
You never have been, no.

849
01:04:55,303 --> 01:04:57,234
I mean, all kids are dumb,

850
01:04:57,236 --> 01:05:00,300
but you're like some sort of
retarded hobbit or something.

851
01:05:00,302 --> 01:05:03,233
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

852
01:05:03,235 --> 01:05:05,066
I don't know how
I got lost.

853
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:07,034
I don't know how you're hanging
in there

854
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:08,500
and standing in front of me.

855
01:05:08,502 --> 01:05:10,234
I don't understand what's going
on at that camp.

856
01:05:10,236 --> 01:05:13,066
Bunch of loopin' prisons, man.

857
01:05:13,068 --> 01:05:15,503
Like shitty pods of time.

858
01:05:17,268 --> 01:05:19,100
Repeatin' over and over
and over again

859
01:05:19,102 --> 01:05:22,537
like rats tellin' stories
for that thing's amusement!

860
01:05:26,203 --> 01:05:28,034
My loop's short as hell, bro.

861
01:05:28,036 --> 01:05:29,967
Hell, some are even shorter.

862
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:32,467
Hell, you fools, you fools up at
that hippy-dippy camp bullshit,

863
01:05:32,469 --> 01:05:35,303
you're something like, what,
ten years now?

864
01:05:37,569 --> 01:05:41,099
You gotta kill yourself
before the restart

865
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:43,434
or that thing,
that thing'll do it for ya.

866
01:05:43,436 --> 01:05:46,770
And it's much worse than
anything you can do to yourself.

867
01:05:49,436 --> 01:05:54,166
But the camp prefers that thing
doin' it for 'em, doesn't it?

868
01:05:54,168 --> 01:05:56,302
Yeah, considers it
sacred even.

869
01:06:03,901 --> 01:06:06,869
It'll snatch you
right out of your shoes.

870
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,902
I feel terrible.

871
01:06:19,968 --> 01:06:23,099
I know better than that.

872
01:06:23,101 --> 01:06:26,234
Well, it just sounds like you
lost your temper, that's all.

873
01:06:26,236 --> 01:06:28,036
It happens.

874
01:06:30,235 --> 01:06:31,835
Hal.

875
01:06:40,002 --> 01:06:41,501
Anyone want a beer?

876
01:06:41,503 --> 01:06:44,266
Yeah, thanks.

877
01:06:44,268 --> 01:06:45,269
Okay.

878
01:06:49,568 --> 01:06:52,835
Hey, we all know that
your brother's a good guy.

879
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,834
We all knew about
the cult thing, but...

880
01:06:57,836 --> 01:07:00,033
Whatever.
It's in the past.

881
01:07:00,035 --> 01:07:02,201
You don't think most of us

882
01:07:02,203 --> 01:07:06,166
have something we wish we could
just leave behind?

883
01:07:08,503 --> 01:07:11,301
The rest of it, though,
it just...

884
01:07:11,303 --> 01:07:14,202
You know, this place protects us
from some of it.

885
01:07:16,902 --> 01:07:20,366
But history repeats itself,
regardless.

886
01:07:20,368 --> 01:07:24,366
The old skipping record plays
on, doesn't it?

887
01:07:24,368 --> 01:07:27,336
I'm just grateful I get
to live at all.

888
01:07:35,901 --> 01:07:39,337
Don't do it
if you don't want to.

889
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:49,900
Everything all right?

890
01:07:49,902 --> 01:07:52,166
Yeah.

891
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:55,134
You might not be able to tell
because of that big ol' beard,

892
01:07:55,136 --> 01:07:58,102
but Tim, he just
worries a lot.

893
01:07:59,335 --> 01:08:02,336
Anything I need
to worry about?

894
01:08:09,268 --> 01:08:12,434
Yeah, you get used to it.

895
01:08:12,436 --> 01:08:16,599
Suicide option. Mm.

896
01:08:16,601 --> 01:08:18,499
I ain't no mathematician,

897
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:23,100
but every few hours since '09...
now what is that? Hmm?

898
01:08:23,102 --> 01:08:25,303
Well, it's a fucking lot!

899
01:08:27,368 --> 01:08:30,067
But what you wanna do is,
you wanna get...

900
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:33,599
you wanna get unlost...
and then leave again,

901
01:08:33,601 --> 01:08:36,100
like you're not some Mongoloid
motherfucker, am I right?

902
01:08:36,102 --> 01:08:39,267
'Cause if you let it
have you,

903
01:08:39,269 --> 01:08:42,567
and you're still in the borders
when the loop resets,

904
01:08:42,569 --> 01:08:45,366
you'll be stuck as shit
forever.

905
01:08:45,368 --> 01:08:47,500
Hmm?

906
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:50,466
Now, you should be able to follow
that trail there, shouldn't you?

907
01:08:50,468 --> 01:08:53,600
Everything looked different
all of a sudden, and I...

908
01:08:53,602 --> 01:08:57,099
Yeah, I remember that.
Oh, yeah.

909
01:08:57,101 --> 01:08:59,167
Thing is, you're old
as fuck now.

910
01:08:59,169 --> 01:09:01,900
And more likely just to...
just to toe the line.

911
01:09:01,902 --> 01:09:03,500
You know,
so shit shifts around a bit,

912
01:09:03,502 --> 01:09:06,499
put some confusion in that
little IQ of yours to get ya.

913
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:09,966
I just really got to get back to Camp
Arcadia and get back to my brother.

914
01:09:09,968 --> 01:09:11,499
I can do that for you.

915
01:09:11,501 --> 01:09:13,567
Great. How do I get back?

916
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:15,366
Oh, not for free.

917
01:09:15,368 --> 01:09:16,999
Big 'ol fuck no.

918
01:09:18,868 --> 01:09:20,466
No, you gotta
suck my dick first.

919
01:09:20,468 --> 01:09:22,433
What?

920
01:09:22,435 --> 01:09:26,070
You have to suck
my dick first.

921
01:09:31,136 --> 01:09:33,533
I'm just fuckin' with ya!

922
01:09:33,535 --> 01:09:36,567
Your fuckin' face!
Uh...

923
01:09:39,068 --> 01:09:41,201
No, but seriously,
not for free, no.

924
01:09:41,203 --> 01:09:43,066
All right, look, I don't know
what I can give you,

925
01:09:43,068 --> 01:09:45,400
but I really just gotta get back
and get back to my brother

926
01:09:45,402 --> 01:09:48,036
and drive us outta here
before whatever's about...

927
01:10:14,936 --> 01:10:18,400
We're all stuck in these
fuckin' things, man!

928
01:10:18,402 --> 01:10:21,134
But you're free,
you're free for now.

929
01:10:21,136 --> 01:10:23,833
It'll get you lost, but you
can walk right through 'em

930
01:10:23,835 --> 01:10:26,967
like some brainless dickhole.

931
01:10:26,969 --> 01:10:30,035
And since you wouldn't know a
carburetor from your cock...

932
01:10:32,835 --> 01:10:34,599
I want you to get me a gun.

933
01:10:34,601 --> 01:10:37,133
We have those back at camp.
I could just...

934
01:10:37,135 --> 01:10:39,465
I ain't falling for that, no.

935
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:42,266
Sit down.

936
01:10:42,268 --> 01:10:45,302
All right, now this is our
circle, right here, okay?

937
01:10:46,901 --> 01:10:50,365
And there is this bitch-ass
tweaker, with a grip of guns,

938
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,000
who sold me a broken computer

939
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:54,034
before I was stuck up in this
fuckin' bitch,

940
01:10:54,036 --> 01:10:55,366
and he swore to God he'd make it
up to me.

941
01:10:55,368 --> 01:10:59,867
This is his filthy
fuckin' loop,

942
01:10:59,869 --> 01:11:02,999
and this is his shitty fuckin'
cabin right here, all right?

943
01:11:03,001 --> 01:11:06,134
The gun-nut tweaker?

944
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:07,600
Yeah, the gun-nut tweaker.

945
01:11:07,602 --> 01:11:10,433
You just follow this map

946
01:11:10,435 --> 01:11:14,233
and these loop marker hoodoo
fuckamajigs.

947
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:16,999
All right, and you'll find this
smelly junkie named Chris

948
01:11:17,001 --> 01:11:19,366
who's got a gun collection that'd
give Yosemite Sam a boner.

949
01:11:19,368 --> 01:11:22,567
Now, you bring me back a real
nice one. Okay?

950
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:24,599
And I'll draw you one of these
fancy maps,

951
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:26,366
get you back to your brother.

952
01:11:26,368 --> 01:11:30,066
Oh, and, uh...
use this compass.

953
01:11:30,068 --> 01:11:34,969
And trust only this compass,
not what you see.

954
01:11:37,902 --> 01:11:39,103
All right.

955
01:11:55,969 --> 01:12:00,000
It doesn't let me sleep.

956
01:12:00,002 --> 01:12:01,999
Funny thing is,
I don't get tired.

957
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:04,368
I just...

958
01:12:07,901 --> 01:12:10,401
It doesn't let me dream.

959
01:12:13,969 --> 01:12:17,336
It does that so my mind
never leaves this place.

960
01:12:19,936 --> 01:12:22,035
These three hours...

961
01:12:28,501 --> 01:12:31,536
Using space and time
as its horsewhip.

962
01:12:40,434 --> 01:12:43,233
I'm, uh...

963
01:12:43,235 --> 01:12:45,533
I'm really sorry
to hear that.

964
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:47,433
And I'll, uh...

965
01:12:47,435 --> 01:12:49,870
I'll see you soon.

I have this theory that it's

972
01:14:17,901 --> 01:14:20,300
See, retinas only have three
types of cone cells,

973
01:14:20,302 --> 01:14:22,299
so maybe none has
the signal strength

974
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:25,433
to see it in our normal state.

975
01:14:25,435 --> 01:14:27,232
Just a theory, though.

976
01:14:27,234 --> 01:14:29,132
What we do know is that...

977
01:14:29,134 --> 01:14:32,236
it shows us what it sees.

978
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:36,935
It has a powerful
elegance to it.

979
01:14:39,368 --> 01:14:43,302
So, it was looking at me.

980
01:14:49,435 --> 01:14:52,966
Why did it send me
a picture of a trailer?

981
01:14:52,968 --> 01:14:55,533
Probably where to go.

982
01:14:55,535 --> 01:14:58,365
I was actually gonna go
find Justin.

983
01:14:58,367 --> 01:15:00,235
Well, there you go.

984
01:15:02,435 --> 01:15:04,833
I know that fight was really
hard for all of us last night,

985
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:07,368
but can you help?

986
01:15:09,235 --> 01:15:13,166
I don't know anything anybody
else doesn't know about life.

987
01:15:13,168 --> 01:15:16,400
But last night's got me
thinking.

988
01:15:16,402 --> 01:15:20,000
Can you have power over
yourself,

989
01:15:20,002 --> 01:15:24,465
if you give up any amount of
authority to something else?

990
01:15:24,467 --> 01:15:26,098
I mean...

991
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,599
I really do have to find
Justin...

992
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:30,900
I mean, it's a good question.

993
01:15:30,902 --> 01:15:33,369
Always has been,
always will be.

994
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:38,066
Go out to the route,
past Cabin Two.

995
01:15:38,068 --> 01:15:41,199
When you go past it,
you'll see a small trail.

996
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:43,465
Just follow it for
a really long time.

997
01:15:43,467 --> 01:15:47,066
There's no way I'm not gonna
get lost if I do that.

998
01:15:47,068 --> 01:15:48,933
Can you please just
come with me?

999
01:15:48,935 --> 01:15:52,098
I literally can't go with you
to help you find your brother.

1000
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,934
But you should.

1001
01:15:53,936 --> 01:15:56,998
And I sincerely hope
he's okay.

1002
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,366
I really hope you make
your own choice.

1003
01:16:00,368 --> 01:16:03,302
Before the third moon is full.

1004
01:16:05,202 --> 01:16:06,502

1005
01:16:08,334 --> 01:16:09,970
Hal.

1006
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:14,802
Tell me what that means.

1007
01:16:20,067 --> 01:16:21,599
Saying more would be like

1008
01:16:21,601 --> 01:16:24,936

1014
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:04,400
Carl sent me.

1015
01:19:04,402 --> 01:19:06,166
Who?

1016
01:19:06,168 --> 01:19:08,200
Carl. He, uh...

1017
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:10,770
Can you just open
the fucking door?!

1018
01:19:20,868 --> 01:19:25,102
Uh, Carl sent me
and, uh...

1019
01:19:26,901 --> 01:19:28,199
- What?
- Are you all right?

1020
01:19:28,201 --> 01:19:31,066
Oh, this?
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

1021
01:19:31,068 --> 01:19:33,166
It's not what it looks like.
Mike's trying to help me out.

1022
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:34,500
He's my buddy.

1023
01:19:34,502 --> 01:19:37,933
Trying to, uh, you know,
get me clean and sober!

1024
01:19:37,935 --> 01:19:40,400
Okay.
Um... so...

1025
01:19:40,402 --> 01:19:41,933
Don't be weird, dude.
Come on in.

1026
01:19:41,935 --> 01:19:43,503
Please.

1027
01:19:46,435 --> 01:19:48,232
- What's your name?
- Justin.

1028
01:19:48,234 --> 01:19:49,499
Let me stop you
right there, okay?

1029
01:19:49,501 --> 01:19:51,265
Can I ask you a question?
Cool.

1030
01:19:51,267 --> 01:19:53,865
Do you have any drugs or crack
at all on you?

1031
01:19:53,867 --> 01:19:56,032
- What?
- Like drugs, in your pocket, right now, on you.

1032
01:19:56,034 --> 01:19:58,199
Do you wanna share them with me?
I'd love to share them with you.

1033
01:19:58,201 --> 01:20:01,301
But we have to do it fast, because
Mike's... Aah, there he is.

1034
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:08,065
Mike, right?

1035
01:20:08,067 --> 01:20:09,599
Yeah.

1036
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:11,932
Do you remember me from...

1037
01:20:11,934 --> 01:20:13,933
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1038
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:16,998
No, no, we're not interested
in your religion.

1039
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,133
And just so you know,
Chris is my best friend,

1040
01:20:19,135 --> 01:20:21,533
he's a drug addict, I'm just
trying to get him clean.

1041
01:20:21,535 --> 01:20:23,133
There's nothing weird
going on.

1042
01:20:23,135 --> 01:20:25,132
Hey, I found this
hard drive.

1043
01:20:25,134 --> 01:20:26,466
I think it might have
the answer.

1044
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:28,133
You hear that?
Mike found another message

1045
01:20:28,135 --> 01:20:30,099
on a shitty hard drive.

1046
01:20:30,101 --> 01:20:31,532
And it's great
to have company.

1047
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:35,832
Hey, Mike, why don't you get
our guest a chair?

1048
01:20:35,834 --> 01:20:38,499
Okay, so what can we do
for you, sir?

1049
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:43,533
Basically, Carl said that you
could give him a gun.

1050
01:20:43,535 --> 01:20:45,166
Oh.

1051
01:20:45,168 --> 01:20:47,066
You told Shitty Carl you'd
give him a gun?

1052
01:20:47,068 --> 01:20:49,532
Yeah. I told you about that
a year ago.

1053
01:20:49,534 --> 01:20:51,133
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

1054
01:20:51,135 --> 01:20:52,432
Me and Shitty Carl
are shooting buddies.

1055
01:20:52,434 --> 01:20:55,032
The two of you smoked crack
together

1056
01:20:55,034 --> 01:20:56,733
and then would steal
the red buckets

1057
01:20:56,735 --> 01:21:00,365
- from the Salvation Army guys outside of grocery stores.
- Why is that even relevant?

1058
01:21:00,367 --> 01:21:03,133
You have horrible judgment
in other people.

1059
01:21:03,135 --> 01:21:06,199
Shh.
Shh. Shh, shh.

1060
01:21:19,901 --> 01:21:22,465
Can we try it another way?

1061
01:21:22,467 --> 01:21:24,600
Please! Please!

1062
01:21:36,602 --> 01:21:40,034
I guess that didn't work.

1063
01:21:41,301 --> 01:21:42,533
What was that?

1064
01:21:42,535 --> 01:21:45,865
It was either our past
or our future.

1065
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:47,965
Doesn't really make
any difference.

1066
01:21:47,967 --> 01:21:49,833
Practically the same thing.

1067
01:21:49,835 --> 01:21:52,265
See, we've been stuck in this
infinite loop,

1068
01:21:52,267 --> 01:21:54,466
and we've been trying to do
different things to get out of it,

1069
01:21:54,468 --> 01:21:56,965
and I guess that didn't
work.

1070
01:21:56,967 --> 01:22:00,300
Oh, my God, if I have
to listen to you say

1071
01:22:00,302 --> 01:22:04,399
one more time at the beginning,
"Holy shit, man! Fucking Mike!

1072
01:22:04,401 --> 01:22:05,832
How the fuck are you, man?"

1073
01:22:05,834 --> 01:22:07,266
I think I might blow
my brains out.

1074
01:22:07,268 --> 01:22:09,199
What? What is that?
What accent is that?

1075
01:22:09,201 --> 01:22:10,866
Is that Irish?

1076
01:22:10,868 --> 01:22:13,233
That's how you sound.
It's what you sound like.

1077
01:22:13,235 --> 01:22:15,232
What about you?
At the beginning of the thing?

1078
01:22:15,234 --> 01:22:18,132
You come to the woods with your
hair combed full of gel,

1079
01:22:18,134 --> 01:22:24,133
all hunched over like some kind
of James Bond with scoliosis

1080
01:22:24,135 --> 01:22:26,935
trying to hide a boner.

1081
01:22:28,467 --> 01:22:31,801
Hey, can I impart some wisdom
upon you?

1082
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:39,566
Don't ever give in.
Not once.

1083
01:22:39,568 --> 01:22:41,866
The trick to this whole thing

1084
01:22:41,868 --> 01:22:45,199
is to not be afraid of
something that's...

1085
01:22:45,201 --> 01:22:46,965
that's horrifying.

1086
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:49,199
And everyone's afraid of it.

1087
01:22:49,201 --> 01:22:52,466
But if you let it control you
one time,

1088
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:55,332
it's gonna fucking control you
over and over again.

1089
01:22:55,334 --> 01:22:57,166
I mean, look at me and Mike.

1090
01:22:57,168 --> 01:23:00,066
We're just a couple of assholes
taking someone else's shit.

1091
01:23:00,068 --> 01:23:03,332
You gotta floor it
the fuck out of here.

1092
01:23:03,334 --> 01:23:07,265
And if you see that thing,
you don't apologize to it,

1093
01:23:07,267 --> 01:23:11,933
you don't bow down to it,
you don't conform,

1094
01:23:11,935 --> 01:23:14,599
you just fucking run.

1095
01:23:14,601 --> 01:23:16,866
Like your life fucking depends
on it, man,

1096
01:23:16,868 --> 01:23:20,866
because your fucking life
depends on it.

1097
01:23:20,868 --> 01:23:24,400
All right? That's my advice
to you.

1098
01:23:24,402 --> 01:23:26,902
I wish you safe passage.

1099
01:23:28,468 --> 01:23:30,002
Cheers.

1100
01:23:33,201 --> 01:23:36,200
You ready?
You wanna try it?

1101
01:23:36,202 --> 01:23:38,599
Yeah. Let's do it.

1102
01:23:38,601 --> 01:23:42,302
Follow me.
I'll show you the guns.

Aah!

1119
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,401
Oh! Aah!

1120
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,599
You know, it is so strange
seeing how close

1121
01:25:30,601 --> 01:25:35,432
another loop is to this one,
closed, shitty little area.

1122
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:39,499
How long have you been
stuck in this loop?

1123
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:42,266
Well, that's hard to tell.
I mean, when we first got here,

1124
01:25:42,268 --> 01:25:45,566
I said if I got Chris clean
in a week, we'd leave,

1125
01:25:45,568 --> 01:25:48,898
and that was, um...

1126
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,464
that was a lot of weeks ago.

1127
01:25:50,466 --> 01:25:53,300
Yeah, I keep thinking there's
like this configuration

1128
01:25:53,302 --> 01:25:55,200
that's gonna break us out
of the story, you know,

1129
01:25:55,202 --> 01:25:57,099
like a "Life Rubik's Cube."

1130
01:25:57,101 --> 01:25:59,066
The one thing I do know for
certain

1131
01:25:59,068 --> 01:26:01,898
is I would rather
reset things on my terms

1132
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,434
than allow that fucker
to do it for me.

1133
01:26:06,967 --> 01:26:10,099
Well, what's the first thing you're
gonna do when you get out of here?

1134
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:12,168
See my wife Jenn
and our baby.

1135
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:15,832
You know, it's funny,
she used to leave these

1136
01:26:15,834 --> 01:26:18,266
annoying little notes around
the house.

1137
01:26:18,268 --> 01:26:21,932
You know, used to really get
under my skin.

1138
01:26:21,934 --> 01:26:26,001
Man, what I wouldn't give to
wake up to one of those notes.

1139
01:26:28,868 --> 01:26:33,065
I just hope she's happy
and moved on.

1140
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:35,865
You know, it's funny,
we never, uh...

1141
01:26:35,867 --> 01:26:38,464
we never anticipate the ways
we're gonna isolate ourselves

1142
01:26:38,466 --> 01:26:41,199
from the ones we care about.

1143
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:45,266
Anyway, I hope you find your
brother, you know.

1144
01:26:45,268 --> 01:26:48,468
Good luck, and don't get stuck.

1145
01:26:56,367 --> 01:26:58,269
Hey, Mike?

1146
01:27:00,267 --> 01:27:01,902
I'm...

1147
01:27:04,367 --> 01:27:07,468
I really hope
you get out here.

1148
01:27:49,001 --> 01:27:51,535
Because fuck you.

1149
01:28:49,267 --> 01:28:50,899
Chris, it's Mike!

1150
01:28:50,901 --> 01:28:52,932
Your best friend!

1151
01:28:52,934 --> 01:28:55,432
Don't shoot!

1152
01:28:55,434 --> 01:28:58,498
Holy shit, man!
Fucking Mike!

1153
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,099
How the fuck are you, man?!

1154
01:29:00,101 --> 01:29:03,364
Uh, I'm good, man,
I'm good. How are you?

1155
01:29:03,366 --> 01:29:05,933
Fucking fantastic, man!
I'm livin' the dream!

1156
01:29:05,935 --> 01:29:07,332
Isn't this place the tits?

1157
01:29:07,334 --> 01:29:11,136
Yeah.
It's something else.

1158
01:30:16,234 --> 01:30:18,835
Justin!

1159
01:30:20,234 --> 01:30:21,933
I've been looking for you
all day.

1160
01:30:21,935 --> 01:30:23,198
Jesus. You scared the shit
out of me.

1161
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,398
Why'd you do that?

1162
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,199
Why did you just
take off like that?

1163
01:30:26,201 --> 01:30:28,599
I didn't just take off,
I was asked to leave.

1164
01:30:28,601 --> 01:30:30,869
I thought you'd got
eaten by a bear.

1165
01:30:32,467 --> 01:30:34,398
Now I'm lost.
Are you lost?

1166
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,966
Yeah, I'm lost. Because you
left the dome light on again

1167
01:30:36,968 --> 01:30:38,532
and didn't get a new car
battery.

1168
01:30:38,534 --> 01:30:40,565
- Doesn't make any sense.
- You don't make any sense.

1169
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:42,431
- Are you gonna apologize?
- Hurry up.

1170
01:30:42,433 --> 01:30:44,432
We're gonna have to push start
the car to get out in time

1171
01:30:44,434 --> 01:30:46,468
and you're not very strong.

1172
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:49,332
Hello?

1173
01:30:49,334 --> 01:30:53,167
We're, uh...
lost.

1174
01:31:02,001 --> 01:31:04,565
Ah, the flower.

1175
01:31:04,567 --> 01:31:07,132
It's actually a flower.

1176
01:31:07,134 --> 01:31:09,033
That's unexpected, right?

1177
01:31:09,035 --> 01:31:10,432
No. Can we go?

1178
01:31:10,434 --> 01:31:13,065
Yeah, there's no one here.

1179
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:14,965
I think I can figure it out
with a compass.

1180
01:31:14,967 --> 01:31:17,001
It'll just take forever.

1181
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:27,335
It'll just take forever.

1182
01:31:34,401 --> 01:31:36,869
It'll just take forever.

1183
01:32:09,367 --> 01:32:11,098
So, Anna...

1184
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:15,332
Yeah.
Yeah, we slept together.

1185
01:32:15,334 --> 01:32:17,933
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1186
01:32:17,935 --> 01:32:20,498
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

1187
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,566
I've never done that.

1188
01:32:22,568 --> 01:32:24,498
Yeah, we went to bed around
midnight,

1189
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,566
and had a really good night's
sleep

1190
01:32:26,568 --> 01:32:29,498
and then when I woke up, I saw
you were still gone

1191
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:32,934
so I came to rescue you.
You're welcome.

1192
01:32:34,434 --> 01:32:36,565
You mean you literally just
slept together?

1193
01:32:36,567 --> 01:32:39,531
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- I know that's what you said,

1194
01:32:39,533 --> 01:32:41,532
but usually when people say they
slept together,

1195
01:32:41,534 --> 01:32:43,432
it means that they had sex.

1196
01:32:43,434 --> 01:32:45,833
Pretty sure the word "sleep"
means when you close your eyes,

1197
01:32:45,835 --> 01:32:47,364
get comfortable, become
unconscious...

1198
01:32:47,366 --> 01:32:48,933
Never mind. Never mind.

1199
01:32:48,935 --> 01:32:51,435
God, I feel like I'm gonna die
of thirst.

1200
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:55,168
You all right?

1201
01:33:04,166 --> 01:33:06,964
Not much left.
You don't need it?

1202
01:33:06,966 --> 01:33:10,368
No, Aaron,
I don't need water.

1203
01:34:42,999 --> 01:34:45,132
All right.
Now, if we hurry,

1204
01:34:45,134 --> 01:34:49,335
we might make it back to camp
before the third moon.

1205
01:34:54,166 --> 01:34:56,267
Come on, let's go.

1206
01:34:59,067 --> 01:35:01,064
I gotta talk to you
about something.

1207
01:35:01,066 --> 01:35:03,065
Great. Tell me on the way
back to the car.

1208
01:35:03,067 --> 01:35:05,165
No, man.

1209
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:07,801
Can you just have a seat
for a second?

1210
01:35:19,167 --> 01:35:20,502
I'm staying.

1211
01:35:25,134 --> 01:35:27,198
You can stay, too.

1212
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,199
I know you're not going to,
but, you know...

1213
01:35:29,201 --> 01:35:30,931
you can.

1214
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:35,231
You wanna die over
and over and over

1215
01:35:35,233 --> 01:35:38,098
and live your life on repeat
from here to eternity?

1216
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,898
You act like it's crazy,

1217
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,431
like I'm the first person
in history

1218
01:35:41,433 --> 01:35:43,965
that actually wants to
live forever.

1219
01:35:43,967 --> 01:35:47,964
With people that like him.

1220
01:35:47,966 --> 01:35:50,331
You know, there's not much
difference between

1221
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:54,431
being stuck in a loop and being
stuck repeating

1222
01:35:54,433 --> 01:35:59,897
the same shitty day over and
over like back home until I die.

1223
01:35:59,899 --> 01:36:02,532
But back home,
anything could happen.

1224
01:36:02,534 --> 01:36:04,598
It could be so much better
than the camp.

1225
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,965
We tried that, man.

1226
01:36:07,967 --> 01:36:09,398
For almost a decade.

1227
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:12,900
And I'm ready to go back to not
hating my life.

1228
01:36:15,067 --> 01:36:18,301
Dying just takes a second.

1229
01:36:20,099 --> 01:36:22,531
And a shitty life is long.

1230
01:36:22,533 --> 01:36:28,531
Aaron, I think you are making
a very, very big decision

1231
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:31,165
with very little thought.

1232
01:36:31,167 --> 01:36:35,368
And you realize that you do this
once and you can never leave?

1233
01:36:41,033 --> 01:36:46,767
Anything is better than
the life you make me live.

1234
01:36:51,433 --> 01:36:55,265
All right.
Um...

1235
01:36:55,267 --> 01:36:57,831
Let's, uh...

1236
01:36:57,833 --> 01:37:00,034
let's get you back.

1237
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:36,801
Aah!

1238
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,033
God damn it!

1239
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:09,967
Seriously, what do you
think it hit?

1240
01:40:36,367 --> 01:40:39,864
No. Wait! Wait!

1241
01:40:39,866 --> 01:40:42,033
Shit!

1242
01:41:21,133 --> 01:41:23,933
They're coming back.

1243
01:41:55,466 --> 01:41:59,065
I'll feel guilty the rest of my
life if I leave you here,

1244
01:41:59,067 --> 01:42:03,534
so I guess I'm staying, too.

1245
01:42:07,834 --> 01:42:12,335
You're respecting my decision
to stay?

1246
01:42:14,499 --> 01:42:19,264
Uh, I guess.

1247
01:42:19,266 --> 01:42:22,364
If that's the way you wanna
think about it, yeah, sure,

1248
01:42:22,366 --> 01:42:24,234
I'm doing that.

1249
01:42:33,201 --> 01:42:35,398
All right. Let's go.

1250
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:36,564
What?

1251
01:42:36,566 --> 01:42:38,565
All I ever wanted was...

1252
01:42:48,067 --> 01:42:50,165
Let's go!

1253
01:42:50,167 --> 01:42:52,365
- Please start! Please start!
- Let's go!

1254
01:42:57,067 --> 01:42:58,464
All right, when you get
enough speed,

1255
01:42:58,466 --> 01:43:01,364
I'm gonna jump in.
Then you jump in.

1256
01:43:01,366 --> 01:43:04,232
And then I'm gonna throw it in
first and let the clutch go.

1257
01:43:04,234 --> 01:43:05,498
I know how to
push-start a car!

1258
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,430
I'm just saying
what we're doing!

1259
01:43:07,432 --> 01:43:08,831
- Let me drive.
- What?

1260
01:43:08,833 --> 01:43:10,463
Let me drive the car!

1261
01:43:10,465 --> 01:43:12,299
Just let me get it started
first!

1262
01:43:12,301 --> 01:43:14,097
Uhh! Fuck!

1263
01:43:14,099 --> 01:43:15,832
Okay, you drive the fucking car!

1264
01:43:15,834 --> 01:43:17,968
Yeah, I'm gonna drive
the fucking car!

1265
01:43:21,066 --> 01:43:23,431
Hey, listen, man...

1266
01:43:23,433 --> 01:43:28,201
'Cause we're about to die, I
really think you should know...

1267
01:43:29,934 --> 01:43:33,231
you mess up everything.

1268
01:43:33,233 --> 01:43:34,564
You really do.

1269
01:43:34,566 --> 01:43:36,463
I never say it,

1270
01:43:36,465 --> 01:43:38,265
but you have just completely
messed up our lives.

1271
01:43:39,867 --> 01:43:41,132
Aah!

1272
01:43:42,533 --> 01:43:45,065
But you're family.

1273
01:43:45,067 --> 01:43:47,265
That's what family does.

1274
01:43:47,267 --> 01:43:50,965
All I've ever wanted is just to
be able to mess up with you.

1275
01:43:50,967 --> 01:43:54,466
To be able to mess up our
lives just as much as you do.

1276
01:43:58,234 --> 01:44:01,564
All right, listen, on
tombstones it says like

1277
01:44:01,566 --> 01:44:04,864
"Beloved Mother"
or "Beloved Brother",

1278
01:44:04,866 --> 01:44:06,364
not "Beloved Camp Member".

1279
01:44:06,366 --> 01:44:09,965
And there's a reason for that,
all right?

1280
01:44:09,967 --> 01:44:12,265
From here on out,
we're equals.

1281
01:44:12,267 --> 01:44:14,032
I hear you.

1282
01:44:14,034 --> 01:44:15,932
You're my brother.
And I love you.

1283
01:44:15,934 --> 01:44:17,564
- I love you, too.
- And I need you to start this car

1284
01:44:17,566 --> 01:44:20,098
because I don't want you to die
or me to die, okay?

1285
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:21,164
- Get in!
- All right!

1286
01:45:44,332 --> 01:45:45,397
- We made it!
- We made it!

1287
01:45:45,399 --> 01:45:47,898
- We did it!
- Yes!

1288
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:50,132
Yeah!

1289
01:46:27,165 --> 01:46:30,097
We need gas.

1290
01:46:30,099 --> 01:46:32,163
No, we're good.

1291
01:46:32,165 --> 01:46:34,597
No, it's on empty.

1292
01:46:34,599 --> 01:46:37,197
- It's always like that.
- Always on empty?

1293
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:38,897
Empty means there's no fuel
in the tank.

1294
01:46:38,899 --> 01:46:40,767
We couldn't even...

1295
01:46:48,899 --> 01:46:51,300
You figure it out.
