1
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:29,397
- Hi.
- Hi.

2
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:33,500
- Pluto.
- Jellyfish.

3
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,298
Did you find the place okay?

4
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:39,841
Yeah.

5
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:42,643
Good.

6
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:51,177
You look better than I thought.

7
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,889
Really?

8
00:01:57,314 --> 00:01:58,793
Yeah.

9
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:02,530
Your emails are just so depressing.

10
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:06,990
My emails were depressing?

11
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:08,536
Yeah.

12
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:13,737
Well, looks like the rain stopped.

13
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:17,267
It should be a nice, sunny day.

14
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:19,940
I don't like the sun.

15
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:24,953
Yeah, me neither.

16
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:29,290
You've brought your computer.

17
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:31,223
- That's good.
- Yeah.

18
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:33,625
- Let me just take that.
- What do you want it for?

19
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:35,960
I just wanna be able
to get rid of the evidence.

20
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:39,592
I don't... I don't want
any record of our correspondence.

21
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't want everyone
getting all depressed

22
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:44,005
over me being...

23
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:45,665
you know, me being dead.

24
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:48,108
Tell me about it.

25
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:53,247
Wanna go?

26
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:54,441
Okay.

27
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:19,593
- I fucking hate Messiah.
- Well...

28
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:22,136
- I hope he dies.
- Me too.

29
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:24,297
He's, like, one of those saviors,
you know.

30
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:28,275
He's trying to...
trying to save the world,

31
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:30,834
stop everyone
from hurting themselves

32
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:34,178
or committing suicide.
I hate those people.

33
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:36,649
He should just
mind his own business.

34
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:39,312
There are people who want to be saved
by people like him though...

35
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:42,585
people who leave
all these comments,

36
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:45,889
people like Nursery.

37
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:47,223
Nursery.

38
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:49,457
She's pretty, huh?

39
00:04:50,787 --> 00:04:52,061
Yeah, she's pretty.

40
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:56,932
Who do you like on that site?

41
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:00,435
I like you.

42
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:04,604
Who do you hate?

43
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:07,907
Needle and Grimalkin.

44
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:12,049
They're both me.

45
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,856
Are you schizophrenic?

46
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:17,892
Maybe.

47
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:20,551
I get that a lot.

48
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:24,428
There's a little store up here.

49
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:27,127
I'm gonna stop,
grab a couple of things.

50
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,670
It's the last one for a while, so...

51
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:31,763
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

52
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:51,748
10% off next time.

53
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:55,458
Thanks.

54
00:05:55,518 --> 00:05:56,758
Have a nice day.

55
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:11,735
Here.

56
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:17,718
Sorry, I...

57
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:19,845
I bought a bunch of stuff.

58
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:23,448
Oh, that's...

59
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,925
that's okay.
We'll just have a party.

60
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:30,430
I'm sure that
that $10 wasn't enough.

61
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:31,625
It's fine.

62
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:34,100
I added my own money.

63
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:39,030
I don't mind giving you some more.

64
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:41,439
I guess I don't need it anymore.

65
00:06:41,498 --> 00:06:42,636
Right?

66
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:47,674
Right.

67
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:53,621
Let's go.

68
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:03,131
So...

69
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:05,860
have you thought about
how we're gonna die?

70
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,961
Yeah. I mean, some.

71
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:14,668
Some, I guess.
How about you?

72
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:19,270
I don't want it to hurt too much.

73
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:23,213
I'm kind of scared of guns.

74
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:25,685
I don't wanna jump off
something high either.

75
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:27,688
I mean,

76
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:29,690
I'm sure it feels great
when you're falling,

77
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:33,353
but it probably hurts when you land.

78
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,322
I definitely don't want
my head smashed in.

79
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:42,069
I mean,

80
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,765
can you imagine

81
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:47,399
if at that last moment?

82
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:51,071
You're like, "Damn, my face,"

83
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:54,343
and that was your last thought?

84
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:56,384
That'd be the worst.

85
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:01,781
So you don't want it to be messy.

86
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:06,194
I'd say so.

87
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:10,524
What about you?

88
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:13,659
I just want it to be over.

89
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:16,431
This is the worst muffin
I've ever had in my life.

90
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:21,338
I can't just end it

91
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:23,378
like this.

92
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:32,280
There's a Thai place up the road.

93
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:34,788
Were you holding out on me?

94
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:36,949
No, I wasn't holding out on you.

95
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:39,425
I just...

96
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:41,462
I didn't think you'd be hungry.

97
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,055
I can't just...

98
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:48,096
end it with a shitty old muffin.

99
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:02,943
This is it.

100
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,119
So we should probably
just get it to go, right?

101
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:08,656
What?

102
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:13,026
I just...
I don't want anyone to see us.

103
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:16,795
No, let's eat in.

104
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:21,261
I don't think that's a good idea.

105
00:09:21,324 --> 00:09:24,134
You're being paranoid

106
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:26,640
No one's gonna be looking at us.

107
00:09:28,998 --> 00:09:31,035
- Let's eat in.
- No. Listen.

108
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:34,275
Yes, I just... I really don't want
anyone to see us, okay?

109
00:09:34,337 --> 00:09:36,283
Is that okay?

110
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:39,582
When we die,
none of it's gonna matter anyway.

111
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:41,849
Look, I just...

112
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:44,482
you know what? I don't even know why
we're going in here in the first place.

113
00:09:44,547 --> 00:09:46,117
I think we should
just be going. I think...

114
00:09:46,182 --> 00:09:48,423
I don't want anyone to see us.
I just wanna go.

115
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:50,692
- Takeout... take...
- I just want... I just wanna go.

116
00:09:50,753 --> 00:09:53,461
Takeout will be fine.
What do you want?

117
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:01,208
Come on.

118
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:03,938
I'm not going in.
I don't want anyone to see us.

119
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:10,878
I'm gonna go in.
I wanna eat in.

120
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,614
Well, you know what? Then why
don't you just jump off a bridge?

121
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:03,604
I got this for you.

122
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:14,940
He wanted to come with us.

123
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,591
You don't wanna stop, do you?

124
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,270
Dying?

125
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,540
I just...

126
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:42,975
I wanted my last day to be perfect.

127
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:48,842
But this sucks.

128
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:54,819
I failed.

129
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:57,414
No, you didn't fail.

130
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:01,262
You didn't fail.

131
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:07,758
Mm.

132
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:17,878
It's not so bad.

133
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:22,275
Try it.

134
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:42,336
It's a car accident.

135
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,706
I have an idea.
You wanna give it a shot?

136
00:12:47,764 --> 00:12:49,368
What?

137
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:51,412
I have an idea.

138
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:55,249
What?

139
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:57,842
What if we drained our blood?

140
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,945
You mean like slit our wrists?

141
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,489
- No.
- I don't want a bloodbath.

142
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:04,115
No, no, no.
It's not like that.

143
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,126
We just use a syringe?

144
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:08,628
And you just drain the blood
out of yourself.

145
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:10,961
It's a really quick
and easy way to die.

146
00:13:18,494 --> 00:13:21,270
I don't love pain.

147
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:24,571
Don't worry.
There won't be any pain.

148
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:29,540
You know, there's actually
a warehouse just up here.

149
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:31,107
I think we could...

150
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:33,211
we could probably do it there.

151
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:38,558
What do you think?

152
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:41,493
I mean, either way.
Just an idea.

153
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:45,923
Cops.

154
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:50,098
Must be an accident.

155
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,032
The horses have escaped.

156
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:11,753
And don't worry.
It doesn't hurt.

157
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:16,030
Apparently it's totally painless.

158
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:31,601
When I was young,
I wanted to be Cinderella.

159
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:35,182
A prince would come
with a glass slipper

160
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:38,344
and slip it on my feet
and take me away.

161
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:41,685
Mickey Mouse was actually a rabbit.

162
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:43,917
- Bullshit.
- It's true.

163
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,789
- Really?
- Yeah.

164
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:49,162
Here.

165
00:14:58,795 --> 00:15:01,139
You should take these.

166
00:15:02,665 --> 00:15:04,269
Sleeping pills.

167
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,313
Oh, it's okay.
I brought my own.

168
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:09,145
No, these are the ones though
that you really wanna take.

169
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:11,344
Okay.

170
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:13,819
I'll get you some water.

171
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:19,855
- Here.
- What about you?

172
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,920
Yeah, I... I'm just gonna...

173
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:24,931
I'll drain your blood.

174
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:28,662
And once that's finished,
I'll finish myself off.

175
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:33,706
It's 'cause I know
how to use the instruments.

176
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:36,004
It's just easier that way, I guess.

177
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,703
Okay.

178
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:45,747
I'll get set up.

179
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:47,981
You mind if I go pee?

180
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:04,168
I'm just gonna go over here.

181
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:07,736
Okay.

182
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,029
I'm gonna take
your boots off, okay?

183
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:18,310
You ready?

184
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:21,515
Okay.

186
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:19,539
This is an old shipyard, yeah?

187
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:20,938
Yeah.

188
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:23,408
I guess there's no way
to properly lock this place up.

189
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:26,742
Sure, but, you know,
you can get in anywhere, so...

190
00:23:26,802 --> 00:23:29,339
Right.

191
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:32,477
How long would you say it's been
since this freezer's been moved?

192
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,283
Uh, I don't remember.
Maybe two years.

193
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:41,327
Stop. Stop.

194
00:23:47,723 --> 00:23:49,669
So...

195
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:53,138
have you ever been
jealous of a butterfly?

196
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:55,175
Sure, you guys are young.
You're very young,

197
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,040
so you don't think about it,
but in general human beings...

198
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,637
we live;
we grow up; we die.

199
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:02,478
That's it.

200
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:05,451
But what if,
when we got older,

201
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:09,353
we could form
a chrysalis?

202
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:12,221
Burst out of it, you know.
All of a sudden we've got wings.

203
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:15,160
We're flying around.
We can stay up all night,

204
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:18,255
eat whatever we want,
have all the sex we want.

205
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,164
Sounds like a good life, right?

206
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:22,702
Butterfly is better.

207
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:25,967
You're right, Brian.
That's a good answer.

208
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:29,566
So today we're talking
about the mechanism behind molting,

209
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:32,612
so essentially why animals molt.

210
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:38,307
- Holy shit.
- What the f...?

211
00:24:38,374 --> 00:24:40,320
What are you doing?

212
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:43,482
Ma'am, is everything okay?

213
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:48,695
What's your name?

214
00:24:59,528 --> 00:25:00,871
Who is she?

215
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:03,967
Her name's Helga.
Her son's a high school teacher.

216
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:05,808
Where's he?

217
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:07,905
I guess he would be
working right now.

218
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:24,890
So you're a high school teacher?

219
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:27,991
Uh, yeah.
A biology teacher.

220
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:30,697
All right, thanks, Scott.
We'll take it from here.

221
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:35,166
Look, sir, what have you been
doing with this woman?

222
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,437
- Are you imprisoning her?
- Imprisoning her?

223
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:39,843
No, no, no. I'm just making sure she
can't get out of her room, that's it.

224
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:41,848
That's what imprisoning is,
Mr. Williams.

225
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:45,283
You're holding her against her will.
And what's with those balloons?

226
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,320
She has Alzheimer's.

227
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:58,197
My mother's a wanderer.

228
00:25:58,253 --> 00:26:00,563
She could get into trouble.
She could hurt herself.

229
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:03,603
I'm sorry, but that doesn't justify
keeping her bound all day.

230
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,605
So what would you
suggest I do?

231
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:07,470
I mean, stay home
with her all day? Quit my job?

232
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:09,202
- I don't understand.
- No.

233
00:26:09,264 --> 00:26:11,642
Just... would you try it on?

234
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,646
Try it on.
I'll show you how it works.

235
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:16,012
That's why I built her this...
so I could take care of her.

236
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:18,677
All right? Here, come here.
Just take your jacket off.

237
00:26:24,313 --> 00:26:26,293
And there.

238
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:32,490
Huh.

239
00:26:32,554 --> 00:26:34,056
Yeah, right?

240
00:26:34,123 --> 00:26:36,967
Yeah, I see what you're saying.
It's kind of a...

241
00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:38,368
it's not bad actually.

242
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:41,407
You see how easy it is...
I mean,

243
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:44,069
your knees and your hips?

244
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:47,080
The toilet over here...

245
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:49,116
here, try sitting down on this.

246
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:51,151
Come on.

247
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,782
It's very easy
on her hips and her back.

248
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:56,789
Uh-huh.

249
00:26:56,845 --> 00:26:59,348
- Huh. Fascinating.
- Yeah.

250
00:26:59,414 --> 00:27:01,758
She can't get up?
She can't leave the room?

251
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:05,287
No. Here, just try the door.

252
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:07,334
Go on,
try to get outside the door.

253
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:10,131
I dare you.

254
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,476
Wow.

255
00:27:16,532 --> 00:27:18,478
Look, I gotta hand it to you.

256
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:20,536
You should probably
apply for a patent.

257
00:27:22,604 --> 00:27:26,575
So what do you do
on your days off?

258
00:27:26,642 --> 00:27:28,588
Me? Uh, nothing.

259
00:27:28,644 --> 00:27:30,954
I just, you know,
take care of my mother.

260
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:32,788
Well, you gotta...

261
00:27:32,848 --> 00:27:34,987
you gotta take her out
every now and then, you know?

262
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,620
Take her...

263
00:27:38,253 --> 00:27:40,665
I don't know,
take her fishing or something.

264
00:27:40,722 --> 00:27:42,326
Fishing?

265
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:45,565
Yeah. I like fishing.
How about you?

266
00:27:45,627 --> 00:27:47,868
No, not... not really.

267
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:51,138
Well...

268
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,180
I know a great spot.

269
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:58,115
How about next Sunday?
Do you wanna go?

270
00:28:00,242 --> 00:28:02,654
It's the perfect time of year.

271
00:28:04,713 --> 00:28:07,284
I'll... I'll call you.

272
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:09,329
You don't mind, do you?

273
00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:13,289
I'll call you.

274
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:17,971
Thanks for your time.

275
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:36,080
I think she likes you.

276
00:28:36,144 --> 00:28:37,851
Who?

277
00:28:37,913 --> 00:28:40,484
My sister.

278
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:42,961
Oh.

279
00:28:43,018 --> 00:28:44,463
Lucy.

280
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,726
Lucy? Laura.

281
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:49,268
Yeah, sorry. Laura.

282
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:57,336
How about you?

283
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:07,479
What does she do?

284
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,317
She's a student...

285
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:12,525
police academy.

286
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:19,192
Whoa.

287
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,036
Are you okay?

288
00:29:26,828 --> 00:29:29,934
I've been taking care of her
ever since my dad married her mom.

289
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:34,446
She...

290
00:29:34,503 --> 00:29:38,178
she had kind
of a rough childhood. I just...

291
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,584
I want her to be happy,
that's all.

292
00:29:42,644 --> 00:29:44,590
Like I said, I just...

293
00:29:44,646 --> 00:29:47,957
I don't know
if that's a good fit.

294
00:29:48,016 --> 00:29:50,553
It seems like a lot
of responsibility to me.

295
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:55,226
I had a good feeling about you

296
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,236
when I met you.

297
00:29:57,292 --> 00:30:00,068
Call it a gut instinct.

298
00:30:00,128 --> 00:30:03,109
And my gut's usually right.

299
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:05,805
Kind of goes with
the job, you know?

300
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:08,279
I'm telling you, when it comes
to judging character,

301
00:30:08,337 --> 00:30:11,250
I am second to none.

302
00:30:13,842 --> 00:30:15,844
I like your mom.

303
00:30:26,922 --> 00:30:28,367
Hi, Simon.

304
00:30:28,423 --> 00:30:30,733
I got out of class early,
so I came by.

305
00:30:32,494 --> 00:30:34,440
I left a message
on your cellphone.

306
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,476
Did you get it?

307
00:30:39,735 --> 00:30:42,045
How did you get
my cellphone number?

308
00:30:42,104 --> 00:30:44,414
Abbot gave it to me.

309
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:48,685
- Is that a problem?
- Oh, uh, no.

310
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:50,417
No, it's... it's fine.

311
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:56,319
Can you take this?
It's kind of heavy.

312
00:30:56,385 --> 00:30:58,922
You're hungry, right?
I'm gonna make you some pasta.

313
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,830
How's your

314
00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:02,664
Um...

315
00:31:03,692 --> 00:31:06,172
Hi, Mommy.
Do you remember me?

316
00:31:07,662 --> 00:31:09,835
- Oh.
- No.

317
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:11,900
She doesn't like to be touched.

318
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:16,015
You have a lovely home.

319
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,220
Well, I hope you're hungry.

320
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:38,769
I'm sorry, Mommy.
Did I scare you?

321
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,317
I work with DNA research
at the university.

322
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,290
And we're looking for a connection

323
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,730
between genetics and suicide.

324
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:08,461
And if we can find that connection,

325
00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:10,196
if we can find that suicide gene,

326
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:12,534
then we think that
we can probably prevent

327
00:32:12,594 --> 00:32:14,631
a lot of suicides.

328
00:32:14,696 --> 00:32:17,176
We can save a lot of lives.

329
00:32:17,232 --> 00:32:19,974
But it's very very hard

330
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:23,380
to find blood from people
who have killed themselves,

331
00:32:23,438 --> 00:32:26,544
from suicide victims like...

332
00:32:31,746 --> 00:32:34,693
I know this is
a very strange request,

333
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:38,788
but if you do wanna die,

334
00:32:38,854 --> 00:32:41,460
you could give me your blood

335
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:43,469
and you could help out
a lot of people?

336
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:46,165
Who are in the exact same
position that you're in,

337
00:32:46,228 --> 00:32:48,174
a very similar situation.

338
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,938
You could save a lot of lives.

339
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,945
Look at me.

340
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:55,675
Wouldn't that be a nice legacy?

341
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:57,683
Wouldn't that be an amazing thing

342
00:32:57,739 --> 00:32:59,878
to leave behind?

343
00:32:59,941 --> 00:33:02,148
So... so...

344
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,191
so you want my blood?

345
00:33:05,247 --> 00:33:07,887
Fine. I don't need it
anymore if it's...

346
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:09,826
what do you need me to do?

347
00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:12,798
My car is just down here
if you wanna...

348
00:33:12,854 --> 00:33:14,800
This is not the way to go.

349
00:33:14,856 --> 00:33:16,802
This is... this is not
the way to go.

350
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:19,805
Let's just...
let's go this way, okay?

351
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:21,101
Okay.

352
00:33:22,497 --> 00:33:25,137
Jack the Ripper, Albert Fish,

353
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,807
Ed Gein, Jeffrey Dahmer,

354
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,180
Richard Ramirez,

355
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:33,344
Andrei Chikatilo,

356
00:33:33,408 --> 00:33:35,752
the Zodiac killer
and Ted Bundy.

357
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,017
Which one of those is a vampire?

358
00:33:41,116 --> 00:33:42,789
Jeffrey Dahmer.

359
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:44,330
Jeffrey Dahmer
is my fucking hero,

360
00:33:44,386 --> 00:33:46,866
but that's just because
he was the ultimate pervert.

361
00:33:46,922 --> 00:33:49,698
The truth of the matter is
is that everyone I just mentioned

362
00:33:49,758 --> 00:33:51,328
is just a plain old serial killer.

363
00:33:51,393 --> 00:33:53,339
So what is a vampire?

364
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:55,773
Someone who loves blood.

365
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,401
Someone who loves blood
is a vampire.

366
00:33:58,466 --> 00:34:01,413
Renfield, Eclipse,
this is Blood Baron.

367
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:05,280
Nice to meet you. Eclipse.

368
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,617
Blood Baron,
you've been missed here, sir.

369
00:34:10,078 --> 00:34:11,523
Renfield.

370
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,218
Let's get you a glass of wine.

371
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,931
Shitty vampire sushi party.

372
00:34:23,992 --> 00:34:26,268
What do you think of these?

373
00:34:26,328 --> 00:34:28,467
Like 'em?

374
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:32,077
They're certainly functional.

375
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:35,444
I mean,
if you were interested

376
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:37,574
in biting someone's jugular,

377
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,585
that would be

378
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:42,178
the instrument to use, I suppose.

379
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:45,554
I've been reading all of your posts...

380
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:47,423
quite radical.

381
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:53,228
And sexy.

382
00:34:54,322 --> 00:34:56,393
If all of you could take your drinks

383
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,529
and please join me in the living room,

384
00:34:58,593 --> 00:35:00,334
I have something
that I'd like to share with you.

385
00:35:00,395 --> 00:35:02,671
If you guys wanna grab
some chairs from the kitchen.

386
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:04,768
Just throw them up front here.

387
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:07,780
Oh, except for there.
Renfield, Blood Baron,

388
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:10,339
could you guys actually
flip the couch around, please,

389
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:12,578
so it's pointed towards the screen?

390
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:21,226
Bram Stoker,
a real estate agent,

391
00:35:21,282 --> 00:35:24,456
pays a little visit
to Count Dracula's mansion.

392
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:28,490
Now upon arriving
he stumbles across his private diaries.

393
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:30,502
Dracula finds out

394
00:35:30,558 --> 00:35:32,504
that Bram has stolen his diaries

395
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,233
and begins to search for him.

396
00:35:34,295 --> 00:35:37,435
Hey hey, could you just stop
spoiling the film, okay?

397
00:35:37,499 --> 00:35:40,412
It's a silent film.
I have to explain it.

398
00:35:40,468 --> 00:35:42,812
- And how long is this again?
- It's two hours.

399
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:46,546
- Two hours?
- Two hours.

400
00:35:49,377 --> 00:35:53,450
All right, so Bram Stoker
steals Count Dracula's diary

401
00:35:53,515 --> 00:35:55,461
and writes a book about it.

402
00:35:55,517 --> 00:35:58,054
Dracula finds out and follows him

403
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:00,497
back to England.

404
00:36:00,555 --> 00:36:03,297
That's basically where
we'll pick up, here.

405
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:07,565
Blood Barry.

406
00:36:07,629 --> 00:36:10,508
Blood Barry,
are you all right?

407
00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:12,545
Are you okay?

408
00:36:16,638 --> 00:36:18,242
Sleepy?

409
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:24,254
I found this.
Is this yours?

410
00:36:31,886 --> 00:36:33,957
Is that yours?

411
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:41,604
I know about her.

412
00:36:43,765 --> 00:36:46,211
Thanks for hanging out with me.

413
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:48,474
Franny Pierce.

414
00:36:48,536 --> 00:36:50,846
Marcia Lizinski.

415
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,647
Saw it all on the news.

416
00:36:58,546 --> 00:37:00,685
Are you the one they call
the Blood Stealer

417
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:03,525
or the Vampire on some sites?

418
00:37:06,921 --> 00:37:08,525
You know how careless that is...

419
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,434
leaving something like that
on your cellphone?

420
00:37:15,764 --> 00:37:18,176
Do you wanna get caught?

421
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:23,907
Hey, guys,
we got the Vampire up here.

422
00:37:25,573 --> 00:37:27,553
He's right here.

423
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:37,090
Don't think about killing me.

424
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,266
I'm not snitching on you.

425
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,627
I love you.

426
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,072
I'm your friend.
You can trust me.

427
00:37:50,098 --> 00:37:52,305
You know how cool it is
for me right now,

428
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:55,348
being face to face
with the Vampire himself?

429
00:37:59,507 --> 00:38:01,953
I knew there was
something different about you...

430
00:38:03,645 --> 00:38:05,647
from the moment I met you.

431
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:12,832
Let's go for a drive.

432
00:38:15,857 --> 00:38:17,803
Come on, it'll be fun.

433
00:38:22,397 --> 00:38:23,842
Is this yours?

434
00:38:24,866 --> 00:38:27,369
- Huh?
- Is this yours?

435
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:28,914
Oh, yeah.

436
00:38:29,938 --> 00:38:32,350
Just a little hobby of mine.

437
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:34,717
I'm sorry, a hobby?

438
00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:36,084
Yeah.

439
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:38,715
You can drive, here.

440
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,418
Try it out.

441
00:38:52,293 --> 00:38:55,001
Let's try her, right here.

442
00:38:55,063 --> 00:38:56,440
Try her?

443
00:38:56,497 --> 00:38:58,443
Kill her.

444
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:01,708
I wanna see you in action.
It'll be fun.

445
00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:11,420
Hi. 1921 Adam, please.

446
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,925
Sorry, he's in training.

447
00:39:16,718 --> 00:39:18,664
You're his first passenger.

448
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,258
A cabbie never forgets his first
'til the day he dies.

449
00:39:22,323 --> 00:39:24,929
What's your name, if I may?

450
00:39:24,993 --> 00:39:27,030
My name?

451
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:28,836
Michaela.

452
00:39:29,864 --> 00:39:31,844
That's a beautiful name.

453
00:39:33,768 --> 00:39:36,146
Take a left up here.

454
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:48,360
Fuck, did you just see that plane
go down? Did you see that?

455
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:51,556
I swear to God,
I just fucking saw it.

456
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:53,565
I'm sorry, do you want
to make a quick stop?

457
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:55,567
We need to... your fare's on us.
Is that okay?

458
00:39:55,623 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah, sure, I guess.

459
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:07,313
All right.

460
00:40:26,454 --> 00:40:28,400
Hello.

461
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:31,300
Yeah, I'm calling to report
a plane crash.

462
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,506
Where is that?
Is that over...

463
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:36,508
is that Andrews Bay?

464
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:39,170
Yeah, somewhere over
Andrews Bay somewhere.

465
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:41,179
Me? I'm a cab driver.

466
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:43,647
Yes, I'm with a passenger
right now.

467
00:40:46,074 --> 00:40:48,680
They... they want us to stay put
until the police can come here.

468
00:40:48,743 --> 00:40:51,690
- Is that gonna be a problem for you?
- No, no, no, that's fine.

469
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:53,521
Thank you.

470
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:55,925
Okay. All right.

471
00:40:55,984 --> 00:40:57,930
15 minutes?

472
00:40:57,986 --> 00:41:00,364
Okay, just please hurry.

473
00:41:07,962 --> 00:41:11,239
So where did you say it crashed?

474
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:13,575
Watch out for the dog shit
there, sweetie.

475
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:15,705
No! No!

476
00:41:16,971 --> 00:41:17,949
Stop it!

477
00:41:18,973 --> 00:41:20,919
No! No!

478
00:41:25,413 --> 00:41:27,393
This isn't the hard part,

479
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:29,792
holding her down at first.

480
00:41:29,851 --> 00:41:32,627
- Get off me!
- That's why I go to judo every week.

481
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,102
I won't kill her just yet.

482
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:42,107
It's better alive, right?

483
00:41:42,163 --> 00:41:45,201
Three minutes of asphyxiation?

484
00:41:45,266 --> 00:41:46,973
Seem to do the trick.

485
00:41:47,035 --> 00:41:50,710
Hypoxia, panic impedes
her ability to think.

486
00:41:54,442 --> 00:41:56,922
But then again, it didn't seem like
she had much thought

487
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:59,083
up here before.
Am I right?

488
00:41:59,147 --> 00:42:01,093
Where are you going, sweetheart?

489
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,093
Oh. Hi. Hi.

490
00:44:42,376 --> 00:44:44,356
You want some?

491
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:43,949
That's rape.

492
00:45:45,473 --> 00:45:48,579
Nothing more, nothing less,

493
00:45:48,643 --> 00:45:50,623
just rape.

494
00:45:54,615 --> 00:45:56,219
What?

495
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:03,024
You're a sorry sorry son of a bitch,

496
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:05,434
you fucking maniac.

497
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:11,844
We both are.

498
00:46:21,075 --> 00:46:23,180
Is there...
Is there more than I know of?

499
00:46:23,244 --> 00:46:24,848
How many have you taken so far?

500
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:26,892
I... I can help.

501
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:31,363
What are you gonna do
with the body?

502
00:46:33,587 --> 00:46:36,466
- Well, I don't...
- What are you gonna do with the body?

503
00:46:36,524 --> 00:46:38,697
I don't gamble like you.
I play it safe.

504
00:46:38,759 --> 00:46:41,171
I will take her home.

505
00:46:41,228 --> 00:46:42,969
Her bones...
I just crush them up

506
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:45,408
and spread them in the ocean.

507
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:48,242
The flesh I just put in a pot

508
00:46:48,302 --> 00:46:51,374
with cayenne pepper,
boil it and make a nice...

509
00:46:51,439 --> 00:46:53,077
Pull over.

510
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,450
- Pull over the car. Pull it over.
- I'm not gonna kill...

511
00:46:55,509 --> 00:46:56,783
- Pull over!
- Okay.

512
00:47:09,623 --> 00:47:12,035
Did you have too much
to drink tonight?

513
00:47:14,228 --> 00:47:16,208
Are you all right?

514
00:47:20,234 --> 00:47:22,737
All right, everyone,
these are the biology exams.

515
00:47:22,803 --> 00:47:26,273
Uh, we should get started
in a few minutes.

516
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,320
Please put your binders away.

517
00:47:29,343 --> 00:47:32,256
Five, four, three,

518
00:47:32,313 --> 00:47:34,554
two, one.

519
00:47:34,615 --> 00:47:36,288
Good luck.

520
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:41,397
Dave, eyes on your paper, please.

521
00:48:03,644 --> 00:48:05,624
Hi. You're home.

522
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:11,489
What are you doing in here?

523
00:48:11,552 --> 00:48:13,862
- Hey, hey, hey.
- This one's different.

524
00:48:13,921 --> 00:48:16,561
What are you doing in here?
What are you trying to do?

525
00:48:16,624 --> 00:48:18,297
Detach it.

526
00:48:20,428 --> 00:48:22,237
- Take it off?
- Yeah.

527
00:48:24,432 --> 00:48:26,969
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

528
00:48:27,034 --> 00:48:29,412
It's okay.
I'm sorry.

529
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,416
What are you...

530
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:33,850
What are you doing here?

531
00:48:35,276 --> 00:48:37,085
The building manager let me in.

532
00:48:37,144 --> 00:48:39,454
- How did you get in here?
- He let me in.

533
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:42,427
Oh, wow, she just
starts moving around

534
00:48:42,483 --> 00:48:44,429
as soon as she's free, huh?

535
00:48:44,485 --> 00:48:46,123
Yeah.

536
00:48:47,455 --> 00:48:49,230
So he... I'm sorry,

537
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,201
the building manager let you in?

538
00:48:51,258 --> 00:48:53,898
Yeah, sorry. Do you have
extra keys to your apartment?

539
00:48:53,961 --> 00:48:55,736
Can I have one?

540
00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:58,436
Uh, no.
I only have one key.

541
00:48:58,499 --> 00:49:00,445
- Really?
- Yes.

542
00:49:00,501 --> 00:49:02,447
That's pretty risky.

543
00:49:02,503 --> 00:49:05,006
I mean, what would
you do if you lost it?

544
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:07,177
I probably have five
or six copies of my own keys,

545
00:49:07,241 --> 00:49:09,744
and when I leave the house
I bring at least two of them with me.

546
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,381
Listen to me. You need to call
before you come over here, okay?

547
00:49:12,446 --> 00:49:13,652
- I mean...
- I did.

548
00:49:13,714 --> 00:49:15,557
We could be busy.
We could be doing some...

549
00:49:15,616 --> 00:49:18,893
I did call.
You didn't pick up.

550
00:49:20,421 --> 00:49:22,230
- I didn't?
- No.

551
00:49:22,289 --> 00:49:25,168
You should probably
check your messages more often.

552
00:49:25,226 --> 00:49:27,172
Yeah.

553
00:49:27,228 --> 00:49:29,708
Oh shit.

554
00:49:29,763 --> 00:49:31,242
Um,

555
00:49:31,298 --> 00:49:34,211
and by the way, can...

556
00:49:34,268 --> 00:49:37,112
Can you stay out
of my room? Um...

557
00:49:37,171 --> 00:49:39,117
- Sure.
- This should be off-limits.

558
00:49:39,173 --> 00:49:41,210
I'll remember that next time.

559
00:50:34,728 --> 00:50:37,436
Hey, Mina,
what are you doing?

560
00:50:44,305 --> 00:50:46,615
Mina, come down
from there, okay?

561
00:50:49,543 --> 00:50:51,523
Going

562
00:50:56,717 --> 00:50:58,697
Mina.

563
00:51:01,689 --> 00:51:03,999
Do you really want to die?

564
00:51:09,396 --> 00:51:11,876
Let me ask you something, Mina.

565
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:16,546
Do you know yourself?

566
00:51:19,506 --> 00:51:21,508
You who decides to kill yourself...

567
00:51:21,575 --> 00:51:25,546
but do you really know
who you are?

568
00:51:25,613 --> 00:51:28,389
Do you know that self?

569
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:32,956
I mean, there are
60 trillion cells inside of you.

570
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,159
Do you know that?

571
00:51:35,222 --> 00:51:37,566
I mean, how often
do you think about that?

572
00:51:40,728 --> 00:51:42,605
Mina.

573
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:46,168
I don't.

574
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:47,576
Yes, you do.

575
00:51:47,635 --> 00:51:49,808
You think about them all the time.

576
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:53,181
You just don't think about it
in the right way. I mean...

577
00:51:54,608 --> 00:51:57,817
If your body is
an apartment complex,

578
00:51:57,878 --> 00:52:02,520
those 60 trillion cells
are your... your tenants.

579
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:06,258
They need ventilation, right?
So you breathe.

580
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,698
They need nourishment,
so you eat.

581
00:52:08,756 --> 00:52:11,760
When they seek renewal,
they nudge you with a little bit of a...

582
00:52:13,661 --> 00:52:15,663
sexual urge.

583
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:19,972
What you do is what they need.

584
00:52:22,202 --> 00:52:25,740
You have five senses, Mina:

585
00:52:25,806 --> 00:52:29,151
Sight, smell, sound, taste...

586
00:52:31,645 --> 00:52:33,181
and touch.

587
00:52:34,682 --> 00:52:36,423
But what is their purpose?

589
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,129
To see the world outside.

590
00:52:42,189 --> 00:52:44,169
To see everything,
to feel everything,

591
00:52:44,224 --> 00:52:46,329
to taste everything,
to touch everything.

592
00:52:46,393 --> 00:52:48,339
But they're completely useless

593
00:52:48,395 --> 00:52:51,205
when it comes to seeing
what's inside of you.

594
00:52:51,265 --> 00:52:53,211
Right?

595
00:52:53,267 --> 00:52:55,747
When you're eating something,

596
00:52:55,803 --> 00:52:58,283
at what point
do you not feel it anymore?

597
00:52:59,473 --> 00:53:01,885
About here?

598
00:53:01,942 --> 00:53:04,388
I mean, there's a party
going on inside of you,

599
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:07,221
but you're not invited.
The only time they nudge you again

600
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:09,261
is when it's time
to get rid of the garbage.

601
00:53:11,218 --> 00:53:13,027
But don't fool yourself.

602
00:53:14,655 --> 00:53:16,225
They need you.

603
00:53:17,925 --> 00:53:20,132
They need you
to see the outside world,

604
00:53:20,194 --> 00:53:23,300
like a submarine crew.

605
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,546
You're their sonar.

606
00:53:32,606 --> 00:53:35,485
That is your function.

607
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:38,022
You need to feed them.

608
00:53:38,078 --> 00:53:40,854
Everyone forgets
they're just a slave to them.

609
00:53:42,516 --> 00:53:46,931
You're just a slave.
And you start thinking about yourself.

610
00:53:46,987 --> 00:53:49,160
And you start thinking
about your death

611
00:53:49,223 --> 00:53:51,203
and not theirs.

612
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:55,734
And it's not fair,

613
00:53:55,796 --> 00:53:58,868
because they're the ones living,

614
00:53:58,932 --> 00:54:01,674
not you.

615
00:54:01,735 --> 00:54:04,113
You may be dead already.

616
00:54:13,213 --> 00:54:16,194
Now I really want to kill myself.

617
00:54:18,952 --> 00:54:19,930
Oh no.

618
00:54:21,021 --> 00:54:23,001
Well...

619
00:54:25,325 --> 00:54:28,704
now that's exactly
the opposite of what I want.

620
00:54:29,763 --> 00:54:32,471
All I'm saying, Mina...

621
00:54:32,533 --> 00:54:34,911
all I'm saying

622
00:54:34,968 --> 00:54:36,106
is you

623
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:39,083
don't have to die.

624
00:54:40,107 --> 00:54:42,053
Okay?

625
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,922
Thank you, Mr. Williams.

626
00:54:48,816 --> 00:54:50,591
Let's get you home.

627
00:54:50,651 --> 00:54:54,189
You're sure you're not gonna do
anything crazy on your own, right?

628
00:55:01,895 --> 00:55:03,704
Sorry.

629
00:55:04,731 --> 00:55:07,177
I was just... kidding.

630
00:55:08,735 --> 00:55:11,545
I just wanted you to look at me.

631
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:16,913
Really?

632
00:55:19,012 --> 00:55:20,923
Good night.

633
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:22,961
Bye.

634
00:55:32,092 --> 00:55:35,266
12 times now I have tried
to kill myself already,

635
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:38,310
and God just won't let me die.

636
00:55:38,365 --> 00:55:40,902
It's like I'm testing myself...

637
00:55:40,968 --> 00:55:44,074
how much can I keep believing in Him?

638
00:55:44,137 --> 00:55:46,947
How much can He keep forgiving me?

639
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:50,488
Maybe

640
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:53,957
I'm just testing Him.

641
00:55:54,014 --> 00:55:56,756
But then one day I realized
that God doesn't ever die,

642
00:55:56,817 --> 00:55:58,626
that He's incapable of dying.

643
00:55:58,685 --> 00:56:01,529
So how can He know
the first thing about death?

644
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:03,864
That's like asking a newborn baby

645
00:56:03,924 --> 00:56:06,803
about how to live life.

646
00:56:08,896 --> 00:56:11,172
His existence has
nothing to do with death.

647
00:56:11,231 --> 00:56:13,074
He has nothing to do with death.

648
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:15,113
Okay.

649
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:18,945
Can you please bring your computer?

650
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,584
I don't want any record
of our communication.

651
00:56:24,077 --> 00:56:25,556
Or I could just delete those.

652
00:56:25,612 --> 00:56:28,422
No. No, the police
can still retrieve it.

653
00:56:29,883 --> 00:56:31,829
After I'm dead,
I don't want anyone knowing

654
00:56:31,885 --> 00:56:33,865
that it was me.

655
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,730
Get in.

656
00:57:05,786 --> 00:57:07,732
Oh. No, I brought my own car.

657
00:57:07,788 --> 00:57:09,062
I was planning on taking it.

658
00:57:09,122 --> 00:57:11,864
We're going in this.
Just get in the back.

659
00:57:29,142 --> 00:57:30,883
Lapis Lazuli.

660
00:57:31,945 --> 00:57:33,583
Mandala.

661
00:57:35,082 --> 00:57:37,062
I'm Gargoyle.

662
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:40,064
Hi.

663
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,623
- I'm Gallows.
- Hi.

664
00:57:42,689 --> 00:57:44,999
You thought you were going to be
the only one, didn't you?

665
00:57:45,058 --> 00:57:47,402
Yeah, I guess I did.

666
00:57:47,461 --> 00:57:49,407
Sorry.

667
00:57:49,463 --> 00:57:51,739
Couldn't choose just one.

668
00:57:51,798 --> 00:57:54,301
I'm... I'm Ladybird.

669
00:57:58,805 --> 00:58:01,684
Do you want some coffee?
We have coffee.

670
00:58:01,742 --> 00:58:04,120
Of if you're...?

671
00:58:04,177 --> 00:58:05,815
I made sandwiches.

672
00:58:05,879 --> 00:58:08,450
I mean, do you want...
want a sandwich?

673
00:58:10,517 --> 00:58:12,326
Here you go.

674
00:58:13,487 --> 00:58:14,966
Done deal.

675
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:20,271
Ladies and gentlemen, shall we?

676
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:26,201
Have you heard about the Vampire?

677
00:58:26,266 --> 00:58:28,940
Supposedly

678
00:58:29,002 --> 00:58:30,709
targeting people like us

679
00:58:30,771 --> 00:58:33,479
who wanna die.

680
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,918
That's the guy who killed that woman

681
00:58:35,976 --> 00:58:38,718
by draining her blood, right?
What was her name?

682
00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:42,056
Rumor says it was Jellyfish.

683
00:58:42,115 --> 00:58:44,618
Who's Jellyfish?

684
00:58:45,819 --> 00:58:49,460
Well, she was a regular
member on Side by Cide.

685
00:58:49,523 --> 00:58:51,901
After that incident
there hasn't been

686
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:54,768
a single post of hers,
so people think it was her.

687
00:58:54,828 --> 00:58:57,035
She stops posting on a suicide site...

688
00:58:57,097 --> 00:58:59,703
naturally you'd figure
she killed herself.

689
00:59:01,034 --> 00:59:03,708
Either way it means Jellyfish
has left this world.

690
00:59:05,605 --> 00:59:07,744
Vampires are real?

691
00:59:26,126 --> 00:59:28,402
This is it.

692
00:59:28,462 --> 00:59:30,806
Nice place, huh?

693
00:59:33,033 --> 00:59:35,411
So let's hear your ideas.

694
00:59:35,469 --> 00:59:36,971
For what?

695
00:59:37,037 --> 00:59:39,950
Our suicide method.

696
00:59:40,006 --> 00:59:42,316
I brought a gun.
Someone shoot me.

697
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:45,845
That'd be murder. We want
to commit suicide, not murder someone.

698
00:59:45,912 --> 00:59:49,086
I brought some charcoal.
It's clean and painless.

699
00:59:49,149 --> 00:59:52,528
You pass out first,
and be dead before you know it.

700
00:59:52,586 --> 00:59:55,430
Sounds good to me.

701
00:59:55,489 --> 00:59:57,765
I just need everyone's hand
sealing the entire body of the car.

702
00:59:57,824 --> 00:59:59,770
Charcoal is fine
and all,

703
00:59:59,826 --> 01:00:01,635
but I can do you
one better.

704
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:08,079
What the hell is that?

705
01:00:08,135 --> 01:00:11,116
It's like carbon monoxide,
except you don't need fire.

706
01:00:11,171 --> 01:00:13,617
You just mix these liquids...
real easy.

707
01:00:13,673 --> 01:00:16,051
It will be painless,
like going to sleep.

708
01:00:16,109 --> 01:00:19,147
It's a kit I bought online.

709
01:00:19,212 --> 01:00:21,158
What kind of liquids?

710
01:00:21,214 --> 01:00:24,855
It's like, you know... kind of like
bleach, detergent, stuff you can get...

711
01:00:24,918 --> 01:00:27,330
- Let me see that.
- Hey, fuckface,

712
01:00:27,387 --> 01:00:29,492
who the hell cares what it is?

713
01:00:29,556 --> 01:00:32,730
I will tell you one thing though:

714
01:00:32,792 --> 01:00:34,931
it's 100% fat-free, motherfucker.

715
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,640
Oh fuck.

716
01:02:18,698 --> 01:02:20,678
There's your sandwiches.

717
01:02:23,803 --> 01:02:26,306
Are... are they dead?

718
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,960
What are you gonna do?

719
01:02:38,018 --> 01:02:39,656
Me? Uh...

720
01:02:42,222 --> 01:02:44,498
What about... what about you?

721
01:02:44,557 --> 01:02:46,366
Do you still want to die?

722
01:02:47,727 --> 01:02:49,502
Uh...

723
01:02:49,562 --> 01:02:51,508
what about you?

724
01:02:51,564 --> 01:02:54,135
Do you want...
do you want to die?

725
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,736
Do you want to die?

726
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:58,706
I'm not sure.

727
01:02:58,772 --> 01:03:01,116
Well, if you're going to die, I'm leaving.

728
01:03:01,174 --> 01:03:03,984
What are you going to do?

729
01:03:04,044 --> 01:03:06,718
If you're going to die,
I'm going to leave, okay?

730
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:10,290
- Okay.
- And by the way,

731
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,762
if you don't want to die,
I'm still leaving.

732
01:03:19,626 --> 01:03:21,731
They're... they're dead?

733
01:03:38,511 --> 01:03:40,218
I've got to find out where we are.

734
01:03:41,915 --> 01:03:44,555
If I can find out where we are,
I can find our way out of here.

735
01:03:45,585 --> 01:03:47,565
Okay?

736
01:03:48,621 --> 01:03:50,567
- Okay, well...
- Here, look.

737
01:03:50,623 --> 01:03:52,694
- Well, if we take the...
- No, look, here.

738
01:03:52,759 --> 01:03:54,397
- Here, look.
- ...the van.

739
01:03:54,461 --> 01:03:56,737
It's 10 miles that way.

740
01:03:58,865 --> 01:04:01,709
Oh. Well...

741
01:04:03,703 --> 01:04:06,240
well, what do we do
about the bodies?

742
01:04:06,306 --> 01:04:08,809
- Listen to me.
- Yeah?

743
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:11,822
Fuck the bodies. We're gonna
pretend like we were never here

744
01:04:11,878 --> 01:04:14,859
and we're gonna walk
10 miles that way, okay?

745
01:04:17,584 --> 01:04:19,359
- We're gonna walk?
- We're gonna walk.

746
01:04:19,419 --> 01:04:21,228
We're gonna leave the van
and we're gonna walk.

747
01:04:21,287 --> 01:04:23,233
- That's impossible.
- It's not impossible.

748
01:04:23,289 --> 01:04:25,895
You've never walked 10 miles before?
You can walk 10 miles.

749
01:04:25,959 --> 01:04:28,132
Let's go, come on.

750
01:04:28,194 --> 01:04:30,834
Come on.

751
01:04:30,897 --> 01:04:33,343
- Okay.
- Ladybird, right?

752
01:04:35,034 --> 01:04:36,513
Yeah.

753
01:04:36,569 --> 01:04:38,549
Okay, let's go.
There you go.

754
01:04:39,572 --> 01:04:42,678
There you go. Nice.

755
01:05:19,813 --> 01:05:22,225
Can we...
can we take a little break?

756
01:05:22,282 --> 01:05:24,853
- What?
- Just... my...

757
01:05:28,621 --> 01:05:29,929
Yeah.

758
01:05:37,864 --> 01:05:39,275
Ow.

759
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:43,807
Oh, these boots aren't
cut out for this terrain.

760
01:05:55,315 --> 01:05:58,262
- There's something on my leg.
- What?

761
01:05:58,318 --> 01:05:59,296
Oh my God.

762
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,958
- What's the matter?
- Can you...?

763
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:04,831
What... what... what is that?

764
01:06:06,459 --> 01:06:08,871
It's a leech.

765
01:06:12,265 --> 01:06:13,710
What do I do?

766
01:06:13,766 --> 01:06:17,578
Do you have a...
like lighter or salt?

767
01:06:17,637 --> 01:06:19,548
Or pepper also works.

768
01:06:19,606 --> 01:06:22,280
I've got... I've got salt.

769
01:06:22,342 --> 01:06:24,049
Let me see. Let me see.

770
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,056
Come here. All right.

771
01:06:26,112 --> 01:06:28,456
Eww. Eww. Eww. Eww.

772
01:06:33,753 --> 01:06:35,323
Eww.

773
01:06:42,629 --> 01:06:44,040
Oh sh...

774
01:06:47,767 --> 01:06:49,940
Their saliva has enzymes in it

775
01:06:50,003 --> 01:06:52,244
that stops the blood from clotting,

776
01:06:52,305 --> 01:06:54,808
so that's not gonna stop bleeding
for, like, three hours.

777
01:06:56,843 --> 01:06:58,789
What do I... what do I do?

778
01:06:58,845 --> 01:07:01,451
You've gotta suck... suck it out.

779
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:07,131
Oh, um...

780
01:07:08,555 --> 01:07:10,967
would you mind?

781
01:07:24,871 --> 01:07:26,817
There. Oh.

782
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:31,481
I swallowed it.

783
01:07:32,712 --> 01:07:35,352
Are you a vampire?

784
01:07:38,484 --> 01:07:39,861
Oh boy.

785
01:07:39,919 --> 01:07:42,058
You've got another one.

786
01:07:42,121 --> 01:07:43,930
What?

787
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,663
Eww.

788
01:07:46,893 --> 01:07:50,033
Eww.

789
01:07:50,096 --> 01:07:51,803
It's a big one.

790
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:13,590
This is a little bit embarrassing.

791
01:08:26,065 --> 01:08:28,568
Are...

792
01:08:28,635 --> 01:08:30,342
are you the Vampire?

793
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:36,850
Are you the Vampire?

794
01:08:50,023 --> 01:08:52,731
We should keep walking.

795
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:56,205
Wait. Wait.
You've got one too.

796
01:08:56,262 --> 01:08:58,299
On your... look.

797
01:08:58,364 --> 01:09:02,471
I can... I can... it's my turn.

798
01:09:02,535 --> 01:09:04,481
It's okay.
It's really okay.

799
01:09:04,537 --> 01:09:06,642
No, no, no.
Yeah, come on.

800
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:25,099
Why do you have that bag?

801
01:09:25,158 --> 01:09:27,638
What's in it?

802
01:09:27,694 --> 01:09:30,607
A laptop.

803
01:09:30,663 --> 01:09:34,338
Isn't that Lapis's laptop?

804
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,745
Yeah. She wanted me to delete
the evidence of our conversations.

805
01:10:45,404 --> 01:10:47,975
If everyone was supposed to die,

806
01:10:49,275 --> 01:10:52,313
then who would've
destroyed the evidence?

807
01:10:56,949 --> 01:10:59,122
Did you even plan to die?

808
01:11:23,643 --> 01:11:25,623
I'm the Vampire.

809
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,459
I'm...

810
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:33,397
I'm the Vampire.

811
01:11:35,288 --> 01:11:37,268
Bullshit.

812
01:11:42,495 --> 01:11:44,270
Do you want my blood?

813
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:47,777
No. If I wanted it,
I would've asked you for it already.

814
01:11:50,069 --> 01:11:52,709
You can have it if you want it.

815
01:12:01,447 --> 01:12:03,688
I won't tell anyone...

816
01:12:05,852 --> 01:12:07,832
anything.

817
01:12:12,525 --> 01:12:14,505
I promise.

818
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,360
Find me when you're ready.

819
01:13:25,898 --> 01:13:28,003
I think I should call him again.

820
01:13:31,203 --> 01:13:33,581
No. No.

821
01:13:33,639 --> 01:13:36,813
He's fine, right? I don't know
why teachers work so late.

822
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:39,652
And they don't get paid enough,
do they? It's so sad.

823
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:42,750
It's so sad that they don't
get paid what they should.

824
01:13:42,815 --> 01:13:45,352
Do you think he likes me?

825
01:13:51,324 --> 01:13:54,032
Twice for yes, once for no.

826
01:14:05,538 --> 01:14:07,848
That was yes.

827
01:14:54,086 --> 01:14:56,464
What are you doing in here?

828
01:14:58,224 --> 01:15:00,170
Did you sleep in here all night?

829
01:15:07,466 --> 01:15:09,446
What are you doing?

830
01:15:11,404 --> 01:15:14,647
You know, if you don't...

831
01:15:14,707 --> 01:15:18,621
if you don't like me,
you should just say so.

832
01:15:18,677 --> 01:15:20,623
What?

833
01:15:20,679 --> 01:15:24,957
Otherwise, what's the point
of me doing all this for you?

834
01:15:25,017 --> 01:15:26,997
Stop.

835
01:15:30,523 --> 01:15:32,867
Do you like someone else?

836
01:15:35,861 --> 01:15:36,862
I...

837
01:15:36,929 --> 01:15:38,306
- Do you?
- Yes.

838
01:15:38,364 --> 01:15:40,344
- You do?
- Yeah, I like someone else.

839
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:43,209
- And you're still with me?
- Listen, Lucy...

840
01:15:43,269 --> 01:15:45,215
Who the hell is Lucy?

841
01:15:45,271 --> 01:15:47,581
Laura.
I meant to say Laura.

842
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,948
I mean, I said "Lucy"...

843
01:15:49,008 --> 01:15:50,487
Go to hell!

844
01:18:00,673 --> 01:18:04,246
How about we go to my place?

845
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:06,256
Maybe...

846
01:18:06,312 --> 01:18:08,758
maybe you can kill me there.

847
01:18:11,684 --> 01:18:14,062
I want to die in my home.

848
01:18:17,289 --> 01:18:20,793
It's the only place I fit.

849
01:18:20,859 --> 01:18:23,271
Hmm.

850
01:18:23,329 --> 01:18:25,275
Well,

851
01:18:25,331 --> 01:18:28,335
I just think it's too risky.

852
01:18:29,935 --> 01:18:33,940
Because after you die,

853
01:18:34,006 --> 01:18:36,816
it's gonna be hard to get
your body into the car

854
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:39,481
without someone seeing me.

855
01:18:42,281 --> 01:18:44,454
You won't have to move my body.

856
01:18:48,887 --> 01:18:51,231
I bought a fridge.

857
01:19:07,139 --> 01:19:09,949
So this is my apartment.

858
01:19:10,009 --> 01:19:13,650
Well, it's kind of a basement.

859
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:19,454
There are no windows.

860
01:19:19,518 --> 01:19:22,988
But it was really cheap, so yeah.

861
01:19:23,055 --> 01:19:25,126
How much?

862
01:19:26,492 --> 01:19:28,438
$50.

863
01:19:28,494 --> 01:19:31,134
$50?

864
01:19:31,196 --> 01:19:33,836
- Yeah.
- Wow. Wow.

865
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:36,470
She's a beauty.

866
01:19:36,535 --> 01:19:38,344
Will it work?

867
01:19:41,874 --> 01:19:43,854
Will it work?

868
01:19:45,244 --> 01:19:47,656
Yeah , it's perfect.

869
01:20:05,831 --> 01:20:08,334
That's Josh.

870
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,641
Unfortunately, his...

871
01:20:10,703 --> 01:20:15,015
his father couldn't admit
that the boy was his, so...

872
01:20:15,074 --> 01:20:18,954
so I found a new man.

873
01:20:21,046 --> 01:20:23,356
Eric.

874
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:27,656
He was actually...

875
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,257
he was a really good person.

876
01:20:30,322 --> 01:20:33,235
He was sweet

877
01:20:33,292 --> 01:20:36,102
and kind.

878
01:20:36,161 --> 01:20:38,641
And he always wanted a peaceful,

879
01:20:38,697 --> 01:20:42,110
happy family.

880
01:20:42,167 --> 01:20:44,647
But Josh never took to him,

881
01:20:44,703 --> 01:20:49,083
so Eric started
beating Josh every day.

882
01:20:52,144 --> 01:20:54,283
But I couldn't...
I couldn't stop him.

883
01:20:54,346 --> 01:20:55,950
Um...

884
01:20:59,318 --> 01:21:02,026
I was...

885
01:21:02,087 --> 01:21:05,500
I was more scared
that Eric would leave us, and...

886
01:21:07,793 --> 01:21:10,239
I should have let him leave us.

887
01:21:18,036 --> 01:21:20,482
Eric ended up killing Josh.

888
01:21:30,582 --> 01:21:32,493
Eric's in j-jail?

889
01:21:33,519 --> 01:21:35,157
Yeah.

890
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:38,463
Maybe he was too young
to have kids.

891
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,139
No.

892
01:21:42,194 --> 01:21:44,265
He was 40.

893
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:47,537
How old are you?

894
01:21:49,234 --> 01:21:51,680
I'm 28 years old.

895
01:21:51,737 --> 01:21:54,081
You're so young.

896
01:21:56,809 --> 01:22:00,313
Do you know how long before you die?

897
01:22:00,379 --> 01:22:02,689
What do you mean?

898
01:22:03,715 --> 01:22:07,128
Vampires live a long time.

899
01:22:07,186 --> 01:22:09,223
Do you know when you'll die?

900
01:22:11,156 --> 01:22:13,830
I've never died before.
I don't know.

901
01:22:21,433 --> 01:22:23,106
Wake up.

902
01:22:25,137 --> 01:22:26,741
Oh boy.

903
01:22:28,974 --> 01:22:32,285
What are you gonna do
with them after you're gone?

904
01:22:32,344 --> 01:22:34,654
I'll let them go.

905
01:22:34,713 --> 01:22:37,057
You know,
the crows will get them.

906
01:22:41,286 --> 01:22:44,563
You know what?
I'll find a place for them.

907
01:22:44,623 --> 01:22:45,897
Oh, will you?

908
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:47,596
Yeah.

909
01:22:52,764 --> 01:22:54,744
The sky.

911
01:23:17,489 --> 01:23:18,968
Blood...

912
01:23:19,992 --> 01:23:23,166
makes up 8% of your body.

913
01:23:23,228 --> 01:23:26,437
That means if you weigh 100 lbs

914
01:23:26,498 --> 01:23:28,876
you've got eight lbs
of blood inside of you.

915
01:23:30,536 --> 01:23:33,540
That's about a gallon.

916
01:23:33,605 --> 01:23:36,347
To lose a third of that is lethal.

917
01:23:38,677 --> 01:23:40,748
Each one of these bottles

918
01:23:40,812 --> 01:23:42,758
has a quart.

919
01:23:42,814 --> 01:23:45,852
So if you lose two of these bottles...

920
01:23:49,254 --> 01:23:51,495
it would kill you.

921
01:23:51,557 --> 01:23:54,538
Four would be pretty much
all the blood that you have.

922
01:23:56,194 --> 01:23:57,798
Really?

923
01:23:57,863 --> 01:23:59,638
Yeah.

924
01:24:01,567 --> 01:24:03,843
I thought...

925
01:24:03,902 --> 01:24:06,906
I thought the blood made up
80% of your body.

926
01:24:06,972 --> 01:24:09,248
No. You're thinking
about water.

927
01:24:09,308 --> 01:24:12,016
Your body's made up
of about 70% water.

928
01:24:12,077 --> 01:24:14,921
This is

929
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:17,460
all the blood you have.

930
01:24:21,587 --> 01:24:23,567
Not much.

931
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:27,768
And yet without it you're dead.

932
01:24:29,394 --> 01:24:32,967
Blood...

933
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:35,375
blood is life itself.

934
01:24:43,942 --> 01:24:46,320
It's kind of beautiful.

935
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:50,290
I guess I'm giving you my life.

936
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:53,188
Exactly.

937
01:25:26,284 --> 01:25:30,460
Simon Williams.

938
01:25:32,891 --> 01:25:36,338
Laura King.

939
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:51,887
"Jellyfish."

940
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,739
It's a terrible book.

941
01:26:29,881 --> 01:26:31,986
You should be helping her.

942
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,734
You should be helping her.

943
01:26:40,492 --> 01:26:43,200
Why aren't you helping her?
That's the normal thing to do,

944
01:26:43,261 --> 01:26:45,798
is to help somebody when they're...

945
01:26:49,601 --> 01:26:51,581
Simon.

946
01:27:00,779 --> 01:27:02,759
That's enough.

947
01:27:30,675 --> 01:27:33,554
Oh, I'm sorry, Mommy.

948
01:27:33,612 --> 01:27:35,922
I'm sorry.
Did I startle you?

949
01:27:38,617 --> 01:27:40,563
Say, would you happen to know

950
01:27:40,619 --> 01:27:42,929
Simon's computer password?

951
01:27:52,264 --> 01:27:54,244
What's in here?

952
01:27:57,602 --> 01:27:59,081
What is in here?

953
01:28:01,273 --> 01:28:03,947
Are you sad?

954
01:28:04,009 --> 01:28:07,547
Is it because I don't
come around here anymore?

955
01:28:07,612 --> 01:28:09,751
I know. It's too bad.

956
01:28:11,383 --> 01:28:13,693
Simon is such a jerk.

957
01:28:13,752 --> 01:28:16,631
He's such a jerk.

958
01:28:16,688 --> 01:28:19,032
He has a girlfriend now, right?

959
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:21,331
What's she like?

960
01:28:22,694 --> 01:28:24,537
Has she been here before?

961
01:28:26,231 --> 01:28:28,905
What's wrong?

962
01:28:28,967 --> 01:28:30,537
Are you trying to remember?

963
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:33,550
It's okay.

964
01:28:35,407 --> 01:28:37,409
Come on, you can do it!

965
01:28:43,682 --> 01:28:45,355
Don't worry about it.

966
01:28:45,417 --> 01:28:48,694
Don't think so hard,
'cause your veins might explode.

967
01:28:48,753 --> 01:28:51,495
I'll figure this out on my own.

968
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:14,791
Bingo.

969
01:30:29,554 --> 01:30:31,534
I'm sorry.

970
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:36,139
I couldn't do it.

971
01:30:40,432 --> 01:30:42,434
I'm sure you're disappointed.

972
01:30:47,405 --> 01:30:50,875
This is the second time
I've failed to die.

973
01:31:11,363 --> 01:31:14,242
If you don't mind,

974
01:31:14,299 --> 01:31:17,143
how about I live for you?

975
01:31:20,905 --> 01:31:22,851
You could drink my blood

976
01:31:22,907 --> 01:31:26,184
whenever you wanted,

977
01:31:26,244 --> 01:31:28,815
however much you wanted.

978
01:31:37,789 --> 01:31:39,996
But...

979
01:31:40,058 --> 01:31:42,664
you have to promise me
no more killing...

980
01:31:47,766 --> 01:31:49,746
that I'd be the only one.

981
01:31:58,443 --> 01:32:01,947
Can I drink from your neck?

982
01:32:02,013 --> 01:32:05,119
I've never drunk like that before.

983
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:11,332
Do whatever you want.

984
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:16,370
My blood is your blood.

985
01:33:01,372 --> 01:33:03,716
Mandala...

986
01:33:06,211 --> 01:33:08,589
I'm Ingrid Bell.

987
01:33:13,118 --> 01:33:15,462
I'm Simon Williams.

988
01:33:18,356 --> 01:33:20,768
I'm Simon Williams.

989
01:33:23,128 --> 01:33:26,405
It's nice to meet you,
Simon Williams.

990
01:33:29,667 --> 01:33:32,045
It's nice to meet you too.

991
01:36:10,695 --> 01:36:11,730
Hello.

992
01:36:17,602 --> 01:36:19,912
Excuse me, can I help you?

993
01:36:19,971 --> 01:36:22,315
Uh, I'm here for Mina.

994
01:36:22,373 --> 01:36:25,718
Oh, you're the teacher.
Yes, come with me.

995
01:36:27,612 --> 01:36:29,558
Okay.

996
01:36:29,614 --> 01:36:31,821
Is everything okay?

997
01:36:31,883 --> 01:36:35,126
Well, no, it's not okay.
We've got her in intensive care.

998
01:36:35,186 --> 01:36:37,757
- I see.
- She had quite a night last night.

999
01:36:37,822 --> 01:36:39,597
We almost lost her.

1000
01:36:45,029 --> 01:36:48,374
She's a bit pale.
She's been through a lot.

1001
01:37:02,513 --> 01:37:05,790
She's in a state of shock
from the blood loss.

1002
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:07,796
It wasn't fatal.

1003
01:37:07,852 --> 01:37:11,527
That said, her condition's
far from stable.

1004
01:37:13,324 --> 01:37:16,430
She's a Japanese exchange student.
She's in my biology class.

1005
01:37:16,494 --> 01:37:19,668
Yeah, her host parents
from her home stay

1006
01:37:19,731 --> 01:37:21,506
are on the East Coast
this weekend.

1007
01:37:21,566 --> 01:37:23,944
You know,
she had to call 911 herself.

1008
01:37:24,001 --> 01:37:26,777
Makes you wonder
if she really wanted to die.

1009
01:37:26,838 --> 01:37:30,047
Well, maybe she just got scared
at the last minute

1010
01:37:30,108 --> 01:37:32,054
and changed her mind.

1011
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:34,920
We found your phone number
in her phone's call history.

1012
01:37:34,979 --> 01:37:37,721
It looks like she tried calling you
over and over again.

1013
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:40,525
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1014
01:37:40,585 --> 01:37:42,531
Sorry about that.

1015
01:37:42,587 --> 01:37:46,831
Is there anything I can do, Miss Ray?

1016
01:37:46,891 --> 01:37:49,531
Well, she's lost a lot of blood.

1017
01:37:49,594 --> 01:37:52,200
Do you know what your blood type is?

1018
01:37:52,263 --> 01:37:54,209
Mine?

1019
01:37:54,265 --> 01:37:56,211
Uh, yeah.

1020
01:37:56,267 --> 01:37:58,508
She needs blood.
Maybe you can help us.

1021
01:37:58,569 --> 01:38:01,311
I don't know
what my blood type is, so...

1022
01:38:01,372 --> 01:38:04,478
Well, let's find out, shall we?

1023
01:38:04,542 --> 01:38:07,352
Come on, it's just very simple.

1024
01:38:07,412 --> 01:38:08,686
Okay.

1025
01:38:14,185 --> 01:38:16,131
Now just one little prick.

1026
01:38:16,187 --> 01:38:18,133
- You'll barely feel it.
- Okay.

1027
01:38:18,189 --> 01:38:19,634
- There you go.
- Ow.

1028
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:21,636
All right,
I just need a drop.

1029
01:38:21,692 --> 01:38:23,330
Here.

1030
01:38:23,394 --> 01:38:25,704
All right, yes,
sometimes it's better if you don't look.

1031
01:38:25,763 --> 01:38:27,743
- Yeah, I don't want to look at it.
- There you go.

1032
01:38:29,133 --> 01:38:31,409
Okay, gotcha.

1033
01:38:38,443 --> 01:38:41,424
Okay, congratulations.

1034
01:38:41,479 --> 01:38:44,187
You're O-positive.
It means you can help her.

1035
01:38:44,248 --> 01:38:46,285
- Oh.
- Here.

1036
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:49,354
You know, I know that she is
really gonna appreciate this.

1037
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:50,398
Okay.

1038
01:38:51,422 --> 01:38:54,096
Yeah, let's just...
swing yourself around. Good.

1039
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:56,104
- And lay down.
- Okay.

1040
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:58,140
All right, now...

1041
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,574
You don't look like needles
are your favorite thing, huh?

1042
01:39:05,636 --> 01:39:07,582
No.

1043
01:39:07,638 --> 01:39:08,981
Oh God.

1044
01:39:17,281 --> 01:39:19,454
All right,
now make a fist for me.

1045
01:39:19,517 --> 01:39:20,655
I am.

1046
01:39:20,718 --> 01:39:22,322
Let's see.

1047
01:39:22,386 --> 01:39:24,366
That looks pretty good.

1048
01:39:33,297 --> 01:39:35,106
All right.

1049
01:43:56,861 --> 01:44:01,139
Simon!

1050
01:46:02,152 --> 01:46:03,529
Stop.

1051
01:46:04,555 --> 01:46:07,035
Stop. I...

1052
01:46:07,091 --> 01:46:09,037
Stop. I can't...

1053
01:46:09,093 --> 01:46:11,767
I can't see anything. It's...

1054
01:46:11,829 --> 01:46:14,207
everything is dark.

1055
01:46:14,265 --> 01:46:16,211
I can't see.

1056
01:46:16,267 --> 01:46:18,543
I'm anemic.

1057
01:46:18,602 --> 01:46:20,980
I gave too much blood.

1058
01:46:59,576 --> 01:47:02,022
Your high school teacher stopped by

1059
01:47:02,079 --> 01:47:04,423
and donated this blood for you.

1060
01:47:09,019 --> 01:47:11,556
Is he here?

1061
01:47:11,622 --> 01:47:13,568
No, he left already.

1062
01:47:13,624 --> 01:47:16,503
But he said he'd stop by tomorrow
and check on you.

1063
01:47:20,864 --> 01:47:22,844
Just rest.

1064
01:48:12,883 --> 01:48:15,625
- Hmm.
- So this is it.

1065
01:48:17,921 --> 01:48:19,696
A balloon.

1066
01:48:19,757 --> 01:48:21,236
Yeah.

1067
01:48:33,537 --> 01:48:36,017
I'm sorry
it's a bit of a mess in here.

1068
01:48:36,073 --> 01:48:38,280
It's okay.

1069
01:48:38,342 --> 01:48:41,289
- I'll get you something to sit on.
- Okay. Okay.

1070
01:48:41,345 --> 01:48:42,483
Here.

1071
01:48:44,314 --> 01:48:46,385
So I can take pictures with this.

1072
01:48:46,450 --> 01:48:47,622
Or I...

1073
01:48:49,286 --> 01:48:51,960
I can do your...
do your video also.

1074
01:48:52,022 --> 01:48:53,126
Okay.

1075
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:55,796
I brought you an apple.

1076
01:49:10,174 --> 01:49:12,381
I used to dance.

1077
01:49:16,013 --> 01:49:18,516
What kind of dancing?

1078
01:49:22,319 --> 01:49:24,265
Ballet dancing.

1079
01:49:24,321 --> 01:49:25,664
Belly dancing?

1080
01:49:25,722 --> 01:49:28,965
No, not belly dancing.

1081
01:49:29,026 --> 01:49:31,267
Ballet dancing. Ballet.

1082
01:49:34,131 --> 01:49:36,941
It's weird to dance on a refrigerator.

1083
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,106
- On a freezer.
- A freezer. A freezer.

1084
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:42,150
Okay.

1085
01:49:55,919 --> 01:49:57,865
Hmm.

1086
01:49:59,957 --> 01:50:03,302
Why do people walk?

1087
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,703
Walk?

1088
01:50:04,761 --> 01:50:06,763
Yeah, why do they walk?

1089
01:50:08,265 --> 01:50:12,338
When I was little, I used to...

1090
01:50:12,402 --> 01:50:14,780
I used to think that people walked

1091
01:50:14,838 --> 01:50:17,614
'cause they liked the sound
that their footsteps made

1092
01:50:17,674 --> 01:50:20,154
and that all the people
on the street were walking

1093
01:50:20,210 --> 01:50:22,212
'cause they liked the sound.

1094
01:50:23,947 --> 01:50:25,927
- Huh.
- Hmm.

1095
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,466
I'd put, like,

1096
01:50:31,522 --> 01:50:34,230
pebbles in...

1097
01:50:34,291 --> 01:50:36,271
pebbles in my shoes

1098
01:50:36,326 --> 01:50:39,102
so they made more noise
when I walked.

1099
01:50:41,865 --> 01:50:43,708
One day my teacher told me...

1100
01:50:43,767 --> 01:50:46,646
it was like I was walking funny,
so she made me take them out.

1101
01:50:49,339 --> 01:50:51,046
I hated school.

1102
01:50:52,709 --> 01:50:54,689
Me too.

1103
01:51:00,184 --> 01:51:02,186
I'll tell you what...

1104
01:51:05,289 --> 01:51:07,735
you can walk however you want.

1105
01:51:10,027 --> 01:51:11,973
- Okay?
- I know.

1106
01:51:12,029 --> 01:51:14,168
- Okay.
- Here.

1107
01:52:35,212 --> 01:52:36,850
Okay.

1108
01:52:39,583 --> 01:52:41,221
Hi, everyone.

1109
01:52:43,587 --> 01:52:45,225
My name...

1110
01:52:46,290 --> 01:52:48,930
my name is Maria Lucas.

1111
01:52:50,594 --> 01:52:52,540
I'm 25.

1112
01:52:52,596 --> 01:52:55,304
And I'd be turning

1113
01:52:55,365 --> 01:52:58,073
26 next month

1114
01:52:58,135 --> 01:53:01,639
if I weren't about to die.

1115
01:53:01,705 --> 01:53:04,948
But I'm... I'm done.

1116
01:53:08,812 --> 01:53:12,726
I never figured out how to enjoy...

1117
01:53:12,783 --> 01:53:14,558
enjoy life.

1118
01:53:14,618 --> 01:53:17,064
It just really...
it's always seemed

1119
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:19,896
so strange to me,
didn't make sense.

1120
01:53:23,293 --> 01:53:26,604
But in my next life

1121
01:53:26,663 --> 01:53:28,802
I want to be human again.

1122
01:53:30,634 --> 01:53:33,205
Hades is helping me to die.

1123
01:53:34,838 --> 01:53:39,344
He's... he's behind
the camera right now.

1124
01:53:41,712 --> 01:53:44,818
I wonder if I'll see you in heaven.

1125
01:53:47,884 --> 01:53:52,333
We met on a website called...

1126
01:53:52,389 --> 01:53:55,029
called Side by Cide...

1127
01:53:56,626 --> 01:54:00,164
and decided that we were
gonna die together, so...

1128
01:54:02,566 --> 01:54:05,046
I'm gonna go first.

1129
01:54:06,670 --> 01:54:09,082
Don't take too long, okay?

1130
01:54:12,242 --> 01:54:14,222
Okay.

1131
01:54:33,096 --> 01:54:35,633
Do you ever die in your own dream?

1132
01:54:37,434 --> 01:54:39,744
I've never died in my own dream.

1133
01:54:39,803 --> 01:54:41,908
Is it even possible...

1134
01:54:42,973 --> 01:54:45,385
to die in your own dream?

1135
01:54:48,011 --> 01:54:50,491
If this were my dream,
I would never die.

1136
01:54:55,952 --> 01:54:59,058
What if this isn't your dream?

1137
01:54:59,122 --> 01:55:01,762
Hmm?

1138
01:55:01,825 --> 01:55:04,135
What if it's mine?

1139
01:55:05,962 --> 01:55:07,942
Is this your dream?
