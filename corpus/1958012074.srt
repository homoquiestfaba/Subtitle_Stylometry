{\an8}[man] All right, who's ready

00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,305
That's right. So welcome here.

4
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:15,599
Uh, show of hands,
how many people have been

5
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,017
to a taping of a TV show before?

6
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:18,519
Thank you.

7
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:22,189
Okay, just remember,
the movie's hilarious.

8
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:23,482
Everyone buy tickets.

9
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,776
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah?

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,861
Do you think I'm good
in the movie?

11
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,070
Come on, Kev, I'm your agent.

12
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:29,655
Of course, I think you're good
in the movie.

13
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,782
You know who else thinks
you're good in the movie?

14
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,826
The studio.
Now, go knock 'em dead.

15
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:36,495
Big smiles, big laughs,
you're America's funny man.

16
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,664
[man] The house band's gonna
play a little bit for ya,

17
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:39,749
and, uh, we're gonna have
a great time, all right?

18
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,542
America's funny man.

19
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,295
[cheers and applause]

20
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,089
Oh, now, Kev,
people are just raving

21
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:48,424
about this new movie of yours.

22
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,259
Oh, my God, they are raving.

23
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,637
You are working with
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson,

24
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,723
playing
his comedy sidekick again.

25
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,308
What is this,
the sixth time now?

26
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,727
- Number six.
- How do you keep it so fresh?

27
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,480
I mean, look,
Dwayne and I are, um,

28
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,439
you know, we're friends.

29
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,774
- Lucky.
- Hashtag, Jealous.

30
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,400
[laughing]

31
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:08,986
- He's lucky, too.
He's lucky, too.

32
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,696
But, I mean, look,
when you are friends,

33
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,114
you feed off of each other,

34
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,074
that energy, of course,
transfers.

35
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:15,451
But, uh, I don't know,
I would like to think

36
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,704
of my-my characters
as-as heroes as well.

37
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:21,123
[laughing]

38
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:24,627
- I don't know...
I don't know why the laugh.

39
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,378
I'm very serious.

40
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,255
You know, I've actually
I've been...

41
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,924
I've been trying to become
a leading man,

42
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,176
you know, do more
of an action star thing,

43
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,428
but I've been-I've been
somewhat typecast.

44
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:35,805
For some reason, people only
see me as the funny guy.

45
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,097
- You make me laugh.
- No.

46
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,098
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

47
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,225
Glad-glad, you know,
appreciate it.

48
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,560
- I'm not an easy audience.
[laughing]

49
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:42,645
Yeah, you know,
but it's just it's...

50
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,064
I can do more than show up

51
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,733
and do the funny
or do the dance. I'm...

52
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,026
- Would you, though?
- Would you do that dance?

53
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,069
- Come on.
- Come on!

54
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,113
Who wants to see
Kevin dance, huh?

55
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,699
We'll get the "Macarena" going.

56
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,369
No. No.

57
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,787
I'm not... I'm not gonna dance.

58
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,205
- Next time.
Next time then, for sure.

59
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,581
Now, here's just a question.

60
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:05,793
Like, okay, when you...
When you see Idris Elba, right,

61
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,920
you see him and you go,
"Wow, that's an action star".

62
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,631
But if you took
six inches off of Idris,

63
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,174
nobody...
Nobody's gonna give a shit.

64
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,676
- Okay-okay, just...
- Okay.

65
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,845
Gentle reminder here,
it's a live broadcast.

66
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,346
Got it. But you get my point.

67
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,722
Nobody's gonna care.
- Right.

68
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,015
All right, if he was smaller.

69
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,600
I mean, I don't think
I know any action stars

70
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:24,103
that are 5'7". Can we name one?

71
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,022
- There's, um...
Oh, there's Mr. Tom Cruise.

72
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,274
Oh, wonderful.

73
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,900
- Who we love.
A favorite here on the show.

74
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,485
- Okay. Tom Cruise.
That's one. All right.

75
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,903
- Jackie Chan.
- Yeah!

76
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,322
- Isn't he great.
- Oh, he's a little guy.

77
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:37,491
I feel like you're being a dick.

78
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,910
Is-Is this a bit?

79
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,579
Are you guys... is this a bit?

80
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,123
- I-I think it may have been.
Getting back to the movie,

81
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,292
tell us-tell us
just how great this movie is.

82
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,752
The, uh, the movie's garbage.

83
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,881
- Sorry?
- Yeah, the movie's garbage.

84
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,550
Take the movie, ball it up,
throw it in the trash can.

85
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,927
How many times do you need
to see me in a car

86
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,846
with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson?

87
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,599
And I'm the comedy sidekick,
and he's saving lives,

88
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,976
and I got a catchphrase,
"Oh, hell no"?

89
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:04,935
We love it when you say that.

90
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,770
Oh, good. Can you do it again?

91
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,315
- Here's my question.
Why can't I be an action star?

92
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,568
I read something online
about you being afraid

93
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,069
of woodland creatures.

94
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:15,487
- Oh, yes.
- About me what?

95
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,572
Beaver? It was it a squirrel?

96
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:17,573
- Squirrel.
- A squirrel.

97
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:18,532
- It was a squirrel.
- Yes.

98
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:19,450
That you have a fear
of squirrels.

99
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,451
Who's afraid of a squirrel?

100
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,827
I'm not fuckin' afraid
of a squirrel.

101
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,245
- Okay.
- Ooh.

102
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,371
- I'm not afraid of shit!
- Okay, you've said it.

103
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,165
You've made your point there.
- I'm not afraid of shit,

104
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,167
and I'm more than just a guy
that does comedy.

105
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,002
I'm a fuckin' action star,
all right?

106
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,879
So why don't you start
taking me a little serious?

107
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,797
Tell me what I am
and what I'm not.

108
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,424
If I didn't have
what the fuck it takes,

109
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,551
would I show this? Or that?

110
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,221
Back up.
- Yep.

111
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,389
Kev, Kev, Kev.

112
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:43,515
Kev, hey, you gotta go
back out there.

113
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,642
Say it was a joke.

114
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,101
I'm not telling them
it was a joke.

115
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,394
You don't get it, man.

116
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:48,896
All right? I'm trying
to be taken seriously.

117
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,190
My whole life, I've dreamed
of becoming an action hero.

118
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,359
Well, you know,
maybe instead of dreaming,

119
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,735
you should just
stay in your own lane.

120
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,654
What the fuck did you just say?

121
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,238
- What are you doin'?
- Ooh!

122
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,158
Pssshhh...

123
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,245

or Wilcox, or Coach Ron.

343
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,491
I like Coach Ron.

344
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,243
- And I refer to you as...
- Agent Hart.

345
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,285
- Right.
- Right.

346
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,453
- Yes.
- See, I'm on it.

347
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,830
Now I assume you got me in
this FBI jacket

348
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,874
and stuff for a reason.
So, what is it?

349
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,709
Hey, would you do me a favor?

350
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:55,961
Yeah.

351
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,505
Kevin, would you
grab that chair for me?

352
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,506
- Yeah.
- Would you?

353
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,424
- You mean this one?
- No, goddammit!

354
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,843
I said respond
only to Agent Hart!

355
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:08,265
Fuck!

356
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,433
You just said that.
I fucked up. I'm sorry.

357
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,643
That's not gonna happen again.

358
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,019
Why don't you just
call me Kevin?

359
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,980
Okay, in your life,
have you ever heard

360
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:19,859
an action star leading man
ever called Kevin?

361
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,319
I mean, Kevin James
in "Mall Cop".

362
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,863
No, no. Kevin is the name
of a punk bitch.

363
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,700
Ethan Hunt,
that is an action star name.

364
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,702
Tom Cruise was my alumni.

365
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,620
For nine years of his life,

366
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,331
he only responded to Ethan Hunt

367
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,834
whether he was
on-camera or off-camera.

368
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,211
Whether he was in the shower,
or on the toilet.

369
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,921
Whether he was fucking,
or not fucking.

370
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,256
- Okay, I...
- If he was even...

371
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,135
- I understand, Coach Ron!
- Do you? Do you really?

372
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,471
I hope so, for your sake.

373
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,266
Because your life depends on it.

374
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,852
Okay, next lesson.

375
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,812
Every leading man needs to know

376
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,606
how to run into
a burning building

377
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,024
and save a stranger.
- Hmm.

378
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,905
Wow!

379
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,033
Holy shit.
How'd you do that, man?

380
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,702
And the stranger that
we are going to save today

381
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:15,415
is our own action star dummy,
little Kevin.

382
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,794
- That's supposed to be me?
- I don't see the resemblance.

383
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,046
Are you fucking kidding?

384
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,049
No, w-we've had this dummy
for years, buddy.

385
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,010
<i>- [Kevin] Oh, hell, no.</i>
- Bitch, that's my line.

386
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,678
I've said that line in,
like, twelve movies.

387
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,305
Agent Hart,
are you a narcissist?

388
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,723
No.

389
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:32,974
Do you think the whole world
is all about you?

390
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,601
- That's not... I'm not...
- No.

391
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,645
You look at you
and then you look at him.

392
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,605
- That's what...
- Look at you, and look at him.

393
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:42,067
Do you see any resemblance?
- Kind of sort of, man!

394
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,236
O-Okay, all right.
Okay, maybe I'm crazy.

395
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,238
<i>[Kevin] Help! Help me!</i>

396
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,659
<i>Oh, hell no! Help! Help me!</i>

397
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,285
<i>Oh, hell no!</i>

398
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,996
Now, safety during stunts
is of the utmost importance.

399
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,623
Yeah, but I mean,
that's why you got stuntmen,

400
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,751
right?
- Watch it.

401
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,378
No, for the other guys,
not for me.

402
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,588
T-the lightweights. I don't...

403
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,549
Okay, your jacket
is flame retardant,

404
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,551
which means that
if you catch on fire,

405
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,596
don't panic, I will come in
and put you out.

406
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,140
Okay. Y-You're gonna...

407
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,850
Okay, I feel-I feel good...
I feel good about that.

408
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,728
When you're ready,
I want you to storm the house,

409
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,481
find the victim,
and bring him to safety.

410
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,858
[growling]

411
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,777
What is that?

412
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,404
What are you doing? I do...

413
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,073
[barking]
- Psyching myself up.

414
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,952
[barking]

415
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,204
[howling]

416
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,998
It's hot! Hot!

417
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,503
[barking]

418
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:48,216
[coughing]

419
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,304
It's fucking hot!

420
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,182
Where the fuck are you at?
Oh, God.

421
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,018
Oh, fuck, I can't see shit!

422
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,229
Little Kev?

423
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,149
Excuse me, are you Ron Wilcox?

424
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,276
Oh, hello. How are you?

425
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,570
- Jordan King.
- We've been waiting for you.

426
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,780
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

427
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,657
- I've got you, little Kev.
<i>- Oh, hell no!</i>

428
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,784
I'm about to save
your little beautiful black ass.

429
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,537
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

430
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,205
<i>Oh, hell no!</i>

431
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,457
What the fuck?

432
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,333
Who is this?
<i>- Help! Help me!</i>

433
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,961
<i>Oh, hell no!</i>
- What the...

434
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,381
<i>Help! Help me! Oh, hell no!</i>

435
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,175
It's fucking hot!

436
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:31,468
Get your ass up.

437
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,970
Yeah, um, I'm just so nervous.

438
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,347
I've never been in
an action movie before.

439
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,974
I just wanna bring
my A-game here.

440
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,143
- 90% is mental, okay?
- Oh, shit... Oh, shit!

441
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,812
- You are gonna be fantastic.
[screaming]

442
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,356
I just know it.
- Oh, shit.

443
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,525
Is he okay?
- Oh, God.

444
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,652
You leave this guy alone
for five seconds.

445
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,987
Geez.
- Put me out! Put me out!

446
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,615
Put me out! Put me out!
Put me out!

447
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,995
- Is he okay?
- Oh, he's fine.

448
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,663
Gal Gadot was training with me,

449
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,499
she was on fire
for twelve minutes.

450
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,709
She put herself out
with a blanket.

451
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,337
He barely lasted twelve seconds.

452
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,088
Is this funny to you?

453
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,217
Hey, a leading man must learn
not to sweat the small stuff.

454
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,052
What are you talking about
the small stuff?

455
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,970
I was on fucking fire,
Coach Ron!

456
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,472
Hey, knock it off!

457
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,849
There's a lady present,
and I want you to meet her.

458
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,101
Agent Hart,
this is Agent Jordan King.

459
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,228
She'll be your bunkmate.

460
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,854
It is a pleasure to meet you.

461
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,439
My pleasure.
Okay, you wanna explain to me

462
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,316
why she get
this nice introduction?

463
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,109
Why isn't she getting
hit in the head with a bat?

464
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,861
When are you gonna bop her?
- Excuse me?

465
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,239
Okay, you know, just...

466
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,616
When he does this kind of thing,
I just zone him out.

467
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,701
When he starts to whine.
Come on, I'll give you a tour.

468
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,912
Okay.

469
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,622
Now, this used to be
a slaughterhouse years ago,

470
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,082
up until the 70's...

471
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:48,920
♪♪♪

472
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,839
...which brings me
to rule number two.

473
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,758
There'll be no sexual
intercourse on the premises.

474
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:58,137
Uh, yeah, um,
that won't be a problem.

475
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,515
[laughter]

476
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,851
I didn't think it would be.

477
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:06,646
- I know you have to say it.
I-It's fine, we're good.

478
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,565
- All right.
So, hey, take a beat, okay?

479
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,692
Relax, and we'll see you
out in twenty

480
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,069
on the training ground, okay?

481
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,487
Thanks, Ron. You're the best.

482
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,615
Hey, it's a pleasure.

483
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,077
[laughing]

484
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,830
He's a fucking sociopath.

485
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,541
- How do you mean?
- How do I mean?

486
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,126
Do you really wanna know
how I mean?

487
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,168
Because I was here
a couple days ago

488
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,587
and shit hit the fan.

489
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,005
There was a guy in here
accusing him

490
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,299
of murdering some dude
named Rodrigo.

491
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,134
- Rodrigo?
- Yes, Rodrigo.

492
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,218
Saw a whole thing.

493
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,511
And when I first
walked in this bitch,

494
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,221
they hit me in the head
with a bat.

495
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,807
Not no plastic bat.
With a fucking metal bat!

496
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,476
And today, today he let me
catch myself on fire!

497
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,104
"Let me catch myself on fire"?

498
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,355
I don't know why
you gotta sound it out.

499
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,650
Yes. Let me catch...
No, I see why you did that.

500
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,110
Because if you slow it down,

501
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,028
you slow down,
it don't sound right.

502
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,446
But you get what I'm saying.

503
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,823
It happened.
It fucking happened.

504
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,074
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

505
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,701
It's just,
I don't have my phone,

506
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,661
it's weird in here,

507
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:04,871
and stuff is just starting to
fuck with me.

508
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,665
Maybe-maybe I'm going
a little stir crazy.

509
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,001
I don't know.

510
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:14,005
That's shit. That's shit water.

511
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,132
Yep, God damn.

512
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,886
Well, you're
not alone anymore, so...

Guess I'm imaginin' that, too?

1379
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:43,335
Yeah, well, you know,
this is meth country.

1380
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:46,839
Probably a couple of tweakers
goin' for a joyride.

1381
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:47,965
They'll be back.
- Ah...

1382
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,800
Tweakers love to drive,
I keep forgettin.

1383
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:50,759
I thought we were
gonna be cool, baby.

1384
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:52,261
- Yeah.
- I am cool. Cool.

1385
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:53,470
[chuckling]

1386
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:54,847
Hey, look.

1387
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,599
I know this has
been tough on you.

1388
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,684
You only got a couple days left.

1389
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:01,729
My advice, take as much wisdom
as you can from this guy.

1390
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,314
And just have some fun.
- Yeah. Thank you.

1391
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:05,691
Appreciate you, Josh.

1392
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,651
See ya, Kev.

1393
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:10,321
- I love you, man.
- I love you too, man.

1394
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,739
Jordan.

1395
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,035
The fuck was that?

1396
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,703
[car starts]

1397
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:22,249
[music playing in car]

1398
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:27,671
- Agent Hart.
I wanna tell ya somethin'.

1399
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:29,506
I don't really feel like
dealin' with it, Coach Ron.

1400
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,634
But look.

1401
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,053
I'm sorry about
that live bullet, man.

1402
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,763
I really am.

1403
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,390
It's all I wanted, man.

1404
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:40,059
All I wanted was an apology.

1405
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:42,061
I know.

1406
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:45,606
You sayin' that to me makes
the world of difference.

1407
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,275
I'm sorry that
I accused you of...

1408
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:51,528
Of tryin' to kill me
and other people.

1409
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:54,114
Now, give me a hug, man.
Thank you.

1410
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,116
Thank you.
- Uh, guys?

1411
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,452
- Yeah.
- Who is that?

1412
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:07,044
[car honking]

1413
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,928
- Holy shit.
- Oh shit!

1414
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,346
[tires squealing]

1415
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,810
[explosion]
- Oh, shit!

1416
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,103
- Get inside!
- What the fuck was that?

1417
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:26,105
- Come on!
- Fuck this shit!

1418
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:28,148
- Goddamn it!
- Oh, shit!

1419
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:33,195
It's a bomb!

1420
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,325
What the hell is happening?

1421
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,119
Hey, Ron, I-I don't
know this scene.

1422
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,120
Where is it in the script?

1423
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,414
It is not in the fucking script!

1424
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,790
- No, no, no.
Tell me you're kidding.

1425
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:46,417
Tell me that was just a stunt.

1426
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,043
That we did not just watch
Josh Hartnett explode!

1427
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:51,297
- It is not a stunt!
It is not in the script!

1428
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,549
Josh Hartnett is dead!

1429
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:57,136
Oh, god, I've fucked up.
I've fucked up!

1430
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:58,512
What the fuck is goin' on?

1431
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,222
- I can't.
- What the fuck is goin' on?

1432
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:01,265
[speaking with British accent]
- O-okay, Kevin.

1433
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:02,975
Don't-Don't be mad.
Don't be mad.

1434
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:05,060
But this whole thing,

1435
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:06,937
aside from what just
happened to Josh Hartnett,

1436
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:08,605
has-has been scripted.

1437
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:09,648
What the fuck is that accent?

1438
01:00:09,732 --> 01:00:11,108
I was acting, I'm sorry!

1439
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,319
I'm not from Chicago,
I'm from Essex!

1440
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:15,904
Claude Van De Velde wanted you
at your most authentic,

1441
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:18,532
so he hid a bunch
of cameras in here

1442
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,617
to film us playing roles,
doing the stunts,

1443
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:21,952
all of it.

1444
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:23,495
But whatever just happened
wasn't part of it.

1445
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,789
Which is fucking insane, Ron!
For fuck's sake!

1446
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:27,249
For fuck's sake?

1447
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,459
That's what you wanna say to me?

1448
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,127
For fuck's sake?

1449
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:38,719
[speaking foreign language]

1450
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,138
- Talk in your regular voice.
- All right.

1451
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,640
No, I've lost it now.
I'm in my head!

1452
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:46,393
- Who does that?
Who does this to somebody?

1453
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:49,271
[grunts] [gunfire]

1454
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,783
Oh, shit. You okay?

1455
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:04,620
- Oh, god.
I'm such a fucking idiot!

1456
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,498
What was I thinking?
- What the hell was that, man?

1457
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:08,916
You want to know
what the hell is going on?

1458
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,042
You're goddamn right
I wanna know what's going on.

1459
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,585
I bought some drugs.

1460
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,380
I sold them to the wrong people.
- What?

1461
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:17,091
And Rodrigo got mad at me
and we got into a fight.

1462
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,301
And then, I accidentally
killed him.

1463
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:20,928
- You did kill Rodrigo.
- Yes.

1464
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,304
I told you
he fuckin' killed him.

1465
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:24,765
- And that necklace.
That necklace was his necklace.

1466
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,683
I'm a horrible person.

1467
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:28,852
I'm going straight to hell.

1468
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:30,646
You're goddamn right
you're going to hell.

1469
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:32,064
What are you doing?
- Claude!

1470
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:34,024
- What are you doin', Ron?
- Claude!

1471
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:37,069
Claude, if you're watchin',
you call the cops right now.

1472
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:38,904
You call the fuckin cops.

1473
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:41,365
Senor Wilcox!

1474
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,033
Oh, shit.

1475
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:44,785
My nephew Rodrigo's body
washed up

1476
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,287
4 miles due south of here!

1477
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:50,124
A coincidence, no?

1478
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,167
I'm gonna give you 2 minutes.

1479
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,212
Exactly dos minutos
to bring your ass out here

1480
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,588
and face me like a man!

1481
01:01:56,672 --> 01:01:59,174
If not, I'm gonna set fire
to the building

1482
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:00,676
and burn you like a chicharone.

1483
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:03,345
[whimpering]

1484
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:06,306
- Snap out of it!
- I can't! It's over!

1485
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,975
Listen to me, motherfucker.

1486
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,644
This is why men shouldn't be
left in charge of anything!

1487
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,397
My career is just now
becoming the thing

1488
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,442
that I have worked
my entire life towards!

1489
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:18,902
And I'm not dying because
of you, you fucking idiot.

1490
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:21,071
We're all gonna die!

1491
01:02:21,155 --> 01:02:23,740
[scream]

1492
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:26,034
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck, man?

1493
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:28,120
Everybody gotta
calm the fuck down!

1494
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,330
They're all blanks.

1495
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:32,332
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- Don't hit me.

1496
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,543
I'm not gonna hit you. Look.

1497
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:37,463
When I first walked through
that door, you told me.

1498
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:38,755
You said, "Kevin..."

1499
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:40,966
You said an action hero
is not in here.

1500
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,469
You said it's not in here.
- Uh-huh.

1501
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:45,179
You said that it's here.

1502
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,055
It's in your heart, man.

1503
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:49,600
You know, clearly,
you done made some mistakes.

1504
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,518
And one of those mistakes
involved murderin'

1505
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:53,270
the nephew of some kind
of drug lord.

1506
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,147
[wailing]
- Oh, god.

1507
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,815
I killed him!

1508
01:02:56,899 --> 01:02:58,984
I'm not tryin' to
fuckin' upset you, man.

1509
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,195
Listen. I know that you know.

1510
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:04,490
I know that you know that
there's an action hero in there.

1511
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:07,618
And I know that a true
action hero is-is-is tough.

1512
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:08,869
Is confident.

1513
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:11,163
And they're unfazed
by the minor details

1514
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:13,415
that disrupt
your average lay person.

1515
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:16,835
They will take responsibility
for their shit.

1516
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:19,213
You go out there
and you tell the truth, man.

1517
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:21,256
Tell the fucking truth.

1518
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,967
Say Rodrigo's death...
Say it was an accident.

1519
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:26,220
Say it was a fucking accident.
And give 'em...

1520
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,180
Give 'em this. Here.

1521
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,431
You give 'em this,

1522
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:31,141
say you wanna make things right.

1523
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:32,267
- I wanna make it right.
- That's all you gotta do!

1524
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,936
Say I wanna make it right.
I'm sorry.

1525
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,437
I fucked up.
- I fucked up.

1526
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:37,481
- I wanna tell the truth.
- I wanna tell the truth.

1527
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,358
- That's it!
- I don't wanna make a mistake.

1528
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:40,484
Okay, listen.

1529
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,111
All you gotta do
is be the action hero

1530
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:46,657
that you wanna see in the world.

1531
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,951
Thank you.

1532
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,869
Thank you.

1533
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:52,454
Tell the truth, man.

1534
01:03:58,168 --> 01:03:59,586
That was amazing.

1535
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:06,593
Amigos!

1536
01:04:06,677 --> 01:04:07,719
Amigos.

1537
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:09,221
Peace. Peace.

1538
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:10,722
Paz.

1539
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:12,057
Paz. Paz.

1540
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,058
Paz. Paz. Paz. Uh...

1541
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:15,686
Shit, it's actually working.

1542
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:18,105
Kevin, did you just
save our lives?

1543
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:20,440
No. I just know
that being the hero

1544
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,985
means ownin' up
to your mistakes.

1545
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:26,029
I had to learn
the same thing in my life.

1546
01:04:26,113 --> 01:04:28,991
Just glad that Ron can
learn the same thing too.

1547
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,245
