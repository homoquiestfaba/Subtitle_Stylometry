I'll say good night, then.

351
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,398
- Good night.
- DAISY: Night.

352
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,538
Forgot the paper
after all that. (chuckles)

353
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,474
Memory like a sieve.

354
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:24,343
DAISY:
Night.

355
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,581
Remember,
it's his farm, not ours.

356
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:30,683
It's Lord Grantham's farm,
and he's only the tenant.

357
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,285
Maybe.

358
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:33,495
But don't say anything
you'll regret.

359
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,022
That's the problem.

360
00:16:35,055 --> 00:16:38,324
I'm bound to in the end,
and then where will we be?

361
00:16:38,357 --> 00:16:40,661
Murray's had
the will translated.

362
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:45,432
Apparently, Montmirail refers
to an idyllic interlude

363
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:48,737
he spent with Mama as a young
man before he was married.

364
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,571
What else did Murray
have to say?

365
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:51,773
Why, it's odd.

366
00:16:51,806 --> 00:16:53,640
The widow wants
to fight the will,

367
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:56,477
but the son believes it can be
settled in a friendly way.

368
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,346
I'd cover the villa with barbed
wire and board up the windows.

369
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:01,682
(chuckles) He says he'd like us
to visit him there.

370
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:03,350
Now, clearly Mama can't travel,

371
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:05,452
but he asked us to bring
Tom and Lucy with us

372
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:07,621
now that he knows
Sybbie is to be the beneficiary.

373
00:17:07,654 --> 00:17:08,857
What do you think?

374
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,558
Well, we could
get to know Lucy better.

375
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:13,293
And with any luck, it would mean

376
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:15,662
we'd miss the whole
of Mary's frightful film.

377
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:18,565
I found it. Myrna Dalgleish.

378
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,634
I knew I had a good one of her.

379
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,636
Her beauty is so classic.

380
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:24,571
I've got one of him.

381
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:27,641
Guy Dexter in <i>Casanova.</i>

382
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:28,853
The very thought of it
makes me blush.

383
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:30,544
There is something about him.

384
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:31,856
Like a wild animal
ready to spring.

385
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,447
Ready to spring on you,
you mean.

She's living with them

395

We can all stay in an hotel.

396

In that case, can we come?

397

And me.

401
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:08,558
I've been thinking about
an article on the people

402

403

Are you writing again?
I'm pleased.

404

00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,924
My father, Lord Grantham.

523
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,860
She is one of the stars
of our film.

524
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,128
I can easily believe it.

525
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,063
Welcome to Down ton,
Miss Dalgleish.

526
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,731
(giggles)

527
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:20,932
Mm.

528
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:26,938
The modern world
comes to Down ton.

529
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,950
You've told our host in France
that we're staying at an hotel?

530
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,442
ROBERT:
Oh, he wouldn't hear of it.

531
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,177
He insists we stay at the villa.

532
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,012
Even though we're there
to steal it from them?

533
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,923
He seems a very nice chap,
and his English is flawless,

534
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,283
which is more than can be said
for my French. (chuckles)

535
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,051
Mr. Guy Dexter.

536
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:43,255
ROBERT:
Welcome, Mr. Dexter.

537
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,823
I'm Lord Grantham.

538
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,858
This is my daughter,
Lady Mary Talbot.

539
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,160
She'll look after you,

540
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,162
as the rest of us
are off to the Riviera.

541
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,696
But I hope
you'll enjoy yourself here.

542
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,166
I'd come with you if I could.

543
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,301
- You're English?
- Yes.

544
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,837
I went over to America
ten years ago to try my luck,

545
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,047
and I've been there ever since.

546
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,773
- Hmm.
- I'm not the only one.

547
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,241
They call us the Hollywood Raj,

548
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,777
and we all play cricket
once a week.

549
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,321
And the weather
never stops play. (chuckles)

550
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,047
Do you know the south of France?

551
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,925
Last time I was there,
I was marooned on the roof

552
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,218
of the Negresco with Ronald
Colman and Gloria Swanson.

553
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,886
On the roof?

554
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,330
You can tell us the rest
of that story at dinner.

555
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,156
- When are you leaving?
- ROBERT: Tomorrow.

556
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,126
Uh, Dover, Calais and then
the Blue Train down to Nice.

557
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,061
How enviable that sounds.

558
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,896
When do you expect
your director?

559
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,098
Oh, he'll be here for dinner.
Don't you think, Myrna?

560
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,134
(Cockney accent):
How should I know?

561
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:33,205
("Everything Has Changed
But You" playing)

562
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,974
Myrna Dalgleish in this house.

563
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,876
It seems incredible.

564
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,144
ANNA:
Her dad sold fruit

565
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,912
in the old Borough Market.
Now look at her.

566
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,782
A goddess of the screen.

567
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,850
And you're going to be her maid.

568
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,352
She's brought
a mountain of luggage,

569
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,821
so I thought you and Anna
could go together right now

570
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,756
and offer to unpack.

571
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,534
BATES: Just remember,
neither of you know this woman.

572
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,362
She may not be the film star
you see in the fan magazines.

573
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:59,298

one way to find out. (chuckles)

I'm sorry to burst in on you.

580
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,913
Not at all.

581
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,224
The fact is
I've made a new will,

582
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:17,216
and I need you both
to witness my signature.

583
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,918
I'm just fussing.

584
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,786
It's only my jewelry
and a few other pieces.

585
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,060
It's always a good idea to
bring these things up to date.

586
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,557
CORA:
Murray was down anyway,

587
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,959
so I thought I would
take advantage of that.

588
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:29,862
I'm glad you've come,
because I wanted to tell you

589
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,964
that Violet has asked us
to go through her things.

590
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:33,966
What? Why has she asked you?

591
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,569
I really don't know, but,
of course, anything of interest

592
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:39,338
will be referred
to Robert and you.

593
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,307
I just thought
you ought to be told.

594
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,143
Well, she wants her death to be
ordered and free of bother.

595
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,978
It's all
very Violet-like, really.

596
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:48,180
- Are we wrong to go to France?
- Oh, certainly not.

597
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:50,816
Mary can send a telegram

598
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,219
if there are
any dark developments.

599
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,154
But there won't be.

600
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,290
I don't pretend I've always
worshipped at her shrine,

601
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,025
but it will be strange.

602
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,960
And Mary will miss her
when she's gone.

603
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,428
Mary will become her,

604
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,897
- so the gap will be filled.
- (chuckles softly)

605
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,198
And now I must run.

606
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,034
I'm making dinner late
by being here.

607
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,971
I'll see you when we get back.

608
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,406
Yes, of course.

609
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,876
She's right.
It will be strange.

610
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,914
I shall miss having a sparring
partner to keep me trim.

611
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:24,117
Be careful how you handle
them clothes.

612
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:26,053
They're haute couture.

613
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,922
I should go to Lady Mary and
Lady Hexham to help them dress,

614
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:30,433
so I'll leave Daisy
with the unpacking.

615
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:32,192
I'll be back
when you're at dinner.

616
00:26:32,225 --> 00:26:33,860
So long as it's finished

617
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,414
and the trunks are gone
when I come up.

618
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,035
What were you doing
on the roof of the Negresco?

619
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:44,213
Oh, it was a scavenger hunt,
and we needed a chimney pot.

620
00:26:44,237 --> 00:26:47,007
But when we got up there,
they were huge,

621
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,318
so we smashed one
and all took a piece.

622
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:51,411
(chuckles):
Oh, was the manager pleased?

623
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:53,080
Well, it was good publicity.

624
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:55,215
Is there such a thing
as good publicity?

625
00:26:55,248 --> 00:26:57,317
There is
if you're in the movies.

626
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:59,953
Well, I suppose the Russians
smash their glasses

627
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,355
for good luck.

628
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:04,157
And now film people
smash other people's property

629
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:06,326
for good publicity. (chuckles)

630
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,328
Is this true, Miss Dalgleish?

631
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:10,230
Oh, I don't do nothing
unless I feel like it.

632
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:12,032
Oh, how musical
you make it sound.

633
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,235
Hold the plate nearer.

634
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:19,139
How did you become
a film actress?

635
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:21,241
A talent scout spotted me.

636
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:23,443
Because I'm so beautiful.

637
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:26,380
(chuckles)
It seems wonderfully romantic.

638
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:27,457
Well, it's not that romantic.

639
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,116
Not when you know that every man

640
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:31,017
in the room
just wants to give you one.

641
00:27:32,552 --> 00:27:35,389
What a colorful life you lead.

642
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:37,057
(Robert clears throat)

643
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,126
H-Have you made
many kinematographs

644
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,394
traveling around the country?

645
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:42,262
I'm afraid I'm rather glad
to be missing it.

646
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:43,940
Well, I know you're only
doing it for the money,

647
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:45,098
but that's all right.

648
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,968
(gulps)

649
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,937
What I never understand is how
you remember all those lines.

650
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:52,305
Well, it's not theater.

651
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,475
In fact, I'm not even sure
it's proper acting.

652
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:56,010
Oh, but isn't that
about to change?

653
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,945
Aren't films starting to talk?

654
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:00,391
Couple of words here or there.
Nothing to frighten the horses.

658
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:10,391
that the servants work hard
in this house

659
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:12,026
and they are doing their best?

660
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,361
They're not used to rudeness.

661
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:15,163
Well, she's not
used to criticism.

662

00:44:57,341 --> 00:45:00,111
It makes you look like
King Zog of Albania.

1044
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:02,947
(softly):
Yeah.

1045
00:45:04,348 --> 00:45:05,349
Oh, perfect.

1046
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:07,351
Oh. No, no, no.

1047
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:08,453
I wouldn't hear of it.

1048
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:10,321
It was my choice,
so I should pay.

1049
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:12,323
Yeah, but I'm the one
who has to wear it.

1050
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:13,424
Um...

1051
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,993
Thanks for your custom, sir.

1052
00:45:16,027 --> 00:45:17,328
Both you and your wife.

1053
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:23,034
(Maud laughs softly)

1054
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:25,069
(Carson groans)

1055
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:26,480
If you were selling menswear
when you first

1056
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:29,073
got to Hollywood,
how did you break into films?

1057
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:31,309
Well, one day, they asked me
to pose for a trade journal

1058
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:33,077
in a suit
that they were marketing,

1059
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,146
and an agent came
and signed me up.

1060
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:37,216
- Because you're so handsome.
- Oh.

1061
00:45:37,249 --> 00:45:39,351
I thought they were excited
by my acting talent.

1062
00:45:39,384 --> 00:45:41,320
- (laughter)
- Come on, girls. Get to wardrobe.

1063
00:45:41,353 --> 00:45:43,322
We all want to go home.

1064
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,158
Now you know
why I'm in the movies.

1065
00:45:46,191 --> 00:45:47,459
How did you become a butler?

1066
00:45:47,493 --> 00:45:49,228
Well, it's a lot less glamorous.

1067
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:50,629
I got a job as a hall boy.

1068
00:45:50,662 --> 00:45:53,465
Then I was a junior footman,
first footman, valet

1069
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:55,267
and finally butler.

1070
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,478
There's not much
I couldn't tell you

1071
00:45:56,502 --> 00:45:58,203
about how to run a house, sir.

1072
00:45:58,237 --> 00:45:59,647
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

1073
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:02,074
I don't know what I'm doing
half the time.

1074
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:03,509
That's not what it looks like.

1075
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:07,112
Oh, thank you, Mr...?

1076
00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:09,214
Just Barrow, sir.

1077
00:46:09,248 --> 00:46:10,382
BARBER:
Right, Guy.

1078
00:46:10,415 --> 00:46:12,417
Let's rehearse please.

1079
00:46:16,388 --> 00:46:18,423
Myrna, say the line.

1080
00:46:19,691 --> 00:46:21,426
I saved you a mallet.

1081
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,663
I always think they look like
instruments of war.

1082
00:46:24,696 --> 00:46:26,131
It's because they are.

1083
00:46:26,164 --> 00:46:28,066
There's a telephone call
for you.

1084
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,102
A Mr. Bullock.
He says it's urgent.

1085
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:32,304
Five minutes, everyone!

1086
00:46:33,572 --> 00:46:35,440
ISOBEL:
<i>There's a drama going on below.</i>

1087
00:46:35,474 --> 00:46:37,285
The man in charge was
shouting down the telephone

1088
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:39,077
when I came up.

1089
00:46:39,111 --> 00:46:41,280
Apparently, they're making
the wrong sort of film.

1090
00:46:41,313 --> 00:46:42,681
Is there a right sort?

1091
00:46:42,714 --> 00:46:44,416
Well, all I know is

1092
00:46:44,449 --> 00:46:47,419
it seems the public
only want films that talk.

1093
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:49,454
I should've thought
the best thing about films

1094
00:46:49,488 --> 00:46:51,623
- is that you can't hear them.
- (chuckles)

1095
00:46:51,657 --> 00:46:54,159
Be even better if
you couldn't see them either.

1096
00:46:54,192 --> 00:46:55,561
(both laughing)

1097
00:46:55,594 --> 00:46:57,095
Everybody,
gather around, please!

1098
00:46:57,129 --> 00:46:59,431

1099
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:01,400

1100
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:04,136
- We are suspending production.
- (people groaning)

1101
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:05,437
I-I know. I know.

1102
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,439
I'm sorry to be
the bearer of bad news.

1103
00:47:07,472 --> 00:47:10,108
We'll contact you all
when we've finalized our plans.

1104
00:47:10,142 --> 00:47:11,610
- Thank you.
- (indistinct chatter)

1105
00:47:11,643 --> 00:47:14,714
What is it? What's happened?

1106
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,482
Well, it seems the talkies are

1107
00:47:16,516 --> 00:47:18,551
making too much money
to ignore, while our picture

1108
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,154
is silent and too expensive
to make its costs back,

1109
00:47:21,187 --> 00:47:23,623
so they want to cut
their losses and shut us down.

1110
00:47:23,656 --> 00:47:26,159
- But how sad.
- It is worse than sad

1111
00:47:26,192 --> 00:47:27,503
for the men and women
working on it.

1112
00:47:27,527 --> 00:47:29,329
We still owe our extras
back pay,

1113
00:47:29,362 --> 00:47:31,631
and now they're out of a job.

1114
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:34,434
- I told you. I...
- Excuse me.

1115

1116

W-Why is he stopping?

1117
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:40,607
Apparently, silent films
aren't making any money now.

1118
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,241
I saw it the other night.

1119
00:47:42,275 --> 00:47:43,610
The cinema was almost empty.

1120
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:44,711
What a shame.

1121
00:47:44,744 --> 00:47:46,446
I feel sorry for Mr. Barber.

1122
00:47:46,479 --> 00:47:48,348
- He doesn't deserve this.
- MYRNA: Enough.

We're making a silent.

1127
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:59,525
They only want to release
talkies, so...

1128
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:01,670
Well, why couldn't this be
turned into a talking film?

1129
00:48:01,694 --> 00:48:03,931
What would that mean?

1130
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,666
Getting a technician down
from London.

1131
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:08,267

we've already made and...

1133

In the years since 1864,

1182
00:50:34,682 --> 00:50:37,485
the late Marquis de Montmirail
made four wills.

1183
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:39,687
In every one,
he refers to the fact

1184
00:50:39,721 --> 00:50:41,523
that he gave
the Villa des Colombes

1185
00:50:41,556 --> 00:50:44,827

of Grantham in 1865.

In gratitude for your birth.

1216
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:59,935
In short, I believe you and I
have a great deal in common.

1217
00:52:08,812 --> 00:52:11,714
- (both laughing)
- (seabirds screeching)

1218
00:52:14,951 --> 00:52:17,386
- We should thank old Lady Grantham.
- Of course.

1219
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:20,489
At least now we know
that for her to have the villa

1220
00:52:20,522 --> 00:52:22,691
wasn't a random choice
or a foolish mistake

1221
00:52:22,725 --> 00:52:26,495
but a decision that was firmly
endorsed over many years.

1222
00:52:26,528 --> 00:52:28,765
Feels funny, in a way,
to know my own child is

1223
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:30,776
part of this golden circle
where, because of your blood,

1224
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,635
lovely things happen.

1225
00:52:32,668 --> 00:52:35,504
Just as Mary will have Down ton
and we will have Brompton.

1226
00:52:35,537 --> 00:52:36,907
Yes, but they're
working estates.

1227
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,009
This place was made
for laughter and fun.

1228
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:42,611
Wouldn't Sybil have been
pleased for her daughter?

1229
00:52:43,712 --> 00:52:46,783
And encouraged her to use it
for the good of others?

1230
00:52:46,816 --> 00:52:49,052
Yes, I think she would.

1231
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:50,653
Then let's do the same.

1232
00:52:50,686 --> 00:52:52,789
I long to bring Sybbie here.

1233
00:52:52,822 --> 00:52:54,891
She'll love it.

1234
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:56,725
(sighs) Look at that view.

1235
00:52:58,862 --> 00:53:01,865
Don't you feel grateful
we're alive?

1236
00:53:01,898 --> 00:53:03,565
I love you, you know.

1237
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,536
In a way I thought
I'd never love again.

1238
00:53:07,569 --> 00:53:09,505
And I love you.

1239
00:53:09,538 --> 00:53:10,840
So that's all right.

1240

- EDITH: Mm.

It's thrilling for Sybbie,
for all of them.

1244
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,956
I like the idea of Tom and Lucy

1245
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:28,557
hosting a gathering here
every summer,

1246
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,027
until it becomes
a family tradition.

1247

1248
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:34,730
The sun has made me sleepy.

1249
00:53:34,764 --> 00:53:38,869
If you'll excuse me, I think
I'll have a nap before dinner.

1250
00:53:38,903 --> 00:53:41,272
You look a little tired, too.

1251

Why don't you do the same?

I won't be too long.

1253

Never sure how helpful it is
for people to point it out.

Oh, I'm sorry.

you, please just say it.

the dinner table again,

1261
00:54:12,635 --> 00:54:14,147
but I think they've got
the hang of ironing

1262
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:16,539
His Lordship's shirts at last.

1263
00:54:16,573 --> 00:54:18,608
You should've let me do that.

1264
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:20,053
They must be very grateful
for your help, Mr. Carson.

1265

CARSON:
Well, maybe.

1266

When I showed them how to do it,

1267
00:54:23,047 --> 00:54:25,816
they certainly spoke a lot of
French very loud and very fast.

1268
00:54:26,817 --> 00:54:28,886
Is anything settled yet?

1269
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:31,989
It seems the villa
now belongs to Miss Sybbie.

1270
00:54:32,023 --> 00:54:33,758
Lucky girl.

1271
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:35,059
Do you envy her, Miss Baxter?

1272
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:37,328
I'm not a big believer in envy,
Mr. Bates.

1273
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:39,997
I know what I want,
and I can live without

1274

What do you want, Miss Baxter?

1276

Oh, come now, Mr. Carson.

1277
00:54:45,735 --> 00:54:47,080
We all know
what Miss Baxter wants.

1278
00:54:47,104 --> 00:54:49,774
Her affections are
very firmly engaged.

1279
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:51,342
Not engaged.

1280
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:55,913
Not engaged in that way,
perhaps, but thoroughly taken.

1281
00:54:55,946 --> 00:54:58,182
Are we discussing Mr. Molesley?

1282
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:00,650
We are.

1283
00:55:00,683 --> 00:55:02,685
But suppose he never
steps up to the mark?

1284
00:55:03,686 --> 00:55:06,090
Then I will be a spinster.

1285
00:55:06,123 --> 00:55:07,825
You'd never marry anyone else?

1287
00:55:09,193 --> 00:55:11,694
It took me long enough
to find him.

Madame.

1289
00:55:19,037 --> 00:55:21,807
I don't know how long
he's thought about it,

1290
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,942
but once he checked the dates,
he was sure.

1291
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:27,145
I was born exactly nine months
after... and I quote...

1292
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:29,713
The "idyllic interlude"
they spent together.

1293
00:55:29,747 --> 00:55:31,783
And he gave her the villa
soon after I was born.

1294
00:55:31,817 --> 00:55:33,094
I'm sure that's all coincidence.

1295

Are you?

1296

1386
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,208
(people chuckling, murmuring)

1387
00:59:19,346 --> 00:59:21,181
Well done.

1388
00:59:21,214 --> 00:59:22,616
Miss Dalgleish.

1389
00:59:22,649 --> 00:59:24,217
Ready.

1390
00:59:28,355 --> 00:59:29,389
(Barber clears throat)

1391
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:32,859
(Myrna clears throat)

1392
00:59:32,893 --> 00:59:35,195
(bell jingles)

1393
00:59:35,228 --> 00:59:37,397
BARBER:
And action.

1394
00:59:41,034 --> 00:59:42,369
"I knew where you'd be.

1395
00:59:42,402 --> 00:59:44,871
I only came to..."

1396
00:59:44,905 --> 00:59:46,416
Hang on a minute.
I turned me head round there.

1397
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,141
- You...
- Oh, y-yes.

1398
00:59:48,175 --> 00:59:50,944
I-I've written a line
to cover that. You see?

1399
00:59:50,977 --> 00:59:53,447
"I've only come to stop you
throwing away your future."

1400
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,183
You... y-you turn back
on "future."

1401
00:59:56,216 --> 00:59:57,384
Right.

1402
00:59:59,319 --> 01:00:00,987
(Myrna clears throat)

1403
01:00:01,021 --> 01:00:03,223
- BARBER: And action.
- (camera rattling)

1404
01:00:05,426 --> 01:00:07,228
MYRNA:
"I knew where you'd be.

1405
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:09,306
I've only come to stop you
throwing away your future."

1406
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:12,100
- Louder, Miss Dalgleish!
- (sighs)

1407
01:00:12,133 --> 01:00:15,269
(louder): "I can't stay
and watch you ruin yourself.

1408
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:19,173
- Um, I must..."
- Cut. Cut.

1409
01:00:19,207 --> 01:00:20,942
Thank you, Myrna.
Could I have a moment?

1410
01:00:22,343 --> 01:00:25,046
- (clears throat)
- GUY: You all right?

1411
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,481
(smacks lips) Now what?

1412
01:00:26,514 --> 01:00:28,416
- Mr. Stubbins?
- Oh, I am here to record sound,

1413
01:00:28,449 --> 01:00:30,952
- Mr. Barber, not to perform miracles.
- (sighs)

1414
01:00:30,985 --> 01:00:32,920
The Lady Anne Erskine
she is not.

1415
01:00:32,954 --> 01:00:34,465
Couldn't she just learn
the accent a bit better

1416
01:00:34,489 --> 01:00:36,190
- and do it again?
- (sighs)

1417
01:00:36,224 --> 01:00:37,401
People spend lives
trying to learn

1418
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,093
this particular accent
and failing.

1419
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:40,304
George Bernard Shaw
wrote a play about it.

1420
01:00:40,328 --> 01:00:43,131
Uh, you could do it, milady.

1421
01:00:43,164 --> 01:00:45,400
You saw how Mr. Dexter managed.

1422
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,001
It can't be that hard.

1423
01:00:47,034 --> 01:00:48,536
- But I couldn't.
- What?

1424
01:00:48,569 --> 01:00:50,138
You couldn't do the accent?

1425
01:00:50,171 --> 01:00:52,273
I think you could.
I think you do.

1426
01:00:52,306 --> 01:00:55,209
- But I'm not an actress.
- Well, is Myrna an actress?

1427
01:00:55,243 --> 01:00:56,978
Are you keen to see
her Hedda Gabler?

1428
01:00:57,011 --> 01:00:58,112
- (coughs)
- Even so.

1429
01:00:58,146 --> 01:00:59,714
Look, just-just try it.

1430
01:00:59,747 --> 01:01:02,016
If you can't do it, we'll
shut down, possibly for good.

1431
01:01:02,049 --> 01:01:05,453
If you can,
you'll allow us to keep going.

1432
01:01:05,486 --> 01:01:07,288
Please.

1433
01:01:07,321 --> 01:01:09,457
(quietly): How do we deal
with Miss Dalgleish?

1434
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,193
Oh, right now, um,
get her back upstairs.

1435
01:01:12,226 --> 01:01:13,537
- We need to know if this is gonna work.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1436
01:01:13,561 --> 01:01:16,497
- I'll do that.
- Mm-hmm. (clears throat)

1437
01:01:16,531 --> 01:01:18,266
MRS. HUGHES:
Miss Dalgleish?

1438
01:01:23,438 --> 01:01:25,549
- Here are the lines, milady.
- (clears throat) Thank you.

1439
01:01:25,573 --> 01:01:27,475
I don't know how I get myself
into these things.

1440
01:01:36,451 --> 01:01:38,486
"I knew where you'd be.

1441
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:42,458
"I've only come to stop you
throwing away your future.

1442
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:46,495
"I can't stay
and watch you ruin yourself.

1443
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:48,363
I must."

1444
01:01:49,364 --> 01:01:50,332
And cut.

1445
01:01:50,365 --> 01:01:51,500
Play them together.

1446
01:01:56,438 --> 01:01:58,474
(dramatic orchestral music
playing)

1447
01:02:01,577 --> 01:02:03,579
(Guy's voice):
Well, if it isn't Lady Anne.

1448
01:02:03,612 --> 01:02:05,314
I thought you might find me.

1449
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,349
No one can keep a secret
these days.

1450
01:02:07,382 --> 01:02:09,351
(Mary's voice):
I knew where you'd be.

1451
01:02:09,384 --> 01:02:12,321
I've only come to stop you
throwing away your future.

1452
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:15,090
May I remind you
it's my future to throw away.

1453
01:02:16,592 --> 01:02:20,128
I can't stay
and watch you ruin yourself.

1454
01:02:20,162 --> 01:02:21,497
No, wait.

1455
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,098
Don't go.

1456
01:02:24,132 --> 01:02:25,400
I must.

1457
01:02:28,237 --> 01:02:31,373
- (applause)
- Oh.

1458
01:02:31,406 --> 01:02:33,509
(laughter)

1459
01:02:42,417 --> 01:02:45,053
I do hope that was a prop.

1460
01:02:45,855 --> 01:02:47,523
When was it painted?

1461
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:49,491
And why was she his adored one?

1462
01:02:49,525 --> 01:02:51,493
Because she granted
the ultimate favor?

1463
01:02:51,527 --> 01:02:53,395
They were only together
for a few days.

1464
01:02:53,428 --> 01:02:54,563
Does it sound likely?

1465
01:02:54,596 --> 01:02:56,265
And it's just a coincidence

1466
01:02:56,298 --> 01:02:58,500
that Papa was born
nine months later?

1467
01:02:58,534 --> 01:03:00,235
I expect, when she got home,

1468
01:03:00,269 --> 01:03:02,504
your grandpapa was
jolly pleased to see her.

1469
01:03:02,538 --> 01:03:04,415
- (Bertie and Lucy laugh)
- Anyway, what's clear is

1470
01:03:04,439 --> 01:03:06,408
Monsieur de Montmirail
was madly in love with her.

1471
01:03:06,441 --> 01:03:08,510
- When did he marry?
- BERTIE: Oh, I know that.

1472
01:03:08,544 --> 01:03:09,545
I looked him up.

1473
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:11,179
He married in 1870,

1474
01:03:11,213 --> 01:03:13,248
five years after
Robert was born.

1475
01:03:13,282 --> 01:03:16,084
And the present marquis
arrived in 1873.

1476
01:03:16,118 --> 01:03:17,630
So the villa was
a sort of parting gift

1477
01:03:17,654 --> 01:03:20,223
to your grandmother before
he looked around for a wife.

1478
01:03:20,256 --> 01:03:21,424
That's what it sounds like.

1479
01:03:21,457 --> 01:03:23,092
Evidently.

1480
01:03:26,129 --> 01:03:28,097
DAISY:
<i>I'm gonna sound him out.</i>

1481
01:03:28,131 --> 01:03:30,300
- About Mrs. Patmore.
- You can't.

1482
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,101
I can.

1483
01:03:32,135 --> 01:03:33,670
You know she's got
a house of her own.

1484
01:03:33,703 --> 01:03:35,305
You know she's lonely.

1485
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:37,373
It's a solution for all of us.

1486
01:03:38,374 --> 01:03:40,209
You look very conspiratorial.

1487
01:03:40,243 --> 01:03:41,578
We were talking about
Mrs. Patmore

1488
01:03:41,611 --> 01:03:43,212
and how much she likes you.

1489
01:03:43,246 --> 01:03:44,547
Does she indeed?

1490
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:46,449
Well, I like her.

1491
01:03:46,482 --> 01:03:48,318
- She's a fine woman.
- She is.

1492
01:03:48,351 --> 01:03:50,587
But I worry sometimes
that she's lonely.

1493
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,388
She's got her own cottage,
of course,

1494
01:03:52,422 --> 01:03:54,357
but I think she'd like
some company in it.

1495
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:56,125
(chuckles)

1496
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:59,128
I know what you're thinking,
but the answer's no.

1497
01:03:59,162 --> 01:04:00,597
You've always said
you admired her.

1498
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,131
And so I do.

1499
01:04:02,165 --> 01:04:03,375
But I couldn't live off a woman.

1500
01:04:03,399 --> 01:04:05,201
It wouldn't be right.

1501
01:04:05,234 --> 01:04:07,370
- Even if she wanted it?
- Even then.

1502
01:04:07,403 --> 01:04:08,614
There are things that are right

1503
01:04:08,638 --> 01:04:10,239
and there are things
that are wrong,

1504
01:04:10,273 --> 01:04:11,507
and I can't change that.

1505
01:04:15,612 --> 01:04:17,347
Thank you for taking it on.

1506
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,615
I owe you a great deal.

1507
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:20,216
Is everything in order?

1508
01:04:20,249 --> 01:04:21,919
Well, (sighs)
once we've recorded sound

1509
01:04:21,952 --> 01:04:23,453
for the scenes
we've already shot,

1510
01:04:23,486 --> 01:04:25,622
we'll need new material
for what's left...

1511
01:04:25,655 --> 01:04:27,290
MOLESLEY:
Ooh.

1512
01:04:28,391 --> 01:04:30,526
M-May I have a word, Mr. Barber?

1513
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,261
Of course.

1514
01:04:32,295 --> 01:04:33,773
I-I've been through
all the dialogue cards

1515
01:04:33,797 --> 01:04:35,775
that w-would've been shown
if the picture were silent,

1516
01:04:35,799 --> 01:04:38,334
and I've started
to sketch out scenes

1517
01:04:38,368 --> 01:04:40,169
that would cover
the needs of the plot.

1518
01:04:40,203 --> 01:04:41,313
You mean you've written a play?

1519
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:43,239
Well, I've started one.

1520
01:04:43,272 --> 01:04:44,683
- Could I read these scenes?
- Of course.

1521
01:04:44,707 --> 01:04:47,410
And if you're content,
I'll do the rest.

1522
01:04:49,545 --> 01:04:52,315
Am I bound by the plot synopsis?

1523
01:04:53,684 --> 01:04:56,720
For instance,
when she finally casts him off,

1524
01:04:56,754 --> 01:04:59,657
might it not be better
with a big romantic climax?

1525
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:01,225
I don't understand.

1526
01:05:01,258 --> 01:05:02,660
Well, Bill Benson's

1527
01:05:02,693 --> 01:05:05,396
about to throw away his life
on the tables.

1528
01:05:05,429 --> 01:05:09,768
Alone, hollow and without hope.

1529
01:05:11,468 --> 01:05:13,270
Then suddenly he lifts his face

1530
01:05:13,303 --> 01:05:15,673
and sees Anne standing there,
tall, serene, graceful,

1531
01:05:15,706 --> 01:05:20,979
her eyes shining
with unshed tears.

1532
01:05:21,012 --> 01:05:22,981
On an impulse,
he snatches back his money.

1533
01:05:23,014 --> 01:05:25,416
<i>Rien ne va plus!</i>

1534
01:05:25,449 --> 01:05:26,717
The wheel spins.

1535
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,286
(whooshing)

1536
01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:33,190
(imitates roulette wheel
clicking to a stop)

1537
01:05:35,659 --> 01:05:39,998
And every last thing he owns
would have gone.

1538
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:41,632
But no.

1539
01:05:41,665 --> 01:05:45,804
Her love, her beauty
have saved him.

1540
01:05:47,304 --> 01:05:50,407
She takes his hand,
and they walk away.

1541
01:05:51,408 --> 01:05:52,543
Together.

1542
01:05:52,576 --> 01:05:54,344
The end.

1543
01:05:55,646 --> 01:05:57,514
I think I'm going to cry.

1544
01:05:57,548 --> 01:06:01,351
Mr. Molesley,
please finish the script

1545
01:06:01,385 --> 01:06:02,863
however you think best
and bring it to me.

1546
01:06:02,887 --> 01:06:04,388
Right.

1547
01:06:07,591 --> 01:06:10,327
- You say he used to work here?
- MARY: Yes.

1548
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,329
He was a footman.

1549
01:06:12,362 --> 01:06:14,598
But we weren't aware
of his hidden talents.

1550
01:06:15,566 --> 01:06:18,469
(insects chirring)

1551
01:06:18,502 --> 01:06:21,338
MAUD: Poor Carson. He must be
cooking in those heavy clothes.

1552
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:23,875
Isn't there a lighter version
he could wear?

1553
01:06:23,908 --> 01:06:26,310
- I believe so.
- Thank you, monsieur,

1554
01:06:26,343 --> 01:06:29,313
but we English are never too
hot to wear the correct attire.

1555
01:06:29,346 --> 01:06:31,683
(chuckles) I've invited
some friends tomorrow

1556
01:06:31,716 --> 01:06:33,886
to say goodbye
and introduce all of you.

1557
01:06:33,919 --> 01:06:35,687
But the presence
of your butler reminds me

1558
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,288
that we are now your guests

1559
01:06:37,322 --> 01:06:38,432
and I should have
asked your permission.

1560
01:06:38,456 --> 01:06:39,491
Oh, please.

1561
01:06:39,524 --> 01:06:40,860
Let us drink to

1562
01:06:40,893 --> 01:06:43,495
your fortunate granddaughter,
Sybil Branson.

1563
01:06:43,528 --> 01:06:45,630
- To Sybbie.
- ALL: Sybbie.

1564
01:06:45,663 --> 01:06:47,699
I wish she were here.
I should like to meet her.

1565
01:06:47,732 --> 01:06:48,810
LUCY:
I hope you will one day.

1566
01:06:48,834 --> 01:06:50,502
She's a lovely girl.

1567
01:06:50,535 --> 01:06:52,772
It's nice to hear
a stepmother talk like that.

1568
01:06:52,805 --> 01:06:54,783
You must be pleased
the way things have turned out.

1569
01:06:54,807 --> 01:06:56,541
When people you love
have a stroke of luck,

1570
01:06:56,574 --> 01:06:58,376
it's almost better than
being lucky yourself.

1571
01:06:58,409 --> 01:06:59,711
Almost but not quite.

1572
01:06:59,744 --> 01:07:00,846
- Yeah.
- (light laughter)

1573
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:07,552

in the library?

1574
01:07:08,486 --> 01:07:12,557

and it's engraved on the side.

01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,862

to see it there

1578

for more than half a century.

1579
01:07:22,968 --> 01:07:25,403
But he forbade me to move it.

1580
01:07:25,436 --> 01:07:26,872
He made me swear.

1581
01:07:31,643 --> 01:07:33,813
Any more news from Mr. Talbot?

1582
01:07:33,846 --> 01:07:36,115
Not since the cable
I showed you.

1583
01:07:36,148 --> 01:07:37,817
You must be missing him, milady.

1584
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:39,852
I just hope he misses me.

1585
01:07:43,488 --> 01:07:45,423
His Lordship will be home soon.

1586
01:07:45,456 --> 01:07:47,625
I'm afraid
he'll be in for a shock.

1587
01:07:47,659 --> 01:07:49,862
Have you enjoyed the filming?

1588
01:07:49,895 --> 01:07:50,896
In a way.

1589
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:53,531
I like Mr. Barber and Mr. Dexter

1590
01:07:53,565 --> 01:07:56,701
and watching how a film is made,
but... (sighs)

1591
01:07:56,734 --> 01:07:58,736
I feel a bit let down, too.

By Miss Dalgleish?

1593
01:08:00,538 --> 01:08:02,507
It sounds stupid, but...

1594
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,409
I thought
we might become friends.

1595
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:07,848
They say it can be a mistake
to meet your favorite stars.

1596

Do you have other children?

A daughter, Caroline,

1624
01:09:12,913 --> 01:09:15,916
George's father was killed in

on the day George was born.

1626

He held the baby in his arms
and died on the way home.

My God.

1628
01:09:24,991 --> 01:09:25,992
What was he like?

1629
01:09:26,026 --> 01:09:28,762
He was perfect, really.

1630
01:09:29,996 --> 01:09:32,799
As handsome as a prince
in a fairy tale.

1631
01:09:32,832 --> 01:09:37,636
Moral, strong, full of dreams,
determined to do his bit.

1632
01:09:38,704 --> 01:09:40,807
- Do you miss him?
- Of course.

1633
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,541
Although I sometimes wonder

1634
01:09:42,574 --> 01:09:44,946
what life would've made of him
if he'd lived.

1635
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:46,646
In a way...

1636
01:09:47,848 --> 01:09:49,683
In a way?

1637
01:09:49,716 --> 01:09:52,585
I was going to say, in a way,
you remind me of him.

1638
01:09:52,619 --> 01:09:53,897
Although I couldn't
tell you why.

1639
01:09:53,921 --> 01:09:54,989
I'm flattered.

1640
01:09:55,022 --> 01:09:57,825
What about your present husband?

1641
01:09:57,858 --> 01:09:59,626
Oh, Henry's much more pragmatic.

1642
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:02,562
There are no dreams about him.
He's a doer.

1643
01:10:02,595 --> 01:10:04,265
And he must test
his powers of endurance

1644
01:10:04,298 --> 01:10:05,699
from morning till night.

1645
01:10:05,732 --> 01:10:07,902
But he's a good workmate.

1646
01:10:07,935 --> 01:10:09,270
Is he handsome, too?

1647
01:10:09,303 --> 01:10:11,738
Oh, yes.

1648
01:10:11,772 --> 01:10:13,640
I like them handsome.

that marriage is a novel,
not a short story.

Full of plot twists
along the way.

1654
01:10:26,387 --> 01:10:29,290
Suppose it comes down to
whether or not you love him.

1655
01:10:29,323 --> 01:10:30,757
Really, Mr. Barber?

1656
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:31,725
Is this because
you work in the films?

1726
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,820
I was going to, and then
suddenly we were coming here.

1727
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:10,813
But you should never
have come here.

1728
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:12,090
We have to get you
to a proper doctor,

1729
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,325
and I don't mean
some quack in Marseilles.

1730
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:15,151
Dr. Clarks on
is more than capable

1731
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,828
- of coming up with a diagnosis.
- Then we'll go to London.

1732
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,263
We'll-we'll go to America
if we have to.

1733
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,989
We'll discuss it
when we know more.

1734
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:21,090
You should have told me!

1735
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,301
With the chance of a last treat

1736
01:14:22,325 --> 01:14:23,993
before illness
took over our lives?

1737
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:25,228
It may not be as bad as that.

1738
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:27,063
Robert, I've run
the hospital for years.

1739
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:28,307
Do you think I just sat there
with my ears blocked?

1740
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:30,833
- (sobbing)
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

1741
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:32,369
No. No.

1742
01:14:32,402 --> 01:14:34,838
This is not what I wanted
at all.

1743
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:36,940
- We're not sad people.
- (sniffles)

1744
01:14:36,974 --> 01:14:39,776
My being ill now
doesn't make us sad.

1745
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,144
(crying):
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

1746
01:14:41,178 --> 01:14:45,082
To lose my mother and my name.

1747
01:14:45,115 --> 01:14:47,384
Must I lose you, too?

1748
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:50,120
- I can't bear it.
- If I can bear it, you can.

1749
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:52,389
Remember, I loved you
from the start.

1750
01:14:52,422 --> 01:14:55,792
I loved you before you loved me.

1751
01:14:55,826 --> 01:14:57,261
I've always been ashamed
of that.

1752
01:14:57,294 --> 01:14:59,830
Don't be. I had money.
You needed it.

1753
01:15:01,832 --> 01:15:03,000
And then love came.

1754
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:06,303
And we have been happy,
haven't we?

1755
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:07,771
(whispers):
Oh, darling.

1756
01:15:13,977 --> 01:15:16,013
You have been everything to me.

1757
01:15:17,047 --> 01:15:18,348
Everything.

1758
01:15:18,382 --> 01:15:22,286
And I hope I can be everything
for a while yet.

1759
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:23,987
Now...

1760
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:27,400
- ...we must make an early start tomorrow,
- Oh.

1761
01:15:27,424 --> 01:15:29,159
And it's hours past my bedtime.

1762
01:15:29,192 --> 01:15:31,028
(chuckles)

1763
01:15:31,061 --> 01:15:32,996
(chuckles):
Oh, dear.

1764
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:35,365
Hope we can still get tickets
on the Blue Train.

1765
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:37,167
ROBERT:
Oh, yes.

1766
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,202
(jazz music continues)

1767
01:15:59,256 --> 01:16:01,291
- (music ends)
- (birds chirping)

1768
01:16:02,426 --> 01:16:04,428
(quiet chatter)

1769
01:16:04,461 --> 01:16:07,097
Why is the camera
in a padded cell?

1770
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:09,067
Anyone would think
it was a lunatic.

1771
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,377
Well, it's certainly
unpredictable.

1772
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:13,204
The microphone
must not pick up any noise

1773
01:16:13,237 --> 01:16:16,341
- unless I have approved it.
- Mm.

1774
01:16:16,374 --> 01:16:20,278
The padded box contains the
sound of the camera working.

1775
01:16:20,311 --> 01:16:22,947
So we're really in
your hands now, Mr. Stubbins.

1776
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,949
Your words, not mine.

1777
01:16:24,982 --> 01:16:26,050
Everyone ready?

1778
01:16:26,084 --> 01:16:27,952
Let's go for a take. And...

1779
01:16:27,985 --> 01:16:31,155
STUBBINS: Uh, please be aware
of where the microphones are

1780
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:34,092
and speak clearly.

1781
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:36,461
And, uh, this time, Myrna,
mime but don't talk.

1782
01:16:36,494 --> 01:16:38,463
- Not a word. Do you understand?
- I'm not stupid.

1783
01:16:38,496 --> 01:16:40,164
We only want to hear Lady Mary.

1784
01:16:40,198 --> 01:16:41,366
Mary, please.

1785
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:43,301
Very good.

1786
01:16:43,334 --> 01:16:44,478
Uh, Albert,
you ready with the clap stick?

1787
01:16:44,502 --> 01:16:46,003
(clears throat)

1788
01:16:47,071 --> 01:16:48,215
- Ring the bell.
- (bell jingles)

1789
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,341
Roll the camera.

1790
01:16:52,143 --> 01:16:53,344
Albert.

1791
01:16:55,046 --> 01:16:56,114
And...

1792
01:16:58,082 --> 01:16:59,384
...action.

1793
01:16:59,417 --> 01:17:02,086
<i>Madame, Messieurs,
placez vos Paris.</i>

1794
01:17:04,555 --> 01:17:06,524
MARY:
Bill.

1795
01:17:06,557 --> 01:17:08,226
You came back.

1796
01:17:08,259 --> 01:17:09,470
MARY and MYRNA:
I always come back.

1797
01:17:09,494 --> 01:17:11,262
- Sorry. Sorry.
- BARBER: Cut!

1798
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,398
Uh, everyone,
back to ones, please.

1799
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:16,000
(bell jingles)

1800
01:17:16,033 --> 01:17:17,201
Roll the camera.

1801
01:17:20,004 --> 01:17:22,306
And... action.

1802
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,942
<i>Madame, Messieurs,
placez vos Paris.</i>

1803
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:28,279
MARY:
Bill.

1804
01:17:28,312 --> 01:17:29,547
You came back.

1805
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,182
MARY and MYRNA:
I always come back.

1806
01:17:31,215 --> 01:17:32,517
- Sorry!
- BARBER: Cut!

1807
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:33,994
MYRNA: But it's just
very difficult for me

1808
01:17:34,018 --> 01:17:35,162
because she's right in me ear!

1809
01:17:35,186 --> 01:17:36,430
And you've got me
coming out a bush!

1810
01:17:36,454 --> 01:17:38,089
BARBER:
I understand. Reset please.

1811
01:17:40,491 --> 01:17:41,526
MARY:
Bill.

1812
01:17:41,559 --> 01:17:43,127
You came back.

1813
01:17:43,161 --> 01:17:44,562
MARY and MYRNA:
I always come back.

1814
01:17:44,595 --> 01:17:46,341
- Bloody hell!
- There's no need to swear, is there?

1815
01:17:46,365 --> 01:17:47,409
- Myrna, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Right, that's it.

1816
01:17:47,433 --> 01:17:48,443
- I've had enough.
- Myrna.

1817
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:49,968
You take your hands off me.

1818
01:17:50,002 --> 01:17:51,312
- Get out of my way!
- Myrna, darling!

1819
01:17:51,336 --> 01:17:53,205
No!

1820
01:17:55,307 --> 01:17:57,009
Now what?

1821
01:17:57,042 --> 01:17:59,044
I knew she'd be trouble
right from the start.

1822
01:17:59,077 --> 01:18:00,446
She's rude. She's surly.

1823
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:03,182
ANNA: True, but now
she also feels humiliated.

1824
01:18:03,215 --> 01:18:06,051
Moving her mouth while Lady
Mary's voice comes out of it.

1825
01:18:06,084 --> 01:18:08,053
MRS. PATMORE: And this is
her first sound film.

1826
01:18:08,086 --> 01:18:09,455
What happens to her next?

1827
01:18:09,488 --> 01:18:11,166
MRS. HUGHES:
I suppose her career's finished.

1828
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:12,500
I suppose a lot of them
are finished.

1829
01:18:12,524 --> 01:18:15,327
The point is they've got
to get her back to work.

1830
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,030
But what if she won't come?
They can't force her.

1831
01:18:18,063 --> 01:18:20,065
Why don't you two have a go?

1832
01:18:20,098 --> 01:18:21,500
You know how to reason with her.

1833
01:18:21,533 --> 01:18:23,035
They don't.

1834
01:18:23,068 --> 01:18:24,436
(Anna sighs)

1835
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:29,341
Myrna, darling,
please come down.

1836
01:18:29,374 --> 01:18:31,410
We can't do anything
without you.

1837
01:18:31,443 --> 01:18:32,544
You can talk without me!

1838
01:18:32,578 --> 01:18:34,513
Just go away!

1839
01:18:37,115 --> 01:18:38,250
Milady.

1840
01:18:40,252 --> 01:18:42,387
I think it would be
a good idea to let the maids

1841
01:18:42,421 --> 01:18:44,523
see if they can make her
comfortable, Mr. Barber.

1842
01:18:44,556 --> 01:18:46,358
All right.
If you think so, yeah.

1843
01:18:46,391 --> 01:18:48,427
Stand back, everybody.

1844
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,995
(knocking)

1845
01:18:50,529 --> 01:18:52,164
Please let us in,
Miss Dalgleish.

1846
01:18:52,197 --> 01:18:53,641
We understand
what you're going through.

1847
01:18:53,665 --> 01:18:57,269
That's true, and you know it.

1848
01:18:57,302 --> 01:18:59,171
(lock clicks)

1849
01:19:02,074 --> 01:19:03,551
I'm not going down
just so they can humiliate me

1850
01:19:03,575 --> 01:19:05,611
- and laugh at me.
- They won't do that.

1851
01:19:05,644 --> 01:19:08,080
Oh? You should've heard them
at every premiere.

1852
01:19:08,113 --> 01:19:09,491
"Don't speak.
Don't open your mouth."

1853
01:19:09,515 --> 01:19:11,183
They despise me.

1854
01:19:11,216 --> 01:19:12,393
Why didn't you take
elocution lessons?

1855
01:19:12,417 --> 01:19:13,485
Lots of people do.

1856
01:19:13,519 --> 01:19:15,387
I tried. I couldn't get it.

1857
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,155
Couldn't get the knack.

1858
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:19,391
Something's upset you
since the day you got here.

1859
01:19:19,424 --> 01:19:21,393
- What is it?
- It's this.

1860
01:19:21,427 --> 01:19:24,097
I knew I was finished the moment
I saw <i>The Jazz Singer.</i>

1861
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:26,132
It's been like a sword
hanging over me.

1862
01:19:26,165 --> 01:19:27,576
I thought maybe I had
a few more films ahead of me,

1863
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,168
but this one will be me last.

1864
01:19:29,202 --> 01:19:30,403
You don't know that.

1865
01:19:30,436 --> 01:19:31,614
You look good
in the bits I've seen.

1866
01:19:31,638 --> 01:19:33,306
And how do I sound, eh?

1867
01:19:33,339 --> 01:19:35,375
But the fact is I'm washed up,
as the Yanks say.

1868
01:19:35,408 --> 01:19:37,143
I'm yesterday's news.

1869
01:19:37,176 --> 01:19:38,311
(Myrna sighs)

1870
01:19:39,646 --> 01:19:41,314
Come on, lady.

1871
01:19:41,347 --> 01:19:43,383
You're not talking
to your fan club now.

1872
01:19:43,416 --> 01:19:44,584
What?

1873
01:19:44,617 --> 01:19:47,153
You're famous,
beautiful and rich.

1874
01:19:47,186 --> 01:19:50,156
So what if
your film career is over?

1875
01:19:50,189 --> 01:19:52,358
There's any number of things
you can do.

1876
01:19:52,392 --> 01:19:53,660
Now, dust yourself off.

1877
01:19:53,693 --> 01:19:55,428
And while you're at it,
try being polite

1878
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:58,331
- to the people who serve you.
- Come on, Daisy.

1879
01:19:58,364 --> 01:20:01,200
You're one of us,
not one of them.

1880
01:20:01,234 --> 01:20:03,336
Just remember it.

1881
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:04,671
Now, chop-chop.

1882
01:20:04,704 --> 01:20:06,406
Straighten your hair,
and let's get going.

1883
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:08,508
(knocking)

1884
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:10,143
How you doing in there?

1885
01:20:10,176 --> 01:20:11,656
DAISY:
She's almost ready, Mr. Barber.

1886
01:20:12,745 --> 01:20:15,281
You are, aren't you,
Miss Dalgleish?

1887
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,689
I had a sister
just like you once.

1888
01:20:22,722 --> 01:20:24,257
I miss her.

1889
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:25,391
Every day.

1890
01:20:25,425 --> 01:20:27,327
You remind me of her.

1891
01:20:29,429 --> 01:20:32,398
She died of the Spanish flu
in 1919.

1892
01:20:32,432 --> 01:20:33,910
Didn't think
it would touch our family,

1893
01:20:33,934 --> 01:20:36,235
but you never know, do you?

1894
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:40,273
(inhales deeply)

CARSON (chuckles):
I think I can say so

without fear of contradiction.

1911
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:30,324

Uh, you made
your feelings clear.

what it is to deal with

Oh, she's absolutely superb.

Papa's telegram, Tom,

1924
01:21:56,383 --> 01:21:57,651
but you ought to look in.

1925
01:21:57,685 --> 01:21:59,286
Perhaps we should go up now.

1926
01:21:59,319 --> 01:22:00,554
Maybe you're right.

What miniature is this?

Lady Grantham knows too much
to pull the wool over her eyes.

2070
01:28:37,688 --> 01:28:40,691
But even if everything is
as bad as it could be,

2071
01:28:40,724 --> 01:28:42,027
there's still a surgery.

2072
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,862
Let's take it
one step at a time.

2073
01:28:43,895 --> 01:28:45,629
Oh, God.

2074
01:28:46,697 --> 01:28:50,402
Robert doesn't see it, but
things could be a lot worse.

2075
01:28:50,435 --> 01:28:52,070
How many have to face
this kind of thing

2076
01:28:52,104 --> 01:28:53,872
feeling they've wasted
their lives?

2077
01:28:53,905 --> 01:28:56,041
I don't.

2078
01:28:56,074 --> 01:28:57,741
Not at all.

2079
01:29:01,147 --> 01:29:02,949
How are things at the farm?

2080
01:29:02,982 --> 01:29:04,117
Cramped.

2081
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:05,750
Poor Mr. Mason.

2082
01:29:05,785 --> 01:29:08,020
He'd be so unhappy
to hear you say it.

2083
01:29:08,788 --> 01:29:11,057
He's been talking
about you lately.

2084
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:12,691
Oh, yes?

2085
01:29:12,724 --> 01:29:14,193
Saying what a fine woman you are

2086
01:29:14,227 --> 01:29:16,229
and how much he admires you.

2087
01:29:16,262 --> 01:29:18,431
Does he? Really?

2088
01:29:18,464 --> 01:29:20,665
But he won't take it
any further.

2089
01:29:20,699 --> 01:29:21,968
Why not?

2090
01:29:22,001 --> 01:29:24,736
Because he can't ask you
to live at the farm

2091
01:29:24,769 --> 01:29:26,806
and he couldn't be dependent
on a woman.

2092
01:29:26,839 --> 01:29:28,673
Oh, couldn't he?

2093
01:29:28,707 --> 01:29:30,176
We'll see about that.

2094
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,715
Look what we've found.

2095
01:29:36,748 --> 01:29:38,918
When I was going through
Violet's things.

2096
01:29:39,886 --> 01:29:42,021
"The letters of
the Marquis de Montmirail."

2097
01:29:42,054 --> 01:29:43,122
EDITH:
Oh, dear.

2098
01:29:43,156 --> 01:29:44,756
It doesn't look good for Papa

2099
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:46,792
if she felt the need
to keep it a secret.

2100
01:29:46,826 --> 01:29:48,227
Well, let's not jump the gun.

2101
01:29:48,261 --> 01:29:49,872
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you
in the middle of something?

2102
01:29:49,896 --> 01:29:51,264
No, no.

2103
01:29:51,297 --> 01:29:52,198
Could I speak to you alone
for a moment, please?

2104
01:29:52,231 --> 01:29:53,765
Yes.

2105
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,135
So what happens now?

2106
01:29:56,169 --> 01:29:58,070
Well, I thought
we could read them together.

2107
01:29:58,104 --> 01:30:00,840
Bertie, you and I can do it and
report back what they contain.

2108
01:30:00,873 --> 01:30:04,676
And we'll break the news
to Papa.

2109
01:30:09,081 --> 01:30:10,316
(Barber clears throat)

2110
01:30:10,349 --> 01:30:12,852
What is it?

2111
01:30:12,885 --> 01:30:14,153
You have to help me.

2112
01:30:14,187 --> 01:30:16,789
We're just about to film
our last set piece,

2113
01:30:16,822 --> 01:30:19,125
the-the dinner when Benson
realizes he must give her up

2114
01:30:19,158 --> 01:30:20,725
and rushes off to London.

2115
01:30:20,759 --> 01:30:22,004
I know.
I've just been learning it.

2116
01:30:22,028 --> 01:30:24,729
Molesley's done a wonderful job.

2117
01:30:24,763 --> 01:30:27,133
I told you the extras were
fed up with not being paid,

2118
01:30:27,166 --> 01:30:28,801
and I don't blame them,

2119
01:30:28,834 --> 01:30:30,803
but I'm still waiting
for the money.

2120
01:30:30,836 --> 01:30:32,147
Well, they won't do
anything too drastic.

2121
01:30:32,171 --> 01:30:33,506
Won't they?

2122
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:35,775
They say they're not
coming into work.

2123
01:30:35,808 --> 01:30:37,244
But how can I help?

2124
01:30:38,245 --> 01:30:42,983
Could your servants stand in?

2125
01:30:43,984 --> 01:30:45,185
You're welcome to ask them.

2126
01:30:50,324 --> 01:30:51,858
(chuckles)

2127
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,162
Is there something else,
Mr. Barber?

2128
01:30:56,163 --> 01:30:59,032
I could never have got through
any of this without you.

2129
01:31:00,033 --> 01:31:02,970
If that's true, then I'm glad.

2130
01:31:03,003 --> 01:31:04,338
(sighs)

2131
01:31:05,572 --> 01:31:07,174
May I kiss you?

2132
01:31:10,978 --> 01:31:12,079
No.

2133
01:31:12,112 --> 01:31:14,348
Don't you want to?

2134
01:31:16,049 --> 01:31:18,852
I'm afraid I'm too
old-fashioned to believe

2135
01:31:18,885 --> 01:31:22,155
that what I want is
the only thing that matters.

2136
01:31:23,857 --> 01:31:26,994
- Have I offended you?
- Not at all.

2137
01:31:27,027 --> 01:31:29,263
Nothing is nicer
for an old married woman

2138
01:31:29,296 --> 01:31:31,932
than to find she's still
an object of desire.

2139
01:31:31,965 --> 01:31:33,567
(chuckles)

2140
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,111
Well, you better not tell
your husband when he gets back.

2141
01:31:35,135 --> 01:31:37,104
He might, uh,
hit me on the nose.

2142
01:31:37,137 --> 01:31:38,572
Mm, wouldn't that be thrilling?

2143
01:31:38,605 --> 01:31:41,141
Two gorgeous men
fighting for my favors.

2144
01:31:41,174 --> 01:31:43,243
(knocking, door opens)

2145
01:31:44,444 --> 01:31:46,179
You rang, milady?

2146
01:31:46,213 --> 01:31:49,349
- So she'd kept his letters?
- Seemingly. Every one.

2147
01:31:49,383 --> 01:31:51,018
I won't ask
what she had to hide,

2148
01:31:51,051 --> 01:31:52,586
in case you tell me the answer.

2149
01:31:52,619 --> 01:31:54,955
Well, most of them
are rather sad.

2150
01:31:54,988 --> 01:31:58,292
There was clearly no love lost
between him and his wife.

2151
01:31:58,325 --> 01:31:59,960
But what do they tell us about

2152
01:31:59,993 --> 01:32:01,895
the days they spent together
in France?

2153
01:32:01,928 --> 01:32:03,239
I'm afraid that they didn't
write to each other then.

2154
01:32:03,263 --> 01:32:07,000
So we still have no proof
of what really happened.

2155
01:32:07,034 --> 01:32:08,268
BERTIE:
I suppose that is

2156
01:32:08,302 --> 01:32:09,936
where the mystery resides.

2157
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:12,005
I'll come and see
Violet tomorrow.

2158
01:32:12,039 --> 01:32:14,175
(sighs) Should I do it?

2159
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,943
No.

2160
01:32:15,977 --> 01:32:18,913
You're what the lawyers call
"an interested party."

2161
01:32:18,946 --> 01:32:20,915
I'm not.

2162
01:32:23,084 --> 01:32:25,053
You mean we'd be up there
on the screen

2163
01:32:25,086 --> 01:32:26,397
with Miss Dalgleish
and Mr. Dexter?

2164
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:28,132
- (chuckles) Are you sure?
- (excited murmuring)

2165
01:32:28,156 --> 01:32:29,867
- That's exactly what I mean.
- Well, I'll do it.

2166
01:32:29,891 --> 01:32:31,225
Mm, so will Mr. Carson.

2167
01:32:31,259 --> 01:32:32,460
(excited chatter)

2168
01:32:32,493 --> 01:32:34,162
Mr. Molesley
will want to join in.

2169
01:32:34,195 --> 01:32:35,239
- How many do you need?
- BARBER: Uh, we need ten.

2170
01:32:35,263 --> 01:32:36,407
Miss Denker, are you up for it?

2171
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:37,965
Certainly not.

2172
01:32:37,999 --> 01:32:39,476
I want to keep an eye
on Her Ladyship.

2173
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,336
- What about Mr. Mason?
- I could always ask.

2174
01:32:41,369 --> 01:32:43,237
No, hurry to the farm
and ask him now.

2175
01:32:43,271 --> 01:32:44,939
And they've got costumes for us?

2176
01:32:44,972 --> 01:32:46,216
BARBER: Oh, well,
they'll need time to fit them,

2177
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,975
so you should
go upstairs to wardrobe

2178
01:32:48,009 --> 01:32:49,086
- before the end of the day.
- (chatter, laughter)

2179
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:50,378
What about servants?

2180
01:32:50,411 --> 01:32:52,447
- Who's going to wait on us?
- (laughter)

2181
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,282
Well, I was thinking
we could use Albert.

2182
01:32:54,315 --> 01:32:56,160
- (gasping)
- Would I be serving Miss Dalgleish?

2183
01:32:56,184 --> 01:32:58,252
- I suppose so.
- Oh, well...

2184
01:32:58,286 --> 01:33:00,988
- (excited chatter)
- Right, let's get back to work, please!

2185
01:33:01,022 --> 01:33:03,024
- All right, come on now.
- Come along.

2186
01:33:05,026 --> 01:33:08,196
ISOBEL: <i>Filming must be the
slowest occupation known to man.</i>

2187
01:33:08,229 --> 01:33:10,098
It makes a glacier
look impatient.

2188
01:33:10,131 --> 01:33:12,367
I suppose Robert's in hell.

2189
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:16,104
He was longing for it all to be
over by the time they got back.

2190
01:33:16,137 --> 01:33:19,006
You could ease his pain
if you wish.

2191
01:33:20,341 --> 01:33:23,244
We found the letters
of Monsieur de Montmirail.

2192
01:33:23,277 --> 01:33:26,280
But Robert still doesn't have
the answer he needs.

2193
01:33:27,448 --> 01:33:30,118
I won't pretend
not to understand you.

2194
01:33:30,151 --> 01:33:31,986
Did they tell you
about the miniature?

2195
01:33:32,019 --> 01:33:33,488
What's its significance?

2196
01:33:33,521 --> 01:33:35,189
Well, could you fetch it?

2197
01:33:35,223 --> 01:33:37,959
It's in the bottom
right-hand drawer.

2198
01:33:37,992 --> 01:33:39,327
If you open it at the back,

2199
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,330
you'll find the letter
he sent with it.

2200
01:33:42,363 --> 01:33:46,434
It's still there
after all this time.

2201
01:33:47,435 --> 01:33:49,036
Could you read it?

2202
01:33:54,576 --> 01:33:57,413
<i>"Chère Violette,</i>
we have missed the chance

2203
01:33:57,446 --> 01:33:59,381
"to know perfect love.

2204
01:34:01,116 --> 01:34:06,188
But we still can if you would
only change your mind."

2205
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:09,191
Why didn't you just tell us?

2206
01:34:10,759 --> 01:34:13,562
There was nothing to tell.

2207
01:34:13,595 --> 01:34:15,130
Nothing happened.

2208
01:34:15,164 --> 01:34:17,332
Apart from years
of being pestered.

2209
01:34:17,366 --> 01:34:19,034
Well, no.

2210
01:34:19,067 --> 01:34:21,003
That's not quite right.

2211
01:34:21,036 --> 01:34:22,471
Then what is?

2212
01:34:22,504 --> 01:34:25,174
I never saw him after that.

2213
01:34:25,207 --> 01:34:27,042
I knew I'd have given in.

2214
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:31,480
If I'd been tested again,
I would have failed.

2215
01:34:32,581 --> 01:34:34,283
Oh.

2216
01:34:34,316 --> 01:34:37,352
I was a fool for love
in those days.

2217
01:34:37,386 --> 01:34:40,155
A few years later,
we went to Russia,

2218
01:34:40,189 --> 01:34:42,991
and I got into terrible trouble.

2219
01:34:43,025 --> 01:34:44,560
Well, I nearly did.

2220
01:34:44,593 --> 01:34:47,329
With Prince Kuragin.
Yes, I know.

2221
01:34:47,362 --> 01:34:49,465
How did you avoid it
with the marquis?

2222
01:34:49,498 --> 01:34:51,133
I can't think.

2223
01:34:51,166 --> 01:34:54,203
He was the most attractive man
I'd ever met

2224
01:34:54,236 --> 01:34:57,139
in my life. (chuckles)

2225
01:34:57,172 --> 01:34:58,775
But I hadn't long been married,

2226
01:34:58,808 --> 01:35:02,377
and it must have seemed a
shame, you know, to spoil that.

2227
01:35:03,479 --> 01:35:05,447
I wish you'd said all this.

2228
01:35:05,481 --> 01:35:07,425
I didn't want you to think
my life had been a fraud,

2229
01:35:07,449 --> 01:35:09,051
when it hasn't.

2230
01:35:09,084 --> 01:35:11,587
I was happy
with Robert's father.

2231
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:15,190
Well, (chuckles) happy enough
in that English way,

2232
01:35:15,224 --> 01:35:19,561
when you never talk
about anything

2233
01:35:19,595 --> 01:35:21,630
but you trust each other.

2234
01:35:21,663 --> 01:35:26,102
If they'd put Kuragin
and Montmirail together,

2235
01:35:26,135 --> 01:35:29,606
I would have come out
as some sort of scarlet woman.

2236
01:35:29,639 --> 01:35:31,241
(chuckles)

2237
01:35:31,274 --> 01:35:33,276
You don't seem
very scarlet to me.

2238
01:35:33,309 --> 01:35:35,445

I'd just been promoted
from hall boy,

2615
01:55:04,026 --> 01:55:06,695
and I was in the dining room
with the old butler then,

2616
01:55:06,728 --> 01:55:08,463
Mr. Mount joy.

2617
01:55:08,496 --> 01:55:10,565
I'd been terrified of him.

2618
01:55:10,598 --> 01:55:13,301
But then she walked towards us.

2619

She was angry
about something, and...

2620
01:55:16,337 --> 01:55:18,808
and I could see him tremble.

2621
01:55:18,841 --> 01:55:21,309
I never forgot that.

2622
01:55:21,342 --> 01:55:23,778

of him again.

For a bit longer anyway.

Barrow is leaving, and I can't
break in a new butler alone.

2629

Could Andrew be your steady hand

2630

to succeed you?

2631
01:55:44,566 --> 01:55:46,267
