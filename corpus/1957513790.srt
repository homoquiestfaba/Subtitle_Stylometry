Gentrification is a hole...

136
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:19,633
I wouldn't say that if
I were you. I think there's...

137

...many things
to gentrification.

138
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,104
Can you boil that down for me?

139
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:25,539
Meaning, like,
gentrification is like...

140
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,141
...people have been living
there for years and years,

141
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,543
and then they get kicked out,
and then new people move in

142
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:31,846

143

about it in terms of the people,

144
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,083

- No... I'm not... Yeah... I'm not...

145
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:37,985
- ...in terms of the way that it looks.
- Got it.

146
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:40,287
Yeah. I'm not trying to make
you feel better about that.

147
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:43,891
That's a very... That's a conversation
we probably shouldn't touch.

148
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,826
- Who?
- No. I'm just saying that... that

149
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,896
gentrification is a conversation
that you... you said it's cute

150
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,767
and I don't... I think that it's just...
That... You can't really say that.

151
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,636
Like, you don't... You know, people lose
their homes. Anyway. Whatever. Uh...

152
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,104
I think you're missing
the point here. [chuckles]

153
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:58,873
You're making me feel like
an awful person.

154
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,644

00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,490
He loves your painting.

340
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,259
That's cool.

341
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:51,866
Listen to me.
It's what you always wanted.

342
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,901
You get paid for.

343
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:56,303
You get paid.

344
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,905
Precisely. We both will.

345
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,379
It's delicious. It's happy time.

346
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,615
Come on. Give me a kiss.

347
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:08,850
I love those lips.

[mellow hip hop music]

349
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,624
[Pierre]
It's very special.

350
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:22,396
Hey, Pierre, meet Hunter.

351
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:23,798
Hunter, meet Pierre.

352
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,800
- <i>Enchantée.</i>
- Nice to meet you.

353
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,201
This is the artist.

354
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,370
I love your painting.
It's perfect.

355
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:34,609
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

356
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:36,811
You know, I've been
telling Hunter that those

357
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:40,280
explorations of Black effect

358
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:43,918
are exactly the social political
aesthetic interventions

359
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:46,319
- we need in this moment.
- I agree.

360
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,457
I love it.

361
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,391
I want to buy it.

362
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,532
[clicks tongue and sighs]
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:57,565 --> 00:19:59,701
It's actually already sold, sir.

364
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:01,969
But thank you.
I'm glad you liked it.

Where's my fucking lighter?

368
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,420
Oh, fuck.

369
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,695
Yo, uh, can I borrow your light?

370
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:28,696
Thank you.

[siren blaring in distance]

372
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:38,405
- Thank you...
- You're welcome.

373
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:40,775
...for sure.

374
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:41,709
Did you paint that?

375
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:46,781
- Yeah.
- I like it.

376
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:51,351
It's cool.

377
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,321
You can have it.

378
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:54,989
Really?

379
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:01,529
Thanks.

380
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:10,004
Wow. So Basquiat of you.

381
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:12,740
You know, Henny, you know
what it is that, "Oh, I need...

382
00:21:12,774 --> 00:21:14,942
the Black struggle, and I need
to stay in the Black box,

383
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:17,578
and I'm like, "What the fuck
you know about being Black?"

384
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:19,412
Fuck putting my art in a box.

385
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,849
True.

386
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:23,785
I don't like being
put in a box either.

387
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:29,757
At least you know your art
is worth something now, right?

388
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:34,327
I mean as cliché as it sounds,
when one door closes, another one opens.

389
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,696
All right?
Look at me and my music.

390
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:39,366
I don't know what the hell I'm
out here doing. But I'm doing it.

391
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:40,400
Right?

392
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:43,070
Henny, real talk,
those doors are an illusion.

393
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:45,106
Do you understand that?
They're not real.

394
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:46,841
But you only need one...

395
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:48,810
...or you can manifest your own.

396
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:51,478
Well, you weren't in love
with Cleo. No shade, like,

397
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:53,346
I think you were
just using each other.

398
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,782
Like she was using you...

399
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,650
...as a boy toy.

400
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,487
Like, look at your patterns.

401
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:01,923
Every time
you meet a pretty girl,

402
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:03,691
and you put her
on a pedestal, and then

403
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:05,026
- she emasculates you, I mean...
- Fuck.

404
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:06,961
- ...that's your pattern, like...
- I do that.

405
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,830
Everybody has a pattern
and shit. I'm not saying

406
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:11,566
- mine is any better.
- I gotta stop, I gotta stop.

407
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,034
I gotta stop, yo.

408
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:16,003
- You do.
- I'm done with this. This is my life.

409
00:22:16,037 --> 00:22:18,405
You feel me?
This is my fucking life.

410
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,841
- True.
- I'm gonna focus on me.

411
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:21,474
I'm gonna get my shit together.

412
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:22,710
I don't want to talk to no one.

I'm not falling
in love ever again.

414
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,113
I'll be fucking celibate.

415
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:28,049
Maybe you should be celibate
with that bottle first.

416
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,086
Why the fuck, you act like
I have a fucking problem

417
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,688
or something?
Don't come at me like that.

418
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:35,590
- Why would you say that?
- I'm just saying.

419
00:22:35,623 --> 00:22:36,691
Maybe give up sex.

420
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,493
Maybe give up drinking and drugs
for a month, and see how you feel.

421
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:43,130
Just like a cleanse.
You know, just a reset.

422
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:44,999
That's all.

423
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:47,068
- It's time to focus on your art.
- That's right.

424
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:49,402
- I'm... Hmm, I'm so fucking ready.
- Time to be happy.

425
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:51,038
- Do your fucking art. The only relationship...
- I'm so...

426
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:52,773
...you need to be focused on

427
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:55,442
is you, God...

428
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:58,880
...the universe,
and your art. 'Cause...

00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:01,549
...we're some fucking
self-made bitches out here.

You know, this is really random.

00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,887
- [Hunter] What're you doing? You're taking a selfie?
- [Ruby] Yeah.

434
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:41,956
I thought you
don't take selfies.

435
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:44,457
No, I'm not really
into social media.

436
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:48,062
You know, I just don't see the
point, and because... I don't know.

437
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,965
- Not my thing.
- What does that mean?

438
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:54,635
You're an artist?
You curate content for a living,

439
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:56,637
similar to the way
that I do.

440
00:23:56,671 --> 00:24:00,841
How do you make money if you don't
curate content that people like?

441
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,778
Um, I don't know.
I don't know. I paint and then

442
00:24:03,811 --> 00:24:08,182
sell paintings, trying to get
my shit out there. Do odd jobs.

443
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:10,918
How do people see
your art then? That's just...

444
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:13,654
That's really no way
to market yourself.

445
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:15,823
So, you're not making any money.

446
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:17,558
And do you live in your car?

447
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:19,660
- [both chuckles]
- [Ruby] It all makes sense now.

448
00:24:19,694 --> 00:24:21,796
No, I just don't believe in
blasting every detail

449
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:24,165
of my personal life
in social media.

- [Hunter] I know.

see the Hollywood sign right there.

Ok. I know what we should do.

What?

00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,643
- We're going to the beach.
- The beach?

- No, wait, I got it. I got it.

- [Ruby] They're in.

462

- [Hunter] Now, close. All right?
- [Ruby] Yep.

463

- [Hunter] Safe? Put on your seat belt.
- [Ruby] You almost...

- ...you almost hit your Tiki man.
- Put on your seat belt.

- Put on... Listen, don't touch anything.

- [Hunter] You can't... Listen.

but you can't get

into that man's place, and start
moving things around, all right?

Listen, I'm just letting you
know that you need to get there.

00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,188

00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,040
What are you doing, yo?

00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:44,045
- Oh, you're taking a selfie?
- Yeah.

476
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:45,980
- [Hunter] Shit.
- So, what? It's good for your brand.

477
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:47,615
- Your brand?
- What?

478
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:50,151
Nothing. I'm just
saying that I...

479
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:52,920
next time just ask before you...
What are you doing?

- Smile!
- Put it down!

see what I'm doing anyway.

All right. Let's go.

- Yo, we're like kind of...

Ooh!

00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:27,054
- where did this come from?
- What are you doing?

489
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:29,790
- I love bikes, especially pink bikes.
- You don't...

00:26:29,824 --> 00:26:31,992
- That's not your bike.
- Yeah, but it's Ok. Get on.

- No, I'm not getting on that...
- Come on, get on the bike, get on the bike.

Get on the bike, you don't
trust my driving sense?

00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:39,900
No, I'm just saying
this bike is really small.

494

- I just want to see if we can do it.
- Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

- Lady, get your own bike.
- Ok.

Take your bike back, be careful.
Don't talk to strangers.

- Yeah, we're sorry. Don't tell anybody.
- Stay away from...

ashamed of yourselves.

- Just go. What are you doing?
- [Ruby chuckles]

502
00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:01,822
- What? I was...
- How are you gonna take a little girl's bike?

503
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:03,691
No, I was taking it
for like a loop.
