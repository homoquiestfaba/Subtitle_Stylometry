00:00:27,877 --> 00:00:30,277
DARLENE:
You know, relationships can be

2
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,109
a lot like a loaf of bread.

3
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:34,615
At the beginning,
they're hot and fresh,

4
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:36,686
and you can always get a rise.

5
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,277
But with time, if you don't
knead 'em carefully,

6
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:40,947
they grow old and stale.

7
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:43,958
Now, I know that life
ain't no Easy-Bake oven.

8
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,255
But with the kids
and my husband's job,

9
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:49,160
it's almost as if we've
forgotten to add the yeast.

10
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:51,165
So I'm hoping this trip to Reno

11
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,360
with our best friends,
Candy and Roy,

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,597
will be just what
the doctor ordered.

13
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:57,434
"F"...

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,508
"L"...

15
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,076
"O"...

16
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,708
Can't you see it, Darlene?

17
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,840
No. It's kinda hard
to make out.

18
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:11,018
[Sighs]

19
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:13,021
I think I'm just nervous, doc,

20
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:16,251
'cause Lonnie Earl and I have
got to go on vacation tomorrow,

21
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,623
and I'm just not real good
about leavin' home.

22
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:23,030
[Beep]

23
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,431
WOMAN: Stacey Regal,
call the operator.

24
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:29,965
Okay.

25
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:32,970
All right, baby.
Move that sign.

26
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:34,634
I'm tryin' to sell
some cars here.

27
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:36,803
Hey, Lonnie Earl Dodd here.
Guess what, folks.

28
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:39,211
It's time for our annual
Presidents' Day Blowout sale,

29
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:41,715
and I gotta tell you,
I'm feelin' rather patriotic.

30
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:44,048
And I guarantee we won't be
undersold by anybody,

31
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:46,645
and if you can't trust
ol' Lonnie Earl Dodd,

32
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:48,383
then you can't trust anybody.

33
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,853
All right now, Darlene.
Just go ahead

34
00:01:54,964 --> 00:01:57,432
and use one or two of those
drops if you feel the need,

35
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,594
especially out there on that old
I-40 around the Mojave Desert.

[Chuckles]

37
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,934
You just go on and have yourself
a vacation.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,098
Thanks, doc.

39
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,300
Roy?

40
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:08,036
DARLENE: Hey, Roy!

41
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:12,313
Oh, I got to call Candy

42
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:14,679
and see if she's bringing
any nice clothes.

43
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:15,842
- She home?
- Yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:18,079
But I can't find that husband
of yours nowhere.

45
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:21,021
I've called all over the place,
and I can't rouse him.

46
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:24,150
Well, you know Lonnie Earl.
He's probably up to no good.

47
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,559
And if you can't trust me,
who can you trust?

48
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:32,666
And remember... if you can't
trust me, Lonnie Earl...

[Grunts, glass breaks]

50
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:42,439
Is there a problem?

51
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:43,944
You're damn right there is!

52
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,447
How come you got to take
a shower after?

53
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:47,516
Huh?

54
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:49,642
You feel dirty?

55
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,447
'Cause I sure as hell
feel dirty.

56
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:54,318
Oh, my God, Lonnie Earl.
We're filthy.

57
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,188
I'm not.
I'm Zestfully clean.

59
00:02:58,628 --> 00:02:59,686
Oh, shit!

60
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:01,320
How could you do that to me?!

61
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,661
One minute you're cryin'
on my shoulder about Darlene,

62
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,961
the next minute
you're bangin' me from behind!

63
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,037
Well, you told me
not to look at you.

DR. TULE Y: I got to send
the sample over to the lab.

66
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:13,040

68
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:17,044
Don't waste your time
worryin' about it, though.

69
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:19,740
Y'all just go on
and enjoy your vacation.

70
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,079
Well, you know,
I guess you're right,

71
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:25,018
'cause I know worryin' about it
ain't gonna change nothin',

72
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,418
- is it?
- That's right.

73
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:30,219
So, uh... what y'all got
lined up?

74
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:32,419
Lonnie Earl's got a bet
with ol' Bill Moore

75
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:35,622
that he can eat this giant
ol' 72-ounce steak in Amarillo.

76

Horseshit.

77
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,291
Then we're gonna pop up
to the Grand Canyon,

78
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:40,266
'cause Darlene's always
wanted to see that.

79

Candy is.

and the gamblin' and all that.

82
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:47,408
But the big thing is,

83
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,240
we got tickets
to the Monster Truck Jam.

84
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:52,906
Yeah, yeah.
That sounds like a big time.

85
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:56,474
You know, Roy,
I could send the test results

86
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:59,885
over to Candy's folks,
let them know when they come in.

87
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:00,887
No. No, sir.

I don't want... them worryin'
or nothin',

89

so I'd like to be
the first to know.

no more, okay?

No, honey.

really, really want to do.

them bright lights...

and all the action.

172
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,280
Oh, baby,
it would be so perfect.

00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,093
Well, hell, if it means
that much to you, I'm game.

175
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,093
Let's do it.

176
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,163
- Oh!
- [Laughs]

177
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:30,164
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

178
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:31,699
Tell me.
I hate surprises.

179
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,597
Well, just see for yourself.

180
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:36,996
No.

181
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:39,666
You didn't.

182
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,037
- I did.
- ** <i>Oh, zeah...</i> **

183
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:43,338
You sure did. Whoa!

184
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:46,278
- Oh, my Lord.
- ** <i>Oh, zeah...</i> **

185
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,942
You did.
You horn dog, you.

186
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,609
See there?
Ain't she a beaut?

187
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,949
Dealer exclusive.
Anniversary special.

188
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,785
Boy, this son of a bitch
has got everything on it

189
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:57,290
except electric dick massage.

190
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,758
I can't believe you, Lonnie.

191
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:00,886
Are we really gonna take this
across the country?

192
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:02,861
Hell, yeah, we're gonna take it
across the country.

193
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:04,057
It's got to cost a fortune!

194
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,394
Nothing's too good
for my friends.

195
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:07,526
We're gonna be ridin'
and stylin' and profilin'.

196
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:09,604
It smells loud.
[Sniffs]

197
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:12,435
That's probably that Corinthian
leather, is what that is.

198
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,771
- I would imagine.
- That's real leather?

199
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:16,572
Well, hell, yeah,
it's real leather.

200
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:18,373
- Dang me.
- You know what?

201
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,108
Besides that, I had Jerome
unhook the odometer.

202
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:23,684
Sell the son of a bitch
like brand-new when we get back.

203
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:25,185
- [Laughs]
- See what I'm sayin'?

204
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:27,687
- You're my hero.
- What do you think, Ronnie?

205
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,122
- These wheels are sweet.
- Yeah, they are, ain't they?

206
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:31,453
[Engine revs]

207
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,458
Whoa! Whoa!

208
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:34,529
- You crazy?
- [Tires screech]

209
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,858
Hey, you guys!

210
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:38,865
Hey, Lonnie Earl,
where the hell have you been?

211
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,696
I haven't seen you in days.

212
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:43,135
Well, you know,
they keep me hoppin'. Yeah.

213
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:47,534
Oh, Lonnie Earl,

214
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:50,407
I got to stop by work
on the way out of town.

215
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:51,809
What are you talkin' about?

216
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:54,712
DARLENE: Roy got in a little bit
of trouble with daddy again.

217
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:57,115
It ain't got nothin' to do
with your daddy, baby.

218
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:59,710
- Yeah, well...
- Hey... you serious?

219
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,221
It ain't gonna take
but a minute.

220
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:04,656
You see this?
It's a TripTik.

221
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,660
It's called a TripTik.

222
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:08,627
Now, I took the trouble
to call AAA

223
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,960
and have them figure out
everything for us...

224
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,398
the whole schedule...
so we're gonna stick to it.

225
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:16,130
Everybody needs to read that
loud and clear, you understand?

226
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:18,001
DARLENE:
Honey, don't get so uptight.

227
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:19,404
I'm not uptight!

228
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:21,237
[Metal rattling]

229
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:23,368
[Steam hissing]

230
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,674
[Indistinct shouting]

231
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,183
Mr. Kirkendall?

232
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:36,748
Mr. Bush is as mad
as a riled-up bull

233
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,486
about that Beefy Nibby thing.

234
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:40,789
I didn't mean to put on
the wrong labels.

235
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:42,796
And I just feel plumb awful
about it, sir.

236
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:44,058
I need this job.

237
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,031
What if he fires me,
Mr. Kirkendall?

238
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:48,569
You ain't gonna get fired.
I promise you, okay?

239
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,230
Everybody makes mistakes.
I mean, hell, look at me.

240
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,137
Just ask my mama, okay?
[Laughs]

241
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:56,769
[Machinery whirring]

242
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,507
Good to see you, sweetie pie!

243
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:04,181
Lonnie Earl, that car's
runnin' great. Thanks.

244
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:05,344
Good deal, Fred.

245
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:06,614
Darlene...

246
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:08,952
you're lookin' beautiful,
as always.

247
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:10,615
DARLENE:
Thank you, Fred.

248
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:12,785
[Bell rings]

249
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:14,988
Roy...

250
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:17,657
you bumble-dick gourd head.

251
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:23,932
How about you, Fred?
Nice morning, ain't it?

252
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,007
Damn it, boy,
don't take that tone with me.

253
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:28,076
I will slap the taste
out of your mouth.

254
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:31,635
Do you even have any inkling
why you're here?

255
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:34,004
Well...

256
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:36,649
...no.

257
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:41,121
I have got 200 cases
of Ocean Delight

258
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,282
that are labeled
"Beef and Cheese Nibbies."

259
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,622
You tell me how the hell
somethin' like that happens.

260
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:48,127
Oh, no.

261
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,131
I am sorry.
It is my fault.

262
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,760
I got the cans mixed up,
and then Candy paged me,

263
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,634
and I had to... well...

264
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:58,831
[Telephone ringing]

265
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:01,307
I forgot.

266
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,674
But then why did you go ahead
and ship 'em?

267
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,680
We're talkin' about
cat lovers here, boy.

268
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:09,182
When the cat lover opens
the Beef and Cheese Nibbies,

269
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:11,149
he expects to find
Beef and Cheese Nibbies,

270
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,847
not a fuckin' Ocean Delight!

271
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,116
Understood?

272
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:16,191
Yes, sir.

273
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:21,318
And just where in the hell
were you yesterday afternoon

274
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,228
- when all this was happenin'?
- He was at the house.

275
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,694
I needed him for something.

276
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:28,792
Oh?

277
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,300
Well, okay.

278
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:33,135
Why? What...

279
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:35,376
Wasn't nothin' wrong,
was there?

280
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:38,245
No.

281
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:39,905
You see... No, sir.

282
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:42,245
She's just checkin'
for when she's ovulatin'

283
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:44,182
because we know how much
you want that grandbaby,

284
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,481
so when she pages, I come.

285
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:48,715
[Steam hissing]

286
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,683
I mean... I <i>go.</i>

287
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:55,092
[Chuckles nervously]
Well, you know what I mean.

288
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:57,256
[Bell rings]

289
00:11:57,366 --> 00:12:00,665
I don't even want to think
about that.

290
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:02,396
Just get the hell out of here.

291
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:06,367
LONNIE EARL: I'm glad
we're finally on the road.

292
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:09,542
Here's to a big ol' time.

293
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,703
Look out, Reno.

294
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,372
We're gonna put some hair
on the wall.

295
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:25,121
[Siren wails]

296
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:26,922
Well, shit on a stick.

297
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:31,156
It's just Russell and Boyd.

298
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:33,166
We're gonna be out of here
in a heartbeat.

299
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:34,326
All right, sir...

300
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:35,596
[Both laugh]

301
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:38,537
Hey, Lonnie Earl!
I didn't know that was you.

302
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,698
How is everybody?

303
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:42,299
How about you, Russell...
Boyd?

304
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:43,400
Hi, Candy.

305
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,479
Ooh-ee, man.

306
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,309
This is one fine vehicle
you got here.

307
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,974
Has that got that dick massage?

308
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:51,052
No.
Don't you start with me.

309
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:53,018
Listen, we're in kind of
a hurry.

310
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:55,055
We're goin' out of town
on vacation.

311
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:56,215
Whereabouts you goin'?

312
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:57,553
Reno, Nevada.

313
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:00,059
Y'all goin' to that
Monster Truck Jam out there?

314
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:01,993
Check this son of a bitch out.

315
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:03,155
Lucky sons of bitches...

316
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:05,995
goin' to the biggest
little city in the world.

317
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:08,126
Of course, that is
if we get there in time.

318
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:10,966
I'd love to sit here and talk
to you all day long.

319
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:12,631
You know that, don't you, Boyd?

320
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:15,209
But we got to get on the road,
so why don't you just let us go?

321
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,904
You know you ran
that stop sign back there.

322
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:20,345
I've been runnin' that
since I been drivin', Russell.

323
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:21,916
Everybody runs that damn sign.

324
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,814
- I know I do.
- [Laughter]

325
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,318
- See?
- Damn it, Boyd.

326
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:29,649
Look, Lonnie Earl,
I understand that and all,

327
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:32,693
but... you just shouldn't do it
right in front of us.

328
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:34,523
Just look at you...
you're sittin' there,

329
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:37,257
you're drinkin' that beer like
we was at the drive-in movies

330
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:39,425
and I wasn't wearin'
this here badge.

331
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:41,934
This is my first beer
of the day. I swear to God.

332
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:43,436
- I'll vouch for him.
- See?

333
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,130
- Me too, Boyd.
- Me three.

334
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,470
Come on, Russell.
Everybody makes mistakes.

335
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,976
Come on, Russell. Shit.

336
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:52,410
You know how fond of beer
you are, don't you?

337
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:53,845
[Laughing] Hey, now.

338
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:55,109
Right?
Isn't he, Boyd?

339
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,549
[Laughing] Oh, he hates it.
Swear to God.

340
00:13:57,652 --> 00:13:59,779
- [Laughter]
- What are you laughin' at?

341
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,223
Why don't I just hop up
on top of this truck

342
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:05,691
and unstrap a couple cases
and give it to y'all,

343
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:07,955
and let's call it even...
you know, as friends?

344
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:10,293
I wouldn't call that even.

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,668
Damn straight.

516
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:54,745
Okay.

517
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,708
I know the boy.

518
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,880
What was that you were talkin'
to Doc Tuley about...

519
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,886
about some tests or somethin'?

520
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,717
Nothin'.

521
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,051
Just insurance crap

522
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:08,387
where they make you pee
in a bottle all the time

523
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,927
every time you turn around.
[Sniffs]

524
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,122
But are you goin' swimmin'
or not?

525
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:15,961
I don't think so.

526
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:18,035
I'll just sink
like a cat in a bag.

527
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,865
You know what I think
I'm gonna do?

528
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,030
Go over the souvenir shop
and tease that rattlesnake.

529
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,199
[Laughs]
That's a good idea.

530
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,607
Besides that, Darlene's gonna be
back in a little bit.

531
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:29,509
She won't ever sneak in
no hotel pool.

532
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,515
Well, sometimes
when people are away from home,

533
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,609
they do things
they might not normally do.

534
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,451
[Hinges squeak, doors rattle]

535
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:41,787
Yeah, I wish.

536
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,793
[Crickets chirping]

537
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,453
All clear.

538
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:48,123
I can't believe I'm doin' this.

539
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,632
This is classy!

540
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,725
Somethin' we're not used to.

541
00:22:51,836 --> 00:22:53,463
God help us.

542
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:55,903
Whoo!

543
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,738
Whoo!

544
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:01,141
Oh, it's cold.

545
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:04,747
Oh!

546
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:06,407
- Get in, Dar.
- Whoo.

547
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,487
[Both laugh]

548
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:12,851
- Whoo!
- Oh!

549
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:14,322
Get away from me!

550
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,484
Whoo!

551
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:18,255
What do you weigh,
about 98 pounds wet?

552
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,264
Shut up, Dar.
You got a great body.

553
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,834
You just cover it up
all the time.

554
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,061
Whatever.

555
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,997
Are you happy, Dar?

556
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,665
I guess.

557
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:32,174
Why wouldn't I be?

558
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,110
Oh... I don't know.

559
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,113
I mean...

560
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:40,378
things just don't seem right
between you two lately.

561
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,180
I mean, I always believed

562
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,812
you two were meant
for each other, you know?

563
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,653
Like Burt and Loni.

564
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,320
Well, not like them, because
they ain't married no more.

565
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:55,593
But like... Elvis and Priscilla.

566
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,594
Well, you know what I mean.

567
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,467
Is there something you know
that I don't?

568
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,131
No! No, no, no.

569
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:06,039
No, Dar. No.
I don't know anything.

570
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:11,447
[Voice breaking] I just care
about you guys so much,

571
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:14,313
and especially you, Dar,
because you're my best friend.

572
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,444
Oh, honey...

573
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:20,456
And... can't a friend try
to help a friend?

574
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,153
Yeah, but, oh, honey,
don't cry.

575
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,991
Come here, silly.

576
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:29,396
Damn wine coolers got me
all emotional.

577
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,799
[Hinges squeak, gate rattles]

578
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,803
[Lmitating Tarzan]
Aah-ah-aah!

579
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,165
Oh!

580
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,970
Oh, dang.
That hurt like hell.

581
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,305
[Chuckles]

582
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:42,038
- Candy?
- Mm-hmm?

583
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,944
Do you love Roy?

584
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:47,145
[Chuckles] Well...

585
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,317
I don't think
I ever got the chance

586
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:54,653
to fall in love with Roy.
[Chuckles]

587
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,626
I guess it was more like
nature took its own course.

588
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,091
Next thing I knew...

589
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,260
Roy was workin' for daddy
and we was married.

590
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,771
Like there wasn't any middle...
just then and now.

591
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,103
Oh, shit.

592
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,304
What's wrong, Mark Spitz?
You seem a little out of shape.

593
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,471
[Roy groans]

594
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:20,711
Them 12-ounce curls are...
kinda takin' their toll.

595
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:23,013
[Candy laughs]

596
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,679
Oh. [Grunts]

597
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:28,281
I gotta go pee.
I'm gonna go back to the hotel.

598
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,953
- I gotta go pee.
- Darlin'...

599
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,620
I'm goin' back to the hotel.

600
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,290
Darlin', just pee in the pool.
I do it all the time.

601
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,958
Oh, gross, Roy.

602
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,535
You coming, Dar?

603
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:40,365
I think I'll swim a little.

604
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:43,201
This was a pretty good idea
after all.

605
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,367
See you guys up there.

606
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:46,534
See ya.

607
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,615
Whoo!
[Exhales deeply]

608
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,125
- [Coughs]
- Feels good.

609

[Sighs]

610
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,358
[Breathing heavily]
What you doin', Roy?

611
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,263
I've got you
a little somethin'.

612
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,909
Oh, Roy, you didn't have to.

613
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:20,978
I know,

614
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,242
but a lady like you should have
anything she wants.

615
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:30,932
DARLENE: Gettin' to New Mexico,
I was so excited.

616
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:33,539
The Grand Canyon was
just a day away.

617
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:35,609
RO Y: You know,
what I'm lookin' forward to

618
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,371
is that Robosaurus
smashin' them cars.

619
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:38,740
That is gonna be somethin'.

620
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:41,906
Robo what?
What on Earth is that?

621
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:45,577
That's a 10-story machine
that squashes things...

622
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,587
basically a car dealer's
nightmare.

623
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,951
DARLENE: What a thrill.

624
00:26:49,057 --> 00:26:50,718
[Thud, bottles rattling]

- Armadillo.
- You'd think

626
00:26:53,661 --> 00:26:56,960
them son of bitches would learn
to stay out of the road.

627
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:59,431
- You ever see one alive?
- [Laughs]

628
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,468
Well, I'll be damned.
97. 1 degrees.

629
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:03,628
I think I'm ovulatin'.

630
00:27:03,738 --> 00:27:06,434
97. 1 is what that library book
said to look for.

631
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,439
Whoa.

632
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,772
LONNIE EARL:
Maybe it's just the heat.

633
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:13,574
97. 1, Lonnie Earl.
That's below normal temperature.

634
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:15,444
She's probably too close
to the window.

635
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,986
My window's up, and according to
this thermometer,

636
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:22,215
farmer Roy needs to plant
his seed right now.

637
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:23,790
Come on, baby.
Pull over.

638
00:27:23,891 --> 00:27:26,917
No, we ain't stoppin'
at no motel. Not right now.

639
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:29,462
We just got back on schedule,
and I ain't gettin' off.

640
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,794
Who said anything
about a motel?

00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:34,595
[Candy moaning pleasurably,
suspension squeaking]

642
00:27:36,337 --> 00:27:38,931
You do realize that
my schedule's gone to hell.

643
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,439
Freezin'-ass cold out here,

644
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:42,441
and we're waitin'
on the damn carnival.

645
00:27:42,543 --> 00:27:45,603
You're the one who wanted to go
on vacation in January.

646
00:27:45,713 --> 00:27:47,442
You know what I told you
about July prices.

647
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:49,072
I can't pay that kind of money.

648
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,844
[Sniffs]

649
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:53,420
[Both moaning pleasurably]

650
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:55,421
CAND Y: Oh... Oh, baby!

651
00:27:55,523 --> 00:27:57,081
[Woman laughing]

652
00:27:57,191 --> 00:27:58,954
It's like we're travelin'

653
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,427
with a damn high-school
biology experiment or somethin'.

654
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,656
[Candy moans pleasurably]

655
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,528
What the hell is he doin'
to her?

656
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:07,191
Something pretty good, I'd say.

657
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:08,859
Well, it's pissin' me off.

658
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,336
Okay, that's it. I'm gonna put
a stop to this shit.

659
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,340
Good Lord. You're makin'
a bigger scene than they are.

660
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,342
[Laughter]

661
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,672
All right. [Knocks]

662
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,837
Oh.

663
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:20,311
That'll be plenty.

664
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:23,008
- What?
- Come on. We're leavin'.

665
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:24,846
[Applause]

666
00:28:24,952 --> 00:28:26,510
Mission accomplished, sir.

667
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,612
There goes the new-car smell.

668
00:28:28,723 --> 00:28:31,521
RO Y: You look kinda uptight,
Lonnie Earl.

669
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,684
You want me to drive?

670
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,456
Hell, no.
I'm the driver.

671
00:28:35,563 --> 00:28:38,293
Just get us a couple
of beers. I'll be fine.

672
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,299
- Hey, hon?
- Hmm?

673
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:41,629
Can you grab us a couple beers

674
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:43,795
without spillin'
any of them tadpoles?

675
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:45,964
I sure can, sugar kitten.

676
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:48,871
[Bottles rattling]

677
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:49,908
Thank you.

678
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:53,469
[Bottles rattling]

679
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:58,414
I'm glad we stopped here.

680
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,917
You know what?

681
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:02,580
They got a sign
over that toilet

682
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,318
says they got the cleanest
bathrooms along all of I-40.

683
00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:07,917
If we stay in Kingman tonight,
we'll be back on my schedule.

684
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:09,860
But we were gonna stop
at the Grand Canyon tonight

685
00:29:09,964 --> 00:29:11,864
and get up
and look at it tomorrow.

686
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:15,094
But we can't do that now because
our travelin' sex show here

687
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:16,932
has put us behind schedule.

688
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:18,801
Then why did we stop here?

689

1374
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,481
Bastard!

1375
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,644
Oh. [Sobs]

1376
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:53,484
Darlene, please wait.

1377
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:56,520
[Sighs]

1378
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,856
Darlene...
Darlene, please wait.

1379
00:59:58,962 --> 00:59:59,860
Shut up.

1380
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:01,521
Come on.
We have to talk about this.

1381
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,997
You're my best friend.

1382
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,158
Best friends?

1383
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,862
Best friends don't do that
to best friends.

1384
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:12,473
Enjoying your stay, sir?

1385
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:13,770
Oh, shut up.

1386
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:14,844
Okay, then.

1387
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:19,649
[Door opens, slams]

1388
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:22,775
I've known you
since the third grade.

1389
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:25,855
Just how long have you two
been visitin' Sin City?

1390
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:29,223
Twice.
Just two times.

1391
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:30,793
I swear to God, that's it.

1392
01:00:30,894 --> 01:00:32,452
What are you doin'?

1393
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:34,120
Baby, we need to talk.

1394
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:35,459
Not now, Roy!

1395
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:37,624
Can't you see I'm tryin'
to console Darlene?!

1396
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,828
Oh, I don't want your consolin'!
That's your husband!

1397
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:43,132
He's the one who needs
your consolin'!

1398
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,298
I'm fine.

1399
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:46,170
That's okay.
You can go first.

1400
01:00:46,276 --> 01:00:49,177
Damn it, Roy!
Show some backbone, will you?!

1401
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,473
Why are you mad at me?!

1402
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,980
Why are you yellin' at him?
He's just tryin' to be nice.

1403
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,175
Shut up, whore!

1404
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:56,184
LONNIE EARL:
All right, Roy.

1405
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:57,514
Come on, hit me.

1406
01:00:57,621 --> 01:00:58,713
- What?
- Hit me.

1407
01:00:58,822 --> 01:00:59,880
I got it comin' to me.

1408
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,958
It'll make you feel better.
It'll make me feel better.

1409
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,923
- You're gonna hit me back.
- I promise I won't hit back.

1410
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:04,994
Okay, come on!

1411
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:06,892
Oh, my God!
Lonnie Earl!

1412
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,828
Get off! Get off me!

1413
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:10,729
Get off him, you bastard!

1414
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,028
You hit him!

1415
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:14,160
You hit me
and then sleep with my wife!

1416
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:15,169
And you hit me!

1417
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,297
It was just a reflex action.
That's all it was.

1418
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:18,806
You really gotta
keep it down in...

1419
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:20,399
Get the fuck out!!

1420
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,205
Yeah.

1421
01:01:22,328 --> 01:01:24,558
Hold on.
Hey, listen.

1422
01:01:24,664 --> 01:01:27,030
I got a great idea, okay?

1423
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:29,328
I know how to fix everything.

1424
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,300
Darlene and Roy
got to sleep together.

1425
01:01:31,404 --> 01:01:33,463
It'll make it even.
It's like a dealer trade-in.

1426
01:01:33,573 --> 01:01:35,097
- You are such a sick fuck!
- What?

1427
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:37,438
Have you finally lost
your mind?!

1428
01:01:37,543 --> 01:01:42,480
And if I wanted a make-up fuck,
it would be with Tony Orlando!

1429
01:01:42,582 --> 01:01:43,810
Jesus, help me.

1430
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:47,545
I feel so raw,
like I haven't got any skin!

1431
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:50,854
This is wrong.
It's just wrong.

1432
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,049
I know. It's wrong.

1433
01:01:52,158 --> 01:01:54,251
And if I could
just wiggle my nose

1434
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,918
like Samantha on "Bewitched"

1435
01:01:56,029 --> 01:01:58,589
and make this all go away,
Darlene, I would.

1436
01:01:58,698 --> 01:02:00,427
You'd probably call up
Aunt Clara,

1437
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:02,194
and Lonnie Earl
would fuck her, too.

1438
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,734
Hey... Whoa. Whoa.

1439
01:02:03,836 --> 01:02:05,133
Hey, honey, listen.

1440
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:06,637
Listen. Calm down.

1441
01:02:06,739 --> 01:02:08,001
Don't tell me to calm down!

1442
01:02:08,107 --> 01:02:10,905
Calm down. Let me go with you
and we'll talk.

1443
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:12,910
I don't want to be around you.

1444
01:02:13,012 --> 01:02:15,037
I don't want to be around
any of you.

1445
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,046
No. Darlene...

1446
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,275
You're gonna need
your eyedrops.

1447
01:02:17,383 --> 01:02:19,647
My eyes are just fine.

1448
01:02:19,752 --> 01:02:21,481
They're just fine.
I don't need 'em.

1449
01:02:21,587 --> 01:02:23,487
Everything's crystal clear.

1450
01:02:23,589 --> 01:02:25,489
Please don't go.
Darlene, wait a minute.

1451
01:02:25,591 --> 01:02:27,650
[Breathing heavily]

1452
01:02:29,862 --> 01:02:31,329
[Elevator bell chimes]

1453
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:34,631
[Sniffles]

1454
01:02:34,734 --> 01:02:35,826
Hello.

1455
01:02:35,935 --> 01:02:38,597
This is definitely the shits.

1456
01:02:38,704 --> 01:02:40,433
I'm sorry, Roy.

1457
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,098
You know what?

1458
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:45,177
Sorry just ain't cuttin' it
right now, Lonnie Earl.

1459
01:02:47,447 --> 01:02:49,506
[Crying] Sugar kitten?

1460
01:02:49,615 --> 01:02:52,277
I'm in hell.
I hope everybody's happy.

1461
01:02:52,385 --> 01:02:54,148
[Sighs]

1462
01:02:54,253 --> 01:02:55,982
[Breathing heavily]

1463
01:02:56,089 --> 01:02:57,056
Friends?

1464
01:03:00,259 --> 01:03:02,489
Shit! Fuck!

1465
01:03:02,595 --> 01:03:05,063
[Panting, sniffles]

1466
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:09,567
[Crying]
Car number 5394, please.

1467
01:03:09,669 --> 01:03:11,864
Yes.
You have a good day, too.

1468
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:13,063
Darlene, wait!

1469
01:03:13,172 --> 01:03:15,663
You don't want to leave
like this.

1470
01:03:15,775 --> 01:03:17,174
Don't tell me what I want.

1471
01:03:17,276 --> 01:03:20,677
I'm sick and tired of people
tellin' me what I want to do!

1472
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:23,374
God, I fucked up.
I'm so sorry, hon.

1473
01:03:23,483 --> 01:03:25,041
We have to talk about this.

1474
01:03:25,151 --> 01:03:27,585
We're too close
to throw away what we got.

1475
01:03:27,687 --> 01:03:29,416
What we got?!

1476
01:03:29,522 --> 01:03:32,923
We got a fuckin' mess
is what we got!

1477
01:03:33,025 --> 01:03:35,289
And I had nothin'
to do with it!

1478
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:36,452
[Sniffles]

1479
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:37,620
Yes, you did.

1480
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,061
Oh, excuse me?

1481
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:42,066
You did have somethin' to do
with it, Darlene.

1482
01:03:42,168 --> 01:03:44,864
Hell, Lonnie Earl was cryin'
for your attention,

1483
01:03:44,971 --> 01:03:46,871
and you refused to see it.

1484
01:03:46,973 --> 01:03:48,998
So he came to me to talk
about it,

1485
01:03:49,108 --> 01:03:51,576
and I was just tryin' to be
your friend, so I listened.

1486
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:54,612
And before you knew it, he was
spinnin' you like a helicopter.

1487
01:03:54,714 --> 01:03:56,011
You bitch.

1488
01:03:56,115 --> 01:03:58,106
And you call yourself
my friend.

1489
01:03:58,217 --> 01:04:01,118
You're damn right I do.
[Panting]

1490
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,278
In case you forgot,

1491
01:04:02,388 --> 01:04:04,288
I tried to talk to you
about it, too,

1492
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:06,790
and you kept tryin' to
convince me and yourself

1493
01:04:06,893 --> 01:04:08,121
that everything was great,

1494
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:09,626
that life was just
one big bowl of cherries!

1495
01:04:09,729 --> 01:04:11,458
Oh, go away!

1496
01:04:11,564 --> 01:04:13,964
You know what?
You're a fuckin' mole.

1497
01:04:14,066 --> 01:04:16,933
And I'm not talkin' about that
thing on Cindy Crawford's lips.

1498
01:04:17,036 --> 01:04:20,096
I'm talkin' about rodents that
bury themselves in the ground.

1499
01:04:20,206 --> 01:04:23,107
They got eyes, but since they
don't use 'em, they can't see.

1500
01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:24,767
Come on, elevator.

1501
01:04:24,877 --> 01:04:26,105
Just go ahead.

1502
01:04:26,212 --> 01:04:28,271
Just run away, Darlene,
like you always do.

1503
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:30,281
Just so you don't
have to face anything.

1504
01:04:30,383 --> 01:04:31,441
Shut up.

1505
01:04:31,551 --> 01:04:33,781
You've got the world
by its balls,

1506
01:04:33,886 --> 01:04:35,854
and you don't even know it!

1507
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,924
[Panting]
And you know why?

1508
01:04:39,025 --> 01:04:44,053
Because you're always throwing
some goddamn Darlene pity party!

1509
01:04:44,163 --> 01:04:46,063
Mopin' around
in those stupid overalls,

1510
01:04:46,165 --> 01:04:49,566
feelin' sorry for yourself,
hidin' behind your kids!

1511
01:04:49,669 --> 01:04:52,263
God, you've got this prison
built into your head,

1512
01:04:52,371 --> 01:04:53,838
and you just love living there!

1513
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:55,271
Stop now!

1514
01:04:55,374 --> 01:04:56,432
No!

1515
01:04:56,542 --> 01:05:00,239
Wake... up, Darlene.

1516
01:05:00,346 --> 01:05:02,906
You've got a nice house,
your bills are paid,

1517
01:05:03,015 --> 01:05:04,312
you've got healthy kids,

1518
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:07,978
you've got friends who care
about you if you only let them.

1519
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:09,645
And, damn it,
you've got a husband

1520
01:05:09,755 --> 01:05:12,053
who thinks
you're worth fightin' for!

1521
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,388
He so desperately
wants to find

1522
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,518
the woman he fell in love with.

1523
01:05:16,629 --> 01:05:19,826
God damn it,
you could really enjoy life.

1524
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:25,098
If you open your eyes,
you'd see that I'm right.

1525
01:05:25,204 --> 01:05:28,503
All I'd see are your legs
up over my husband's shoulders.

1526
01:05:28,608 --> 01:05:30,041
[Elevator doors open]

1527
01:05:30,142 --> 01:05:31,700
Oh.

1528
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:34,006
- Don't go there.
- [Clears throat] Ladies.

1529
01:05:34,113 --> 01:05:35,740
The only thing
I'm still wonderin'

1530
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:38,146
is how a spoiled brat like you
fucked Lonnie Earl

1531
01:05:38,251 --> 01:05:39,980
without your daddy's
permission.

1532
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:41,485
[Both screaming]

1533
01:05:41,587 --> 01:05:42,485
Bitch!

1534
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:45,421
BELLHOP: No! Not in here!
Hey, come on!

1535
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:46,582
Roy, let's talk.

1536
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:47,590
Oh, shut up.

1537
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:49,593
They're gonna kill each other.

1538
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,458
[Elevator bell chimes]

1539
01:05:51,564 --> 01:05:52,792
Hey, just a sec.

1540
01:05:52,898 --> 01:05:54,627
- I just need to tell you...
- Stairs.

1541
01:05:54,734 --> 01:05:56,224
...I'm sorry about all of this.

1542
01:05:56,335 --> 01:05:58,064
- Later.
- Roy...

1543
01:06:01,674 --> 01:06:03,403
Let go of me!

1544
01:06:03,509 --> 01:06:06,069

DARLENE: Oh, and good news...
Candy had a 9-pound baby boy...

1898
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,902
The spittin' image of Roy.

1899
01:25:11,006 --> 01:25:13,839
Candy insisted
they name him Gunther.

1900
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:17,241
And after two more babies,
there was no debatin' it...

1901
01:25:17,346 --> 01:25:19,940
Roy's tadpoles were
most definitely swimmin'.

1902
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:22,812
As for us,
Lonnie Earl finally agreed

1903
01:25:22,918 --> 01:25:25,216
to see that marriage counselor
in Little Rock.

1904
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,515
And since then,
things have been lookin' up.

1905
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:30,649
I've been takin' a more active
role in the family business.

1906
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:33,626
And you'd be surprised what
it's done for my self-esteem,

1907
01:25:33,729 --> 01:25:35,287
not to mention our sales.

1908
01:25:35,397 --> 01:25:37,592
I guarantee you we won't be
undersold by anybody.

1909
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:39,530
And if you can't trust
ol' Lonnie Earl...

1910
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:41,068
Then you can trust Darlene.

1911
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:42,569
Hi, I'm Darlene Dodd

1912
01:25:42,671 --> 01:25:45,572
invitin' you to come on down
to Lonnie Earl Dodd Chevrolet,

1913
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:47,198
where you'll find
the best deals ever.

1914
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:50,107
So swing by Lonnie Earl Dodd
Dodge and Chevy

1915
01:25:50,212 --> 01:25:52,476
and say hello
to Ronnie the rooster here

1916
01:25:52,581 --> 01:25:54,173
or try your luck with Trudy.

1917
01:25:54,283 --> 01:25:56,046
Right now, we've got
a really great deal

1918
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:58,676
on a used maroon Suburban,
so come on over.

1919
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:01,085
And just remember,
if you can't trust Lonnie Earl,

1920
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:02,817
you can trust Darlene.
