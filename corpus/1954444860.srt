1
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:07,072
(car horns)

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,575
(sirens chirping)

3
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,283
(tires screeching)

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,352
- Whoa!
- (driver): Watch it, buddy!

5
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,779
- Here you go.
- Ah! Cavalry.

6
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,583
What is this?

7
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,019
- Coffee?
- What's in it?

8
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,488
- Uh--
- It isn't stevia.

9
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,991
- No, they were out.

10
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,294
- Rob, if you're gonna do
something nice, get it right.

11
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,630
- Yes, Captain.
- It's "Major" to you.

12
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,833
I've been promoted.
- Nice. Very seasonal.

13
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,035
- Now not one person's
put a tip in there all day.

14
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,704
- There you go, Major.

15
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,574
- As you were.
- Trick or treat, Sam.

16
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,981
Morning, Enid.
- Hi, Mr. Carelli!

17
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,885
- Let me guess, you're late
because you stopped

18
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,921
to buy Sam coffee again?

19
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,090
You can stop now. I've already
awarded you the "nicest guy

20
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,092
in the office" award.
- I like him.

21
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,961
- Why?
- He's honest.
- Oh, my!

22
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,031
- Emmett!
- Mm?

23
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,834
- Elyse Samford is coming in

24
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:45,637
next week to discuss
a trademark infringement
suit. That's the file.

25
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,907
I want precedents cited,
t's crossed, i's dotted.

26
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,176
- Who's Elyse Sanford?

27
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,378
- Samford! With an "m".

28
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,649
The new CEO of Samford Candy!
One of our biggest clients.

29
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,052
I don't care if you have
to work on that all weekend.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,054
Put 150% into that.

31
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,791
- Absolutely, Dad. I will
dedicate myself entirely to this

32
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,861
all weekend long and cancel
all my other plans. You got it!

33
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,896
All over it!

34
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,998
Sanford... Samford.

35
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:19,371
- Yes!

36
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,473
- Andrew.
- Hey.

37
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,276
- Dad wants precedents cited
on these by Monday.

38
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,279
Make sure you cross
the i's and dot the t's.
- This weekend? No, no, no.

39
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,449
I'm playing golf with--
- I don't care if you're golfing

40
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,385
with all four living
ex-presidents. Handle this.

41
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,455
(frustrated sigh)

42
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,925
Chin up, Rob.

43
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,928
- So, Rob, how's it going?

44
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,063
- Busy.
- Busy, yeah.

45
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,766
- And yet your billable hours
aren't even near the goal we set

46
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,801
at your last year-end review.

47
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:53,172
- I sort of felt the number
you set wasn't realistic

48
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,607
given the actual number
of hours in a day.

49
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,277
- Oh, Rob, Rob, Rob...

50
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:02,247
I see I'm going to have to help
you succeed despite yourself.

51
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,583
There you go!

52
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,623
- Let me guess.

53
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,692
Covering for Emmett and Andrew?

54
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,495
- Can you get me everything
you have on Samford Candy?

55
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,363
- You want me
to stay late with you?

56
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,832
- No reason for your evening
to be ruined, too.

57
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,834
- Hang in there.
Maybe one day

58
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,836
you'll get to live
the dream, too.

59
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,838
You never know.
(both laughing)

60
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:30,008
(phone ringing)

61
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:33,178
- Ruby!
- [Hey, Uncle Rob!]

62
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,180
- Hey, sweetie.
- [Ready for some bowling?]

63
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,149
- Well, that's um,
kinda the thing...

64
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,918
I can't make it tonight.
- [Don't stand me up!]

65
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,589
[You're my only uncle.]
- Uh-huh, I realize
I'm your only uncle.

66
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,625
- [I'm not taking
no for an answer.]
- Okay, okay! I'll come.

67
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,594
You ever think about
being a lawyer yourself

68
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,063
or has hanging around me
totally turned you off of it?

69
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,574
- Oh-oh! Ruby Cole in the house!

70
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:06,144
You owe me pizza!
With sausage and mushrooms.

71
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,680
- Girls your age
don't eat mushrooms.
- I'm precocious.

72
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,849
- I'm well aware of that.

73
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,218
Just because you got a strike
doesn't mean you're
gonna beat me.

74
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,727
- Just 'cause you're a guy
doesn't mean you're
gonna beat me.

75
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,862
Kelly Kulick--
- Won the PBA Tour title

76
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,365
against a man
in 2010, I know.

77
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,541
- Your feet got
ahead of your swing.

78
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,777
- Really, Dad?

79
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,313
'Cause I think I've beaten you
two games to one today.

80
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,349
- It's called a head start.
(both laughing)

81
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,918
- Excellent bowler!

82
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,895
- You know what? They say
the strength in the wrist

83
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,232
diminishes with age. I think
I'm gonna get you a wrist guard

84
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,367
for your next birthday.
(laughter)

85
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,569
- Highly unlikely, my dear.

86
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,571
Highly unlikely.

87
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,074
- Want me to go talk you up
to her? She's with her dad.

88
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,477
- You've got to stop trying
to fix me up. I'm doing fine.

89
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,751
- Ah! La-la-la-la...
- You're killing me, dad!

90
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,621
Give me a break!

91
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,657
No, seriously, I need a break.
Do you want a snack?

92
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:30,095
- No, I think I'm just
gonna stay here and gloat.

93
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,164
- You haven't had a date
since that lawyer lady

94
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,866
closed the file on you.
- I'm good. I've just been busy.

95
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,469
I'll meet someone
when I meet someone.

96
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,672
- Hey, can I get a candy bar?

97
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,777
Thanks.

98
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,490
- Hi.
- Hey. Buying some candy?

99
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,460
- Yep.
- Which one are you gonna get?

100
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,165
- My favorites.
(chuckles)

101
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,668
- Ruby!

102
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,071
- Just so you know,
he's single

103
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,441
and a lawyer. Very successful.
- Impressive. You must
be very proud.

104
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,211
- I am.

105
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,216
- Hey.
- Hi!

106
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,855
Nice kid you've got here, Ray.

107
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,725
- She sure is, but that's not--
- Got great taste in candy.

108
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,934
- What?
- Come on!

109
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,537
You had such an opportunity
and you just wasted it!

110
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,039
- Really?

111
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,609
- It's always good to get
you out of the office.

112
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,011
Those two guys at work still
giving you a hard time?

113
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,046
- Their daddy's the boss.

114
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,282
- I wish I could
cast a spell on them.

115
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,051
- Excellent idea!

116
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,387
- But I mean,
you're a cool guy,

117
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,556
so why do they have
to treat you like that?

118
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,591
- When you're the low man
on the totem pole,

119
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,527
everyone else gets to
stand on top of your head.

120
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,229
- You're too nice.
- You can't be too nice.

121
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,165
- Yeah, you can.

122
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,570
(insects chirping)

123
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,572
- Hi!

124
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,308
- Here she is.
Safe and sound.

125
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,978
- Can Uncle Rob
hang out with us, Mom?
- Sorry, gotta get back to work.

126
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,048
- You know it's very important
I spend time with appropriate
male role models.

127
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,717
- That's why I just
took you bowling, buddy.

128
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,520
- I'm almost finished
with your Halloween costume.
Do you want to come try it on?

129
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,558
- See you next week, Uncle Rob.
- Bye.

130
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,829
- Thank you.
- My God, it's just so awesome!

131
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,381
(sigh)

132
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,228
(groaning)

133
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,580
- Stevia.

134
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,416
- Attaboy!
Worked all weekend again?

135
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,519
- No.
- Really?

136
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,723
What did you do?
- For one thing, I went bowling.

137
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,926
- Ah, impetuous youth!

138
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,629
(chuckling)

139
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,298
You, sign in.

140
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,767
- Are you kidding me?
You see me every day!

141
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,869
- Sign in.

142
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,838
- Do you have any idea what
dealing with you is like?

143
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,974
- Disturbing and frustrating?
- Yeah, on a good day.

144
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,343
- Thank you.

145
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,013
- Make sure to have the
restrooms cleaned, spotless.

146
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,582
Yes, get to work. Send those
to the third cubicle.

147
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,953
- What's going on?

148
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,888
- Uh, Samford Candy.

149
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,957
Something about some trademark
infringement lawsuit.

150
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,092
- Oh, that explains
my weekend...

151
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,129
or lack thereof.
Any inside info?

152
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,098
- Howard Samford is retiring
and handing the company over

153
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,668
to his daughter Elyse.
She's a Princeton grad.

154
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,470
No dummy, but not a lot
of practical experience.

155
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,839
- Merry, you are
a fount of information.

156
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:39,344
- Awesome! Good work,
people! Nice!

157
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,247
Hi.

158
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,483
Did you put 150% into that?
- Always do.

159
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,552
- Excellent.

160
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,522
Well, this is a major client.
You should feel very pleased

161
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,725
that I trust you enough
to allow you to work on this.

162
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,928
- Just spending time with him
is privilege enough.

163
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,165
- Carelli!

164
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,136
Look, when Ms. Samford gets
here I want you to join us

165
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,138
in the conference room,
okay? Just me and the boys

166
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,909
looks a little too
nepotistic. You can talk,

167
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,278
just not much.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,251
(phone ringing
in the background)

169
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,887
- Samford...

170
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:28,593
Elyse Samford...

171
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,463
Ooh!

172
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,670
- Ms. Samford!
- Hey.

173
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,606
- Mr. Samford!
- Hi.

174
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,376
- Mr. Higgins is waiting for
you, but can I get you anything
before I take you back?

175
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,544
- I'm okay.
- Nothing for me, thank you.

176
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,214
- Alright, please have a seat.
It will just be a moment.

177
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,019
The Samfords are here. Yes.

178
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,193
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I never had to wear heels

179
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,130
when I was working in the field.
I'm only good for about an hour.

180
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,599
- Alright.
(beeping)

181
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,969
Yes? Alright, thank you.

182
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,138
Alright, we'll be meeting
in conference room one,

183
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,340
if you'll follow me.

184
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,280
- Hello, Elyse.
Nice to see you!

185
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,849
How are you? Howard,
this is a surprise!

186
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,086
- Carter, always.
- Please sit down.
- Nice to meet you, Ms. Samford.

187
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,923
- You know, you
look familiar.

188
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,025
- Really?
- Wait a minute.

189
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:37,228
It was last week, at the
Sustainable Harvest conference,

190
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,230
right?
- Oh!

191
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,366
Yes, yes, absolutely! Are you
into organic gardening too?

192
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,036
- Yeah, I am up to my elbows.
(chuckling)

193
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,405
- Wonderful.
- (Rob): Sorry I'm late.

194
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,844
- Oh my gosh, small world! Um...

195
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,947
Ray, right?
With the adorable daughter?

196
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,851
- We sort of met already.
Rob, not Ray.

197
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,053
- No, but your shirt--
- Vintage.

198
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,055
And she's my niece. Not married.

199
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,257
- Nice to meet you.

200
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,060
- Nice to meet you as well.

201
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,796
- Before we get started, I just
want to take this opportunity

202
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,998
to officially
introduce you to Elyse.

203
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,167
She's been working with Samford
Candy since high school,

204
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,737
has her MBA at Princeton.
I feel very confident

205
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,139
that she's going to be
picking up where I'm leaving off

206
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,775
and taking the company
to new heights.

207
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,045
It's time for a generational
change at Samford Candy.
Meet the new boss.

208
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,080
(chuckling)

209
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,583
- Well, I will be looking
to Higgins and Sons for the same

210
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,419
wise guidance you've given
my father over the years.

211
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,155
And trust me, I know
that everybody thinks

212
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,491
that I just got this job because
I'm the old man's daughter...

213
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,127
Which would be exactly right.

214
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,429
But that's what happens in
a family-owned company, right,

215
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:48,500
"and Sons"?
(all laughing)

216
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,569
So I just want to make it clear.
I'm a collaborative person

217
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,939
and I look forward to us working
together. So let's get started.

218
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,075
- It looks as though
you're being greeted

219
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,410
with trial by fire.
What we have on the table here

220
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,713
is a trademark infringement

221
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,349
on Samford Candy
by the Kraus Candy Company.

222
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,086
- They've changed their name
to Sanford. Emmett?

223
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,255
- Now, by using
the name Samford,

224
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,957
with an "m" like Uncle Sam,

225
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,227
it has a distinct similarity
to Sanford, with an "n".

226
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,730
- The other way around.

227
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,100
- Right, whatever.
They're about the same thing.

228
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,536
- Which would be the point
of the suit.

229
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,672
- Yes. By using the name Sanford

230
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,908
and similar packaging,

231
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,477
the consumer is being led to
believe that they are purchasing

232
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:36,648
a product made by Samford.
Now, on the left,

233
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,917
Samford, as you know.

234
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,986
On the right, Sanford.

235
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:49,194
- This seems like a potential
profit opportunity for us.

236
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,230
How much are we looking at?
- They don't stand a chance.

237
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,232
- Yeah, we'll need
to seek an injunction.

238
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,569
- An injunction, damages,
punitive damages,

239
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,939
costs and fees.
That could be a lot of money.

240
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,408
- How much are we talking?

241
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,410
- Before we get ahead of
ourselves, there is potentially

242
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,213
a much larger problem.
Sanford has been cybersquatting.

243
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,748
This needs
to be addressed immediately.

244
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,817
- As I pointed out to you
before the meeting,

245
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,919
thanks for bringing that up.
- No one has registered

246
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:19,357
samfordcandy.com. You should
jump on that right away.

247
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,125
- Dot everything,
sir. I am on it.

248
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,328
- By the way, Emmett,
nice piece of work there.

249
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,864
- Our clients deserve
our full attention.

250
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,266
if that means me missing out on
a weekend or a bunch of sleep,

251
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,870
so be it.

252
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,272
- Andrew will be
taking point on this.

253
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,341
- Of course, dad.

254
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,676
- Wonderful. Well, thank you all
for your hard work.

255
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,845
I fell Samford
is well taken care of.

256
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,181
And Rob, good job
jumping on the cybersquatting.

257
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,216
- My pleasure.

258
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,485
- This case is our
top priority, Ms. Samford.

259
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,554
- That's good to
hear. We do have

260
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,322
the annual Halloween Ball
coming up, as you may know.

261
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,992
It would be a shame to have
this hanging over our heads.

262
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,027
- Just leave it with us.

263
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,396
- Terrific. Well
done, as always.

264
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:02,367
- Nice to see ya, Howard.
- Thanks, Carter. Thank you.

265
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:06,237
- (Howard): Gentlemen.
- Pleasure as always, sir.

266
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,842
- She's amazing.

267
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,979
Smart, beautiful, funny.
- Rich!

268
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,715
- She sounds perfect. When
are you asking her out?

269
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,985
- Not sure how ethical that
would be while representing her.

270
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,488
- I think that only applies
in divorce cases.

271
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,990
(phone ringing)

272
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,892
Who are you texting?

273
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,829
- Boss' son. He's dropping
some work off for me.

274
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,898
- Again?
- Yeah.

275
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,634
- Are you... Another round,
darling, please.
- Coming up.

276
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,803
- Do you want us to
verbally lacerate him?

277
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,739
- I would love
you to. But don't.

278
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,409
- Okay, so when
you ask her out,

279
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,411
tell her to bring a
rich friend of hers

280
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,113
so that I can...

281
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,249
Please set me up
with a rich...

282
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,818
- I wouldn't think you have time
to be sitting around here, Rob.

283
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:57,055
- My plate was totally clear
when I left the office.

284
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,391
- Look, Rob...

285
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,593
You want to succeed
with our firm?

286
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,530
You gotta come in earlier
and stay later than
everybody else. Alright?

287
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:09,367
You gotta clean out your plate,
and then you take a look around
and say, "What else can I do?

288
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,937
What can I take off
of Andrew's plate? What can
I take off of Emmett's plate?"

289
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,673
You don't just want
to be adequate, alright?

290
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,842
You want to be
exceptional.

291
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,045
- When do you need this?

292
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,781
- Bright and early.

293
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,918
As a matter of fact, you are not
gonna have time to finish this.

294
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,120
Mmm!

295
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,892
See you in the morning.

296
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,195
- Oops!
(glass shattering)

297
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,230
- Rob!

298
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,967
- I'm so sorry.
- He is so sorry.

299
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,404
- You shut up.
- You are mean.

300
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:50,975
- Can I just ask one question?
- Massive student loans,

301
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,845
bad economy,
and no one's hiring.

302
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,815
Bye, guys.

303
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,284
- Thanks, Rob.
That's too much!

304
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:11,295
- Morning, Sam.
- FYI, your boss is a tool.

305
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,731
- Which one? I have three
and they're all tools.

306
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,201
- Tall. Dark. Skinny.
- Emmett. What did he do?

307
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,838
- Asked me to find
a new job because the
sight of me depresses him.

308
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:24,342
- He actually said that to you?
Sam, I'm really sorry.

309
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,844
- Are you kidding?
It made my day!

310
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,014
(chuckling)

311
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,450
- Energy drink
in your coffee?

312
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,021
- Attention,
everyone! Attention!

313
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,991
Ms. Samford here has
a very exciting announcement

314
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,993
for the office.
- Hey, everyone!

315
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,295
As new CEO of Samford Candy,

316
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,265
this year I have decided
to invite the entire firm

317
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,267
to our annual
Halloween Ball!

318
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,836
(cheering)

319
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,405
So please come.
Wear a costume,

320
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,507
but none of this wearing a suit

321
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,776
and saying you're
dressed as a lawyer.

322
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,379
(laughter)
I'll see you all at the ball!

323
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:05,116
(indistinct chatter)

324
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,989
(birds chirping)

325
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:15,560
Hey, Dad!

326
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,695
- Hi there! Nice to see you.

327
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,933
Crazy day!

328
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,068
- So do you think you can handle
slumming it for a while?

329
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,737
- Well, it beats plaster dust
and power tools,

330
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,974
banging and crashing.
(sighing)

331
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,343
- You're lucky that you have a
daughter with a spare bedroom

332
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,512
to help you with your
renovation habit.

333
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,547
- I sure am!
- (laughing): Coffee?

334
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,883
- Crazy not to.

335
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,921
- Do you want to know who
I'm gonna be for Halloween?

336
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,457
- Who?
- Kelly Kulick.

337
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,993
- No one's gonna
know who that is.

338
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,928
- People aren't gonna know
one of the greatest bowlers

339
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,197
of all time?
- I'm thinking no.

340
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,633
- Well, I'll know
and it will be cool.

341
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,703
Only trick or treating all night
with a heavy bowling ball

342
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,771
might be tough.

343
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,407
- You could make one out
of Styrofoam and paint it.

344
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,211
- My mom can make me one.
What about you?

345
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,480
Are you gonna do that
"I'm not wearing a costume

346
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,550
because adults
should dress like adults
on Halloween" thing again?

347
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,819
- Actually, I'm wearing
a costume this year.

348
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,787
- Truth?
- Yeah.

349
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,690
I'm going to a Halloween ball
given by Samford Candy

350
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,493
and I hear they have
some pretty amazing things

351
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,929
in their gift bags,
some of which

352
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,131
might even go to you.

353
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:31,102
- You are getting in a costume
and going to a Halloween party?

354
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,771
What the heck
happened to you?

355
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,973
- Man to man?

356
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,876
Man to girl...

357
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,748
- I'll never tell.

358
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,017
Mom!

359
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:49,053
Uncle Rob is in love!
- That's not what I said!

360
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,522
- He's going to this big
fancy ball she's throwing

361
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,424
and he asked for a costume.

362
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:57,295
- Don't you know my kid has
the biggest mouth in town?

363
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,264
- I do not!
- Mm-hmm...

364
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,567
- Give me a break!
I just told my mom!

365
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,902
- Are you really gonna wear
a costume? I haven't seen you

366
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,904
get dressed for Halloween
since you were about ten.

367
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,740
- I know. I was a vampire cowboy
three years running

368
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,642
before I decided
I hated costumes.

369
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,078
What am I gonna wear
and not feel like an idiot?

370
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,447
- I will make something for you.

371
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,950
Let's get you measured.

372
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,086
- I can't believe you!
- What?

373
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,889
- Alright...
- You don't have to do
this. I can buy something.

374
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,857
- When your sister makes
costume suits for a living,

375
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,227
I don't think so. 32.

376
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,863
So... What is going on?

377
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,166
How serious are you
with this girl?

378
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,134
17.
- Ruby's a little premature.

379
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,237
I haven't even asked her
on a date yet.

380
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,541
- Oh. Well, what do you
want to go as?

381
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,744
Pirate? Gangster?

382
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,914
- How about the prince
of the uncles?
- (laughing): 40.

383
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,216
I don't know what kind
of prince that would be,

384
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,585
but what about
a regular prince?

385
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:58,055
Rob, stop moving.
- Okay.

386
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,727
- I'm speechless!

387
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,895
- Dad, I was thinking...

388
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,265
We should try and move the
company forward by making it

389
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,468
more environmentally friendly.
- I'm listening.

390
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,604
- So if we use plant protein
instead of animal whey protein,

391
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,606
it's better for
the environment

392
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,975
and it makes our candy
safe for vegetarians.

393
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,444
- It might raise costs.
- But I was thinking,

394
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,981
if we publicize our company
as a family-run company

395
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,417
who cares about the world,
who cares about our consumers,

396
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,753
we might be able
to step up profits

397
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,657
and offset those increased
costs. What do you think?

398
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,925
- I think you're going to be
the most beautiful woman
at that ball.

399
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,295
- I mean about my idea.

400
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,998
- The smartest, with
the most beautiful ideas.

401
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,367
- It's not gonna be the same
at the ball without you.

402
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,904
- This ball is going
to be your night.

403
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,608
My being there would
just detract from that.

404
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,078
(chuckling)

405
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,547
(sighing)

406
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:00,117
- Okay, let me clean up
and then we're going dancing.

407
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,219
- Dancing?

408
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,355
Why?

409
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,791
- Because you're going to a ball

410
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:10,494
and as I recall from your prom,
you're a terrible dancer.

411
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,496
- It's Sunday night. Doesn't
she have school tomorrow?

412
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,732
- It's 7 o'clock. What time
do you think I go to bed?

413
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,567
- Homework?
- Let's go.

414
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,036
You need to have some fun.
- I went bowling.

415
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,105
I had food that doesn't come in
a paper bag. I already had fun.

416
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,008
- You are going
as the last male figurehead

417
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,377
of the Carelli family.
You need to represent.

418
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,149
♪♪♪

419
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,318
- Is this the waltz?

420
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,320
- Yes. What else could it be?

421
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,656
Alright... Lift your hand.

422
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,325
Like that. Okay?

423
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,127
Let's see what you've got,
little bro.

424
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,129
(both laughing)

425
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,198
Sorry!

426
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,834
You are worse
than I remember.

427
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,169
- Can we go now?
- If you can walk,

428
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,138
you can dance.
The waltz starts

429
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,640
with the box step, okay?
You know the box step?

430
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,809
- Uh...

431
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,847
- Okay. Ruby, come and show
your uncle the box step.

432
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:06,650
I will be you, but better.
(chuckling)

433
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,719
Are you ready?
- Yeah.

434
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,924
- You never said anything
about turning.
(both laughing)

435
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,860
- Are you gonna let
a 12-year-old show you up?

436
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:19,163
Come on! Come here!

437
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,500
Alright, thanks. Basic...

438
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,568
box step.

439
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,705
- (both): One, two, three...
One, two, three...

440
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,508
- Now look up.

441
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,177
And stop moving your lips.
- Okay.

442
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,880
(laughter)

443
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,451
You're doing a lot better!
You haven't stepped on my feet

444
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,386
in a couple of minutes.
(both laughing)

445
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:46,323
Well, here's the secret.
Dance like you're one person.

446
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,325
- Sure, yeah!

447
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:51,862
One person with three left feet;
two of them mine.

448
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,701
I am going to have
blisters on my feet.

449
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,070
- Toughen up, buttercup.

450
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,440
- Do you want some tea?
- I gotta get home. It's late.

451
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:06,811
- Who are you, Cinderella?
- Yes, and you're my
fairy godmother.

452
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:10,047
I still have work to do.
Can you wave your magic
wand and make it disappear?

453
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,650
- Sure thing.
(chuckling)

454
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,588
- Practice.

455
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,825
(humming)

456
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,362
- Ladies.

457
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,898
(sighing)

458
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,167
- A lot.
- Yeah.

459
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,136
- Eight o'clock! Oh no!

460
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,406
Okay...

461
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,220
- Hey, pal!

462
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,424
- Sorry.

463
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,559
- (woman): Taxi!

464
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,929
- No coffee today, sorry.
- You look terrible.

465
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,332
They're taking
advantage of you, pal.

466
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,334
You need to start
standing up for yourself.

467
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,469
- What I need is
to keep my job.

468
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,005
(video game sounds)

469
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,175
- Andrew! Where's the
trademark infringement filing?

470
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,844
- The...?

471
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,880
- The Samford
trademark infringement.

472
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,549
- I gave it to Rob.
- I assigned it to you.

473
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,852
- I just gave it to him to cross
the t's and dot the i's.

474
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,522
Dad, he doesn't earn
his money around here.

475
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,191
He sits around all day
doing nothing!

476
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,694
Definitely not
putting in 150% like I am.

477
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,898
- Carelli!

478
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:37,801
Carelli?
- I think he just stepped out.

479
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,803
- Sir?

480
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,106
- What does your
watch say, Carelli?

481
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,875
- 10:15.

482
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,711
- 10,000.
- I don't understand.

483
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,747
- That's how many attorneys

484
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,682
lost their jobs at
major firms this year.

485
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,285
Did you know that?
- I... I didn't.

486
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,320
- How would you like
to make it 10,001?

487
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,023
- No, sir.
- Mr. Carter,

488
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,525
Mr. Carelli is always here
before everyone else.

489
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,895
I'm sure he had a good reason.
- A lot of legal secretaries
out of work too.

490
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,698
- She had nothing
to do with this.

491
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,200
- My sons can't be expected
to do everything themselves.

492
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,570
Someone has to help
with the heavy lifting.

493
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:15,906
- I realize that.
- Pattern yourself after them.

494
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:19,076
- I will. Thanks for
your understanding.

495
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,779
- I think you should stay
until 10:15 tonight.

496
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,815
Maybe dot some i's,
cross some t's.

497
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:35,259
- Want me to stay with you?
- No, I got it.

498
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,528
- Yeah...

499
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,665
I think I'm gonna stay with you.

500
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,740
- Still working?

501
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,843
- I'm just going over the
quarterly projections.

502
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,946
What do you think

503
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,449
about if we go into gum
or breath mints?

504
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,818
- I think you're in charge
of the company now.

505
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,786
It's your baby.

506
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,655
(small laugh)

507
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,224
- Right.

508
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,260
- Hey, I wouldn't have
put you in charge, CEO,

509
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,263
if I didn't think
you could handle it.

510
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,733
You're worried about
this trademark business?

511
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,469
- No. No, I know
we're in the right.

512
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:21,639
- When was the last time
you had some fun?

513
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:25,075
- I have fun.

514
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,011
- It's a very evasive answer.

515
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,780
- Okay, every time
we go bowling, I have fun.

516
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:33,851
(sighing)
(small laugh)

517
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,286
- Beautiful night,
isn't it?

518
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,589
- Yeah, I guess so.

519
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,791
- That fall snap is in the air

520
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,427
and the leaves are turning.

521
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,230
Wouldn't you rather be taking
a walk with your guy

522
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,766
than sitting here buried
behind your computer?

523
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,068
- Dad,

524
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,737
you've entrusted me
with a huge responsibility

525
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,773
and I just want
to live up to it.

526
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,542
- You know, when your
mother was alive,

527
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,744
I tried as best
as I could to manage

528
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:04,014
both the company
and a life with her.

529
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,016
And after she died,

530
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,819
I kind of lost myself

531
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:12,122
in the work. No fun,
no friends...

532
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,225
I never fell in love again.

533
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,831
Now that I'm retired,
I intend to change all that.

534
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,701
- Good.

535
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,342
- Lysie,

536
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,279
don't make the
same mistake I did.

537
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,981
When you're old and it's cold,

538
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,417
you're gonna want company.

539
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:43,053
<i>Not a company.</i>

540
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:09,113
(sighing)

541
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,756
(sighing)

542
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:37,474
- Hey, Rob!

543
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,877
Mm-hmm.

544
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,312
Uh-huh.

545
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,848
Yeah, looks good.

546
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,518
How many billable hours
would you say this represents?

547
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,686
- 25, minimum.

548
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:53,290
- Wow! That's great!
- Thanks.

549
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,225
- Of course, as lead attorney,
I'll be billing those.

550
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,295
You really need to get your
client base broadened, Rob.

551
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,131
This firm needs
more rainmakers!

552
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,734
Maybe work up a business
development pitch

553
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,571
and I'll take
a look at it. Chin up!

554
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,577
(groaning)
- What happened? Are you okay?

555
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,281
- I just dropped something.
All good.

556
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,653
<i> - Sanford's entire concept</i>

557
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,688
<i> was based on appropriating</i>

558
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:27,191
the worldwide recognition,
good will and success

559
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:31,295
of Samford Candy, in a...

560
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:35,165
In a, um...

561
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,368
In an intentional effort
to cause confusion

562
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,737
in the general public
between Sanford

563
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,940
and Samford candies.

564
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,375
Defendant's actions constitute
trademark infringement

565
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,045
in violation of
Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.,

566
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,980
section 1114.

567
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,549
- Anything else?

568
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,990
- Uh, yes, Your Honor.

569
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,792
We'd like to ask for
a temporary injunction

570
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,228
until the time that this
matter is adjudicated.

571
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:07,064
- So ordered.

572
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:10,000
Nicely prepared, young man.
- Thank you.

573
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,035
- Thank you, Your Honor.

574
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,204
No point in doing something
unless you're gonna do it right.

575
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:17,407
Right?

576
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,576
- Good morning.

577
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,879
- Boom! Crushed it!

578
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,981
- Yeah, sure did.

579
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,016
- Oh, wait till I tell
Elyse how I dominated!

580
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,051
- You're meeting with Elyse?

581
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,187
- Yeah. She asked for a full
report on the court appearance,

582
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:33,223
so I'm gonna explain to her
in detail everything I did.

583
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,459
- That should be interesting.

584
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,495
- Yeah, maybe you
should... You know,

585
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,064
come to the meeting too; just
to take notes or whatever.

586
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:05,722
(sighing)

587
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,927
(whistling)

588
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,697
- What's going on?
- I'm meeting with
Elyse Samford.

589
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,267
- You've got it bad!
- That obvious?

590
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,303
(chuckling)

591
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,338
- Mm-hmm!

592
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,607
- And then I filed for
trademark infringement

593
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,809
and got a temporary
injunction to stop Sanford

594
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,878
until the case can be heard.

595
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:32,249
- What about the domain name?
- Uh... Rob,

596
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,185
why don't you read
from your notes what
I told you about that?

597
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,121
- Um... That is covered

598
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,657
under the Anticybersquatting
Consumer Protection Act,

599
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,893
which need to be taken up
in Federal Court.

600
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,129
We filed on that as well.
- Exactly.

601
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,632
We've got you covered.
- Okay, great.

602
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,569
Well, Andrew, thank you.
I feel like I'm in great hands.

603
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,306
And thank you, Rob not Ray.
- You're good with names.

604
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,942
- I'm sure Ms. Sanford
has better things

605
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,178
to do with her time than to make
chitchat with you, Carelli.

606
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,081
- Samford.
- You're good with names, too.

607
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,683
- Uh, let me
walk you to your car.

608
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,386
- Sure.
- Bye, Ms. Samford.

609
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,621
- Oh, call me Elyse.

610
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,157
- So what do you drive?
I got an M3 convertible.

611
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,927
- Oh, I have a chauffeur.
- Fabulous!

612
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,634
- See you tomorrow, Sam.
- What's wrong with you?

613
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:26,937
You look like your
best friend just died.

614
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,673
Which would be me
and I'm still alive and kicking.

615
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,075
- You ever feel
like what's the point?

616
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,511
- No. No, I am constantly clear

617
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,279
on the meaning
and gift of life, my friend.

618
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,616
I'm what you'd call
a committed optimist.

619
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,785
- I guess I'm just tired. Sorry.

620
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,121
- Well, take a load off,
then. Come on, sit down.

621
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,757
And quit apologizing
all the time.

622
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,292
I'm the guy with
the meaningless job.

623
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,595
Too many hours,
not enough overtime.

624
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,698
But if you want to feel
sorry for yourself,

625
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,867
go right ahead.

626
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,536
- So what's your dream, Sam?

627
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,406
- What?
- What would make you happy?

628
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,211
- Alright, I'll tell you.
But if you're only asking me

629
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,380
just to get me to
ask you, forget it.

630
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,649
(small laugh)
- You don't have to ask me.

631
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,985
Do you ever think
about a woman?

632
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,020
- No, not since '98.

633
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,489
- What happened in '98?
- I became a realist.

634
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,893
- 'Cause there's this woman--
- No, no, not listening. No, no.

635
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,062
- She--
- I'm not listening.

636
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,598
- Fine.
- Man, you give up easily!

637
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,334
No wonder you're striking out
in the romance department.

638
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,370
Alright, here. I'll
get you started, okay?

639
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,873
She's absolutely
beautiful, right?

640
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,842
- Beautiful, smart.

641
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,877
- And?
- Powerful.

642
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,113
She's the CEO of Samford Candy.

643
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,615
- And?
- And she seems kind

644
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,617
and sort of vulnerable.

645
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,786
- So what's the problem?

646
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:54,124
- The problem is that
she's way above my level.

647
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,493
- So what? You want to be
on her level? Grow.

648
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,495
- She's the head of a
mega corporation, Sam.

649
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,564
I'm a lawyer. It's
a lot of growing.

650
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,933
- Nothing you can't overcome.
All you gotta do--

651
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,669
- Carelli! What do you
think you're doing?

652
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,338
- Um...
- Young man,
you represent this firm.

653
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,474
I don't ever want to see you
lounging like this again.

654
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,143
- That's my friend
you're talking to!
- I beg your pardon?

655
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,446
Stay out of it.
Step it up, Carelli.

656
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,649
- Thanks for trying.
- Forget it.

657
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,819
Hey, Rob.

658
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,123
I know these guys are working
you like a dog around here,

659
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,960
but you gotta make time to
interact with the outside world.

660
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,963
That's where the new
clients come from.

661
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:36,600
And that is what's gonna
make you a rainmaker, my friend.

662
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:40,370
It will also get these
other clowns off your back.

663
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,973
- So you're a lawyer now?

664
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,876
- Used to be.

665
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,711
You get one question.

666
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:51,014
- How did you get
from there to here?

667
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,285
- A woman named Lois.

668
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,320
(clears throat)

669
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,389
The love of my life.

670
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:03,393
We were partners
at the same firm,

671
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,862
until she "fell out"
of love with me

672
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,599
and fell into love
with the senior partner.

673
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:13,003
- That's harsh.
- Well, let's just call it

674
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,605
a "disincentive"
to continue practicing.

675
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,375
It's a nest of vipers.

676
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,111
- Do you ever think--

677
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:25,248
- No. No.

678
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,984
(indistinct chatter)

679
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,156
- Are you gonna ask
the candy lady out?

680
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,559
- Not until I make partner.
- Oh, come on!

681
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,627
Then I think you should go

682
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,596
to the speed dating thing.
- I'm not doing it!

683
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,631
- You're always complaining
about how you don't have

684
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,601
enough time to date. So this
is perfect. Speed dating...

685
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:47,237
Get it? For people who
don't have a lot of time.

686
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,306
- Ruby, I've had
plenty of girlfriends.

687
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,508
I honestly don't need your help.
- How about online dating?

688
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,476
I think you should
take a whack at that.

689
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,645
- Why do I have children
and security guards

690
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,714
giving me life advice?
- 'Cause you need it.

691
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:01,117
- Gee, thanks. Why do you care
so much if I have a girlfriend?

692
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:04,788
- I'm twelve. How interesting
do you think my life is?

693
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,327
(insects chirping)

694
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,866
- Look.

695
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,502
- Wow!
(small laugh)

696
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,505
- I keep telling you:
I'm gifted.

697
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,009
- You are going to kill!

698
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,679
- Helen, this is incredible!
I don't know how to thank you.

699
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,215
- Oh, come on.
Free baby-sitting is plenty.

700
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,851
- He isn't baby-sitting.
He enjoys my company.

701
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,020
- Yes.
- She's right!

702
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,789
So I'll be over at 6 o'clock
tomorrow. Ms. Kulick and I

703
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,259
are gonna go trick or treating
for a couple of hours

704
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,694
and then I'm off to the ball!

705
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,297
- As you command, my prince.
(chuckling)

706
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:50,100
- Good morning, Sam!

707
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,769
- Happy Halloween, Rob!
- Happy Halloween to you!

708
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,808
- I'm thinking of
going as a clown.

709
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,011
- You like clowns?
- No, I'm terrified of them.

710
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,013
I thought this would be
cheaper than therapy.

711
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,116
(both laughing)
Think this will get me a raise?

712
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:10,353
- Alright, guys
and girls! Attention!

713
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,556
We're letting you all go
fifteen minutes early

714
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,560
so you can go and get ready
for the Samford Halloween Ball!

715
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,999
Really? Nothing?

716
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,902
(soft cheering)
Hey, yeah!

717
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,519
- How did Sanford get the
domain name samfordcandy.com?

718
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,521
I thought you were on that!

719
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,424
- I was. I did. I registered it,
Dad. I swear I did!

720
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,859
- Well, you better get this
straightened out right away!

721
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,895
I don't care if
it takes all night!

722
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,963
- The ball is tonight!

723
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,333
I delegated this job to Rob.
This is not my fault.

724
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,436
- Then get him to do it!
Someone's got to handle it!

725
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,671
- Yes, Dad.

726
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,407
- You registered
sanfordcandy.com.

727
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,344
- So?

728
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,312
- So it's Samford,
with an "m".

729
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,248
Which means that Sanford, the
company we're fighting against,

730
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,851
can still buy domain names
Samford Candy needs.

731
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,887
- This is your fault, right.
You're gonna fix it.

732
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:21,591
- Wait, how is this my fault?
- I asked you to register it.
You must have misspelled it.

733
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,694
- No, that isn't true. You never
asked me to register anything.

734
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,062
- Are you calling me a liar?

735
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,798
- No, you said you'd handle it.

736
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,468
- You have to write
a motion to set aside.

737
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,838
It's gonna take all night. You
might as well forget the party.
- Listen, Emmett--

738
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,774
- If I see you at
the ball, you're fired.
- You're not serious?

739
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,943
- Try me.

740
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,491
- I'm sorry, Ruby. There's no
way I can leave and take you
trick or treating.

741
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,926
- [You're going to the ball--]
- I can't go to the ball either.
- [What about the costume?]

742
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,662
[It's gorgeous!]
- I'm stuck in the office.

743
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,765
Tell your mom I'll wear
her costume next year,

744
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,900
if I can.
- [It's not gonna be the same]

745
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,302
[without you.]
- Have fun.
- [Bye.]

746
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,884
(typing on keyboard)

747
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,524
- Sorry, sweetheart. No can do.
- Just let me go up
for a minute.

748
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,094
- No trick or treating in the
building. There's nobody here.

749
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,563
- What about Rob Carelli?
He's my uncle.

750
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,766
- You're Ruby! His Ruby!

751
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,802
Yeah, he talks about
you all the time.

752
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:41,538
Just go on up.

753
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,347
- You don't even
have a door on your office?

754
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,883
- It's a step up from the
cubicle I used to have.

755
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,119
- Dreaming big, uncle Rob?
- What are you doing here?

756
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,121
- You gotta go
to this ball, man.

757
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:01,057
- I can't. I haven't even
finished up Emmett's mess

758
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,992
and if he sees at the ball,
I'm fired.

759
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,296
- Has he seen your costume?

760
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,898
Then you're going to the ball!
- I really can't, buddy.

761
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,034
- You really can.
- I have tons of work

762
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,736
and they lock
the building down at midnight.

763
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:18,241
- So? No problem. You just
gotta be back here by midnight.

764
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,811
- Or what?
I turn into a pumpkin?

765
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:25,448
(animated chatter)

766
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,933
(people laughing)

767
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,913
Merry, it's Rob.

768
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,449
- You're not
supposed to be here.

769
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,518
- I'm well aware of that.
I'm just going to avoid

770
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:04,621
Higgins senior and juniors.
- Did you get the motion done?

771
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,323
- Almost. I'm going to go back
before midnight and finish up.

772
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:10,159
- Don't forget to cross
those i's and dot those t's.

773
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,738
You go over there!

774
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,840
Look, tonight, you're
not an associate.

775
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,975
You're a prince!
Go act like one!

776
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,818
- Good evening, my princess.

777
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,121
- Strange coincidence!

778
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:41,124
- Maybe it's not a coincidence.
Maybe it's synchronicity.

779
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,693
- I'm Elyse Samford.

780
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,628
- Yeah, I know.

781
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:48,398
- Okay, this is usually

782
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,333
where you tell me
what your name is.

783
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,635
- Remember that old
board game, Mystery Date?

784
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,438
Tonight, I'm your mystery date.

785
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,941
- I kinda like that.

786
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,843
Okay, so what do you do
when you're not princing?

787
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,946
- I can't tell you that either.

788
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,315
- Okay, so what
can we talk about?

789
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:09,352
- You, the night...

790
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:13,590
Bowling.
- Bowling?

791
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,059
- It's one possibility.
We don't have to.

792
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,394
I know a lot of
people find it lame.

793
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:22,065
- No! I'm a big
Kelly Kulick fan.

794
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:25,368
I mean, you've got
to love a woman who took
a PBA title away from a man.

795
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:29,305
I have a custom Storm. I have

hook, but I'm working on it.

00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:35,345
And I love bowling with my dad.

798

843
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:36,846
Thanks.

844
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,282
(frustrated groan)

845
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:45,955
(indistinct chatter)

846
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,316
- Sam, Emmett's right behind me!
I need you to slow him down.

847
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,751
- My pleasure. Nice suit!

848
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,222
(panting)

849
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:28,531
(elevator bell ringing)

850
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:39,108
Yeah? Help ya?

851
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:41,544
- Open it up. I need to get
in the office. Open the door!

852
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,146
- Oh, right! I didn't recognize
you in your getup there.

853
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,382
This should do it.

854
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,085
(grunting)

855
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,288
No, no.
(small laugh)

856
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:55,124
Drive you crazy, uh?
I'm pretty sure that's it.

857
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,226
Yeah, there you go.

858
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,597
(nervous sigh)

859
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,902
- Come on, get in!

860
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,906
- (Sam): There you go.

861
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:15,811
They should have
a turnstile on that.

862
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,313
You could get a can opener
for that thing!

863
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:20,750
I will let it
slide this time.

864
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:45,574
(panting)

865
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,187
- Oh!

866
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,890
You've been busy, Carelli?

867
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:04,960
You're only missing out on the
greatest party ever. Chin up.

868
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,041
- I had the most
incredible night.

869
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,809
- Tell me about it.

870
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:56,645
- I met someone.

871
00:51:56,713 --> 00:52:00,349
<i>- Tell me about him.
- That's the problem.</i>

872
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,952
I can't.
- Well, what does he do?

873
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,987
- Don't know.

874
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:08,390
- What does he look like?
- Couldn't tell ya.

875
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:12,094
- How in the world can you not
know what somebody looks like?

876
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:14,697
- Oh, he was wearing a mask.
- Oh right, yeah.

877
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,799
The costume ball.

878
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:19,068
But you seem to have felt
a strong connection
with this fella.

879
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,105
And you weren't able
to catch his name

880
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:26,509
or a phone number?
- Well, it didn't come up.

881
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:29,745
He offered to get me a drink,
the clock struck twelve,

882
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,314
and then I never saw him again.

883
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:39,922
- Hey, Uncle Rob.
- [Ruby!]
- So how was it?

884
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,991
- The ball? Or her?

885
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:45,127
- You know.
- [She's amazing.]
- What?

886
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:48,230
- SHE'S AMAZING!

887
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:51,800
She's amazing. Thank you,
Ruby, for making me go.

888
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,069
- No problem.

889
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,447
- I can't imagine what going
from being a lawyer to this

890
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,650
is like.
- No. You cannot.

891
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,618
- But we're turning
things back around.

892
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,620
I signed you up for
a continuing education class.

893
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,690
All you need is 25 hours,
unless you've been arrested.

894
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:17,760
- Great.
- You haven't been
arrested, have you?

895
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:20,529
- No. But who says I want
to be a lawyer again?

896
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:22,932
- You can say a lot of bad
things about being an attorney,

897
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:25,501
but it's got to beat working
as a security guard for
twelve bucks an hour.

898
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:28,504
- Debatable.
- Look,

899
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:31,173
here's a list of the classes
you need to go to.

900
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,842
- Not gonna happen.
- Sam--

901
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,178
- Thanks for the attempt,
all right?

902
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,781
- Sam?
- What?

903
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:40,616
- You can do this.

904
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:53,028
(scoffing)

905
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,099
- Maybe we could get some DNA
off of this crown

906
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:00,336
and put it in some
sort of database.
- Ooh, do--

907
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:03,205
Oh, you're kidding.
- A little.

908
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:05,040
Not that I'm not
taking this seriously.

909
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,776
I am. Very seriously.
- Okay, look.

910
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:11,247
I've crossed off the name of all
the people I know and then all
the people I can eliminate.

911
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:14,683
Those are the ones
that are left.

912
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,052
- I think most of these people
work for Carter Higgins.

913
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,088
- Really? Are you sure?

914
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:22,091
- Seems that way. I think
we should call Higgins.

915
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:24,827
- Okay.

916
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,700
- [Higgins and Sons,
good morning.]
- Carter Higgins, please.

917
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,769
It's Elyse Samford.

918
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:40,376
- What did I do?
- Did you talk to Elyse Samford
at the Ball?

919
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,444
- No. Why? Did she say I did?

920
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:45,247
- Does she know what costume
you were wearing?

921
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:47,883
- No, nobody does. You saw me.
I was totally incognito

922
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,253
so I could spy on the staff.
Good idea, huh?

923
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,864
- I'm having a brainstorm.
I'm going to need

924
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:05,601
150% from you on this.
- You got it.

925
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:08,771
- Elyse? Hi,
Emmett Higgins here.

926
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:10,773
I understand
you're looking for me.

927
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,808
A prince costume, yes.

928
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:15,711
Yep, that was me.

929
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,147
Where did I go?

930
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,282
Well, there was
an emergency

931
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,551
back at the office,
my dad needed me.

932
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,754
You know how it is when your
father needs you, you gotta go.

933
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:29,058
I've been meaning
to call you, I just...

934
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,527
I didn't know if you felt
the same way that I did.

935
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,632
Well, so...

936
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,134
when can we get together?

937
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:45,174
Excellent.
It's a date.

938
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:48,711
See ya.

939
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,512
- Hey, Dad,

940
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,048
I think I found him.

941
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,525
- See you tomorrow.

942
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,862
- Uh, yeah. See ya.

943
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,136
(soft music)

944
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,106
- So...

945
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:20,642
we have a lot in common,
don't we? We both work
for our fathers...

946
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,479
- It's great being part of
a family-owned business, huh?

947
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,849
- Mm-hmm. It is.
Oh man, it really is.

948
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:30,786
But it must be great being
handed over the reins.

949
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:34,123
- It's a mixed blessing. I mean,
I would have happily been
willing to wait

950
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,191
if my father hadn't been
ready to retire.

951
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:39,228
- Our dads were great
in their day, but...

952
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:43,132
fresh ideas can really infuse a
business with new life, right?

953
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,834
Survival
of the fittest,

954
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,070
know what I mean?

955
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:51,507
Would you like to start
with some wine?

956
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,509
- Sure.

957
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,944
- I spent my junior
year in France

958
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,880
studying with one of the top
vintners in the world.

959
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,848
I will handle this.

960
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:04,620
- You seem so different
than the other night.

961
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:08,490
- Well, like wine,
I improve with time.

962
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:11,827
Ahem!

963
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:15,364
We'll have a bottle of the
Lafite Rothschild 2000.

964
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,800
- Oh no, no, I...

965
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,768
That's over a thousand
dollars a bottle!

966
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:22,204
- I know. And you...

967
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,740
you're worth every penny.

968
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,543
I feel a real...

969
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,447
connection, don't you?

970
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:34,183
- Did I seem tipsy
to you at the Ball?

971
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,251
- No.

972
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,921
- No?

973
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,757
You sure you were wearing
a prince's costume?

974
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:44,593
- 150%.
- Okay...

975
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:48,230
Sorry, I just... hand cramp.

976
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:01,577
Hey, Dad.

977
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,980
- You're home early.
- Yeah,

978
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:07,082
kind of a letdown, actually.

979
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,952
He wasn't really
what I expected.
- Expectations, huh?

980
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,254
Is this fellow worth
a second chance?

981
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,590
- I don't know.

982
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,359
He was kind of a jerk.

983
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,862
- In that case, you made
the right choice in
cutting him loose.

984
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:23,732
Be patient. As they say,
if it's meant to be,

985
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,968
I'm sure you two
will connect.

986
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:28,237
- Night, Dad.

987
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:41,083
- Had her eating out
of the palm of my hand.

988
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:44,820
- Perfect. Then help me convince
her to sell to Sanford.

989
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:47,723
- Sanford wants
to take over Samford?

990
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,125
Wait, did I say
that right?

991
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,194
- Sounds fantastic, doesn't it?

992
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:55,731
- Well, it doesn't sound
fantastic for Samford.

993
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:59,468
- Maybe not, but it does
for the Higgins. If we can
talk her into this,

994
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,671
well, you know, I'll have
positioned myself

995
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,574
so we can make a fortune.
This goes through,

996
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:09,511
I buy a little island somewhere
and you boys take over
the business.

997
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:14,516
You like that?
- Yeah.

998
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,790
- Ah! Elyse, how are you?
Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

999
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,359
- Did you get a beverage?
Can I get you something?

1000
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:27,663
- Oh no, I'm fine.
- Well, have a seat.

1001
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,866
- So what's going on?
You said it was important.

1002
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:34,136
- Yeah.

1003
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:37,873
An absolutely amazing business
proposal has come in.

1004
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:40,042
- Fantastic. Let's hear it.

1005
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:42,244
- I have to tell you it's
a tremendous piece of news.

1006
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:45,047
Are you ready?
- I'm as ready as I'm gonna be.

1007
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,683
- We have an offer
on the table

1008
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,452
to buy
Samford Candy.

1009
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,956
- Sell Samford?
I'm not interested

1010
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,558
in selling Samford.
- Just hear me out.

1011
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,694
- It's been in my family
for generations.

1012
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:02,197
- There are major advantages
to considering this offer.

1013
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,334
How much time you'll
have for more travel,

1014
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,469
your charitable
activities...

1015
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:11,039
You could remain
on the board of Samford
and continue to have a say

1016
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:14,276
in the matters that
are important to you.
- What's important to me

1017
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:17,045
is growing my family's business.
- Elyse,

1018
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,514
don't dismiss this
out of hand.

1019
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:22,884
This is an extremely
generous offer.

1020
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:26,755
- Really? Who's making it?

1021
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:29,191
- Sanford.

1022
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:32,361
We're talking the kind of money
that would allow you

1023
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:36,098
to devote the rest of your life
to making a real difference.

1024
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:40,035
Promise me you'll think about
it. I'll send you the offer.

1025
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:43,605
Remember, you and Sanford
are the major players
in this industry.

1026
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,707
Together,
you'll be a behemoth.

1027
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:48,543
Unstoppable.

1028
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,848
- Well,

1029
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:55,283
I will consult
with my father about it.

1030
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,819
- Thank you.

1031
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,489
As your advisor
and friend of the family,

1032
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,924
I highly recommend
this deal.

1033
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,594
The economy is shaky,
the future uncertain.

1034
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,764
Samford may never be worth
this much money again.

1035
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,566
- Thank you.
I'll see myself out.

1036
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,707
- Have a good day.

1037
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,220
Send Andrew in.

1038
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:37,092
- Hey.

1039
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:50,906
- Possible buyout of Samford.

1040
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:52,808
Go through it.
- Samford

1041
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,243
is incredibly successful. Why in
the world would they wanna sell?

1042
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:58,747
- You're not being paid
to ask questions. Just
look it over, okay?

1043
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,624
<i> - The question is,</i>

1044
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:13,428
why is Higgins pushing this?
Samford gets bought out,

1045
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,931
he loses his biggest client.
How is that to his advantage?

1046
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,866
- Unless he's representing
Sanford, too.

1047
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,202
- He can't be. That's a blatant
conflict of interest.

1048
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:22,871
- Too obvious.
- Well, the whole thing
sounds shady.

1049
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:24,906
- So what are you
going to do about it?

1050
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:28,510
- I'm going to try to find out
what's really going on.

1051
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,979
- Anything we can do?

1052
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:36,618
- Maybe. Let me get back to you.

1053
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:40,856
Just, uh...

1054
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,958
forgot something.

1055
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:06,615
"Dottsandcrossis".

1056
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,951
Hmm...

1057
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:13,555
"EmmettandAndrew".

1058
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,695
"150%".

1059
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:27,235
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1060
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,772
Gotta find something
to help Elyse.

1061
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:36,978
Come on, show me something.
Samford with an "m".

1062
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:41,683
Nothing.

1063
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,885
(vacuuming sound)

1064
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:11,613
Caught you.
- I just wanted to see
how much I remembered.

1065
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,049
- Come on, Sam, admit it,
this is helping you.

1066
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:16,218
It'll be the only good thing
happening in my life.

1067
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:19,387
- Why? What's wrong?
- My boss is trying
to talk Elyse Samford

1068
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,724
into selling her company and I
know something dirty's going on.

1069
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:25,627
I thought maybe he had a big
position in Samford stock

1070
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,129
and was going to cash in,
but he doesn't.

1071
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:31,967
- Higgins isn't stupid enough to
hold a huge position in his own
name, it's too obvious.

1072
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,971
Plus he's her counsel; it's
a conflict of interest.
- Yeah, I know.

1073
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:38,974
- Unless he's buying
Samford stock

1074
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,076
under somebody else's name.

1075
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,278
Ever hear of a stealth takeover?

1076
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,716
You might wanna check
the stockholders.

1077
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,417
- How--

1078
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:52,621
- Used to specialize
in mergers and acquisitions.

1079
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:56,591
- Of course. Thanks.

1080
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:02,397
Okay, so we need
to identify the names

1081
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:04,699
of the major stockholders
of Samford candy.

1082
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,635
- 30% of
Samford stock

1083
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:09,537
is institutionally owned,
pension funds, things like that.

1084
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,473
It's hard to find
individual names.

1085
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:15,410
I got Joseph Burns,

1086
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:17,212
Alexandra Teller,

1087
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,014
Haro Sinanian,

1088
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,516
RiGlo Holdings....
- Fantastic.

1089
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,653
Are there any more dumplings?
- Now what do we do?

1090
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,222
- Search Higgins with each
of these names.

1091
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:30,358
- That's my girl!

1092
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,630
Anything?

1093
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:37,933
- Nothing. We can't
connect Higgins

1094
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,535
with any of
the shareholders.

1095
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:44,172
- There's a Glogau.

1096
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,475
- What's a Glogau?
- Somebody's name.

1097
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:51,112
It's a picture of Higgins'
graduating class.

1098
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,350
Yep, Rick Glogau.

1099
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:57,686
See, just like the others,
his name doesn't show up
as a shareholder.

1100
01:05:57,753 --> 01:06:01,222
- What's the name
of that company again?
- RiGlo Holdings?

1101
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,425
- RiGlo Holdings! Rick Glogau!

1102
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,126
I found him!

1103
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:12,334
- So maybe Higgins had
his old college buddy

1104
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:14,869
buy a large position for him
and is pushing Elyse
into selling Samford

1105
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:18,006
so the stock goes up
and he makes a killing.

1106
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:22,410
- RiGlo Holdings has been buying
Samford stock for the last
couple of months.

1107
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:29,117
- Great day!
- Not again.

1108
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,820
- Sam, we found somebody

1109
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:34,723
who's been buying big positions
in Samford stock.

1110
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:37,459
- Can you prove Higgins
is behind it?

1111
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:42,097
- You know, you should really
consider a law career.

1112
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:50,038
I need to get more information,
but there isn't a lot of time.

1113
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:52,741
- Pair of shoes.

1114
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:04,719
- What are you doing?
- That's her.
- Who?

1115
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,755
- The candy lady.

1116
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:09,491
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, she's the lady

1117
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:11,493
we were talking to by the candy
machine at Plaza Bowl.

1118
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,628
- She's the one from the ball.

1119
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:17,365
- Ohh!
- Wait.

1120
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:20,068
Wait!
- Hi.

1121
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:24,072
I'm Ruby.
- Yeah, I remember you.
Hi, "Rob not Ray".

1122
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,043
- Hi.
- Do you want to bowl with us?
- You don't have to.

1123
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,578
We don't want to intrude.
- That would be great.

1124
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,614
I just came here to take
my mind off some things.

1125
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,516
- I know what you mean.

1126
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,985
- You want
to play for cash?

1127
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:40,822
A little friendly bet?
(chuckling)
- Don't listen to her.

1128
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,626
We usually just play for pizza.
- Ooh. Anchovy and pineapple?

1129
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:48,329
- Ew.
- I'm just kidding!

1130
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,537
Don't choke now.
- I'm waaaay beyond
reverse psychology.

1131
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,908
See?
- Ohh!

1132
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,212
Okay.

1133
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,853
- Hey, you dropped your wallet!
- Ha, ha, ha!

1134
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:17,826
Boom! Did you think I was gonna
fall for that tired old line?

1135
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:23,331
Go, Ruby!

1136
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,803
- She bowls to the right,
she bowls to the left,

1137
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,872
watch out now 'cause
Ruby's the best!

1138
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:39,581
- (both chanting):
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!

1139
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:48,590
- Maybe I should
find a new sport.
- Are you kidding?

1140
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:50,959
You are absolutely the best
twelve-year-old bowler I know!

1141
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:52,961
- Rob is the best uncle

1142
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,630
in the world. He spends
tons of time with me.

1143
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:57,899
Not many single guys
out there like that, right?

1144
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,136
- Yeah, you guys are lucky
to have each other.

1145
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:04,906
- Yeah, it's great he has me,
but what he really needs
is a girlfriend.

1146
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,942
(chuckling)
- Don't mind her,
she just thinks

1147
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,578
I can't function on my own.
- Well, you guys,

1148
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,515
I've had a great time, but I am
gonna have to hit the road.

1149
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,683
- What about the pizza?

1150
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:17,886
- I'm gonna have to take
a rain check. Rob,

1151
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,755
you know where to find me.
- Hey...

1152
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,228
Is that
a custom Storm?

1153
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:30,832
- Yeah. How did you
know that?

1154
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,034
- A friend of mine had one once.

1155
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,170
- Yeah, but
it's not marked.

1156
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:38,039
- Yeah, well...

1157
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,341
Don't wanna keep ya!

1158
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:43,978
- Okay.

1159
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,953
See you guys.

1160
01:09:57,126 --> 01:10:00,828
- I can't believe you didn't
tell her you were the prince.
- Thanks for keeping my secret.

1161
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:04,632
- Why didn't you tell her
that your boss is trying
to cheat her?

1162
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,534
- I wanted to.

1163
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,870
- Then why didn't you?

1164
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,573
- I can't really prove it.

1165
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,175
Plus I could tell her and
she could not believe me.

1166
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:16,377
Or I could tell her and
start a huge fire storm

1167
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:18,479
and it could turn out she wasn't
going to take the deal, anyway.

1168
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,915
And then I'd get fired
for nothing.

1169
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:24,018
- Don't you always tell me to do
the right thing no matter what?

1170
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:26,621
- It isn't that simple.

1171
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:32,293
You ready for pizza?

1172
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:36,231
- Not hungry.
- Come on, you're always hungry.
- Well, I'm not hungry.

1173
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:38,900
- Come on, Ruby.

1174
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,975
Morning.
- If you want to know

1175
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:50,511
how the class is going,
it's filled with arrogant
young shysters.

1176
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:53,481
- So you're still going?
- For lack of anything
better to do.

1177
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:56,150
- By the way, I paid all your
dues, so all you have to do

1178
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:59,554
is finish the classes and
you can practicing law again.

1179
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:01,556
- You're a good guy,
you know that?

1180
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:04,025
- Not exactly.

1181
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,028
- Rob, I'm telling you
you're a good guy.

1182
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:10,098
Me. Sam. The guy
who hates everybody?

1183
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,303
Hey, Rob.

1184
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:18,673
- Yeah?
- (under his breath): Thanks.

1185
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:21,676
- Did you actually
just say "thanks?"

1186
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:24,779
- I may have. No, no, no,
I don't do the hug.

1187
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:27,248
Hey, hey! Ah!

1188
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:29,450
Okay, we're good. We're good.

1189
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:33,421
- Thanks. Thank you.

1190
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:40,228
- Did you go
through the offer?

1191
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,368
- Why are we pushing her to sell
a hugely successful company?

1192
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,570
I mean, if they sell,
we could lose--

1193
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:52,140
- Did you go through it or not?
- I did.

1194
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:54,842
But Elyse Samford
just took over as CEO.

1195
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,512
If they wanted to sell,
shouldn't they have done it
before her father stepped down?

1196
01:11:57,579 --> 01:12:01,482
- Tick, tick, tick. That's the
sound of you wasting my time.

1197
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:04,118
- I'm just thinking that--
- You're not being paid
to think.

1198
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:07,055
- I'm not being paid
to ask questions, I'm not
being paid to think.

1199
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,057
Then what am I being paid for?

1200
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:12,493
- To cross the t's
and dot the i's.

1201
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:19,167
- Do you even read, or did you
think you'd get a promotion

1202
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:22,303
if it looks like you can?
- I passed the bar my first try.

1203
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,972
Unlike yourself, who still
hold the state record

1204
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,308
for number of times failed.

1205
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:30,411
But I guess when Daddy's
the boss, it doesn't
matter, does it?

1206
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:44,726
- The cloud ate my calendar.
- I'll take a look at it later.

1207
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,295
Do you have
Elyse Samford's number?

1208
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,832
- If it didn't eat
my contacts, I do.

1209
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:14,088
- [Hello?]
- Elyse? It's Rob Carelli.

1210
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:16,557
I've got to come talk to you.
- [Okay.]

1211
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,826
- Right away.

1212
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:29,937
I struggled over whether
to come to you with this,

1213
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:32,573
but I had to tell you
about my suspicions.

1214
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:35,943
- If you're concerned
there's something going on,
I'd like to hear about it.

1215
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,845
Have a seat.

1216
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,418
- It looks to me like Higgins
is buying stock in your company

1217
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:46,788
in someone else's name, betting
on the takeover going through.

1218
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:48,956
- What makes you think
that's the case?

1219
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:50,691
- Why else would he
be pushing this?

1220
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:54,162
- Do you have anything
to prove that allegation?

1221
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:57,298
- One of the major stockholders
is an old college friend
of Carter's.

1222
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,667
He's buying the shares
through a holding company.

1223
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:02,904
- Can you prove the connection
to Higgins?
- No.

1224
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:06,974
- Carter Higgins has been
Samford's legal counsel
for decades.

1225
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:09,510
And I barely know you.

1226
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,313
So tell me why
I should believe you.

1227
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:15,416
- No reason in the world
other than the fact that
I have nothing to gain

1228
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:18,286
by coming to you with this
and everything to lose.

1229
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:21,856
But Higgins, if I'm right,
stands to make a fortune
if you go through with this.

1230
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:24,058
- But I don't know if you're
right. You don't even know

1231
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,661
if you're right.
- I know this is a big leap,

1232
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,763
but if you could just
look into it further.

1233
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:32,233
- You realize if I confront
Carter about this,

1234
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,602
I'm going to have
to cite you as my source.

1235
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,004
Otherwise nothing I say
will seem credible.

1236
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:41,776
- I understand that.
- You'll probably lose your job.
- No probably about it.

1237
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:44,412
- Then why are you doing this?

1238
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,315
Why do you care if my family
business gets bought out?

1239
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:51,953
- I...

1240
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,455
The night of the...

1241
01:14:56,425 --> 01:15:01,629
- Yes?

1242
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:04,932
- I just can't stand around
watching you get swindled.

1243
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:12,273
- Well, thank you
for coming to me.

1244
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,308
I appreciate you
risking your job.

1245
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,344
I'm going to have
to think it over.

1246
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:19,914
(whimsical music)

1247
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:36,764
- I'm glad you told her
about the takeover.
- Thanks.

1248
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:40,334
- I'm proud of you.
Is she going to stop it?

1249
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:43,404
- I don't know. I'm not
sure if she believed me.

1250
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:45,806
- Is there anything else
you can do?

1251
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:49,544
- I'm out of options.
My hands are tied.

1252
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:52,079
- What if you told her
you're the prince?

1253
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:54,815
- It's complicated.

1254
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:57,685
Things don't always go
the way we want them to.

1255
01:15:57,753 --> 01:15:59,754
Life isn't a fairy tale.

1256
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:03,958
Everyone doesn't always
live happily ever after.

1257
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:41,095
- Ruby! Hey, what
are you doing here?

1258
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:44,332
Are you alone?
- We need to talk.

1259
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:47,001
- Okay, come on.

1260
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:50,605
- Ms. Samford.
- Hey, Peter.

1261
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:53,374
Go ahead.

1262
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:04,719
Thank you, Peter.
We won't be long.

1263
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:14,795
- Furthermore,
the plaintiff in the case--

1264
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:20,334
What's going on?

1265
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:22,737
- Carelli was absolutely
not at the Ball.

1266
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:25,072
He was here working all night.
Emmett saw him.

1267
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,041
- My mom made the costume
just for him.

1268
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,210
Rob was the prince at the Ball.

1269
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:32,513
Rob is the one who fell in love
with this lady.
- He did?

1270
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:34,482
- He really did.

1271
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:38,185
- Well, that's ridiculous.
The kid's obviously lying.

1272
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:41,222
My son Emmett wore
that prince's costume.

1273
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:44,825
- You're the one lying.
- Let's just get Rob
and Emmett in here.

1274
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:51,399
Now.

1275
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:59,407
- [Emmett? Get Andrew
and come into my office.]

1276
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:03,878
(knocking)

1277
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:07,481
- Andrew,
Dad's office. Now.

1278
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:09,984
- [Carelli, get into my office.]

1279
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:19,126
- I swear, Dad, I came back from
the Ball and I saw him here.

1280
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:22,129
You were working
all night, right?
- I snuck out

1281
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:25,332
and went to the Ball.
When I overheard your father
telling you to come back here,

1282
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,334
I took off and
just beat you back.

1283
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:30,538
- That's impossible! You'll have
to take his word or ours, Elyse.

1284
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:33,808
There's simply
no proof. No proof!

1285
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:45,653
- Little trick
my grandfather taught me.

1286
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:50,524
- Ew.

1287
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:58,566
- Your favorite bowler
is Kelly Kulick.

1288
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:02,870
You've bowled one perfect game
and you have the softest
lips in the world.

1289
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:09,343
- Hey! You're fired!

1290
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:13,380
- I don't think you're
in the right pay grade
to do that, little brother.

1291
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:15,649
- Dad, fire him!

1292
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,384
- You can assume that
if he was lying to you

1293
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,487
about who the prince at the Ball
was, then he's also lying

1294
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:21,555
about his involvement
in the Sanford buyout.

1295
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:23,657
- That's it! Carelli,
get your things!

1296
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:25,659
- Why did I have
to find out from Rob

1297
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,928
that Sanford was cybersquatting
our domain name?

1298
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:31,098
It seems to me if you were
looking out for my best
interests,

1299
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,134
you would have been aware
of that a long time ago.

1300
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:35,669
Unless of course you didn't
want me to know about it

1301
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:38,506
because you knew Sanford
was planning to try and buy us.

1302
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:41,909
- I'm absolutely appalled at
those accusations, young lady.

1303
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:44,478
- Carter,

1304
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:47,214
I am firing your firm
as counsel to Samford Candy Co.

1305
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:50,484
I will have my new lawyer,
Mr. Carelli,

1306
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:54,522
send over a termination letter
and collect all files today.

1307
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:58,526
- Oh, and Mr. Higgins,
you can expect a call
from the SEC about this.

1308
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:02,630
- Score!
- You do not get to talk
to my father like that!

1309
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:05,466
You'll be sorry!
- Emmett?
- Yeah?

1310
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:09,136
- Shut up.
- Yes, Dad.

1311
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:21,015
- Hi, Rob.
- Hey, Sally.

1312
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:23,717
(knocking)
Sam,

1313
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:26,487
you are looking good.
- Stop.

1314
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:30,224
- How's the new apartment?
- It's more like a closet
but I'll do for starters.

1315
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:32,526
- Alright,

1316
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:34,895
"and associates." Ready to go?

1317
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:37,898
- Absolutely.

1318
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:41,502
Shall we?
- We shall.

1319
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,605
- By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you

1320
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,474
husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

1321
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:02,990
(applause)

1322
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:35,823
- Ha! We got married.
