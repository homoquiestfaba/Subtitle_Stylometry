1
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,978
Nothing's ever going to come of this,

2
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,714
it's a total waste of time.

3
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,784
You never know, that's why Shaw's got us here, right?

4
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,387
Right.

5
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,801
How do you keep working for so long

6
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,403
without a little help?

7
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,772
I do have help.

8
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,040
I do have help.

9
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,076
Oh, you mean like help from above I suppose?

10
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:07,013
Look, never mind. I'm sorry I said anything.

11
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,016
You know I'm tired enough without listening to you preach.

12
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,985
Again.

13
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,720
Ah, Mr. Director, Sir. I'm sorry

14
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,422
I was on my way to see you.

15
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,090
Oh, that's no problem, David,

16
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,092
I was in the neighborhood.

17
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,195
Communications asked me to drop this off.

18
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:33,966
So, what do you have for me?

19
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,103
Oh, we've made an enormous jump, Sir.

20
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,072
I just want you to see this.

21
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,576
Now that's Lieutenant Vasques, our top candidate.

22
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,145
This is her session as of 30 days ago.

23
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,980
This is her performance.

24
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,563
That's incredible.

25
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,733
Oh, but there's more. See, we've been experimenting with

26
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,736
deep meditation. Feeding in subliminal impulses with

27
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:14,173
various radio frequencies, not too much success, but, one

28
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,746
week ago, we stumbled upon something that, uh, well--

29
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,835
Who's seen this?

30
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:53,239
No-one, Sir. I operated the camera myself.

31
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,180
David, you know my feelings. This stuff

32
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:05,918
makes me very nervous. The power of this--

33
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:11,257
Well, Sir, don't you think that it would be

34
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,126
better if we controlled this ourselves?

35
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,029
The cold war is over, David.

36
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,466
I bet you bleed red, white and blue.

37
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:28,674
Do whatever it takes to move forward.

38
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:33,212
Whatever you need, you call me directly.

39
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,783
Thank you, Sir.

40
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,794
Thank you.

41
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:32,298
Yeah, well, we're out here in the middle of nowhere.

42
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:37,737
I have no idea. He wouldn't tell me a thing.

43
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,507
He promised me it would be huge.

44
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,043
You know, son, if the Lord had intended you to smoke,

45
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,845
He wouldn't have created cancer.

46
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,280
He wouldn't have created tobacco, either.

47
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:52,284
Revered Jeremiah Fletcher of "The Guests of God".

48
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,121
You mean you haven't heard of the number one rated radio show

49
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,224
in all of these here United States? The Word of the Lord

50
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,093
from my mouth to your home 7 days a week.

51
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,130
Seven days a week? Even God took a day off.

52
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:08,000
But He didn't have audio tape.

53
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,435
I should have known you'd be here.

54
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,537
Ah, Miss Walsh, always a pleasure.

55
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,372
Can it, Fletch.

56
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,174
What's going on?

57
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,376
I am merely Emmett's Spiritual advisor.

58
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,413
Beyond that, as they say, more shall be revealed.

59
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,816
What about you, GQ?

60
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,218
Jack Jones, Chief Technician.

61
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,422
Hmm. Should have known you were a geek.

62
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,024
Thank you.

63
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,195
So tell me son, have you accepted a higher power into your life?

64
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,596
Kara Walsh.

65
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:38,364
Kara. That's a very beautiful name.

66
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,132
Thank you.

67
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,069
I say, are you a man of decision?

68
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,205
Well sir, yes and no.

69
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:50,443
Cute son, real cute. Let me tell you something. I accepted a

70
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:55,214
higher power into my life when I was a child. My momma died and

71
00:11:55,281 --> 00:12:00,019
left me alone, and I met a great spiritual leader who showed me

72
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:05,324
the way. You see, we are all bestowed with a human potential.

73
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,863
Stephan, why don't we do this now?

74
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,533
All right, on my count. 3, 2--

75
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,271
I'm Kara Walsh and we're here in the Sierra Nevadas, on our way

76
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:56,208
to the Shaw Observatory, the most powerful space station

77
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,246
in the world. We've been invited here by dot com billionaire,

78
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:04,016
Emmett Shaw. The man responsible for donating millions of dollars

79
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:09,155
to Q-E-I, or QEI, The Quest for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

80
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,491
People all over the world have given QEI access to their

81
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,128
personal computer hard drives via the web in order to process

82
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:21,000
data relayed from space. Now, for the first time in history,

83
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,203
space data will be relayed live, directly from the Shaw

84
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:30,176
observatory to your home computer. You'll be able to see it and hear it.

85
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,512
How was that, was that good? Oh look, here he comes.

86
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,921
Yeah, I just got here and there's a news truck here, I

87
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,290
have no idea what it's doing here, Smitty, what's this truck

88
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,659
doing here? Yeah, there's not supposed to be anything here.

89
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,261
No news trucks, no nothing.

90
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,712
.all have the potential to do great things. We all--

91
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,114
Sounds good Reverend.

92
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:23,596
Hey Smitty. Or is it "Princess Smitty" now?

93
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,933
Hi Jack, how you been?

94
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,642
So, you're looking good, as always.

95
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,614
Thanks, so are you. Is that the same shirt you had on last year?

96
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,551
Ah, yes. But the buttons are new.

97
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,425
So is the bunker food not good enough for Shaw?

98
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,195
Come on, why don't I introduce you?

99
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,999
Oh, I know him. I'm his chief technician.

100
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,501
That's great, Jack. Good for you.

101
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,671
I'm kind of surprised you didn't know that.

102
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,707
White chocolate, Padre?

103
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,777
Uh, no. The body is a temple.

104
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,714
Well, we should all consider ourselves fortunate. We're about

105
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,351
to become part of the biggest media event in history, and I

106
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:24,056
can assure each one of you that your being here is no coincidence.

107
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,660
Kara's qualifications as the top investigative reporter in the

108
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,763
country make her the perfect host. Jake here is one of the

109
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:34,133
top technical guys around. Smitty, of course, runs the

110
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,038
whole QEI program, and finally, my friend and spiritual mentor,

111
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,174
Reverend Fletcher. He's here to keep our energies aligned, but

112
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:46,045
he also happens to host a successful little radio program.

113
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,314
Now together with my web sites, we represent the

114
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,218
largest media audience in the country. Last night I received a

115
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,221
call from the observatory. It was a Code One.

116
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,590
Code-- wh-- Why wasn't I notified?

117
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,925
Couldn't risk it.

118
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,427
Besides, I didn't get much. The call was cut off and all

119
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,363
attempts to notify the station have failed. Now that's not

120
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,265
unusual, we've always had trouble with freak storms in

121
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,702
these mountains. Anyway, Jake here is going to get us fixed up once we land--

122
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,137
It's Jack.

123
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,340
Of course, I'm sorry, Jack.

124
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,508
What's a Code One?

125
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:22,481
They picked up what we believe to be an EI signal from space. Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

126
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,983
You're positive about this?

127
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,785
Absolutely, and when we pick it up again, we're going to feed

128
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:30,356
it live via the QEI web site to the entire world. Now this will

129
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,559
be the biggest web cast in history! Can you begin to

130
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,327
understand what this means?

131
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:39,665
That there is a greater power! That perhaps even the hand of God--

132
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:43,669
Of course, of course Reverend, but I was referring to Columbus,

133
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,739
Marco Polo, Neil Armstrong. What motivated them? Was it

134
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:51,343
wealth or fame? No. The real goal was knowledge. My life's

135
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:57,483
work is about to bear fruit. We are standing on a new horizon.

136
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,620
We're about to bring a new knowledge to the world. A gift.

137
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,357
Sorry folks, we're getting some weather coming in, so if we're going, we gotta go.

138
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,562
A moment, Mr. Shaw, with your permission?

139
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,167
Thank you Lord, as you bless this project, may you bring us

140
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,704
closer to your consciousness, to the central messages of the

141
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:24,810
universe, the joy of peace, and the wonder of our own powers, Amen.

142
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,445
Amen.

143
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,181
Kara?

144
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,518
Kara.

145
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,686
Kara, my dear.

146
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,953
Dispatch, here.

147
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,621
Good morning, yes. Can I get a

148
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:46,425
weather update please? I called in earlier.

149
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,832
There's a major storm front moving in.

150
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,001
You should only have a few hours.

151
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,369
I roger that.

152
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:02,774
Weather's changing again. Storm front pushing in. There's

153
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,445
the bunker coming up on the left. I can't land here. It's

154
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,481
too rocky and uneven. I'll have to set down a few miles to

155
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,950
the east. They'll pick you up there.

156
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,759
I wonder what happened to the attendants.

157
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,561
They would have heard us come in,

158
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,396
they should be down here in a few minutes.

159
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,398
Look, I would stick around, but

160
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,467
I gotta get out before the storm hits.

161
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,544
They should have been here by now.

162
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,445
They're probably still in the bunker,

163
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,414
you can't hear anything from in there.

164
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,016
Well I'm not walking.

165
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,285
Suit yourself, Reverend, but if you

166
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,920
don't mind, I'm going to go ahead.

167
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,389
I got this thing about bears.

168
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,762
Are you sure we really need him?

169
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,565
Oh yeah. He's our technical expert.

170
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,868
He's here to make sure the web cast relay works.

171
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:59,024
Tim! Rudy!

172
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,628
This is it? Where's your receiver dish?

173
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,663
It's up on the hill, this is the main building.

174
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,633
Control room, living quarters, it's all underground.

175
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,434
Something's weird.

176
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,738
Come on, geek boy. You worry too much. Let's go.

177
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:18,910
Hey lady-- Smitty, why don't you go around the back,

178
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,746
and I'll check in through there.

179
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,649
Okay. Reverend, do you want to give me a hand?

180
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,696
What happened?

181
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,101
What is wrong with you?

182
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,837
I'm not the one wandering around here in the dark.

183
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,740
Emmett, tell me this isn't going to mess up my show.

184
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,176
Can you fix it?

185
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,678
I don't know.

186
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,114
Well that doesn't sound too promising.

187
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,850
Isn't this is fine kettle of fish. You know this morning I

188
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,520
promised 60 million listeners the biggest show of my career.

189
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,857
What am I supposed to do now, walk on water?

190
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,325
Dagnabit!

191
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,961
Look, there's go to be a phone that works here somewhere.

192
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,432
Dead. Smitty?

193
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,736
Well there's a HAM radio, but it's only for emergencies.

194
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:54,940
Well why don't we just pretend this qualifies?

195
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,757
Any ideas?

196
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,427
Cold meat loaf?

197
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,497
Who would do something like this?

198
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,006
So much for the van.

199
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,577
What is going on here?

200
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,981
Well, Emmett, you got us into this.

201
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,349
Excuse me?

202
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,786
She's right son, this is your pig picking. I have

203
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:44,523
responsibilities, I have followers. How am I supposed to do my show?

204
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,857
Hey Rev?

205
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,359
Hmm?

206
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,694
You could always walk down. The nearest town's only 80 miles.

207
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,429
Well, maybe I will.

208
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:57,135
Yeah, you look fit enough for the job. And don't forget about the bears.

209
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,582
Who's Don Trela?

210
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,183
Never heard of him.

211
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,522
Ready?

212
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,999
Don't worry Emmett, he's an expert.

213
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,336
Hey Rev, I'll take a miracle any time you got one.

214
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:08,874
Okay, so, I found a hamster, but no Tim and Rudy.

215
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,210
All right. You keep working on this. Kara, you come with me,

216
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,246
we'll check around outside.

217
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,393
Well, there's nothing for me to do here.

218
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,697
I believe I'll retire for some prayer and meditation.

219
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:41,640
So, how can I help?

220
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,815
Hey.

221
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,691
So did you make that fortune you always talked about?

222
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,292
Hardly.

223
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:40,231
All those dreams kind of collided with reality.

224
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,334
I'm still slugging it out as a techie.

225
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,369
Chief techie.

226
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:50,108
Chief techie. So, any other men in your life besides Shaw?

227
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,277
What's that supposed to mean?

228
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,180
Well, did he take you to his beach house in Hawaii?

229
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,782
Or the ski lodge in Austria?

230
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,485
Shaw's my boss. Look, if you want to know if I'm seeing

231
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,020
somebody, why don't you just ask.

232
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,922
Why would I want to know that?

233
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,725
This is ridiculous.

234
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:11,796
No, Smitty, I'm sorry. Please-- come back.

235
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,269
Thank you.

236
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,772
So are you seeing anyone?

237
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:26,878
No, I, ever since we-- I've been busy.

238
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,380
The promotion and all.

239
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:34,386
You know I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. You were

240
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:38,790
the only one that believed in me, pushed me to go for it.

241
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,198
So don't you want to know about me?

242
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,102
No.

243
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,041
Okay, all right, who is she?

244
00:27:56,107 --> 00:28:04,082
Well, I've been having this thing with Kara. No,

245
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:09,754
nothing. How could I replace the woman of my dreams?

246
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:21,766
Anyway, I've been so busy creating all these technological miracles.

247
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,270
Now that sounds hopeful.

248
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,206
There's not a soul out there. There's nothing.

249
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,308
So how long till you get the web cast relay up?

250
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,911
Well, the connection to the main dish has been restored.

251
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:36,214
If the signal comes back, we'll get it there, you can listen through the headset.

252
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,317
What's all this?

253
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,419
These are strip chart recordings.

254
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,291
That over there is a strip chart recorder,

255
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,393
it's like a seismograph, it allows you to see the

256
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,329
signal. Jack, why would they burn the disk?

257
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,466
I don't know, but the computers are empty and they destroyed

258
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,501
every single trace of the signal.

259
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,902
Why would somebody do that?

260
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,905
They wouldn't just steal it? Announce it themselves?

261
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,074
I mean this discovery is priceless.

262
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,977
I don't think so. There's something else going on here.

263
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:09,581
You are absolutely right, young man. It all became crystal clear

264
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:14,519
to me as I cleansed my energy in meditation. It is so patently

265
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:22,160
obvious, they were simply overwhelmed. Yes, touched by the Creator, Him or Herself.

266
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,564
No, imagine if you will, these two young men sitting here,

267
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:30,535
in the middle of nowhere, and the external life force, the

268
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:36,975
hand of God, reaches down and touches them, sends them this

269
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:41,412
signal, brings them to a higher level of consciousness--

270
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:44,149
Reverend, come on, this place was destroyed.

271
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:48,553
Now if you know so much about this, then where are the technicians?

272
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,890
Gone to walk the earth. Abandoned their possessions

273
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:56,161
and left to fulfill the great commission. To spread the word

274
00:29:56,227 --> 00:30:00,632
among the people, one by one and soul by soul.

275
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:01,833
That's ridiculous.

276
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,035
You know, your bloated biblical opinion--

277
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,158
Well?

278
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,260
Confirmed! That definitely was a signal.

279
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,995
Praise be.

280
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,942
Jack, look at this printout.

281
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,082
Let me listen!

282
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,518
Excuse me? Give those to me, thank you.

283
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,087
Give those back to me, I was just listening to that.

284
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,059
Who's in charge here?

285
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,172
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. There is a major storm

286
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,975
coming through these mountains. We're totally isolated from the

287
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,910
rest of the world and because this is on Federal--

288
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:22,513
I don't care where it is. This is my observatory and you're not going to tell me--

289
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,549
Look, this is a matter of national security and--

290
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:28,720
You're on private property soldier boy. I'm a civilian, all right. I don't take orders!

291
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:32,557
I am taking charge. I get direct orders from my commanding officer--

292
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:37,228
No you look, Colonel. As of the last election, you, your men and

293
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,998
your commander all report to a close friend of mine. And I'm

294
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,666
sure he'd be thrilled to hear

295
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,135
you tried to kick one of his major contributors off a

296
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:47,639
project in which he has taken a very personal interest.

297
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,173
Sir?

298
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,642
Yes.

299
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:54,145
We've searched the outbuildings. No sign of the technicians.

300
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,581
And sir, the radio, cell phones... everything's dead.

301
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,284
The only thing that works is our headsets. Local only.

302
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,453
Secure the front gate, and keep looking for those two men.

303
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,024
Dismissed. Do you know what happened to those two

304
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,392
technicians who were stationed here?

305
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,526
We don't know.

306
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,029
I'm directing this question to Mr. Shaw!

307
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,134
We don't know. They were gone when we got here.

308
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,369
We don't know. They were gone when we got here.

309
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,205
Fine.

310
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:30,148
Listen up everybody. I am taking charge. Nobody is to leave this building.

311
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,321
Let's go search those rooms, Lieutenant.

312
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,991
Soldier boy, eh.

313
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:33,611
This is ridiculous. We're being held captive here by G.I. Joe. Oh, and G.I. Jane.

314
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:38,116
Ridiculous? No, child, no. Look at the plus side, look at what

315
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:42,387
we have found. I am convinced that we have found the door

316
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,122
to a higher level of consciousness.

317
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,556
Has anyone seen the hamster?

318
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:46,758
The what?

319
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:50,395
The hamster, it's like a little tiny, furry rat.

320
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,471
Not to worry ma'am, I'll get that for you.

321
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,157
Sir?

322
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,558
Oh, thank you Lieutenant.

323
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,794
Your welcome, Sir.

324
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:34,338
Tim Snow-- that's funny, this prescription should have lasted another month.

325
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:45,850
Religions of all kinds have tried to suppress and monopolize our true power.

326
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,587
I believe that there is a universal force that everyone

327
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:55,626
can learn to control. Listening to that signal, I am convinced

328
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:59,831
that we have found the door to a new level, to godhood--

329
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:05,203
How can you say that? How can you tell these people that some

330
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,706
signal from space is going to bring us to godhood? Where

331
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,508
in the bible does it say that?

332
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,477
Smitty, maybe this isn't the best time--

333
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,846
No, Jack. I would really like to know.

334
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:20,751
Oh, come now. You're not telling me that the Bible contains all worldly knowledge?

335
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:25,556
Reverend, I'm not talking about all worldly knowledge, I'm talking about the Bible.

336
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,627
Wait a minute, are you another one of those religious nuts?

337
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,661
No--

338
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,196
But you do believe the same thing.

339
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:36,601
No, that's my point. It's not the same, it's not even close.

340
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,770
There's only one truth and that's not it. He's talking

341
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:43,374
about some signal turning us into gods, and there's no way--

342
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,444
No, let me tell you something. How can you pretend to be so

343
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:51,249
devoutly religious when you work for a company who's sole purpose

344
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:58,256
is to find extraterrestrial life? Isn't that just a little bit hypocritical?

345
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,425
Hey, now, why don't we all just calm down a little?

346
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,827
Hey, now, why don't we all just calm down a little?

347
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,128
Anybody here a computer technician? Hardware, software.

348
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,231
We need to establish an outside communication.

349
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:13,838
Jack Jones. Technician first class, economic status, last class-- at your service, sir.

350
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,774
Well what about you. You're a technician aren't you?

351
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,744
I'm a businessman, not a geek.

352
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,748
I'm the director.

353
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,486
Well, looks like you're our man. Come on.

354
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,690
Don't touch that, Reverend.

355
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:49,941
Come here, come here.

356
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,732
That's not so bad, huh?

357
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,730
How's it going?

358
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:25,803
You want the Reader's Digest condensed version? Slow.

359
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:30,408
That's okay. Step by step.

360
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,710
It takes time to build something of value.

361
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,448
How long have you been in technology?

362
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,884
About 12 years.

363
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,585
You must be pretty good.

364
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:47,158
I show occasional glimpses of brilliance.

365
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:50,728
Chicken?

366
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,030
Thank you, colonel.

367
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,700
You know, I've been in this man's army all my life, damn

368
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:59,770
proud of it. I represent the largest peacekeeping force in

369
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,708
the universe. We're the ones the world calls when the chips are

370
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:07,611
down, and you know why we are what we are, Jack?

371
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:11,582
It's not what we do, it's what we could do.

372
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,652
It's called deterrence, Jack. We don't have to drop a neutron

373
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,723
bomb to gain world peace, as long as everybody knows that we

374
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:22,159
could if we wanted to. That's what this signal stands for.

375
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,563
Nobody in the whole world would dare oppose it.

376
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:29,867
And that's the key to world peace.

377
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:37,074
Now look. I know you work for Shaw, but there's more.

378
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:42,046
I'm just asking you to keep the big picture in mind, okay?

379
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:45,483
Good. You can keep all that chicken.

380
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:32,323
How does Shaw get all the good looking babes?

381
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:38,062
Oh, I don't know. Limos, fine wine, maybe your own observatory.

382
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:42,233
Of course, clothing that matches is always a good start.

383
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:46,136
Although, on you--

384
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:53,110
Oh, lieutenant. I'm Jack, but my friends call me "Jack-ay"

385
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,914
And you are?

386
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:06,857
She takes her job very seriously.

387
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,873
Jack, drink the coffee, don't shower in it.

388
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,830
Hey Jake, were you able to fix the colonel's gear?

389
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:52,703
Look, I'm sure you've heard the colonel's side of it, and don't

390
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:57,708
worry, I knew he'd give you some kind of a rah-rah speech. Look, Jake--

391
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:03,113
Jack. It's Jack. As in Jack be nimble, Jack be quick.

392
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,949
Jack.

393
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,317
Yes.

394
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:12,189
Got it. Jack. He's after one thing. Control of the signal.

395
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:17,194
And I can understand that, hey we're all Americans here, right?

396
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:21,432
Jack, I've put a lot into this, and I'm willing to help my

397
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:25,102
country as much as the next guy, but let's keep an open mind.

398
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:29,440
All I'm asking for is that you let me know. Don't do anything,

399
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:35,245
just let me know first when the relay is almost ready.

400
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:39,850
If you do that for me, there's a special bonus in it for you.

401
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:43,988
A giant, Ferrari-sized, life changing bonus.

402
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:49,326
Yeah, well the problem is, we don't have a signal. I mean, we

403
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,962
have a signal, but it's only in RAM, for some reason

404
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:54,331
I can't download it to the hard drive.

405
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,500
Well, can't we just relay it from RAM?

406
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:01,438
You'd think so, but it won't do anything. We can listen to it--

407
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:04,475
at least you can. My hearing aid can't pick it up. Must be the

408
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:09,046
high frequencies. The problem is, I can't copy it, I can't

409
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:13,083
save it, and even if I wanted to, I couldn't delete it.

410
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,752
What about the backup?

411
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,253
It's blank.

412
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,089
Let me get this straight. The only way we can do the relay is

413
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:26,030
to get that signal transferred from RAM onto a disk and the only disk we had is now blank?

414
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:32,703
Well, keep trying.

415
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,050
Makes it tough, doesn't it?

416
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,019
How's that?

417
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:32,022
When you can't smoke.

418
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:35,926
Oh. There are a lot of things you can't do here, Colonel,

419
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:39,596
and I'm not a girl who's used to restrictions.

420
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:42,399
You can't have freedom without some restrictions.

421
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:54,444
You know, I've always had this thing for a man in uniform.

422
00:46:54,511 --> 00:47:01,151
Oh yeah? What about out of uniform?

423
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:05,689
Well, well, don't tell me "Colonel by-the-book"

424
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:08,425
is actually starting to loosen up a little.

425
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:14,231
Well, the book has many chapters. I'm no different than any other man.

426
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:22,206
Oh, but you are. I mean, you're confident, you're powerful,

427
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:27,711
you've got thousands of men just waiting for your next command.

428
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:38,956
You know, I bet you could have a chopper here in minutes if you really wanted to.

429
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,192
And if I did?

430
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,067
Miss Walsh.

431
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,668
Colonel.

432
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:10,721
Well, I see we're covering all the bases.

433
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,624
That's why they pay me the big bucks.

434
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:22,065
I've pulled up a layout. When they were building this place

435
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:25,335
they had to construct a water runoff - a tunnel. It runs down

436
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:29,706
the mountain here about 300 yards. It can get us past the guards.

437
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,108
And then what?

438
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:35,178
Well, We'd be on our own. It's a long trek, but it's not

439
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:39,383
impossible. If I could get to a road, find a phone, I could

440
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:43,387
pull some strings. Worse comes to worst, we could play back

441
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:46,556
the recorded signal to my website.

442
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:50,060
And how would you do that exactly?

443
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,129
With the diskette you have.

444
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,697
What?

445
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,966
Don't even try.

446
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,038
I get to break the story.

447
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,974
Deal.

448
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:12,182
We could get out through a clean out hatch that's located here in the utility room.

449
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:16,253
What are we waiting for? I've got the disk tucked away

450
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:22,693
for safe keeping. I'll meet you there in ten?

451
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,432
Maybe you should be happy.

452
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:36,299
Why?

453
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,735
That you can't hear the signal.

454
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:43,273
Why should that make me happy? It's all everybody's talking about.

455
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:47,544
How great it makes them feel, how beautiful it is, how alive--

456
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:50,781
Jack, there's something really strange going on. Look at this.

457
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,419
I checked the reports from our sister stations.

458
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,454
Yeah.

459
00:50:57,521 --> 00:51:00,290
If a signal comes in, the coordinates are automatically relayed to confirm the source.

460
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,659
I know, I designed the system.

461
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:07,631
The signal came in last night at 9:00. No coordinates were relayed.

462
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,701
That's impossible.

463
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,670
You're right.

464
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:19,409
Somebody must have blocked or tampered with the coordinates.

465
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,812
You know as well as I do that it's all automatic.

466
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:24,347
No coordinates mean only one thing and

467
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:27,651
that's that this signal did not originate in outer space.

468
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,595
Great.

469
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:15,699
Jack, it's programmed scientific data. It doesn't lie.

470
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,702
Look, I listened to it. There's something not right.

471
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:20,203
What?

472
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:24,708
I-- Look, I don't know. Have you noticed how everyone's changed

473
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,644
since we got here? Everyone's pushier, louder, even Shaw.

474
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:31,348
Did you see him in the Colonel's face. I mean, does that look like the same guy to you?

475
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:36,453
These are all high powered people under a lot of pressure with a lot on the line.

476
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,455
No, Jack. It's more than that.

477
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:19,062
Come on Jack, it's clear. Why won't you just try to understand?

478
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,932
Maybe I need a little bit more evidence than you do.

479
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,567
What else do you want?

480
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:27,938
Proof! Not some paranoid delusion from the back page of the Bible.

481
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,439
What's wrong with you?

482
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:33,977
Everything. Or don't you keep your list anymore? Smoking -

483
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:38,515
wrong. Drinking - wrong. Sex - really, really wrong.

484
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,350
Everything is wrong in your book.

485
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:46,022
Look, I didn't-- Okay, you know what? I'm sorry. Okay, just drop it. I'm sorry.

486
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:50,594
Okay, yeah. We'll just drop it. Let's not argue. Let's all be

487
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:57,033
good little Christians. You know, you're as bad as Fletcher.

488
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,336
Don't you compare me to Fletcher.

489
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,104
Why? What's the difference?

490
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:04,741
Because I believe in God, Jack. Not in becoming God.

491
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:08,878
Look, it's not about meditating on some Universal Life Force or

492
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:12,616
achieving a higher state of consciousness, and it is certainly not about

493
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:16,720
tuning in to some signal from outer space or wherever.

494
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:23,426
What are you saying? That maybe this signal comes from Hell? A demon? Satan!

495
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:26,129
You know, that's pretty much how you get by, isn't it Jack?

496
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:29,099
Sarcasm and half-efforts. I've watched you, Jack. Most of the

497
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:32,435
time you're miles ahead of everyone, and then you just

498
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,038
shift into neutral, cruise control, ride it out.

499
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,107
What's wrong with that?

500
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:40,810
Jack, you want what everyone else has and meanwhile you have

501
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:45,715
everything that you need and you just throw it away. Like us.

502
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:55,325
It wasn't like that at all, Smitty. I was nuts about you. But--

503
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,432
But what?

504
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,071
Jack?

505
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:18,181
I couldn't deal with all the God stuff. I felt like I was in this

506
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:22,786
love triangle and I was the odd man out.

507
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:30,694
Did it ever occur to you that maybe there was enough room in my life for you and God?

508
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:53,783
You're the same. Only now you're in Shaw's limo when you come to preach.

509
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:09,993
What's going on?

510
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,829
She saw something. The Colonel went in there.

511
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:33,550
These guys must have worked together for years. I wonder what happened.

512
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:42,926
I don't know sir. This one's hands are tied. Swinger must have dragged him here.

513
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,894
Give me a hand here.

514
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:50,667
I want that sealed tight.

515
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,001
Yes, sir.

516
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,169
Now just what do you think you were doing there?

517
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:55,238
Yeah, Kara. What were you doing in there?

518
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,140
Zip it up Mister!

519
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:59,042
Search her.

520
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,858
Is this what I think it is? I said, is this what I think it is?

521
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:18,661
Colonel, why don't you ease up a bit?

522
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,831
Come here, come here! Quick!

523
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:25,535
Come on, come on. Listen, listen.

524
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,172
It's coming, listen!

525
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:42,652
What's going on? What happened to the power?

526
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,560
What are you doing?

527
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:53,863
This is wrong! Listen to me. I don't know where that signal is

528
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,399
coming from, but it is not coming from outer space.

529
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:57,901
What?

530
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,137
I checked our sister stations. There's no confirmation reports.

531
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,039
No, look. This is an observatory.

532
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:05,375
It's main function is to get things from outer space.

533
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:06,943
That came from outer space.

534
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,778
Sorry Colonel, you're wrong.

535
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:10,647
Can you check the origin of that signal please?

536
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,048
I checked the signal duration.

537
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:13,750
Smitty, don't.

538
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,652
It's 6.66 seconds.

539
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,421
What? That's what you're worried about? Are you insane?

540
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:22,325
Do you realize what you've done? Do you have any idea how much you've just cost me?

541
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,928
Hey! I think the system's okay.

542
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:28,865
Well, it doesn't matter much now, does it? You're fired.

543
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:34,070
Thank you, Lord, thank you.

544
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,074
What is going on here?

545
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,754
Too late, the computer wasn't up.

546
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:02,365
The signal was way more powerful. It must be getting closer.

547
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,252
You've got to stop it, sir.

548
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:24,821
What happened out there?

549
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:26,823
It came through the headset, sir.

550
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:29,459
What are you talking about? Where are the others?

551
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,461
Dead, sir.

552
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,463
What?

553
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:42,772
They all started shooting each other like they were-- possessed. You can't let it out.

554
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,775
Lieutenant. Lieutenant!

555
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,214
Now look, soldier--

556
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,915
Stay back, sir.

557
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,017
I don't know what happened--

558
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,752
Stay back.

559
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,253
Now that's not how it's going to work.

560
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,654
You're not listening to me, sir!

561
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,991
You're not listening to me. Here's how it's going to go.

562
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,861
You're going to holster that gun. I said secure that weapon or--

563
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:33,823
Lieutenant?

564
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:43,966
Lieutenant!

565
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:26,542
You're supposed to be in charge, Colonel.

566
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:29,479
There was nothing else she could do, and I don't want to hear any more about it.

567
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:31,180
Stop.

568
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:50,199
Lieutenant. How is that possible?

569
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,234
It was the signal.

570
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,702
Will you drop it?

571
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,605
You heard the soldier. It came through the headset. Tell him

572
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:58,508
Lieutenant, you heard it. Colonel, you've opened up

573
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:03,212
something that you can't control and you put all of us at risk doing it.

574
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,349
I think you owe us an explanation, Colonel.

575
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:13,322
Oh boy, here we go. We've seen too much. You have to either trust us or kill us.

576
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:17,226
Who's to say we can't do both? Keep that in mind before letting

577
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:20,963
what I have to tell you out of this room.

578
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:26,469
This program has been operating for years. Experimenting with

579
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:31,641
mind control, exploring options, anything from paranormal to

580
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:38,614
signals from outer space with no success. Now two weeks ago,

581
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:43,920
an Argentina observatory relayed a tiny fragment of a

582
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:48,291
signal to us. Before we could get back to them, the station

583
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:55,264
was destroyed. They suspected terrorists. That signal was like

584
01:03:55,331 --> 01:04:00,636
nothing we'd ever seen or heard before. It couldn't be

585
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:04,273
duplicated, it was unbelievable. We couldn't make it louder or

586
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,708
duplicated, it was unbelievable. We couldn't make it louder or

587
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:10,213
quieter. It couldn't be manipulated at all. It just...

588
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:17,587
was. So we decided to take a chance, test one subject.

589
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:20,690
Subliminal feed with deep meditation.

590
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:23,626
And it worked, didn't it Lieutenant?

591
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,529
So how did you know about this signal?

592
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:29,732
We inserted a virus into the communications system of every

593
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:33,369
observatory in the country, hoping that if the signal came

594
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:40,509
back, our special intelligence unit would pick it up. And yesterday, it paid off.

595
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,678
So you came here, to the source.

596
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,280
But this is so far out of control.

597
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:46,249
Will you drop it?

598
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:47,750
People are dead.

599
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:51,187
I can't change that. This is a matter of national security.

600
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:54,090
No, this is about ego and power.

601
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:57,260
No you are wrong. You are dead wrong! This is about making

602
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,762
the United States the most powerful country on earth.

603
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,230
People are dead.

604
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:04,634
That's the price of power. You can not have power without

605
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:09,372
using it. You think we would have won the war if we hadn't dropped the bomb?

606
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:17,046
No way. Don't be fooled by rhetoric, Miss Smitty. A loaded

607
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:20,683
revolver is no good if it doesn't leave the holster.

608
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,420
There's only one way to achieve peace in this world, and that's

609
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:28,658
to show the world the price of not having peace.

610
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:37,300
Well, I can't speak for anyone else here, Colonel, but I'm

611
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:40,269
telling you right now you can count on my cooperation. I've

612
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:45,608
got to rate world peace a little higher than beaming that signal out on my website.

613
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:49,612
Do whatever you can to help him.

614
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:56,585
Lieutenant, lock this woman in her room.

615
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:57,687
What?

616
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,455
I don't want her destroying the equipment.

617
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:02,258
You lock her up and I'm done.

618
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:11,567
I'll take the responsibility but if anything at all

619
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:16,172
happens to her, you can fix the equipment yourself.

620
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:30,780
Come here, come on...

621
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:35,718
Oh, ow!

622
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:17,393
I've heard of tapeworms, but this--

623
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:26,836
Jack--

624
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:29,405
I can't believe you bought the Colonel's line--

625
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:31,907
Shut up Jack. Think about it.

626
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:35,478
If I said no, we'd all be dead right now. I'm not going to get

627
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:38,881
anyone killed just to turn 50 billion into a hundred. And

628
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:42,218
what, risk everything? My friends, my family? I don't

629
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:45,855
think so. I want you to finish the relay, but just before it's

630
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:49,358
done, you let me know. We'll link in from my laptop and feed

631
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:52,761
the signal back to my office. We could do it from my room. No

632
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:53,896
one will know until it's too late.

633
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,364
And how are you going to control it?

634
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:58,901
Oh come on Jack. Think about it. What happened to those soldiers

635
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:02,371
out there had nothing to do with the signal. It was Vasques.

636
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:05,508
You saw her. She was in that trance. She killed the kid.

637
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:08,878
I've listened to that signal and it is amazing.

638
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:11,680
But we don't know enough to let it loose in the world,

639
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:14,650
and you know as well as I do Jack, I'm the only one with

640
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,786
the technology to quarantine this thing.

641
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:20,523
Looks like I don't have any choice.

642
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:28,731
Those were mine!

643
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:30,966
Hey, hey, hey! What is going on here?

644
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:32,935
What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I pick up

645
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,437
a bag of chips and this lunatic starts hacking at me!

646
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,339
Those were my chips!

647
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:39,842
Hey hold on! We gotta put a bandage on that!

648
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:42,444
The only one who's going to need a Band-Aid is him!

649
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,252
Okay? Now come on.

650
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,424
Keep an eye on that. It's pretty deep.

651
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:59,728
You know, those Bible nuts are all the same. Walking tanks of

652
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:01,630
frustration, just waiting to blow.

653
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,098
They're not all like that.

654
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:07,836
Yeah well that jerk sure is, and that Smitty's no different.

655
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:13,409
Hey, you know, look, this religious stuff,

656
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:17,880
it kind of freaks me out. Do you mind if we just drop it?

657
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:19,915
I didn't bring it up.

658
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,384
Yeah.

659
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,323
You know, it's just that everyone's getting so crazy

660
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:34,730
about this thing, I-- just don't know who I can trust anymore.

661
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:41,704
Wow. Someone somewhere's a very lucky guy.

662
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:47,610
Envy. I like that in a man.

663
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:56,952
Hey I've got it all. Envy, greed, pride, avarice, sloth.

664
01:10:57,019 --> 01:11:03,292
You're a funny guy, Jack. Kind of cute too, if I cleaned you up.

665
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:13,836
You know, you and I, as a team, we could break this story.

666
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:26,081
We could make a lot of money, Jack, and have a lot of fun spending it too-- together.

667
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:37,793
So, what is the story with this, anyway? Accident?

668
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,897
No. I was born with partial hearing.

669
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:46,669
Oh. So what about this one?

670
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:52,508
What? No, I can't hear anything in that one.

671
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:53,575
Nothing?

672
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:54,843
Nothing.

673
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:58,147
You can't hear anything?

674
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:00,616
No.

675
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:03,519
What about now?

676
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:05,487
No.

677
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:07,823
What about now?

678
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,558
No.

679
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,794
And now?

680
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,697
No.

681
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,899
Hey, what's the matter, Jack?

682
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:19,068
Well, it's just, I never--

683
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:21,437
Never thought I'd find you attractive?

684
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,971
That's right, yeah.

685
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:29,878
Oh, Jack. I find you very, very attractive.

686
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,654
I gotta go.

687
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,898
Smitty?

688
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:57,873
Smitty, come on. It wasn't what it looked like.

689
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:02,711
Just forget it, Jack. You don't owe me anything.

690
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:05,214
Are you okay?

691
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,918
You tell me. I wouldn't want to preach to you.

692
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:25,100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for hurting your feelings.

693
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:33,809
Okay, so what are you going to do.

694
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:37,146
Well, I don't think I have much choice. Shaw's the only one with

695
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:40,182
the capacity to contain this thing. You know, I keep

696
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:44,720
thinking, what if the Colonel's right? What if this thing could really bring about world peace?

697
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,523
What if it does just the opposite?

698
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:46,615
They're going to kill us. Tomorrow the Colonel's going to crash our helicopter.

699
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:48,317
That's ridiculous. Where did you get that?

700
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:52,154
Hey, being deaf has some advantages. I can read lips.

701
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:54,823
Okay, now what?

702
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:58,861
I don't know, but you and I, we're the only ones who have not

703
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:03,265
gone completely nuts. Now if we try anything they'll just

704
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,268
shoot us. Make it look like what happened outside. Now the only

705
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,171
thing I can figure is to try and reestablish the internet

706
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:12,808
connection and send off a message to the police.

707
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:15,677
Do you believe in God, Jack? Even a little bit?

708
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:18,280
Smitty? Now is not the time.

709
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:21,750
No, Jack, this is the time. There is more going on here than

710
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:25,153
we can understand. You said it yourself. Everyone has changed

711
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:30,192
but you and I. Why? It's the signal. You can't hear it.

712
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:32,895
But you heard it. Why didn't anything happen to you?

713
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:36,298
I know that you think I'm crazy, but I-- Jack, I believe it's

714
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:41,169
this. Look, Jack. Just try to see, okay? If we can destroy

715
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:47,643
that signal, then it's over. Nobody has anything to hide, no-one else dies.

716
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,878
But what do we do?

717
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:55,417
Together, Jack, we're strong. You need to make a decision.

718
01:15:55,484 --> 01:16:00,188
You either believe or you don't. That signal is evil and I just

719
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:03,325
pray that you will see that somehow. And when-- and if

720
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:09,031
you do, just remember that we can defeat it together.

721
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,803
Why are you telling me this?

722
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:21,743
Because I love you, Jack.

723
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:30,719
Millions of other planets have intelligent life. Life evolving

724
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:38,894
over billions of years. Which means-- Why have they locked

725
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:46,034
me in here? No, which means that some of them could have evolved

726
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:53,075
to pure consciousness, beyond the need of bodies. No longer limited by time and space.

727
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:09,358
And now that they have decided to reveal themselves, they won't

728
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:18,400
make us worship them, oh no-- They will encourage us to

729
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:25,774
recognize, that all of us are gods.

730
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:46,962
There's nothing like a good martini.

731
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:28,236
Hi Jack. Is that it?

732
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:02,804
E-mail has been sent.

733
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:45,213
Dear Lord, I am sorry for whatever part I may have played

734
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:55,023
in this whole mess, but I need you Lord. Please help me.

735
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:58,560
Give me the strength to do what's right and to be

736
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:07,369
there for Jack. I ask this in your name. Amen.

737
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:57,018
Come on, I gotta get that signal back. Come on.

738
01:20:57,085 --> 01:21:01,189
Come on Tim, there's no need to do this. Tim?

739
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:07,529
Look Tim, I'm starting to get dizzy. I'm bleeding pretty good here--

740
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:08,029
Look Tim, I'm starting to get dizzy. I'm bleeding pretty good here--

741
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,497
Shut up...

742
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:09,998
I could use some help. Down deep inside you know it's not right--

743
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:11,433
Shut up...

744
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:14,469
We've been through this Tim, I had to break the relay. It can't

745
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:17,472
go out! We've worked together for years, you know me.

746
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:20,675
Why would I lie to you? That signal's not coming from

747
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:24,579
space, it's coming straight from hell! Tim?

748
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:34,723
Tim? Listen to me! Oh, thank God, Tim. Let me down, all right?

749
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:39,194
Let me down, we can talk about this.

750
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:45,300
Tim, what are you going to do with that? Tim, come back here.

751
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:54,009
Where are you going? Tim, come back. Tim! Tim, come back here.

752
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:57,412
What are you doing? Tim--

753
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:29,377
Don Trela.. Don.. T... Don't-- Don't.

754
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:34,616
You are not cutting me out, no way! This is about God!

755
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:39,421
Hey! I found the security camera video. It shows what happened.

756
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:43,658
Now the message in the closet says "Don't Relay"

757
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:52,000
The signal. Don't you get it? It was a warning not to send the signal.

758
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:01,109
Am I the one with the hearing problem or are you?

759
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:04,546
Whoa, whoa... Hold it right there. We had a deal, Jack.

760
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:09,617
What is your problem? The technicians died trying to send

761
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:14,456
the signal. There is something wrong with it and we are not going to send it out!

762
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:20,462
Jack, Jack, are you ready to be rich? Not some hundred thousand

763
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:26,368
dollar a year working stiff, I'm talking five mill-- The beach, retirement.

764
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:30,839
Jack, son, you've got to connect with my show. It's not about

765
01:23:30,905 --> 01:23:35,143
money, Jack. It's about God. It's about God reaching down--

766
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:39,280
Jack, ten million. Forget this idiot. He's going to lead us to

767
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:43,618
salvation? Look at him. Sliding around in grease and chocolate.

768
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:46,421
Rooting through the refrigerator like a wild pig.

769
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:50,125
They're both lying, Jack. They're just using you.

770
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:55,864
I mean look at them. One just as pathetic as the other. But you

771
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:59,667
and I, Jack, we could do this as a team.

772
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:03,138
Oh shut up, you idiot Barbie. Without me you'd still be the local weather girl.

773
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:05,140
How dare you.

774
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:11,813
Is this the way of the future, Jack? This harlot in designer clothes?

775
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:15,183
Fat hog. What about the masses who've gone hungry while you

776
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:18,386
stuffed your coffers with their donations, huh?

777
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:21,556
Jack, Jack, we've got to send the signal now. If some people

778
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:25,460
die, if some go crazy, so be it. Wealth demands sacrifice.

779
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:27,829
Don't listen to him, Jack. He'll promise you the world and he'll

780
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,532
give you nothing. Don't you think I know that?

781
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:32,567
Shut up you little jezebel!

782
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:34,436
Hey now, come on!

783
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:36,838
There, Jack, now there's the way of sinners!

784
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:19,414
He's not in here.

785
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:21,616
Check the front door.

786
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:24,619
It's locked.

787
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:26,654
The tunnel.

788
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:39,334
You need to make a decision. You either believe or you don't.

789
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:43,872
That signal is evil. I just pray that you will see it somehow,

790
01:25:43,938 --> 01:25:51,312
and when-- and if you do, just remember that we can defeat it together.

791
01:25:56,317 --> 01:26:00,855
I believe in God. I believe.

792
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,968
Jack!

793
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:19,941
Come out, come out wherever you are!

794
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:23,978
Jack! You in there?

795
01:26:24,045 --> 01:26:27,815
You be a good boy now and come out here and the Reverend's

796
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:31,519
going to give you a nice chocolaty treat!

797
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:07,655
Is he in there?

798
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:09,290
He's there, I found him!

799
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:12,460
Well move you fat hog! Let's break it down!

800
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:15,263
Are you stupid? What are you waiting for?

801
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:04,479
Glad you could make it, Jack. So we could start by connecting

802
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:07,081
that signal back to my office. It seems like you've blocked

803
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:09,150
all access to everyone but yourself.

804
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:11,519
No. Smitty was right. We can't send the signal.

805
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:15,590
Well, you know what? I've been thinking about that and you're

806
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:20,128
right. So here's what I want. I want one signal, full power,

807
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:27,435
sent to my lab. After that-- Sorry about that Mr. Shaw.

808
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:31,506
Don't do it, Jack. You know I'm the only one with the resources

809
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:37,578
to contain that signal. What about the money? You'll be rich for life, Jack.

810
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:40,782
Colonel, that signal is getting stronger. It's going to destroy

811
01:28:40,848 --> 01:28:43,418
you. It's going to destroy everyone.

812
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:46,054
Yeah, and what about your plan to kill us all?

813
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,923
Oh, no, no, no. I'd never do that. Why don't you

814
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,759
just take that little piece of code, reconnect it, complete

815
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:58,032
the circuit. We're out of here. Anybody asks any questions, we'll deny it.

816
01:28:58,099 --> 01:29:01,703
The signal's not from space. It kills people and you can't control it.

817
01:29:01,769 --> 01:29:04,505
We can control it, Jack. Have faith.

818
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,608
Let us have the power, Jack.

819
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:10,378
You don't understand it.

820
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:16,050
I've had enough of this. Lieutenant.

821
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,472
Don't make me be the bad guy here, Jack.

822
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:40,041
Oh no, Colonel. You're the good guy.

823
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:43,010
Stop it Colonel!

824
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:47,982
Colonel, while you're busy being the good guy, you might want to

825
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:51,819
fix the relay yourself since I'm not going to be around--

826
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:54,856
Don't kill him Lieutenant.

827
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:03,631
Well, Jack?

828
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:07,902
As much as I like dancing with the Lieutenant here--

829
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:10,004
That's enough!

830
01:30:15,143 --> 01:30:19,847
That's enough Lieutenant. Lieutenant, I need that relay.

831
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:28,856
Lieutenant, I'm ordering you to stand down.

832
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:33,928
Lieutenant!

833
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,564
Lieutenant!

834
01:31:02,156 --> 01:31:03,925
Do it, Jack. Do it right now.

835
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:05,026
No.

836
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:08,763
Do it, or I'll shoot her. You know I will.

837
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:09,964
It's not worth it, Jack--

838
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:11,899
Shhh!

839
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:17,839
Don't, Jack.

840
01:31:17,905 --> 01:31:20,274
Shut up! Move back.

841
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:28,850
Come on Jack. Now here's the address and the code. Log it in right now.

842
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:30,184
Jack I'm begging you--

843
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:31,686
Shut up!

844
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:40,127
You happy now, Colonel?

845
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:41,629
What's this?

846
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,998
Hey, I had to run it through wire hangers and old extension

847
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:45,733
cords. You're lucky it got through at all.

848
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,101
All right. Move away.

849
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,102
Yeah, let her go.

850
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:49,637
Move away.

851
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:50,872
Let her go!

852
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:52,707
Hey!

Connecting...

854
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:00,615
What have you done, Jack?

855
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:05,820
Found the truth. Now we have two minutes until that signal goes through.

856
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:07,889
Connecting...

857
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:10,825
Pray with me, Jack.

858
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:31,045
Don't do it, Colonel. Colonel!

859
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:46,794
Lord, God, please help us.

860
01:32:46,861 --> 01:32:50,031
Connecting...

861
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:53,301
Drive this force back from where it came.

863
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:57,872
In the name of your Son, Jesus--

865
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:01,409
Amen.

866
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:09,810
We did it. He's won.

867
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,140
You have my number.

868
01:34:39,206 --> 01:34:41,475
That's right. Thank you.

869
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:44,845
The Guest of God.

870
01:34:56,624 --> 01:35:03,330
Back there you said there was only one truth. You really believe that?

871
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:05,266
I do.

872
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:08,369
Think I could borrow that?

873
01:35:11,138 --> 01:35:13,007
Yeah.

874
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:15,776
Thanks.

875
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:23,884
So, you still have room in your life?

876
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:27,321
Been saving your place.
