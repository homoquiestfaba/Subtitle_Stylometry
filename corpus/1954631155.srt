1
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:16,142
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:19,278
Mr. Jim Jefferies.

3
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:35,428
Hey.

4
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:37,030
How are you doing?

5
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:40,900
What a-

6
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:44,871
What a nice little start.

7
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:46,606
My name's Jim,
I'm from Australia,

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,909
but I've been living in the UK
for like, the past 7 or 8 years

9
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:52,211
and now I've moved out to
America, it's a big move for me,

10
00:00:52,246 --> 00:00:54,313
but because
I've moved out to America,

11
00:00:54,348 --> 00:00:56,082
I've had to leave a girl I've
been dating

12
00:00:56,116 --> 00:00:57,650
for like, five years
back in London.

13
00:00:57,684 --> 00:00:59,419
It's probably for the best
we're heading

14
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:01,721
in separate directions in our
lives, to come over here

15
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:03,122
and further me comedy career,

16
00:01:03,157 --> 00:01:07,026
and she wanted to stay back in
England and fuck other men.

17
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:08,694
So I-
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING

18
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,763
It, er-

19
00:01:10,798 --> 00:01:11,764
Worked out pretty good.

20
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,069
For her.

21
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:18,438
And me brother.
Oh, yeah.

22
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:23,176
I bet he really get back to...

23
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,112
in, like, a couple of weeks
for the first time in ages.

24
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:27,513
Yeah.

25
00:01:27,548 --> 00:01:30,850
And every time I got back there
I always go see my family doctor

26
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:32,952
'cause this is the doctor
I've had my whole life,

27
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:34,153
I really trust this guy,

28
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:36,722
and my doctor in London is shit,
he's no good.

29
00:01:36,757 --> 00:01:39,092
Last time I was there
I got a physical checkup,

30
00:01:39,126 --> 00:01:41,360
and he's doing my blood
pressure, to go to Australia

31
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:43,963
and he's like, "Jim, your blood
pressure's really high, mate,

32
00:01:43,997 --> 00:01:46,065
you're gonna have to go on
medication, you know. "

33
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,166
"I wanna go on medication"

34
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:48,901
And he went,
"Well, you fucking have to"

35
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,238
'Cause that's how
doctors in Australia talk,

36
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:53,239
and then he goes,

37
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:55,074
"Okay, you two,
go back to London,

38
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:56,742
get your blood pressure
checked again

39
00:01:56,777 --> 00:01:59,445
but if you get the same readout
or higher you're on medication",

40
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,913
so I go back
to me doctor in London,

41
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:02,515
get my blood pressure
checked again,

42
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,617
get exactly the same readout
I got in Australia,

43
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:05,818
and my doctor goes,

44
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:06,819
"Oh, are you good!"

45
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:11,023
And I go, "The doctor in the
strayer said that was too high"

46
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:14,861
And he went "Australians,
with their salads and sport,

47
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:19,499
"Their standards are too high. "

48
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,935
"By British standards
you're good, so...

49
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,571
I'm in an unhealthy Australian,

50
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:27,874
but I'm a healthy
British person.

51
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:29,775
I think if my health
gets worse,

52
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,644
I'm gonna move
to shittier countries

53
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:35,815
until eventually I'm the
healthiest man in Rwanda.

54
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,585
And there's gotta be
some doctor going

55
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,455
"You've only got HIV,
it's not even AIDS yet. "

56
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,430
Stop your bitchin'
and join the soccer team.

57
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:58,104
I'm not afraid of dying if I do
get AIDS or something like that,

58
00:02:58,138 --> 00:03:00,039
I don't give a fuck.
I hate life.

59
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:03,309
I've never enjoyed
one moment on this planet.

60
00:03:03,343 --> 00:03:06,112
I don't wanna live forever,
the only people who wanna-

61
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:09,148
I'm not worried about dying,
because I'm an atheist, right?

62
00:03:09,183 --> 00:03:11,884
Now, acknowledging this is a
Christian country,

63
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,786
and I stand up for your right
to be religious,

64
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,422
but please know
that you're wrong, eh?

65
00:03:17,457 --> 00:03:19,258
Please know-

66
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:22,762
that you're living
in a fantasy land,

67
00:03:22,796 --> 00:03:24,897
and after you die
nothing happens,

68
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:26,065
stop being a fucking child.

69
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,736
I'm not scared of dying
because I'm an atheist,

70
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:32,772
I know I'll just
rot in the ground, right?

71
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:34,840
I won't even know I'm dead,
you all know why?

72
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,075
'Cause I'll be fucking dead.

73
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,381
Religious people worry
because I believe in heaven,

74
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,150
if there's a heaven
there has to be a hell,

75
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:45,618
and everyone
who's read that book

76
00:03:45,652 --> 00:03:48,654
knows that you've done
enough shit to go to hell.

77
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,891
And that makes it very stressful
on your deathbed, doesn't it,

78
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:53,459
knowing what a prick you are,
you go,

79
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:55,161
"Aw, this isn't gonna be good".
Right?

80
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:57,630
I don't wanna go to heaven,

81
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,298
I don't even want
the option of Heaven,

82
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,067
I don't want to exist
in a conscious state

83
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:03,069
for the rest of eternity
constantly thinking,

84
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:04,904
I don't even like thinking
as it is,

85
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:07,240
"Where's me passport?
Can't punch women in the face".

86
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:14,680
The Bible calls heaven
"eternal bliss",

87
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:16,148
I don't get how blissful it is,

88
00:04:16,183 --> 00:04:19,018
it's eternal,
you'll get used to it,

89
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:21,821
and then you'll be
fucking bored.

90
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,757
And what's hell
meant to be like,

91
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,593
fire and brimstone
and eternal agony.

92
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,528
That's what's written
in the Bible.

93
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:30,896
That's God's book.

94
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:32,431
As far as I know,

95
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:35,034
the devil hasn't
brought out a book.

96
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:38,337
We don't know his side
of the argument, right?

97
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:40,740
If you ask me, if the devil
and God are having an argument,

98
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:42,441
the devil's being
a bigger fucking man.

99
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:44,243
'Cause God's just writing shit
about him,

100
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:46,946
and the devil's going,

101
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,514
"I'm not even gonna fucking
comment,

102
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:50,216
son, if you talk about me
like that... "

103
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:00,826
Let's- Let's think about this
rationally.

104
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:03,062
Right? Which isn't a good point
for the Christians,

105
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:04,063
rational thought.

106
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:07,700
Fire and brimstone
and eternal agony,

107
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:10,269
that's what hell's meant to be,
that's written in the Bible.

108
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:13,105
Now, God runs
the entire universe

109
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,840
except for one place
which is run by hell

110
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,876
and the devil,

111
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,211
and now, the devil
is his biggest enemy

112
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:21,113
and they don't get along
whatsoever, right?

113
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:23,716
Now, if you act bad
you go to hell, right?

114
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,851
Now, you've lied,
you've cheated, you've stolen,

115
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:28,187
you've been a prick
your entire life.

116
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:30,356
Why would the devil punish you?

117
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:32,758
You're one of his boys.

118
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:37,663
He's gotta fucking dig you.

119
00:05:37,698 --> 00:05:40,066
That's where all the hookers
and drugs are gonna be,

120
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,435
I don't think they're gonna
make their way into heaven.

121
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:44,437
I don't think God's gonna
open the gate and go,

122
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:45,971
"Jimmy, you've been
such a good guy,

123
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:48,374
see this big-titted whore
with the line of coke on her?"

124
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,510
"Knock yourself out, son. "

125
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,284
What's meant to happen
when you die and go to heaven,

126
00:05:58,318 --> 00:05:59,885
you see a big bright light,

127
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,554
you walk towards the light.

128
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:03,923
What's at the end of the light?

129
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:05,524
All your dead relatives.

130
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:09,562
Well, whoop-dee-fuckin-doo.

131
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:13,466
You ever spent a weekend
at your grandparents' house?

132
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,134
It's fucking shit.

133
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,604
If you're out there for an hour
you'll go,

134
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:20,306
"I wish that all me friends
would die. "

135
00:06:22,075 --> 00:06:23,709
You'll be out there meeting
everybody,

136
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:26,278
"Hi, Aunt Neda.
How are you, Granddad?"

137
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:29,348
"Hello, Uncle
You-used-to-touch-me".

138
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,320
"How did you get up here?"

139
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:40,393
"Oh, that's right, you used to
work for the Church. "

140
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,202
Jeez.

141
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:53,038
You hear that little groan
when I said that,

142
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:54,340
"You work for the Church"?

143
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:56,409
It's because religious people
are in the crowd,

144
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:58,377
and they don't like
hearing facts.

145
00:06:59,913 --> 00:07:01,981
That's a fact,
there's been pedophiles

146
00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:04,116
<i>in the Catholic Church,
it's been on 60 Minutes,</i>

147
00:07:04,151 --> 00:07:05,117
fucking fact.

148
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:07,420
But all they're saying is like,

149
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:09,188
"Ohh, no, no".

150
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:12,158
Because religious people
will forgive God

151
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:15,861
for fucking anything.

152
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:17,329
In their mind
he does good things,

153
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:19,765
rainbows, children's laughter,
shit like that, right?

154
00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:24,637
When he does bad things
like hurricanes, AIDS,

155
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,606
cancer, child molestation,
then they just go,

156
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:31,310
"Oh, well. God works
in mysterious ways. "

157
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,948
What sort of an excuse is that?
What- What is-

158
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:37,249
What is mysterious

159
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:40,453
about acting
like a fucking asshole?

160
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:43,322
That is like,
the least mysterious activity

161
00:07:43,356 --> 00:07:45,157
since the dawn of time.

162
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:47,359
If- If I ever date
a religious girl

163
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:49,662
she's gonna come home and
I'm gonna be raping her mom.

164
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:51,197
Right?

165
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:53,499
And she's gonna look at me
and go, "What are you doing?"

166
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:56,001
And I'm gonna go,
"I'm mysterious. "

167
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:59,238
"I've always been mysterious. "

168
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:08,147
See, religious people
are just fucking stupid.

169
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:10,249
There's how the world was
created which everyone,

170
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:12,818
scientists and rational-thinking
people believe,

171
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:15,387
and that's the big bang theory,
and then evolution kicked in

172
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:17,590
and there's little
microorganisms, then a tadpole,

173
00:08:17,624 --> 00:08:19,592
that tadpole learned how to walk
or something,

174
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:21,494
and then there were
some animals in between,

175
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:24,930
and then fucking monkeys,
and then us.

176
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:26,365
And that's science.

177
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,970
Then there's how religious
people believe we was created

178
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:32,371
and that's Creationism.

179
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:35,975
They believe that God put
two white people in the jungle

180
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:39,578
without sunscreen,
and they fucked,

181
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:41,247
and there we go, people.

182
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:43,716
There we go, black people,
Arab people, oriental people,

183
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,286
and for the amount of inbreeding
very few retards.

184
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:52,691
It seems so plausible!

185
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:59,498
See, the fact is that
there's evolution in the Bible.

186
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,800
Right? Jesus was 4'7".

187
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:03,168
Four foot seven.

188
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:05,571
He was a normal-sized guy,
everyone was short back then.

189
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,439
We're all taller now
because of evolution.

190
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:10,109
That's how Jesus could
feed the people with two fish,

191
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,144
little fucking people,
big fucking fish.

192
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:17,349
So this is Jesus here, right?

193
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:20,085
He's a little tiny Arab Jew.

194
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:23,789
He looks like Super Mario.

195
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:30,429
Now,

196
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:32,131
if Jesus is this big,

197
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:36,168
that means his cross was maybe,
maybe that big.

198
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:41,040
Now, I'm not saying
I'm better than Jesus.

199
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:44,043
But if I was
on that little cross

200
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:46,245
my feet would be on the ground
and I'd fucking live.

201
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:52,117
So what killed Jesus could not
kill me, I'm way more powerful.

202
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:54,587
Not only would I leave,

203
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:56,388
but I would lift the cross
out of the ground

204
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:58,757
and beat up all the little
Roman bastards.

205
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:00,793
And History would be
very different.

206
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,099
Thousands of years before Jesus
there was a guy called Noah.

207
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:09,335
And Noah built a boat

208
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:12,538
and Noah lived to be
950 years old.

209
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:14,206
But I'd never mention that
in sermons,

210
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,375
'cause we might think
its bullshit.

211
00:10:18,345 --> 00:10:21,714
And Noah was thousands of years
before Jesus

212
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:23,716
so Noah was about this big.

213
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:28,954
There's little Noah
with his long hair

214
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:31,090
and his gray big beard.

215
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:34,126
He looks like
a glorified chess piece.

216
00:10:38,565 --> 00:10:40,499
And he built a boat,

217
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:43,202
and they put all the animals
in the boat.

218
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:46,338
And we had two of each animal,

219
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:47,906
and he lived in, like,
Afghanistan,

220
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,942
back when it was
a god-loving place.

221
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:52,745
And all the animals came

222
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,546
and they all
swam there and shit,

223
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:55,914
they all mated there like a
week.

224
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:58,784
All the kangaroos and all that
type of stuff.

225
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:01,720
Then he worked out some type of
refrigeration system

226
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:05,190
to keep the polar bears cold
and the lions hot,

227
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:08,627
and he made the door
on the ark very small

228
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:12,331
so the dinosaurs couldn't get in
'cause he was a thinker.

229
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:19,171
Then he had storage areas
for all their delicate diets

230
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:23,208
'cause we all know what picky,
fucking eaters pandas are.

231
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:27,046
Aren't pandas a bunch of cunts.

232
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:34,887
I'm done with pandas.
I'll tell you why,

233
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:38,791
every fucking living creature
loves pandas.

234
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,894
The panda doesn't have
a natural predator on the planet

235
00:11:41,928 --> 00:11:44,229
and they're dying out
because they're fucking dicks.

236
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:48,634
Fuck'em. Let'em die out.

237
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:51,270
The pandas don't fuck each
other, they don't have babies,

238
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:52,971
therefore we've got
no fucking pandas,

239
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:55,641
they're dead, why,
let's lose the fucking pandas.

240
00:11:57,243 --> 00:12:00,479
We've tried.
We have fucking tried.

241
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:03,882
We at the Human Rights
put pandas in cages together,

242
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,851
and try to help them fuck.

243
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:07,820
We go,
"there's a panda. "

244
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:10,155
"Go fuck the panda. "

245
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:14,693
And they just look
at each other.

246
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:17,196
You put me in a cage
with anything,

247
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:24,103
anything,
and after a week I'll fuck it.

248
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,315
You'd think pandas
know the Chinese

249
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:39,351
and they're taking the one-child
policy too serious.

250
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:47,459
Now,

251
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:50,362
that's all I'm gonna say
about Christianity.

252
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:53,232
To be honest with you, it's just
a glorified panda joke.

253
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:57,903
It's how comedy works, right?

254
00:12:57,937 --> 00:12:59,905
You start with a funny bit,
you work backwards,

255
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:03,876
so I start panda, and I go
all the way back to small Jesus,

256
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,210
very logical.

257
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:08,213
But I know I'm in America,

258
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:12,084
and all you people love God,
and all that, eh?

259
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:15,387
So let's pick out a few more
religions and make it fair.

260
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:16,855
All right?

261
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,092
Jews.

262
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:24,830
What's all that about?

263
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:31,570
What's with the curly sideburns?

264
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:32,805
Where in the Bible does it say,

265
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,841
"If thou loves me,
thou shall look lie a dick?"

266
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:43,115
Next religion.

267
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:48,854
Isn't Buddha a fat bastard?

268
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:51,190
That's all I've got on Buddha.

269
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,359
One more.

270
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:55,694
Muslims.

271
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:58,363
Can you feel that?

272
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,366
Can you fucking feel that?

273
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:04,970
One word,
one fucking word,

274
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:07,506
and all your assholes
shrunk up and went...

275
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:13,145
Oh, make it good, Australia,
man. Don't fuck this up.

276
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:17,149
'Cause you think when I say
Muslims I'm about to be racist,

277
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:18,717
don't ya?

278
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:21,153
I'm not racist, I'm a bigot.
It's completely different.

279
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:24,122
And being Muslim isn't a race.

280
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:25,624
I'm not talking about
Arab people,

281
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:27,192
I have no problems
with Arab people,

282
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:30,195
I like to eat food
late at night.

283
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:36,068
I'm talking about Muslims.

284
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:38,036
I'm not talking about
terrorists,

285
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:40,339
every comic who has a Muslim
joke does a terrorist joke.

286
00:14:40,373 --> 00:14:42,474
Obviously most of them
aren't terrorists,

287
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:46,111
I'm talking about the things
that we know, and shit,

288
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:48,847
the fact that women have very
few rights in their culture.

289
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,549
Now, it sounds good in theory,
but-

290
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:56,855
In our society
it should be frowned upon.

291
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,957
I don't think I could be
a Muslim

292
00:14:58,992 --> 00:15:01,593
because they can't eat bacon
or drink beer.

293
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:06,031
And they're the two greatest
fucking things in the world.

294
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:15,240
You take bacon and beer
away from me

295
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:17,442
and I'll fly a plane
into a fucking building.

296
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,051
I love drinking.
I hate people who don't drink.

297
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:29,588
Never met an interesting person
in my life who didn't drink.

298
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:31,490
If you don't drink
you're a boring cunt

299
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:33,358
and all your story sucks.

300
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:43,735
All your stories
end the same way with

301
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,404
"And then I got home. "

302
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,109
No one gives a shit that you've
been promoted at work,

303
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:54,279
and no one gives a fuck that
your kids don't have bruises.

304
00:15:54,314 --> 00:15:57,082
No one gives a shit that you've
been p work,

305
00:15:59,852 --> 00:16:02,087
Ever asked a non-drinker
why they don't drink?

306
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:04,756
Same fucking answer every time,
you go, "Why don't you drink?"

307
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,659
They go, "I don't like
the taste of it. "

308
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:09,161
Nobody does!

309
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:12,264
No one likes the taste of it,

310
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:14,733
we drink 'cause we
fucking have to.

311
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:17,769
No one's ever had
a shot of tequila and gone,

312
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:19,271
"Oooh, that's lovely!"

313
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,674
"Next time I'll have that
instead of pudding.

314
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:24,276
It's so moist. "

315
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:33,318
We drink 'cause life's shit.

316
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:34,753
And you gotta do
whatever you can

317
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:36,922
to get through the fucking day.

318
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:39,091
Now...

319
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:49,768
I- I honestly didn't mean
to time it like that.

320
00:16:51,838 --> 00:16:54,673
That's like a magic trick,
ain't it?

321
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:57,175
Pass it on.

322
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,177
I've decided I'm gonna
punch people in the head

323
00:16:59,212 --> 00:17:01,680
if they say the next sentence.
I encourage you to do the same

324
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:03,548
because they think they're
better than you.

325
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,751
Anyone who says the sentence:
"I don't need to drink

326
00:17:05,785 --> 00:17:08,820
or take drugs
to have a good time,

327
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:11,323
I'm high on life. "

328
00:17:11,357 --> 00:17:15,360
Punch that cunt in the head
till your hand breaks.

329
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:18,930
Just...

330
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:20,065
Really...

331
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:26,171
Well, I'm, angry on alcohol.

332
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:27,172
Now drive me home.

333
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:40,118
Smoking's a weird one, man.
Smoking's like...

334
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:43,922
I appreciate with smoking that
you can't smoke indoors anymore.

335
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:45,090
I think that's the right law.

336
00:17:45,124 --> 00:17:46,591
I think if people
are working there

337
00:17:46,626 --> 00:17:48,026
you can't smoke
in front of them,

338
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:49,261
I think it's fair enough.

339
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:51,430
And it's the same law
all across the world.

340
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:54,099
But in Australia now,

341
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:56,201
prostitution is legal.

342
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:58,537
But you can't smoke
in front of a hooker.

343
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:03,742
'Cause this might be
detrimental to her health.

344
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:05,811
Is this really the worst thing
that's happening

345
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:09,314
to this woman's body
on a day-to-day basis?

346
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:12,350
If you pay her enough money
you can bone her.

347
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:18,790
I'm not saying pour petrol
on her and light her up,

348
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:19,858
I'm saying,

349
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,960
heat up a bit of metal,
leave a good mark,

350
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:23,962
let people know you were there.

351
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,136
Now, while I'm on the subject
of burn victims,

352
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:36,575
I wouldn't wish it
upon my worst enemy,

353
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:38,276
it's an awful thing
to happen to anyone,

354
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:41,580
but I do laugh whenever
there's like, a house fire

355
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:43,582
or a car accident,
or something like that,

356
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,650
and someone gets
really badly burned,

357
00:18:45,685 --> 00:18:47,419
and the news read'll be like,

358
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:50,689
"They're alive,
but they have been burned

359
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:53,725
beyond recognition. "

360
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,228
"Burned beyond recognition. "

361
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,463
You ever seen a burn victim?

362
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:00,765
Most recognizable person
in a room.

363
00:19:04,537 --> 00:19:06,505
The term should be,
"Burned to recognition. "

364
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:12,944
This is my mate Steve, no one
used to notice him at parties.

365
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,916
Since the accident,
you go,

366
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,786
he's gone from plain
to extra crispy.

367
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:29,928
But back to smoking.

368
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,064
Why do we still have
no-smoking signs out?

369
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:34,166
That makes no sense,

370
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,934
we used to have to have
no-smoking signs.

371
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:39,104
We used to have to know where
we could or could not smoke.

372
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:41,973
Now, we can't fucking smoke
anywhere,

373
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:44,309
so why the signs?

374
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:46,578
It's the law.
I understand the law.

375
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:48,480
We don't have signs
for every other law

376
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:51,616
to remind us all the time.
We're meant to understand this.

377
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:54,686
Right? So every place you
walk in has a no-smoking sign

378
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,923
but it also should have above
it, "And don't touch kids. "

379
00:19:57,957 --> 00:20:00,458
Because,

380
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:02,494
I feel like
that's the worst crime.

381
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:06,431
You'll see me in the court
of a nightclub

382
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:09,100
fisting a small animal, going
"That don't have a sign. "

383
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:12,871
"I think I can do this. "

384
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,411
Obviously that wouldn't happen,

385
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:22,914
'cause I don't go to nightclubs.

386
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:30,889
My nightclub days are over,
I'm 32, I'm a pub guy,

387
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:32,891
that's it.
Pub and comedy club,

388
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:34,626
that's all I do.
I don't go to nightclubs

389
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,194
because I'm a fucking adult.

390
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:39,130
And if you're over 25
and you still go to nightclubs,

391
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:40,465
you're a dick.

392
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:44,669
You're a dick,
and you look like a loser,

393
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:46,705
and if you drive around a car
that goes, pff, pff,

394
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:48,473
you're a fucking dick.

395
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:53,812
If you've ever wanted to be a DJ
that mixes songs- dick.

396
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,585
Nightclubs treat you
like you're a child.

397
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,153
I hate being told
I'm not good enough

398
00:21:02,188 --> 00:21:04,823
to get into a building
by some guy.

399
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:08,326
I hate going to the toilet and
not be able to wash my own hands

400
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:09,527
because I have a man there

401
00:21:09,562 --> 00:21:12,130
that I'm meant to tip
a couple of dollars.

402
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:14,432
Like, and he's there with a bit
of stuff and a hand towel,

403
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:16,968
and I'm like,
"Can you fuck off, mate?"

404
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:20,338
I've washed my hands before.

405
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:23,208
I'm very good at it,
it's one of my skills.

406
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:26,745
I'm not the most hygienic man
in the world,

407
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:29,781
I was just sniffing coke
off a toilet seat.

408
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:32,117
Do you really think
the cleanliness of my hands

409
00:21:32,151 --> 00:21:35,587
is of a paramount concern
at the present moment?

410
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:37,889
You ever walked out of there
and not washed your hands?

411
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:40,425
He looks at you
like you're scum.

412
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:41,559
I'm scum?

413
00:21:41,594 --> 00:21:44,429
You work in a
fucking toilet, man.

414
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:49,934
I don't even wash my hands,
fuck washing my hands.

415
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:53,638
I do so many filthy things,
that's fucking-

416
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:55,507
People get obsessed with germs.

417
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,776
Every time I have a one-night
stand, afterwards I go,

418
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,078
"Can I use your toothbrush?"
And she'll just be like:

419
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:06,718
You've just sucked my cock,
give me your fucking toothbrush.

420
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:21,599
I'm gonna tell you some stories
about my family.

421
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:23,301
We'll start with my dad,
all right?

422
00:22:23,336 --> 00:22:25,303
My dad's a cool guy,
he's a bit of a dick,

423
00:22:25,338 --> 00:22:28,306
he's like all dads,
he thinks he's funny,

424
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:30,241
and he's funny
for other reasons.

425
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:32,010
Anyway, so me
and my older brother Scott,

426
00:22:32,044 --> 00:22:34,479
Scott was about nine years old,
I was about five years old,

427
00:22:34,513 --> 00:22:36,848
we're in the garage,
and we're loading up the car

428
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:38,917
to take things
down to the junkyard,

429
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:40,318
the tip, the dump,
whatever.

430
00:22:40,353 --> 00:22:42,520
So we're going through
these old boxes in the garage

431
00:22:42,555 --> 00:22:45,757
and my brother pulls
a vibrator out of the box,

432
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,425
just like this:

433
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,030
And my dad does that

434
00:22:52,064 --> 00:22:53,998
he's-concerned-
but-he-doesn't-want-us-

435
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:57,202
to-know-
that-he's-concerned run.

436
00:22:57,236 --> 00:22:59,371
"Hey, what you got there?"

437
00:23:03,242 --> 00:23:05,777
And then he takes the vibrator,
and me and my brother,

438
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:08,279
we know that run,
we know what's happened.

439
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:10,315
This is something good. Eh?

440
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:13,585
We're fucking transfixed,
"What is that, dad,

441
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:14,586
what, what, what?"

442
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,221
"What is that?"

443
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:18,123
And dad turns around
with the full knowledge

444
00:23:18,157 --> 00:23:19,724
that we have no idea,
and he's like,

445
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,695
"What, uh... What...
This, this is a...

446
00:23:23,729 --> 00:23:26,331
Women... Women, uh...

447
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:28,066
Women use this to mas-

448
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,567
It's a massager. "

449
00:23:31,937 --> 00:23:33,738
And then my dad turns it on
and goes,

450
00:23:33,773 --> 00:23:36,408
"Whoa, I'm having a great time. "

451
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,312
He turns it off,
he puts it back in the box,

452
00:23:41,347 --> 00:23:43,481
he puts the box back
on the top shelf, and he goes,

453
00:23:43,516 --> 00:23:45,850
"Now, we're not to look at that
anymore. "

454
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:49,454
A week later, me and my brother,
it's like,

455
00:23:49,488 --> 00:23:51,890
the middle of summer in Sydney,
it's blistering heat,

456
00:23:51,924 --> 00:23:53,825
we're just rocking around
in our underwear,

457
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:55,360
as kids do, you know.

458
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:58,029
My brother Scott walks out
to me, and Scott, he goes,

459
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,532
"Jim. Garage. "

460
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:03,201
We go out to the garage,

461
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:05,270
he gets up on all these boxes,

462
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:07,739
he pulls the vibrator out
from the top shelf,

463
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:09,274
and he looks at me and goes,

464
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:11,443
"Now, you massage me,

465
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:16,047
then I'll massage you.

466
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,816
I go first. "

467
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,751
Now, anyone who knows
an older brother,

468
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:22,487
or has an older brother,
knows this is a fucking trick.

469
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:24,322
You're never gonna get a go.

470
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:28,159
Older brothers always go first.

471
00:24:28,194 --> 00:24:29,527
You never go first.

472
00:24:29,562 --> 00:24:32,363
You push him on the swing
for six fucking minutes

473
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:33,998
and then they fuck off.

474
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,104
So I turn the vibrator on,
"I'm gonna get a go",

475
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:41,806
"Yeah, you're gonna get
a fucking go",

476
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:42,874
"All right", "Okay. "

477
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:44,742
I start working
me brother's back, just,

478
00:24:49,515 --> 00:24:51,049
And my brother gives it these
ones-

479
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,050
Ohh.

480
00:24:56,889 --> 00:24:58,356
Then it's my turn, right?

481
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,093
I stand in front, my brother
turns the vibrator on,

482
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,630
he drops it on the ground,
he fucks off.

483
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:07,699
Now, I'm five years old,
what do I do?

484
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:10,502
Five-years-old, you cry.
Right?

485
00:25:10,536 --> 00:25:13,938
So I'm sitting
in the dark of the garage,

486
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:15,273
in me underwear,

487
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,009
crying,

488
00:25:18,043 --> 00:25:20,378
there's a fucking vibrator
kicking off on the ground,

489
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:27,485
I pick up the vibrator
and start working me back.

490
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:33,424
And then my dad walks in.

491
00:25:35,027 --> 00:25:39,430
To find his five-year-old son
in the garage, in his underwear,

492
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:41,633
rubbing a vibrator
all over his back.

493
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:43,801
crying.

494
00:25:46,472 --> 00:25:48,306
And my dad walks up
and he looks me in the eye,

495
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,975
and this is when he says,
he goes,

496
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,511
"Has Scotty fucked you over
again?"

497
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,885
Then my dad takes the vibrator
off me and looks at me and goes,

498
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,855
"Now, you're not to play
with this, all right?

499
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:06,824
You're not to play with this.
This is Dad's. "

500
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,693
Now, that sentence
has haunted me.

501
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:16,267
This is tense.

502
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:17,402
That raises more questions

503
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:18,937
than I ever fucking need
answered.

504
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:23,207
He retired from work,
my old man,

505
00:26:23,242 --> 00:26:24,542
a couple of years ago.

506
00:26:24,577 --> 00:26:26,444
And as a retirement gift
I paid for him

507
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:27,912
to come out to Britain
to visit me,

508
00:26:27,947 --> 00:26:29,781
then paid for me and him
to go out to Germany

509
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:31,583
to see every match
that Australia played

510
00:26:31,617 --> 00:26:32,584
in the Soccer World Cup.

511
00:26:32,618 --> 00:26:34,752
It literally cost me
10,000 pounds,

512
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:36,988
which is like
200,000 American dollars.

513
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:40,625
And, uh-

514
00:26:43,262 --> 00:26:46,097
So, we're going out, we're gonna
see Australia vs. Brazil,

515
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:48,700
now, this is the biggest game
in Australia's soccer history,

516
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:52,270
that's in Munich, it's a great
fucking soccer country, Germany,

517
00:26:52,304 --> 00:26:53,571
he's loving it, right?

518
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:55,473
The stadium's about 20 miles
out of the city,

519
00:26:55,507 --> 00:26:57,875
it was like 34 degrees Celsius,
which is, I don't know,

520
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,111
300 Fahrenheit, or something.

521
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:04,716
And they piled us onto these
un-air-conditioned trains

522
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,817
like fucking sardines,

523
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:07,752
I've never felt
so crammed up in my life,

524
00:27:07,786 --> 00:27:10,288
like, so uncomfortable,
I'd never felt so uncomfortable

525
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:11,789
in my entire life.

526
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:14,392
While we were in the train
there's Brazilian fans chanting,

527
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,793
ya-da-da-da-da.

528
00:27:15,828 --> 00:27:18,096
On the other end of the train
there's Australian fans

529
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,632
trying to chant back, but it's
really like our first World Cup

530
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,066
so it's just like one bloke
going,

531
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:23,134
Ronaldo's got big teeth.

532
00:27:28,641 --> 00:27:31,976
And the singing dies down
for just a second, right?

533
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:34,112
Enough time for my dad
to go,

534
00:27:34,146 --> 00:27:37,015
"This is how they used
to transport the Jews. "

535
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:46,124
There are very few sentences
on this planet

536
00:27:46,158 --> 00:27:49,327
that can make any train
of soccer hooligans go,

537
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:51,663
"Fucking Jesus, mate. "

538
00:27:52,698 --> 00:27:55,500
"That's a bit uncalled-for. "

539
00:27:56,869 --> 00:27:59,837
Well, my dad thought maybe they
didn't hear him, right?

540
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:04,108
So he said it again
slightly louder.

541
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:07,145
"But some of them didn't make it
to the camps, you know. "

542
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,851
We get off the train,
I'm fucking mortified,

543
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:16,621
I have never been so embarrassed
in my life,

544
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,022
and I'm with my dad,
I'm going,

545
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:20,625
"Are you fucking kidding me,
what is fucking wrong with you",

546
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:22,760
and he's like, "What?
What have I done now? What?"

547
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,864
And I'm like,
"The Jew comment"

548
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:29,434
and he went, "Oh, the fucking-
They was saying things,

549
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:32,270
I said some things,
I said something. "

550
00:28:34,273 --> 00:28:36,240
"We're at the football. "

551
00:28:41,814 --> 00:28:45,383
You can't argue with that.

552
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:49,887
I'm very excited about America.

553
00:28:52,057 --> 00:28:54,859
I am looking forward
to living here.

554
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:58,896
I gotta tell you.
Now...

555
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:09,774
Now, I get to travel a bit
with this job.

556
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:11,843
Three years ago I was in, uh...

557
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:14,479
South Africa for the
Cape Town Comedy Festival,

558
00:29:14,513 --> 00:29:16,881
I was out there for six weeks
doing gigs.

559
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:19,283
I was out there with a comedian,
a very good friend of mine,

560
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:21,686
I won't say his name, but he's
gay as fuck this guy, right?

561
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,488
And so every day, what we'd do
is we go like,

562
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:26,324
we have a heterosexual day,
try to pick up girls,

563
00:29:26,358 --> 00:29:28,526
and then we go to a gay
nightclub the other day.

564
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,496
So we go into this gay nightclub
in South Africa called Bronco.

565
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,332
Let's face it,
gay nightclub in Africa,

566
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:36,167
should have been called AIDS.

567
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:45,276
We're taking two ecstasy tablets
each, right?

568
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,712
And he's off on the dance floor
trying to get some dick

569
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,280
and I'm standing
at the end of the bar

570
00:29:49,348 --> 00:29:51,549
chatting with a couple of lads
I've never met before,

571
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,718
and one of them goes,
"You're wasted, aren't you?"

572
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:55,119
And I go, "Yep",
and he goes,

573
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:57,021
"Do you want to come
to the bathroom with me?"

574
00:29:57,055 --> 00:29:59,157
Now, as a drug taker,
I think he's offering me

575
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:00,491
a lot of coke.

576
00:30:01,527 --> 00:30:03,461
So I went: "Would I!"

577
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:09,300
I put my arm around him,
dragged him off to the toilet,

578
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:12,036
"Man,this is gonna be
fucking awesome, man"!

579
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:18,309
I went into the stall
first to wipe the seat down,

580
00:30:18,343 --> 00:30:20,444
then I went out
and beckoned him in.

581
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,682
Now I don't know about
all the men in the room

582
00:30:24,716 --> 00:30:27,118
but I know these days when you
get me all fellow zocked off,

583
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:29,587
it takes a little while
to stand to attention.

584
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,088
But he must have
really liked me,

585
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:33,424
'cause he walked in with
what I can only describe

586
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,527
as a great big black cock.

587
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:41,599
He shut the door to the stall.

588
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,635
There are now three
people in the stall:

589
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,205
me, him and the
great big black cock.

590
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:50,708
Just to give the
dimentions of the man,

591
00:30:50,742 --> 00:30:53,344
he's this tall, he's
this wide, the cock's erect,

592
00:30:53,378 --> 00:30:55,046
it's poking into my stomach.

593
00:30:56,114 --> 00:30:58,182
I look up at him and I go...

594
00:31:04,556 --> 00:31:06,557
"I thought we were
gonna do some coke".

595
00:31:09,294 --> 00:31:13,998
And he went: "Do you
want some coke first?"

596
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:27,712
"I only want coke".

597
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,920
"But I can see
how with your accent

598
00:31:35,954 --> 00:31:37,555
you may have
mistaken that for cock?"

599
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:42,126
Now I'd like to say that

600
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,030
something funny happened
after that but, uh, no.

601
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:51,168
No, he was actually
a really good guy,

602
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:53,371
I told him I was wasn't
gay and he apologized,

603
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:55,172
we went out and
he bought me a drink.

604
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:59,210
Um, but for the sake
of comedy, he raped me!

605
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,617
'Cause that makes
the joke more fun.

606
00:32:12,357 --> 00:32:13,791
He raped me.

607
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:20,231
I um, my mother- we'll
talk about my mum a bit.

608
00:32:20,265 --> 00:32:23,834
My mum is a very nice lady,
big fat woman. Can take a punch.

609
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:26,837
Ah,

610
00:32:26,872 --> 00:32:29,473
She- she- uh she's
over 300 pounds, right?

611
00:32:29,508 --> 00:32:31,075
When- when me and
Scotty were young,

612
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:34,378
when- same ages,
nine and five, big year,

613
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:35,980
Uh...

614
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:37,381
Mum took me and Scotty out

615
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:39,817
to see the Moscow Circus
when it came to uh, Sydney.

616
00:32:39,851 --> 00:32:42,920
Now their was an elephant in
the Moscow Circus called Gunter,

617
00:32:42,955 --> 00:32:44,088
and the Circus Master used to

618
00:32:44,122 --> 00:32:46,123
get in front of Gunter
and go: "Up, Gunter up!"

619
00:32:46,158 --> 00:32:48,025
and the elephant used
to rise into it's legs.

620
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,860
I- i- it
was a great show

621
00:32:49,895 --> 00:32:52,063
Anyway, from that moment on

622
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:54,665
me and my brothers would
refer to my mum as Gunter.

623
00:32:57,002 --> 00:32:59,236
Never to her face,
never to her face,

624
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,840
but with such sentences as:
"When's Gunter coming home?"

625
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:04,942
"What's Gunter
making for dinner?"

626
00:33:04,977 --> 00:33:07,378
"Don't do that,
Gunter will catch you!"

627
00:33:09,982 --> 00:33:11,515
Now this still
goes on to this day

628
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,985
but we never once said it to her
face except for this one time

629
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:15,519
when my brother's
about seventeen

630
00:33:15,554 --> 00:33:17,154
and I'm about thirteen,

631
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:18,856
we're at home
watching a mid-day movie.

632
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,059
Now my brother's on the
couch, arm laid on the floor,

633
00:33:22,094 --> 00:33:23,394
my mum's in a chair.

634
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:26,630
Now did anyone have a parent
that had their own chair?

635
00:33:26,665 --> 00:33:28,165
They were always
the cunty parent.

636
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,801
They were never the good one.

637
00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:32,937
If you're a parent
that has their own chair,

638
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:35,206
you're a fascist piece of shit.

639
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,475
If you come home and
someone's sitting in your chair,

640
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:39,443
there's plenty of
other seats, you nazi cunt.

641
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:41,012
You don't fucking
rule the world.

642
00:33:45,784 --> 00:33:47,084
Now she had this chair

643
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,086
or as we called it:
The Throne of Misery,

644
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:50,855
Now,

645
00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:53,057
the Throne of Misery
was a lazyboy chair

646
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:57,361
that had given up all hope and
the springs were all indented.

647
00:33:57,396 --> 00:33:59,163
Now the movie we
are watching is the Blob,

648
00:33:59,197 --> 00:34:00,898
the original Blob
with Steve McQueen,

649
00:34:00,932 --> 00:34:02,400
the old film, mid-day movie.

650
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:03,768
We're watching the Blob,

651
00:34:03,802 --> 00:34:06,971
and the scene were the Blob
is oozing out of the cinema,

652
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:10,374
my brother goes:
"That's you, mum! That's you. "

653
00:34:11,443 --> 00:34:12,810
And me and my brother laugh

654
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:16,113
like it's the funniest
joke that's ever been said,

655
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:19,016
because at the time
there's a good chance it was.

656
00:34:19,051 --> 00:34:22,787
My mother on the other hand
did not find this joke funny.

657
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:26,724
She looks over
at my brother and goes:

658
00:34:26,758 --> 00:34:28,959
You think you're too old
for a smack across the head,

659
00:34:28,994 --> 00:34:30,161
you little fucking bastard?

660
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:35,800
I brought you into this world
and I'll fucking take you out!

661
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:37,468
And then she goes
to get out of the chair

662
00:34:37,502 --> 00:34:40,471
but she's so fat and so angry,
she can't get any leverage.

663
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:43,174
So she's just rocking
from side to side:

664
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:46,677
"You fucking kids!
I used to have a life",

665
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:49,313
and her head slash neck
which was all the same to me

666
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:51,148
is getting
redder and veinier!

667
00:34:53,952 --> 00:34:59,623
My brother knows he has
so much time to run away,

668
00:34:59,658 --> 00:35:04,261
that he
casually walks over,

669
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:06,330
stands in front of her,

670
00:35:06,364 --> 00:35:08,199
turns to me and winks,

671
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,201
and goes: "Up, Gunter, up!"

672
00:35:20,812 --> 00:35:24,215
And that's the funniest
fucking thing I've ever seen.

673
00:35:31,523 --> 00:35:34,091
I uh-

674
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:38,129
I've got a theory.

675
00:35:38,163 --> 00:35:40,764
Every single time a man
sleeps with a lot of women,

676
00:35:40,799 --> 00:35:42,266
he's called a stud.

677
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,503
But if a woman sleeps with a
lot of men, she's called a slut.

678
00:35:45,537 --> 00:35:48,072
And people
think this is unfair.

679
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:49,073
Not!

680
00:35:51,343 --> 00:35:53,410
It's completely fair.

681
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,379
And I'll tell
you why, right?

682
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:58,916
'Cause it's fucking
easy to be a slut.

683
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,286
It's fucking
hard to be a stud.

684
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:06,524
To be a stud you have to be
witty, charming, well-dressed,

685
00:36:06,558 --> 00:36:11,295
have nice shoes and a fab job.

686
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:14,465
To be a slut you
just have to be there.

687
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:19,370
There are fat
ugly sluts out there.

688
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:21,305
There are no fat ugly studs.

689
00:36:23,608 --> 00:36:26,977
I've met slutty dwarfs,
I've never met a stud dwarf.

690
00:36:29,014 --> 00:36:32,049
Maybe in their own realm,
but none that have crossed over

691
00:36:33,718 --> 00:36:36,587
to our world.

692
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:38,556
And,

693
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:41,492
I will say realm
when I mention dwarfs.

694
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:43,093
Realm is the
right- right word

695
00:36:43,128 --> 00:36:44,695
because

696
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:46,764
if fantasy movies and
science fiction films

697
00:36:46,798 --> 00:36:47,898
have taught me anything

698
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:50,834
is that dwarfs are the
only socially acceptable

699
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:54,038
form of disability
to put in a movie,

700
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:57,007
without anyone questioning
what the fuck you're doing.

701
00:36:58,977 --> 00:37:00,277
You think of another disability

702
00:37:00,312 --> 00:37:02,112
that's been dressed
up as something else.

703
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:03,414
Nothing.

704
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:05,516
Dwarfs, we'll paint 'em
orange, make 'em dance,

705
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,517
call 'em Oommpa Loompa.

706
00:37:09,287 --> 00:37:15,359
George Lucas can ring
up a dwarf farm, and go:

707
00:37:15,393 --> 00:37:17,461
"I need a hundred dwarfs",

708
00:37:17,495 --> 00:37:19,129
"put 'em in bear outfits".

709
00:37:20,732 --> 00:37:23,467
"We'll call 'em ewocks,
let's make this movie happen!".

710
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:28,205
Try doing that with Cerebral
Palsy and see were it gets ya!

711
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,676
"I need fifteen spastics",

712
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:36,046
"Cover 'em in fur, we'll
call 'em Wonky Donky Monsters".

713
00:37:37,115 --> 00:37:39,149
"They protect the emperor".

714
00:37:39,184 --> 00:37:41,185
"Let's make
this movie happen!"

715
00:37:43,822 --> 00:37:47,391
I uh- I was
talking about the-

716
00:37:47,425 --> 00:37:50,861
sluts and studs before and...

717
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:57,201
when I say sluts I don't
mean that as a bad word.

718
00:37:57,235 --> 00:38:02,239
I love sluts. I fucking-
I need 'em in my life, sluts.

719
00:38:02,274 --> 00:38:04,241
They're the best.

720
00:38:04,276 --> 00:38:06,176
I- I want what
everyone wants in this world.

721
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:07,244
I- I wanna-

722
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:10,414
I wanna fall in
love, I wanta get married,

723
00:38:10,448 --> 00:38:13,017
I wanta have kids,
I wanta be happy ever after,

724
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:14,451
but the problem is,

725
00:38:14,486 --> 00:38:18,088
I've done this job for so
long and fucked so many sluts,

726
00:38:18,123 --> 00:38:20,624
that I can't
go back to nice girls.

727
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,895
'Cause nice girls
are shit in bed.

728
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:26,497
Now I know there are
a lot of nice girls

729
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:28,132
in the room right
now. They're going:

730
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,633
"You don't know me".

731
00:38:31,136 --> 00:38:32,102
"I'm dirty".

732
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:36,940
No you're fucking not,
you're shit in bed.

733
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,177
But it's not your
fault, it's not your fault.

734
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:42,579
It's that everything is
worked out for you in your life.

735
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,748
I'm not blaming you,
nothing bad has happened,

736
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:46,950
and therefore you
wouldn't do disgusting things.

737
00:38:46,985 --> 00:38:48,218
I appreciate that.

738
00:38:48,253 --> 00:38:49,987
Now I know you're
thinking you're dirty,

739
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:51,555
I- let me see if
I got you right here.

740
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:54,191
All the girls that think they're
dirty but they're nice girls,

741
00:38:54,225 --> 00:38:55,259
I can see you out there.

742
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:56,760
Y- You think
you're dirty because

743
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,763
you have a nurse's
outfit or a schoolgirl outfit

744
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:00,931
or something like that.

745
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:02,399
You uh, deep throat a cock

746
00:39:02,434 --> 00:39:04,968
because you saw someone doing it
in a porn once and you think

747
00:39:05,003 --> 00:39:06,770
"Oh my boyfriend will dig that".

748
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:11,175
Ah, you take it up the ass four
times a year, am I correct?

749
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:15,546
Now please don't think that
I don't appreciate the effort.

750
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:20,918
Because I do, I-
thank you so much for trying.

751
00:39:22,087 --> 00:39:23,854
But I'll tell you
what the difference is,

752
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:25,356
when you deep throat a cock,

753
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,491
you're doing it because
you've seen it in a porn

754
00:39:27,525 --> 00:39:29,727
and you think your
boyfriend will enjoy it.

755
00:39:29,761 --> 00:39:31,295
When a slut deep throats a cock,

756
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:34,331
she's doing it because she
can't last another second

757
00:39:34,366 --> 00:39:37,534
without having a cock
bruising the back of her throat.

758
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,576
When you've got a cock in
your ass, you're thinking:

759
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,079
"This isn't so bad. I hope
he's enjoyed his birthday".

760
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,122
When a slut's got a cock
in her ass she's thinking:

761
00:39:58,156 --> 00:40:01,125
"You know what'd be good?
Two cocks in my ass!"

762
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:08,866
And you can't learn this.

763
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:15,005
That has to be in your system,
that has to be part of you.

764
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,774
But the thing is
you can't marry the slut,

765
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:18,675
you can't have a
relationship with the slut,

766
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,011
because slut's
are fucking mental!

767
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,449
Mental! That's what makes them
good, they've got some power.

768
00:40:25,483 --> 00:40:29,486
I fucked this girl five
months ago for four months.

769
00:40:29,521 --> 00:40:31,288
All right? For four
months I fucked her,

770
00:40:31,322 --> 00:40:32,890
and then a couple weeks ago,

771
00:40:32,924 --> 00:40:35,959
she walks up,
four and a half months

772
00:40:35,994 --> 00:40:37,594
from the moment I met her,

773
00:40:37,629 --> 00:40:41,131
she walks up at my
house with a baby, going:

774
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,433
"This is your baby!".

775
00:40:46,037 --> 00:40:49,306
Now I'm not great
at maths, all right?

776
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,074
And the baby's Chinese,

777
00:40:52,544 --> 00:40:56,680
and there's a Chinese family
crying: "Give us back our baby!"

778
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:05,322
Fucking mental.

779
00:41:05,356 --> 00:41:06,790
See the thing is,

780
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:08,459
now I'm saying,
sluts, there might be

781
00:41:08,493 --> 00:41:09,560
some women in the audience

782
00:41:09,594 --> 00:41:11,195
that feel uncomfortable with-

783
00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:14,231
I'm gonna do some
cunt jokes now.

784
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:16,733
I'm gonna do
some jokes about cunts.

785
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:19,636
Now the thing is
with doing cunt jokes,

786
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:21,772
I know- and also the word
"cunt" you don't like it,

787
00:41:21,806 --> 00:41:22,773
do you America?

788
00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:24,441
You're not comfortable with it

789
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:27,978
There's women that every
time I say the word "cunt",

790
00:41:28,012 --> 00:41:30,547
they're like Aw, Jesus!

791
00:41:30,582 --> 00:41:33,016
You just don't like it
and- and you accept it from me

792
00:41:33,051 --> 00:41:35,319
because "Oh he's foreign,
he doesn't know better".

793
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:38,922
I do know better
I just don't give a fuck.

794
00:41:40,225 --> 00:41:42,593
The thing is you've got
worse words in America,

795
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:44,928
like- like you haven't
heard me say "mother fucker",

796
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,563
Have you?
It's ridiculous that word.

797
00:41:47,765 --> 00:41:50,200
I think it just sounds
terrible in my accent,

798
00:41:50,235 --> 00:41:52,536
just you- you- you
god damn mother fucker!

799
00:41:55,073 --> 00:41:57,641
The word "mother fucker" is
much more offensive than "cunt".

800
00:41:57,675 --> 00:42:00,410
It's, "cunt" is, it's-
it's- it's it's in Shakespeare,

801
00:42:00,445 --> 00:42:02,613
in Chauser, it's the oldest
swear word in the world.

802
00:42:02,647 --> 00:42:03,614
It's lovely.

803
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:07,284
But mother fucker is so brash.

804
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:08,485
Eh...

805
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,489
Let's break down
the word mother fucker, right?

806
00:42:12,524 --> 00:42:15,058
It's a boy fucking his mum.

807
00:42:16,728 --> 00:42:18,061
In the cunt. It's horrible.

808
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:24,334
Now I'm gonna do some
jokes about female genitalia.

809
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:27,104
Now I don't feel bad about
doing this anyway because

810
00:42:27,138 --> 00:42:28,872
I haven't been
to many comedy clubs

811
00:42:28,907 --> 00:42:30,374
where I haven't
seen a female comic

812
00:42:30,408 --> 00:42:32,976
do some routine about
men having small dicks.

813
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:34,645
And not being able
to get their dick up,

814
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:37,180
and what's wrong with men, when
you fuck 'em, a, b, c and d...

815
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:41,084
And I- I've never seen
a man at the end of the show

816
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,653
walk up to the manager and go

817
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:43,820
"well I enjoyed it,

818
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:46,490
but I feel that penis
stuff was unnecessary".

819
00:42:49,127 --> 00:42:50,928
Men just fucking, "Aw,

820
00:42:50,962 --> 00:42:53,030
I got a small dick what
are you gonna do about it?"

821
00:42:55,567 --> 00:42:57,167
See, women always
go for the dick,

822
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:59,903
they think that's men's Achilles
Heel, they always go after you.

823
00:42:59,938 --> 00:43:01,238
"It's not funny, it's funny... "

824
00:43:01,272 --> 00:43:03,073
Every time
you shag a bird,

825
00:43:03,107 --> 00:43:06,643
and you're not good to her,
and then like a week later,

826
00:43:06,678 --> 00:43:07,844
you don't call her,

827
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:09,980
all the friends will
walk past you and do that.

828
00:43:12,016 --> 00:43:13,083
And women think that's

829
00:43:13,117 --> 00:43:14,885
the funniest joke
in the world, right?

830
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:16,987
That's not funny,
that's hurtful.

831
00:43:19,624 --> 00:43:22,225
Next time you think about doing
that, imagine you fuck a guy,

832
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,294
the next day all of his
mates walk past you and go:

833
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:32,436
You never do that again!

834
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,971
And you think by doing this

835
00:43:34,005 --> 00:43:36,473
you're teaching me something I
don't already fucking know?

836
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:40,911
I'm well aware I've got a
small dick, I've measured it.

837
00:43:40,945 --> 00:43:43,981
I know how big my dick
is to the millimeter.

838
00:43:44,015 --> 00:43:46,049
But does any woman in this room

839
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:47,884
truly know the
size of their cunt?

840
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,855
None of you, and none of
you will ever know for sure

841
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:54,524
because no man's gonna tell
you because we're good people.

842
00:44:01,232 --> 00:44:02,399
I know what you're thinking.

843
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:03,900
He's not talking about my cunt

844
00:44:03,935 --> 00:44:06,003
'cause it gets
a bit sore during sex.

845
00:44:06,037 --> 00:44:07,337
That means fuckle.

846
00:44:07,372 --> 00:44:09,239
I've been down on
a woman for twenty minutes,

847
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:11,708
it's wide open, it's
flowing like the Mary River,

848
00:44:11,743 --> 00:44:13,110
I put the tip
of my cock in there,

849
00:44:13,144 --> 00:44:14,578
they go "Gentle,
gentle, gentle".

850
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:16,480
"I could shove my
fucking head in that".

851
00:44:24,522 --> 00:44:26,823
Sometimes fat chicks
have really tight cunts.

852
00:44:26,858 --> 00:44:27,991
That's a bloody mistery eh?

853
00:44:29,494 --> 00:44:32,529
I think it's 'cause all
the fat's pushing inwards,

854
00:44:32,563 --> 00:44:33,697
and when you're fucking 'em,

855
00:44:33,731 --> 00:44:35,399
you're just rubbing up
against thighs

856
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:37,167
and you never
actually reach the cunt.

857
00:44:41,272 --> 00:44:42,439
That's why doctor's say

858
00:44:42,473 --> 00:44:44,641
fat women have to
lose weight to get pregnant.

859
00:45:02,193 --> 00:45:05,295
Yeah.

860
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:06,897
That's a good joke.

861
00:45:11,469 --> 00:45:13,103
I- I'll tell
you a bit about me,

862
00:45:13,137 --> 00:45:14,337
I- as I'm getting older,

863
00:45:14,372 --> 00:45:16,873
I'm finding it harder
and harder to- to come.

864
00:45:16,908 --> 00:45:18,341
I used to be able
to come like that,

865
00:45:18,376 --> 00:45:19,676
I was like an
orgasming ninja.

866
00:45:19,711 --> 00:45:20,744
I could come whenever I-

867
00:45:22,213 --> 00:45:26,983
And now I can't come so much
because each day that goes by...

868
00:45:27,018 --> 00:45:30,153
I- I can come if I'm
masturbating because I know me.

869
00:45:31,923 --> 00:45:33,457
But if there's a chick involved

870
00:45:33,491 --> 00:45:36,693
and it's not really nasty and
everything, I can't really...

871
00:45:36,728 --> 00:45:38,095
No.

872
00:45:38,129 --> 00:45:41,465
So what I do is I fake orgasm
now because I wear condoms.

873
00:45:41,499 --> 00:45:44,134
And if you wear condoms the girl
doesn't know that you're faking

874
00:45:44,168 --> 00:45:46,837
and I can't come with a condom
on. Those days are long gone.

875
00:45:46,871 --> 00:45:48,405
Eh!

876
00:45:48,439 --> 00:45:51,041
and I fake orgasm
with a condom on,

877
00:45:51,075 --> 00:45:53,777
eh, and women don't
think that men can fake orgasm

878
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:55,612
but we can
fucking fake orgasm.

879
00:45:55,646 --> 00:45:57,147
You think
that's your only domain.

880
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:58,682
The weird thing is that men...

881
00:45:58,716 --> 00:46:01,852
I have to fake orgasm
because if I don't come,

882
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:03,386
a girl will
take that personally,

883
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:05,288
like she hasn't
done a good job, right?

884
00:46:05,323 --> 00:46:08,225
And women fake orgasms
because, I don't know why.

885
00:46:08,259 --> 00:46:09,459
I don't give a shit.

886
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,899
I have done my best.
What do you want from me?

887
00:46:15,933 --> 00:46:19,069
I'm a- I'm trying, I- I-

888
00:46:19,103 --> 00:46:21,772
if I haven't made you come,
I've made girls come before.

889
00:46:21,806 --> 00:46:23,974
Don't blame me. Your
cunt's broken. All right?

890
00:46:29,247 --> 00:46:32,783
And- and- and female orgasm's
all wailing and jiggly legs

891
00:46:32,817 --> 00:46:34,818
like I'll never crack
that code or something.

892
00:46:36,821 --> 00:46:40,223
But my fake orgasm
as a man is a piece of piss.

893
00:46:40,258 --> 00:46:43,126
This is me fake
orgasming with a condom on.

894
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:45,462
Now what I do is
I put 'em in doggy style,

895
00:46:45,496 --> 00:46:51,768
and then I just go like this:

896
00:46:51,803 --> 00:46:52,903
There you go! Uh!

897
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,841
And then I take the
condom off really quickly

898
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:58,842
and run to the bin.

899
00:46:58,876 --> 00:47:00,777
"Oh just put this over here",

900
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:05,615
which is very similar
to how my dad runs.

901
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:08,885
Eh! "Don't come over here!" You
know, you put tissues over...

902
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,987
"Don't come near the bin!
You'll get pregnant!"

903
00:47:11,022 --> 00:47:12,189
"There's so much come here".

904
00:47:13,925 --> 00:47:18,395
"Be careful!"

905
00:47:18,429 --> 00:47:21,865
Which leaves me
to ask the next question:

906
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:26,436
If I come like this,

907
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,371
When retarded people come,

908
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:35,178
do they look
normal for a second?

909
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:43,286
Is there a little
window of time where...?

910
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:03,506
Uh, let's finish
up on a story,

911
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:07,110
we've got, you know...

912
00:48:07,144 --> 00:48:12,048
Now, uh, a few years back,
maybe four years ago now,

913
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:13,850
I was performing in
the Amsterdam Hilton,

914
00:48:13,885 --> 00:48:16,853
now the base of the Amsterdam
Hilton have a comedy club,

915
00:48:16,888 --> 00:48:18,021
and I was there for two weeks.

916
00:48:18,055 --> 00:48:19,656
I had two days off
from my two weeks,

917
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:21,825
and I found out that on
the outskirts of Amsterdam

918
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:24,294
there's a great big place
called the Porn Warehouse,

919
00:48:24,328 --> 00:48:25,829
which is like
a great big Walmart.

920
00:48:27,598 --> 00:48:29,799
So on my day off I thought:
"Fuck Ann Frank's place".

921
00:48:30,935 --> 00:48:34,704
And- I went out to
the Porn Warehouse.

922
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:36,139
Now when I go grocery shopping,

923
00:48:36,173 --> 00:48:38,408
I take a little
plastic basket with me.

924
00:48:38,442 --> 00:48:39,976
Porn warehouse, took a trolley.

925
00:48:41,212 --> 00:48:43,313
It still had the kid seat,
which I thought was odd.

926
00:48:47,151 --> 00:48:48,518
Now I'm lining my trolley

927
00:48:48,552 --> 00:48:51,087
full of every little bit of porn
and paraphernalia I can get,

928
00:48:51,122 --> 00:48:52,489
I get up
towards the till and

929
00:48:52,523 --> 00:48:54,457
there's a massive wall
covered in dildo's.

930
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:56,693
Now if you're with your
mates, what would you do?

931
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:57,694
Sword fight!

932
00:48:59,764 --> 00:49:02,365
But I was by myself so I just
do that scene from Star Wars

933
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,338
where there's like the
floating wall with the...

934
00:49:08,372 --> 00:49:10,507
Now there's a smaller
wall but just as impressive,

935
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:12,108
covered in rubber vibrating
vaginas.

936
00:49:12,143 --> 00:49:14,511
Now whenever you're with
your mates and see one of those,

937
00:49:14,545 --> 00:49:16,479
you go "Who the fuck
would use one of those eh?"

938
00:49:16,514 --> 00:49:18,381
There's always a bit
of your brain that goes:

939
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:20,083
"Wouldn't mind
trying that just once".

940
00:49:20,117 --> 00:49:24,387
So, I got myself
the Jimmy Jammers

941
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:25,655
and rubber vibrating vagina

942
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:26,790
and the side of the box said:

943
00:49:26,824 --> 00:49:29,225
"Vibrates so as to give
realistic sensation. "

944
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,761
Realistic if your fucking
a chick with Parkinson,

945
00:49:31,796 --> 00:49:35,632
but not realistic
in the full sense.

946
00:49:38,235 --> 00:49:40,070
Now I'm going back
to my hotel and decided

947
00:49:40,104 --> 00:49:42,272
if I'm gonna have this
wank, it'll be the wank.

948
00:49:42,306 --> 00:49:44,441
It's gotta be the wank
that when I've got dementia

949
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:46,242
I'll be sitting in
a nursing home going:

950
00:49:49,246 --> 00:49:50,680
I fucked a rubber cunt!

951
00:49:53,184 --> 00:49:54,617
I f- I fucked it!

952
00:49:56,787 --> 00:49:58,922
Wednsday's pudding day!

953
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,964
So I put on me porn
on one side of the bed,

954
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,165
I put porn on the telly,

955
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,233
I got the rubber cunt,

956
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:12,002
it had a vibrating
egg that went on the end

957
00:50:12,036 --> 00:50:14,437
with a cord
to a remote control.

958
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:17,540
I uh, lubed up my cock
and I proceeded to fuck it.

959
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:20,777
Now, it felt okay but
I couldn't really enjoy meself

960
00:50:20,811 --> 00:50:23,013
because the only thought
going through me head was:

961
00:50:23,047 --> 00:50:24,848
"If you die right now",

962
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:30,620
this is how they'll tell
your mum they found you".

963
00:50:33,724 --> 00:50:35,959
Now as I've already mentioned,
I don't have a big cock.

964
00:50:35,993 --> 00:50:37,494
I think the
rubber cunt was faulty.

965
00:50:37,528 --> 00:50:38,595
'Cause as I'm fucking it,

966
00:50:38,629 --> 00:50:40,964
the latex on the top
just sort of tears,

967
00:50:40,998 --> 00:50:42,665
and the egg falls out the end,

968
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,967
and I'm pretty upset 'cause

969
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:47,937
it's not like I can
take it back to the shop,

970
00:50:47,972 --> 00:50:51,608
slap it on
the counter and go:

971
00:50:54,712 --> 00:50:55,678
"Look at that".

972
00:50:58,149 --> 00:51:00,083
"I bought that an hour ago",

973
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:07,657
"went home and fucked it",

974
00:51:10,394 --> 00:51:11,461
"now that cunt's broken".

975
00:51:13,597 --> 00:51:17,467
Now, I still had a lot of
lube, I still had a lot of porn,

976
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:19,469
and I still had
a vibrating egg.

977
00:51:19,503 --> 00:51:22,505
So I did what anyone
in this room would do:

978
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,941
I lubed that egg up
and shoved it up me ass!

979
00:51:27,511 --> 00:51:29,112
It's now sitting
up against the gland

980
00:51:29,146 --> 00:51:30,246
called the prostate gland.

981
00:51:30,281 --> 00:51:32,082
The male g spot.
It felt terrific.

982
00:51:32,116 --> 00:51:33,416
I was enjoying myself so much

983
00:51:33,451 --> 00:51:35,819
I was already thinking of
other things to shove up me ass

984
00:51:35,853 --> 00:51:36,886
once I got back to London.

985
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:39,756
I slapped me cock
a couple of times

986
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:41,191
and I gizzed all over me chest.

987
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:43,560
so now I've got gizzle all
over me chest, lube on me cock,

988
00:51:43,594 --> 00:51:46,262
egg hanging out me ass,
broken cunt in the corner.

989
00:51:46,297 --> 00:51:48,598
I gotta tell you,
I've looked better.

990
00:51:55,439 --> 00:51:58,475
Now you know that bit of pain
that goes through your soul

991
00:51:58,509 --> 00:52:01,444
after you've had a wank and you
got a bit of come on your hand?

992
00:52:01,479 --> 00:52:03,079
and you go:
"What did you do that for?"

993
00:52:05,983 --> 00:52:07,684
"You're a grown man. "

994
00:52:09,353 --> 00:52:12,155
Well I still had an egg
hanging out of my ass.

995
00:52:14,492 --> 00:52:16,459
Safe to say
I wanted to kill meself,

996
00:52:16,494 --> 00:52:18,561
so I started slapping
the porn off the bed,

997
00:52:18,596 --> 00:52:20,230
turn the porn off the telly.

998
00:52:20,264 --> 00:52:24,167
I go to whip the egg outta me
ass, the fucking cord snaps off!

999
00:52:27,037 --> 00:52:28,805
Not only does it snap off,

1000
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:33,843
but the two plastic shells of
the egg slightly break apart,

1001
00:52:33,878 --> 00:52:36,045
and are now pinching
against me colon!

1002
00:52:41,352 --> 00:52:42,752
Now you're first thought is:

1003
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:45,388
"Well don't worry about this
Jim, you can shit this out".

1004
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:49,025
But your ass hole
knows what shit is

1005
00:52:49,059 --> 00:52:51,161
and it knows
what plastic egg is,

1006
00:52:51,195 --> 00:52:53,329
and it don't play
cricket in this situation.

1007
00:52:56,367 --> 00:52:59,636
Now, I don't know if you all
know a lot about your colon,

1008
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,137
and know should 'ya,

1009
00:53:01,172 --> 00:53:06,342
But they're made up of several
channels that pump poo through.

1010
00:53:06,377 --> 00:53:09,445
Now I've lubed up
this finger and this thumb.

1011
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,149
And I've gone up
me ass after the egg.

1012
00:53:13,184 --> 00:53:15,318
With every grab
I've pushed it further,

1013
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:22,192
and further
and further up my colon.

1014
00:53:22,226 --> 00:53:23,927
It's now up to channel five.

1015
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:29,899
My next thought was to get a
whole lot of high fiber food,

1016
00:53:29,934 --> 00:53:33,570
make my poo really solid, push
the egg out through pressure,

1017
00:53:33,604 --> 00:53:35,638
very similar to when
Augustus Gloop got stuck

1018
00:53:35,673 --> 00:53:36,673
in the chocolate chute in

1019
00:53:36,707 --> 00:53:38,274
Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory.

1020
00:53:41,312 --> 00:53:43,479
I was working on
one method at a time.

1021
00:53:43,514 --> 00:53:45,782
I could've done with an
Oommpa Loompa with a plunger.

1022
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,323
Now as many of you
may have already realized,

1023
00:53:53,357 --> 00:53:54,324
I'm not a doctor.

1024
00:53:57,428 --> 00:54:01,497
I didn't know that high fiber
food made you poo sloppy.

1025
00:54:01,532 --> 00:54:04,200
I thought the grains
and stuff held together

1026
00:54:04,235 --> 00:54:06,002
to make some type of super poo.

1027
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:11,608
Turns out that protein
makes you poo hard.

1028
00:54:11,642 --> 00:54:15,245
Ironically, I should've
been eating boiled eggs.

1029
00:54:15,279 --> 00:54:19,082
Insted, I had to shit
the way around the egg.

1030
00:54:29,126 --> 00:54:31,794
I don't feel like you're
all getting into this story.

1031
00:54:33,864 --> 00:54:35,932
So let's jump forward
to day number three.

1032
00:54:41,272 --> 00:54:44,107
I decided that if it
was up my ass for another day,

1033
00:54:44,141 --> 00:54:45,541
I was gonna go to hospital.

1034
00:54:47,244 --> 00:54:50,613
My biggest fear was going to
hospital in a foreign country

1035
00:54:50,648 --> 00:54:52,448
with my accent and going:

1036
00:54:52,483 --> 00:54:54,450
"You'll never guess
what's happened to me".

1037
00:54:57,554 --> 00:55:00,523
But being Holland there's
a good chance he could go:

1038
00:55:00,591 --> 00:55:01,858
"You have an egg up your ass?"

1039
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,364
"Go join the cue
with the other australians".

1040
00:55:14,204 --> 00:55:20,743
On day number three
I had a chinese dinner.

1041
00:55:20,778 --> 00:55:22,178
And I kept my chopsticks.

1042
00:55:29,086 --> 00:55:31,888
Now I've gone
back to the hotel.

1043
00:55:31,922 --> 00:55:35,325
I've bent over

1044
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,994
At this moment
I've thought to myself:

1045
00:55:38,028 --> 00:55:40,596
"You probably should've
gone to the Ann Frank museum".

1046
00:55:44,768 --> 00:55:47,837
I put one chopstick
on top of the egg,

1047
00:55:47,871 --> 00:55:49,605
in a crow bearing fashion.

1048
00:55:51,575 --> 00:55:54,410
The other chopstick
I used to widen the hole.

1049
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:04,187
In one motion I snapped
this egg outta my ass.

1050
00:56:04,221 --> 00:56:05,955
Followed by two feet of shit.

1051
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:16,199
It was at this
moment I thought to meself:

1052
00:56:16,266 --> 00:56:17,967
Shoulda done that
in the bathroom!

1053
00:56:20,938 --> 00:56:22,939
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much!
