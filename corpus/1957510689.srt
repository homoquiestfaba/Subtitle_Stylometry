1
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,393
Amy, can I see you for a second?

2
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:26,694
Yeah, great work, Victor.

3
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,196
Catch you in a couple of months.

4
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:29,763
Hey.

5
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,698
I need an answer.

6
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:32,533
I gave an answer weeks ago.

7
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,843
I've got a flight to
catch in three hours.

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,536
My cab's downstairs.

9
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,771
This is a good offer,
I want you on the team.

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,341
Ah, freelance, Hal, freedom,

11
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,076
endless new horizons.

12
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,216
Five grand more a year,
it's the best that I can do.

13
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:48,116
I'm not playing hard to get.

14
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:50,118
Sticking with the
on-the-road gambit.

15
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:52,153
I pick Thelma and
Louise up on Tuesday.

16
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,231
Well, if you hit the Grand
Canyon without a body count

17
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:56,157
and find the cash
reserves getting low...

18
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:57,625
You'll be my first call.

19
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,496
Yes, this is Amy.

20
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,333
Annie Landry?

21
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,170
Yeah, I know her, knew
her, another lifetime ago.

22
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,373
Handle it in person?

23
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,842
No, I'm sorry, there
must be another way.

24
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,544
I'm on my way overseas.

25
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,649
Please, don't call it home.

26
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,118
I'll figure something out.

27
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,427
♫ Rolling down the road

28
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:07,595
♫ Going nowhere

29
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,763
♫ Guitar packed in the trunk

30
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,401
♫ Somewhere round
mile marker 112

31
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,536
♫ Papa started humming the funk

32
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,839
♫ I got a jones in my
bones before they know

33
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,209
♫ We were singing this melody

34
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,145
♫ Stop the car
pulled out the guitar

35
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,847
♫ Halfway to New Orleans

36
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,417
♫ Said take me home

37
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:32,220
♫ Home, home, home

38
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,223
♫ Take me home

39
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,591
♫ Home, home, home

40
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:44,365
♫ Could feel the
sun about to rise

41
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:47,568
♫ When I realized we
had nothing to fear

42
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,804
♫ It's just me and my
daddy and a kid named Cope

43
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,574
♫ Making music that
nobody would hear

44
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,577
♫ And then the sun let
up and it split the night

45
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,879
♫ Spilling over our jubilee

46
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,583
♫ 10,000 cars by
the side of the road

47
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,893
♫ Grooving far as
the eye can see ♫

48
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,519
Thanks for
squeezing me in, Bell.

49
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,588
Trying to get this
wrapped up quickly.

50
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,891
No, no, I don't need directions.

51
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:12,960
Everything's right
where I left it.

52
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,763
♫ Home, home, home

53
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:21,235
♫ Said take me
home, home, home ♫

54
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,974
This is a springing
power of attorney.

55
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,509
Springing?

56
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,977
There's a trigger.

57
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,612
When the doctor
determined that Annie

58
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,447
could no longer make
decisions for herself,

59
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,848
the trigger was sprung.

60
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,450
That's when you were notified.

61
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,386
I didn't have to approve it?

62
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:40,988
The designee is not
required to give consent.

63
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,291
I mean, it's unusual that the
power would be transferred

64
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,260
to someone who's not a
relative or close friend,

65
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,262
but it is perfectly legal.

66
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,265
Okay, so how do I get out of it?

67
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,433
You don't.

68
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,567
It's binding.

69
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,303
What?

70
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:56,704
I have a plane to catch.

71
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,706
I have plans 6,000 miles away.

72
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,541
I have a life out there.

73
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,810
This life ended for
me a long time ago.

74
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,245
Would you just
listen to yourself?

75
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,649
Annie is dying
and probably soon.

76
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:10,751
She asked for you.

77
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,922
Bell, Annie had hundreds of
students, taught thousands.

78
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,492
I haven't even spoken
to her since...

79
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,903
Look at us.

80
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,039
Look at us.

81
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,676
God, that was her
whole life, wasn't it?

82
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,615
I'm glad you decided to come.

83
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,884
I don't issue many
personal invitations.

84
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,354
You, so good to see you.

85
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:51,992
Everybody, everybody, everybody.

86
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,928
Welcome to the first
official meeting

87
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:59,400
of the St. Delphine speech
and debate team for 1984.

88
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,473
We had an amazing
time last year,

89
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:08,742
our fifth straight
state championship

90
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:12,346
led by the unbelievable
team of Miller and Bourke.

91
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:15,849
They came this
close, this close,

92
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,719
to a national championship.

93
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,888
Who's next?

94
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,991
Who's here to fill those shoes?

95
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,760
If you are here
today, in this room,

96
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,796
thinking you can be
part of this tradition,

97
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,098
thinking you can go
on trips every weekend

98
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,967
to places like Baton
Rouge, Lake Charles,

99
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,838
Alexandria, Shreveport and
its fabulous twin city,

100
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,940
Bossier City.

101
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,618
Well, how about New
Orleans? Is that better?

102
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,443
Yeah!

103
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,412
Let me hear some noise.

104
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,914
And for those of you
who work hard enough,

105
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,849
who practice long enough,

106
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,685
who have the innate
smarts and talents,

107
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,305
who slip me a little
money on the side,

108
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,989
New York in October,

109
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,091
Chicago in November,

110
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,960
Boston in February,

111
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,763
Los Angeles, California in April

112
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,999
and this year's national
championship location,

113
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,968
Miami, Florida.

114
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,403
Are you in?

115
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:10,738
Yeah.

116
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,073
Are you ready to make
this team your new home?

117
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,475
Yes.

118
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:15,919
To work hard every
day, every weekend,

119
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:20,514
forsaking all others and
keep the tradition alive?

120
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:22,916
Let's get to work people!

121
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,033
Oh, Annie.

122
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:22,042
Been here for weeks by
myself since she got so sick.

123
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,077
No family, no visitors.

124
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,880
How are you related to her?

125
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,081
Oh, I'm not.

126
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,593
I haven't seen her
since high school.

127
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:30,684
We lost touch.

128
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,020
Mmm, yeah, there's
more to that story.

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,522
Past is past.

130
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:37,591
I'm here out of an
obligation to the paperwork.

131
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,893
I'm going to see it through.

132
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,962
Past is never past, my friend.

133
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,798
But I'm not gonna bug you.

134
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,066
Thank you.

135
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:48,935
New York, right?

136
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,003
Mostly.

137
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,139
I'm a freelance news
producer at CZN.

138
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:56,243
It's a bit of an offshore
schedule, you know 14 on 14 off.

139
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,045
I work for six months
or so in New York

140
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,514
then travel 'til
the money runs out.

141
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:01,949
Ooh, I feel ya.

142
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,019
I'd miss my stuff too much.

143
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,756
My TV, my crawfish,

144
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,758
my mama's rice and gravy.

145
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,961
Well, if you've ever seen
the sun set over the Pacific...

146
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:18,999
My youngest, Kaylie,
is like you, a dreamer.

147
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,235
She saw New York on TV and
thinks that's where she belongs.

148
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,672
Like they're gonna bring out
the welcome wagon.

149
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:25,772
What does she study?

150
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,809
She's never gonna leave
that boyfriend of hers

151
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,010
and go anywhere.

152
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,580
You're selling her short.

153
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,982
You haven't met her yet.

154
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,587
Anyway, I gotta run.

155
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,155
You mind locking
up when you leave?

156
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,957
You're leaving Annie alone?

157
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,893
Her insurance doesn't
pay for a night nurse

158
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,995
and she has her pain meds.

159
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,215
She'll be out all night and
Kathy comes in real early.

160
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,932
That doesn't seem right.

161
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,834
It doesn't mean
you have to stay.

162
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,235
Don't I?

163
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,572
I thought your obligation
was for the paperwork.

164
00:08:58,672 --> 00:08:59,807
Yeah.

165
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,108
So, can you lock up?

166
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,644
When I leave.

167
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,178
Thank you.

168
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,106
Why?

169
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,676
What was so important

170
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,611
that you needed to
get me back here?

171
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,136
- Oh, you came.
- Annie.

172
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,338
Chop up this bell pepper
as finely as you can

173
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,775
and could you hand
me that onion please?

174
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,010
Oh, check the freezer
in the carport.

175
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,387
We need to use up
that shrimp tonight

176
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,280
and there may still
be some crab meat.

177
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,848
Will you go check?

178
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,050
It's just two of us.

179
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,252
For now.

180
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,832
You shouldn't be here.

181
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:06,066
I was invited.

182
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
You'll upset everything.

183
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,937
You need to go, right now.

184
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,321
Oh, stop cleaning up.

185
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,257
Just sit down here for a minute.

186
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,292
Tell me a story.

187
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,240
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all night.

188
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,698
Tonight was heaven.

189
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,900
Wasn't it?

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,202
Better send off than
I could've dreamed.

191
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,737
It was something.

192
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,705
Didn't you
have a good time tonight?

193
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:46,439
Truthfully?

194
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,941
Of course.

195
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:48,942
I had a good time.

196
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,212
Well, that's
not very persuasive.

197
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,747
I taught you better than that.

198
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,087
Nah, you want a perfomance, huh?

199
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,050
I want you to sit here with me.

200
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:58,952
Tell me why.

201
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,463
Isn't it enough that
I wanted to see you?

202
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:03,924
Come on, Annie, the
past was gone, buried.

203
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,458
I moved on.

204
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,030
Mmm, maybe, but
you haven't let go.

205
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,933
You asked Nick to leave tonight.

206
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,802
I don't have
anything to say to him.

207
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:15,969
People leave, Annie.

208
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,338
That's the one truth I do know.

209
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,273
Isn't that what
we're doing here?

210
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,875
Waiting for the end.

211
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,386
Darling, you're the
only one who can decide

212
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,411
why you're here.

213
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,079
Right, a cosmic riddle.

214
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,149
Find peace in uncertainty,
find beauty in loss.

215
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,051
I don't need a zen
Hallmark card, Annie.

216
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,053
Loss is loss, love ends.

217
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,961
Tell me a story.

218
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,864
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all night.

219
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,235
You wanna hear the story?

220
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,905
As if talking can
change the outcome.

221
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:06,019
It started the summer before
Nick and I went to debate camp

222
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,821
in New Orleans.

223
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,124
I couldn't wait to
get out of my house.

224
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,569
Hey, have you seen this?

225
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,506
What the hell, Shane?

226
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:27,440
It's just a joke.

227
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,584
That's three weeks of work.

228
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,110
That's not funny.

229
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,278
Hey, lighten up.

230
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,925
You never could take
a joke. Right, Shaney?

231
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,855
Good job. Hurry up,
Chris ain't gonna wait.

232
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,090
Y'all ready, boys?

233
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,367
And my brother
acted like such a jerk.

234
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,259
It made me glad I was adopted.

235
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,594
Nick was my next stop.

236
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,496
That made everything all right.

237
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,364
I sensed we had a
strong connection,

238
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,467
but I had no idea if he
felt the same way about me.

239
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,469
His family life was
no picnic either.

240
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,838
He wouldn't even let me
pick him up at his house.

241
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,173
We were debate partners.

242
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,273
That was enough.

243
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,110
Debate was where we belonged.

244
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,945
What's with the fancy luggage?

245
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,948
I had to work late,
no time to pack.

246
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:08,848
Your bike?

247
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,483
Nick, there's no room.

248
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,921
We might be a little squished,
but we'll make it work.

249
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,257
Even though I tried to act cool,

250
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,427
Nick'd flash me that smile,
and he'd win every time.

251
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,570
Dang it, Shane. Stupid worms.

252
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,939
Don't worry about it.

253
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,074
There's a Newsweek on the couch.

254
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,174
Go get that.

255
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,081
Any last minute
surprises from your dad?

256
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,515
No, he's been offshore.

257
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,085
Good, 'cause I told your mom

258
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:49,122
in no uncertain terms
that your scholarship

259
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,459
to St. Delphines is conditioned
on your participation

260
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,963
on this debate team, so
this summer camp is crucial.

261
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,430
And Nick knows.

262
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,501
We all know, but I think
it's important that we say it

263
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,104
out loud while
we're here together.

264
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,272
Eat.

265
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:06,339
- Thank you.
- I mean it, Nick.

266
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,075
Everything is open to you,

267
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,011
every possible future
you can imagine,

268
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,614
if, if this year goes the
way I think it should.

269
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,317
You could be the
national champion.

270
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,421
The two of you as a team.

271
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,526
You, you don't have a tie?

272
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,163
Go into Roy's closet,
pick out a tie.

273
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,564
The nicest one you can find.

274
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,932
Okay.

275
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,039
Listen...

276
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,175
I need you to watch out for him.

277
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,344
I know.

278
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,547
You are the rock of this team.

279
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,018
You're careful,
you're responsible.

280
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:53,953
He needs that.

281
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,956
All right.

282
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:00,660
I am going to pick this one.

283
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,462
Okay.

284
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,706
Oh, you guys have to get going

285
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,050
if you're gonna
get to the airport

286
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,499
to pick up Rosa on time.

287
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,168
Who's Rosa?

288
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,536
A girl from Stuyvesant.

289
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,646
Annie told her coach in New York

290
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,139
we'd pick her up in New Orleans.

291
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,107
Get going, come on.

292
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,677
Okay, give me a hug.

293
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,380
Get going.

294
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,016
- Do your best.
- Okay.

295
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,751
You guys make me proud.

296
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,220
So, um...

297
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,058
I need to stop at my
sister's place on the way.

298
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,492
We don't have time.

299
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,295
10 minutes, I
promise. It's important.

300
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,368
Five minutes, no other stops.

301
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,370
I get to pick the music.

302
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,470
Okay.

303
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,698
So, um, here's
some money from mom

304
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:14,201
and a little bit of
what I was able to make.

305
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,704
I know it's not
enough to fix the car,

306
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:21,608
but I thought I'd leave
my bike for a few weeks.

307
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,592
I guess that doesn't
really help much.

308
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,518
Dad bought you that bike.

309
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,596
He'll notice it's missing, and
it'll give him another reason

310
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,188
to go ballistic.

311
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,723
He's offshore.

312
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,225
Mom will tell him.

313
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,592
Maybe.

314
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,061
It was a nice
thought, thank you.

315
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,831
Hey, I have your mail,
college brochures.

316
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,235
Oh, I don't want to keep
Amy waiting any longer.

317
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,603
How about I come on the
way back from New Orleans?

318
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,395
You look like a debater.

319
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:16,529
Rosa?

320
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,131
We're here to pick you up.

321
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,231
We?

322
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,102
That must be Stacen, right?

323
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,571
Now it makes sense.

324
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,806
Adam told my coach
he needed a favor.

325
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,308
I agreed to partner
with Nick here,

326
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,254
and I get my pick of partners
at Dartmouth in August.

327
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,812
He's your warm-up?

328
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,113
Basically.

329
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,882
Later, y'all.

330
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,450
I'm headed to Cancun.

331
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,152
Saint Lucia's nicer.

332
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,827
♫ All the kids just
getting out of school

333
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:51,164
♫ They can't wait to
hang out and be cool ♫

334
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:56,236
Billy Joel, Hall and
Oates, I mean, it's so Top 40.

335
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,870
It was number
one for four weeks.

336
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,606
Should've been five, really.

337
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,741
No, Smiths, The Cure,

338
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,644
I mean, they're replacements,
for God's sakes.

339
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,182
Dear God, where am I?

340
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,442
Oh, sorry, I must
have the wrong...

341
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,876
I asked to transfer.

342
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,478
My first roommate was a bore.

343
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:39,812
I didn't think you'd mind.

344
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,951
You play?

345
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,387
A little, only mess around.

346
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:50,957
Where's your second camp?

347
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:53,860
Second camp?

348
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Yeah.

349
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,396
Lucky to get one.

350
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,265
Nick too?

351
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,766
Mmhmm.

352
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:00,976
Then he'll have to be
as naturally talented

353
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,702
as everyone keeps saying.

354
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,672
But your squad has seniors
at other camps, right?

355
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,206
Just me and Nick.

356
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,587
I saw him at the
end of last year

357
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,277
in quarter finals
with that other guy.

358
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,378
Miles.

359
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:12,845
They were fine.

360
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,882
Nick was one of the only
juniors to get that far.

361
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,917
I know. I just
don't get the hype.

362
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,921
CZN News might cover
the finals this year.

363
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,524
How do you know?

364
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,293
Um, Keith, Adam's
assistant, was asking me

365
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,262
about a woman who went to
my high school a while back.

366
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,664
She works for Bill Tarrity
now, the news anchor.

367
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,966
I know who Bill Tarrity is.

368
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,802
We get national TV here.

369
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,838
Tarrity was a debater.

370
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,340
He was plucked from obscurity

371
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,009
in rural Nebraska or something.

372
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,345
Won nationals, changed his life.

373
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,314
He wants to do an inspiring
story about debate

374
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,317
with Nick as the star,
passing the torch

375
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,685
or the boot straps or something.

376
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,354
Pick your metaphor.

377
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,255
Well, it's good for you, right?

378
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:59,258
I mean, you're Nick's
partner here at camp.

379
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,928
Why would I care about
getting on network news?

380
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,964
Spent my whole life
dodging my father's camera.

381
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:07,534
Do you sing?

382
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:08,868
No.

383
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,470
Come on.

384
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,004
No, like, seriously, no.

385
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,322
Hello?

386
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,033
I'm so sorry for not
calling sooner, Annie.

387
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,659
We're here, everything's fine.

388
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,893
Well, call me again soon.

389
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:34,993
I'm always here.

390
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,005
Yeah, I'll call
again in a few days.

391
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,029
Don't worry.

392
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,140
I would like to
take this opportunity

393
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,047
to formally welcome you to
the Summer Debate Institute.

394
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:47,006
Policy debate has produced
many national leaders

395
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,641
over the generations.

396
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:52,979
Perhaps there's a future
governor or senator among you,

397
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:56,816
a future network news anchor
or Supreme Court justice.

398
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,951
I know that each one of
you represent the best

399
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,320
of what your generation of
young people have to offer

400
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:05,091
this country, and
we are delighted

401
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:08,395
to be some small part
of your preparation.

402
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,563
Lab meetings begin
in 15 minutes.

403
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,583
Keith here, to my right,
has the assignment sheet

404
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,735
if you somehow missed it
yesterday at check-in.

405
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:17,804
Do me proud.

406
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:28,047
Who has memorized
this year's resolution?

407
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,853
Mr. Stacen?

408
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,963
Do you always do his homework?

409
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,967
Rosa, please write the
resolution on the board.

410
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,073
Mr. Stacen, I
expect more from you.

411
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,678
I expect more from all of you.

412
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,014
This isn't summer vacation.

413
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,651
Mr. Carter, proceed.

414
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,622
So, the word from the
esteemed organization

415
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:14,594
which governs our activities
is that some wires, critics,

416
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,663
think that we turn out debaters

417
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:20,166
who can't actually give
a persuasive speech,

418
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,902
that they speed unintelligibly
through piles of evidence

419
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,580
that they can neither
understand nor can make

420
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,773
comprehensible to anyone else.

421
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:30,543
That is not how Adam
and I run our program

422
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,154
up at the paradise
on the Charles River

423
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:34,647
that many of you are
clamoring to attend,

424
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,449
and that is not
how I run this lab.

425
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,451
If you want to
succeed this year,

426
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:41,954
if you think you are capable
of being a national champion,

427
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:43,923
if you wanna gain a
scholarship to my program,

428
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,858
or any other top
program for that matter,

429
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,628
you have to be a top researcher,

430
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,797
a master of logic and reason

431
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,699
and a persuasive speaker.

432
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,834
You have to do it all.

433
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:58,037
It's a decathlon, not a sprint.

434
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,872
We will start with a
series of exercises

435
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,908
on making persuasive speeches,

436
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:03,852
the kind that you would
give to your grandmother

437
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:06,112
or the garden club with the
little finger sandwiches.

438
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:08,948
And then, this afternoon,

439
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,117
our real work begins.

440
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:14,887
I want 10 affirmative
and 10 negative speeches

441
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,657
every morning, fully researched.

442
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,493
Okay, who's next?

443
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:21,928
We need a topic.

444
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,028
Let me see that.

445
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,032
Baton Rouge Monthly, really?

446
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,836
Okay, topic, topic,
what do we got?

447
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,170
Contras, no.

448
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,674
Gorbachev and Star Wars, no.

449
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,876
Deficit, no, we need
something with a moral stake,

450
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,754
something that the
grandmothers will want to hear.

451
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,055
If we wanted to talk
about moral issues,

452
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,719
we would've signed up
for Lincoln Douglas.

453
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,817
Editorial page, okay.

454
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,485
Here's something
for the blue hairs.

455
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,330
You've all heard of this
baby X story, right?

456
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,034
Couple hires this mother
to have their kid.

457
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,925
She changes her mind,
steals the baby back.

458
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,561
Rosa, should the
United States allow

459
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:58,035
surrogate mother contracts or
should we ban the practice?

460
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,108
Five minutes go, oh, next
person takes the opposite side,

461
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,568
all around 'til we're done.

462
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,002
We need prep.

463
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,346
If you need prep, you
don't belong in this lab.

464
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,838
Rosa, go.

465
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,115
- Which side?
- Doesn't matter.

466
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,040
I can do either, you pick.

467
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,208
Against.

468
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,186
Women in this country
are barely a decade

469
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:11,243
into a new era in which
they have full control

470
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,811
of their reproductive
rights and choices.

471
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,724
Medical advances have
created new options

472
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,508
to solve the unspeakable
pain of infertility.

473
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:19,161
Are we going to turn the
clock of freedom back now,

474
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,185
reducing these choices?

475
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,964
Are we going to
limit women's rights

476
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:23,708
out of on an irrational
fear of the unknown?

477
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:38,705
Okay, I'll see you
guys later, okay.

478
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,777
Hey, are you okay?

479
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,012
I'm fine.

480
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,615
Keith almost
showed real humanity

481
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:49,982
and sent out a search party.

482
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,285
I had some water, I'm okay.

483
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,286
Okay.

484
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:56,988
Okay.

485
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,058
So, it's all good?

486
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,962
Fine, I freaked.

487
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,130
Big time.

488
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,066
I'm not in this
league, in your league.

489
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,968
I've only been in one
national tournament.

490
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,237
I went one and three,
total disaster.

491
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:12,872
I'm only in this
lab because of Nick,

492
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:14,106
and I'm holding him back.

493
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,709
So, that's it, end of story?

494
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:19,078
What?

495
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,956
You wouldn't be here
if you coach didn't think

496
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
you had it in you.

497
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,316
You're here to learn, right?

498
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,053
All right.

499
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:29,889
Show me what you got.

500
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,190
Um, okay.

501
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,127
Uh, new government spending
will trigger automatic cuts,

502
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,231
Washington Post, July 8, 1986.

503
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,009
The Congressional Budget
Office reports today

504
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,344
that any additional
federal spending

505
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:43,035
- will trigger-
- Wait.

506
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,036
That's from today.

507
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,638
Where'd you get that?

508
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:46,738
Library.

509
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,075
That's a great card.

510
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:50,418
You can use that against
any affirmative case

511
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,911
linked to the disad.

512
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:53,011
- I know.

513
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,014
Um...

514
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:56,315
Senators Phil Gramm and Warren
Rudman said that they would...

515
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:57,816
Wait, stop, stop.

516
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,284
Great cards aren't everything,

517
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,129
although I do want
a copy of that one.

518
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,989
What's in-between?

519
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,323
Uh, nothing.

520
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,858
To find the connective tissue,

521
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,827
the words that link
the evidence together,

522
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:09,361
weave the argument,
tell a story.

523
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,030
But...

524
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,132
You can't plan
that ahead of time.

525
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,801
Exactly.

526
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,378
You have to do it on the
fly, different every time.

527
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:18,738
Right, it's all improvised,

528
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:20,372
conditioned on
what comes before.

529
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,075
And that's when I panic.

530
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,145
I was terrified too.

531
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:28,948
Once, I think.

532
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,117
When I first started.

533
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:33,986
How did you get over it?

534
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:36,889
Just have to let
go of everything.

535
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:40,659
Be in the moment,
get a flow, a rhythm.

536
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:43,129
It's like, um...

537
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,939
It's like music.

538
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,440
This is ridiculous.

539
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,843
Do you want my help?

540
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:58,177
Yeah.

541
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,412
♫ How badly

542
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:03,114
Very badly.

543
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,917
Then sing it.

544
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,755
♫ Sing to me about the deficit

545
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,394
♫ New government spending

546
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:18,731
♫ New government spending

547
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:20,032
♫ Will trigger

548
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,368
♫ Will trigger

549
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:26,005
♫ Automatic budget cuts

550
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:30,342
♫ Says the Congressional
Budget Office

551
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,812
♫ Earlier today

552
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,882
I think you're getting it.

553
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:37,183
Oh my God.

554
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:39,085
I urge you to vote affirmative.

555
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:40,352
As Hickman in '85 concludes,

556
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,865
early investment in
education reduces inequality

557
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,857
in both the short and long-term.

558
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,027
Not bad,

559
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,247
and you used your full eight
minutes without stopping.

560
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,363
Who's next?

561
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:53,866
A word Mr. Stacen.

562
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:01,974
This is a release form

563
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,443
and an envelope with a stamp.

564
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,245
Take it, seal it,

565
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,014
address it to your parents.

566
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:11,050
Instruct them to mail
it back in one week.

567
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,019
When these things
are accomplished,

568
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,454
you will be
interviewed by CZN News

569
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,223
regarding your prowess.

570
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,793
I don't think I need to tell
you how important this is.

571
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:27,266
A lazy Louisiana summer

572
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,268
was passing outside debate camp,

573
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:32,304
but we were working so
hard we barely noticed.

574
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:35,141
I still don't think
we have enough evidence here.

575
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:40,012
Do you have the binders Miles
left behind from last year?

576
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,481
Some are still in the car.

577
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,116
So get the keys.

578
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,922
Where are you two going?

579
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,792
We'll be right back.

580
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:58,064
I didn't think of it
before, but it fits.

581
00:29:58,164 --> 00:29:59,641
Miles thought I was
a crappy researcher.

582
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:01,133
It's good stuff.

583
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,502
That means we're
done for tonight.

584
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,106
I'm hungry.

585
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,361
Come on.

586
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,102
Come on.

587
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:37,245
Wait. If somebody
steals the car...

588
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,971
It'll be fine.

589
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,040
Not a very convincing argument.

590
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,535
- We should go.
- Not yet.

591
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,103
Assuming my car is still there.

592
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,204
Not yet.

593
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,540
Nick won that debate.

594
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,409
We stayed out that night
'til the sun came up

595
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,245
over the river.

596
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:21,056
Did you know they're
turning the World's Fair site

597
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,381
into a mall?

598
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,983
Yeah.

599
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,517
Did you go?

600
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,519
To the World's Fair?

601
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,222
Yeah, I don't
remember that much.

602
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,358
We went.

603
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,094
Me and my mom and my sister.

604
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:38,630
My mom just had to see
the Vatican exhibit.

605
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,969
Spent the whole day looking at
jeweled chalices and crosses.

606
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,937
We came back the same night.

607
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,039
We pull in.

608
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,109
My dad's truck is
in the driveway.

609
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:57,016
He's sitting there
under the carport

610
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:59,351
in a folding chair
having a beer.

611
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,054
Some explosion
shut the rig down,

612
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,922
and he was home early.

613
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:05,557
You weren't suppose to go?

614
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:08,160
I don't know.

615
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:11,530
Who knows what he really wants?

616
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:17,503
My mom, she was just frozen
in place, wouldn't move.

617
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,306
I mean, he didn't know
where we'd been, but...

618
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:23,275
There was nothing wrong with it.

619
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,179
We didn't do anything wrong.

620
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,283
I just opened the door.

621
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:34,020
Must have broken the
spell or something.

622
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:38,490
My mom just fixed her hair,

623
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,028
grabbed her pocketbook and
started towards him apologizing.

624
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:45,464
I just got on my
bike and I rode off.

625
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:51,103
Do you ever...

626
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,739
wish you had a different family?

627
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,307
I do.

628
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:57,676
Sometimes.

629
00:32:57,776 --> 00:33:01,447
I mean, my situation
is not like yours.

630
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:04,750
But...

631
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,455
I just feel like I
don't belong there.

632
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,492
Maybe I never have.

633
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,063
'Cause they don't get debate?

634
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:20,032
Because they don't get me.

635
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,272
Yeah, I guess we
are kinda freaks, huh?

636
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:33,512
♫ I didn't care

637
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:39,451
♫ I was alone

638
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:43,389
♫ Along for the ride

639
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:46,024
♫ Snuck out at midnight

640
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,593
♫ Came back at

00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,562
♫ Dawn's early light

♫ I wouldn't have
changed a thing ♫

643
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,468
I'm gonna go get some coffee.

644
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,371
Yeah, no, yeah, sure.

645
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:01,573
Yeah, I'll see you later.

646
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:10,182
♫ I wouldn't have
changed a thing ♫

647
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:11,150
Hey, Megan.

648
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,619
♫ I was a volunteer

649
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:18,157
♫ Along for the ride

650
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:26,274
Inequality is a
temporary feature

651
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:27,542
in a growing and
vibrant economy.

652
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,600
Citation?

653
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,536
Council of Economic
Advisors, '82.

654
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,680
No, you can see that that
study was fought in cross ex.

655
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,206
Now that claim is unsupported.

656
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,284
The preponderance of evidence
suggested in this round

657
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,610
shows that extreme income
inequality is a feature...

658
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,811
Temporary feature.

659
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,114
Would you please let me finish?

660
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:44,416
I feel something slipping here.

661
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,385
Rosa, next please.

662
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,527
Opportunities
are not evenly distributed

663
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:56,762
in this country.

664
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:59,143
A child born into a lower
economic ground has no chance to

665
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:02,012
change their life without
federal investment in education.

666
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,272
Amy, my brother, Dylan

667
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:07,639
Hello.

668
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,217
He's in town
doing research for a movie.

669
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,177
Well, what a coincidence.

670
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:13,645
Rosa, let me introduce you to,

671
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,290
well, you probably
already know Susan Levine?

672
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:17,149
She's an up and coming
producer at CZN News.

673
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:18,717
No, we haven't met.

674
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,752
Rosa is the top
debater at Stuyvesant.

675
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,821
She's also Nick
Stacen's debate partner

676
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,156
here at the institute.

677
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,656
I've actually heard
a lot about you.

678
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:27,469
I would love to interview
your father some time.

679
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:28,736
I'm a great admirer of his work.

680
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,840
I will be sure to tell him.

681
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:31,129
Please do.

682
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,664
His Kennedy film is genius.

683
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,333
Ah, my brother, Dylan.

684
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,735
Well, you two probably
went to Stuyvesant together.

685
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,238
No, I think I
would remember you.

686
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:40,406
Ready?

687
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,219
Tell me again why Susan is here.

688
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,287
Due diligence.

689
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:57,832
Tarrity sent her to
determine whether the story

690
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:59,536
that we've been pitching
matches the facts.

691
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,145
If she agrees, then they
send an on-air correspondent.

692
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,405
But if someone else
wins the tournament,

693
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:04,439
then they get on the news.

694
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:06,164
No, Nick's the story.

695
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:08,300
If some overprivileged
prep school kid wins,

696
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,735
then there's no story.

697
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,570
Nick feeds this log cabin myth

698
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,938
of national greatness,

699
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:15,907
and Tarrity gets to
relive his New York rise.

700
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,910
Besides, being on the
news is good for you.

701
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,247
Tarrity's gonna be
on the national news

702
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:23,849
telling every coach and
judge in the country

703
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:26,852
that Nick is destined to
be the national champion.

704
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:28,754
If he does well
in the interview,

705
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,557
then the judges will want to
make that dream a reality.

706
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,559
The judges aren't gonna cheat.

707
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:34,793
It's not cheating.

708
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:35,893
It's politics.

709
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,263
It's PR.

710
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:39,431
Look, everyone's
good at that level.

711
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,899
And short from a major meltdown,

712
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,577
the top rounds at the
national tournament

713
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:43,869
are determined in millimeters.

714
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,343
If Nick's the star, then he
gets more of the close calls.

715
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,575
I don't know.

716
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,477
You don't know what?

717
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,379
What, does this ruin
some idealistic view

718
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:55,213
of the news industry for you?

719
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,281
Or maybe it ruins
the idea of debate

720
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,885
as a noble pursuit of knowledge.

721
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:15,901
Look, you're a good researcher,

722
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,869
and you're improving
as a speaker.

723
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,871
You're not gonna determine
whether Nick wins

724
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,507
or loses this year

725
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:24,410
That almost sounded
like an apology.

726
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,877
I'm doing you a favor.

727
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,013
You want to make it
in the larger world?

728
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,881
How do you get there?

729
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:30,981
I work hard.

730
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,584
Then maybe someone will notice?

731
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:33,919
That's a fairy tale.

732
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,454
There's no national merit exam

733
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:37,989
that gives everybody
what they deserve.

734
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,794
You wanna be a New York
artist or an intellectual?

735
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,029
There's your entrance exam.

736
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:46,298
You wanna be a New
York news producer?

737
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,933
There's your entrance exam.

738
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,111
But at some point, you are
going to have to determine

739
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,937
where you belong.

740
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:55,006
Winners set the agenda.

741
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,577
Losers get the scraps.

742
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,585
Oh Keith, could you
meet up with my crew

743
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,854
at the library, show
them around campus?

744
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,289
I'd love to get some B-roll
before we lose the light.

745
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,424
Absolutely.

746
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,292
And, Rosa, if you've
got some time,

747
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:15,837
I'd love to meet some
of the other folks

748
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,472
from the lab to determine
who to interview tomorrow.

749
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:18,564
Sure.

750
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,007
Hey, um, can I get
to Delphine Street

751
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,833
with public transportation?

752
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,002
Not any time soon.

753
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,773
I don't suppose I could
impose on you for another ride?

754
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:38,984
Sorry to drag you out again.

755
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,919
Imagine you have work to do.

756
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:41,853
It's okay.

757
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,456
I kinda like being
the one with a car.

758
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:46,892
Yeah, I never learned to drive.

759
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,861
Ironic, though, my gramps
drove a cab for 10 years

760
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,863
when he first got here.

761
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:55,367
Not here here, like
New York here, America.

762
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,568
Yeah.

763
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,839
Rosa said you're
from New Orleans?

764
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:03,341
About two hours west.

765
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:05,577
New Orleans is the
big city to us.

766
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,945
Wait, the Cajun part?

767
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,346
Yeah.

768
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:09,781
That's great.

769
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,025
No, that's actually
related to the thing

770
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,419
with this guy, Mark,
with why I'm here.

771
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,887
Uh, Mark grew up in New
York but got obsessed

772
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:17,723
with Louisiana ritz music.

773
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:19,783
Came to Jazz Festival one
year and had this, like,

774
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,527
religious, mystical experience

775
00:39:21,627 --> 00:39:23,962
listening to Gatemouth
Brown play blues guitar.

776
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,731
I mean, you probably
know all about this.

777
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:27,966
Look, your sister
already gave me a hard time

778
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,901
for only listening to Top 40.

779
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,703
Why would I tell you
what music to like?

780
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:32,838
I'm just...

781
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:35,474
But, look, I mean you're,

782
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:38,477
you're here at the
home of jazz and blues.

783
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:40,779
It's an iconic American story.

784
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,949
That's what I wanna
say in my movie.

785
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,049
You make movies?

786
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,152
Sure, little documentaries.

787
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,587
Like my dad.

788
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,589
A movie about a
guy who falls in love

789
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:51,923
with Louisiana music.

790
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,425
More than that.

791
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:54,960
Story of this New York kid

792
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,929
who wakes up one day
and has an epiphany

793
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,998
and realizes he's been
born in the wrong culture,

794
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,433
switched at birth, right?

795
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,461
So he moves to New Orleans
to set things straight.

796
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:05,671
That's him.

797
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,038
Uh, hey.

798
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:09,040
Hang out with me.

799
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,409
Let's hear his story.

800
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,090
Opportunities are not evenly
distributed in this country.

801
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:18,092
A child born into a lower
economic ground has no chance to

802
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,027
change their life without
federal investment in education

803
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,891
or federal regulation of
educational standards.

804
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,498
As the University of Iowa City
shows, there's significant...

805
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:24,522
Perfect.

806
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,492
You don't need my scrutiny.

807
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:27,935
Well, if you can
spare someone, Keith,

808
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,795
I could use a volunteer
to help with the crews

809
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:31,429
while we set up
for the interviews.

810
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:33,197
Anyone?

811
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:34,965
Great.

812
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,135
So forget about me.

813
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:38,904
Look directly into the camera.

814
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,539
Rodney's gonna
adjust the lights.

815
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,741
It just helps to have
a body in the chair.

816
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,614
Are you interested in news?

817
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:50,081
As a job?

818
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,550
As a career.

819
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,520
You said travel's the
best part of your job.

820
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,087
And you research stories, right?

821
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,923
I'm good at that.

822
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:59,658
Good.

823
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:00,759
Okay.

824
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,694
Um, do you know anyone?

825
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,030
Friends of your parents
or other relatives,

826
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,899
someone who could help you
with a summer job, maybe?

827
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:08,867
Oh, you know what?
Look this way.

828
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,136
We're just gonna move
the camera, okay?

829
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:14,506
And we're gonna get a level now,

830
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:16,508
so I just want you to
speak slowly and clearly

831
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:17,909
into the microphone.

832
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:19,244
Uh, what should I say?

833
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:21,513
Oh, anything, it's just a test.

834
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:29,888
I'm sorry, I'm screwing this up.

835
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,623
No, wait. Hey, hey, hey,

836
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:33,158
Anything at all, okay?

837
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,094
Who are you?

838
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,998
I'm Amy Hartington.

839
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,803
I live in a small town
in south Louisiana.

840
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:46,237
I'm a debater.

841
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:50,008
And what are
your plans for the future?

842
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,212
You want me to
say that out loud?

843
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,581
On camera?

844
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:56,782
I do.

845
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:58,049
Keep talking.

846
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:03,088
I wanna win a national
championship with my partner.

847
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,924
I wanna debate in college

848
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,726
in a big city.

849
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:11,863
I wanna travel everywhere
and see the whole world.

850
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:14,633
I want the best parts
of debate to never end.

851
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:17,936
One minute it's boiling hot.

852
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,905
Then it's really cold.

853
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:21,907
The rain, the mud, the humidity.

854
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:23,709
How do you people live here?

855
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:25,186
You'll escape to
Dartmouth next week

856
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,313
for your next camp, and this
will all be a bad dream.

857
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:29,848
Come with me.

858
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:33,619
Just the person I'm looking for.

859
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:36,054
Your partner's still
playing hide and seek.

860
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,624
Adam clearly asked
Nick to get his parents

861
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:41,893
to sign the release forms
for the people at CZN News.

862
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:43,128
Nick hasn't done so.

863
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,763
So?

864
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:48,166
So, Adam communicated
directly to Nick's parents

865
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,101
and sent the forms to them.

866
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:52,871
He'll be contacting
Nick's dad tonight.

867
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:56,074
So if you see Nick, be sure
to convey that information.

868
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:00,612
I really don't
understand why this matters

869
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:01,880
so much to Adam.

870
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,349
Ego, he's a dictator
in his own program.

871
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:05,851
Worse than he is here.

872
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:07,085
My brother bailed.

873
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:09,020
Dylan was supposed
to debate for him?

874
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,022
He did for six months,

875
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,758
but he was miserable.

876
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:14,192
Life's too short.

877
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:16,728
Nick needs a
scholarship to anywhere.

878
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:18,039
Nick can't burn too many bridges

879
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:20,031
if he needs a
debate scholarship.

880
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:22,167
Adam's wired with all
the good college coaches.

881
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,368
Would you talk to him?

882
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:25,036
Why are you always
looking out for him?

883
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:27,605
He shouldn't be your problem.

884
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:30,075
You're only his partner
for this camp tournament.

885
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,777
He's my partner all year.

886
00:43:31,877 --> 00:43:33,178
We win or lose together.

887
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,913
Find another partner.

888
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:38,016
Then I won't get invited to
the best national tournaments.

889
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,918
You're selling yourself short.

890
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:50,929
Mexico.

891
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:55,934
Um, Mexico as new
affirmative case,

892
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,135
as a new counter plan?

893
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,037
As a destination.

894
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,940
Sure, I'd love to
go sometime, but...

895
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:02,908
Now.

896
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:04,151
The best part is we can drive.

897
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:06,244
You can drop me
off in Mexico City.

898
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:07,946
Drop you off?

899
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:09,647
I mean, you can
stay if you want, too.

900
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:11,683
But, um, I mean, you
love debate, right?

901
00:44:11,783 --> 00:44:12,860
Just because I'm done
with it doesn't mean

902
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:14,119
you have to quit.

903
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,829
Keith says this
interview will be good for you.

904
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:21,960
Keith doesn't know my father.

905
00:44:22,928 --> 00:44:25,130
I spend half of my life
covering for things

906
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,899
that might possibly
piss the man off.

907
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,176
Adam shouldn't have
gone behind my back

908
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,802
and called him.

909
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:34,172
A scholarship from Adam gets
you away from your father.

910
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:35,373
Forever, if you want.

911
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:36,517
You're not gonna
help me, are you?

912
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,876
Help you leave?

913
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:39,077
No.

914
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,979
Nick, wait.

915
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:44,682
Look, I'm not gonna pretend
to understand your father.

916
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:46,684
But don't run away.

917
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:47,886
We can call Annie.

918
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:49,130
There's got to be
another solution

919
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:51,189
we're not thinking
of on our own.

920
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:54,459
I don't like it.

921
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:55,927
Tarrity's not gonna like it.

922
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,363
Well, it will get you
what you want, Adam.

923
00:44:58,463 --> 00:44:59,798
We're all clear here,

924
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:01,800
but I've made no guarantees.

925
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:05,036
All right, well, I'm
gonna see you next week.

926
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:15,814
Hey, what did you hear?

927
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:18,083
Nothing.

928
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:20,051
Oh, you can put
the pieces together.

929
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:21,719
What did you surmise?

930
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,821
This is a test?

931
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,081
Everything's a test, my dear,

932
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:26,091
one way or another.

933
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:28,894
We have a deal,
a precarious one,

934
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:31,096
but his dad will
sign the release form

935
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:33,965
if CZN agrees to
interview him as well.

936
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,302
Nick's dad wants to be on TV?

937
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,504
He says that he spent
the best years of his life

938
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:41,940
sacrificing for his son

939
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,109
and that he deserves
some of the glory.

940
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:46,111
Nick's not gonna
be happy with that.

941
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:47,212
I know.

942
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,048
Sign of a good compromise,
no one is happy.

943
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:51,883
I thought adults
were more reasonable.

944
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:54,820
Now you know.

945
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,387
All right, I'll
see you next week.

946
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:03,862
Amy.

947
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:06,131
Still wanna learn about
the news business?

948
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:07,866
I guess.

949
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,043
Well, help me out
with something, okay?

950
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,036
We'll call it an internship.

951
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:12,856
I'll write you a nice
recommendation letter.

952
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,274
I appreciate it.

953
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:18,109
I just, uh, didn't really want

954
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,145
anyone else to know, you know?

955
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:22,948
I actually don't know
anything about debate.

956
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:23,849
The rules?

957
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,469
Yeah, I may have
led my boss to believe

958
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:28,062
that I had some sort of
background familiarity.

959
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:28,954
Okay.

960
00:46:29,054 --> 00:46:30,321
Yeah, I bluffed.

961
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:31,923
Just give me the basics.

962
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:33,224
This is the resolution,

963
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:35,393
the topic we debate all year.

964
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:38,563
At each tournament, there
are four preliminary rounds.

965
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:40,531
In one round, you
argue the affirmative,

966
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,101
often a case, a
government policy

967
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:44,870
that upholds the resolution.

968
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,005
In the next round, you
take the negative position,

969
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:48,806
arguing against the resolution.

970
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:50,451
Each person gives an
eight minute speech,

971
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,978
then is cross-examined by
someone on the opposite team.

972
00:46:53,078 --> 00:46:55,246
Then, each person gives
a four minute rebuttal.

973
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:56,557
The judge examines the arguments

974
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:58,116
against a set of standards

975
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:00,018
and then decides
who wins the round.

976
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:02,358
The team with the best records
advances to quarter finals

977
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,257
then semi-finals until only
two best teams are left

978
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:09,094
competing against one
another in the final round.

979
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:10,561
Only one team can win.

980
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:12,931
Perfect.

981
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,933
That's exactly what we needed.

982
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:17,602
That was fun.

983
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:20,005
Your parents are
gonna be so proud of you

984
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:21,239
when they see you on TV.

985
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,209
Thank you for your cooperation
with the permission form.

986
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:25,944
So that's it?

987
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:27,688
You know, I just have to get
the final interview with Nick

988
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:30,215
and then we'll edit the
package for tonight's news.

989
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:31,955
The affirmative team's
absolutely correct.

990
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,394
We can see that programs
for reducing inequality

991
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:35,086
are necessary,
even crucial for...

992
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:38,089
Debate camp's
final tournament had arrived.

993
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:41,159
Everyone was going to be
there, you, Nick's parents.

994
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:43,328
It was Nick's moment to shine

995
00:47:43,428 --> 00:47:46,397
for the news cameras
and for his dad.

996
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:48,332
Almost done?

997
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,035
Maybe 20 minutes.

998
00:47:50,135 --> 00:47:52,070
Oh my God, watch and learn, kid.

999
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,572
Mr. Tarrity, what a surprise.

1000
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:56,183
Well, we're starting
off the road show early,

1001
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,567
pumping up the
affiliates' ratings.

1002
00:47:57,642 --> 00:47:59,562
Oh, you're gonna anchor
from New Orleans tonight?

1003
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,291
From the local news room.
Everything's under control.

1004
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,491
But I was just telling my
old friend, Adam, here,

1005
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:06,985
how much I miss real reporting
out side the New York bubble,

1006
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,329
and I hear there's
one more interview

1007
00:48:08,353 --> 00:48:09,530
to get for tonight,
is that right?

1008
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,154
Yeah, Michael Sullivan
is in the ballroom

1009
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:13,091
- just getting ready.
- Oh, great.

1010
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:17,095
Sully, outta my chair son.

1011
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,264
I'm the field
correspondent today.

1012
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:21,366
Amy, I've got
Nick's parents here.

1013
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:23,068
Are you taking
them in the finals?

1014
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:25,103
That's what I'm
trying to decide.

1015
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:27,005
Hey, Bill Tarrity.

1016
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:27,672
Yes.

1017
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:29,174
Noland Stacen.

1018
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:30,575
We're supposed to talk.

1019
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:32,010
Well, if I had
words with everyone

1020
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,145
who wanted a bit of my time,

1021
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,981
we'd be here for
hours, wouldn't we?

1022
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:37,224
Is it final rebuttals tonight?

1023
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:37,983
Yeah.

1024
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:39,150
Okay.

1025
00:48:39,484 --> 00:48:41,119
Here goes nothing.

1026
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:43,097
The affirmative team has
not defeated our counter plan.

1027
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:44,441
State control is
clearly superior,

1028
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:46,291
Osborne '82 evidence.

1029
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:47,592
Local control allows state.

1030
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:49,527
Go to the counter plan next.

1031
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:50,962
You have time, Nick.

1032
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:52,197
Hit everything.

1033
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:54,432
To experiment and
find novel solutions.

1034
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,601
On their A, uniform
federal standards,

1035
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:58,669
pull across the O'Conner card.

1036
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:04,042
They haven't even touched it.

1037
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,712
Judges, this is not
a difficult decision.

1038
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:11,016
The preponderance of
evidence is on our side.

1039
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:14,119
To solve for inequality,
you must vote negative.

1040
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:23,127
Well done, Nick.

1041
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:24,805
So I want you to tell us
about the final round,

1042
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,740
and then we'll take you
in here for the interview.

1043
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:28,066
Nick, come here.

1044
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,967
Nick, I'd like you
to meet Mr. Tarrity.

1045
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:31,236
Son, I'm talking to you.

1046
00:49:33,538 --> 00:49:35,540
You are ungrateful.

1047
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:38,476
What's going on over there?

1048
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:39,410
Who is that?

1049
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,510
Is that his dad?

1050
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:42,447
What's he doing?

1051
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:43,547
This is a school.

1052
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,992
After his father
burned the permission slip,

1053
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:57,062
embarrassing him in
front of everyone,

1054
00:49:57,162 --> 00:49:58,329
Nick stormed out.

1055
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,131
The look on his
face made me think

1056
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,167
he might be going for good.

1057
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:09,207
I assume you can
get this to Nick?

1058
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,342
If I see him again.

1059
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:14,045
Somehow you'll survive.

1060
00:50:14,145 --> 00:50:16,181
I can't do debate without Nick.

1061
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:18,216
It's a team activity.

1062
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:27,557
Whoa, whoa, hey.

1063
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,130
There you go.

1064
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:37,301
It's okay.

1065
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:42,173
You have to let
go soon, darling.

1066
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:44,575
Doctor says it's
time for hospice.

1067
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:05,272
We're leaving in a few minutes.

1068
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:06,664
Go change.

1069
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,135
You've completely
forgotten, haven't you?

1070
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:12,137
Your cousin Kathy's wedding.

1071
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:15,173
Honestly, Amy, I don't know
where your head is sometimes.

1072
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:16,741
Great, have a good time.

1073
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,276
Don't sass me, young lady.

1074
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:20,545
Apologize to your mother.

1075
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:22,113
You don't even
know what happened.

1076
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:23,213
Don't you debate with me.

1077
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:25,348
That kinda talk
doesn't belong here.

1078
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:30,187
I'm sorry.

1079
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:31,789
That's better.

1080
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:34,825
I, uh, wanna show this to you.

1081
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:40,131
Oh, sweetheart, the
VCR's not even hooked up.

1082
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:44,269
It's my piece on the news
where I explain debate.

1083
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:47,772
I know you didn't see it
when it was on last night.

1084
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,241
Well, Shane had a baseball game.

1085
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:51,209
He got three hits.

1086
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:53,144
Let's go Charlene.

1087
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:54,812
We're going to be late.

1088
00:51:54,912 --> 00:51:56,481
Amy, please, go get changed.

1089
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:57,624
You know how Father Mouton gets

1090
00:51:57,648 --> 00:51:59,684
when people walk into mass late.

1091
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,387
Go, I'll meet you at the church.

1092
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:03,621
Soon.

1093
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:04,889
10 minutes, I have my car.

1094
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,658
Okay, well, I put a nice
dress on the bed for ya.

1095
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,127
Wear a slip.

1096
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:12,763
Of course.

1097
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:36,754
Coming.

1098
00:52:38,423 --> 00:52:41,459
Oh, what in the world are
you doing here this late?

1099
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:43,428
I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

1100
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:46,231
Well, I was just
gonna go to bed.

1101
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,166
I could just keep
driving, you know,

1102
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:51,902
head west, not stop
'til I hit the Pacific.

1103
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:53,938
Come on in.

1104
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:57,342
Oh, honey, Nick will be back.

1105
00:52:58,843 --> 00:52:59,843
How do you know?

1106
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:00,877
I don't know.

1107
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:02,179
I trust.

1108
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,615
It's highly
preferable to despair.

1109
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,819
There's something else.

1110
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,822
It's not about debate.

1111
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:13,924
Well, I got other skills.

1112
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:24,802
Would you open this for me?

1113
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,738
Is it a particularly
fortified envelope?

1114
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:28,939
Booby trapped somehow?

1115
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,508
Please.

1116
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:32,910
It's from the agency
that did my adoption.

1117
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,946
Oh, I always assumed
you had a closed adoption.

1118
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,649
I did. I've always known.

1119
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:40,918
We just don't talk about it.

1120
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,454
Well, that's a lot to hold in.

1121
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:44,855
Just read it for me.

1122
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,431
All right, well.

1123
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,933
There's a lot of legal jargon.

1124
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,836
"State laws are under review."

1125
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:00,237
Okay.

1126
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:03,641
"The adoption
records remain sealed,

1127
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,644
"but the agency
does feel obligated"

1128
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,280
"to reveal certain
communications."

1129
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,915
Bottom line, please.

1130
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:15,986
Three years ago,
your birth mother,

1131
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,423
she attempted to make
contact with you.

1132
00:54:18,523 --> 00:54:20,791
She had a friend
call the agency.

1133
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:22,727
That friend's name
and number are here.

1134
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:23,961
No, I can't.

1135
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:29,700
Where is she?

1136
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,336
New York, Brooklyn.

1137
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,871
That's a good distance.

1138
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,874
Listen, Amy.

1139
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:43,047
You have to feel pain
before you can let it go.

1140
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:48,018
You know, when my son died...

1141
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,520
Wait. What?

1142
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,655
When?

1143
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:52,022
It happened a long time ago.

1144
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,958
It was a stupid accident.

1145
00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:55,760
The details aren't important,

1146
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,496
but for a very long time,

1147
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,833
I didn't handle
the loss very well.

1148
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:04,435
I may have went
to work every day.

1149
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:06,070
I went through all the motions,

1150
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,872
but I wasn't really there.

1151
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,740
I was a ghost.

1152
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,576
And then one spring,

1153
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:13,811
I think it was in
a state tournament,

1154
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:16,013
I got in a fight with
one of the other coaches.

1155
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:18,616
Something about the
proper allocation

1156
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:21,386
of judges for the finals,
I don't even remember,

1157
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:25,723
but I was absolutely outraged.

1158
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,825
I screamed at him

1159
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:30,995
and anyone else who had the
misfortune of being there.

1160
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:33,831
And I threw a chair
clear across the room.

1161
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:34,732
Honestly?

1162
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,534
Oh, yeah. He ducked.

1163
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:38,869
And then I left.

1164
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:40,471
I disappeared without a word.

1165
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:42,740
And I stayed gone
for almost a year.

1166
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,575
Roy must have been frantic.

1167
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:46,711
You didn't care?

1168
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:47,512
Not really.

1169
00:55:47,612 --> 00:55:48,746
I went to Europe.

1170
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:52,417
I went to Spain and
France and Italy.

1171
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:53,150
I'd never been.

1172
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,786
I blew through my life savings.

1173
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:57,121
This isn't a parable.

1174
00:55:58,623 --> 00:56:01,492
I wound up in Valencia
that next spring.

1175
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:03,994
They got a wonderful
festival there.

1176
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,096
It's called the Falles.

1177
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,834
It's a bit like Mardi Gras,
the whole town celebrates.

1178
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:12,570
They build these gigantic
figures out of wood

1179
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:15,606
and paper mache, animals,
mythical creatures,

1180
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,374
anything you can imagine.

1181
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:18,943
They parade them
through the town,

1182
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:22,112
and on the last night
everyone gathers,

1183
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,883
and they set each
masterpiece aflame.

1184
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,054
They set those spirits free.

1185
00:56:31,656 --> 00:56:33,891
And these fires burn all night.

1186
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:35,926
And there's music and dancing

1187
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:38,062
and there's some crying.

1188
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:41,932
And then the next day, they
start building all over again.

1189
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:43,501
I'd like to see it some time.

1190
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:45,041
We should go
together. I'd like that.

1191
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,537
Yeah.

1192
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:49,474
But something happened
to me that night.

1193
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:50,908
I came back here the next week,

1194
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,176
and I started coaching again.

1195
00:56:52,276 --> 00:56:52,977
Back to normal?

1196
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:54,077
No.

1197
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:00,718
But I found a way to move on,

1198
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:04,655
to remember who I was
and why I was here.

1199
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,056
That was enough.

1200
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:08,593
Three years later, they
had the World's Fair

1201
00:57:08,693 --> 00:57:10,127
here in New Orleans,

1202
00:57:10,227 --> 00:57:12,830
and I bought a
paper mache globe.

1203
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,741
You know, it was just a
cheap souvenir, really,

1204
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:17,001
but it reminded
me of the Falles.

1205
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:18,803
Did you burn it?

1206
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:21,572
No, it's the one I
have in my classroom.

1207
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,808
You know what, honey?

1208
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:25,075
You'd better get home.

1209
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,478
We've got a big
year ahead of us.

1210
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,948
I didn't
hear another word from Nick

1211
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:34,752
all summer until he walked back
in the first day of school.

1212
00:57:34,852 --> 00:57:36,821
I was so relieved,

1213
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:39,023
and things went back
to normal, mostly.

1214
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,959
You were there.

1215
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:45,830
It was the ordinary routine
of school and tournaments.

1216
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,899
We were winning, having fun.

1217
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:51,035
Nick's dad was away.

1218
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:52,570
It was almost time
for graduation,

1219
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,772
and Nick and I were so excited

1220
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:56,741
for nationals in New York.

1221
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,985
Unbelievable.

1222
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:10,154
That bad, huh?

1223
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:11,488
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1224
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:12,890
The school board is requesting

1225
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,059
half of everyone's
remaining budget

1226
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:17,828
so that the football stadium
can be built in time.

1227
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:19,906
But the rest of this year's
budget covers nationals.

1228
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:22,499
Yeah. Can you give me
a minute, please, guys?

1229
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,600
I need you to clear out.

1230
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:24,935
Base classroom is empty.

1231
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:27,137
I need to talk to Amy
alone as the team captain.

1232
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:29,640
We'll go to New York alone?

1233
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,642
I don't see that
there's any other way.

1234
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:34,511
I mean, if I don't go,
that's an extra $1000.

1235
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:36,513
And then if you find
a place to stay...

1236
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:37,715
I'll call Rosa tonight.

1237
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:39,684
Okay, that's another 500.

1238
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:41,952
Oh my God, this is crazy.

1239
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:44,889
I cannot believe
they are forcing us

1240
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:47,057
into this position when
you guys have worked

1241
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:48,826
so hard all year.

1242
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,728
A football?

1243
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:51,972
I mean, you know,
it doesn't matter

1244
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:53,373
how many championships
we win as long,

1245
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:55,733
okay, I'm sorry.

1246
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,168
All right, solutions. We
got to focus on solutions.

1247
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,070
Uh, permission slips.

1248
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:00,738
We got to do this by the book.

1249
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:02,072
Your parents have to sign,

1250
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:04,041
and Nick's parents have to sign.

1251
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,142
Of course.

1252
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:07,176
Okay.

1253
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:09,614
This might work.

1254
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:17,287
It was a scramble,

1255
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,989
but the moment we
arrived to New York

1256
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:21,792
for the championship
tournament mad it all worth it.

1257
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:26,096
Hey, so do you two
have everything you need?

1258
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:27,932
We're taking the train
downtown to my place.

1259
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:29,834
- Think so.
- Yeah. we're all good.

1260
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:31,602
- You nervous?
- Should I be?

1261
00:59:31,702 --> 00:59:33,938
If you still wanna
debate for Adam next year.

1262
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:35,115
You were wait listed, right?

1263
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:35,940
Yep.

1264
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,274
But he can't go without a

1265
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:38,208
scholarship.

1266
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:39,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1267
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:40,177
You don't have to
spill that every time.

1268
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:42,146
So, breaking news,

1269
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:43,648
Ashoke from Bronc Science

1270
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:46,050
just turned Adam down
in favor of Stanford.

1271
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,584
One slot remaining.

1272
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:48,886
Intriguing.

1273
00:59:48,986 --> 00:59:50,788
So you're not
changing your mind?

1274
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:52,122
About debating in college?

1275
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:53,323
No way.

1276
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,159
That phase of my life
ends this weekend.

1277
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:56,627
I'm winning here

1278
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:58,963
and leaving debate
in the rearview.

1279
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:01,131
I knew there was some
reason I liked you.

1280
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:02,833
Can we get outta here?

1281
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:08,739
♫ Maybe I should
drop you at your door

1282
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:14,679
♫ Or leave tonight and
vanish up the shore

1283
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:20,685
♫ Anywhere but here

1284
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,989
Make yourselves at home.

1285
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:27,057
Amy, I made you up
the bedroom upstairs

1286
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:29,827
and, Nick, you're on the couch.

1287
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:32,930
This is amazing.

1288
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:37,101
Hey, good, I didn't miss you.

1289
01:00:38,002 --> 01:00:39,236
Let me help you with that.

1290
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:46,176
I should thank your parents.

1291
01:00:46,276 --> 01:00:48,879
They are sailing, I think,

1292
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,380
in the Caymans.

1293
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,181
I don't really keep track.

1294
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,850
Rosa would know.

1295
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:57,922
In summer, you can see the
Fourth of July fireworks

1296
01:00:58,022 --> 01:00:59,223
over the river.

1297
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:01,025
Bring up one of those
plastic kiddie pools,

1298
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:02,659
couple of folding chairs.

1299
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,028
No beach house?

1300
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:06,997
Yeah, on the weekend.

1301
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:10,167
Louisiana doesn't
even have a real beach.

1302
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:11,401
It's all marsh and mud.

1303
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,370
Mississippi gets all the sand.

1304
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:15,906
Born on the
wrong side of the river.

1305
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,274
Something like that.

1306
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:19,143
New York must be
culture shock for you.

1307
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:20,910
No.

1308
01:01:21,145 --> 01:01:23,147
New York's on TV every day,

1309
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:25,215
in the movies and
nearly every book

1310
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:26,683
I've ever read.

1311
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:29,319
Sesame Street's in New
York, for God's sake.

1312
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:32,823
I feel like I've known
New York all my life.

1313
01:01:44,802 --> 01:01:47,037
Is there something wrong
with me coming here tonight?

1314
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:49,940
I wanted to see you.

1315
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,910
I'm sorry, I just have a lot

1316
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:55,112
on my mind for the
tournament tomorrow.

1317
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:58,983
I'm glad you wanted to see me.

1318
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,184
I'm glad.

1319
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:04,755
Whatever happened with
your New Orleans movie?

1320
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:08,258
I don't know, actually.

1321
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:10,127
I'm helping my dad
do some camera work

1322
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:12,062
on one of his projects.

1323
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:12,997
Rosa and I are going
to Greece and Italy

1324
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:14,364
after she graduates.

1325
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,033
This other guy wants
me to make a short

1326
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:18,302
about this classic sailboat
he's restoring up in Maine.

1327
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,104
Lot of possibilities.

1328
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:22,425
I guess I sound like
a privileged jerk.

1329
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:24,074
It's just not my world.

1330
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:26,510
You don't know that.

1331
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:29,780
You don't even know
how different we are.

1332
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,748
What kind of head start you have

1333
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:33,293
over people who don't
grow up like this.

1334
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:34,484
Why is it a competition?

1335
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,953
Nick and I need scholarships

1336
01:02:36,053 --> 01:02:37,421
to get to a good college.

1337
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:40,024
And people like you
start off so far ahead

1338
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:41,391
you don't even have to compete.

1339
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,027
You can make a
little movie or not.

1340
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:44,895
Debate for Adam or not.

1341
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:47,064
Go to Europe or go
slumming in New Orleans.

1342
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:48,332
It's not that easy.

1343
01:02:49,033 --> 01:02:50,267
For anyone.

1344
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:01,879
My whole life
could've been different.

1345
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,051
Another name, hometown, family.

1346
01:03:07,852 --> 01:03:09,153
What do you mean?

1347
01:03:12,857 --> 01:03:14,024
I'm adopted.

1348
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,161
Lots of people are adopted.

1349
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:20,797
No one ever talks about
how it feels on the inside.

1350
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:22,799
If the bureaucrat from
the adoption agency

1351
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,970
had chosen from column
A instead of column B,

1352
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,972
I'd be a different person.

1353
01:03:29,006 --> 01:03:30,941
It's completely random.

1354
01:03:34,578 --> 01:03:36,313
Which way is Brooklyn?

1355
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:39,483
Follow the lights
over the bridge.

1356
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,218
Over the East River.

1357
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:44,054
Last summer, I got a letter.

1358
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:47,057
A woman in Brooklyn claimed

1359
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,994
she knew my birth mother

1360
01:03:50,094 --> 01:03:51,962
and wanted to talk to me.

1361
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:53,062
And?

1362
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,465
I didn't respond.

1363
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:58,435
My coach said I would
do it when I was ready.

1364
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:01,438
Here I am in New
York for three days.

1365
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:02,940
Are you ready?

1366
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:05,876
I don't know.

1367
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:10,080
Maybe after the tournament.

1368
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,016
Debate comes first.

1369
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,006
Yes.

1370
01:04:37,274 --> 01:04:38,575
Mr. Stacen.

1371
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:41,011
Congratulations.

1372
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:42,246
Thank you.

1373
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:45,158
I don't wish to reward
your behavior last summer,

1374
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,293
but I understand there were
extenuating circumstances.

1375
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:48,652
Yes, sir.

1376
01:04:48,752 --> 01:04:50,592
I'm also willing to
consider that you're nearly

1377
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:52,561
a year older and that
you may have matured

1378
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:53,223
into the kind of
young man who could be

1379
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:55,392
a good fit for my squad.

1380
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:59,029
If you advance as far
as finals tomorrow,

1381
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:00,998
I may have a place for you.

1382
01:05:01,098 --> 01:05:02,499
And if I don't?

1383
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:05,369
Debate's not everything, son.

1384
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,241
I want to make sure you have
the key for the apartment.

1385
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:12,542
Uh, yeah.

1386
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,011
Will we see you later?

1387
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:15,471
Actually, my coach
has rooms for us

1388
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:16,613
here at the hotel tonight,

1389
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:18,113
so we can get an
extra hour of sleep

1390
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:19,950
before the early morning rounds.

1391
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,551
So we should go back alone?

1392
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:23,329
Yeah, you remember
how to get there, right?

1393
01:05:23,353 --> 01:05:25,155
Just take the D to West Fourth.

1394
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:26,690
Like we belong here.

1395
01:05:30,294 --> 01:05:31,028
What's this?

1396
01:05:31,128 --> 01:05:32,429
I have no idea.

1397
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:34,369
But you can use the phone
in the coach's lounge

1398
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:36,066
to return their call.

1399
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:39,103
Hello?

1400
01:05:39,203 --> 01:05:40,604
Is Nick with you?

1401
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:41,538
Uh, he's in the lobby.

1402
01:05:41,638 --> 01:05:42,672
We had a great day.

1403
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,408
Four zero in prelims.

1404
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:45,009
That's wonderful.

1405
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:46,576
I'm proud of you both.

1406
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:49,479
All right, Mr. Stacen
is here with me

1407
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:51,481
in Principal Herbert's office.

1408
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:53,984
That sounds bad.

1409
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:56,020
It's very serious.

1410
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,155
Mr. Stacen does not
approve of this trip,

1411
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:00,624
although Nick's mother
signed the permission form.

1412
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:03,193
Mr. Stacen wants
Nick to return home

1413
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:05,229
as soon as possible.

1414
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:07,397
Quarter finals are first
thing in the morning.

1415
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:08,565
I've talked to the airline.

1416
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:10,105
Your tickets are
valid for any flight

1417
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:12,102
before your scheduled return.

1418
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:13,703
Do you have a pen, hun?

1419
01:06:14,538 --> 01:06:17,074
Okay, there are flights at 6am,

1420
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:19,509
9:30...

1421
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:24,281
Wait, we can win
this tournament.

1422
01:06:25,182 --> 01:06:27,051
Where's the compromise?

1423
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:30,354
It's out of my hands.

1424
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:32,422
Everything we worked for.

1425
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:35,259
As soon as
possible, do you understand?

1426
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:37,094
Yes, ma'am.

1427
01:06:39,163 --> 01:06:41,731
Suddenly, I
had my own internal debate.

1428
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:45,135
Was there a way I could break
the rules and still win?

1429
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:46,503
Everything okay?

1430
01:06:47,271 --> 01:06:48,738
Why wouldn't it be?

1431
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,375
Well, I hear you guys
did a good job today.

1432
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:53,143
- Yeah.
- We did.

1433
01:06:54,078 --> 01:06:55,612
I'll be judging
all day tomorrow.

1434
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:57,181
Perhaps I'll see you.

1435
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:00,416
Food?

1436
01:07:01,485 --> 01:07:02,686
Hmm?

1437
01:07:02,786 --> 01:07:04,506
I'm starving, let's
go get something to eat.

1438
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:09,159
You're not gonna let them
mess with you, are you?

1439
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:10,160
What?

1440
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,461
It's what he wants.

1441
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,697
It's what Adam wants,
to sike us out,

1442
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:15,665
prove he was right
about me all along.

1443
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:18,535
Were you paying attention
at all today, Nick?

1444
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:21,305
I'm doing everything I can
to win this tournament.

1445
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:24,141
You don't know everything
that's going on.

1446
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:31,248
And you don't think we
should track this lady down?

1447
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:33,083
Tonight?

1448
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:34,718
You have a round in eight hours

1449
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:36,653
in a tournament that
can change everything,

1450
01:07:36,753 --> 01:07:39,123
get us scholarships that
can let us out of Louisiana.

1451
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:40,757
Yeah, but this could
change everything.

1452
01:07:40,857 --> 01:07:42,126
You don't understand.

1453
01:07:42,226 --> 01:07:44,094
No, I might be the
only one who does.

1454
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:48,832
I've got to live every day
for the rest of my life

1455
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:51,067
knowing that I
share half of my DNA

1456
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:52,602
with an idiot who
thinks it's fun

1457
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:54,571
to bully his wife
and his children.

1458
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:56,506
I could go anywhere right now,

1459
01:07:56,606 --> 01:08:00,076
but anywhere I go I'm
stuck with him in my blood.

1460
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:05,081
I mean, this could be the
winning lottery ticket.

1461
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,417
Don't you want to know?

1462
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:09,819
What if I don't?

1463
01:08:10,854 --> 01:08:12,656
I don't have all
the facts, right?

1464
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,258
No evidence.

1465
01:08:14,358 --> 01:08:15,568
We can piece
together the outlines

1466
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,361
of the story without
knowing everything.

1467
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:18,228
You're assuming too much.

1468
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:19,328
Think about it.

1469
01:08:19,363 --> 01:08:21,598
My real mom is not gonna
be someone like Annie.

1470
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:24,100
Maybe.

1471
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:27,171
She was a teenager who got
drunk and made a mistake.

1472
01:08:27,271 --> 01:08:28,471
Or a woman living in a trailer

1473
01:08:29,273 --> 01:08:31,175
with a deadbeat husband
and four other kids.

1474
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:33,143
Or a woman who just wanted out.

1475
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:34,411
Yeah, but...

1476
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:35,879
I was her problem.

1477
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,183
She solved it by leaving,

1478
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:41,751
drove away and
never looked back.

1479
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:44,254
And I'm suppose to
leave it in the past.

1480
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:45,631
Never talk about it,
never think about it,

1481
01:08:45,655 --> 01:08:47,191
never feel it.

1482
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:48,525
Move on.

1483
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:50,394
She might regret...

1484
01:08:50,494 --> 01:08:52,128
There's no happy ending here.

1485
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:53,830
I don't believe that.

1486
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:56,866
This is an address for a
bar in Brooklyn, right?

1487
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,802
All I'm suggesting
is that we go in

1488
01:08:58,902 --> 01:09:00,237
and we have a look around.

1489
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:01,638
We can leave whenever you want.

1490
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:04,140
We leave all the
possibilities open.

1491
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:05,241
Come on.

1492
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:09,446
When have I ever led you astray?

1493
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:33,870
Hi, um, do you know who this is?

1494
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:36,706
Thanks.

1495
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:40,810
I'm gonna go talk to her.

1496
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:41,910
No.

1497
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:43,880
I'll do it.

1498
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:50,687
What'll it be?

1499
01:09:51,888 --> 01:09:56,426
Um, yeah, a beer,
a beer, please.

1500
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:01,631
Two beers.

1501
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:21,618
Amy, wait.

1502
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:22,718
She can't be the one.

1503
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:23,820
It's the wrong ending.

1504
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,655
You don't know
that, go talk to her.

1505
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,924
It's not her.

1506
01:10:28,024 --> 01:10:29,793
I know it.

1507
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,561
I don't wanna settle.

1508
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:32,862
I want the dream.

1509
01:11:03,827 --> 01:11:07,331
♫ I find myself standing there

1510
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:10,334
♫ With nothing to say

1511
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,010
We should get off here.

1512
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:25,715
No, Rosa's is the next stop.

1513
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:26,983
Trust me.

1514
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,618
Spin it.

1515
01:11:30,554 --> 01:11:31,554
What?

1516
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:33,857
That's what the sign says.

1517
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:35,067
You close your eyes,
you spin the globe,

1518
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:36,460
and then you point.

1519
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,970
Then the bartender makes
you a drink from there.

1520
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:39,596
What if I don't like it?

1521
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:41,631
Where's your sense of adventure?

1522
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:49,906
The sun will be up soon.

1523
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:52,509
Yeah.

1524
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:56,513
Maybe we should get a
little sleep before finals.

1525
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,981
Sure.

1526
01:12:00,884 --> 01:12:02,051
What?

1527
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:11,027
I'm not going back
after the tournament ends.

1528
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:12,127
Of course you are.

1529
01:12:12,195 --> 01:12:13,730
I have your plane ticket.

1530
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:14,731
It's not like last summer.

1531
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,633
I'm not running away.

1532
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:18,502
It's just whatever's next,

1533
01:12:18,602 --> 01:12:20,737
whatever's in the
new start for me,

1534
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:22,939
it's right there.

1535
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,876
And I don't know if I'll
ever get this close again.

1536
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:30,847
Things will look different
tomorrow, after finals.

1537
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:33,349
Win or lose, I'm not going back.

1538
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,552
You win, I lose.

1539
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:38,354
You'll be fine.

1540
01:12:38,455 --> 01:12:40,056
Don't tell me how I'll feel.

1541
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:43,960
I wish there was another way.

1542
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:46,630
There has to be.

1543
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:47,897
Trust me.

1544
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,425
Hey, I didn't think you guys

1545
01:13:15,525 --> 01:13:16,793
were gonna make it in time.

1546
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:17,894
We had to pack.

1547
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:19,138
We have to get
back to the airport

1548
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:20,864
whenever we wrap up here today.

1549
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:21,765
Okay, great.

1550
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:22,331
I'm glad you guys made it.

1551
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:23,432
I'll see you later.

1552
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,039
Just you?

1553
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:31,508
Today's your lucky day.

1554
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:32,985
We had some trouble
finding enough judges

1555
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:34,478
this early in the morning.

1556
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:36,480
You'll get a panel
on the next round,

1557
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,881
if you make it.

1558
01:13:38,615 --> 01:13:39,615
Hey.

1559
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:41,818
You awake?

1560
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,653
Don't wanna affect the round.

1561
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:47,991
Judge, would you like to
share your philosophy now?

1562
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:50,527
Tabula rasa, blank slate.

1563
01:13:50,627 --> 01:13:52,862
No preconditions,
no outside baggage.

1564
01:13:52,962 --> 01:13:54,097
Do the summary at the end.

1565
01:13:54,197 --> 01:13:55,198
Weigh the issues.

1566
01:13:55,298 --> 01:13:56,900
Tell me why I
should vote for you.

1567
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,935
You determine your own
fate in this round.

1568
01:13:59,035 --> 01:14:00,069
Call at flip.

1569
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:01,204
Call.

1570
01:14:02,005 --> 01:14:03,005
Heads.

1571
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,640
It's heads.

1572
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:06,510
We'll take affirmative.

1573
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:08,087
We've shown conclusively
throughout this round

1574
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:09,989
that income inequality reduces
educational opportunities

1575
01:14:10,013 --> 01:14:11,180
or millions of Americans,

1576
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,659
reducing their chance to
reach their full potential,

1577
01:14:13,683 --> 01:14:14,923
limiting their endless horizons

1578
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:16,361
that should be their
birth right as citizens

1579
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:17,385
of this great country.

1580
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:39,175
You owe me one.

1581
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:40,910
I didn't ask for any favors.

1582
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,011
The round was in a mess.

1583
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:44,113
Sloppy argumentation
on both sides

1584
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:45,533
and that ridiculous
time you spent

1585
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:46,683
on that counter plan?

1586
01:14:46,783 --> 01:14:47,617
I shouldn't have
voted for anyone.

1587
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:48,761
That's not the way it works.

1588
01:14:48,785 --> 01:14:49,886
You tied it up at the end.

1589
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:51,466
You told me how to
weigh the evidence.

1590
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:52,922
The other team couldn't
even manage that much.

1591
01:14:53,022 --> 01:14:54,022
Thank you.

1592
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:56,225
You got a hell of
a round coming up.

1593
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,636
What is Adam doing here?

1594
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:10,006
For the record, this
is the semi-final round

1595
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:13,076
between Stuyvensant
A and St. Delphine A.

1596
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:15,078
This is an elimination round.

1597
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:16,880
Winners advance to finals.

1598
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,882
Everyone in the right place?

1599
01:15:18,982 --> 01:15:20,262
Judges, raise your hands please.

1600
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:22,686
One, two, where
is my third judge?

1601
01:15:22,786 --> 01:15:23,587
Excellent.

1602
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:24,954
Do we have a time keeper?

1603
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:26,231
Let's try and start in
the next 10 minutes,

1604
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,255
keep things moving.

1605
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:28,892
Coin toss.

1606
01:16:03,627 --> 01:16:05,962
I urge you to vote
negative, thank you.

1607
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,731
Okay, we've heard both sides.

1608
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:08,831
Final rebuttals?

1609
01:16:08,865 --> 01:16:10,333
I'm ready.

1610
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:13,069
Judges, Nick, Amy,

1611
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:14,904
I'll go case side
first, in order.

1612
01:16:15,004 --> 01:16:17,124
Briefly to the counter plan,
disads one through three,

1613
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:20,009
and on their deficit argument.

1614
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:21,669
Over a full year of
debating this topic,

1615
01:16:21,745 --> 01:16:23,155
I have yet to come across
another affirmative case

1616
01:16:23,179 --> 01:16:24,939
that upholds the resolution
better than ours.

1617
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:35,258
No prep?

1618
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:36,592
No.

1619
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:37,861
Where we going?

1620
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:39,162
Same order.

1621
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:40,964
Case side counter plan.

1622
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:43,800
No, case side, all the disads,

1623
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,134
counter plan last.

1624
01:16:45,234 --> 01:16:46,369
Let's do it.

1625
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:48,013
The affirmative is
right about one thing.

1626
01:16:48,037 --> 01:16:50,273
This is an extraordinary
set of policy proposals.

1627
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:51,708
Guaranteed minimum
income would be

1628
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:53,118
the greatest expansion
of government powers

1629
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:54,343
since the new deal.

1630
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:57,022
What comes along with that
sort of financial windfall?

1631
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:58,748
Rules, regulations
and criminal penalties

1632
01:16:58,848 --> 01:16:59,883
for defiance.

1633
01:16:59,983 --> 01:17:01,651
You must vote negative

1634
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:03,953
to preserve individual freedom.

1635
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:09,058
Finals will begin
promptly at 2pm

1636
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:11,094
in the auditorium.

1637
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:13,663
Thank you.

1638
01:17:18,702 --> 01:17:19,936
On a two to one decision,

1639
01:17:20,036 --> 01:17:22,338
the round goes to
St. Delphine A,

1640
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:24,407
Stacen and Hartington.

1641
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:26,009
Thank you everyone.

1642
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:27,811
Congratulations.

1643
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,716
I've trained you well.

1644
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:33,816
Maybe too well.

1645
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:36,285
Ten minutes to finals.

1646
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:37,396
I gotta get something to eat.

1647
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,988
I'll get you something.

1648
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:42,091
Ashoke says GPS is gonna run
a new variation on warfare.

1649
01:17:42,792 --> 01:17:44,303
Greenbrier has the
best neg against that.

1650
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:45,995
Go and see if Omar
has the brief.

1651
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:48,231
Great, see you later.

1652
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:52,035
I told you things
would work out.

1653
01:17:52,135 --> 01:17:53,135
Here?

1654
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:55,104
Everything.

1655
01:17:55,204 --> 01:18:00,910
No, this is actually my favorite part
in the round. Nothing's been said yet.

1656
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,412
I can imagine how
it'll all play out.

1657
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:05,915
Nothing messed up.

1658
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:08,017
No arguments dropped.

1659
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:09,819
No mistakes.

1660
01:18:10,987 --> 01:18:12,688
We're gonna win.

1661
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:20,329
Why don't you go get set up

1662
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:22,365
and I'll track
down Alex and Omar

1663
01:18:22,465 --> 01:18:23,967
with the briefs.

1664
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:38,782
Where's Nick?

1665
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:40,025
They're breathing down my neck

1666
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:41,226
to get this round
started on time.

1667
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,151
He had to get something.

1668
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:43,987
Every other event is done.

1669
01:18:44,087 --> 01:18:45,989
People have flights to catch.

1670
01:18:46,089 --> 01:18:48,124
He'll be right back,
like two minutes.

1671
01:18:49,258 --> 01:18:50,827
You're first A seat, right?

1672
01:18:50,927 --> 01:18:52,028
Yeah.

1673
01:18:52,128 --> 01:18:53,296
Get started.

1674
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:54,030
Seriously?

1675
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:56,265
Do it before I change my mind.

1676
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:00,203
We're gonna get started.

1677
01:19:00,303 --> 01:19:02,171
Mr. Stacen will be
with us momentarily.

1678
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:08,077
Are judges ready?

1679
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:11,114
Opponents ready?

1680
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:17,954
Resolved.

1681
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:19,531
The federal government
should establish

1682
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:20,795
a comprehensive national policy

1683
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,934
to substantially reduce
income inequality

1684
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:22,958
in the United States.

1685
01:19:23,793 --> 01:19:25,070
The affirmative
upholds this resolution

1686
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:26,374
by presenting the fallen policy.

1687
01:19:26,863 --> 01:19:28,007
The most pressing
issue right now

1688
01:19:28,031 --> 01:19:28,297
is an incredible
rising interest rate

1689
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:29,798
on Stafford Loans.

1690
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:30,433
The United States
Government will expand

1691
01:19:31,134 --> 01:19:32,414
its program of loans and grants.

1692
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:32,902
A bigger picture is
that these borrowers

1693
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:33,736
are delaying major
life decisions

1694
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:34,637
like buying a home
or car as a result

1695
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:36,239
of their student loans.

1696
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:37,573
The rate of home
ownership is 36%

1697
01:19:37,673 --> 01:19:39,442
less student debt

1698
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:41,310
for all qualified
college students.

1699
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:53,990
A comprehensive national

1700
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:55,200
could substantially
reduce income inequality

1701
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:56,092
in the United States.

1702
01:19:56,192 --> 01:19:57,560
Nick's gone.

1703
01:19:59,095 --> 01:20:00,796
I don't think he's coming back.

1704
01:20:06,202 --> 01:20:09,038
Plank A, income
inequality is increasing.

1705
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:11,074
Plank B, access to
education preserves

1706
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:12,075
economic mobility.

1707
01:20:12,175 --> 01:20:13,175
Subpoint one...

1708
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:22,251
I'd been thinking

1709
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:24,087
everything would
be fine if we won.

1710
01:20:24,187 --> 01:20:26,122
I never dreamed Nick
would disappear for good

1711
01:20:26,222 --> 01:20:28,324
and that you'd be fired.

1712
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,129
I did it.

1713
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:35,140
Keith says I'll
get my scholarship

1714
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,164
out of Louisiana.

1715
01:20:36,232 --> 01:20:37,366
I'm happy for you.

1716
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:38,968
You'll do well.

1717
01:20:48,244 --> 01:20:52,015
But Amy, I am
angry with you too.

1718
01:20:55,118 --> 01:20:56,953
You have to understand.

1719
01:20:57,053 --> 01:20:59,555
What you did in New
York had consequences

1720
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:01,090
for others.

1721
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,359
It's not my fault.

1722
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:05,028
I treated you as an adult.

1723
01:21:05,128 --> 01:21:07,530
I put everything on the
line for the two of you.

1724
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:09,899
I told you to get back
on that first flight,

1725
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:11,134
didn't I?

1726
01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:12,368
Yes ma'am.

1727
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:14,169
Well.

1728
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:16,648
I don't know when
I'm gonna be able

1729
01:21:16,672 --> 01:21:18,374
to trust you again.

1730
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:27,216
After that,
I didn't know where to go.

1731
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:29,185
I drove to my parents' house,

1732
01:21:29,285 --> 01:21:31,054
but I couldn't go in.

1733
01:21:31,154 --> 01:21:33,456
With you and Nick both gone,

1734
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:35,058
I didn't have a home here.

1735
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:38,061
And I didn't think it
would ever be possible

1736
01:21:38,161 --> 01:21:41,364
to create a new one anywhere.

1737
01:21:41,464 --> 01:21:44,367
All I could feel was loss.

1738
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:49,505
We all left each other.

1739
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:52,041
And we never talked about it.

1740
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:56,980
And I put it in the past

1741
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:00,116
and I sealed it up tight.

1742
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:03,119
And I thought I moved on.

1743
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:05,421
But now I realize if
the adoption agency

1744
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:08,257
had chosen from column
A instead of column B,

1745
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:10,526
you wouldn't have
been in my life.

1746
01:22:10,626 --> 01:22:12,695
Maybe lots of life is random.

1747
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:15,999
But I was lucky to have you.

1748
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:18,267
You stayed with me all along.

1749
01:22:33,316 --> 01:22:36,585
♫ New Orleans ladies

1750
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:42,091

♫ And downright lazy

1758
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:12,188
We need our own ritual.

1759

♫ A little wave

1760
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,029

I got the papers
ready in my office.

1768
01:23:50,259 --> 01:23:51,560
Come by when you're ready.

1769
01:23:53,262 --> 01:23:54,163
Did I forget.

1770
01:23:54,263 --> 01:23:55,731
Signing a two year contract.

1771
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:57,566
My hand's gonna be
shaking the whole time.

1772
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:59,302
I'm available to hold it.

1773
01:23:59,402 --> 01:24:01,204
That's the cheesiest
line I've ever heard.

1774
01:24:01,304 --> 01:24:03,106
Well, did it work?

1775
01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:11,180
♫ Them Creole babies

1776
01:24:13,816 --> 01:24:15,818
♫ They strut and sway

♫ Just like the river

1780
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:28,597
Looks like I'm going to, uh,

1781
01:24:28,697 --> 01:24:30,766
be staying in one
place for a while.

1782
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:34,837
Oh, that'd be great, Rosa.

1783
01:24:34,937 --> 01:24:36,672
I'd love to see you.

1784
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,742
Three weeks next Saturday.

1785
01:24:40,443 --> 01:24:42,711
Umm, I might bring someone.

1786
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:44,347
I'm not sure yet.

1787
01:24:45,148 --> 01:24:46,415
It's new.

1788
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,118
I know.

1789
01:24:49,218 --> 01:24:50,219
It's been too long.

1790
01:24:51,187 --> 01:24:52,187
Okay.

1791
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:54,089
I'll see you then.

1792
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:08,537
Are you our judge?

1793
01:25:08,637 --> 01:25:09,805
I am today.

1794
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:11,274
Are you okay with.

1795
01:25:11,374 --> 01:25:12,608
Yeah, ease me into it.

1796
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:13,885
I haven't been here for a while.

1797
01:25:13,909 --> 01:25:14,810
You were a debater?

1798
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:16,712
Yeah, changed my life.

1799
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:18,881
Ready for judging philosophy?

1800
01:25:18,981 --> 01:25:21,684
Basically, tabula
rosa, blank slate.

1801
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,486
Everything starts
fresh from here.

1802
01:25:23,586 --> 01:25:25,421
Weigh everything
for me in the end.

1803
01:25:25,521 --> 01:25:28,657
In this round, you
make your own destiny.

1804
01:25:29,558 --> 01:25:31,694
♫ They sashay

1805

♫ By

1806
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:59,888
♫ Woke up in the
middle of a dream

1807
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:02,925
♫ Speak your name
like a prophecy

1808
01:26:03,459 --> 01:26:05,894
♫ While the moon
is holding me tight

1809
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:06,994
♫ Dance with your ghost

1810
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:09,198

♫ When the stars come out

1818
01:26:35,591 --> 01:26:36,392
♫ I get lost

1819
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:38,327

♫ Reality doesn't feel the same

1831
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:02,951
♫ Out live the days
