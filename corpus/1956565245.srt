1
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:18,166
Storm catcher to base.
Storm catcher to base.

2
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,999
Control, this is storm
catcher, do you read me?

3
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,632
Sparks, you there?
- Hello, no one's home right now.

4
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,266
Please leave a message after the beep.

5
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,933
Yeah, this is major holloway.

6
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:36,433
How the hell do i stop this thing?

7
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,866
Damnit, i thought i gave
you the instruction book.

8
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,400
Will you two quit with the phone sex?
We got a plane to test.

9
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,709
You know, sparks, i think you're
making my co-pilot jealous.

10
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:48,666
I didn't even know he cared, prick.

11
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,166
Yeah, i'll show you how much i care
when we get back to the ground.

12
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,599
C'mon, why don't you two stay friends?

13
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:57,266
It takes three to fly this
baby, remember.

14
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,666
That's the problem i'm
working on right now.

15
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,300
Morning, johnson.

16
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,333
General!

17
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,833
At ease, captain.

18
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:12,400
General's here.

19
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:13,500
Hi, gentlemen.

20
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:15,532
Enough of this mutual admiration society.

21
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,400
Let's see what this bird can really do.

22
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:20,433
Yes, sir.

23
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,367
Level down to 16,000, sir.

24
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,999
Stand by to activate
stealth mode on my mark.

25
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,766
Three, two, one,

26
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,467
mark.

27
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,933
Stealth mode activated, sir.

28
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,866
Let's run a check on the heat signature.

29
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,933
It's negative, sir.

30
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:03,400
Exhaust trail is completely undetectable.

31
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:05,532
This new system works like a charm.

32
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,632
How does it feel to be invisible, major?

33
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,966
Love it.

34
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:18,666
Check out the impulse communicator.

35
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,899
Prepare to engage impulse mode.

36
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,733
Yes, sir.

37
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:27,899
Three, two, one...

38
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,899
mark.

39
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:33,566
Impulse mode activated, sir.

40
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:36,866
Transmission received, major.

41
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,033
They've made vast improvements to
these new impulse helmets, sir.

42
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:44,833
We can now run the vital signs
on both pilots during flight.

43
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:47,866
By the way, major,

44
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:50,999
your pulse rate looks a lot
lower than captain lucas.

45
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:53,566
Any reason why?

46
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:04,433
Stand by to go weapons hot, major.

47
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,866
Good to go, sir.

48
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,367
Weapon systems activated.

49
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,966
No change in status,
plane is still undetected.

50
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:29,599
That's an impressive package.

51
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:31,632
Yes, sir.

52
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:38,866
My thoughts exactly.

53
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,599
Nice work, men.

54
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:44,400
C'mon home.

55
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:46,266
Yes, sir.

56
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,133
We're on our way, sir.

57
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,033
At ease.

58
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:06,133
350 saudis flown over the gulf.

59
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,500
Now you're in charge of just one plane?

60
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:12,266
Looks like you boys have been demoted.

61
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,133
Good to see you too, sir.

62
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,933
Didn't realize you were
flying in today, sir.

63
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:21,733
Those bureaucrats need to give
our asses a rest, captain.

64
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:24,799
I love the smell of jet fuel.

65
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,033
Major.

66
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:31,733
What the fuck are you doing, man?

67
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:33,632
What do you mean what am i doing?

68
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:38,833
I'm glad i was able to put the three of
makes my job a lot easier.

69
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:40,500
Thank you, sir.

70
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:42,500
Glad to be aboard, sir.

71
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:44,300
Just don't fuck with me, alright?

72
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,833
Just do your damn job.

73
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:49,799
In my day we just put them
see who's still left standing.

74
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,467
Be a pleasure, sir.

75
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,833
Mine, too.

76
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,699
He's a captain here.

77
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,733
That's a guardian angel.

78
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:59,500
Even though we don't like each other,

79
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,899
we still all have to work together.

80
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:03,300
Gotta fight together too.

81
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:08,266
Guess we're all pretty lucky to be here,
if you think about it.

82
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,566
We lost a lot of good men over the years.

83
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:15,766
We all miss tom, sir.

84
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:18,100
Your son was a good man.

85
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,133
Yes, he was.

86
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,799
C.i.a.

87
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,666
what's this, the "y files"?

88
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:48,666
They'll want more updates on this project
than the joint chiefs.

89
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,333
Frankly, it makes me a
little uncomfortable.

90
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:54,133
General.

91
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,266
I can see why.

92
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,133
I suggest you keep your eye
on the test flight, soldier.

93
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,333
I suggest you keep your eyes off me.

94
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,666
Sparks.

95
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:03,566
Sorry.

96
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,166
General, we don't want to be late.

97
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,766
Of course.

98
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,433
Enjoy, gentlemen.

99
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:12,766
I'll try to catch up
with you in a few days.

100
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:19,033
Do you got any respect for authority?

101
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,733
Not when they got an ass like that.

102
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:30,400
That's hot.

103
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,799
Wonder what's in the briefcase.

104
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,233
Probably sex toys or something naughty.

105
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:36,699
Come here.

106
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,666
The bartender goes,
"superman stop fucking around,

107
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:44,699
you're killing the customers."

108
00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:49,100
hurry up, man, let's go.

109
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,699
We got plenty of time.

110
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:52,100
That's what you always say.

111
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:53,400
If we're late, i'll take the blame.

112
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:54,632
Yeah, right.

113
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,933
You always get the kisses
and i always get the blame.

114
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:03,566
Hey, tough guy.

115
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,566
What are you up to this weekend?

116
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,166
Take my baby out for a spin.

117
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,500
Yeah?

118
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:11,500
Don't you ever want
to stay on the ground?

119
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,699
Not if i can help it.

120
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,066
Shit.

121
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,966
I'm bringing the car around,
you better be right behind me.

122
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll be there.

123
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:25,076
You know, major, if you're in a hurry,
i can check your flight gear in for you.

124
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,532
Save you a little time.

125
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,033
Sure, sure.

126
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:41,699
Just be careful not
to mix up the helmets.

127
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:45,500
Might end up with your pulse.

128
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:51,233
Wouldn't want that.

129
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:54,100
Okay, snap and roll.

130
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,066
52 storm on three.

131
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,966
Ready?

132
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,999
Break!

133
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,566
You were late.

134
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:09,200
Sparks, it's typical!

135
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,833
Why do you always make him late?

136
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:12,599
It was his fault this time.

137
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:16,066
We were trying to leave early,
he would not listen to me!

138
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,300
Ready, set...

139
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:23,500
one...

140
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:26,133
two...

141
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,166
three.

142
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
The goal!

143
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,033
Alright, nice catch.

144
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:53,233
Thanks dad, great play.

145
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,866
That'll come in handy next week.

146
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,500
I told him to leave.

147
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:58,899
No more excuses, sparks.

148
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,699
Did you get sparks in trouble again?

149
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:03,799
What do you think?

150
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:08,766
Good practice, ladies.

151
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,500
Pizza!

152
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:14,999
You got to talk to sparks here.

153
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:16,433
It's his turn to buy.

154
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:18,599
Pizza, pizza!

155
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:21,266
I don't have any pizza.

156
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,632
Nice going, coach.

157
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,467
Those were some pretty fast moves.

158
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,566
You know what they say,
the hand is quicker than the eye.

159
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:32,566
I love it when you talk dirty, major.

160
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:40,766
You know, big foot's
still out here somewhere.

161
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,133
Really?

162
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,467
He's gonna get you.

163
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,666
So, on guard!

164
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:47,233
You want to play rough?

165
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:48,766
Say hello to my little friend!

166
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,699
It got stuck.

167
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:54,133
Here, eat mine.

168
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,200
C'mon, we're in the forest.

169
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,033
Dad!

170
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:01,833
Dad, how come you can fly
a multimillion dollar jet,

171
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,899
but you can't roast a marshmallow?

172
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,966
It's easy, sweetheart.

173
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,899
It's teamwork.

174
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,566
It's okay, i'm fine!

175
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:13,333
Don't try to help me,
i got it under control.

176
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:15,367
Trust me.

177
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:18,033
What the hell?

178
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:20,433
Looks like the office called for
you, big guy.

179
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:22,333
Me?

180
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,367
Yep.

181
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,566
I got my phone in the car if you need it.

182
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:31,733
Pass the chocolate, sweetheart.

183
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:39,532
Be right back.

184
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,532
Why don't we just get a hotel
room, anyway?

185
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,599
I hate tents.

186
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:46,066
Save me a couple of
those burnt marshmallows.

187
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Sure.

188
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,233
Papers.

189
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,733
Alright, let him through.

190
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,333
Let's go, move it!

191
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:35,066
Get it done.

192
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,100
Getting done.

193
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:42,899
So...

194
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:45,799
are you a combat virgin?

195
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,033
Let's hope not.

196
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,532
I.d. switched, he's in.

197
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:07,566
Let's go.

198
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:35,033
Excuse me, sir.

199
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:45,699
This area is off limits
unless you've got some i.d.

200
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:51,233
major, i show no scheduled
flights on my chart.

201
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:58,166
Major, please remove your helmet.

202
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:12,699
Don't shoot, man don't shoot!

203
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,599
What the hell is going...?

204
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:33,766
Don't shoot, no, no!

205
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
No, no!

206
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,566
Blow me.

207
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:58,066
Blow this.

208
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,833
Nice work, holloway.

209
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:38,899
Over here!

210
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,733
Jacobs here.

211
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:35,367
What?

212
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
When?

213
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:21,266
Dad!

214
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,933
Dad!

215
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:27,133
Daddy,

216
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:30,100
daddy...
god, honey, where have you been?

217
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:31,433
Are you okay?

218
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:33,400
Where ya been?

219
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:35,367
We've been worried sick.

220
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,533
I went to the car to make the
call, and then, i don't know.

221
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,666
What happened to your clothes?

222
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:48,300
What, you took the plane
up and didn't tell me?

223
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,933
Why would you just leave?

224
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:51,966
We've been looking for you all night.

225
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:15,100
Attention, major jack holloway.

226
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:17,833
We are with the 109th airborne unit.

227
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:19,899
Please stay where you are.

228
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,300
This entire area is secure.

229
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,533
Any attempt to flee
will be met with force.

230
00:23:50,766 --> 00:23:52,200
What are you doing?

231
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:54,233
Orders to arrest the major.

232
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,300
Hey!

233
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Jack!

234
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:06,933
Calm down, everybody, just calm down!

235
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,266
Major.

236
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,300
General.

237
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,533
What am i supposed to have done, sir?

238
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,632
I was hoping you could tell me.

239
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:31,200
These are serious charges, major.

240
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,766
I don't know what's going on, sir.

241
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,566
I don't know.

242
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,699
I don't know what i'm
supposed to have done.

243
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:46,999
I don't know what i've done.

244
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:48,833
Please tell me what i've done.

245
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:52,000
Explain to me,
how all the evidence points to you.

246
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:53,333
Explain to me.

247
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:54,500
What evidence?

248
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:57,666
How all the witnesses have identified you
in your flight suit.

249
00:25:57,699 --> 00:25:59,133
And how your thumbprint...

250
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,799
i don't know what i'm
supposed to have done.

251
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,632
Is recorded on the identity scanner.

252
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,266
I know i'm innocent, that's what i know.

253
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
Explain that to me!

254
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,333
I haven't done anything!

255
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:16,866
You tell me who you're
working for right now.

256
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:18,632
Tell me who you're working for.

257
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,666
I'm working for the united
states government, sir.

258
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:22,300
Just like you.

259
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:26,866
Jack, i've known and
respected you for a long time.

260
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:30,500
Ever since you and my son
served together in rotc.

261
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:32,999
I can't believe that you would do this.

262
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:37,200
Jack, i know the two of
you were best friends.

263
00:26:37,233 --> 00:26:41,033
I'm gonna do everything in my power

264
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:45,200
to make sure i get to the bottom of this.

265
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:54,533
That'll be all.

266
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:22,599
It doesn't look as though
he's being mendacious.

267
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,200
Lying.

268
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:28,467
It doesn't look as though he's lying.

269
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,566
Still, there are only two people

270
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:33,766
who can fly that plane,
and the other is lucas.

271
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,166
He's got a pretty strong alibi.

272
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,566
So the general says.

273
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:53,233
Hey, jess, you okay?

274
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:55,200
What are you doing? don't touch me!

275
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:57,309
They got you scheduled to
appear at the federal building.

276
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,833
They're gonna try to court martial you.

277
00:27:58,866 --> 00:28:00,433
General jacobs asked me to testify.

278
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:02,033
What am i supposed to have done?

279
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,367
I don't know.

280
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,632
I told them i was with
you all weekend, man.

281
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,300
I love you, jack.

282
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:10,333
Love you, jess.

283
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:11,500
Do something.

284
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:12,833
Don't worry.

285
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:14,899
I promise i'll get to the bottom of this.

286
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,999
Sorry about the dramatics, major.

287
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:51,200
But we had to make it look good.

288
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:53,233
How about a snow cone?

289
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,733
Itching post to stagecoach.

290
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:07,733
This is stagecoach, go ahead.

291
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,266
Status update on package.

292
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,999
Package extracted, advise.

293
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:14,400
Bury the package.

294
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:16,467
Repeat, bury the package.

295
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:35,166
Sit back and relax.

296
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:54,433
Hold it steady!

297
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:03,367
What are you waiting for? shoot him!

298
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Did you get him?

299
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:19,433
Stagecoach, package loose!

300
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:21,333
I said, package loose!

301
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:23,666
Request immediate assistance!

302
00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:36,500
So much for the snow cones.

303
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:38,933
Stagecoach, itching post...

304
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:41,933
do you read me?

305
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:44,166
Stagecoach, advise.

306
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,933
Could you tell us more about
major holloway, general?

307
00:33:50,966 --> 00:33:52,866
Like what?

308
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:56,367
He's one of the most decorated
officers in his unit.

309
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,133
And he's flown numerous...

310
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,733
We don't mean that!

311
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:03,367
We mean more about his beliefs.

312
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,333
His beliefs?

313
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:09,533
We're an equal opportunity army.

314
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:12,233
We don't pry into people's private lives.

315
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:14,999
Not unless they're gay.

316
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:16,899
Or a communist, right, general?

317
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:19,333
Just get to the point, will you?

318
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:24,166
We believe that your major jack holloway
has ties to a,

319
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,333
terrorist organization.

320
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:31,666
18 months ago, arizona.

321
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,699
This military transport was carrying

322
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:36,632
a secret shipment of the deadly
strain, anthrax,

323
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:39,066
when it was mysteriously derailed.

324
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,266
Now, after an exhaustive
search of the wreckage

325
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,866
the chemical was never recovered.

326
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:46,933
And now, the phoenix.

327
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:51,100
These aren't random incidents, general.

328
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:54,599
This is the work of a very
well organized movement,

329
00:34:54,632 --> 00:34:58,799
and they're operating within the
boundaries of the united states.

330
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,333
A militia group?

331
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:03,166
Well, we're not talking about a group of,

332
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,367
paranoid survivalists.

333
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,033
Then what are we talking about?

334
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:11,333
An underground military force,
waging war on the u.s. government.

335
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:14,233
Maybe from within the u.s. military.

336
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,866
A conspiracy theory?

337
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:22,599
Ufo's maybe.

338
00:35:22,632 --> 00:35:25,166
You people are beginning to
believe in your own press.

339
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,500
If i were hunting terrorists,
the last place i would look

340
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:32,066
would be in the u.s. military.

341
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,699
I find your remarks rather offensive,

342
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:40,500
and i assure you i'll be filing a report
with your superiors.

343
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:43,266
Now please, get out of my sight

344
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,766
before i show you how i really feel.

345
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:53,899
Well, thank you for your time, general.

346
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,400
By the way, general,

347
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:02,033
we shall be talking again.

348
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,233
Stop it!

349
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:12,799
Sorry, it's a nervous habit.

350
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:17,233
Unconfirmed reports from the pentagon
that a top secret u.s. military aircraft

351
00:36:17,266 --> 00:36:19,866
has been stolen from its base in nevada.

352
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:22,766
An all-points bulletin has
been issued for the arrest

353
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:25,733
of air force test pilot,
major jack holloway.

354
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,033
Holloway is being sought by military

355
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:30,632
and local law enforcement agencies...

356
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:34,233
no, no, no, no.

357
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:39,367
Don't tell me you knew all about
this, sparks.

358
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,433
You're like part of the family.

359
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:45,933
You don't lie to family.

360
00:36:45,966 --> 00:36:47,500
I didn't lie.

361
00:36:47,533 --> 00:36:49,573
I couldn't talk about it,
it's classified, i swear.

362
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,500
They're been blaming jack!

363
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:53,699
Maybe i should go.

364
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:56,467
Yeah, maybe you should.

365
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,166
Hey, sparks.

366
00:37:07,632 --> 00:37:11,300
Listen, i'm sorry, okay?

367
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,433
It's okay.

368
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:14,632
I'm sorry.

369
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,467
That's what family is for.

370
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,599
You're under a lot of stress,

371
00:37:44,766 --> 00:37:47,467
sparks, it's me.

372
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,533
Shit, you scared the hell out of me!

373
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:50,666
What the fuck are you doing?

374
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,100
How's jess? how's nicole?

375
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:53,699
They're fine! you look like shit.
What happened?

376
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:55,100
They hijacked the prison van.

377
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:56,799
They tried to kill me, killed everybody.

378
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:57,599
They who?

379
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,100
The fucking hijackers!

380
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:00,966
I think they work for the military,

381
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,333
they had some kind of tattoo.

382
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,200
You know, like special unit?

383
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:07,333
It was like a snake coiled into a knot

384
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:09,699
what happened to all these people?

385
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,699
Okay, okay.

386
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:15,467
Just find out who they were.

387
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,933
Alright.

388
00:38:16,966 --> 00:38:18,699
So, what are you gonna do?

389
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:20,766
I gotta get my family out of here, man.

390
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,333
It's getting out of hand.

391
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,933
I'm gonna find that plane.

392
00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:26,166
Then what are you gonna
do when you find it?

393
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,733
Well, i guess i'll
have to steal her back.

394
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,467
Great, that's a good idea.

395
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,766
Let me know what you find out.

396
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:36,833
This is crazy, this is crazy...

397
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:39,566
i'm gonna get court martialed for this.

398
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:45,100
Just steal it right back,

399
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:48,033
don't call the police,
it's none of their business.

400
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:51,200
I feel like "cagney and lacey" here.

401
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:53,699
We'll just steal it ourselves.

402
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,733
It'd be the easy thing to do.

403
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:32,500
I wish daddy were here now.

404
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:35,200
Me too, sweetie.

405
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:37,632
Me, too.

406
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,699
Careful what you wish for.

407
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:41,833
Daddy!

408
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:47,533
Jack!

409
00:39:49,899 --> 00:39:51,899
Jack.

410
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:57,433
Dad?

411
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:01,632
Don't breathe, hold your breath!

412
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,300
Nicole, come here.

413
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:28,300
Stay here, try not to breathe.

414
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:29,833
Okay, dad.

415
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:31,866
I'll be right back.

416
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:39,066
Put that on, put that on.

417
00:43:02,433 --> 00:43:04,433
Dad?

418
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:21,666
Jessica?

419
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:31,300
Jess!

420
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,333
Jack!

421
00:44:05,899 --> 00:44:08,833
Hold on, jessie, you'll be okay.

422
00:44:08,866 --> 00:44:10,500
You'll be okay!

423
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:12,632
Dad, what's wrong?

424
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:16,033
Mom... mom, are you okay?

425
00:44:16,066 --> 00:44:19,333
It'll be okay, jessie.

426
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,899
Doctor!

427
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:07,333
I need a doctor!

428
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:09,632
Help, help us!

429
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:12,033
I need a doctor, doctor!

430
00:45:12,066 --> 00:45:14,166
I need a doctor!

431
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,799
Quickly, i need a doctor,
i got a knife wound here!

432
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,467
Doctor... i need a doctor here!

433
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,599
Help us!

434
00:45:21,632 --> 00:45:24,899
Get some help, get me some help!

435
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:27,599
Go, get some help.

436
00:45:27,632 --> 00:45:30,200
Try the other side.

437
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:32,100
Help us!

438
00:45:32,133 --> 00:45:34,999
Get some help, get some help!

439
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:38,133
Somebody help!

440
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:40,533
I need a doctor here!

441
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:42,200
Help!

442
00:45:42,233 --> 00:45:44,599
Doctor!

443
00:45:44,632 --> 00:45:47,233
C'mon, hurry up!

444
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:52,100
Where is everybody?

445
00:46:01,266 --> 00:46:02,899
Doctor!

446
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:05,000
I need a doctor!

447
00:46:05,033 --> 00:46:07,033
C'mon, hurry up!

448
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:12,467
Doctor... i need a doctor!

449
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,233
I have a knife wound here!

450
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:18,966
In the back.

451
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,899
Mommy... mommy!

452
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,400
It's okay...

453
00:46:37,433 --> 00:46:39,799
it's okay.

454
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:42,632
She'll be fine.

455
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:53,233
How you doing?

456
00:46:54,966 --> 00:46:56,567
Hey, bobby.

457
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:57,833
What's up, man?

458
00:46:57,866 --> 00:47:00,500
Glad to see you starched
that shirt for a change.

459
00:47:00,533 --> 00:47:01,733
Tim.

460
00:47:01,766 --> 00:47:03,766
Yo, sparks.

461
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:45,400
Hi, she's gonna be fine.

462
00:47:45,433 --> 00:47:46,966
The blade missed any vital areas.

463
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:49,467
She's gonna be fine, she just needs rest.

464
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,933
So, i'm gonna get washed up,

465
00:47:51,966 --> 00:47:54,166
and maybe we'll talk a little later.

466
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:57,799
And by the way.

467
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,833
I called the police for you.

468
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:08,033
Daddy, you should go.

469
00:48:08,066 --> 00:48:11,100
You should go,
i'll take care of mommy, okay?

470
00:48:11,133 --> 00:48:13,599
Go, just go.

471
00:48:13,632 --> 00:48:14,966
Alright, i'll be back soon.

472
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:16,066
I love you, daddy.

473
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,367
Daddy loves you.

474
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
Go.

475
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,066
Watch it!

476
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:43,100
Alright, big brother,
let's see what you got.

477
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,632
Alright... here we go.

478
00:48:57,533 --> 00:49:01,033
Serpent killers.

479
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:07,100
Special forces.

480
00:49:07,133 --> 00:49:09,533
The spark man cometh.

481
00:49:13,266 --> 00:49:16,467
Yeah, right,
who do you think you're dealing with?

482
00:49:20,866 --> 00:49:23,400
C'mon, open up.

483
00:49:23,433 --> 00:49:25,866
Come to daddy.

484
00:49:27,567 --> 00:49:29,666
Thank you.

485
00:49:36,367 --> 00:49:39,166
"sergeant trey c. stanley.

486
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:46,367
"serpent killer, special forces...

487
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:53,733
baghdad", what?

488
00:50:24,266 --> 00:50:26,899
Grant me the serenity...

489
00:50:44,766 --> 00:50:46,866
sorry to bother you, sir.

490
00:50:46,899 --> 00:50:49,367
At ease, captain.

491
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,500
Sir, are you familiar
with a special forces unit

492
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:56,066
known as serpent killers?

493
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,699
Of course.

494
00:50:58,733 --> 00:51:01,933
My son was a member of that unit.

495
00:51:01,966 --> 00:51:03,933
I've been doing a little research

496
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:07,166
and i found some things
that are rather strange.

497
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,066
These dog tags belong to
a sergeant trey stanley.

498
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:16,066
His records show he was killed
in action during the gulf war.

499
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,999
As well as four other sergeants.

500
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:21,300
So?

501
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:24,400
So, none of these men were actually dead,

502
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:26,533
until a couple days ago.

503
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,333
They were all part of the team

504
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:31,200
that hijacked major
holloway's prison van.

505
00:51:31,233 --> 00:51:34,866
How did you get this, captain?

506
00:51:34,899 --> 00:51:38,733
Has holloway contacted you?

507
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:41,533
Yes, sir.

508
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:44,666
I see.

509
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:47,933
Have a seat, captain.

510
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:55,933
The serpent killers were
a special forces unit

511
00:51:55,966 --> 00:51:58,233
formed back in '68

512
00:51:58,266 --> 00:52:00,233
at the height of the vietnam war

513
00:52:00,266 --> 00:52:02,467
to terminate high profile targets

514
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,166
with zero footprint.

515
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,100
An assassination squad

516
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:09,033
that could take the head off of

517
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:10,733
whatever foreign snakes

518
00:52:10,766 --> 00:52:12,899
the u.s. government deemed
no longer necessary.

519
00:52:12,933 --> 00:52:15,333
But, sir, aren't assassination attempts

520
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:16,999
against foreign heads of state

521
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,333
against federal law?

522
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:19,533
Yes, they are.

523
00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:20,999
But i have two words, sparks.

524
00:52:21,033 --> 00:52:23,133
Plausible deniability.

525
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:25,166
Party line in the cia.

526
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,533
If these men were still
alive, as you say,

527
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:32,433
the company's fingerprints
could be all over this.

528
00:52:32,467 --> 00:52:36,400
So, you're saying the cia
has something to do with

529
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:38,433
the theft of storm catcher.

530
00:52:38,467 --> 00:52:41,233
That's what we have to find out.

531
00:52:41,266 --> 00:52:43,933
Does anyone else know about this?

532
00:52:43,966 --> 00:52:46,866
No, sir, i thought i
should come to you first.

533
00:52:46,899 --> 00:52:50,666
Good, if we're gonna enter the snake pit,

534
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:53,999
we'd better do it quietly.

535
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:05,066
Hello?

536
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:11,500
Hello?

537
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:15,833
Whaddya want?

538
00:53:15,866 --> 00:53:18,200
I'm here to service mr. lucas' plane.

539
00:53:18,233 --> 00:53:19,500
Where's the regular guy?

540
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:21,567
Called in sick.

541
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,300
I need to see the flight logs,

542
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,933
you know, check the mileage.

543
00:53:25,966 --> 00:53:27,100
That kind of thing.

544
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:28,766
Mechanical records is the only one

545
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:30,899
that has access to that
kind of information.

546
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:33,367
I'll have to check with the office.

547
00:53:46,433 --> 00:53:48,799
Hey, who's winning the game?

548
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:51,400
The dodgers are blowing

549
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:53,367
this year their pitching
ain't been for shit.

550
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,833
You know, i haven't been a dodgers fan

551
00:53:57,866 --> 00:53:59,500
since they left brooklyn.

552
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:00,733
You from brooklyn?

553
00:54:00,766 --> 00:54:02,100
Yeah, kind of.

554
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:05,233
My parents were immigrants,
i grew up in, um...

555
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:09,599
flatbush.

556
00:54:09,632 --> 00:54:11,567
Flatbush?! get the fuck out of here!!

557
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,066
I'm from flatbush,
where'd you go to school?

558
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,066
School?

559
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,966
Yeah.

560
00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:18,999
Who the fuck went to school?!

561
00:54:21,233 --> 00:54:23,799
You wanna make that call?
I'm running kinda late.

562
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,367
The hell with it.

563
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,533
Us brooklyn bums gotta stick together.

564
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:29,000
I'll get that information.

565
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:31,500
You know, the guy is really a prick

566
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:33,999
flies in and out of here all the time,

567
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:36,000
santa fe a lot, santa fe, new mexico.

568
00:54:36,033 --> 00:54:37,699
Here it is.

569
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,300
Never says as much as hello.

570
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:41,733
As a matter of fact,

571
00:54:41,766 --> 00:54:44,233
last saturday night he
flew in from santa fe.

572
00:54:44,266 --> 00:54:46,200
Here you go, that's everything you need.

573
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:47,833
Alright.

574
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:50,166
Hey!

575
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,367
Brooklyn, alright.

576
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,467
New mexico.

577
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,300
What are you doing messin'
with mr. lucas' plane?

578
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:34,933
Lucas, lucas?

579
00:55:34,966 --> 00:55:38,133
I thought this was the loopers' plane.

580
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:42,233
Boy, is my face red.

581
00:55:42,266 --> 00:55:45,266
Say, you wouldn't happen to
know which one of these planes

582
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,999
belongs to mr. loopers?

583
00:55:47,033 --> 00:55:50,567
Why don't you come with me?

584
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:52,400
You're making a huge mistake.

585
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,933
That wouldn't be the first time.

586
00:55:54,966 --> 00:55:56,966
You can't say i didn't try.

587
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:00,500
Is that all you got?

588
00:56:48,866 --> 00:56:51,100
There you go.

589
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:58,632
Son-of-a-bitch.

590
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,632
Hello?

591
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:03,400
Hello? i need that candy.

592
00:57:03,433 --> 00:57:07,133
I suggest you read the ingredients.

593
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:08,833
Thank you, betty crocker.

594
00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:10,833
No.

595
00:57:10,866 --> 00:57:12,233
We need to talk.

596
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:13,599
No, we don't.

597
00:57:13,632 --> 00:57:16,300
Can i get my candy please?
That was my last 50 cents!

598
00:57:37,066 --> 00:57:39,000
Come back here, you prick-bastard!

599
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:40,866
I can't believe it!

600
00:57:40,899 --> 00:57:42,766
What the hell is the matter with you?!

601
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,200
New yorkers.

602
00:57:45,233 --> 00:57:47,367
Get your ass back here!

603
00:57:57,833 --> 00:57:59,533
Hey, what are you doing?

604
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:02,133
Why don't you just tell
us where holloway is?

605
00:58:04,433 --> 00:58:06,433
Shh.

606
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:25,933
You know, sparks,

607
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:27,699
here's something for you to think about.

608
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:30,100
An anonymous american company

609
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:32,567
has been purchasing numerous properties.

610
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:36,666
I mean, airfields,
factories, reservations.

611
00:58:36,699 --> 00:58:38,367
You name it.

612
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,400
A company, we believe, is being financed

613
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,500
from somewhere within the u.s. military.

614
00:58:43,533 --> 00:58:45,500
So, let me get this straight.

615
00:58:45,533 --> 00:58:46,766
You're telling me that
renegade members...

616
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,866
Shh.

617
00:58:48,899 --> 00:58:51,400
Of our own military,

618
00:58:51,433 --> 00:58:54,599
are buying and stealing
weapons and equipment

619
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:57,033
for some underground movement?

620
00:58:57,066 --> 00:59:00,766
We're talking about civil war here.

621
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,400
Your boyfriend, holloway,

622
00:59:02,433 --> 00:59:04,999
he's been set up from the very beginning.

623
00:59:05,033 --> 00:59:08,799
He's the biggest patsy since oswald.

624
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:11,567
So, why don't you just
tell us where holloway is

625
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,599
and save us all a lot of...

626
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,100
wait, wait, wait,
let's talk about this man!

627
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:31,133
Wait a minute!!

628
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:41,733
I'm here to visit holloway's
wife and daughter.

629
01:00:41,766 --> 01:00:44,133
It's fine, you can go right on in.

630
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:47,066
Thank you very much, thank you.

631
01:03:13,632 --> 01:03:16,100
Why don't you just tell me where he is?

632
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:18,467
Who? dickhead!

633
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,866
The white rabbit, who do you think?

634
01:03:21,899 --> 01:03:25,699
Trix are for kids, i hate rabbits.

635
01:03:28,999 --> 01:03:30,567
You know what, sparks?

636
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,467
This is gonna start
to hurt after a while.

637
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,966
So why don't you just be smart,

638
01:03:33,999 --> 01:03:34,933
and tell me where he is,

639
01:03:34,966 --> 01:03:36,699
you stupid piece of shit.

640
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,166
I would tell you, lucas,

641
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,799
except you hit like a bitch.

642
01:03:41,799 --> 01:03:43,799
Ooh!

643
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,699
Looking for me?

644
01:03:52,733 --> 01:03:54,733
Put the gun down, major.

645
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:12,400
Put the gun down, major!

646
01:04:12,433 --> 01:04:15,600
You shoot me and this knife's gonna slip.

647
01:04:15,632 --> 01:04:17,400
Shoot his ass.

648
01:04:17,433 --> 01:04:20,500
Right between the eyes.

649
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,733
Don't do it, jack!

650
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:34,833
So, how long have you been
involved in this shit?

651
01:04:34,866 --> 01:04:36,266
Fuckin' traitor.

652
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,200
You wouldn't understand.

653
01:04:38,233 --> 01:04:40,233
Try me.

654
01:04:47,899 --> 01:04:49,999
C'mon, jack, get his ass!

655
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:58,400
Fuckin' girl scout, knot-tying,

656
01:04:58,433 --> 01:05:02,666
nazi-mick-bastard!

657
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:04,699
Shit!

658
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:17,367
I'm coming, buddy,

659
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,400
wait a minute, i'm coming!

660
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:06,999
You said you didn't
wanna stay on the ground,

661
01:06:07,033 --> 01:06:09,033
didn't you?

662
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,899
Hey, thanks for your help, buddy.

663
01:06:36,933 --> 01:06:38,666
Any time, man.

664
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:39,833
How you doing, okay?

665
01:06:39,866 --> 01:06:41,766
Yeah, i'm okay, are you alright?

666
01:06:41,799 --> 01:06:43,266
They got storm catcher man.

667
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,567
Shit, i know.

668
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,899
Do you know what they're
gonna use it for?

669
01:06:45,933 --> 01:06:47,467
No, but, once it goes stealth,

670
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,166
nobody can catch that thing.

671
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,533
I know.

672
01:06:50,567 --> 01:06:52,233
We need to get some kind of
tracking device on board.

673
01:06:52,266 --> 01:06:54,266
Yeah, something simple.

674
01:07:02,233 --> 01:07:03,733
That's it.

675
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:04,999
That's it.

676
01:07:05,033 --> 01:07:07,166
Get that on the plane.

677
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,766
Hello, major, good to see you again, son.

678
01:07:25,433 --> 01:07:28,733
You've made this very difficult for us.

679
01:07:28,766 --> 01:07:32,433
I've served this country
for over 35 years.

680
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:34,766
I believed in the american way.

681
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,133
My country, right or wrong.

682
01:07:37,166 --> 01:07:39,433
The america we live in today

683
01:07:39,467 --> 01:07:42,733
is no longer the country i once knew.

684
01:07:42,766 --> 01:07:45,766
The country i swore to defend.

685
01:07:45,799 --> 01:07:50,467
The freedoms and rights
accorded us as americans

686
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,367
by the constitution

687
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,266
have gradually been eroded

688
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:58,100
by an overzealous and corrupt government

689
01:07:58,133 --> 01:08:01,033
that no longer embodies
the principals of being

690
01:08:01,066 --> 01:08:05,866
of, for, and by, the people.

691
01:08:05,899 --> 01:08:07,999
Jefferson once said,

692
01:08:08,033 --> 01:08:09,600
"the tree of freedom,

693
01:08:09,632 --> 01:08:12,666
"that must be replenished
from time to time,

694
01:08:12,699 --> 01:08:15,766
with the blood of patriots."

695
01:08:15,799 --> 01:08:18,333
and he must be rolling over
in his grave right now.

696
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,933
So, do you mind telling us

697
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:26,000
what being a patriot means these days?

698
01:08:26,033 --> 01:08:28,766
The same thing it always has.

699
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,433
Preservation of freedom.

700
01:08:32,467 --> 01:08:35,000
The only way to kill a snake

701
01:08:35,033 --> 01:08:36,999
is to cut off its head.

702
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:39,333
We've been doing that for years

703
01:08:39,367 --> 01:08:41,467
all over the world.

704
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,766
And now the time has finally come

705
01:08:43,799 --> 01:08:47,033
to do the same thing right
here, on american soil.

706
01:08:47,066 --> 01:08:49,799
Don't you think you're
a little outnumbered?

707
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:52,300
There's over a thousand soldiers

708
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:54,632
in this state alone.

709
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:58,899
What you see here is just
the tip of the iceberg.

710
01:08:58,933 --> 01:09:01,733
What about tom?

711
01:09:01,766 --> 01:09:04,567
What about your son, tom?

712
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,300
He believed in this country.

713
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:09,899
Fought for this country.

714
01:09:09,933 --> 01:09:12,066
And he died for it.

715
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:16,133
How do you think he feels about this?

716
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:18,333
About what you're doing here?

717
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:21,966
This country dishonored my son,

718
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:24,500
and the thousands of
soldiers just like him

719
01:09:24,533 --> 01:09:27,600
by failing to live up to
its end of the bargain.

720
01:09:27,632 --> 01:09:31,933
Don't tell me about my son.

721
01:09:39,666 --> 01:09:42,133
You're a good soldier, jack.

722
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:44,200
Too good.

723
01:09:44,233 --> 01:09:47,066
And now, unfortunately,

724
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,733
you're the only one
who can fly the plane.

725
01:09:50,766 --> 01:09:55,233
I think you misjudged me, general.

726
01:09:55,266 --> 01:09:59,100
I'll never betray my country.

727
01:09:59,133 --> 01:10:01,966
I thought as much, jack.

728
01:10:01,999 --> 01:10:04,632
But, you know, the old saying,

729
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:06,899
never say never.

730
01:10:08,899 --> 01:10:10,899
Daddy!

731
01:10:15,033 --> 01:10:17,600
Daddy!

732
01:10:17,632 --> 01:10:19,966
Nicole!

733
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:33,733
The sergeant here's gonna
be along for the ride,

734
01:10:33,766 --> 01:10:35,367
just in case.

735
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,200
Not that i think you'd do
anything to hurt this baby.

736
01:10:42,899 --> 01:10:44,933
Give him the keys.

737
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,033
What is this?

738
01:10:58,066 --> 01:10:59,533
What the hell are you up to?

739
01:10:59,567 --> 01:11:01,799
You're on a need to know basis, major.

740
01:11:04,266 --> 01:11:05,632
Get her!

741
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:07,133
Daddy, daddy...!

742
01:11:07,166 --> 01:11:09,166
Sweetheart.

743
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,632
It's okay, it's okay, sweetheart.

744
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:13,733
It's okay, sweetheart.

745
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:16,766
It's okay, sweetheart.

746
01:11:16,799 --> 01:11:20,133
Daddy, daddy, daddy!

747
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:21,233
It's okay, sweetheart.

748
01:11:21,266 --> 01:11:22,533
When daddy comes home,

749
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:24,933
you can show him how
to toast a marshmallow.

750
01:11:35,066 --> 01:11:37,100
You ever been in one of these before?

751
01:11:37,133 --> 01:11:39,632
Of course, i have.

752
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:43,400
You ever been in mach-5 before?

753
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:45,533
Shut up!

754
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:50,266
Sure, sure, um, want your helmet?

755
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:56,333
It goes on your head.

756
01:11:56,367 --> 01:11:58,433
I know where it goes.

757
01:12:27,367 --> 01:12:30,066
Switch to override.

758
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,766
And program these coordinates
into the targeting computer.

759
01:12:36,733 --> 01:12:38,833
Don't be stupid, sparks.

760
01:12:38,866 --> 01:12:40,666
Holloway would never forgive you

761
01:12:40,699 --> 01:12:43,600
if you caused any harm
to come to his daughter.

762
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,567
Let go.

763
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:23,533
How you feeling?

764
01:13:23,567 --> 01:13:25,033
What?

765
01:13:25,066 --> 01:13:28,200
I said, how you holding up back
there, sergeant?

766
01:13:28,233 --> 01:13:29,933
Look, all you really need to know

767
01:13:29,966 --> 01:13:32,899
is i got a .45 aimed at
the back of your head

768
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:35,766
with 14 steel-jacket rams.

769
01:13:35,799 --> 01:13:38,367
If you ever wanna see
your wife and kid again,

770
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,200
just shut the fuck up!

771
01:13:41,233 --> 01:13:43,600
Follow orders!

772
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:45,632
Yes, sir.

773
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,833
Stop that!

774
01:14:09,933 --> 01:14:11,933
That's right, captain.

775
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,600
Jack, take a look at your destination.

776
01:14:28,533 --> 01:14:32,567
Phase one, cut the head off the snake.

777
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:37,266
Phase two, destroy its body.

778
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:40,833
Phase three, conquer its domain,

779
01:14:40,866 --> 01:14:43,600
and systematically remove all freedom

780
01:14:43,632 --> 01:14:46,433
until order is restored.

781
01:14:46,467 --> 01:14:49,899
Welcome to the revolution, jack.

782
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,367
Activate weapon systems.

783
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:08,833
Showtime, baby.

784
01:15:17,533 --> 01:15:19,533
Put it in.

785
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:38,166
Increase speed,

786
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,133
and go dark at 500 miles.

787
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:43,866
Affirmative.

788
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,500
Mark three achieved.

789
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,699
Stealth mode engaged.

790
01:16:12,766 --> 01:16:14,433
Excellent, major.

791
01:16:14,467 --> 01:16:17,733
You are cloaked and undetectable.

792
01:16:24,966 --> 01:16:27,266
Engage impulse, communicator

793
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,766
good work, captain.

794
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:49,833
Nicole,

795
01:16:49,866 --> 01:16:52,100
if your father does what he's told,

796
01:16:52,133 --> 01:16:54,266
you're gonna be okay.

797
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,467
Is that understood?

798
01:16:57,467 --> 01:16:59,233
I know what you're seeing

799
01:16:59,266 --> 01:17:01,233
probably doesn't make
sense to you right now,

800
01:17:01,266 --> 01:17:03,433
but what we're trying to
achieve will bring about

801
01:17:03,467 --> 01:17:06,367
a greater america for
you and your children.

802
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,400
Trust me.

803
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,833
Ready yet?

804
01:17:11,866 --> 01:17:15,133
Almost, sir.

805
01:17:15,166 --> 01:17:17,166
Good.

806
01:17:24,567 --> 01:17:26,567
What the fuck is that?

807
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,133
That's the weapons system radar.

808
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:31,467
This is a plane, we've got radar, relax.

809
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:38,266
Sir, we've got incursion
into restricted air space.

810
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,533
Craft i.d.?

811
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:41,966
No imprints, sir,
it's a low frequency signal.

812
01:17:41,999 --> 01:17:43,233
Position?

813
01:17:43,266 --> 01:17:46,033
400 miles outside
washington and closing, sir.

814
01:17:46,066 --> 01:17:49,600
Ramble, fighter group three.

815
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,500
Fighter group away, sir.

816
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:04,333
What's going on?

817
01:18:04,367 --> 01:18:05,200
I don't know.

818
01:18:05,233 --> 01:18:07,033
What is that?

819
01:18:07,066 --> 01:18:08,699
Damnit!

820
01:18:08,733 --> 01:18:09,899
How the hell did they spot her?

821
01:18:09,933 --> 01:18:11,666
I don't know.

822
01:18:11,699 --> 01:18:14,066
You better not be responsible for
this, captain.

823
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,100
I'll kill you right here.

824
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,100
Bogey's approaching
from the atlantic, jack,

825
01:18:20,133 --> 01:18:22,133
watch yourself.

826
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,500
This is delta group.

827
01:18:26,533 --> 01:18:28,367
We are maintaining our
northwest trajectory.

828
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,933
Over.

829
01:18:29,966 --> 01:18:32,666
Roger, tega,
group approaching from the south.

830
01:18:36,166 --> 01:18:38,666
What the fuck is that?

831
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:40,733
Take evasive action.

832
01:18:40,766 --> 01:18:42,799
Yes, sir.

833
01:18:47,866 --> 01:18:50,500
This is tango,
bogey has changed direction.

834
01:18:50,533 --> 01:18:53,066
We are altering our course
to maintain pursuit.

835
01:19:01,233 --> 01:19:02,699
Delta group, here.

836
01:19:02,733 --> 01:19:05,100
Target is now approaching sector nine.

837
01:19:06,866 --> 01:19:08,866
What the hell is happening?

838
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,433
This is u.s. navy

839
01:19:14,467 --> 01:19:16,733
you have violated restricted air space.

840
01:19:16,766 --> 01:19:18,833
Identify yourself immediately.

841
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:25,799
I say again, this is u.s. navy

842
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:28,100
you are instructed to follow our escort

843
01:19:28,133 --> 01:19:30,632
and land in the airfield immediately.

844
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:31,699
Acknowledge.

845
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:33,733
Fuck!

846
01:19:35,533 --> 01:19:37,433
Where's the radar?

847
01:19:37,467 --> 01:19:39,766
Where is it?

848
01:19:40,699 --> 01:19:42,999
Delta group,
we have lost signal from target.

849
01:19:43,033 --> 01:19:44,866
Repeat, we have lost our signal.

850
01:19:44,899 --> 01:19:47,367
Attempting visual sweep
of sector nine, over.

851
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,899
Roger, tango.

852
01:19:48,933 --> 01:19:52,799
We'll expand sweep into
sectors eight and ten.

853
01:19:55,632 --> 01:19:57,467
Shit!

854
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,066
What's happening?

855
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,100
They went stealth mode again.

856
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:05,166
Where'd they go?

857
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:07,733
Where'd they go?!

858
01:20:07,766 --> 01:20:09,966
Godamn!!

859
01:20:12,866 --> 01:20:14,467
You won't be needing this.

860
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,567
Hey, hey, what the fuck are you doing?!

861
01:20:23,467 --> 01:20:25,433
Oops.

862
01:20:25,467 --> 01:20:28,833
What the fuck is that?

863
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:31,733
Contact mcgarry,
ask him what's happening.

864
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:41,100
Holloway dead.

865
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,866
Dead... dead?!

866
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:48,966
Fuck!

867
01:20:48,999 --> 01:20:50,999
Son-of-a-bitch!

868
01:20:58,233 --> 01:21:00,233
Plane damaged.

869
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,567
Tell mcgarry, permission denied.

870
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,567
Sit tight.

871
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:16,766
Targets can be reacquired automatically.

872
01:21:16,799 --> 01:21:19,733
Tell him, tell him!

873
01:21:20,866 --> 01:21:22,866
Fuck!

874
01:21:34,033 --> 01:21:36,100
Yes, sir.

875
01:21:55,033 --> 01:21:57,033
That's odd.

876
01:21:59,899 --> 01:22:02,500
For somebody who hasn't
flown a plane before,

877
01:22:02,533 --> 01:22:05,567
the sarge is pretty fucking calm.

878
01:22:11,766 --> 01:22:14,200
Holy shit.

879
01:22:17,467 --> 01:22:20,066
Bring the girl, we're leaving.

880
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,799
Okay, let's go.

881
01:23:26,233 --> 01:23:28,266
What do we have here?

882
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,367
Thanks, buddy.

883
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:46,200
Sparks.

884
01:24:46,233 --> 01:24:47,799
Tell him to land the plane

885
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:50,467
or he'll never see his little girl again.

886
01:24:52,567 --> 01:24:54,567
It'll be okay.

887
01:24:56,433 --> 01:24:58,533
Do it, sparks!

888
01:25:29,233 --> 01:25:30,933
Snap and roll.

889
01:25:30,966 --> 01:25:36,500
Snap and roll, 52 storm on three.

890
01:25:40,567 --> 01:25:42,567
What does that mean, sparks?

891
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,567
What does that mean?

892
01:25:51,799 --> 01:25:53,833
One...

893
01:25:53,866 --> 01:25:56,367
two...

894
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,400
three!

895
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,066
Never say never.

896
01:27:05,133 --> 01:27:06,966
Good shot, jack.

897
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,500
Your dad is pretty good with that.

898
01:27:10,533 --> 01:27:13,833
Kind of violent, but good.

899
01:27:13,866 --> 01:27:16,367
Man.

900
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,766
You might need to get
uncle sparks an ambulance.

901
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,833
Phoenix... nice knowing you.

902
01:27:24,866 --> 01:27:29,467
But, you're a little too
lethal for your own good.

903
01:28:29,633 --> 01:28:31,799
Daddy!

904
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:35,833
Nicole!

905
01:28:46,799 --> 01:28:48,433
Hey.

906
01:28:48,467 --> 01:28:50,400
What happened to you, buddy?

907
01:28:50,433 --> 01:28:52,899
Just done a little camping.

908
01:28:52,933 --> 01:28:55,100
Right, you look good.

909
01:28:55,133 --> 01:28:57,233
Good shot, thanks.

910
01:28:57,266 --> 01:28:59,367
I love you, honey.

911
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,899
I love you, too.

912
01:29:08,966 --> 01:29:12,333
One, two, three.

913
01:29:12,367 --> 01:29:14,600
Go, go, go, go, go.

914
01:29:27,966 --> 01:29:30,733
Yes!

915
01:29:30,766 --> 01:29:32,266
Yes, yes!

916
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,000
That's my goddaughter, she's with us!

917
01:29:34,033 --> 01:29:35,266
That's my goddaughter right there!

918
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,633
She's with us!

919
01:29:36,666 --> 01:29:38,033
