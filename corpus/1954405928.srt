1
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:11,252
I really love these hot days

2
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:14,088
all the little girls running
around in their sundresses

3
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:18,757
In the right light you can
almost see through your dress.

4
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:20,458
Do you know that?

5
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:21,195
Look all you want.

6
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:23,154
That's all you're gonna be doing.

7
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:27,754
I wouldn't say that just yet...

8
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:30,155
if I were you.

9
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,323
-Vera, hey!
Hey, how are you?

10
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:34,762
Good and you?

11
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:36,564
I'm good... look at this

12
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:50,580
Don't make a sound.

13
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:54,730
I heard you in there, you little whore.

14
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:02,458
Shut up or I'll gag you.

15
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:04,415
Get your skirt up...
Hold this.

16
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:10,299
I know what you want.

17
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:21,159
You like that, don't you? Slut.

18
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,762
Yes, I like it.

19
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,317
Who does this pussy belong to?

20
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:28,900
You.

21
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:31,263
Wrong answer!

22
00:06:32,531 --> 00:06:36,311
Say "This pussy belongs to Miss Vera".

23
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,972
This pussy belongs to Miss Vera.

24
00:06:38,206 --> 00:06:40,659
That's right.

25
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:47,565
Who do these tits belong to?

26
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:49,466
These tits belong to Miss Vera.

27
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:55,667
Good girl...

28
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:56,968
Turn around.

29
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:01,006
Arch it.

30
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:16,045
And who does this ass belong to?

31
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:19,608
It belongs to you Miss Vera.

32
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,752
I should make you wash
the stink off my cock

33
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:52,283
It might be fun to make some
little whore suck it tonight.

34
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:57,037
You look at me...

35
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:05,834
This is the beauty that
you create, is it not?

36
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,947
I wasn't always a complete whore.

37
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:22,447
My boyfriend Luke and I grew
up in Lynden, Washington

38
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:24,532
a small church town near
the Canadian border.

39
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:27,249
As Ernest Hemmingway said
about his home town

40
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,107
Lynden was a town of wide
streets and narrow minds.

41
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:32,820
Luke and I had known each-
other since grade school

42
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:35,135
and we started formally
dating in high school.

43
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:37,997
We were destined to be married
and live happily ever after.

44
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:42,739
Both our fathers were ministers
in different Evangelical Christian churches

45
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:46,632
but I was going to be a famous artist
and Luke would be a renouned chef.

46
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:50,365
After high school we travelled
one hundred forty miles to Seattle

47
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:52,907
to learn our art in the
heart of the big city

48
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:56,585
and it was there that I met Vera Lake.

49
00:08:57,178 --> 00:09:00,687
Vera has the face of a classic
beauty with her blonde hair

50
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:04,130
and her pale skin and eyes blue
like that of the August sky.

51
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,268
She came from money but she
ran with the artistic crowd.

52
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:12,626
And though she feasted on apathy, her
eyes revealed a calculating cynicism.

53
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:14,389
I thrilled to her attention.

54
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:26,438
Eat this.
Eat it.

55
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,165
Do you always do what people tell you to?

56
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,094
I believe that I was willing to die for
you answers your question.

57
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:43,954
Then I'm sure you're going to be
willing to do much more for me.

58
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,654
I won't say no to you.

59
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,741
Come by my appartment tonight
at seven... we'll see.

60
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:52,807
I would love to, except for

61
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:56,827
I simply must attend my date at
the Emergency Room tonight.

62
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:58,742
I hope you understand.

63
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:00,312
No. That wont be necessary...

64
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:05,027
The extract of Digitalis essence or
a larger quantity of leaves

65
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:07,091
would have sent you to the
mortuary tonight.

66
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:07,949
Lucky you.

67
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,473
It's not gonna be happening.

68
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:14,118
Well, I'm meeting Luke at 7
so I'll be at your place at 8.

69
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:15,396
You're meeting Luke?

70
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:18,859
Darling, Luke is so beneath you.

71
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:21,685
You and I both know he can't
give you what you need.

72
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,274
If you have to see that little twit to make
a camparison between the two of us

73
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,989
then you just go right ahead.

74
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:32,906
You know I won't disappoint you.

75
00:11:56,572 --> 00:11:57,405
Come in.

76
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:04,409
Hello, Ivy.

77
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,860
How was your rendezvous with Lover Boy?

78
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:14,674
Oh, Luke didn't show up. He had to work late.

79
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:19,368
It's always work these days,
or his precious alone time.

80
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:20,748
It's like a secret lover.

81
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:22,729
I'm getting really jealous.

82
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:26,779
I would never let a man do that to me.

83
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,300
And you're such a sweet girl...

84
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,143
It's a pity, really.

85
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:33,673
Yeah, pity.

86
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:35,489
I feel pretty pitiful.

87
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:36,712
Dont.

88
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,797
Don't feel pitiful.

89
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:42,336
Luke just doesn't need you anymore.

90
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,153
And when a man doesn't need you anymore

91
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:46,508
you find one who does.

92
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,741
<i>You find someone that would die for you.</i>

93
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:52,742
<i>And love?</i>

94
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:57,386
<i>Ivy, love doesn't exist.</i>

95
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:04,199
It's an outdated notion people have been using
for years as an excuse for their actions

96
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:06,515
Without love what do we have?

97
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:10,904
Decadence.

98
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:15,018
You mean like self-indulgence?

99
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:18,151
Self-indulgence...

100
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,945
beauty. Most of all beauty.

101
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:23,452
In all it's aspects.

102
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:26,527
What is beauty to you, Ivy?

103
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:31,110
Anything that brings pleasure to the mind.

104
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:37,230
Anything that brings pleasure to one's mind...

105
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,442
<i>Yeah</i>

106
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:45,105
In that case...
Stand up.

107
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:49,598
Lower your eyes.

108
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:53,911
You're not to raise them again until I
give you permission.

109
00:13:56,872 --> 00:13:59,606
Today you're gonna find out what beauty really is.

110
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:10,928
My beautiful one, will you remove your blouse please?

111
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:18,641
And your panties, but leave the skirt.

112
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:45,246
No. Keep your skirt up so I can
see your pussy. Tuck it in.

113
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:48,447
<i>Like that?</i>

114
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:50,948
<i>Yes.</i>

115
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:02,489
The most important person you can
give a gift to is yourself.

116
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,481
And I prefer mine...

117
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:09,930
gift wrapped.

118
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,993
There you look very, very pretty.

119
00:15:25,494 --> 00:15:27,077
Down on your knees.

120
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,117
Did I give you permission to look at me?

121
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:55,070
I told you not to look until I
gave you permission.

122
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,290
I'm sorry.

123
00:15:58,114 --> 00:15:59,511
You will be sorry.

124
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:10,477
Maybe you just need a little reminder.

125
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:14,907
Put your hands behind your back.

126
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,592
Very nice.

127
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,031
Now you're going to lick my pussy...

128
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,485
and you're not gonna stop until I come.

129
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:02,139
Do you understand?

130
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:03,626
Yes.

131
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,355
Slower.

132
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:41,335
Good girl.

133
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:13,345
Lick me.

134
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,966
Good girl.

135
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:38,846
Right there.

136
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,382
Lick me right there.

137
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:16,653
That was good. Good girl.

138
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:36,913
To show you that I'm not
all selfish bitch...

139
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:50,950
Drink from the cup of decadence...

140
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,691
and give your life
in the name of beauty.

141
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:06,292
Are you ready

142
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:08,222
for the real pleasures of the mind?

143
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:31,360
Do you know what these are?

144
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:35,511
These are beautiful too...

145
00:24:39,464 --> 00:24:43,036
Beauty is anything that gives
pleasure to the mind, right?

146
00:26:00,082 --> 00:26:01,597
Drink it.

147
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:29,778
It's Luke.

148
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:33,455
Yes?

149
00:26:33,724 --> 00:26:35,613
<i>I was just wondering if Ivy's here.</i>

150
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:47,907
She sure is.

151
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,388
What's that?

152
00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:00,856
Is that a ring?

153
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,436
Perfect.

154
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:06,933
See? I've already gift wrapped
her for you.

155
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:12,981
Vera.

156
00:27:12,982 --> 00:27:14,422
Are you leaving?

157
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:21,872
The key?

158
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:30,198
She's all yours now.

159
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,852
There's a riding crop in my closet...

160
00:27:34,374 --> 00:27:36,987
If you were half a man, you'd punish her.

161
00:27:39,472 --> 00:27:40,214
Luke?

162
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:56,499
Vera?

163
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:04,879
You're still here...

164
00:28:04,927 --> 00:28:07,011
Of course I'm still here, what do you think?

165
00:28:08,035 --> 00:28:09,162
He didn't unlock you?

166
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,012
What a bastard that boy turned out to be.

167
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:16,008
You're well rid of him now.

168
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:18,560
You're the bastard! Unlock me!

169
00:28:21,628 --> 00:28:23,747
You've given yourself to something higher,

170
00:28:23,748 --> 00:28:26,599
No need of Luke.

171
00:28:27,193 --> 00:28:29,919
Vera, we were supposed to be married.

172
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,127
We were soulmates.

173
00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:35,190
I loved him so much.

174
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:42,637
We've been over this.

175
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:46,616
Love is an illusion.

176
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,587
An illusion that will fade away.

177
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:56,745
This...

178
00:28:59,953 --> 00:29:01,828
This is real.

179
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,838
This is who you are now.

180
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,218
What are you gonna do with that?

181
00:29:16,787 --> 00:29:18,546
It's for you to paint.

182
00:29:20,553 --> 00:29:22,150
This is who you are now.

183
00:29:25,553 --> 00:29:27,108
May I suggest a title?

184
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,168
"Crumpled Mess of a Girl"

185
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:37,944
Vera, you're crazy if you think
I'm gonna paint that.

186
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:41,212
I wouldn't do that in a thousand years.
Who do you think I am?

187
00:29:43,386 --> 00:29:44,859
My whore now.

188
00:29:50,214 --> 00:29:51,754
When do you want it done by?

189
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:07,389
Just as soon as possible.

190
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,632
Dressed as a corporate whore today.
What do you think?

191
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:57,146
Splendid. How did you get in my appartment?

192
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:00,787
I know where you hide the key, sweetie.

193
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:02,289
Now it's mine.

194
00:31:04,352 --> 00:31:06,547
I'm not like that. I was experimenting.

195
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:11,122
Well then. You simply must paint me a picture
of yourself in that uh...

196
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:13,631
experimental position you were in.

197
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:18,740
I'd paint it myself if I were as good as you but then
that would defeat the whole purpose wouldn't it?

198
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:21,868
<i>I pray tell,
what is the purpose?</i>

199
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:26,385
Your debasement and defilement,
of course.

200
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:29,237
I told you I'm not like that.

201
00:31:29,238 --> 00:31:32,188
I'm gonna go to Luke and beg for
his forgiveness on my knees.

202
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:34,398
Oh you'll be on your knees plenty.

203
00:31:35,108 --> 00:31:36,743
Begging for Luke's forgiveness?

204
00:31:37,155 --> 00:31:39,082
I don't think so.

205
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:42,717
You've left him far behind
in many ways my love.

206
00:31:44,273 --> 00:31:46,292
I'm done talking to you.
You can leave now.

207
00:31:50,103 --> 00:31:51,802
Bend over the couch.

208
00:31:53,754 --> 00:31:54,799
Touch the ground.

209
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:03,186
The lips on your face say one thing...

210
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:07,442
The lips on your pussy always
seem to say another.

211
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,621
Which ones are telling the truth?

212
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:16,006
Yea, now they speak together.

213
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:18,306
Much better.

214
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,859
Stay like that.

215
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,947
I want you to bend over my knees now.

216
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,471
I want you to rephrase that as "Yes, Miss Vera."

217
00:32:56,896 --> 00:32:58,628
Do you remember what I told you?

218
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:00,714
Yes Miss Vera.

219
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:07,368
Do not come unless I give you permission.

220
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,368
That was for your insolence a few minutes ago.

221
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,625
From now on I want you to refer to me as "Miss Vera."

222
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:21,071
Okay.

223
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:23,902
Okay what?

224
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:25,589
<i>Okay Miss Vera.</i>

225
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:27,943
Is better but...

226
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,577
I want you to rephrase that as "Yes, Miss Vera."

227
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,316
Yes, Miss Vera.

228
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:42,074
You like when I play with your pussy?

229
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,854
Who's pussy is it?

230
00:33:47,644 --> 00:33:49,215
Miss Vera's pussy.

231
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:51,115
Good girl.

232
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:10,187
I told you not to come before I
gave you permission.

233
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:11,458
Yes Miss Vera.

234
00:34:11,732 --> 00:34:13,828
Then why are you coming right now?!

235
00:34:18,871 --> 00:34:19,371
You disgust me.

236
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,442
Sorry, Miss Vera.

237
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:31,041
You're nothing but a weak, selfish, little
girl who can only think with her pussy.

238
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,602
I'm sorry Miss Vera.

239
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,037
You should be sorry.

240
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:42,253
What you need, is discipline.

241
00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:47,790
Not just in sex but in all aspects
of your life.

242
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,584
<i>You'll learn about discipline.</i>

243
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:56,332
Okay.

244
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:37,489
What's that, Miss Vera?

245
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,188
<i>This...</i>

246
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,057
It's your collar.

247
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:48,195
Like a collar for an animal?

248
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:51,882
Exactly. It's a collar for a pet.

249
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,983
Which is what you are now.

250
00:35:55,992 --> 00:35:58,308
A squirmy little bitch of a dog.

251
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:05,216
Miss Vera, I can't wear that to school.
I'll be humiliated.

252
00:36:05,717 --> 00:36:07,117
Well, aren't you quick tonight?

253
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:12,458
Haven't you learned by now that your
discomfort brings me such great pleasure?

254
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:16,436
Turn around.

255
00:36:34,894 --> 00:36:38,275
This lock is to show everyone
who sees you...

256
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:40,411
that you're mine now.

257
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,219
Face me.

258
00:36:54,636 --> 00:36:57,474
Yeah. Nice. Very nice.

259
00:37:08,632 --> 00:37:12,331
Now you have discipline,
all you need is direction.

260
00:37:14,464 --> 00:37:15,239
Yes, Miss Vera.

261
00:37:15,523 --> 00:37:16,471
Come.

262
00:37:18,574 --> 00:37:20,345
Such a good puppy.

263
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:29,337
Heel.

264
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:40,463
Now you're going to see

265
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,085
exactly who you really are.

266
00:38:00,618 --> 00:38:01,733
Get on your knees.

267
00:38:05,031 --> 00:38:06,186
Look in the mirror.

268
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:10,579
This is who you are now.

269
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:15,917
You might not fully have come to
terms with it yet, but you will.

270
00:38:17,635 --> 00:38:18,586
Yes Miss Vera.

271
00:38:19,823 --> 00:38:21,296
I was lucky...

272
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,052
I knew who I was by the
time I was twelve.

273
00:38:25,144 --> 00:38:27,210
Some just take a little longer

274
00:38:28,587 --> 00:38:31,016
but there is a place in this
world for everyone

275
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,734
and your place is as a slave.

276
00:38:36,122 --> 00:38:37,803
As my slave.

277
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:40,156
Of course, Miss Vera.

278
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:59,023
We'll call this one... "Girl Meeting Girl".

279
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:02,949
I'm your muse.

280
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:08,727
You really should start painting these, you know.

281
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:12,689
It'll help you to grapple with
who you are on canvass.

282
00:39:13,932 --> 00:39:15,498
Real art.

283
00:39:15,591 --> 00:39:17,050
Yes Miss Vera.

284
00:39:19,638 --> 00:39:21,178
I need some release.

285
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,543
Earlier you so selfishly came before me.

286
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:27,544
I'm so sorry, Miss Vera.

287
00:39:27,871 --> 00:39:29,790
It's just you excite me so much.

288
00:39:30,245 --> 00:39:31,766
Of course I do

289
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:34,093
but you need to learn control.

290
00:39:36,186 --> 00:39:37,158
Come.

291
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,505
Heel.

292
00:39:48,214 --> 00:39:48,982
Sit.

293
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:55,272
I'm gonna put this down...

294
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:59,622
but do not move until you have
my permission.

295
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:00,623
Yes Miss Vera.

296
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:04,752
What I want you to do now is

297
00:40:05,627 --> 00:40:07,408
undress me slowly.

298
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:11,290
And then, I want you to make love to me.

299
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,233
You have all night for you
to get this right.

300
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:17,209
So take your time.

301
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:20,127
Start with my shoes.

302
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:24,661
No.

303
00:40:27,112 --> 00:40:28,571
I don't understand.

304
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,922
If you're going to make love to me,

305
00:40:30,923 --> 00:40:33,836
you should start at the bottom
by fucking my shoes.

306
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,696
That's a good girl.

307
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,334
Rub them on your breasts.

308
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:13,247
Alright. You can remove them now.

309
00:41:13,341 --> 00:41:14,672
Oh, thank you, Miss Vera.

310
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:48,737
Reach behind me now and unhook my bodice.

311
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:49,974
Yes, Miss Vera.

312
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,203
When I was a little girl

313
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:27,049
I had a puppy

314
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:30,095
who used to sit at my feet and lick my toes.

315
00:42:31,846 --> 00:42:33,079
But now you're my puppy.

316
00:42:34,403 --> 00:42:37,613
So I want you to unclasp my garters

317
00:42:37,966 --> 00:42:39,146
for my stockings.

318
00:42:48,815 --> 00:42:50,897
And you're gonna suck on my feet.

319
00:43:03,474 --> 00:43:04,925
Yes Miss Vera.

320
00:43:05,864 --> 00:43:07,248
You're gonna love it.

321
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:35,852
Oooh. You look good down there.

322
00:43:38,848 --> 00:43:42,385
But you did such a good job with
that I think I wanna have you

323
00:43:42,906 --> 00:43:45,223
lick and kiss me elsewhere.

324
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:49,187
I'm gonna bend over and I want
you to kiss my ass.

325
00:43:49,484 --> 00:43:50,188
Yes, Miss Vera.

326
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:30,696
Very nice.

327
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:36,619
Stand up.

328
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,425
Thank you Miss Vera

329
00:44:44,826 --> 00:44:46,426
You're welcome, my pet.

330
00:44:47,005 --> 00:44:49,858
Now lay across the bed horizontally.

331
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:08,058
I think we're gonna play a little game...

332
00:45:08,852 --> 00:45:10,022
Okay Miss Vera.

333
00:45:11,033 --> 00:45:13,306
It's called "See",

334
00:45:14,935 --> 00:45:18,206
"Taste, and Guess".

335
00:45:19,754 --> 00:45:22,546
The trick of this game is, you're
not going to be able to see

336
00:45:22,547 --> 00:45:25,447
anything as you guess... Lift your head.

337
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:29,014
Back down.

338
00:45:34,361 --> 00:45:35,489
Stick your tongue out.

339
00:45:38,656 --> 00:45:39,734
What's that?

340
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:41,535
It's your mouth.

341
00:45:43,485 --> 00:45:45,226
Stick your tongue back out.

342
00:45:46,015 --> 00:45:47,432
What's that?

343
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:50,802
Your finger, Miss Vera.

344
00:45:54,638 --> 00:45:55,495
Again.

345
00:45:59,142 --> 00:46:00,343
Now what's that?

346
00:46:02,572 --> 00:46:03,968
Your breast, Miss Vera.

347
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:15,360
Stick your tongue back out.

348
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:18,061
What do you taste now?

349
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:19,922
Your pussy, Miss Vera.

350
00:46:22,204 --> 00:46:23,627
Do you like that?

351
00:46:54,123 --> 00:46:55,683
I'm gonna come in your mouth now...

352
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,701
and you're gonna swallow every bit of it.

353
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:17,000
You like that, don't you.

354
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:18,554
Yes, Miss Vera.

355
00:47:20,795 --> 00:47:22,139
Let me taste.

356
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:30,358
Good girl.

357
00:47:32,196 --> 00:47:33,468
And for that...

358
00:47:37,118 --> 00:47:39,659
I think you deserve to come too.

359
00:47:39,697 --> 00:47:41,138
Thank you, Miss Vera.

360
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:44,026
What did you learn from last time, though?

361
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:47,149
Not until you say so, Miss Vera.

362
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:48,650
That's right.

363
00:48:02,323 --> 00:48:04,174
I want you to play with your breasts.

364
00:48:06,196 --> 00:48:07,191
And do not,

365
00:48:07,192 --> 00:48:12,052
under any circumstances, orgasm
until I give you permission.

366
00:48:12,053 --> 00:48:13,439
Yes, Miss Vera.

367
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,864
You can come.

368
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:55,460
Now I think I'm gonna have you trained so
that you can't come without my permission.

369
00:48:55,461 --> 00:48:57,811
Oh, Miss Vera, I would like that.

370
00:49:00,306 --> 00:49:02,198
Yes, I'm sure you would...

371
00:49:02,361 --> 00:49:03,348
But...

372
00:49:04,782 --> 00:49:08,531
But if you leave me and I can
never come again?

373
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:11,527
That would be a problem, wouldn't it?

374
00:49:11,528 --> 00:49:13,502
Yes, I suppose it might be.

375
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:19,419
Ivy if you're very, very good,
and you do everything I say

376
00:49:19,995 --> 00:49:21,621
I won't want to leave you.

377
00:49:21,522 --> 00:49:23,822
Oh Miss Vera, I'll try

378
00:49:24,377 --> 00:49:25,622
Good girl.

379
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:45,559
Miss Vera? You said you knew when
you were twelve... How did you?

380
00:49:49,343 --> 00:49:55,163
Well... When we were younger and...

381
00:49:55,361 --> 00:50:00,556
all the neighborhood kids would play "Cops
and Robbers" and "Cowboys and Indians"

382
00:50:01,016 --> 00:50:05,421
I knew early on that I was
more like a boy than a girl.

383
00:50:07,117 --> 00:50:10,299
I use to tie the little girls up to trees.

384
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:14,308
The little boys too actually.

385
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:19,307
They loved it... and I...
I loved tormenting them.

386
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:21,802
The ones that didn't like it...

387
00:50:22,047 --> 00:50:23,853
I think I enjoyed that even more.

388
00:50:24,335 --> 00:50:27,010
Must have been exciting being your friend...

389
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:31,427
I'm sure it was... and it
still is, isn't it?

390
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:33,011
Yes, Miss Vera.

391
00:50:47,499 --> 00:50:48,933
My pet.

392
00:50:50,738 --> 00:50:52,361
What am I to do with you?

393
00:51:02,297 --> 00:51:06,663
Miss Vera...
I love you.

394
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:14,629
You should get some sleep, you have to wake up
early in the morning and make my coffee for me.

395
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:16,893
Yes, Miss Vera.

396
00:52:23,845 --> 00:52:27,390
It's not bad but, It needs some more sugar.

397
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:28,536
Yes Miss Vera.

398
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:02,403
No. No. It's cooled down too much.
Will you go heat it back up?

399
00:53:02,404 --> 00:53:03,404
Yes Ma'am.

400
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:34,583
There's a drip.

401
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:39,288
Good girl.

402
00:53:44,473 --> 00:53:45,789
It's excellent.

403
00:53:47,115 --> 00:53:49,552
You really do know how to make
a delicious cup of coffee.

404
00:53:50,114 --> 00:53:51,606
Thank you. I do try.

405
00:53:52,868 --> 00:53:54,652
I got you a present.

406
00:53:54,653 --> 00:53:57,006
Go get me my bag right behind you.

407
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:02,000
Miss Vera's Bag of Goodies?

408
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:03,001
Oh yes.

409
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:06,617
You should have seen the looks I got
at the airport a couple months ago.

410
00:54:09,684 --> 00:54:11,007
Aren't they cute?

411
00:54:11,008 --> 00:54:13,228
They're a little... frilly.

412
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:19,155
All good submissive little girls need
a pair of pink frilly panties.

413
00:54:19,355 --> 00:54:22,403
It's a law or something.
Put them on.

414
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:30,545
What a cutie pie you turned out to be.

415
00:54:30,546 --> 00:54:33,496
Alright, turn around. Let me look
at that beautiful bottom.

416
00:54:35,763 --> 00:54:38,071
Walk to the mirror and back for me.

417
00:54:44,307 --> 00:54:48,680
Very nice. Very nice.
You're a keeper for sure.

418
00:54:49,065 --> 00:54:51,055
I am quite fetching, aren't I?

419
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,699
Ha, ha. And so modest.

420
00:54:53,734 --> 00:54:57,267
That ego of yours is gonna get a
spanking over my bended knee.

421
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:59,509
Promises, promises.

422
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,914
I've created a monster.

423
00:55:02,915 --> 00:55:04,305
In a sexual kind of way.

424
00:57:04,282 --> 00:57:06,297
I've never seen you this excited...

425
00:59:03,429 --> 00:59:05,354
That's my good girl.

426
00:59:26,602 --> 00:59:27,601
Good girl.

427
01:00:09,999 --> 01:00:14,611
<i>The next few weeks of summer sped by
as I discovered the city... and Vera</i>

428
01:00:18,978 --> 01:00:22,707
<i>We were young, beautiful, kinky and in love.</i>

429
01:00:23,043 --> 01:00:25,207
<i>Well. At least I was in love.</i>

430
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:30,441
<i>The days were filled with sun and exploration
of new people</i>

431
01:00:36,177 --> 01:00:40,845
<i>and the nights... well, the nights were
filled with pain and pleasure</i>

432
01:00:41,245 --> 01:00:43,154
<i>dominance and submission.</i>

433
01:00:44,109 --> 01:00:48,588
<i>and for all my happiness, my pleasures
of the flesh, and even my pleasure of the mind</i>

434
01:00:49,139 --> 01:00:51,972
<i>the darkness of what I was doing
to my beloved Luke</i>

435
01:00:52,129 --> 01:00:55,900
<i>hung over me like the long winter that
chilled Seattle for most of the year.</i>

436
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:59,667
<i>I'd avoided his phone calls, but I knew
I could not avoid him forever.</i>

437
01:01:21,692 --> 01:01:22,742
Buy me a drink?

438
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,257
You look like you could use some company.

439
01:01:25,914 --> 01:01:26,897
Is bourbon alright?

440
01:01:26,898 --> 01:01:28,128
Bourbon is good.

441
01:01:29,183 --> 01:01:30,703
I'm not good though.

442
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:32,155
I hurt my boyfriend.

443
01:01:34,015 --> 01:01:35,507
I cheated on him with a girl.

444
01:01:36,863 --> 01:01:37,810
I feel dirty.

445
01:01:38,671 --> 01:01:39,806
You're not a slut.

446
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:42,575
I'll buy you as many drinks as you want tonight.

447
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:46,011
I should have sat next you you as
soon as I got to the bar.

448
01:01:46,813 --> 01:01:48,331
You're not like all the other guys.

449
01:01:48,818 --> 01:01:51,442
<i>I could never see you taking advantage of a girl.</i>

450
01:01:51,801 --> 01:01:53,602
All women are good for is a fuck.

451
01:01:55,013 --> 01:01:56,408
They're worthless

452
01:01:56,557 --> 01:01:58,993
meaningless and pathetic
individuals

453
01:01:58,994 --> 01:02:01,994
who have to fill a hollow void
deep within them with sex.

454
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,241
I would do anything you asked.

455
01:02:05,312 --> 01:02:05,863
What?

456
01:02:05,864 --> 01:02:07,902
I would do anything you asked me to.

457
01:03:07,572 --> 01:03:08,840
Oh, Luke

458
01:03:09,304 --> 01:03:10,776
I knew you could do it.

459
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,573
I've needed that for so long.

460
01:03:15,804 --> 01:03:17,609
I need you.

461
01:03:19,314 --> 01:03:21,735
I need you but I need Vera too.

462
01:03:25,774 --> 01:03:26,993
Luke!

463
01:03:39,962 --> 01:03:40,790
Hello?

464
01:03:41,133 --> 01:03:41,903
Hey Vera?

465
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:43,074
Yes?

466
01:03:43,075 --> 01:03:44,856
<i>I saw Luke. It was horrible.</i>

467
01:03:44,857 --> 01:03:46,466
You saw Luke?

468
01:03:47,215 --> 01:03:48,458
We didn't discuss that.

469
01:03:49,161 --> 01:03:49,784
I know.

470
01:03:50,366 --> 01:03:51,790
I mean I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

471
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:53,968
I need to see you though. Please?

472
01:03:54,761 --> 01:03:55,472
<i>Fine.</i>

473
01:03:55,473 --> 01:03:56,210
<i>Come over.</i>

474
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:57,937
Okay. I'll see you soon.

475
01:04:08,617 --> 01:04:10,244
Vera. It was terrible.

476
01:04:10,245 --> 01:04:12,896
He fucked me and he left me on
a cement floor.

477
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,157
Take off your clothes.

478
01:04:17,158 --> 01:04:18,050
What?

479
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:20,329
Take off your clothes.

480
01:04:20,488 --> 01:04:21,966
Why?

481
01:04:22,964 --> 01:04:25,750
Because I'm not going to have
you coming into my home

482
01:04:25,751 --> 01:04:29,639
with his fucking stink all over you.

483
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:39,705
Miss Vera...

484
01:04:44,716 --> 01:04:45,987
Time to clean you up.

485
01:04:49,296 --> 01:04:50,192
Get in there!

486
01:04:50,193 --> 01:04:51,308
It's cold!

487
01:04:51,745 --> 01:04:52,745
Shut up! Get down on your knees!

488
01:04:53,127 --> 01:04:54,637
Down on your knees!

489
01:04:55,379 --> 01:04:56,093
Vera!

490
01:04:56,094 --> 01:04:57,472
I don't care that it's cold.

491
01:04:57,507 --> 01:04:58,314
Vera!

492
01:04:58,546 --> 01:04:59,449
Shut up!

493
01:05:00,278 --> 01:05:01,962
Stop squirming!

494
01:05:03,078 --> 01:05:03,982
Miss Vera!

495
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,320
I thought I told you to shut up!

496
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:07,949
Bend over!

497
01:05:10,595 --> 01:05:11,458
Fuck!

498
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:17,386
What did you just say?

499
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,749
I don't think I said anything...

500
01:05:21,097 --> 01:05:23,860
Profanity is not allowed in my home.

501
01:05:24,367 --> 01:05:25,716
Did I say something?

502
01:05:27,777 --> 01:05:29,537
Were you brought up with that kind
of language?

503
01:05:30,143 --> 01:05:31,433
No, Miss Vera.

504
01:05:31,434 --> 01:05:33,702
Then what makes you think it's acceptable in my home?

505
01:05:34,366 --> 01:05:35,757
I promise you I won't do it again.

506
01:05:41,139 --> 01:05:43,002
You're right, you won't do that again.

507
01:05:48,158 --> 01:05:48,970
<i>Pretty.</i>

508
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:52,300
Stay just like that.

509
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:12,768
This one I think we should call "Potty Mouth".

510
01:06:20,505 --> 01:06:22,253
You're a little charmer, aren't you?

511
01:06:22,254 --> 01:06:23,593
If you say so

512
01:06:24,141 --> 01:06:26,405
We'll see how charming you feel
in a few minutes.

513
01:06:44,979 --> 01:06:47,107
Put your hands behind your back.

514
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,871
Lift your leg.

515
01:08:04,591 --> 01:08:06,023
Something's missing...

516
01:09:23,643 --> 01:09:25,027
Miss Vera?

517
01:09:28,671 --> 01:09:29,517
Miss Vera!

518
01:09:32,308 --> 01:09:33,185
Miss Vera.

519
01:10:08,824 --> 01:10:10,030
Who did it this time, Ivy?

520
01:10:10,533 --> 01:10:12,961
You know who did it, but
it's not like you care.

521
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:14,630
It's not like I care?

522
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:17,095
I'm the last person you should say that to.

523
01:10:17,361 --> 01:10:18,489
Look at yourself...

524
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:20,988
<i>Your neck, your lip, my god...</i>

525
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:25,214
If I ever get my hands on that
bitch fucking kill her.

526
01:10:25,261 --> 01:10:27,085
You cant kill her, Luke.
I love her.

527
01:10:27,697 --> 01:10:30,321
How can you love someone
that hurts you so badly?

528
01:10:30,468 --> 01:10:32,850
It's because she hurts me,
that I love her.

529
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:35,030
Then I guesss that's why you never
loved me.

530
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:36,091
You can't say that.

531
01:10:36,501 --> 01:10:38,424
No... no I can, Ivy.

532
01:10:39,684 --> 01:10:42,373
I have to go home, I'm sorry
I'll see you later.

533
01:11:06,764 --> 01:11:07,996
What are you doing here?

534
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:10,682
Why wouldn't I be here?

535
01:11:12,156 --> 01:11:14,403
You've already used me once today...

536
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:16,150
Isn't that all I'm good for?

537
01:11:16,927 --> 01:11:18,564
Is that what you think?

538
01:11:19,898 --> 01:11:20,666
Yeah.

539
01:11:21,334 --> 01:11:22,116
<i>Come here.</i>

540
01:11:22,701 --> 01:11:24,520
<i>COME HERE.</i>

541
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:30,781
Kneel down.

542
01:11:35,514 --> 01:11:36,644
You're wrong.

543
01:11:37,733 --> 01:11:39,591
I could fuck anybody I wanted.

544
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:42,244
I choose to be with you.

545
01:11:45,542 --> 01:11:47,372
Why did you leave me on the street there.

546
01:11:48,249 --> 01:11:50,204
I mean, there's people living in their cars...

547
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:55,357
They could've done anything they wanted to me
if it wasn't for a man coming and picking me up.

548
01:11:55,555 --> 01:11:59,391
Who knows what would've happened? And even
he, he could have been a rapist or a murderer.

549
01:11:59,894 --> 01:12:02,235
<i>Do you think I would put you in that kind of danger?</i>

550
01:12:04,007 --> 01:12:06,131
Hm... I don't know.

551
01:12:06,268 --> 01:12:10,730
That man who picked you up was a friend
of mine. I sent him to go get you.

552
01:12:10,872 --> 01:12:13,019
Really?
Really.

553
01:12:13,903 --> 01:12:15,727
But you needed to be taught a lesson.

554
01:12:16,661 --> 01:12:19,278
I didn't think a spanking was gonna cover it.

555
01:12:21,382 --> 01:12:24,681
I need you to remain faithful to me.
Do you understand that?

556
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:26,556
Yes, Miss Vera.

557
01:12:28,549 --> 01:12:31,028
I'm going to continue to fuck whoever I like.

558
01:12:31,772 --> 01:12:33,459
You don't have that option.

559
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,932
Well, what if you find someone
more beautiful than me?

560
01:12:38,128 --> 01:12:40,025
What if you don't want me
anymore?

561
01:12:40,599 --> 01:12:42,908
I'll always come home to you.

562
01:12:46,845 --> 01:12:48,919
How come you didn't tell me you
loved me?

563
01:12:49,551 --> 01:12:49,920
When I told you I loved you?

564
01:12:51,818 --> 01:12:53,310
<i>I did that deliberately.</i>

565
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:55,740
It would have made all the difference.

566
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:01,056
Ivy, I've been trying to train you

567
01:13:01,447 --> 01:13:02,640
To mold you.

568
01:13:03,749 --> 01:13:05,761
What makes for the best art?

569
01:13:06,668 --> 01:13:08,878
Well... Longing makes for beautiful art.

570
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:11,636
Very good.

571
01:13:12,767 --> 01:13:15,427
Just when I've given up you
go and surprise me like that.

572
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:20,693
Do you remember that conversation we
had about beauty and decadence?

573
01:13:20,694 --> 01:13:22,084
<i>Yea, indulgence...</i>

574
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:24,752
Well, I want more than beauty in my life.

575
01:13:26,852 --> 01:13:29,794
I want art, and I want talent

576
01:13:30,946 --> 01:13:32,900
You're so talented.

577
01:13:33,762 --> 01:13:37,259
I would give my left arm to be able
to paint as well as you can.

578
01:13:38,642 --> 01:13:42,562
But you know, the world is full of talented
people who just don't produce anything.

579
01:13:45,008 --> 01:13:46,609
<i>I'm not gonna let that happen to you.</i>

580
01:13:50,124 --> 01:13:55,435
Those pictures I took of you were taken to
help you find your voice as an artist.

581
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:01,136
<i>I should start painting soon...</i>

582
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:04,127
You should start painting tomorrow.

583
01:14:06,003 --> 01:14:07,533
But today we're gonna relax.

584
01:14:08,627 --> 01:14:10,749
You come back to my appartment with me.

585
01:14:12,252 --> 01:14:13,726
I'll let you give me a bath.

586
01:14:13,727 --> 01:14:14,908
Okay

587
01:14:18,429 --> 01:14:19,930
I do love you, Ivy.

588
01:14:20,988 --> 01:14:21,853
I know.

589
01:14:29,797 --> 01:14:31,680
<i>We came to an acceptance.</i>

590
01:14:31,681 --> 01:14:34,374
<i>I was her slave but I was not her doormat.</i>

591
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:35,474
<i>We were lovers</i>

592
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:37,057
<i>and I gave her what she wanted</i>

593
01:14:37,058 --> 01:14:38,873
<i>but she gave me what I needed</i>

594
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:41,609
<i>We were in love and it was good.</i>
