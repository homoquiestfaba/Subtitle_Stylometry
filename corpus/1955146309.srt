00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,441
What is the point
of a gas station

173
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,376
if it does not have Doina
is what I wanna know.

174
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,345
How long is it gonna take us
to get to Pavlovka?

175
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,246
GREG: You in a
hurry or something?

176
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:37,349
Yeah, doesn't everybody dream
of being a production slave?

177
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,851
GREG: Swear to God, Kate
is gonna slap that smile

178
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,620
off your face so fast,
you have no idea.

179
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,487
Oh, God, how much
you wanna bet?

180
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,689
Twenty dollars,
she's already pissed that we're late.

181
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,393
She's not gonna be pissed at us.
She took an earlier flight.

182
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,761
She can't be mad
at us for that.

183
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:50,462
You keep tellin' yourself that

184
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,030
while you're cryin' yourself
to sleep at night.

185
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,799
Hold on, guys,
world's biggest pothole.

186
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:55,867
(CAR RUMBLES)

187
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,502
GREG: Careful, man,
she's sleeping.

188
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,905
ALEX: "Be careful..."
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

189
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:00,572
Is the princess sleeping?

190
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:03,975
Then I'll just,
I'll just make sure there's no more potholes

191
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:04,976
in the roads.

192
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,211
ALEX: Beautiful Moldova!

193
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,080
ALEX: The poorest
country in all of Europe.

194
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,917
The average Moldovian
believes in vampires,

195
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,919
lives in a tin shed,
apparently,

196
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,621
and has an average
of four teeth.

197
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,389
You are mean.

198
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,392
ALEX: Moldovanites don't just
enjoy record-setting rates

199
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,962
of tuberculosis, they're also
the world's heaviest drinkers,

200
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:27,933
pounding back more than eight
gallons of alcohol per year.

201
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,535
That's six times
the world's average.

202
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:35,473
<i>¶ Just drivin'</i>
<i>through a shitty town</i>

203
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,343
<i>¶ In a shitty van ¶</i>

204
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,779
You can get in on
this if you want.

205
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:44,583
GREG: Uh, but, what is the Pavlovkan national anthem.
Do we have one?

206
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,685
That is the Pavlovkan national anthem.
(GREG LAUGHING)

207
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:47,686
I was just singing it,
that's that thing.

208
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:51,489
GREG: <i>¶ Everything is</i>
<i>brown in Pavlovka ¶</i>

209
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,358
ALEX: Oh, my God, Greg,
look, it's your mom.

210
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,794
GREG: You fuckin' asshole.
(LAUGHING)

211
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,997
ALEX: Would it be,
would it be awkward if I hit on your mom?

212
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,933
ALEX: Here's the local
Stalin impersonator.

213
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,836
SARAH: This is like
the longest drive ever.

214
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,072
ALEX: I don't even know
what to do about this.

215
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:11,009
I mean, who has the right of way here,
me or the horse?

216
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,413
Welcome to the Pavlovka Ritz.

217
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,482
This is it?

218
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,454
KATE: And take care of the
fuckin' cockroach in my room.

219
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,888
GREG: Hey, come on,
let's do this, man.

220
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,157
This is gonna be fun.
KATE: Are you telling him?

221
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,759
VLADIMIR: Yes, yes, yes.

222
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,962
He says, "Step on
it yourself" or...

223
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,397
KATE: Step on it?
Step on it?

224
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,332
It's bigger than
my fucking foot.

225
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:34,766
ALEX: Kate.

226
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:35,934
Maintenance man will
not be here for hour.

227
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,836
Jesus Christ,
where the fuck have you guys been?

228
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:41,172
Before you freak out,
three hour delay in Berlin.

229
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,407
Kate, you've met
Wallace's niece.

230
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,010
This says that you're on time,
right here on the website.

231
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,878
GREG: And the flight was great,
thanks for askin', Kate.

232
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,415
Oh, fuck,
the fucking Internet here is fucking retarded.

233
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,083
Kate, Kate, Kate.
(SHOUTS) Fuck!

234
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,685
Relax, it's Pavlovka.

235
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:56,655
The cell phone service
is, uh, not so good.

236
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,824
And who is this
wonderful woman here?

237
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,792
I have not met you.

238
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:01,760
Oh, no, hi,
my name's Sarah.

239
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,362
I am Vladimir, it's a pleasure.
Nice to meet you, Vladimir.

240
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,899
I, uh, have a little,
uh, gift for you.

241
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,068
Pick a card, any card.

242
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:14,372
It's your lucky day!
It's Vladimir.

243
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,874
Everybody knows me because

244
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,376
I make your dream house
appear like magic.

245
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,245
Thank you.
Jesus Christ, whatever.

246
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,279
Just check them in.

247
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,248
GREG: Fancy.
Okay, here.

248
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,517
Why are you standing
around, dummies?

249
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,418
Go unpack the van.

250
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,488
ALEX: <i>Achtung, achtung,</i>
unpack the van.

251
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,857
Fine, do it.

252
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,491
Why are you still filming?

253
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,494
GREG: Memory cards are cheap,
I don't wanna miss a shot.

254
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:40,198
Oh, my God.

255
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,167
ALEX: <i>All right, it</i>
<i>breaks down like this.</i>

256
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,034
Greg is camera one.

257
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,270
When sound is not a priority,
I am camera two.

258
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:48,039
Your job is primarily
to fetch us

259
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,675
batteries, memory cards,
stuff like that.

260
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,143
Keep our walkies refreshed.

261
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,578
Et cetera, et cetera.

262
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,748
Um, when do I get
to shoot something?

263
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,750
Do you know how
to use a camera?

264
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:02,487
Yes, I took a lot of
film classes in college.

265
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:06,458
Oh, oh, my God, Greg,
she, she took film classes

266
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,660
in college.
(STAMMERS) I'm so sorry.

267
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,528
I didn't know we had
an expert on the crew,

268
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,031
so when you are not
being our fetch monkey,

269
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:13,665
you can be camera three.

270
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:17,602
You drop this thing,
it is $1,500 out of your paycheck.

271
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:17,869
Okay.

272
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:22,774
Okay, it's 2K, waterproof,
even shoots night vision.

273
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,409
Night vision?
Yeah.

274
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,144
SARAH: For <i>Home</i>
<i>Hunters Global?</i>

275
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,346
Bow chicka bow wow.

276
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,649
SARAH: What does that mean?
Yeah, what does that mean, Alex?

277
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,351
It means, you know,
in case somebody

278
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,452
wants to hook up
with the buyers.

279
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,988
Yeah, 'cause they're
definitely not gonna wanna

280
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,857
be able to see him when
he's hooking up with 'em.

281
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,159
Oh, see, he's very mean.
(SARAH LAUGHS)

282
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,361
You thought he was so
nice, but he's so mean.

283
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,497
This is why I love him.
'Cause he's a meanie.

284
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,766
Alex loves...
He loves my inner asshole. So much!

285
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,267
This is called a boom pole.

286
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,303
It's not to be taken internally.
If you catch my drift.

287
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:55,006
SARAH: Oh, so you
guys haven't heard

288
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,341
of sexual harassment
then, huh?

289
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,910
What happens in
Moldova, stay in Moldova.

290
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,912
Small cameras,
um, very versatile.

291
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:04,749
We use these for window
mounts, car mounts, uh,

292
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,751
chest mounts,
if you are so inclined.

293
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,453
SARAH: Chest mounts, for
hooking up with the buyers?

294
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,456
No, for hooking up with the crew members.
(SARAH LAUGHS)

295
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,691
No, this is actually for maybe
theoretically recording Kate

296
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,493
when she's screaming at you
and hopefully we can get her

297
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,495
fired one of these days. Listen.
See if we can figure this out.

298
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,932
SARAH: Are we gonna put it on?
Yeah, just kinda hold it over here.

299
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,268
SARAH: Okay,
can you see that?

300
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,536
No, I think it's great.
Mmm-hmm.

301
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,037
All right, let's get
kitted up, all right?

302
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,740
We need to, uh, get
some B roll of donkeys,

303
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:29,674
cobblestone,
that sort of thing.

304
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,676
You know how Kate loves donkeys.
Yep.

305
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,577
SARAH: Donkeys, really?

306
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,679
What, I don't mean,
you know, real donkeys.

307
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,680
SARAH: Okay, sure.
I mean, you know,

308
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,850
men who are hung like donkeys.
SARAH: Yep, I got it.

309
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,653
That's good, just relax,
let the camera be your eyes.

310
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,620
I've done this before.

311
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:46,257
ALEX: Hmm, yeah,
and she's got the student loans to prove it.

312
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,093
GREG: Oh boy,
look at this one.

313
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,599
Ah, now you see
that really sexy,

314
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,267
healthy looking American
couple in the window?

315
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,602
(LAUGHS) Yes.
Yeah, don't.

316
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,238
That goes for all crew,
all right, especially Kate,

317
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,573
Kate sees herself
in a, in a shot,

318
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:04,442
she'll slit your throat,
and that goes for car windshields,

319
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:08,012
mirrors, I don't know,
wishing wells, it doesn't matter.

320
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,647
Nothing ruins the
illusion of television

321
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,849
like catching the man
behind the curtain.

322
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,417
Or woman.
Or, yeah, whatever.

323
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,385
Dude. We're done
with this, right?

324
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,154
Can I just get rid of it?

325
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:19,424
SARAH: Oh,
I feel like these houses are looking at me.

326
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,292
GREG: All right,
pan down at me.

327
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,428
Come on, film school,
that's way too fast.

328
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,163
Anything quicker than
an optic foot per second,

329
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,931
people at home are
gonna start throwin' up.

330
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,467
Nice and slow,
nice and steady.

331
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,636
Nice and...

332
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:35,607
Fun lady.

333
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:39,677
Come closer, come closer,
come closer, come closer, come closer.

334
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,145
Okay, now it's just awkward.
(LAUGHS)

335
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,715
Somebody had onions
for lunch, obviously.

336
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,950

00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,643
They are probably just...

515
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:27,211
ALEX: What the fuck was that?

516
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,746
They go out,
they chop wood.

517
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:30,047
It's for fireplace.

518
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,215
(ALEX LAUGHING)

519
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,450
Right here.

520
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,184
Oh, wow.

521
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:36,721
SARAH: Oh my gosh!
GREG: Wow.

522
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,789
VLADIMIR: Wow.
KATE: Oh, my God.

523
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,624
VLADIMIR: It's beautiful.
Easy fix!

524
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:41,792
SARAH: She really fixed it up.

525
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,828
GREG: Are you sure
this is the right house?

526
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,595
(ALEX LAUGHING)

527
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,564
BECKY: I thought you
were coming earlier?

528
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:48,132
KATE: Me, too.

529
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,233
ALEX: Look at this.

530
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,402
Alex, Greg, I'm so
happy to see you guys.

531
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:52,870
ALEX: Amazing.
Hi.

532
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:53,671
Becky.

533
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:56,140
Holy shit, this is amazing.

534
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,342
BECKY: Thank you.
KATE: Hi.

535
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:01,412
Wow, this is quite
a transformation.

536
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:02,313
Thanks.

537
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:03,881
VLADIMIR: Becky.

538
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,884
Vladimir, right?
Yes. (LAUGHS)

539
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,386
She kids.
This is Sarah.

540
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,187
She's, uh, she's new,
she just joined us.

541
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,522
Hi.
SARAH: Hi.

542
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,057
Nice to meet you.

543
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,292
Your house looks great!

544
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,361
Thank you.
KATE: Is Goran here yet?

545
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:20,498
Um, no, he's
actually, um, traveling.

546
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,700
So he's not gonna be
here for a few days.

547
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:24,568
I know he's sorry
he missed you guys.

548
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,303
No Goran, that sucks,

549
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,406
'cause he was just
a really nice guy.

550
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,908
How does it look, Greg?
Do we have enough light to shoot?

551
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,210
No, Kate, I'm sorry,
we're not shooting

553
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,147
KATE: That's funny,
that's very funny.

554
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,514
Yeah?

555
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,516
Yeah, all right, let's
get, uh, back in the van.

556
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:41,452
No, no, no,
you guys came all this way.

557
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,487
Um, just come in
for a minute.

558
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:46,290
I have Starbucks.
(SARAH GASPS)

559
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,427
Our viewers love it
when a fixer-upper

560
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,895
comes together like this.

561
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,329
Well, I really
couldn't have done

562
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:53,764
any of this without Goran.

563
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,499
He's done so much.

564
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,301
And not just with the house.

565
00:23:57,303 --> 00:24:01,238
I feel like now that
we're together, he's, um,

566
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,341
he's helped me become
who I was really meant to be.

567
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:05,276
You know, two years I spent

568
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,343
on a Canadian
home renovation show

569
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:08,379
and they never got anywhere
close to this level of work.

570
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:11,182
You and Goran should
be really, really proud.

571
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:13,584
Well, if you guys like what
I've done with the kitchen,

572
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,619
I can't wait to
show you the cellar.

573
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,955
Ah, that will have
to wait until tomorrow.

574
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,291
It's getting late and we need to get back to town.

575
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,359
Kate, come on.
No, you know the roads, let's...

576
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:25,996
No, well, I just saw you
looking at him a little bit.

577
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,332
If you think he's cute,
you should go for it.

578
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,567
SARAH: I work with him!

579
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:30,134
KATE: Sarah, let's go!

580
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:33,871
I want dinner and bed so we can come back here early.

581
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:36,373
SARAH: Okay.
Will you show me your pottery tomorrow, Becky?

582
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,408
Sure.
SARAH: Okay.

583
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,375
KATE: Sarah!
I'm coming!

584
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:41,812
In Moldova, they say if
you do not like weather,

585
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:42,980
you wait 10 minutes.

586
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,449
It's run, sun, snow,
all on same day.

587
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:46,817
You guys, Becky was so nice.

588
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,586
You know, it's a shame
you didn't meet Goran

589
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:51,555
because he's a real people pleaser.
GREG: Alex.

SARAH: Oh!

ALEX: Sorry.
Oi.

KATE: Watch it, Alex.
ALEX: Sorry.

00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,499
KATE: Great
fuckin' day, guys.

594
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,835
Okay, we go to nice
restaurant for dinner.

595
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,838
We meet in lobby
in 50 minutes.

596
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,374
It's time for shower.

597
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,008
Come.

598
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,844
KATE: I'd say it's
time for a shower.

599
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,180
You are overdue.

600
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:21,952
SARAH: Oh, am I
early, Mr. Abernathy?

601
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,889
I thought we had your interview scheduled for 7:30?

602
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:26,624
Sarah, we still
have 30 minutes.

603
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,759
SARAH: Oh, that'll
be plenty of time.

604
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,528
I only have a few questions.

605
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,595
GREG: To sleep!

606
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:34,098
SARAH: You can try to sleep,
but I'm not goin' away

607
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,000
until I get my story.

608
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,504
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

609
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:41,272
SARAH: Wow.

610
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:44,808
Mr. Abernathy, that
is quite unexpected.

611
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,578
May I ask you what the
circumstances were behind?

612
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,014
Well the, uh, the terms
of the settlement agreement

613
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:53,050
prohibit my mentioning
specifics, but, um,

614
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:57,755
there might have been,
uh, an altercation.

615
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:58,556
SARAH: An altercation?

616
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,659
Between myself
and Mr. Torini,

617
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:05,930
during which Mr. Torini's
eye may have become...

So, Miss Ellroy,
viewers are dying to know,

624
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:23,180
to what do you ascribe your
meteoric rise in the film world?

625
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:25,516
Oh, well, uh,
my unique vision

626
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:29,320
comes from a lifetime
of suffering, naturally.

627
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:32,423
I, uh, I had to fall
back on my safety school

628
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:36,360
when Harvard refused me
my private parking space

629
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,796
for my BMW.
Oh!

630
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,065
It was terrible!
The fools.

631
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:41,665
Fools!

632
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,500
I don't like to talk
about it really, so.

634
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,137

has made you the
toast of Moldova.

(LAUGHS) Well, as they say,
only filmmaker Moldova,

638
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,715
best filmmaker Moldova.

639
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:59,316

about Moldova.

You like having
the camera on.

644

I don't
wanna miss anything.

645
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,203
Like what?

646
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,544
Um, what is all
this news about Goran?

647
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:31,115
(LAUGHS) Seriously?

648
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:32,583
(LAUGHS) Yes.

649
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:37,688
All right, um, okay, you want, uh,
come on, I'll show ya.

650
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,222
Okay.

651
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40,958
I won't! Not even,
not even like one single breath.

652
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,762
If you, if you say one thing to Kate,
and you get us fired...

00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:46,497
(STAMMERS) I don't
even know what I'll do.

I will, I will sell you to
Vladimir is what I'll do.

Girl scout's honor.

656
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,436
She's a girl scout on
top of everything else.

657
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:55,039
This is amazing. Now, just remember,
you wanted to see this.

658
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,240
Okay.
All right?

659
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,741
Okay.
Okay.

you seen Goran anywhere?

00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,053
I need him for his interview.

667
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:12,322
No, I haven't seen him,
go ask what's his face.

Greg, my good friend.

672
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,635
How can Vladimir be helping?

673
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:26,003

looking for Goran.

674
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:28,072
Have you seen him anywhere?

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,642
I think I see Goran and
your producer in barn.

Come, I take you.

00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:38,348
So, uh, Alex tells me

678
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,918
you were in Afghanistan.

GREG: He does, huh?

680
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,822
Alex has a big mouth.

681
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:47,958
The reason I ask is
because I have friends

682
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,360
who can get things
into Romania.

683
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,329
And if you have friends
maybe get things

684
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:55,099
out of Afghanistan, we can.

00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,022
It is Friday morning.

855
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:01,224
We are still in Pavlovka.

856
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,393
And check this out.

857
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:09,065
She's been standing
there for like 20 minutes.

858
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:13,737
(KNOCKING)
(GASPS)

859
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,072
KATE: Sarah, let's go!
SARAH: Coming!

860
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,343
Alexi!
SARAH: Look who it is.

861
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,679
Let's not, let's
just not do that, okay?

862
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,180
CONSTABLE: Hello!

863
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:25,282
SARAH: Oh,
good morning, Constable. Good day.

864
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:27,083
SARAH: Sorry about
yesterday at the church.

865
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:30,053
Just a misunderstanding
between people.

866
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,588
Different cultures.

867
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,224
Maybe I visit today.

868
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:38,028
SARAH: Uh, I, well,
I don't think I'd be the person

869
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,162
to talk to about that, but...

870
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:42,666
Uh, uh, Constable,
hi, I am Kate Banks.

871
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:45,202
Hi. Uh, this is my crew.
(LAUGHS)

872
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:48,638
Now, I, I know that they
can be a little enthusiastic

873
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,275
but I assure you we won't
use any of the footage

874
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,110
that we shot in your church.

875
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,979
That would be appreciated.

876
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:59,816
Now I must ask, will
you be finished today?

877
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:03,820
Yes, absolutely, yes.
We would love to spend more time

878
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:06,089
in your
beautiful town, but...

879
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:10,527
ALEX: Well we'd just love to stay in your beautiful town.

880
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:11,528
Jesus, Kate.

881
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,230
What the fuck did
you want me to say?

882
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,431
The guy had a gun.

883
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:18,468
(LAUGHS) Kate, you
think like native.

884
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,003
Gun always wins.

885
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,938
Okay, okay, all right, shh.

886
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:24,474
Okay, now just...
Daddy doesn't feel good.

887
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:25,208
KATE: About last night.

888
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,077
It sounds like you
guys had so much fun.

889
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,713
I wish I would go
in town more.

890
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:32,515
Hey, are you gonna film
absolutely everything?

891
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:34,451
SARAH: Yeah, it's
just something we do.

892
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,353
KATE: So we've got six more
hours of good light.

893
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:40,090
Guys, get set up.
Sarah, you're with me, come on.

894
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:40,657
SARAH: Okie-doke.

895
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:44,694
KATE: Becky, I think it's great right by that tree.
Let's get a close up.

896
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:48,798
Uh, just be natural.

897
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:51,468
Right, okay, uh...

898
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:54,838
SARAH: (LAUGHS) Perfect.

899
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:59,209
All right, so, uh,
to camera. Okay.

900
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,478
Do you have a lot
of neighbors close by?

901
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,981
No, my nearest neighbor
is about two miles away.

902
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:08,885
And do you have them over?
Do you have dinner parties with them?

903
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:10,186
I think they think I'm weird.

904
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:12,422
Like, who would live
all the way out here

905
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:13,056
if they didn't have to?

906
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:15,792
SARAH: Oh, they don't
find country life romantic?

907
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,927
(LAUGHS) Yeah, no,
guess not. (SARAH LAUGHS)

908
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,297
I have some ferns,
of course, you know.

909
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,432
Um, very hot peppers.

910
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:25,935
Um, I have, uh, mandrake.

911
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,905
SARAH: Mmm, growin'
some aphrodisiacs, huh?

912
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:31,775
KATE: Okay, we're done.
Sarah!

913
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,476
I know that you're
Wallace's niece,

914
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,713
but out here I'm your fuckin' boss.
I was tryin' to help, Kate.

915
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,782
Sarah, shut the fuck up.
ALEX: Oh, come on, Kate.

916
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:41,818
I know that you just graduated
from film school and you think

917
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,688
that you know everything,
but you don't.

918
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,089
Okay? You don't.

919
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:48,458
And the only way that
you're going to learn

920
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,727
is by keeping your
fucking mouth shut

921
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:53,530
and watching the professionals do their jobs.

922
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,131
You understand?

923
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,967
Do you understand?

924
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:01,104
ALEX: Sarah, are you okay?

925
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:04,107
Just stay out of her way,
stick with us for a while,

926
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:08,111
let her calm down.
All right? Okay.

927
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,715
It isn't all bad, I promise.

928
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:13,616
SARAH: Are you guys
sure I'm not in the way?

929
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,452
ALEX: No, you're okay.
BECKY: Hey, guys.

930
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:16,419
GREG: Hey.
ALEX: Yo.

931
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,754
Are you filming
the cellar now?

932
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:19,255
Uh, we're not,
we're gonna shoot the ground floor

933
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:22,058
while the light's good,
but later, yeah, for sure.

934
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:23,827
Okay.

935
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:26,763
GREG: I promise we'll get to it.
BECKY: Okay.

936
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:30,100
Fuckin' cutie patootie.
ALEX: Mmm-hmm.

937
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:31,034
Uh-huh.

938
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,470
SARAH: What, Alex,
is she your type?

939
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:35,372
(LAUGHING)

940
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,474
I wanna get this fireplace but I'm thinkin'

941
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:40,076
that hot spot off the window,
it's not gonna look good.

942
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:41,244
ALEX: How the
fuck did I do this?

943
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:43,947
Uh, you can just shoot it
from where she's standing.

944
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,148
Yeah.

945
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,083
SARAH: Yeah, it
looks great from here.

946
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:49,686
GREG: I need the reflectors.

947
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:50,420
How's that?

948
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:51,788
That's better.
Becky, in your own time.

949
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:56,359
And it, it's just, I mean,
the whole house smells warm.

950
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:59,262
The food comes out, like,
beautifully just because...

951
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,164
Pump, I don't know if
you remember before

952
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,232
but the water was,

953
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,567
you know, kinda came out
dripping and kinda green.

954
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,803
And all of this wood
here is salvaged wood

955
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:12,409
so everything is getting
a renewed life, you know?

956
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:15,345
So Goran did so much
on the outside here.

957
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:18,548
The staining,
detailing, these slats.

958
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:22,619
Anyway, um, if you come inside,
I can show you some of my work.

959
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:23,753
Here.

960
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:28,124
Um, ooh,
and this fire I have to tend to constantly.

961
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,526
Placement really
matters, you know.

962
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:32,695
It's not like working with
a commercial kiln at all

963
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:33,663
but it's really cool.

964
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:38,701
You know, uh, you go back to the old ways,
be part of tradition.

965
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:41,971
And the best part is, um,
I made myself something

966
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:45,475
to remind me of how it was
when we first got here.

967
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:47,710
And here's my little friend.

968
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:51,414
SARAH: Oh, it's the cat
from the first segment.

969
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:54,551
That is so cute.
Jesus fucking Christ.

970
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,152
Go make yourself useful.

971
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:58,121
And go get me
some B roll shots.

972
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:02,392
All right, shoot some
fucking trees, some cows.

973
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,861
Just get the fuck
outta my face.

974
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:14,070
SARAH: I paid
$150,000 at film school

975
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,905
to film trees.

976
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:18,808
We got it, we got
the B roll you needed.

977
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,276
We got this big-ass stump.

978
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:22,879
Want some B roll
of some stray dogs?

979
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:24,414
Here you go.

980
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,249
The barn of passion.

981
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:29,385
Transformed from a
place where animals eat

982
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:33,556
into a warm and
stylish fuck pad.

983
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,525
Fink.

984
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:43,666
Huh, looks like Becky
ran outta steam.

985
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:51,641
Ah, hello, <i>Senor</i> Frog.
(FROG CROAKS)

986
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:01,951
Whoa.

987
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,489
What the hell is that?

988
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:08,458
(FROGS CROAKING)

989
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:15,398
(STATIC HISSES)

990
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:20,870
ALEX: Who's a good dog?

991
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,305
Who's my good boy?

992
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:23,740
You wanna be a TV star?
SARAH: Alex.

993
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:27,076
ALEX: I do, Alex.
I do wanna be a TV star. Alex.

994
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:30,013
What's up?
Something's wrong with the camera.

995
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,048
ALEX: Oh great,
Kate's gonna love that.

996
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,218
Just go show it to Greg.
He's inside setting up a shot.

997
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,422
ALEX: Good boy want a Doina?
Does a good boy wanna Doina?

998
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:41,925
What's this? It's a Doina.

999
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:44,294
Yeah, you don't like Doina?

1000
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:48,665
Uh, Greg, there's something
wrong with the camera.

1001
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:51,000
GREG: Let's take a look.

1002
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:54,404
Did you try turning it off and on?
Sometimes that works.

1003
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:55,605
SARAH: Yes.

1004
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:57,974
Well, it looks
like it's working.

1005
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,543
It was totally
fritzing out before.

1006
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:03,613
Yeah, well,
looks good to me now.

1007
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:08,051
So, uh, what are
you doin' later?

1008
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:12,322
I don't know,
I got this thing.

1009
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:13,389
Yeah.
What?

1010
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:15,625
Bumpy ride, bad food.

1011
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:17,126
Oh, the bumpy ride,
bad food thing.

1012
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:19,529
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, I've got one of those, too.

1013
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:20,597
Yeah.

1014
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:21,431
How 'bout after that?

1015
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:24,233
KATE: Isn't gonna get
this done, so here we go.

1016
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:26,636
How hard could this be?

1017
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,375
Ah, excuse me, yes,
I am Kate Banks,

1018
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:35,878
host and producer of
<i>Home Hunters Global.</i>

1019
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,981
I know.
Oh, I've got more fans.

1020
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:41,951
Okay. (LAUGHS) Oh,
you guys are so great.

1021
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:45,622
So, uh, what's your
favorite part of the show?

00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,333
KATE: No, it's
definitely not okay.

1189
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:45,501
Tomorrow, we finish
up at Becky's

1190
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:46,669
and we head straight
to the airport.

1191
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:49,171
Kate, we've all been there, okay?
Just back off.

1192
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:51,140
KATE: I didn't come
to this shithole

1193
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:52,408
to get into
a stupid bar fight.

1194
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,310
ALEX: Yeah, why did
we come to this shithole?

1195
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:57,213
Ugh, Greg, are you
still filming?

1196
00:51:57,215 --> 00:51:59,281
Turn that fucking
thing off.

1197
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,657
Bitch.

1198
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,062
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

1199
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:50,232
No, they've been here
since this morning.

1200
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,568
You guys didn't hire
them or anything?

1201
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,303
They're not, I thought,
maybe extras or something?

1202
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:56,372
SARAH: Mmm-mmm.
Sarah, do me a favor, don't point

1203
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:57,907
the camera directly
at them.

1204
00:52:57,909 --> 00:52:58,607
SARAH: Okay, sorry.

1205
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,609
Kate, call it, please. I mean,
should we get in touch

1206
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:03,112
with that constable?
What are we doing?

1207
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:04,413
I have no signal.
ALEX: Great.

1208
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:06,949
Same.
Maybe I should just go talk to them.

1209
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:07,883
I'm sure it'll be fine.
ALEX: No.

1210
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:11,253
No, let's just do our jobs
and get out of here quickly.

1211
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:14,089
Please? I agree,
let's shoot it, let's, uh, go home.

1212
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:16,258
ALEX: Oh, fuck me.
We'll be fast, okay?

1213
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,359
Fine, fine.
KATE: Come on.

1214
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,260
We can get this done.
Alex, camera.

1215
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:19,862
Let's do it fast and
let's get outta here

1216
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,898
before they go all
<i>Deliverance</i> on our asses.

1217
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,967
KATE: Uh, Becky, do you
have a paring knife?

1218
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,536
Big knives look
threatening on camera.

1219
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,905
Oh, uh, yeah,
of course.

1220
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:31,373
Um...

1221
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:34,109
Perfect.

1222
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:37,279
Jeez. (CHUCKLES)

1223
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:39,448
Yeah.

1224
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:42,351
Let's get a nice
shot of these.

1225
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,588
Ooh, that's really creepy.
Make sure to get that.

1226
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:49,258
And there's a couple of things I wanted in the bedroom.

1227
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,326
GREG: Drop your boom, Alex.
ALEX: Yeah.

1228
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:54,563
So I really couldn't have done
any of this without Goran.

1229
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:57,166
Here we go!

1230
00:53:57,168 --> 00:53:58,701
So excited to show you.

1231
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:00,002
GREG: Oh, that's cool.

1232
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:00,603
BECKY: Come on down.

1233
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:02,705
SARAH: I'm sad I
didn't get to meet Goran.

1234
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:04,773
BECKY: I know,
but his plane doesn't even get in

1235
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:05,274
until tomorrow.

1236
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:07,476
ALEX: Holy crap, Becky.
KATE: Oh, my God.

1237
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:08,410
Wow!
Becky?

1238
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,446
Holy shit. GREG: This is great,
did you paint this?

1239
00:54:10,448 --> 00:54:13,382
BECKY: No, can you believe
anyone ever covered this up?

1240
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:15,251
I sent pictures to a friend of mine in Venice

1241
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:17,987
and he dated the floor to
the time of the Roman Empire.

1242
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:19,188
GREG: Wow.
BECKY: A national treasure in my basement.

1243
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,423
KATE: Oh, it's beautiful.
GREG: I want to get it from over here.

1244
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,993
And what about this wine-stomping vat,
holy shit.

1245
00:54:23,995 --> 00:54:26,395
BECKY: Oh, I just use that to, uh,
store paint thinner

1246
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:28,163
and stuff, you know,
the smell.

1247
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:29,164
Oh, but here's
the best part

1248
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,034
and I wanted to show
you guys all at once.

1249
00:54:32,336 --> 00:54:34,169
Ta-da!
ALL: Wow!

1250
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:35,638
ALEX: Oh, my God.
KATE: Crazy.

1251
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,439
ALEX: Vladimir's
story about the witch.

1252
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,909
VLADIMIR: You, uh, are
very good painter, Becky.

1253
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:43,379
BECKY: Oh, no.
I didn't paint this, it was here.

1254
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:45,281
They've been using torches
down here for 100 years

1255
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:47,750
so it was covered under
all this soot and smoke.

1256
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:49,918
KATE: Uh, Greg,
our flight leaves in seven hours.

1257
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,054
You want to go get all your
gear and get set up down here?

1258
00:54:52,056 --> 00:54:53,389
GREG: Yeah, yeah,
okay, I got it.

1259
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:54,723
BECKY: There's more
on this wall.

1260
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:57,293
I was hoping to finish it
before you guys got here

1261
00:54:57,295 --> 00:54:58,427
and I ran out of time.

1262
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:01,864
KATE: This is an amazing find, Becky,
great work.

1263
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:03,999
Thank you,
I'm really proud of it.

1264
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:06,235
ALEX: I don't know
if I'd wanna sleep

1265
00:55:06,237 --> 00:55:07,269
with this in my basement.

1266
00:55:07,271 --> 00:55:09,171
This is kind of creepy,
don't you think?

1267
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:12,875
BECKY: Oh, no.
I'm not superstitious, it's not scary.

1268
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:13,909
It's just history.

1269
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:15,944
KATE: You know,
I have some friends at the Learning Network.

1270
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:18,814
They might build an hour-long special from this.

1271
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,549
I mean, they'd pay
you of course, Becky.

1272
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:23,585
It will also make
great tourist attraction.

1273
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:24,853
Uh, bed and breakfast.

1274
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:27,856
People from Netherlands
eat this up with spoon.

1275
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:30,159
Uh, you could get rich.

1276
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:32,328
BECKY: (LAUGHS) I'm not
interested in money.

1277
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:32,895
I just want

1278
00:55:32,897 --> 00:55:35,631
everybody to experience it,
every bit of it.

1279
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:37,833
You know, it's funny,
I moved here to be an artist,

1280
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,968
and here I find
I'm not the first.

1281
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,637
Like I'm part of a tradition.

1282
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:44,707
In a weird way, it just
makes me feel connected.

1283
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:46,608
GREG: Hey, guys, guys!

1284
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:49,345
What the fuck?

1285
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:53,515
Wow, so does this
mean we're not getting

1286
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:54,450
our rental deposit back?

1287
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:56,452
How could they have done
this with us right inside?

1288
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:58,320
GREG: Guys, I think
we need to call the cops.

1289
00:55:58,322 --> 00:55:59,588
ALEX: How are we gonna
call the cops, dude?

1290
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:00,723
We don't have any
cell phone signal.

1291
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:03,459
VLADIMIR: There's not enough
people out here for tower.

1292
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:06,729
Oh, God, Jesus.
Becky, can we use your phone?

1293
00:56:06,731 --> 00:56:10,199
BECKY: Um, I, I
don't have a landline.

1294
00:56:10,301 --> 00:56:11,467
KATE: Great.

1295
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:14,136
Can you give us
a ride to the airport?

1296
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:16,905
Sorry, I only have my bike.

1297
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:20,509
Well, so we're
fucking stuck here.

1298
00:56:20,511 --> 00:56:22,044
Should we call a cab or...

1299
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:23,245
Yeah, that's great, Sarah.

1300
00:56:23,247 --> 00:56:24,580
Why don't you walk into town,

1301
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:26,148
go hail one,
and bring it back.

1302
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,284
Well, good luck with that,
because whoever did this

1303
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:29,918
is still out there.

1304
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,121
Oh, God, if they wanted
to start something with us,

1305
00:56:32,123 --> 00:56:34,022
they would've.
We were 10 feet away.

1306
00:56:34,024 --> 00:56:36,458
This is passive
aggressive bullshit.

1307
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,161
I don't know, Kate, it doesn't
look too passive to me.

1308
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:40,996
Yeah, well who's
fault is that?

1309
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:43,799
I told you all to keep
a low profile in town.

1310
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:45,234
GREG: Kate, how are
we supposed to do that?

1311
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,101
We're carrying cameras around.

1312
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:49,037
Start by not filming
funerals, Greg.

1313
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:49,705
ALEX: Wear it live, sister.

1314
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:52,074
GREG: Hey, you know what,
at least I didn't get their dog shot, right?

1315
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:54,777
And this one,
yelling "witch" in the middle of a bar

1316
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:56,412
full of psycho Euro-hicks.

1317
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:58,580
Way to win over
the locals, Sarah.

1318
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,417
Well maybe I should
just fuck them instead!

1319
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:04,186
You little bitch!

1320
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:06,321
GREG: Hey, hey, hey, Sarah!

1321
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:08,424
VLADIMIR: Don't
fight, don't fight, stop.

1322
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:09,925
ALEX: No, no, no, no, guys.

1323
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:11,527
VLADIMIR: Stop!

1324
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:13,896
I go, I go to town.

1325
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,032
Everyone loves Vladimir.

1326
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:20,235
It will take me a while,
but I will get help.

1327
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:22,938
ALEX: Are you serious,
you wanna go out there?

1328
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:26,742
Only volunteer
is best volunteer.

1329
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:32,214
There's just a
few things in here.

1330
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:33,348
In case you need 'em.

1331
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,784
Thank you. KATE: Vladimir,
this is for the car.

1332
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,020
I bring back change.

1333
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:41,223
ALEX: Dude, I
want you to have that

1334
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:43,091
in case of emergencies.

1335
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:44,760
KATE: Wow.

1336
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:46,628
(SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE)

1337
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,230
GREG: Later, brother.

1338
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:49,565
Bye.

1339
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,366
Oh.
KATE: The fuck?

1340
00:57:51,368 --> 00:57:53,702
My heart attack!
(GROANS)

1341
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,871
No, kidding, just kidding!

1342
00:57:55,873 --> 00:58:00,042
I kid, I be okay,
don't worry. (VOCALIZES)

1343
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:09,818
Tension relief, fail.

1344
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,186
(GREG CHUCKLES)

1345
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:12,654
So it kinda looks like rain.

1346
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,122
Anybody want some coffee?

1347
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:14,756
Yes, please.

1348
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:16,024
KATE: Yeah, that
would be great.

1349
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:19,261
BECKY: I'll make it.
SARAH: All in.

1350
00:58:19,964 --> 00:58:23,031
ALEX: All right, let's dance, lady.
I call. What you got?

1351
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:27,035
SARAH: Two pairs,
number eight. ALEX: You bitch.

1352
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,737
Good hand.

1353
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,673
Not as good as five
Vladimirs though.

1354
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:32,741
Yeah, sorry.

1355
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:35,177
SARAH: Have you been playing
with those cards the entire time?

1356
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,645
ALEX: Read 'em and weep.

1357
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:40,249
KATE: Wallace is gonna
hit the roof over this.

1358
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:43,719
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

1359
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:55,197
This is one of my... See,
I love this guy, he's great.

1360
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:57,232
Uh, you know, this is...

1361
00:58:57,234 --> 00:58:59,401
I lost my virginity
to that guy.

1362
00:58:59,403 --> 00:59:02,204
What does that mean,
"Assuming the bridge is okay"?

1363
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:05,674
Um, well,
last spring there was, uh...

1364
00:59:05,676 --> 00:59:06,909
It washed out a little bit.

1365
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:10,345
But I think it'll be okay.
It washed out?

1366
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:13,749
Oh, shit,
I mean it's not raining that hard right now, is it?

1367
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:15,350
No, it'll be okay.

1368
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:16,718
Are you laughing at me?

1369
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,288
Did that sound kind of
panicked when I said that?

1370
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:22,524
I meant that to be more of, like,
a masculine kind of, like,

1371
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:23,025
"It's not raining."

1372
00:59:23,027 --> 00:59:26,495
You, uh, do this at home?
You have a lady at home waiting

1373
00:59:26,497 --> 00:59:27,796
for you to cook for her?

1374
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,998
If I had a lady at home

1375
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,933
doing this for me,

1376
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:32,968
I'd have no idea
how to do this.

1377
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:33,435
(LAUGHING)

1378
00:59:33,437 --> 00:59:38,340
No, I mean, you know,
I wanna direct my own stuff, I think.

1379
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:42,844
It'd be nice,
not that it's not super fun working for Kate.

1380
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:47,349
Who's just really the nicest lady you ever wanna meet.

1381
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,720
(WHISPERS) She's a bitch.

1382
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:53,522
That's terrible.

1383
00:59:53,524 --> 00:59:55,891
(LAUGHS) She's a bitch.

1384
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:58,126
Not that I don't like it here.

1385
00:59:58,128 --> 00:59:59,528
Not that I don't like it here.

1386
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:02,531
It's just that I
don't like it here.

1387
01:00:02,533 --> 01:00:03,432
(LAUGHING)

1388
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:06,034
I think we can add those
peppers now, you ready?

1389
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,336
ALEX: Dude, you're
gonna, like, pay $10,000

1390
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:09,404
to get one from a scalper?
GREG: No, you just get online.

1391
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:10,872
SARAH: No, I'll
get you guys tickers.

1392
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:14,109
ALEX: What is, what was that?
You'll get us tickets? Mmm-hmm.

1393
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,845
You mean Uncle Wallace
will get us tickets?

1394
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:18,347
That's very nice of him.

1395
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:19,948
I should write him
a thank-you note.

1396
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,584
BECKY: Kate, are you
not gonna eat your food?

1397
01:00:23,487 --> 01:00:25,387
BECKY: Pretty cool.
Like this?

1398
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,723
Yeah, but don't try
to hold it steady.

1399
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:28,957
It's just gonna make
you shake it more.

1400
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,792
Yeah, listen to her,
she went to film school.

1401
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:32,928
GREG: And they
taught her well.

1402
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:36,498
You taped it,
didn't you?

1403
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:39,301
GREG: What are
you talkin' about?

1404
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:40,802
You know what
I'm talking about.

1405
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:43,138
You taped it, you lied.

1406
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,474
You said the camera was off.

1407
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:48,043
Which one of you showed her?
GREG: Kate.

1408
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:48,677
KATE: Alex.

1409
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,345
GREG: All right.
You know what, Kate, don't do this,

1410
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:51,980
not now, okay,
not in front of Becky.

1411
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:55,817
BECKY: Um, maybe
I should just go.

1412
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:59,421
No, Becky, Kate's done.

1413
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:03,825
This is your house.

1414
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,994
You don't have to
go anywhere.

1415
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:10,699
Listen, we'll have
all had a rough day.

1416
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:13,135
Let's try to
keep it together.

1417
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:14,670
Vladimir's been gone,
what, two hours?

1418
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:17,205
He's caught a ride into
town, he's gonna be back.

1419
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:20,175
Really, yeah, when?
Soon.

1420
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:24,112
Becky, why don't I teach
you how to pull focus?

1421
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:26,048
BECKY: Oh, okay.

1422
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,249
SARAH: Put your fingers
like this right here.

1423
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:32,254
I begged Wallace not to make
me come back here with you.

1424
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:39,861
Manganese granular.
You just put it in the glaze

1425
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:42,531
and then it comes
out like this.

1426
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:46,702
ALEX: The rain's definitely letting up.
We should get outta here soon.

1427
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,036
GREG: That suits me.

1428
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,638
It's getting stuffy in here.

1429
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,772
SARAH: Becky, those
are really beautiful.

1430
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:53,942
Thanks, I have a lot more.
You wanna see them? They're in the kiln hut.

1431
01:01:53,944 --> 01:01:55,844
SARAH: Yeah, absolutely.
Let me grab a battery.

1432
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:58,914
There's this really cool
crafts fair in Chisinau.

1433
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:01,049
Once a month, I go there
and I sell my pots.

1434
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,285
SARAH: Yeah? Do you make
a lot of money like that?

1435
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:05,220
Uh, well, not really
because you kinda

1436
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:09,591
have to be there a long time,
but I do sell some and it's pretty great.

1437
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:12,527
Oh, my God.

1438
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:14,996
SARAH: What?
Oh, my God.

1439
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:16,064
(GAGGING)

1440
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,933
SARAH: Oh, my gosh.

1441
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:19,534
Oh, my gosh.

1442
01:02:19,536 --> 01:02:20,535
(CHOKING)

1443
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:22,170
SARAH: Are you okay?

1444
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,009
GREG: We're filming
everything from now on.

1445
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:30,979
We can't let these people
get away with this.

1446
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:32,314
It's fucked up.

1447
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:34,950
We shouldn't have
come back here.

1448
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:40,155
KATE: What the fuck?
Oh, my God! (GASPS)

1449
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:41,723
SARAH: Oh, my God.

1450
01:02:41,725 --> 01:02:43,592
ALEX: Oh, Jesus Christ.
KATE: What the fuck is that?

1451
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:44,493
(FROG CROAKS)
(ALL SCREAMING)

1452
01:02:44,495 --> 01:02:46,995
KATE: Will somebody please
explain to these assholes

1453
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:47,963
that we are Americans?

1454
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:51,333
GREG: Becky, help me. BECKY: All right,
I'm gonna close the bedroom.

1455
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:53,168
GREG: I need
the goddamn hammer.

1456
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,637
Kate, give me
a hand already! Come on!

1457
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:56,538
I'll get the hammer.

1458
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,107
GREG: Go, go, go, go, go,
that's good, that's good.

1459
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,042
KATE: Okay, is there anything
else you guys can think of

1460
01:03:01,044 --> 01:03:03,578
that we can do to, like,
trap ourselves in here?

1461
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:06,648
Look, I would rather be in here than out there,
all right?

1462
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:09,985
GREG: We're safe.
Safe? If they want us,

1463
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:11,386
they're gonna come
in here and get us.

1464
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:12,854
Nobody's getting in
here, Kate, don't worry.

1465
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:14,923
And if they can't come in,
they're just gonna

1466
01:03:14,925 --> 01:03:17,459
fucking burn this place down.

1467
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:21,863
We need to head
out to the woods.

1468
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:25,100
The woods?
Yes.

1469
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:25,967
Kate, we don't,
we don't have any gear.

1470
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,503
We don't even have a compass.
Where the hell are we gonna go?

1471
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:30,438
Anywhere but here.

1472
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,374
Jesus Christ.

1473
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:41,416
Becky, Goran,
you said Goran's coming in tomorrow morning.

1474
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:44,419
What time does
his flight land?

1475
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:46,087
What?

1476
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:48,957
Goran. His flight,
when does he land?

1477
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51,426
Um, 8:00 a.m. He said he was coming straight here.

1478
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:53,195
Okay, 8:00 a.m.,
okay, right?

1479
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:55,463
It's a two-hour flight, Kate.
ALEX: Yeah.

1480
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:56,665
He's in his car by 9:00,
he's here by 11:00,

1481
01:03:56,667 --> 01:04:00,869
noon at the latest. All right,
assuming that he didn't miss his flight.

1482
01:04:00,871 --> 01:04:02,604
SARAH: I'm sure he
didn't miss his flight.

1483
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:04,206
Or the bridge isn't out.
GREG: Jesus Christ.

1484
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:05,473
Or those fucking
maniacs out there

1485
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:08,343
didn't cut him up the way they fucking cut up Vladimir!

1486
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,345
GREG: Enough!

1487
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:13,748
(SOBS) I'm sorry.

1488
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,183
Sorry.

1489
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:21,223
Oh, that's fuckin' great,
Kate, that's fuckin' awesome.

1490
01:04:21,225 --> 01:04:25,327
Guys, listen, here's the plan. We're gonna
stay here tonight, we're gonna wait for Goran,

1491
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:27,429
and we're gonna drive
outta here in the morning.

1492
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:29,931
You don't give orders, Greg.

1493
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:31,700
This is my production.

1494
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:35,270
SARAH: We're not making
a show anymore, Kate.

1495
01:04:35,906 --> 01:04:37,105
And yet you're still filming.

1496
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:40,442
That's because we film
everything from here on out.

1497
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:43,245
Everything.

1498
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:47,349
None of you ever liked me.

1499
01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:49,784
(SCOFFS)

1500
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:54,856
Do you know how many times
I covered for you guys?

1501
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,997
You've all been laughing
at me this whole time.

1502
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,603
SARAH: Sun's going down.

1503
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:10,906
Shit!

1504
01:05:13,877 --> 01:05:15,877
(SHELVES RATTLE)

1505
01:05:17,881 --> 01:05:19,981
Just makin' sure.

1506
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:21,516
We need to
get some sleep.

1507
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:24,352
Yeah, that's great,
who the fuck can sleep?

1508
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:26,788
All right, great, man,
you take the first watch.

1509
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,124
Ladies.
You can take this room.

1510
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:31,559
Okay, thanks, Becky.
Listen, Sarah.

1511
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:32,928
I want you to keep
that camera rolling

1512
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,163
and then change the batteries,
all right?

1513
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:35,897
Thank you.

1514
01:05:35,899 --> 01:05:38,833
And, um, Sarah, if you're
okay with doubling up,

1515
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:41,536
