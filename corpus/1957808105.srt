Stay tuned to
sports talk 101.7, The Zone,

00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:53,314
home of your Atlanta Knights.

3
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,404
Coming up, we have reigning
MVP Jordan Gabriel on

4
00:00:56,578 --> 00:00:58,928
to talk about his
record setting season,

5
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,670
and what a year he had!

6
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:04,673
Too bad that with all those
personal accomplishments,

7
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:06,631
he still hasn't found the secret

8
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:09,939
to leading his team to
that elusive championship.

9
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:13,595
All from money.

10
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:14,769
Yeah!

11
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,599
Hey, where's my money?

12
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:21,907
Hey Jordan, you there?

13
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,300
Hello?

14
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:25,259

Sorry, mom.

Honey, you need to study.

31
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:07,668
Your grades have been slipping
too much since we moved.

32
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:09,128
I know, it's just,

33
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:11,435
I can't concentrate,
Mom, I'm so excited.

34
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,394
It's the Jordan Gabriel,

00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:15,178
my favorite player ever!

36
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:16,701
I know, sweetheart.

37
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,399
But if you don't
get your grades up,

38
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,203
there will be no baseball
for you this year.

39
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:22,011
If the school can even
put a team together.

40
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,013
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,755
Really, when we get back, I
promise I'll get right on it.

42
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:28,191
At least an hour tonight.

43
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:30,150
Okay, yeah, that's fine.

44
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:31,977
Okay.

45
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,112
Go get yourself cleaned
up, we need to leave soon.

46
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:35,329
Thank you so much, Mom!

47
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:37,983
Oh, I hope he signs my jersey!

48
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:49,517
Hey, buddy.

49
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:52,172
How you doing today?

50
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:56,872
You're the best, Mom.

51
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:58,046
Totally.

52
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:01,964
Dad would love this, huh?

53
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,138
Yeah.

54
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,533
Hey, how you doing?

55
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:09,014
Ah!

56
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,929
This never happens
to you, does it?

57
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,236
Obviously you're
very special to him.

58
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:18,110
Son, this is the moment
you've been waiting for.

59
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:20,591
I watched you on TV set
the record for passing yards

60
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:22,289
and I was in the
stadium when you threw

61
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:24,247
those seven touchdown passes!

62
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:26,815
You're the greatest
quarterback ever!

63
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,149
Can I get a picture with you?

64
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:30,427
Oh, and can you sign my jersey?

65
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:32,255
This is so cool.

66
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:33,429
It's Lohan.

67
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:37,085
Mr. Gabriel?

68
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:41,786
Mr. Gabriel, can you
sign my jersey please?

69
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,441
It's Lohan, L-O...

70
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:45,790
Right, what, what?

71
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:48,880
No, no dude, it's Jordan, J-O.

72
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:51,795
Silly kid.

73
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:55,235
There you go, little buddy.

74
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:02,372
Hey, honey look,
it's Antwon Race.

75
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:05,027
Come on.

76
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,201
Come on.

77
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,511
Hey, how you guys doing?

78
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,210
Lohan, honey,
he didn't mean it.

79
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:15,733
We just ran out of time.

80
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:34,162
Here's another
snippet from my interview

81
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:35,579
with the reigning MVP.

82
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:38,190
Jordan, you're a
pretty competitive guy.

83
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:39,670
What can I say, Jim?

84
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:41,542
I like to be the best.

85
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:44,675
You know, when I look in
the mirror, I see nothing.

86
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,155
Cause I'm so good,

87
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,983
there can be only one of me.

88
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:50,420
And his ego pretty
much took over from there

89
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:53,205
until I asked about his dad.

90
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,861
Suffice it to say 30 years
with no birthday presents,

91
00:04:57,034 --> 00:04:59,516
and there ain't gonna be
any this year, either.

92
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:21,232
Mi casa!

93
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,279
Mi casa.

94
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:30,678
Well, you're with a superstar
now so get used to it.

95
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:32,244
I still can't believe

96
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:33,700
I'm in the final
three for Magnifique.

97
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:35,726
Like if I get this contract,

98
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,425
I could be on the cover of
literally every magazine.

99
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:43,778
Dude, give me some good news.

100
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,389
Well,
normally 120 million dollars

101
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:47,563
would be great news.

102
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,089
I'm the best
quarterback in the league.

103
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:53,004
I don't play for
number two money.

104
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:55,442
Look, man,
with the cap and all,

105
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:57,095
it's maybe the best.

106
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:58,009
No, no, no, that's
not the best anything.

107
00:05:58,183 --> 00:05:59,533
I'm the best.

108
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:01,839
And my pay had
better reflect that.

109
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,061
You weren't the best in
that Detroit game last year.

110
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:10,457
You cost me a lot of money

111
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,151
in my fantasy football
league that day.

112
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:13,285
Yeah, easy pal.

113
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
Not a good time.

114
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:16,157
Fair enough.

115
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,248
But since you're
the best and all,

116
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,574
why don't you gimme a chance
to win back some of my money

117
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:22,860
that you lost?

118
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:24,314
Come on, Jordan,
let's just go.

119
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,604
That your car?

120
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:28,779
You better believe it.

121
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:30,346
Okay, well mine's coming.

122
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,435
You wanna?

123
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,263
That's a Lamborghini, pal.

124
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:35,786
It's not about the car.

125
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,832
Jordan, come on.

126
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,442
Well, it ain't
about you either.

127
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:40,616
Really?

128
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:43,054
Well I know the perfect space.

129
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:44,795
Lead the way.

130
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,581
Okay.

131
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:04,074
Jordan!

132
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:10,647
Jordan, this is crazy.

133
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,301
Jordan, stop!

134
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:21,615
The Jordan Gabriel.

135
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:25,619
Do you feel the rules
don't apply to to you?

136
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,925
No, sir, they
most certainly do.

137
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,972
Says here you were clocked
at 147 miles per hour

138
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:33,104
and racing another car.

139
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:35,803
Look, it was a terrible
lapse in judgment, your honor.

140
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:38,806
But trust me, it'll
never happen again.

141
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:40,894
Yeah?

142
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,115
That's not going
to work with me.

143
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,075
See, this offense
is a misdemeanor,

144
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:49,860
but it carries a sentence
of up to 90 days in jail.

145
00:07:58,303 --> 00:07:59,957
But I have an idea.

146
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,962
Clearly, money's no object
to you, Mr. Gabriel.

147
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:09,750
And although some
confinement may do you good,

148
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:14,406
I'm gonna give you the
opportunity to help somebody else.

149
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,800
I'd like you to report
to Johnson Middle School

150
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:19,063
for your spring assignment.

151
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:22,718
It's that or jail.

152
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:26,374
That.

153
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,595
Good.

154
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,510
You successfully
complete the program,

155
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,033
I'll dismiss your case.

156
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,731
It'll be as if it
never happened.

157
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:35,905
No.

158
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,385
Thank you, your honor.

159
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:41,303
Report back here in two weeks

160
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:42,477
with an update.

161
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:46,743
That was a miracle.

162
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,571
The contract you want,

163
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:49,745
if you go to jail,

164
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:52,619
poof!

165
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:53,793
Come on.

166
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,187
I can't believe it!

167
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,755
Jordan Gabriel is coaching

168
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,489
the Johnson Middle
School baseball team.

169
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:02,672
Welcome.

170
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,935
Wow, you are huge.

171
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,260
I always thought
maybe the cameras

172
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:07,324
just made you look bigger.

173
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:08,635
Jordan Gabriel!

174
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,421
Oh, I see you met Sadie,
our student teacher.

175
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:15,250
Oh, thank you so much
for coaching our kids.

176
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:17,358
Oh, you know cause we couldn't
afford a coach this year,

177
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:18,775
but thank you, thank you.

178
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:20,469
And anything you
want, anything at all,

179
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,432
I'm your lady.

180
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:24,781
Okay.

181
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:25,955
Can I have my hand back?

182
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,610
Oh! Silly.

183
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:29,351
I'm on my way back
to my classroom.

184
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:30,676
I can show him to the ballfield.

185
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,745
Nope, I got this.

186
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,355
Okay, yeah.

187
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:34,138
All right, well let
me show you the way.

188
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:35,836
Okay, all right.

189
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,465
No one is gonna believe
that Jordan Gabriel

190
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:38,489
is at my school.

191
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:41,165
You know those are
some very big muscles.

192
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:43,191
You must work out a lot.

193
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:44,365
Little bit.

194
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:45,672
Can I feel y'all.

195
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:48,152
Uh, this one?

196
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:49,806
Cause you're feeling
that one already.

197
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
Oh. Busted.

198
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:52,940
It's all right.

199
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:54,898
Well, this is my room.

200
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,423
Oh!

201
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,164
You know what, silly me.

202
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:01,881
Okay, so the field is
to your left over here.

203
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:04,081
And there's the equipment,

204
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:06,301
and yeah, just

205
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,172
do what you do.

206
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:09,434
Look, Mr. Gabriel,

207
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,654
I'm sure you are a very nice guy

208
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,961
and those muscles are,

209
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:15,745
oh, they do tricks,

210
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,919
oh, very distracting.

211
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,662
But these are my kids!

212
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:20,924
Mhmm.

213
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:22,796
And looks can be deceiving.

214
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,755
Now I know what you did to
get here. Mr. Speed Racer.

215
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,714
Okay, and I don't
care about your fame

216
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:30,281
or your fortune
or that physique,

217
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,894
but it's you as much to
sneeze on one of my kids,

218
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,068
it will not cover you.

219
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,723
You're in my world now.

220
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:38,289
Do I make myself clear?

221
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:40,770
Crystal?

222
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,337
Good, all right.

223
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:43,951
Well here's all the
files on the kids

224
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,272
as well as any pertinent
medical information.

225
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:46,336
If you have any questions,

226
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,864
you know where to find me, okay?

227
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:49,997
Oh, and your vroom vroom,

228
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,956
you know, secret,
is cool with me.

229
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:03,358
Baseball.

230
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:06,404
Nah, this is my team.

231
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,537
We do things my way
around here, got it?

232
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:12,497
You gotta be kidding me.

233
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,108
- Got it?
- Stop, guys, chill out.

234
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,676
Look.

235
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,243
Hey, what's going on here?

236
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,550
Now new kid thinks
he can tell us what...

237
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:25,380
Well, because some judge
thinks he can tell me what to do

238
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:28,470
and clearly he can
cause here I am.

239
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:31,865
Tada!

240
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,344
That makes me the new coach.

241
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:35,129
So I'm gonna tell
you what to do.

242
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:38,175
And for starters, you
two need to hug this out.

243
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:47,707
What was that?

244
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,406
You really are Jordan Gabriel.

245
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,581
I better be.

246
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:53,776
I'm wearing his underwear today

247
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,062
so there's that?

248
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:56,236
Good one.

249
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:59,109
Oh man.

250
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:00,981
This year's gonna rock.

251
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,548
Dude, I saw you
threw five touchdowns

252
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,159
in one game last year.

253
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,770
My first name's Gabriel.

254
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:09,554
This is so cool.

255
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,329
Have you ever met
someone that you just

256
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:13,254
idolized your entire life?

257
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,101
Someone you never thought
you'd have the chance to meet

258
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,345
and then you get to
take a selfie with them?

259
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:19,299
Well, get your camera out,

260
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,565
I don't have all day.

261
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,002
Good one.

262
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,917
Anybody else got
anything to say?

263
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,049
Yeah.

264
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:30,793
Does your little sister
know you're wearing her shirt?

265
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,103
Hey!

266
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:37,582
I'm Stephanie.

267
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,280
Would you wanna
warm up together?

268
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:41,630
Sure.

269
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,066
I'm Lohan.

270
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,285
Isn't this awesome?

271
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,070
That's Jordan Gabriel.

272
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:52,772
All right, come on, let's go.

273
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:55,643
Okay.

274
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,604
Hey, kid.

275
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,954
It's Lohan.

276
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:01,868
Good to know.

277
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,042
Jordan Gabriel.

278
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,130
I know, I know, I know.

279
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,697
You're pleased to meet me.

280
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:06,698
Look, kid, I'll even
autograph your ball

281
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:07,874
when practice is over.

282
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,440
But for right now,

283
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:11,573
I just need to see if
any of you guys can hit.

284
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:17,447
All right, line up.

285
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:19,363
Come on, coach!

286
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:20,537
Bring the heat!

287
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,074
Watch it, right here.

288
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:41,168
Yo, coach, that almost hit me.

289
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:42,473
I'm out!

290
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:44,258
Of course, they can't.

291
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,740
Man, this is cool,

292
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,525
being coached by Jordan Gabriel.

293
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,460
Okay.

294
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,333
Can anyone here pitch?

295
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,602
I've pitched before.

296
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:25,865
I'd like a shot at it.

297
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,260
Let's see what you can do.

298
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,054
Whoa.

299
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:42,228
Whoah.

300
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:45,319
Maybe there's some
hope for me yet.

301
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,376
Oh, wow.

302
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:01,725
Hey.

303
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,252
So you're a teacher here.

304
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,168
Yep, that's what they tell me.

305
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,653
Oh, so you're the new coach?

306
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,960
Yeah, well that's
what they tell me.

307
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:30,146
Are you okay?

308
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Yeah.

309
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:36,457
Yeah, yeah, ooh!

310
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,459
So.

311
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:43,236
I think I saw you at
an autograph signing

312
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,333
last week, right?

313
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:46,815
Yeah.

314
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,469
My son Lohan and I,
we just moved here

315
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:50,273
and he tried to get
you to sign his jersey.

316
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:52,516
Oh, I don't remember
signing any jerseys.

317
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:54,474
I know.

318
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:58,870
Oh.

319
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:00,611
Wow, I'm sorry.

320
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:02,787
I must have totally missed that.

321
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,311
It was really busy.

322
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:05,592
I know you didn't
do it on purpose.

323
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:06,835
No, no, definitely not.

324
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:12,536
Well, the kids are really
excited to have you, I'm sure.

325
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,451
They'll have a lot
of fun with you.

326
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,672
Yeah, so...

327
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:24,679
Maybe we could have
time around being fun.

328
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:25,941
What, what?

329
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,290
What?

330
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:28,509
What did you just say?

331
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:30,076
Huh?

332
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,555
You just said something.

333
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:34,688
Hmm.

334
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,525
So I'll see you tomorrow.

335
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:47,354
Well, I'll be here.

336
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:50,182
Okay.

337
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,075
And thank you for
bringing us Mr. Gabriel

338
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,903
so Lohan can play this year,

339
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,513
even if he's a bit of a
self-absorbed narcissist.

340
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,604
I think that's
how mommy said it.

341
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:22,911
Anyway, I also pray
for Mr. Gabriel

342
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,521
and that you'll keep
Lohan healthy and safe.

343
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,133
In Jesus' name, Amen.

344
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:31,746
Kids.

345
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,402
Ooh!

346
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:37,012
Right in the face.

347
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:38,796
Are you okay, Mr. Gabriel?

348
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,972
Yeah, I meant to do that.

349
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:44,019
You're hilarious.

350
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:46,021
Well, good luck today.

351
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:49,068
Ladies and gentlemen,

352
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,113
welcome to the Central
Atlanta Little League.

353
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,507
It's a beautiful
day for baseball,

354
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:55,813
but this is gonna have to do.

355
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:57,704
Looks like it's gonna
be impossible to count

356
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,774
the number of fans
in attendance today.

357
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,604
Literally.

358
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,084
All right, guys.

359
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:07,303
Let's have Lohan
start at pitching.

360
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:12,134
Gabriel, let's put you on first.

361
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:13,657
And John, you go to short.

362
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:15,876
Yo, coach.

363
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:18,662
I play shortstop.

364
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:20,956
Yeah, and in case you
didn't notice, I play catcher.

365
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,146
Okay.

366
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,803
Tell you what,

367
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:29,997
why don't you guys just
go where you normally go.

368
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:31,022
Sounds good to me.

369
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:46,168
Hey, what position
do you play?

370
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:47,342
Bench warmer.

371
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,999
Pine rider, dugout security.

372
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:52,870
My personal favorite,

373
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:56,004
guy who never gets hit
by the ball.

374
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,745
All righty, then.

375
00:18:59,138 --> 00:18:59,964
Woo!

376
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,966
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoah!

377
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:05,882
Go Warriors!

378
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,450
Warriors are awesome,

379
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:08,843
warriors are...

380
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:11,411
Whatever, go Warriors!

381
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,587
Hey fans, it's dad joke time.

382
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:16,677
What has 18 legs
and catches flies?

383
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:18,069
A baseball team.

384
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:21,377
Just not this team.

385
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:22,726
Yeah!

386
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,250
Go!

387
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:26,687
But this kid,
he's one to watch.

388
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:35,522
Hey Brandon.

389
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,611
Do us a favor and don't
strike out this time.

390
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:39,090
Ha ha, very funny.

391
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:40,372
Maybe if you caught
a ball or two,

392
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:41,571
we wouldn't lose every game.

393
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:42,790
Was I talking to you?

394
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:44,531
No, you were talking to me.

395
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,881
Guys, enough, stop!

396
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,230
Look.

397
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:51,058
Just all of you,

398
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:53,278
play better.

399
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,018
Come on.

400
00:19:57,805 --> 00:20:00,111
If you want a hot dog,
now's the time to get it.

401
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:01,809
That's why I'm here.

402
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:04,638
Turns out though that
snack mom is a vegan.

403
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,466
She won't eat anything
that casts a shadow

404
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,120
so she only brought us
non GMO, gluten free

405
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,427
cage-free, taste-free
veggie dogs.

406
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:13,951
Mm boy, we'll need a half-caf

407
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,127
sugar-free, organic vanilla
latte with almond milk

408
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:18,652
to wash down that deliciousness.

409
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:23,047
Hey mom, I'll take mine to go.

410
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,832
Hey pitcher!

411
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,549
Hope you're not too
attached to that ball,

412
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:28,749
cause you can kiss it goodbye!

413
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:30,185
Sayonara!

414
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:33,449
And we can actually
win this game.

415
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:34,623
Hey, Willie!

416
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:36,974
Yeah, coach?

417
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:38,148
Just hit a homer.

418
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,807
Thanks, coach.

419
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:45,374
Would have never
thought of that.

420
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:51,118
Strike!

421
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:58,648
Hits a shot deep to left.

422
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,222
It's going, it's going.
Foul ball!

423
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,522
Oh, just foul.

424
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:03,696
You're kidding.

425
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:04,959
What a shot.

426
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:12,271
Come on, Willie.

427
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:13,794
Win this game, he'll come.

428
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:15,795
He'll come back.

429
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:20,801
Strike three, batters out.

430
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:23,369
And that's the game, folks.

431
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,196
When am I ever
gonna catch a break?

432
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:39,559
I'm so sorry.

433
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:40,733
Okay, I didn't mean it.

434
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:41,952
It was, it was an accident.

435
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:53,355
I'm thinking making
a joke right now

436
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:57,141
would be a little inappropriate.

437
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:02,712
Look, I doubt you got to
where you are on football

438
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:03,886
in a year or two.

439
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:10,894
The way I see it, you could be
a real game changer for them.

440
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:12,896
Okay, but maybe not right now.

441
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,117
You poor thing,
you need some ice.

442
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,510
But I'm a believer.

443
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:21,862
Don't give up on
them, or yourself.

444
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:25,518
Mr. Gabriel.

445
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:26,910
How's it going?

446
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:28,521
Painful, your honor.

447
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:32,742
Look, I'm not sure what
you're expecting of me here.

448
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,658
I'm expecting you
to help these kids.

449
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,836
I'm not sure anybody
can help these kids, man.

450
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,664
They might be a lost cause.

451
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:46,060
There's no such thing as
a lost cause, Mr Gabriel.

452
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:51,326
What is a hero?

453
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:53,588
I'm sorry, what?

454
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:56,418
Define what a
hero means to you.

455
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:01,902
I guess I'm not sure.

456
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,863
A hero is simply someone
who uses what they have

457
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,037
to help others.

458
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,478
Now, whether you like it or
not, you're a role model.

459
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,131
And all I'm asking
is that you use

460
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:18,745
those talents and abilities
to help these kids.

461
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,705
Commit to something
greater than yourself.

462
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:24,141
Become a hero.

463
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:35,894
I have it on good authority
that you're not taking

464
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:38,112
this little exercise
of ours seriously.

465
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:42,290
I have eyes and ears
everywhere, Mr. Gabriel.

466
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:47,208
You're not going to be
able to skate through this.

467
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:53,475
And to help incentivize you

468
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:56,478
to stop wasting your
talent and my time,

469
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:58,175
you'll win the city championship

470
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:02,005
or you will still
serve your jail time.

471
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,790
Oh, it's gonna take a miracle.

472
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:08,142
Then I suggest you
step up to the plate

473
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:09,752
and become that miracle.

474
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,627
You have a chance to stand
in the gap for these kids.

475
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:16,889
You're dismissed.

476
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:24,158
Hey.

477
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,160
Have you heard from
any other agents here?

478
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:27,334
No, not yet.

479
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:31,513
Jordan, 120 is literally
every penny they have

480
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:32,687
under the cap.

481
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:34,385
No.

482
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,344
Is anybody else throwing 56 TDs

483
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,017
and hitting practice
reps the next day?

484
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,521
Who else is in the
gym every night?

485
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:41,305
That's my money.

486
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
I earned it.
Okay.

487
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,047
Jordan, everybody knows

488
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:45,941
you're the hardest
working dude in football.

489
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:48,878
But if you don't win
that championship,

490
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:51,881
I can't get you a contract.

491
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:56,886
Jordan.

492
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,635
I need this taken care of.

493
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,047
The next phone
call I get from you

494
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:09,508
had better be about my money.

495
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,036
What's the hold up?

496
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:20,257
Hey, that was fast.

497
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:22,738
Well, I aim to please?

498
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:24,740
But what?

499
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:26,525
Sorry, man.

500
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:28,067
I thought you were Sebastian
with contract news.

501
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:29,310
Oh.

502
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:30,964
No such luck.

503
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:32,139
How you doing?

504
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,358
Fine.

505
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,273
You know, it'll come through.

506
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,798
Like you always say
gotta have faith, right?

507
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:41,627
Yeah.

508
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,498
That's not how that
works or what I meant.

509
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:46,066
How are you doing?

510
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:49,721
Honestly, bud,

511
00:25:51,114 --> 00:25:52,114
I've been better.

512
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:54,508
The baseball?

513
00:25:58,469 --> 00:26:00,428
Maybe this is all
just an opportunity

514
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,256
to get past your history there.

515
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,346
I think you might be the perfect
person to help these kids.

516
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
You know,

517
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:10,394
this is all just tryouts
for the big leagues.

518
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:14,398
You're talking about
heaven again, right?

519
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:18,054
You know I don't
believe in that anymore.

520
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:20,361
I know.

521
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:21,841
I was there when he left you.

522
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:27,324
It's hard to believe in a
father that you can't see,

523
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:28,867
especially with the
one that you could

524
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:30,284
but was never there for you.

525
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:36,363
I know you don't believe
in God right now,

526
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:38,161
but he believes in you.

527
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:41,600
And brother, he wants a
relationship with you again.

528
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,865
Look, bud.

529
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,388
I'm only a phone call away.

530
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:49,258
I'm praying for you.

531
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:57,441
What are you drawing over there?

532
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:11,064
That's John Smoltz.

533
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:12,282
Yep.

534
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,545
Guys, great week of practice.

535
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,080
As in hall of
Famer, John Smoltz?

536
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:17,766
Mhmm.

537
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,289
Really proud of you.

538
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:20,726
Cy Young winner.

539
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,641
Right.

540
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:24,357
Remember in this game, the
fundamentals we worked on,

541
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:26,732
just be loose, be
live and ready.

542
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:28,821
Probably the best
to play the game.

543
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:30,387
Yo, this isn't helping.

544
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:32,388
All right?

545
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:33,173
Remember, have fun.

546
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:34,130
Lions on three.

547
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:35,304
Go Lions!

548
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:38,569
Dude, we don't have a chance.

549
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:40,833
Alrighty then.

550
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,007
Good pep talk.

551
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:43,138
Let's do this every game.

552
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,056
Hey, John!

553
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:50,712
Okay guys.

554
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:52,322
Look, I'm really
proud of you, okay?

555
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:53,715
For what, coach?

556
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,238
Yeah, we stink.

557
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:58,720
Okay.

558
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,872
Let's just remember what we
practiced this week, okay?

559
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,637
What exactly was that, coach?

560
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,857
You didn't really work
on anything with us.

561
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,644
All right.

562
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:11,298
Then let's just go
have fun out there.

563
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,039
Come on guys, you
can do this, come on.

564
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,104
Strike three!

565
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:37,411
Hurray, good job, guys!

566
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:38,585
Hey, pitcher.

567
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:41,371
Yeah, great job, good pitch.

568
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:55,515
Strike one!

569
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,909
Oh, come on, Willie.

570
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,259
Coach, he's
trying way too hard.

571
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:00,782
He just needs to relax.

572
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:03,653
Time!

573
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:08,747
Look, bud.

574
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:10,289
I know how cool it
is to be the hero

575
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:11,837
with everybody watching.

576
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:14,578
But look, we've got runners
in scoring position.

577
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,972
So just settle in, relax.

578
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:19,105
Take a deep breath.

579
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,323
Just get a hit.

580
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:24,501
Not everybody's watching.

581
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:26,938
What?

582
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:30,986
Never mind.

583
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
I got it, coach.

584
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:43,303
There's a deep shot!

585
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:45,566
It's going, it's going.

586
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,178
It's gone!

587
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:03,845
Hey, bud.

588
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:06,195
That is one for the books, man.

589
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:07,631
What a shot, folks.

590
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,372
I'm actually glad I came today.

591
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:11,505
Man, that kid can hit.

592
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,159
And he ties the game up.

593
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:19,165
Man, I have got
to win this game.

594
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:21,297
Hey, you're up man.

595
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:24,083
You go get 'em.

596
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:26,975
Bottom of
the six, then final inning,

597
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:28,304
Warriors up by one.

598
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:30,437
Come on, guys.

599
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:35,528
Ball!

600
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:42,405
Ball.

601
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,580
Come on, Lohan!

602
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:44,581
Your arm's better than that!

603
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:45,844
Come on man, bring it.

604
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:49,586
You're doing a good job, babe.

605
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:02,904
Ball four, take your base.

606
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:07,342
Time.

607
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:11,739
Hey, what's going on?

608
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,045
I need to win this game.

609
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:15,786
Coach, I can do this.

610
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:17,223
Seriously, I'm fine.

611
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:19,747
Yeah.

612
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,314
Deshawn.

613
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:23,359
Hey, I like the
attitude, I really do,

614
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,492
but I've got way too
much on the line here.

615
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,407
Look, you'll get 'em next time.

616
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,371
All right, little
buddy, take us home.

617
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,417
Coach, you sure about this?

618
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:39,114
Yeah.

619
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:40,613
You were the pitcher before
Lohan got here, right?

620
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:41,334
Yeah, but...

621
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:42,552
But nothing.

622
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:43,945
Take us home, I need this win.

623
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:55,391
Coach, Lohan told me to
come out here for some reason

624
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:58,220
and I'm totally
cool just going back

625
00:31:58,394 --> 00:31:59,589
and keeping the old
bench warm for you.

626
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:00,613
Yeah.

627
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:04,531
Brandon, come on into first.

628
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:06,141
I need you to go
stand out there.

629
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:07,577
And do what?

630
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:08,751
Hopefully nothing.

631
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,321
Well, well, well,
here's a head scratcher.

632
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:15,542
The coach just replaced one
of the only kids on the team

633
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:18,327
who even realizes
they're playing baseball!

634
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:19,589
Go figure.

635
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:23,419
Check it out, the right
fielder is chasing a butterfly.

636
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,466
Might be the only thing
he catches all day.

637
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,380
Oh, boy.

638
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:42,351
You've gotta be kidding me.

639
00:32:48,705 --> 00:32:49,705
Uh-oh.

640
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,889
So I've gone from lifestyles
of the rich and famous

641
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:01,892
to an episode of the
ridiculous and inept.

642
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,199
Now that's one
of the craziest home runs

643
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:05,722
I've ever seen.

644
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,594
Wait to use your
head, little buddy!

645
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:08,812
Game over.

646
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:17,125
Didn't you test
yourself before the game?

647
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:19,867
No.

648
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,041
Lohan.

649
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:24,891
I was just so worried
that coach was gonna think

650
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:26,569
that I'm like, weak.

651
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:28,023
Buddy, we are far beyond that.

652
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,529
This is very important.

653
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:30,530
We have talked about this.

654
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:32,010
That can't happen again.

655
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,708
Yes, ma'am.

656
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:41,280
I just want you to be healthy.

657
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:43,411
Buckle up.

658
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:49,722
Son?

659
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,335
You do not get
to call me that.

660
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:55,816
Come on, it's
been a long time.

661
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,991
Not long enough.

662
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:57,992
Could you let it go?

663
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,166
I just want to talk.

664
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:00,254
No.

665
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:02,953
Whatever it is
you're asking for,

666
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:04,128
the answer is no!

667
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:09,960
This is goodbye.

668
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,935
Hey.

669
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,109
Hey.

670
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:30,197
Come on in.

671
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:33,027
How you doing?

672
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:34,201
Fine.

673
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:39,164
So how did practice go?

674
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:40,643
Better.

675
00:34:40,817 --> 00:34:42,341
Been thinking
about what you said

676
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,394
and though it's not all
totally registering yet,

677
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,822
it's starting to make sense.

678
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,520
So, thank you.

679
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:52,525
So I don't see a wedding ring.

680
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:55,005
Safe to assume you're just
too good for their father?

681
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,965
I mean, you are a strong
six, maybe even a seven.

682
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:02,622
Well, it's a scale
of one to five.

683
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:13,937
My husband was a
Captain in the Marines.

684
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,112
Oh.

685
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,291
He was serving overseas.

686
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:20,683
They came under fire.

687
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:24,078
He sacrificed himself
for his friends.

688
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,735
He did the right thing.

689
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:29,909
He was a hero.

690
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:33,695
I'm sorry.

691
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:37,222
I just have a lot going on

692
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,116
and I haven't talked
about that a long time.

693
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,617
Is there something
I can do to help?

694
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:44,838
No, thanks.

695
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:48,407
My parents passed away
a couple years ago.

696
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:50,365
Their house in South
Carolina just sold

697
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:52,099
so I have to go down
and help my brother

698
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,629
take care of some
things tomorrow

699
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:56,545
and I cannot find
anybody to keep the kids.

700
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,719
I'll take 'em.

701
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:01,202
No, I can't ask
you to do that.

702
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:03,683
You didn't ask, I offered.

703
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,119
Are you sure?

704
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,904
Yeah, absolutely.

705
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:11,907
Okay.

706
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:14,127
Thank you.

707
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,411
Good morning.

708
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:04,585
- Morning.
- Good morning.

709
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,630
Come on in.

710
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:08,937
- Wow.
- Ooh.

711
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:14,640
Thank you for keeping
the kids this weekend.

712
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:19,340
Oh, and for taking them to
Michael's birthday party.

713
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:20,689
The address is right here.

714
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,212
Oh, you're welcome.

715
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,694
Hey, guys, hey.

716
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:26,608
Wow.

717
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:27,479
I love you.

718
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:29,176
Yeah, okay.

719
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,222
Listen to everything that
Mr. Gabriel has to say.

720
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:33,702
Okay.

721
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:34,921
Maybe not everything.

722
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:37,140
I really have to go, I'm sorry.

723
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,011
Oh, no worries.

724
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:39,185
Oh, let me.

725
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:42,057
Drive safe.

726
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:52,678
Okay, we can do this.

727
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:56,421
This place is awesome.

728
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:57,857
Yeah, it works.

729
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,079
So...

730
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:06,212
Breakfast?

731
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:08,302
Sure.

732
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:09,627
All right, kitchen's
down the hallway

733
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:11,305
all the way down to the right.

734
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,109
Follow that hallway all
the way down to the left.

735
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,482
Yeah, right.

736
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:15,440
I'm serious.

737
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:16,614
It's a big house.

738
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:19,095
You guys can go.

739
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:20,706
I'll catch up later.

740
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,039
Flip it over.

741
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:02,356
Is this for me?

742
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,403
Well, couldn't have you
wearing a store bought one so...

743
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:07,492
That one's from my
seven touchdown game.

744
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:10,146
Wow.

745
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,863
I hear you asked some
ogre a couple of weeks ago

746
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:14,673
for his autograph
and you never got it.

747
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:17,850
It was a busy day for you.

748
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:19,417
It's all right.

749
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:20,983
No, no, it's not.

750
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:23,812
And that one's
right from the game.

751
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:24,986
It's all yours.

752
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,469
I'm gonna make so
much money off of this.

753
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:29,643
Hey!

754
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:34,257
I'm just kidding.

755
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,085
Thank you so much.

756
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:37,259
You're welcome.

757
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:43,702
All right, eat up.

758
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:49,621
What?

759
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:51,337
You're supposed to
pray before you eat.

760
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:52,972
You pray a lot, don't you?

761
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:54,146
Yeah.

762
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:55,234
Talk to you all, too.

763
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:57,716
Yeah, but, I mean,

764
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:01,154
you guys lost your father.

765
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:05,027
I didn't lose him.

766
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:06,812
I know exactly where he is.

767
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:08,683
He's in heaven.

768
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:11,207
How do you have such faith?

769
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:13,166
How could you not?

770
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,298
Jesus brought my daddy home.

771
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,563
I miss him, but I know that
I'll see him again one day.

772
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:25,395
Let's eat, ready?

773
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,570
Ooh, okay.

774
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:32,185
Any day now, the
food's getting cold.

775
00:41:33,186 --> 00:41:34,186
All right.

776
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:36,231
Ooh.

777
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:41,281
Now I lay me down to sleep,

778
00:41:41,455 --> 00:41:43,457
I pray the Lord,
my soul to keep?

779
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:47,679
What are you doing?

780
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:49,723
Yeah.

781
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,597
It's been a while.

782
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:53,902
You don't say.

783
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,644
Maybe a little help?

784
00:41:56,818 --> 00:41:57,818
Okay.

785
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,604
It's not really hard.

786
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:02,345
You just do these simple things.

787
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:05,174
Put your hands together.

788
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:10,440
Close your eyes and say
what you need to say.

789
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:14,532
Dear God, thank you for this
food and mommy, and Lohan,

790
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,360
and Mr. Gabriel.

791
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:21,756
In Jesus' name, Amen.

792
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:26,544
You have a chandelier
in your kitchen!

793
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:29,111
Yeah, two of them.

794
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:31,070
You look like one
of Lohan's dolls.

795
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:35,422
They're action
figures, not dolls.

796
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:36,858
Collectors items.

797
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:38,468
Sweet!

798
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:39,750
You think I look like
an action figure.

799
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:40,774
Thank you!

800
00:42:40,906 --> 00:42:42,037
It wasn't a compliment.

801
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:42,995
It was.

802
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:43,865
No it wasn't.

803
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:44,649
Yes, it was.

804
00:42:44,823 --> 00:42:45,823
Mmm-mm.

805
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:46,954
- Mhmm.
- Mmm-mm.

806
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,393
Alrighty then.

807
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,568
What's that?

808
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:53,875
That's my protein powder.

809
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,009
What do you do with it?

810
00:42:57,183 --> 00:42:59,315
Well, first they
pay me the big bucks.

811
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:01,535
Then I get the big
muscles when I drink it.

812
00:43:04,756 --> 00:43:06,018
Wait, but it's powder.

813
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:07,802
Yeah, you add water to it.

814
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:10,500
Can I try?

815
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:12,633
Dude, does she
have an off button?

816
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:13,807
Nope.

817
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:17,116
All right.

818
00:43:18,334 --> 00:43:22,556
Okay, so you put in
a scoop of protein.

819
00:43:24,384 --> 00:43:25,472
And for me I need two.

820
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,522
And you add some water.

821
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
And then...

822
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:47,493
Sorry.

823
00:43:50,932 --> 00:43:51,932
Are you mad?

824
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:55,849
Nope.

825
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:04,685
What about now?

826
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:08,428
Where are we going?

827
00:44:08,602 --> 00:44:10,082
Away from all my stuff.

828
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:28,578
Nope, there's only one seat.

829
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:29,797
So what?

830
00:44:29,971 --> 00:44:31,538
You're tiny, you'll both fit.

831
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:34,193
That's not safe. Mr. Gabriel.

832
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:35,760
Look, there's a zero chance

833
00:44:35,934 --> 00:44:37,370
I'm even gonna
scratch this baby.

834
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:38,544
You'll be fine.

835
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,853
I don't think
that's even legal.

836
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:43,027
We can take that.

837
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:48,076
Ha, no, that's a minivan.

838
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,165
That's my pool guy's.

839
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:51,339
Absolutely not.

840
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:58,260
Thank you Mr. Gabriel.

841
00:44:58,434 --> 00:44:59,871
You're very not welcome.

842
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:03,830
Huh.

843
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:14,189
Hey buddy.

844
00:45:14,363 --> 00:45:16,191
You mind typing in
the GPS there for me?

845
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:17,889
I think I got my hands full.

846
00:45:18,063 --> 00:45:21,022
What is this, like six,
maybe 70 horsepower?

847
00:45:21,196 --> 00:45:22,763
Vroom, vroom.

848
00:45:22,937 --> 00:45:24,025
Mom texted.

849
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:26,288
So we gotta pick up Emily and...

850
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:29,944
Stephanie.

851
00:45:30,118 --> 00:45:31,903
Stephanie?

852
00:45:32,077 --> 00:45:33,600
Aha.

853
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:36,385
So that's why you're
wearing that cologne today.

854
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:37,996
What cologne?

855
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,737
The one you're
wearing, what is that?

856
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:43,044
Smells a little
bit like anxiety.

857
00:45:43,218 --> 00:45:44,218
No, no, no.

858
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,875
Ooh, no, that is
definitely sheer terror.

859
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,228
I remember my first crush.

860
00:45:53,402 --> 00:45:55,100
My hands would get
all wet and nasty

861
00:45:55,274 --> 00:45:57,276
and my mouth would get
all dry and sticky.

862
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,494
I couldn't talk.

863
00:45:58,668 --> 00:45:59,757
It was like, today.

864
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,369
I was a mess.

865
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:04,805
It's not funny.

866
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:06,459
Yeah, it kind of is.

867
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:08,273
You're just on the
wrong side of the joke.

868
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:13,509
What'd you do about it?

869
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:14,815
Look just relax.

870
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:16,599
Plus, hey, you know me.

871
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,654
You got that going for
you, that's all you need.

872
00:46:20,603 --> 00:46:22,475
Wait, but she
knows you too now.

873
00:46:22,649 --> 00:46:24,825
Oh yeah, huh.

874
00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:26,348
Well you're on your own then.

875
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:29,830
So, good luck with that.

876
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:34,834
Hey, look buddy.

877
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:36,968
You're a great guy, all right.

878
00:46:37,142 --> 00:46:38,665
You got a lot going for you.

879
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:40,710
She's gonna like you,
don't worry about it.

880
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:43,757
If she doesn't like
you for you, her loss.

881
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:44,976
Just relax.

882
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:47,325
Do it fast.

883
00:46:48,153 --> 00:46:49,719
Cause the way I drive,

884
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:51,694
we're gonna be there at
like 1.5 minutes tops.

885
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:02,341
So Steph says you
cheer at their games.

886
00:47:02,515 --> 00:47:04,517
Yeah, I try.

887
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:06,258
Can I help?

888
00:47:06,432 --> 00:47:08,390
I mean, I could even
teach you some new cheers.

889
00:47:08,564 --> 00:47:09,870
That would be great!

890
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:11,524
We could definitely
use the help.

891
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:18,313
Hey, you good?

892
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:21,273
Yeah.

893
00:47:21,447 --> 00:47:23,057
I ate a big breakfast,
I'm stuffed.

894
00:47:23,231 --> 00:47:25,320
Tell me about it, man.

895
00:47:25,494 --> 00:47:26,539
Hey, just relax.

896
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:27,713
You got this.

897
00:47:28,671 --> 00:47:30,238
Hey, find something
on the radio.

898
00:47:31,587 --> 00:47:33,415
Try 104.7.

899
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:34,939
That's my favorite station.

900
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:49,518
Girls, hey, sorry.

901
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:52,870
Takes a lot of protein to
feed all these muscles and,

902
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:56,874
that one just slipped out
apparently.

903
00:47:58,005 --> 00:47:59,005
Oh!

904
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:05,447
Ew, it's so gross!

905
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:06,729
You should smell it up here.

906
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:09,103
It's burning my nose, oh!

907
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:11,889
That, that is gross.

908
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:31,430
I don't know, man.

909
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:33,780
I'm not so sure these kids
can win a single game.

910
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:34,954
What can I do?

911
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:37,566
That's not the point.

912
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,829
These kids need some
consistency in their lives.

913
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:42,963
Somebody to show them
work ethic, teamwork.

914
00:48:44,269 --> 00:48:46,097
You know, like a coach.

915
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:51,232
Remember what Coach
Siebersman always said?

916
00:48:51,406 --> 00:48:53,539
Become the person
that you needed.

917
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,150
Why don't you try that?

918
00:48:58,718 --> 00:49:01,068
You're headed in
the right direction.

919
00:49:01,242 --> 00:49:02,896
Now just keep going.

920
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:36,451
Look, guys.

921
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:38,038
I just can't coach a
motley looking group

922
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:39,802
of goofballs like yourselves.

923
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,413
So we got a problem.

924
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:43,023
Motley shmotley!

925
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:45,286
I make this look good.

926
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,300
I mean it's kind
of hard to coach

927
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,031
when you're not even
coaching, coach.

928
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:52,337
- That hurts.
- Ooh.

929
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:53,903
Fair point, Willie.

930
00:49:54,078 --> 00:49:55,557
And I'm working on that.

931
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:57,168
Look guys, I'm new to this.

932
00:49:57,342 --> 00:49:59,387
And clearly I dropped
the ball so far.

933
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:00,910
So how about we take a step back

934
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:03,217
and we do this
together as a team?

935
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,567
But if we're gonna
do this as a team,

936
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:07,569
we gotta look like a team.

937
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,790
So head on into Miss Everett's
room for a little surprise.

938
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:13,226
Okay?

939
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:17,275
Yo, what does motley mean?

940
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:18,450
I don't know.

941
00:50:18,624 --> 00:50:19,624
Huh?

942
00:50:36,207 --> 00:50:38,383
Man, you guys look great.

943
00:50:43,257 --> 00:50:44,041
Let's do this.

944
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:45,868
Yeah!

945
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,348
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

946
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:48,958
We're not gonna
practice in these.

947
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:50,351
Go change back.

948
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:51,526
- Oh.
- What?!

949
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:55,486
Thanks, coach.

950
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:31,261
Hey, buddy.

951
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,178
Mind if I show you a new pitch?

952
00:51:34,352 --> 00:51:35,962
New pitch?

953
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:38,225
I didn't think you knew
anything about baseball

954
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:40,358
or even cared.

955
00:51:40,532 --> 00:51:42,360
Well, it's something
my dad showed me.

956
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:45,493
It's about the only
thing my dad showed me.

957
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:48,539
Wait a second.

958
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,500
Ian Gabriel is your dad?

959
00:51:52,674 --> 00:51:54,633
The hall of fame
pitcher from Dallas?

960
00:51:55,721 --> 00:51:56,721
That's him.

961
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:01,770
Look, man, this pitch
didn't do me any good,

962
00:52:01,944 --> 00:52:04,860
but I think it's something
that could help out the team.

963
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:07,254
So it's time I pass this along.

964
00:52:07,428 --> 00:52:08,951
Okay, well thank you.

965
00:52:31,017 --> 00:52:32,540
Warriors on three.

966
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:34,063
One, two,

967
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:36,283
Three, Warriors!

968
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,126
Looks like you're
doing a good job here.

969
00:52:57,957 --> 00:52:59,698
Can I just talk to
you for a minute?

970
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:04,397
What?

971
00:53:05,617 --> 00:53:07,314
I just wanted to
let you know that

972
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:11,013
I'm not feeling too good lately.

973
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,188
Are you sick?

974
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:17,063
No, no, no, you know, no.

975
00:53:19,892 --> 00:53:21,459
Sorry if I really don't care.

976
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,985
You have ever right
to feel that way.

977
00:53:31,643 --> 00:53:33,688
I just wanted to ask
for your forgiveness.

978
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,560
Forgiveness?

979
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:37,518
You want me to forgive you?

980
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:38,692
No, no, no, no, no, no.

981
00:53:38,824 --> 00:53:39,868
Forget you!

982
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,741
It's something you're
really good at.

983
00:53:53,447 --> 00:53:54,753
No, I'm sorry.

984
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:07,113
What's one?

985
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:08,287
Oh, one!

986
00:54:09,071 --> 00:54:10,071
Then two.

987
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:12,640
Three.

988
00:54:12,814 --> 00:54:15,295
Oh, these uniforms
are so cool.

989
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:17,123
I know.

990
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:19,232
I just have to warn you,
I'm not very good at this.

991
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,345
Oh, that's okay,
just follow my lead.

992
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:23,782
Okay, okay, so
we're gonna go up.

993
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:26,263
Up?

994
00:54:26,437 --> 00:54:28,277
And then down, well
kind of in and then down.

995
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:29,962
Willie, turn two.

996
00:54:31,877 --> 00:54:33,313
And it's
a grounder hit to short,

997
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:35,054
fields it, throws to
second for the out,

998
00:54:35,228 --> 00:54:37,622
she fires to first for
the 6, 4, 3 double plays.

999
00:54:37,796 --> 00:54:40,625
Yeah, woo, yeah, woo hee!

1000
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:45,978
Good job, Willie, good job!

1001
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:52,854
Well tune in next week, folks.

1002
00:54:53,028 --> 00:54:54,595
When that kid's
featured on the show,

1003
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:55,770
the best or nothing,

1004
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:58,207
gonna be a really short show.

1005
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:00,035
I heard the burger
shack is hiring,

1006
00:55:01,472 --> 00:55:03,604
Just thinking about
using you as a reference.

1007
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:06,520
That could be a fun job.

1008
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:16,225
All right guys.

1009
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,966
Great job so far.

1010
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:22,014
Look, if we stick together,
we can win this one, okay?

1011
00:55:22,188 --> 00:55:23,320
Hands in, on three.

1012
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:27,367
One, two, three,

1013
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:28,541
Warriors!

1014
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:39,248
I got it, I got it.

1015
00:55:41,076 --> 00:55:42,184
Thanks for coming out,
you know I would have

1016
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,252
never gotten that play.

1017
00:55:43,427 --> 00:55:45,777
Dude, we win as a team now.

1018
00:55:49,868 --> 00:55:52,871
A swing and
a miss for strike three.

1019
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:55,700
Looks like he was swinging
for the fences on that one.

1020
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:58,355
I'm sorry, coach.

1021
00:55:58,529 --> 00:56:00,049
I shouldn't have gone
for the home run.

1022
00:56:00,095 --> 00:56:01,377
I should have just
tried to get on base.

1023
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:03,447
Hey it's okay, all right.

1024
00:56:03,621 --> 00:56:06,145
Look, that pitcher over there
is throwing an amazing game.

1025
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,190
He's got a no hitter going.

1026
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,365
But so do you.

1027
00:56:10,671 --> 00:56:13,108
Hey, I think now's the time
to break out the pitch.

1028
00:56:15,546 --> 00:56:16,982
I think you're right.

1029
00:56:17,156 --> 00:56:18,756
All right, let's
show 'em what you got.

1030
00:56:46,315 --> 00:56:48,230
Strike three, bats out.

1031
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,623
- Yeah!
- Lohan!

1032
00:56:51,103 --> 00:56:53,932
- Good job, baby!
- Good job!

1033
00:56:54,106 --> 00:56:55,586
One two three!

1034
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,805
♪ Our team is boom, dynamite

1035
00:56:57,979 --> 00:56:59,764
♪ Our team is boom, dynamite

1036
00:56:59,938 --> 00:57:01,829
♪ Our team is tick tick
tick tick tick tick tick ♪

1037
00:57:01,853 --> 00:57:04,333
♪ Boom, dynamite

1038
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:06,814
And up to the plate
steps the next stop,

1039
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:07,988
ah, the batter.

1040
00:57:11,123 --> 00:57:12,298
Strike one.

1041
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:15,954
Strike two.

1042
00:57:17,216 --> 00:57:20,698
Coach, that bat
is as tall as he is.

1043
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:23,265
He ain't ever gonna hit
it holding like that.

1044
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,354
Wow, how did I miss that?

1045
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,966
You were probably
on your phone.

1046
00:57:29,271 --> 00:57:30,271
Sorry.

1047
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:32,405
Yeah, don't be.

1048
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:33,580
I deserve that.

1049
00:57:33,754 --> 00:57:35,843
Hey, thanks.

1050
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:37,888
Time!

1051
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:39,542
Elijah.

1052
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:43,697
Hey, buddy, let me show you
how to hold the bat, all right?

1053
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:45,361
I need you to choke
up on it a little bit.

1054
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,594
So bring your other
hand up, this hand down.

1055
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:49,378
Keep 'em nice and
tight together.

1056
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:51,903
This is gonna help you get
the batter on faster, okay?

1057
00:57:52,077 --> 00:57:54,862
Now watch the ball all the
way from the pitcher's hand,

1058
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:56,821
straight on into the bat.

1059
00:57:56,995 --> 00:57:59,824
You follow the ball into the
bat, you're gonna get a hit.

1060
00:57:59,998 --> 00:58:00,998
You got it.

1061
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:04,742
You better believe
I'm gonna get a hit.

1062
00:58:04,916 --> 00:58:06,483
I'm gonna kiss
this ball goodbye.

1063
00:58:07,962 --> 00:58:09,398
And strike three.

1064
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:15,579
Wait, what, he hit the ball?

1065
00:58:15,753 --> 00:58:16,841
Go, go, go!

1066
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:19,147
Go, go, go!

1067
00:58:19,321 --> 00:58:21,062
He hit it, I don't believe it!

1068
00:58:31,638 --> 00:58:32,639
Run, tiny, run!

1069
00:58:34,946 --> 00:58:36,425
He's going to third!

1070
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,166
Look at that little guy run!

1071
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:41,692
I haven't seen this many
errors since yesterday!

1072
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:46,131
No, no!

1073
00:58:46,305 --> 00:58:48,089
No, no, no, no!

1074
00:58:48,263 --> 00:58:50,396
Go back, go back, go back!

1075
00:58:53,051 --> 00:58:54,051
Go, go!

1076
00:58:56,445 --> 00:58:57,445
He's safe!

1077
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:04,628
He did it, woo!

1078
00:59:04,802 --> 00:59:06,412
A truly impossible play!

1079
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:08,632
Like no way that just happened!

1080
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:10,895
Hoho, I've seen it all now.

1081
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:13,680
Oh!

1082
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:16,248
And there is nothing real
left in the world anymore.

1083
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:42,682
What?

1084
01:00:42,856 --> 01:00:44,256
You make no sense
sometimes, really.

1085
01:00:44,292 --> 01:00:45,554
That makes perfect sense.

1086
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:47,382
You're just being a goof.

1087
01:00:47,556 --> 01:00:48,556
- Hey.
- Okay.

1088
01:00:49,297 --> 01:00:51,909
Jordan, how did practice go?

1089
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:53,606
Good.

1090
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:54,389
Spent about an hour
with him this afternoon

1091
01:00:54,563 --> 01:00:56,130
working on math,

1092
01:00:56,304 --> 01:00:58,064
trying to get him ahead
of the test tomorrow.

1093
01:00:58,219 --> 01:00:59,675
Hey I told Lohan I would
show him where the breaker is

1094
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:01,353
so he could fix it
himself next time.

1095
01:01:03,398 --> 01:01:04,398
What?

1096
01:01:06,097 --> 01:01:07,707
He said you tripped a breaker,

1097
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:11,058
asked me to come inside and
show him where it might be.

1098
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:12,669
No, we're fine.

1099
01:01:16,716 --> 01:01:17,716
Okay.

1100
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:23,810
I made more dinner
than we can eat.

1101
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:25,725
You're welcome to stay.

1102
01:01:25,899 --> 01:01:26,726
Hmm.

1103
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,423
Are you a good cook?

1104
01:01:28,597 --> 01:01:29,686
I can hold my own.

1105
01:01:30,556 --> 01:01:31,556
Sounds great then.

1106
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:38,563
Scooch over, tiny.

1107
01:01:43,438 --> 01:01:45,025
Seems you made quite
an impression on them.

1108
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:46,833
Well, they're great kids.

1109
01:01:49,618 --> 01:01:50,663
Mom's pretty cool too.

1110
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:53,492
Why, thank you.

1111
01:02:00,586 --> 01:02:02,631
Sorry.

1112
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:04,938
Little awkward.

1113
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:08,115
I'm feeling like
a teenager again.

1114
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:11,117
I think it's cute.

1115
01:02:12,424 --> 01:02:14,513
Well, at least one
of us is enjoying it.

1116
01:02:19,866 --> 01:02:23,304
You should see
the way this light

1117
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:25,437
makes you look right now.

1118
01:02:25,611 --> 01:02:26,611
Yeah?

1119
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:30,485
Yeah, you look awful actually.

1120
01:02:30,659 --> 01:02:32,139
No, hold that face.

1121
01:02:32,313 --> 01:02:33,464
Seriously, I have to
get a picture of this.

1122
01:02:33,488 --> 01:02:34,488
What?

1123
01:02:35,534 --> 01:02:37,666
No.
I'm joking, I'm joking.

1124
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:40,757
But seriously, somebody's
gotta keep your ego in check.

1125
01:02:41,714 --> 01:02:44,195
Oh, wow.

1126
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:46,110
Yeah, well, agreed.

1127
01:02:47,285 --> 01:02:49,287
But hey, you know,
looks aren't everything.

1128
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:53,900
Though you do have to
admit that these big biceps

1129
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:55,074
are kind of cool.

1130
01:02:57,686 --> 01:02:59,863
I think that a big
heart takes the cake.

1131
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:03,214
Yeah.

1132
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:05,148
Well I'm training that
a little more now too.

1133
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:09,307
You ready for the next game?

1134
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:11,321
Only one win away from
the championship, right?

1135
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:15,139
Yeah, man, I really
hope we're ready.

1136
01:03:15,313 --> 01:03:17,489
Got a lot riding on
these next two games.

1137
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:24,278
Part of my deal with all this,

1138
01:03:24,452 --> 01:03:26,890
is that I have to actually
win the championship

1139
01:03:27,064 --> 01:03:28,892
or I spent some time in jail.

1140
01:03:30,154 --> 01:03:31,590
And I'm gonna lose
my contract and

1141
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:34,811
probably lose everything.

1142
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:38,553
Oh.

1143
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:39,727
Yeah.

1144
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:42,470
I didn't know that.

1145
01:03:48,346 --> 01:03:49,434
Mom?

1146
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:51,740
Lohan won't play
with me anymore.

1147
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:53,003
He ran away.

1148
01:03:53,177 --> 01:03:54,569
Honey,

1149
01:03:54,743 --> 01:03:56,789
Mr. Jordan and I, we're...

1150
01:03:56,963 --> 01:03:59,183
If you don't mind,
I'll handle this.

1151
01:04:03,274 --> 01:04:04,274
What are you doing?

1152
01:04:09,106 --> 01:04:10,107
Yeah, gotcha.

1153
01:04:11,238 --> 01:04:12,239
I gotcha!

1154
01:04:12,413 --> 01:04:13,413
Where'd you go?

1155
01:04:14,111 --> 01:04:14,807
Where'd you go?

1156
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:15,982
Horsie or car?

1157
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:16,896
- Horsie!
- Horsie?

1158
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,070
You know what?

1159
01:04:18,202 --> 01:04:19,202
You're it.

1160
01:04:21,422 --> 01:04:23,685
Woo!

1161
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,992
Get him, get him, get him!

1162
01:04:56,283 --> 01:04:57,283
Hey.

1163
01:04:57,371 --> 01:04:58,451
You guys have helped us out

1164
01:04:58,546 --> 01:05:00,374
a tremendous amount this season.

1165
01:05:00,548 --> 01:05:02,637
So to show my appreciation,

1166
01:05:02,811 --> 01:05:05,249
I figured I was gonna show
you a new cheer or two.

1167
01:05:07,294 --> 01:05:08,600
No offense, Mr. Gabriel,

1168
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:10,819
but you kind of
move like a robot.

1169
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:13,344
Yeah, more like
a broken robot.

1170
01:05:16,129 --> 01:05:17,478
What?

1171
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:19,611
I don't move like
a broken robot.

1172
01:05:21,439 --> 01:05:22,875
Aw.

1173
01:05:23,049 --> 01:05:24,442
All right.

1174
01:05:24,616 --> 01:05:25,922
How about if they show you?

1175
01:05:28,489 --> 01:05:29,882
No way!

1176
01:05:31,623 --> 01:05:32,623
Hi.

1177
01:05:35,975 --> 01:05:36,758
Hey, buddy.

1178
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:37,585
Hey.

1179
01:05:37,759 --> 01:05:38,456
You ready?

1180
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:39,326
Oh, yeah.

1181
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,849
Sweet, man.

1182
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:41,633
Let's get out here
and get warmed up.

1183
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:42,808
All right.

1184
01:05:42,982 --> 01:05:43,591
We got a championship to win.

1185
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:44,765
Yes, sir.

1186
01:05:46,507 --> 01:05:48,596
Today's game is
brought to you by,

1187
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:50,555
Strike!

1188
01:05:50,729 --> 01:05:51,729
Sheer luck.

1189
01:06:01,261 --> 01:06:02,349
Strike three!

1190
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:04,743
Oh, no no no no!

1191
01:06:04,917 --> 01:06:05,917
Oh no!

1192
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,050
Oh, brother.

1193
01:06:16,624 --> 01:06:17,624
Hey.

1194
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:22,195
It's been a really
long game, hasn't it?

1195
01:06:23,196 --> 01:06:24,676
Yeah.

1196
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,983
I do have a little
headache, but I'm fine.

1197
01:06:28,288 --> 01:06:29,855
We've gotta win this game.

1198
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:31,857
That a boy.

1199
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:33,032
Just relax.

1200
01:06:33,206 --> 01:06:35,208
Hey, you got this.

1201
01:06:39,734 --> 01:06:41,258
Last inning,
bottom of the sixth.

1202
01:06:41,432 --> 01:06:42,911
Warriors up by one.

1203
01:06:53,705 --> 01:06:55,054
There it is, yeah.

1204
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:56,228
Great pitch!

1205
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,360
Good job, Lohan!

1206
01:06:57,491 --> 01:06:58,927
One more, just like that.

1207
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:00,755
Full count, three and two.

1208
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:02,888
One more strike and
the warriors are headed

1209
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:04,194
for the championship.

1210
01:07:08,894 --> 01:07:09,894
Strike three!

1211
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,158
Yes, yeah woohoo!

1212
01:07:12,332 --> 01:07:13,812
I don't believe it,

1213
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:15,485
the Warriors are headed
to the championship.

1214
01:07:15,509 --> 01:07:17,076
Great job, Lohan!

1215
01:07:21,776 --> 01:07:23,430
- Lohan!
- Lohan!

1216
01:07:23,604 --> 01:07:25,606
That's it.

1217
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,347
Lohan, Lohan, what happened?

1218
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:28,521
Are you okay?

1219
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:31,656
I forgot to take my test.

1220
01:07:32,961 --> 01:07:33,961
I'm sorry, Dad.

1221
01:07:39,098 --> 01:07:40,098
Lohan!

1222
01:07:41,274 --> 01:07:42,580
Lohan, are you okay?

1223
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:43,581
What's wrong?

1224
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:45,104
Lohan.

1225
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:46,758
Call 911.

1226
01:07:46,932 --> 01:07:48,064
Okay, it's okay.

1227
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:49,978
Just flip him on his side.

1228
01:07:55,897 --> 01:07:56,897
- Hey.
- Hey.

1229
01:08:00,206 --> 01:08:01,425
How's he doing?

1230
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,818
Better.

1231
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:05,429
He's resting.

1232
01:08:05,603 --> 01:08:07,648
He had a complication
with his diabetes.

1233
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:09,694
Ketoacidosis.

1234
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:12,000
His doctor said it
can be very serious,

1235
01:08:12,175 --> 01:08:15,003
even life threatening if he
has another episode like this.

1236
01:08:15,178 --> 01:08:17,005
Life threatening?

1237
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:20,487
Jen, I had no idea
he had diabetes.

1238
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:22,707
You had his medical records.

1239
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:23,880
No.

1240
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:29,104
Oh, wow.

1241
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,879
I'll bet that was in
that stack of papers

1242
01:08:31,019 --> 01:08:32,542
Aretha gave me the first day.

1243
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:35,459
I'm sorry, I...

1244
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:38,461
You didn't look through them?

1245
01:08:38,636 --> 01:08:40,464
No.

1246
01:08:40,638 --> 01:08:41,658
You mean to tell me that he
was out there all this time

1247
01:08:41,682 --> 01:08:43,249
with no one monitoring him?

1248
01:08:43,423 --> 01:08:44,511
Look, I'm sorry.

1249
01:08:44,684 --> 01:08:45,991
You're sorry.

1250
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:47,514
I didn't do it on purpose.

1251
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:51,779
Jordan, I know that
there is so much more

1252
01:08:51,952 --> 01:08:53,737
to you than this.

1253
01:08:53,912 --> 01:08:55,454
But when are you gonna
realize that the world

1254
01:08:55,478 --> 01:08:57,785
doesn't revolve
around Jordan Gabriel?

1255
01:09:01,267 --> 01:09:02,354
Look, you know what?

1256
01:09:02,529 --> 01:09:03,835
Look, I'm sorry.

1257
01:09:06,707 --> 01:09:07,707
I'm sorry.

1258
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:10,970
Jordan.

1259
01:09:37,129 --> 01:09:38,870
How you feeling, honey?

1260
01:09:39,044 --> 01:09:40,523
Better, I guess.

1261
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,528
Am I still gonna
be able to play?

1262
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:46,485
Yes.

1263
01:09:47,574 --> 01:09:49,010
The doctor said you were fine.

1264
01:09:49,184 --> 01:09:50,881
That's why he let you
come home tonight.

1265
01:09:53,014 --> 01:09:54,668
We just have to be very careful.

1266
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,590
Is coach Gabriel gonna leave?

1267
01:10:06,419 --> 01:10:07,681
I don't know.

1268
01:10:10,815 --> 01:10:11,816
I miss Dad.

1269
01:10:58,732 --> 01:10:59,732
How much?

1270
01:11:00,821 --> 01:11:02,127
Jordan.

1271
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,129
How much do you want?

1272
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:05,826
I don't need your money.

1273
01:11:09,134 --> 01:11:10,134
Look.

1274
01:11:11,223 --> 01:11:12,920
I know that I failed you.

1275
01:11:13,094 --> 01:11:15,053
I need you to know
that I'm sorry.

1276
01:11:16,532 --> 01:11:18,692
Do you think that gives
you a right to come back now?

1277
01:11:20,754 --> 01:11:21,754
Probably not.

1278
01:11:23,844 --> 01:11:25,368
You know, when I was little,

1279
01:11:25,541 --> 01:11:27,215
my friends would play
catch with their dads.

1280
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:28,849
If I even wanted to see you,

1281
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,287
I had to turn on the TV
and watch you play a game.

1282
01:11:32,592 --> 01:11:34,812
A game that I have
hated ever since!

1283
01:11:37,162 --> 01:11:38,728
This was a mistake.

1284
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:41,993
Please, I need to make amends.

1285
01:11:45,126 --> 01:11:46,693
Make amends?

1286
01:11:46,867 --> 01:11:48,869
For what, the missed
birthdays, Christmases,

1287
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:51,132
little league,
college, draft day?

1288
01:11:52,219 --> 01:11:53,700
I'm not six years old anymore

1289
01:11:53,874 --> 01:11:55,267
crying myself to sleep,

1290
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:56,881
hoping that you
would walk right back

1291
01:11:57,008 --> 01:11:59,053
through that same door
you walked out of!

1292
01:11:59,227 --> 01:12:00,272
What are you gonna do?

1293
01:12:00,446 --> 01:12:01,708
You're gonna go back in time?

1294
01:12:01,882 --> 01:12:03,188
Teach me how to throw a ball,

1295
01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:05,625
fix my bike, drive a car?

1296
01:12:07,105 --> 01:12:09,585
I spent my whole life
trying to become the best,

1297
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,501
holding on to some
pipe dream that one day

1298
01:12:11,675 --> 01:12:15,112
I'd be good enough that you
would finally come back.

1299
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,507
Look at you.

1300
01:12:17,681 --> 01:12:19,117
You're a washed up has been,

1301
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:22,207
and I'm the best in
the world, the best!

1302
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,380
I don't need you!

1303
01:12:50,757 --> 01:12:52,150
I'm sorry, Father.

1304
01:12:53,891 --> 01:12:54,891
He's right.

1305
01:13:02,246 --> 01:13:07,121
I'm so sorry.

1306
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,822
Then why did you leave?

1307
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:20,047
Why did you leave us?

1308
01:13:26,184 --> 01:13:27,403
Why did you leave me?

1309
01:13:30,971 --> 01:13:33,017
I was chasing things
that didn't matter.

1310
01:13:35,236 --> 01:13:38,065
I lost sight of the
things that did.

1311
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:43,593
It was the biggest
mistake of my life.

1312
01:13:45,594 --> 01:13:50,556
For the first time in my life,

1313
01:13:51,296 --> 01:13:52,296
I've found peace.

1314
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:55,909
Save for one thing.

1315
01:13:59,522 --> 01:14:01,654
And I want you to find it too.

1316
01:14:42,695 --> 01:14:44,523
Where were you, huh?

1317
01:14:45,742 --> 01:14:48,527
Where were you when
Ian walked out?

1318
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:51,269
Where were you?

1319
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,627
Where are you?

1320
01:15:03,977 --> 01:15:04,977
Here.

1321
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:11,202
He's always been here.

1322
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:15,380
You just stopped looking.

1323
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:16,860
And understandably so.

1324
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:22,430
You know, I find those
work better in one piece.

1325
01:15:29,175 --> 01:15:30,787
I went to see Ian.

1326
01:15:31,831 --> 01:15:33,137
He asked me to forgive him.

1327
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:35,573
Wow.

1328
01:15:37,097 --> 01:15:38,184
You never said it but

1329
01:15:39,621 --> 01:15:41,449
I always knew why
you hated this game,

1330
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,670
why you stop believing.

1331
01:15:48,065 --> 01:15:49,632
How do you do it?

1332
01:15:49,806 --> 01:15:53,549
Well, it helps if the bat
actually touches the ball.

1333
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:56,856
I walked into that one, huh?

1334
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:59,076
Yeah, yes you did.

1335
01:16:02,993 --> 01:16:04,690
You've always tried
to be the best.

1336
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:07,824
You tried to earn back his love.

1337
01:16:07,998 --> 01:16:09,782
Love doesn't work like that.

1338
01:16:09,956 --> 01:16:11,356
And then you tried
to fill that void

1339
01:16:11,436 --> 01:16:15,309
with trophies, fame, fortune,

1340
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:17,442
thought you could do
it all by yourself.

1341
01:16:18,661 --> 01:16:21,751
But I think that
you finally realized

1342
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,232
none of that truly
made you happy.

1343
01:16:27,278 --> 01:16:28,278
No.

1344
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:35,721
You've changed these
last few months, man.

1345
01:16:38,071 --> 01:16:40,334
Look in the mirror and tell
me that you're not better off

1346
01:16:40,508 --> 01:16:42,032
after helping all those kids.

1347
01:16:45,121 --> 01:16:47,559
Good thing God gives
us plenty of do-overs.

1348
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:53,130
All you gotta do is learn
from your mistakes, adjust,

1349
01:16:56,219 --> 01:16:57,219
and start again.

1350
01:17:01,355 --> 01:17:03,314
Could it even be that simple?

1351
01:17:03,487 --> 01:17:04,487
Simple?

1352
01:17:05,184 --> 01:17:06,360
Yeah.

1353
01:17:06,534 --> 01:17:07,534
Easy, no.

1354
01:17:08,972 --> 01:17:10,819
But everything changes the
moment you start living

1355
01:17:10,843 --> 01:17:11,843
for other people.

1356
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:21,114
Look, I know your
life hasn't been easy,

1357
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:24,074
being abandoned by Ian and all.

1358
01:17:25,553 --> 01:17:28,556
But you have a heavenly father
who will never leave you,

1359
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:30,646
who wants a relationship
with you so badly

1360
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,170
that he sent Jesus
to redeem you,

1361
01:17:34,519 --> 01:17:35,519
to redeem me.

1362
01:17:37,261 --> 01:17:39,655
Hey, to redeem Ian.

1363
01:17:44,877 --> 01:17:46,096
Life's about relationship.

1364
01:17:47,139 --> 01:17:49,186
With God, with his children.

1365
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:53,277
It simple, but it
ain't always easy.

1366
01:18:13,776 --> 01:18:15,296
I could have never
imagined all this.

1367
01:18:15,386 --> 01:18:18,781
God, it's been
such a great year.

1368
01:18:18,955 --> 01:18:21,075
And God I know I normally
don't ask you for wins, God,

1369
01:18:21,218 --> 01:18:22,218
but this one,

1370
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:24,568
this one is different.

1371
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:26,919
Because it's for coach.

1372
01:18:29,269 --> 01:18:30,357
And God, please,

1373
01:18:32,098 --> 01:18:33,360
please keep me safe.

1374
01:18:35,493 --> 01:18:36,493
In Jesus' name.

1375
01:18:38,539 --> 01:18:39,539
Amen.

1376
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,202
Welcome to the Central Atlanta
Little League Championship

1377
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:53,903
and the end of one of the
craziest seasons I've ever seen.

1378
01:18:56,383 --> 01:18:57,820
Whoa.

1379
01:18:57,994 --> 01:18:59,038
We made it.

1380
01:18:59,212 --> 01:19:00,212
No way.

1381
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,300
Oh yeah.

1382
01:19:03,477 --> 01:19:04,782
This is sweet.

1383
01:19:04,957 --> 01:19:06,175
Whitefield, here I come.

1384
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:07,568
Mamma mia.

1385
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,222
This is so cool.

1386
01:19:11,485 --> 01:19:12,835
Look at all my fans.

1387
01:19:13,009 --> 01:19:15,489
Who told them I was here?

1388
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,365
Hey, Lohan.

1389
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:24,889
You tested yourself
today, right?

1390
01:19:25,064 --> 01:19:26,936
Yeah, yes sir, promise.

1391
01:19:33,812 --> 01:19:35,422
Hey everyone, come on.

1392
01:19:35,596 --> 01:19:37,139
Let's get our hands in,
Warriors for the win.

1393
01:19:37,163 --> 01:19:37,990
Let's win this, guys.

1394
01:19:38,164 --> 01:19:40,079
One, two, three!

1395
01:19:40,253 --> 01:19:41,777
Warriors!

1396
01:19:41,951 --> 01:19:42,951
Let's go!

1397
01:19:47,173 --> 01:19:48,218
Runner on third.

1398
01:19:48,392 --> 01:19:49,552
No score in the first inning.

1399
01:19:52,264 --> 01:19:53,440
Ground ball to short hand.

1400
01:19:53,614 --> 01:19:54,614
Runner goes for home,

1401
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:55,659
can they make the play?

1402
01:19:57,139 --> 01:19:58,402
Safe!

1403
01:19:58,576 --> 01:20:01,318
Safe at home!

1404
01:20:01,492 --> 01:20:04,712
Warrior strike first,
up one to nothing.

1405
01:20:04,887 --> 01:20:07,715
That boy's gonna win this
game for you all by himself!

1406
01:20:16,289 --> 01:20:17,638
Wow!

1407
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,379
Did, did somebody
call for Goliath?

1408
01:20:19,553 --> 01:20:21,773
Would you look at
the size of that kid!

1409
01:20:21,947 --> 01:20:24,036
They say he has a twin brother.

1410
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:25,516
Kinda looks like he ate him.

1411
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:26,690
Wow.

1412
01:20:33,698 --> 01:20:34,698
You're big.

1413
01:20:36,657 --> 01:20:37,833
But are you fast enough?

1414
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:48,974
Whoa, he got all of that one.

1415
01:20:49,148 --> 01:20:51,847
- No!
- It's going and it's gone.

1416
01:20:55,415 --> 01:20:56,764
It's all right, Lohan.

1417
01:20:57,764 --> 01:20:58,941
You'll get 'em next time.

1418
01:21:08,385 --> 01:21:09,821
Yes!

1419
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:11,190
Good hit, that's what
I'm talking about!

1420
01:21:11,214 --> 01:21:12,519
Let's win this game, coach.

1421
01:21:12,693 --> 01:21:14,085
Bottom of the second.

1422
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:15,740
Warriors take the
field up two to one.

1423
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:18,525
Whoa, what a catch by Willie.

1424
01:21:18,699 --> 01:21:20,223
Amazing!

1425
01:21:20,397 --> 01:21:22,225
Man, I'll tell you that
kid's fun to watch.

1426
01:21:31,538 --> 01:21:32,626
Come on, Gabriel.

1427
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,585
Move quicker than that!

1428
01:21:34,759 --> 01:21:37,196
My grandma moves faster
than that, come on.

1429
01:21:38,241 --> 01:21:39,241
It's okay guys.

1430
01:21:39,285 --> 01:21:40,285
Let's focus!

1431
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:44,811
It's been a nail biter

1432
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,597
with a Warriors still up by one.

1433
01:21:46,771 --> 01:21:50,253
But Godzilla is back up to bat.

1434
01:21:50,427 --> 01:21:52,820
Let's see what Lohan's
got for him now.

1435
01:21:55,475 --> 01:21:57,041
Good pitch, good pitch!

1436
01:21:57,216 --> 01:21:58,216
Yeah.

1437
01:21:58,261 --> 01:21:59,261
Just like that, Lohan.

1438
01:22:08,314 --> 01:22:09,707
Hit deep to right.

1439
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,666
That one is drifting,
drifting, foul!

1440
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,103
Wow, that was a close one.

1441
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,245
Full count on the big guy

1442
01:22:26,419 --> 01:22:27,986
with the Warriors
up four to three.

1443
01:22:37,996 --> 01:22:38,996
Strike three!

1444
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:41,869
Good job!

1445
01:22:42,044 --> 01:22:43,349
Way to go, baby!

1446
01:22:44,655 --> 01:22:45,656
Nice job, Lohan!

1447
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,179
What an arm!

1448
01:22:47,353 --> 01:22:49,877
That ball had more moves
than a U-Haul truck!

1449
01:22:50,052 --> 01:22:53,011
And the Warriors
are still up by one.

1450
01:22:53,184 --> 01:22:54,491
Is Lohan okay?

1451
01:22:56,536 --> 01:22:57,842
He looks tired again.

1452
01:22:58,799 --> 01:23:00,671
I don't know.

1453
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,677
Infield fly over third base.

1454
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:07,851
He's out!

1455
01:23:10,942 --> 01:23:12,857
Grounded and short.

1456
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:15,816
He's up for a throw and
just gets him at first.

1457
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:17,514
Come on, guys!

1458
01:23:18,558 --> 01:23:19,558
We have to win this!

1459
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:21,866
Hey, we'll get it back.

1460
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,264
Trailing seven to four.

1461
01:23:28,438 --> 01:23:30,242
The Warriors really need
to turn this around quickly

1462
01:23:30,266 --> 01:23:32,181
if they want to pull
out the win today.

1463
01:23:40,666 --> 01:23:42,539
There's a shot to deep left.

1464
01:23:42,713 --> 01:23:44,628
He's drifting back
to the track and,

1465
01:23:44,802 --> 01:23:47,892
a spectacular grab
against the wall on left.

1466
01:23:48,066 --> 01:23:49,719
And here comes the
throw to second,

1467
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:50,938
not in time.

1468
01:24:00,905 --> 01:24:02,080
Runner takes his leg up.

1469
01:24:02,254 --> 01:24:03,734
Whoa, whoa, what, faked him out?

1470
01:24:03,907 --> 01:24:05,214
- Yes, yes.
- Haha!

1471
01:24:05,388 --> 01:24:06,954
Me too, the old
hidden ball trick.

1472
01:24:07,129 --> 01:24:09,218
Looks like the Warriors
are still in this game.

1473
01:24:13,483 --> 01:24:16,398
Bases loaded, Warriors
still down by three.

1474
01:24:16,573 --> 01:24:18,487
Willie stands alone at the plate

1475
01:24:18,662 --> 01:24:21,012
with the weight of the
world on his shoulders.

1476
01:24:23,797 --> 01:24:24,797
Strike.

1477
01:24:26,235 --> 01:24:27,932
Jordan.

1478
01:24:28,106 --> 01:24:30,195
If you've got some kind of
a miracle up your sleeve,

1479
01:24:30,369 --> 01:24:31,369
now's the time.

1480
01:24:33,807 --> 01:24:34,807
Hey coach,

1481
01:24:34,852 --> 01:24:36,636
his dad no-showed again.

1482
01:24:36,809 --> 01:24:38,769
He didn't even come
to one single game.

1483
01:24:43,556 --> 01:24:47,038
Huh, of all
people to miss that.

1484
01:24:51,173 --> 01:24:52,173
Time.

1485
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,130
Comfort food.

1486
01:25:01,357 --> 01:25:02,619
I know, I know, I know.

1487
01:25:02,793 --> 01:25:04,186
Take it slow.

1488
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,101
Don't try to be
hero, just get a hit.

1489
01:25:07,972 --> 01:25:10,496
You know, you're an
amazing ball player,

1490
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:12,281
but an even more
amazing young man.

1491
01:25:14,282 --> 01:25:16,415
So there's only one
thing left to do.

1492
01:25:16,589 --> 01:25:17,851
Hit a homer?

1493
01:25:18,025 --> 01:25:19,025
Nope.

1494
01:25:20,071 --> 01:25:21,725
Tell you that I'm
really proud of you.

1495
01:25:26,338 --> 01:25:27,338
Thanks, coach.

1496
01:25:28,645 --> 01:25:30,342
This is really good.

1497
01:25:30,516 --> 01:25:31,516
Oh!

1498
01:25:33,302 --> 01:25:35,391
Kind of thick though.

1499
01:25:35,565 --> 01:25:36,696
Got any water?

1500
01:25:38,742 --> 01:25:39,525
Not that I know of.

1501
01:25:39,699 --> 01:25:40,699
Right now?

1502
01:25:42,005 --> 01:25:43,398
Oh my gosh.

1503
01:25:43,573 --> 01:25:45,139
We need water.

1504
01:25:45,314 --> 01:25:46,967
Ready, okay.

1505
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,577
♪ Who's up to bat

1506
01:25:48,752 --> 01:25:50,710
♪ Willie's up to bat

1507
01:25:50,884 --> 01:25:52,364
♪ Who's up to bat

1508
01:25:52,538 --> 01:25:54,496
♪ Willie's up to bat

1509
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:56,281
♪ If I were you
and you were me ♪

1510
01:25:56,455 --> 01:25:57,978
♪ I'd soup up really fast

1511
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,893
♪ I'd soup up really fast

1512
01:26:04,507 --> 01:26:06,227
Hope you're not too
attached to that ball.

1513
01:26:10,948 --> 01:26:11,731
It's a rocket to left,

1514
01:26:11,905 --> 01:26:12,905
where will it fly?

1515
01:26:14,212 --> 01:26:15,909
It's outta here!

1516
01:26:20,784 --> 01:26:22,786
He got one there, yeah!

1517
01:26:24,004 --> 01:26:27,007
I need water right now!

1518
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,618
That's a grand slam

1519
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:30,359
for this talented ballplayer!

1520
01:26:30,532 --> 01:26:31,532
Showoff.

1521
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,884
Yeah!

1522
01:26:34,058 --> 01:26:34,885
Bottom of the final inning,

1523
01:26:35,059 --> 01:26:36,059
Warriors up by one.

1524
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,452
Can they hold onto the win

1525
01:26:37,627 --> 01:26:40,020
and cap a truly
miraculous season?

1526
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,546
Ball.

1527
01:26:45,852 --> 01:26:47,245
Come on.

1528
01:26:47,419 --> 01:26:50,422
Don't do this now,
don't do this now.

1529
01:26:54,425 --> 01:26:55,425
Come on.

1530
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:00,039
Ball four.

1531
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:09,441
Ball four, take your base.

1532
01:27:09,615 --> 01:27:10,964
Back to back walks.

1533
01:27:11,138 --> 01:27:12,791
That puts the
winning run on first.

1534
01:27:25,978 --> 01:27:27,111
Is this you?

1535
01:27:29,156 --> 01:27:30,245
This last few months?

1536
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:33,159
Now?

1537
01:27:37,861 --> 01:27:38,644
Cause I'm about to do something

1538
01:27:38,818 --> 01:27:40,516
that the old me

1539
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:42,300
would've never done.

1540
01:27:44,171 --> 01:27:45,999
What you doing, coach?

1541
01:27:48,654 --> 01:27:49,829
Growing.

1542
01:27:50,003 --> 01:27:51,178
Dude, you're big.

1543
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:52,657
Aren't you huge enough?

1544
01:27:53,964 --> 01:27:54,964
Apparently not.

1545
01:27:56,619 --> 01:27:57,620
So,

1546
01:27:59,186 --> 01:28:01,188
we're getting pizza
later then, huh?

1547
01:28:01,362 --> 01:28:02,362
Huh.

1548
01:28:03,843 --> 01:28:05,541
I know this is gonna
take some time.

1549
01:28:06,889 --> 01:28:08,805
But as you know, I don't quit.

1550
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:13,984
And thanks for never
giving up on me.

1551
01:28:17,161 --> 01:28:18,161
Time.

1552
01:28:25,343 --> 01:28:26,823
I'm sorry, coach.

1553
01:28:26,996 --> 01:28:28,041
It won't happen again.

1554
01:28:30,174 --> 01:28:31,654
I don't know.

1555
01:28:31,827 --> 01:28:32,979
You're starting to
look a lot like you did

1556
01:28:33,003 --> 01:28:34,123
right before you passed out.

1557
01:28:34,918 --> 01:28:35,919
I'm fine.

1558
01:28:36,093 --> 01:28:37,312
Really, I can do this.

1559
01:28:38,661 --> 01:28:40,097
Yeah.

1560
01:28:40,271 --> 01:28:41,379
But last time you went
from I can do this

1561
01:28:41,403 --> 01:28:43,187
straight to the emergency room.

1562
01:28:43,361 --> 01:28:44,362
Sorry, buddy.

1563
01:28:44,536 --> 01:28:45,885
You played an amazing game.

1564
01:28:47,626 --> 01:28:49,541
No, you can't
take me out, coach.

1565
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:52,282
Coach we'll lose with Deshawn.

1566
01:28:52,457 --> 01:28:54,241
We have to win this game.

1567
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:56,243
Yeah, which is why I
have to take you out.

1568
01:28:56,418 --> 01:28:57,658
You're not looking good at all.

1569
01:28:57,723 --> 01:28:58,855
And your health-
No!

1570
01:29:03,294 --> 01:29:06,210
Coach, if we don't win today,
I'm never gonna see you again.

1571
01:29:08,473 --> 01:29:09,473
Yeah, you will.

1572
01:29:10,519 --> 01:29:12,041
But what about your contract?

1573
01:29:12,912 --> 01:29:14,218
You said, if we lose today,

1574
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:15,871
you're gonna lose everything.

1575
01:29:18,222 --> 01:29:20,050
And I'm gonna lose you.

1576
01:29:21,138 --> 01:29:23,619
You know about that.

1577
01:29:23,793 --> 01:29:24,793
Yeah.

1578
01:29:26,577 --> 01:29:28,232
I'm not taking that chance.

1579
01:29:33,455 --> 01:29:34,630
It's a little awkward.

1580
01:29:37,327 --> 01:29:39,374
I've never experienced
anything like this.

1581
01:29:43,116 --> 01:29:45,597
But you know, before I met you,

1582
01:29:48,992 --> 01:29:50,559
all of you,

1583
01:29:50,733 --> 01:29:52,865
I had everything that
money and fame can buy.

1584
01:29:54,127 --> 01:29:55,999
Turns out that was nothing.

1585
01:29:56,173 --> 01:29:58,871
I spent my whole life chasing
things that don't matter.

1586
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:02,135
I lost complete sight
of everything that does.

1587
01:30:04,355 --> 01:30:06,575
No, I'm not going anywhere.

1588
01:30:07,967 --> 01:30:09,316
We're so close.

1589
01:30:10,621 --> 01:30:11,621
I can do it.

1590
01:30:12,362 --> 01:30:13,973
We have to win this.

1591
01:30:15,018 --> 01:30:16,846
Yeah, we do.

1592
01:30:18,064 --> 01:30:19,630
Which is why I have
to take you out.

1593
01:30:20,632 --> 01:30:21,632
Deshawn.

1594
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:25,768
Look, bud, you played
an amazing game

1595
01:30:25,942 --> 01:30:27,246
and I'm really proud of you,

1596
01:30:28,597 --> 01:30:32,035
but there's way too
much on the line.

1597
01:30:49,487 --> 01:30:50,880
Yeah, coach?

1598
01:30:51,054 --> 01:30:52,447
Take us home, little buddy.

1599
01:30:53,665 --> 01:30:56,233
Coach, we did this before.

1600
01:30:56,407 --> 01:30:58,472
Yeah, just remember what we
worked on in practice, okay?

1601
01:30:58,496 --> 01:31:00,629
Settle in, take your time.

1602
01:31:00,803 --> 01:31:01,803
I know you can do it.

1603
01:31:03,109 --> 01:31:04,459
Hey, you got this.

1604
01:31:09,855 --> 01:31:11,161
Hey, buddy.

1605
01:31:11,335 --> 01:31:12,443
Kind hard to catch
a ball out there

1606
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:13,684
sitting in here, ain't it?

1607
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:17,950
Coach, this is a
really, really bad idea.

1608
01:31:18,124 --> 01:31:19,493
We worked on this
in practice, man.

1609
01:31:19,517 --> 01:31:20,648
You'll get it, come on.

1610
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:26,306
This is a really,
really, really,

1611
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:27,699
really bad idea.

1612
01:31:27,873 --> 01:31:28,873
What are you doing?

1613
01:31:29,005 --> 01:31:30,528
Hey, have faith, man.

1614
01:31:35,184 --> 01:31:36,665
Coach
Gabriel brought Deshawn in

1615
01:31:36,839 --> 01:31:37,839
to pitch for Lohan.

1616
01:31:38,754 --> 01:31:39,754
Hmm, okay.

1617
01:31:44,411 --> 01:31:46,065
Are they worth it?

1618
01:31:47,327 --> 01:31:51,288
You know you're throwing
everything away, right?

1619
01:31:52,724 --> 01:31:54,726
No, not everything.

1620
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,554
Come on, Deshawn, you got this!

1621
01:31:56,728 --> 01:31:57,728
Just like practice.

1622
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:05,910
Ball.

1623
01:32:06,041 --> 01:32:07,913
There goes the contract.

1624
01:32:08,087 --> 01:32:09,087
Poof.

1625
01:32:10,219 --> 01:32:12,352
Hey, come on Deshawn,
settle in, you got this.

1626
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,398
Come on guys, work
together as a team.

1627
01:32:23,146 --> 01:32:25,061
Yes, yes, good job, Deshawn.

1628
01:32:25,235 --> 01:32:26,235
Good job!

1629
01:32:33,635 --> 01:32:35,071
And a dribbler hit the short.

1630
01:32:35,245 --> 01:32:36,594
Hits the lot of second for one,

1631
01:32:36,768 --> 01:32:38,074
back to first.

1632
01:32:38,248 --> 01:32:39,249
Safe!

1633
01:32:39,423 --> 01:32:41,380
No, almost.

1634
01:32:43,949 --> 01:32:45,710
I can't, I can't, I can't,
I can't watch anymore.

1635
01:32:45,734 --> 01:32:47,083
I can't!

1636
01:32:47,257 --> 01:32:49,346
Come on, good job, Deshawn.

1637
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,782
One out, Warriors up by one,

1638
01:32:50,956 --> 01:32:52,436
but the winning run is on base

1639
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:54,656
and look who's up to
bat, well, well, well.

1640
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:57,397
We got a little Babe Ruth
here calling his shot.

1641
01:32:57,572 --> 01:32:58,877
This doesn't look good.

1642
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:00,443
Warriors may need
a miracle here.

1643
01:33:05,449 --> 01:33:06,581
Yes, yes!

1644
01:33:06,755 --> 01:33:08,103
Good job, Deshawn.

1645
01:33:08,278 --> 01:33:09,671
Come on!

1646
01:33:09,844 --> 01:33:11,455
Go Deshawn, strike him out!

1647
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:13,196
Here we go, you got it.

1648
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:21,159
Oh, no.

1649
01:33:22,727 --> 01:33:23,335
And he crushes it to right,

1650
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:25,251
sending it deep.

1651
01:33:25,425 --> 01:33:27,950
Uh oh, this kid here couldn't
even catch a butterfly.

1652
01:33:29,168 --> 01:33:30,866
Looks like it's a
playable ball for him.

1653
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:43,791
I caught it!

1654
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,361
I caught it, everybody!

1655
01:33:48,535 --> 01:33:49,536
Woo hoo hoo!

1656
01:33:53,496 --> 01:33:54,496
Throw it, come on!

1657
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:55,934
Come on, throw it!

1658
01:33:56,108 --> 01:33:58,589
There's only two outs!

1659
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:02,375
And he finally throws the ball

1660
01:34:02,549 --> 01:34:04,421
as the winning run rounds third.

1661
01:34:04,594 --> 01:34:05,943
Fires it away,

1662
01:34:06,118 --> 01:34:08,643
it's gonna be a
close play at home.

1663
01:34:13,255 --> 01:34:14,344
He's safe!

1664
01:34:24,963 --> 01:34:29,054
Wow, oh
that was close, so close.

1665
01:34:29,228 --> 01:34:32,101
The Warriors came within
inches of winning everything,

1666
01:34:32,275 --> 01:34:34,494
but came up just short.

1667
01:34:35,582 --> 01:34:37,193
Folks, that one's gonna sting.

1668
01:34:46,376 --> 01:34:48,726
Look guys, y'all
played great today.

1669
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:51,032
We got here winning as a team,

1670
01:34:51,207 --> 01:34:52,599
today we lost as a team.

1671
01:34:54,036 --> 01:34:55,559
We've come so far this year.

1672
01:34:56,995 --> 01:34:58,780
And honestly you guys have

1673
01:34:58,954 --> 01:35:01,173
probably taught me as
much as I've taught you.

1674
01:35:02,348 --> 01:35:03,348
I'm proud of you,

1675
01:35:04,263 --> 01:35:06,178
every single one of you.

1676
01:35:06,352 --> 01:35:07,702
It's a great season.

1677
01:35:16,318 --> 01:35:18,234
Hey, you're good buddy.

1678
01:35:19,496 --> 01:35:20,496
What a game.

1679
01:35:21,324 --> 01:35:22,324
So close.

1680
01:35:23,978 --> 01:35:26,721
That couldn't have been
an easy decision to make.

1681
01:35:26,895 --> 01:35:28,070
No, it wasn't.

1682
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:34,293
His levels were a
little low, but he's okay.

1683
01:35:34,467 --> 01:35:36,425
It was probably just
the stress of the game.

1684
01:35:38,036 --> 01:35:39,603
So you could have finished it.

1685
01:35:41,257 --> 01:35:42,258
It's okay, coach,

1686
01:35:42,432 --> 01:35:43,955
you were just trying to help me.

1687
01:35:44,129 --> 01:35:45,585
There was no way that
you can have known.

1688
01:35:45,609 --> 01:35:46,741
You did the right thing.

1689
01:35:48,438 --> 01:35:49,438
Yeah.

1690
01:35:51,484 --> 01:35:52,964
So about you and me.

1691
01:35:55,139 --> 01:35:56,139
I'm an idiot.

1692
01:35:57,403 --> 01:35:59,231
I wouldn't have gone that far.

1693
01:35:59,405 --> 01:36:01,451
I would, I messed up.

1694
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:04,541
This whole time I've still just
been thinking about myself.

1695
01:36:05,716 --> 01:36:06,848
Can you guys forgive me?

1696
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:09,240
Oh no.

1697
01:36:10,329 --> 01:36:12,157
What do you think, guys?

1698
01:36:12,331 --> 01:36:13,637
I think so.

1699
01:36:13,811 --> 01:36:14,464
I agree.

1700
01:36:14,638 --> 01:36:15,987
Okay.

1701
01:36:16,161 --> 01:36:17,684
How about we just
take a step back

1702
01:36:17,859 --> 01:36:19,121
and we start over?

1703
01:36:20,296 --> 01:36:21,296
Okay.

1704
01:36:25,127 --> 01:36:25,954
Hi.

1705
01:36:26,128 --> 01:36:27,607
I'm Jordan Gabriel.

1706
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:28,782
Pleasure to meet you.

1707
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:31,046
The pleasure is all mine.

1708
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,137
No, no it's not.

1709
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:38,487
Everyone's going for pizza.

1710
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:41,317
See you there.

1711
01:36:41,491 --> 01:36:42,840
Yeah, sounds great.

1712
01:36:45,059 --> 01:36:46,059
Good job.

1713
01:37:15,351 --> 01:37:17,919
I'd like to get in
on the forgiveness,

1714
01:37:18,093 --> 01:37:20,965
starting over, if I may.

1715
01:37:25,361 --> 01:37:26,361
Yeah.

1716
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,848
I think I would
really like that too.

1717
01:37:43,466 --> 01:37:45,032
Forgive me.

1718
01:37:46,295 --> 01:37:48,166
So I see you didn't
win the championship.

1719
01:37:50,299 --> 01:37:51,691
As per our agreement,

1720
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:53,911
your sentence is
still 90 days in jail.

1721
01:37:54,085 --> 01:37:56,218
Your honor, you're right.

1722
01:37:58,437 --> 01:37:59,830
I failed.

1723
01:38:00,004 --> 01:38:01,004
Bailiff.

1724
01:38:02,789 --> 01:38:04,487
Before I sentence you,

1725
01:38:04,661 --> 01:38:06,793
there are a few people who
have a few things to say.

1726
01:38:09,405 --> 01:38:10,406
What is this?

1727
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:11,886
I don't know.

1728
01:38:12,059 --> 01:38:14,148
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

1729
01:38:17,413 --> 01:38:18,762
What, did you know about this?

1730
01:38:18,936 --> 01:38:19,981
I had no idea.

1731
01:38:27,639 --> 01:38:29,686
The kids wanted to
share their testimonies

1732
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:31,427
on behalf of Coach Gabriel.

1733
01:38:32,994 --> 01:38:35,431
You may proceed.

1734
01:38:35,605 --> 01:38:38,869
Your honor, though we
didn't win the big game,

1735
01:38:40,784 --> 01:38:42,525
Coach Gabriel has
taught us far more

1736
01:38:42,699 --> 01:38:44,266
than any trophy could be worth.

1737
01:38:46,529 --> 01:38:49,314
And thanks to him, I got
a B plus on my math test.

1738
01:38:49,487 --> 01:38:50,620
And I hate math.

1739
01:38:52,013 --> 01:38:55,842
Your honor, Coach Gabriel
is far from perfect.

1740
01:38:58,889 --> 01:39:00,585
But he's a'ight.

1741
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,414
We'll take him as
a coach any day.

1742
01:39:03,719 --> 01:39:05,200
He's awesome.

1743
01:39:05,374 --> 01:39:08,725
Yeah, yeah.

1744
01:39:09,987 --> 01:39:11,307
All right, is
there anyone else?

1745
01:39:15,818 --> 01:39:18,300
Please don't take Mr.
Gabriel away from us.

1746
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:26,786
Mr. Gabriel, this was
never about winning a game.

1747
01:39:29,876 --> 01:39:31,400
I just wanted you to see

1748
01:39:31,574 --> 01:39:34,532
that using your talents
and gifts to help others

1749
01:39:34,707 --> 01:39:37,623
was the right thing
to do for your life.

1750
01:39:37,797 --> 01:39:40,322
To become a hero.

1751
01:39:42,802 --> 01:39:45,936
Apparently you have
done just that.

1752
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:47,110
So...

1753
01:39:49,548 --> 01:39:51,028
your case is dismissed.

1754
01:39:52,898 --> 01:39:54,162
What?

1755
01:39:54,335 --> 01:39:55,641
What did he say?

1756
01:39:56,599 --> 01:39:57,599
You're free to go.

1757
01:40:07,827 --> 01:40:08,827
Wow.

1758
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:12,528
Okay.

1759
01:40:16,053 --> 01:40:17,272
It's not over yet!

1760
01:40:20,405 --> 01:40:22,233
You'll figure it out.

1761
01:40:22,407 --> 01:40:24,192
Besides, I did catch
her writing your name

1762
01:40:24,366 --> 01:40:27,195
in her alphabet soup last
night, so there's that.

1763
01:40:27,369 --> 01:40:28,369
Really?

1764
01:40:30,241 --> 01:40:31,503
No!

1765
01:40:31,677 --> 01:40:33,462
Your ego is so gullible.

1766
01:40:33,636 --> 01:40:34,724
Why would she do that?

1767
01:40:36,246 --> 01:40:37,596
Good point.

1768
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:38,989
And guilty is charged.

1769
01:40:39,903 --> 01:40:40,903
Hey.

1770
01:40:42,558 --> 01:40:43,558
Go long.

1771
01:40:44,429 --> 01:40:45,429
Now we're talking.

1772
01:40:46,344 --> 01:40:48,259
Let's see what you got, old man.

1773
01:40:48,433 --> 01:40:50,087
Oh, that's how it's gonna be.

1774
01:40:50,261 --> 01:40:51,523
Well, chase this one down.

1775
01:41:07,757 --> 01:41:08,757
Dude, oh!

1776
01:41:11,282 --> 01:41:14,459
I just got you the biggest
contract in sports history.

1777
01:41:14,633 --> 01:41:16,112
You're kidding?

1778
01:41:16,287 --> 01:41:18,463
Your team has agreed
to the entire thing.

1779
01:41:18,637 --> 01:41:20,161
All of it, dude.

1780
01:41:20,335 --> 01:41:21,031
Dude, you really
better not be kidding me.

1781
01:41:21,205 --> 01:41:22,205
I'm not, man.

1782
01:41:22,337 --> 01:41:23,816
You know how they did it?

1783
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:25,620
Your entire team was
able to take pay cuts

1784
01:41:25,644 --> 01:41:26,969
and now they can stay
under the salary cap.

1785
01:41:26,993 --> 01:41:29,126
You, my friend, are the man.

1786
01:41:30,127 --> 01:41:31,127
Really?

1787
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:35,611
No deal.

1788
01:41:35,785 --> 01:41:37,003
Whoa, whoah, hold on.

1789
01:41:37,178 --> 01:41:38,701
What do you mean no deal?

1790
01:41:38,875 --> 01:41:40,268
Look, man.

1791
01:41:40,442 --> 01:41:41,965
I need them as much
as they need me.

1792
01:41:42,139 --> 01:41:44,184
I'm not taking a single
penny from those guys.

1793
01:41:44,359 --> 01:41:45,359
Why?

1794
01:41:46,752 --> 01:41:48,450
Cause we're a team.

1795
01:42:11,386 --> 01:42:12,386
Oh my...

1796
01:42:15,085 --> 01:42:16,085
What?

1797
01:42:17,478 --> 01:42:18,478
Wait, wait.

1798
01:42:20,264 --> 01:42:21,483
12, 12 million?

1799
01:42:22,353 --> 01:42:23,180
Oh!

1800
01:42:23,353 --> 01:42:26,835
Haha, oh my!

1801
01:42:28,359 --> 01:42:33,321
Oh my!
