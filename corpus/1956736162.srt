00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:29,651
Sit back. Good, good.
There you go.

190
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,739
A little longer.

191
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,240
Good.

192
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:38,786
Okay. And this one might have
to come out eventually, okay?

193
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:40,245
Do-Don't worry.

194
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,081
- [groans]
- Not right now.

195
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,750
- It doesn't have to come out right now.
- No.

196
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,295
Nothing's gonna happen right now. Do
you understand? This is just a check-up.

197
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:51,256
- Does he understand?
- Sorry?

198
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,301
I'm asking,
does he understand English?

199
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:57,805
Of course he does.
He's lived here for over 30 years.

200
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,306
Okay.

201
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:04,103
Would you like to
rinse your mouth out?

202
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,647
- Mm, water.
- Huh?

[groans]

204
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,361
No, no, no. Don't drink it.
Don't drink...

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,613
No, no, no, no.

218

Dad, we have to do this, okay?
We have to change your pants.

219
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,957
No, no.

220

- [sighs]

221
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,587
- No.
- Are you shy? You're a little shy?

222
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,132
Look, my eyes are closed.

223
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,926
Not seeing you.
Not seeing you.

224
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,888
[mumbling] Not seeing you.
Not seeing you.

225
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,806
Whoa!
Oh, whoa!

226
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,102
That's why we're going
to get your eyes tested.

227
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,979
Not seeing me? Ha!

228
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,860
Come on.

229
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,446
Ah-ah. Stand up.
Stand up.

230
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,323
Yeah.

231
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,575
[sighs] Okay.

232
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,161
- No. No.
- Oh, Dad.

233
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,706
It's normal. It's normal
to take off your pants.

234
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,250
See?
People do it all the time.

235
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:52,920
Look.

236
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,797
Whoo! See?

237
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,758
It's normal.
It's normal, Dad.

238

- See? Whoop. Whoo!
- [mumbling, chuckling]

Ha! I think
they'd fit you real nice.

Don't you think? Whoo!

241
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:06,934
Stylish, Dad!

242
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:10,270
- [knocking]
- Just a minute!

243
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,817
Ah! Oop! Okay.

Mmm.

254
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:28,951
Sorry. Can I ask you a question?

255
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,411
Okay.

256
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:33,622
What kind of endings
do you prefer?

257
00:23:34,415 --> 00:23:35,749
In books.

258
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,127
I'm a writer, you see.

259
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:43,132
Depends on the story.
What happens in yours?

260
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:48,178
Since you've asked...

261
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:52,975
uh, in my story,
a man sets off...

262
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,269
on a long voyage

263
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,354
and overcomes
one obstacle after another

264
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:59,732
until he ends up
on an island.

265
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,567
Is it about you?

266
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,235
About me? No, no, no.

267
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,654
And on the last page,

268
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:08,490
he has to decide
to continue his life in exile

269
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:14,037
or to come back home,
to what was once his home.

270
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,958
- And?
- Uh...

271
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:22,046
he may discover that his family
has not waited for him.

272
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,633
How long has he been away?

273
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:29,428
At least...

274
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,305
20 years.

275
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,806
- [woman 2] Twenty years?
- Twenty years.

276
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:36,560
[laughs]
No chance.

277
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,354
But what if he regrets
his decision to leave?

278
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,109
Bit too late, isn't it?

279
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:50,074
Is it?
Is it too late?

280
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,874
We should go.
Come on.

281
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:08,884
- Maybe see you later.
- I doubt it.

282
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:17,768

Dad.

296
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:24,603
Does it hurt?

297
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,314
- No.
- Are you in pain?

298
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:28,524
No.

299
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:31,527
Look at me.

300
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,820
Look at me!

301
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,367
- Do you want me to call an ambulance?
- Yes. Please.

302
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,785
No.

303
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,954
You're hurt.

You live here, Dad.

- Yes.
- You're a citizen.

307
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:55,759
- You're legal.
- No.

308
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:57,302
You're safe.

Hi. Look, I may not make it in
by lunchtime after all.

316
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:42,116
Shit. Sorry.
Can I call you back?

317
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:45,911
- Mm.
- Sorry.

318
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,621
- Dad?
- [grunts]

319
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,541
So... do you know
where you are?

320
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:57,381
The...
[groans] hospital?

321
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:00,384
Do you know why?

322
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,970
- [louder] Do you know why you're in the hospital?
- [mutters] No.

323
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,932
Do you know
what day it is?

324
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,183
Today?

325
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,730
Okay, he's fine,
I think.

326
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:16,108
- Fine?
- His head is fine. It's a superficial cut.

327
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,694
I wasn't referring
to his underlying condition.

328
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:22,156
The scan shows some further
atrophy in the frontal lobes.

329
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,700
Actually, I wanted to ask you
some questions about his symptoms.

330

- Does...

Is that what you were
trying to say before?

340
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,838

that you're here if you want me to.

He knows perfectly well

The malingering bastard.

353
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,717

- But he just said...

Dolores.

- [Rita] He always wanted sons, you see.
- He did?

[murmurs] No. No, no.

00:32:58,187 --> 00:32:59,563
[groans] No.

- [chuckles]
- It's not funny.

361
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:04,526
Maybe he should've
stayed with her.

Very passionate.

He adored her, apparently.

366
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:19,333
A codependent disaster, in my
opinion, from the stories he told me.

<i>Hermoso.</i>

369
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:25,839
[doctor]
Does he often hallucinate?

370
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:29,760
Excuse me, but my father does have a
name, actually, and can hear you.

371
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:32,763
[doctor] Okay. Would you
prefer to step outside to talk?

372
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:35,391
- Mm?
- [grunts]

373
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:39,561
If it's okay with you, sir, I'm just gonna
have a word outside with your family.

374
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:41,188
Two.

375
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,524
Two what?
Two words?

376
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:46,235
Two words
are okay with you?

377
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:47,903
Two of them.

378
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,488
Mm-hmm, yes.

379
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:51,115
- [sirens wailing]
- Two of them.

380
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:52,950
[Leo] Sirens outside.

381
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:56,203
Yes, that's because
we're in the emergency room.

382
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:57,579
[mutters]
Emergency.

383
00:33:57,663 --> 00:34:00,666
- Mmm. Urgent care.
- Urgent.

384
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:04,128
[women whooping,
laughing, chattering]

385
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:09,258
[speaking German]

386
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,600
- Oh! No, no, no!
- [both laughing]

387
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:40,682
[Rita]
<i>Wake up, Leo. Wake up, Leo.</i>

388
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,603
- [Rita] Time to go home.
- Home?

389
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:47,981
- With you?
- [Rita laughs]

390
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,358
No.

391
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:52,152
We divorced.

392
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,154
Quite a long time ago
now, actually.

393
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:56,698
- Divorced?
- Yes.

394
00:35:56,782 --> 00:35:59,034
Probably because I became
more successful than you.

395
00:35:59,118 --> 00:36:02,871
A lot more, actually,
which neither of us could deal with.

396
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:05,374
But we're still friends.

397
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:07,626
- Friends?
- Yes.

398
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,962
I think that's what
people call it.

399
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:14,258
You live in that dump
overlooking the tracks,

400
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,844
which you like,
apparently, alone.

401
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:18,387
Alone?

402
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,056
Yes, which for some reason
you prefer.

403
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,851
And your daughter feels
that we should respect that.

404
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:28,897
However, the doctor is,
as they say, concerned...

405
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:32,192
- and thinks the time has come...
- Mom!

406
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:40,743
[moans softly]

407
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:42,828
[sniffing]

408
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:45,998
- Your hair.
- [scoffs]

409
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:50,169
- Same as it ever was.
- Mm-mmm.

410
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:54,089
- [grunts]
- Well, more or less.

411
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:56,341
Thanks to my colorist.
[chuckles]

412
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,553
- Looks good, huh?
- No.

413
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,597
Oh, just...

414
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,766
just agree with me
for once.

415
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:05,601
Upon a time.

416
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:07,603
- Oh, Christ.
- You m-mine.

417
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:08,854
No, not anymo...

418
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:11,148
As I just mentioned,
I have a new husband now.

419
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:12,524
You've met him.

420
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:14,193
- N-No.
- Yes, of course you have.

421
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:16,820
Dozens of times.
Socially. Parties.

422
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:19,323
Parties?
[chuckles]

423
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,992
Parties? Parties?

424
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:25,287
We are too busy
for parties today, Dad.

425
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,331
Don't... Don't humor him,
sweetheart.

426
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:28,999
Cunning bastard.

427
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,919
He just pretends he doesn't remember
things so he can make me feel guilty.

428
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,837
Mom, stop it.

429
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:35,798
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

430
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,257
[chuckles]

431
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:40,511
I didn't even ask where you were
going when all this happened.

432
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:45,432
We went to the dentist,
and now... [sighs]

433
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:49,395
we're going to the optometrist,
if we ever get there.

434
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:51,230
Can you manage?

435
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:56,860
Do you want me to come too? I suppose
I could rearrange some things and...

436
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:58,070
Néstor.

437
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,739
Néstor is there?

438
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:03,242
- No.
- Néstor?

439
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:06,537
No, Néstor
is no longer with us.

440
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,247
[Rita]
He's in heaven.

441
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,082
No.

442
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:12,126
- Doggy heaven.
- No.

443
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:13,961
He was a very good dog.

444
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:16,880
[whines] Oh, Néstor.

445
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:19,466
Néstor! [whines]

446
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,635
Is he getting agitated?

447
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:25,139
We can give him something
to calm him down.

448
00:38:25,222 --> 00:38:28,142
Why does everyone continue
to refer to Dad as "he,"

449
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:29,893
as if he's not here?

450
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,230
Well, is he?

451
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:37,025
Oh, Néstor.

452
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:42,823
[sobbing]

453
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:04,094
[engine idling]

454
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:19,193
[truck departs]

455
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:28,368
[laughing, faint]

456
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:32,039
- Hey. Hey!
- Hey!

457
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:35,125
[laughing, chattering]

458
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:37,961
I'm sorry!

459
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:40,047
[chattering continues,
faint]

460
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:57,147
Hey, are you following us?

461
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:59,233
No. No, no, no.
I'm not following. No, no.

462
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:02,528
It's just that I saw you
up there and then I... I...

463
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:07,533
I can't stop thinking about
the conversation we had before.

464
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:10,119
Because it's incomplete,
like my book.

465
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:11,745
[chuckles]

466
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:13,372
[groans]

467
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:15,457
- You okay?
- Yes.

468
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,627
- Let me help you up.
- [Leo gasps]

469
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,630
Thank you.

470
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:27,386
Wow.

471
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:31,598
What is it? Are you hurt?

472
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:34,852
No, it's that...

473
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:39,648
you keep reminding me
of someone that I once knew.

474
00:40:40,733 --> 00:40:43,318
Do I? Who's that, then?

475
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:46,530
Uh, well...

476
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:49,074
we met at college.

477
00:40:49,158 --> 00:40:51,452
And we had a daughter.

478
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:55,247
Who, by now,
will be, uh...

479
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,333
How old are you?

480
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:02,046
Probably the same age as your
daughter, I should think. Am I right?

481
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:05,299
[sighs]

482
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,551
Yes.

483
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:11,513
- Do you see her often, your daughter?
- No.

484
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:14,641
- No, I don't.
- Why?

485
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:18,103
Well, I left
when she was a baby.

486
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:19,563
- Uh...
- Why?

487
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:23,609
Because I couldn't
concentrate on my work

488
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:26,403
because of the noise
and the crying and...

489
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:28,322
You know?

490
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:29,823
That's sad.

491
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:34,495
That's the saddest thing
I ever heard.

492
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:36,747
- For her, at least.
- For me, too.

493
00:41:38,082 --> 00:41:41,835
But you have to make sacrifices
when you are a writer.

494
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:48,092
Are you saying you sacrificed
your daughter... for a book?

495
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:54,598
[inhales, exhales]

496
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:56,392
[daughter] <i>Dad.</i>

497
00:41:58,143 --> 00:41:59,603
Dad?

498
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:02,272
Are you okay?

499
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:08,362
Let's quickly find you some nice pants
before we get your eyes tested, okay?

500
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,198
Okay?

501
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,283
We'll get some for me too.

502
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:18,747
Luckily for us,
we got a later appointment.

503
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:20,582
But we have to be quick.
Okay?

504
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,294
Other one.

505
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:27,214
Other one.

506
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,467
Huh? What other one?

507
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:32,094
Mmm.

508
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,387
Like you.

509
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,933
See you later, maybe.
[murmurs]

510
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:39,893
Okay, okay, okay.

511
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:49,111
[phone buzzing]

512
00:42:50,738 --> 00:42:52,614
I'm sorry.
I meant to call back.

513
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:56,326
There have been
some complications in my day.

514
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:01,373
What happened
in the meeting?

515
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:06,670
They still want me to do it,
don't they?

516
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:10,132
I've been working on it forever.
I've done all the research.

517
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:18,182
Well, that's just today.
I mean, I <i>can</i> do it.

518
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:26,690
No, it's just been
a crazy day, but I...

519
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:36,408
Sorry. Could you hold on
for just a moment?

520
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:37,576
Sorry.

521
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:47,169
[grunts, sighs]

522
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:51,131
[inhales, exhales]

523
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:17,866
Dad?

524
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,629
[gasps, sighs]

525
00:44:30,713 --> 00:44:31,880
Dad?

526
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:34,717
Please don't disappear
like that again.

527
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,428
- Where did you get that dog?
- <i>Encontré a Néstor.</i>

528
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:38,971
Néstor.

529
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:41,181
[woman]
He stole my dog!

530
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:43,183
Him! He stole my dog!

531
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:44,893
The fucking Mexican
stole my dog!

532
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:46,812
Okay, what's going on?

533
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:48,647
- He stole my dog.
- [whimpering] Néstor.

534
00:44:48,731 --> 00:44:51,150
Get out of my country,
you fucking criminal.

535
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:53,986
Listen, I can explain.
This is my father. He's just confused.

536
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:55,487
- Is the dog hers?
- Yes.

537
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:57,698
- Give the lady back the dog now.
- Dad? Dad?

538
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:59,032
[in Spanish]

539
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:02,077
- [English] You're dead. Dead!
- [daughter] Okay, please... Hey!

540
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:05,080
[grunting]

541
00:45:05,164 --> 00:45:09,084
Stop. Get off him.
You're hurting him. Please.

542
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,753
<i>Okay? This is my dad.</i>

543

01:08:14,094 --> 01:08:16,930
I, um...
I think maybe he is lost.

725
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:18,557
Also maybe his mind.

726
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,476
[in Punjabi]

727
01:08:20,559 --> 01:08:22,728
[officer] Does he know
where he lives?

728
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:30,110
The officer wants to know
where you live, uncle.

729
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:35,115
[stammers]

730
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,408
Home.

731
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:55,969
[officer]
Sir. Come on.

732
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:00,099
Come on.

733
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:09,817
Watch your head.

734
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:12,820
Go ahead.

735
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:26,583
[bell tolls]

736
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:32,172
[inhales, exhales]

737
01:09:33,257 --> 01:09:37,052
[bell tolls]

738
01:09:37,136 --> 01:09:39,263
[exhales]

739
01:09:39,346 --> 01:09:41,974
[bell tolls]

740
01:11:01,845 --> 01:11:05,015
[sobbing]

741
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:05,951
[sobbing]

742
01:12:41,653 --> 01:12:44,448
Hey, Mom.
They found him.

743
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:48,368
I know. Thank God.

744
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,789
Yeah, I'm taking him home now.

745
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:15,622
Wherever I go,

746
01:14:15,706 --> 01:14:18,751
there I am.

747
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:21,712
True.

748
01:14:21,795 --> 01:14:24,298
But you...

749
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:29,511
you're not always there.

750
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:31,805
Also very true, Dad.

751
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,976
- "Dad"?
- Yes.

752
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:39,897
You're my dad.

753
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:42,566
<i>Mi papá.</i>

754
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:45,652
So I chose...

755
01:14:47,905 --> 01:14:49,615
Rita.

756
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:53,994
Which led to me,
so I'm happy you chose her.

757
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:59,500
One road, other... roads

758
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:02,461
I could... I could have...

759
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:04,380
Could have what, <i>papá?</i>

760
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:07,424
[sighs]

761
01:15:10,803 --> 01:15:12,012
Could have...

762
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:15,766
gone to Greece.

763
01:15:17,017 --> 01:15:20,646
Mom told me you went to Greece
when I was a baby.

764
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:23,565
To some island, to write.

765
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:25,359
Mmm, write, write.

766
01:15:25,442 --> 01:15:27,444
Many years. Many...

767
01:15:27,528 --> 01:15:31,073
Well, not really. You...

768
01:15:31,156 --> 01:15:33,826
She said when you got there,
you changed your mind.

769
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:36,286
You turned around
and came straight back.

770
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:37,538
For you.

771
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:44,044
Did you, <i>papá?</i>

772
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,255
For me?

773
01:15:48,132 --> 01:15:49,425
F-For me.

774
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:54,847
Well...

775
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:57,683
thanks for doing that.

776
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:59,351
For all of us.

777
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:03,689
Even if Mom and you
did get divorced later.

778
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:07,943
Alone.

779
01:16:09,528 --> 01:16:11,280
You have me, <i>papá.</i>

780
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:15,325
But I have to work.

781
01:16:16,952 --> 01:16:20,164
And you know
how much I love my work.

782
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:24,209
I've been working on some
stories in honor of your story.

783
01:16:25,502 --> 01:16:27,671
And I have to travel.

784
01:16:28,964 --> 01:16:31,050
So I won't always be here.

785
01:16:32,051 --> 01:16:34,803
M-M-México.

786
01:16:38,098 --> 01:16:41,060
I was supposed to go
to the border, actually.

787
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:44,688
I... I crossed over.

788
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:46,356
Yesterday.

789
01:16:47,316 --> 01:16:49,777
Does it feel like yesterday?

790
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,153
<i>Was</i> yesterday.

791
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:53,238
And...

792
01:17:01,789 --> 01:17:04,416
I went... there.

793
01:17:10,339 --> 01:17:11,548
There.

794
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:21,767
And many other places
I went.

795
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:23,018
Mm.

796
01:17:26,397 --> 01:17:28,399
I'm sorry, <i>papá.</i>

797
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,485
I'm trying
to understand.

798
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:34,613
I'll try harder...

799
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:39,326
to see it
from your point of view,

800
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:41,412
to see what you see.

801
01:17:45,707 --> 01:17:46,834
No.

802
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:50,254
[groans]

803
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,967
In the sea I died.

804
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,635
Mmm.

805
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:59,221
- No, no.
- [stammers]

806
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:02,182
[grunts] I was there.

807
01:18:02,266 --> 01:18:03,475
I was...

808
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:06,729
I was there. I was...

809
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:09,857
I was... there.

810
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,443
All the same time.

811
01:18:12,526 --> 01:18:14,445
[sighs]
And then?

812
01:18:15,446 --> 01:18:16,989
[whispers]
And then?

813
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:19,408
And then come home.

814
01:18:20,743 --> 01:18:22,244
This one.

815
01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:24,830
With you.

816
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:29,752
Welcome back,
Dad.

817
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:32,880
[sighs]

818
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:36,842
Molly.

819
01:18:37,426 --> 01:18:38,719
[gasps]

820
01:18:42,848 --> 01:18:46,018
Y-You said my name.

821
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:48,562
Oh, yes, that's me.

822
01:18:50,731 --> 01:18:52,524
And...

823
01:18:52,608 --> 01:18:54,318
you're you.

824
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:57,821
However far away you go...

825
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:01,575
and whatever they say,

826
01:19:01,658 --> 01:19:03,744
you are always you.

827
