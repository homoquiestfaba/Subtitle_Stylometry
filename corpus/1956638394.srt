Why the fuck would you
show me something

506
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:29,696
if I couldn't have it, then?

507
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:31,163
The fuck would you
bring this out?

508
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,030
I don't know. Excited.
Excited to share it.

509
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:35,063
Well, let me hold it
for a night then.

510
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:36,796
Right? Let me wait
until the game tomorrow.

511
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:38,529
It'll be cool.
You know, I'm going to the game.

512
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,163
Nigga, I'll grab it from you

513
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,662
then meet you at Abby's
tomorrow morning, first thing.

514
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:42,896
- Boom. Boom.
- Just like that.

515
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:44,929
- It's perfect.
- Howard, come on.

516
00:21:44,931 --> 00:21:46,030
- It's one night, Howard.
- Serious?

517
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:47,263
- I can't.
- It's one night.

518
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,829
They'll pull it
from the auction.

519
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:50,096
JULIA: He's good for it.
He's good for it.

520
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:51,829
KEVIN: You don't understand.

521
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:53,363
This stone, I'm really
connecting with this, man.

522
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:56,597
I feel like I'm gonna have
40 or 50 on this, man.

523
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:59,064
You understand that?
You understand that?

524
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,797
DEMANY: You see what the fuck
I'm talking about, Howard?

525
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,398
It's just speaking to him.
You know?

526
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,630
KEVIN: Man, I'm gonna destroy
Philly tonight with this.

527
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:06,331
- Yeah.
- Get your ass.

528
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,031
KEVIN: Nigga, this fucking thing
makes me feel like I can fly.

529
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,498
- Shit.
- Howard, you hear that?

530
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,830
DEMANY:
Yeah. Let him get that.

531
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:14,097
You're going to at me
at howiebling.

532
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,830
- Yes.
- 30 fucking pics, I want likes.

533
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:17,897
- Yes. I got you.
- He's talking about at-ing me.

534
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:19,498
HOWARD:
Let me get a fucking shot.

535
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,530
- There's a good idea, man.
- Come here. Come here.

536
00:22:21,532 --> 00:22:23,431
- Look at this. Woo.
- You hold it up.

537
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:25,464
Look at this shit.
Boom.

538
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:26,797
KEVIN: Boom. Cool.

539
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,064
Uh... You can't just...
Give me a...

540
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:30,830
Give me the Celtic ring.
I want the ring.

541
00:22:30,832 --> 00:22:32,364
- Howard, come the fuck on.
- Collateral.

542
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:34,032
No, no, no, no, no.
He's good money, my nigga.

543
00:22:34,034 --> 00:22:35,664
I know he's good for it.
I want to make a deal.

544
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,664
That's a deal.
That's a deal. That's a deal.

545
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,664
- I give you that.
- Thanks. Alright.

546
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,564
I'll keep it right here,
right next to my Knicks '73.

547
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,365
KEVIN: Classic. Classic.
I like that.

548
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:45,499
I appreciate you understanding.

549
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:47,432
Got you. Right.

550
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:49,965
- But listen, you meet me.
- Yeah, I'll meet your happy ass.

551
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,965
- Yes. Alright.
- You will fucking

552
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:53,931
bring that stone to me,
9:00 in the morning.

553
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:56,098
Hey. Hey. Hey, listen to me.
No dicking around.

554
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,332
- You show up. You hear me?
- Chill.

555
00:22:58,334 --> 00:23:00,032
I'll see you there,
motherfucker.

556
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:02,564
Alright. Let's roll.
Let's do it, nigga.

557
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:03,898
Let's do it.

558
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,931
- Buzz them out.
- I got his earrings.

559
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,731
HOWARD: Hey, the earrings.
Wait. Bring it out to him.

560
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:10,065
Keep them.
Keep them until tomorrow.

561
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:13,966
- I'll grab them.
- Black Jew power, nigga.

562
00:23:13,968 --> 00:23:15,901
- He's so extra.
- Fucking out.

563
00:23:18,901 --> 00:23:22,599
HOWARD: Who's gonna clean
this fucking shit?

564
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,766
Eddie, boy,
what are you doing?

565
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:26,299
What do you want?

566
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:27,832
Look what I got.
Look.

567
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:29,233
You're gonna love this.
Here.

568
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:31,999
- Hey. What's that right there?
- Howard...

569
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:33,766
- Will you leave me alone?
- What is it?

570
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:37,366
It's Kevin Garnett's ring,
championship ring, NBA, 2008.

571
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:39,033
I knew you would freak out.

572
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:42,235
- Alright. I love you, my boy.
- Alright. Bye.

573
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:48,835
Roberto, you came to work.

574
00:23:51,503 --> 00:23:52,867
- Ronstein.
- Hey, Howard.

575
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:55,600
Hey. Break out your tray.
Where is he?

576
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,300
I'd shake your hand,
but I know where it's been.

577
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:00,000
Look at this.

578
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:02,733
It's Kevin Garnett's
2008 championship ring.

579
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:05,367
- Championship ring?
- Championship ring, 2008.

580
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:07,533
Alright. You want to pawn it
or you want to sell it?

581
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:08,800
I want to pawn it.
I want to pawn it.

582
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:10,167
Let me take a quick
look at it.

583
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:11,867
I don't know what
you're looking for.

584
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:13,134
- Check the diamond.
- Okay?

585
00:24:13,136 --> 00:24:14,666
That was just on
his fucking finger.

586
00:24:14,668 --> 00:24:16,100
- It's single cut, Howie.
- Let me see it.

587
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:17,867
It's single cut.
It's not even full cut.

588
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:19,134
- Steve, take a look at it.
- You talk to the fucking league

589
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:20,767
about the way
they cut their shit.

590
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:21,867
MAN: I understand,
but they're worth less.

591
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,334
Take a look at this.
Alright?

592
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,368
MAN: Alright. It's his ring.
I understand.

593
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,035
It's from his Instagram. It's
fucking blowing up right now.

594
00:24:27,037 --> 00:24:28,567
I hear you. Alright.
So what do you need for it?

595
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:31,768
I figure that thing
is worth 80 grand.

596
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,168
Just loan it to me.
That's it.

597
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,934
Just float it to me.
I'll be back Friday.

598
00:24:34,936 --> 00:24:36,634
Number one, we both know
what's in here.

599
00:24:36,636 --> 00:24:39,634
We both know that the value is
mostly because it's memorabilia.

600
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:41,135
But it is a memorabilia piece,

601
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:43,534
so that's how you're
gonna sell it, right?

602
00:24:43,536 --> 00:24:45,168
STEVE: So I tell you what.

603
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,168
Give me 50 G's.
Just float it to me.

604
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,235
I'm gonna give you $25,000, but
I want an 8% fee on the ring.

605
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:52,901
8%? Fucking, how about
I give you a grand?

606
00:24:52,903 --> 00:24:54,567
You take a grand off the top.

607
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,235
I'm gonna come back
Friday for it.

608
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:57,934
You know, last time you had
something here for 6 months,

609
00:24:57,936 --> 00:25:00,001
- so we want to make sure upfront.
- Alright. Alright.

610
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:02,002
Last time wasn't my fault.
We fucking went over that.

611
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:03,568
I understand.
Let's make it quick.

612
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,269
$21,000, 7% fee,

613
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,935
and I want you to know,
said you'd be back Friday.

614
00:25:07,937 --> 00:25:09,735
If you're not back Friday,
it's my ring.

615
00:25:09,737 --> 00:25:12,302
HOWARD: If I don't bring it back
Friday, I'm a dead man, so...

616
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,668
- Alright. So we have a deal?
- Alright. Deal.

617
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,802
- Mazel. Mazel.
- Mazel.

618
00:25:15,804 --> 00:25:17,269
HOWARD: Alright. Mazel.

619
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:19,036
Can you go to the safe
and get me the money?

620
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:21,002
MAN: Get him the money.
We'll get you the money.

621
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:23,369
HOWARD: Alright.
Hey, good pace.

622
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:24,971
This is great.

623
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:30,568
ARNO: 70th and 1st, what the
fuck is he doing there?

624
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,269
He's walking.

625
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:34,804
Oh, now he's stopping.
He's slowing down.

626
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,903
- What?
- He's doing something.

627
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,569
He's playing with his phone
or something.

628
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:43,270
He's playing with something.

629
00:25:43,272 --> 00:25:45,103
I can't make it out. I can't see
him. His back is to me.

630
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:46,903
He's hunched over.
You can't see.

631
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:48,669
PHIL: I don't know.
We... We can't see anything.

632
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:51,970
Oh. Oh! Oh, here he goes.
Here he goes. He's going again.

633
00:25:51,972 --> 00:25:54,237
ARNO: Wait.
I just got a text from him.

634
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:56,836
- What's he saying?
- It's a picture of money.

635
00:25:56,838 --> 00:25:58,803
- This fucking prick.
- He says, "Arno..."

636
00:25:58,805 --> 00:26:00,237
He's got fucking money.

637
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,870
ARNO: "...I've got your money
right here."

638
00:26:01,872 --> 00:26:02,870
PHIL: Alright.
He's turning in somewhere.

639
00:26:02,872 --> 00:26:05,270
A restaurant, Melo's.

640
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:08,103
- Hey, handsome, where's he at?
- He's in the back.

641
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:09,838
He's in the back.

642
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,871
Hey, you got him
making meatballs in the back?

643
00:26:16,873 --> 00:26:18,171
Alright.

644
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:19,904
You have your romaine.
You have your croutons.

645
00:26:19,906 --> 00:26:22,904
You have your eggs.
No carrots in the salad.

646
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:24,371
What do you want?
You made your bet.

647
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,271
I know. I know.
I've got to change the bet.

648
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:27,670
I've got $21,000 here,

649
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:29,171
so you add it on
to the 19 grand.

650
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:31,238
- $40,000 in all.
- Scrap the whole bet?

651
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,038
Scrap the whole bet.
I want to make a 6-way parlay,

652
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,737
Celtics-Sixers game,
what's the lineup?

653
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:37,038
- Still plus one.
- Plus one.

654
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,737
Okay, so I want the Celtics
to cover.

655
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:40,038
I want the Celtics halftime.

656
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,904
I want Garnett
points and rebounds.

657
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:43,771
- Alright.
- Garnett blocked shots,

658
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:45,338
Celtics opening tip.

659
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,871
Do you take lightning bets?

660
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:48,737
Yeah, but you don't want
any part of lightning bets.

661
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:50,104
Fine. $1,000 a point, okay?

662
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:51,804
Take this, and this is
a gift from me.

663
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:53,406
What's this?

664
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:55,205
HOWARD: For just tolerating me
for all this time. Okay?

665
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:57,205
No. No. No.
I already have a Rolex.

666
00:26:57,207 --> 00:26:58,905
I don't need your watch. This

01:28:50,107 --> 01:28:52,472
ANNE: I have bent over
backwards for you, Mr. Ratner.

2160
01:28:52,474 --> 01:28:53,972
- We are done here.
- Yes, that'll be perfect.

2161
01:28:53,974 --> 01:28:55,572
I'll let her know.

2162
01:28:55,574 --> 01:28:57,172
ANNE: Me and my staff had to
work the entire weekend

2163
01:28:57,174 --> 01:28:58,938
- to get your piece ready.
- Thank you so much.

2164
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:00,072
Once again, from the bottom
of my heart, I apologize.

2165
01:29:00,074 --> 01:29:01,472
ANNE: I'm just happy

2166
01:29:01,474 --> 01:29:03,339
I won't ever have to work with
you again.

2167
01:29:03,341 --> 01:29:05,038
Okay, I'll tell her. Thank you.
Okay. So she said

2168
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:08,671
that we need to take
the inserts

2169
01:29:08,673 --> 01:29:10,139
out of each catalog

2170
01:29:10,141 --> 01:29:14,006
before the auction starts,
so you have those.

2171
01:29:14,008 --> 01:29:17,609
If you want, I saw a box down
there, and I can start on these.

2172
01:29:21,674 --> 01:29:22,873
What is that?
What are you doing?

2173
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:24,440
I just have a question
for Anne.

2174
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:26,306
You don't need to call her.
I just spoke with her.

2175
01:29:26,308 --> 01:29:27,906
Oh, it's a separate question.
Don't worry about it.

2176
01:29:27,908 --> 01:29:29,507
- Howard!
- Hi, Anne. He's saying

2177
01:29:29,509 --> 01:29:31,206
that you told him it was okay
to take out the inserts.

2178
01:29:31,208 --> 01:29:32,739
Okay, hey, listen.
Just fuck it.

2179
01:29:32,741 --> 01:29:34,140
Put them back in.
I don't give a shit.

2180
01:29:34,142 --> 01:29:35,607
- Gooey!
- We're here.

2181
01:29:35,609 --> 01:29:37,873
- You're a sight for sore eyes.
- Is he here?

2182
01:29:37,875 --> 01:29:39,939
HOWARD: Huh, KG?

2183
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:41,873
- He is... I didn't see him yet.
- Is he here?

2184
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:43,206
I haven't seen him yet.

2185
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:44,739
I got all these things
for him to sign.

2186
01:29:44,741 --> 01:29:46,340
Listen to me. Listen.
If you want that,

2187
01:29:46,342 --> 01:29:48,973
get it before
the auction starts.

2188
01:29:48,975 --> 01:29:50,340
Go to the auction room.
See if he's there.

2189
01:29:50,342 --> 01:29:52,007
- Find him in there.
- He's a great guy.

2190
01:29:52,009 --> 01:29:53,374
- You'll love him.
- He's excited.

2191
01:29:53,376 --> 01:29:55,740
So I want to ask you
a little favor.

2192
01:29:55,742 --> 01:29:58,807
- Can I...?
- Yeah, what? What favor?

2193
01:29:58,809 --> 01:30:02,640
So I need you
to jack up the bids.

2194
01:30:02,642 --> 01:30:04,074
What? No.
I... No.

2195
01:30:04,076 --> 01:30:05,907
- Absolutely not.
- Gooey, a little bit.

2196
01:30:05,909 --> 01:30:07,740
It's just here
and there, you make a bid.

2197
01:30:07,742 --> 01:30:10,775
I just got to ensure
we get it up to $250,000.

2198
01:30:12,343 --> 01:30:14,508
- What if I win at $250,000?
- That's easy.

2199
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:15,974
I'll give it right back to you,
but you're not...

2200
01:30:15,976 --> 01:30:18,374
- Geez!
- Hey.

2201
01:30:18,376 --> 01:30:20,040
This is not really
a nice position

2202
01:30:20,042 --> 01:30:21,407
you put me in, you know?
I mean, I resent it...

2203
01:30:21,409 --> 01:30:22,807
I know.
You think I want to do this?

2204
01:30:22,809 --> 01:30:24,040
- ...very much.
- I fucked up.

2205
01:30:24,042 --> 01:30:25,374
I should've got
my own appraisal,

2206
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:27,241
but I didn't have
the time, so...

2207
01:30:27,243 --> 01:30:29,408
- How much they appraise it for?
- $200,000.

2208
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:31,641
- $200,000?
- Yeah, but these assholes...

2209
01:30:31,643 --> 01:30:33,008
What happened to 1....

2210
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:34,275
They don't have
an opal specialist.

2211
01:30:34,277 --> 01:30:36,841
- My guy at the AGL says...
- $200,000?

2212
01:30:36,843 --> 01:30:40,674
...500 just based off the
pictures, so listen, 20%,

2213
01:30:40,676 --> 01:30:42,475
I'll give you
for the winning bid.

2214
01:30:42,477 --> 01:30:43,875
Be a partner with me.

2215
01:30:43,877 --> 01:30:46,208
KG is gonna buy it.
It's not a problem.

2216
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:48,941
This guy is obsessed
with the stone.

2217
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:51,674
Today was supposed to be about
Aaron meeting KG.

2218
01:30:51,676 --> 01:30:53,442
Mm-hmm, Gooey.

2219
01:30:53,444 --> 01:30:55,408
To show support, that's what
today was supposed to be about.

2220
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:56,808
Well, this is support.

2221
01:30:56,810 --> 01:30:58,442
This is support like
you've never known.

2222
01:30:58,444 --> 01:31:02,075
AUCTIONEER: Sold to you.
Thank you so much, sir.

2223
01:31:02,077 --> 01:31:06,209
We move on now, ladies and
gentlemen, to lot number 38.

2224
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:07,610
Lot 38, eh?

2225
01:31:07,612 --> 01:31:10,009
We have a sale-room notice.

2226
01:31:10,011 --> 01:31:12,009
I'm required to inform you
all that this fine

2227
01:31:12,011 --> 01:31:13,809
Ethiopian black opal,

2228
01:31:13,811 --> 01:31:15,543
presented here
before you all on your left,

2229
01:31:15,545 --> 01:31:20,610
my right, is now offered with
a revised estimate of $155,000

2230
01:31:20,612 --> 01:31:23,309
to $225,000 U.S.

2231
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,942
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is a fine piece,

2232
01:31:25,944 --> 01:31:27,543
a collector's work,

2233
01:31:27,545 --> 01:31:31,109
and most importantly, it
is windowed on either side

2234
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:34,709
to reveal the full spectrum
of its dazzling color

2235
01:31:34,711 --> 01:31:37,209
and the pinfire pattern within.

2236
01:31:37,211 --> 01:31:39,076
So with that in mind,
ladies and gentlemen,

2237
01:31:39,078 --> 01:31:41,209
my colleagues are ready
and poised on the phones,

2238
01:31:41,211 --> 01:31:43,144
and you're all ready
with your paddles.

at $20,000.

$20,000.

2241
01:31:48,613 --> 01:31:49,943
Do I have $40,000?

01:31:49,945 --> 01:31:51,377
$40,000, gentleman's bid.

2243
01:31:51,379 --> 01:31:53,010

Do I see $50,000?

$50,00 now in a new place.
Thank you, sir.

2246
01:31:58,146 --> 01:31:59,577

$60,000 now
against you, sir.

01:32:03,613 --> 01:32:05,743

01:32:09,246 --> 01:32:12,077
Bid with you, sir, and a great

2253
01:32:12,079 --> 01:32:15,943
giant leap for a big, bold,
giant leaper at $100,000 now.

2254
01:32:15,945 --> 01:32:17,377
It's not longer yours, sir.

2255
01:32:17,379 --> 01:32:18,611
It's against you, sir.

2256
01:32:18,613 --> 01:32:20,078
Going to try one more, sir?

2257
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:21,978
I will even break an ink
with you, sir.

2258
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:25,011
Can I urge you to consider
a bid of $105,000, sir?

2259
01:32:25,013 --> 01:32:27,512
Come on, sir.
Are you sure?

2260
01:32:27,514 --> 01:32:29,311
Positive?
No further?

2261
01:32:29,313 --> 01:32:31,011
A defiant nod then.

2262
01:32:31,013 --> 01:32:33,044
Looking then for $110,000,
the room.

2263

It's $100,000 now.

01:32:37,813 --> 01:32:39,211
Welcome back, sir.

$110,000 now.
Once again against you, sir.

2268
01:32:40,846 --> 01:32:41,978
Shall we try $120,000?

2269
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:44,311
$120,000.
Try one more, sir?

2270
01:32:44,313 --> 01:32:46,911
Let's try $130,000?
$130,000 now?

2271
01:32:46,913 --> 01:32:49,844
To try $140,000?

Come on, sir.
Let's up it again to $150,000.

2273
01:32:52,447 --> 01:32:55,677
Try one more and $150,000.
Now longer yours, sir.

To try $160,000?
$160,000 now.

2275
01:32:58,481 --> 01:33:00,179
Back against you again, sir.

01:33:02,814 --> 01:33:05,446
$170,000 now.
Say $180,000?

2278
01:33:05,448 --> 01:33:06,613
Say $180,000, sir?

2279
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:07,945
We agreed on $175,000.

2280
01:33:07,947 --> 01:33:09,745

Against you, sir, $190,000.

- I am serious.

KEVIN: It's okay.
I need this stone.

2287
01:33:27,847 --> 01:33:30,179
Move this up any higher,
any further?

2288
01:33:30,181 --> 01:33:31,479
Relax. Relax.

2289
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:33,080
AUCTIONEER: It's a last chance
for you, sir.

2290
01:33:33,082 --> 01:33:34,213
- Are you serious?
- I have to move this along.

2291
01:33:34,215 --> 01:33:36,779
We have a good bid at $190,000.

You sure, sir?

2295
01:33:46,748 --> 01:33:48,547
Last chance, fair warning.

2296
01:33:48,549 --> 01:33:53,113
It's with you, sir, at $190,000,

that was gonna happen?

Arno, listen.
No bullshit.

2486
01:42:43,096 --> 01:42:46,027
Kevin Garnett
is coming to my office right now

2487
01:42:46,029 --> 01:42:48,861
with $175,000 cash.

2488
01:42:48,863 --> 01:42:51,562
Alright?
You said I got till Monday?

2489
01:42:51,564 --> 01:42:53,028
Today is still Monday,

2490
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:55,262
so I don't know
if you're hearing this.

2491
01:42:55,264 --> 01:42:56,794
But, Arno, this is real.

2492
01:42:56,796 --> 01:42:58,428
Kevin is really on the way.

2493
01:42:58,430 --> 01:42:59,961
He was just at the bank.

2494
01:42:59,963 --> 01:43:01,562
Come get your money, buddy.

2495
01:43:01,564 --> 01:43:03,995
- I need the Celtic ring back.
- What happened to Friday?

2496
01:43:03,997 --> 01:43:05,828
- I know. I know.
- It's Monday, Howie.

2497
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:07,162
- I know what we said.
- What did we say?

2498
01:43:07,164 --> 01:43:08,961
But it was a short
week, Pesach.

2499
01:43:08,963 --> 01:43:10,328
What happened to your face?

2500
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:12,961
- Car accident, okay?
- What do you need?

2501
01:43:12,963 --> 01:43:15,861
So, listen to me.
I need the Celtic ring.

2502
01:43:15,863 --> 01:43:17,262
I'm gonna give you
the Knicks ring.

2503
01:43:17,264 --> 01:43:19,728
Alright?
You know what that means to me.

2504
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:21,061
Swap them out, please.

2505
01:43:21,063 --> 01:43:22,362
You've had this Knicks
ring forever.

2506
01:43:22,364 --> 01:43:24,362
I just need
the Celtic ring back.

2507
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:26,029
- Alright?
- No, no.

2508
01:43:26,031 --> 01:43:27,463
HOWARD: What do you want to do?
What do you want to do?

2509
01:43:27,465 --> 01:43:28,829
I own that ring right now.

2510
01:43:28,831 --> 01:43:29,962
HOWARD: No, I know you do,
and I'm gonna...

2511
01:43:29,964 --> 01:43:31,329
So I'll swap you the two rings,

2512
01:43:31,331 --> 01:43:33,163
but I'm gonna put
a 15% VIG on this one.

2513
01:43:33,165 --> 01:43:34,862
And if you're not here
by Friday,

2514
01:43:34,864 --> 01:43:36,862
it's gonna be
the same thing all over again.

2515
01:43:36,864 --> 01:43:38,530
You're gonna have
a third ring.

2516
01:43:38,532 --> 01:43:40,163
You're not gonna have to worry
about that. Make it a 16%.

2517
01:43:40,165 --> 01:43:41,729
I'm sorry I fucked you,
but I have...

2518

Everything is going good.

Julia, let's get these guys
some Powerades.

2530
01:44:10,299 --> 01:44:12,364
Powerades?
Water? Anything else?

2531
01:44:12,366 --> 01:44:14,963
KEVIN: It's fine. I'm okay.
It's okay. Yeah, I'm good.

2532
01:44:14,965 --> 01:44:16,763
You like it cold.
You know that.

2533
01:44:16,765 --> 01:44:18,063
Howie, let me get a second
with you, okay?

2534
01:44:18,065 --> 01:44:19,497
HOWARD:
Yeah, sure, sure. Alright.

2535
01:44:19,499 --> 01:44:21,063
Kevin, you need to be
wheels-up at 8:00.

2536
01:44:21,065 --> 01:44:23,364
I got it.
Give me two seconds.

in less than 1 hour.

2538

Let me holler at you, man.
What the fuck is going on, man?

2539
01:44:27,232 --> 01:44:28,763
Ever since I met you, man,
you've been giving me

2540
01:44:28,765 --> 01:44:30,464
the run-around
with everything, man.

2541
01:44:30,466 --> 01:44:31,930
What do you mean?

2542
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:33,230
And I feel like you're fucking
with my emotions.

2543
01:44:33,232 --> 01:44:34,830
You just playing with me
at some point.

2544
01:44:34,832 --> 01:44:36,464
This hasn't been straight
since I came here.

2545
01:44:36,466 --> 01:44:38,264
- You understand?
- Why you saying that?

2546
01:44:38,266 --> 01:44:39,864
I borrowed the opal.
It's just one thing, you know?

2547
01:44:39,866 --> 01:44:41,565
I come back over here.
I brought it back.

2548
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:43,331
Howard, I brought it back.
I didn't have to bring it back.

2549
01:44:43,333 --> 01:44:44,797
You know, I show up
at the auction.

2550
01:44:44,799 --> 01:44:46,064
You had somebody bid against me?

2551
01:44:46,066 --> 01:44:47,298
All these fucking games,
like...

2552
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:49,165
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

2553
01:44:49,167 --> 01:44:50,498
Like, you don't know...
You don't think I know this?

2554
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,864
You don't think
I know none of this?

right here cash.

it's... it wasn't easy, man.

2559
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,764
6% goes to Demany.
I've already taken it out.

2560
01:45:02,766 --> 01:45:04,298
Alright. I guess.
I guess that's fair.

2561
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:05,831
Let me get the fucking opal,
man.

2562
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:07,265
Let me get the fuck
up out of here.

2563
01:45:07,267 --> 01:45:09,265
This opal, this opal
is very valuable for you.

2564
01:45:09,267 --> 01:45:10,964
- Absolutely.
- Okay? I did that.

2565
01:45:10,966 --> 01:45:12,931
Let me get the fuck
out of this...

2566
01:45:12,933 --> 01:45:15,797
I respect you. I respect your
passion. Okay?

2567
01:45:15,799 --> 01:45:16,965
I always have.

2568
01:45:16,967 --> 01:45:18,999
I thought you was
a fan, too, man.

2569
01:45:19,001 --> 01:45:21,199
- I'm a fucking huge fan.
- What did you pay for this?

2570
01:45:21,201 --> 01:45:22,865
Real shit, what did you pay
for this right here?

2571
01:45:22,867 --> 01:45:25,732
That's not a fair question,
Kevin. Alright?

2572
01:45:25,734 --> 01:45:27,965
This... We're talking months
and months of fucking my time.

2573

I'm not gonna take
the money back

2574
01:45:29,234 --> 01:45:30,999
when I did the deal now.
I'm just saying.

2575
01:45:31,001 --> 01:45:32,599
Straight up, straight up me
and you, mano a mano,

2576
01:45:32,601 --> 01:45:35,132
[DOORBELL RINGS]
how much did you pay for this?

2577
01:45:35,134 --> 01:45:38,065
Fucking what'd I pay?
I paid a... that's...

this is... that's...
I'm telling you.

2579

If I answer that question,
it's very misleading.

- Why?
- It's...

2581

I paid 100 grand, okay?

2582
01:45:46,434 --> 01:45:48,965

from Ethiopia 100 grand

was worth $1 million.

Doesn't that make you want to
say, "Fuck you for doubting me"?

2612
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:49,501

to step on fucking
