1
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:08,714
I've got you now.

2
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,229
That's it, my little
misunderstood friend.

3
00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:25,491
Nibble the powdery
cinnamon bliss.

4
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,894
No! Your path ends in death!

5
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:34,770
(woman screams)

6
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:43,173
(baby cries)

7
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:44,978
(baby giggles)

8
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:46,916
(people gasp)

9
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:27,218
Nooooooo!

10
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,071
You have been
saved. No charge.

11
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:47,913
Aaargh!

12
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:52,615
This is certainly
an ironic situation,

13
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:55,154
with an apex predator
there and me over here,

14
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:58,419
holding this little guy at the
bottom of the food chain and all.

15
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:00,983
Hey, Mom! Look what I found.

16
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:06,990
Ace Irwin Ventura, get out of that habitat and
away from that man-eating alligator this instant!

17
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:08,659
OK.

18
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,396
Stay!

19
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,869
Aaaaargh!

20
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,705
- How many times have I told y ou?
- A million.

21
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:21,042
- Visiting me...
... is a privilege.

22
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:25,642
- And this is the last time I get to come
here if I'm...... going to behave this way.

23
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:28,244
- I'm serious, Ace.
- You're alway s serious, Mom.

24
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:33,953
- And do y ou knowwhy?
- Because y ou're not gonnalose me like y ou lost Dad.

25
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:38,896
I'm sorry, Mom. I don't knowwhy
I had to save him, I just did.

26
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,594
It's a mouse, Ace.

27
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,728
That's why we have traps here.

28
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:48,740
You are not - I repeat, not -
responsible for every stray animal

29
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:51,299
in every corner
of this planet.

30
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:57,341
- I'm not?
- No!

31
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:01,050
Now give me the mouse.

32
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:07,892
And the hedgehog.

33
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:12,792
And the guinea pig.

34
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,993
And the ferret.

35
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:17,863
And the toad.

36
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:20,498
Oh! There we go.

37
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:23,771
What?

38
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:26,744
- Baby gator.
- What baby gator?

39
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:31,216
Fine. Here.

40
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:33,983
Nowy ou're late for
school. Let's go.

41
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:36,045
- Hey, what's that?
- Ace!

42
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:39,853
- What's going on over here?
- Honey. Honey, come back here.

43
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,917
- Ace. OK, look...
- Pong Ping?

44
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:46,557
The Chinese governmentloaned us Pong Ping
and Ting Tang, the world's mostfamous pandas.

45
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,834
There's gonna be an
unveiling nextweek. Now...

46
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:52,167
I know. I promise.

47
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:56,868
No try ing to find missing pets
or helping animals or any thing.

48
00:04:56,943 --> 00:05:02,575
- Even if they're about to get run over.
- OK, that's notwhat I mean.

49
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:05,743
And I will try to be normal.

50
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,688
Thank y ou, A.J. Nowwill
y ou please go to school?

51
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:12,384
OK.

52
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,726
(bell rings)

53
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,293
(Ace Jr.) Normal.

54
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:20,890
Normal.

55
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:25,233
Must be normal.

56
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:27,830
(boy) Tara, is it true
what happened to y our pet?

57
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:33,004
Yeah. I woke up this morning and my
pet rabbit Mimzy was totally gone.

58
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:36,780
Rabbit. Mimzy. Lost!

59
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,048
- Of course we're depressed.
- Our skunk's been missing twwo weeks.

60
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:43,419
We're emotional
wrecks about it.

61
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:47,815
I will be normal.

62
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:52,231
- My friend can'tfind her chinchilla.
- (boy) This is really weird.

63
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:55,165
It's an animal-nabbing
epidemic!

64
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:58,329
- (boy) Laura, what abouty ou?
- You think that's bad?

65
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:03,570
The other day, Greeny, my incredibly rare
emerald-green koi fish, vanished out of the aquarium.

66
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:06,271
Aargh!

67
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:14,620
(PA) Yourattention, please.
I have some sad news.

68
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:18,055
Mr. Chompers, ourbeloved
swim-team mascot, has gone missing.

69
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:19,557
(all) Awww.

70
00:06:19,626 --> 00:06:25,326
Any studentwith information is requested
to reportto the pool immediately.

71
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,971
Well, he's gone.

72
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,303
Do y ou know where
our mascot is or not?

73
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:40,779
- Well, I wouldn't say I knowwhere he is.
- Buty ou knowwho took him?

74
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:43,782
- Not exactly.
- Buty ou have some kind oflead?

75
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,183
- Define "lead. "
- Forget this loser.

76
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:49,585
No. Wait! I can find him.

77
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:54,025
- What makes y ou think that?
- I just... know I can.

78
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:57,188
Ooh, what are y ou?
Some kind of pet...

79
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:04,031
finder guy?

80
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:06,095
(girls laugh)

81
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:13,004
Just give me four day s.
What have y ou got to lose?

82
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,274
You got 72 hours.

83
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,577
OK. 72 hours.

84
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:21,313
That's like... twwo weeks.

85
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:22,877
That's great!

86
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,285
(dog barks)

87
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:29,988
I knowwhat Mom said, but this
is important. She won'tfind out.

88
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:32,691
(whimpers)

89
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:37,260
Cowboy up, dog, because we're
notjust gonna go find Mr. Chompers.

90
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:40,534
I hear a whole lot oflost
pets calling my name.

91
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:43,239
(rings bell)

92
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:51,874
That'll do it.

93
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:56,081
- This is the busiest intersection in town, Ox.
- (brakes screech and carcrashes)

94
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:58,750
Thousands of people
will see this.

95
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:04,662
Recognize y our Mimzy?

96
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:07,564
- No.
- Number three, hop to the right.

97
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:10,125
Uh-oh. Number one
justwent number twwo.

98
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:12,728
Numberfour, stop doing
that to number three!

99
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,502
Would y ou guy s
stop multiply ing?

100
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:19,043
Well, how about now?

101
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:21,546
Lost hamster. Milk for Milton.

102
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:24,674
Help find Milton.
Runaway rodent.

103
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:27,777
Do a brother a solid.
Milk for Milton.

104
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,788
Please, help find Milton.

105
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,187
- I found Milton!
- No. Uh-uh.

106
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:36,117
I didn'tfind Milton.

107
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:42,692
Offensive action!
Three, twwo, one.

108
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:44,634
(both fart)

109
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:49,470
(skunk splutters)

110
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:51,407
Now, that's offensive.

111
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:55,743
- Stop toy ing with our emotions.
- That's not Breezy, moron!

112
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:58,147
- (girl) Skunk!
- (girls scream)

113
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:08,283
Waaaaah!

114
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:12,024
It's called "papering
the town," Oxnard.

115
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,295
Avery effective method for
disseminating information.

116
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:30,146
(Ox barks)

117
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:36,382
That's not true. I treat every one of my missing
pets exactly the same, no matterwho they belong to.

118
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,653
Well, here we are, Ox.

119
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:41,887
Casa de Laura Wilson's house.

120
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:44,924
- The scene of the crime.
- (barks)

121
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:50,393
Sorry, old friend. Now's not the
time to tell Laura how I feel.

122
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,904
- (Ox barks)
- I am not scared to talk to her.

123
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:55,099
(Ox growls)

124
00:09:55,174 --> 00:10:00,305
Oh, y ou think so, huh? Yeah,
well, watch and learn, Puppy Chow.

125
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,510
We'll find her pet, and then I'll
find time to express how I really feel.

126
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:08,247
- Hi, Ace.
- (shoutss) Oh, my God, y ou're pretty!

127
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:12,053
- What?
- (Ox whimpers)

128
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,319
Um...

129
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,657
Your koi fish.

130
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:18,720
She's itty-bitty.

131
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,857
Yeah, she sure is.

132
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:24,293
Much like a grunion.

133
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,635
Stand aside, ma'am. Clues
don'tfind themselves, y ou know.

134
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:30,267
Oxnard, while I'm y oung?

135
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,838
Crime scene is secure.
No sign of forced entries.

136
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:38,577
Initial suspects include the
scuba man and the treasure chest.

137
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:49,384
Rememberwhen I brought her into school
as part of my report on unusual animals?

138
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:52,329
The next morning when I
woke up, Greeny was gone.

139
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:54,389
Really?

140
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:00,570
Case number 349A49320451.

141
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,733
Neptune-Alpha-Charlie-Horse.

142
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:06,108
Missing green koi
fish. Answers to Greeny.

143
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:09,872
Question. Have y ou
tried calling her?

144
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:12,611
- Calling her? She's
a fish. - Uh-uh-uh.

145
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,555
- May I?
- Sure.

146
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:26,929
(gargles) Greeny!

147
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,492
Greeny! Greeny!

148
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:34,638
Greeny!

149
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:36,698
Yoo-hoo!

150
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:41,607
- Well, she's gone.
- Yeah.

151
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:44,373
Owner is one Laura Wilson.

152
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,181
Smart, funny,
greatlistener. (sniffs)

153
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:51,052
Excellent personal hy giene,

154
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:53,854
a smile that'll make y ou
feel like pudding inside

155
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:56,520
and skin like
peaches and cream.

156
00:11:57,263 --> 00:12:01,063
Exceptfor may be this one spot
on her perfectly formed chin.

157
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:04,797
- Possibly a pimple?
- A pimple? Where?!

158
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:07,499
- Oh, I'm such an idiot.
- (barks)

159
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:10,041
No one asked y ou. Um...

160
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,134
Oxnard and I
must be going now.

161
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:17,148
Anyw way, y our collection of aquatic friends
will have their emerald companion back in...

162
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:19,275
- (clock ticks)
- (bell chimes)

163
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:20,717
...three day s.

164
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:23,187
- Really?
- I promise.

165
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:27,024
You broke y our promise.
What did I tell y ou?

166
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:31,996
That I'm not responsible for the well-being of
every stray animal in every corner of the planet.

167
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:36,934
- But, Mom, I had to.
- Do y ou think I like scooping poop all day? I don't.

168
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:41,634
I got this job so y ou could see animals
as much as y ou want, when y ou want,

169
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:44,039
safely and with
complete supervision.

170
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,510
Yeah, but it's
not the same, OK?

171
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:50,413
I want to find lost
animals. I love it.

172
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:54,442
OK, I tried every other extracurricular
activity y ou wanted me to

173
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,545
and I mastered them all.

174
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:03,055
What?

175
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:04,926
(sings loudly) Aaaaaaaaaah!

176
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:11,300
Next.

177
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:15,801
(blows whistle)

178
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,843
Bananas.

179
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,402
P- r-e-t-t-y.
Pretty.

180
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,881
- (man) That is correct.
- (applause)

181
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,580
Yourword is
"antidisestablishmentarianism. "

182
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:31,950
P- r-e-t-t-y.

183
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:34,117
- Pretty.
- (buzzer)

184
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:45,030
(sniffs)

185
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:50,768
- This was a dumb idea!
- (loud splash)

186
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:57,806
Aaaaaargh! Argh!

187
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:01,411
OK, may be I didn't
master all of them,

188
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:04,786
but may be athletics
aren't my calling.

189
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,920
W- wait, was Dad an athlete?

190
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:10,155
A good speller?
An entertainer?

191
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:14,029
This is not abouty our dad.
We'll talk about him another time.

192
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,196
- Mom, y ou alway s say that.
- I'm not ready for that talk y et.

193
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:20,671
- We can have itwhen y ou're older.
- (Ox burps)

194
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,143
I am older, Mom. I'm 12 y ears old and I'm
starting to have all these weird feelings

195
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:27,236
and I don't have a dad for...

196
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:29,372
"that talk. "

197
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:34,410
Honey, every body y our
age has those feelings.

198
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:36,546
No, Mom. (slurps noisily)

199
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:42,392
Not these feelings.

200
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:50,798
That's it! You are not eating out of a dog bowl,
y ou are not sticking y our head out of a carwindow

201
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,364
and y ou'll use the toiletfor something other
than drinking. You'll be like other kids!

202
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:58,308
- But, Mom, this is who I am.
- No, it's not.

203
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:00,641
It's who y ou're acting like.

204
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,233
(panda squeals)

205
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:28,866
(panda roars)

206
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:31,171
(pandas whine)

207
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:41,743
Huh?!

208
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:57,066
(fartss)

209
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,560
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mom.

210
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:58,722
- Hey, what's with that hat on?
- What hat?

211
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:02,461
- Ace.
- It's what all the kids are doing.

212
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:06,904
You said y ou wanted me to
be like them, so here y ou go.

213
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:10,705
Not at the table.

214
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:25,587
Mom. Mom, the cereal!

215
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:27,922
- Oh, my God.
- What?

216
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:30,291
- It's happening.
- What is it?

217
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:32,627
(man) Puty our hands up!

218
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:38,563
Stay still!

219
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:42,534
Don't move!

220
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:46,204
- Melissa Ventura?
- Yeah.

221
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:50,044
Oh, wow. One more punch
and y ou get a free y ogurt.

222
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,644
What? "The Cinnamon Hippo"?
Is thatlike Chuck E Cheese?

223
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,053
Never mind that.
Russell Hollander, NBFW.

224
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:03,187
- National Bureau of Fish and Wildlife.
- Smart kid. I'm in charge here.

225
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:08,723
Do y ou have any idea how often they let a
member of Fish and Wildlife lead a SWAT team?

226
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:13,465
Yeah. Never. You guy s don't
even get badges. You wear patches.

227
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:17,236
Give me that. I'll have y ou arrested
for assaulting a federal officer.

228
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:21,075
OK, fine. Jeez. But, technically,
police dogs outrank y ou.

229
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:24,548
- (man) Ranger Hollander? They're towing y our car, sir.
- Again?

230
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:27,814
(Melissa) Wait. Can'ty ou just
tell us whaty ou're looking for?

231
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:34,224
Your case is the biggest in history. They're calling guy s
back from Alaska for this. Play ing dumb isn't gonna work.

232
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:39,230
You left alot of evidence at the scene, Mrs.
Ventura. We found y our shoeprints all over the place.

233
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:43,257
- In English, Ranger Smith.
- Ting Tang has been stolen.

234
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:46,901
My mom works for the zoo. Of
course her prints are there.

235
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:50,271
And y our bank accounts show y
ou live pay check-to-pay check.

236
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:53,277
I suspect a panda cub brings
big bucks on the black market.

237
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:55,836
We've found something, sir!

238
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:00,909
What is this?

239
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:09,623
- Your ransom note?
- Somebody sent that. I don't even knowwhat it means.

240
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,426
- And this.
- A tranquilizer gun.

241
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:17,401
- Sir, y ourfinger... prints.
- Recently fired.

242
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,031
They give us all tranquilizer guns.
I used it to sedate a chimpanzee.

243
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:25,042
Thatwas actually very funny. He grabbed
this tourist's leg and started...

244
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,941
That's enough, Ace.

245
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:29,537
Melissa Ventura,

246
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:31,776
y ou're under arrest.

247
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:33,978
- What? (snarls and growls)
- Whoa, whoa!

248
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:36,283
Down, boy! Down, boy!
Down, boy! Down! Down!

249
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:37,549
(snarls)

250
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:42,617
It's all been a mistake. This has all been a mistake.
There y ou go. There we go. We'll sort it all out.

251
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:46,654
That's so good. It's like
chocolate. Mm. They're so addictive.

252
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,127
(gasps)

253
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:56,541
- (Hollander) Come on.
- Not until I make a call for someone to stay with my son.

254
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,643
- Give her the cellphone.
- Mom, I'll find Ting Tang.

255
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:04,945
No. You promised. I don'twanty
ou to do any thing, Ace.

256
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:07,911
One call.

257
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:13,187
- OK, while y ou walk. Come on.
- I'm gonna call his grandfather.

258
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:16,990
But, Mom, Grandpa's gonna be on
a cruise for anotherfourweeks.

259
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:20,293
- I'm calling y our other grandpa.
- What other grandpa?

260
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:22,231
Grandpa...

261
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:27,067
- Ventura.
- Huh?

262
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:30,641
Rex? It's Melissa.

263
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:36,408
(coughing and wheezing)

264
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:42,180
(coughing continues)

265
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:54,799
Come on, Spark.
Come on, Spark.

266
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:57,233
Sorry about that.

267
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:03,640
Hello, Ace.

268
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,336
Grandpa?

269
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,574
First thing, y
our mom is fine.

270
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:12,777
She's gonna have a bail hearing
on Friday. You can see her then.

271
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:15,353
(wheezes)

272
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:17,753
(coughs)

273
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:22,861
Darn hairballs.
What can y ou do?

274
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:24,953
My cat's on his eighth life.

275
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,999
There are some spots he's
simply too old to lick himself.

276
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:29,557
(retches)

277
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:31,034
(coughs)

278
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:37,633
- Too much information.
- Well, Ace, I haven't seen y ou since y ou were a baby.

279
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,372
What are y ou now? 84?

280
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:43,381
- Grandpa, I'm 12.
- Right. Dog y ears.

281
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:45,781
84 y ears old.

282
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:49,311
I'll bety ou're helping
animals by now, aren'ty ou?

283
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,788
Come on, show me y our office.

284
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:57,127
Come on, Sparky. Come
on, Sparky. Here we go.

285
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:58,891
Attaboy.

286
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:02,491
So, these are the animals y
ou're try ing to find, huh?

287
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:06,197
Well, I was, but then Mom
said itwas too dangerous.

288
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:09,001
Re-he-eally?

289
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:18,746
(Laura) Hi, Ace.

290
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:23,482
- You obsess much?
- What? About Laura? No, not really.

291
00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:26,615
Sometimes. May be. Yeah, I do.

292
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:31,061
- Hey, Grandpa, can I ask y ou a question?
- Sure thing.

293
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,928
Whatwas my dad like?

294
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:37,333
Well, what did y our
mom tell y ou about him?

295
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:41,772
Nothing. She say s that he disappeared
on a business trip when I was a baby

296
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,035
and that I'm too y
oung to know the rest.

297
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:48,375
Yeah, well, y our mom's got good reasons
why she doesn'twant to talk about him.

298
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:50,438
But can I ask y ou this?

299
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:54,953
Have y ou everwondered why y
ou keep looking forlost animals?

300
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,319
- Because...
- Because why?

301
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,985
- I don't know.
- Because y ou're a Ventura!

302
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:05,989
AVentura.

303
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:12,796
Now, although it took along time for
our ancestors to develop a kinship

304
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:14,998
with the animal world,

305
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,508
eventually, we won them over.

306
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:20,136
Even the carnivores.

307
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:23,547
Down through history,
the Venturaline continued,

308
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:26,914
including Charles
Ventura Darwin.

309
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:29,510
You knowwho he was, don'ty ou?

310
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:31,647
He was the
evolution guy, right?

311
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:38,027
Survival of the least
loo-hoo-hoo-oser-est.

312
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:42,790
Did y ou know a Ventura
would never harm an animal?

313
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:48,602
One of y our ancestors, the greatAntarctic
explorer Sir ErnestVentura Shackleton.

314
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:53,304
Although he and his crewwere starving
to death, they would not eat a penguin.

315
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:56,472
Jacques Ventura Cousteau,

316
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:58,982
who invented the scuba suit

317
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:03,249
so thatfinally man could
commune with his watery brethren.

318
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:05,882
Itfitlike a glove.

319
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:11,624
So, y ou see, Ace Jr., the Venturaline
has along and storied career

320
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:13,688
of animal advocacy,

321
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:17,930
communion and
search and rescue.

322
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:21,666
Well, was my dad like
the other Venturas?

323
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:26,239
I've probably said
too much already,

324
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:30,338
buty our mom was in trouble and
I thoughty ou needed to know.

325
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:35,045
So, whaty ou're say ing is that I
should go out and try to find Ting Tang?

326
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,556
I'm not say ing any thing.

327
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,688
I'm just say ing.

328
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,354
Say ing what?

329
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,596
Your Y chromosome has
the Ventura mutation.

330
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:53,160
You're one of us.

331
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,305
- Come on, Sparky.
- Um... Grandpa, I'm...

332
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:01,107
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

333
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:05,816
He's not dead. He's sleeping.

334
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:09,081
Come on. Did y ou hearwhat
he said? My goodness.

335
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:11,588
My goodness!

336
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:19,054
(grunting)

337
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:34,275
Hey, if I say over the wall, it's over
the wall. Don't be a maverick. Let's go.

338
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:35,438
Aaaargh!

339
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:41,975
Jeez! I didn't know the
lunch lady had a nightjob.

340
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:47,449
(Hollander) "Russell
Hollander, NBFW CSl: Orlando. "

341
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:53,555
I like the way that sounds. I left no
stone unturned, no clue undiscovered.

342
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:56,294
Case closed, Melissa Ventura.

343
00:25:56,935 --> 00:26:01,668
- You are guilty. - That guy is
one big-time sick monkey, my friend.

344
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,469
(growls)

345
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:24,587
Case number 349A49320452.
Alpha-Beta-Delta-Airlines.

346
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:27,496
Missing panda cub.
Answers to Ting Tang.

347
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:31,195
Or, if y ou speak
Panda, "Grrrrr. "

348
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:34,467
On loan from
national government.

349
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,564
Country: China.

350
00:26:36,642 --> 00:26:40,100
Crime scene shows no
sign of disturbance.

351
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:43,011
As expected, my mom's
shoeprints are everyw where.

352
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:45,413
And the only other
prints are panda...

353
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:48,344
Or are they?

354
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:53,289
Holy roly-poly!

355
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:58,360
- I knew it.
- (Pong Ping growls)

356
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:01,761
Uh-oh.

357
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:07,705
Hey, look, Pong Ping,
I'm a family friend.

358
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:11,368
I knewy our uncle when he
was here. Chan Chin, or...

359
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:16,839
Uh, Bing Bang, or...

360
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:20,442
Hong Kong? Wang Chung?

361
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,885
(growls sorrowfully)

362
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,390
You miss y our cub?

363
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:31,252
Yeah, I miss my mom, too.

364
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:38,102
But I found some really
important clues while I was here.

365
00:27:39,438 --> 00:27:41,099
(Pong Ping whines)

366
00:27:42,307 --> 00:27:44,901
I'm not the world's
greatest, uh...

367
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:48,206
pet sleuth?

368
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:53,014
Finder? Investigator?
I don't know.

369
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:55,110
But...

370
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:56,916
but I'll try.

371
00:27:56,989 --> 00:27:59,184
I promise.

372
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:19,242
Hey, kid! Are y ou
Arnold Plushinski?

373
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:21,643
Yeah, but call
me A-Plus. Aargh!

374
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:24,841
(boy) You're dead,
Plushinski! I mean it!

375
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,713
Move!

376
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:28,844
Uh-oh. That can't be good.

377
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,785
(girls scream)

378
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:37,528
(computerized voice) Proximityy
alert. Proximityy alert. Prox...

379
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:41,464
Just give up the gummies,
Plushinski, and the horrorwill end!

380
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,501
Never!

381
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,462
Excuse me.

382
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:49,173
Move!

383
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:58,209
Argh! Aaargh!

384
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:04,944
Move it! Get out of the way!

385
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:09,756
Where is he? You can't hide
the gummies forever, Plushinski!

386
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:15,395
Where'd he go?

387
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,561
(bell rings)

388
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,273
Hello?

389
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:33,112
A- Plus?

390
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:35,653
(A-Plus) Why are
y ou talking to me?

391
00:29:37,222 --> 00:29:41,921
- Who just said that? - (A-Plus) No
one ever talks to me, except bullies.

392
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:44,154
You're not gonna
beat me up, are y ou?

393
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:47,357
No. I need y our help.

394
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:50,728
(A-Plus) Oh. In here.

395
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:08,583
What the...

396
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:10,052
(loudly) Awesome!

397
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:16,323
(whispers) Awesome.

398
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:36,076
Holy cellar-dweller, Batman!

399
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:39,481
This place is... How
did y ou build this?

400
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:43,885
This whole place was forgotten about
during a renovation, but I found a way in.

401
00:30:43,955 --> 00:30:46,423
Made my lab.

402
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,789
I can't believe
I have a friend

403
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,296
and I didn't even have to
grow him in a petri dish.

404
00:30:52,731 --> 00:30:56,098
Oh, my God, those
are giant gummy worms.

405
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:58,432
Hey! Uh, st...

406
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:00,664
- That's a bully-tracking
device. - Huh?

407
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:03,640
They transmit to my GPS here.

408
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:07,701
A bully eats a harmless-looking candy
and it gets into his digestive tract.

409
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:10,577
I can track him
for up to 18 hours.

410
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:13,140
- 12 if he eats chili.
- Ugh!

411
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:15,243
So, how can I help y ou...

412
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,447
friend?

413
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:21,856
Um... I have some measurements
that I need analyz zed.

414
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:27,957
(Ace Jr.) These printss are 1.5mm deep, as
differentiated from these, which are 2.3mm

415
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:30,126
and these, which are 5mm.

416
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:35,765
Fascinating, Captain. These measurements clearly
indicate prints made by three different organisms,

417
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,673
weighing approximately 125Ibs,

418
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:41,211
183.253Ibs

419
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,214
and 390Ibs respectively.

420
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:48,413
So, any thing else?

421
00:31:48,486 --> 00:31:54,652
Howlong would it take for y ou to hack into
a website called "wwww. pandafanatic. com"?

422
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:58,457
We're in like Tolkien. Here's a
picture of the guy who runs the site.

423
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:03,433
His email address is
m. sickinger@penningtoncorp. net.

424
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:08,932
Pennington Corporation. That's
Pennington Jr. 's father's company.

425
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:13,034
- Oh, he's so cool.
- Isn't that the kid who rides to school in the limousine?

426
00:32:13,111 --> 00:32:16,239
Yes. And he's
extraordinarily popular.

427
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:20,717
Of all the tables in the cafeteria,
his is the furthest away from mine.

428
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:22,844
(snortss with laughter)

429
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:25,856
- Do y ou mind if I keep one of these?
- Of course.

430
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:28,893
OK. I'll just...
I'll just, um...

431
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,019
be on my way.

432
00:32:31,896 --> 00:32:34,729
I'll be on my way. I
will talk to y ou later.

433
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,758
Really? And y ou won't even pretend
like I'm not there or give me a swirly?

434
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:41,601
- No, no.
- Awesome!

435
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,272
(whines)

436
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,612
- (Ace Jr.) Grandpa, I'm pretty sure he's dead.
- No!

437
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:53,276
He's just a good actor.

438
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:55,410
Dead dogs don't get dinner.

439
00:32:55,487 --> 00:32:56,920
(whimpers)

440
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:59,916
Huh. All right.

441
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:10,127
Hard day at the office?

442
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:13,500
It's just that I found all
these clues to help Mom's case,

443
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:17,234
but to do that, I had to
break my promise to her.

444
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:20,676
So, y ou're working on a case?

445
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:24,411
- Yeah.
- You knowwhat they call those working on cases?

446
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:27,417
Yeah. Cops.

447
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:32,445
Face it, Grandpa. I'm just a kid who
lied to his mom. I don't knowwhat to do.

448
00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:36,483
Well, y ou can start
by being who y ou are.

449
00:33:37,762 --> 00:33:39,957
Who y ou were born to be.

450
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:46,067
Now, ly ing to y
our mom is one thing,

451
00:33:46,137 --> 00:33:48,503
butly ing to y
ourself, Ace Jr...

452
00:33:49,741 --> 00:33:53,336
Son, thatleads to
alife of disappointment.

453
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:12,890
That's not normal.

454
00:34:12,964 --> 00:34:16,456
I will be normal.

455
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:19,469
Hah!

456
00:34:19,537 --> 00:34:24,304
Hi, this is Pennington Jr. With
a very special message justforyou.

457
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:27,504
You're invited to my
birthday partyy. Lucky you.

458
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:30,139
(murmurs) Yes, I'm
invited. I'm invited.

459
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:33,673
- I'm invited!
- (all cheer)

460
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:36,482
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Press.

461
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:40,320
Perez Ventura. I'm here
to interview Pennington Jr.

462
00:34:40,392 --> 00:34:43,987
- Not on the list.
- List? Whatlist? I don't care about no stinking list!

463
00:34:44,062 --> 00:34:47,361
I'm with the Daily Rumor Mill.

464
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:50,833
School paper. Familiarwith
freedom of the press?

465
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:54,929
It's in something called the
Constitution. You should read it sometime.

466
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:59,036
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't Taser
me, bro. First-Amendmentviolation.

467
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,203
(clicks fingers)
Let him through.

468
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:03,509
(man) Put him down, boy s.

469
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:04,878
(camera clicks)

470
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:11,912
That's admissible evidence. I haven't been humiliated like
this since they started making us shower after P.E. Ugh!

471
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,886
We're on a tight schedule.
You got three minutes.

472
00:35:18,963 --> 00:35:21,090
(camera clicks)

473
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:24,431
Is that a forest up there? Man,
y ou gotta clip those nose hairs.

474
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:26,800
You could make a
teddy bear out of that.

475
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:29,203
Wow.

476
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:34,976
- You cleaned up Big Foot here real nice.
- We pride ourselves on good relations with the press.

477
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:38,914
But the invitations have been recorded.
There's really nothing I can do.

478
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:42,578
- (man) Waiter, lunch.
- Please, take this pass.

479
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:47,956
Itwill gety ou into the gy mnasium on the day of
the party, where we'll be webcasting the whole thing.

480
00:35:48,026 --> 00:35:52,725
- It'll make headlines.
- Oh, that's terrific, sport. Here's a fewfor y ou.

481
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:56,198
"Billionaire Boy In
Liposuction Incident. "

482
00:35:56,267 --> 00:36:02,228
Or, "I Had Pennington Jr. 's Alien
Love Baby. " I'm greatwith Photoshop.

483
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:06,437
You're threatening to blackmail
me unless I give y ou information.

484
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:09,071
I'm a paparazzi.
It's what I do.

485
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:13,584
But I will get off y our back
if y ou tell me about this guy.

486
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:21,920
Dr. Michael Sickinger. A brilliant scientist
who worked for our animal-genetics laboratory.

487
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:24,723
- It's one of the finest.
- Indubitably.

488
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:27,765
Unfortunately,
he's quite insane.

489
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:31,327
- Incontinently.
- He harbors a bizarre hatred for pandas.

490
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:34,496
Incomprehensibly. Does he
still work for y ourfather?

491
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:37,040
Oh, no. We fired him
just a fewweeks ago.

492
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:43,274
I believe he's now the chief of non-telegenic
species research at the Dinosaur Fossils Foundation.

493
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:51,351
- What?
- I don't knowwhat it means either. Ask him y ourself.

494
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:53,322
Oh, I will.

495
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:58,994
By e-by e, then. Every
shot I take, a Picasso.

496
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:02,656
No touching the camera!

497
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:07,933
- Where is my rabbit, loser?
- Nice to see y ou too, Tara.

498
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:10,474
You were supposed to
find Breezy a week ago.

499
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:15,980
- You owe us for the extra therapy session.
- I can't comment on an ongoing investigation.

500
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:20,108
Argh! Holy magenta! You guy
s looklike a box of cray ons.

501
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:21,481
Uh-oh!

502
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:23,544
Why do y ou alway
s travel in a flock?

503
00:37:23,621 --> 00:37:30,584
Ladies, is this really necessary? Can'twe talk this over
like civilized adults? You can IM me and I'll texty ou back.

504
00:37:30,662 --> 00:37:33,392
You said I had 72 hours!

505
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,699
- You've had eight day s.
- Two kinds of people, people.

506
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:44,299
- People that pee in the pool and people who lie about it.
- Find Mr. Chompers or go swimming again tomorrow.

507
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:45,706
(bell rings)

508
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:51,408
(girls laugh)

509
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:53,347
(imitates girls'laughter)

510
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,452
- What?
- Get to class, Ventura.

511
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:05,556
I gotta break into Dr. Sickinger's
office so y ou can upload his hard drive.

512
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:09,066
(A-Plus) Oh, I can
only do that in my lab.

513
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:13,869
Would y ou get out of there?
Come on, the coast is clear.

514
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:19,172
- Sounds like a three-man job. Hey, why are
y ou all we... - (shoutss angry gibberish)

515
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:21,871
...with the wet, OK?

516
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:24,779
About the three-man job.

517
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:29,081
I know someone. But it's gonna
take all my power of persuasion

518
00:38:29,153 --> 00:38:33,590
to convince this beautiful animal-lover
to commit alevel-five felony.

519
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:37,355
Please help me break into
the Dinosaur Fossil Foundation

520
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:43,628
so we can stop the guy who stole Ting Tang
and save my mom before she's sent to prison!

521
00:38:43,701 --> 00:38:45,669
Um... OK.

522
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:48,629
- Really?
- Yeah.

523
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:54,000
- Are those from my mom's garden?
- Nah.

524
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:55,909
Shut up.

525
00:38:57,915 --> 00:39:01,112
Right this way,
folks. Stick together.

526
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:07,690
OK.

527
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:10,159
You are all in for a
very special treat -

528
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:14,392
the rarest, most complete
tyrannosaur skeleton in existence.

529
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:18,561
It has an estimated
value of $100 million.

530
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:20,570
Uh-huh.

531
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:24,973
Do not touch it.

532
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:29,472
- $100 million?
- You wanty ourfish back, y ou're hot?

533
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:32,015
"Or not?" Don'tworry,
this plan is gravy.

534
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:37,545
Every body, stay close.
We're on a tight schedule.

535
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:45,760
- Oh, a T. Rex. Cool.
- I'm sorry, sir. No pets allowed.

536
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,821
He's my Seeing Ey e dog.

537
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:50,197
He's facing backwards.

538
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:52,930
And y ou're not blind.

539
00:39:53,004 --> 00:39:55,165
I can see again! I can see!

540
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:57,764
It's a miracle!
It's a miracle!

541
00:39:57,842 --> 00:40:01,835
- Sir. I mean it, y ou...
- Fine. I'll take him off.

542
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,574
I'm so sorry about all this.

543
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:15,959
- Make him stop doing that!
- He's a dog, it's a bone. Do the math.

544
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:17,688
Wha...

545
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:23,132
Oh. Oh, jeez. Oxnard Hueneme Carpinteria
Ventura, y ou get back here right now!

546
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:26,693
Sir, that is a priceless skeleton
unearthed in the Bad Lands...

547
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:29,262
Please! This thing's
lasted millions of y ears.

548
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,776
- It's going to survive alittle doggy love nibble.
- (crunch)

549
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:42,652
May be not.

550
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,348
Oh!

551
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:52,925
OK. OK. I told y ou itwould work. Now go.
I'll meety ou in the dinosaur cavern. Go.

552
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:02,305
Security!

553
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:15,910
- (man) Have y ou seen alittle kid run past here?
- Come on, let's go!

554
00:41:52,723 --> 00:41:58,628
- A-Plus, are y ou there? - Affirmative.
This is so cool. Now I have twwo friends.

555
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:00,926
Let's starta band. Do
you play an instrument?

556
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:04,900
I used to play the bagpipes,
butmy legs are too skinnyfora kilt.

557
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:08,803
Come on! I'm in the office and it's
really freaky in here. Tell me what to do.

558
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:18,980
Ohhh! Argh!

559
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:23,481
(man) Don'tlet him get
away! He went this way!

560
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:26,523
(man #2) That's him!

561
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:30,724
Aaargh! Oh!

562
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:38,592
OK. Your program's running.

563
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:41,866
- Oh, one otherthing.
- What?

564
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:48,273
In my instant messenger, can I move
y ou from "Contacts" to "Buddies"?

565
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:50,337
- No.
- Can I puty ou on my fave five?

566
00:42:50,414 --> 00:42:51,779
- No.
- My Space add?

567
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:53,339
Denied.

568
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:55,851
Butwe're friends now, right?

569
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,184
Sure, A-Plus. We're friends.

570
00:42:58,256 --> 00:43:00,850
And y ou're a girl, right?

571
00:43:00,925 --> 00:43:02,654
Duh.

572
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:06,322
So I can call y ou
my girlfriend, right?

573
00:43:06,864 --> 00:43:08,832
Ewww! Not!

574
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,959
Fine, be thatway.

575
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:17,031
- (man #1) There he goes! There he goes!
- (man #2) Get out of my way! No, I'm going first!

576
00:43:18,843 --> 00:43:20,105
You...

577
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:29,515
OK, it's finished.

578
00:43:35,993 --> 00:43:38,518
(man) He's over there!

579
00:43:44,302 --> 00:43:45,769
Beep beep!

580
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,871
- Copy that.
- (man) Come here, kid!

581
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:05,079
Come here!

582
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:07,488
(men shoutangrily)

583
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:11,518
(man) Owwwww!

584
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:17,193
Argh!

585
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:20,169
Jeez! With the
sneaking up on me, OK?

586
00:44:20,237 --> 00:44:24,606
- Mission accomplished. Where's Ox?
- Well, I don't know. He's alone wolf.

587
00:44:24,675 --> 00:44:26,734
- You're putting that bone back.
- Fine.

588
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:32,807
(man) All right, he's in the tunnel!
Give me a flashlight. Let's go! This way!

589
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:45,522
Whoa!

590
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,468
(man) Stay where y ou are!

591
00:44:51,535 --> 00:44:53,196
Fan out.

592
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:56,002
Do y ou Heely?

593
00:44:56,073 --> 00:44:59,804
(# "Anthem"by Zebrahead)

594
00:45:01,178 --> 00:45:03,544
- Shall we?
- Let's do.

595
00:45:05,816 --> 00:45:08,182
Fun time's over.

596
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:28,395
Go!

597
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:32,536
Hey, that's my girl!

598
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,510
Goty ou!

599
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:40,680
Goty ou! (whistles)

600
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:46,082
Vámonos!

601
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:52,852
- (Laura) You're not gonnalet him keep that?
- I'll put it backlater. Good job, Ox.

602
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,125
Where are the kids?

603
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:57,759
Where did they go? Which way?

604
00:45:58,803 --> 00:46:00,964
Bunch of idiots! Oh, man.

605
00:46:02,373 --> 00:46:06,469
Herfinancial situation is
dire and, as the bears' keeper,

606
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:09,809
she has ready access to
the panda house at any time.

607
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,508
The agency's skilled
forensics team has concluded

608
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:16,849
that the only fresh footprints at the
crime scene belong to Mrs. Ventura.

609
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:19,253
I object!

610
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:30,722
Excuse me. Who are y ou?

611
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:33,861
Ace Ventura Darrow
Hutz Junior, Esquire,

612
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:36,873
of the following
lawfirms - one minute -

613
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:39,273
Dewey, Fleeceum & Grab,
Wiley, Little & Weasel,

614
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:41,937
Shakem, Down & Hard,
Cheap, Ambulance & Chaser,

615
00:46:42,012 --> 00:46:45,277
Imontha, Take & Lovitt,
Ben, Dover & Grunt,

616
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:48,841
and the non-profit
Mater Innocentus.

617
00:46:48,919 --> 00:46:53,879
My mom is innocent. Your Honor,
I represent the defendant.

618
00:46:54,692 --> 00:46:56,853
Your Honor, this
is ridiculous.

619
00:46:56,927 --> 00:47:00,226
He's a 12-y ear-old behavioral
case and the defendant's son.

620
00:47:00,297 --> 00:47:03,391
This is a bail hearing.
Character is pertinent.

621
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:05,401
Continue, y oung man.

622
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:11,203
Ow, that must have hurt, and it's
only gonna getworse. Pay attention.

623
00:47:18,282 --> 00:47:22,082
- Thank y ou, paralegal Laura.
- You're very welcome.

624
00:47:30,728 --> 00:47:32,286
(Ace Jr. Fartss)

625
00:47:32,363 --> 00:47:36,925
- Come on, Your Honor!
- Pardon me, Your Honor. My bad.

626
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:50,643
- Thank y ou, pretty paralegal Laura.
- You're very welcome, Mr. Esquire.

627
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:52,705
Come on, boy s.

628
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:04,451
Drop it. (gruntss)
OK, I'm good, I'm good.

629
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:11,326
The only footprints thatAgent Hollander and
his personal CSI - Complete Stupid Idiots -

630
00:48:11,402 --> 00:48:13,461
found at the scene were...

631
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:19,134
(breathless) OK, alittle help. It's
getting really heavy, bailiffs. Please!

632
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,205
And let me remind y
ou, y ou're under oath!

633
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:25,214
- I'm not.
- I want the truth! You can't handle the truth!

634
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:29,685
Be seated, y ou maggot,
immediately, if not sooner!

635
00:48:30,688 --> 00:48:35,284
Anyw way, the only footprints that
Ranger Blockhead found in the habitat,

636
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,352
besides my mom's shoeprints,
were panda prints.

637
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:44,026
The average panda weighs 352Ibs,
with a body mass index of 21.34.

638
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:48,197
At overfive feet in length, the panda
has slightly offsetweight distribution.

639
00:48:48,272 --> 00:48:50,797
They use a thumb-like
sesamoid bone for stability,

640
00:48:50,874 --> 00:48:53,468
and would create a
5mm-deep footprint.

641
00:48:53,544 --> 00:48:57,071
But, as y ou can see, these
are 2.3mm-deep footprints,

642
00:48:57,147 --> 00:49:00,742
that I just created by
adding 75Ibs to my weight.

643
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:06,757
A man weighing 183Ibs would indeed
establish a print depth of 2.3mm.

644
00:49:06,824 --> 00:49:11,056
We are looking for a 183Ibs man,
not a... Mom, how much do y ou weigh?

645
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:13,596
- 110.
- You wanna be free or not?

646
00:49:13,664 --> 00:49:17,156
- 135.... 135Ibs woman.

647
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:20,601
If the footprints
don'tfit, y ou must acquit.

648
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:22,764
(applause)

649
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,308
- Order! Order!
- (Ace Jr.) Thank y ou, thank y ou!

650
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:28,174
That's Ventura with
a V, as in victory.

651
00:49:28,245 --> 00:49:30,577
I plead for
acquittal, Your Honor.

652
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:35,449
Game, set, match. Cut,
print, moving on, and scene.

653
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:41,782
Let me get this straight. You
trespassed on a federal crime scene.

654
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:44,327
Or y ou're just
making all this up.

655
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:50,893
Um... Well...

656
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:55,268
It's a hypothesis. A
theory, if y ou will.

657
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,872
Well, that's terrific, tiger. But, listen, right
now, the grown-ups have to send y our mommy to jail...

658
00:50:01,945 --> 00:50:06,905
unless someone else wants to put on a
Halloween costume and vandalize the courtroom?

659
00:50:06,984 --> 00:50:09,578
(laughter)

660
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:13,713
Order! I'm sorry, y oung man.

661
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:19,752
It's an interesting theory, but this case involves
an endangered species, international relations.

662
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,095
Bail is set at $500,000.

663
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:29,163
Melissa Ventura, y ou're remanded to
the custody of the state of Florida.

664
00:50:30,174 --> 00:50:33,541
Ace, where did y ou get
all that information?

665
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,204
- You promised y ou wouldn't...
- But Grandpa said...

666
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,444
- He carries around a dead dog, Ace.
- It's not dead, it's just sleeping.

667
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:44,112
I thought I could help y ou solve the
case by finding Ting Tang or something,

668
00:50:44,188 --> 00:50:46,383
but no one believes
me, not even y ou.

669
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:49,824
Of course I do. I just
don'twant to lose y ou.

670
00:50:49,893 --> 00:50:54,057
- Like y ou lost Dad?
- Yeah, like I lost Dad.

671
00:50:55,432 --> 00:50:59,766
I realize now that no matterwhat I
say, y ou're gonna be who y ou are.

672
00:50:59,837 --> 00:51:02,670
I wanty ou to know the
truth abouty our dad.

673
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:07,541
I just didn't talk about him
orwhat he did because I...

674
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:10,171
I didn'twanty ou to
follow in his footsteps.

675
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:12,238
What happened to him?

676
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:16,442
He was on a case.

677
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:21,355
Using an ultralight plane, he was leading
a flock of disabled Canadian snow geese

678
00:51:21,425 --> 00:51:25,486
back to theirwinter
breeding ground in Miami.

679
00:51:25,562 --> 00:51:28,395
They said that he
got disoriented,

680
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:33,836
and he vanished from radar
somewhere over the Bermuda Triangle.

681
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:35,565
Oh, Ace.

682
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:40,639
Time is up. Gotta
gety ou on the bus.

683
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:42,975
I've been saving
something for y ou.

684
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:47,407
Yourfather bought this.

685
00:51:47,484 --> 00:51:53,081
He wanted y ou to have it when y
ou were old enough, and nowy ou are.

686
00:51:53,157 --> 00:51:55,751
Look up in the attic.
You'll find it there.

687
00:51:55,826 --> 00:51:59,057
- No, Mom, I promise, I'll be normal.
- Be who y ou are, Ace!

688
00:51:59,129 --> 00:52:02,326
Hollanderwill find the pandanapper
and we'll be a family again.

689
00:52:02,399 --> 00:52:05,596
- I love y ou, Ace!
- I love y ou, Mom.

690
00:52:15,779 --> 00:52:18,270
Ace, I'm so sorry.

691
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:20,942
So what do we do now?

692
00:52:21,018 --> 00:52:24,010
Nothing. I'm
aloser. It's over.

693
00:52:24,788 --> 00:52:27,382
Sorry abouty our koi fish.

694
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:29,858
Come on, Ox.

695
00:52:29,927 --> 00:52:32,987
Hey, Laura, where
the heck is Bermuda?

696
00:52:33,063 --> 00:52:35,054
I have no idea.

697
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:53,782
That's notwhat I
think it is, is it?

698
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:55,751
I guess.

699
00:52:55,819 --> 00:52:57,980
Your mom gave that to y ou?

700
00:52:58,856 --> 00:53:01,347
Yeah, but it's not important.

701
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,951
What about the animals?

702
00:53:05,028 --> 00:53:07,861
Animals have never brought
me any thing but trouble.

703
00:53:07,931 --> 00:53:10,297
I gotta be like every
one else, Grandpa.

704
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:14,428
- You can't.
- Well, I will if it kills me.

705
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:18,669
You'll never be like every one else,
'cause y ou're one in a million.

706
00:53:18,742 --> 00:53:21,210
Justlike y our ancestors.

707
00:53:21,278 --> 00:53:23,269
Justlike y ourfather.

708
00:53:23,947 --> 00:53:26,279
Eaty our own food, Ox.

709
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:29,786
I've been try ing to gety
ou to figure this out,

710
00:53:29,853 --> 00:53:33,653
but I guess I'm just gonna
have to come out and say it.

711
00:53:33,724 --> 00:53:36,716
- Say what?
- The magic word.

712
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:43,061
Don'ty ou knowwhaty ou are?

713
00:53:44,735 --> 00:53:47,226
I'm a kid, right?

714
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:50,603
You're more than that.

715
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:53,234
You're a pet...

716
00:53:55,746 --> 00:53:57,407
detective.

717
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,020
- Like my dad?
- Yeah.

718
00:54:06,623 --> 00:54:09,820
- Whatwas he like?
- Justlike y ou.

719
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:15,860
And y ou know,

720
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:18,595
this thing y ou threw away,

721
00:54:19,836 --> 00:54:23,328
this is the key
to y ourfuture.

722
00:55:18,762 --> 00:55:20,889
All righty, then.

723
00:55:20,964 --> 00:55:24,058
(# "Ace Is In The
House"by Tone Loc)

724
00:55:57,934 --> 00:56:01,335
- Nice outfiit.
- Let's talk fashion.

725
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:06,069
Tara's wearing the latest in the "Spoiled and
Shallow" collection. Love the shoes. Hate y ou!

726
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:10,978
Ventura, our therapist said for us to order y
ou to stop inflicting emotional damage on us.

727
00:56:11,048 --> 00:56:14,984
Franken Berry called. Count Chocula wants
his wardrobe back. And the sun's out.

728
00:56:15,052 --> 00:56:18,783
Get back in y our caskets. Is
there a veterinarian in the house?

729
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:21,756
Because these are
some sick puppies.

730
00:56:21,825 --> 00:56:26,819
Hey, watch the hair!
Oxnard, I need y ou!

731
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:43,879
Time for another
motivational dunking, dork!

732
00:56:43,947 --> 00:56:47,041
- No, buty ou don't underst...
- (Ox barks)

733
00:56:49,352 --> 00:56:53,152
Jeez, next time y ou're late
like that, I'm buy ing a cat.

734
00:56:54,257 --> 00:56:56,248
(Ox barks)

735
00:56:57,861 --> 00:57:00,455
Tell y our dog to
back off, Ventura!

736
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:04,057
Are y ou crazy? I'm not going
near him! He looks rabid.

737
00:57:04,134 --> 00:57:06,728
And he can smell y ourfear.

738
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:08,168
(barks)

739
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:11,765
You are Spartan!

740
00:57:23,553 --> 00:57:28,047
- What about our alligator?
- I told y ou I'd find him, and I will.

741
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:32,289
But right now, I've
got biggerfish to fry.

742
00:57:32,362 --> 00:57:35,991
Oxnard! Allons-y, muchacho!

743
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:39,797
Oh, and sorry about that
whole buy ing a cat thing.

744
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:41,861
Ace?

745
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:44,502
Ventura...

746
00:57:44,574 --> 00:57:46,769
Junior.

747
00:57:46,843 --> 00:57:48,834
Pet Detective.

748
00:57:48,912 --> 00:57:51,312
Um... OK.

749
00:57:52,048 --> 00:57:56,075
- What's wrong?
- The question, y oung Laura, is what is right?

750
00:57:56,153 --> 00:57:59,213
The answer
- every thing.

751
00:57:59,289 --> 00:58:03,749
- So y ou feel like solving that case?
- I thoughty ou gave up.

752
00:58:03,827 --> 00:58:06,523
Even Tiger Woods shanks
one from time to time.

753
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:08,723
But the past is past.

754
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,895
- Now, A-Plus. - Wow!
This table is great.

755
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:17,128
I looked through Sickinger's hard
drive. He's a biological researcher

756
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:22,201
specializing in non-telegenic
endangered organisms.

757
00:58:22,279 --> 00:58:26,215
- In English, Mr. Spock.
- He advocates for ugly animals.

758
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:32,984
He planned a demonstration forlike-minded
activists at a publicity stop for a famous feline.

759
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:38,325
OK, I didn't understand
a word y ou just said,

760
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:40,625
exceptfor "ugly
animals" and "Sickinger. "

761
00:58:40,697 --> 00:58:43,996
He's organizing a protest at
Tabby the Tabby's autograph session

762
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:48,163
at the Animal Actors Studio
at Universal, Orlando.

763
00:58:48,238 --> 00:58:50,502
Itlooks like we're
going on a field trip.

764
00:58:50,574 --> 00:58:52,132
L'chaim!

765
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:57,511
I'll take a few of these
for the road. 2% next time.

766
00:58:57,581 --> 00:59:00,914
- Field trip? Wait, do I need a permission slip?
- No, y ou don't!

767
00:59:00,984 --> 00:59:05,182
Have a meow-tastic
day. Thanks for coming.

768
00:59:05,255 --> 00:59:07,985
Tabby say s, "Have
a meow-tastic day. "

769
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:13,193
Thanks for coming. Tabby say
s, "Have a meow-tastic day!"

770
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:16,922
Thanks for coming. Tabby say
s, "Have a meow-tastic day!"

771
00:59:17,167 --> 00:59:20,864
Thanks for coming. Tabby say
s, "Have a meow-tastic day!"

772
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:23,167
There's Sickinger!

773
00:59:27,878 --> 00:59:32,076
No justice, no peace! Equal
treatmentfor ugly species!

774
00:59:32,315 --> 00:59:36,046
No justice, no peace! Equal
treatmentfor ugly species!

775
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:38,178
Take him down! He's
an ecoterrorist!

776
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:42,316
Cease and desist immediately,
or I'll be forced to use this!

777
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:45,156
Don't even think about
moving! Slow down! Just stop!

778
00:59:45,228 --> 00:59:47,321
(speakerblares)

779
00:59:47,397 --> 00:59:49,627
- Don't Tase me, bro!
- Get him!

780
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:53,191
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no...

781
00:59:58,909 --> 01:00:02,345
- We shall not be silenced!
- Be quiet!

782
01:00:02,412 --> 01:00:05,347
Ugly animals of
the world, unite!

783
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:08,782
- You have nothing to lose...
- This guy is crazy.

784
01:00:08,852 --> 01:00:11,047
...buty ourleashes!

785
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:13,453
- We shall not be silenced!
- (Taserbuzzes)

786
01:00:13,523 --> 01:00:15,354
- Ow!
- (woman screams)

787
01:00:15,425 --> 01:00:17,893
Tabby is gone!

788
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:20,122
Find Tabby! Tabby's gone!

789
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:22,823
Yikes! Tabby's been nabbied.

790
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:25,333
- Tabby!
- This is bigger than I thought.

791
01:00:25,402 --> 01:00:29,133
Sickinger must be running some sort
of criminal animal-napping netwwork.

792
01:00:29,205 --> 01:00:32,003
Oh, the humanity! Tabby!

793
01:00:32,075 --> 01:00:36,375
I knowy ou don'twant to, Ace,
buty ou better talk to Hollander.

794
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:38,971
Now he'll listen to y ou.

795
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:41,984
- You're notlistening!
- I'm sorry, what?

796
01:00:42,052 --> 01:00:47,718
Dr. Sickinger
- we saw him creating a distraction at the Animal Actors stadium when Tabby vanished!

797
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:50,885
This is a major criminal
netwwork. We have evidence.

798
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:53,020
- Tabby the Tabby.
- Catnapped.

799
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:55,360
- Ting Tang.
- You knowwhat happened to him.

800
01:00:55,432 --> 01:00:57,832
- Princess.
- Championship West Highland terrier.

801
01:00:57,901 --> 01:01:01,860
Her Majesty was stolen from a meaningless
international dog showlastweek!

802
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:05,271
- Freedom the Hawk.
- Mascotfor Stars and Stripes Burger Company.

803
01:01:05,342 --> 01:01:08,903
His freedom was taken when he was stolen
from the Jacksonville veterinarian!

804
01:01:08,979 --> 01:01:11,743
They even took Snuggles,
the fabric softening bear.

805
01:01:11,815 --> 01:01:13,942
- They took Snuggles?
- Yes!

806
01:01:14,017 --> 01:01:15,609
And?

807
01:01:15,685 --> 01:01:20,247
Sickinger's organization
is stealing famous animals!

808
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:23,554
Jeez! You're welcome for solving
the case, doing y our job!

809
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:26,686
Need me to wipe y our
buttfor y ou? I just did!

810
01:01:27,464 --> 01:01:30,194
So when can I get my mom back?

811
01:01:30,934 --> 01:01:33,129
Ten, 20 y ears, I'd say.

812
01:01:33,203 --> 01:01:34,795
What?!

813
01:01:34,871 --> 01:01:39,968
You see, doorstop, a major investigation
like this takes on alife all of its own.

814
01:01:40,043 --> 01:01:44,742
I think y our mom's guilty, and I
spent all morning on CNN say ing she is.

815
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:48,079
Her case is putting this agency on
the map. Look atwhat they gave us.

816
01:01:48,151 --> 01:01:51,314
And that's just the
beginning. Get this.

817
01:01:51,388 --> 01:01:54,653
CSl: Fish and Wildlife.

818
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:57,619
Guess who's gonna play me?

819
01:01:57,694 --> 01:01:59,355
Gumby.

820
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:03,456
I didn'twant it to have to come
to this, Russell, but now it's on.

821
01:02:04,534 --> 01:02:06,525
Ha!

822
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,364
Ha!

823
01:02:08,438 --> 01:02:10,906
- Out.
- With the pushing!

824
01:02:10,974 --> 01:02:14,375
I am gonna get Sickinger, solve
this case, prove my mom's innocent,

825
01:02:14,444 --> 01:02:17,277
and show the world
what an idioty ou are!

826
01:02:17,347 --> 01:02:19,713
Nice hair.

827
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:22,308
(laughing)

828
01:02:25,655 --> 01:02:31,150
This used to be the most pristine
Ty rannosaurus skeleton on Earth,

829
01:02:31,227 --> 01:02:35,095
formerly valued
at $100 million.

830
01:02:35,165 --> 01:02:37,531
(Ace Jr.) How much
is itworth now?

831
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,091
(sighs) Substantially less.

832
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:43,799
Please do not touch it.

833
01:02:44,808 --> 01:02:48,403
Let's move very carefully
to the gift shop.

834
01:02:54,617 --> 01:02:57,677
I don't think itlooks that
bad. Here, y ou put it back.

835
01:02:57,754 --> 01:02:59,745
You put it back.

836
01:03:30,019 --> 01:03:33,750
- Yes?
- Dr. Sickinger, I presume?

837
01:03:34,724 --> 01:03:36,885
Wait!

838
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:40,052
Who are y ou?

839
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:43,793
Ace Ventura Jr. Pet Detective.

840
01:03:44,734 --> 01:03:48,568
- You're kidding me, right?
- Do I looklike I'm kidding?

841
01:03:51,774 --> 01:03:56,370
I get it! Young supporters
of the cause, y es!

842
01:03:56,446 --> 01:04:01,110
Oh, it's brilliant! Yes, y es. You're
never too y oung for political mobilization.

843
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,448
We don'twant to
join y our movement.

844
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,115
Look, buddy, my mom's
in jail because of y ou,

845
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:11,092
so tell us where the panda is so
we can get him back to the zoo.

846
01:04:12,095 --> 01:04:15,189
If I were going to steal
an animal from the zoo,

847
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:18,760
the panda is the
last one I'd take.

848
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:22,904
I don't think y ou understand.

849
01:04:22,972 --> 01:04:24,997
(plucks guitarstring)

850
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:28,669
- This is the Madagascan
Ay e-ay e. - Ugh!

851
01:04:29,712 --> 01:04:33,671
- The Proboscis Monkey.
- Big nose.

852
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,342
Ugh!

853
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:37,943
The Chinese paddlefish.

854
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:43,853
The Marabou Stork.

855
01:04:45,595 --> 01:04:48,996
All of them endangered, y et
no one's ever heard of them.

856
01:04:49,065 --> 01:04:51,898
- You knowwhy?
- No.

857
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,994
They're hideous.

858
01:04:56,072 --> 01:04:58,336
Ugly.

859
01:04:58,408 --> 01:05:01,172
- Butt-ugly, actually.
- You got it there.

860
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:02,802
(Sickinger) Whoops!

861
01:05:02,879 --> 01:05:05,347
Sorry, that one's
from vacation.

862
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:07,679
Ace, shoot me now.

863
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,741
Lights, lights.

864
01:05:11,888 --> 01:05:15,380
And this has what
to do with the panda?

865
01:05:16,226 --> 01:05:18,217
Well, every thing!

866
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:21,889
We put all of these
cute creatures in zoos,

867
01:05:21,965 --> 01:05:27,130
and then we spend insane
amounts of money to protect them.

868
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:29,535
And forwhat?

869
01:05:29,606 --> 01:05:30,903
(retches)

870
01:05:30,974 --> 01:05:37,777
I started the Pandafanatic website
to get attention for my cause.

871
01:05:38,348 --> 01:05:40,339
That's all.

872
01:05:41,618 --> 01:05:44,917
I didn't kidnap Ting Tang,

873
01:05:44,988 --> 01:05:47,980
or any of those other animals.

874
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:51,117
All species of animals,
including the ugly ones,

875
01:05:51,194 --> 01:05:56,461
should be treated with the same
respect as the cute ones, like pandas.

876
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,633
I think I just busted
this case wide open.

877
01:06:02,472 --> 01:06:05,373
Amigos, vámonos!

878
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:10,537
I have a car.

879
01:06:12,115 --> 01:06:14,447
Ace! So what's going on?

880
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:17,077
Well, here's the
plot up until now.

881
01:06:17,153 --> 01:06:20,020
Our perpetrator is
stealing famous animals.

882
01:06:20,089 --> 01:06:22,421
And there's none more
famous than Calypso.

883
01:06:22,492 --> 01:06:26,189
He play ed the hero unicorn in the epic
trilogy that they shot in NewZealand.

884
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:29,026
His owners are doing a benefit
magic performance today,

885
01:06:29,098 --> 01:06:32,226
and I got a feeling our thief
is gonna try and steal him there.

886
01:06:32,302 --> 01:06:34,293
Punch it.

887
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,532
Here's the plan. Doc,
y ou watch the exits.

888
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:42,601
Ox.

889
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,678
You watch Doc. Let's go.

890
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,040
Hi.

891
01:06:49,118 --> 01:06:54,055
(Ace Jr.) OK, when we get past
this, A-Plus, Laura, split up.

892
01:06:54,123 --> 01:06:56,114
Whoeverfinds Calypso, call in.

893
01:06:56,192 --> 01:07:00,253
We'll stake out the perpetrators and
waitfor them to reveal themselves.

894
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:07,592
I've been looking
around here all day.

895
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:11,037
- I can'tfind Calypso.
- He's right over there.

896
01:07:11,107 --> 01:07:13,337
(man) For my next illusion...

897
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:15,570
- Magic show.... I
need a volunteer.

898
01:07:15,645 --> 01:07:17,408
(crowd shoutss)

899
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,816
- (man) Avolunteer? Who wants to be in the show?
- (Ace Jr.) Me! Here! Pick me!

900
01:07:22,885 --> 01:07:25,046
You. How abouty ou?

901
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:27,919
- No, no, me! Hey, wannabe magic man.
- Any one else?

902
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:31,426
- Me!
- Sure, son. OK, go inspect the box.

903
01:07:31,494 --> 01:07:35,453
You'll see that there are no
mirrors. There are no strings.

904
01:07:35,531 --> 01:07:37,522
There are no trap doors.

905
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,330
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

906
01:07:40,403 --> 01:07:43,702
Ace Irwin Ventura
Jr. Aty our service.

907
01:07:43,773 --> 01:07:48,506
- Don'tworry, y ou'll be OK.
- (man) This is what I do.

908
01:07:48,578 --> 01:07:51,274
- Are there any back doors?
- There are no back doors.

909
01:07:51,347 --> 01:07:54,282
- Are there any mirrors?
- No mirrors!

910
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:57,485
- All right, go on.
- Stranger danger.

911
01:07:57,553 --> 01:07:59,783
- Give him a big hand.
- (applause)

912
01:07:59,856 --> 01:08:04,293
Raise the box. You won't
believe whaty ou're about to see.

913
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,521
Every one, remain calm.

914
01:08:07,663 --> 01:08:10,393
One, twwo, three!

915
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:16,061
(crowd cheers)

916
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:24,809
And now... Close the box.

917
01:08:24,881 --> 01:08:29,341
Raise the box, gentlemen, raise the box. I'm
a professional, so nobody try this at home.

918
01:08:29,419 --> 01:08:32,718
And now... Calypso!

919
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:42,926
What the...?!

920
01:08:43,933 --> 01:08:47,767
- What happened?
- (man #2) Where's my horse?

921
01:08:47,837 --> 01:08:50,635
Where's Calypso? That horse
gets six million a picture.

922
01:08:50,706 --> 01:08:52,901
- Where's Calypso?
- Houdini, I want him back.

923
01:08:52,975 --> 01:08:56,240
That kid right there. The
volunteer. He must know something.

924
01:08:56,312 --> 01:08:59,611
What, me? No. Where would I be
keeping a horse that big? In my pocket?

925
01:08:59,682 --> 01:09:03,209
- Where's Calypso?
- Why don'ty ou check y our mother's house?

926
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:05,584
- He's justjoking.
- Come on!

927
01:09:05,655 --> 01:09:07,850
- Just get him!
- Hey, kid!

928
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:11,183
- Stop!
- (Ace Jr.) Slow down, Simba!

929
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:14,457
- (Laura) Calypso's really gone?
- (Ace Jr.) My plan worked!

930
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:17,363
- (A-Plus) What plan? - I fed
him one of y our homing devices.

931
01:09:17,433 --> 01:09:22,769
Strawberry gummy, he loved it. Now he's gonna
lead us to whoever's behind all this treachery.

932
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:25,672
- Get him!
- Stop!

933
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:28,801
Sickinger, start the car!
I think they have rabies!

934
01:09:30,146 --> 01:09:33,138
Here. Dog. Car, car!

935
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:39,345
- Seatbelts!
- Seatbelts? What, are y ou kidding me? Let's go!

936
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:42,623
Where's my horse?!

937
01:09:45,228 --> 01:09:47,560
They're getting off the
highway at Palm Grove.

938
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:52,294
That's where all the rich kids from
our school live, butwhere exactly?

939
01:09:52,368 --> 01:09:55,804
- My invitation!
- (mocking) My invitation.

940
01:09:57,573 --> 01:10:00,838
You're invited to my
birthday partyy this Saturday,

941
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:03,845
at3421 Tropicana Avenue.

942
01:10:05,381 --> 01:10:08,714
OK, party people. Suit up!

943
01:10:09,452 --> 01:10:11,511
Party? I haven't
partied since '99.

944
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:13,487
Ox, vámonos!

945
01:10:18,194 --> 01:10:23,689
(A-Plus) No, up there. No, wait!
Wait, stop, stop! Stop right here!

946
01:10:23,766 --> 01:10:28,100
- No, stop here! Stop!
- I'm stopping, backseat driver!

947
01:10:35,611 --> 01:10:37,977
All right, Laura and
I are going inside.

948
01:10:38,047 --> 01:10:42,177
If we're not back by
three o'clock, implement...

949
01:10:44,754 --> 01:10:46,585
plan B.

950
01:10:46,656 --> 01:10:48,851
Sy nchronize watches.

951
01:10:48,925 --> 01:10:49,584
Let's go.

952
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:56,522
A red carpet? What is this, an awards show?
Where's Joan Rivers when y ou need her?

953
01:10:56,599 --> 01:11:00,558
Hey, y ou, make sure no weirdos get in
here. Talk aboutfilthy stinking rich.

954
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:03,002
Do y ou knowwhere the
back of the line is?

955
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:06,041
How's the wife and kids?
What's the word I'm looking for?

956
01:11:06,108 --> 01:11:09,737
- It's very regal.
- Exactly. Egomaniacal.

957
01:11:09,812 --> 01:11:11,677
- Thank y ou.
- Holy Shaq!

958
01:11:11,747 --> 01:11:15,205
How many puberties
have y ou gone through?!

959
01:11:15,284 --> 01:11:17,343
- All right.
- Thank y ou.

960
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,911
Wear the wristband
at all times.

961
01:11:20,823 --> 01:11:23,553
Whoa. Invite only, kid.

962
01:11:23,626 --> 01:11:27,084
- He's my date.
- What, did y ou lose a bet?

963
01:11:27,163 --> 01:11:29,654
Ha ha! You're
killing me, Smalls.

964
01:11:29,732 --> 01:11:33,930
How abouty ou pick on somebody
y our own size? Like Sasquatch.

965
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:36,665
Now band me.

966
01:11:36,739 --> 01:11:39,765
- Gray areas are offlimits.
- Yeah, y eah, y eah.

967
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:41,833
(machine bleeps)

968
01:11:42,778 --> 01:11:45,576
- Electronic device.
- Here.

969
01:11:45,648 --> 01:11:51,382
Don't touchy the hair! I haven't been treated this badly
since I got sick in a country with socialized medicine.

970
01:12:02,331 --> 01:12:07,735
- 10,000 shares of Exxon stock! Awesome!
- (disappointed) I got a Rolex.

971
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:12,972
- Didn'ty ou bring him a gift?
- I got him the one thing he doesn't have.

972
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:15,101
- What?
- Nothing.

973
01:12:15,678 --> 01:12:17,737
Holy real estate!

974
01:12:22,118 --> 01:12:24,177
This place probably
has its own zip code.

975
01:12:24,253 --> 01:12:26,687
I bety ou we need an
exitvisa to get out of here.

976
01:12:26,756 --> 01:12:29,554
Best party ever! Bananas!

977
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:34,423
Get out of the way. Make
room for Mr. Pennington.

978
01:12:34,497 --> 01:12:36,988
Ooh, it's Mr. Big
Scary Billionaire Man.

979
01:12:39,435 --> 01:12:43,394
"Pirates of the Caribbean" is
the other side of town, sport.

980
01:12:43,472 --> 01:12:47,568
- Don't touch me.
- Stay back, people. Thank y ou. Out of the way.

981
01:12:47,643 --> 01:12:49,634
He's mean.

982
01:12:50,346 --> 01:12:53,315
Young ladies and gentlemen,

983
01:12:53,382 --> 01:12:56,545
may I directy our
attention to the sky!

984
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:08,026
The Pennington Estate now proudly presents
the momentwe've all been waiting for.

985
01:13:08,097 --> 01:13:11,726
Puty our hands together
and welcome my son,

986
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:14,497
Pennington, Jr.!

987
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:17,164
(applause)

988
01:13:17,239 --> 01:13:19,673
(girls scream)

989
01:13:21,744 --> 01:13:23,974
- Wow!
- Big deal.

990
01:13:24,847 --> 01:13:30,945
(Pennington Jr.) Hi, how are y ou?
Great to see y ou. Thanks for coming.

991
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,114
- How are we gonna get inside?
- Oh, I know.

992
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:37,626
Let's crash into the door in our
million-dollar personal helicopter.

993
01:13:37,693 --> 01:13:40,457
- Ace.
- I'm working on it.

994
01:13:41,097 --> 01:13:43,725
Hey, Laura, glad
y ou could make it.

995
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:46,324
Hi, how are y ou?

996
01:13:47,269 --> 01:13:52,138
Well, I asked my fatherfor the best
party ever, and, as y ou can see,

997
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:56,304
what a Pennington
wants, a Pennington gets.

998
01:13:56,378 --> 01:14:00,007
- So please do not embarrass y ourselves...
- I got it. Let's go.

999
01:14:00,082 --> 01:14:04,519
...by breaking any of
the following rules. Dad?

1000
01:14:05,421 --> 01:14:09,653
Gifts in the party bags
are not tax deductible.

1001
01:14:09,725 --> 01:14:12,853
Do not take any photos.

1002
01:14:13,362 --> 01:14:15,956
Any one found to be outside
of the designated areas

1003
01:14:16,031 --> 01:14:19,933
will be prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law.

1004
01:14:20,703 --> 01:14:23,934
- Have fun, kids!
- (applause)

1005
01:14:24,473 --> 01:14:30,070
We'll cut the cake in 45 minutes.
Until then, happy birthday to me!

1006
01:14:37,486 --> 01:14:40,455
- Ace!
- I'm thinking.

1007
01:14:41,457 --> 01:14:43,448
- Down here.
- Yeah.

1008
01:14:46,262 --> 01:14:48,560
Ow! Watch the hair!

1009
01:15:08,651 --> 01:15:11,119
Will y ou stop
spinning? I'm dizzy!

1010
01:15:11,187 --> 01:15:14,418
Let's go. The tunnel oflove.

1011
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:17,653
- In y our dreams, Ace.
- How did y ou know about that?

1012
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:19,751
Oxnard. Big mouth!

1013
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:32,233
(Ace Jr.) Follow me.

1014
01:15:44,453 --> 01:15:46,444
Who's the man?

1015
01:15:52,094 --> 01:15:54,358
They could have seen y ou!

1016
01:16:06,342 --> 01:16:09,675
- Why do y ou keep doing that?
- That's just how I roll, baby.

1017
01:16:09,745 --> 01:16:11,736
(sniffs)

1018
01:16:16,352 --> 01:16:22,120
If Scooby-Doo has taught me any thing, it's that
one of these books will activate a secret door.

1019
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:24,182
(continues sniffing)

1020
01:16:28,397 --> 01:16:35,064
Earthy, sweet, a strong bouquet of
bamboo with a slight infusion of crocus.

1021
01:16:35,137 --> 01:16:37,605
Just a touch of wild
grass and... butt!

1022
01:16:40,643 --> 01:16:42,634
I smell panda poop.

1023
01:16:43,779 --> 01:16:45,770
Excellenty ear.

1024
01:17:00,529 --> 01:17:03,794
- How did y ou know that?
- I'm a meddling kid.

1025
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:16,300
Dookie marks the
spot. Must be Poo-mas.

1026
01:17:16,378 --> 01:17:18,778
Or Jimmy Poo.

1027
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:21,941
The Penningtons think they're
smart, but they're poo-pid.

1028
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:26,113
We've caught them brown-footed.
They really stepped in it.

1029
01:17:26,188 --> 01:17:28,679
OK, Ace, enough of this crap.

1030
01:17:30,392 --> 01:17:33,225
You said "crap. " You
did. OK, fine, fine.

1031
01:17:36,832 --> 01:17:40,063
(man) National Bureau of Fish
and Wildlife, how can I directyou?

1032
01:17:40,135 --> 01:17:43,468
Yes, I have an anony mous
tip forAgent Hollander.

1033
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:46,940
Is he currently on... doodie?

1034
01:17:47,142 --> 01:17:48,973
(beeping)

1035
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:51,842
- Gum! I need a piece of gum.
- Here.

1036
01:18:05,694 --> 01:18:08,754
We received an anony mous tip
instructing us to come here.

1037
01:18:08,831 --> 01:18:11,026
From whom?

1038
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,931
Anony mous.

1039
01:18:13,002 --> 01:18:17,530
The tip said that the case of the
missing panda cub has been solved!

1040
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:22,736
You're the one who called in the tip? That's
it, short stack. Nowy ou're in big trouble.

1041
01:18:22,811 --> 01:18:28,374
No. He's in big trouble! We
found these shoes in his closet!

1042
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:33,080
It proves that my mom
didn't steal the panda.

1043
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:37,350
I think I understand.

1044
01:18:37,426 --> 01:18:42,363
This cartoon has taken advantage
of my son's hospitality.

1045
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:45,264
He's found some cheap
costume store haberdashery,

1046
01:18:45,334 --> 01:18:48,963
snuck it in as a birthday
gift, and planted it in my home.

1047
01:18:49,038 --> 01:18:55,102
And now he expects y ou to believe that I used
these ridiculous things in the commission of a crime?

1048
01:18:55,177 --> 01:18:59,841
Yes! Can y ou believe this
guy?! I mean, he's pathetic!

1049
01:18:59,915 --> 01:19:03,009
I'm glad I'm not in his
shoes! No pun intended.

1050
01:19:03,085 --> 01:19:06,521
He's been try ing to save his mom
with all sorts of crazy theories.

1051
01:19:06,588 --> 01:19:11,321
Get rid of these. He came by the NBFW
command center just the other day.

1052
01:19:11,393 --> 01:19:13,793
- National Bureau of Fish and Wildlife?
- Yeah.

1053
01:19:13,862 --> 01:19:18,356
I play golf with y our director. Join us for
dinner next time he's in Florida, Agent...?

1054
01:19:18,434 --> 01:19:20,732
Russell Hollander.
Thatwould be great.

1055
01:19:20,803 --> 01:19:23,237
How's the panda investigation
coming? I read...

1056
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:26,741
Hey, Hometown! You're not
here to be interviewed!

1057
01:19:26,809 --> 01:19:29,801
Arrest this guy,
and let my mom out!

1058
01:19:29,878 --> 01:19:32,938
Would y ou excuse me for
one second, Mr. Pennington?

1059
01:19:33,015 --> 01:19:35,347
Call me Pennington.

1060
01:19:36,151 --> 01:19:41,179
Don'tworry, Ventura. I'm gonna make an arrest. Two
of them, in fact. Because y ou're out of control!

1061
01:19:41,256 --> 01:19:45,522
You wanna see out of control?
Let's go, right now! Ha!

1062
01:19:45,594 --> 01:19:48,722
Ha! I win, bedhead.
Take these twwo in!

1063
01:19:48,797 --> 01:19:51,129
Ex-squeeze me?

1064
01:19:51,934 --> 01:19:56,871
I'll make sure y ou're locked up until the panda
case is completed. We don't need more distractions.

1065
01:19:56,939 --> 01:19:58,804
(beeping)

1066
01:19:58,874 --> 01:20:00,774
Three o'clock!

1067
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:03,676
- What the hell is that?
- Plan B.

1068
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:07,372
- Sorry! Sorry!
- (panda noises play on stereo)

1069
01:20:07,449 --> 01:20:10,475
- Ah, panda song.
- Here we go.

1070
01:20:11,053 --> 01:20:12,782
Uh-oh. Hello!

1071
01:20:12,855 --> 01:20:16,484
The sweet sound of a mother
panda calling her y oung.

1072
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:19,253
Oops! We're out of power!

1073
01:20:19,328 --> 01:20:22,786
- The house is clean!
- (panda noises continue)

1074
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:25,299
- Check around back!
- OK.

1075
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:30,365
They're small. Why
did y ou let them go?

1076
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:35,069
Turn it up! Go! Ting Tang
will hear his mom calling him!

1077
01:20:37,613 --> 01:20:41,105
- Let's go!
- Get the guy with the boom box!

1078
01:20:46,688 --> 01:20:49,316
(Ace Jr.) Over there,
point it over there!

1079
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:07,967
Congratulations. You
found my horse stalls.

1080
01:21:08,043 --> 01:21:12,412
- Sir, I apologize for the misunderstanding.
- Get him off my property!

1081
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:15,245
Silence! They're all here.

1082
01:21:15,317 --> 01:21:18,081
Come on, half pint, I'm
getting tired of this.

1083
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:20,280
Ha!

1084
01:21:23,492 --> 01:21:26,256
Don't go near those doors!

1085
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:33,030
(Ace Jr.) Princess! Tabby!

1086
01:21:38,006 --> 01:21:39,871
Otter! Piggy!

1087
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:48,511
Tortoise! Freedom
the Hawk! Be free!

1088
01:21:48,584 --> 01:21:50,745
Possum!

1089
01:22:06,935 --> 01:22:09,699
Ting Tang, I found
y ou! Touchdown!

1090
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:13,531
Go to the hay stack!
I'll be right back!

1091
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:16,601
Oh, no, y ou don't.

1092
01:22:23,085 --> 01:22:25,952
Come to me, my jungle friends!

1093
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:46,732
(yells)

1094
01:22:50,178 --> 01:22:52,646
Vámonos, amigos.

1095
01:22:55,117 --> 01:22:58,245
You had every thing,
sir. Why did y ou do this?

1096
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:02,820
I decided to start
an animal collection.

1097
01:23:03,392 --> 01:23:05,952
I wanted only the
mostfamous pieces.

1098
01:23:06,028 --> 01:23:08,553
Smooth ride for stolen
property, Pennington.

1099
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:11,827
And what a Pennington wants,

1100
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:14,232
a Pennington gets.

1101
01:23:14,569 --> 01:23:18,471
Mr. Pennington, Sr.,
sir, y ou're under arrest.

1102
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:21,065
(various animal noises)

1103
01:23:23,745 --> 01:23:26,612
(imitates dice rolling) Whack!

1104
01:23:27,282 --> 01:23:29,216
Yahtzee!

1105
01:23:29,284 --> 01:23:31,616
What's that on y our tie?

1106
01:23:33,121 --> 01:23:35,419
I win.

1107
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:38,618
- Exit stage left.
- Come on.

1108
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:44,090
He's going to jail,
he's going to jail!

1109
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:47,465
Ace, y ou're a really
great pet detective.

1110
01:23:48,937 --> 01:23:51,565
What can I say?

1111
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,870
Like father, like son.

1112
01:23:55,644 --> 01:23:57,942
I'm good, I'm good. Let's go.

1113
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:01,648
So when are y ou
gonna find my koi fish?

1114
01:24:01,717 --> 01:24:06,279
I just solved a huge
case! I'm working on it.

1115
01:24:14,763 --> 01:24:17,596
Nothing to see here. Just
one of y ourfellow classmates

1116
01:24:17,666 --> 01:24:21,329
taking down a powerful billionaire
for stealing celebrity animals.

1117
01:24:21,403 --> 01:24:25,169
Hey, I knowwhere y ou're going, and
my future license plate is going to be

1118
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,538
"ACE JR."

1119
01:24:32,347 --> 01:24:35,009
Where's he going?

1120
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:37,244
Like father, like son.

1121
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:47,487
Like father,
like son! Come on!

1122
01:24:48,263 --> 01:24:51,391
You guy s wanty our
pets or not? Come on!

1123
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:12,209
(girl) Mr. Chompers!
You stole our pets?

1124
01:25:12,287 --> 01:25:15,586
I'm the pet detective
here. He stole y our pets.

1125
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:17,852
He wants to be
justlike his dad.

1126
01:25:18,093 --> 01:25:20,084
He wants to be
justlike his dad.

1127
01:25:20,162 --> 01:25:22,596
Cruel, shallow, and selfish.

1128
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:25,428
You forgotfilthy
rich and egomaniacal.

1129
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,832
We're Penningtons. We
can have whatwe want!

1130
01:25:27,903 --> 01:25:31,202
Oh, y ou're quite a pair. But
this time an Ace trumps a pair!

1131
01:25:31,273 --> 01:25:32,570
(laughs)

1132
01:25:32,641 --> 01:25:34,871
You did notjust
make thatlame joke.

1133
01:25:34,943 --> 01:25:41,075
Oh, I did, sir! And y ou and y our dad are
going to look great in matching orange jumpsuits.

1134
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:43,617
You think y ou're
a good detective?

1135
01:25:43,685 --> 01:25:46,586
- Solve this.
- (alligatorgrowls)

1136
01:25:50,525 --> 01:25:53,050
The fish...

1137
01:25:53,128 --> 01:25:55,619
is about to disappear.

1138
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,628
- Greeny!
- No!

1139
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:04,536
Come on, I need help!

1140
01:26:04,606 --> 01:26:06,767
Open his mouth, I'm going in.

1141
01:26:06,842 --> 01:26:09,606
- (Sickinger) No!
- Five of y ou are going on a mission.

1142
01:26:09,678 --> 01:26:13,273
Couple of y ou probably
aren't coming back.

1143
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:17,516
Ace, be careful!

1144
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:21,721
What the...? Mazel tov.

1145
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:24,623
(girl) Easy, Mr. Chompers.

1146
01:26:24,693 --> 01:26:27,253
That's where my
hairdry erwent.

1147
01:26:29,664 --> 01:26:33,430
His mouth is closing!
People, his mouth is closing!

1148
01:26:33,502 --> 01:26:35,629
I think I got him! I got him!

1149
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:38,129
(Sickinger) Careful!

1150
01:26:38,206 --> 01:26:42,506
Ewww! I think I just squeezed
his liver! That's disgusting!

1151
01:26:45,847 --> 01:26:47,838
Greeny!

1152
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:57,558
No!

1153
01:27:10,972 --> 01:27:13,338
Way to go, Sparky!

1154
01:27:14,175 --> 01:27:16,336
Grandpa, what are
y ou doing here?
