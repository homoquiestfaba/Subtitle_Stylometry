What is this,

353
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,304
Yeah, what if he isn't
threatening us,

354
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,740
he was trying to warn us?

355
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,675
You've been warned.

356

Oh, my God.
You always think the worst.

363
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:35,088

So, where is Steven?

533
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:38,706
Natalie didn't tell you?

534
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:40,608
Not yet.

535
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:43,310
Steven can't actually see you.

536
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:44,945
[scoffs] Excuse me?

537
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:46,947
My husband is in need of care

538
00:25:46,981 --> 00:25:49,183
and he's only able to interact
in person with those

539
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:50,751
who have taken the vaccine.

540
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:52,319
Our vaccine.

541
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:53,988

Of course, sir.

We are massive fans.

548
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:05,666

- We are?

- Amazing.
- Really?

What my genius husband
is trying to say,

564
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:36,230
is that we think
you can help us promote

565
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,666
The Rektor Foundation's
new super vaccine

566
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:40,668
that can turn millions
of possible deaths

567
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:43,671
into something even more amazing
than just being alive.

568
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:45,706
Being totally immune
to everything.

569
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:48,375
And for your promotion
to your combined user base

571
00:26:50,411 --> 00:26:53,848
we're gonna pay you to the tune

Of course.

588
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,818
How is it possible you can find
a problem with that?

She's got a point, sis.

590
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:33,721
But why us?

591
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:36,724
Uh, hello.
She literally just told us.

592
00:27:36,757 --> 00:27:39,093
No way, they're...
They're hiding something, okay.

593
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:41,729
That's too much money.
It's too top secret.

594
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:42,696

that guy gave me today...

No, no,

about the creepy guy

00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:45,966
who threatened to kill us?

598
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,001
- Gross.
- Okay.

599
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:48,469
Yes, the amount they're offering

600
00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:50,004
- is weirdly high.
- I mean, we would have do...

601
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:51,405
We would have done this
for what?

602
00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:52,473
Half a mil?

603
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:53,908
And also, where's David?

604
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:55,342
- He should be here, right?
- Yes.

00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:56,710
Okay, seriously, Jack.

606
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:57,878
I can't with her.

607
00:27:57,912 --> 00:27:59,280
You always side
with your sister.

608
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:00,314
What?

609
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,350
Look, she is not you're only
dependent anymore.

Jack, look,
just let her go, okay.

615

Let her go.
It's not about her.

- Okay.

00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:43,791
Now, before you sign,
there's just one more thing.

625
00:28:43,824 --> 00:28:46,393
Times are changing
in our media empire.

626
00:28:46,427 --> 00:28:49,330
And because of Steven's health
and none of our heirs

627
00:28:49,363 --> 00:28:51,198
willing to take the reins,

628
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:53,367
we've been on the hunt
for new partners.

00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,436
Not just to carry on the legacy
of our company,

00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:58,772
but to reinvent it
for today's audience.

634
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:09,984
Uh, I'm sorry.

635
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:12,019
Are you talking
about giving us your...

636
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:13,954
<i>My company?</i>

637
00:29:13,988 --> 00:29:15,523
<i>Yes.</i>

638
00:29:15,557 --> 00:29:17,191
Oh.

00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:18,560
LIZ:
Oh, my God.

640
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:19,860
It's really happening, babe.

641
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:20,928
We're gonna be billionaires.

642
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,196
[chuckling] Babe.

643
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:23,230
Ahem.

644
00:29:23,264 --> 00:29:24,798
Uh, no offense.

645
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:28,335
We are insanely flattered,
but um... why us?

646
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:30,137
It's simple math, really.

647
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,139
Our research shows
that you alone engage

648
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:34,408
with ten times more users
under the age of 25

649
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:38,245
than any other public figure
in the world.

650
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,514
I do?

651
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:42,016
Of course you do,
my handsome man.

652
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:43,284
[Jack chuckles]

653
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:45,219
<i>Your 55 million followers

00:29:54,596 --> 00:29:55,929
<i>and world markets.</i>

659
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:02,537
What we're proposing
is a trial merger.

660
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,172
See, how we feel about you
and your new role

661
00:30:05,205 --> 00:30:06,974
as leader of our media group

662
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:09,209
and after six months,
we make it a little more formal.

663
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,847
It's a simple offer sheet.

664
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:15,249
David already looked it over.

665
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:17,051
- It's just...
- Oh, fuck.

666
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:17,985

BEVERLY: Anything
you see or participate in

668
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:22,524
during this trial merger
stays between us.

669
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:25,959
It's like a formal family deal
before all the business stuff

670
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,094
gets ironed out.

671
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:32,900
[nervous chuckles] Yeah.

672
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:39,440
You ready?

673
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:44,411
Uh... here we go.

674
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:49,149
[Liz chuckles]

675
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:53,053
Great.

676
00:30:53,087 --> 00:30:55,889
[chuckles]

677
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:57,458
- Oh, it's amazing.
- Yeah.

678
00:30:57,491 --> 00:30:58,593
[Liz chuckles]

00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:01,462
[Jack sighs]

680
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:03,565
This is seriously the best day
of my life.

681
00:31:03,598 --> 00:31:05,132
Well, I mean apart
from our wedding...

682
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:07,034
- Yeah.
- Of course.

683
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:08,469
What's up, my Jullionaires?

684
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:12,005
I'm getting ready for a date
with a real life cowboy.

685
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:15,342
So, if you have pro tips,
make sure to DM them to me

686
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:18,212
or comment down below
to impress him.

687
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:21,516
And I've also been using
Wewe Face Glow,

688
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:24,485
which is what's keeping me
glowing.

689
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,155

Bye, guys.

692
00:31:35,262 --> 00:31:36,363
Oh, Jesus.

693
00:31:38,365 --> 00:31:40,000
What, is the deal off?

694
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:42,302
No, deal's very much on.

695
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,238
Then what's wrong?

696
00:31:44,271 --> 00:31:46,306
Uh, there is something seriously
off about this place

697
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,409
and I want no part of it.

698
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:49,943
Okay.

699
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:51,679
Don't have a Flynn attack.

700
00:31:51,713 --> 00:31:54,114
- Calm down.
- I'm calm.

701
00:31:54,148 --> 00:31:56,651
I'm just telling you
I think we should go now.

702
00:31:56,684 --> 00:31:58,419
What about your brother and Liz?

703
00:31:58,452 --> 00:32:00,487
They won't listen.

704
00:32:00,522 --> 00:32:02,322
I think this shit's bad.

705
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:05,292
Okay, what if that guy
on the road earlier was right

706
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:07,394
and these people
aren't just greedy,

707
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:09,062
they're evil?

708
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:10,632
Evil, really?

709
00:32:10,665 --> 00:32:13,200
That thing I read earlier said
Rektor's up to something.

710
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:15,703
And now they're offering us
all this crazy money

711
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:17,505
to help them promote it.

712
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:19,039
What kind of money?

713
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:20,174
Half a mil? Million?

714
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,042
Are they including me?

715
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:23,377
I'm serious.

716
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,547
- Are you coming with me or not?
- I would.

717
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,247
I really, really would but um,

718
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:28,750
actually I have a date tonight.

719
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,484
Harry.

720
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:32,453
A date.

721
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:34,121
Oh, Flynn, come on.

722
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:36,056
No, no, it's super cool.

723
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:37,191
No one believes me.

724
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:39,527
Everyone thinks
I'm just fucking nuts.

725
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:42,530
I guess I'll try to find
a signal somewhere

726
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:44,331
and see if I can catch an Uber

727
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:47,602
to go play my semi-final
death match alone.

728
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:49,704
Okay, sorry.

729
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:51,506
Text me.

730
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:52,473
Good luck with your death match.

732
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,187
You gotta be shitting me.

00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:15,530
I can... unbelievable.

734
00:33:21,703 --> 00:33:23,805
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

Don't... don't move.

738
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,781
Sshh.

739
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:09,383
Don't scream.

740
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:11,285
- Get away from me.
- Shhh.

741
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:13,086
The feeding hour is upon us.

742
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,223
Their heightened senses means
they can see everything.

[grunts]

744
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,761
What the hell's the matter
with you, dude?

745
00:34:19,794 --> 00:34:21,194
You can't just grab me.

746
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:22,530
You know what?

747
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:23,631
They had a valid fucking point.

748
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:24,532
You're the one
I should be scared of.

749
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:26,701
Not Rektor.

750
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:27,869
Put that mace down.

751
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:29,604
I'm trying to save you, Flynn.

752
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:30,738
How do you know my name?

753
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:31,573
I'll explain that later.

754
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:33,307
No, you're going to
explain it now

755
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,408
or I'm screaming.

756
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:35,475
We don't have time for this.

757
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:38,613
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

758
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:41,683
Where the hell are you going?

759
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:43,183
Hey!

760
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:45,285
You can't get a fucking signal
out here.

761
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:47,154
They only get a signal
when they want you to.

[Flynn sobbing]

763
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:48,756
Hey?

00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,358
Come with me now
before it's too late.

765
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:52,860
I don't need your help, old man.

766
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:01,368
Oh, I love this.

767
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:05,439
The smell is so authentic.

768
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:06,741
It's great.

Is that you?

00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:20,855

come this way, little lady?

00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:08,836
Shit.

Fuck.

Calm down, you freak.

789
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:00,822
You're just letting Flynn
get into your head.

790
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:14,367
I uh, took the liberty
of trying the wine.

791
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,938
It's really good.

792
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,408
Is it bio dynamic?

00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:22,677
Jules?

00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,252
Don't worry, cutie,
I'm coming for you.

Hello, Jules.

Okay. I thought
that you were a nice guy!

No, I ain't.

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,782
Why me?

We have to save my brother, too.

Alright, we'll see. Come on.

Oh, wow.

848
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:23,124
This feels like...

849
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:24,158
Home?

850
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:31,666
Our 500 print and television
subsidiaries worldwide

By the end of the decade,
we plan to have acquired

853

- Sweet.

00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,974
People, they call me,

heartless, a capitalist,
a gold digger.

NATALIE: And this of course
one of our many satellite locations,

857
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,949
where all data and imagery
are run through our algorithms

858
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:49,717
straight up to the cloud.

859
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,484
Sweet.

860
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,955
Algorithms are kind of my jam.

861
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:56,657
I just... I keep searching
for a sense of security

862
00:40:56,691 --> 00:40:58,259
and I know that the second
I find it,

863
00:40:58,292 --> 00:40:59,860
I'm gonna be a whole new person.

864
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:05,866
Well, I think you found it,
baby girl.

865
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,767
Come on.

866
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:09,670
NATALIE: We like to
think of our algorithm

867
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:11,872
as a giant filter

868
00:41:11,906 --> 00:41:14,909

narratives, and viewpoints.

Yes.

00:41:20,748 --> 00:41:22,149
Oh, wow.

moderate or conservative

873
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:27,955
leftist, fascist, anarchist,
it doesn't matter to us.

874

Heck yeah. [chuckles]

00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:45,039
What's mine is yours.

879
00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:46,674
Our ethos has always been,

880
00:41:46,707 --> 00:41:48,843
why be a part
of the conversation,

881
00:41:48,876 --> 00:41:51,746
when you could construct
the conversation itself?

882
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,281
Great question.

883
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:58,252
Sorry, was that a question?

884
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:06,861
Good eye.

885
00:42:06,894 --> 00:42:09,964
This is some top secret shit

886
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:12,166
that I should not be
showing you.

887
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,667
Is it Botox?

888
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:15,636
[chuckles] This is the vaccine.

889
00:42:17,238 --> 00:42:19,206
It's gonna heal the world.

890
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,009
Total immunity to everything.

891
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:23,010
Everything?

892
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:29,683
Just one little shot
and nothing will ever stop you.

893
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:31,318
Can I do it now?

894
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:32,887
No.

895
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,655
Oh.

896
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:36,123
But.

897
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:37,792
But?

898
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:40,961
Seeing that we're already
like family

899
00:42:40,995 --> 00:42:44,131
and this is a momentous
occasion,

900
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:46,033
it feels right
to make an exception.

901
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:53,174
ELLIOT: <i>Now, if an ageless billionaire
has pulled you into a wardrobe,</i>

902
00:42:53,207 --> 00:42:56,177
<i>inviting you to try
a secret serum in a syringe</i>

903
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,179
<i>from a creepy wooden box...</i>

904
00:42:58,212 --> 00:43:00,714
You ready to be
an untouchable queen?

905
00:43:00,748 --> 00:43:01,682
ELLIOT:
<i>Just say...</i>

906
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:02,683
Yes.

907
00:43:02,716 --> 00:43:03,951
Yes, please.

908
00:43:03,984 --> 00:43:06,654
ELLIOT:
<i>Wrong answer, sweetheart.</i>

909
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:08,022
Hey, uh, thanks for the tour,

910
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:10,324
but I should probably
be heading back.

911
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:12,093
My sister
and my friends are probably

912
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:13,194
wondering about me.

913
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:15,629
Here we go.

914
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:22,002
You haven't even met
Mr. Rektor yet.

915
00:43:22,036 --> 00:43:25,005
Oh, uh, oh, why, is he around?

916
00:43:27,808 --> 00:43:30,811
[groans]

917
00:43:30,845 --> 00:43:35,749
[♪♪♪]

918
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:17,291
Welcome to the rest
of your life.

919
00:44:22,163 --> 00:44:23,664
No shit.

920
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:30,037
I grew up pulling all-nighters
to watch re-runs of your show.

NARRATOR 2: <i>Catch A
Criminal with Elliot Jones.</i>

922
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:37,111

923
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:39,113

924
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:40,114
<i>Aahhh!</i>

925
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:41,916
NARRATOR 2:

926
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:42,917
<i>Watch out.</i>

00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,119
<i>Justice is back in town.</i>

<i>Ride alone with Elliot Jones

NARRATOR 3: <i>Thursdays
at 9:00, 8:00 Central on BDN.</i>

935
00:45:16,283 --> 00:45:17,318
What happened to you?

936
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:20,221
[sighs]

937
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,827
My daughter, Molly, she was...

938
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:30,264
she was murdered
in the hotel suite

939
00:45:30,297 --> 00:45:32,066
of a record label executive.

940
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:40,774
So... there was a trial,
highly publicized search

941
00:45:40,808 --> 00:45:43,511
for her killer
and all that bullshit.

942
00:45:43,545 --> 00:45:48,115
That's what led to setting
the whole show in motion.

943
00:45:48,148 --> 00:45:51,519
But it was all for her,
it was all for Molly.

944
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:58,926
I followed every clue
until it led me to the...

945
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:02,796
The owner of the record label.

946
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,865
Hmm.

947
00:46:04,898 --> 00:46:11,305
Who also happened to be
the owner of the network

948
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:13,575
that paid for my show.

949
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:15,175
Steven Rektor.

950
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:20,548
Steven fucking Rektor.

951
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:25,986
NATALIE:
This is our newest feature,

952
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,590
personally designed
by Mr. Rektor himself.

953
00:46:28,623 --> 00:46:29,456
It's the latest

954
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,192
in immersive
audio-visual experiences.

955
00:46:32,226 --> 00:46:33,827
What like VR?

956
00:46:33,861 --> 00:46:35,296
Like nothing you've ever seen.

957
00:46:39,366 --> 00:46:41,536
ELLIOT: A lot of people
think that vampires is the stuff

958
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:44,271
of fairy tales, and novels,
and all that bullshit.

959
00:46:44,305 --> 00:46:47,207
But little do they know
that Bram Stoker himself

960
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:48,909
was a vampire!

961
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:52,346
Making up lies to distract us
from the truth.

962
00:46:52,379 --> 00:46:56,584
That the vampire illuminati
not only walks among us,

963
00:46:56,618 --> 00:47:02,189
they've gamed our entire system,
our financial institutions.

964
00:47:02,222 --> 00:47:04,291
We got shadow governments
making up laws

965
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:06,093
we don't even
fucking know about.

966
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:09,430
Massive media mergers,
algorithms, data mining

967
00:47:09,463 --> 00:47:11,465
to control what people think.

968
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:14,168
While the police state
keeps us in line.

969
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:17,938
Now, we got a vaccine.

970
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:20,474
Yeah, all in the name
of healing the world

971
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:23,110
when it's really about keeping
our blood clean enough

972
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:24,646
for their consumption.

973
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:29,216
Rooting out the prey from
a super society of predators

974
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:35,657
who worship at the altar
of a vampire illuminati.

975
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,057
And that's the truth, baby.

976
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:43,531
JACK:
Okay so, I just lie there.

977
00:47:43,565 --> 00:47:46,500
Clothes on obviously, right.
No? Okay, I'm joking.

978
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:47,635
Alright.

979
00:47:49,637 --> 00:47:50,904
Whoa, here we go.

980
00:47:54,975 --> 00:47:56,210
Have fun.

981
00:47:56,243 --> 00:48:01,148
[♪♪♪]

982
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:55,035
Hello?

983
00:48:57,572 --> 00:48:58,405
Hello, Jack.

984
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:02,544
Steven?

985
00:49:02,577 --> 00:49:04,411
ELLIOT:
Cocksuckers, hang on a second.

986
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:07,448
Here we go.

987
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:08,583
Here we go.

988
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:10,017
[chuckles]

989
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:12,554
The Omega Society.

990
00:49:12,587 --> 00:49:14,488
It's the oldest
and most secretive society

991
00:49:14,522 --> 00:49:16,390
on the planet.

992
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:17,958
It's more of a cult really.

993
00:49:19,527 --> 00:49:22,296
Their origins date back
since before recorded history.

994
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:24,599
Want a smoke?

995
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:26,701
Uh, I... I vape.

996
00:49:26,734 --> 00:49:27,702
Grow up.

997
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:35,008
Look, they lived off the blood
of small mammals until...

998
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:38,312
until they realized
that drinking human blood

999
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:40,582
would give them immortal life.

1000
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:43,551
If they drank it often enough.

1001
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:45,520
But it wasn't long
until us humans

1002
00:49:45,553 --> 00:49:47,221
started fighting back.

1003
00:49:47,254 --> 00:49:48,121
By the Middle Ages,

1004
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:50,057
we had these motherfuckers
on the run.

1005
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:53,628
Then, they came up
with a new tactic.

1006
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:57,064
Fleeing their villages
in a mass migration.

1007
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:59,767
And then reintegrating
into our society,

1008
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:04,606
pretending... pretending,
mind you, to be one of us.

1009
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:06,139
But they're weak.

1010
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:08,075
They have a disease.

1011
00:50:08,108 --> 00:50:11,713
The whole family
has had a disease for 350 years.

1012
00:50:11,746 --> 00:50:14,147
And now Rektor's dying.

1013
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:16,183
And he thinks you're the cure.

1014
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:17,585
FLYNN:
What do you mean cure?

1015
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:20,153
ELLIOT: Hunters way before me
have been documenting their kills

1016
00:50:20,187 --> 00:50:21,756
for centuries.

1017
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:25,392
But there is one event
that changed everything.

1018
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:27,261
1627.

1019
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:29,463
During the Würzberg
witch trials,

1020
00:50:29,496 --> 00:50:32,767
a young woman,
a leper was prayed over

1021
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,370
by a powerful French cleric
Armand Jean du som...

1022
00:50:36,403 --> 00:50:37,437
Something.

1023
00:50:37,471 --> 00:50:39,707
Said to be touched by God
Himself.

1024
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:41,241
Anyway, puts his hands on her,

1025
00:50:41,275 --> 00:50:44,077
says a prayer, and boom,
she's healed.

1026
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:45,112
Just like that.

1027
00:50:45,145 --> 00:50:46,280
True miracle.

1028
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:49,216
Well, she healed so fast,
they thought she was a witch.

1029
00:50:49,249 --> 00:50:51,753
Decided to burn her at the stake

1030
00:50:51,786 --> 00:50:54,522
but the night
before her execution,

1031
00:50:54,556 --> 00:50:55,657
she had a visitor.

1032
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,327
A vampire patriarch
brutally drained her

1033
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,666
of every ounce of blood
in her frail body.

1034
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:10,270
But her blood... [chuckles]
...it was special.

1035
00:51:10,304 --> 00:51:12,874
Infused by
the Holy Spirit himself

1036
00:51:12,907 --> 00:51:14,709
thanks to the cleric, you see.

1037
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:19,179
She was given the divine gift
of life.

1038
00:51:19,212 --> 00:51:23,116
That will wreak havoc
on the dead.

1039
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,821
Her name was lost through time,
but she was forever referred to

1040
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:32,827
as the "Geist des Schicksals",
"the Ghost of Fate".

1041
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,530
And through the centuries,
that infected bloodline

1042
00:51:35,563 --> 00:51:38,633
has run rampant
through the Rektor family

1043
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:41,836
making each generation
shorter, and weaker,

1044
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:44,806
and more desperate
than the ones before.

1045
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:48,509
And now Steven Rektor thinks
that you and Jack are the cure.

1046
00:51:48,543 --> 00:51:49,744
Holy shit.

1047
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:51,779
ELLIOT:
And hell, I think they're right!

1048
00:51:51,813 --> 00:51:54,916
My theory is that not only is
your blood the right type,

1049
00:51:54,949 --> 00:51:57,317
but you and Jack have
Rektor DNA.

1050
00:51:57,351 --> 00:52:00,622
Your great grandpa
Wilbur Chambers

1051
00:52:00,655 --> 00:52:05,860
married a Lydia Riechtor,
which could have been Rektor.

1052
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:07,595
Vampires are changing
their fucking names

1053
00:52:07,629 --> 00:52:08,663
all the time,

1054
00:52:08,696 --> 00:52:11,331
That's why they're after you.

1055
00:52:11,365 --> 00:52:15,770
'Cause they think you and Jack
are part of the family.

1056
00:52:15,803 --> 00:52:17,605
So, we gotta go now.

1057
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:19,172
- ELLIOT: We're not ready.
- Why not?

1058
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:20,742
ELLIOT:
We've gotta prepare.

1059
00:52:20,775 --> 00:52:22,644
I thought that's what
we've been doing.

1060
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:24,946
I've been killing vamps
a long time, honey.

1061
00:52:24,979 --> 00:52:28,348
Steven Rektor,
that son of a bitch,

1062
00:52:28,382 --> 00:52:29,584
he ain't no ordinary vampire.

1063
00:52:29,617 --> 00:52:30,618
Nope.

1064
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:32,654
He's a dark lord,

1065
00:52:32,687 --> 00:52:35,690
whose royal bloodline goes back
to the very beginning.

1066
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:37,525
Now, you take him out,

1067
00:52:37,558 --> 00:52:39,761
you take out one of the biggest
vamp syndicates of all time.

1068
00:52:39,794 --> 00:52:42,262
I can't believe this is
my fucking life right now.

1069
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:46,166
Okay. Rektor's birthday
as on record is 1921.

1070
00:52:47,602 --> 00:52:51,471
Now, a vampire's natural
lifespan is of course endless.

1071
00:52:51,506 --> 00:52:53,808
But no financial
or real estate records

1072
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:56,276
ever show one vampire
ever living past

1073
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:56,844
the century mark.

1074
00:52:56,878 --> 00:52:58,579
What does that mean?

1075
00:52:58,613 --> 00:53:00,380
It means after 100 years,

1076
00:53:00,414 --> 00:53:03,551
they simply vanish
into thin air.

1077
00:53:03,584 --> 00:53:05,853
So you're saying that Rektor
is near the...

1078
00:53:05,887 --> 00:53:07,855
expiration date.

1079
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:11,959
But he's also immortal,
so what does that mean?

1080
00:53:11,993 --> 00:53:15,563
Vampires age and die
just like you and me.

1081
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:18,498
But their spirit never does.

1082
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:21,836
They simply move on
to a new host.

1083
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,738
Somebody they feel can carry on
their legacy.

1084
00:53:23,771 --> 00:53:25,840
Yup, yup, that's Jack.

1085
00:53:27,608 --> 00:53:28,910
I've been waiting for you.

1086
00:53:32,046 --> 00:53:33,313
Wow, man.

1087
00:53:33,346 --> 00:53:34,716
You look so...

1088
00:53:34,749 --> 00:53:35,783
Real.

1089
00:53:35,817 --> 00:53:37,719
Yeah.

1090
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:39,352
What... and dude, this place,
it's...

1091
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:40,922
It's ah...

1092
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:43,457
You know, it's strange,
it kind of reminds me of, um...

1093
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:44,759
Winston's Bar and Grill?

1094
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:47,628
Yeah.

1095
00:53:47,662 --> 00:53:48,495
Dude.

1096
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:49,630
Oh, yeah, no.

1097
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:52,600
Man, I... I used to work here.

1098
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:54,869
I mean not here,
you know the... the real one.

1099
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:56,704
Not virtual, but...

1100
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:58,606
Yeah, no, I... I was the DJ.

1101
00:54:00,474 --> 00:54:02,710
I mean to be honest,
I was pretty fucking bad.

1102
00:54:02,744 --> 00:54:03,945
[chuckles]

1103
00:54:03,978 --> 00:54:08,281
Umm, but this place is where
I made my first YouTube videos

1104
00:54:08,315 --> 00:54:09,050
with my roommate.

1105
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:10,885
It's uh...

1106
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:12,954
How did you know?

1107
00:54:12,987 --> 00:54:14,622
I know everything about you.

1108
00:54:14,655 --> 00:54:19,994
Your high school crush
to your first viral video.

1109
00:54:20,027 --> 00:54:23,030
The first million dollars
you ever made.

1110
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:26,601
The day you met Liz
to the exact amount of money

1111
00:54:26,634 --> 00:54:29,570
in your checking account
right now.

1112
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:32,740
Yeah. Oh, shit, uh...

1113
00:54:32,774 --> 00:54:35,777
You... about that,
umm, Mr. Rektor,

1114
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,478
the reason that account
is so low is just because,

1115
00:54:38,513 --> 00:54:40,782
you know,
our overheads are so high.

1116
00:54:40,815 --> 00:54:43,050
Uh, but I can assure you
Stream Team's value

1117
00:54:43,084 --> 00:54:44,786
is still rocking high.

1118
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:47,889
[chuckles]
We don't care about all that.

1119
00:54:47,922 --> 00:54:50,858
Jack, everything you think
you know about the world,

1120
00:54:50,892 --> 00:54:53,661
it's all about to change.

1121
00:54:53,694 --> 00:54:56,396
You are about to change.

1122
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:57,665
I am?

1123
00:54:57,698 --> 00:55:01,301
It's time for
your next evolutionary step.

1124
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:07,041
Sorry, I...

1125
00:55:07,074 --> 00:55:08,643
I think I'm a bit confused.

1126
00:55:08,676 --> 00:55:12,379
Umm, when you say...
What do you mean...

1127
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:20,555
Huh, what's going on?

1128
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:25,092
[laughing in background]

1129
00:55:25,793 --> 00:55:26,727
Umm...

1130
00:55:31,766 --> 00:55:33,768
Hey guys, very funny.

1131
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:35,736
I get it.

1132
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:38,005
You know I thought this was
gonna be like a VR experience

1133
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:41,008
on a beach,
you know or in space.

1134
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:42,910
Something.

1135
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:48,916
[♪♪♪]

1136
00:56:15,509 --> 00:56:17,477
[banging]

1137
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:19,479
Can someone let me out of here,
please?

1138
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:24,585
Oh, come on, okay.

1139
00:56:28,022 --> 00:56:30,457
Umm, okay, so, that was great.

1140
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:33,094
I'm... I'm sorry, I...
I... I have to go.

1141
00:56:33,127 --> 00:56:34,996
It was...
It was nice meeting you guys,

1142
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:36,864
but umm, listen, I'm sorry.

1143
00:56:36,898 --> 00:56:39,033
I uh, I... I really gotta go.

1144
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:40,034
You're not going anywhere.

1145
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:40,968
Sorry, Jack.

1146
00:56:41,002 --> 00:56:43,070
No, no, it's cool.
No need to apologize.

1147
00:56:43,104 --> 00:56:44,805
I'm just gonna let myself out.

1148
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:45,940
It was nice meeting you guys.

1149
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:48,009
Liz?

1150
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:51,178
Hi.

1151
00:56:53,014 --> 00:56:55,516
Baby. Oh, my God, baby.

1152
00:56:57,752 --> 00:56:59,186
[growls]

1153
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,121
Baby.

1154
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:03,490
Are you okay?

1155
00:57:03,524 --> 00:57:05,226
Never better.

1156
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:06,694
Baby, we... we... we gotta go.

1157
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:08,495
- Now.
- No.

1158
00:57:08,529 --> 00:57:10,131
- Why?
- Why?

1159
00:57:10,164 --> 00:57:11,165
We made it, baby.

1160
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:12,833
No, no, we didn't.

1161
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:14,101
This place is a fucking trap.

1162
00:57:14,135 --> 00:57:15,703
Baby, we gotta go.

1163
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:16,537
Kiss me.

1164
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,538
Now?

1165
00:57:17,571 --> 00:57:19,006
[growls] Kiss me.

1166
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,141
Oh, shit!

1167
00:57:20,174 --> 00:57:21,709
Oh, shit.
You're one of them.

1168
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:23,244
Eternal life, Jack.

1169
00:57:23,277 --> 00:57:24,145
[demonic voice]
Think about it.

1170
00:57:24,178 --> 00:57:26,147
We have more money, power,
and success

1171
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,615
than we ever imagined.

1172
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:29,750
It's the Holy Grail, Jack.

1173
00:57:29,784 --> 00:57:32,253
No, no, no, I'm sorry,
this is not okay.

1174
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:33,521
I can't...

1175
00:57:33,554 --> 00:57:35,523
We can't be like these people.

1176
00:57:35,556 --> 00:57:37,658
We just need to get you
to a hospital.

1177
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:39,961
You know, there's still time.
We can reverse this.

1178
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:42,697
- [growls]
- Oh, fuck fangs, oh, God.

1179
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,664
Oh.

1180
00:57:47,001 --> 00:57:48,736
Ah.

1181
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:49,870
Goodnight, Jack.

1182
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:54,842
[♪♪♪]

1183
00:58:09,957 --> 00:58:11,192
Let me out of here.

1184
00:58:11,225 --> 00:58:13,661
Oh, let's not be difficult here.

1185
00:58:13,694 --> 00:58:15,229
You should be grateful.

1186
00:58:15,262 --> 00:58:18,199
You're about to be a king,
and join the spirits

1187
00:58:18,232 --> 00:58:20,034
with the longest bloodline
in the world.

1188
00:58:22,103 --> 00:58:24,672
JACK:
Please, I'm begging you.

1189
00:58:24,705 --> 00:58:25,740
There's been a mistake.

1190
00:58:25,773 --> 00:58:27,641
This isn't
what we signed up for.

1191
00:58:27,675 --> 00:58:28,843
Page six.

1192
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:31,746
A full transference of all
of Steven and Beverly Rektor's

1193
00:58:31,779 --> 00:58:34,315
assets, including their own
personal DNA.

1194
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:36,751
You did read the contract,
correct?

1195
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:42,823
Look, whatever you're planning,
just find someone else, okay?

1196
00:58:42,857 --> 00:58:46,160
I'm... I'm not gonna tell anyone,
I promise.

1197
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:47,862
We don't want anyone.

1198
00:58:47,895 --> 00:58:49,964
We chose you.

1199
00:58:49,997 --> 00:58:52,800
Chose me for what?

1200
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:55,002
Welcome to the family.

1201
00:58:55,036 --> 00:58:56,103
What, no!

1202
00:58:56,137 --> 00:58:58,672
No, please. No.

1203
00:58:58,706 --> 00:59:01,575
[Jack's muffled screams]

1204
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:07,882
Well, full transition,
less than an hour.

1205
00:59:07,915 --> 00:59:09,884
An hour?
I saw him like an hour ago.

1206
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:11,585
That's why I'm saying
we should be going now.

1207
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:14,889
These bastards are the most
vicious, the strongest,

1208
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:18,125
fastest, most vile motherfuckers
on this planet.

1209
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:20,728
The games are over, honey.

1210
00:59:20,761 --> 00:59:21,562
You walk in that house,

1211
00:59:21,595 --> 00:59:23,297
chances are
you'll get exsanguinated

1212
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:25,800
in less than a minute
walking through the door.

1213
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:26,834
Sounds fun.

1214
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:29,236
Hey, I'm serious.

1215
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,638
You gotta follow my lead.

1216
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:35,076
Whatever it takes
to save my brother.

1217
00:59:37,945 --> 00:59:40,614
You know I always thought
I'd die alone.

1218
00:59:40,648 --> 00:59:42,116
It's nice to know
I got some company.

1219
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:47,254
Always aim for the chest.

1220
00:59:47,288 --> 00:59:51,092
A wooden stake or a silver blade
through the heart,

1221
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:53,761
are the only proven way
to kill these bastards.

1222
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:55,329
How... how long have you been
killing these things for?

1223
00:59:57,665 --> 00:59:58,966
A long fucking time.

1224
00:59:58,999 --> 01:00:00,334
Come on.

1225
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:03,704
Countermeasures,
always have 'em on you.

1226
01:00:03,737 --> 01:00:06,173
Crosses,
the fear of God slows 'em down.

1227
01:00:06,207 --> 01:00:08,175
But mine packs an extra punch.

1228
01:00:08,209 --> 01:00:09,376
Cute.

1229
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,212
Holy water.

1230
01:00:11,245 --> 01:00:13,114
Only use this as a last resort

1231
01:00:13,147 --> 01:00:15,182
when shit really hits the fan,
okay?

1232
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:18,953
And no self-respecting
vampire hunter

1233
01:00:18,986 --> 01:00:20,821
ever leaves home without
a pack of these babies.

1234
01:00:22,723 --> 01:00:25,326
Liquid garlic.

1235
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,730
Explodes on contact
with any vamp scum.

1236
01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:31,732
Huh, vamp scum?

1237
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:34,001
Yeah. What?

1238
01:00:34,034 --> 01:00:35,002
Nothing.

1239
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:36,770
It's a cool nickname.

1240
01:00:36,804 --> 01:00:38,439
And last but sure as shit
not least,

1241
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:40,274
there's the four-second rule.

1242
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:42,209
Now, a typical vampire
just wants to drain your blood

1243
01:00:42,243 --> 01:00:44,879
and leave you for dead, right?

1244
01:00:44,912 --> 01:00:48,916
But if you get fangs in
with the dark Lord or his ilk,

1245
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:51,919
you got exactly
four Mississippis to get 'em out

1246
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:52,753
before you turn.

1247
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:55,356
And if you do turn,
I got no choice,

1248
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:58,425
but to stake your ass
to the grave.

1249
01:00:58,459 --> 01:00:59,994
Ditto.

1250
01:01:00,027 --> 01:01:01,462

1251
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:02,963
Fat chance, kid.

1252
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:07,201
We're close.

1253
01:01:08,736 --> 01:01:11,071
FLYNN:
Anything else I should know?

1254
01:01:11,105 --> 01:01:14,308
Yeah, yeah, there is.

1255
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:16,877
We're gonna do everything
we can to help your brother.

1256
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:22,183
But there are thousands of lives
at stake here.

1257
01:01:22,216 --> 01:01:24,451
Now, we got three hours
till sunrise

1258
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:26,487
and a lot of vampire ass to kick
between now and then.

1259
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:30,257
So, are you ready?

1260
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:33,093
Actually give me one second.

1261
01:01:33,127 --> 01:01:34,962
What the hell are you doing?

1262
01:01:34,995 --> 01:01:37,231
I may have missed
the semi-finals,

1263
01:01:37,264 --> 01:01:39,466
I'm gonna show the league
that I'm good enough to go pro.

1264
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,235
You're filming this?

1265
01:01:41,268 --> 01:01:42,870
Got a problem with that?

1266
01:01:42,903 --> 01:01:43,871
Do I have a choice?

1267
01:01:43,904 --> 01:01:45,773
No, not really.

1268
01:01:45,806 --> 01:01:47,942
Alright, locked and loaded.

Holy crap, guys.

1272
01:02:58,045 --> 01:02:59,980
Flynn Chambers is back on live.

1273
01:03:00,014 --> 01:03:01,181
Oh, my gosh.

1274
01:03:01,215 --> 01:03:04,018
And it looks like she's in
a secret bunker with her dad.

1275
01:03:04,051 --> 01:03:04,719
That's not her dad.

1276
01:03:04,753 --> 01:03:06,920
Her dad died three years ago.

1277
01:03:06,954 --> 01:03:09,189
Let's just say it,
her outfit's pretty badass.

1278
01:03:09,223 --> 01:03:10,357
She looks like she can kill.

1279
01:03:10,391 --> 01:03:11,825
And the whole bow
and arrow thing

1280
01:03:11,859 --> 01:03:13,861
is very Fortnite 2019.

1281
01:03:13,894 --> 01:03:16,430
But she's bringing it back
and I'm here for it.

1282
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:17,998
This stuff is
legit scary though.

1283
01:03:18,032 --> 01:03:19,601
We need to find out
who that guy is.

1284
01:03:19,634 --> 01:03:20,501
Yeah, for real.

1285
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:22,403
That guy is mad sus.

1286
01:03:22,436 --> 01:03:23,971
Wait, look...
Looks like she's starting.

1287
01:03:24,004 --> 01:03:25,939
Shhh.

Easy, girls.

1293
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:51,566
Easy now.

1295
01:04:00,441 --> 01:04:01,875

Oh.

Nice reflexes there, lady.

1299
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:43,050
Fuck you very much.

1300
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:44,519
Here.

1301
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:46,420
Rektor's close.

1302
01:04:46,453 --> 01:04:48,523
I can feel it.

1303
01:04:48,556 --> 01:04:52,092
So when we find Rektor,
how do we take him down?

1304
01:04:52,126 --> 01:04:56,564
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.

1305
01:04:56,598 --> 01:04:58,499
Are you fucking kidding me?

1306
01:04:58,533 --> 01:04:59,967
You insane?

1307
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,002
When I said I'd alone,
I wasn't fucking.

1308
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:11,245
There's no known way to kill
a Dark Lord or his queen.

1309
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:13,347
I'm just looking for some way,
any way

1310
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,149
to break the cycle
and in the transition

1311
01:05:15,182 --> 01:05:16,950
maybe save your brother.

1312
01:05:16,984 --> 01:05:18,385
Alright.

1313
01:05:18,419 --> 01:05:21,388
The simple fact is ain't nobody
ever done that

1314
01:05:21,422 --> 01:05:23,357

<i>In fact, there's only been
three documented attempts.</i>

<i>First, is none other than the
inspiration for Dracula himself.</i>

1320

<i>Vlad the Impaler.</i>

1321
01:05:39,741 --> 01:05:42,443
<i>A brutal leader who,
as legend has it,</i>

1322
01:05:42,476 --> 01:05:47,014
<i>dipped pieces of bread
in bowls of his victims' blood.</i>

1323
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:49,684
<i>He staked their bodies
all over Eastern Europe.</i>

1324
01:05:49,717 --> 01:05:53,220
<i>But not documented,
Vlad was almost defeated</i>

1325
01:05:53,253 --> 01:05:56,990
<i>by a Bavarian goldsmith
named Syd the Shylock.</i>

1326
01:05:57,024 --> 01:05:59,594
<i>Trapped Vlad with the aid
of his cousin, Esther,</i>

1327
01:05:59,627 --> 01:06:00,895
<i>who well may be a whore.</i>

1328
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:03,631
<i>And he fed him divine water

1329
01:06:03,665 --> 01:06:05,600
<i>for three weeks straight.</i>

1330
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:08,268
<i>But one morning
when Syd left for town,</i>

1331
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:10,103
<i>Vlad seduced Esther,</i>

1332

1336
01:06:22,784 --> 01:06:25,152
<i>And then there's Jack the

1337
01:06:25,185 --> 01:06:26,420

the Welsh murderer,</i>

1338

<i>the very first serial killer,</i>

1339
01:06:28,222 --> 01:06:31,258

<i>one detective,
Frederick George Abberline,</i>

<i>knew the truth.</i>

1342
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:38,332
<i>Jack wasn't a serial killer.</i>

1343
01:06:38,365 --> 01:06:40,735
<i>He was the leader

I know a lot of you
have questions.

1611
01:23:51,566 --> 01:23:53,066
I definitely do.

1612
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,703
Like is this a new promo
for a new vampire movie?

1613
01:23:55,737 --> 01:23:58,105
If it's so, what's the name?

1614
01:23:58,138 --> 01:24:00,107
And I guess Jules finally
quit the business.

1616
01:24:01,108 --> 01:24:02,744
And when is Liz's new nail kit
coming out?

1617
01:24:02,777 --> 01:24:05,279
'Cause this bitch
definitely needs it.

1618
01:24:05,312 --> 01:24:06,548
Sophie,
what's our news for today?

1619
01:24:09,149 --> 01:24:11,184
Okay, guys, so I listen to MPR

1620
01:24:11,218 --> 01:24:14,556
and basically, everyone went
missing from the compound.

1621
01:24:14,589 --> 01:24:17,559
And there are serious reports
of foul play.

1622
01:24:17,592 --> 01:24:19,059
What's MPR, girl?

1623
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:21,563
[bleeped] idiot.

1624
01:24:23,497 --> 01:24:25,299
So today our plan
is to look back

1625
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:27,735
from the live streams and posts
from the past few days.

1626
01:24:27,769 --> 01:24:28,803
But before we do that,

1627
01:24:28,836 --> 01:24:32,707
I gotta give a big shout-out
to our sponsor, LIT.

1628
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:36,143
It's a new deodorant
for dudes like me and you.

1629
01:24:36,176 --> 01:24:38,412
Also don't forget to subscribe.

1630
01:24:38,445 --> 01:24:40,414
What about my sweatshirt
sponsorship?

1631
01:24:40,447 --> 01:24:41,583
- No one cares about that.
- No one cares.

1632
01:24:41,616 --> 01:24:43,483
But... but this.
