1
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:49,046
- Ally, can we get a recap?
- Remember the Kowolskis?

2
00:00:49,127 --> 00:00:53,279
They want to set a record by
making Buffalo's largest cookie.

3
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:55,244
- You have to wear this.
- A hairnet?

4
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:59,240
H.ealth Department. Ifyou're around
the cookie, you have to have it on.

5
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:00,646
Ijust did the hair.

6
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,046
The hairis perfect.

7
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:04,243
All right, give it to me.

8
00:01:06,247 --> 00:01:09,603
God... why do you hate me?

9
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:12,326
We're rolling. And speed.

10
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:15,080
For three decades,
the Kowolski Bakery

11
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,965
has been a mainstay
in downtown Buffalo,

12
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:21,596
known for their sinfully sweet,
cream-filled Polski pierogies

13
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:25,475
and the occasional
sugar-induced coma that follows.

14
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:28,286
Today, in honour of their 30th anniversary,

15
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:32,121
they've invited us to ride along
as they go for the record

16
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:35,037
on Buffalo's biggest cookie.

17
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:41,361
Vol. Do you need
a tissue or something?

18
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:44,007
Can we get Vol a tissue? Or a spoon?

19
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:45,884
Good thing we're wearing these.

20
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:49,198
I wouldn't want any stray hairs
to fall into the booger.

21
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:51,960
- We doing this again?
- No. We can cut to B roll.

22
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:53,275
Moving on!

23
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:57,565
Tell me, Mama,
why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?

24
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:04,725
Well, man from Health Department
say he find rat pellet in our pastry.

25
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:09,039
But I say no, is big chocolate sprinkle.

26
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:11,766
But he shut store down.

27
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:14,282
So we clean up,

28
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:18,440
make big cookie
for to bring customers back.

29
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:21,683
Well, I admire your candour.

30
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,564
Let's try that again, shall we?

31
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:27,526
Tell me, Mama,
why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?

32
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:32,565
So the children of the neighbourhood
will be happy.

33
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:36,196
It must be wonderful seeing
the smiles on their little faces.

34
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,796
I work in back. I see no smiles.

35
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:47,005
The previous record was 8 feet
7 inches, baked by Gladys Pelsnick.

36
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:49,965
If this cookie beats that, it will prove

37
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:52,197
the Kowolskis
have much more free time.

38
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:55,916
And the cookie is... 1 0 feet, 4 inches!

39
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:58,567
We have a new record!

40
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,840
Cue the cheesy inspirational music!

41
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:21,196
But what are we really looking at here?

42
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:23,084
Is it just a big cookie?

43
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:26,204
Or does this cookie represent
the pride of Buffalo?

44
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:29,518
Its hard-working citizens
the key ingredient -

45
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:31,598
with a few nuts thrown in.

46
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:34,603
And finally,
the love of our families,

47
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:37,326
which provides the warm centre,

48
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:41,685
making our beloved Buffalo
the sweetest place to live.

49
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:44,520
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

50
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:47,519
I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News.

51
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:50,478
And cut.

52
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:53,124
So what do you think?

53
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:54,606
It's really good.

54
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:57,247
It sucks. It's a story about a cookie.

55
00:03:57,327 --> 00:04:00,524
The Pillsbury Doughboy
would be riveted.

56
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,839
It made me laugh. Nothing wrong
with making people laugh.

57
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:08,476
I'll never be an anchorman.
The job's there, but I can't reach it.

58
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:13,357
Every time they make me do
this kind of stuff I have to act like a goof.

59
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:16,757
I have no credibility. Not good.

60
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:19,122
- Now you just sound silly.
- Forget it.

61
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:22,722
It's not important.
Let's watch it one more time.

62
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,758
- No.
- Once more? Please?

63
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,237
No! You promised to help me
with this photo album.

64
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:31,443
Now get your gooy butt over here.

65
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:37,878
Looking.

66
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,476
OK.

67
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:43,526
Just go through this stack
and pick your favourites.

68
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:50,004
Come on. This is fun, right?

69
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:52,078
Isn't this fun? This is nice.

70
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:54,958
Evan's going to get that anchor job.

71
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:56,639
- Bruce!
- He's the favourite.

72
00:04:56,727 --> 00:05:00,356
You know what? Just forget it.
This is just our life.

73
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:03,405
We can always just
have some kid do it for us.

74
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,919
Hold the phone.

75
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:08,475
I like this one.
Our weekend at the lake.

76
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:11,479
That's supposed to be in our private stash.

77
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:14,798
- You look perky. Must have been cold.
- Give it to me.

78
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:17,242
I think I'll put this on my computer.

79
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,283
- Give it to me. Come on.
- No!

80
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:21,437
Fine. Do with it what you will.

81
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:23,199
I don't care.

82
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:25,676
- I will do with it what I will.
- Jesus.

83
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,957
I might even send this in to Playboy.

84
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:33,801
- Their layouts can be quite tasteful.
- Give that to me right now!

85
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,758
- Rough stuff.
- I'm going to hurt you.

86
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:44,403
Sweetie? Time to get up.

87
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,838
Good dream. No.

88
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:02,638
The Buffalo Sabres lost again last
night to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

89
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:05,082
Of course they did. They're my team.

90
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,398
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

91
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:10,365
There might be something
to this cookie line.

92
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:15,840
The greatest anchors have a signature
sign-off. Like Walter Cronkite.

93
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:19,922
And that's the way it was.

94
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:23,204
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

95
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:27,644
That's the way I like it

96
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:30,120
Oh, no.

97
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:32,721
- Grace, the dog!
- I'm in the shower!

98
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:39,159
No, Sam. Bad dog.

99
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:41,477
Inside, bad. Outside, good.

100
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:50,278
You're done now. Great.

101
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,000
B-E-A-utiful.

102
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:58,366
Come on.
Let's go back in and have a shit.

103
00:07:03,607 --> 00:07:06,565
- What is the dillio?
- We are having a blood drive.

104
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,882
- Needles. Yuck.
- They need my blood.

105
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:13,243
I have a very rare blood type.
I'm AB positive.

106
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:15,397
Really? I'm IB positive.

107
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:19,400
I B positive they ain't touching me
with no needle. It's just so...

108
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:22,206
- Helpful and life-saving?
- No. It's blood.

109
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:25,757
Blood is supposed to stay
inside the body, where it's meant to be.

110
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:29,681
Besides, they stockpile this stuff
in a warehouse, it's all on ice,

111
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,519
and they say there's a shortage.

112
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:33,518
Where did you hear that?

113
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:35,484
From a friend of a friend

114
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:39,037
of a girl whose sister is going out with
someone in the government.

115
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,402
For your protection,
I cannot discuss it.

116
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,796
Now get out,
before they see us together.

117
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:50,400
Here. You need these more than I do.

118
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:51,886
What is "these"?

119
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:54,117
Prayer beads.
The kids made them for me.

120
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,995
- They will keep you safe.
- I hope they're powerful.

121
00:07:58,087 --> 00:08:01,477
I'm going to need a friggin' miracle
to get to work on time.

122
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:15,242
This isn't happening.
Not now. Not during sweeps week.

123
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:21,124
Oh, God.

124
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,401
Yup, meeting started without me.

125
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:27,001
This is my luck.

126
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:35,598
Come on.

127
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:41,118
Jesus.

128
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:43,238
Get out of there!

129
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:50,165
"Are you blind?" No, but I'm late.

130
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:55,085
Is yourchild in direjeopardy?

131
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,158
Find out tonight after the game.

132
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:58,919
Promos are approved.

133
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:02,079
Jack? Shouldn't we be focusing
on Pete's retirement?

134
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,523
- This is his last week.
- Any word on the anchor position?

135
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:08,485
Evan, when I know something,
you'll know something.

136
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:10,879
Sorry I'm late.

137
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,242
Traffic was...

138
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,079
Did you already play the spots?

139
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:17,806
Nice story,
but we're going with Evan's piece.

140
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:21,118
The sex scandal
in the mayor's office for sweeps.

141
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:25,161
Yeah. Sweeps.

142
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,997
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

143
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:31,678
I'm just messing with you, Bruce.

144
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:37,763
See, you just gotta remember that
the newsroom is like a big cookie.

145
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:43,162
Do you like jazz, Evan?
Let me play something for you.

146
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,640
- I can hold that note all day.
- Knock it off, guys.

147
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,283
We'll keep your story in reserve.

148
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:59,360
Can we get back to the board so we'll
have something to put on the air today?

149
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:03,156
Great choice, Jack.
The Cadillac of bolognas.

150
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:05,044
Jack, can I talk to you?

151
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:07,687
- Sure. What do you need?
- Sweeps.

152
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:11,476
Jack, hear me out.
I'm starting to get desperate.

153
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:13,802
I'm pushing 40
and what have I got to show?

154
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:18,199
I've hit a kind of ceiling. There's an
anti-Bruce barrier I can't get past.

155
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:21,484
And Evan is loving it.

156
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,355
He gets the stories, he gets on sweeps...
I should be more like Evan.

157
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:27,563
Don't be like Evan. Evan's an asshole.

158
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:30,366
- I can be an asshole.
- No, Bruce. You can't.

159
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:37,726
- You going to pick that up?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

160
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:41,436
This anchor thing opening up
has got me nuts.

161
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:43,518
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi, Jack.

162
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:48,878
You're a good reporter.
You make people laugh.

163
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:52,239
All right. I'll tell you what.

164
00:10:52,327 --> 00:10:55,478
Today is the 1 56th anniversary
of the Maid Of The Mist.

165
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:59,799
- I want you in Niagara Falls in an hour.
- The Maid Of The Mist is always live.

166
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,525
- Evan always does the live feeds.
- Now you and Evan get the live feeds.

167
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:07,757
I'm going live? During sweeps?

168
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:10,156
Watch your step.
I've seen your outtakes.

169
00:11:10,247 --> 00:11:12,124
Jack, you will not regret this.

170
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:15,647
And I won't forget you
when I go national.

171
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:17,319
Can you...?

172
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:20,318
Thanks, pal.

173
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:24,082
Can I have your wish now?
I'll put it in the wish jar.

174
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,520
Put your wish in.

175
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:27,598
- Me, too.
- Put your wish in.

176
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,964
That looks like a big wish.

177
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:32,925
No, Martin, don't eat that.

178
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:35,919
Don't put that in your mouth.
That's paste, honey.

179
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:41,084
- That must have tasted awful.
- Mommy!

180
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:46,279
Did you have a good time
with Aunt Gracie today?

181
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:50,645
- See how nice this is? Baby on the hip.
- It's amazing. You've become Mom.

182
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:52,957
The transformation is complete.

183
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,316
I'll get it.

184
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:57,204
- Small Wonders Day Care.
- Grace?

185
00:11:57,287 --> 00:12:00,279
It's Debbie, the sister
whose life you're notwasting.

186
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:02,483
- OK.
- Bye, Debbie!

187
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,558
Hi. Sorry.

188
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:07,525
Debbie forgot to take her meds today.
Where are you?

189
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:10,041
A little place
called the winner's circle.

190
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:12,243
I'm at the falls, doing a live report.

191
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:14,238
Live? That's great!

192
00:12:14,327 --> 00:12:17,285
Yeah! It's happening, hon.
I got sweeps and I'm live.

193
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,562
They're seeing if I can think on my feet.

194
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:22,400
Like I might have to do
in a live anchor situation.

195
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:24,079
Oh, my gosh.

196
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:27,842
Yeah! Jack practically came out
and told me.

197
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:29,155
Practically?

198
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:32,045
He didn't spell it out. Legally, he can't.

199
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,439
This is what happened to Susan Ortega
before they bumped her up to the desk.

200
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:38,643
It's good.

201
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:42,720
Well, honey, I just don't want you
to get too ahead of yourself.

202
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:44,399
- Bruce.
- I got to go!

203
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:47,604
- They're calling me in.
- OK, honey. Good luck. I love you.

204
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:51,320
Let's do it.

205
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:55,276
- They want you close to the falls.
- I'm going to get soaked.

206
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,835
That's the point.
They want you to put this on.

207
00:12:57,927 --> 00:13:00,885
Part of the condition
of us getting the exclusive.

208
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:04,880
You know what?
Nothing can bother me today. Nothing.

209
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:08,482
Now remember,
it's their 1 56th-year anniversary.

210
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:12,446
1 49 capacity. They cater
to tourists, honeymooners...

211
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:15,280
And people who are insanely thirsty.
I get it.

212
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:17,881
You're going to interview
lrene Dansfield.

213
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:21,960
Irene, a pleasure to meet you.
You look beautiful.

214
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,322
Irene's mother rode on the maiden voyage.

215
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:26,238
- Rub that in my face!
- 90 seconds!

216
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:27,760
Holy hell.

217
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,963
Because of the fast response,

218
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:35,926
the chemicals were cleaned up
without incident. Susan?

219
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:38,157
Bruce Nolan is at Niagara Falls.

220
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:41,444
But before we go live to Bruce,
we have an announcement.

221
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:43,961
As everyone knows, after 33 years,

222
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:47,278
our beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.

223
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:51,838
Pete's shoes are virtually impossible
to fill, but the show must go on.

224
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:57,206
And we could think ofno one better
than our very own Evan Baxter.

225
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:00,602
Oh, boy!

226
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,601
- Congratulations.
- I'm thrilled and honoured.

227
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:08,078
As you said, no one can replace
Pete, but I will do my best.

228
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:12,638
I am so proud to be a part
of our local community of Buffalo.

229
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:17,642
I think, in a lot of ways, a great
city is like a great recipe, really.

230
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:21,117
You take hard-working citizens,
add some care-givers,

231
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:22,959
maybe a few nuts!

232
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:29,722
All sprinkled with the love
and support of our good families.

233
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:33,720
Ultimately, that makes
one sweet place to live.

234
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:37,199
- That was amazing.
- I wish I'd written something.

235
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:40,802
And now let's go live to that wacky
Bruce Nolan at Niagara Falls.

236
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,559
Hey, wacky Bruce!

237
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:49,918
- Talk, Bruce. Hello.
- Talk, honey.

238
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,804
- What's going on?
- A Walt Disney.

239
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:54,242
- It's frozen solid.
- Check the feed.

240
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,443
We may be having technical difficulty.

241
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:58,404
- The feed's good, Jack.
- Come on.

242
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:02,116
- Talk, Bruce, damn it.
- Get ready to pull the plug.

243
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:04,596
Come on, baby. Say something!

244
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,685
Bruce, talk.

245
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,205
- Hi, Susan.
- Thank you, God.

246
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:12,606
Bruce Nolan here,

247
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:16,123
aboard the Maid Of The Mist
in fabulous Niagara Falls, New York.

248
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:20,760
First, let me just add another
congratulations to Evan Backstabber.

249
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:22,997
Pardon me, Bastard... Baxter.

250
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:25,885
It is good to see what
someone with real talent can do

251
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,118
when great opportunities
are given to them instead of me.

252
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:33,439
Anyway, I'm here
with Katharine Hepburn's mom.

253
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:38,078
Why did you throw the Heart of the Ocean
jewel over the railing of the Titanic ?

254
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:41,082
Did you feel bad
letting Leo DiCaprio drown

255
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,476
while you were safe
floating on the door?

256
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,080
Could you have taken turns?

257
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:48,523
Or were you too afraid
to freeze your big fat ass off?

258
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:51,319
I guess that's how life is.

259
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:55,764
Some people are drenched, freezing
on a stupid boat with a stupid hat,

260
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:59,044
while others are in a news studio,
sucking up the glory.

261
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:01,118
Oh, well. No big deal.

262
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:05,837
The owner of the Maid Of The Mist.
Let's have a talk with him.

263
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:08,805
Come on in here, Bill.
No, let's have a talk.

264
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:10,798
What are you doing?

265
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,959
You've been running
the Maid Of The Mistfor 23 years.

266
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:16,083
Why do you think
I didn't get anchor?

267
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,601
- I don't want any problems.
- Is it my hair?

268
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,804
Are my teeth not white enough?
Or, like the great falls,

269
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:26,836
is the bedrock of my life
eroding beneath me?

270
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:28,599
Eroding!

271
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:32,077
Eroding!

272
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,087
- Cut the feed. Go to black.
- I'm on it.

273
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:41,441
I'm Bruce Nolan, for Eyewitness News.
Back to you, fuckers!

274
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:44,639
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, my God.

275
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,079
That is perfect.

276
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,965
That is the motivation that I needed!

277
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,117
Right there! Thank you!

278
00:16:57,527 --> 00:17:00,644
Thank you, WKBW.

279
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:04,037
Wimpy... Kitty Baby Whiners!

280
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:06,118
That's what that stands for!

281
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:09,962
I'll see you on Channel 5.

282
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:12,083
Where they do the real news!

283
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:15,318
Do I look blind to you?

284
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:20,443
Let's go, man. Come on.

285
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,964
What are you doing?

286
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:25,163
Come on. Leave the poor guy alone!

287
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,237
You OK, man?

288
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,358
Yeah, you better keep walking.

289
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:34,724
- What'd you say, ese ?
- Run, man!

290
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:36,798
Run!

291
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,803
Oh, God!

292
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:43,878
OK, I didn't mean it!

293
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:47,285
- I was just kidding!
- Hey, you forgot your things.

294
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:53,798
Say something now!

295
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,965
B-E-A...

296
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,356
..utiful.

297
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:09,155
That's what I get...

298
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:12,159
That's what I get
for trying to help someone.

299
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:16,442
Don't look at me, Walter.

300
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:18,518
Oh, no!

301
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,558
That's my payment, I guess.

302
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,956
That is my reward.

303
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:35,043
Just? Just get a clue!

304
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:37,879
Thank God you're all right.

305
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,083
God, yeah. Let's thank God.

306
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,806
For his blessings
are raining down upon me.

307
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,799
- Wait! That's not rain!
- Bruce, please don't do that.

308
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,401
Everything happens for a reason.

309
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:51,559
That I don't need. That is a cliché.
That is not helpful.

310
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:54,115
"A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush."

311
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:57,119
I have no bird! No bush!
God has taken my bird and my bush.

312
00:18:57,207 --> 00:19:00,244
I see. So God is picking on you?

313
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:02,636
No! He's ignoring me completely.

314
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:06,081
He's busy giving Evan
everything he wants.

315
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:10,204
Great, Sam. But you missed
your target. I'm over here!

316
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:12,562
Don't get mad at the dog.
It's not his fault.

317
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:15,764
It's God's fault.
He gave him the wrong co-ordinates.

318
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,281
Enough!
Will you stop being such a martyr?

319
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,801
I am not being a martyr! I'm a victim!

320
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:24,641
God is a mean kid with
a magniying glass, and I'm the ant.

321
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:26,843
He could fix my life if he wanted,

322
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:30,124
but he'd rather burn off my feelers
and watch me squirm.

323
00:19:30,207 --> 00:19:32,482
Sweetheart, I know you're mad.

324
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:35,957
What Evan did was slimy and wrong.

325
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:39,357
This day could have been so
much worse. I'm just glad you're OK.

326
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,798
OK? News flash! I'm not OK.

327
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:46,243
I'm not OK with a mediocre job!
Or a mediocre apartment!

328
00:19:46,327 --> 00:19:48,887
I'm not OK with a mediocre life!

329
00:19:57,047 --> 00:20:00,039
Is that what you think we have?
A mediocre life?

330
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,038
Don't make this about you.

331
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:05,563
About me?
How could I make this about me?

332
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:08,764
It's about you. It's always about you.

333
00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:11,077
Perfect.

334
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:15,445
I'll have the worst day of my life
with a side order of guilt, please!

335
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:24,317
OK, God. You want me to talk to you?

336
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:27,565
Then talk back.
Tell me what's going on.

337
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:30,445
What should I do? Give me a signal.

338
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:36,635
I need your guidance, Lord.
Please, send me a sign.

339
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,558
Oh, what's this joker doing now?

340
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:50,840
OK. All right. I'll try it your way.

341
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:56,317
All right. Lord... I need a miracle.

342
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,319
I'm desperate.

343
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:01,079
I need your help, Lord.

344
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,397
Please, reach into my life...

345
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:08,595
What the...? Where are you?

346
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:10,678
Got you!

347
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:53,406
Fine!

348
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:55,364
The gloves are off, pal!

349
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,802
Come on! Let me see a little wrath!

350
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:01,562
Smite me, O mighty smiter!

351
00:22:02,407 --> 00:22:04,716
You're the one who should be fired!

352
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:09,119
The only one around here
not doing his job is you!

353
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:12,118
Answer me!

354
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:28,518
Sorry. Don't know you.

355
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:31,478
Wouldn't call you if I did.

356
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,758
Oh, God!

357
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:54,481
Hello, 555 01 23.

358
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:21,846
Oh, no! Sam, this has got to stop!

359
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:27,842
Get it straight. That's the house.
This is the bathroom.

360
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:31,886
House, bathroom. Bathroom, house.

361
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:36,085
What's the point?

362
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:02,246
555 01 23.

363
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:07,525
Denied thatpromotion?
ls life unfair?

364
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:10,724
Is someone less talented than you
reaping the benefits?

365
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:12,365
Is yourname Bruce?

366
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:14,517
Then do we have thejob foryou!

367
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:17,838
We're located at 77256 23rd Street.

368
00:24:17,927 --> 00:24:21,237
So come on down -
or we'lljust keep beeping you.

369
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:39,046
"Omni Presents."

370
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:43,558
Oh, yeah. The glass is half-full.

371
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:49,959
Come on! Look! What is that?

372
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,720
Thank you again.

373
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:06,278
What the...?

374
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:15,078
You're looking for room 7.

375
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:20,484
- Yeah, I figured.
- Want me to even those up for you?

376
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:28,084
- How do I get to room 7?
- That'd be on the 7th floor.

377
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:31,637
- Stairs are over there.
- I'll take the elevator.

378
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:35,242
- Out of order.
- The stairs were my second choice.

379
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,921
Do you mind giving me a hand
with this floor?

380
00:25:38,007 --> 00:25:41,761
What? That's good.

381
00:25:41,847 --> 00:25:43,280
Are you serious?

382
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:48,087
I'm kind of busy. Rain check.

383
00:25:49,327 --> 00:25:51,079
I'll hold you to it.

384
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:54,281
I'm free on the 7th at 7.00.

385
00:25:57,447 --> 00:25:59,438
The 7th at 7.00 it is.

386
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:04,642
This looks promising.

387
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:11,598
Hello?

388
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:15,077
Another hugantic,
ginormic waste of my life.

389
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:18,238
Hello?

390
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:21,242
I'm looking for whoever runs this joint!

391
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:23,921
Be right with you. I'm fixing a light.

392
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:26,077
Tell me if it's working.

393
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,237
Yeah. Seems to be.

394
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:32,115
- Kind of bright, though.
- Yeah. It is for most people.

395
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:36,359
Spend their lives in the dark,
trying to hide from me.

396
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:40,037
The elevator's broken, huh?

397
00:26:40,127 --> 00:26:43,039
Yeah, but I'll get around to it.

398
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:47,962
- You installed a clapper?
- No, but catchy jingle, isn't it?

399
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:50,319
Clap on, clap off

400
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:53,399
The clapper

401
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:56,721
Just can't get it out of my head.

402
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:59,082
Well, good luck with that.

403
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,919
- I'm going to go now.
- OK.

404
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:03,202
But the boss will be right out.

405
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:15,005
You must be Bruce.
I've been expecting you.

406
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:18,959
This is hilarious.

407
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:21,686
You're the boss,
electrician and janitor.

408
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,678
Must be a killer Christmas party.

409
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,077
Don't get drunk, though.
One of you might need a ride home.

410
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:31,638
You always were funny, Bruce.
Just like your father.

411
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:35,160
He didn't mind
rolling up his sleeves either.

412
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:39,923
People underestimate the benefit of
manual labour. There's freedom in it.

413
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:44,046
Some of the happiest people smell to
high heaven at the end of the day.

414
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:47,083
All right, what is this?

415
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,085
How do you know my father
and how did you get my number?

416
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:51,885
I know a lot about you, Bruce.

417
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:55,636
Just about everything there is to know.

418
00:27:56,567 --> 00:28:01,197
Everything you've ever said or done
or thought about doing.

419
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:04,761
Right there in that file cabinet.

420
00:28:05,447 --> 00:28:08,883
- Wow! A whole drawer, just for me.
- Yeah.

421
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:11,356
Mind if I take a look?

422
00:28:11,447 --> 00:28:13,881
It's your life.

423
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:15,958
This oughta be good.

424
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:31,962
This last entry was a little disturbing.

425
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:45,683
"The gloves are off, God."

426
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,235
"God has taken my bird and my bush."

427
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,603
"God is a mean kid
with a magniying glass."

428
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:54,838
"Smite me, O mighty smiter."

429
00:28:54,927 --> 00:28:58,840
I'm not much for blaspheming,
but that last one made me laugh.

430
00:28:58,927 --> 00:29:00,918
Are you spying on me?

431
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:06,715
Who are you?

432
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:08,798
I am the One.

433
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:12,004
Creator of the heavens and the earth.
Alpha and Omega.

434
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:15,642
I see where this is going.

435
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:18,400
Bruce... I am God.

436
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:20,443
Bingo! Yahtzee!

437
00:29:20,527 --> 00:29:24,486
Is that your final answer?
Our survey says, "God!"

438
00:29:26,127 --> 00:29:27,879
It was nice to meet you, God.

439
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:31,437
Thanks for the Grand Canyon.
Good luck with the Apocalypse.

440
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:34,837
And by the way, you suck!

441
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:36,883
It would have been more impressive

442
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:39,925
if you hadn't used
the cheesy file cabinet illusion.

443
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:42,680
Anybody with a brain stem
can tell that drawer

444
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:45,361
is being fed through the wall
from the other side.

445
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:48,359
All you have to do
is find the crease right around here.

446
00:29:48,447 --> 00:29:51,723
There is a seam here, or a hollow spot.

447
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,158
Where?

448
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:00,238
Through the dry wall and concrete?

449
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:06,045
OK, that is a good one.

450
00:30:06,727 --> 00:30:11,005
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Thou shalt not tempt the Lord.

451
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:12,918
- If you can't do it...
- Three.

452
00:30:13,007 --> 00:30:14,998
Two... four... nine.

453
00:30:15,087 --> 00:30:16,839
Six... eight... one.

454
00:30:19,247 --> 00:30:20,646
OK.

455
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:23,204
How many now?

456
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:24,561
Seven.

457
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:33,036
- How?
- You've been complaining about me.

458
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:36,085
- I'm tired of it.
- Don't come near me. Seriously.

459
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,204
I don't want to hurt you,
but I will out of instinct.

460
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:42,996
You haven't won a fight since
grade 5, and that was against a girl.

461
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:47,240
But she was huge.
She'd been held back.

462
00:30:47,327 --> 00:30:49,397
And the sun was in your eyes.

463
00:30:49,487 --> 00:30:51,364
Ah, the ego.

464
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:54,007
Anyway, I brought you here
to offer you a job.

465
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:56,601
- A job? What job?
- My job.

466
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:59,884
You think you can do it better,
so here's your chance.

467
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:03,926
When you leave this building,
you will be endowed with all my powers.

468
00:31:04,847 --> 00:31:06,724
Sure. Whatever you say, pal.

469
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:13,476
OK. That did not happen.
No one needs to hear about it.

470
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:15,558
I'm deleting the program.

471
00:31:17,247 --> 00:31:18,885
No.

472
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:20,764
I'm having a breakdown.

473
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:24,317
Everyday psychotic episode,
caused by a tumour, a brain lesion.

474
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:27,118
Come on. Start!

475
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,078
That was lucky.

476
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,404
Come on. Calm down.

477
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:40,285
You did not meet God.
You do not have his powers.

478
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:43,282
If that was God, I'm Clint Eastwood.

479
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,358
Holy hell!

480
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:53,759
Be careful what you wish for, punk.

481
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:55,646
Nope!

482
00:31:57,007 --> 00:32:00,602
I am a reasonable,
sane human being.

483
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,439
With a .44 Magnum.

484
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:04,836
The most powerful handgun in the...

485
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:09,595
I'm not Clint Eastwood.
I'm Bruce Nolan.

486
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:11,678
I'm Bruce Nolan!

487
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:27,278
That was not real.

488
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,886
- Coffee?
- Coffee, yeah.

489
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:33,878
We have a special on soup today.

490
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:37,960
- No, thank you.
- It's tomato. I made it myself.

491
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:40,959
OK.

492
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:15,678
Excuse me, I need a spoo-...

493
00:33:22,607 --> 00:33:24,598
It's OK. I found one.

494
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:33,405
Here's your soup.

495
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:35,045
Oh, soup, right.

496
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:37,118
Yeah, right.

497
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:26,598
Having fun?

498
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,605
Thy, thou...

499
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:33,326
Come. Take a closer walk with me.

500
00:34:34,927 --> 00:34:37,077
- Let me explain the rules.
- Rules?

501
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:40,796
You left in such a rush,
I didn't get a chance to explain.

502
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:45,119
The two extra fingers
freaked me out a little.

503
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:47,562
I figured I'd get your attention.

504
00:34:47,647 --> 00:34:50,719
I did the same to Gandhi.
He didn't eat for three weeks.

505
00:34:51,807 --> 00:34:53,559
Anyway, here's the deal.

506
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:56,605
You have all my powers.
Use them any way you choose.

507
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:59,759
There are two rules.
You can't tell anybody you're God.

508
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:04,204
Believe me, you don't want the attention.
And you can't mess with free will.

509
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:10,838
- Can I ask why?
- Yes! You can!

510
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:12,918
That's the beauty of it.

511
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:23,841
- This is amazing.
- Speaking of amazing, excuse me.

512
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:29,959
Holy sh-... Cow.

513
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:33,200
Since you're through with these,
I'll keep them.

514
00:35:33,887 --> 00:35:36,196
Might come in handy some day.

515
00:35:36,847 --> 00:35:38,803
See you around, kid.

516
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:42,677
- Where are you going?
- I'm... taking a vacation.

517
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,485
God doesn't take vacations.

518
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:46,523
Does he? Do... ye?

519
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:49,277
Did you ever hear of the Dark Ages?

520
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:53,440
I'm covered. You can clear everything up
in five minutes if you want.

521
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:55,119
Right?

522
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:41,642
And he saw that it was good.

523
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:09,003
B-E-A-utiful!

524
00:37:14,127 --> 00:37:16,118
Check it out.

525
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:19,564
Look, it's the hero.

526
00:37:19,647 --> 00:37:22,445
- Whassup, homie?
- Yo, brethren, what up with thee?

527
00:37:23,647 --> 00:37:27,162
- Blessings on your alley.
- Want another can of whup ass?

528
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:30,398
- You didn't get enough?
- He wants some more!

529
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:34,446
Surely, I say unto you dudes,
I do not wish to fight.

530
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:38,520
So as soon as you apologise and make
a reckoning of your transgressions,

531
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:42,122
I shall absolve you and continue
along the path of righteousness.

532
00:37:42,647 --> 00:37:44,638
What are you talking about?

533
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:50,919
You talk kind of funny. I don't know
if you lost it up here or what.

534
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:54,079
You want me and the homies
to apologise? Cool.

535
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:58,718
We'll apologise the day a monkey
comes out of my butt. How about that?

536
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:05,199
What a coincidence!
Because that's today.

537
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,876
Did that monkey
just come out your crack?

538
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:32,923
This is some voodoo shit!

539
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:35,398
You guys leaving?

540
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,638
Don't forget your parting gifts!

541
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:07,247
Hey, little anal-dwelling butt monkey.

542
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:10,000
Time for you to go home.

543
00:39:22,687 --> 00:39:24,996
I am Bruce Almighty.

544
00:39:25,087 --> 00:39:27,840
My will be done!

545
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:40,645
What if God was one of us

546
00:39:41,407 --> 00:39:43,921
Just a slob like one of us

547
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:47,355
Just a stranger on a bus

548
00:39:47,447 --> 00:39:49,438
Trying to make his way

549
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:53,598
Home

550
00:39:53,687 --> 00:39:55,643
- My God.
- Call me Bruce.

551
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,843
What happened to you? You seem so...

552
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,920
happy.

553
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:06,567
Why shouldn't I be? On a night like this.

554
00:40:06,647 --> 00:40:09,400
Those are amazing. What are these?

555
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:12,923
A new breed. A cross-pollination
between tulips and daisies.

556
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:15,567
I call them todayzees.

557
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,158
OK.

558
00:40:24,847 --> 00:40:27,156
Honey, these flowers are beautiful.

559
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:30,640
- But last night...
- Last night, I was only human.

560
00:40:35,687 --> 00:40:37,678
Barry, help me out.

561
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:35,438
Honey? Hi.

562
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:39,557
- I've never seen the moon that big.
- Yeah.

563
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,238
We really shouldn't waste it.

564
00:41:52,447 --> 00:41:54,358
Bedroom?

565
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:56,438
Five minutes.

566
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:07,078
Let there be light.

567
00:42:10,247 --> 00:42:12,238
I'll be out in a minute!

568
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:14,639
Don't rush.

569
00:42:14,727 --> 00:42:17,639
Sometimes anticipation
can heighten the...

570
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,796
pleasure!

571
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:20,878
Oh, God.

572
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:25,446
It's a funny thing about pleasure.

573
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:30,806
It can be quite... pleasurable!

574
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:35,638
Oh, my God.

575
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,278
Pleasuring, pleasurable.

576
00:42:41,407 --> 00:42:42,760
Oh, good God!

577
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:53,958
In international news:

578
00:42:54,047 --> 00:42:58,086
Japanese reliefworkers are staging an
effort to rescue hundreds ofpeople

579
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:01,523
stranded by a freak tidal wave
that hit Kitamoto City.

580
00:43:01,607 --> 00:43:04,246
Scientists say the tsunami
may have been caused

581
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:08,320
by what they are describing
as unusual lunaractivity.

582
00:43:08,407 --> 00:43:10,398
More on this as it develops.

583
00:43:14,087 --> 00:43:18,717
Please bless my mommy, my daddy,
and especially my little sister.

584
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:23,963
Please help me, Lord.
Please get me through this one.

585
00:43:30,647 --> 00:43:33,639
Thank you foreverything else
in my life. Amen.

586
00:43:58,407 --> 00:44:00,557
Good boy.

587
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:04,158
Forget something?

588
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:10,040
Good boy! There are girls in the house.

589
00:44:14,247 --> 00:44:16,238
- Morning.
- Good morning.

590
00:44:16,327 --> 00:44:19,319
- I made you grilled cheese.
- My favi.

591
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:23,483
- Honey, last night was...
- Heavenly. I know.

592
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:27,958
I mean, I woke up and I felt like
my boobs were bigger.

593
00:44:28,047 --> 00:44:31,039
- Do they look bigger to you?
- What?

594
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,163
No.

595
00:44:33,247 --> 00:44:35,715
- Bigger?
- Oh, come on!

596
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:37,525
Look at them.

597
00:44:37,607 --> 00:44:39,757
Please. They are definitely bigger.

598
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:42,407
I mean, look. They feel huge to me.

599
00:44:42,487 --> 00:44:44,318
I have to go.

600
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:46,682
But this has been the breast bek...

601
00:44:48,807 --> 00:44:50,035
Thank you.

602
00:44:50,127 --> 00:44:53,563
- Where are you going?
- To get my job back.

603
00:44:54,807 --> 00:44:59,085
Yeah, yeah, I am great

604
00:45:02,487 --> 00:45:05,160
Good grief! ls that what I'm driving?

605
00:45:15,927 --> 00:45:17,519
Nice car, man.

606
00:45:17,607 --> 00:45:19,996
Yeah, it gets me from A to B.

607
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,844
Darn. All this horsepower
and no room to gallop!

608
00:45:39,287 --> 00:45:42,279
Hi-yo, Silver. Away!

609
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,924
I wouldn't want to be a fugitive

610
00:45:52,007 --> 00:45:55,886
with Hank, Buffalo's number one
police dog, on the job.

611
00:45:55,967 --> 00:46:00,438
Phil Sidleman at the police canine
training centre, Channel 5 News.

612
00:46:00,527 --> 00:46:02,518
And cut it.

613
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:09,400
Look what the cat coughed up!

614
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:12,365
Channel 7, right?
You're the guy that went crazy.

615
00:46:12,447 --> 00:46:15,598
- I had a bad moment.
- What are you doing here?

616
00:46:15,687 --> 00:46:17,803
- Looking for a story.
- No story here.

617
00:46:17,887 --> 00:46:22,244
This pond is all fished out.
Pretty standard stuff, anyway.

618
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:25,524
My instinct tells me
there's something more.

619
00:46:25,607 --> 00:46:28,599
Well, go with that.
It served you well in the past, right?

620
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,358
Hank found something!

621
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,038
We got a body!

622
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:44,998
Shit. Get the camera! Now!

623
00:46:45,767 --> 00:46:49,316
- It's locked! The keys are inside!
- I guess every dog has his day.

624
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:52,042
- Kid, you want to make $1 0?
- Sure.

625
00:46:52,127 --> 00:46:54,516
- Know how to use one of these?
- Duh.

626
00:46:56,407 --> 00:46:58,796
Seems to be in tune. Let's do this.

627
00:46:58,887 --> 00:47:01,879
The body of Jimmy Hoffa
was uncovered in a field today

628
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:05,004
outside a canine training centre
in Buffalo, New York.

629
00:47:05,087 --> 00:47:08,557
- Bruce Nolan was first on the scene.
- Thank you, Jane.

630
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:11,719
As you can see,
the body is being carefully exhumed

631
00:47:11,807 --> 00:47:16,164
for transportation to a facility
where DNA can confirm the identity.

632
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:19,125
That, however,
merely a formality at this point,

633
00:47:19,207 --> 00:47:24,679
as the body was found with a birth
certificate and dental records.

634
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:27,440
I'd call that a red-letter day
for any canine unit.

635
00:47:27,527 --> 00:47:30,121
But was that enough for Hank?
No, siree.

636
00:47:30,207 --> 00:47:33,438
Moments later, he busted
a local news camera crew

637
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:36,724
with 220 pounds of marijuana.

638
00:47:36,807 --> 00:47:39,162
I never saw it before! I swear!

639
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:44,323
I'm Bruce Nolan...

640
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:47,240
and that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

641
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:53,638
Did you like that?

642
00:47:55,967 --> 00:47:57,798
Thank you, thank you.

643
00:47:57,887 --> 00:47:59,798
- Hi, Bruce.
- Hi, Susan.

644
00:47:59,887 --> 00:48:02,321
Good work. I'm impressed.

645
00:48:06,287 --> 00:48:09,120
- Did you need me for something?
- Bruce!

646
00:48:09,207 --> 00:48:11,163
Just the man I want to see.

647
00:48:11,247 --> 00:48:15,320
- Hoffa? What are the odds of that?
- What are the odds of that?

648
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:17,477
- Bruce, why don't you sit down?
- OK.

649
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:21,196
I'm going to be straight with you.
We want you back, Bruce.

650
00:48:21,287 --> 00:48:24,677
But I want you to understand
it was not my decision to let you go.

651
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:28,279
- When the big guy gives the order...
- No harm, no foul.

652
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:31,882
I needed to reassess my goals
and get in touch with my true self.

653
00:48:31,967 --> 00:48:35,004
- You did that in a day?
- Imagine what I could do with seven.

654
00:48:36,127 --> 00:48:38,925
It is not in my power
to give you anchor.

655
00:48:39,007 --> 00:48:42,317
As far as field reporting goes,
if you're looking for a bump...

656
00:48:42,407 --> 00:48:45,444
Let's cut the crap
and get down to brass tacks.

657
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:51,925
I had you going.

658
00:48:52,007 --> 00:48:54,123
Don't worry about it,
my old friend.

659
00:48:55,047 --> 00:48:57,720
Just give me a camera.
I'll give you the news.

660
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:11,566
My secret is that I let the jalapenos
marinate in a spicy sauce

661
00:49:11,647 --> 00:49:15,720
for at least 24 hours
before I stir it into the chilli.

662
00:49:15,807 --> 00:49:18,526
Then I let it all come to a simmer.

663
00:49:23,207 --> 00:49:28,406
Hold that thought. It seems as if
an asteroid or meteorite

664
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:32,162
has just hit ground right outside
the Mark Twain Chilli Cook-Off!

665
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,401
This should certainly
spice things up a bit!

666
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:37,725
His stories are all over town.

667
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:39,081
From unearthing Hoffa

668
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:41,158
..to a meteor crashing,

669
00:49:41,247 --> 00:49:44,444
..Bruce Nolan is rapidly
becoming known as...

670
00:49:58,567 --> 00:50:02,037
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles!

671
00:50:06,487 --> 00:50:08,842
This was Bruce's idea?

672
00:50:08,927 --> 00:50:13,239
He wanted me to have a day of beauty
and luxurious serenity.

673
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:18,084
I got to tell you,
he is impressing me lately.

674
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:20,237
Know where he's taking me to dinner?

675
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,319
Where?

676
00:50:25,047 --> 00:50:26,605
The Blue Palm?

677
00:50:28,447 --> 00:50:31,359
- My gosh, I got chills.
- I know.

678
00:50:31,447 --> 00:50:35,156
He told me to prepare for the most
memorable night of our lives.

679
00:50:35,247 --> 00:50:37,886
Oh, my gosh. He's going to propose.

680
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:39,923
Oh, stop it. No. He's...

681
00:50:40,007 --> 00:50:42,680
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

682
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:45,759
Do the math.
He sends you all day to a beauty spa,

683
00:50:45,847 --> 00:50:49,726
he's taking you to a restaurant
where you had your first date. Hello!

684
00:50:49,807 --> 00:50:52,446
I never thought I'd say this,
but Bruce is right.

685
00:50:52,527 --> 00:50:54,722
This is your night.
Relax and enjoy it.

686
00:50:54,807 --> 00:50:56,843
Oh, God.

687
00:51:00,847 --> 00:51:04,203
Welcome to Eyewitness News at Six,
with Susan Ortega,

688
00:51:04,287 --> 00:51:05,640
Evan Baxter,

689
00:51:05,727 --> 00:51:08,400
Fred Donohue, sports,
Dallas Coleman, weather.

690
00:51:08,487 --> 00:51:10,762
And now,
Buffalo's numberone news team.

691
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:12,803
Welcome to Eyewitness News at Six.

692
00:51:12,887 --> 00:51:14,878
- I'm Susan Ortega.
- I'm Evan Baxter.

693
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:16,923
Here's what's making news.

694
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:20,238
A potential scandal
with the Buffalo PD surfaced today,

695
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,443
when the mayor demanded that...

696
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,756
When the mayor
demanded the chief of...

697
00:51:28,527 --> 00:51:30,518
Issued a response to...

698
00:51:31,247 --> 00:51:33,442
I seem to have something stuck in my...

699
00:51:33,527 --> 00:51:35,404
Get him some water.

700
00:51:35,487 --> 00:51:38,001
Looks like my new co-anchor
may need water.

701
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:44,678
There we go. Sorry.

702
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:49,522
In other news, the prime minister of
Sweden visited Washington today,

703
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,644
and my tiny little nipples
went to France.

704
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:55,603
What did he say? Check the prompter.

705
00:51:59,007 --> 00:52:01,726
- The prompter's fine.
- Evan, read the copy.

706
00:52:01,807 --> 00:52:03,525
The copy's good. Just read it.

707
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:07,802
The White House committee
greeted the prime rib roast minister,

708
00:52:07,887 --> 00:52:11,038
and I do the cha-cha like a sissy girl.

709
00:52:12,847 --> 00:52:15,486
I lika do...

710
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:17,558
da cha-cha.

711
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:25,196
I'm sorry. We seem to be
having technical difficulties.

712
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:27,364
In other news...

713
00:52:30,207 --> 00:52:32,198
My apologies.

714
00:53:22,007 --> 00:53:25,079
If I ruled the world

715
00:53:26,447 --> 00:53:30,486
Every day would be
the first day of spring

716
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:36,439
Every heart would have
a new song to sing

717
00:53:37,687 --> 00:53:43,284
And we'd sing of the joy
every morning would bring

718
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,156
If I ruled the world

719
00:53:49,367 --> 00:53:52,757
Every man would be
as free as a bird

720
00:53:52,847 --> 00:53:54,838
- May l?
- Certainly.

721
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:02,880
It's perfect. She'll love it.

722
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:06,755
We would treasure
each day that occurs

723
00:54:07,407 --> 00:54:13,084
You know, I was going to wait
until after the meal,

724
00:54:13,807 --> 00:54:17,356
but it'll burst out of me
like an alien if I don't do it now.

725
00:54:18,727 --> 00:54:20,763
Oh, my God. OK.

726
00:54:20,847 --> 00:54:22,565
This is it, isn't it?

727
00:54:22,647 --> 00:54:25,400
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

728
00:54:25,487 --> 00:54:30,197
I mean, I'm ready. I just didn't
know if I would... I'm sorry, go on.

729
00:54:30,287 --> 00:54:33,597
- I didn't know it was so important to you.
- Me neither.

730
00:54:37,487 --> 00:54:39,478
- Grace?
- Yes?

731
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:49,038
I got anchor.

732
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:51,166
No.

733
00:54:52,687 --> 00:54:56,726
Yes. Apparently it wasn't
working out with Evan,

734
00:54:56,807 --> 00:55:01,085
so he's going to finish out the week
and I go live on Monday.

735
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:06,721
- That's great, honey.
- I know, I know.

736
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:08,399
Well...

737
00:55:10,647 --> 00:55:13,400
- So that's what this is all about.
- Well, yeah.

738
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:16,280
We got anchor.

739
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:19,882
Jack's throwing me a party at
the Vanderbilt estate to celebrate.

740
00:55:19,967 --> 00:55:21,844
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

741
00:55:22,407 --> 00:55:25,558
Now I lay me down to sleep...

742
00:55:25,647 --> 00:55:27,524
I feel stupid.

743
00:55:27,607 --> 00:55:30,326
- It is loud in here, isn't it?
- No, it's not loud.

744
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:33,604
Jeez! Can you keep it down
to a dull roar?

745
00:55:33,687 --> 00:55:36,201
- Thank you!
- Is that supposed to be funny?

746
00:55:36,287 --> 00:55:38,960
Cos that is not funny.

747
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:42,403
- What did you say?
- What is wrong with you? Stop yelling.

748
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:47,599
If you'll excuse me,
I'll take a little trip to the...

749
00:55:47,687 --> 00:55:49,598
Ourfather, which art in heaven...

750
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:52,360
The wine is going right through me.

751
00:55:52,447 --> 00:55:55,564
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

752
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,763
- Keep going, Tony!
- Oh, God.

753
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:01,998
What is going on here?

754
00:56:02,087 --> 00:56:03,964
What is this?

755
00:56:04,047 --> 00:56:06,038
Give me a break!

756
00:56:10,847 --> 00:56:12,838
Really something, isn't it?

757
00:56:15,407 --> 00:56:17,204
Is this heaven?

758
00:56:17,287 --> 00:56:19,755
No, this is Mount Everest.

759
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:22,805
Flip on the Discovery Channel
from time to time.

760
00:56:23,207 --> 00:56:26,643
But I guess you can't now,
being dead and all.

761
00:56:27,807 --> 00:56:30,685
- I'm dead?
- I'm just messing with you.

762
00:56:31,127 --> 00:56:33,641
That's not funny, man!

763
00:56:35,647 --> 00:56:39,276
What about the voices in my head?
ls that part of the hilarity?

764
00:56:39,367 --> 00:56:43,565
No, those are prayers. You keep ignoring
them, they're going to build up.

765
00:56:43,647 --> 00:56:46,320
But it's just noise.
I can't understand them.

766
00:56:47,007 --> 00:56:49,646
You're not listening, son.

767
00:56:49,727 --> 00:56:52,002
Let's see.

768
00:56:52,087 --> 00:56:55,966
You had my powers for a little over a week.
How many people have you helped?

769
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:02,003
I took care of a few things.

770
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:05,204
I righted a few wrongs
in my own life first. OK?

771
00:57:05,287 --> 00:57:07,357
I was going to help the others.

772
00:57:07,447 --> 00:57:10,439
- I think I could help the world.
- The world?

773
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:15,558
That wasn't the world. That was just
Buffalo, between 57th and Commonwealth.

774
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:21,958
I didn't want to start you off with
more than you could handle.

775
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:25,323
You took the job, Bruce,
so I suggest you get to it.

776
00:57:26,887 --> 00:57:29,720
Seeing him smile
would make me so happy.

777
00:57:29,807 --> 00:57:31,798
Prayers, prayers, OK.

778
00:57:33,127 --> 00:57:35,163
This creepy whisper thing has to end.

779
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:37,317
Organisation. That's what I need.

780
00:57:37,407 --> 00:57:41,320
I need a system.
Something concrete. Concentrate.

781
00:57:42,447 --> 00:57:46,679
Files. Let all prayers
be organised into files.

782
00:57:51,287 --> 00:57:55,917
That takes care of the voices.
Not exactly a space-saver, though.

783
00:57:56,007 --> 00:57:58,316
Grace might notice.

784
00:57:58,407 --> 00:58:00,716
I know. Prayer Post-its!

785
00:58:15,127 --> 00:58:19,325
OK, I need something with a lock.
Security. Combination. A password.

786
00:58:20,687 --> 00:58:22,086
A password.

787
00:58:28,447 --> 00:58:31,439
Welcome to the revelation
superhighway.

788
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:34,439
We bless, no mess. Downloading now.

789
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,163
It's good.

790
00:58:42,087 --> 00:58:44,203
This is going to take a while.

791
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:54,398
1 ,527,503 prayer requests?

792
00:58:56,607 --> 00:58:58,598
I better manifest some coffee.

793
00:59:17,927 --> 00:59:21,715
Now that's fresh, mountain-grown
coffee from the hills of Colombia.

794
00:59:43,087 --> 00:59:45,203
Good.

795
00:59:49,007 --> 00:59:52,602
OK, I had to have made
some kind of a dent by now.

796
00:59:55,047 --> 00:59:57,038
Oh, come on!

797
00:59:58,407 --> 01:00:02,036
What a bunch of whiners.
This is going to suck up my whole life.

798
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:05,638
You know what?

799
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,678
Yes. To all.

800
01:00:10,647 --> 01:00:14,640
Yeah. There you go.
Now everybody's happy.

801
01:00:22,847 --> 01:00:26,601
I'll drink to that. My tech stocks
tripled in five days.

802
01:00:26,687 --> 01:00:28,803
Know something, Joe?
You seem taller.

803
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:31,447
- I am.
- My daughter pitched a no-hitter.

804
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,519
I lost 47 pounds
on the Krispy Kreme diet.

805
01:00:34,607 --> 01:00:36,120
There he is!

806
01:00:36,207 --> 01:00:37,845
The man of the hour!

807
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:41,522
Bless you! Bless all of you!

808
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:45,441
Be fruitful and...
do long division or something!

809
01:00:46,407 --> 01:00:48,796
Try that. It's an excellent year.

810
01:00:48,887 --> 01:00:51,355
Bruce!
Who do you like in the game tonight?

811
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:54,644
I like the Sabres. Coach prays a lot.

812
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:18,005
This is Bruce, Grace and Sam.
Leave a message.

813
01:01:18,087 --> 01:01:19,759
Grace? Are you there?

814
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:21,166
Hello? It's me.

815
01:01:24,287 --> 01:01:26,403
Come on, Grace. Come to the party.

816
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:29,323
I'll call you later, OK?

817
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:33,478
Come on, Sam.

818
01:01:36,207 --> 01:01:38,198
Help me out here.

819
01:01:40,527 --> 01:01:42,358
Sam, don't. Come on.

820
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:44,961
- Tell me.
- Ifl do, it might not come true.

821
01:01:45,047 --> 01:01:49,438
What is ityou want, Mary?
You want the moon?

822
01:01:49,527 --> 01:01:52,837
Say the word and I'll throw a lasso
around it andpull it down.

823
01:01:52,927 --> 01:01:56,636
H.ey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.

824
01:01:56,727 --> 01:01:58,638
I'll take it.

825
01:01:58,727 --> 01:02:01,400
- Then what?
- Then you could swallow it.

826
01:02:01,487 --> 01:02:03,603
And it'd all dissolve.

827
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:06,565
Moonbeams would shoot out
ofyourfingers and toes

828
01:02:06,647 --> 01:02:09,002
and the ends ofyourhair.

829
01:02:20,087 --> 01:02:22,078
This is Bruce, Grace and Sam.

830
01:02:23,847 --> 01:02:25,838
Hi, Bruce.

831
01:02:27,927 --> 01:02:29,918
What are you doing in here all alone?

832
01:02:30,007 --> 01:02:31,725
Oh, I was just going to...

833
01:02:31,807 --> 01:02:33,798
I mean...

834
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:38,761
I was going to give Grace a call.

835
01:02:39,087 --> 01:02:42,682
Yeah, I didn't see her.
So how are you and Grace doing?

836
01:02:43,687 --> 01:02:46,281
Well, actually, we had a bit of a fight.

837
01:02:46,967 --> 01:02:49,640
Kind of. I'm not sure if she's...

838
01:02:49,727 --> 01:02:51,797
You're on fire, Bruce.

839
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:53,879
Some women can't handle fire.

840
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:57,203
Some can.

841
01:02:57,287 --> 01:03:01,803
That's interesting, cos I never
thought we would ever talk...

842
01:03:21,527 --> 01:03:24,246
You might want to stop
touching me now.

843
01:03:28,327 --> 01:03:30,363
Grace, come here!

844
01:03:31,367 --> 01:03:33,358
This is weird. I was just calling you.

845
01:03:33,447 --> 01:03:35,836
And you thought Susan's mouth
was the phone?

846
01:03:36,727 --> 01:03:39,195
She kissed me. I'm the kissee.

847
01:03:39,287 --> 01:03:41,243
You were putting up a big fight.

848
01:03:41,327 --> 01:03:43,795
I tried to stop her,
but she's really strong.

849
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:46,447
OK, I screwed up.
Can I make it up to you?

850
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:49,200
Yeah. Why don't you get me a boat?

851
01:03:49,287 --> 01:03:50,959
- What?
- A big boat.

852
01:03:51,047 --> 01:03:52,924
And maybe two big bags of cash.

853
01:03:53,007 --> 01:03:54,884
Then, then, I'll be happy.

854
01:03:54,967 --> 01:03:56,878
Lots of money and lots of stuff!

855
01:03:56,967 --> 01:04:01,563
People want crap like getting married
or having babies with the man they love.

856
01:04:01,647 --> 01:04:04,036
But not me, Bruce.
Just give me the boat.

857
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,282
No wonder you stayed single!

858
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:11,360
- Don't do this.
- I'm not doing this. I'm undoing it.

859
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:15,042
I'll be at Debbie's. Take care of Sam
until I make arrangements.

860
01:04:16,767 --> 01:04:18,758
You can't leave me.

861
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:22,363
I'm the Alpha, lady!

862
01:04:22,447 --> 01:04:25,245
I'm the Omega, baby!

863
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:28,201
Fine! I don't need you!

864
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:38,199
What's the matter, Bruce?
She can't handle a little competition?

865
01:04:39,287 --> 01:04:41,562
Game's been called
on account of rain.

866
01:04:56,767 --> 01:05:00,726
An unusually high numberoflottery
winners has officials concerned.

867
01:05:00,807 --> 01:05:03,480
So far, 1, 100 winning tickets
have been turned in,

868
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:06,400
all, strangely, from the Buffalo area.

869
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:09,523
More on this story as it develops.

870
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:12,404
Enjoying your party?

871
01:05:12,487 --> 01:05:15,718
Nothing like spending quality time
with great friends.

872
01:05:17,407 --> 01:05:21,002
- Grace left me.
- Yeah, I know.

873
01:05:21,447 --> 01:05:23,438
She'll take me back.

874
01:05:26,207 --> 01:05:29,165
- She'll take me back, right?
- Would you take you back?

875
01:05:35,367 --> 01:05:39,485
How do you make somebody love you
without affecting free will?

876
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:41,558
Welcome to my world, son.

877
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:44,480
You come up with an answer
to that one, you let me know.

878
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:56,205
Rise and shine, Buffalo.

879
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:59,279
It's 70 and sunny and the perfect day
to forgive Bruce.

880
01:06:00,087 --> 01:06:02,078
I don't know much

881
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:06,836
But I know I love you

882
01:06:09,767 --> 01:06:11,758
- Bye.
- Have fun.

883
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:39,557
- Hi. Can I get a small coffee to go?
- Sure, hon. Just a sec.

884
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:44,323
K-Tel Records brings you the 100
greatest love songs ofall time.

885
01:06:44,407 --> 01:06:47,717
You'll hearsuch classics as

886
01:06:47,807 --> 01:06:51,163
"If You Can't Be With The One
You Love, Then Love Bruce",

887
01:06:51,247 --> 01:06:53,636
"Do That To Bruce One More Time".

888
01:06:53,767 --> 01:06:55,359
Who can forget that classic,

889
01:06:55,447 --> 01:06:58,519
"Bruce So H.orny
(H.e Love You Long Time)"?

890
01:06:58,607 --> 01:07:01,360
Order today and we'll throw in
at no extra charge

891
01:07:01,447 --> 01:07:03,563
the video "Sweatin' To Bruce".

892
01:07:03,647 --> 01:07:06,400
Just dial 1-900-FORGIVE H.IM.

893
01:07:06,487 --> 01:07:10,002
That's 1-900-FORGIVE H.IM. Do it now.

894
01:07:37,047 --> 01:07:40,119
No, no! Please don't put that
in your mouth.

895
01:07:40,207 --> 01:07:41,526
That's not food.

896
01:07:41,607 --> 01:07:45,680
Go to the bathroom. Wash out your mouth.
Wash off your hands.

897
01:07:46,087 --> 01:07:48,442
That kid is gonna poop an ornament.

898
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:51,485
One more time,
you're going to be in a lot of trouble.

899
01:07:52,887 --> 01:07:54,878
All right, that's it!

900
01:07:57,887 --> 01:08:00,242
I surrender!

901
01:08:05,367 --> 01:08:07,358
Hi.

902
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:13,959
I'm... doing my first anchor tonight.

903
01:08:14,047 --> 01:08:16,845
Oh, wow. That's great!

904
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:20,681
- How have you been doing?
- Good.

905
01:08:22,287 --> 01:08:25,597
- Debbie won the lottery.
- Oh, yeah? You're kidding.

906
01:08:25,687 --> 01:08:31,796
But so did 400,000 other people,
so she only won like $1 7 or something.

907
01:08:33,767 --> 01:08:35,758
I miss you.

908
01:08:40,567 --> 01:08:42,239
I took a first step.

909
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,318
Jumped out on a ledge.

910
01:08:46,047 --> 01:08:48,845
- Feeling vulnerable.
- What do you want me to say?

911
01:08:48,927 --> 01:08:51,043
Say you want me back.

912
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,357
What about all the signs?

913
01:08:53,647 --> 01:08:57,606
How did you know about that?
Did you talk to Debbie?

914
01:08:57,687 --> 01:09:00,645
Would it help if I just said
I was a complete ass?

915
01:09:00,727 --> 01:09:04,163
- You said ass!
- It's OK if I'm talking about a donkey.

916
01:09:04,247 --> 01:09:06,636
I didn't say "hole". If I said ass...

917
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:09,446
No, wait. OK, honey, let's go inside.

918
01:09:09,527 --> 01:09:12,439
All right, everybody inside.
Time to go inside.

919
01:09:14,687 --> 01:09:17,440
Please. None of this
seems right without you.

920
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,477
I gotta go.

921
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:25,565
Wait!

922
01:09:31,647 --> 01:09:34,081
How do you feel now?

923
01:09:36,247 --> 01:09:38,966
Have you completely lost your mind?

924
01:09:39,327 --> 01:09:42,637
- Are you drunk?
- Yeah. Drunk with power.

925
01:09:47,607 --> 01:09:49,245
Love me.

926
01:09:56,287 --> 01:09:58,278
I did.

927
01:10:09,807 --> 01:10:11,798
Yeah, I know. Free will.

928
01:10:13,087 --> 01:10:17,399
More poweroutages reported today
caused by last week's meteorite strike.

929
01:10:17,487 --> 01:10:23,437
Officials are trying to repair transformers
damaged by the ensuing electrical surge.

930
01:10:23,527 --> 01:10:25,358
The scene nearly turned violent

931
01:10:25,447 --> 01:10:30,202
when Buffalo residents protested
last week's lottery results.

932
01:10:30,287 --> 01:10:33,916
Doomsayers are pointing to
last week's strange celestial events

933
01:10:34,007 --> 01:10:39,127
as signs thatprophecy is being fulfilled
and the world may be coming to an end.

934
01:10:40,727 --> 01:10:42,080
The world's gone mad.

935
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:44,044
- 30 seconds to air.
- OK.

936
01:10:44,127 --> 01:10:46,925
There you are. It's your debut.
How are you feeling?

937
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:50,044
You know what? I'm fine. Never better.

938
01:10:50,607 --> 01:10:52,598
The show must go on right?

939
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:58,764
-The Sabres just won the Stanley Cup.
- You're kidding me!

940
01:10:59,367 --> 01:11:01,961
Was that tonight? That's great.

941
01:11:02,047 --> 01:11:06,359
It's crazy out there. We're going to
kick live to Fred at the stadium, OK?

942
01:11:06,447 --> 01:11:08,836
- Five seconds to the open.
- This is it.

943
01:11:08,927 --> 01:11:10,838
- You ready?
- Born that way.

944
01:11:10,927 --> 01:11:16,206
Welcome to Eyewitness News at Six,
with Susan Ortega, Bruce Nolan,

945
01:11:16,287 --> 01:11:18,926
Fred Donohue, sports,
Dallas Coleman, weather.

946
01:11:19,007 --> 01:11:20,918
Now Buffalo's numberone news team.

947
01:11:21,007 --> 01:11:22,998
- I'm Susan Ortega.
- I'm Bruce Nolan.

948
01:11:23,087 --> 01:11:25,078
And here's what's making news.

949
01:11:26,327 --> 01:11:28,795
- What happened?
- We lost power.

950
01:11:28,887 --> 01:11:30,878
- Transformer's down again.
- Jeez.

951
01:11:30,967 --> 01:11:33,401
Ever since that damn meteorite hit.

952
01:11:34,927 --> 01:11:37,680
- We're back.
- We apologise for the interruption.

953
01:11:37,767 --> 01:11:39,883
- Back to the news. Bruce?
- Thank you.

954
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:42,925
I'm sorry. We're going live
to HSBC Arena,

955
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:45,999
where the Buffalo Sabres
have won the Stanley Cup.

956
01:11:46,087 --> 01:11:47,406
- Great.
- Fred?

957
01:11:47,487 --> 01:11:50,047
We're about to uncork
some champagne because

958
01:11:50,127 --> 01:11:54,678
the Sabres have won
their first championship in 22 years!

959
01:11:57,087 --> 01:11:58,440
What in blazes...

960
01:11:58,527 --> 01:12:03,043
We'll be back with the Sabres'
victory in just a hot second.

961
01:12:03,127 --> 01:12:04,879
In other news...

962
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:07,435
- Bloody hell!
- What is it now?

963
01:12:07,527 --> 01:12:09,518
- The whole booth is down.
- It's not!

964
01:12:10,087 --> 01:12:15,320
In other news, fighting erupted
in the Gaza Strip today,

965
01:12:15,407 --> 01:12:17,443
as lsraelis and Palestinians...

966
01:12:17,527 --> 01:12:18,880
- Bruce.
- What?

967
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:22,164
We've got a situation here.
They're rioting right outside.

968
01:12:22,247 --> 01:12:24,966
- You're kidding.
- The whole town has gone crazy.

969
01:12:29,807 --> 01:12:31,684
Go on, Bruce. Say something.

970
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:36,004
Ladies and gentlemen, this just in.

971
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:41,960
Possibly the biggest breaking news
story this town has ever seen.

972
01:12:48,887 --> 01:12:50,878
And I gotta go.

973
01:12:51,687 --> 01:12:53,678
Sorry, Jack.

974
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:56,522
Susan, it's all yours.

975
01:12:59,727 --> 01:13:01,797
Sabres!

976
01:13:01,887 --> 01:13:04,037
Sabres rule!

977
01:13:04,127 --> 01:13:06,436
Down with the lottery!

978
01:13:06,527 --> 01:13:08,677
Repent! The end is near!

979
01:13:22,327 --> 01:13:24,158
The lottery sucks!

980
01:13:24,527 --> 01:13:26,438
I only won 1 7 bucks!

981
01:13:28,647 --> 01:13:30,638
Channel 7 lies!

982
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:34,244
Oh, no!

983
01:13:45,647 --> 01:13:48,161
God!

984
01:13:50,247 --> 01:13:52,238
God?

985
01:13:53,007 --> 01:13:54,998
Are you here?

986
01:13:57,607 --> 01:14:00,121
Hello? I need your help!

987
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:03,360
Clap on!

988
01:14:10,927 --> 01:14:12,918
Figures!

989
01:14:15,927 --> 01:14:18,395
Well, hello there, Bruce Almighty.

990
01:14:21,447 --> 01:14:25,201
Not as easy as it looks, is it, son?
This God business.

991
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:28,635
They're all out of control.

992
01:14:28,727 --> 01:14:30,797
It's me. I don't know what to do.

993
01:14:31,327 --> 01:14:33,795
Well, you're right on time.
Seven o'clock.

994
01:14:37,047 --> 01:14:39,038
The 7th at 7.00.

995
01:14:53,047 --> 01:14:55,038
All righty, then.

996
01:14:57,327 --> 01:15:00,160
- There we are.
- It's good.

997
01:15:02,367 --> 01:15:03,925
It's a wonderful thing.

998
01:15:04,007 --> 01:15:08,797
No matter how filthy something gets,
you can always clean it right up.

999
01:15:09,687 --> 01:15:12,997
There were so many.
I just gave them all what they wanted.

1000
01:15:13,087 --> 01:15:14,679
Yeah.

1001
01:15:15,247 --> 01:15:18,557
But since when does anyone
have a clue about what they want?

1002
01:15:21,407 --> 01:15:23,796
So what do I do?

1003
01:15:26,327 --> 01:15:30,445
Parting your soup is not a miracle.
It's a magic trick.

1004
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:33,675
A single mom who's working two jobs

1005
01:15:33,767 --> 01:15:37,646
and still finds time to take her kid
to soccer practice, that's a miracle.

1006
01:15:38,047 --> 01:15:41,357
A teenager who says no to drugs
and yes to an education,

1007
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,198
that's a miracle.

1008
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:47,242
People want me to do everything for them.

1009
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:50,285
What they don't realise
is they have the power.

1010
01:15:51,567 --> 01:15:54,161
You want to see a miracle, son?

1011
01:15:54,247 --> 01:15:56,238
Be the miracle.

1012
01:15:59,447 --> 01:16:01,438
Wait. Are you leaving?

1013
01:16:02,087 --> 01:16:04,760
Yeah. I figure you can handle things now.

1014
01:16:04,847 --> 01:16:07,520
But what if I need you?
What if I have questions?

1015
01:16:07,607 --> 01:16:09,916
That's your problem, Bruce.

1016
01:16:10,007 --> 01:16:11,963
That's everybody's problem.

1017
01:16:12,047 --> 01:16:14,038
You keep looking up.

1018
01:16:17,727 --> 01:16:21,766
Orderhas been restored
after this evening's downtown riot.

1019
01:16:21,847 --> 01:16:24,520
State officials
have suspended all lottery sales

1020
01:16:24,607 --> 01:16:26,563
pending furtherinvestigation.

1021
01:16:26,647 --> 01:16:31,118
No injuries were reported in the melee,
however there were dozens ofarrests.

1022
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:18,759
OK.

1023
01:17:20,047 --> 01:17:21,958
- Thanks a million.
- Not a problem.

1024
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:24,038
God bless.

1025
01:17:28,567 --> 01:17:32,560
Bruce giveth and Bruce... taketh away.

1026
01:17:32,647 --> 01:17:35,207
If you don't like it... mega-bite me.

1027
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,517
- Evan?
- Bruce.

1028
01:17:48,487 --> 01:17:53,356
I suppose you're here to gloat about
the anchor position. Go ahead.

1029
01:17:53,447 --> 01:17:55,438
Well, actually, l...

1030
01:17:56,647 --> 01:17:59,844
I just came to tell you
that I've been a royal prick.

1031
01:17:59,927 --> 01:18:02,646
The anchor position is yours.
I turned down the job.

1032
01:18:03,487 --> 01:18:05,796
And I never really congratulated you.

1033
01:18:07,487 --> 01:18:09,478
Congratulations.

1034
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,245
Thanks, Bruce.

1035
01:18:13,327 --> 01:18:16,205
In the financial world,
things are back to normal

1036
01:18:16,287 --> 01:18:19,359
in what analysts are calling
a fluke market fluctuation.

1037
01:18:19,447 --> 01:18:22,007
- You made the right move.
- What about you?

1038
01:18:22,087 --> 01:18:24,203
You ready to go back out there?

1039
01:18:25,207 --> 01:18:27,926
Do the cutesy stuff?
The lighter side of the news?

1040
01:18:28,007 --> 01:18:31,682
Lower and debase myself
for the amusement of strangers?

1041
01:18:31,767 --> 01:18:34,042
Yeah, I could do that.
Sounds like fun.

1042
01:18:34,127 --> 01:18:35,685
Good.

1043
01:18:36,367 --> 01:18:39,598
OK, Sammy, let's do it right.
Like all the other dogs.

1044
01:18:39,687 --> 01:18:43,202
I don't want to make you feel bad,
but they're laughing at you, pal.

1045
01:18:43,287 --> 01:18:45,403
Come on. Concentrate.

1046
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:47,637
Pump it out, if you have to.

1047
01:18:47,727 --> 01:18:50,116
What am I going to do with you?

1048
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:55,125
I know this seems kind of crazy,

1049
01:18:55,207 --> 01:18:59,166
but desperate times
call for desperate measures.

1050
01:19:01,407 --> 01:19:04,001
OK, Sammy. Do your thing.

1051
01:19:04,847 --> 01:19:07,805
That's it. Good boy!

1052
01:19:10,007 --> 01:19:11,725
Training my dog.

1053
01:19:30,607 --> 01:19:33,679
Yes! We did it!

1054
01:19:36,207 --> 01:19:39,438
We're doing it doggy style

1055
01:19:40,767 --> 01:19:42,962
I'll alert Penthouse Forum.

1056
01:19:43,047 --> 01:19:45,038
Hi, Deb. How are you?

1057
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:47,166
How's Grace?

1058
01:19:47,247 --> 01:19:49,966
I didn't come to chat.
I came for Grace's stuff.

1059
01:19:56,127 --> 01:19:58,846
- You need a...?
- That's OK. I've got it.

1060
01:20:05,727 --> 01:20:07,558
I don't know if she...

1061
01:20:07,647 --> 01:20:10,036
I don't know
if she wants that or not.

1062
01:20:13,887 --> 01:20:16,879
This is full. You did all this?

1063
01:20:27,287 --> 01:20:29,596
You know what I do before I go to bed?

1064
01:20:29,687 --> 01:20:33,362
I tuck my kids in, maybe have
some ice cream and watch Conan.

1065
01:20:35,127 --> 01:20:37,118
Know what Grace does?

1066
01:20:38,287 --> 01:20:40,278
She prays.

1067
01:20:41,407 --> 01:20:43,159
Most of the time for you.

1068
01:21:04,247 --> 01:21:07,478
Find Grace Connelly.

1069
01:21:10,207 --> 01:21:12,198
The woman does pray a lot.

1070
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:16,761
Find... Grace and Bruce.

1071
01:21:17,887 --> 01:21:20,196
"Dear God,
please help Bruce find himself,

1072
01:21:20,287 --> 01:21:22,243
find contentment, find you."

1073
01:21:22,327 --> 01:21:25,763
"Dear God, please help Bruce.
He seems to be struggling."

1074
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:27,803
"Dear God, give Bruce strength."

1075
01:21:27,887 --> 01:21:29,605
"Dear God, bless Bruce."

1076
01:21:34,287 --> 01:21:36,118
It's her.

1077
01:21:36,687 --> 01:21:39,838
Sammy, she's logging on.
She's praying right now.

1078
01:21:46,847 --> 01:21:48,565
Please, God.

1079
01:21:50,127 --> 01:21:51,446
Please.

1080
01:21:51,527 --> 01:21:53,483
I still love him.

1081
01:21:55,807 --> 01:21:58,685
But I don't want to love him any more.

1082
01:21:58,767 --> 01:22:01,156
I don't want to hurt any more. Please.

1083
01:22:01,767 --> 01:22:03,758
Help me forget.

1084
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:06,478
Please help me to let it go.

1085
01:22:07,607 --> 01:22:09,837
Please help me let him go.

1086
01:22:30,087 --> 01:22:32,078
You win!

1087
01:22:32,767 --> 01:22:34,564
I'm done!

1088
01:22:34,647 --> 01:22:38,322
Please! I don't want to do this any more!

1089
01:22:39,247 --> 01:22:41,238
I don't want to be God.

1090
01:22:41,847 --> 01:22:45,203
I want you to decide
what's right for me!

1091
01:22:45,287 --> 01:22:48,006
I surrender to your will!

1092
01:23:17,047 --> 01:23:18,366
Am l...?

1093
01:23:18,447 --> 01:23:22,281
You can't kneel down in the middle
of a highway and live to talk about it.

1094
01:23:22,367 --> 01:23:24,358
But why?

1095
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:27,159
Why now?

1096
01:23:27,247 --> 01:23:28,839
Bruce...

1097
01:23:29,727 --> 01:23:32,446
you have the divine spark.

1098
01:23:32,527 --> 01:23:36,315
You have the gift for bringing joy
and laughter to the world.

1099
01:23:37,407 --> 01:23:39,398
I know. I created you.

1100
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:43,042
- Quit bragging.
- See?

1101
01:23:43,127 --> 01:23:45,322
That's what I'm talking about.

1102
01:23:45,407 --> 01:23:47,398
That's the spark.

1103
01:23:52,047 --> 01:23:54,163
What do you want me to do?

1104
01:23:55,127 --> 01:23:56,958
I want you to pray, son.

1105
01:23:57,447 --> 01:24:00,564
Go ahead. Use them.

1106
01:24:06,127 --> 01:24:09,164
Lord, feed the hungry.

1107
01:24:09,247 --> 01:24:12,523
And bring peace to...

1108
01:24:13,967 --> 01:24:15,958
all of mankind.

1109
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:20,122
- How's that?
- Great.

1110
01:24:20,207 --> 01:24:22,880
If you want to be Miss America.

1111
01:24:22,967 --> 01:24:26,403
Now, come on.
What do you really care about?

1112
01:24:30,727 --> 01:24:33,002
Grace.

1113
01:24:35,767 --> 01:24:37,758
You want her back?

1114
01:24:42,007 --> 01:24:43,998
No.

1115
01:24:45,087 --> 01:24:47,078
I want her to be happy.

1116
01:24:49,327 --> 01:24:51,682
No matter what that means.

1117
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:53,962
I want her to find someone

1118
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:56,038
who'll treat her

1119
01:24:56,927 --> 01:25:01,523
with all the love she deserved from me.

1120
01:25:04,047 --> 01:25:06,038
I want her to meet someone

1121
01:25:11,127 --> 01:25:13,118
who'll see her always

1122
01:25:14,247 --> 01:25:16,238
as I do now.

1123
01:25:20,687 --> 01:25:22,803
Through your eyes.

1124
01:25:23,407 --> 01:25:26,080
- Now that's a prayer.
- Yeah?

1125
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:30,437
Yeah. It's good.

1126
01:25:35,447 --> 01:25:37,563
I'm going to get right on it.

1127
01:25:38,367 --> 01:25:40,244
Clear!

1128
01:25:40,327 --> 01:25:42,682
That didn't feel very good.

1129
01:25:43,607 --> 01:25:46,360
- Got a rhythm.
- I got a pulse.

1130
01:25:46,447 --> 01:25:49,405
- Let's get him up.
- Get the backboard and brace.

1131
01:25:59,607 --> 01:26:01,563
Welcome back.

1132
01:26:01,647 --> 01:26:03,763
You're lucky to be alive, son.

1133
01:26:03,847 --> 01:26:05,838
Someone up there must like you.

1134
01:26:20,527 --> 01:26:24,645
I hear all that stuff winds up
in a warehouse somewhere.

1135
01:26:30,207 --> 01:26:32,198
Hi, baby.

1136
01:26:33,967 --> 01:26:37,516
Oh, my God, look at you.

1137
01:26:37,927 --> 01:26:40,885
- I was such an idiot.
- It's OK.

1138
01:26:47,927 --> 01:26:50,680
I don't know what I would have done.

1139
01:26:51,487 --> 01:26:55,878
Oh, God. I swear I wanted
to be mad at you forever.

1140
01:27:07,327 --> 01:27:09,318
Now you're just showing off.

1141
01:27:20,367 --> 01:27:24,246
This is Bruce Nolan here at Buffalo's
first "Be the Miracle" blood drive.

1142
01:27:24,327 --> 01:27:27,125
It's a B-E-A-utiful day.

1143
01:27:27,207 --> 01:27:30,483
So come on down,
because the life you save could be mine.

1144
01:27:30,887 --> 01:27:35,642
Let's go over here. The Kowolskis have
baked a cookie just for this occasion.

1145
01:27:35,727 --> 01:27:38,719
Sure it's a creepy and a shameless plug,
but we love 'em.

1146
01:27:38,807 --> 01:27:40,923
Thank you, Mama. Vol - finger, nose.

1147
01:27:42,887 --> 01:27:45,117
I will have given blood
twice this week.

1148
01:27:45,207 --> 01:27:47,402
For those of you who haven't heard,

1149
01:27:47,487 --> 01:27:50,957
I'd like to introduce you
to the future Mrs Exclusive.

1150
01:27:51,047 --> 01:27:54,084
Grace Connelly. There she is.

1151
01:27:54,167 --> 01:27:57,477
Look at her! lsn't she beautiful?

1152
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:02,520
She just gave blood and she still
has enough left to fill up her face.

1153
01:28:02,607 --> 01:28:06,361
Yes, behind every great man,
there's a woman rolling her eyes, folks.

1154
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:10,838
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness News
reminding you to...

1155
01:28:10,927 --> 01:28:13,760
Be the miracle!

1156
01:28:14,647 --> 01:28:16,080
You heard 'em.

1157
01:28:16,167 --> 01:28:19,318
- OK, cut it. Thank you, Bruce.
- Thanks, Ally.

1158
01:28:22,527 --> 01:28:25,837
- How was that?
- Great. That was really great.

1159
01:28:25,927 --> 01:28:28,236
Now go over there.
The nurse is waiting.

1160
01:28:28,327 --> 01:28:30,522
- Do I have to?
- Oh, it's not going to hurt.

1161
01:28:30,607 --> 01:28:32,996
In fact, I think you'll find it pleasurable.

1162
01:28:33,367 --> 01:28:35,085
Baby.

1163
01:29:29,887 --> 01:29:34,802
Who can take a rainbow,
wrap it in a sock

1164
01:29:34,887 --> 01:29:40,041
Soak it in the sun
and make a groovy lemon pie?

1165
01:29:45,767 --> 01:29:47,803
Oh, Jesus.

1166
01:29:49,047 --> 01:29:50,162
I'm sorry.

1167
01:29:50,247 --> 01:29:54,126
I'm a very rare blood type. I'm AB positive.

1168
01:29:55,007 --> 01:29:56,998
Sounds delicious.

1169
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:02,480
Well, there are storehouses
all over the world

1170
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:05,957
with tons of stuff on ice, and...

1171
01:30:06,807 --> 01:30:09,446
- Sorry.
- You were like this. Sorry, go on.

1172
01:30:11,207 --> 01:30:13,402
Positive, IB positive... Sorry.

1173
01:30:13,487 --> 01:30:15,478
I have a rary...

1174
01:30:17,047 --> 01:30:19,038
She has a rary!

1175
01:30:19,127 --> 01:30:21,482
I have a very rare blood type.

1176
01:30:21,567 --> 01:30:23,125
I'm AB negative.

1177
01:30:23,207 --> 01:30:25,198
- I'm IB positive.
- Am I AB negative?

1178
01:30:25,287 --> 01:30:27,323
I don't know what you are any more.

1179
01:30:27,767 --> 01:30:31,476
I'm going to need a frickin' miracle
to get to work on time.

1180
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:55,044
That'll work.

1181
01:30:55,127 --> 01:30:58,961
Other stories in the...

1182
01:31:02,647 --> 01:31:05,957
The prime minister of Sweden
visited Washington today,

1183
01:31:06,047 --> 01:31:09,357
and in other...

1184
01:31:10,927 --> 01:31:12,963
In other...

1185
01:31:14,167 --> 01:31:16,158
In other news...

1186
01:31:20,127 --> 01:31:22,516
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness No...

1187
01:31:24,967 --> 01:31:26,958
Eyewitness Nose.

1188
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:29,598
And clear!

1189
01:31:30,087 --> 01:31:32,078
Be the miracle!

1190
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:34,158
That's right!
