00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,524
(drumroll)

00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:12,879
(rousing orchestral
fanfare playing)

3
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,425
(fanfare ends)

4
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:39,708
# Well, the healing has begun #

5
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:50,509
# I want you to put on
your pretty summer dress, yeah #

6
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,160
# You can wear
your Easter clothes #

7

# Sunday bonnet

00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,454
# Well, the healing

00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:54,395
# Oh, yeah, la-la #

00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:00,407
# Hmm-mm... #

26
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:04,343
- Hold that will you?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:06,445
Thanks.

28
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:20,058
(breathing heavily)

29
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:28,938
Anton, fucking hell, man.

30
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:31,275
- Come on, give me that.

31
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,110
Give me the case.

32
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,711
What are you fucking at, man?

33
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:37,766
For fuck's sake.

34
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,616

35
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:40,985

00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:49,128
- Oh, fuck.

39
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,164
I'm just dying

40
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,929
Look, there's 20 cent.
Look it.

41
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:57,404
Look, don't fucking rob me.

42
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm down there trying to fucking

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,344

00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:05,781

You're rapid, you are.

46
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,549
You want money, just fucking,
just ask me for it.

47
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:09,986
Don't have me chase you all
the way up the street for it.

48
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:14,408
Want to give us that
fiver then, do ya?

49
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:18,678
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Here.

50
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:20,231
How's your ma?

51
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,317
She's dead, man.

52
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:23,567
Well, how's your old fella?

53
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:26,183
Fair play to ya, right?

54
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:28,374

55
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,176
Look, there's two euros, look.

56
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,577
Fair play to ya, right?

57
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:33,683
See you, good luck, man.

58
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:38,188
(acoustic guitar playing)

59
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:02,471
# Scratching
at the surface now #

60
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:09,285
# And I'm trying hard
to work it out #

61
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:16,523
# And so much has gone
misunderstood #

62
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:23,567
# And this mystery
only leads to doubt #

63
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:29,843
# And I didn't understand #

64
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:36,814
# When you reached out
to take my hand #

65
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:43,794
# And if you have
something to say#

66
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:50,119
# You'd better say it now #

67
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:54,074
# 'Cause this is
what you've waited for#

68
00:04:56,842 --> 00:05:00,647
# Your chance to even up
the score #

69
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,100
# And as these shadows fall #

70
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,912
# On me now I'll win somehow #

71
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,415
# Yeah #

72
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:22,488
# 'Cause I'm picking up
a message, Lord #

73
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:29,062
# That I'm closer
than I've ever been before #

74
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,301
# So if you have something
to say #

75
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,118
# Say it to me now#

76
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:43,695
# Just say it to me now, now #

77
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:51,023
# Oh, oh #

78
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:54,122
# 0h #

79
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:56,211
# 0h. #

80
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,893
(muffled clapping)

81
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:12,564
Thanks.

82
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,382
Ten cents
brilliant. Thanks.

83
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:17,202
Excuse me?

84
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:19,398
Sorry.

85
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:22,375
<i>Big Issue?</i>

86
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,794
Can't afford it.

87
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:28,361
This song you just play,
you write it?

88
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,017
Working on it.

89
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,919
It's not an established song?

90
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,289
No, it's not an
established song.

91
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:35,624
How come you don't play it

92
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:36,758
during daytime?

93
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:38,260
I see you every day.

94
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,263
You know, during the day, people
want to hear songs they know,

95
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:42,798
just songs that they recognize.

96
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:44,401
I mean, otherwise,
I wouldn't make any money.

97
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:46,236
I play these songs at night.
They wouldn't listen.

98
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,288
I listen.

99
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:51,091
Yeah, but you gave me ten cents.

100
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:53,358
You do it
for money then?

101
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,745
Why don't you
get a job

102
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:55,980
in a shop?

103
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,097
I have a job in a shop.

104
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:01,286
Listen, I'm going to get
back to this, yeah?

105
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,489
Nice to meet you.

106
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,823
Who'd you write that song
for, please?

107
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,360
No one.

108
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,748
Bullshit.

109
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:15,270
Where is she?

110
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,758
She's gone.

111
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:20,676
She's dead?

112
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:24,130
No, she's not dead, she's gone.

113
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,915
You love her still?

114
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:28,144
Jesus, man.

115
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:31,656
(inaudible)

116
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:34,474
You're over her.

117
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:35,693
Rubbish.

118
00:07:35,793 --> 00:07:37,829
No one who would write
this song is over her.

119
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:39,531
I'm telling you.

120
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:42,434
You play this marvelous song
to her, you get her back.

121
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:44,503
I don't want her back.

122
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:47,391
I see.

123
00:07:47,491 --> 00:07:50,361
What shop you work in?

124
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:52,279
I work in a Hoover repair shop.

125
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,614
A Hoover?

126
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:56,284
You know, like a vacuum cleaner.
Whhzzz.

127
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:58,534
You fix vacuum cleaners?

128
00:07:58,634 --> 00:07:59,655
I do.

129
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:02,676
I have a broken vacuum cleaner.

130
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,460
- You fix it for me?
- Yeah.

131
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,229
I bring it tomorrow then?

132
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:07,163
Okay.

133
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:08,197
This is great.

134
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:09,198
Tomorrow?

135
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:10,233
Right.

136
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,168
- Okay, bye.
- Good luck.

137
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:14,705
(strumming guitar)

138
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:22,964
# You have broken me
all the way down #

139
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:27,456
# Down upon my knees #

140
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:37,248
# And you have broken me
all the way now #

141
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,950
(music continues)

142
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,037
(phone ringing)

143
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:46,390
Hi. This is Catherine.

144
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,879
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

145
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:12,491
# I'll be far to sea #

146
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:15,841
(music continues)

147
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:21,015
That job's ready
for collection now, Dad.

148
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:22,751
Okay, son.

149
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:25,234
I'm going to head into town.

150
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:30,231
Should I turn this
around for you?

151
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,663
What'll I get for dinner?

152
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:34,765
The fish, maybe.

153
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:47,849
(music continues)

154
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:01,362
Hello.

155
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:03,497
How are you? How's it going?

156
00:10:03,597 --> 00:10:04,999
I bring you my Hoover.

157
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:07,263
(fades)

158
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:11,306
All right.

159
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:13,326
What's wrong with it?

160
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:15,361
It is fucked.

161
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,213
It doesn't suck up
the dirt.

162
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:18,782
Well, listen, there's
nothing I can do,

163
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:20,684
I don't have any of my
tools or nothing with me.

164
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:22,219
I'm going on me break now.

165
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,954
Can you bring it in
tomorrow or something?

166
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:26,056
Well, no, I bring it today.

167
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:28,310
- You, you...
- Yeah, but there's nothing

168
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,628
I can do with it, love,

169
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:30,830
I don't have
me tools, or...

170
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,665
It's like I have
to bring it home.

171
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:37,020
If I come on break, you have
a look at it at least?

172
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,971
Yeah, but you
don't understand.

173
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,574
I come with you, then?

174
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,128
For lunch?

175
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:44,177
Yeah, all right.

176
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:45,646
- Yes, we go together?
- Yeah.

177
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,415
Okay.

178
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:49,531
Thank you.

179
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:52,426
- You hungry?
- I'm always hungry.

180
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:05,031
So you know a bit
about music then?

181
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:10,141
My father used to play in
the orchestra back at home.

182
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:12,839
He played violin.

183
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,617
But he got arthritis then,
and he killed himself.

184
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:19,051
Really?

185
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:22,856
But before he go, he teach me
how to play piano.

186
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:25,259
"It's not so hard
on the fingers" he said.

187
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:28,410
Do you get to play much?

188
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,599
Hmm. No, I don't, I don't
have a piano at home.

189
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:33,702
I can't get one in Ireland;
it's so much money.

190
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:35,804
I can't afford it.

191
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,593
Yeah, it's expensive
all right.

192
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:49,487
I play in a
piano shop.

193
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:50,956
This man lets me play-

194
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:53,307
one hour per day
at lunch.

195
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:55,976
Somewhere around here?

196
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:57,329
You want to
hear me play?

197
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:59,381
- Yeah.
- Now?

198
00:11:59,482 --> 00:12:00,366
Yeah.

199
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,698
Okay.

200
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:05,773
(knocking)

201
00:12:05,873 --> 00:12:07,875
Can we come in?

202
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,212
(buzzer)

203
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:18,588
This is the man
I was telling you about.

204
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:19,789
He's a real gentleman.

205
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:20,790
Hi.

206
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,058
Okay for me
to play today?

207
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,259
Yeah, that's fine.

208
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,461
Thanks.

209
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:26,930
Not the baby Yamaha
though. She's sold.

210
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,033
- Okie-dokie.
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:36,709
Now, which one today?

212
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,747
(classical)

213
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:20,660
# #

214
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:52,964
That kind of thing.

215
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:55,315
(exhales)

216
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:57,650
It's amazing.

217
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:58,704
Did you write that?

218
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,657
No, no, Mendelssohn did.

219
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,774
It's good.

220
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,936
It's good, yes.

221
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,113
Play me another
of your songs.

222
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,115
No.

223
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,116
Please.

224
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,150
Not here.

225
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,919
Why? Here, Billy
doesn't mind.

226
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,423
- You think it would be all right?
- Yes.

227
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:17,992
Okay.

228
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,594
Let's put that there, yeah?

229
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:21,696
Mm-hmm.

230
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:24,834
This is in C, yeah?

231
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:26,936
Yeah, okay,
I can see that.

232
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:28,989
Okay.

233
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,289
So, it goes, um...

234
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:35,628
Da... It goes,
# Da-da-da-da #

235
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:43,074
# Da-da-da-da,
da-da-da-da-da #

236
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,823
Yeah? And then there's
a bit in there-

237
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:46,925
Can you do that?

238
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:54,651
# Da-da-da-da-da... #

239
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:55,836
Brilliant.

240
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,638
And then there's another
part that goes, uh...

241
00:14:57,738 --> 00:15:01,188
# Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa #

242
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:05,261
# Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa #

243
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:09,135
# Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa #

244
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:11,320
Yeah? And then the
chorus, let's see.

245
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,588
- You have those two bits?
- Mm-hmm.

246
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:13,791
And the chorus goes...

247
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:18,010
# Da-da-da-da-da

248
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:24,990
# Pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa #

249
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:31,897
# Ba-ba... da-da. #

250
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,412
That's it. Perfect. Brilliant.

251
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:35,281
So, do you want
to give it a spin?

252
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:38,832
- Yes, try it.
- Okay.

253
00:15:38,932 --> 00:15:40,688
Two, three,

254
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:42,790
four.

255
00:15:56,406 --> 00:16:03,599
# I don't know you,
but I want you #

256
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:11,138
# All the more for that #

257
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:18,585
# And words fall through me
and always fool me #

258
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:24,119
# And I can't react #

259
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:26,287
We change here.

260
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:34,636
# And games that never amount
to more than they're meant #

261
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:39,839
# Will play themselves out #

262
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:41,159
Hold it.

263
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,261
And the chorus.

264
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:52,856
# Take this sinking boat
and point it home #

265
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:58,994
# We've still got time #

266
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:03,801
# Raise your hopeful voice #

267
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:07,070
# You had the choice #

268
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:14,626
# You've made it now #

269
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:25,124
# Falling slowly,
eyes that know me #

270
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:29,378
# And I can't go back #

271
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:40,176
# Moods that take me
and erase me #

272
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:47,520
# And I'm painted black#

273
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:56,196
# Well, you have suffered enough
and warred with yourself #

274
00:17:56,296 --> 00:18:00,744
# It's time that you won #

275
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:05,022
Again.

276
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:14,452
# Take this sinking boat
and point it home #

277
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:20,825
# We've still got time #

278
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:25,595
# Raise your hopeful voice #

279
00:18:25,695 --> 00:18:28,830
# You had the choice #

280
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:36,228
# You've made it now #

281
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:47,273
# Uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-huh... #

282
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:52,643
# Yeah #

283
00:18:52,743 --> 00:19:00,870
# Take this sinking boat
and point it home #

284
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:07,279
# We've still got time #

285
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:11,813
# Raise your hopeful voice #

286
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:21,629
# You had the choice,
you've made it now #

287
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:29,634
# Falling slowly,
sing your melody #

288
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:36,633
# I'll sing along... #

289
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,745
(vocalizing)

290
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,231
# Ah, ah... #

291
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:59,537
# #

292
00:19:59,637 --> 00:20:02,089
# Call and I'll sing along. #

293
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:34,562
I moved back in
about a year ago,

294
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:39,002
after me ma died, just to
help me dad out, you know.

295
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:42,404
So tell me about her.

296
00:20:42,504 --> 00:20:44,373
Who, me ma?

297
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:49,398
No, the girl, the special girl
you write these songs for.

298
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,713
No.

299
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:53,064
Come on.

300
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:55,152
What did she do to you?

301
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:01,740
Well.

302
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:10,020
# Ten years ago, I fell in
love with an Irish girl #

303
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,023
# She took my heart #

304
00:21:13,124 --> 00:21:18,694
# But she went and screwed
some guy that she knew #

305
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:23,704
# And now I'm in Dublin
with a broken heart #

306
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:29,041
# Oh, broken-hearted
Hoover-fixer sucker guy#

307
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:33,379
# Oh, broken-hearted
Hoover-fixer sucker... #

308
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:37,048
# Sucker guy #

309
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:41,321
# One day, I'll go there
and win her once again #

310
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:47,827
# But until then, I'm just
a sucker of a guy. #

311
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:50,510
(laughing)

312
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,675
So she's with him now?

313
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:58,725
- No.
- Don't know.

314
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:00,828
Where is she?

315
00:22:01,463 --> 00:22:05,768
# She's in old London town #

316
00:22:08,638 --> 00:22:12,739
# Living somewhere
around Chiswick. #

317
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:19,618
I miss her.
It's just sort of... you know.

318
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:24,005
You're not going
to go get her?

319
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,857
No?

320
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:29,192
No. Fuck her.

321
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:31,130
# Fuck her,
fuck her. #

322
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,632
# Fuck her, she's gone #

323
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:35,653
# Fuck her, she's gone forever#

324
00:22:35,753 --> 00:22:37,370
# She fucking fucked it up!... #

325
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,972
- (woman speaks indistinctly)
- Sorry.

326
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:40,073
Sorry.

327
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:43,258
(softly):
# Fucking fucked it up #

328
00:22:43,358 --> 00:22:46,327
# She fucking fucked it up! #

329
00:22:46,428 --> 00:22:48,550
# And now she's gonna die. #

330
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,652
(playing guitar chords)

331
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:58,743
(radio playing)

332
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:01,722
Give us the sharp eight
there, son.

333
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:08,887
And the Phillips.

334
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,975
Come on.

335
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:15,614
Your son
is a very talented man, sir.

336
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:18,418
Well, he should be.
I trained him meself.

337
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:20,220
Oh, no. I meant the songs.

338
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,369
Oh, right. Is he?

339
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:24,191
- Very.
- Okay, that's done.

340
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,194
You can take it back
with you.

341
00:23:26,294 --> 00:23:28,396
It was just the belt,
so it should be all right now.

342
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:30,365
Thank you.
How much do I owe you?

343
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:31,899
Oh, you're fine there;
it's free.

344
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:34,382
Nothing's for free.
How much?

345
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:38,208
Say four euro, love.

346
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,514
Okay. We're going
to head upstairs, Dad.

347
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:45,750
Is there anything
else you need?

348
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,118
No, I'm grand.

349
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:48,486
Okay.

350
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:50,455
A pleasure to meet you, sir.

351
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,190
And you.

352
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,458
Take care.

353
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,561
Good.

354
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,772
Come on in.

355
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,082
There you are.

356
00:24:16,852 --> 00:24:20,850
(music playing on tape)

357
00:24:30,868 --> 00:24:33,221
(music stops)

358
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:34,807
Wow.

359
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:38,410
Can you transfer this stuff on to
disc for me so I can listen?

360
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,497
Yeah.

361
00:24:40,597 --> 00:24:41,815
I have to go now.

362
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:44,999
Do you want to stay?

363
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:47,166
What do you mean?

364
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,404
Stay the night?

365
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:51,791
What?

366
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,799
Fuck this.

367
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:58,534
Thanks for the Hoover, yeah?

368
00:24:58,634 --> 00:25:00,931
- See you.
- See you around.

369
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,443
Fuck.

370
00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:12,147
Flowers? Flowers?

371
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:20,091
- Hey.
- Hey.

372
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:22,207
How's it going?

373
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:23,963
Hey, where you going?

374
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:28,148
I wanted to give you the CDs
that I made for you.

375
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:30,671
I'm really...
I'm just really lonely,

376
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:32,373
and you're gorgeous,
and I just...

377
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:34,409
I'm sorry. I fucked up.
I'm sorry. I...

378
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:37,193
I don't know what to say.

379
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:39,281
It won't happen again.

380
00:25:45,288 --> 00:25:47,223
Do you have a CD player?

381
00:25:47,323 --> 00:25:48,926
Yeah.

382
00:25:49,026 --> 00:25:51,576
Here you go.

383
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:54,733
Batteries are pretty low,
but it should work.

384
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,802
I give it back.

385
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:58,437
No problem. Keep it.

386
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:01,086
I have to go now.

387
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,775
I'll talk
to you later.

388
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:05,077
You don't want to get a cup of
tea or something? I'd love to...

389
00:26:05,177 --> 00:26:06,780
just talk to you
a bit more.

390
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,282
I have responsibilities.
I have to go home.

391
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:11,818
Is it okay to walk along
with you then?

392
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:13,253
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

393
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:15,757
Cool. Cool.
So how was it today?

394
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:17,939
Selling good.

395
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,795
And today is a really good day
for me

396
00:26:19,895 --> 00:26:23,683
because I got a job
in a big house, cleaning.

397
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:27,336
This lady is going to pay me
some money, so I'm very happy.

398
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:30,074
That's brilliant.
I'm delighted.

399
00:26:39,217 --> 00:26:41,186
This is where I live.

400
00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:44,539
Oh, yeah? Cool.

401
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:46,458
All right, then.

402
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,160
Do you want to come in?

403
00:26:48,261 --> 00:26:52,448
Can I? Yeah. Cool.

404
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:54,067
Hi, guys.

405
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:55,202
Hello.

406
00:26:55,302 --> 00:26:56,203
How are you today?

407
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:57,371
Not bad, not bad.

413
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:42,824
Ah, hi.

(speaks Czech)

415
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:47,030
This is my friend.
This is my mother.

416
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,211
How are you?

417
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:51,266
Nice to meet you.
How's it going?

418
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:54,919
(speaking Czech)

419
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:58,759
This is my
daughter Ivonka.

420
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:01,527
Come on.

421
00:28:01,627 --> 00:28:03,845
Hello, Ivonka. Hello.

422
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,622

423
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:16,079
(speaking Czech)

424
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,116
Sorry?

425
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:20,668
That's dinner. Do you
want to stay for dinner?

426
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:22,770
Yeah. Thank you.

427
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:35,985
Want to sit down?

428
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:37,253
Yeah.

429
00:28:37,353 --> 00:28:39,355
MOTHER:

430
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:44,227

431
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:51,187
(speaking Czech)

432
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:54,505
(speaking Czech)

433
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:59,847
(speaking Czech)

434
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:03,617
Well, what did she say?

435
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:05,285
She says you're handsome.

436
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:06,621
She what?

437
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:08,289
Says you're handsome.

438
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:09,791
How do I say thanks?

439
00:29:09,892 --> 00:29:10,692
(speaks Czech word)

440
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:13,410
(speaks Czech word)

441
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,563
(speaks Czech)

442
00:29:14,663 --> 00:29:16,032
Says, "You're welcome."

443
00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:17,801
Cool. Thanks.

444
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:19,169
Ty to speak a little English, Mama.

445
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:21,272
No, thank you.

446
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:24,274
Careful.

447
00:29:24,374 --> 00:29:25,743
Careful, Ivonka.
Don't do that.

448
00:29:25,843 --> 00:29:27,885
She's grand.
She's grand.

449
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:31,249
Where's her dad?

450
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:33,831
He doesn't live here.

451
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:36,516
Why not?

452
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,294
He's at home.

453
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:49,121
Hello. Hi.

454
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,572
These are
from next door.

455
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:52,939
They come in
to watch telly.

456
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,776
- Yeah.
- Hi, guys.

457
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,344
There's only one
telly in the building.

458
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:58,047
<i>We watch Fair City together.</i>

459
00:29:58,147 --> 00:29:59,749
<i>Fair City, we love.<i/></i>

460
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:02,602
<i>We learn English
from Fair City.</i>

461
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:04,421
Are you not pregnant?

462
00:30:04,521 --> 00:30:06,057
(laughing)

463
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:08,610
How are you, man?

464
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:10,720
What is the hurry?

465
00:30:22,742 --> 00:30:24,444
Just put her in there.

466
00:30:24,544 --> 00:30:26,546
Okay.

467
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:29,617
There you go, dearie.

468
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:34,388
Okay.

469
00:30:34,488 --> 00:30:36,491
She likes you.

470
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:56,416
(music playing on CD)

471
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:12,847
You have no lyrics
for this one?

472
00:31:12,947 --> 00:31:15,337
It's really good.
I like it.

473
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:20,488
I've got a few,
but they're not right.

474
00:31:21,277 --> 00:31:23,279
Huh?

475
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,902
I've got a few,
but they're not right.

476
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:30,466
What? Do you like it?

477
00:31:30,566 --> 00:31:31,789
It's great.

478
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:35,726
Would you be into trying...
trying to write lyrics for it?

479
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:37,495
Really? I could?

480
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:38,964
Yeah. It's just
like that idea?

481
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,799
- Yeah.
- Cool. Cool.

482
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,001
That would be good.

483
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,770
I can keep machine
and write it?

484
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,105
Yeah. Do. I was having
a bit of trouble with it.

485
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:48,175
It's too romantic for me.

486
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:49,810
It is romantic.

487
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,712
You have a
romantic streak.

488
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:54,862
I used to have
a romantic streak.

489
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:56,951
When?

490
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,737
When I was your age,
I suppose.

491
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:02,725
I see. You're
an old man now.

492
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:04,827
Yeah. Dying.

493
00:32:06,562 --> 00:32:08,564
Cynical.

494
00:32:12,403 --> 00:32:14,372
You have to go now.

495
00:32:14,472 --> 00:32:17,075
Thanks for the Hoover
and food and songs.

496
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:19,178
No problem.

497
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:25,152
Thanks for the company.

498
00:32:25,252 --> 00:32:26,785
I needed it.

499
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:28,888
Me, too.

500
00:32:30,424 --> 00:32:32,826
You don't want
to go for late coffee

501
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:34,494
or a walk or something? No?

502
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:36,263
I can't. See you.

503
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:37,865
Bye.

504
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:39,968
See you.

505
00:32:58,722 --> 00:33:00,859
(music playing over earphones)

506
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:05,113
(humming)

507
00:33:05,213 --> 00:33:06,966
(music playing)

508
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:09,068
(music stops)

509
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:18,012
Fuck you, batteries.

510
00:33:34,764 --> 00:33:36,894
Jesus.

511
00:33:44,242 --> 00:33:47,112
I'll pay you back.

512
00:33:49,714 --> 00:33:51,717
Come on.

513
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:07,117
# Are you really here #

514
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:11,125
# Or am I dreaming? #

515
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:16,728
# I can't tell dream
from truth #

516
00:34:16,828 --> 00:34:19,829
# For it's been so long #

517
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,671
# Since I have seen you #

518
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:29,648
# I can hardly remember
your face anymore #

519
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:36,352
# When I get pretty lonely #

520
00:34:36,453 --> 00:34:42,194
# And the distance
causes only silence #

521
00:34:42,294 --> 00:34:48,799
# I think of you smiling #

522
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:52,502
# With pride in your eyes #

523
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:56,038
# Lover that sighs #

524
00:34:56,138 --> 00:35:01,917
# If you want me #

525
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:08,393
# Satisfy me #

526
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:14,664
# If you want me #

527
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:21,216
# Satisfy me #

528
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:30,452
# Are you really sure
that you believe me #

529
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:36,121
# When others say I lie? #

530
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:43,100
# I wonder if you could
ever despise me #

531
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,836
# When you know I really tried #

532
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:52,274
# To be a better one #

533
00:35:52,374 --> 00:35:55,779
# To satisfy you #

534
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,585
# For you're everything to me #

535
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:08,360
# And I'll do what you ask me #

536
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:15,337
# If you let me be free #

537
00:36:15,437 --> 00:36:21,344
# If you want me #

538
00:36:21,444 --> 00:36:27,817
# Satisfy me #

539
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:34,190
# If you want me #

540
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:41,015
# Satisfy me #

541
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:59,586
# If you want me #

542
00:36:59,686 --> 00:37:05,825
# Satisfy me #

543
00:37:05,926 --> 00:37:12,302
# If you want me #

544
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:18,488
# Satisfy me #

545
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:31,704
(music continues)

547
00:38:00,272 --> 00:38:04,595
# Escalated #

548
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:11,147
# Little cracks they escalated #

549
00:38:12,252 --> 00:38:18,708
# From back inside comes #

550
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:22,947
# Lies, lies #

551
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:27,219
# Breaking... #

552
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:29,419
# When will... #

553
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,641
When will you learn?

554
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,743
When will you learn?

555
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:43,675
# I think it's time
we give it up #

556
00:38:43,775 --> 00:38:50,278
# And figure out
what's stopping us #

557
00:38:50,379 --> 00:38:57,088
# From breathing easy #

558
00:38:57,188 --> 00:39:04,398
# And talking straight #

559
00:39:04,498 --> 00:39:11,105
# The way is clear
if you're ready now #

560
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:18,847
# The volunteer
is slowing down #

561
00:39:18,948 --> 00:39:23,720
# And taking time #

562
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:32,701
# To save himself #

563
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:39,905
# The little cracks,
they escalated #

564
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:46,077
# Before we knew
it was too late #

565
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:53,523
# For making circles #

566
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:59,880
# And telling lies #

567
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:12,444
# And I, I can't
keep up with you #

568
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:19,284
# Maybe if you
slowed down for me #

569
00:40:19,385 --> 00:40:24,590
# I could see
you're only telling #

570
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:30,497
# Lies, lies, lies #

571
00:40:30,598 --> 00:40:36,269
# Breaking us down with your #

572
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:41,976
# Lies, lies, lies #

573
00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:47,835
# When will you learn? #

574
00:40:58,645 --> 00:41:03,679
(piano plays)

575
00:41:12,328 --> 00:41:18,221
# The little cracks,
they escalated #

# And I, I can't keep up with you #

580
00:41:50,022 --> 00:41:56,095
# Maybe if you'd
slow down for me #

581
00:41:56,195 --> 00:42:01,835
# I could see
you're only telling #

582
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:07,107
# Lies, lies, lies #

583
00:42:07,207 --> 00:42:12,915

# When will you learn? #

586
00:42:28,216 --> 00:42:31,347
# So plant the thought #

587
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,185
(music continues)

588
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:40,930
(ends)

589
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:42,498
Would you like to buy a flower?

590
00:42:42,598 --> 00:42:44,167
- Hi. How are you?
- How's it going?

591
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:45,469
Pretty good.

592
00:42:45,569 --> 00:42:47,404
- Pretty good.
- Good to see you.

593
00:42:47,504 --> 00:42:49,874
I'm going to go to
London, I've decided.

594
00:42:49,974 --> 00:42:50,976
- Good.
- Yeah.

595
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:52,010
That's great.

596
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,545
Yeah, it's good,
it makes sense.

597
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:55,347
Well done.

598
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,016
When are you going?

599
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,199
I'm going
to go Monday.

600
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:01,536
Wow, that's, that's soon.

601
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:04,124
You'll get
your girlfriend back,

602
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:06,160
and you'll get
your record deal, and...

603
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,214
- become famous.
- Yeah, right.

604
00:43:09,314 --> 00:43:10,531
- Good.
- But listen,

605
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,200
I was thinking, I was
thinking before I go,

606
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,235
I want to make a recording
of a few songs.

607
00:43:14,335 --> 00:43:15,804
A couple of the songs
I was playing you,

608
00:43:15,904 --> 00:43:18,307
and I really liked the way
you played and your singing.

609
00:43:18,407 --> 00:43:20,910
So, if you feel like, would
you be into playing along?

610
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,277
Like what we
were playing on?

611
00:43:22,377 --> 00:43:24,214
- I would sing and play?
- Yeah.

612
00:43:24,314 --> 00:43:25,682
I'd love that.

613
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:27,084
Really? Cool.

614
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:29,520
- So you'd be in my band for a few days.
- Yeah.

615
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,740
Well, that's the first thing
I've got sorted out.

616
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,494
Now I just need to sort
everything else out.

617
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:38,430
All right, guys, welcome.

618
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:42,267
Now, so let me
give you the tour.

619
00:43:42,368 --> 00:43:44,804
That is your
live rooms in there.

620
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:46,439
This is a new desk.

621
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:49,476
You got your hard drive and
you got your outboard gear.

622
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:51,012
Now all in all
we're talking about

623
00:43:51,112 --> 00:43:52,113
three grand
for a weekend of...

624
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,214
- Three?
- Yeah.

625
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:54,749
Three grand, that's pretty good.

626
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,152
You must be crazy.

627
00:43:56,252 --> 00:43:57,352
$3,000

628
00:43:57,452 --> 00:43:59,738
Well, have a look around.

629
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,405
You've everything
you need.

630
00:44:02,505 --> 00:44:05,394
- What do you think, is it good?
- (softly): It's pretty good.

631
00:44:05,494 --> 00:44:07,915
We'll give you one.

632
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:09,599
(chuckles)

633
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:10,667
I'm sorry.

634
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:12,070
Have you heard
this guy's songs?

635
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,471
I haven't yet, no.

636
00:44:13,571 --> 00:44:14,539
He's great.

637
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:15,606
Okay, but, uh,

638
00:44:15,706 --> 00:44:19,110
listen, I can fill
this place in an hour.

639
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:24,210
One and a half then,
that's my limit.

640
00:44:25,985 --> 00:44:27,787
We can talk about two.

641
00:44:27,887 --> 00:44:29,422
We don't talk.

642
00:44:29,522 --> 00:44:30,758
We shake.

643
00:44:30,858 --> 00:44:31,992
We shake on two, yeah?

644
00:44:32,092 --> 00:44:33,894
Shake now?

645
00:44:33,994 --> 00:44:35,097
All right.

646
00:44:35,197 --> 00:44:36,098
Two thousand.

647
00:44:36,198 --> 00:44:37,265
She drives a hard bargain.

648
00:44:37,365 --> 00:44:39,368
She's a tough cookie.

649
00:44:43,339 --> 00:44:45,922
So you like this shop?

650
00:44:46,022 --> 00:44:48,260
I buy all my clothes here.

651
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,247
It's good for me, you know?

652
00:44:50,347 --> 00:44:51,915
Cheap.

653
00:44:52,015 --> 00:44:54,043
Nice fashions.

654
00:44:55,186 --> 00:44:56,120
Okay, you ready?

655
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,315
Yeah, I'm ready.

656
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:05,097
That's good. That will do.

657
00:45:05,197 --> 00:45:07,033
<i>Do you like it?</i>

658
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:08,235
You're gorgeous.

659
00:45:08,335 --> 00:45:10,337
All right, can we go?

660
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,281
(tape clicks on)

661
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:22,234
# #

662
00:45:22,334 --> 00:45:27,107
(man singing on tape)

663
00:45:27,207 --> 00:45:29,192
# #

664
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,601
The quality is poor,

665
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,739
but if we can get
a professional tape,

666
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:45,434
I'm, I'm satisfied that he
can secure a lucrative deal.

667
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:49,215
You take it home, you,
you listen to it.

668
00:45:49,316 --> 00:45:50,549
You play it to your boss.

669
00:45:50,649 --> 00:45:53,628
I'm sure you can
get him to approve.

670
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:55,856
Can I show you something?

671
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:59,907
# I want to be free #

672
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,496
# I want to be me #

673
00:46:01,596 --> 00:46:04,951
# I want you to bayou #

674
00:46:05,051 --> 00:46:10,535
(music continues)

675
00:46:15,045 --> 00:46:17,048
(ends)

676
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:34,447
Nice one, lads.

677
00:46:34,547 --> 00:46:35,501
How's it going?

678
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:36,603
How's it going?
All right.

679
00:46:36,703 --> 00:46:37,671
Good, how is it today?

680
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:38,672
Is it slow?

681
00:46:38,772 --> 00:46:40,342
Have a look
there yourself.

682
00:46:40,442 --> 00:46:42,444
Is that it? Is that it?

683
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:44,980
That's how it's
going at the moment.

684
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,214
Listen, I wanted
to ask you,

685
00:46:46,315 --> 00:46:47,849
as myself and herself
are making a tape...

686
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:49,151
How's it going?
All right?

687
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:51,554
of a few songs down
at Samson's Studios

688
00:46:51,654 --> 00:46:53,889
and I was just wondering, if
you were around next weekend,

689
00:46:53,989 --> 00:46:56,326
for, to, if you'd be
interested in doing it.

690
00:46:56,426 --> 00:46:57,327
A bit of recording?

691
00:46:57,427 --> 00:46:58,328
Bit of recording, yeah?

692
00:46:58,429 --> 00:46:59,830
Yeah, doing Lizzy
stuff. or...?

693
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,565
No, it's not Lizzy,
it's me own songs.

694
00:47:01,665 --> 00:47:02,767
We only do Lizzy.

695
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:05,788
Really. It's one
of our things.

696
00:47:05,888 --> 00:47:09,708
That sort of stuff. Is it, sort
of rocky Lizzy stuff or...?

697
00:47:09,808 --> 00:47:12,194
- No. No, it's not.
- Yeah,

698
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:13,380
Singer-songwriter stuff?

699
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,713
It's kind of singer-songwriter, yeah.

700
00:47:14,814 --> 00:47:16,182
- Kinda...
- Is it any good?

701
00:47:16,282 --> 00:47:17,183
- Uh...
- It's great.

702
00:47:17,283 --> 00:47:18,685
Is it?

703
00:47:18,785 --> 00:47:19,686
Well, look, like I said,

704
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:21,055
I don't really know
much about them,

705
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:22,223
but they seem
like nice people.

706
00:47:22,323 --> 00:47:23,791
Yeah. I just have to
call my mother first.

707
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:24,859
- Then we go.
- Cool.

708
00:47:24,959 --> 00:47:25,893
Great, great.

709
00:47:25,993 --> 00:47:29,023
(speaking Czech)

710
00:47:43,515 --> 00:47:45,517
(hanging up)

711
00:47:47,986 --> 00:47:49,220
Okay, come on,
we can go.

712
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,323
Cool.

713
00:47:55,761 --> 00:47:58,756
(buzz of conversation)

714
00:48:07,942 --> 00:48:11,771
Food's ready! Everybody
get your plates ready!

715
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,105
- Hello?
- Hi, how are you?

716
00:48:21,205 --> 00:48:23,659
Come on in, kids!
Take a seat!

717
00:48:38,444 --> 00:48:39,612
Everything all right
here, folks?

718
00:48:39,712 --> 00:48:41,080
Yeah, brilliant.

719
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:42,216
Enjoying the party?

720
00:48:42,316 --> 00:48:43,217
Yeah.

721
00:48:43,317 --> 00:48:44,251
Great to see you here.

722
00:48:44,351 --> 00:48:45,753
- Can you sing?
- (laughing)

723
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:47,187
If you can't sing,
you're out.

724
00:48:47,288 --> 00:48:52,111
# There's one request
I'll ask of you #

725
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:57,450
# When your liberty you gave #

726
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:02,256
# Remember Mitchell far away #

727
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:07,196
# A convict bound in chains. #

728
00:49:07,296 --> 00:49:09,280
(applause, cheers)

729
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:18,738
#... mine that once held
this heart of mine. #

730
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:22,578
(cheers, whistles)

731
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:25,415
# #

732
00:49:25,515 --> 00:49:30,890
# And I love her so #

733
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:36,210
# I wouldn't trade her
for gold #

734
00:49:38,214 --> 00:49:43,437
# I'm walking on moonbeams #

735
00:49:43,537 --> 00:49:49,089
# I was born
with a silver spoon #

736
00:49:50,994 --> 00:49:55,446
# Hell, I'm gonna be me #

737
00:49:55,547 --> 00:50:00,499
# I'm gonna be free #

738
00:50:02,676 --> 00:50:06,728
# I'm walking on moonbeams #

739
00:50:06,828 --> 00:50:12,884
# Staring out to sea #

740
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:20,281
# And if a door be closed #

741
00:50:20,381 --> 00:50:25,601
# Then a row of homes
start building #

742
00:50:27,705 --> 00:50:33,496
# And tear your curtains down #

743
00:50:33,596 --> 00:50:40,719
# For sunlight is like gold #

744
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,256
# Hell, you better be you #

745
00:50:43,356 --> 00:50:46,294
(music continues)

746
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:51,980
(horn beeping)

747
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,166
Hey.

748
00:50:53,266 --> 00:50:55,316
What are you doing here?

749
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:57,839
I just came out.
You want to go for a spin?

750
00:50:57,939 --> 00:50:59,073
That's your bike?

751
00:50:59,173 --> 00:51:00,241
It's me dad's.

752
00:51:00,342 --> 00:51:01,943
He absolutely loves it,
but I've robbed it

753
00:51:02,044 --> 00:51:03,045
off him for the day.

754
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:04,346
If he knew,
he'd kill me.

755
00:51:04,446 --> 00:51:06,928
Would he?

756
00:51:07,028 --> 00:51:09,314
So do you fancy a spin, no?

757
00:51:10,353 --> 00:51:12,456
I'd love to,
but I have to go to work.

758
00:51:12,556 --> 00:51:14,525
That's cool.

759
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:16,594
Another time, yeah?

760
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:20,989
and see if you were
into going now.

761
00:51:22,668 --> 00:51:24,236
Could you have me back by lunch?

762
00:51:24,336 --> 00:51:26,419
Yeah, totally.

763
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:28,174
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

764
00:51:28,274 --> 00:51:29,175
Fancy it?

765
00:51:29,275 --> 00:51:31,277
Great.

766
00:51:38,052 --> 00:51:42,586
(music continues)

767
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,702
(ends)

768
00:52:07,953 --> 00:52:10,807
You're what?

769
00:52:10,907 --> 00:52:11,991
You're married.

770
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:14,093
Does it surprise you?

771
00:52:15,028 --> 00:52:17,030
Fuck's sake.

772
00:52:18,232 --> 00:52:20,816
Yeah.

773
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:22,269
When?

774
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:25,607
Two years ago, when I find out
I'm pregnant with Ivonka.

775
00:52:25,707 --> 00:52:28,426
(sighs)

776
00:52:28,526 --> 00:52:31,494
So where is he?

777
00:52:31,594 --> 00:52:32,982
He's back in
Czech Republic.

778
00:52:33,082 --> 00:52:37,337
It's over now and, you know,
I come here on my own.

779
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,156
(sighs)

780
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,258
Man.

781
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:45,731
You all right?

782
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,673
(exhales)

783
00:52:57,077 --> 00:52:59,661
What's the Czech
for "ocean"?

784
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:00,648
Ott-san.

785
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:01,649
Ott-san.

786
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:03,184
Pretty much the same.

787
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:05,286
Otsan.

788
00:53:07,356 --> 00:53:09,398
So what are
you gonna do?

789
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:13,563
I don't know.

790
00:53:15,698 --> 00:53:19,283
There's such distance
between me and him.

791
00:53:19,384 --> 00:53:22,273
He's so much different
to me and so much older.

792
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:26,628
It doesn't really work.

793
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:28,614
I'm fine on my own, you know?

794
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:33,650
It's just, I don't want Ivonka
to grow up without a father.

795
00:53:38,392 --> 00:53:41,923
What's the Czech for...
"Do you love him?"

796
00:53:43,063 --> 00:53:44,331
Noor-esh-ho?

797
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:46,301
Noor-esh-ho?

798
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:47,969
So...

799
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:50,071
Noor-esh-ho?

800
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:53,609
Noor-ho-tebbe.

801
00:53:55,477 --> 00:53:56,345
What?

802
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:57,980
Come on, let's go.

803
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,149
What'd you say?

804
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:01,985
- Tell me.
- You've got to teach me how to ride

805
00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:04,472
- the bike now, eh?
- No way.

806
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:05,556
- Yeah.
- No.

807
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:07,425
So come on, can I have a go?

808
00:54:07,525 --> 00:54:08,426
No.

809
00:54:08,526 --> 00:54:09,728
Please.

810
00:54:09,828 --> 00:54:12,811
No, leave it alone, will you?

811
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:16,083
But teach me how to
drive it, will you?

812
00:54:16,183 --> 00:54:17,036
Come on, just once.

813
00:54:17,136 --> 00:54:18,036
No, it's not mine.

814
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:19,105
Me dad would go
fucking crazy.

815
00:54:19,205 --> 00:54:20,139
But he's not here now.

816
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:21,141
Be careful, will you!

817
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:22,610
Be careful,
for fuck's sake.

818
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,944
Look, he's not
here now.

819
00:54:24,044 --> 00:54:26,013
- Just teach me.
- Look, my dad. Look. No, no, no.

820
00:54:26,113 --> 00:54:27,014
- No?
- No.

821
00:54:27,114 --> 00:54:30,035
- Please?
- No.

822
00:54:30,135 --> 00:54:31,553
Me dad will go
bleedin' mental.

823
00:54:31,653 --> 00:54:33,121
He totally loves this thing.

824
00:54:33,221 --> 00:54:34,957
Yeah, but you drive it.

825
00:54:35,057 --> 00:54:36,526
Yeah, he doesn't
know I have it.

826
00:54:36,626 --> 00:54:37,527
He doesn't?

827
00:54:37,627 --> 00:54:38,628
No.

828
00:54:38,728 --> 00:54:41,565
Well, then he won't
know I had it, too.

829
00:54:41,665 --> 00:54:44,986
No.
You can't have a go on it.

830
00:54:45,086 --> 00:54:45,970
Just once.

831
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:46,971
No.

832
00:54:47,071 --> 00:54:50,324
- Turn it on for me.
- No.

833
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:51,309
No.

834
00:54:51,409 --> 00:54:52,577
Come on, give
us the keys.

835
00:54:52,678 --> 00:54:53,846
I'll do it myself.

836
00:54:53,946 --> 00:54:55,948
The key's in it.

837
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:06,661
Thank you for the ride.

838
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,728
I'll see you
tomorrow, yeah?

839
00:55:07,828 --> 00:55:09,263
- For rehearsals.
- Okay, yeah.

840
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:10,264
Okay.

841
00:55:10,364 --> 00:55:12,406
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

842
00:55:16,705 --> 00:55:18,708
(horn beeping)

843
00:55:24,848 --> 00:55:29,517
# Tying to pull myself away #

844
00:55:33,725 --> 00:55:38,896
# I'm caught in a pattern
and I can't escape #

845
00:55:42,602 --> 00:55:48,411
# I'm trying
to pull myselfaway... #

846
00:55:54,415 --> 00:55:59,503
# Lately, when I get back,
there's this thing I know... #

847
00:55:59,603 --> 00:56:04,276
# Everything comes
to you, way to go #

848
00:56:04,377 --> 00:56:09,483
# Even a heart has
something to learn... #

849
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,569
Thanks, Dad.

850
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,973
All right, guys,
this is Eamon.

851
00:56:15,073 --> 00:56:16,541
He's going to
take care of you

852
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:17,676
for the weekend.

853
00:56:17,776 --> 00:56:19,177
Eamon, this is everyone.

854
00:56:19,277 --> 00:56:20,312
Kit's set up.

855
00:56:20,412 --> 00:56:23,148
Piano is waiting for you
in the live room.

856
00:56:23,248 --> 00:56:25,919
Tea and coffee in the kitchen
as you came in. Help yourselves.

857
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:27,487
You'll need plenty.

858
00:56:27,587 --> 00:56:29,090
And there is a nice
little burrito place

859
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,958
around the corner if you
want a snack, all right?

860
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:31,960
Great.

861
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,294
Okay, Eamon,
leave it to you.

862
00:56:33,394 --> 00:56:34,528
Good luck, everyone.

863
00:56:34,629 --> 00:56:37,199
Enjoy. And I might pop in
later, all right?

864
00:56:37,299 --> 00:56:38,968
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers, thanks.

865
00:56:39,068 --> 00:56:41,103
Okay, guys,
good to meet you.

866
00:56:41,203 --> 00:56:42,505
We've a few little
bits and pieces

867
00:56:42,605 --> 00:56:43,539
to set up.

868
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:45,075
I want to check
the drums inside.

869
00:56:45,175 --> 00:56:47,594
We've already set up the kit.

870
00:56:47,694 --> 00:56:50,948
Yeah, I just want to, you know,
check them for sound.

871
00:56:51,048 --> 00:56:53,050
I checked them already; it's fine.

872
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:56,954
Okay, we need to set up mics
on them for recording, yeah?

873
00:56:57,055 --> 00:56:58,757
Oh.

874
00:56:58,857 --> 00:57:00,191
Have you done much recording?

875
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,547
- No.
- No.

876
00:57:01,647 --> 00:57:01,961
No.

877
00:57:02,061 --> 00:57:05,040
- Right. Let's get cracking.
- Yeah.

878
00:57:15,076 --> 00:57:17,947
(tuning up)

879
00:57:32,496 --> 00:57:34,198
Yeah, no, I can't
do it now, love.

880
00:57:34,298 --> 00:57:35,532
I'm stuck here in the studio

881
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:37,234
with this bunch
of fucking oddballs.

882
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:40,338
Can you hang on a second?
Just one second.

883
00:57:40,438 --> 00:57:42,041
(strums guitar)

884
00:57:42,141 --> 00:57:43,475
Okay, are you ready to rock?

885
00:57:43,575 --> 00:57:44,442
Are we ready?

886
00:57:44,543 --> 00:57:46,545
Yep. We're in tune.

887
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:50,216
So Al and Timmy,
on the second verse, just...

888
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:52,352
this is pretty much
simple enough thing.

889
00:57:52,452 --> 00:57:53,954
It's in five-four,
and the second verse,

890
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:55,957
I'll give you a nod
to come in there, yeah?

891
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:58,025
Is that all right? And you're in
from the top with me, yeah?

892
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:00,763
And you know what you're doing.

893
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:05,317
All right, then, so, uh...

894
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:07,782
whenever you're ready, yeah.

895
00:58:09,438 --> 00:58:11,651
(talking on phone quietly)

896
00:58:14,144 --> 00:58:16,260
All right, later.

897
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,982
Okay, we're ready. Fire one.

898
00:58:18,082 --> 00:58:19,783
You sure you're ready?

899
00:58:19,883 --> 00:58:23,254
Okay, listen now for
the click track, everybody.

900
00:58:23,354 --> 00:58:24,756
And away we go.

901
00:58:24,856 --> 00:58:29,680
This is track one,
take one, yeah.

902
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:33,591
All right, lads, here we go,
this is it, yeah.

903
00:58:34,768 --> 00:58:38,674
(guitar strumming melody)

904
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:53,874
# So #

905
00:58:53,974 --> 00:58:58,510
# If you want something #

906
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:02,350
# And you call, call #

907
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:06,383
# Then I'll come running #

908
00:59:06,483 --> 00:59:09,190
# To fight #

909
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:12,976
# And I'll be at your door #

910
00:59:14,147 --> 00:59:22,043
# When there's nothing
worth running for #

911
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:26,141
# When your mind's made up #

912
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:30,246
# When your mind's
made up #

913
00:59:30,346 --> 00:59:34,052
# There's no point
trying to change it #

914
00:59:34,152 --> 00:59:38,324
# When your mind's made up #

915
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:41,892
# When your mind's
made up #

916
00:59:41,993 --> 00:59:46,302
# There's no point
trying to stop it #

917
00:59:46,402 --> 00:59:48,804
# You see #

918
00:59:48,905 --> 00:59:53,609
# You're just like everyone #

919
00:59:53,709 --> 00:59:57,480
# When the shit falls #

920
00:59:57,581 --> 01:00:03,099
# All you want to do
is run away #

921
01:00:05,373 --> 01:00:08,924
# And hide all by yourself #

922
01:00:09,024 --> 01:00:12,663
# When you're far from me #

923
01:00:12,763 --> 01:00:17,768
# There's nothing else #

924
01:00:17,868 --> 01:00:21,641
# When your mind's made up #

925
01:00:21,742 --> 01:00:25,411
# When your mind's
made up #

926
01:00:25,511 --> 01:00:29,351
# There's no point trying
to change it #

927
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:33,385
# When your mind's made up #

928
01:00:33,485 --> 01:00:37,491
# When your mind's
made up #

929
01:00:37,591 --> 01:00:41,263
# There's no point
even talking #

930
01:00:41,363 --> 01:00:45,271
# When your mind's made up #

931
01:00:45,371 --> 01:00:49,303
# When your mind's
made up #

932
01:00:49,404 --> 01:00:53,145
# There's no point
trying to fight it #

933
01:00:53,245 --> 01:00:57,483
# When your mind's #

934
01:00:57,583 --> 01:01:05,591
# Your mind's #

935
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:09,627
# Made #

936
01:01:09,727 --> 01:01:11,775
# Up... #

937
01:01:20,494 --> 01:01:24,816
# Ah #

938
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:28,517
# There's no point trying
to change it #

939
01:01:28,617 --> 01:01:36,594
# When your #

940
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:44,993
# 0h #

941
01:01:52,498 --> 01:02:01,473
# Ooh, ooh #

942
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:10,383
# So... if you ever
want something #

943
01:02:12,219 --> 01:02:16,474
# And you call, call #

944
01:02:16,574 --> 01:02:20,795
# Then I'll come running. #

945
01:02:26,336 --> 01:02:27,971
(sighs)

946
01:02:28,071 --> 01:02:29,840
Okay.

947
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,675
Wow.

948
01:02:31,775 --> 01:02:33,777
That was nice.

949
01:02:34,678 --> 01:02:36,314
Did you write that?

950
01:02:36,414 --> 01:02:38,417
Yeah.

951
01:02:39,118 --> 01:02:41,120
(synth beat)

952
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:49,212
# You must have
fallen from the sky #

953
01:02:49,312 --> 01:02:52,200
# You must have shattered
in the runway #

954
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:57,243
(music continues)

955
01:03:20,566 --> 01:03:24,888
# You need somewhere
to fall apart #

956
01:03:24,988 --> 01:03:29,457
(continues)

957
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:32,559
# Someone to fall upon #

958
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:35,676
(continues)

959
01:03:39,254 --> 01:03:41,707
# That fools the bulls #

960
01:03:41,807 --> 01:03:43,758
# The powdered hag #

961
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:46,388
(continues)

962
01:04:21,336 --> 01:04:23,288
(music ends)

963
01:04:23,388 --> 01:04:26,355
Okay, what do you think?

964
01:04:26,455 --> 01:04:28,692
I think it's fucking weird.

965
01:04:28,793 --> 01:04:32,316
There's a couple of little tech bits,
we can probably fix them,

966
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:35,752
but uh, you know, it's 4:00 in the morning,
so it's up to you guys.

967
01:04:35,852 --> 01:04:39,224
Do you want to push through
or go for another one?

968
01:04:39,324 --> 01:04:41,893
I'd love to keep going
if everybody is into it.

969
01:04:41,993 --> 01:04:44,095
Can I have a cup of tea
or something first?

970
01:04:44,195 --> 01:04:45,864
Want a cup of tea?

971
01:04:45,964 --> 01:04:48,668
- You want to take ten or 15, yeah?
- Sure.

972
01:04:48,768 --> 01:04:50,169
I'll tweak what I can.

973
01:04:50,269 --> 01:04:51,671
You guys take ten.

974
01:04:51,771 --> 01:04:56,392
Guys, why do you think there
are no blonde priests?

975
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:59,030
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

976
01:05:20,437 --> 01:05:22,440
This is great.

977
01:05:30,516 --> 01:05:35,653
(playing lush melody)

978
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:49,070
How's it going?

979
01:05:51,139 --> 01:05:52,808
Good.

980
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:55,077
I don't think we're supposed
to be here, though.

981
01:05:55,178 --> 01:05:57,659
Ah, it's all right.

982
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,182
This is beautiful, isn't it?

983
01:05:59,282 --> 01:06:01,619
Yeah, it's a beautiful piano,
like a Baldwin.

984
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:02,786
It's a perfect piano.

985
01:06:02,886 --> 01:06:04,188
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

986
01:06:04,288 --> 01:06:08,375
Play us one of your songs.

987
01:06:08,475 --> 01:06:12,164
Hmm... They're
all half-written and more ideas.

988
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:14,647
Go on, I'd love to hear one.

989
01:06:16,335 --> 01:06:18,171
Okay, I have one,

990
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:21,822
but... it's not finished and I...

991
01:06:21,923 --> 01:06:23,110
I don't really...

992
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:24,278
Just play it, I know.

993
01:06:24,378 --> 01:06:26,046
Okay, but the lyrics
are very rough, okay?

994
01:06:26,146 --> 01:06:28,811
- It'll be great.
- Okay.

995
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:49,125
# Walking up the hill
tonight #

996
01:06:49,225 --> 01:06:54,583
# When you have closed
your eyes #

997
01:06:58,016 --> 01:07:02,840
# I wish I didn't have
to make #

998
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:08,390
# All those mistakes
and be wise #

999
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:17,225
# But please try
to be patient #

1000
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:23,309
# And know
that I'm still learning #

1001
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:32,510
# I'm sorry
that you have to see #

1002
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:37,499
# The strength inside me
burning #

1003
01:07:40,667 --> 01:07:46,824
# And where are you,
my angel, now? #

1004
01:07:46,924 --> 01:07:53,684
# Don't you see me crying? #

1005
01:07:55,082 --> 01:08:00,305
# I know that you can't
do it all #

1006
01:08:00,406 --> 01:08:06,961
# But you can't say
I'm not trying #

1007
01:08:08,999 --> 01:08:14,487
# And I'm letting myself down #

1008
01:08:14,587 --> 01:08:21,350
# By satisfying you #

1009
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:29,343
# I really wish
that you could see #

1010
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:31,425
# I... #

1011
01:08:44,574 --> 01:08:47,090
You all right?

1012
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,578
(sighs)

1013
01:08:48,678 --> 01:08:50,013
Did you write that
for your husband?

1014
01:08:50,113 --> 01:08:51,349
(laughing):
Yes, I did,

1015
01:08:51,449 --> 01:08:52,917
and he didn't like it.

1016
01:08:53,017 --> 01:08:54,585
What an idiot.

1017
01:08:54,685 --> 01:08:56,688
Yeah, he's an idiot.

1018
01:09:14,141 --> 01:09:16,143
(sighing)

1019
01:09:22,852 --> 01:09:26,172
Come on away to London with me.

1020
01:09:26,272 --> 01:09:28,826
Come on, we'll write loads of
songs and live in a nice flat.

1021
01:09:28,926 --> 01:09:30,460
You can bring Ivonka over,
it'll be brilliant.

1022
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,895
Come on.

1023
01:09:31,996 --> 01:09:33,630
Yeah, we'll go to London

1024
01:09:33,731 --> 01:09:35,834
and no one will ever
find us again.

1025
01:09:35,934 --> 01:09:37,034
- No one.
- No one.

1026
01:09:37,135 --> 01:09:38,470
We'll have a brilliant band.

1027
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:40,606
We'll sell out all the places
and it'll be great.

1028
01:09:40,706 --> 01:09:42,441
And we'll make
an album together?

1029
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:43,976
I'd love that, come on.

1030
01:09:44,077 --> 01:09:45,444
Yeah, and, and I'll do

1031
01:09:45,544 --> 01:09:46,545
the backing vocals on it?

1032
01:09:46,646 --> 01:09:47,781
Yeah, and play
the piano.

1033
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:49,048
Mm-hmm.

1034
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:50,483
Come on, I'm serious.

1035
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:52,585
Can I bring my mother?

1036
01:09:58,192 --> 01:10:01,187
Well, we should go back
to work.

1037
01:10:03,598 --> 01:10:05,600
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1038
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:11,705
(music playing on speakers)

1039
01:10:19,316 --> 01:10:22,312
(sighing)

1040
01:10:25,323 --> 01:10:26,926
What day is it today?

1041
01:10:27,026 --> 01:10:28,494
(laughter)

1042
01:10:28,594 --> 01:10:30,546
Monday.

1043
01:10:30,646 --> 01:10:33,667
I think it's time we did
the, uh, the car test.

1044
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:35,669
What's the car
test, Eamon?

1045
01:10:35,769 --> 01:10:37,805
We've been listening
back on these, uh,

1046
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:39,340
big studio speakers.

1047
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,577
So it's time we had a go
on some shitty speakers.

1048
01:10:42,677 --> 01:10:43,746
So...

1049
01:10:43,846 --> 01:10:44,913
All right, let's go.

1050
01:10:45,013 --> 01:10:47,182
Let's go for a spin
and have a listen in me car.

1051
01:10:47,282 --> 01:10:48,450
Great, man.

1052
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:49,786
- Yeah.
- Go have a ride, yeah?

1053
01:10:49,886 --> 01:10:51,838
Let's go.

1054
01:10:51,938 --> 01:10:55,487
We'll clear this up later.

1055
01:10:56,526 --> 01:10:58,479
Timmy!

1056
01:10:58,579 --> 01:11:01,011
Timmy!

1057
01:11:01,111 --> 01:11:02,067
Come on.

1058
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:04,169
Beauty.

1059
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,312
Beauty.

1060
01:11:13,881 --> 01:11:15,883
All right.

1061
01:11:18,785 --> 01:11:20,788
(music playing)

1062
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:37,236
(singing)

1063
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:10,938
(music continues)

1064
01:12:46,754 --> 01:12:49,419
(continues)

1065
01:13:26,767 --> 01:13:29,553
(fades)

1066
01:13:29,653 --> 01:13:30,939
There they are.

1067
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,074
(sighing)

1068
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:33,242
Listen, man, fucking...

1069
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:34,642
- Well done.
- It sounds fucking brilliant.

1070
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,779
- Thanks a lot for your help.
- Lots of luck with those.

1071
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:38,215
- Nice one.
- I just pressed the buttons.

1072
01:13:38,315 --> 01:13:39,282
It was great.

1073
01:13:39,382 --> 01:13:40,516
Nice, man, thank you.

1074
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:42,486
- Cool.
- You two go and get some sleep.

1075
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:43,553
Right, nice one.

1076
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:46,972
- And thanks very, very much.
- See you.

1077
01:13:52,998 --> 01:13:54,533
So this is it.

1078
01:13:54,633 --> 01:13:56,501
- Yeah.
- We did it.

1079
01:13:56,601 --> 01:13:58,237
It sounds great.

1080
01:13:58,337 --> 01:13:59,471
It does, doesn't it?

1081
01:13:59,571 --> 01:14:00,640
Could I have one?

1082
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,075
- Yeah, yeah, totally.
- Thank you.

1083
01:14:02,175 --> 01:14:04,494
I've got to
go this way.

1084
01:14:04,594 --> 01:14:06,529
Really.

1085
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:08,532
Where you going?

1086
01:14:08,632 --> 01:14:10,584
Home.

1087
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,054
You don't want
to come back?

1088
01:14:13,154 --> 01:14:14,156
I'll make you breakfast.

1089
01:14:14,256 --> 01:14:15,790
- We could listen to the CD, no?
- No.

1090
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:19,228
I have to go see Ivonka
and organize things.

1091
01:14:19,328 --> 01:14:20,496
So do you.

1092
01:14:20,596 --> 01:14:21,631
Yeah.

1093
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:23,133
You're leaving.

1094
01:14:23,233 --> 01:14:25,185
To London.

1095
01:14:25,285 --> 01:14:26,670
What do you have
to organize?

1096
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:27,838
What's, what's that about?

1097
01:14:27,938 --> 01:14:30,809
I, I spoke to my
husband last night.

1098
01:14:30,909 --> 01:14:32,076
He's coming over.

1099
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,978
Ah, brilliant.
Fair play-That's great.

1100
01:14:34,078 --> 01:14:35,713
- I'm really happy for you.
- It's good. Yeah.

1101
01:14:35,813 --> 01:14:37,964
We'll try to
make it work.

1102
01:14:38,064 --> 01:14:39,285
It's for the best.

1103
01:14:39,385 --> 01:14:40,586
Yeah.

1104
01:14:40,686 --> 01:14:42,655
Come back and hang out,
have a cup of tea.

1105
01:14:42,755 --> 01:14:44,091
It's the last day.
We'll hang out.

1106
01:14:44,191 --> 01:14:46,702
Whatever, breakfast, whatever.

1107
01:14:46,802 --> 01:14:47,827
Listen to the tunes.

1108
01:14:47,927 --> 01:14:49,796
Or you can come over later,
whatever.

1109
01:14:49,897 --> 01:14:51,883
For what?

1110
01:14:51,983 --> 01:14:53,634
What do you mean, what?

1111
01:14:53,734 --> 01:14:55,669
Just hang, just come
and hang out.

1112
01:14:55,769 --> 01:14:57,306
But we done our work.

1113
01:14:57,406 --> 01:14:58,640
Why would I go over?

1114
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:01,718
We'd just hanky panky
If I come now.

1115
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:04,113
What?

1116
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:06,215
Hanky panky?

1117
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:08,618
It won't be for hanky panky.

1118
01:15:08,718 --> 01:15:10,721
I know it would.

1119
01:15:12,723 --> 01:15:15,475
And that would be nice.

1120
01:15:15,575 --> 01:15:16,695
Would it?

1121
01:15:16,795 --> 01:15:18,897
- Hanky... Would it?
- Very interesting.

1122
01:15:18,997 --> 01:15:21,993
Be worthless though.

1123
01:15:25,305 --> 01:15:28,277
Come back later.

1124
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:32,313
Mmm.

1125
01:15:36,117 --> 01:15:37,919
Okay, I'll come.

1126
01:15:38,019 --> 01:15:39,288
Yeah?

1127
01:15:39,388 --> 01:15:40,555
I'll come later, yeah.

1128
01:15:40,655 --> 01:15:42,024
Brilliant.

1129
01:15:42,124 --> 01:15:43,192
You sure?

1130
01:15:43,292 --> 01:15:44,560
Brilliant.

1131
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:45,694
All right, then...

1132
01:15:45,794 --> 01:15:47,663
Cool. See you after.
Well done.

1133
01:15:47,764 --> 01:15:49,766
You, too.

1134
01:16:38,823 --> 01:16:46,637
(music playing on tape)

1135
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,753
(ends)

1136
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:12,301
Well, what do you think?

1137
01:17:16,266 --> 01:17:18,383
You like it?

1138
01:17:18,483 --> 01:17:20,811
It's just a demo,
you know...

1139
01:17:20,911 --> 01:17:22,240
It's fucking brilliant.

1140
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,508
Really?

1141
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:25,561
Fantastic stuff.

1142
01:17:25,661 --> 01:17:28,565
That'll be a hit, no question.

1143
01:17:28,665 --> 01:17:31,129
When are you off?

1144
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:33,119
What?

1145
01:17:33,219 --> 01:17:35,855
Well, I've a few hundred quid
for you

1146
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:38,410
for a deposit on a place.

1147
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:40,461
Going to come over
and see you

1148
01:17:40,561 --> 01:17:42,563
when you're settled in.

1149
01:17:43,798 --> 01:17:47,032
When do you think
you'll be able to go?

1150
01:17:47,836 --> 01:17:49,738
I'm going tomorrow, Dad.

1151
01:17:49,838 --> 01:17:51,790
Good man.

1152
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:53,510
About time.

1153
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:55,613
(chuckles)

1154
01:17:57,514 --> 01:17:59,466
Will you be all right?

1155
01:17:59,566 --> 01:18:01,518
What do you mean?

1156
01:18:03,455 --> 01:18:07,692
I was all right for years
before you came along, wasn't I?

1157
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:10,061
I don't have to go now.
I can put this thing off

1158
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:11,897
- for a few months.
- Go.

1159
01:18:11,998 --> 01:18:13,499
And the best

1160
01:18:13,599 --> 01:18:15,234
of luck, son.

1161
01:18:15,334 --> 01:18:16,869
Thanks, Dad.

1162
01:18:16,969 --> 01:18:20,101
Make your ma proud.

1163
01:18:23,278 --> 01:18:25,179
Now play it again.

1164
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:28,514

Okay.

CATHERINE:
That's good.

1166
01:18:29,817 --> 01:18:31,287
Yeah. I recorded a few songs.

1167
01:18:31,387 --> 01:18:33,522
Oh, yeah? What are they like?

1168
01:18:33,623 --> 01:18:35,124
They're good.
I'm happy with them.

1169
01:18:35,224 --> 01:18:37,943
Great.

1170
01:18:38,043 --> 01:18:40,043
I've missed you.

1171
01:18:40,143 --> 01:18:42,280
Yeah, me, too.

1172
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,869
Do you want me
to meet you at the airport?

1173
01:18:44,969 --> 01:18:46,505
No. I'll come find you.

1174

(children shouting)

1175
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:51,030
I'm glad you've decided to come.

1176
01:18:53,413 --> 01:18:56,216
Listen, I'm going
to get cut off here, all right?

1177
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:58,499
Money's running out.

1178
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,019
Hurry up.

Hello, handsome.

Um, is-is herself in?

No, no.

Oh. Great.

(baby fussing)

1190
01:19:52,748 --> 01:19:54,783
You don't know
where she is, do you?

1191
01:19:54,883 --> 01:19:56,084
Uh, she's-she's working.

Uh, will you tell

Uh... Sorry.

1198

- You don't have a telephone?

1199
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,867
No telephone here, no.

1200
01:20:09,967 --> 01:20:11,135
Damn.

Yeah, sure.
