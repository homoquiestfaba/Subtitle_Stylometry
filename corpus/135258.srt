2
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,317
Only forgiveness will end his damnation...

3
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,926
and allow him to die.

4
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,300
Christ forgave.

5
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,737
And in the end. So must we all.

6
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,637
But I'll find you.

7
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,739
I'm counting on it.

8
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,059
Oh. Fuck.

9
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,604
Little boy lost. Far from home. Huh?

10
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,543
Shit.

11
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,132
I hate this. I hate this.

12
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,600
I really hate this.

13
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,648
Shit!

14
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:05,030
Time to bleed. Piggy-piggy.

15
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,447
You smell American.

16
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:20,885
Do you happen to know
Bernd and Elsa Krüger in Minneapolis?

17
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:25,822
Hurry up. Bruno. Stop playing
with your food like the last time.

18
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,951
This is the last time.

19
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,986
Argh!

20
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,363
Aaagh!

21
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,870
That was way too close. Man.

22
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,938
Next time you do the bleedin'.
I'll do the saving.

23
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,745
- I have questions.
- You want my confession?

24
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,117
Go to hell. Priest.

25
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,922
Count on the Germans
to always be on time.

26
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,256
I would do what he says.
He's in one of his moods.

27
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,058
- Tell me what I want to know.
- Fuck you!

28
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:42,761
Hey. This is hardly the time for negativity.

29
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,903
- Where's he gone?
- I can't tell you.

30
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,068
- Please... please.
- Train.

31
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,374
Last chance.

32
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,677
Where... is... he?

33
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,740
Train.

34
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,080
Big train.

35
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,252
I can't tell you.

36
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,950
OK. You two play. I'm gonna leave.

37
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,041
He's gone back to Romania.
Somewhere in the Carpathians.

38
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,078
His ancestral home.

39
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,114
That particular legend always
suited him best. Don't you think?

40
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,446
I will need very little to proceed.

41
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,918
Carnet. US currency. NATO clearances...

42
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:39,788
You get ahead of yourself. There's
something I wish to speak to you about.

43
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,185
- This time I'll finish him.
- Finish him?

44
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:48,290
We haven't heard from you in five years...
five years.

45
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,734
Then suddenly you show up
and ask for more support.

46
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,965
- I encountered certain...
- Listen to me.

47
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,838
...hardships. Your Eminence.

48
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,411
We hear rumors.

49
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,471
- Troubling things.
- What rumors?

50
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:09,112
That you have crossed certain boundaries
in pursuit of this beast.

51
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:13,022
That somehow he may have tainted you.

52
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,617
The Church has set me
to the task of ending him.

53
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,994
And by God's will. Nothing.
No obstacle - physical or otherwise -

54
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,228
shall stop me from executing this duty.

55
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,996
So I'm asking you now.

56
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,132
Do I continue to have your blessing in this

57
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,177
or have you lost your faith in me
completely?

58
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,737
We have no doubt that you are
the Lord's willing servant.

59
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:41,009
But it is you we pray for now.
You we fear for.

60
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,349
Me you fear...

61
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:48,359
I'm calling you back.
We can't afford to lose you.

62
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,627
The decision is final.

63
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,331
When we first knew each other.

64
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,769
You were a mere child. Remember?

65
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,740
You had survived a terrible ordeal.

66
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:06,266
And yet you had found
some peace in yourself.

67
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:11,009
All I'm asking is for you
to try and find that peace now.

68
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,574
We'll offer you any parish in the world.

69
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,780
Africa. America...

70
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,921
Anywhere you like.

71
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,744
I don't bless babies.

72
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,229
You thinkin' of joining the circus. D. G?

73
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,961
Oh. Wait. What am I saying?
You are the circus.

74
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,400
Hi. There.

75
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,349
What's everyone so afraid of
in broad daylight?

76
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,909
Collaborators with the dark ones.

77
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,252
Here. Everyone fears everyone.

78
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,414
You know. Even if we find
your friend. Elizabeth.

79
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,510
You may wish you hadn't.

80
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:33,183
It's not like I've got a choice.
I got her into this mess. I gotta get her out.

81
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,386
I think it's more than that.

82
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,123
I'm pretty sure
that's none of your business. D.G.

83
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,461
You're in love with her.

84
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,093
Only makes it worse. Denying it.

85
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,729
Well. Maybe I am... in love with her.

86
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,774
Maybe I'm like the knight or whatever.

87
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,275
Rescuing the princess
from the evil dude's castle.

88
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:55,177
I mean. How could she not fall in love
with someone like that. Right?

89
00:11:55,247 --> 00:12:00,241
It's funny how I wait till you're a defrocked
priest to get all confessional and shit.

90
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,928
Tell me something.

91
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:16,195
What does it mean - D. G?

92
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,095
Damaged goods.

93
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,265
It was either that or Buffy.

94
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,220
Elizabeth.

95
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,192
Come on. You can do this.

96
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,389
It is too late.

97
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:06,046
- Where were you?
- Visiting with one of the peacekeepers.

98
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,643
Oh. Nice hand cannon.

99
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,348
Take it.

100
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,983
I fear we may have more than
nocturnal predators to contend with.

101
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,459
What about you?

102
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,463
I don't like guns.

103
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,692
In Romania.
The NATO occupation continues

104
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,436
in an attempt to quell
the escalating civil war.

105
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:30,567
And now. Reporting on the rebels' current
demands. Is the EBC's Julia Hughes.

106
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,907
The rebels have now
repeated their seven demands

107
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,845
in a document submitted
to the Geneva Council.

108
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,507
Most curious was their requirement

109
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,450
that all current and prospective
government officials

110
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,353
make at least one public appearance
in daylight.

111
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:48,359
I asked Gabriel. The rebel leader.
To explain this one particular demand.

112
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:53,160
We have good and valid reasons.
More than that I cannot say.

113
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,998
We have business outside the city.

114
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:06,010
I'm sorry. Sir. Nobody passes
without proper documentation.

115
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,879
- There's gotta be someone we can talk to.
- That will be the captain. But he's not here.

116
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,250
Actually. Strike that. You may be in luck.
I think that's him.

117
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,659
Ils nous ont attaqués. Ils nous ont
attaqués à 51 kilométres d'ici.

118
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,960
Le capitaine. Je sais pas
qu'est-ce qui se passe avec lui...

119
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:31,492
They were attacked -
51 kilometers northeast of here.

120
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,934
Thought it was the rebels. But no guns.

121
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,008
No knives. Just...

122
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,773
Que des dents.
Des grandes dents. Tu comprends?

123
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,007
...teeth.

124
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,274
Big teeth.

125
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,916
D. G!

126
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,662
Mon capitaine!

127
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,428
I think he just got promoted.

128
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,852
Man. That was fuckin' nuts.

129
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:02,019
Those peacekeepers. They think
the problem's still with the insurgents.

130
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,995
They'll figure it out. Eventually.

131
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,069
- How come you never say his name?
- He has no name.

132
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,129
Uh... Then what's "Dracula"?

133
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:21,305
A conceit. He keeps returning to it
mostly because of the terror it inspires.

134
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,110
But the creature goes back
much further than that.

135
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,445
How much further?

136
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,452
The church has records -
incomplete and obscure -

137
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,318
but we know he's corrupted
every known faith in the world.

138
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,620
From Ancient Egypt. Rome.

139
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:38,026
Throughout Asia Minor.
East Indies. Central Africa...

140
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,691
He has as many names as he does faces.

141
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,496
All different. But all the same.

142
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,400
Utukku. Ekimmu.

143
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,201
Churel. Nelapsi.

144
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,264
Talamaur. Lampir.

145
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,546
He's woken from death so many times

146
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,878
I wonder if he even remembers
how he truly began.

147
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,214
Well. Do you know?

148
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,119
I mean. How he began.

149
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,959
It doesn't matter anymore.

150
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,862
What matters now is how he ends.

151
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,024
I hear that.

152
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,200
Over there.

153
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,932
Pull over.

154
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,356
These things weren't lit long ago.

155
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,552
Not long at all.

156
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,755
Well. What do you think they mean?
I mean...

157
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:54,569
No one knows we're coming. Right?
I mean. Those aren't for us. Are they?

158
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,268
Are they?

159
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,813
Great.

160
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,719
If they don't know by now.
They will soon enough.

161
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,684
I'll drive. You sleep.

162
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,260
Yeah. That's exactly
what I wanna do - sleep.

163
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,131
Who are the dudes with the guns?
Rebels?

164
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,665
None of our business. That's what they are.

165
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:51,819
- They're taking prisoners. Why?
- You don't wanna know.

166
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,352
- What are they doing with those people?
- Selling them for food.

167
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,417
Pull over!

168
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,521
Stopping will only
cost us time we don't have.

169
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,792
Pull over!

170
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,630
This is a mistake. I'm telling you now.

171
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,329
Luke. Wait!

172
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,611
Put it down. Hand it over slowly.

173
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,944
Hey. These are partisans.
Rebels who attack soldiers.

174
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,040
We arresting them. We are good.

175
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,377
Oh. Shit.

176
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,213
They are dangerous.

177
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,888
Tell your friends to put down their guns.

178
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,901
They won't do that.
Those people will shoot them.

179
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:41,495
Oh. Shit. OK. Um... You tell them
that they can keep their guns.

180
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,302
But they have to. Uh... leave the truck.

181
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,935
Without the truck they are going
to be hunted down by these pigs.

182
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,206
I don't really see why that's my problem.

183
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:54,909
Shit. OK. Um... They get to keep their guns
and keep the truck.

184
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,046
But they have to get rid of their ammo.
Yeah. That's it.

185
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,454
- Tell them to dump their clips right now.
- Man. This is...

186
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,889
Tell them to dump their clips right now

187
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:04,224
or I will spread your brains
like jam on fucking toast!

188
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,633
Yeah. Yeah.

189
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,371
Yeah. That's good.

190
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,284
She calls them "procurers".

191
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:30,719
Miserable cowards who procure
fresh blood for the Nosferatu

192
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,484
in exchange for their own lives.

193
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,788
- The bitch lies!
- Hey. Hey. Hey! You don't get to talk.

194
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,490
Because the undead cannot walk
in daylight. The procurers do their bidding.

195
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,293
That's convenient.

196
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,891
They do all the shopping
while the boss sleeps.

197
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,875
As the undead grow in numbers
and the living diminish.

198
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,035
They must seek blood
from further and further away.

199
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,410
Trafficking in blood is the only commerce
left in these villages.

200
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,743
That's why they're all fleeing.

201
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,943
Sounds more like a drug lord than Dracula.

202
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,112
There is very little difference.

203
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,983
- Your master. Where do we find him?
- I have no master.

204
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,303
This is ridiculous. Pigs and cattle!
Making stories. Always making stories.

205
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,805
Have you seen her?

206
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,604
What about you? I know you've seen her.
Is she with him?

207
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,239
- I haven't got my glasses.
- Look closer.

208
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,907
Oh. Yes. I have seen her.

209
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:35,180
But I'm not quite sure.
Because in that moment...

210
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,414
I was fucking her from behind.

211
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,153
Careful. We may need him.

212
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:49,100
See. It's a good thing we stopped.
We got ourselves a tour guide.

213
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,928
Yes. Very good thing we stopped.

214
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:23,559
Oh. I guess you would have just kept
driving. Not stopped to help those people.

215
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,933
Exactly.

216
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:29,235
- And you call yourself a priest.
- Not anymore.

217
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:32,743
Great. So. Uh... the bad guys
have rocket launchers.

218
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:36,042
I have some croquet stakes. And you don't
even have God on your side anymore.

219
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,742
You wanna go back. Go back.
You wanna stay. Stay.

220
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:43,151
- I know what it is that I have to do.
- What? Like I don't?

221
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,791
Am I goin' the right way?
If I'm storming off in the wrong direction.

222
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,193
I'm gonna be really pissed off.

223
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,668
- Uffizi...
- What?

224
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:11,272
You don't really look like an Uffizi.
How'd you get a name like that anyway?

225
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,611
Came with the job.

226
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,414
So. Like. If I get the same job.
I would get a cool name like that?

227
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,441
It's like the day after the Alamo.

228
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,566
Sun's going.

229
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,731
Let's do what must be done.

230
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,387
I don't know. Man.

231
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,195
What do we do when there's
no one left to save?

232
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,699
Someone's still alive.

233
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,911
What is that?

234
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,714
Get the boy.

235
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,314
Hey. Kid!

236
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,609
Tommy? Tommy!

237
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,944
- Get the hell away from me.
- It's all right. I'm not one of them.

238
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:35,953
It attacked us! A stinking beast!
We're fucking EBC!

239
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,445
Ohh... Tommy!

240
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,257
Don't!

241
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,625
Who are you? What do you want?
Where the hell are we?

242
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,493
Which question
do you want me to answer first?

243
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:50,000
- Julia. Let's just get the hell out of here.
- We can't just leave Vallon.

244
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,799
Fuck Vallon! Useless motherfucker
couldn't even fly a chopper!

245
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,400
I'm here to help you.

246
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,966
Mami.

247
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,373
Hey! Kid! Get away from there.

248
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,810
That's not your mother.
Get away from there.

249
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,744
Mami.

250
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,425
No!

251
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,851
I don't wanna do this.

252
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,393
Don't wanna do this...

253
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,452
I can't do this.

254
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,658
I can't do this.

255
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,614
Vallon got us out.

256
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,517
We were trying to reach Bucharest.

257
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,480
But the power failed and...

258
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,016
He managed to autorotate this thing...

259
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,153
God knows how.

260
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,563
And. Uh... he saved us.

261
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,537
He's gonna die. Isn't he?

262
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,674
You need to take your friend
inside that church and stay there.

263
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,740
Vallon...

264
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:24,353
There's nothing you can do here.

265
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:53,013
- It's OK. Tommy. Just breathe. Don't be...
- I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

266
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,382
Don't be sorry. Sh...

267
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,580
Who the fuck are you?

268
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,555
That's a good question.

269
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,159
Who are you?

270
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:05,924
Hey. You're that. Uh...
that news reporter lady. Right?

271
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,697
Yeah.

272
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,565
Julia Hughes with the... with the EBC.

273
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:16,835
And this is. Um...
this is Tommy Tunnicliffe. My cameraman.

274
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,409
- I'm Luke. I'm with...
- Yeah. We met.

275
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,243
Well... Luke...

276
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,912
We came to cover the civil war
from the rebels' point of view.

277
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:36,182
Oh. God... God. We had no idea.

278
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,092
Well...

279
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,221
Yeah.

280
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,802
Nobody does.

281
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:00,715
May the Lord God
have mercy upon your soul.

282
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,486
May he forgive all your sins in this life.

283
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,149
And release you from suffering.

284
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,321
Amen.

285
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,985
- The rebel leader. Gabriel...
- Hang on. It's just after this.

286
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:50,797
...accused NATO of supporting a shadow
government run by agents of darkness.

287
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:55,396
This is where they attacked us.

288
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,742
Christ. You can't see a damn one of them.

289
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,475
But they were there. I swear it.
All around us.

290
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,310
Tearing through these people
like I don't know what...

291
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,686
- I believe you.
- Vallon got us out of there.

292
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,952
Shoved us into the chopper.

293
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,227
Five more seconds
and we'd have been like chew biscuits.

294
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,528
Five more seconds...

295
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,292
Isn't that right. Julia?

296
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,639
Julia?

297
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:48,681
- You shouldn't be here.
- And you should?

298
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:56,595
Did you... Did you say something?

299
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,066
Yes.

300
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,604
But maybe you wanna add something.

301
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,401
I wouldn't know what to say.

302
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,699
A prayer. Anything.

303
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:12,947
I can only remember one that I used to say
when I was a little girl.

304
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,617
It'll do fine.

305
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:24,728
"From... ghoulies and ghosties

306
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,198
and long-leggety beasties

307
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:35,066
- and things that go bump in the night... "
- "Good Lord. Deliver us. "

308
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:39,200
Thank you.

309
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,614
- Julia!
- Over here.

310
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,314
- Did you see that?
- Yes.

311
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,755
- Who are you?
- Long story.

312
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,994
Julia!

313
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,766
Tommy. Wait!

314
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,972
Julia!

315
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,608
Julia?

316
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,696
Tommy!

317
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,440
Luke!

318
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,041
D. G!

319
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,789
- One of them got Tommy.
- Take her back inside.

320
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,053
God... Come on...

321
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,067
- Wait!
- What? What?

322
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,466
- Shit.
- What?

323
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,836
- What. Luke?
- I closed those doors.

324
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,932
Well... maybe they blew open.

325
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,172
It's impossible.
They weigh about 800 pounds each.

326
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,748
Do you think there's something in there?
Careful.

327
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,018
Luke...

328
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,059
Julia!

329
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,031
Move!

330
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,988
Are you OK? He didn't get you?

331
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,395
No. I don't think so.

332
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:16,855
Shit.

333
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,675
Argh!

334
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,025
Tommy?

335
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,381
Let me in!

336
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,983
- It's me. Tommy.
- Oh. My God! It's Tommy.

337
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,756
- Wait. Julia.
- Open up. Let me in!

338
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,229
It's Tommy. Tommy.

339
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:04,199
- Julia. Wait.
- Let me in. Open the door now!

340
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,091
Tommy?

341
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,970
No. It's the Queen Mum stopped by
for a swift half. Now let me in!

342
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,701
What's going on out there? Where's Uffizi?

343
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:17,077
Some clown on stilts tried to
drain me like a juice bag.

344
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,878
Your mate's gone to look for him.

345
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,750
I got away. Oh. Christ!
Something's coming! Let me in!

346
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,789
- Luke. Please!
- Let me the fuck in!

347
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,324
- Tommy...
- Oh. For God's sake!

348
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,990
Let me in!

349
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,490
Lock those.

350
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:42,638
I've never seen anything like it.
You should have seen its face.

351
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:45,436
- It was like nothing I've ever seen.
- Tommy...

352
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:49,036
Tommy. Listen to me. Look.
You're burning up. Are you OK?

353
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,082
- Are you OK?
- I don't know what's the matter.

354
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,310
- I feel sick.
- What is it?

355
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,979
I feel sick. But in a good way!

356
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,648
Argh!

357
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,822
Asshole.

358
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,865
Tommy!

359
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:33,645
Silver. Holy water. Church bells.

360
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,224
These things hate 'em.

361
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,428
Oh. God...

362
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,674
What is that?

363
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,840
- The morning purge.
- What?

364
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,836
Yeah...

365
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:08,016
- Nice wheels.
- And what a deal.

366
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,757
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

367
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:20,753
You can't just drive up here saying "Good
morning" like you're the bloody postman.

368
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:24,494
Tell me. Where'd you
take off from last night?

369
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:32,202
I don't know. I'd guess it was about... 80
kilometers north-northeast of Sibiu. Why?

370
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,834
- North of Sibiu.
- Yeah.

371
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,902
- Along what route?
- Well. It's hard to say.

372
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,438
The deeper into these mountains you get.
The more arbitrary the maps become.

373
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:43,043
At a certain point. It's almost like
they were drawn from pure guesswork.

374
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,782
Yeah. By people who are smart enough
not to go up there.

375
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,915
Well. We would never
have found the rebels

376
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,085
if we hadn't have spotted
their signal fires from the chopper.

377
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,391
Did you see anything else?
A road. Dwellings? Ruins of any kind?

378
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:57,457
Oh. No. Look. It was dark.
The peaks were jagged.

379
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:01,368
You could hide most of Manhattan
in one of those rifts. For God's sake.

380
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,838
Oh. God...

381
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:10,270
Just what is it. Uh...
you two intend to do. Anyway?

382
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,585
Don't ask. Right?

383
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,456
This thing will hopefully get you to the city.

384
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:27,224
Then from there the NATO boys
should be able to get you back to London.

385
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:32,257
And. Uh... just what am I supposed to say
once I get home?

386
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:36,466
You'll think of something.
Isn't that why you get paid the big bucks?

387
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:41,876
Well... I always thought it was
my quirky nose and reassuring smile.

388
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:44,277
- Be safe.
- Thanks.

389
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,650
You're both completely insane.
You know that?

390
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,659
I'm afraid so.

391
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,721
Thanks again.

392
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,560
Drive safely. Get home.

393
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:12,671
You're a... fascinating man. Uffizi.

394
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:16,304
Luke does most of the work.
I just supervise.

395
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:23,085
Just... one peek behind the curtain
before I go.

396
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:28,047
Oh... Oh. I'm sorry. I. Um... I'm sorry.

397
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,858
Goodbye. Julia.

398
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,390
Yeah. Bye.

399
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,432
So. Padre.

400
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:17,099
Did I catch a little something
between you and Miss EBC back there?

401
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,768
I knew it.

402
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:22,971
There's no need to be
embarrassed about it. Man.

403
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,640
You're not a priest anymore.

404
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,048
I say. When this whole thing's over.
You look her up.

405
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,780
There should be a fork
in the road up ahead. Go left.

406
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,695
- What the hell?
- Don't stop!

407
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,174
Are you all right?

408
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:56,076
Oh. No. I'm a friend. I'm a friend.
No. No. No. I'm a friend.

409
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,547
I'm a friend. I'm a friend.
Don't worry about it. Don't...

410
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:01,982
Uffizi. Tell her I'm a friend.

411
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:04,850
- Hey. Luke. Get back here.
- Uffizi. Tell her.

412
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,254
- Luke...
- Tell her. Uffizi. Tell her I'm a friend.

413
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,792
Luke. Come on.

414
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:13,393
Oh. Shit.

415
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:24,601
Your compassion's gonna kill us.

416
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,836
Uh. I think we found our rebels.

417
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,960
Anyone up for some croquet?

418
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,466
- Why have you come here?
- Because we share the same enemy.

419
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,365
And who might that be?

420
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,337
Our parliament? The cabinet?

421
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:05,500
The Ministry of National Defense?
Public Justice?

422
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,941
Or maybe the Ministry
of Health and Family?

423
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:12,914
Or were you suggesting NATO?
The Americans. Perhaps?

424
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:15,315
Uh... Try Dracula.

425
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,347
Dracula?

426
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,016
Dracula does not exist.

427
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,694
He's a fiction. Gypsy myth.

428
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,356
Tourist prattle. Bedtime stories.
Do not mock us.

429
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:30,457
- He is real.
- You think so?

430
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,094
I know so.

431
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:44,514
So perhaps you do know
what you speak of after all.

432
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:48,073
Tell me. How is it you can walk in daylight?

433
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,120
- I'm fighting the infection.
- That's impossible.

434
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,179
Some days I have to agree.

435
00:49:53,957 --> 00:50:00,089
I'm sorry. In our present situation
we can't afford to take any chances.

436
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,860
- You must understand...
- Wait.

437
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:09,603
You can trust them. Gabriel.

438
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,402
- Julia. What are you...
- What. Luke?

439
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,703
Why didn't I go to the London bureau

440
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:17,770
and file a report on vampires
taking over the government of Romania?

441
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,682
- I almost feel safer here.
- You're insane. You know that?

442
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,777
No.

443
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,846
I'm just a journalist
in need of an airtight story.

444
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:31,292
I realized that about 30 seconds
after you gentlemen left me in the dust.

445
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,022
Put them in the stockade for the night.

446
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:36,123
Why do I have to be in here?
I'm not diseased.

447
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,793
In case your friend gets hungry.

448
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,841
You're a strange man.

449
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,878
Either a hero or a demon.
I'm not sure which.

450
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:52,676
- But come dawn. You are free to go.
- Tell me. Where can we find him?

451
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:56,207
Just follow the slaughter. He'll find you.

452
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:04,423
You'll let me know if you're gonna
slip over the edge. Right?

453
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,155
Right?

454
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,356
Don't worry. You'll know.

455
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,449
What's goin' on?

456
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:42,128
Oh. Jesus. They're inside.
Where's Julia?

457
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,613
The key...

458
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,689
- Julia!
- Quiet.

459
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:10,953
Shit. This is not good. Man.

460
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,457
Hold on! Hold on. I've got the keys.

461
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:18,092
- How many are there?
- I didn't stop for a head count. I'm afraid.

462
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:19,999
- You two stay here.
- No...

463
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,164
No fucking... way.

464
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,639
No. You can't this to us again.

465
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:28,906
Stay away from the door. I'll come back
when I've found a way out.

466
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,641
- In case I'm not back by dawn.
- Wait!

467
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,706
Oh. Shit.

468
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,910
Oh. God...

469
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,819
- Give me the keys.
- No. You heard what he said. No.

470
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:18,691
I think he's got 'em on the run. Though.
And that's when I'm at my best. So here.

471
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:21,026
Maybe we should just wait.

472
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,217
Luke.

473
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,327
Here. Take them.

474
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,342
- Oh. God. What if that's Uffizi?
- It's impossible.

475
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:45,074
- What makes you so sure?
- Because if it is. We are screwed.

476
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:46,581
Oh. God.

477
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:20,810
Every day. I wonder if I can
still burn out the infection.

478
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,708
And when I'll finally be like them.

479
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,588
You'll never be like them.

480
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:40,060
Maybe I already am.

481
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,121
No.

482
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,332
No.

483
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:14,159
Hey. Guys! Over here!

484
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,331
D. G... check it out.

485
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,730
Looks like our tour guide's back in action.

486
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:28,005
Do you think he's got the hookup
with the big guy himself or what?

487
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,865
Oh. My...

488
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:08,766
This... He will suffer for this.

489
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:17,717
Take her back. Luke.

490
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,311
- No.
- I don't think so.

491
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,584
Go. Get out of here now. Both of you.

492
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:26,525
I didn't travel nine billion miles
to turn back now. It's not gonna happen.

493
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:29,963
- This is not your fight.
- He has Elizabeth. That makes it my fight.

494
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,024
Elizabeth is gone!

495
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:37,765
Whatever you find. It won't be her.

496
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:40,966
It won't be.

497
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:44,377
Take Julia.
Get out of here if you still can.

498
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:49,111
Look. Julia can make her own decisions.
And Julia's sticking with the program. OK?

499
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:56,251
Whatever is beyond there.
I won't be able to protect either of you.

500
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:59,718
I won't.

501
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:04,828
You're committing yourselves to death.
Or worse.

502
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:10,238
Well. I had that pretty much figured out
when we left the train station in Bucharest.

503
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:11,830
So...

504
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,110
Look. I... I'm going with you.

505
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,850
Whoa! This cat's got something for TV.

506
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:01,152
He's got dishes all over the place.

507
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:06,052
I see several guards. A few procurers.

508
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,559
I don't think our odds are
gonna get any better than that.

509
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,793
What about our friend? Do you see him?

510
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:14,632
- Don't see him.
- Look harder. He should be with them.

511
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:25,737
- Son of a bitch!
- No!

512
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:34,047
I could kill you both.
But then you would be worthless to me.

513
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,223
No... Luke!

514
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:42,094
And above all else.
I'm a competent businessman.

515
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:44,462
No! Luke!

516
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:49,127
Maybe you'll thank me.
Then again. Maybe you won't.

517
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,194
No...

518
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,255
Julia!

519
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,161
Julia!

520
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:36,481
This place is a fucking slaughterhouse.

521
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,782
Come on.

522
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,448
Agh!

523
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:18,159
Shit.

524
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,065
Julia.

525
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:48,546
Julia?

526
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:53,146
The lady and I have been waiting.

527
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,251
Julia?

528
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:03,755
Come on. Have a sip of her.

529
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:08,293
Not too sweet. Just a hint of spice.

530
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,862
Lingers on the palate.

531
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:15,968
Prolonged maceration adds complexity
to the most common vintage.

532
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,070
Starvation makes it blue.

533
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:21,378
- Where's Julia?
- Julia... Julia...

534
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:25,944
- What have you done with Elizabeth?
- Elizabeth...

535
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:29,753
Yes. Mm... Yes. Nice little body.

536
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,417
Nice bouquet.

537
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:37,497
Tell me what you've done with Elizabeth!
Where is she?

538
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:50,311
You must be longing for her.

539
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,041
Do you want her?

540
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,480
How?

541
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:03,485
Pure and innocent?

542
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:08,389
Do I remember you?

543
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:11,295
Yes.

544
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:14,336
The coroner's little sidekick.

545
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,667
The one who steals the dead.

546
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:18,330
Ooh!

547
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:22,138
There are no dead here.

548
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:25,078
Just the fucked-up dead.

549
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:29,584
The never-ending dying.
Waiting for the end of time.

550
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:33,322
I used to live for this moment.

551
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:37,451
- You're not worthy.
- Let me see Elizabeth first.

552
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:39,517
- You're asking me a favor?
- Yeah.

553
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:42,894
You want me to forget how I was
made to suffer because of you.

554
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:45,263
Tortured and degraded? Huh?

555
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:49,660
I should rip your heart out

556
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,435
and feed it to the dogs.

557
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:58,640
"Because an old dog
needs a special diet just for him. "

558
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:01,478
- Where is she?
- Gone. To you.

559
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,541
No. She's gone to you.

560
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:07,919
Too much of a good thing
takes away your edge.

561
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:12,188
You really wanna see her?
You think you have the stomach for it?

562
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,092
Oh...

563
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:21,229
She has found the taking of innocent blood
to be unbearable.

564
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:24,101
She's addicted to her sisters now.

565
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:29,437
Her mind is consumed by conscience.

566
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:32,774
Oh!

567
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:37,015
She will go mad soon.

568
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:41,517
Unless you think you can save her.

569
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:54,903
Be careful.

570
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:58,439
They will bite.

571
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:07,146
Jesus.

572
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,061
Elizabeth?

573
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:05,973
Elizabeth.

574
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:20,322
Elizabeth?

575
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,491
Elizabeth.

576
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:31,465
Elizabeth. Hey. It's me. It's Luke.

577
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:33,559
It's me.

578
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,297
It's Luke.

579
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:36,861
Yeah.

580
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:43,972
I've come to take you out of here. OK? OK?

581
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:46,742
Let's go. I wanna get you outta here.
Come on.

582
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:16,677
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

583
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:22,080
I'm so sorry for getting you into this.
I'm so sorry.

584
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,951
You came all this way...

585
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:30,992
You know how long
I've been looking for you?

586
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,325
You came all this way to save me.

587
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,396
I love you.

588
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:44,566
No!

589
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:55,904
Luke? Luke?

590
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:04,346
You know.
Even if we find your friend.

591
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,445
You may wish you hadn't.

592
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:09,582
I'm so sorry...

593
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:15,190
I love you...

594
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:22,904
$30 million...

595
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:26,270
$30 million for the secret of eternal life.

596
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:37,450
Luke?

597
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,010
Get up here. Luke.

598
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:49,764
There's someone coming. OK?

599
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:08,583
And still no word on the whereabouts
of EBC correspondent. Julia Hughes.

600
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,117
And her camera crew.

601
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:13,882
Wreckage of their helicopter has been
located in the village of Bistrita.

602
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,754
But no bodies have yet been found
at the crash site.

603
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:19,089
NATO peacekeepers
are continuing the search.

604
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:21,391
The Romanian consul general
has offered his help

605
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:23,658
in determining
what happened to the TV crew

606
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:27,725
in the hours after their rendezvous
with rebel leaders in the north.

607
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:30,738
A nightly fixture of households
throughout Europe.

608
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:34,173
Ms. Hughes is truly one of the most
respected and beloved personalities

609
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:35,904
in all of broadcasting.

610
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:39,141
NATO peacekeepers are continuing...

611
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:43,082
Her disappearance has already intensified
scrutiny into rumored atrocities

612
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:45,416
within the insular Romanian republic.

613
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:52,416
Nocturnal attacks from unseen guerilla
forces have continued to plague villages...

614
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,873
Do I have news for you?

615
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:21,117
At night. When normal people
sit in front of their TVs watching you.

616
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:26,822
My little angels are giving birth
in growing numbers.

617
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:35,165
Changing the course
and destiny of mankind.

618
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:38,802
Or something like that.

619
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:02,825
Argh! Aargh!

620
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:09,869
But... you're... dead.

621
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:11,701
I know.

622
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:18,536
Depressed?

623
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,181
Uffizi!

624
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:27,788
You're very pretty on TV.
But even more beautiful in the flesh.

625
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:30,689
The dress becomes you. Don't you think?

626
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:32,954
It used to belong to my favorite bride.

627
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:35,758
Is this your idea of seduction?

628
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:39,528
Seduction?

629
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,997
I don't think so.

630
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:46,524
I thought I lost you.

631
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:53,238
Close your eyes.

632
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:07,787
Come. Father.

633
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:13,258
We are in heaven.

634
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:15,660
Hallow is my middle name.

635
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:22,968
The last time we met you were
generous enough to grant me absolution.

636
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:26,838
But only through God's forgiveness
can I truly die.

637
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:31,473
I wonder. Are you ready to forgive me?

638
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:35,843
Do you even speak with God's authority
anymore?

639
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:38,112
In the name of the Almighty Father.

640
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:41,019
His Blessed Son. And the Holy Spirit...

641
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:48,689
you are forgiven.

642
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:55,667
Until... death do us part.

643
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:59,969
You know. I never felt this alive
in a thousand years.

644
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:02,742
Yah!

645
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:14,250
Yes!

646
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:16,790
You can still save her. You know.

647
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:18,849
Have all you've been denied.

648
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:20,861
But are you worthy?

649
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:40,982
Surrender!

650
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:51,989
Argh!

651
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:00,098
Surrender to me.

652
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,398
Brother.

653
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:17,184
Will you bless me?

654
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,486
Will you take away the pain

655
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:23,752
for all the little angels
who gave their body and soul?

656
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:29,161
Will you take betrayal.
Blasphemy. The plague?

657
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:32,632
Will you take away the hills of time?

658
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:37,068
Don't fail me now.

659
01:19:42,577 --> 01:19:44,101
Agh!

660
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:49,177
- Fuck you.
- Too late now.

661
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:28,155
Consider yourself... forgiven.

662
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:24,943
It's over...

663
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:30,049
almost.

664
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:43,187
No.

665
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,561
No. You can't do this.

666
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,466
No.

667
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:52,099
But you can.

668
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:57,839
- There's gotta be something we can do.
- You came all this way to save me.

669
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:03,511
- And you will.
- There's gotta be some other way.

670
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:11,585
You're dying. Julia.

671
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:18,859
Is there anything...
anything you want to confess?

672
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:25,037
I've had impure thoughts...

673
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:28,265
about you.

674
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:35,475
As I have... about you.

675
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,777
Well...

676
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:44,819
If that doesn't damn us both to hell.
Then what does?

677
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:53,327
I don't think... I don't think
I've seen you smile before.

678
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:57,631
It looks good.

679
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:50,751
Please...

680
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:52,417
Don't...

681
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:54,322
...let me...

682
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:55,795
...die.

683
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:57,425
...die.

684
01:25:00,562 --> 01:25:02,359
Sun's up.

685
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:05,292
We should get going.

686
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:10,329
In a moment.
