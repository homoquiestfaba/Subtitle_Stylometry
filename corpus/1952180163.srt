You did...

19
00:01:19,023 --> 00:01:21,591
Wrong.

20
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:26,930
We're always given a choice,
ladies and gentlemen,

21
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:30,000
Whether to walk the path
of the straight and narrow,

22
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:33,203
Or to succumb
to temptation.

23
00:01:33,237 --> 00:01:36,540
Do i write the essay myself

24
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:40,210
Or do i copy it verbatim
from wikipedia?

25
00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:42,279
Not that bright,
van olsen.

26
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,549

Leads to prison

out in the hall, please?

37
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:21,084
No talking.

38
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:29,426
What the hell did you do
to get detention?

39
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,461
Nothing.

40
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:35,665
Powell called mrs. butchik

41
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,467
"mrs. buttcheeks."

42
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:40,770
Butchik is her
given name, son.

43
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:42,939
- you shouldn't make fun.
- powell said it, not me.

44
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:44,741
Who is powell?
this guy?

45
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,676
<i>yeah.</i>

46
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:48,745
Why are you here?

47
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:50,614
Just hanging with him.

48
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:53,450
All right, let me
get this straight,
you didn't get detention.

49
00:02:53,484 --> 00:02:56,987
You just decided to spend
the afternoon hanging out

50
00:02:57,021 --> 00:03:00,524
In detention with
this kid powell.

51
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:02,526
Yeah, we're friends.

52
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:08,331
What, dad?

53
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:10,300
I don't know.
you know...

54
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:12,636
- are you homophobic?
- what are you talking about?

55
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,172
I'm asking you questions
about your life.

56
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:17,107
Come on.

57
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:20,944
I don't get to see you
that much these days.

58
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:22,712
Powell's not into
labels, dad.

59
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,781
And quite frankly,
neither am i.

60
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:27,117
Okay, damester.

- hi, patty.

67
00:03:55,513 --> 00:03:58,882
It's me, tanya.

68
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:02,652
Why are you calling me?

69
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:04,487
I wanted to follow up
about your, um...

70
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:07,691
Appointment with
the happiness consultant.

71
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:11,761
I'm working on
the hollopaw deal right now.

72
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:15,432
I know.  i didn't
want to bother you,
but how was it?

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,169
- i don't want
to talk about it.
- why not?

74
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:21,671
Just let it die,
okay, tanya?

75
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,013
Patty, i don't understand.

76
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:33,016
If by your own assertion
the sex was great,

77
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,584
Then shouldn't you
be happy?

78
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:38,154
Have you ever
done coke, tanya?

79
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,156
Cocaine?

80
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:41,825
Uh, no.

81
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:43,727
I tried peyote
a couple of times.

82
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:46,396
Well, having sex with that
guy is like doing coke.

83
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,033
It's expensive,
but you really want it,

84
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:53,703
So you buy it and then you
get this huge awesome rush.

85
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:56,940
That's a good thing, right?
a huge awesome rush.

86
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:59,309
But then you come down
from your high

87
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,113
And you're broke
and you feel even lonelier
and more pathetic

88
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:05,415
Than you did before
and you want to
kill yourself.

89
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,718
So i guess you won't
be interested

90
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:11,188
In our bimonthly package?

91
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:14,124
I'm kidding.
patty, look, wait.

92
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:17,827
Seriously, what would
make you interested in
being a repeat customer?

93
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:19,396
I don't know.

94
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,465
- maybe if he was like crack.
- crack?

95
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,435
Yeah, cheap, dirty,
same high at half the price.

96
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:31,441
I think my kid's a gay.

97
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:34,177
- damon?
- yeah.

99
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,781
Well, that's great, ray.

100
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:41,718
I mean, don't worry.
lots of kids experiment
with their sexuality.

101
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:44,020
I myself, i had
a little thing

102
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:46,256
With this woman
miriam in college--

103
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,825
Hey, i don't need
to hear about your
lesbian past, tanya.

104
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,862
We're having
a business meeting.
this is business.

105
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:55,065
Then i'm gonna be
honest with you, ray.

106
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:57,834
We are encountering a little

107
00:05:57,869 --> 00:06:00,537
<i>pushback in our pricing.</i>

108
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:02,205
I think we might
need to consider

109
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:04,508
Lowering our pricing point,

110
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:07,344
Maybe offering
a sliding scale

111
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:09,546
To our lower
income clients.

112
00:06:09,614 --> 00:06:12,182
What are you talking about?
when we started this thing

113
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:14,518
It was you that said we were
gonna clear two grand a night.

114
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:16,853
- i know.
i know i said that.

117
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:23,560

00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:43,180
My boyfriend.

126
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:44,548
He had to go on a trip.

127
00:06:44,582 --> 00:06:46,416
See? that's what
i'm talking about.

128
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,784
What?

129
00:06:47,818 --> 00:06:50,253
You. you spend all your
time with this new boyfriend,

130
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:52,355
Meanwhile our business
is falling apart.

131
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,391
All my time?
what are you talking about?

132
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:57,761
How can i be spending
all my time with my new
boyfriend when he's in cuba?

133
00:06:57,795 --> 00:06:59,963
Now, ray,
i know you're upset

134
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:02,299
About damon's homosexual
tendencies--

135
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:05,402
Hey hey, i promised my kids
they could move back in.

136
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:08,738
The two grand from jemma
is a drop in the bucket.

137
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:11,107

gonna fix itself.

00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,882
I'm trying, ray.
i'm really trying.

141
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,118
These are turbulent times.

142
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:28,091
Ray, i don't think
it sounds right when you say
"my kid's a gay."

143
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,894
Just, "my kid's gay."

144
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:34,965
Why didn't you tell me?

145
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:36,700
There's nothing to tell.

146
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:38,869
You didn't seem
that interested.

147
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:42,539
I thought you were
too obsessed with hammer
to notice anything anyway.

148
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:47,811
Have you had sex
with him yet?

149
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:53,416
- damon.
- what's it to you, darb?

150
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:56,987
You're my twin brother.
why wouldn't you want
to tell me?

151
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:58,655
Why do you want
to know so bad?

152
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:01,992
Because i care.
come on.

153
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:09,299
All right, i haven't
had sex with him.

154
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,001
Yet.

155
00:08:12,637 --> 00:08:16,173
Wait, do you want to?

156
00:08:19,143 --> 00:08:20,644
It's okay.
don't worry.

157
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:23,146
I mean, guys are
really easy to please.

158
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:26,449
Go!  come on,
you're almost there, guys.

159
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:30,554
I give 'em 10 bucks
every time they reach the top.

160
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:32,122
It's my secret
weight-loss plan.

161
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:34,224
Sounds good.

162
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:37,661
Don't worry, i gave up
pilates to pay for it.

163
00:08:37,695 --> 00:08:39,696
It doesn't matter.

164
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,831
Of course it matters.

165
00:08:45,703 --> 00:08:48,305
I don't need things.

166
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:51,942
Material stuff.

167
00:08:51,976 --> 00:08:54,711
Ron, what do i have to do
to make you believe me?

168
00:08:56,714 --> 00:08:59,583
Why did you and your mother
go through my stuff?

169
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:03,720
What did you think
you were looking for?

170
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,789
Did you think
i was lying to you?

171
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:07,524
Where you worried
that i was broke?

172
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:09,826
It was a moment
of weakness.

173
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:13,363
I don't care
about the money.

174
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:15,198
What about
your ex-husband?

175
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:18,335
I do not care
about him either.

176
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:22,572
I love you, ron.

177
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:27,744
( sighs )

178
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:30,747
I just want things
to be normal again.

179
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,084
How do we be normal?

180
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:37,921
I passed signs
for that sale you love.

181
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:39,823
The timson bank sale.

182
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:41,424
- what about it?
- i want you to go.

183
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:43,593
No, we can't
afford it, ron.

184
00:09:43,594 --> 00:09:45,061
Look at me.

185
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:48,098
I'm tired of our lives

186
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:50,400
Being reduced to
how much money we have.

187
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:52,602
I'm sick of it.
so what?

188
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:54,371
We took a hit.
everybody did.

189
00:09:54,405 --> 00:09:56,439
Now go.
i want you to go
to the sale.

190
00:09:56,474 --> 00:09:59,242
I want you
to buy something.
be happy.

191
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:03,747
For me.

192
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,718
It's this amazing
new service

193
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:10,453
A friend of mine runs.

194
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:12,856
For male prostitutes?

195
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,292
Isn't that
kind of gross?

196
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:18,295
Not at all.
i think you would
feel empowered.

197
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:20,397
I know i did.

198
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:22,599
I don't know.

199
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:27,904
Well, i know patty
felt empowered too.

200
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,143
Great.

201
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:36,613
It's a progressive service.
it's very sensitive.

202
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:38,949
In no way dirty.

203
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:40,884
Unless you like dirty.

204
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:43,353
She said it was
like doing coke.

205
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:45,455
I've never tired
coke myself.

206
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:47,958
I did peyote
a couple times.

207
00:10:47,992 --> 00:10:50,427
I know the economy
is collapsing,

208
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,662
But heck, when you look
back at your life

209
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:55,065
Do you really want to say
to yourself, "damn it!

210
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:59,002
I was such a fuddy-duddy.
i never once paid for sex.

211
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:01,638
Not even once."

212
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:10,914
Good boy.
oh yes, that's a good boy.

213
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:12,649
Hello.
hi.

214
00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:15,852
Wow, you have a dog?
what's its name?

215
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:18,288
Patty.

216
00:11:18,322 --> 00:11:21,324
Horny patty, actually.

217
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:24,261
You named your dog
horny patty?

218
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:26,096
Yeah, i did.

219
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,665
Wonder why i'd do that?
any ideas?

220
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:31,768
Lenore, are you mad at me?
is that why you asked
me to lunch?

221
00:11:31,802 --> 00:11:34,604
I do have a little bone
to pick with you, t-brain.

222
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,374
I ran into horny patty
at the mall

223
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,610
And she told me
that you told her

224
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:44,581
That happiness consultants
was my escort service.

225
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:47,317
You're using my name
to hawk your product.

226
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:49,986
Lenore, in that one instance
i did use your name.

227
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:53,123
- i'm sorry.
- well, you owe me one.

228
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:55,959
So how is business
anyway?

229
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:58,695
Business is brisk.

230
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:00,230
I'll bet.

231
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:02,833
I was thinking i could
use a little ray
myself, actually.

232
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:05,502
You mean randall.

233
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:07,003
No, i mean ray.

234
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:09,306
I d his wallet, tanya.
i know his name.

235
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,143
Lenore, ray's dance card
is very full.

236
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:16,680
Okay, well, why don't
you just send me over
one of your other guys?

237
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:20,584
You don't have any other
guys, do you, t-brain?

238
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:24,154
No, you just have the one.

239
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:26,489
Lenore, i'm in the process
of building a stable

240
00:12:26,524 --> 00:12:28,258
Of qualified professionals.

241
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:29,893
Don't bullshit
a bullshitter.

242
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:33,563
You're smart.
you do one thing
and you do it well.

243
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:35,131
Ray's a hot commodity.

244
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,602
He's the right age,
he's got a big fat dick

245
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:40,103
And he knows
how to use it.

246
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:42,138
Send him over tonight.

247
00:12:43,774 --> 00:12:47,477
Lenore, you stole his wallet
and his underwear.

248
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:51,414
He's never
gonna go for it.

249
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:53,250
Cash upfront.

250
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:57,053
I'm free after 10:00.

251
00:12:59,857 --> 00:13:02,292
<i>ray's voice:
lenore again.</i>

252
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,662
<i>tanya should have
never sent me there.</i>

253
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:10,100
- what are we doing here?
- a friend of mine owns it.

254
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:12,202
- a friend of yours owns it?
- that's right.

255
00:13:12,236 --> 00:13:14,704
I left my wallet in the car,

256
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:17,440
So don't get
any bright ideas.

257
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:22,412
I already got a suit.

258
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:24,981
Yeah, that's
a crap suit, ray.

259
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:26,616
Try this on.

260
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:29,886
- what, here?
- yeah.

261
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:33,256
Go ahead. it's not like
i haven't seen you in
the buff before.

262
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:41,998
So how's it going
with tanya?

263
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:44,134
It's going all right.

264
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:46,269
She's funny, that one.

265
00:13:46,304 --> 00:13:48,338
She means well.

266
00:13:48,372 --> 00:13:50,640
What do you mean?

267
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:52,242
I don't know.
just funny.

268
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,014
How much do you think
these shoes are worth?

269
00:13:58,082 --> 00:13:59,850
I don't know.

270
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:02,752
$79.99.
how about these?

271
00:14:02,787 --> 00:14:04,588
No idea.

272
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:06,323
$1,250.

273
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:08,325
Whew.
come on.

274
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:11,194
Do you know why?
branding.

275
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,597
These shoes are
christian louboutin.

276
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:15,799
These shoes are shit.

277
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,201
Women buy the louboutin because
they're buying quality.

278
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:21,104
But more importantly
they're buying what
the louboutin represent--

279
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:22,973
The best.

280
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:25,041
Sound to me like
you're getting a bad deal.

281
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,643
They don't care.

282
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:29,279
<i>that's the crucial thing
you need to remember.</i>

283
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:31,214
Paying more
doesn't bother them.

284
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:33,016
It gives them
peace of mind.

285
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,518
If they wear
something of value,

286
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:36,820
That means that they
in turn have value.

287
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:39,456
You shouldn't be lowering
your price in this economy,

288
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,124
You should be raising it.

289
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:45,862
This is something that tanya
will never understand.

290
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:50,300
That's hot.

291
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:05,081
No no no, keep the suit.

292
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:09,686
All right.

293
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,755
Hold on.

294
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:14,524
It's time to diversify.

295
00:15:17,995 --> 00:15:21,565
Listen, not all women can
come from just dick alone.

296
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,533
I haven't heard
any complaints.

297
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:25,535
That you know of.

298
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:29,206
It's gonna cost you extra.

299
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,408
( groans )

300
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:38,248
Jesus.

301
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:46,089
( laughs )
oh my god.

302
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,131
You know, some guys
have a problem with it,

303
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,534
But not me.
i just...

304
00:15:57,568 --> 00:16:01,104
You know,
have to like the lady.

305
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:02,873
Like the lady?

306
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:04,875
What are you,
a bible salesman?

307
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:12,582
You don't need
to like the lady.

308
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,951
You just need to...

309
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:18,555
Like the cash.

310
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:22,359
One of the many
words of wisdom

311
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:24,861
Ñ
that will fall from my mouth
if you play on my team.

312
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:30,066
- comfy?
- yeah.

313
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,309
Oh, that's good, ray.

314
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:41,611
Oh, that's--

315
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:43,513
That's actually quite--

316
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:45,949
( moans )

317
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:49,553
Oh god.
oh goodness.

318
00:16:49,587 --> 00:16:51,054
That's really good.

319
00:16:51,088 --> 00:16:53,390
Ray, you really need
to come play on my team.

320
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:56,726
We should team up.
listen, tanya, she doesn't
know anyone.

321
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:58,161
She has no access
to wealth.

322
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:00,497
She can't get you
what you need.

323
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:02,499
Tanya's my friend.

324
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,568
She's also my partner.

325
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:07,637
Am i paying
to argue with you?

326
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:10,774
Oh god!

327
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:12,642
Oh my god.

328
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:14,344
You're playing
in the minors, ray.

329
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:17,714
You are a major league guy
playing on a minor league team.

330
00:17:17,748 --> 00:17:19,115
( moans )

331
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,984
A major league guy playing

332
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:24,054
For a minor league team.

333
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:26,189
( moaning loudly )

334
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:33,163
( toilet flushes )

335
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:35,398
( sighs )
okay.

336
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:36,933
( screams )

337
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,668
You talking
shit about me?

338
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:41,037
No, patty.
absolutely not.

339
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:43,306
This is my workplace.

340
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:46,109
You're telling people
i do coke and heroin?

341
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:49,012
- i never said
a word about heroin.
- listen up!

342
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:51,581
Just because you
talked me into paying
for sex with some guy

343
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:55,352
With a big dick
does not give you
the right to talk about it.

344
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:58,922
Don't you ever talk
about me or to me again

345
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:01,057
Or i will kick
your ass sideways.

346
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:02,225
- do you understand?
- yes.

347
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,262
- you understand?
- yes, uh-huh.

348
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:15,972
( whispering )
tty paid for sex?

349
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:21,711
Linda.

350
00:18:32,623 --> 00:18:35,458
- you never called me.
- excuse me?

351
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:39,162
From the nail salon.
i offended you with
my potty mouth.

352
00:18:39,163 --> 00:18:40,630
Oh, hi.

353
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,566
- lenore.
- right.

354
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,801
Oh, don't, no.
no no, don't buy that.

355
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:46,837
That's just a chloe
knock-off from last season.

356
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:49,239
There's a way cuter chemise
over in the armani section.

357
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:50,674
Come on, i'll show you.

358
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:52,909
Oh, wait, no.
i just wanted to get
something on sale.

359
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:54,444
- oh,
- yeah.

360
00:18:54,478 --> 00:18:56,980
You know what?
you can paw through
the racks if you want,

361
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:58,515
But i'm gonna tell
you a little secret.

362
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:00,116
I can get you
the same exact discount

363
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:03,653
On the new
designer collection.
come on.

364
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:05,255
Do you work here
or something?

365
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:07,190
Kind of.
i'm a lifestylist.

366
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:08,959
Lifestylist?

367
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:12,863
Yeah, kind of a combo

368
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,866
Life coach and stylist.

369
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,635
I help people maximize
their personal style.

370
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:20,203
Oh.

371
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:23,840
Through, you know, fashion,
home decorating, fitness.

372
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,376
- what size are you, a two?
- i used to be.

373
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,311
Now i'm a four.
every since the divorce

374
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:30,347
I just haven't found
time to work out.

375
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:32,649
- colonics.
- really?

376
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:34,985
It sucks it right out of you.
the pounds just drop off.

377
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:37,053
- i have a guy.
- really?

378
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:39,489
Okay, try this dress
with this jacket.

379
00:19:39,524 --> 00:19:41,291
No, i really shouldn't.
i did just want to

380
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:43,026
Just pick up
something on sale.

381
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,295
Oh, all right.
i just thought that the cut

382
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:47,731
Would help with
your, um... problem area.

383
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:50,133
You think?

384
00:19:52,537 --> 00:19:54,404
I'm taking a little survey.

385
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:57,240
Can you have an orgasm
from just cock

386
00:19:57,241 --> 00:20:00,510
Or do you need a guy
to go down on you to get off?

387
00:20:00,545 --> 00:20:02,746
I can't answer that.

388
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:05,115
I've asked a bunch
of my clients.

389
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:08,852
Seems like the ratio
is 60-40 tongue to dick.

390
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:11,388
Well?

391
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:16,059
Tongue helps.

392
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:18,895
( both laugh )

393
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:21,264
That looks amazing.

394
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:24,434
Tanya:
and then the happiness
consultant meets you

395
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:26,870
At a destination
of your choice

396
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:29,105
For a night
of erotic adventure.

397
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,474
Sounds good.

398
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:36,780
Uh, now there's the small
matter of payment.

399
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:39,182
Lenore likes for her
clients to pay upfront.

400
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:41,051
Great.

401
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:47,224
Oh, i'm sorry, linda.
we'll need the full amount.

402
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:49,092
Uh...

403
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:51,695
Our service costs $600.

404
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:54,130
I have 50.

405
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:56,633
You said there was
a sliding scale.

406
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,802
Right.
there is.

407
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:00,804
Okay, i get it.

408
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:03,773
We can offer you $100 off

409
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:07,010
And give you our
service for $400.

410
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:10,547
I mean 500.

411
00:21:10,581 --> 00:21:11,848
$100 off 600.

412
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:14,351
Oh.

413
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:16,753
I can pay 50.

414
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:20,657
Linda, i don't understand
what you're saying to me.

415
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:26,663
$400 is my final offer.

416
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,434
50.

417
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:36,006
Linda--
linda, this is insulting.

418
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:40,510
No no no, it really is.

419
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:43,213
No deal.

420
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:54,457
Uh, i'd like
a brioche, please.

421
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:56,660
Sure.

422
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:58,828
- that's terrible.
- ( jessica laughs )

423
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:01,431
- same thing,
different color.
- oh.

424
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:04,034
I'm sorry, jessica.
what the hell?

425
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:06,703
- i look great in that.
- yeah, in 1989 maybe.

426
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:07,838
But no longer, no.

427
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,306
<i>ronnie:
jess, are you home?</i>

428
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,209
Oh, hey, ron.
come upstairs.

429
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:13,977
I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

430
00:22:16,347 --> 00:22:18,515
- hey, baby.
- oh, you're home.

431
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:21,551
Lenore, this is ron.

432
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:23,453
Ron, lenore.

433
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:25,155
Hi.
so nice to meet you.

434
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:27,557
You guys went shopping?

435
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,160
I know.  i was only gonna
pick up one little thing.

436
00:22:30,194 --> 00:22:33,964
But then i met lenore
and she's amazing.

437
00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:37,033
She helped me find
the best stuff.

438
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:39,569
I just help women
be their best selves.

439
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:41,805
And you bought all this?

440
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,373
<i>i know it looks
like a lot,</i>

441
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:46,743
But lenore gets a 15% discount
on every item over 100 bucks.

442
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,580
Um, i...

443
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:54,918
Got this one for you.

444
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:56,086
That's great, jess.

445
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:57,854
What's the return policy
on this stuff?

446
00:22:57,889 --> 00:23:01,191
All sales are final
'cause of the discount.

447
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:04,761
Okay, great.
that-- that-- great.

448
00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:08,398
Nice to meet you, lenore.

449
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:10,033
Ron, are you mad?

450
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:12,602
No.  no, i'm happy
when you're happy, jess.

451
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:22,412
Jessica, stop it.

452
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:25,182
Stop what?

453
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:27,284
Stop handing out
your love

454
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:29,319
Like you're
a 10th grade slut.

455
00:23:29,353 --> 00:23:32,589
<i>stop letting your kids
and your husband</i>

456
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:33,957
Walk all over you.

457
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,859
Repeat after me--

458
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:39,229
I have the power.
say it.

459
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:44,201
Oh...

460
00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:46,069
Say it.

461
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:47,971
I have the power.

462
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:49,239
Say it again.

463
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:50,874
( whispers )
i have the power.

464
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:53,443
- i don't believe you.
- i have the motherfucking
power!

465
00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:02,352
( giggles )

466
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:04,187
50 bucks?
that's insulting.

467
00:24:04,222 --> 00:24:05,555
Why are we even
talking about it?

468
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,557
It's actually not
that insulting, ray.

469
00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:09,392
Patty said you
were like cocaine.

470
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:12,262
She compared you
to crack.

471
00:24:12,296 --> 00:24:13,663
- okay?
- shh!

472
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:15,665
That's the effect
you have on these women.

473
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,001
So just have sex
with linda.

474
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:20,737
Just give her a taste.
give her a little bump.

475
00:24:20,771 --> 00:24:23,073
And then she'll keep
coming back for more.

476
00:24:23,107 --> 00:24:25,976
Lenore says
we should be charging

477
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,612
1500 bucks a pop
for a night with me.

478
00:24:28,646 --> 00:24:31,681
Well, i'd like to see her
try to get 1500 bucks.

479
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:34,317
She says we should
be raising our prices,
not lowering them.

480
00:24:34,352 --> 00:24:37,687
These women, they need
to feel like they're
worth something.

481
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:40,190
Wait, when were you
talking to lenore about
all of this?

482
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:42,025
When we were having sex.

483
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:44,761
Ray, don't talk to lenore.

484
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:47,697
I'm not comfortable
with that.

485
00:24:47,698 --> 00:24:50,300
Who do you want me
to talk to instead?

486
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:51,434
Talk to me.

487
00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:53,603
We are going
to figure this out.

488
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:55,672
- ray.
- i'm late for detention.

489
00:24:55,706 --> 00:24:57,874
