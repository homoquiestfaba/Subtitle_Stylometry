                    Wow, did you
                 teach her that?

874
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:45,090
No, she's just                  
real smart.                     

875
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,025
                  Pretty collar.

876
00:55:47,026 --> 00:55:49,461
Yeah, I know,                   
she had it on when I found her. 

877
00:55:49,462 --> 00:55:50,728
                      Found her?

878
00:55:50,729 --> 00:55:53,865
Yeah, abandoned                 
in the woods.                   

879
00:55:53,866 --> 00:55:56,101
                    Who would   
         do something like that?

880
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,202
Diamond thieves.                

881
00:55:57,203 --> 00:55:58,336
                         Who?   

882
00:55:58,337 --> 00:56:00,271
Diamond thieves.                

883
00:56:00,272 --> 00:56:01,973
It was in the paper             
about these three crooks        

884
00:56:01,974 --> 00:56:03,074
Who stole these diamonds.       

885
00:56:03,075 --> 00:56:05,943
And one was a nun               
who really wasn't a nun.        

886
00:56:05,944 --> 00:56:10,748
She--I mean, he used Diamond    
to smuggle the diamonds         

887
00:56:10,749 --> 00:56:12,450
Out of L.A. To here,            

888
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:14,352
And that's why                  
I helped Diamond get away.      

889
00:56:14,353 --> 00:56:15,953
That's when                     
she became mine.                

890
00:56:15,954 --> 00:56:19,790
        So you mean the diamonds
         on her collar are real?

891
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:24,062
Yes, and they're                
worth like $5 million.          

892
00:56:29,968 --> 00:56:32,870
The police chief                
didn't believe me either.       

893
00:56:32,871 --> 00:56:34,539
          I want to, Owen, but--

894
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,441
        Have you ever thought   
        about being a writer?   

895
00:56:36,442 --> 00:56:38,309
                Because you have
        a wonderful imagination.

896
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:40,545
          Yeah, Owen.           

897
00:56:40,546 --> 00:56:44,682
            Just imagine what   
        I'm gonna do to you now.

898
00:56:44,683 --> 00:56:45,783
