MAN: Turning over.

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,719
585, take one, A camera.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,950
Action!

4
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,149
MOFFAT: This all began on the train to Cardiff, appropriately enough,

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,879
because Mark and I were both working on different episodes of Doctor Who.

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,678
And we'd sit on the train together -

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,512
we always get the train together so we can chat -

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,990
and we talked about our other great obsession, which was Sherlock Holmes.

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,198
The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221 B Baker Street.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,990
We did this little dance, not literally, in the compartment,

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,436
around the fact that our favourite Sherlock Holmes

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,436
is still the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce movies of the '30s and '40s.

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,193
We thought they were actually rather more fun,

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,239
and in certain ways, in certain tonal ways, certain humorous ways,

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,154
truer to the originals than many grander and more important film versions.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,390
And what we kept saying to each other was,

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,233
"Someday, someone is going to think of doing that again.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,073
"Someday, someone is going to do Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,149
"in the modern day."

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,710
And we thought, "And we'll feel so cross, because we should have done it."

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,509
And we had this conversation, I don't know, 20-odd times, probably, over years.

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,239
And then suddenly, it formed very quickly, the idea,

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,632
in a very exciting train journey, and in a very Sherlock Holmes way.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,792
I'm sure we were sitting either side of the compartment, going like that.

25
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,836
It was a proper Sherlock Holmes journey.

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,675
The idea of blowing away the fog from it.

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,550
And I once mentioned it to my wife, Sue, who said, "Well, why don't you do it?"

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,952
And it was a kind of light-bulb moment, if you like.

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,110
"We should just do this present-day."

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,589
And that's when it properly began.

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,399
We actually started focusing on putting it together, as opposed to

32
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,155
bemoaning the fact that someone else was bound to do it first.

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,998
- You read his blog? - Of course I read his blog. We all do.

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,674
You've brought me here to send a text.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,991
(GUNSHOTS)

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,752
It seemed to us - and this is just our point of view -

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,957
that it's become so much about the trappings,

38
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,838
about the hansom cabs, the costume, the fog,

39
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,195
Jack the Ripper will creep in here...

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,829
It's become a sort of strange maelstrom of stuff.

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,674
There's a wealth of Victorian Sherlocks out there and I love them.

42
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,352
There are tons of them.

43
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,352
Why not just try it in the modern day and see how it works?

44
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,159
And I think the clinching moment for both of us,

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,676
and for everyone else we'd spoken to, was when we realised,

46
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,433
if we took the story from the beginning, that the original stories

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,149
began with Dr John Watson being invalided home from Afghanistan,

48
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,755
and we realised, well, of course, that could happen just as easily today.

49
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,796
Watson!

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,871
(EXPLOSIONS)

51
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,717
Watson, in this scenario, it's the same in the book,

52
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,439
he comes back from Kandahar, from war,

53
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,034
but rather like a lot of the clever adaptations,

54
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,918
what's changed about it is obviously it's a modern context,

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,991
so instead of writing a journal, he's keeping a blog...

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,755
MOFFAT: One of the fun things is, as you update it, as you find each equivalent,

57
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,717
you think... I remember Mark thinking,

58
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,030
"He wouldn't write a journal now, he wouldn't write memoirs.

59
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,394
"He'd write a blog."

60
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,233
And suddenly you realise, of course, that tells you what memoirs were.

61
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,756
They were blogs. And he wouldn't have teams of homeless children.

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,719
He'd have homeless people on the streets selling the Big Issue.

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,598
- Spare change, sir? - Don't mind if I do.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,434
MOFFAT: In a way, it allows you to see the original stories

65
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,795
the way the original reader would have read them -

66
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,509
as exciting, cutting-edge, contemporary stories,

67
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,955
as opposed to these relics that they've become.

68
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,874
And it's just endless fun to take the little details

69
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,748
and realise how easily, how neatly they update.

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,912

Who's talking? Why are you crying?

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,829
I'm not. I'm not crying.

I'm...typing. And...

83
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,597
this stupid...bitch is reading it out.

84
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,232
MOFFAT: I suppose one should feel extra pressure

85
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,710
if you're adapting or working on something that you've always loved,

86
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,519
but the truth is, that is so completely blotted out

87
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,751
and obscured by the fact it's, "Ooh, it's our turn. We get to do it now.

88
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,434
"It's me and Mark doing our Sherlock Holmes series."

89
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,592
And we still giggle like schoolgirls that we've got this.

90
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,272
So, yeah, the pressure's there.

91
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,430
The pressure's always there. Who cares about pressure?

92
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,431
It's the fun. It's the absolute joy

93
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,308
that 221 B Baker Street is our address, just for this little while.

94
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,836
And that's too exciting to be worried about the pressure.

95
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,075
GATISS: I think that sometimes, as with James Bond,

96
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,789
there are half a dozen possible Bonds. Sometimes there's just one.

97
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,668
And Benedict just sort of... leapt into our minds.

98
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,677
Benedict was a hugely simple decision for us.

99
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,513
Sue and I were watching Atonement. We saw Benedict Cumberbatch.

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,319
We were thinking, "Oh, he looks like a Sherlock Holmes."

101
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,915
Mark knows Benedict. He instantly thought that was a good idea,

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,878
so we just sent the script to him and he came in and read for us,

103
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,111
and we all thought, "Well, it's just not going to get better than that, is it?

104
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,679
"That's perfect." And we cast him.

105
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,433
He is the only person ever to have been sent that script

106
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,671
for the part of Sherlock Holmes, and the only person to audition for it.

107
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,432
So it was as simple as that.

108
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,910
There's a huge honour to be asked to play that in the first place,

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,433
but you have to be careful.

110
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,637
Your vanity can trick you into taking the wrong job sometimes.

111
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,314
So you always read the script. That's the main thing you go to.

112
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,913
And they're just...sublime.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,719
It's a murder. All of them.

114
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,997
I don't know how, I don't know how, but they're not suicides - they're killings.

115
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,958
Serial killings. We've got a serial killer.

116
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,669
Oh, I love those. Something to look forward to.

117
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,389
It's a wonderful combination of playing a hero

118
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,439
who is...a faulted human being.

119
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,159
There's an awful lot of him that is...

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,115
...dangerous and perverse and interesting

121
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,350
and great stuff to get your teeth into as an actor,

122
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,718
and at the same time, he is a Class A hero, you know?

123
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,473
Sorry, Mrs Hanson, I'll skip the tea. Off out.

124
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,232
Both of you?

125
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,595
Possible suicides, four of them.

126
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,911
There's no point sitting at home when there's finally something fun going on!

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,195
Look at you, all happy. It's not decent.

128
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,273
Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs Hudson, is on.

129
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,955
Casting John Watson was a much longer process

130
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,749
because I think once you've got one side of the partnership,

131
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,432
you've got to find the fit.

132
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,071
The clincher with Martin was, the chemistry was instant.

133
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,439
Martin's presence in the room changed the way Benedict played the part.

134
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,956
It was again a very, very easy decision. You saw them standing together

135
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,032
and said, "Oh, well, that's a television series, right there."

136
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,599
What's this about, the case?

137
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,352
- Her case. - Her case?

138
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,032
Suitcase, yes, obviously.

139
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,839
The murderer took her suitcase. First big mistake.

140
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,798
OK. He took her case. So?

141
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,872
It's no use. There's no other way. I'll have to risk it.

142
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,030
There's a phone number on my desk. I want you to send a text.

143
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,873
I suppose, with John and Sherlock,

144
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,032
chemistry either happens or not

145
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,712
and you can't really manufacture it

146
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,155
and you can't really do anything but hope it's going to happen.

147
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,310
You're a doctor.

148
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,391
In fact, you're an army doctor.

149
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,710
Yes.

150
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,233
Any good?

151
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,276
Very good.

152
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,035
Seen a lot of injuries, then? Violent deaths?

153
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,031
Hmm, yes.

154
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,633
Bit of trouble, too, I bet?

155
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,233
Of course. Yes.

156
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,993
Enough for a lifetime. Far too much.

157
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,718
Want to see some more?

158
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,995
Oh, God, yes.

159
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,117
And I'd liked Benedict from a distance.

160
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,316
I'd liked his work for a long time.

161
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,868
And I was looking forward to working with him.

162
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,430
But then there's no guarantee you'll work well together,

163
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,909
and thank God we have, really, you know.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,833
Because, yeah, we're two quite different people with...

165
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,798
I guess we're quite different actors. I think we want to

166
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,237
arrive at the same place, which is hopefully not too showy,

167
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,472
not too, er...hammy.

168
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,350
I think there was a friendship instantly between Martin and Benedict.

169
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,398
They're not at all like the parts they play, at all, really.

170
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,835
But the relationship between them

171
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,798
really informs the much pricklier on-screen relationship. Because obviously,

172
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,874
Sherlock's a quite cruel man at times and John's quite a put-upon man at times.

173
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,474
And you won't buy that, you won't enjoy that

174
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,994
unless you absolutely feel in every scene, in every heartbeat,

175
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,355
that there is that proper underlying warmth,

176
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,671
that real, proper, solid friendship.

177
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,833
And that friendship has actually happened between Benedict and Martin.

178
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,036
And the value of that, you get on screen.

179
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,554
It's such a close relationship, Watson and Holmes,

180
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,155
and I think for all their adversity and the prickliness of Holmes

181
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,958
and how that does often come...

182
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,510
well, sometimes comes to a crisis, at least, with Watson and Holmes,

183
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,352
in order for that to really work on screen

184
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,396
it's got to be with two actors who get on well.

185
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,190
- Sorry, what? - There are lives at stake, Sherlock.

186
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,909
Actual human lives. Just so I know, do you care about that at all?

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,673
- Will caring about them help save them? - No.

188
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,829
Then I'll continue not to make that mistake.

189
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,275
- And you find that easy, do you? - Yes, very.

190
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,509
Is that news to you?

191
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,955
No. No.

192
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,555
I've disappointed you.

193
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,915
Good. That's a good deduction, yeah.

194
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,797
Don't make people into heroes, John.

195
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,110
Heroes don't exist, and if they did, I wouldn't be one of them.

196
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,910
Conan Doyle's genius in creating those characters is the friendship between...

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,833
the unlikely friendship between Holmes and Watson.

198
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,152
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are a fantastic pairing.

199
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,314
They are in many ways... not quite chalk and cheese,

200
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,470
but they complement each other, really.

201
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,437
It's not a thing of difference being a problem,

202
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,839
it's the thing that allies them.

203
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,390
They are the missing half of either party.

204
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,949
- What am I doing here? - Helping me make a point.

205
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,268
I'm supposed to be helping you pay the rent.

206
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,716
- Yeah, well, this is more fun. - Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

207
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,315
Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you'd go deeper.

208
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,837
Unbeknown to them, like any sort of great relationship or any great chemistry,

209
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,195
without knowing it, they realise they've met the right person.

210
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,829
By the end of the first night they've spent together hanging out,

211
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,115
they realise that they're going to be very, very good friends.

212
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,839
Because they're a perfect foil for each other. John is...

213
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,912
In a way, he's like Sherlock's kind of moral compass.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,195
Because Sherlock's mind is so genuinely brilliant,

215
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,032
he doesn't always stop to consider

216
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,955
the whys and wherefores or the rights and wrongs of what is.

217
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,112
And John is kind of like his moral barometer there.

218
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,351
And he's a more decent person in a way than Sherlock, because he's more normal.

219
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,476
Sherlock is genuinely extraordinary.

220
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,077
GATISS: We wanted to fetishise modern London

221
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,358
in the way, I suppose, that period versions fetishise Victorian London.

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,594
Episode 2, which is largely set in the City,

223
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,150
we wanted to capture the look of the Gherkin and all those kind of

224
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,710
big, glass-and-steel cathedrals of finance.

225
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,270
It's part of a vibrancy which is very exciting to see.

226
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,155
Why have we come to London? Well, because Cardiff has incredible...

227
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,268
shootability, a word I've just coined... for all kinds of things.

228
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,194
Particularly the huge theatre spaces, the amazing epic-looking places.

229
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,273
And also some great matches for parts of London.

230
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,715
But obviously, there are certain things,

231
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,634
like the architecture of Baker Street, which you can't really fake.

232
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,033
The whole point is to reinvent Sherlock Holmes as a modern man.

233
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,797
We want his London to be a vibrant and thrilling place.

234
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,077
So we want to have as much of the benefit of these locations as possible.

235
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,037
Action!

236
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,633
Action!

237
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,478
Hello.

238
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,030
- Ah, Mr Holmes. - Sherlock, please.

239
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,157
Well, this is a prime spot. Must be expensive.

240
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,834
Mrs Hudson, the landlady, she's given me a special deal.

241
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,639
Owes me a favour. A few years back

242
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,269
her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out.

243
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,635
Sorry, you stopped her husband being executed?

244
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,473
Oh, no, I ensured it.

245
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,790
MRS HUDSON: Sherlock, hello!

246
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,757
Mrs Hudson, Dr John Watson.

247
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,717
- Hello. Come in. - Hello.

248
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,836
- Thank you. - Shall we?

249
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,799
Cut!

250
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,993
SUE VERTUE: Today we're in the middle of

251
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,232
the City, and this is our Shad Sanderson bank.

252
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,834
Everyone's seen a Sherlock Holmes. I think what's different,

253
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,354
you've never seen Sherlock Holmes in this scenario,

254
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,318
with escalators, with modern technology.

255
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,790
The whole soul of it, I think, is the same,

256
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,997
and true to the original Sherlock Holmes stories,

257
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,878
but it just has this modern twist. And it's...

258
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,829
And taxis and London buses and just this huge expanse.

259
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,516
The more modern things around, the better it sort of works, really, for us.

260
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,159
Action!

261
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,468
HOLMES: Two operatives, based in London.

262
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,516
Both travel to Dalian, where they smuggle those vases.

263
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,194
One of them helps himself to something, a little hairpin.

264
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,838
WATSON: Worth ¡ê9 million.

265
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,558
HOLMES: Eddie Van Coon was the thief.

266
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,551
He stole the treasure when he was in China.

267
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,198
WATSON: How'd you know it was Van Coon, not Lukis?

268
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,349
Even the killer didn't know that.

269
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,715
HOLMES: Because of the soap.

270
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,958
THOMPSON: I think the original script,

271
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,955
there's pages and pages at the beginning where I try to describe this building,

272
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,759
and so it was great for me walking in it this morning

273
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,035
and actually seeing the location they'd picked. I'd not seen it before.

274
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,032
They told me they were coming to Tower 42, but I'd not seen it before,

275
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,510
so when I came in this morning and saw it, and I remembered six months ago

276
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,556
writing this very vivid, visual description

277
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,632
as to what it was going to be like, it was great to finally see it

278
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,870
for real and see what they'd chosen.

279
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,040
Yes, when you said we were going to the bank...

280
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,874
VERTUE: And really, what we're just doing is to give a real sense of London

281
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,873
and size and things, so the last few days we've been here, and we've been...

282
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,313
Trafalgar Square...

283
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,515
WATSON: You need advice?

284
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,353
HOLMES: On painting, yes. I need to talk to an expert.

285
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,954
SUE VERTUE: It's just the scale of London that you get,

286
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,315
from Trafalgar Square and walking up towards the gallery and everything,

287
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,868
that you just can't get anywhere else, really.

288
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,949
Chinatown...

289
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,476
DIRECTOR: OK, just make sure, where B camera's set up,

290
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,314
don't obscure our eyeline to Sarah.

291
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,277
We've been to Hungerford Bridge...

292
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,713
WATSON: Tuesday morning.

293
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,268
All you've got to do is turn up and say the bag was yours.

294
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,271
HOLMES: Forget about your court case.

295
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,155
We've been to Shaftesbury Avenue.

296
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,072
- Ooh, Jesus. - Right.

297
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,628
- Van Coon came here... - Yeah?

298
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,110
...on the day he died, with a package - whatever was hidden inside that suitcase.

299
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,155
Mm-hm.

300
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,629
I pieced together his movements using scraps of information.

301
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,711
- Sherlock... - Credit card bills, receipts.

302
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,279
He came here after he got back from China.

303
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,509
Sherlock...

304
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,239
Somewhere in this street, somewhere near. I don't know where...

305
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,788
Yeah, that shop, over there.

306
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,030
- How do you know? - Lukis's diary. He was here.

307
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,190
He wrote down the address.

308
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,754
We wanted to show London, not just the normal locations,

309
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,479
so there's some big, big locations that they're seeing.

310
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,790
(POP MUSIC PLAYS)

311
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,991
John, I want you to go up onto the railway line

312
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,435
and look for anything that looks like the same colour.

313
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,559
If we're going to decipher this language, we're going to need a lot more evidence.

314
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,394
It's been really interesting for me, seeing the locations.

315
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,040
Some very unusual ones.

316
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,476
I mean, one of the films is particularly about codes and ciphers,

317
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,758
and they're painted in different places, like clues.

318
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,992
Very odd tunnels we went into, right on the South Bank, for example.

319
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,959
You realise you live in London and half the time you don't know it at all.

320
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,838
I was just staggered when I saw these things!

321
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,353
The first thing we made wasn't any of these three movies.

322
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,919
The first thing we made was a pilot.

323
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,790
The name's Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221 B Baker Street.

324
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,995
Afternoon.

325
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,071
This pilot wasn't intended as a pilot.

326
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,314
It was intended to be the first episode of our Sherlock Holmes television series,

327
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,630
but it was 60 minutes long, because that was the plan.

328
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,714
And the BBC liked it so much they said, "Well, we want three 90s now."

329
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,397
But the thing about that is you can't simply bolt on another half-hour.

330
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,392
What we had to do, really, was to sort of make it from scratch.

331
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,678
Coky Giedroyc directed the pilot, and did a fantasticjob of it...

332
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,356
But once you start pulling things apart, you really have to start again,

333
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,479
because every scene is probably somewhere else.

334
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,118
John!

335
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,633
John Watson!

336
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,229
Stamford.

337
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,710
Mike Stamford. We were at Barts together.

338
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,268
Yes. Sorry, yes. Mike, hello.

339
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,510
Yeah, I know. I got fat.

340
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,273
John! John Watson!

341
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,512
Stamford. Mike Stamford. We were at Barts together.

342
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,990
- Yes, sorry. Yes, Mike, hello. - Yeah, I know, I got fat.

343
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,631
One of the advantages of making a pilot is that you can make the series right.

344
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,429
That means you can look at a pilot, and a pilot is changeable.

345
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,159
You can alter it. You can say,

346
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,834
"Let's change that set, let's alter that location."

347
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,310
You can say any of those things. It might seem wasteful. It truly isn't.

348
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,188
It's the biggest saving you can make, is to have, in effect, a test flight.

349
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,077
And see what this show looks like

350
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,118
if it's actually made, as opposed to the theory.

351
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,270
So the shooter's not one of yours, then.

352
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,998
God, no, we didn't have time.

353
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,548
A guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose.

354
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,596
One of them could have been following him.

355
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,716
Whoever it was was gone by the time we got there

356
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,030
and we've got nothing to go on.

357
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,190
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

358
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,637
By the time you've got a different DoP, you've got a different camera -

359
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,995
which is a far superior camera

360
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,278
to the one that we could afford, in fact, on the pilot -

361
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,873
it just won't match.

(PHONE RINGS)

363
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,788
Hello?

364
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,871
How do you make them take the poison?

365
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,757
What?

366
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,035
What did you say?

367
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,680
I said, how do you make them take the poison?

368
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,830
- Oi! Who are you? - Sherlock Holmes.

369
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,918
Do you like drugs, Sherlock Holmes?

370
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,072
- Not in a while. - I ask because you're very resilient.

371
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,754
Most people would have passed out by now.

372
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,516
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.

373
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,950
I didn't order a taxi.

374
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,110
Doesn't mean you don't need one.

375
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,395
You're the cabbie.

376
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,798
The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street.

377
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,076
It was you. Not your passenger.

378
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,152
See, no-one ever thinks about the cabbie.

379
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,196
It's like you're invisible.

380
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,953
Just the back of an 'ead.

381
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,759
Proper advantage for a serial killer.

382
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,197
So even if there are a couple of scenes where we had to say to them,

383
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,193
"You couldn't just do what you did in the pilot, could you?"

384
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,192
Because, you know, a lot of it did work.

385
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,716
But it was just easier to do it, to shoot it all again, really.

386
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,155
You rarely get the chance to have another go.

387
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,232
And there are all kinds of little things

388
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,869
that we've been able to have another look at.

389
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,350
Baker Street itself, the interior of Baker Street.

390
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,077
Well, this could be very nice.

391
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,037
Very nice indeed.

392
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,236
Yes, I think so.

393
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,390
The final sequence in Episode 1

394
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,950
which originally took place in 221 B, now doesn't.

395
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,918
So a lot of the scene is the same but it now takes place somewhere else.

396
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,273
- My flat. - Of course it is, yeah.

397
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,388
Found your keys in yourjacket. I thought, well, why not?

398
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,914
People like to die at home.

399
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,879
Where are we?

400
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,350
You know every street in London. You know exactly where we are.

401
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,000
Roland-Kerr Further Education College.

402
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,399
Why here?

403
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,029
It's open. Cleaners are in.

404
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,712
One thing about being a cabbie,

405
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,394
you always know a nice, quiet spot for a murder.

406
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,755
I'm surprised more of us don't branch out.

407
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,559
The one thing that really, really was significant for us,

408
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,837
a real moment for us, was that the scenes that worked best in that pilot

409
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,435
were where the modern world was really, really apparent,

410
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,988
was really surrounding our characters.

411
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,753
So, ran after a cab.

412
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,479
- I told you that limp was psychosomatic. - I knew it was.

413
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,232
You did get shot, though.

414
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,788
- Oh, yeah. In the shoulder. - Ah.

415
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,553
If you stand Benedict and Martin in the half-light,

416
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,473
against a Victorian wall, you wouldn't know it had been updated.

417
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,791
We have an idea now that you really should know in every shot

418
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,552
that this is a modern-day Sherlock Holmes,

419
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,317
because that's where the show has the most energy and is the most exciting.

420
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,997
221 B Baker Street is a very, very famous address,

421
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,914
so it's quite a thrill when you step onto that set for the first time

422
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,958
and think, "Right, this is his home in the 21 st century."

423
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,676
Well, this could be very nice.

424
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,072
BERYL VERTUE: It was interesting for everybody, doing the interior

425
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,879
of 221 B Baker Street

426
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,873
because, you know, we're not into gas lamps, as I've said to you.

427
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,235
This is contemporary, this is modern-day.

428
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,359
But at the same time, you need for the Sherlock Holmes aficionados

429
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,635
not to just lose it totally.

430
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,919
And also Sherlock, be he in the olden days or contemporary,

431
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,310
he's still that same eccentric character

432
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,595
and he wouldn't live in something

433
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,832
that was, you know, too suburban or too modern.

434
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,319
WATSON: So, this is...

435
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,550
HOLMES: Well, obviously I can straighten things up.

436
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,158
It was really quite a difficult thing to get 221 B exactly right.

437
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,870
Quite often you can go too far down the road of it being too much of a mess,

438
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,236
and you think, "Oh, it's like every single item they've ever owned

439
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,312
"is now stacked for you to see on every surface, that's too much."

440
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,837
It has to be a flat that two young fellas believably would live in.

441
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,512
The moment you bring it up to date,

442
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,309
it sort of becomes half the familiar Baker Street

443
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,119
and half Men Behaving Badly, because that's what it is.

444
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,716
It is these two fellas living in a flat, putting dreadful things in the fridge.

445
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,799
A severed head!

446
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,678
- Just tea for me, thanks. - No, there's a head in the fridge.

447
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,876
- Yes. - A bloody head!

448
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,030
Where else was I supposed to put it? You don't mind, do you?

449
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,468
We really loved the scenes that we filmed in the Baker Street studio.

450
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,755
I love the design of it and I love the cosiness of it.

451
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,118
It looks beautiful and you instantly feel like it's a place with history.

452
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,557
You feel like you're... Because it's been so well done,

453
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,757
it's been so well dressed, so well designed, that it's like you are

454
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,957

GATISS: It's one of those curious things, when you're basing something

456
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,872
on existing stories and a very familiar world to people,

457
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,397
you do have to, sort of, create, as it were, a bible of your version.

458
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,430

459
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,432
which transfixes unopened correspondence.

460
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,956
A curious thing happened on the first day of shooting.

461
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,271
We were dressing various things in

462
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,319
and I spotted this picture just there, where it is now.

463
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,233
And in the original stories,

464
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,351
Dr Watson has an unframed picture of a man called Henry Ward Beecher.

465
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,035
This is not Henry Ward Beecher, but it's a complete coincidence.

466
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,476
The props people had just dressed in an unframed picture.

467
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,758
I said, "Leave that, that's like a little accidental reference."

468
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,637
Um...

469
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,553
And obviously, through there in the kitchen,

470
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,872
which Sherlock has just completely converted into his laboratory,

471
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,839
we've got a lot of microscope equipment and test tubes and stuff like that.

472
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,515
It would be no accident to open the margarine tub

473
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,194
and find a severed finger in there.

474
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:51,037
His experiments kind of creep out into the rest of everybody's life.

475
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,190
And I think it's quite a funny thing,

476
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,513
the idea that they are flatmates and they're supposed to be two units,

477
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,628
but Sherlock's interests and obsessions spread out like a mould through the house.

478
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,952

I think the first thing was just

484
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,276
trying to come up with a central theme and a character for it.

485
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,955
Is there a way of playing this character that, you know,

486
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,158
is relevant to the movie that they've made and the character they're making?

487
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,552
So, it's discussions with Steven and Sue and Mark,

488
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,916
and then both myself and Michael

489
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,912
try to find common ground in terms of

490
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,356
what is going to be the defining sound of this show.

everything is done and everything is absolutely flawless.

You do it at the end. It is very subjective as well, I think,

but it really brings out the drama or the light touch.

507
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,278
unless it's the time when it's really, you know, stressful and tense,

508
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,920
when you really do want to hear that music coming through.

509
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,072
I think there's a lot of that really exciting stuff in this one.

511
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,878
GATISS: You know what you want, I think, and sometimes,

512
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,430
when music really delivers, it's a fantastically satisfying thing.

513
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,557
You feel like, if your emotions are rising at the time,

514
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,596
that the score is taking you along that journey.

515
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,750
Are we doing super-well?

516
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,110
Thank you very much for the accelerated pace, guys.

517
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,795
The nature of the way the music has been written for this show...

518
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,793
We have certain pre-recorded synthetic elements,

519
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,634
but I think, once you put real musicians on something,

520
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,474
it starts to come to life and adds a real personality.

521
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:20,874
So I'm very pro having real people playing music for whatever it is,

522
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,679
whether it's a TV show, animation or a film.

523
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,673
Notes on page are fine, but I think when you get people

524
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,990
actually putting a real performance into something,

525
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,117
it can make so much difference to...the way the music sounds,

526
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,316
but also the way that you perceive the programme.

527
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,518
(TENSE MUSIC)

528
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,352
You hope the music speaks for itself,

529
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,590
you hope that what you have written is clear enough

530
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,276
for them just to play and for it to work. But from time to time, you can, um...

531
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,033
Sometimes we'll just turn the screens around and go,

532
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,634
"Oh, it's this bit! This is what's happening now."

533
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,676
And they go, "Oh, now we get it. Why didn't you say?"

534
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,829
So it's a fabulous living, breathing thing.

00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,711
The exciting thing about Sherlock Holmes

536
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,110
is an awful lot of the way forward is already there in the stories,

537
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,509
because we have really been quite faithful, in a way,

538
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,434
to lots of the ingredients in those stories, but using them in new ways.

539
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,310
What would The Hound Of The Baskervilles be in a modern setting?

540
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,153
What would The Speckled Band be in a modern setting?

541
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,676
Looking at their stories and updating them and thinking,

542
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,557
"What would a haunted house be?"

543
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,393
Haunted houses are a stalwart of Sherlock Holmes,

544
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,439
but what's a modern haunted house? How would that be now?

545
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,115
All those incidents. We've got stuff from the stories that's never been covered.

546
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,395
Watson spends quite a lot of the stories married.

547
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,038
Are we going to do that? We could.

548
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,758
We could marry off John

549
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,592
and have him living somewhere else other than Baker Street.

550
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,910
That's open to us. All those things

551
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,470
are out there for us in the future, and, if you know your Sherlock Holmes,

552
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,155
you'll be sort of thinking, "Oh, how are they going to handle that?"
