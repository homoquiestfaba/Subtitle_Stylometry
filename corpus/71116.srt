1
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,178
<i>And still,</i>
<i>the questions remain.</i>

2
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:53,151
<i>Was it economic, was it social</i>
<i>or was it cultural?</i>

3
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,154
<i>Or was it simply</i>
<i>a matter of human nature?</i>

4
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,986
<i>What was it that made</i>
<i>some people do what they did...</i>

5
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,993
<i>and other people</i>
<i>do nothing at all?</i>

6
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,127
Good job, Mr. Bowden.

7
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,927
It's nice to see a few more
A's this time around...

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,934
including Mr. Bowden's,
of course.

9
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,674
This concludes our week
on the Holocaust.

10
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,781
It you wanna know more, you may
find the Santo Donato library...

11
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,911
to be an excellent resource.

12
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,406
<i>- Guess who likes you.</i>
<i>- Who?</i>

13
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,568
<i>Becky Trask. Are you gonna ask her out?</i>

14
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,603
- You know who I'm talkin' about?
- I know who she is.

15
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,740
- I'll think about it.
- No, don't think.

16
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,012
You just do it, all right?

17
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,817
And can you give me your trig notes
from last year, because Fiscarelii...

18
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,325
- I knew this was leading to something.
- Fiscarelii is kickin' my ass.

19
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,419
- I'll bring them in tomorrow.
- Cool. Ask Becky out.

20
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,488
- I gotta think about it.
- What are you doin' after school?

21
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,500
I'm busy.

22
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,165
All right, I'm coming!

23
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,370
Oh, for God's sake.

24
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,869
Yes?

25
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,012
- What do you want?
- I--

26
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,612
If you're selling something,
I'm not interested.

27
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,852
I have your newspaper.

28
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,061
I'm not...
I'm not selling anything.

29
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,226
Then what do you want?

30
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,770
It you could let me in,
I just wanna talk.

31
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,032
Talk?

32
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:32,475
I don't have anything to say
to you, boy. Good day to you.

33
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:36,914
Bergen-Belson,
January of '43 to June '43.

34
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:41,044
Auschwitz,
June '43 to June '44.

35
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,714
And then you went to Patin.

36
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,257
After that, you disappeared.

37
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,761
But then in 1965,
you were spotted in West Berlin.

38
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,331
Listen, boy.

39
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,799
I don't have time for this game.

40
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,330
- Now leave before I call the police.
- Call them if you want.

41
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,603
I'm sure they'd love to meet you.

42
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,809
Who are you?

43
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,316
My name's Todd Bowden.

44
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,185
I didn't mean to scare you.
I just really wanna talk to you.

45
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,691
It you could let me in
for a minute?

46
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,354
Please, Mr. Dussander?

47
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,030
<i>All of this...</i>

48
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:31,263
because you saw an old man
with a raincoat and an umbrella?

49
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,171
It wasn't that easy. I mean, these
pictures are 40 years old, at least.

50
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,836
But when I held 'em up next to
the ones I took, I knew I was close.

51
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,813
- You took photographs of me?
- Yeah.

52
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,646
But even then,
I couldn't be sure.

53
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:50,052
I needed real proof, so I dusted
your mailbox for fingerprints.

54
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,353
You know, that's a lot
harder than people think.

55
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,089
I had to go back to Toytown
three times to get all the stutf.

56
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,097
Then I waited till
you were at the movies.

57
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,794
You put dust on my mailbox
for fingerprints?

58
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,803
You took photographs of me?
What else did you do?

59
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,100
I already had a copy
of your fingerprints.

60
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,405
They're on your want sheet
from the Israeli government.

61
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,468
It's all on database
at U.C. Irvine.

62
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,708
Are you okay?

63
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,455
Would you care
for a drink, boy?

64
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,821
- How about milk?
- Milk.

65
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,998
You told your parents
about all this then?

66
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,007
You think I'm crazy?

67
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,477
It takes eight good matches
for a print to get accepted in court.

68
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,105
They're called compares.

69
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:54,380
One or two is not so hard to find, but
eight good ones, that's really tough.

70
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,014
It all sounds
very exciting, boy...

71
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,719
but I'm afraid all your work
has been for nothing.

72
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,523
I found 14 compares.

73
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,430
Boy, what you have done...

74
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,964
I have to explain this to you because,
clearly, you don't understand.

75
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,068
What you have done
is a violation.

76
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,079
Like those experiments
with the decompression chamber.

77
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,605
- Now, that's a violation.
- To hell with this and to hell with you.

78
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,618
I'm calling the police.

79
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,417
Your father will beat your behind when
he picks you up from the police station.

80
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,947
- My parents don't believe in violence.
- They should start. I'm calling.

81
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,238
My name is Denker.

82
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,378
Arthur Denker.

83
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,481
I'm an American.

84
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,182
I became a citizen in 1955.

85
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,859
I vote.

86
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:15,828
You've no right to come here
and say these lies about me.

87
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,806
I have your fingerprints.

88
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,436
I have your photographs.

89
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,138
One way or another,
I'll get them to the right people.

90
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,283
This is unforgivable.

91
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,793
What do you want?
Tell me.

92
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,730
- I wanna hear about it.
- Hear about what?

93
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,238
The stories.

94
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,739
Everything.

95
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,537
What "everything"?

96
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,240
Everything they're afraid
to show us in school.

97
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,482
You were there.

98
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,019
You did those things.

99
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:11,386
No one can tell it
better than you can.

100
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,391
That's all I want.

101
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,757
Then I'll leave you alone.

102
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,228
And just so you know...

103
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,193
everything I have on you...

104
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,536
the compares, the want sheet,
all the photographs...

105
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,802
are all in a very safe place.

106
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:34,209
It anything happens to me,
someone will find it. Believe me.

107
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,782
Tell me, boy...

108
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,343
why should I consider
any of this?

109
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,413
Because you hung up
the phone, that's why.

110
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,610
Judging by the results
of your first exam...

111
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:17,054
I think that for most of you, we moved
a little too tast through chapter one.

112
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,521
By a show of hands...

113
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:24,427
how many of you think you know
what sociology is?

114
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,657
That's what I thought.

115
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,670
All right, class.
Let's turn to chapter two.

116
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,676
<i>Once they were in the chamber,</i>
<i>how long did it take?</i>

117
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,273
<i>Five minutes?</i>

118
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,914
<i>Gott, no.</i>
<i>The prussic acid...</i>

119
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,115
took about l5 minutes.

120
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,351
But the monoxide...

121
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,986
could take an hour,
sometimes more.

122
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,697
What happened to them?
I mean, exactly.

123
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,131
It was a mess.

124
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,607
They would lose control
of their bodies.

125
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:16,046
They vomited, urinated
and defecated themselves.

126
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:20,711
Even though the gas came in
from the vents in the ceiling...

127
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,277
they would climb
on top of each other...

128
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:27,724
desperately reaching for
fresh air that wasn't there.

129
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,996
They died in a mountain
of themselves.

130
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,792
What about the children?

131
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,862
On the bottom.

132
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,141
Did anyone ever survive it?

133
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,550
One time...

134
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:57,844
the gas didn't work.

135
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,016
There was a leak in the pipes...

136
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:03,858
so oxygen mixed with the monoxide.

137
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,390
It was horrible.

138
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,232
But after an hour
they were still moving...

139
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,602
stumbling around the room
like drunks...

140
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,607
their eyes glassy.

141
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,906
What did you do?

142
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,578
I ordered more gas,
but we didn't know about the leak.

143
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,485
Soon they began
to twitch all over...

144
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,489
like they were dancing.

145
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,923
Some even tell
to their knees...

146
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,589
laughing this terrible
high-pitched squeal.

147
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,591
Even the guards were frightened.

148
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,939
It didn't kill them.

149
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,100
After two hours...

150
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,201
I sent tive men in with ritles.

151
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,015
It's getting dark.
Your mother will be worried.

152
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,488
Oh, shit! I gotta go.

153
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,753
I can be here tomorrow by 3:15.
I want to hear the end of this.

154
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,760
The end?

155
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,900
The end.

156
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,416
Todd?

157
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,960
Are you up?

158
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,496
Honey, let's go.
Joey's outside.

159
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,032
Tell him I'm comin',
will you?

160
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,034
You said you were up
halt an hour ago.

161
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,666
Yeah, I must have
tallen back asleep.

162
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,710
Listen, honey, I'm gonna
see a client tonight at 7:00.

163
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,303
But I've got some cold chicken
in the tridge and plenty of...

164
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,577
It's okay. I'm gonna eat
over at Mr. Denker's house.

165
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,579
What are you gonna do
all night? Watch TV?

166
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,885
Mom, I told you. He doesn't watch TV.
I read books to him.

167
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,789
Will you not worry about it?

168
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,351
Listen to me. I want you
to invite him over here...

169
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,523
because Daddy and I
still want to meet him.

170
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,760
Okay?

171
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,768
<i>So the policeman said to me...</i>

172
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:02,671
"Mr. Denker, if you can't see the road,
you shouldn't be driving.

173
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,006
Now, how many tingers
am I holding up?"

174
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,171
And I said,
"Well now, officer.

175
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,613
Let me guess.

176
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,115
One?"

177
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,022
That was the end of
my driving in America.

178
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,552
I've taken the bus ever since.

179
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:26,030
Well, of course, I'm not drivin'
much either with this wheelchair...

180
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,067
but my eyesight is not
what it used to be.

181
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,100
That's a whitetail buck.

182
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,742
That's a remnant
trom our life in Carolina.

183
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,209
Dick brought that down
in the Yadkin River...

184
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,509
- seven or eight years ago.
- Seven.

185
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:46,540
You know, your grandson never told me
that he came trom a family of hunters.

186
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,610
Oh, Todd never took
a shine to guns.

187
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,556
- He's good at other things.
- Baseball is Todd's game.

188
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,617
- Arthur, sure you don't want a cigar?
- No, thank you.

189
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,654
It you don't mind, I'll have one
of my cigarettes. Where are they?

190
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,667
Ah! Let me help you
with that, Arthur.

191
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,635
My dear...

192
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,333
your generosity humbles me.

193
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:13,003
I thank you for
a most enchanting evening.

194
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,612
Well.

195
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,010
I wonder it you'd mind
it I asked you a personal question?

196
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,917
Not at all.

197
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,650
What'd you do during the war?

198
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:35,424
I was in the reserves,
as were most young men, Victor.

199
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,664
But then, my poor eyesight
kept me out of combat, I thank God.

200
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,572
No, I spent most of the war
in the military hospital...

201
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,100
washing bed linens
and nurses' unitorms.

202
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,147
You've been
pretty quiet tonight.

203
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,485
I'm sorry. It's just that I've heard
all of these stories before.

204
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,254
That's all right, my dear.
The boy's just being honest.

205
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,158
It's a privilege of boys.

206
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:10,531
A privilege that men
must sometimes give up.

207
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:16,665
You know, that reminds me. I...

208
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,473
It must have been my tirst year
at the university.

209
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:24,447
There was a group of about three
or tour of us, and we dropped in and...

210
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:29,419
<i>At first my men took turns shooting them</i>
<i>in the head, but there were so many.</i>

211
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,083
<i>Two or three bodies could</i>
<i>be packed into each oven.</i>

212
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,650
<i>They were ground into fine ash.</i>

213
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:40,858
<i>A whole town was wiped off</i>
<i>the face of the earth.</i>

214
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,915
<i>And still,</i>
<i>it wasn't enough for Himmler.</i>

215
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,712
<i>That was a dark year.</i>

216
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:04,813
<i>We ordered every Jew in Kiev</i>
<i>to come to the Babi Yar Ravine.</i>

217
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,884
<i>You must remember, boy, the '20s</i>
<i>were a desperate time in Germany.</i>

218
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,623
<i>The Treaty of Versailles</i>
<i>had left us crippled.</i>

219
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,258
<i>God, we must have</i>...
<i>They would hide</i>...

220
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,862
<i>The shooting-- The walls-- The sewers--</i>
<i>But we always found them.</i>

221
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,874
<i>If the dogs didn't,</i>
<i>the smoke and fire would.</i>

222
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:28,345
<i>We would round them up</i>
<i>and march them out to a large pit.</i>

223
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,041
<i>At the time, the shooting</i>
<i>was no longer killing.</i>

224
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:35,985
<i>Nothing could stop the killing.</i>
<i>It was no longer death.</i>

225
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:40,548
<i>I will never forget</i>
<i>the sound that night.</i>

226
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:44,686
So many of them on top
of each other like that.

227
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:48,290
After a few hours,
they began to settle.

228
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,072
A head would fall.

229
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:59,599
Yeah, an arm would drop.

230
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:07,751
It was a bit like
the sound of blowing leaves.

231
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,190
What did it teel like?

232
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,640
It was something
that had to be done.

233
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:33,439
A door had been opened
and couldn't be shut.

234
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,446
It was the end...

235
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,041
You don't understand.

236
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,547
<i>You've done it a million times!</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

237
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,442
That's it!
Hit the showers!

238
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,874
- So, where you been?
- What do you mean?

239
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,976
Well, it you'd return
your phone calls...

240
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:18,784
you'd know that Damon's
havin' a party on Saturday night.

241
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:23,521
- I've been busy.
- Too busy for your best triend?

242
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,325
I've been studying a lot, okay?
I'm sorry.

243
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,529
You gonna go?

244
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,036
I don't even know
it I can get the car or not.

245
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:36,562
- I know someone who'll give you a ride.
- Who?

246
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,381
<i>I've been accepted!</i>

247
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:35,319
<i>The Ritzy Vista Country Club.</i>
<i>Hee-hee-hee, my life's ambition.</i>

248
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,453
O<i>fficer, can you tell me</i>
<i>where to catch the bus...</i>

249
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,464
<i>to the Ritzy Vista Country Club?</i>

250
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,228
<i>Ritzy Vista Country0 Club.</i>
<i>Here it is.</i>

251
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,235
<i>Where you goin', pop?</i>

252
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:48,136
<i>Why, this is the bus</i>
<i>to the country club, isn't it?</i>

253
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,140
<i>Very humorous.</i>

254
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,200
<i>- What do you want?</i>
<i>- The name is Magoo.</i>

255
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,246
<i>I have my papers.</i>

256
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,747
- Hello?
- <i>Judge Stevens put me in.</i>

257
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,410
<i>- Okay, sit down.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

258
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,992
- <i>This way, buddy.</i>
- <i>My, what an impressive entrance.</i>

259
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,156
<i>Just look at those</i>
<i>big iron gates.</i>

260
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,325
- Wake up.
- I'll kill you!

261
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,940
I thought you were dead.

262
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:28,139
- You look terrible.
- Today is, uh, Saturday.

263
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:31,979
Since when do you
come here on Saturdays?

264
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,143
I brought you something.

265
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,053
Aren't you gonna open it?
Wait, wait.

266
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,615
Let's put the shades down.

267
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,694
What for?

268
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,697
To be safe.

269
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,928
To hell with this.
You open it.

270
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,367
Relax. Open it.

271
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,509
You wrapped it yourselt, I see.

272
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,735
Merry Christmas.

273
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,930
Mary, Mother of God.

274
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,906
- Where did you get this?
- It looks pretty real, huh?

275
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,016
"E.F. Montgomery...

276
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,178
Costume Clothiers...

277
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:45,222
Topenstein, New Jersey."

278
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,651
Well, try it on.

279
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,356
Have you completely
lost your mind?

280
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,593
What on earth makes you think
I'd put something like that on?

281
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,100
I thought you would like it.

282
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,594
Like it?

283
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,265
You are a bigger tool
than I thought.

284
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,173
Maybe I'll put it on
and do a little shopping.

285
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,939
Is that what you thought?

286
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:10,606
The indignities I've suttered with you.
I should smash you.

287
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,150
What you've suftered with me
is nothing compared...

288
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,051
to what the Israelis
would do to you.

289
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,113
You forget that,
and I'll admit that's my fault.

290
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,385
But don't ever forget
the file I have on you.

291
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,326
I tried to do things the nice way,
but you don't want it.

292
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:25,987
So we're gonna do it
the hard way.

293
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,999
You'll put this on
because I wanna see you in it.

294
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,500
Now, move!

295
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,913
I see I've been promoted.

296
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,575
Yeah, I know.
It's all they had.

297
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,552
But that's a perfect fit.
I checked in one of your suit coats.

298
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,748
- It itches like hell.
- Quiet.

299
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,560
Put the hat on.

300
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,754
Please.

301
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,526
- Please, put the hat on.
- Good <i>Gott.</i>

302
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,593
Attention.

303
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,074
What's so tunny?

304
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,510
March.

305
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,078
Do it.

306
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,984
I'm serious.

307
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:39,252
Stop fucking around! March!

308
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,131
That's it.

309
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:51,600
Face right!

310
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,352
Okay, that's enough.

311
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,853
Stop.

312
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,387
Stop it!

313
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:14,355
Boy, be careful.
You play with fire.

314
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,330
Okay, I can tell
you're not into this.

315
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,533
No, I am, really.
It just takes me a while.

316
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,044
Right.

317
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,547
You know why I like you, Todd?

318
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:41,711
Because you're the only guy
that never tried to impress me.

319
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,890
Can I ask you something?

320
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,283
Sure.

321
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:55,756
Do you ever wonder
why people do the things they do?

322
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,302
You think about it.

323
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,032
- Okay.
- Seriously.

324
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,578
It's better not to think.

325
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,846
It's better to just do it.

326
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,434
Who are you, kitty, kitty?

327
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,813
It's getting cold out here...

328
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,120
kitty, hmm?

329
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,506
Kitty.

330
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,805
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

331
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,506
Maybe you'll be more
in the mood later.

332
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,414
I don't know. That's never
really happened to me before.

333
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,984
It's all right.

334
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,523
Could you blow that
the other way, please?

335
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,531
Maybe you just don't like me.

336
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,991
No, it's not that at all.

337
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,038
- I really do.
- Maybe you just don't like girls.

338
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,367
Kitty, kitty.

339
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,403
Good-bye.

340
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,649
You motherfucker!

341
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,047
Class, you have
tive more minutes.

342
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,786
<i>"Dear Mr. & Mrs. Bowden:</i>

343
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,383
This note is to suggest
that we have a group conterence...

344
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,656
concerning Todd's
first semester grades.

345
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,359
In light of his previous excellent work,
the sudden decline in his grades...

346
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,901
suggests a specific problem
which should be addressed...

347
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,403
before his academic advancement
is jeopardized permanently.

348
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,633
I'm ready to work out
a time for us to meet.

349
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,470
In a case such as this,
earlier is usually better.

350
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,407
Sincerely yours,
Edward French."

351
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,881
- Jesus, man. What are you gonna do?
- Fuck it I know.

352
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,578
- What?
- I said, "Fuck it I know."

353
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,790
You're throwin' it up hard.
Let it roll of your fingers more.

354
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,316
- I don't need a lesson, okay?
- All right.

355
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,954
Man, with your dad too.

356
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:24,195
I'm a fuck-up.
My dad expects this trom me. But you?

357
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,765
You're talkin' to yourselt.>
What's goin' on with you?

358
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:35,107
Nothing. I fucked up.
I'll tix it.

359
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,170
Whatever you say, man.

360
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,085
- What's happening between you and Becky?
- Who?

361
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,614
Becky Trask, idiot.

362
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,714
What did you call me?

363
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:53,119
You're bein' a real dick, man.

364
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,131
I gotta get to practice.

365
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:05,274
"You're talkin' to yourselt, man.
You're bein' a dick."

366
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,287
"<i>...a time for us to meet.</i>

367
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:38,267
In such a case as this,
earlier is usually better.

368
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:41,827
Sincerely yours,
Edward French."

369
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:45,899
Who's this Edward French?
Headmaster?

370
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,871
No, he's a guidance counselor.

371
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,881
- Well, what is that?
- He guides and he counsels.

372
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,816
You read the letter.

373
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,187
What stinks in here?

374
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,384
Oh, I bet it's
my TV dinner, I'm afraid.

375
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,525
- We've got a problem here, you know?
- We?

376
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,092
- I'm not the one in trouble.
- We'll see about that.

377
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,695
You don't turn this
around on me, boy.

378
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,674
It's not my tault
your grades have fallen.

379
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:22,576
That's where you're wrong. The shit
you tell me keeps me up half the night.

380
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,080
I tall asleep during class.

381
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,577
I need a fucking pencil.
Do you have one?

382
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,557
What will your parents do
about this letter?

383
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:39,323
They're never gonna see it.
That's the whole point of this.

384
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:43,628
This isn't just a little slipup here.
My parents will treak.

385
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:49,102
They're gonna wanna know exactly
what happened, and what happened is you.

386
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,573
You get what I'm telling you?

387
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,477
I think so.

388
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,480
You better be sure...

389
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,608
'cause it's your sorry ass
that winds up in jail, not mine.

390
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,151
Goddamn it!
I need a pencil.

391
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,551
A sharp one, please.

392
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,112
Thank you.

393
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,987
Does this Edward French...

394
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:11,459
know your parents
in a social way?

395
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,259
No. My parents wouldn't mix
with a geek like him.

396
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:19,064
How about professionally?
Has he ever spoken to them?

397
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,570
No. I've never
needed it until now.

398
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,036
You're messing things up
with that carbon paper.

399
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:32,514
- What do you know about it?
- Here. Out of the way.

400
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:37,247
I was forging documents
before your parents were born.

401
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,365
Todd, Mr. French
will see you now.

402
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:01,036
- Do you know what this is about?
- I'm sorry, I don't.

403
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,173
See ya.

404
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:16,155
He means the world to me.

405
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,254
Hey, Todd.
Have a seat.

406
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,031
Hello there.

407
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,401
It's okay. Sit down.

408
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,468
We were just talking about
what's been going on.

409
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,845
Do you wanna talk about it?

410
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,346
Not really.

411
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,147
You know, this is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

412
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,848
It's not your fault,
and both of us...

413
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,686
wanna help you
get back on track.

414
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,851
Both of you?

415
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,088
I must admit that...

416
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:57,793
the situation in Richard's home
is appalling.

417
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:01,031
I was raised to believe that
a man should take responsibility...

418
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,766
for his family.

419
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,071
But when you
came to me in tears...

420
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,771
and asked me to intervene...

421
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:13,749
well then, I realized that this
was not a matter to be trifled with.

422
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,182
That's why...

423
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,221
I arranged this meeting.

424
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,722
We all appreciate
your concern, Victor.

425
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,282
I've been looking
at your record...

426
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,022
and according to your
progress report this quarter...

427
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:30,362
every grade is way down,
even your strongest subjects.

428
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:31,423
History:

429
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,232
You went from a solid "A"
to a "C" minus.

430
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,236
Trigonometry:

431
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,136
Down to a "D"?

432
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:42,578
Todd, did you know you were on your way
to tinishing tirst in your class?

433
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,606
Yes.

434
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,586
Your grandfather and I have been talking
and we both agree...

435
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:52,816
that with what's been going on,
what with your tather's work problems...

436
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,654
and your mom with the drinking...

437
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:59,820
that maybe home isn't
the best place to be studying.

438
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:03,060
So he's offered to let you
study over at his place...

439
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,294
every day after school.

440
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,462
Todd, I think it's a good idea.

441
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,665
- You do?
- Yeah.

442
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,300
In tact, I offered
to go a step further.

443
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,470
But it means you and I
gotta make a deal.

444
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,505
What kind of deal?

445
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:22,416
Well, tinals for this quarter
are in 31/2 weeks. Right?

446
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:26,149
Now, if you can
give me all A's...

447
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,214
then I'll talk
to your teachers...

448
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:31,056
and see if we can't
discount your midterms...

449
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:34,120
and let this quarter's grades
rest with your tinal exams.

450
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:38,134
But it you come back with
B's or C's, I can't help you.

451
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,829
But all A's...

452
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,770
that shows everybody
that you're serious.

453
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,105
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

454
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,508
But first you gotta start
being honest with me.

455
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,385
No more forging
your father's signature.

456
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:59,718
No more hiding my letters.

457
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,883
For now we can deal
with just the three of us...

458
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,325
it it makes things
easier at home.

459
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:08,296
But you try and pull one over on me,
next time I show up on your doorstep.

460
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,026
Is that clear?

461
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:15,699
- He's oftering to help...
- I know!

462
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,401
But that's a whole lot to do
in three weeks.

463
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,568
What if I can't do it?

464
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:24,375
Mr. Bowden, I can't thank you enough
for coming down here today...

465
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,849
but it it's all right with you
I'd like to talk to Todd alone...

466
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,749
for a few minutes.

467
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,081
Yes, it's quite all right.

468
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,093
If you didn't excuse me...

469
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,426
I'm afraid that my desire
for a cigarette would.

470
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,430
You can take my word,
when the time is right...

471
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:50,701
I'll tell Richard
about all this, you know.

472
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:54,403
He and Monica need to know
what's happening to their son.

473
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:03,215
I'll expect you after school.

474
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:21,235
- He's a very persuasive man.
- Tell me about it.

475
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,805
Listen, Todd. I understand
what you're going through.

476
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:28,902
I really do.

477
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:32,642
My wite and I, we just went through
the nastiest divorce since Henry Vlll's.

478
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:37,085
And I know it's not easy
being a senior and only 16.

479
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:40,749
And now we're asking
a lot of you.

480
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,883
But your grandtather
thinks you can do this.

481
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,622
Todd, I know you can.

482
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,290
So from now on...

483
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:52,165
I don't want you to feel like
you have no one you can talk to, okay?

484
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:55,569
Your parents,
or girl problems...

485
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:58,301
Anything at all.
Here's my home phone.

486
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,840
Anything at all. Anything.

487
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:05,905
You call me, Todd.
Call me.

488
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,018
Deal?

489
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:12,351
I'm telling you, buddy,
you get past this little hurdle...

490
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:16,586
I promise you the world's gonna
open up for you like you won't believe.

491
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,170
Bye.

492
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,126
Have you lost your mind?

493
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,628
What the hell
were you thinking, "Grandpa"?

494
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:57,155
- What are you so excited about?
- Oh, you've got some fucking balls!

495
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,259
I could've screwed you up.
Anything could've happened.

496
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,668
You played it beautifully, boy.
I knew you would.

497
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,866
Are you fucking drunk?
I could've busted you right there.

498
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:09,174
Yes, you could have, but you did not.
Now why was that?

499
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:17,447
Your Edward French is not going
to give you any more trouble.

500
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:22,549
Now you are upset because the only way
you can make things right is to work.

501
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,652
I'm upset because you had that asshole
thinking I can do something...

502
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,994
- that can't be done.
- Oh, but it can, and it will.

503
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:32,832
You will simply have to work.
No more stories.

504
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,701
- No more screwing around.
- I don't take orders from you.

505
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:39,105
- You do now.
- Oh, you think so?

506
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:41,736
Don't forget, I can walk in there
and pick up that phone.

507
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,279
And do what?

508
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,512
Do you really think that
I would stand aside...

509
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,987
and let you turn me in
without dragging you with me?

510
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,614
Do you?

511
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:57,023
Your American self-confidence
is so bloated...

512
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,562
you've forgotten
the reality of the situation.

513
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:02,154
90,000 died in Patin.

514
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:05,690
To the whole world,
I am a monster.

515
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:10,536
And you have known about me
all this time.

516
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:14,236
It I'm caught, when those reporters
stick their microphones in my tace...

517
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:18,145
it will be your name that
I will repeat over and over again.

518
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,705
Todd Bowden.

519
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,512
Yes, that was his name.

520
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:26,954
For how long?
For months, almost a year.

521
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,549
He wanted to know everything.

522
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:32,789
That was how he put it, yes.

523
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,990
Everything.

524
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,132
You're crazy.
They'll never believe you.

525
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,569
It doesn't matter.

526
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,803
Oh, you're going to be infamous, boy.
Take my word for it.

527
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,005
And you know what
such a scandal can do.

528
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,914
It never goes away.
Not for you.

529
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,781
Not for your parents.

530
00:50:55,852 --> 00:51:00,346
And besides, lying to judges and
reporters isn't as easy as you think.

531
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,154
You'd have to be brilliant.
Can you do that?

532
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,194
I know I can.

533
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,630
There's no way in hell...

534
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:12,600
I'm gonna be able to pull myselt out
of a half-year's slide in a few weeks.

535
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,968
- This shit just doesn't happen.
- Boy, the time for discussion is over.

536
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,906
This is the way it is.
You're going to work.

537
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:23,844
You're going to spend the rest of this
quarter and all your vacation studying.

538
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:04,200
<i>...one of the most interesting</i>
<i>writers of his time.</i>

539
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:12,644
<i>...longitude and latitude.</i>
<i>There are coordinates...</i>

540
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:15,048
<i>...both sides by "y,"</i>
<i>leaving you with 3xy</i>...

541
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:25,517
<i>...made some people do what they did,</i>
<i>and other people do nothing at all.</i>

542
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,722
<i>This concludes our week</i>
<i>on the Holocaust.</i>

543
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:32,427
<i>If you wanna know more, you may find</i>
<i>the Santo Donato library an excellent...</i>

544
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,300
<i>You are a monster.</i>

545
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:36,896
<i>Is the thrill enough?</i>

546
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:40,067
- <i>What you have done is a violation.</i>
- <i>I wanted to know more.</i>

547
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:44,842
- <i>I wanted to know more.</i>
<i>- A door had been opened...</i>

548
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:47,405
- <i>I wanted to know more.</i>
- <i>...lose control of their bodies</i>...

549
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,076
<i>- I fucked up.</i>
<i>- You'd have to be brilliant.</i>

550
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:51,814
<i>Lying isn't as easy as you think.</i>

551
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:54,186
- <i>Maybe you just don't like girls.</i>
<i>- He's good at other things.</i>

552
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:57,658
- <i>I'll fix it.</i>
- <i>You gotta start being honest with me.</i>

553
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,924
<i>Boy, be careful.</i>
<i>You play with fire.</i>

554
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,918
<i>It never goes away.</i>

555
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,096
<i>Not for you.</i>

556
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,682
How about some melba toast?

557
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,688
- Sure.
- Sure.

558
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:52,404
I would have expected you
to be doing back tlips...

559
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:55,239
down the hallway
after such good news.

560
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,806
But you're so quiet.

561
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:07,882
Today, I think I will give you
the day off from studying.

562
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:09,891
How's that? Hmm?

563
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,330
How about...

564
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:18,390
one of my stories instead?

565
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:23,404
I still have
a few good ones left.

566
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,475
- I don't care.
- Let's see.

567
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:30,138
I could tell you
about the special soap...

568
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,238
we made.

569
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:36,115
Or there's always the story
of how I escaped from Berlin...

570
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:39,246
after I was so foolish
as to go back.

571
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:42,257
That was a close one,
I can tell you.

572
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,395
No, none of these.

573
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,523
I think you don't seem
to be in the mood.

574
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:55,001
I think today
I will tell you the story...

575
00:57:56,606 --> 00:58:00,508
of an old man who was afraid.

576
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:04,035
He was afraid of
a certain young boy who was...

577
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:06,274
in a clear way...

578
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,283
his triend.

579
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,445
The boy proved
to be a very good student.

580
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:17,624
But not perhaps
in quite the way...

581
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:21,653
his mother and his teachers
had envisioned.

582
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:28,601
At first, the old man
disliked the boy intensely.

583
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:33,370
But then he began to enjoy
the boy's company.

584
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:38,437
Ot course, there is still
a great deal of distrust between them.

585
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:43,812
Each knew something
the other wanted to keep secret.

586
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,414
Over time...

587
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,481
the old man felt...

588
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:52,050
his hold on the boy
slipping away.

589
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:56,326
He thought the day might come
when the boy no longer needed him.

590
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,629
So...

591
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,103
one sleepless night...

592
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,663
the old man got out of bed...

593
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:10,008
and wrote down the story
of his involvement with the boy.

594
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:15,111
Everything he could remember...

595
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,646
from the first day forward.

596
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,190
He wrote how the boy
forced his way...

597
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:28,924
into the old man's house
and blackmailed the old man...

598
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:32,832
to serve his own
morbid tascinations.

599
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,029
When the boy's grades
began to tall...

600
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,834
he blamed the old man
and ordered him...

601
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,843
to impersonate his grandfather.

602
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:45,642
At the end, his hands
were stinging with arthritis...

603
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:48,980
but he telt happy
for the tirst time in weeks.

604
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,656
He telt safe.

605
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:00,428
On the tollowing morning,
the old man...

606
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,488
put on his best suit...

607
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:06,831
and went down to
one of the local banks...

608
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:10,168
and rented a safe deposit box.

609
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:14,734
The bank officer
explained to the old man...

610
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:18,577
that only the old man
could use the old man's key...

611
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,946
with one exception.

612
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,612
The exception was...

613
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:31,354
in the event
of the box holder's death, then...

614
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,289
Then what?

615
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:38,994
The box will be opened
in the presence of a bank official...

616
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:42,629
and a representative
of the Internal Revenue Service.

617
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:46,163
The contents of the box
would be inventoried.

618
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:47,937
But in this case...

619
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:52,072
they would only find
a 12-page document.

620
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:58,151
Nontaxable,
but highly interesting.

621
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:01,753
You didn't do this.
I don't believe you.

622
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,452
My boy...

623
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:06,552
it is already done.

624
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,392
Jesus fucking Christ!
Look at you!

625
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:11,092
You could go at any time.

626
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:15,793
Don't be so theatrical.

627
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:19,069
A man tive or ten years
older than me, worries more...

628
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,770
about his ailing heart
than being...

629
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,438
sent off to Israel.

630
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:28,314
And the day will come,
if I live long enough...

631
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:31,911
when I decide that
what you know no longer matters.

632
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:37,016
But then, and only then,
I will destroy the document.

633
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:39,459
So many things
can happen in between.

634
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,997
Accidents, sickness.

635
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:44,829
You could slip in the fucking shower,
for Christ's sake.

636
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,160
<i>Whatever will be will be</i>

637
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:52,469
<i>The future's not ours to see</i>

638
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,602
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

639
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:05,220
I can see you're
thinking it now, even now.

640
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:09,486
It's in your eyes...
killing me.

641
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,653
All it would take would be
the tlick of a knife.

642
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:17,124
Push me down the steps,
make it look like an accident.

643
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,897
I am old. You are strong.
You're angry.

644
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,530
Good assets for killing.

645
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:27,201
But there is something missing.

646
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:32,871
To have someone
in your control...

647
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:39,549
To have them know
that they are alive...

648
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:44,992
only because you have not
decided to the contrary.

649
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:49,998
Do you have that power?
Ask yourself.

650
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:53,661
It's not an easy question.
I think you know that.

651
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,905
You know this means
we're through, don't you?

652
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,444
You won't be seein' me
around here anymore.

653
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,680
I suppose I won't.

654
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,884
What are you doing?

655
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,897
This is the end.

656
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:28,369
Here.

657
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,368
A drink.

658
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,044
To our lives together.

659
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,478
The beginning and the end.

660
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,781
I think you should
fuck yourselt.>

661
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:53,124
Oh, my dear boy.
Don't you see?

662
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,858
We are fucking each other.

663
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,646
<i>Strike!</i>

664
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,745
Two outs!

665
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:33,763
Strike three!

666
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,435
<i>What are you guys waitin' for?</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

667
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,513
Rebound! Move it!

668
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,096
Watch your step.

669
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,634
Sir?

670
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,636
Excuse me.

671
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,344
I can help you carry those.

672
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:32,108
You don't gotta be afraid.
I can help you.

673
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:35,207
I don't need your help.
Excuse me.

674
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:38,276
I'm not a bad guy.
You don't gotta worry.

675
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:41,881
- Please, I just wanna...
- What do you want?

676
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:45,393
- Why do you bother me?
- We're practically neighbors.

677
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:48,692
You know, I stay
right over there most nights.

678
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:51,289
I mean, I see you
walk down the street.

679
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:54,097
I just wanna help.

680
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,139
- It's called being neighborly.
- Piss off.

681
01:07:57,206 --> 01:08:00,403
You don't...

682
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:03,411
There's no reason to be rude!
No reason!

683
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,875
I know something about you.

684
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,350
I know you're a nice guy.

685
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:18,258
I'm nice too,
just like the boy.

686
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:24,032
I see.

687
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:28,059
I'm not ashamed to say that
I could use a drink about now.

688
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,074
But I don't take no charity.

689
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:36,105
It you were to invite me in
like a friend...

690
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:37,770
then we could have a nice drink.

691
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:39,109
A drink.

692
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,046
That's what I'm sayin'.

693
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:44,678
You smell like a toilet.

694
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,386
Maybe you'll let me
use your shower.

695
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,220
But first a drink.

696
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,692
Then I will do
anything you say.

697
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,775
I had 'em hooked up, rollin'...

698
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,746
41/2.

699
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:15,215
But three minutes,
that was my best.

700
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:18,412
I was, like,
movin' double time.

701
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,684
Gosh, you know...
I didn't...

702
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:25,124
didn't see that dog
in the back seat.

703
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:27,253
- Didn't see it.
- What dog?

704
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,297
That dog.
I heard it barking.

705
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:32,300
But I hear dogs barking all the time,
even when they ain't there.

706
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:35,201
So I didn't pay no mind.

707
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:38,331
D.O.T. Didn't wanna hire me
'cause of that thing with the...

708
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:40,341
Anyway.

709
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:43,274
Who wants to talk about that?

710
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,847
So I was...

711
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:50,886
I was an independent,
you know...

712
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:54,013
which meant that I could go
all over the whole city.

713
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:56,023
You know, I believe...

714
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,927
we need another bottle.

715
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,597
It you're oftering,
then we accept.

716
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:07,467
That's no trouble at all.

717
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,835
Look, why don't you drink mine?

718
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:12,965
Thank you.

719
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:20,941
So, like I was sayin'...

720
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:22,950
I was...

721
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:25,680
I worked as an independent.

722
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:28,416
'Cause the D.O.T.,
they wouldn't hire me, right?

723
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,822
So I was able to go...

724
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:33,862
all over the whole city.

725
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:36,397
Midtown, downtown,
left side, right side...

726
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:39,332
Where is my bottle opener?

727
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:40,925
There it is.

728
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:42,971
You stay right there.

729
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,440
So then I moved on.

730
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:57,383
Washington Heights was good.
It was always good...

731
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:00,081
because there were a lot
of nooks and crannies, you know.

732
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:05,259
The D. R.'s... the Dominicans there,
they liked to...

733
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,852
go around in their cars
like they were buses.

734
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,607
Then they dropped that cinder block
on that cop from three-four.

735
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:24,237
And it got all crazy.
But you gotta be movin', 'cause...

736
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:26,941
they come back, they catch you
hookin' their ride.

737
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,142
Do you mind?

738
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:59,207
No. Not at all.

739
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,957
Maybe in the morning...

740
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:16,589
perhaps everything goes okay,
you could let me have $10.

741
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:20,001
Perhaps.

742
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:24,133
Even a 20...

743
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:27,300
Perhaps. We shall see.

744
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:30,607
You can relax, you know.
I've done this before.

745
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,810
That's all right.

746
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,977
So have I.

747
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:37,848
Let me go pee first.

748
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:52,058
Did you look at this
before you signed it?

749
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,721
That bill was written
in Japanese.

750
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,788
- I told you that.
- Numbers are numbers in any language.

751
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:59,265
That man did not speak
one word of English.

752
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,859
- That's not the point.
- Ot course it's the point.

753
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:05,202
The point is you look at a bill
before you pay it.

754
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:08,710
I did not understand one word.
That's exactly the point.

755
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,335
Hello?

756
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:11,879
Yes.

757
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,574
Maybe it was in yen.

758
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,516
Maybe it is.

759
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:21,211
It's Mr. Denker.
He sounds very anxious.

760
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,359
Why would he be calling
at this hour?

761
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:30,398
- Hello?
- Come over right away, boy.</i>

762
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,094
I'm having a heart attack.

763
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:35,466
A bad one, I think.

764
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:39,132
That sounds exciting, but I
have to study for my trig tinal.

765
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:42,371
I understand you cannot talk,
but you can listen.

766
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:46,938
<i>I cannot call an ambulance.</i>
<i>I need help.</i>

767
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:50,280
And that means you need help.

768
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:52,286
It you put it that way.

769
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:55,118
<i>Tell you parents I have</i>
<i>an important letter...</i>

770
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,819
and I need you
to read it to me.

771
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:00,327
I'll be right over.

772
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,155
Now we'll see
what you're made of.>

773
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:22,974
What happened?

774
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:25,314
Ah, boy.

775
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:28,254
- Where are you bleeding?
- It's not my blood.

776
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:32,855
It was selt- defense.
Boy, now listen.

777
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:35,863
- What are you talking about?
- Shut up.

778
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:39,833
Nobody comes here until you
have done what needs to be done.

779
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,970
Go down the steps.

780
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:55,173
What did you do?

781
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:59,448
Go down the steps, huh?

782
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:01,455
That's right.

783
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:17,637
Let me out!

784
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:20,708
- Let me the fuck outta here!
- No, boy.

785
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:23,904
If you won't help me,
I have to make you.

786
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:25,742
That's enough!

787
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:28,305
Open the goddamned door!
Do you hear me?

788
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:34,653
Fuck you!

789
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:40,059
If you're going to behave
like a fucking schoolgirl, I'll...

790
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,165
I'm gonna break
your goddamn door down!

791
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:47,869
Fuck!

792
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:56,839
Don't be afraid, boy.

793
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:02,677
I know what you're doing.

794
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:05,379
I'm gonna break
the goddamn door down!

795
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:07,422
What are you doing?

796
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,521
There is no point.

797
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:46,118
Why are you doing this?

798
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,387
Call an ambulance.

799
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,195
The key.

800
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:32,666
The key to the safe deposit box.

801
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:35,430
Where is it?

802
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:39,065
Boy, I need a doctor.

803
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:40,904
Now.

804
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:42,910
Give me the key.

805
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:49,514
I'm dying.

806
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:53,987
I know.

807
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:04,591
Oh, no.
Not like this.

808
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,229
Please.

809
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:22,313
<i>You did good, son.</i>

810
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,318
You did real good.

811
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:51,635
It's a good thing you called us
when you did. You saved his life.

812
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,612
Dad.

813
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:31,384
Let's go make sure he gets
checked in all right.

814
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,914
You shouldn't have.

815
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:44,524
It's trom my mother.

816
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:54,591
They say the operation
was a success.

817
01:22:56,471 --> 01:23:00,202
They say I have
another 20 years.

818
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,301
A new lease on life.

819
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:23,492
I took care of everything,
except for the key. Where is it?

820
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:34,240
There's no safe deposit box.

821
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,778
There never was.

822
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:40,511
I lied.

823
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:46,848
I had to protect myself
trom you, boy.

824
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:48,855
You understand?

825
01:23:55,797 --> 01:24:00,791
I suspect that we will
never see each other again.

826
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,030
- No, we won't.
- Wait.

827
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:07,200
I want to ask you something.

828
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:11,468
What?

829
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:16,547
What did it feel like?

830
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:29,120
- I better go.
- Wait.

831
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:34,093
Perhaps I...

832
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:36,797
Perhaps I could
persuade you to stay.

833
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:39,271
Just until I fall asleep.

834
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:42,173
My medicine makes me drowsy.

835
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,480
Please?

836
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:20,210
Excuse me, young man.

837
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:23,739
You are a very good boy to visit
your grandtather like that.

838
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:26,252
Thank you,
but he's just a triend.

839
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:30,052
Then you are
a very good triend.

840
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,092
Tell me.

841
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:37,027
Is he very bad off?
He doesn't talk much.

842
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:40,693
- The doctors say he'll be out soon.
- That's good news.

843
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:45,068
From the way he speaks,
I would guess he was German.

844
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,473
- From the south, I think.
- I don't know.

845
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:52,672
I wonder it he was in the war.

846
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,682
I don't think so.
He's never mentioned it, anyway.

847
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:58,776
It doesn't matter,
I suppose.

848
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:01,287
It was a long time ago,
the war.

849
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:03,722
Soon, in this country...

850
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:08,922
we will have a president
born after the war was over.

851
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,931
How about that?

852
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:15,327
- I'm sure you're right.
- He is so very lucky...

853
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:17,394
to have you.

854
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:19,770
A great man once said...

855
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,775
''No man is an island...

856
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:24,437
entire of itself.>"

857
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,672
John Donne.

858
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:29,840
- Have a nice evening, sir.
- Good-bye.

859
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,891
<i>Mr. Jefferson, I don't have to</i>
<i>listen to that kind of talk.</i>

860
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:48,492
<i>Then how about</i>
<i>this kind of talk?</i>

861
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:57,969
<i>That's just a warning.</i>

862
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:03,911
<i>Anytime you crave for Florence's food,</i>
<i>that's a weird craving.</i>

863
01:27:03,985 --> 01:27:06,283
<i>Jenny's the one who's pregnant.</i>

864
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:08,447
<i>They said they had</i>
<i>something to tell us.</i>

865
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:13,483
<i>- Something important.</i>
- O<i>h, we're gonna be grandparents again!</i>

866
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:16,553
<i>Oh, I just can't wait</i>
<i>to tell everybody!</i>

867
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:04,244
<i>Hey, Ralph. Great!</i>

868
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:06,473
<i>Huh? Thanks, Ralph.</i>

869
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:11,348
<i>The kids just got out of a cab.</i>
<i>They should be here any second.</i>

870
01:29:16,818 --> 01:29:18,979
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

871
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:57,223
Yes.

872
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:58,883
I'm speaking to you.

873
01:30:20,782 --> 01:30:24,013
Mr. Kramer
is recuperating elsewhere.

874
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:27,816
- Are you awake now, Dussander?
- Yes, of course.

875
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:31,791
But you seem to have
confused me with someone else.

876
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:36,059
My name is Denker.

877
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:39,429
Perhaps you need
a different room.

878
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,266
My name is Weiskopf,
and you are Kurt Dussander.

879
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:45,862
No, I don't know
no one by that name.

880
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:47,900
Should I call a nurse?

881
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:55,015
The man in the next bed
was Benjamin Kramer.

882
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:58,245
He was imprisoned
for ten months at Patin.

883
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:02,119
You were responsible for the death
of his wite and two daughters.

884
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:05,523
My name is Denker.
Arthur Denker.

885
01:31:05,593 --> 01:31:07,925
- I am an American.
- Please, don't bother.

886
01:31:07,995 --> 01:31:13,490
Your papers won't stand up
to serious examination and you know it.

887
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:16,435
- I think we have all we need here.
- Who are these men?

888
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:18,665
I'm Dan Richler,
special agent with the F.B.I...

889
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:20,707
and this is Detective Getty
with the L.A.P.D.

890
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:23,243
And I think you know
who I work for.

891
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,871
When you regain your strength,
you will be moved.

892
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:29,474
Until then, this entire ward
will be under guard.

893
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:34,317
You can expect to be in Jerusalem
by the end of the summer.

894
01:31:52,573 --> 01:31:56,009
- So where do you want us to sit?
- Anywhere but the front row.

895
01:31:56,077 --> 01:31:59,569
- Yeah? There's, uh, Carla.
- Carla! How are you?

896
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:02,207
- Hi. Hi, Chelsea.
- I thought that was you.

897
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:06,720
Hi. Congratulations.
It's a big day for everybody.

898
01:32:06,787 --> 01:32:08,846
- How are you?
- Excuse me.

899
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:20,332
You did it. I knew you could.
I am so proud of you.

900
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:22,961
- Thank you.
- Oh, hi. These must be your parents.

901
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:26,837
- Yeah. Dick Bowden. Nice to meet you.
- Ed French.

902
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:30,469
- Todd pulled one off. You must be proud.
- Yes, we are.

903
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,775
- This is my wite, Monica.
- Hi.

904
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:36,783
- Are you a teacher of Todd's?
- Actually, I'm his guidance counselor.

905
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:39,115
- Oh, great.
- Nice to meet you.

906
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:42,280
Yeah. I was looking forward to seeing
your grandtather, Victor. Where is he?

907
01:32:42,356 --> 01:32:47,055
It's a long trip trom Charlotte. He's
been in a wheelchair for a few years.

908
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:49,358
So they don't
get out here much.

909
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:51,398
Usually Thanksgiving.

910
01:32:53,768 --> 01:32:56,032
I'm-I'm sorry.
I don't...

911
01:32:56,103 --> 01:32:58,537
I don't understand.

912
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:01,631
That's your cue.

913
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:04,735
That's my cue. Okay.
Good luck up there.

914
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:07,042
- Nice to meet you.
- Take care, Ed.

915
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:15,719
I don't feel so well. Maybe after
the ceremony, we could go straight home.

916
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:19,226
- Are you okay?
- You know what? It's probably nerves.

917
01:33:19,293 --> 01:33:22,888
- Just take a deep breath.
- We'll see how it goes.

918
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:30,836
<i>All great achievements</i>
<i>arose from dissatisfaction.</i>

919
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:37,335
It is the desire
to do better...

920
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:39,345
to dig deeper...

921
01:33:39,413 --> 01:33:42,746
that propels a civilization
to greatness.

922
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:44,978
All of us have heard
the story of Icarus...

923
01:33:46,654 --> 01:33:49,555
the young boy who took the wings
his father built for him...

924
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:54,118
<i>wings that were meant</i>
<i>to carry him over the ocean to freedom</i>...

925
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:57,528
<i>and used them instead</i>
<i>for a joyride.</i>

926
01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:11,876
For a brief moment...

927
01:34:11,946 --> 01:34:14,608
Icarus felt what it was like
to live as a god...

928
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:17,082
to touch the sun...

929
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:19,642
to soar above the common man.

930
01:34:20,688 --> 01:34:24,124
And for doing so,
he paid the ultimate price.

931
01:34:25,693 --> 01:34:28,890
You boys better come down to the cellar.
You're not gonna believe this.

932
01:34:28,963 --> 01:34:32,899
<i>Like Icarus, we too</i>
<i>have been given gifts:</i>

933
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:35,959
Knowledge, education...

934
01:34:36,037 --> 01:34:38,471
experience.

935
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,571
<i>And with these gifts comes</i>
<i>the responsibility of choice.</i>

936
01:34:43,644 --> 01:34:47,239
We alone decide how our talents
are bestowed upon the world.

937
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:49,578
This is our destiny...

938
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:53,177
<i>and we hold it in</i>
<i>the palm of our hands.</i>

939
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:52,278
<i>...of an investigation</i>
<i>by local police...</i>

940
01:35:52,346 --> 01:35:54,405
<i>the sheriff's department,</i>
<i>F.B.I...</i>

941
01:35:54,482 --> 01:35:56,712
<i>and the Department of Justice.</i>

942
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:59,776
<i>Police have confirmed that</i>
<i>a body has been found...</i>

943
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:02,345
<i>in the basement</i>
<i>of Arthur Denker...</i>

944
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:05,415
<i>the Santo Donato resident</i>
<i>believed to be...</i>

945
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:07,461
<i>a Nazi war criminal.</i>

946
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:10,656
<i>The cause of death</i>
<i>has not been revealed...</i>

947
01:36:10,731 --> 01:36:13,825
<i>and authorities are withholding</i>
<i>identification of the body...</i>

948
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:16,631
<i>until more information</i>
<i>is available.</i>

949
01:36:16,704 --> 01:36:20,367
<i>The apprehension of Dussander</i>
<i>would bring to a close...</i>

950
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:25,401
<i>a manhunt that's been underway now</i>
<i>for 40 years in three continents.</i>

951
01:36:36,257 --> 01:36:38,191
I'll be taking
care of you trom now on.

952
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:42,119
Try to relax.

953
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,894
Todd, I'm Dan Richler.
I'm a special agent with the F.B.I.

954
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:52,132
And this is Dr. Weiskopt.> If you
don't mind, I'd like to hear about...

955
01:36:52,206 --> 01:36:54,140
your involvement with Dussander.

956
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:56,870
Well, actually, you knew him
as Arthur Denker. Isn't that right?

957
01:36:56,944 --> 01:36:59,606
- Yes.
- How did you know him?

958
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:02,114
Are you sure you
feel up to this?

959
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:04,117
Yeah, I'll be fine.

960
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:13,418
<i>Let me tell you</i>
<i>what we're interested in.</i>

961
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:15,792
You told the admitting nurse
that Arthur Denker...

962
01:37:15,863 --> 01:37:18,457
had a heart attack
while you were reading him a letter.

963
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:21,968
- Yes.
- Was it in English or German?

964
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:23,435
German.

965
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:27,668
- You speak German?
- No.

966
01:37:27,741 --> 01:37:30,005
So you had no idea
what you were reading.

967
01:37:30,077 --> 01:37:34,741
No. But he seemed to understand
every word I was saying.

968
01:37:40,421 --> 01:37:44,448
What we can't seem to tigure out
is the letter, Todd.

969
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:47,517
Do you have any idea
what happened to it?

970
01:37:47,595 --> 01:37:50,291
I guess it's still on the table.
I couldn't swear to it, though.

971
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:52,889
- Then it still should be there.
- It isn't?

972
01:37:52,967 --> 01:37:55,993
No. Well, when you arrived, Mr. Bowden,
do you remember seeing a letter?

973
01:37:57,938 --> 01:38:01,635
But I wasn't looking for a letter.
I was more concerned about Todd.

974
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:03,472
Maybe somebody
broke in and took it.

975
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:06,172
Why would somebody break
into a house simply to steal a letter?

976
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:09,011
Unless, of course,
they wanted to protect him.

977
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:12,382
You know, a close triend,
another fugitive.

978
01:38:12,453 --> 01:38:14,819
Look, I know all this sounds like
Robert Ludlum kind of stuff...

979
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:18,154
but we think that while
Dussander was in the hospital...

980
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:23,492
our "Mr. X" scooted
over to the house and swiped the letter.

981
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:26,692
- That doesn't make sense.
- Why not?

982
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:31,338
Well, it he had
an old Nazi buddy in town...

983
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:33,396
why didn't he come over
and read the letter himselt?

984
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:36,637
Well, maybe he's in a wheelchair.
Or maybe he's blind.

985
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:41,511
Well, guys that are blind don't normally
go scooting out to steal letters.

986
01:38:44,151 --> 01:38:46,847
Did he ever talk
about his past?

987
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,926
Excuse me, Dr. Weiskopt.>
I'm just curious.

988
01:38:55,996 --> 01:38:58,829
- What kind of doctor are you?
- I'm a schoolteacher.

989
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:04,497
Dr. Weiskopf is a professor
at the Judaic Institute in Munich.

990
01:39:04,571 --> 01:39:07,563
He assists the Israeli government
in certain matters.

991
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:47,212
Hey, buddy?

992
01:39:47,281 --> 01:39:49,078
You okay?

993
01:39:51,085 --> 01:39:52,416
Yeah, I'm fine.

994
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:54,647
- You sure?
- Yeah.

995
01:39:57,624 --> 01:40:01,560
I just can't believe it,
even after what those guys told me.

996
01:40:01,628 --> 01:40:04,825
- It's mind-boggling.
- Your mother and I teel terrible.

997
01:40:04,898 --> 01:40:06,957
It's like we let you down.

998
01:40:07,034 --> 01:40:09,935
It's not your fault.

999
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:13,770
We're gonna go down
and talk to a lawyer. He's very good.

1000
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:17,402
It's nothing for you to worry about.
It's just I don't trust these cops.

1001
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:22,745
- Okay. I think that's a good idea.
- Yeah.

1002
01:40:22,816 --> 01:40:25,717
Well, your old man's on top of this,
all right? We'll take care of this.

1003
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:29,147
I know.

1004
01:40:30,491 --> 01:40:33,085
- Dad?
- Yeah?

1005
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:36,261
I really never knew
anything about this.

1006
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:41,256
- I never thought you did.
- I know.

1007
01:40:42,069 --> 01:40:44,037
See you later.

1008
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:52,010
Are you going to talk
to the boy again?

1009
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:56,141
- I don't think so.
- Somehow, he didn't even...

1010
01:41:00,354 --> 01:41:02,948
When you were a boy...

1011
01:41:03,023 --> 01:41:05,389
what did you do for fun?

1012
01:41:06,493 --> 01:41:07,790
Went to the movies.

1013
01:41:09,630 --> 01:41:11,325
Why? What'd you do?

1014
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:14,233
I used to chase girls.

1015
01:41:17,704 --> 01:41:20,434
And now, I chase old men.

1016
01:41:49,803 --> 01:41:52,101
Special Agent Richler,
Dr. Weiskopt...

1017
01:41:52,172 --> 01:41:54,367
this is the hospital administrator,
Dr. McCormick.

1018
01:41:54,441 --> 01:41:56,636
His chief of statt,
Dr. Sfewart.

1019
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:58,837
- How do you do?
- Hello, ma'am.

1020
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:02,109
- Do we have a plan?
- McCormick's arranged an exit for us.

1021
01:42:14,261 --> 01:42:16,786
- Mr. French.
- Hello, Todd.

1022
01:42:16,864 --> 01:42:18,923
What are you doing here?

1023
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:30,569
I came by to see your parents.
Are they home?

1024
01:42:30,644 --> 01:42:32,976
No. What about?

1025
01:42:33,046 --> 01:42:35,537
That's between
me and your parents.

1026
01:42:35,616 --> 01:42:37,777
Why isn't it between
you and me?

1027
01:42:39,386 --> 01:42:41,650
Do you want to tell me what happened?

1028
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:46,615
He needs to be turned
on his left side.

1029
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:49,879
- Watch his line.
- Get him over.

1030
01:43:51,191 --> 01:43:53,216
I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1031
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:55,887
Well, you're gonna have
to tell me something.

1032
01:43:57,731 --> 01:44:01,326
I can tell you that it'd be better
it we both just forgot about that.

1033
01:44:02,803 --> 01:44:04,771
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

1034
01:44:10,477 --> 01:44:12,104
Get the crash cart!
Stat!

1035
01:44:15,515 --> 01:44:19,042
<i>Why don't you tell your parents</i>
<i>I'll be back to see them later.</i>

1036
01:44:23,290 --> 01:44:26,020
- What?
- I thought we had a deal here.

1037
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:28,459
"Pull up your grades
and the world will open up for you."

1038
01:44:28,528 --> 01:44:31,088
What do you mean? You want me
to just forget about this?

1039
01:44:31,164 --> 01:44:33,223
I just want to go to college
and get on with my life.

1040
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:36,531
Todd, okay. You know, we're not gonna
talk about this right now.

1041
01:44:36,603 --> 01:44:40,903
It was a mistake to come here.
I'll do this over the phone.

1042
01:44:40,974 --> 01:44:43,033
Clear the way!

1043
01:44:44,745 --> 01:44:47,942
Can I ask you something, Ed?
You don't mind it I call you Ed, do you?

1044
01:44:48,015 --> 01:44:50,609
Now that I'm out of
your fucking high school.

1045
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:57,989
- Does it ever work?
- What?

1046
01:44:58,058 --> 01:45:00,720
I really wanna know. Does it ever work,
or am I the tirst one?

1047
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:03,922
'Cause if I'm the first, I'm flattered,
but somehow I can't believe that.

1048
01:45:03,997 --> 01:45:08,195
Not after you tixing my grades.
And giving me your home phone number?

1049
01:45:08,268 --> 01:45:10,202
And then you come out here
when my parents aren't home.

1050
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:13,865
- What are you talking about?
- I mean, you've got some balls.

1051
01:45:15,542 --> 01:45:17,635
Is this why
your wife left you?

1052
01:45:25,519 --> 01:45:28,955
<i>You must have really wanted</i>
<i>to shake my hand. Or something else.</i>

1053
01:45:29,022 --> 01:45:30,489
Now, wait a minute.
What are you...

1054
01:45:30,557 --> 01:45:33,617
Are you gonna tell people
I did something to you?

1055
01:45:33,694 --> 01:45:36,891
I don't wanna drag you down
with me, but I will.

1056
01:45:36,963 --> 01:45:39,557
- I'm better at this than you are.
- Better at what?

1057
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:41,567
I'm trying to help you.
Can't you see that?

1058
01:45:41,635 --> 01:45:44,069
- You've helped enough.
- Well, I won't just do nothing.

1059
01:45:44,137 --> 01:45:46,230
Well, you're gonna
fucking have to!

1060
01:45:47,708 --> 01:45:50,506
- Still a flat line.
- Clear!

1061
01:45:50,577 --> 01:45:55,742
The things I'm gonna say,
they'll never go away.

1062
01:45:55,816 --> 01:45:57,807
Not for you.

1063
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:01,186
Think of your job.

1064
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:05,449
Think of your son.

1065
01:46:05,525 --> 01:46:06,822
<i>And clear!</i>

1066
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:23,542
So, what's the story here, Ed?

1067
01:46:26,413 --> 01:46:27,937
Do we have a deal?

1068
01:46:34,521 --> 01:46:36,614
You can't do this.

1069
01:46:38,925 --> 01:46:41,291
You have no idea
what I can do.

1167
01:46:46,925 --> 01:47:16,291
