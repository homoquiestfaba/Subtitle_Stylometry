It's a shame the volcano will destroy it

00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:26,803
and yet another small step-

497
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:28,806
What are you doing out here?

498
00:30:28,874 --> 00:30:30,808
Whoa!
{Groaning}

499
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:32,673
Testing for gravity?

500
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:35,042
- Yeah, it works.
- Who authorized you to open the hatch?

501
00:30:35,113 --> 00:30:36,580
Commander.

502
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:38,548
Commander?

503
00:30:38,617 --> 00:30:41,142
{Sighs}
You are a liability to this mission.

504
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:43,153
Ha! Liability?

505
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:46,748
I was steering this crate while you and
Commander Coma were sawing logs!

506
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:50,090
You stayed awake, and you didn't
activate the landing sequence?

507
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:52,153
- That's all you had to do.
- Not true.

508
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,425
I was catching up on my panicking.

509
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:56,433
{Gasps}
No! Don't!

510
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:58,867
- What?
- The air could be poisonous!

511
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:00,962
{Gasping}
Oh, no!

512
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,406
Poisonous air!
{Choking}

513
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:07,845
<i>- Lieutenant's log.
- Choking.</i>

514
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:10,074
<i>- Air is breathable.
- Gasping.</i>

515
00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:14,414
- The temperature is normal.
- Dying. {Wheezing}

516
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:16,545
Winning daytime Emmy.

517
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:19,852
And there is no sign of intelligent life.

518
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:22,189
Blah!

519
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,058
Look, the planet has three suns.

520
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,961
<i>Amazing.</i>

521
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:30,524
Just like every science fiction movie involving
another planet guessed there would be.

522
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:38,908
As you all know,
tomorrow is Triple Sunday!

523
00:31:38,977 --> 00:31:43,641
<i>Our three suns will come together as one
and the volcano will explode!</i>

524
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:47,446
<i>And in honour of this special day,
and more importantly, me...</i>

525
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,920
I'm throwing a celebration,
a sort of palace-warming party.

526
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:53,219
- Your overlord!
- What?

527
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:56,226
- Another metal beast fell from the sky!
- A metal beast?

528
00:31:56,294 --> 00:31:58,228
- Like this one?
- Only bigger!

529
00:31:58,296 --> 00:32:00,457
- {All Gasping}
- {Echoing} Only bigger! Only bigger!

530
00:32:00,532 --> 00:32:03,467
- Bigger than mine?
- It's not the size of the beast.

531
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:06,470
It's what you do with it
that matters, my lord.

532
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:08,165
- Traitor!
- I-I'm not a traitor!

533
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,970
- Then take it back.
- Uh, okay. I take it back.

534
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:13,909
You can't take it back,
now it's out there. They all heard.

535
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:16,311
<i>- You all heard, right?
- {Onlookers Affirming}</i>

536
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:18,246
{Screaming}

537
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:22,946
- Oh!
- Splork!

538
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:26,149
- Uh, me?
- Congratulations! You're the general.

539
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:28,692
Take a party of warriors
and bring me the sky beast.

540
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,321
Uh, okay, the tall guy,
you with the red belly...

541
00:32:32,397 --> 00:32:35,560
<i>guy with the pointy hat
and the splotchy one at the back.</i>

542
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:37,795
I'm always picked last.

543
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:39,803
- Mount up!
- {Shouting}

544
00:32:45,577 --> 00:32:49,377
<i>{Grumbles}
Take the Fluvians!</i>

545
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,938
{Shouting Enthusiastically}

546
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:59,889
<i>Imagine, we're the first astronauts
to ever set foot on this planet.</i>

547
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:02,392
<i>These photos will be front-page news.</i>

548
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,655
The most important images
of the century!

549
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:06,663
<i>- Can you get one of my good side?
- {Sighs}</i>

550
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:08,722
Oops. Forgot. I'm all good side.

551
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,633
Maybe take one of me looking heroically,
with my chin like this?

552
00:33:11,703 --> 00:33:13,637
<i>- Oh, and another one like this.
- Clown.</i>

553
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:15,730
Ever alert. Brooding.

554
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:19,038
Poised to strike. Candid.

555
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,237
Laughing candid.

556
00:33:21,313 --> 00:33:23,247
I've been naughty.

557
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:24,907
{Sighs}

558
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:27,577
Huh? Hmm.

559
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:30,314
Wait, Luna.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

560
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:33,323
This is the first sign of complex life
on an alien planet!

561
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:36,758
- Astronauts gather knowledge. It's what we do.
- I'd just be a little careful.

562
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,762
You? Careful?
{Chuckles}

563
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,765
<i>I'm just saying, that looks like a flower
used by Piddles the Clown.</i>

564
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:44,028
I gotta hear this.

565
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:46,036
<i>{Ham}
Piddles is a very cute clown...</i>

566
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:49,369
<i>who has a cute little box
covered with cute little flowers.</i>

567
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:53,241
<i>The kids think it's the sweetest thing
they've ever seen, until-</i>

568
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:55,404
Boo! A giant snake pops out.

569
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,938
Please. I'm a trained astronaut.
I know what I'm doing.

570
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:01,679
Trained astronaut?
Space chimps are a joke.

571
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:04,688
Is that what you think
of your grandfather?

572
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:07,418
Just pick your flowers
and let's get back to Earth.

573
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:10,950
If there's no traffic in the wormhole,
I can still make the 8:00 show at the circus.

574
00:34:11,029 --> 00:34:15,261
- Uptight, scientific, bookworm chimp lady.
- Hmm. {Gasps}

575
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,460
- {Screaming}
- {Shrieking}

576
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:24,502
- What does Piddles do next?
- He usually throws a bucket
of confetti on the audience...

577
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:26,908
and then runs around
smashing pies in his own face.

578
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:31,077
I don't think that's goanna help us here.

579
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:34,380
<i>My Simian Space Manual. There must
be something in here about what to do.</i>

580
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:36,386
"Alien captures. Alien uprisings.

581
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:39,287
- How to say no to an alien probe."
- Manual override!

582
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:46,497
Confetti. I can't explain it.
It just scares things.

583
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:49,226
- You sure they're not scared of them?
- Huh?

584
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,097
{Shouting}

585
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:54,661
I know this sounds crazy, but I think
these guys are goanna be super chill.

586
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,436
- Death to strangers!
- Ooh, great name for a band.

587
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,978
{Yelling}

588
00:35:01,045 --> 00:35:03,240
Titan! Wake up!

589
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:05,509
The sky beast is ours!

590
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,312
Quick, this way!

591
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:11,253
- But we can't leave the ship, or Titan!
- Looks like they're leaving' us.

592
00:35:11,322 --> 00:35:15,019
<i>- Return to Lord Zartog!

594

Get them! Fire!

595
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:25,092
You should've never left the ship!
This is all your fault!

596
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,797
Me? I didn't sign up for this!

597
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:30,705
I should be in the makeup trailer,
not stuck on an alien planet, saving you!

598
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:35,474
<i>You saving me? I'm the astronaut here.
You're just a P.R. stunt!</i>

<i>{Groans}</i>

600
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:40,684
Wow, you are really sinking low.

601
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:42,686
Yeah, well, you deserve it.

602
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:45,518
- No. I mean you're literally getting lower.
We're sinking!
- Aah!

603
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,615
I can't get out!

604
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:52,220
Like we say in the circus, " The show ain't over
till the bearded lady shaves her back!"

605
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:55,630
- Ew.
- It's as gross as it sounds too. {Shudders}

606
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:58,832
Ham!

607
00:35:58,903 --> 00:36:02,737
Climb on my shoulders and grab that vine!
{Grunting}

608
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:07,634
Excuse me. That's my leg.

609
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,541
- They're in the swamp!
- Attack!

610
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:13,243
- Now what?
- Swing, very stiff one.

611
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:16,515
Swing like the wind!
Release your inner chimp!

612
00:36:17,555 --> 00:36:19,989
Come on, Luna.
Like you're on a trapeze.

613
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:24,688
- I'm not from the circus.
- Life's a circus, Luna. Only the tents get bigger.

614
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:27,492
Fire!

615
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:29,999
Tarzan yell!

616
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:35,496
Ham! I can't do this! I'm goanna fall!

617
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:39,873
- Yes, you can, Luna! You can do this!
- I can't!

618
00:36:39,944 --> 00:36:43,675
Use your shoulders, kick your legs,
swing and let go.

619
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:47,240
Shoulders, legs, swing, let go.

- You're getting' it! The chimp has been released!

623

627
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,406
Just a couple of chimps swinging' through

00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:48,412
Oh, yes, it is.
And I really hope to see you again.

641
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:50,777
Because we're about to... fall!

642
00:37:50,848 --> 00:37:53,442
Ham, what do we do now?

643
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:55,418
Aim for the soft patch.

644
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:59,923
Spread your arms wide.
Chin down. Thumbs in.

645
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:02,186
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- Are you kidding me?

646
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,455
I do this every day of the week.

647

Come on, Ham.

656
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:33,282
I'm sorry I was rough on you.

657
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:38,022
Sure, you were irresponsible,
dangerous and undisciplined...

658
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:40,189
but you saved my life.

659
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:45,065
And you were kind of funny in an
unbelievably annoying way. And you were-

660
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:47,070
- Cute?
- No.

661
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:48,696
- Handsome?
- No.

662
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:50,798
Like Brad Pitt,
but way shorter and more hairy?

663
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,206
- {Groans}
- What?

664
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,071
Luna, do you copy?

665
00:38:54,145 --> 00:38:56,579
- {Luna} Let me just say one thing.
- Luna's alive.

666
00:38:56,648 --> 00:39:00,379
You are the most annoying, obnoxious,
self-cantered creature I have ever met.

667
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:03,386
- Ham's alive.
- Luna? Ham? Do you read me? Come in.

668
00:39:03,454 --> 00:39:05,388
{Luna}
You're an embarrassment.

669
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:07,686
We can hear them,
but they can't hear us.

670
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:10,091
We'll need to calibrate
the Gregorian array...

671
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:12,595
replace the helix mirror
and cross-feed the surrounding shroud.

672
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:15,656
The only word I understood was "feed."

673
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:19,225
Mission log. We are stranded
on a hostile alien planet.

674
00:39:19,303 --> 00:39:21,237
Commander Titan has been kidnapped.

675
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:23,239
- And we're falling in love!
- No, we're not!

676
00:39:23,307 --> 00:39:25,901
Ignore that last part. Delete! Delete!

677
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:28,844
- Kidnapped?
- Stranded? We gotta get moving', kid.

678
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:31,313
We've lost our ship
and have only 22 hours...

679
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:34,351
before the automatic pilot engages
and we're stuck here forever.

680
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:36,353
Whoa. What?
What do you mean, "stuck"?

681
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:40,380
The ship has a safety program to automatically
fly back to Earth 24 hours after we land.

682
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,392
It was in your manual.

683
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:47,090
Was that before or after the chapter on the
fleet of rescue ships they'll send to save us?

684
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:50,464
- Ham, we got one chance of getting home.
- I've had worse odds than that.

685
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:52,526
Let's get moving.

686
00:40:02,046 --> 00:40:05,880
Behold Sky Beast Two, the sequel!

687
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,474

Don't worry. You didn't wake me.</i>

691
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:15,950
{Yawns}
I needed to get up.

692
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:17,961
I am Commander Titan.

693
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:21,055
I have travelled through space
in search of knowledge...

694
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:23,066
to explore the outer reaches
of the universe...

695
00:40:23,134 --> 00:40:26,331
make first contact with aliens
like yourselves...

696
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:30,738
seal you in Mylar wrap and take you
to my home planet to be dissected.

697
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:33,140
- Dissected?
- Oh, you know.

698
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:37,409
We lay you down on some nice wax paper,
slice you open with a butter knife.

699
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:38,471
Oh?

700
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:40,540
But first, you'll need to form a line...

701
00:40:40,618 --> 00:40:43,849
so that I can label and catalogue you.

702
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:47,924
- Organism one, organism two-
- {Groans}

703
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:49,960
- Organism three.
- {Groans}

704
00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:53,258
I am Lord Zartog,
ruler of the planet Malgor.

705
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:56,300
Zartog, eh?
Your parents named you that?

706
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:58,597
'Cause you are different.
{Chuckles}

707
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:02,036
- I like you. Is that, uh, with one "G" or two?
- {Growls}

708
00:41:02,106 --> 00:41:04,267
<i>- {Groans}

- {Groans}

710
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:09,404
- Organism four, organism five.
- Ow!

711
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,540
Ah, there's- {Chuckles}
There's a lot of you. Whoa.

712
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:15,051
<i>Whoa there, mister.
That's space agency property.</i>

713
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,681
You're in direct violation
of interstellar protocol.

714
00:41:19,757 --> 00:41:23,989
But, if you cooperate with me,
I will ask the tribunal to go easy on you.

715
00:41:24,061 --> 00:41:27,622
Cooperate with you?
I'm going to destroy you.

716
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:30,895
I appreciate your honesty.
You're a good man, "Zartig."

717
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:32,833
- {Grunts}
- And a worthy adversary.

718
00:41:32,904 --> 00:41:36,465
- Be proud.
- {Groans} Prepare to be frozen forever.

719
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:41,240
Ha! You don't even know how to use
the reticulating micro movement device.

720
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:44,338
Even a first-year cadet
knows how to do that.

721
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:50,750
Hmm. Will you show me
the secrets of the beast?

722
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:53,814
Negative. You're not trained.
You're not qualified.

723
00:41:53,891 --> 00:41:55,825
You're not even insured.

724
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:58,828
{Whining}
Please? I'll do anything.

725
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:01,091
You could help me find my crew.

726
00:42:01,165 --> 00:42:05,499
- There are more?
- Two others. We, uh, lost them
in Gunglevik Jungle.

727
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,834
What kind of idiot would go in there?

728
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:09,904
Ham.

729
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,076
{Ham} You gotta admit. Being on
a weird alien planet is almost cool.

730
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:23,848
All my life, I dreamed of being
a real astronaut, just like your grandfather.

731
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:27,857
- And here I am.
- Real astronauts? Wake up, Luna.

732
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:30,553
The only reason we're here
is to see if we explode in space.

733
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:33,222
You're wrong.
We are real astronauts.

734
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:34,628
- Whoa.
- Ham.

735
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:37,691
Which one of us
lost our flashlight... that moves...

736
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:41,363
<i>really fast behind rocks

737
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:43,703

00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:45,901
Please, I mean you no harm.

739
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:48,275

Oh, great. It's drunk.

742
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,745
I'm the last free Luzian from the village
of Killawallawazoowahooweewee.

743
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:00,390
We come from Earth.

747

You don't need to be scared of us.
We're your friends.

- {Gulping Sounds}
- Are you alone?

753
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:32,488
Yes. My village was imprisoned
by Zartog and his sky beast.

754
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:36,356
Its metal claws gave him
the power to enslave the planet.

755
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:40,363
Metal claws. The rover!
We, too, came from the stars.

756
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:42,296
Yes. I saw you crash.

757
00:43:42,366 --> 00:43:45,062
You saw that? That was me!

758
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:47,798
- What?
- Do you know where our ship is?

759
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:49,965
- At Zartog's palace.
- Can you lead us there?

760
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:54,000
- {Shrieks}
- Don't worry. We'll protect you,
Killawallazallawallakillazella.

761
00:43:54,078 --> 00:43:57,275
Oh, let's just call her Kilowatt,
or we'll be here all day.

762
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:02,284
- Or night.
- We will set off in the morning.

<i>The journey is perilous.

00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:38,349

777
00:44:57,441 --> 00:45:01,070
Yep. Just one of the benefits

Well, I really need a Snicker's bar.
I don't know about you.

789

790
00:46:01,806 --> 00:46:04,434
Wow. This is even better
than circus peanuts.

791
00:46:04,508 --> 00:46:07,534
I still can't believe the grandson

We're sorry, Kilowatt.

797
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:26,963
Why would you build
a machine like that?

798
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:29,693
- We didn't. The humans did.
- What are humans?

799

That is a glop hopper.

Man, I love these dudes. Come on!

824
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:13,561
They don't call me
the "Hamster" for nothing.

825
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:17,198
You know, 'cause, like, my name is Ham
and I'm running in a wheel.

826
00:48:18,209 --> 00:48:22,646
- Never mind.
- Ah! Whoa! Ow! Ow! Ahh.

833
00:48:38,963 --> 00:48:40,624
We really gotta work on stopping.

834
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:45,461
No, no, wait. Don't leave, gumdrop people.
Your stopping skills are great!

835
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:48,767
They are afraid. It is the Cave
of the Flesh-Devouring Beast.

836
00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:53,173
<i>{Ham}
What is with this planet?</i>

837
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:55,838
Would it kill you to have
a Cave of Cute Little Kittens?

838
00:48:55,913 --> 00:48:58,313
Ham, we got to finish this mission.

839
00:48:58,382 --> 00:49:00,407
We only have 12 hours
till the ship takes off.

840
00:49:00,484 --> 00:49:03,578
Through the cave
is the only way to your ship.

845

Beyond anything Malgor has ever seen.

846
00:49:22,506 --> 00:49:26,943
You'll need streamers.
Nothing' screams "festive" like streamers.

847
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:31,141
I love 'em. Oh, and, uh, some, uh,
goody bags for when your guests leave.

848
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:35,549
It's a fun, simple way to say,
"Thanks for coming'."

849

<i>Splork, grab a pad.</i>

850
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:40,454
- Uh-
- {Ham} Maybe we'll get lucky...

851
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:43,857
and this beast will only devour
our flesh with his eyes.

852
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:45,952
- {Whimpering}
- Ham?

853

- Cannot. Too scared.

- But if we can't get out of here, we're dead!
- {Shrieks}

868
00:50:28,339 --> 00:50:31,035
- That is not helping.
- Okay, here's a trick.

869
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:33,076
To control your fear,
imagine what you're most afraid of...

870
00:50:33,143 --> 00:50:35,077
and then imagine overcoming it.

871

872
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:42,779

- Come on. You can do it, Kilowatt.

873
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:46,719
<i>- {Ham} Be brave.
- Okay. Control your fear.</i>

874
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,281
Control your fear.
Control your fear.

875
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,294
Control your fear.
Control your fear.

876
00:50:51,362 --> 00:50:53,353

but you showed me how to control it.

885

Kilowatt, no!
What are you doing?

886
00:51:25,529 --> 00:51:27,497
- What I must.
- Kilowatt.

- Why did she do that?
- {Sighing}

893
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:53,383
Oh, so stupid... and brave.

Oh, it's making me
feel weird... and depressed.

898
00:52:10,507 --> 00:52:15,035
I shouldn't even be here.
I'm just a low-rent circus chimp.

899
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:18,479
- How does that make you feel?
- Like a stupid pet trick.

900
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:20,608
Which is all I am- a joke!

901
00:52:20,684 --> 00:52:23,915
I could be replaced by a cannonball.

902
00:52:23,987 --> 00:52:28,617
Oh, man. Delirium, crying', sobbing'.
They're running' out of oxygen!

- I'm almost there.

904
00:52:33,397 --> 00:52:36,366
I'm not even a good chimp.
I've never once said thank you to Houston.

905
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:39,891
- He's like a father to me.
- Oh, Ham.

906
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:44,100
All my life I've been living
in my famous grandpa's shadow.

907
00:52:44,174 --> 00:52:47,075
{Sighs}
How does that make you feel?

908
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:50,905
You know what it's like
to live in a shadow?

909
00:52:50,981 --> 00:52:54,473
It's cold.
I knew I could never become a hero...

910
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:58,043
so I became a clown.

- You know all that back there,
it was just the cloud talking. So-

918
00:53:23,313 --> 00:53:27,079
It's okay. Sometimes the conflict
between the superego and the id...

919
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,517
can cast a long shadow in the soul.

920
00:53:30,587 --> 00:53:33,078
I have no idea what you just said.

921
00:53:33,156 --> 00:53:36,250

987

I told you guys.
This whole thing was a sham.

- And we weren't even supposed to open the can.

We were never really flying it.
We were never really astronauts.

- I didn't want to be right.
