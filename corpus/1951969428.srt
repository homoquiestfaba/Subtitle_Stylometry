1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,969
- You ready?
- Ready's my middle name.

2
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:32,073
What do we got?
Gang of terrible rhinos?

3
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:34,669
Crocs? Rabid wolves? Let's do it!

4
00:00:34,747 --> 00:00:38,444
Be warned. This may be the toughest
challenge you've ever had to face.

5
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:41,679
Get ready to feel the thunder!

6
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,815
Introduction to kung fu class.

7
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:51,262
Can I use the Wuxi finger hold on 'em?

8
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,797
I'd try not to.

9
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:56,357
Remember, Po, each generation
teaches the next one.

10
00:00:56,435 --> 00:01:00,872
And so the art of kung fu lives on,
in you and now in these...

11
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:06,134
-...delightful children.
- What?

12
00:01:06,212 --> 00:01:07,736
- Good luck.
- Wait a second!

13
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:10,407
Master Shifu! Come on!

14
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:19,054
OK, if you could just take a seat.

15
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,387
Hello?

16
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:23,451
Hey, hey. Settle down now.

17
00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:25,827
OK.

18
00:01:28,434 --> 00:01:30,664
Get those cottontails on the floor!

19
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:34,729
- The Dragon Warrior!
- Yes, thank you.

20
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:37,002
Are we gonna learn
the cool kung fu moves?

21
00:01:37,076 --> 00:01:38,236
- Yes.
- Yeah!

22
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:40,711
Now we're really gonna start
kicking butt!

23
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,943
Now hold on. Kicking butt
is just a small part of kung fu.

24
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:45,916
It's awesome, but it's small.

25
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,581
"Kung fu" means excellence of self.

26
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:53,489
Being the best you can be.
That's what it's about, bunnies.

27
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:58,292
- I wanna learn tigress style.
- Aren't we going to fight?

28
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:01,128
- Yeah, like the Furious Five?
- Yeah!

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,862
The Furious Five?
They are cool, aren't they?

30
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:06,530
But it wasn't fighting
that made them amazing.

31
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:09,597
No. They each had to learn
the secrets of kung fu

32
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:11,438
before they became excellent.

33
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,637
- Secrets? What secrets?
- Tell us!

34
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:15,078
I shouldn't really say.

35
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:17,479
That's why it's a secret.
It's top secret.

36
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,486
Please? Tell us, come on. Please?

37
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:25,183
OK, but don't tell anyone
I told you, or I'll deny it.

38
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:28,522
I'll be like, "What? I didn't
tell 'em anything." All right?

39
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:36,292
Even when Master Mantis
was but a wee bug, he was fast.

40
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:37,358
Lightning fast!

41
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:40,030
- Whenever anybody needed some help...
- Help!

42
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:43,466
...he was there.

43
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:46,437
Get him!

44
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:51,549
He was the hero of the valley...

45
00:02:53,753 --> 00:02:56,221
...but he had one tiny problem.

46
00:02:56,288 --> 00:03:00,281
- Waiter, I'm starvin' over here!
- He was totally impatient.

47
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:01,621
What's taking so long?

48
00:03:01,694 --> 00:03:03,958
The world moved too slow for Mantis.

49
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:09,592
- He was too fast for the world.
- Give me that!

50
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:12,296
One day, it would
get him into trouble.

51
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,203
A gang of crocodiles
stole my village's supply of...

52
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:18,675
- Wood.
-...wool coats.

53
00:03:18,744 --> 00:03:20,974
And if we don't get them back, we'll...

54
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:22,411
Look unfashionable?

55
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:23,914
...freeze to death.

56
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:27,384
Just as I thought. And where
did these scaly savages run off to?

57
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:28,647
- They went...
- West!

58
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:30,518
- No, east!
- What are you...?

59
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:31,886
- Towards the...
- Hill!

60
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:32,946
No!

61
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:35,093
- The island of...
- Rhinos?

62
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:39,257
- Crocodile bandits!
- Crocodile bandits? East? Wool coats!

63
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:41,891
I knew it! I'll need a boat.

64
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,730
- You need to be very...
- Quick.

65
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:45,964
- Careful. And take...
- A packed lunch?

66
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:47,471
- This map.
- No maps!

67
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,838
- Mantis, they...
- Won't know what hit 'em.

68
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:53,845
But traps! They're famous
for setting traps.

69
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:12,059
A trap! Why didn't anyone warn me?

70
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,656
Well, if it isn't the
world-famous Mantis.

71
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:17,634
Guess you were so fast
you forgot to check for traps.

72
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:21,730
How 'bout you let me out and I'll
show you how fast I can make you cry.

73
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:25,265
Why don't we leave you in there
and see how fast you can grow old?

74
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:37,178
No matter how hard he tried,
Mantis could not escape.

75
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:40,783
No matter how hard I try,
I cannot escape.

76
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,159
He could do nothing but
sit and wait for something to happen.

77
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,132
And so he waited. And waited...

78
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,861
...and waited.

79
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:52,529
Until something mind-blowing happened.

80
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:56,507
For the first time, the world around
Mantis moved faster than he did.

81
00:04:56,575 --> 00:04:59,635
Forced to wait,
Mantis entered a trance-like,

82
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:01,680
totally awesome state of mind.

83
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:05,211
Mantis had found
the one thing he'd been missing.

84
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:07,776
Patience.

85
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:10,549
And a brilliant plan.

86
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:14,491
Hey, Mantis! Wake up, It's time to eat.

87
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:17,628
Hey, you guys?

88
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:21,928
- That's yucky.
- I think he's dead.

89
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:25,300
- Touch him. Poke him with something!
- Careful. Careful.

90
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:29,398
Mantis had to summon
every ounce of chi he could muster.

91
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:31,966
Just to keep from laughing.

92
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:34,478
The crocodiles totally fell
for his amazing

93
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:37,311
"staying still for a really long
time" technique.

94
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:41,580
Wait for it.

95
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,321
Mantis had finally found
the secret to excellence of self,

96
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:55,128
- the mind-blowing power of patience.
- Yeah

97
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:02,702
- No, no, no. Wait. You guys.
- I am Mantis!

98
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:04,436
- Come on. No. No.
- Wait for it.

99
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,843
It's the "staying still for
a really long time" technique.

100
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:10,438
You're missing the point.
Not about fighting.

101
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:12,211
Stop fighting! Hey!

102
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:15,345
Now, sit!

103
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:18,787
OK, now pay attention this time.

104
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:23,628
It is said that the Viper clan
descended from mighty dragons,

105
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:28,030
whose legendary flames were distilled
into the viper's powerful venom.

106
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:32,633
Great Master Viper was
the greatest of this fabled clan.

107
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:37,506
One touch of his ivory tips
could fell 15 gorilla warriors.

108
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:40,201
And a mid-sized crocodile.

109
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,639
Evil, itself, trembled before him,

110
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:49,620
before the awe-smacking awesomeness
of his poison fang technique.

111
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,557
And so it was with great joy that
the daughter of the great master

112
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:56,527
was born to carry on the tradition.

113
00:06:56,595 --> 00:07:01,089
Finally, a little warrior
to carry on my legacy.

114
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:06,971
As the tiny viper first smiled at her
father, the world itself shook.

115
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:11,135
That's right. No fangs.

116
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,235
No venom!

117
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:16,508
Years went by.

118
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:20,245
Viper's father was still the only one
who could protect the village.

119
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:24,413
From the bad dudes.

120
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:28,784
And little Viper still had no fangs.

121
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:32,024
- The great master was disconsolate.
- Can I help?

122
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,029
No, little one.
It is too dangerous for you.

123
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:42,932
So the little Viper did a little dance
to make her father smile.

124
00:07:44,143 --> 00:07:48,102
And it worked. Just a little bit.

125
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,807
I know what you're thinking.

126
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:52,510
- Where's the kickin' butt?
- Yeah!

127
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:56,179
Patience, oh, small ones. It begins...

128
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:57,347
...now!

129
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:02,119
OK, well not right now. Soon. Soon!

130
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:05,125
Moon festival time.

131
00:08:05,197 --> 00:08:07,131
And all that dancing for her sad dad

132
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,657
made Viper blossom into
the best ribbon dancer in the village.

133
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:14,570
But without fangs, she was
too afraid to go to the festival.

134
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:21,268
The great master was on his way
to the won ton booth when...

135
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:22,574
...a gorilla bandit!

136
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,878
Cower now, old snake. Your town will
soon tremble beneath my mighty fist.

137
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:33,982
Not if I defeat you now, with the
awe-inspiring awesomeness

138
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,822
of my poison fang technique!

139
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:38,761
Then bite me, oh fanged one!

140
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:42,700
For his poison fang was invincible!

141
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:48,297
But how?

142
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:52,534
My poison-proof armor
defies your fabled fangs!

143
00:08:53,512 --> 00:08:54,501
Father!

144
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:59,745
Viper? Viper!

145
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,320
Viper had no idea what she would do.

146
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:06,486
But one thing she did know...

147
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:08,753
No one beats up my daddy!

148
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:11,921
A little snake with pretty ribbons?

149
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:16,294
What? are you gonna dance for me?

150
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:21,271
If it'll make you happy.

151
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,329
Let's dance!

152
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,445
I don't have to bite you to bite!

153
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:36,282
Too bad your fists
aren't as fast as your mouth.

154
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:45,890
My deceptive dancing defies
your poison-proof armor.

155
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:51,693
The great master marveled
at this little snake with no venom

156
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,001
who had learned to dance
to make her father smile.

157
00:09:57,543 --> 00:09:59,340
And do she had.

158
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:04,846
That night, Viper found courage,

159
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:07,442
a power far more potent than venom.

160
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:12,316
What?

161
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:15,258
What's with the sad faces?
Viper's totally awesome.

162
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:19,127
Yeah. But she was so cool.
We're just bunnies.

163
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:21,325
We're not like Viper.

164
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,833
No, you're not.

165
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:27,668
That's just the point!
Crane wasn't cool, either.

166
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:30,869
Twenty years ago,
the best students from all of China

167
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:34,104
studied at the famed
Lee Da Kung Fu Academy.

168
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,810
And the best of the best was May Ling.

169
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:39,680
She was a total knockout.

170
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:44,786
Crane was there too.

171
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:47,223
- As the... janitor.
- Crane!

172
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,886
- New student tryouts are next week.
- Really?

173
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:52,396
Crane longed to be one of the students.

174
00:10:52,464 --> 00:10:55,695
So this place needs to be ready.

175
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,564
But he thought he was too skinny.

176
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,627
Crane, get sweeping!

177
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:06,308
The students at the academy
had it tough. But Crane had it tougher.

178
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:11,748
Crane! You're amazing.

179
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:16,086
- Me?
- You should try out for the school.

180
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:22,150
No, that's craziness talking.
No. No, no, no.

181
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:25,253
Well, you'll never know
unless you try.

182
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,027
If May Ling thought so,
maybe he should try.

183
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:33,003
So every night after work,
Crane trained for the try-outs.

184
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:46,312
The day of the try-outs came.

185
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:51,079
All you had to do to get into the
school was grab that little red flag.

186
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:52,647
It was simple.

187
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:55,588
Simple but impossible!

188
00:12:03,068 --> 00:12:05,298
Pathetic. Not one of you can do this?

189
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,136
- Wait. There is one.
- Hi, everybody.

190
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:10,367
Crane?

191
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,611
Yeah. With those skinny legs.

192
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:20,541
My skinny legs. First time
that's ever been mentioned.

193
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:27,154
Crane, since you're here,
why don't you get started cleaning.

194
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:29,352
I'm so sorry.

195
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:34,263
Don't worry about it.
It's totally fine.

196
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,927
Crane! Get going!
There are teeth everywhere.

197
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:40,368
It's fine. Really.

198
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:45,009
One word came to mind,
it would be "fine." It's fine.

199
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:47,644
Crane! Stop!

200
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:51,882
Now, step out slowly.

201
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:55,112
But Crane didn't move.

202
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,560
And then Crane felt something new.

203
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:08,621
Confidence!

204
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,534
He felt it from the bottom of his
skinny feet to the tip of his beak!

205
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:14,538
Even his hat was full of confidence!

206
00:13:34,393 --> 00:13:38,693
So, you guys think you're not cool?
You'd be lucky to be not as cool.

207
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:43,463
Wait, half as cool as...
how uncool Crane was.

208
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:44,729
You know what I mean?

209
00:13:47,806 --> 00:13:50,274
OK. All this training's
making me hungry.

210
00:13:50,342 --> 00:13:52,367
Let's break for lunch.

211
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:56,244
Wait! But you haven't
finished telling us all the secrets.

212
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:59,340
Haven't I? I think you'll find
that I have.

213
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:01,352
Actually, Po. You haven't.

214
00:14:02,354 --> 00:14:04,379
I haven't? One, two, three...

215
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:06,447
No, you're right, I totally haven't.

216
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:08,620
Next lesson.

217
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:11,992
It all started years ago
at the Bau Gu orphanage.

218
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:14,289
Children.

219
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:19,770
Every month, the children of Bau Gu
were given a chance to find a family!

220
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:23,897
It was a happy place.

221
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:25,943
Or so it seemed.

222
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,713
For the Bau Gu orphanage
had a terrible secret.

223
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,175
A monster!

224
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:39,282
A ferocious and powerful beast
that no one could tame!

225
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:42,656
One night, it escaped!

226
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,056
Behold!

227
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:53,502
The monster of Bau Gu
was none other than...

228
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:56,307
...Tigress.

229
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:58,569
I just wanna play.

230
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:02,636
She wasn't like the other
furry bunnies or cute little ducks.

231
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:04,147
Wait!

232
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:09,986
Poor Tigress had no idea
how strong she was.

233
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:13,718
Nobody will come here to adopt
a child because they're afraid of her.

234
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:17,455
She's a monster. A monster.

235
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:21,765
The orphanage needed some help.

236
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:24,998
Tigress?

237
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,732
I am Shifu. I am...

238
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:28,830
Afraid?

239
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:31,872
- No.
- Well, you should be.

240
00:15:31,943 --> 00:15:34,707
I am Tigress. Tigress the monster!

241
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,907
- A monster no one wants.
- You are not a monster.

242
00:15:38,984 --> 00:15:40,713
You're just a little girl.

243
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:45,745
Let us play?

244
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:51,255
You must learn
to control your strength.

245
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:53,263
And so the training began.

246
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:58,132
This game requires
discipline, precision,

247
00:15:58,203 --> 00:16:00,535
a still hand and a steady heart.

248
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:03,597
Focus. Again.

249
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:12,740
Tigress tried her best, but she still
couldn't control her temper.

250
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:14,707
Again.

251
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:18,552
And so the weeks turned into months.

252
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:22,415
Again.

253
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:26,790
Until one day...

254
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:42,873
...she had done it.

255
00:16:44,716 --> 00:16:46,308
Her training was complete.

256
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,515
Once again, the Bau Gu orphanage
was the happiest place in China.

257
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:55,492
But for Tigress, one test remained.

258
00:16:57,262 --> 00:16:58,729
Would she find a family?

259
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:05,568
Total bummer.

260
00:17:05,637 --> 00:17:08,834
Come, dear. There's always next time.

261
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:11,842
All the adults were
still afraid of her.

262
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:14,806
All but one.

263
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:18,975
- Shifu!
- Come. Let us go home.

264
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:41,063
- You think that's funny, do ya?
- Yeah

265
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:45,303
I guess it's easier to laugh at someone
than have someone laugh at you, right?

266
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:46,935
Let me tell you about Monkey.

267
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:50,103
Three words.

268
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:54,345
B-A-D, bad.

269
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,580
I guess that's one word, three letters.

270
00:17:57,422 --> 00:17:59,686
But not only bad as in "awesome", no.

271
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:01,316
Monkey was also bad,

272
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:04,885
as in, well, not very good.

273
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:12,863
Hey, over here.

274
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,964
Jerk!

275
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:22,847
the villagers had had enough.
They came up with a plan.

276
00:18:22,914 --> 00:18:24,506
Leave.

277
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:27,815
OK, it wasn't a great plan.

278
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:30,514
So instead of asking Monkey to leave,

279
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:33,182
they decided they would make him leave.

280
00:18:51,276 --> 00:18:54,143
No matter who the villagers sent...

281
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:56,112
...they were no match for Monkey.

282
00:18:56,181 --> 00:19:00,174
Monkey could, quite literally,
beat the pants off anyone.

283
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:05,281
Well, almost anyone.

284
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:09,188
Monkey, you must leave.

285
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:12,386
Sure, if you beat me, I will go.

286
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:15,160
If you don't,
then it is you that must leave.

287
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,723
Without your pants.

288
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,666
But Oogway wore no pants.

289
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:19,999
Well, we shall see.

290
00:19:37,455 --> 00:19:38,888
What are you gonna do now?

291
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:07,375
You saved me. Why?

292
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:12,921
Monkey, you have shown me great skills,

293
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:17,690
but I also sense in you great pain.

294
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:33,204
You win. I will leave.

295
00:20:35,046 --> 00:20:40,074
Stay. Use your skills for good,
young warrior.

296
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:44,815
Find the one thing
that you were denied so long ago.

297
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:46,914
My pants?

298
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:48,458
Compassion.

299
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:52,220
Thank you, master.

300
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:54,595
And so, Monkey learned
how to treat others

301
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,566
the way he wanted to be treated

302
00:20:56,634 --> 00:20:59,296
And now, he was indeed good,

303
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,428
really good.

304
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:09,169
But bad too, as in bad-tastically good!

305
00:21:10,114 --> 00:21:11,809
- Yeah!
- Without your pants!

306
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:16,083
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, easy! Easy!

307
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:19,455
- Shifu!
- Not so easy?

308
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:21,148
No, it's...

309
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:23,820
You see, teaching kung fu is an art

310
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:26,830
that takes years to master.

311
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:30,831
Do not be disappointed if you failed.

312
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,869
Tell me,
what do you know about kung fu?

313
00:21:36,774 --> 00:21:38,799
It's about fighting!

314
00:21:41,412 --> 00:21:43,676
But it's also about having patience.

315
00:21:44,415 --> 00:21:46,178
- And courage.
- And discipline.

316
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:48,048
And compassion.

317
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:51,447
It builds confidence.

318
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,992
You... carry on, Master Po.
I'm going to meditate.

319
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:05,133
All right, good job. Not bad
for your first day of training.

320
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:07,501
Wait, Po, what about you?

321
00:22:08,206 --> 00:22:09,673
- Me?
- Yeah!

322
00:22:09,741 --> 00:22:11,504
Tell us about your first day.

323
00:22:11,576 --> 00:22:14,477
Tell us! Come on, tell us!

324
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,888
It was totally awesome!

325
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,017
Cool.
