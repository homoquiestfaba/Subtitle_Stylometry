1
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,100
Have you ever wondered
how Nature gets its glow?

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,100
Who gives it light and colour as the
seasons come and go?

3
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,700
Who helps all creatures great and small...

4
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,400
to walk, to swim, to fly?

5
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,900
Who crafts such tiny details?

6
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,400
You might see them if you try...

7
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,300
For it's all the work of fairies, but
they stay well out of sight...

8
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,500
The first time that a baby laughs, a fairy's
life takes flight...

9
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,400
When the moon comes up to shine her face...

10
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,500
and the birds are fast asleep...

11
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,500
And the mountains hang from every post,

12
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,000
The fairies leave their keep!

13
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,000
They join their hands and sing their songs,

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,400
The mariners all can hear!

15
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,300
In the springtime when the earth is new,

16
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,800
The fairies might draw near!

17
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,300
The fairies might draw near!

18
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,800
TINKER BELL

19
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,900
- Hello!
- Hello?

20
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,300
Queen Clarion!

21
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,500
Born of laughter, clothed in cheer,
Happiness has brought you here!

22
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Welcome to Pixie Hollow!

23
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,800
- I trust you found your way alright!
- I... think so.

24
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,200
Now let's see about those wings!

25
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,700
They will help you find your talent, little one.

26
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,000
- But how will I know which one is...
- You'll know!

27
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,900
I've never seen one glow that much before!
Even for Vidia!

28
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,000
You know, I do believe you're right! The little
lazy tod might be a very rare talent indeed!

29
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,400
Come forward, Tinker fairies and welcome...

30
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,500
the newest member of your talent kin... Tinker Bell!

31
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,000
- I'm glad we had a bath today!
- Coming through!

32
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,300
Make way for Tinkers! Hy-dy high,
hy-dy how, Miss Bell!

33
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,900
- I'm Clank!
- Clank, say it, don't spray it!

34
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,900
Amphilious T. Cattletree esquire, at your service!

35
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:08,000
- Pleased to make your acquaintance!
- Oh, boo... He's Boble, I'm Clank!

36
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,500
Clank, Boble!

37
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,000
We're pleased as a pair of perfectly polished
pots you're here!

38
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,800
Aaa... me, too!

39
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,800
Come on, miss Bell, there's so much to show you!

40
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,800
You've arrived at a most wonderous and
glorious time!

41
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,900
- Really? Why?
- It's almost time for the changing of the seasons!

42
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,200
You see, here in Pixie Hollow, there are
different realms for every time of year!

43
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,700
There's one up ahead!

44
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,700
Winter Woods, it's always cold here!

45
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,800
Look there! Snowflake and Frost fairies
returning home...

46
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,200
for some well-deserved rest!

47
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,900
We've just finished bringing winter to the world.

48
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,600
It's the up season for Autumn fairies, too.

49
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Always practicing their perfect shade of amber, hey.

50
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,900
And the fairies of Summer still have plenty
of time to get ready!

51
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,700
Not as much as the Autumn fairies, of course, because...

52
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:19,100
Yes, Clank, because right now fairies of every
talent are preparing for my favorite season,

53
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Springtime.

54
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,300
Get low, get low, little sproutings and dig.

55
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,200
- Hello, there!
- Come on, miss Bell, you've got to see where we live.

56
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,000
Welcome to Tinker's Nuke!

57
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,900
Come on, there's so much to show you.

58
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Oh, cute.

59
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Just taking some supplies down to the workshop.

60
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,300
Let her go.

61
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,500
Watch out for falling maple seeds!

62
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,400
Wow.

63
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,000
- And over here is where most of us live!
- There's your house, Tinker Bell!

64
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,500
- Ah, it's mine?
- Sure is.

65
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,400
We were hoping that your arrival would be
of one of us, so we got the place all ready.

66
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,500
- We rounded up some work clothes!
- We did not know your size!

67
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,700
- Our apologies.
- They might be too big!

68
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,000
- That's only because you're so tiny.
- Please come on down to the workshop when you're ready.

69
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,400
- Fairy Mary will want to meet you.
- Good bye!

70
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,700
- Stop!
- What?

71
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,500
Clank, I told you to take a seven.

72
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,800
- You said five!
- I said a seven!

73
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,800
- Pretty!
- So...

74
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Pretty.

75
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,400
- Who's that then?
- It's Tinker Bell, you snail brain!

76
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,700
Wow, everyone seems so busy!

77
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,000
Spring won't spring itself.

78
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,800
Indeed my bellowing buddy and we Tinkers are
a big part of it.

79
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,700
Allow us to elucidate, miss Bell!

80
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,300
- We fiddle and fix.
- We craft and create.

81
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,300
- We carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paints.

82
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,800
- With saddles and saches.
- For birdies, you see.

83
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,000
- We make baskets and bushels.
- To carry the seeds.

84
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,600
- We're preparing for spring.
- We do all these and more.

85
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,900
- Yes!
- Because being a Tinker is never a bore.

86
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:31,300
- That was great.
- So you see, miss Bell, we help fairies
of every talent with our creations.

87
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Unfortunately, all those fairies are out of luck this year!

88
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,000
Unless we can actually deliver these things to them!

89
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,400
- The wagon repairs are finished, I trust?
- Yes, Fairy Mary.

90
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,100
- They're top shaped.
- No wheel is missing whatsoever.

91
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,200
Then let's see it!

92
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,700
- Define seeing actually!
- With your eyes!

93
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,000
- You have to meet Tinker Bell!
- What?

94
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,900
- Who?
- She's new, Fairy Mary.

95
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,200
- Nice to meet you!
- Oh, rapture! A new charge on whom we can
lavish all our...

96
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,900
tinkering wisdom and expertise!

97
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,400
Let me see those hands! Oh, so dainty!

98
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,000
Don't worry, dear! We'll build up those
Tinker muscles in no time!

99
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,600
- Ok!
- Now, boys, the deliveries!

100
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,000
We're on it! As a matter of fact, we're
heading out right this second!

101
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,300
- But we've only got one wheel.
- What was that?

102
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,200
- Nothing really, Clank was just asking...
- If...

103
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,400
- I can go as well.
- Yes!

104
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,400
- I wondered that.
- That's exactly what he was saying!

105
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,400
Very well, get on with it, then!

106
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,300
Slow down, Cheese. I can't keep up!

107
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,800
- The mouse's name is Cheese?
- It must be! He always comes when we yell it!

108
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,000
Sprinting thistles!

109
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,100
Aaa!

110
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,200
Easy! Easy, boy!

111
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,700
It's alright, Fawn's got you!

112
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Easy, easy girl, it's alright, Silvermist's got you!

113
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,800
- Oh, you alright, sugar cake?
- Be careful, Rosetta, she may faint!

114
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,700
- Elevate her legs!
- No, wait, I mean her head.

115
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,700
Wait, wait, if she's red, raise the head,
if she's pale, raise the tail.

116
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,900
- Does she look pale or red?
- She looks squished!

117
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,000
- Sorry.
- Here, let me, rain drop! So...

118
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,400
what happened to you, anyway?

119
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,500
- Well...
- It was sprinting thistles!

120
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Those weeds are an absolute mess! Always trapping
things, poking people in the petunia!

121
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,900
Gather around, ladies!

122
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,600
We've brought some selections from the new
spring line of Tinkers' specialities!

123
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,900
- Alright!
- Show us!

124
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,900
- Your rainbow tubes, Iridessa!
- Finally!

125
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,300
Silvermist, could you help me?

126
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,000
- Wow, what are you going to do with that?
- I'm gonna take it to the Mainland.

127
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,800
- What's the Mainland?
- It's where we are going to change winter to spring.

128
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,800
The seasons change all the time there.

129
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,500
I'll get to apply my artistic sensibilities.

130
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,400
And I'll have breakfast ready for all the
little fuzzies coming out of hibernation.

131
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,600
We just follow the second star...

132
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,900
We ride the breeze, we follow the waves...

133
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
- All the way across the sea.
- Then, there it is.

134
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,800
Wow! The Mainland sounds flitterific!

135
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,300
Yes, the glamorous lives of the Nature talent fairies!

136
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,700
- We'd love to stay and chat...
- But we Tinkers have real work to do!

137
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,500
We know. Don't we like that!

138
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,300
- Nice to meet you all.
- You, too! Bye! Later!

139
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,000
Right, here we are... a pretty
large order of pollen pots for...

140
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,400
- The last thing is...
- Is it ok if I just catch up with you later?

141
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,300
- I suppose.
- Can you find your way back?

142
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,100
Yeah, yeah, sure I can.

143
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,500
- Alright then.
- Just be careful!

144
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Hi, there... sorry...

145
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,800
Vidia, right?

146
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,800
We didn't officially meet. I'm Tinker Bell.

147
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,100
- Oh, yes, the new girl.
- That's right.

148
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,700
- So, what's your talent?
- What do you think it is?

149
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,800
You're a poleniser?

150
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Polenator? Polen-picker? Polenflucker?

151
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,200
I am a fast flying fairy. A true rare talent.

152
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,000
And this is but a small part of what I do.

153
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,400
I make breezes in the summer. I blow down leaves
in the fall. My winds even brought you here, dear.

154
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,600
Fairies of every talent depend on me.

155
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,300
- Hey, that's just like what I do.
- Excuse me?

156
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,800
I mean Tinkers help fairies of every talent, too, so...

157
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,200
We're kind of the same, you know?

158
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Sweetie, I make forces of Nature.

159
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,200
You make pots and kettles.

160
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,500
I work up in the sky and you work down in a ditch.

161
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,300
- Hey!
- Don't get me wrong, sunshine!

162
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,000
Being a tinker is really swell and all,
but I wouldn't go...

163
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,200
around bragging about your talent! It's
not like spring depends on you!

164
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,900
Of course it does! And when I go to the Mainland,
I'll prove just how important we are!

165
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,800
- When who goes to the Mainland?
- Me, of course!

166
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,500
- For spring!
- Oh, of course!

167
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,400
- You'll prove it, huh?
- Yes, I will..

168
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,700
Well, I for one, am looking forward to that.

169
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,000
Excuse me.

170
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,700
No, excuse me.

171
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,500
Mine is a rare talent!

172
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,700
A!

173
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,700
Don't tell me Tinkers don't matter.

174
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,500
I'll show her what rare talent really is when I'll...

175
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,900
- Hey, Tink. What you got there?
- Oh, hi.

176
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,500
- I don't know, I just found them.
- Lost things.

177
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,000
Uuu, lost things!

178
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,500
Hey, stuff gets lost and washes up on
Neverland from day to day.

179
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,400
- You know, from the Mainland.
- These come from the Mainland?

180
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,400
That place sounds more fascinating all the time.

181
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,300
Fairy potions, checked! Polen pots, checked!

182
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Lost things, checked!

183
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,000
Lost things? Why are you fiddling with that junk?

184
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,800
They were just so... unusual!

185
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,600
You should not be wasting your time with that rubbish.

186
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,700
And I won't have it cluttering up my workshop.

187
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,400
And as for you two... No more
dilly-dallying around!

188
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,500
And don't forget about the queen's
review tonight. Goodness!

189
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,300
There's still so much to be done! Thank you!

190
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,200
Sorry about your trinkets, miss Bell.

191
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,400
Well, we best be getting ready for the review, anyway.

192
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,200
- What is the queen's review?
- You see, the queen...

193
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,600
is going to review all the preparations for spring.

194
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,800
- It is a good time for us Tinkers to show what we can do, hey?
- Indeed!

195
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,300
- Really?
- Like me, I can be a wheel!

196
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,200
Perfect.

197
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,500
That's my chance.

198
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:07,000
Ok, everybody, turn! Ready for the phase code over here!

199
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,200
A, splendid, splendid.

200
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,800
There's plenty of time before the queen arrives.

201
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,400
- A! It's the queen!
- What? She's here? Now?

202
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,800
Play, Music fairies.

203
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,600
Play.

204
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,300
Queen Clarion, your illustriousness,
as minister pf spring.

205
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,800
I welcome you to Springtime Square.

206
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,300
- What? No fireworks, minister?
- A, well, that could be arranged!

207
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,500
- Light fairies, light fairies.
- I'm teasing you.

208
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,000
You always make such a fuss and everything
turns out wonderfully.

209
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,000
Well, I think that you'll find that
we have things well in hand.

210
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,500
The ever-blossom blooms will be ready to
bring spring to the Mainland.

211
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,700
Music to my ears.

212
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,900
I know you all put in months of practice
and preparation.

213
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,800
But keep up the good work these last few days
because just as fairies...

214
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,300
Queen Clarion! Queen Clarion!

215
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,900
Did I miss anything?

216
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,500
- No, no, no.
- Good.

217
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,900
It's alright.

218
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,700
I came up with some fantastic things for
Tinkers to use when we go to the Mainland.

219
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,200
Let me show you.

220
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,500
First, baby chipmunks can't eat the whole
nut, right?

221
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,400
Their little teeth can't chew big bites.

222
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,000
So, you just crank back this lever and its...

223
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,000
Ups...

224
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,500
It's kind of a work in progress!

225
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Yes, yes, yes, very clever.

226
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,900
Oh, and I made this, too. It's a flower-sprayer.

227
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
- Tinker Bell, I...
- Allow me to demonstrate!

228
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,700
Sorry!!!

229
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,600
- But, but, wait till you see this last one!
- Tinker Bell!

230
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,500
Sweetheart, has no one explained?

231
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,300
Explain what?

232
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,100
- Tinker fairies don't go to the Mainland, dear.
- What?

233
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,200
All of those things are done by the Nature talent fairies!

234
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,900
Your work is here, in Pixie Hollow!

235
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,400
- But... but I thought that...
- I'm sorry, Tinker Bell!

236
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Ok, no, no, that's good!

237
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,700
I mean I couldn't make it, anyway, so...

238
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,800
Good, this actually works out good.

239
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,800
I mean well, so I...

240
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,300
I'm just gonna... yeah.

241
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,000
Back so soon?

242
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,800
- You didn't go?
- Goodness, no.

243
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,000
Far too much work to do down here!

244
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,900
Vidia was right.

245
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,900
- Being a Tinker stinks!
- Excuse me?

246
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,000
It's just that... why don't we get
to go to the Mainland?

247
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,300
Oh, the Mainland?

248
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,200
Who gives a pile of pebbles about the Mainland?

249
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,200
But Fairy Mary, the other fairies get to go.

250
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,300
Now, Tinker Bell, are you a garden fairy?

251
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,500
- Well, no.
- Are you a light fairy?

252
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,400
- No.
- Animal fairy?

253
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,800
- Water fairy perhaps?
- No and no.

254
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,800
No, you're not. You are a Tinker.
It's who you are.

255
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,500
Be proud of it.

256
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,200
The day you can magically make the flowers grow,

257
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,300
or capture the rays of the sun, then you can go.

258
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,300
Until then your work is here.

259
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,600
Good idea, Fairy Mary.

260
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,800
- Here you go, Silvermist.
- Thank you, Terrence.

261
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,800
- Oh, I hope Tinker Bell is ok.
- I know that, poor little sapling.

262
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,100
She looked pretty wilted yesterday.

263
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,000
- I wouldn't blame her is she stayed in bed all day.
- Good morning, girls!

264
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,700
- Tinker Bell!
- Guess what? I've decided I'm ...

265
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,800
- ...not gonna be a tinker fairy anymore!
- What?

266
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,300
Well, I was thinking. Why do I have to be a tinker?
Because some silly hammer glowed?

267
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,700
I mean who's to say it wasn't some big mistake?

268
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,300
- Maybe I can just switch my talent!
- Switch your talent? I don't know, Tinker Bell!

269
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,400
If you could teach me your talents, any of you,
maybe I...

270
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,100
could show the queen I can work with nature, too.

271
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,700
And then she would let me go to the
Mainland for spring!

272
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,100
Tinker Bell, that's just not how it works.

273
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,000
- Well, maybe she could.
- She's right, she could!

274
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,500
- Well, I've never heard of someone switching talents before.
- She's right, me neither!

275
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,800
Look, you all do things that are beautiful and...

276
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,700
... magical and important...

277
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:32,900
... but me, well, there's got to be more to my
life than just pots and kettles...

278
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,900
All I'm asking is that you give me a chance!

279
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,800
I'll help you, Tinker Bell!

280
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,200
- Thank you so...
- Me, too!

281
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,000
- Me, too. Could be fun!
- Well, first time for everything, I guess!

282
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,700
- What harm could come from trying?
- Well...

283
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,000
I still think this is a bad idea.

284
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,400
So, for your first day of Water fairy
training, I could...

285
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,400
Show you how to make dripples in the pond.

286
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,900
- Ok.
- Or... teach you how to talk to the babbling brook!

287
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,000
- That sounds fun, too.
- Wait, wait, I got it! I got it!

288
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,900
Dew-drops on spider-webs!

289
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,800
- Come on, I'll show you how to do it!
- Good luck, Tink!

290
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,200
- You can do it!
- Aaa...

291
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,800
Go get them!

292
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,700
Just cup your hands like this, reach
into the water,

293
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,400
and ok, you heard of the dew-drop?

294
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,500
This is a dow-drop. That's water-fairy humour.

295
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,500
- It's good.
- Come on!

296
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,900
Ok, Tink, now this next part could be
a little tricky!

297
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,600
It takes a very steady, delicate hand to...

298
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,700
- Aaa... Where is your dew-drop?
- Oh!

299
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,900
Forgot my dew-drop.

300
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,900
Hey, I did ... it.

301
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,900
Shake that one off! Shake it off!

302
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,300
You can do this!

303
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,300
That's it!

304
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,400
- That's it, Tink, you're doing it!
- Good...

305
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,700
- Uuu...
- Now, Tink... try to... oh, no, sweetie...

306
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,500
- You need to... maybe if you...
- Well, you have to admire her persistence.

307
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,300
- Tinker Bell!
- You know, sometimes hammers glow...

308
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,300
... for a reason.

309
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,500
You know, you always struck me like
a light fairy kind of girl.

310
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,700
- Have you seen Tink?
- No, thank you, not thirsty.

311
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,600
No, no, not drink, Tink!

312
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,700
- Pink? Well, I'm purple myself!
- Tink! Have you seen Tink?

313
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,500
What? I do not stink! Maybe it's you, hey!

314
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,400
Hey, have you seen Tink?

315
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,200
Oh, Fairy Mary is gonna be crossed.

316
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,200
We'd better take some of these off
miss Bell's plate.

317
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,200
- Right.
- No, no, no, wait!

318
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,500
Was it a... Would you two stop mocking about?

319
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,400
- Clunk here...
- You see, Bobble...

320
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,300
I see Tinker Bell has got her work done mysteriously!

321
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,200
- Where is she, anyway?
- Oh, you see, she's...

322
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,400
She went with Cheese to...

323
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,200
No, no, Clunk means... she went to get cheese.

324
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,000
- The food for Cheese the mouse!
- yes, the food for Cheese!

325
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,200
- Because the mouse... he was... whining!
- Like a baby!

326
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,900
A wee-baby!

327
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:37,600
Ok, what can I teach you that's gonna
do the least amount of damage?

328
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh, I know!

329
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,500
Follow me, Tinker Bell!

330
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,300
Wow, the last light of day!

331
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,300
It's the richest kind of all! Wait for it, wait...

332
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,300
... for it... Oh, ok and now!

333
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,900
Oh, wow!

334
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,500
Oh!

335
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,900
- It's incredible!
- Now, for the fun part!

336
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,400
- Hum, do you think it's heavy?
- No, it's light!

337
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,000
Ha-ha!

338
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,300
Ok, ok!

339
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,000
- Stay!
- Here, Tink, let me!

340
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,500
- No, I almost got it!
- I could just get it started!

341
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,400
This is impossible!

342
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,900
Look out!

343
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,300
Oh, no! Ooo!!!

344
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Aaa!

345
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,800
I wonder how it's going!

346
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,300
Fly, Tink, fly!

347
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,800
- We'll save you, Tink!
- Cover your... tushy!

348
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,400
To hold flower paint!

349
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,400
- Preparing for spring!
- We do all these and more!

350
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,600
- Yes!
- Because being a Tinker is never a bore!

351
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,300
- Tinker Bell, I'd like a word with you!
- Fairy Mary!

352
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,600
You see, I was on my deliveries and...
it's actually kind of a...

353
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,300
Save it! I know what you've been up to, missy!

354
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,800
And I had such high hopes for you!

355
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:37,000
- You would do well to listen to her!
- Why? So I can do this for the rest of my life?!

356
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,800
I don't wanna be just a stupid tinker!

357
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,900
No, no! Not that you guys are...

358
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I didn't mean that... guys, I wasn't...

359
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,800
I have to go.

360
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,200
Now flap them! Flap them, that's it!

361
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,300
Have fun!

362
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,700
Hey, Tink! You're ready?

363
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,900
A little nervous... actually!

364
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,000
Don't be silly, come on, you'll be fine!

365
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,800
We're teaching baby-birds how to fly.

366
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,800
First, you have to get their attention.
Smile and establish trust.

367
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,300
See? Ok. Open your wings, honey
and flap them.

368
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,800
Up and down, up and down, that's the way!

369
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,300
Faster! Faster, that's right! Yes, you're doing it!

370
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,500
Ok, now, come out this way a little bit.
You're ok, you're ok.

371
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,000
You got it! Keep flaping! Keep flaping!

372
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:01,200
Hey, why don't you help that last little guy?

373
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:08,400
Ok, ok, just smile and establish trust.

374
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,400
Hi there! Hey, little fella...

375
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,800
You wanna do some flap-flap today?

376
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Oh, sure you do... all you do is you just...

377
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,200
You just flap your wings like this!

378
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,800
No, no, no, no, no! None of that, come on!

379
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,400
All we got to do is... Awwwww...

380
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Look, I'm gonna level with you, ok?

381
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,300
I kind of bummed down on the whole
water and light fairy things.

382
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,900
I'm starting to run out of options here.

383
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,500
If you could see fit to flap your little wings
and take flight for a few measly seconds,

384
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,700
I might be able to go to the mainland and
bring happiness to the world!

385
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:54,700
What do you say? Wrong answer!

386
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,300
Oh, if I get stuck making acorn
kettles for the rest of my life,

387
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,800
- I'm holding you personally responsible.
- Hey, hey! Look at this!

388
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,500
Stop squirming! Just...

389
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,400
Hey!

390
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,300
Ok, ok, I'm letting go! I am letting go!

391
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,900
This is not working!

392
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:27,400
Hey, maybe that guy can help. He's
a really good flyer.

393
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,000
Hey, up there!

394
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,800
Hawk!

395
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,200
Quick, hide!

396
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,000
A hawk! Tinker Bell is in trouble!

397
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,900
- Vidia!
- Hey, this is my hiding spot!

398
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,300
But it's all yours now.

399
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,400
Aaa!

400
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,200
Aaa!

401
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,500
Get him!

402
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,500
- Are you ok, Vidia?
- Aaa...

403
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,900
- Let me help you!
- Don't touch me!

404
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,100
- I'm fine!
- I was only trying to help!

405
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,700
Stop trying!

406
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,700
- Tinker Bell...
- Ha! I can't hold water,

407
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,200
I can't hold light, birds hate me...

408
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,000
- I'm just so... so useless.
- Tink!

409
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,800
Great! I failed for the third time in a row.

410
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,300
At this rate, I should get to the Mainland right about...

411
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,100
... never!

412
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,800
Sil...

413
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,400
Beautiful!

414
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,800
- You fixed it!
- Wow!

415
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,000
- Amazing!
- What are you guys doing here?

416
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,500
It might be sparkliest thing I've ever seen!

417
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,800
- And I've seen a lot of sparkly things!
- It's a really pretty thingy!

418
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,800
- What is it?
- I don't know. I just found it!

419
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,000
Tinker Bell, don't you ever realize what
you're doing? You're tinkering!

420
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:32,600
Creating those gadgets, figuring things out,
fixing stuff, like this!

421
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,900
That's what tinkering is, sweetie.

422
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,000
Don't you like doing this? Isn't it what
you really love?

423
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,800
- Yeah, who cares about going to the Mainland, anyway?
- Well, I do, remember?

424
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,800
I wanna see where these things come from!

425
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,900
Why are you saying this, so you're
just giving up on me?

426
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,400
I mean aren't you going to teach me to be
a garden fairy anymore?

427
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,600
Oh, sweetie, I think this is your talent!

428
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,900
Tink, we just want you to be happy.

429
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,700
If you really want me to be happy, you'd help me
get to the Mainland, like you promissed!

430
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,500
Please, Tinker Bell, just... just think about it!

431
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,500
Will you teach me how to be a fast-flying fairy?

432
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,700
Please! I know I could do it!

433
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,200
With your help, I could be flying as
fast as you in no time!

434
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,000
Vidia, you're my last hope! All my friends
have given up on me!

435
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:06,300
Rosetta won't even try to teach me to
be a garden fairy now!

436
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,900
I bet I could at least paint some flowers or...

437
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,700
... plant some sproutings! There must
be something I could do!

438
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,000
Or if you really want to be a garden fairy...

439
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,900
Capture the sprinting thistles! Aaa! Well!

440
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,100
Ok, I can do this! Yeah!

441
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,700
Ok! Ready, Cheese?

442
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,200
Oh, come on! They're just wheeds!

443
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:54,500
Besides, they're only 7 or 8 at the
most, right?

444
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,800
We can do this! I know we can do this!

445
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,900
What do you say?

446
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,000
This ought to be good!

447
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Hey!

448
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,800
Come on, you! Come on, just...

449
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:51,400
This way! Ah, it's working! It's working!

450
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,000
Ha!

451
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,900
Come on!

452
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,500
Aaa!

453
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,300
Wait, wait, wait! Come back!

454
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,500
Come back!

455
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,900
Ah, these things just won't listen!

456
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,100
Come on, Cheese, go, go, go!

457
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,700
Hey, definitely more than eight!

458
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:32,700
Please, file and get to the ground in an
orderly manner!

459
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,500
Wait!

460
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,300
Oh, no! Come on!

461
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,700
Sorry, sorry! Excuse me!

462
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,900
I'm so sorry!

463
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,800
This is the last patch!

464
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,600
Look out!

465
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,400
Sorry! Sorry!

466
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,200
- Oh, no!
- Tink, what happened?

467
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,800
- Tinker Bell, what did you think you
were doing?
- I was just...

468
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,800
I was just trying to... I thought that if I
could capture the thistles, then...

469
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,200
There isn't a garden fairy alive who can
control those wheeds!

470
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,000
- What were you trying to prove?
- I...

471
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,800
She's right, Tink, this is all gone too far!

472
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,900
By the second star!

473
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,400
All the preparations for spring! How did this...

474
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,500
Queen Clarion! It...

475
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,500
It was me! I did it!

476
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:55,300
- It's all my fault!
- Tinker Bell!

477
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,200
I'm sorry!

478
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,400
I don't think we can fix this in time!
We're going to have to cancel spring!

479
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,700
Or postpone it, to the very least!

480
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,100
What? And put my fairies back to work?
But we can't, we can't do that! If...

481
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,700
The snow isn't melted, the...

482
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,900
And then in autumn, there will be
nothing to harvest!

483
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,800
Spring must happen on time, or the
balance of nature will be undone!

484
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,600
- There must be something we can do!
- Certainly this has happened before!

485
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,200
- It has, did you ever hear of the Ice Age?
- Settle down! All of you!

486
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,300
Fairy Mary, is it even possible to redo
everything in such a short time?

487
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,800
- No!
- Oh, no!

488
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:58,500
We were so close, now it's all gone!

489
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,200
Who's going to paint our leaves now?

490
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,000
- Plants will never grow!
- No more hills covered in daffodils?

491
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
- You're ok, Tink?
- Oh, yeah!

492
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah, I'm fine!

493
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,900
I just came hoping to get a quick refill!

494
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
- I'm going away for a while.
- Oh, how long are you going to be gone?

495
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:55,000
- Well, actually, forever!
- Forever? Well...

496
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,900
In that case...

497
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,700
A double scoop!

498
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,800
- Forever is a pretty long time, so I hear!
- Thanks, Terrence!

499
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,500
- You know my name?
- Well, sure. Why wouldn't I?

500
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,000
I don't know. I'm just a dust keeper guy.

501
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,000
I'm not exactly seen as the most
important fairy in Pixie Hollow!

502
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:23,600
Terrence, what are you talking about? You're
probably the most important one there is!

503
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,200
Without you, no one would have any magic.

504
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,800
Your talent makes who you are! You
should be proud of it!

505
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,700
I am!

506
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,900
I... I... I'd better get going!

507
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,700
Oh, oh, hey, Cheese!

508
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:27,700
Be proud of your talent! What talent?

509
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,900
I couldn't even get these silly things to work!

510
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,800
Aaa... Lost things!

511
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:02,900
That's it!

512
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,200
Attention, everyone!

513
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,200
I'm afraid I have distressing news!

514
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:21,300
There is no way spring can come on time!

515
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,700
Months of work was lost.

516
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,500
And it will take us months to restore it all.

517
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,550
So when the ever blossom opens tomorrow,
I'm afraid we will not be going to the...

518
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,400
Mainland for spring.

519
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,500
Wait! I know how we can fix everything!

520
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,200
Tinker Bell?

521
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,800
- Tinker Bell, I don't think this is...
- Just hear me out.

522
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,000
Please!... You!

523
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,900
How long does it take you to paint a ladybug?

524
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,800
I don't know. Ten, 15 minutes, I guess!

525
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,700
See? We can build more!

526
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,800
I can show you how! Making paints, gathering
seeds, we can do it all in no time!

527
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:31,400
- We have to at least try!
- Wait! Are we going to listen to her?

528
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:35,000
She's the reason we're in this mess in
the first place!

529
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,300
- But I can fix...
- Tinker Bell is going to save us,

530
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,900
with her dopey little do-hickies!

531
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:47,300
What is your problem, Vidia? Why do
you think you're so much better than me?

532
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,000
I am better than you, sweetie, I didn't
ruin spring!

533
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:55,000
At least now I'm trying to help! Have you
ever helped anyone besides yourself?

534
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:59,500
Well, I tried to help you! Maybe I should have
told you to...

535
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,400
... capture the hawk instead of the thistles!

536
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,800
Perhaps Tinker Bell was not the only one responsible!

537
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:17,500
It seems to me that your fast-flying talent is well
suited to chasing down...

538
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,400
... each and everyone of the thistles!

539
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,300
- Me?
- Yes. And I expect them all...

540
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,600
... to be returned to Neddlepoint Meadow as
soon as possible!

541
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,400
But... but that could take forever!

542
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,200
Then I suggest you get started!

543
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,800
Now, Tinker Bell, are you sure you can do this?

544
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,400
Yes!

545
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,400
Because I'm a Tinker! It's who I am!

546
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:02,700
And Tinkers fix things!

547
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,800
But I can't do it alone!

548
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,900
Command us, miss Bell!

549
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:13,800
- I'll help!
- Show us how, Tink!

550
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,900
- I'll help you!
- Me, too!

551
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:20,000
Ok. Gather all the twigs you can, all different sizes!
And tree-saps, we need lots of that!

552
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:26,300
But most importantly, we need to find lost things!

553
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:39,500
- Ok, what have you got?
- How about this?

554
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,400
- Will this do?
- Can you use this fuzzy thing, miss Bell?

555
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,000
- Oh, yeah!
- It's not fuzzy!

556
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,400
- Yes, it is!
- No, it isn't!

557
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,900
Twig! Hammer! Magnification, please!

558
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,900
Thank you.

559
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,500
And that's how you do it.

560
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,200
Now what do you suppose that...

561
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,700
- Aaa!
- Aaa!

562
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:13,000
- Oh...
- Clunk!

563
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,500
You smell funny!

564
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,700
- Oh!
- Uuu!

565
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,900
- I saw it first!
- I bumped into it!

566
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,200
Let's tie this off here... so you just
squeeze this.

567
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,500
- Then let it go and...
- Aaa!

568
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,100
See? Simple!

569
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:42,000
Now, just put the berries in and we'll
have plenty of paint in no time!

570
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,600
We did it!

571
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,200
Six, seven and eight.

572
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,800
Ohhh!

573
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,800
You did it, Tinker Bell! You saved spring!

574
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,100
- We all did it.
- Queen Clarion!

575
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,200
- Can't Tink come with us to the Mainland?
- Yeah!

576
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,600
- She's done so much for everyone!
- No, no, you guys, really!

577
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,900
- I don't need to go.
- Buttercup, it's what you wanted.

578
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,500
It's ok! My work is here and I still have so
much to do.

579
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,400
- Not here, you don't!
- But I...

580
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,100
- No but!
- Surprise, miss Bell!

581
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,500
We found your tiny dancer!

582
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,800
Actually, I ran across this myself many
seasons ago!

583
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:00,300
I didn't have a clue what it was or how
to fix it.

584
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:04,800
You did, Tinker Bell! You are quite a rare
talent indeed!

585
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:09,800
And I imagine there's a little girl out
there who's missing this.

586
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,300
What do you mean? How...?

587
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:19,500
I think that perhaps a certain Tinker fairy
might have a job to do afterall.

588
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,100
- On the Mainland!
- You mean I...

589
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:29,200
- I knew you can...
- Oh, Tink!

590
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,800
- Oh, we can help, miss Bell!
- I'm strong!

591
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,900
- Come on, we got to go right now!
- Thank you, your highness!

592
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,900
- But how will I find who it belongs to?
- You'll know!

593
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,400
Now, go!

594
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,500
Thank you!

595
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Tink! Hey! Something to help you on the Mainland!

596
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,900
Oh, Terrence, that's so sweet!

597
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,800
- Good luck, Tink!
- To the air, fairies!

598
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:14,000
To the air! The Mainland awaits.

599
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,400
Come away with me now, to the sky.

600
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,400
Up on the hills and the sea,

601
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,800
Far beyond, where memories lie,

602
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:31,300
To a place where I'm free to believe!

603
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:39,400
Oh, can you hear them all,

604
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,800
No matter what Polly may do?

605
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:47,500
Let the stars fill us all,

606
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:52,800
And the moon craddle the soul,
So to yourself be true!

607
01:05:55,300 --> 01:06:02,500
The blanket of snow is so cold,

608
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:08,000
Each flower waits for the sun
And the blissful tears of the rain!

609
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,300
It's a promise for everyone!

610
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:17,300
Then come away with me, friends,

611
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,800
No matter where you come from!

612
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:26,200
With a light in our hearts,
We will never part,

613
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,400
- No matter how far we go!
- Fairies to the South! To the East and West!

614
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:48,300
Deep in the forrest we go!

615
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,800
- Wake up, sleepy heads!
- Creatures are all fast asleep!

616
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:57,000
With a kiss and a grim we will wake

617
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:02,500
And always in safety we'll keep.

618
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,600
And then we'll dance to the light,
To the sun sparkles at dawn.

619
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:11,800
And away we will go
Like the last winter snow,

620
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:16,500
Soon our work will be done!

621
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Oh, come with me you all!

622
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,900
No matter wht Polly may do!

623
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,500
So to yourself be true!

624
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,200
Oh, come with me now you all,

625
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:54,400
No matter what Polly may do!

626
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:58,400
Let the stars fill us all
And the moon cradle the soul!

627
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:03,300
So to yourself be true!

628
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:16,100
So to yourself be true!

629
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:27,000
Aaa!

630
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:49,200
Aaa!

631
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:16,400
Mommy! Guess what?

632
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,500
- Guess what?
- Yes, Wendy, what is it, darling?

633
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:30,800
A fairy's work is much more than
at first it might appear!

634
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:35,700
Suppose your broken clock ticks,
though it hasn't in a year!

635
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:40,000
Perchance you found a toy you lost or
gingling bells you hear!

636
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:47,900
It all means that one very special fairy...

637
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,400
... might be near!
