1
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,900
My name is Alice.

2
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,300
I worked for
the Umbrella Corporation...

3
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,500
...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

4
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,000
I was head of security...

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,600
...at a secret high-tech facility
called The Hive...

6
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,900
...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental...

7
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,700
...viral weaponry.

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,200
But there was an incident.

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,000
The virus escaped
and everybody died.

10
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,900
Trouble was...

11
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,100
...they didn't stay dead.

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,400
The T-virus reanimated their bodies.

13
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,600
But I survived.
Myself and one other...

14
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,500
...an environmentalist named Matt.

15
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,200
When we emerged, we were
seized by Umbrella scientists.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,700
Matt and I were separated.

17
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,300
He's mutating. I want him
in the Nemesis Program.

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Matt!

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Take her to the
Raccoon City facility...

20
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,900
...and assemble the team.

21
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,500
We're reopening The Hive.

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,000
I want to know
what went on down there.

23
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,900
We thought we'd
survived the horror.

24
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,700
But we were wrong.

25
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,200
You're watching Raccoon 7.
Now the weather, with Terri Morales.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,600
It's 6:10 in the a.m. and already
the temperature has reached...

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,100
...a massive 92 degrees as this
unprecedented heat wave continues.

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,700
Clear skies in Raccoon City and a
light breeze coming in from the west.

29
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,000
And as a special bonus just for you,
we have a pollen count of 0. 7.

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
That's a record low
for this time of year.

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,100
Good news for all you hay fever
and asthma sufferers.

32
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,900
All in all, it looks like it's gonna be
another beautiful day.

33
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,700
Stay with us. After the break...

34
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,700
...we're gonna look at your favorite
holiday hot spots.

35
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,900
Advance team, proceed.

36
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,300
Sir.

37
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,800
Holy shit.

38
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Excuse us, ma'am.
There's been an incident.

39
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,300
Excuse us, sir.
There's been an incident.

40
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,400
How bad is it?

41
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,000
- You must come with us.
- I must get my daughter.

42
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
- It's taken care of.
- What are you doing?

43
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,700
You don't understand.
She's left for school.

44
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,200
This is U-Gamma 7,
evacuation complete...

45
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,400
...but we just lost contact
with Gamma 12.

46
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,800
Unit 12 calling for immediate backup
at city hall.

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,100
Still no explanation for this wave
of unexplained killings...

48
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,500
...that is sweeping across the city.

49
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,900
A deadly crime spree with no end.

50
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,500
Backup, we need backup now!

51
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Just like Valentine told us...

52
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,400
Off-duty law enforcement personnel,
report for duty immediately.

53
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,800
Give us a hand over here,
this guy's insane!

54
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,400
- It's Valentine.
- Hold your fire.

55
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,100
- Valentine!
- They're infected.

56
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,400
Somebody get this ugly bitch
off of me!

57
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,800
I told you. Shoot for the head.

58
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,100
Please, somebody get her.

59
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,900
No! Don't shoot! Don't...

60
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,100
I'm leaving town.
I suggest you do the same.

61
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,700
Everyone's leaving the city.

62
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,400
We've received reports
of Umbrella Corporation...

63
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,900
...dispatching armed guards
and troop carriers.

64
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,500
Move in an orderly fashion
to security checkpoints.

65
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,800
The city is completely contained.
Troops have sealed all exits.

66
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,600
The only way out is this bridge.

67
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,700
All citizens must pass through
medical scanning.

68
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,500
Sir! You better take a look at this.

69
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,000
Family members must pass through
security checkpoints together.

70
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,300
Please proceed in an orderly fashion.
Do not run.

71
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,200
- He's clean. Let him pass.
- Next!

72
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,600
No pushing, please. Keep in line.

73
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,100
Can we get some
reinforcements down here?

74
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,500
Chopper Delta, new orders.

75
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,600
Proceed directly to
Ravens Gate Bridge.

76
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,300
Reinforcements urgently needed.

77
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,500
Copy that, base. On our way.

78
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,400
Get it.

79
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,900
No! Get off!

80
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,600
Get away! No! Stop! Get off!

81
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,600
No! Get back!

82
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,300
Civilian in trouble. Three o'clock.
Go down.

83
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,000
I can't. We have our orders.

84
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,300
No! Get back! No!

85
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
They're gonna kill her!
Take us down now!

86
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,500
She's a civilian. We have orders.

87
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,100
Fuck orders!

88
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,800
Nicholai, tie me off.

89
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,300
Get back! No!

90
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,800
Wait!

91
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,500
Now!

92
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,700
Take us down! Down, now!

93
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,600
Hey. Hey, you okay?

94
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,100
Step away from the edge.
Come over to me.

95
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,000
- Everything's okay.
- No, it's not.

96
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,500
I've seen what happens to you
once you've been bitten.

97
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,200
- We can help you.
- There's no going back.

98
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,800
No!

99
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,300
Move! Peyton!

100
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,200
- Peyton!
- Valentine. Hey, Valentine.

101
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
- Move! Police! Move!
- Let her through.

102
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,300
Glad you're here.
We could use the help.

103
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
- He has a weak heart.
- Get away from him!

104
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,100
Everybody, stand back!

105
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,900
- Daddy!
- Get away from him!

106
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,900
- Get her away from him!
- It's okay.

107
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,000
- Get her away!
- It's okay. Come on.

108
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,400
- Daddy!
- It's okay, I got you.

109
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,600
- Get him off! Get him off me!
- Move aside!

110
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,800
Get back!

111
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,900
It's here. It's reached the gate.

112
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,000
Why are you here? You should've
got out while you had the chance.

113
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,200
These are our people, Jill.

114
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,500
- Close them.
- Sir?

115
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,900
Seal the gates.

116
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,300
- Our men are still out there...
- Just do it.

117
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Oh, my God, they're closing
the gates!

118
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,100
This is a biohazard quarantine area.

119
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,300
Due to risk of infection, you cannot
be allowed to leave the city.

120
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,200
What the fuck is going on here?

121
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,000
All appropriate measures
are being taken.

122
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,300
The situation is under control.

123
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,500
Please return to your homes.

124
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,300
You won't get away with this!

125
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,400
Let us out!

126
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,500
You have five seconds
to turn around...

127
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,200
...and return to the city.

128
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,900
Do it.

129
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,500
Use of live ammunition
has been authorized.

130
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,200
Five.

131
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,400
- They can't shoot people!
- They won't fire.

132
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,300
Three.

133
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,600
- Get them back!
- Two.

134
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,900
- Move!
- One.

135
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,300
Everybody, clear out!

136
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Kilo and Romeo squads,
rendezvous at sector 01...

137
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,500
...and secure against enemy.

138
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,100
- Grenade!
- Grenade!

139
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,900
Squads three to seven
are on full retreat.

140
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,300
No, sir. Suppression measures
have failed. We can't contain it.

141
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,700
The infection is spreading faster
than anyone anticipated.

142
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,400
Dr. Ashford.

143
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,700
- Shouldn't you be on the chopper?
- I'm not going.

144
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,500
I was instructed to get you and
the other scientists out of the hot zone.

145
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,000
You're too important to Umbrella
to be at risk.

146
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,300
I'm not leaving without my daughter.

147
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,900
I'm sorry, truly.
But the city is sealed.

148
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,400
She may have survived the crash,
but we couldn't find her anywhere.

149
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,500
Even if she were still alive,
I couldn't let her out.

150
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,100
The risk of infection is too great.
You must understand.

151
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,500
You do what you have to do.

152
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm staying.

153
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,700
There has to be someone left alive.

154
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,500
Come on.

155
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,200
- Matt!
- Take her to the Raccoon City facility.

156
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,200
I want her quarantined.
Close observation.

157
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,100
Prepare her for exposure.

158
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,300
Up the dosage.

159
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,500
Just do it.

160
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,400
Inside.

161
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,900
Let's get under cover.

162
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,300
You have to get out.

163
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,700
This is my place. I'm hiding here.

164
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,500
- It's big enough for all of us.
- Don't tell me...

165
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,400
Okay, just cool it. Put the gun down.

166
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,900
Put the gun down.

167
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,400
And, you, take it easy.

168
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,700
So does the Raccoon City
Police Department...

169
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,200
...have any comment
on what those things are?

170
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,400
What's that you got there?

171
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,500
My Emmy.

172
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,500
That's if any of us make it out.

173
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,200
Are you all right?

174
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,600
What are you doing?

175
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,600
What's wrong?

176
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,100
It's my sister. She's not well.

177
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,500
- Maybe I can help.
- No.

178
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,600
Out of my way.

179
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,300
Just get out.

180
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
You're feeding her? You're sick.

181
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,600
Just leave us alone.

182
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,900
No!

183
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,100
- I'm getting out of here.
- Hey.

184
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,400
Hey! Hey, no!

185
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,300
Oh, my God!

186
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,500
Hey, help us! Come on!

187
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,600
Get it in there!

188
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,500
What the hell was that?

189
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,800
There!

190
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,900
Jesus.

191
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,700
- What the fuck is that thing?
- What are you doing?

192
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,500
Get back here.

193
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,100
Peyton.

194
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,100
Terri.

195
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,100
Peyton.

196
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,300
I know.

197
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,700
I count three of them.

198
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,500
They got us boxed in.

199
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,300
What are we gonna do?

200
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Let's go.

201
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,300
Jesus.

202
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,900
We're gonna need
more ammo. I'm out.

203
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,800
Shit. I'm out.

204
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,600
Move.

205
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,000
Who the fuck are you?

206
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,800
GTA, motherfucker!

207
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,700
Oh, yeah!

208
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,800
Ten points!

209
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,400
Yuri. You okay?

210
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,300
Bite this.

211
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,200
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

212
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,000
Pull back!

213
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,900
This way.

214
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,600
This is Olivera. We've been overrun.
Request immediate chopper evac.

215
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,000
We need to find somewhere
to stop for a moment.

216
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,900
I don't think that's a good idea.

217
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,700
There might be more of those...

218
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,800
...things.

219
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,300
If there were more,
we'd have seen them by now.

220
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,900
- You know what they are?
- They're bio-weapons...

221
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,900
...from Umbrella labs
beneath the city.

222
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,600
How come you know so much
about Umbrella?

223
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,400
I used to work for them.

224
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,700
Damn it.

225
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,400
Hold it.

226
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,100
What do you think you're doing?

227
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,500
He's wounded.
The infection's spreading.

228
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,900
I'm fine.

229
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,800
You should take care of him now.

230
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,100
It'll be more difficult later.

231
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,700
You know that.

232
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,300
No.

233
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,100
If it comes to that...

234
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,800
...I'll take care of it myself.

235
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,900
As you wish.

236
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,200
It's nothing personal.
But in an hour, maybe two...

237
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,800
...you'll be dead.

238
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,500
And moments later,
you'll become one of them.

239
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,600
You'll endanger your friends,
try to kill them...

240
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
...probably succeed.

241
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,100
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.

242
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,400
Help me!

243
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
There's too many of them.

244
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,900
Let's get out of here.
This way!

245
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,500
Sir, T-virus infection
has reached critical levels.

246
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,700
This is a perfect opportunity.

247
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,200
Ensure all data streams
are recorded.

248
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,000
Activate Nemesis Program now.

249
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,500
- Hey!
- Here! We're down here!

250
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,600
- Hey!
- Come! We're here!

251
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,700
- Where are they going?
- They're landing there. Let's get Yuri!

252
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,100
- Come on, Yuri. We're getting out.
- We'll get you fixed up. Come.

253
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,900
Hold on, Yuri. We're almost there.

254
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,200
No. No! Don't leave!

255
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,700
- Down here! We're coming!
- They dropped something.

256
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,500
Maybe a radio. One that works.

257
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,400
Take Yuri.

258
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,900
Hold on, Yuri.

259
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,700
Nicholai, put me down.

260
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,200
Okay, rest here.

261
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,100
What is this?

262
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,500
Looks like weapon cases.

263
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,300
We don't need weapons.
We need evacuation!

264
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,900
These weren't meant for us.

265
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,200
Yuri!

266
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,200
Plenty to go around.

267
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,000
Don't shoot!

268
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,900
I got the power.

269
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,200
Thank you! Owe you one, man.

270
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,300
Shit!

271
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,300
Maybe I was safer outside.

272
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,000
Get them guns out of my damn face.

273
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,200
Motherfucker, please. Look...

274
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
...my shit is custom.

275
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,500
What the fuck is that?

276
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,700
Shit!

277
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,600
You're going down,
you son of a bitch!

278
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,300
Fuck.

279
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,600
Deploy defensive formation.
Take him down.

280
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,900
You fuckers is crazy. Look at that guy,
got a rocket launcher.

281
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,800
- What do we have?
- A dozen armed men. Well organized.

282
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,300
- I'm surprised there's anyone left.
- They're S.T.A.R.S.

283
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,200
Special Tactics and Rescue Squad.
They're the best.

284
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,500
Fire!

285
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,900
Back! Fall back!

286
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,900
- Let's see how good they really are.
- Altering protocols.

287
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,500
S.T.A.R.S.

288
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,300
Oh, shit.

289
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,800
Respect.

290
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,100
Those were some pretty slick moves
back there.

291
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,600
I'm good...

292
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,700
...but I'm not that good.

293
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,900
- You should be thankful for that.
- What do you mean?

294
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,200
They did something to me.

295
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,000
I barely feel human anymore.

296
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,100
We should keep moving.
Before the sound attracts anything.

297
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,700
Keep moving.

298
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,700
- Hello?
- God, I thought you'd never answer.

299
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,200
- Who is this?
- I can get you out of the city.

300
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
All four of you.

301
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,300
But first we have
to come to an arrangement.

302
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,400
Are you ready to make a deal?

303
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,600
- Do we have a choice?
- Not if you want to live past tonight, no.

304
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,900
His name is Dr. Ashford and he...

305
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,900
Runs the genetics and viral research
division of Umbrella Corporation.

306
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,300
What's he want with us?

307
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,800
His daughter, Angela,
is trapped in the city.

308
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,700
Umbrella was to evac her,
but she didn't make it.

309
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,500
She's hiding out in her school.

310
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,400
We find her, he'll help us escape
the perimeter.

311
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,700
No fucking deal.

312
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,800
We find the building with
the thickest walls and doors...

313
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,100
...and we barricade ourselves in.
Sit tight, wait for help.

314
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,200
There won't be any help.

315
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,100
Umbrella knows
they can't contain the infection.

316
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,300
So at sunrise this morning, Raccoon
City will be completely sanitized.

317
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,500
What do you mean by "sanitized"?

318
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,000
A precision tactical nuclear device.

319
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,000
- What yield?
- Five kilotons.

320
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
- Fuck me.
- Stupid.

321
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,000
- What does that mean?
- It means it'll destroy the infection...

322
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,700
...and all evidence of it.

323
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,300
It's bullshit. It's bullshit!

324
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,700
No fucking way would they
get away with that!

325
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,500
- It would be all over the fucking news!
- Cover-up.

326
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,200
Cover-up's already prepared.

327
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,000
A meltdown
at the nuclear power plant.

328
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,700
- A tragic accident.
- Not even Umbrella is capable of this.

329
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,500
Not capable?

330
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,900
Peyton, you were there at the bridge.

331
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,800
You know exactly how far
Umbrella will go.

332
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,400
So, what do we do now, huh?

333
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,500
I think we should be out of here
by sunrise.

334
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,500
What if there is no way out and he's
watching us on these cameras...

335
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,700
...like this is some kind
of sick game?

336
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,500
- What is it?
- What's going on?

337
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,100
- Wait.
- Sunrise ain't gonna wait.

338
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,700
No.

339
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,300
- There's something down there.
- Where?

340
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,200
There.

341
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,500
I don't see anything.

342
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,200
That doesn't alter the fact that
there is something down there.

343
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,800
I'm getting sick of this bullshit!

344
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,300
Peyton!

345
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,200
No!

346
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,800
He's located another two
S.T.A.R.S. members.

347
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,300
Nemesis.

348
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,500
Run. Just go!

349
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,800
Primary target is identified.

350
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,900
Gentlemen, this is what
we've been waiting for.

351
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,300
Confirm at 2: 18 and 27 seconds.

352
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,700
The Nemesis Program is now
fully activated.

353
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,900
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about your friend.

354
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,900
Let's just get to the school
and find this kid.

355
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,700
This bite...

356
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,500
...it won't stop bleeding.

357
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,200
- Why didn't they see us?
- What?

358
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,200
The chopper. We were right there
in the street in front of the hospital.

359
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,000
- How could they not see us?
- They saw us.

360
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,500
What do you mean?

361
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,700
We're assets, Nicholai.

362
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,700
Expendable assets.

363
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,300
And we've just been expended.

364
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,700
Stop!

365
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,900
I'm not one of those things.

366
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,200
Hey, remember me? Look, I haven't
been bitten or anything. Look.

367
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,700
Climb aboard.

368
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,600
Lloyd Jefferson Wade.

369
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,900
You can call me L.J. on account
of the informal situation.

370
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,000
We're gonna have to split up
to search this place.

371
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,100
Forget it. Forget it! I'm not going
out there by myself.

372
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,100
I can go with you.

373
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,200
You, take the first floor.

374
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,600
You, take the second.

375
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,500
I'll take the basement.

376
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,700
- I've never shot a gun before.
- There's nothing to it.

377
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,500
Try to hit them in the head.

378
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,700
I see you, mother...

379
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,900
Oh, shit!

380
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,900
So did you get the call as well?

381
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,500
- What?
- You're here for the girl?

382
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,700
Oh, yeah, yeah. The girl.

383
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,100
Dr. Ashford didn't say he made a deal
with someone else.

384
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,700
I guess we're partners.

385
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,200
Shit.

386
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,700
Angela?

387
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,800
It's gonna be okay.

388
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,400
There's no need to be afraid.

389
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,800
We're gonna take you home.

390
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,100
Oh, my God.

391
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,600
Help me!

392
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,300
Terri?

393
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,500
You can't help her.

394
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,300
Not now.

395
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,800
I've seen what they do.

396
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,000
- Are you Angela?
- Yes.

397
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,600
We should hurry
before they come back.

398
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,100
Hold this.

399
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,100
Angela Ashford, huh?

400
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,900
That's a pretty grown-up name
for a little girl.

401
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,900
I'm not a little girl.

402
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,700
Besides...

403
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,500
...all my friends call me Angie.
- Angie, huh?

404
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,800
I like that.

405
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,700
Those things are in here.

406
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,600
It's okay, honey. They're slow.
We can run around them.

407
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,600
No.

408
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,600
Not them.

409
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,000
Them.

410
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,500
Get back.

411
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,800
Stay.

412
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,900
Thought you might need a hand.

413
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,600
- You work for Umbrella?
- Used to.

414
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:55,900
Until they left us for dead in this place.
Now I consider myself freelance.

415
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,600
Sergeant Nicholai Genovev,
at your service.

416
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,100
- Come on!
- Wait! Angie!

417
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,400
Save the girl! I've got this bitch.

418
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,600
Oh, shit.

419
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,600
From now on, stay right beside me.

420
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,300
It's blocked.

421
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,300
What do we do now?

422
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,100
Wait here. Eyes:

423
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,000
Okay?

424
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,700
Thank you.

425
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,000
You two know each other?

426
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,900
She's infected.

427
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,200
She's infected on a massive level.

428
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,900
- How can you know that?
- Because she is too.

429
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,600
You're infected? When were
you gonna tell us that?

430
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,500
- Let me see.
- No.

431
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,500
You know I'm not gonna hurt you.

432
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,900
Let me see.

433
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,900
It's the antivirus,
the cure to the T-virus.

434
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,200
There's a cure?

435
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,800
How did you get this?

436
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,300
My daddy.
My daddy made it for me.

437
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,700
He's sick.
And someday, I'll get sick too.

438
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,500
He just wanted to stop that.

439
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,300
When I was little...

440
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,300
...I had to walk on crutches.

441
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,800
They said I'd never get better,
just worse.

442
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,700
He found a way
to make me stronger.

443
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,700
The T-virus.

444
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,400
Then they took the invention
away from him.

445
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,100
Get out of my house!

446
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,200
He's not a bad man.

447
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,800
He didn't mean for any of this.

448
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,900
It's okay.

449
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,700
Don't shoot! He's cool.

450
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,400
He made a deal with Dr. Doom,
same as you.

451
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,400
How many of you guys are there?

452
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,200
What do you mean?

453
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,500
Nicholai.

454
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,300
When were you bitten?

455
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,100
- Three hours ago.
- What the...?

456
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,900
It's your lucky day.

457
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,900
Should have told me you got bit.
I'm hanging with you and shit.

458
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:52,100
- Let me speak to my daughter.
- First, you tell us how we're getting out.

459
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,700
There's a helicopter
already being prepped.

460
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,500
It takes off in 47 minutes.

461
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,700
It'll be the last transport to leave
Raccoon City before they detonate.

462
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,500
I take it this helicopter isn't
laid out just for us.

463
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,700
No. It has another purpose,
but it'll be lightly guarded.

464
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,700
- Where's the evac site?
- May I speak to my daughter now?

465
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,300
- Daddy?
- Hey, sweetheart.

466
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,000
- Are you all right?
- When can I see you?

467
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,500
Soon. These people will
bring you to see me.

468
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,300
I'll see you very soon.

469
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,100
Put the lady back on.

470
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,300
Where do we have to go?

471
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,500
The helicopter will be at city hall.

472
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,700
I suggest you make haste.

473
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,800
Computers...

474
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,100
...so unreliable.

475
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,200
Just like people.

476
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,300
You really thought I didn't know?

477
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,800
So, what are you injecting me with?

478
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,700
The antivirus.

479
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,200
The T-virus reanimates dead cells.

480
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,300
Basically, bringing the dead to life.

481
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:30,500
Or in a living human,
it can cause uncontrollable mutation.

482
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,900
Or it can help her walk again,
if the virus is kept in check with this.

483
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,200
- Angie's infected?
- Yes.

484
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,100
The cellular growth is enough
to regenerate her...

485
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,300
...but not enough to cause mutation.

486
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,800
And they infected you
with the T-virus as well?

487
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,900
Yeah.

488
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,700
But don't worry.
I'm not contagious.

489
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,900
Here.

490
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,300
Tape the story.
I'll see that it gets put to good use.

491
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,000
My name is Alice.

492
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,000
I worked for the
Umbrella Corporation...

493
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,800
...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

494
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,100
I was head of security at a secret
high-tech facility called The Hive...

495
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:18,900
...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental...

496
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,800
...viral weaponry.

497
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,100
Let's go.

498
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,600
You missed one.

499
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,700
We have to hurry.

500
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,800
- We're okay. We have time.
- No! We have to hurry.

501
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,900
- Holy shit! We stealing his ride!
- Take off.

502
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,100
- I said, take off!
- What's the rush?

503
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,600
We've been expecting you.

504
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,100
- Perimeter secure.
- All sectors locked down.

505
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,200
- Angie!
- Daddy!

506
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,800
- I knew you wouldn't leave me.
- No. Never.

507
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,800
Discard primary weaponry.

508
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:21,900
The two of you showed such promise,
but we had to see you in action.

509
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,600
And most impressive you've been.

510
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,500
You're like brother and sister.

511
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,800
Heightened speed, strength,
agility, the same killer instincts.

512
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,100
Parallel strands of research.

513
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:37,200
And now...
Now we'll discover which is superior.

514
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,600
Fight him.

515
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,200
No.

516
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,600
Fight him, or they die.

517
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,100
What makes you think I care?

518
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,100
Daddy! Daddy, no.

519
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,200
No.

520
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,300
He was a valuable asset
to the corporation.

521
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,300
I don't even care
about these people.

522
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,100
Begin.

523
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:53,800
He's mutating. I want him
in the Nemesis Program.

524
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,000
Matt!

525
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,400
Cellular structure breaking down.

526
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,300
T-virus is manifesting itself
in a genetic mutation.

527
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,700
We're seeing similar
cellular regeneration.

528
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,500
I'm sorry.

529
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,200
Oh, Matt. I'm so sorry.

530
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,300
Finish him.

531
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,700
I said, finish him.

532
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,300
No.

533
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,100
No.

534
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,500
Don't you understand
how important you are to me?

535
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,800
That creature is one thing,
but you...

536
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,400
...somehow you bonded
with the T-virus on a cellular level.

537
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
You adapted it, changed it.
You became magnificent.

538
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,400
- I became a freak.
- No.

539
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,200
You're not mutation.
You're evolution.

540
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:59,300
With my help, just imagine
what you can achieve.

541
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,600
What about him?

542
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,900
Evolution has its dead ends.

543
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,300
Now, finish this.
Put him out of his misery...

544
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,500
...and come with me.

545
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,900
No.

546
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,400
You're such
a disappointment to me.

547
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,000
All that strength...

548
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,500
...but no will to use it.

549
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,500
What a waste.

550
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,500
Prepare for takeoff.

551
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,600
Sanitation of Raccoon City
to commence on my mark.

552
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,100
Kill her.

553
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,000
What are you doing?

554
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,200
Get us airborne.

555
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,900
This is Cain. Priority overload.
Initiate launch proceedings.

556
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,600
Detonation set
at T-minus 5 minutes.

557
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,200
Angie, get down!

558
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,900
Why haven't we taken off?

559
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,700
Because I usually drive a Cadillac.

560
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,900
Surrender, or we open fire.

561
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,000
Drop it.

562
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,100
Alice!

563
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,800
Drop your weapon and surrender.

564
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,000
Let's get this thing in the air!

565
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,700
You have to get up.

566
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:00,900
Matt...

567
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:05,300
Come on, we have to go.
We have to go. Come on.

568
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,800
Come on.

569
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,600
Get up!

570
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:25,300
If you expect me to beg, I will not.

571
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,500
Wait.

572
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,200
Killing me won't put things right.

573
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,100
No...

574
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,000
...but it's a start.

575
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,500
Are you going to be all right?

576
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,700
Hang on to something!

577
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,400
We're going down!

578
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:26,300
U-Gamma 9 to base.
Confirmation.

579
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,000
We've located the crash site.

580
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,100
Fetch the medical team.

581
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,800
What about the others?

582
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,300
No other bodies found, sir.

583
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:03,800
We have unconfirmed reports
of disaster at Raccoon City.

584
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,700
These shocking images just in.

585
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,900
A mysterious plague
or viral outbreak has run rampant...

586
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:12,200
Implicating Umbrella Corporation
in deaths of innocent citizens.

587
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,600
This tape, work of former Raccoon 7
anchorwoman Terri Morales.

588
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,100
New evidence now
discredits earlier reports...

589
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,600
- Nothing more than sick joke.
- Fake videotape totally discredited.

590
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,300
Nothing more than a big hoax.

591
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,200
Playing on the very real tragedy...

592
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,700
...which overwhelmed
Raccoon City this week.

593
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,900
The reactor at the nuclear
power station went critical.

594
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:36,500
The worst atomic disaster since the
Russian Chernobyl incident in 1986.

595
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,900
The state governor personally
thanked the Umbrella Corporation...

596
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,300
...for their swift action.

597
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:45,100
The perpetrators of the hoax,
Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera...

598
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,000
...now being sought
for questioning by the police.

599
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,900
Alice.

600
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,700
Alice, wake up.

601
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,300
Can you hear me?

602
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,600
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

603
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,500
Good.

604
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,500
Begin the purging process.

605
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,700
Her recovery's remarkable.

606
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,300
And her powers,
both physical and mental...

607
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,300
...are developing
at a geometric rate.

608
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,400
Where are you?

609
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,000
You're safe.

610
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,900
Come on.

611
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,100
That's it.

612
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,100
There we are.

613
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,400
Do you know what that is?

614
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:49,700
It's a pen.

615
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,300
You see?

616
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,100
You try.

617
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,000
That's it.

618
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,500
Pen.

619
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,700
Look at me.

620
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,100
Can you remember anything?

621
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,200
You remember your name?

622
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,900
My name?

623
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,500
My name.

624
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,500
I want her under
24-hour observation.

625
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,400
A complete set of blood work.

626
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,800
Chemical and electrolyte analysis
by the end of the day.

627
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,400
My name.

628
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,000
- My name.
- Sir.

629
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,100
Advanced reflex testing is a priority.

630
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,200
My name.

631
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,200
- Monitor electrical impulses...
- Sir.

632
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,700
Sir!

633
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
What is it?

634
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:58,100
My name...

635
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,000
...is Alice.

636
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,300
And I remember everything.

637
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,100
This is central.
Request immediate backup.

638
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,200
Maximum response.

639
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,600
Thank you, gentlemen.
We'll take over from here.

640
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:25,000
- On whose authority?
- Classified. Level six authorization.

641
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,900
Sorry, sir.

642
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,500
Let them go.

643
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,000
Good to have you back.

644
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,100
Are you all right?

645
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,600
Program Alice activated.

646
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,500
What did they do to you?

647
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,200
This is a product of the
Umbrella Corporation.

648
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,800
Our business is life itself.

649
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,700
Some side effects may occur.
