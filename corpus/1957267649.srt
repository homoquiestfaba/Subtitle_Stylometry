[ominous music]

191
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:33,248
[sighs] You agreed to 389.

192
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,022
Well I'm sorry I wasted your time.

193
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,996
Did you want your hotdog?

194
00:17:38,998 --> 00:17:41,708
[hot dog thuds]

195
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,878
How much do you have?

196
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,364
- 250.
- All right.

197
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:46,197
Give me that.

198
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,737
What do I get for 250?

199
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:53,663
[dramatic drum roll]

200
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:01,891
Um, sex.

201
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:07,606
[intense music]

202
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:15,061
Oh, yeah. Big daddy.

203
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:16,457
You feel so good.

204
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:19,126
[bed squeaking]

205
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,616
You wanna get on top?

206
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:24,599
Pew, pew, pew, pew!

207
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,864
- [hand whacks]
- Fuck me!

208
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:28,533
[intense music]

209
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:42,547

[spider cracking and squishing]

225
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:46,538
Eh.

226
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:49,913
[sniffs] Ooh, it's hot in there.

227
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,098
Was that okay?

228
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,680
You're doing great.

229
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:55,818
[chuckling]

230
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,820
Thank you for feeding
all 23,000 of my babies.

231
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:03,233
[suspenseful music]

232
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,628
Can I go home now?

233
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,182
I haven't seen my family in six months.

234
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:08,382
So help me, please.

235
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:09,793
[chuckles] Maybe tomorrow.

236
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,533
I have four more
appointments for me today.

237
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,163
Hey, you're doing a great job.

238
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,770
Who's my little black widow?

239
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:26,878
Who's my little black widow?

240
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,713
I am.

241
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,743
I am.

242
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,504
That's right.

243
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:35,256
[intense music]

244
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:37,070
Hey, hey, hey.

245
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,530
It's not like you're gonna die today.

246
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:46,642
Huh?

247
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,663
[chuckles]

248
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:57,118
[door opens]

249
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,438
Hey, sexy.

250
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,468
I've got some cocaine.

251
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,648
Both edible and old school powder.

252
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,278
Huh, yeah. Some amyl nitrate.

253
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,280
And 500 credits with
your name all over it.

254
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,128
See the ladies, they call me Chad,

255
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,063
but you can call me Rad.

256
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:23,596
Oh, yeah. Feel me now.

257
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:28,503
[intense music]

258
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:30,898
[static buzzing]

259
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,728
I can't tell if these are historical

260
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,105
or fictional narratives.

261
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:38,318
[sighs] It's hard to say.

262
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,619
Things were a lot different back then.

263
00:21:40,621 --> 00:21:43,621
[suspenseful music]

264
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:47,823
[static buzzing]

265
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:52,906
Do you think it's safe?

266
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:55,787
To forage here, I mean?
It could be territory.

267
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:58,727
No, the riders never come up here.

268
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:01,134
They're way too superstitious.

269
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:03,136
But keep your eyes open.

270
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,414
Do you think it's true?

271
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,984
What they say about the Northlands?

272
00:22:07,986 --> 00:22:12,240
[chuckles] What that
people never return?

273
00:22:12,242 --> 00:22:14,029
Think you can chock that
up more to feral tribes

274
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:16,813
than any kind of war ghost.

275
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:18,287
[wind rustling]

276
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:21,289
[suspenseful music]

277
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:44,541
It's a graveyard up here.

278
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:48,244
I can see why Sliv and the
others didn't wanna come.

279
00:22:48,246 --> 00:22:49,163
You came.

280
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,667
I won't forget that.

281
00:22:52,803 --> 00:22:55,037
I couldn't let you go by yourself.

282
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,803
Besides, if there is any
water stored up here,

283
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:03,102
I couldn't let you get
all the praise for it.

284
00:23:03,104 --> 00:23:05,386
[both chuckling]

285
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:08,138

288
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:17,587
Tig!

289
00:24:19,446 --> 00:24:24,446
Come see this.

290
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:39,201
A sea glass.

291
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:43,475
Can't do much with those.

292
00:24:43,477 --> 00:24:45,246
It took the ancients long enough

293
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:47,915
to figure that out on their own.

294
00:24:49,095 --> 00:24:51,602
I haven't seen one since I was little.

295
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:52,437
Hmm.

296
00:24:54,482 --> 00:24:57,123
Don't stare into it too long.

297
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,875
We've got work to do.

298
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:03,200
See if you can find something useful.

299
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,535
Dried food, water, supplies.

300
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,143
Yeah.

301
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:11,628
I know the drill.

302
00:25:15,353 --> 00:25:18,103

[suspenseful music]

312
00:27:06,227 --> 00:27:07,060
Tig!

313
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:20,685
Tig?

314
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,982
Stop messing around.

What are you?

[woman gasps]

335
00:30:18,908 --> 00:30:20,241
What happened?

336
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:22,440
What...

337
00:30:24,664 --> 00:30:25,747
What's wrong?

338
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,920
What's wrong?

339
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:31,653
What was that?

340
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:33,052
What was what?

341
00:30:33,054 --> 00:30:34,630
Who are you?

342
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:35,873
It's me, Tig.

343
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,050
I don't understand why you're upset.

344
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:38,477
- Everything's okay.
- What is... [sobbing]

345
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:40,406
It's okay. It's okay.

346
00:30:40,408 --> 00:30:43,068
Shh, calm down. Calm down.

347

Calm down. It's okay.

[woman sobbing]
It's okay.

349
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:51,330
Everything's gonna be okay.

350
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:53,749
Everything will be just fine.

I have no idea what
I'm watching right now.

357
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,833
It's really bizarre.

358
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,988
Back then people used
to subject themselves

359
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,406
to horror for entertainment.

360
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:16,285
Insane.

[suspenseful music]

397
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:01,438
We need to commence human trials.

What? Are you serious?

399
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,215
- No.
- We have to.

400
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:09,403
How? How do you
suppose we do that, Nile?

401
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,318
What? Are you insane?

402
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,264
It's the only way we
can ever know for certain.

403
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,803
No, I won't allow it.

404

You think I don't know
what's been bothering you.

405
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,508
You've been watching the same

If you want to know
what's happened to Ben-

- Do not talk about my son. Ever!

408
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,698
If you ever wanna see him
again, we have to do this.

409
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,425
I could never risk it, Nile.

410
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,760

heard anything strange?

Strange? How do you mean?

751
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,743
Voices that come from nowhere?

753
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,858

755
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,058
Aria.

756

Hello, Aria. I'm Selena.

757
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,838
Yes. I feel like I've
known you for so long.

758
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,158
I see you everywhere.

759
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,353
I've worked here hundreds of times.

760
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:46,078
Since I was 17.

761
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,908
- I've heard somebody-
- And I haven't seen

762
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,218
anything that would lead me to believe

763
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:52,083
that this place is haunted, Aria.

764
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,088
I didn't say haunted.

765
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:57,068
I don't believe in that.

766
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:57,943

Posed photographs of the dead.

772
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:14,208
Back then, photography
wasn't widely available.

773
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:17,313
So people had their loved ones
photo taken when they died.

774
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:20,858
Probably because they didn't have

775
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:23,548
any done while they were still alive.

776
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:25,188
Scary, huh?

777
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:27,758

I don't quit.

796

did encounter a ghost.

798
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:55,258
Maybe it's envious of you, Aria.

799

935
01:24:59,503 --> 01:25:02,503
[audience cheering]

936
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:15,242
It is over!

937
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:18,178
[audience cheering]

938
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:22,173
Lillian Rouge has endured three months

939
01:25:22,175 --> 01:25:23,899
in the viewing room.

940
01:25:23,901 --> 01:25:26,984
[audience cheering]

941
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:32,615
How do you feel, Lillian?

942
01:25:32,617 --> 01:25:35,700
[suspenseful music]

943
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:38,428
You have made it through.

944
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:40,458
You are only minutes away

945
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:43,703
from finding out whether
you've won $200,000!

946
01:25:46,536 --> 01:25:47,888
[audience cheering]

947
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:49,893
How does that make you feel?

948
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:57,593
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, well.

949
01:25:58,630 --> 01:25:59,928
It looks like Lillian's a bit

950
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:02,116
caught up for words right now.

951
01:26:02,118 --> 01:26:04,558
[audience cheering]

952
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,713
Let's take a look back
at how this all started.

953
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,098
This week on "Snare",

954
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:14,828
aspiring actress and Bakehouse
Employee, Lillian Rouge,

955
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:16,298
is thrown in the viewing room

956
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:19,243
for her shot at $200,000.

957
01:26:21,694 --> 01:26:23,378
I nominated Lillian for "Snare"

958
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:25,158
because she has a great personality.

959
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:28,008
And now the world will
get to know her as I do.

960
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:30,768
Plus that extra $200,000 couldn't hurt.

961
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:33,618
Lillian won our hearts
from the very beginning

962
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:37,534
with #bitethatfinger trending worldwide.

963
01:26:37,536 --> 01:26:38,808
[dramatic music]

964
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:39,710
She made us laugh,

965
01:26:41,011 --> 01:26:44,827
and she made us cry.

966
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:50,298
[audience cheering]

967
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:52,143
Voting is closed.

968
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:58,350
I have the results here
on this piece of paper.

969
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:01,833
You have voted.

970
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:06,943
Is Lillian worth it?

971
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:15,403
Does she win $200,000?

972
01:27:20,322 --> 01:27:23,405
[audience cheering]

973
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:29,650
The answer is...

974
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,126
Ladies and gentlemen, yes!

975
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:39,608
Lillian wins!

976
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:42,558
With an approval rating of 87%,

977
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,958
Lillian has won all our hearts.

978
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,753
She has now been given
a check for $200,000!

979
01:27:49,251 --> 01:27:50,790
Congratulations, Lillian.

980
01:27:50,792 --> 01:27:52,969
May all your dreams come true.

981
01:27:52,971 --> 01:27:56,669
Thank you once again
for watching, "Snared."

982
01:27:56,671 --> 01:27:58,078
[static buzzing]

983
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,778
Okay, Otis. I think I've seen enough.

984
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,428
I'm gonna gather everything I can

985
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:04,678
and head back to the rendezvous point.

986
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,933
There's no way the university
is gonna believe this.

987
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:09,991
Copy.

988
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:12,663
Be sure and wait for me
at the rendezvous point.

989
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:16,204
[suspenseful music]

990
01:28:16,206 --> 01:28:17,037
[beeping]

991
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:20,162
Executor Corvid, this
is Agent 23 reporting.

992
01:28:20,164 --> 01:28:21,158
[static buzzing]

993
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,713
Agent 23, deliver your report.

994
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:26,568
Click has evaded the century

995
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:29,368
and has activated the Sacred Archive.

996
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:31,543
Than the original
plan must be activated.

997
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,078
Leave the planet immediately

998
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,408
and return to the cabal.

999
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:38,453
Additional guardians will be activated.

1000
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:42,078
Are you sure we can't exfiltrate Click?

1001
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,943
That seems like a tremendous
waste of resources.

1002
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:50,388
Consider this a test of faith, 23.

1003
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:51,868
You have your orders.

1004
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:52,733
Courted out.

1005
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:55,133
Orders confirmed.

1006
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,720
Agent 23, out.

1007
01:28:59,623 --> 01:29:02,623
[suspenseful music]

1008
01:29:06,071 --> 01:29:08,738
[intense music]

1009
01:29:10,264 --> 01:29:11,796
[Man] You know nothing.

1010
01:29:11,798 --> 01:29:14,155
Hell is only a word.

1011
01:29:14,157 --> 01:29:16,490
Reality is much, much worse.

1012
01:29:19,093 --> 01:29:21,760
[intense music]

1013
01:31:47,201 --> 01:31:50,059
Where we're going, you
won't need eyes to see.

1014
01:31:50,061 --> 01:31:52,811
[intense music]
