A letter to the West Law

against that prepubescent monkey boy.

to sign up for squash with us.

It looks so awesome.

1190
01:17:46,408 --> 01:17:48,842
[CHATTERING]

1191
01:17:49,011 --> 01:17:50,273
MASSIE:
Ta-da!

1192
01:17:50,446 --> 01:17:52,346
ALICIA:
Oh, my God. Where'd you get that?

1193
01:17:52,514 --> 01:17:53,845
- That's so cute.
- Really cute.

1194
01:17:54,016 --> 01:17:55,210
KRISTEN:
You look amazing.

1195
01:17:55,384 --> 01:17:57,750
Yeah, Chris Babely
is seriously gonna freak.

1196
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,889
A hundred dollars says tonight
you're getting your first kiss.

1197
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:02,887
And maybe my second and third too.

1198
01:18:03,959 --> 01:18:05,221
ALICIA:
Oh, my God. That's too cute.

1199
01:18:05,394 --> 01:18:06,827
That's adorable. Oh, my God.

1200
01:18:06,995 --> 01:18:10,089
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1201
01:18:10,265 --> 01:18:15,066
And sold for $ 15,000. Thank you.

1202
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:20,273
I wish we could bid on something.

1203
01:18:20,843 --> 01:18:24,108
Think there will be anything
that goes for under 20 bucks?

1204
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:26,475
Oh, hey.

1205
01:18:26,648 --> 01:18:28,775
MRS. BLOCK:
We'll start the bidding at $ 12,000.

1206
01:18:28,951 --> 01:18:30,816
Still no Massie.

1207
01:18:30,986 --> 01:18:34,149
Maybe the wicked witch of Westchester
is dead.

1208
01:18:34,556 --> 01:18:36,456
I'll be right back.

1209
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:38,923
CLAIRE:
Alicia, these are yours.

1210
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:40,118
The dresses.

1211
01:18:40,295 --> 01:18:42,263
My parents thought
I should give them back.

1212
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,626
And your cell phone's in there too.

1213
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,564
By the way,
nice job trying to oust Massie.

1214
01:18:47,736 --> 01:18:49,328
You got closer than I ever did.

1215
01:18:49,505 --> 01:18:54,533
MRS. BLOCK:
Sold for $ 17,500 to the lucky lady.

1216
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:55,904
- Thank you.
CLAIRE: Hey, Dylan.

1217
01:18:56,645 --> 01:18:59,205
For what it's worth,
you would've rocked that miniskirt.

1218
01:18:59,381 --> 01:19:01,110
MRS. BLOCK:
Before we wrap up our auction...

1219
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:02,716
Thanks.

1220
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:04,980
MRS. BLOCK:
Please save some room for dessert...

1221
01:19:05,153 --> 01:19:06,518
Where's Massie?

1222
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:08,849
- because we have
a very special birthday presentation.

1223
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:10,958
Chris Abeley, this one's for you.

1224
01:19:20,869 --> 01:19:22,131
[LAUGHS]

1225
01:19:27,509 --> 01:19:29,704
CLAIRE: I think it'd be nice if someone...
- What the...?

1226
01:19:29,878 --> 01:19:33,314
...said a few words about Chris.
- Claire Lyons, I'm gonna kill you!

1227
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,314
I think I'd like Fawn, Chris's girlfriend...

1228
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:38,646
...to please come up.

1229
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,845
Chris's girlfriend, Fawn, come up here.

1230
01:19:43,725 --> 01:19:46,558
Fawn? Girlfriend?

1231
01:19:49,298 --> 01:19:50,492
Um...

1232
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:53,066
I really don't know what to say.

1233
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:56,295
Chris and I met back in the seventh grade,
you know.

1234
01:19:56,471 --> 01:19:59,929
- I wasn't really that interested...
CLAIRE: Massie, it's safe to come out now.

1235
01:20:00,475 --> 01:20:03,000
FAWN:
I was like, whoa.

1236
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:04,304
He has a girlfriend?

1237
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:07,209
FAWN: When he didn't hit me in the face
with a dodge ball...

1238
01:20:07,382 --> 01:20:08,679
...I knew he was the one.

1239
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,374
Happy birthday, babe.

1240
01:20:10,552 --> 01:20:12,577
I love you.

1241
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:17,383
I think I'm gonna barf.

1242
01:20:24,433 --> 01:20:28,096
Is it possible to actually die
of embarrassment?

1243
01:20:28,604 --> 01:20:31,630
If it were, I'd be dead a long time ago.

1244
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:39,574
They fall off all the time, the charms.

1245
01:20:39,748 --> 01:20:41,443
Mm-hm.

1246
01:20:41,617 --> 01:20:43,278
MASSIE:
Um...

1247
01:20:43,452 --> 01:20:46,387
Thanks, you know,
for helping me back there.

1248
01:20:46,555 --> 01:20:48,216
You didn't have to do that.

1249
01:20:49,424 --> 01:20:50,857
I know.

1250
01:20:51,793 --> 01:20:54,125
Then why did you?

1251
01:20:54,496 --> 01:20:56,054
Because I'm not you.

1252
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,768
That was you, right,
who sent the oatmeal text?

1253
01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:02,426
Yeah.

1254
01:21:02,604 --> 01:21:03,696
Why?

1255
01:21:03,872 --> 01:21:06,238
You could've been the hero.
Why'd you let me?

1256
01:21:06,975 --> 01:21:09,000
I don't know. I wanted to.

1257
01:21:09,177 --> 01:21:13,045
Come on, what about all the other times
you've tried to make my life miserable?

1258
01:21:13,215 --> 01:21:14,409
You don't get it, Claire.

1259
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:16,312
You're right, I don't.

1260
01:21:16,485 --> 01:21:19,716
Look how quickly my friends
were willing to ditch me for you.

1261
01:21:19,888 --> 01:21:22,584
Yeah, so, what,
you have to be mean to me?

1262
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:27,653
I mean, come on.
You're, like, a major threat.

1263
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:34,926
Me? To who, you?

1264
01:21:35,103 --> 01:21:37,333
Are you kidding me?

1265
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:40,597
Hey, the singing stopped.

1266
01:21:42,177 --> 01:21:44,270
Well, I better go find the girls.

1267
01:21:44,446 --> 01:21:46,710
It's not really a party without me.

1268
01:21:47,349 --> 01:21:50,409
This is going to sound totally weird,
but can I take your picture?

1269
01:21:50,585 --> 01:21:52,143
It's for my brother.

1270
01:21:52,721 --> 01:21:55,485
How can you two be related?
He's such a little creep.

1271
01:21:55,657 --> 01:21:57,022
I know.

1272
01:22:06,334 --> 01:22:07,858
Here.

1273
01:22:08,036 --> 01:22:10,436
And for the record, I'd pick A too.

1274
01:22:11,173 --> 01:22:12,197
What's A-2?

1275
01:22:13,208 --> 01:22:14,835
I'd rather be a friendless loser...

1276
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:17,604
...than have a bunch of friends
who secretly hate me.

1277
01:23:11,099 --> 01:23:12,327
Did you have fun tonight?

1278
01:23:12,934 --> 01:23:14,231
Actually, I did.

1279
01:23:15,203 --> 01:23:16,761
Who gave you the flower?

1280
01:23:16,938 --> 01:23:18,735
Believe it or not, Massie did.

1281
01:23:19,808 --> 01:23:22,436
Not sure how long it'll last,
but I'm hoping for a while.

1282
01:23:23,145 --> 01:23:25,739
Are you talking about the flower
or Massie?

1283
01:23:26,915 --> 01:23:28,109
Both.

1284
01:27:46,207 --> 01:27:48,198
