1
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,165
This is a diary...

2
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:14,674
of...

3
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:17,968
hate.

4
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,281
And perhaps I wouldn't
be writing it...

5
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:29,449
if some devil hadn't made me
stop him that night...

6
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,049
in the rain.

7
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:34,219
You want to drown, Henry?

8
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:39,793
I wanted a bit of air.

9
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:42,802
How nice to see you, Bendrix.

10
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,304
How long has it been?
A year?

11
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:48,466
June, 1944.

12
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,205
As long as that?

13
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:53,679
How's Sarah?

14
00:02:53,748 --> 00:02:56,148
Oh, she's out and about
somewhere.

15
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,151
She at the cinema?

16
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:01,480
No, she never goes.

17
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,153
Oh, good night, Henry.

18
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,990
You should go home
before you catch your death.

19
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:14,401
Is something wrong?

20
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:20,640
Let me take you home, Henry.

21
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:26,271
Or perhaps I wouldn't
be writing this...

22
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:29,316
if I had known then
who I hated.

23
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:32,477
Was it Henry?
Was it his wife Sarah?

24
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:37,848
Or was it some other
who was yet to be revealed to me?

25
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:42,628
Sarah?

26
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,529
See? She's out still.

27
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,046
Come upstairs.

28
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:26,138
Come in.
Let me get you a drink.

29
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:28,801
Whiskey, thank you.

30
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:30,309
Whiskey.

31
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,180
So what's troubling you,
Henry?

32
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,157
Sarah.

33
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:59,933
She's out for a walk now,
Bendrix.

34
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:06,436
A walk.

35
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,278
Well, she always was
a great walker.

36
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:26,292
Jealousy's a terrible thing.

37
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:29,965
Well, you know you
can trust me, Henry.

38
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:35,906
You know, I went so far...

39
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:38,912
as to get the name
of a private detective.

40
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:44,483
You think she's seeing someone?

41
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,679
- Of course you think me a fool.
- No, Henry.

42
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:50,150
I don't think you're a fool.

43
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,827
- You mean you think it's possible?
- Of course.

44
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,022
Sarah's human.

45
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,633
Can't sleep.

46
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,429
Keep picking up...

47
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:09,237
this wretched card.

48
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,771
Burn it.

49
00:06:12,847 --> 00:06:16,146
- I wish I could.
- Then go see what's-his-name, Savage?

50
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:19,015
And sit where all
the jealous husbands sit?

51
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,254
Do you think they have
a waiting room, Bendrix...

52
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:26,020
where we see each other's faces
as we pass through?

53
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:27,993
Why not let me go, Henry?

54
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:31,221
- You?
- Yes.

55
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:34,564
I could pretend
to be a jealous lover.

56
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:37,968
Jealous lovers are less ridiculous
than jealous husbands.

57
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,530
They're supported
by the weight of literature.

58
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,873
Tragic, never comic.
Think of Troilus.

59
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:48,348
Well, I shan't lose my amour propre
when I interview Mr. Savage.

60
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:50,809
This is ridiculous.

61
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:52,819
One can't spy on one's wife
through a friend...

62
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:54,821
and have the friend
pretend to be her lover.

63
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:58,222
- What else are friends for?
- You're a good chap, Bendrix.

64
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,453
All I needed was to talk,
clear my head.

65
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:03,588
The name was Savage,
and the address was 3 Vigo Passage.

66
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:06,599
Forget what I've told you.
Doesn't make sense. I'll see a doctor.

67
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,237
That was the door.
Sarah's come in.

68
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:15,273
It's the maid.
She's been to the pictures.

69
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:17,573
No, it was Sarah's step.

70
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:23,243
Sarah, darling.

71
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,683
Henry.

72
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:29,452
- You... Is that you?
- Been out for a walk?

73
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:32,083
- Yes.
- It's a filthy night.

74
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:35,424
You're wet through, Sarah.
One day you'll catch your death of cold.

75
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:38,898
Good night.

76
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:46,532
Their marriage was conventional...

77
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:48,802
like their well-appointed house.

78
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:52,039
And I liked them both
the first night we met...

79
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:56,209
drinking bad South African sherry
because of the war in Spain.

80
00:07:57,451 --> 00:07:58,941
Good evening, sir.

81
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,954
- May I take your hat?
- Thank you.

82
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,956
Mr. Miles is upstairs.

83
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:11,628
Sherry, sir?

84
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,223
Thank you.

85
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,234
She seemed restless.

86
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:19,365
In the summer of 1939...

87
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,308
the whole of London was restless
in the face of the coming storm.

88
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,483
How nice of you to come.

89
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:43,657
Sarah, this is our neighbor,
the novelist chap.

90
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,756
What on earth
is a novelist doing here?

91
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:46,993
- Research.
- On what?

92
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,433
On your husband.

93
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:52,165
I'm trying to write a character
who works for the Ministry of Pensions.

94
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,969
I need to find out his habits,
what he drinks before bedtime.

95
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,634
- Cocoa.
- And when.

96
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,974
11:00, isn't it, Sarah?
Unless we're entertaining.

97
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,911
Would you be so kind
as to excuse your character?

98
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:05,508
- The ministry needs him.
- Unfortunately it does.

99
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,979
- So tell me.
- What?

100
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:11,422
- His secrets.
- Henry's a good man.

101
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:13,858
- Good men have no secrets.
- I was afraid you'd say that.

102
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,863
You see, goodness
has so little fictional value.

103
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,626
What does have fictional value?

104
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:22,191
- A minister of Home Security.
- Are you saying my husband is fiction?

105
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:25,067
I'm saying he could be,
in the right hands.

106
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:27,505
Oh, dear. This is alarming.
Can we get away from the service?

107
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:31,341
- You mean change the subject?
- I meant fresh air actually.

108
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:32,504
Of course.

109
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:37,407
- So how long have you been married?
- Is your character married?

110
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:40,215
Yes, he's been married happily
for ten years.

111
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:43,222
Henry's the perfect model then.
We've been married ten years.

112
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,416
You know that...

113
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:47,359
happiness is even harder to write
than goodness.

114
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:50,488
Henry prefers habit to happiness.

115
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:57,360
- I'll give them to you to sign.
- We were discussing the house, darling.

116
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,164
Let me fill that for you.

117
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:03,676
- It's a lovely house.
- My wife found it.

118
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:05,678
And your wife is charming.

119
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:08,078
- She's a great help to me.
- Yes, I'm sure.

120
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,743
They've made a picture
of one of your books, haven't they?

121
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,981
Yes, it's playing at the Rialto.

122
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:17,251
- I'll take you both.
- Far too busy for pictures, I'm afraid.

123
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:18,916
Should I make a note of that?

124
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,154
Make sure your character
never gets home before 10:00.

125
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:23,958
- Come out, Henry, for once?
- You know I can't, darling.

126
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:26,829
But you go.
Take her, Bendrix.

127
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:29,631
- Sarah, one has to insist.
- Henry.

128
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:32,501
- Where are you going?
- To see wonder.

129
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:35,838
- But you promised.
- Murderer's promises keep.

130
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:43,942
- It's not what I wrote, you know.
- You can't keep saying that.

131
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,612
- It's true.
- I know.

132
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,598
There was one scene you did write.

133
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,157
Describe it.

134
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:03,726
Where he offered her onions
with her meal.

135
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:06,796
She refused because her husband
didn't like the smell.

136
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,637
He got angry.

137
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,179
And why did he get angry?

138
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:18,312
He didn't want to think of her
going home to him.

139
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,284
Does Henry like onions?

140
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:29,728
No.

141
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,022
I'm in love, you know.

142
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,192
Me too.

143
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:08,867
Susan?

144
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:11,921
Come upstairs.

145
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,172
Sarah?

146
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:09,815
One minute, dear.

147
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:15,048
What if he heard?

148
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,352
He wouldn't recognize the sound.

149
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,705
- Sarah, you been eating onions?
- Sorry, darling.

150
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:38,010
So, Bendrix,
how was the picture?

151
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:40,012
Up to scratch?

152
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:46,046
Of course, as she began to love me...

153
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,986
she learned to deceive Henry.

154
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:53,254
So why was I upset to find
that two years later...

155
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,091
she was deceiving him again?

156
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:10,475
Mr. Bendrix, I assume we
are discussing Mrs. Bendrix.

157
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:14,275
Not exactly. She's the wife
of a friend of mine.

158
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,283
Perhaps you and the lady
are intimate?

159
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,784
No.

160
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,083
I've only seen her once
since 1944.

161
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:24,180
I don't understand.

162
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,453
You said this was a watching case.

163
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,561
Can't one love or hate
as long as that?

164
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:37,437
There's nothing discreditable
about jealousy, Mr. Bendrix.

165
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:41,032
I always salute it
as the mark of true love.

166
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:44,839
I've come on behalf of the husband.
He thinks she's deceiving him.

167
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:48,609
- She has secrets.
- Ah, secrets.

168
00:16:48,682 --> 00:16:51,981
- Yes.
- There may be nothing in it, of course.

169
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,543
In my experience, Mr. Bendrix...

170
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:56,919
there almost invariably is.

171
00:16:58,258 --> 00:17:00,192
Shall my man report to you
or the husband?

172
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,352
To me.

173
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:03,658
He must know nothing about it.

174
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,334
Most interesting case.

175
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:13,496
All my men use great discretion.
I will put one on it immediately.

176
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:17,704
And he will do his damndest
to put your mind at rest.

177
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,614
Or should I say the husband's?

178
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:43,869
Hello?

179
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,703
Good.
Yes, it was good to see you.

180
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:52,645
Yes, how long has it been?
Two years.

181
00:17:52,713 --> 00:17:54,647
As long as that?

182
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:57,377
Well, you were always better
at anniversaries than me.

183
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:01,552
You want to meet?
Well, whatever for?

184
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:06,383
Not tomorrow, no.
I've got this article.

185
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,225
Wednesday? Let me check.

186
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:17,436
Would Thursday do?

187
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:21,230
Good.
The Park Lane Hotel at 1:00?

188
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:39,988
It was odd to think
that during the war...

189
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,029
we could be so totally at peace.

190
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:45,792
There were nights
when I wished those sirens...

191
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:47,800
would never end.

192
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,830
Tell me again.

193
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,924
I love you.

194
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:25,930
And I always will.

195
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:46,584
I'm sorry I'm late.
I came by tube, but it was crowded.

196
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,594
Well, taxi is quicker.

197
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:51,153
I know.
Didn't want to be quick.

198
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,367
I booked a table at Palmer's.

199
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,672
Can't we stay here?

200
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,974
Well, it's where
we always used to go.

201
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:08,344
You see,
I've never been back there.

202
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,509
Well, it was never
your restaurant, was it?

203
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,520
- So you still go there?
- Yeah, two or three times a week.

204
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,522
It's convenient.

205
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:19,257
Let's go.

206
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,031
Thank you. Thanks.

207
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,535
- Sorry about that.
- That's quite all right, sir.

208
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,400
Got my hand caught in the way.

209
00:20:51,658 --> 00:20:54,183
Such a pleasure to see you, sir.

210
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:56,923
It's been so long,
I thought you'd forgotten us.

211
00:20:56,997 --> 00:20:59,830
- I was afraid you'd say that.
- And you, ma'am.

212
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,063
- It's been a long time too.
- Two years, Alfred.

213
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,374
- There.
- Thank you.

214
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,123
Why did you lie?

215
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:27,058
- About my coming here?
- Yes.

216
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:29,595
Why did you want to meet?

217
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,733
I wanted to ask you about Henry.

218
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:36,234
Henry.

219
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:39,898
I'm worried about him.

220
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:42,271
How did you find him
the other night?

221
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,277
- Was he strange at all?
- I didn't notice anything wrong.

222
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,546
I wanted to ask you...
I know you're very busy...

223
00:21:50,617 --> 00:21:52,915
whether you could
look him up occasionally.

224
00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:55,045
I think he's lonely.

225
00:21:55,121 --> 00:21:57,112
With you?

226
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,420
You know he's
never really noticed me...

227
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:01,426
not for years.

228
00:22:02,796 --> 00:22:05,458
Maybe you've given him reason.

229
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,793
What reason could I give?

230
00:22:12,472 --> 00:22:15,134
What reason did you give me?

231
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,512
None.

232
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:25,785
- Are you on a new book?
- Of course.

233
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:28,787
It's not about us, is it?
The one you threatened to write.

234
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:32,655
A book takes a year to write.
It's too hard work for revenge.

235
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,990
If you knew how little
you had to revenge.

236
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:38,724
I'm joking.
Yeah, we had a good time together.

237
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,063
We're adults, and we knew
it had to end sometime.

238
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:45,662
And now we can lunch
and talk about Henry.

239
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:56,540
I'm sorry.

240
00:22:56,616 --> 00:23:00,177
This was stupid,
and I really shouldn't have called.

241
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,483
That cough needs attending to.

242
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:05,115
It's only a cough.

243
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:06,818
Good-bye, Maurice.

244
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:08,326
Good-bye.

245
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:16,859
- Your menu, sir.
- Thank you.

246
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:26,009
I'm sorry, but you have to realize
I'm jealous of everything that moves.

247
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:29,708
- I'm jealous of the rain.
- How can you be jealous of the rain?

248
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:50,803
Where did you get it?

249
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,497
Spain.

250
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:55,006
That was my war, I'm afraid.

251
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:57,168
It finished me off for this one.

252
00:23:57,243 --> 00:24:00,212
You were shot. How romantic.

253
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,875
Not really.
They put a pin inside me.

254
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,647
I wondered about the limp.
Could I grow to love it?

255
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:09,882
And have you?

256
00:24:09,956 --> 00:24:13,756
I have never, ever loved anyone
as much as you.

257
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:36,539
Yes?

258
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,448
A Mr. Parkis to see you, sir.

259
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,283
Show him in.

260
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,289
This way, please.

261
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:52,128
- I'll be with you in a minute, Mr...
- The name's Parkis.

262
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:55,928
Mr. Savage's man.

263
00:24:56,002 --> 00:24:58,994
Sit down.
Take a cigarette.

264
00:24:59,072 --> 00:25:01,267
Oh, no, sir.
Not on duty, sir.

265
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:03,400
Unless, of course,
for purposes of concealment.

266
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:05,410
But you're not on duty now.

267
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:07,810
Well, in a manner of speaking,
yes, sir.

268
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,146
I've just been relieved for half an hour
while I make my report.

269
00:25:12,652 --> 00:25:15,644
So there's something to report?

270
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,747
It's not quite a blank sheet, sir.

271
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:22,627
Have me met
somewhere before, sir?

272
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,355
I don't think so.

273
00:25:30,703 --> 00:25:33,900
Well, like I say, sir...

274
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:36,134
it's not quite a blank sheet.

275
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:38,143
But then it never is.

276
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,580
Me and my boy,
we followed the...

277
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,641
Your boy?

278
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:48,380
My son, sir.

279
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:51,822
Yeah, I'm teaching him
the business.

280
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:55,019
I mean, a boy can be useful
in all sorts of ways.

281
00:25:56,129 --> 00:25:59,997
On the day in question, the party in
question went by tube to Piccadilly...

282
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:03,633
and proceeded
to the Park Lane Hotel.

283
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:06,194
She seemed quite agitated.

284
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,405
And there met a gentleman with whom
she was obviously quite close...

285
00:26:10,477 --> 00:26:14,675
since they greeted each other
with an affectionate lack of ceremony...

286
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:16,339
and at one point...

287
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:19,977
although I cannot be certain of this...
held hands along the bar.

288
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:24,120
- They held hands?
- Yes, sir.

289
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,590
Gentleman pushed the lady's glass
towards her...

290
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:27,751
and...

291
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:30,421
the hand sort of stayed there...

292
00:26:30,497 --> 00:26:32,089
for some time.

293
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:34,395
Which generally indicates
a squeeze of that nature.

294
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,897
After a short conversation,
they proceeded to a restaurant...

295
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,565
called...

296
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,165
Palmer's...

297
00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:46,371
which was difficult to gain access to,
me being with the boy and all.

298
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:48,380
But I observed them
through the window.

299
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:52,409
And after a while,
the lady left...

300
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,045
laboring...
well, it seemed to me...

301
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:57,248
under great emotion.

302
00:26:57,323 --> 00:27:00,224
Great emotion.
You're sure of that?

303
00:27:00,293 --> 00:27:02,227
Oh, without doubt, sir.

304
00:27:02,295 --> 00:27:05,389
Then I followed her down
Charing Cross Road to Maiden Lane...

305
00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:09,765
where she turned into a church for what
I can only presume was a good cry.

306
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:13,606
She's not a Roman, is she, sir?

307
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,106
No.

308
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,699
Thought not.

309
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:19,540
She didn't kneel, sir,
but sat.

310
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:22,172
From the angle of her face,
I could tell...

311
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:24,682
tears were an issue.

312
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:27,686
- Forgive the personal touch.
- Of course.

313
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:33,084
You see, I liked the lady.
The party in question.

314
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:36,253
As did I, but you were wrong
about the hands.

315
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:38,627
The hands, sir?

316
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,462
We never so much as touched hands.

317
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,662
Oh, dear.

318
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:48,366
- I have made a fool of myself.
- Sarah has that effect.

319
00:27:48,441 --> 00:27:51,706
Mr. Savage
should have introduced us.

320
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:54,042
Oh, no, sir.

321
00:27:54,113 --> 00:27:57,105
- It was up to me.
- Well, it's not serious.

322
00:27:57,183 --> 00:28:00,710
If you look at it from the outside,
it's quite funny.

323
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:02,982
But I'm on the inside, sir.

324
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,751
It's not Mr. Savage I'm worried about
so much. It's my boy, sir.

325
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:13,188
- When I tell him you're the husband...
- But you're wrong.

326
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:15,598
I'm acting on the husband's behalf.

327
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:18,501
So you've requested
an investigation yourself?

328
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,005
That's an interesting paradox.

329
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,167
But who's the wronged party then,
sir, if you'll forgive?

330
00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:28,205
Pardon me, sir.

331
00:28:29,816 --> 00:28:32,307
I am slow in such matters.

332
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:35,877
Both you and the husband have been
supplanted in the lady's affections by...

333
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:37,388
Another?

334
00:28:39,492 --> 00:28:42,188
Try to think of it
the way I do, Mr. Parkis.

335
00:28:44,197 --> 00:28:47,132
Jealousy can only exist
with desire.

336
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:51,398
You are on a hunt for desire.

337
00:28:51,471 --> 00:28:54,031
Just regard yourself
as its servant.

338
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:58,037
Of course, sir.
That's my job.

339
00:28:58,878 --> 00:29:00,311
Thank you.

340
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,058
The vicarious lover, Parkis.

341
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,627
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

342
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:28,272
I wondered how much of her
he could reclaim for me.

343
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:32,442
And, for a moment,
I wished I was him...

344
00:29:32,512 --> 00:29:35,538
shining his searchlight
around her world.

345
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:45,019
I am a jealous man.

346
00:29:58,504 --> 00:30:01,735
- I'm jealous of this stocking.
- Why?

347
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:04,003
'Cause it does what I can't.

348
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:07,045
It kisses your whole leg.

349
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:13,610
And I'm jealous of this button.

350
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:17,144
- Poor, innocent button.
- It's not innocent at all.

351
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:21,925
It's with you all day,
and I'm not.

352
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:30,600
- I suppose you're jealous of my shoes.
- Yes.

353
00:30:31,671 --> 00:30:33,263
Why?

354
00:30:34,741 --> 00:30:36,766
Because they'll
take you away from me.

355
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,177
I measured love
by the extent of my jealousy.

356
00:30:42,248 --> 00:30:44,011
And as my jealousy was infinite...

357
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,017
Anyone who loves is jealous.

358
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:48,315
My love should have
been infinite too.

359
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,620
I hate you being unhappy. I don't mind
anything you do that makes you happy.

360
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:54,990
- If I slept with someone else?
- That's neither here nor there.

361
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,995
I want you to be happy,
that's all.

362
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,997
Maybe you'd want an excuse
to do the same.

363
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,226
- I never would.
- But you do.

364
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,292
- Do what?
- Sleep with someone else.

365
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,339
You mean Henry?
How can anyone be jealous of Henry?

366
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,103
He has you. I don't.

367
00:31:10,176 --> 00:31:12,110
We inhabit the same house.

368
00:31:12,178 --> 00:31:15,978
That's all. You know that.
I'm the shadow he walks around.

369
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:17,845
And I love you.

370
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,852
I would rather be dead or see you dead
than with another man.

371
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,117
I will never, ever be
with another man.

372
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,217
You may see me dead,
but I will never be with another man.

373
00:31:28,294 --> 00:31:30,694
- We should go down to the shelter.
- Stay here, Sarah.

374
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,697
If a bomb hit us now,
think of what wouldn't happen.

375
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,996
- What wouldn't happen?
- You wouldn't go back to Henry.

376
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:38,002
I would never imagine
another lover.

377
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,369
- My jealousy would end.
- Would that make you happy?

378
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,233
Do you believe me now?

379
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:25,200
But sadly, I didn't believe her.

380
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:27,974
There was a devil in my mind
that would never let me.

381
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,484
And now I had Parkis' boy
playing the devil's game.

382
00:35:13,452 --> 00:35:14,544
My boy managed to gain access, sir.

383
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:19,482
Remarkably useful he can be.
I call that Exhibit "A."

384
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:24,461
They say a promise is forever,
but I don't know if I can keep this one.

385
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,795
He killed me with jealousy.
You're killing me with love.

386
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:31,132
So he's got the scent too,
Parkis.

387
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:33,569
- What scent?
- The scent of love.

388
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:36,665
Stalking it like a retriever.

389
00:35:36,742 --> 00:35:39,836
Well, he's
remarkably persistent, sir.

390
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:43,746
He observed the party in question,
then in a state of partial undress...

391
00:35:43,816 --> 00:35:46,216
with an unidentified male.

392
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:48,753
- Where?
- In the bedroom, sir.

393
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:51,813
The male party then closed the door,
and my boy made his exit.

394
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:55,122
The implications, and I think
you would agree, is that...

395
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,492
intimacy was...

396
00:35:58,431 --> 00:35:59,989
imminent.

397
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:02,227
Indeed. Who is he?

398
00:36:02,301 --> 00:36:04,633
Here, sir, is where progress
was definitely made.

399
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:08,737
As my boy left, he glanced at the
appointment book in the front hallway.

400
00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:13,245
The party in question had a dental
appointment at 3::30 the following day.

401
00:36:13,312 --> 00:36:15,780
In fact, she visited at 3::30...

402
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:20,012
a premises on 65 Cedar Road
where no dentist sign was in evidence.

403
00:36:39,638 --> 00:36:41,799
A Mr. Smythe owns the premises, sir.

404
00:36:41,874 --> 00:36:44,707
Smythe, with a "Y"?

405
00:36:44,777 --> 00:36:47,940
Yes, sir. S-M-Y-T-H-E.

406
00:36:49,048 --> 00:36:51,312
And...

407
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:52,816
no...

408
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:58,455
Though we have no evidence
of intimacy...

409
00:36:58,524 --> 00:37:00,583
the implication is clearly there.

410
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:02,593
How is it there?

411
00:37:02,661 --> 00:37:04,720
Why the fictitious
dental appointment, sir?

412
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:09,293
Exhibit "B."

413
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:11,302
My boy took that.

414
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:16,340
The party in question emerged
two hours later.

415
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:19,673
Passage of time being
amply sufficient for...

416
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:21,406
intimacy to have taken place.

417
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:24,972
The courts generally demand
at least an hour, sir.

418
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:29,747
Now, my boy would have provided us
with photos of her reemergence...

419
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:32,757
but for the unfortunate
occurrence of him...

420
00:37:32,825 --> 00:37:34,258
falling asleep.

421
00:37:39,532 --> 00:37:42,023
Luckily, sir,
the party in question...

422
00:37:42,101 --> 00:37:44,569
mistook him
for an abandoned urchin...

423
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,628
woke him up and led him
to the nearest tube station...

424
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:49,868
so that the time of reemergence
is definitely established...

425
00:37:49,942 --> 00:37:53,673
as was an acquaintance which may have
its uses in the future, for all we know.

426
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,582
So should I walk in and confront him
like an injured husband?

427
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,245
I'm against it, sir.
It complicates things in the courts.

428
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,254
This will never reach court.

429
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,450
- An amicable settlement then.
- There's lack of interest.

430
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:09,892
One can hardly make a fuss
about a man called Smythe.

431
00:38:09,962 --> 00:38:12,863
I'd just like to see him,
that's all.

432
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:16,265
Well, perhaps Lance can oblige us
next time with a frontal.

433
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,269
- Lance?
- My boy.

434
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:21,130
Called after Lancelot,
the Round Table.

435
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:23,675
He found the Holy Grail.

436
00:38:23,742 --> 00:38:27,371
That was Galahad. Lancelot
was found in bed with Guinevere.

437
00:38:30,082 --> 00:38:32,016
I hadn't heard.

438
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:48,798
I have to say, sir,
I would advise against it.

439
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:53,464
I'd just like to see
what a man called Smythe looks like.

440
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,531
Will you lend me your boy?

441
00:38:56,609 --> 00:39:00,443
Well, if you'll assure me
there'll be nothing unpleasant.

442
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:04,346
Sarah isn't there. This scene
will have a universal certificate.

443
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:06,350
Come with me, young Lancelot.

444
00:39:07,686 --> 00:39:09,916
Go on, Lance.

445
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:12,287
No need to worry.

446
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:14,553
Now, you're feeling ill,
remember?

447
00:39:14,627 --> 00:39:17,391
- How ill, sir?
- Ill enough to faint.

448
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:19,397
Can you act that?

449
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:21,763
If I hold my breath
and go all pale, sir.

450
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:23,267
Good.

451
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:36,177
Excuse me, but does
a Dr. Wilson live here?

452
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,409
- No, I'm afraid he doesn't.
- Oh, dear.

453
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:41,612
See, I was given this address,
and my boy's quite ill.

454
00:39:41,687 --> 00:39:43,917
We've traveled all this...
You all right?

455
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:46,423
- You better come in.
- Would you mind? I'm sorry.

456
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:48,824
I think he needs
to sit down badly.

457
00:39:48,894 --> 00:39:50,327
Thank you.

458
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:58,228
- Can I fetch him a glass of water?
- That's very kind.

459
00:39:58,304 --> 00:40:00,499
Or some orange squash?

460
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:03,302
- Water will be fine.
- Orange squash, please.

461
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,605
Say thank you, Arthur.

462
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:09,114
- Is his name Arthur?
- Yes, Arthur James.

463
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:11,979
- His mother was fond of Tennyson.
- Is she...

464
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:14,747
Yes, yes. Four years now.

465
00:40:16,522 --> 00:40:19,514
- He must be of great comfort to you.
- And anxiety.

466
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:22,116
I ought to introduce myself.

467
00:40:22,194 --> 00:40:24,389
- Bridges.
- My name is Smythe.

468
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,497
- With a "Y"?
- Yes. This is my brother Richard.

469
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:27,556
- With a "Y"?
- Yes. This is my brother Richard.

470
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:31,225
This is Mr. Bridges.
His boy isn't feeling well.

471
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,897
I was given this address
for a Dr. Wilson.

472
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,770
There's no such doctor here.

473
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,072
I've seen your boy before.

474
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:44,206
Maybe on the common.

475
00:40:49,755 --> 00:40:53,191
What was the real purpose
of your visit?

476
00:40:55,728 --> 00:40:56,956
I told you. A doctor.

477
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:04,592
No, you're not ill,
are you, boy?

478
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:13,577
People sometimes come to me...

479
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:16,045
and can't explain why.

480
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:19,577
But if there is a reason...

481
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:21,585
- My brother often deals...
- Hush, Susan.

482
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,952
They must ask themselves.

483
00:41:29,228 --> 00:41:32,129
I recognize your boy,
but you...

484
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,057
- Who recommended you?
- We have a friend in common.

485
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,703
Sarah Miles.

486
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:43,941
And your name is?

487
00:41:44,009 --> 00:41:45,840
Bendrix.

488
00:41:52,618 --> 00:41:55,314
- I know all about you.
- I'm sure you do.

489
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,617
But you must enlighten me.

490
00:41:57,689 --> 00:42:01,489
- Aren't you bound by vows of chastity?
- Oh, my dear!

491
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,161
Go, please.

492
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,164
Would you just go?

493
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:10,326
Come along, Lancelot.

494
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:19,803
Poor Sarah.
She had committed nothing but love.

495
00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:23,245
And here were Parkis and his boy
watching her every move.

496
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:25,340
I would have called the spies off...

497
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,113
had the devil not tugged
at my elbow once more.

498
00:42:28,187 --> 00:42:30,348
Henry.

499
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,356
Still in the rain?

500
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,450
Walking, Bendrix.
Doctor recommends it.

501
00:42:35,527 --> 00:42:37,552
Well, walk with me.

502
00:42:37,629 --> 00:42:39,756
I recommend a drink.

503
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:54,912
How's Sarah?

504
00:42:56,081 --> 00:42:57,673
Pretty well.

505
00:42:57,749 --> 00:43:00,479
Did you ever consult
that private detective?

506
00:43:02,354 --> 00:43:04,345
I'd hoped you had forgotten that.

507
00:43:04,423 --> 00:43:06,755
I was overworked.

508
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:08,918
I had Royal Commission brewing.

509
00:43:08,994 --> 00:43:11,155
Don't worry, Henry.
I did it for you.

510
00:43:12,764 --> 00:43:15,562
- You had absolutely no right.
- I'm paying all the charges.

511
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,158
It's infernal cheek.

512
00:43:17,236 --> 00:43:19,932
Here's the report, Henry.

513
00:43:20,005 --> 00:43:22,235
His name is Smythe, with a "Y."

514
00:43:22,307 --> 00:43:24,502
You've been properly led up
the garden path, Henry.

515
00:43:25,344 --> 00:43:27,938
- Will you let me pass?
- You don't want them?

516
00:43:28,013 --> 00:43:29,537
Photographs, names, love letters?

517
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,054
Now will you let me go?

518
00:43:44,897 --> 00:43:47,422
I can always get you
a carbon copy.

519
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,883
Strange how much dignity
there can be in a hat.

520
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:12,390
Without it, he seemed
one of the anonymous...

521
00:44:12,457 --> 00:44:13,890
the dispossessed.

522
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,894
I had pitied myself for so long,
it was odd...

523
00:44:18,964 --> 00:44:21,831
to pity him.

524
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,834
I'm sorry, Henry.

525
00:44:26,672 --> 00:44:28,105
Sit down.

526
00:44:39,284 --> 00:44:41,650
Were you two lovers, Bendrix?

527
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:48,485
It's the only explanation.

528
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,662
The only excuse too.

529
00:44:56,034 --> 00:44:58,730
Can't you see
that what you've done...

530
00:44:58,804 --> 00:45:00,931
is monstrous?

531
00:45:07,512 --> 00:45:10,447
You must think me a fool
not to have guessed.

532
00:45:15,454 --> 00:45:18,287
Why didn't she leave me?

533
00:45:18,357 --> 00:45:20,723
Because you're a habit
she's formed.

534
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:23,727
You're her security.

535
00:45:23,795 --> 00:45:26,491
- Why did she leave you?
- I became a bore.

536
00:45:26,565 --> 00:45:28,658
Like you.

537
00:45:28,734 --> 00:45:30,702
But I wasn't born one.

538
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,260
You created me.

539
00:45:33,338 --> 00:45:36,466
She wouldn't leave you,
so I bored her with my jealousy.

540
00:45:37,743 --> 00:45:40,678
- You can't be jealous of me.
- Well, you won, in a way.

541
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,843
We had come to the end of love.

542
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:47,851
She'd only make love with me,
but...

543
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:51,047
she could shop and cook
and fall asleep with you.

544
00:45:53,225 --> 00:45:55,557
She's still very fond of you.

545
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:58,755
One isn't satisfied with fondness.

546
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:02,195
- I was.
- Yes, and that made you her pimp.

547
00:46:03,835 --> 00:46:06,326
The bore of a husband
who knows where his slippers are...

548
00:46:06,405 --> 00:46:08,999
but never notices his wife.

549
00:46:09,074 --> 00:46:11,065
But you weren't
the only pimp, Henry.

550
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,078
The war was
the greatest pimp of all.

551
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,547
And the V-1 s
never affected us until...

552
00:46:18,617 --> 00:46:20,915
the act of love was over.

553
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:53,809
So what will you do when it ends?

554
00:46:53,885 --> 00:46:55,819
It won't end. I told you.

555
00:46:55,887 --> 00:46:57,821
I meant the war.

556
00:46:59,157 --> 00:47:01,955
It's the only certain thing.

557
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,961
What do you mean?

558
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,361
That allows me to see you.

559
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:09,634
You think love ends...

560
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,828
when you don't see me?

561
00:47:14,306 --> 00:47:16,638
To be is to be perceived.

562
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,071
Do I exist for you
when you're with Henry?

563
00:47:20,145 --> 00:47:22,272
Yes.

564
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:25,043
Isn't that why you stay
with Henry?

565
00:47:25,117 --> 00:47:27,278
Because you know this will end?

566
00:47:27,352 --> 00:47:29,650
No.

567
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,154
- We should go to the basement.
- My landlady might be there.

568
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,750
- Does that matter?
- Maybe to her.

569
00:47:35,827 --> 00:47:38,091
- It's close, Maurice.
- I'll go and check.

570
00:47:38,163 --> 00:47:41,064
- Let me go with you.
- I'll be one second.

571
00:47:46,671 --> 00:47:48,104
Hello?

572
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,438
There's nobody there.
It's clear.

573
00:48:45,997 --> 00:48:47,931
I never heard the bang.

574
00:48:49,334 --> 00:48:52,030
I awoke after five minutes...

575
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:54,663
or five seconds...

576
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,901
to a changed world.

577
00:49:02,914 --> 00:49:06,247
For a moment,
I was free of feeling...

578
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,413
Love, hate, jealousy.

579
00:49:12,023 --> 00:49:15,083
And it all felt like happiness.

580
00:50:25,463 --> 00:50:27,397
Oh, my God.

581
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,834
You're alive?

582
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,341
You sound disappointed.

583
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,172
You're hurt.

584
00:50:43,815 --> 00:50:46,340
I just cut myself, that's all.

585
00:50:58,129 --> 00:51:00,859
What were you doing
on the floor?

586
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:03,500
Praying.

587
00:51:04,569 --> 00:51:06,127
To what?

588
00:51:06,204 --> 00:51:08,399
To anything that might exist.

589
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:14,137
Well, it'd have been more practical
to have come downstairs.

590
00:51:14,212 --> 00:51:16,043
I did.

591
00:51:20,485 --> 00:51:23,784
Well, why didn't you wake me?

592
00:51:23,855 --> 00:51:25,550
I tried.

593
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,558
You didn't move.

594
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,186
I don't understand.

595
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:35,695
I knew for certain
you were dead.

596
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:37,894
There wasn't much
to pray for then, was there?

597
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,164
A miracle.

598
00:51:42,407 --> 00:51:45,934
And we don't believe in those.

599
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:47,103
No.

600
00:51:49,614 --> 00:51:52,515
And that siren means you go.

601
00:51:55,587 --> 00:51:57,111
Yes.

602
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:04,394
Please don't.

603
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:08,129
I have to. Henry will...

604
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:09,860
Forget Henry.

605
00:52:11,703 --> 00:52:13,637
You don't understand.
You were gone.

606
00:52:13,705 --> 00:52:15,104
Now I'm back.

607
00:52:16,641 --> 00:52:19,769
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
Sarah, but...

608
00:52:23,948 --> 00:52:26,678
Love doesn't end...

609
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,049
just because
we don't see each other.

610
00:52:29,921 --> 00:52:31,548
Doesn't it?

611
00:52:31,623 --> 00:52:33,818
People go on loving God,
don't they?

612
00:52:33,892 --> 00:52:36,224
All their lives.

613
00:52:36,294 --> 00:52:38,421
Without seeing Him.

614
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,965
That's not my kind of love.

615
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,729
Maybe there's no other kind.

616
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,648
So I was a disappointment
in the end.

617
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,779
I lived.

618
00:53:03,855 --> 00:53:06,050
And that was the end
of the affair...

619
00:53:06,124 --> 00:53:08,854
until I met you with that
detective's card in your hand.

620
00:53:10,762 --> 00:53:12,753
I wondered why
we hadn't seen you.

621
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:19,159
You should go home, Henry.
You'll catch your death.

622
00:53:23,308 --> 00:53:24,741
I'm sorry.

623
00:53:36,488 --> 00:53:37,921
Hello.

624
00:53:46,931 --> 00:53:49,559
It was quite easy, sir.
It was such a crush.

625
00:53:49,634 --> 00:53:52,899
And Mrs. Miles thought I was one
of his friends from the ministry.

626
00:53:52,971 --> 00:53:55,439
And Mr. Miles thought
I was one of her friends.

627
00:53:56,641 --> 00:53:59,667
Well, I knew the way
to her room from my boy.

628
00:53:59,744 --> 00:54:02,770
Anybody would have stopped me, I would
have been looking for the toilet.

629
00:54:02,847 --> 00:54:04,337
Of course, nobody did.

630
00:54:04,415 --> 00:54:07,213
Did you think it was
a good cocktail party?

631
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,651
Highly successful
I would say, sir.

632
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:13,418
But Mrs. Miles
looked a bit out of sorts.

633
00:54:13,491 --> 00:54:17,655
I refer to this as Exhibit "D."

634
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:31,875
Did you look at it?

635
00:54:31,943 --> 00:54:34,241
I ascertained its nature, sir.

636
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,712
And from one entry, judged
she wasn't the cautious type.

637
00:54:36,781 --> 00:54:39,147
So happy. M returns today.

638
00:54:39,217 --> 00:54:42,186
My experience of diaries
is they always give things away, sir.

639
00:54:43,721 --> 00:54:46,622
People invent their little codes.
You soon see through them, sir.

640
00:54:46,691 --> 00:54:48,921
I woke up and
the sun was shining.

641
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:51,518
This covers several years.

642
00:54:51,596 --> 00:54:53,530
I hope you're satisfied, sir.

643
00:54:53,598 --> 00:54:57,261
Life was going to be happy again.
But last night I dreamt...

644
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:00,634
I think this may well
close our account, Parkis.

645
00:55:00,705 --> 00:55:03,902
Yeah. I had a feeling
it might, sir.

646
00:55:04,709 --> 00:55:07,303
I have enjoyed
our association, sir...

647
00:55:07,378 --> 00:55:10,905
if one can talk of enjoying
under the sad circumstances.

648
00:55:10,982 --> 00:55:12,813
As have I.

649
00:55:12,884 --> 00:55:16,251
So I hope you wouldn't
resent a memento, sir.

650
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:23,251
There's quite a history
with that.

651
00:55:24,395 --> 00:55:27,626
- Do you remember the Bolton case?
- I can't say I do.

652
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,167
It caused quite
a stir at the time, sir.

653
00:55:30,235 --> 00:55:32,829
Lady Bolton,
her maid and a man.

654
00:55:32,904 --> 00:55:34,963
All discovered together.

655
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:37,564
That ashtray stood
beside the bed, sir.

656
00:55:37,642 --> 00:55:39,610
On the lady's side.

657
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:46,077
Well, I shall treasure it, Parkis.

658
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,411
If ashtrays could speak, sir.

659
00:55:50,488 --> 00:55:51,921
Indeed.

660
00:55:55,426 --> 00:55:58,520
Perhaps I should call later, sir, just
to make sure there were no loose ends?

661
00:55:58,596 --> 00:56:00,530
Thank you, Parkis.

662
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,565
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

663
00:56:35,967 --> 00:56:40,267
Sometimes I get tired of trying
to convince him that I love him...

664
00:56:40,338 --> 00:56:42,465
and shall love him forever.

665
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,032
He pounces on my words
like a barrister and twists them.

666
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,044
So what will you do
when it ends?

667
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:51,604
You think love ends
when you don't see me?

668
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,443
To be is to be perceived.

669
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,920
Do I exist for you
when you're with Henry?

670
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:01,424
Yes.

671
00:57:02,593 --> 00:57:07,428
Isn't that why you stay with Henry?
Because you know this will end?

672
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:13,667
- We should go to the basement.
- My landlady might be there.

673
00:57:13,738 --> 00:57:15,171
- Does that matter?
- Maybe to her.

674
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:17,571
- It's close, Maurice.
- I'll go and check.

675
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,940
- Let me go with you.
- I'll be one second.

676
00:57:25,883 --> 00:57:27,316
Hello?

677
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,414
There's nobody there.
It's clear.

678
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,875
Oh, God!

679
00:58:07,558 --> 00:58:09,492
Oh, God. Oh, God.

680
00:58:21,506 --> 00:58:23,303
Oh, God, don't take him.

681
00:58:23,975 --> 00:58:25,943
But You had.

682
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,674
Whatever was him was gone.

683
00:58:31,749 --> 00:58:33,683
You'd taken it.

684
00:58:36,421 --> 00:58:38,981
I'd never believed in prayer.

685
00:58:42,026 --> 00:58:46,019
Oh, God, please bring him back.
Let him live.

686
00:58:46,097 --> 00:58:49,498
I don't believe in You,
but please let him live.

687
00:58:52,103 --> 00:58:54,469
Dear God, please.

688
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,098
Let him...

689
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:15,188
Dear God, please. Let him live.

690
00:59:18,663 --> 00:59:21,223
Please bring him back.

691
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,564
Please don't take him.

692
00:59:27,238 --> 00:59:29,331
I'll give him up forever.

693
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:32,035
Only please, let him be alive.

694
00:59:33,344 --> 00:59:38,213
Let him live and I promise
I'll never see him again.

695
00:59:46,424 --> 00:59:47,686
Oh, my God.

696
00:59:50,528 --> 00:59:51,995
You're alive?

697
00:59:54,398 --> 00:59:57,265
You sound disappointed.

698
00:59:57,335 --> 01:00:01,169
But if he was alive,
now I was dead.

699
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:12,579
What were you doing on the floor?

700
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:16,517
Praying.

701
01:00:16,587 --> 01:00:18,350
To what?

702
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:20,390
To anything that might exist.

703
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:24,656
How could I explain to him
what made no sense to me?

704
01:00:24,729 --> 01:00:26,390
You didn't move.

705
01:00:26,464 --> 01:00:30,127
I knew for certain you were dead.

706
01:00:30,201 --> 01:00:32,260
Then there wasn't much
to pray for then, was there?

707
01:00:32,336 --> 01:00:33,769
A miracle.

708
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,236
And we don't believe in that.

709
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,106
And that siren means you go.

710
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,451
Yes.

711
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:54,648
And I knew that nothing in this world
would make sense to me again.

712
01:00:55,726 --> 01:00:57,057
Sorry to disappoint you.

713
01:01:02,066 --> 01:01:04,728
Love doesn't end...

714
01:01:04,802 --> 01:01:06,736
just because we don't
see each other.

715
01:01:07,772 --> 01:01:09,262
Doesn't it?

716
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,570
People go on loving God,
don't they...

717
01:01:11,642 --> 01:01:15,544
all their lives
without seeing Him?

718
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:18,673
That's not my kind of love.

719
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,144
Maybe there's no other kind.

720
01:01:42,373 --> 01:01:45,570
I can't be held to that promise.

721
01:01:45,643 --> 01:01:48,476
But something told me I would be.

722
01:01:48,546 --> 01:01:50,480
I had tempted fate...

723
01:01:50,548 --> 01:01:52,709
and fate had accepted.

724
01:01:53,951 --> 01:01:58,854
So I was in the desert now,
the desert without him.

725
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:05,395
I started a tour with Henry,
civil defense in southern England.

726
01:02:06,364 --> 01:02:10,300
Henry and I sleeping side by side
like figures on tombs.

727
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:16,533
In the new reinforced shelter
at Bigwell-on-Sea...

728
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:19,303
a chief warden kissed me.

729
01:02:19,377 --> 01:02:22,813
I allowed him to
but felt nothing.

730
01:02:24,248 --> 01:02:27,115
I'm beginning to believe
in You, God...

731
01:02:27,184 --> 01:02:29,914
and maybe that's how You work.

732
01:02:29,987 --> 01:02:33,821
You empty me of love,
then fill that emptiness.

733
01:02:33,891 --> 01:02:36,018
They're recommending me
for an O.B.E.

734
01:02:36,093 --> 01:02:37,788
What's that?

735
01:02:37,862 --> 01:02:40,330
A step below a C.B.E.

736
01:02:40,398 --> 01:02:43,925
When I retire,
I'll probably be a K.B.E.

737
01:02:44,001 --> 01:02:47,459
It's confusing. Couldn't
they stick to the same letters?

738
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:51,173
Wouldn't you like to be Lady Miles?

739
01:02:54,779 --> 01:02:57,873
This was the British people's
finest day...

740
01:02:57,948 --> 01:03:01,543
V-E day,
the end of the German war.

741
01:03:04,522 --> 01:03:07,082
A man we seem to have
seen before somewhere...

742
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,752
Looks down
from a balcony in Whitehall.

743
01:03:21,706 --> 01:03:25,005
The whole of London seemed happy
because there was peace...

744
01:03:25,076 --> 01:03:27,067
and there were no more bombs.

745
01:03:27,144 --> 01:03:29,772
But I'm not sure
I like the peace.

746
01:03:38,522 --> 01:03:40,581
I walked his walks.

747
01:03:43,427 --> 01:03:46,021
Tried to think where he'd be.

748
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,136
Then I gave up.

749
01:03:54,672 --> 01:03:57,470
I thought that now
the world is at peace...

750
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:59,941
maybe I should have some.

751
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:14,783
I told him it all.

752
01:04:14,859 --> 01:04:19,592
And Whoever heard my promise
must have heard it too...

753
01:04:19,663 --> 01:04:22,325
and must have known it already...

754
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,198
since God knows everything.

755
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:31,068
How cruel that knowledge seemed.

756
01:04:31,142 --> 01:04:34,305
It knew what I would say
before I made that promise.

757
01:04:35,946 --> 01:04:39,143
Knew it would keep me to it.

758
01:04:39,216 --> 01:04:41,810
Knew me the way
his hands knew me.

759
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,785
Sarah, darling.

760
01:04:47,558 --> 01:04:48,650
You.

761
01:04:48,726 --> 01:04:50,717
Knew I would meet him
on the stairs.

762
01:04:50,795 --> 01:04:52,729
- Been out for a walk?
- Yes.

763
01:04:52,797 --> 01:04:54,094
It's a filthy night.

764
01:04:54,165 --> 01:04:57,157
You're wet through. One day
you'll catch your death of cold.

765
01:04:57,234 --> 01:04:58,360
Good night.

766
01:04:59,303 --> 01:05:01,794
Knew he would hate me.

767
01:05:07,912 --> 01:05:10,278
- Wednesday.
- Wednesday. Let me check.

768
01:05:12,716 --> 01:05:15,150
- Would Thursday do?
- Thursday then.

769
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:17,653
The Park Lane Hotel at 1::00.

770
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:26,020
I took my time.
I didn't want to be early.

771
01:05:27,097 --> 01:05:29,156
Why did you want to meet?

772
01:05:29,233 --> 01:05:34,034
I wanted to tell you I'd been dead
for the last two years.

773
01:05:34,104 --> 01:05:37,130
I can't be without you any longer.

774
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:38,505
I think he's lonely.

775
01:05:38,576 --> 01:05:40,567
But, of course, I didn't.

776
01:05:40,644 --> 01:05:43,909
You know he's never really
noticed me, not for years.

777
01:05:46,417 --> 01:05:48,749
Maybe you've given him reason.

778
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:51,185
What reason could I give?

779
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:55,124
What reason did you give me?

780
01:06:00,197 --> 01:06:01,425
None.

781
01:06:11,775 --> 01:06:14,767
- Are you on a new book?
- Of course.

782
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:18,042
It's not about us, is it?
The one you threatened to write.

783
01:06:18,115 --> 01:06:19,878
A book takes a year to write.

784
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:21,884
It's too hard work for revenge.

785
01:06:22,987 --> 01:06:25,114
If you knew how little
you had to revenge...

786
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,885
No, I'm joking.
We had a good time together.

787
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,892
I mean, we're adults and...

788
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,952
we knew it had to end sometime.

789
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:36,158
And now we can lunch
and talk about Henry.

790
01:06:41,138 --> 01:06:44,335
In the old days,
he would have followed.

791
01:06:44,408 --> 01:06:48,071
We would have made up
or made love.

792
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:11,460
I said to God, as I might
have said to my father...

793
01:07:11,535 --> 01:07:14,163
"Dear God, I'm tired.

794
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:18,766
I'm tired of being without him.

795
01:07:18,842 --> 01:07:21,436
And it's all because of You."

796
01:07:23,714 --> 01:07:27,480
Dr. Gilbert's appointment.
I'd almost forgotten.

797
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:30,487
He asked me how I felt.

798
01:07:31,555 --> 01:07:34,251
I said I felt nothing.

799
01:07:34,325 --> 01:07:37,294
There was a stone
where my heart should be.

800
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,664
I need help, Father.

801
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,434
You know, Sarah,
God granted us free will.

802
01:07:45,502 --> 01:07:48,869
Good. So it's settled.
I'm leaving my husband.

803
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:53,000
- You can't.
- Why can't I? I'm a whore and a liar.

804
01:07:53,077 --> 01:07:55,443
I'm asking Henry for a divorce.

805
01:08:01,685 --> 01:08:03,846
You can't because you're good.

806
01:08:05,756 --> 01:08:08,554
Better than any person I know.

807
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:12,585
You're wrong, Father,
and you don't know me.

808
01:08:14,598 --> 01:08:17,829
I found a small boy
sleeping on the steps...

809
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:20,768
with a birthmark
covering his face...

810
01:08:20,838 --> 01:08:24,274
and wondered what kind of God
would give a child that.

811
01:08:24,341 --> 01:08:26,366
Are you lost?

812
01:08:26,443 --> 01:08:29,412
It's all right.
It's all right.

813
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,448
Where do you live then?

814
01:08:33,617 --> 01:08:35,744
- You'll be all right now?
- Yes, ma'am.

815
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:40,882
I kissed his cheek
and wished I could wash it away.

816
01:08:40,958 --> 01:08:42,892
And suddenly I felt happy again.

817
01:08:43,961 --> 01:08:45,895
I could free myself of this.

818
01:08:46,864 --> 01:08:49,594
I am...

819
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,498
leaving you.

820
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:56,596
For the last five years...

821
01:08:57,775 --> 01:09:00,767
I have been...

822
01:09:00,844 --> 01:09:02,778
in love...

823
01:09:02,846 --> 01:09:05,144
with Maurice.

824
01:09:05,215 --> 01:09:08,082
I love you.

825
01:09:08,152 --> 01:09:10,211
Do you know that?

826
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:17,920
Why now, Henry?

827
01:09:17,995 --> 01:09:19,929
Why do you say that now?

828
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,227
I had a drink with Bendrix.

829
01:09:31,642 --> 01:09:33,803
A horrible drink.

830
01:09:35,979 --> 01:09:38,140
I can't do without you.

831
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:41,616
Oh, yes, you can, I thought.

832
01:09:41,685 --> 01:09:45,587
You changed your newspaper once
and you soon got used to it.

833
01:09:45,656 --> 01:09:47,749
What's wrong, Henry?

834
01:09:47,825 --> 01:09:50,885
Did Bendrix upset you in some way?

835
01:09:53,831 --> 01:09:56,766
I know I haven't been much
of a husband to you, my dear.

836
01:09:56,834 --> 01:09:58,802
We are good friends.

837
01:10:00,337 --> 01:10:03,135
You can do without a friend.

838
01:10:04,341 --> 01:10:06,275
Don't leave me, Sarah.

839
01:10:08,846 --> 01:10:11,178
Stick it out a few more years.

840
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:15,544
I'll try. I promise.

841
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:24,420
Is this coincidence?
I wondered.

842
01:10:24,495 --> 01:10:27,293
Or the way life happens?

843
01:10:27,364 --> 01:10:32,097
And if this is life,
am I stuck with it?

844
01:10:32,169 --> 01:10:34,569
But whatever it is...

845
01:10:34,638 --> 01:10:36,629
I can't fight it anymore.

846
01:10:37,374 --> 01:10:41,242
It has won and we have lost.

847
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,894
- Hello?
- Sarah.

848
01:10:59,963 --> 01:11:01,794
She's not here.

849
01:11:01,865 --> 01:11:04,993
I know your voice, Sarah.
Talk to me.

850
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:55,446
Stop here.

851
01:11:57,321 --> 01:11:59,949
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much, guv.

852
01:12:11,268 --> 01:12:13,065
One, please.

853
01:12:16,139 --> 01:12:17,731
Thank you, sir.

854
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,787
How did you get it?

855
01:13:15,232 --> 01:13:17,564
You had a drinks party last week.

856
01:13:19,236 --> 01:13:22,171
- Yes. That small man.
- Yes.

857
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,208
He is my snoop.

858
01:13:28,478 --> 01:13:29,911
How ridiculous.

859
01:13:31,548 --> 01:13:34,676
It's no more
ridiculous than you.

860
01:13:34,751 --> 01:13:36,912
Why didn't you tell me?

861
01:13:36,987 --> 01:13:41,924
I tried. Each time I tried,
something would happen.

862
01:13:41,992 --> 01:13:46,088
- That's mumbo jumbo, Sarah.
- It doesn't work like that.

863
01:13:46,163 --> 01:13:47,596
Accidents.

864
01:13:47,664 --> 01:13:52,465
Little things.
God is in the details, Maurice.

865
01:13:52,536 --> 01:13:54,333
You can't believe that.

866
01:13:54,404 --> 01:13:57,032
Do you believe in things
you can't see?

867
01:13:59,409 --> 01:14:01,377
- You mean Him?
- I mean you.

868
01:14:03,914 --> 01:14:08,078
You see, I never stopped loving you,
even though I couldn't see you.

869
01:14:11,021 --> 01:14:14,184
My mother baptized me a Catholic.

870
01:14:14,257 --> 01:14:17,886
My father was Jewish,
so we never practiced.

871
01:14:17,961 --> 01:14:21,590
But she always said
she hoped it would take.

872
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:23,462
Like a vaccination.

873
01:14:25,435 --> 01:14:29,769
I've only made
two promises in my life.

874
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,638
One was to marry Henry...

875
01:14:32,709 --> 01:14:35,177
the other to stop seeing you.

876
01:14:37,214 --> 01:14:39,876
And I'm too weak to keep either.

877
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,484
I know you don't believe in Him...

878
01:14:47,824 --> 01:14:50,088
but try to.

879
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,025
Talk to Him.

880
01:14:53,096 --> 01:14:54,427
I can't.

881
01:14:54,498 --> 01:14:56,432
Tell Him I'm sorry.

882
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,798
I'm too human...

883
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,429
too weak.

884
01:15:01,505 --> 01:15:06,442
Tell Him I can't keep my promises.

885
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:09,411
I'm tired of being without you.

886
01:15:12,516 --> 01:15:16,612
- Let's get you home.
- I don't want to go home.

887
01:15:17,521 --> 01:15:18,954
I know.

888
01:16:03,667 --> 01:16:06,227
So have we broken the spell?

889
01:16:10,173 --> 01:16:12,164
The world didn't end, did it?

890
01:16:12,242 --> 01:16:14,574
It did, in a way.

891
01:16:14,644 --> 01:16:16,612
But then, it always did.

892
01:16:18,748 --> 01:16:20,682
Can I sleep now, Maurice?

893
01:16:21,751 --> 01:16:23,685
Please let me sleep.

894
01:16:51,581 --> 01:16:53,549
- It's Henry.
- Don't answer it.

895
01:16:53,617 --> 01:16:56,745
Why not? We'll have
to tell him sometime.

896
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,345
- Come away with me.
- Where?

897
01:16:59,422 --> 01:17:01,583
Anywhere. Brighton.

898
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:04,725
I want a few days peace
before the arguments begin.

899
01:17:05,862 --> 01:17:08,922
- Well, Henry never argues.
- I wasn't talking about Henry.

900
01:17:14,738 --> 01:17:16,933
Pain is easy to write.

901
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:21,205
In pain, we're
all drably individual.

902
01:17:22,312 --> 01:17:24,246
But what can one write
about happiness?

903
01:17:49,806 --> 01:17:52,434
It doesn't suit you.
And it's mine.

904
01:17:52,509 --> 01:17:55,171
- You want it? There's a price.
- How much?

905
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,884
Can I pay again?

906
01:18:04,688 --> 01:18:08,124
- I want children, you know.
- How many?

907
01:18:08,191 --> 01:18:11,422
- I'll start with one.
- Only one?

908
01:18:11,494 --> 01:18:13,428
You want to start with two?

909
01:18:14,464 --> 01:18:16,591
Is that a promise?

910
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:18,099
Yes.

911
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,177
Let's get you back to the hotel.

912
01:18:33,216 --> 01:18:36,185
- Just those two.
- Very good, sir.

913
01:18:48,698 --> 01:18:51,098
It is a bit of a mess.
Yeah, you're right.

914
01:18:55,372 --> 01:18:57,840
- Business going well?
- Yes, it's going...

915
01:18:57,907 --> 01:18:59,841
Still on the job?
Don't worry.

916
01:18:59,909 --> 01:19:02,139
- Oh, dear.
- Here. Come with me.

917
01:19:02,212 --> 01:19:04,976
Come. So where's
your boy this time?

918
01:19:05,048 --> 01:19:07,107
I left him at home, sir.

919
01:19:07,183 --> 01:19:10,778
Hardly a wise move. He'd have
had the sense not to get noticed.

920
01:19:10,854 --> 01:19:14,051
You think so, sir?
Perhaps I wasn't cut out for this job.

921
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:17,389
Tell your employer
the circumstances are unique.

922
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:21,897
What was your phrase?
The party in question is a writer.

923
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:25,401
- They notice everything.
- They certainly seem to, sir.

924
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:30,662
- So who's hired you this time?
- I'm not at liberty to say, sir.

925
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:33,300
Let me guess. The jealous husband.

926
01:19:36,112 --> 01:19:38,478
I never expected to be
recalled to this case, sir.

927
01:19:38,548 --> 01:19:40,516
Yours is a secure profession.

928
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:44,280
As long as fools like us love,
your employment never ends.

929
01:19:44,354 --> 01:19:46,288
You could put it like that.

930
01:19:46,356 --> 01:19:48,756
And love never ends, does it?

931
01:19:49,926 --> 01:19:51,518
It seems not.

932
01:19:51,594 --> 01:19:53,619
So what do you need?

933
01:19:53,697 --> 01:19:56,427
Photographs of us
in flagrante delicto?

934
01:19:56,499 --> 01:20:00,868
Copies of hotel bills? Evidence of
soiled sheets? We'd be happy to oblige.

935
01:20:00,937 --> 01:20:05,601
No, my brief is to follow you.
Inform him as to your whereabouts.

936
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:07,609
Which, of course, you'll do.

937
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:10,737
I'm obliged to, sir, under
the terms of my employment, posthaste.

938
01:20:10,814 --> 01:20:14,306
Won't you need supplementary evidence?
The divorce courts will demand it.

939
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:19,780
They generally do, sir,
if it come to that.

940
01:20:19,856 --> 01:20:23,519
Well, Exhibit "A."

941
01:20:23,593 --> 01:20:28,053
Receipt for two sandwiches
bought on the train to Brighton.

942
01:20:28,131 --> 01:20:31,589
Mutual sandwiches are surely
evidence of intimacy, aren't they?

943
01:20:31,668 --> 01:20:34,466
- They could be so construed, sir.
- Exhibit "B."

944
01:20:34,537 --> 01:20:36,471
Two tickets for a Big Dipper.

945
01:20:36,539 --> 01:20:39,770
- You seem to be doing my job for me.
- Yes, but we haven't quite got there.

946
01:20:39,843 --> 01:20:42,437
What would clinch it for us?

947
01:20:42,512 --> 01:20:45,743
What would make
divorce a certainty?

948
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:55,948
Generally, sir, some kind
of photographic evidence of...

949
01:20:57,961 --> 01:20:59,929
Of intimacy.

950
01:21:02,599 --> 01:21:06,797
Would be most useful, sir,
if it came to such a pass.

951
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:10,670
It will, Parkis.
It most certainly will.

952
01:21:42,405 --> 01:21:43,838
Here.

953
01:21:51,047 --> 01:21:53,015
I dreamt we had a child.

954
01:21:53,082 --> 01:21:55,107
We will.

955
01:21:55,185 --> 01:21:57,278
We were on the bed together.

956
01:21:57,353 --> 01:22:01,414
The room filled up with water.
There was a child between us.

957
01:22:01,491 --> 01:22:03,789
Why water?

958
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:06,454
The sea had come in the window.

959
01:22:23,847 --> 01:22:26,475
So you'll marry me.

960
01:22:29,719 --> 01:22:31,914
That's a promise.

961
01:23:02,285 --> 01:23:06,278
The prince regent began building it
for his mistress, Mrs. Fitzherbert.

962
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:08,324
Beautiful but flawed.

963
01:23:08,391 --> 01:23:11,417
- How was she flawed?
- She was Catholic.

964
01:23:11,494 --> 01:23:13,689
Impossible, of course.

965
01:23:13,763 --> 01:23:15,390
So he loved her.

966
01:23:15,465 --> 01:23:20,664
Yes, but he married Princess Caroline
of Brunswick who was Protestant...

967
01:23:20,737 --> 01:23:22,432
but huge.

968
01:23:22,505 --> 01:23:26,498
And he built this huge folly
to impossibility.

969
01:23:26,576 --> 01:23:29,306
- Not now, Henry.
- Forgive me, Sarah. I had to.

970
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:33,247
- Oh, God, please. Henry, not now.
- You had to what, Henry?

971
01:23:35,151 --> 01:23:37,346
- Talk.
- Go back home.

972
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,650
- You can't hold on to her forever.
- I know, but...

973
01:23:39,722 --> 01:23:43,954
It hardly suits you, Henry,
the role of a jealous husband.

974
01:23:44,027 --> 01:23:46,257
Please, I don't mean
to make a scene.

975
01:23:46,329 --> 01:23:49,298
Henry, go home.

976
01:23:49,365 --> 01:23:51,856
I'm not jealous, Bendrix.

977
01:23:52,936 --> 01:23:54,870
What was it you said?

978
01:23:54,938 --> 01:23:58,965
Lovers are jealous.
Husbands are ridiculous.

979
01:24:01,244 --> 01:24:03,735
I was never her lover.

980
01:24:03,813 --> 01:24:05,872
Not much of a husband either,
I'm afraid.

981
01:24:05,949 --> 01:24:08,213
But you hired our detective.

982
01:24:08,284 --> 01:24:10,548
I had to find out where she was.

983
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:15,023
So you know. She wants a divorce.

984
01:24:15,091 --> 01:24:18,322
That won't be possible, old man.

985
01:24:18,394 --> 01:24:20,328
You'll contest it?

986
01:24:20,396 --> 01:24:23,593
No, but it would take
at least three months.

987
01:24:23,666 --> 01:24:27,033
Well, what's three months, Henry,
out of a lifetime?

988
01:24:28,471 --> 01:24:30,769
Half.

989
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,331
Half of what?

990
01:24:33,409 --> 01:24:35,877
Of a lifetime, I'm afraid.

991
01:24:37,814 --> 01:24:40,806
Sarah's dying.

992
01:24:40,883 --> 01:24:44,910
Her doctor called the night
she didn't come back...

993
01:24:44,988 --> 01:24:47,320
with the result of some tests.

994
01:24:49,058 --> 01:24:51,049
I knocked on your door.

995
01:24:52,829 --> 01:24:55,229
I imagined you were both there.

996
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:01,266
How oddly we behave
at such moments.

997
01:25:17,987 --> 01:25:20,353
You shouldn't get wet, darling.

998
01:25:20,423 --> 01:25:23,085
- Don't you like the rain, Henry?
- Yes, dear, but...

999
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:27,289
You've heard news, Henry.
Is it good?

1000
01:25:28,564 --> 01:25:30,031
No, dear.

1001
01:25:31,401 --> 01:25:36,134
You see, Maurice, never make a promise.
You may have to keep it.

1002
01:25:43,846 --> 01:25:47,839
You should never have been
jealous of me, Bendrix.

1003
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:58,286
I did Sarah a great disservice
when I married her. I realize that now.

1004
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:02,164
I'm not the sort
that makes a lover.

1005
01:26:04,467 --> 01:26:07,061
She wanted someone like you.

1006
01:26:07,904 --> 01:26:10,395
I'm not sure
it's as simple as that.

1007
01:26:14,444 --> 01:26:16,935
If you don't mind me asking...

1008
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:21,445
I'd like you there
when the time comes.

1009
01:26:21,517 --> 01:26:23,007
It may not come.

1010
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:28,315
You of all people
don't believe in miracles.

1011
01:26:28,391 --> 01:26:30,757
No, but Sarah does.

1012
01:26:34,297 --> 01:26:38,233
I'd always believed that
I'd be the one to die first...

1013
01:26:39,936 --> 01:26:42,632
and that Sarah
would know what to do.

1014
01:26:46,209 --> 01:26:48,268
Are you at a loss, Henry?

1015
01:26:52,215 --> 01:26:54,149
I am quite.

1016
01:26:57,153 --> 01:27:01,351
And it would save you a bit
if you moved in with us.

1017
01:27:01,424 --> 01:27:06,191
Sarah always said your books weren't
as successful as they should have been.

1018
01:27:09,532 --> 01:27:15,232
You could be there, working in
the daytime, while I'm at the ministry.

1019
01:27:15,304 --> 01:27:19,866
And at night, we could both...

1020
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:30,583
And so I moved to the north side
of the common...

1021
01:27:30,653 --> 01:27:34,589
and, oddly enough,
I felt instantly at home.

1022
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:45,863
Can I help you, Father?

1023
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:50,534
- I've come about Mrs. Miles.
- She's indisposed.

1024
01:27:50,606 --> 01:27:53,837
You mean, she's ill, don't you?

1025
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:57,437
- Yes, I suppose I do.
- Yes.

1026
01:27:58,514 --> 01:28:02,314
She's been to see me several times,
and I know she'd like to see me before...

1027
01:28:02,385 --> 01:28:05,479
She's left word with me
she's not to be disturbed.

1028
01:28:05,555 --> 01:28:07,489
Is her husband here?

1029
01:28:15,565 --> 01:28:19,934
- She told me about you.
- I know she did.

1030
01:28:20,002 --> 01:28:21,936
I'm the lover, Father.

1031
01:28:36,252 --> 01:28:38,186
Who was that?

1032
01:28:45,595 --> 01:28:47,028
The postman.

1033
01:28:50,166 --> 01:28:52,134
What did he bring?

1034
01:28:54,403 --> 01:28:56,871
He had the wrong address.

1035
01:29:01,077 --> 01:29:03,910
How odd for a postman.

1036
01:29:14,257 --> 01:29:17,226
You know what happened that day?

1037
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:21,955
You thought I was dead...

1038
01:29:22,031 --> 01:29:23,965
and I wasn't.

1039
01:29:26,302 --> 01:29:27,769
No, darling.

1040
01:29:29,705 --> 01:29:32,173
Something happened in that room.

1041
01:29:33,976 --> 01:29:38,037
There were the same walls
around me...

1042
01:29:38,114 --> 01:29:41,572
the same sunlight
coming in the window...

1043
01:29:43,786 --> 01:29:47,153
but nothing will
ever be the same again.

1044
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:51,355
You can't believe this, Sarah.

1045
01:29:53,663 --> 01:29:56,063
But it's true.

1046
01:29:57,433 --> 01:30:00,664
I never loved anyone
as I loved you.

1047
01:30:02,305 --> 01:30:06,002
And when you came through that door
with blood on your face...

1048
01:30:08,411 --> 01:30:11,073
another kind of love
came with you.

1049
01:30:12,815 --> 01:30:15,306
And I caught belief...

1050
01:30:15,384 --> 01:30:16,976
like a disease.

1051
01:30:18,287 --> 01:30:20,812
I fell into belief like I'd...

1052
01:30:22,224 --> 01:30:24,317
fallen into love.

1053
01:30:25,394 --> 01:30:27,885
And I tried to fight it...

1054
01:30:30,599 --> 01:30:33,534
but I haven't any fight left.

1055
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:57,622
It wasn't the postman, was it?

1056
01:30:59,595 --> 01:31:01,495
No, it wasn't.

1057
01:31:03,632 --> 01:31:06,760
Dear Maurice,
you can't go on fighting.

1058
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:09,430
It's only love, after all.

1059
01:31:45,474 --> 01:31:48,534
So You're taking her...

1060
01:31:48,611 --> 01:31:51,341
but You haven't got me yet.

1061
01:31:51,414 --> 01:31:54,440
I don't want Your peace
and Your love.

1062
01:31:55,718 --> 01:31:58,846
I wanted Sarah for a lifetime...

1063
01:31:58,921 --> 01:32:01,321
and You're taking her from me.

1064
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:04,985
So I hate You, God.

1065
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:10,089
I hate You as though You existed.

1066
01:32:27,016 --> 01:32:30,816
You have to help me, Bendrix.
I can't.

1067
01:32:30,886 --> 01:32:32,717
I will.

1068
01:32:32,788 --> 01:32:35,518
I can't live in a world
where she's gone.

1069
01:32:39,228 --> 01:32:41,355
I'll help you.

1070
01:32:57,613 --> 01:33:01,481
I would have taken care of
all the arrangements, if I'd known.

1071
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:03,711
Surely you disapprove of cremation?

1072
01:33:03,786 --> 01:33:05,811
I would have arranged
a Catholic burial.

1073
01:33:05,888 --> 01:33:08,152
But she wasn't a Catholic,
was she, Henry?

1074
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:10,658
We recognize
the baptism of desire.

1075
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:15,355
She said things
that seemed like prayers.

1076
01:33:15,431 --> 01:33:18,594
We've made all the arrangements.
We can't alter things now, Father.

1077
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:21,158
You wouldn't want talk, Henry.
There's the notice in the Times.

1078
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:26,802
If you'd come a little sooner, Father...
Please, don't think...

1079
01:33:26,876 --> 01:33:28,844
I think nothing
bad of you, Mr. Miles.

1080
01:33:28,911 --> 01:33:31,379
- Perhaps me?
- Don't worry, Mr. Bendrix.

1081
01:33:31,447 --> 01:33:34,007
Nothing you can do
will affect her now.

1082
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,514
- She was a good woman.
- She was nothing of the sort.

1083
01:33:40,589 --> 01:33:42,523
She could put the blinkers
on any man.

1084
01:33:42,591 --> 01:33:44,991
She deceived you, Father,
as she deceived her husband and me.

1085
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:46,994
- She was a consummate liar.
- You've no right.

1086
01:33:47,062 --> 01:33:49,860
- Let the poor man rave.
- Don't give me your professional pity!

1087
01:33:49,932 --> 01:33:53,231
- Keep it for your confessional!
- You can find me there anytime you want.

1088
01:33:53,302 --> 01:33:54,894
I don't want you.
I'm no Sarah.

1089
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:56,733
- I'm sorry, Father.
- No need to be.

1090
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:59,965
I know when a man is in pain.

1091
01:34:02,344 --> 01:34:05,438
I'm not in pain, Father.
I'm in hate.

1092
01:34:05,514 --> 01:34:08,915
I hate Sarah, because she was
a tart to your mumbo jumbo.

1093
01:34:08,984 --> 01:34:11,350
I hate Henry,
because she stuck to him.

1094
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:16,323
And I hate you and your imaginary God,
because you took her away from us.

1095
01:34:18,727 --> 01:34:21,821
- You are a good hater.
- To hell with all of you!

1096
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:03,434
I'm sorry, Henry.

1097
01:35:10,412 --> 01:35:12,607
The thing is, Bendrix...

1098
01:35:14,416 --> 01:35:16,475
I always knew.

1099
01:35:18,787 --> 01:35:21,017
I knew she was with someone...

1100
01:35:23,025 --> 01:35:25,255
but I never thought you.

1101
01:35:28,731 --> 01:35:30,699
But the odd thing is...

1102
01:35:32,568 --> 01:35:34,536
I'm glad it was.

1103
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:57,782
It's a sad pleasure
to see you here, sir...

1104
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:59,828
where bygones are always bygones.

1105
01:35:59,895 --> 01:36:03,160
Do you always follow your people
as far as this?

1106
01:36:04,233 --> 01:36:07,031
She was a very fine lady, sir.

1107
01:36:07,102 --> 01:36:10,003
At a cocktail party,
she handed me a glass of sherry.

1108
01:36:10,072 --> 01:36:12,540
Was it South African sherry?

1109
01:36:12,608 --> 01:36:14,576
I wouldn't know, sir.

1110
01:36:14,643 --> 01:36:17,237
There weren't many like her.

1111
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:20,111
My boy, now,
he's always speaking of her.

1112
01:36:20,182 --> 01:36:22,946
How is your boy, Parkis?

1113
01:36:23,018 --> 01:36:27,011
He's exceptionally well, sir.
Though he's a bit upset today.

1114
01:36:27,089 --> 01:36:30,024
He imagined she'd be buried
in a Catholic way.

1115
01:36:30,092 --> 01:36:32,356
And why would he think that?

1116
01:36:32,428 --> 01:36:35,192
Young boys, sir,
they get these ideas.

1117
01:36:35,264 --> 01:36:38,722
Though I have to admit,
even I can't explain it.

1118
01:36:38,801 --> 01:36:41,463
Explain what?

1119
01:36:41,537 --> 01:36:46,304
On the day of her assignation,
she walked him to a tube.

1120
01:36:46,375 --> 01:36:50,675
She thought he was lost, gave him
a coin and kissed him on his cheek.

1121
01:36:50,746 --> 01:36:52,805
On his afflicted cheek, sir.

1122
01:36:52,881 --> 01:36:54,872
And over the weeks
that followed...

1123
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:57,475
his affliction gradually went away.

1124
01:36:57,553 --> 01:37:00,886
I tried to keep him rational,
but he swears it was because of her.

1125
01:37:03,025 --> 01:37:05,459
Say hello to Mr. Bendrix, Lance.

1126
01:37:24,012 --> 01:37:25,843
Hello, sir.

1127
01:37:37,593 --> 01:37:41,723
I wrote at the start
that this was a diary of hate.

1128
01:37:41,797 --> 01:37:44,994
I hated You as though You existed.

1129
01:37:45,067 --> 01:37:47,968
Now I am tired of hating...

1130
01:37:48,036 --> 01:37:50,027
but You're still there.

1131
01:37:50,105 --> 01:37:54,132
So Your cunning is infinite.

1132
01:37:54,209 --> 01:37:57,235
You used my hate to win
my acknowledgement.

1133
01:37:57,312 --> 01:37:58,711
Thank you, Henry.

1134
01:37:58,781 --> 01:38:00,908
And I've only one prayer left.

1135
01:38:02,451 --> 01:38:05,318
Dear God, forget about me.

1136
01:38:06,388 --> 01:38:09,949
Look after her and Henry.
