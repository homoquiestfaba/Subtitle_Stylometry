<i>I'm Lando Calrissian, newly-appointed

<i>where your journey is our privilege.</i>

6
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey, look, guys! It's Lando! Hey, Lando!

7
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,500
That's a holo-vid, Finn.

8
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:07,375
Isn't it great?
No Stormtroopers. No TIE Fighters.

9
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,291
No threat of galactic annihilation.

10
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,708
It'll be an adventure.
A vacation adventure!

11
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,166
It's a nice idea, buddy, but...

12
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,791
Do heroes even take vacations?

13
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:20,291
Just look at
all these activities. (LAUGHS)

14
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,583
Poe, you love your activities, buddy.

15
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,041
I do. I do love activities.

16
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:30,583
Okay, first we take a private bridge tour,
followed by a holo-sabacc tournament,

17
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,083
then a quick bite
in the Crown of Corellia Dining Room.

18
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:36,875
But eat fast, because after that,
it's a brisk walk around the sun deck.

19
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:40,916
Poe, it's a vacation.
When do we, you know, relax?

20
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,250
I can schedule
five minutes of relaxing time

21
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:47,000
in between shuffleboard and
the engineering room experience.

22
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,583
- "Engineering room experience"?
- (GRUNTS)

23
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:54,541
That's the spirit, Poe.
And here, to catch some rays, Rey.

24
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,000
Hmm.

25
00:01:56,083 --> 00:02:01,125
I could use a little R and R and R.
Rest, relaxation, and reading.

26
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,625
Relaxing. With a Jedi text?

27
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,458
You relax your way, I relax mine.

29
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:12,625
- Mmm. This is pretty nice.
- They even have a spa.

30
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:18,125
Oil baths for everyone.
Finally, we are on holiday.

31
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,958
- It's not that kind of holiday.
- Let it go.

32
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,375
Yeah, but it's... Letting it go.

33
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,583
See? It's gonna be great. We need this.

34
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,125
Especially since it's the last time
we'll all be together.

35
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,333
Anyway, uh, I'll go check us in.

36
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,208
Okay, people, time's wasting.
Let's get a move on.

37
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,291
Where are you going?

38
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,375
REY: To the sun deck.

39
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,416
I'd try to talk you out of it,
but we're already behind schedule.

40
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:48,625
Okay, Rose and Rey, you're on deck seven,
room three-o-one...

41
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:54,833
Rey? Rose? Where'd everyone go?
Whole point was to do this all together.

May I offer you a beverage?

47
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,875
What do you recommend for someone
whose friends ditched him?

48
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,208
BV-RJ: Better friends?

49
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,916
I have just the drink. The Yerdua drop.

50
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,458
This trip sure isn't going like I'd hoped.

00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:49,875
Right? I, uh... Whoa! What is in this?

53
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,583
Who are you?

54
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,250
Obi-Wan Kenobi. Hello, there.

55
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,291
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
From the Battle of Geonosis?

56
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,583
And the attack on Felucia?
And the Siege of Ryloth?

57
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,083
And... I'm kind of a Clone Wars expert.

58
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:07,500
It is an honor, sir. General.
Sir General. General Kenobi.

59
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,375
No need to stand on ceremony, young Finn.

60
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,500
Call me Obi-Wan.
We're on vacation after all.

61
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,291
Rey once told me that past Jedi may
appear to help guide us in times of need.

62
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:24,250
Is that why you're here?
What is it? Is it another Death Star?

63
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:28,083
A Second Order? Is the Emperor
coming back again... again?

64
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:32,083
No, I sensed a Jedi in need of counsel.

65
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,916
Oh. Uh...

66
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,250
Rey's somewhere on the ship.
But I'm not sure where.

67
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,250
I'm talking about you.

68
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,833
Me? Oh, I'm good. Ha!

69
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,375
My friends are gone, but I'm hanging out
in an empty lounge with a Jedi ghost.

Finn.

71
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,833
Okay, I'm not good.

72
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:52,458
My friends are gone and I'm hanging out
in an empty lounge with a Jedi ghost.

73
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:56,500
It is a vacation, Finn.
They're enjoying themselves.

74
00:04:56,583 --> 00:05:00,083
You must learn to enjoy yourself.

75
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,833
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you know about vacations?

76
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:08,041
You're telling me the great
Obi-Wan Kenobi took a vacation? Ha!

77
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:13,416
Well, from a certain point of view.
It was back on Tatooine.

Honey, did I leave our identification
at the Great Pit of Carkoon?

97

Which, by the way,
is at best just an okay pit.

98
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,333
I'd stay out of it.

Not ready for what?

Ben's right, Han.
This place is seriously rundown.

We prefer the term
"Ewok rustic," Your Highness.

I'm Wick Cooper.

they were staying with us.

00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:08,958
This is so cool!
Oh, and can I have some credits?

531
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,125
I'm meeting Mahlnor

Whoa! He speaks. Come on, kid.

537
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,583
What about the speeder-bike?

538
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:35,375
He may have other interests.

539
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,708
Maybe later. Have fun.

540
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:45,291
Now, to the reception desk, milady.
And, my guy.

541
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:50,125
I can't believe your mom
is the Leia Organa.

544
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:58,625
Of course he has. Haven't you, Ben?

Uh, actually...

Lay off, Rad. This is Ben Solo.

549
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:12,666
He was just about to tell us what it's
like to fly the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

He couldn't even reach the controls,
much less fly.

I fly the <i>Falcon</i> all the time.

554
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:26,958
Just because your last name is Solo,
it doesn't mean you're a pilot.

555
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,208
Oh, yeah? I'll prove it.

556
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:34,666
Solo? More like "so low."

557
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:40,041
Get it? "So low." Low. 'Cause he's short.

to get to the reception desk.

but they're actually
vicious little monsters.

to talk to you about! (YELPS)

around anymore, you little creeps.

Yeah. I'm starting to think
this isn't the reception desk.

590
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:28,625
I might have had an ulterior motive
bringing you out here.

591
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:32,166
You know, it seems the locals haven't
been exactly quote-unquote thrilled

they're trying to muscle me out.

threatening to eat my guests.

So, I thought if someone
of your stature talked to them,

596
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,708
that maybe they would back off.

665
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:36,083
C-3PO: Artoo, thank the stars
you are safe.

666
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,458
Oh, cool, a barbecue!

667
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:45,291
Oh, my sweet little girl. (KISSING)

668
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:51,666
Oh, Daddy is so glad his brave little
porgie-worgie pie is okay.

669
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:56,083
- Dad, everyone's watching.
- I don't care.

(CHEWBACCA BELLOWS)

671
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,625
Thanks, Chewie. (LAUGHS)

672
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:08,250
Ben! You were amazing up there
with the lasers, and the blasting.

673
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,500
And the turning in the... Oh, my gosh.

674
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,250
Oh, it was nothing.

675
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,458
See you around, Ben.

677
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,833
- Best vacation ever!

(BELLOWS)

679
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,416
I'll miss you, too, Chewie.

680
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,000
You're going to love lightsaber training.

681
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:51,375
Try not to lose a hand.
It's kind of a thing in our family.

682
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:54,500
- Okay, Mom.
- We love you so much.

683
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,208
You flew the <i>Falcon</i>
through a debris field,

684
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:59,416
saved the day, and got your first kiss.

685
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Dad.

686
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,666
I'm just saying,
the trip wasn't all bad, right?

687
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:07,666
- I guess not.
- Well, I guess this is it.

688
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:10,500
- Yeah.
- You listen to your Uncle Luke.

689
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:11,791
I will.

690
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:18,458
Son? I love you.

691
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,750
I know.

692
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,791
- FINN: Was it hard?
- Was what hard?

693
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:34,916
Saying goodbye.

694
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:40,250
It was the hardest. But it was also time.
Why do you ask?

695
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:43,333
'Cause I'm starting to realize that
I don't know if I can do it.

696
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:45,416
We're all about to go our separate ways.

697
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,333
Rey is headed to the Unknown Regions
to search for Jedi temples.

698
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:51,666
Poe's training new X-Wing pilots.
Rose is off to lead relief missions,

699
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,625
and I'm gonna scour the galaxy
for others like me.

700
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:56,625
Others who are strong in the Force.

701
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:58,666
Who knows when
we'll all be together again?

702
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,458
Perhaps that's why this trip
has been so difficult.

703
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:03,458
- For all of you.
- All of us?

704
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:07,291
Is it possible that none of you
are ready to say goodbye?

705
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:13,416
Finn, a wise Jedi once told me,
"No one's ever really gone."

706
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:16,250
Thank you, General.

707
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:21,791
- C-3PO: Oh, there is Master Finn.
- We've been looking all over for you.

708
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:24,583
- FINN: And I've been looking for you.
- We're sorry, buddy.

709
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:25,791
For what?

710
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:28,458
You arranged this amazing vacation
for us to be together,

711
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:31,625
but we all went off
and did our own things.

712
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:36,625
That's okay. I realized I planned this
trip because I was avoiding something.

713
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:38,000
Saying goodbye.

714
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:39,083
He's right.

715
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,666
- I've been feeling it, too.
- This trip is the end.

716
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,583
Exactly.
But a trip isn't about the destination.

717
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:48,583
It's about the journey. Enjoying
the moments for as long as they last.

718
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,416
Oh, no. Don't you do it.
Don't go mushy on me.

719
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,000
Remember how we first met?

720
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,750
FN-2187.
That's the only name they ever gave me.

721
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:58,750
Well, I ain't using it. I'm gonna
call you Finn. Is that all right?

722
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:00,708
You gave me a name, Poe.

723
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:03,708
Oh, you did it. You went mushy on me.

724
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,125
(BLOWS NOSE)

725
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,708
And, Rey, remember
the marketplace on Jakku?

- (GRUNTS)
- (COUGHS)

727
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,583
Follow me.

728
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:23,458
You gave me purpose, Rey.
And, Rose, you gave me hope.

729
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:24,666
Why would you stop me?

730
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,708
I saved you. That's how we win.
Saving what we love.

731
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:34,625
I've been told that you have to
do what you love.

732
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:38,708
Well, I've loved fighting alongside
all of you. I'm gonna miss that.

733
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:42,166
I didn't want to admit it to myself,
but I never wanted those feelings to end.

734
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,041
That's why I planned this trip.

735
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:48,125
But with the memories we've shared,
well, no one's ever really gone.

736
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:56,291
Hey! The trip's just getting started.
Oh! I know what we should do now.

737
00:43:56,375 --> 00:44:01,250
- Better not be a trash compactor.
- Group hug? Come on.

738
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:05,791
C-3PO: This is really
quite pleasant. Chewbacca!

739
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:08,291
- (CHEWBACCA BELLOWS)
- No, Chewie. That hug's perfect.

740
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:13,458
<i>We hope you are enjoying your adventure</i>
<i>aboard the</i> Halcyon.

741
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:19,458
<i>Although every trip must eventually end,

742
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:25,916
<i>So, we thank you, for joining us,
and may the Force be with you.</i>
