00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,003
[silence]

2
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,610
<i>How would you guys</i>
<i>describe Joanne?</i>

3
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,178
[laughing]

4
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,747
I don't, I don't want
to hear this.

5
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,350
Very talented.

6
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,853
- That's good.
- Uh, outgoing.

7
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,755
Very creative.

8
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,826
She can always see more
than what most people see

9
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,694
when she looks
at something.

10
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,996
I wanna go with that.

11
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,065
- Mhmm.
- I can go with that.

12
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,600
Very, um...wow.

13
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,170
- [scoffs]
- Yeah, creative.

14
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:12,337
Stubborn.

15
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,173
- Yeah, there you go.
- I'm a Taurus.

16
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:16,341
She can be very stubborn.

17
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,577
- A Taurus and--
- And a perfectionist.

18
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,913
It has to be perfect and it...

19
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,083
- It, it has to be perfect.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:28,887
<i>What do you guys think</i>
<i>about Joanne and her, um,</i>

21
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:32,057
<i>you know,</i>
<i>involvement with frockOn</i>

22
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,093
<i>and...</i>

23
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,428
<i>writing, spending</i>
<i>so much time</i>

24
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,265
<i>writing on a fashion website,</i>
<i>fashion blogging?</i>

25
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,769
Well, you know, it, it's a
fabulous opportunity for her.

26
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:48,173
It just unbelievable
what, what doors can get
opened up for her,

27
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,142
what she can do now.

28
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:53,479
Edie Sedgwick is like my
fashion inspiration.

29
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:56,882
She is amazing.
I wish she was still alive.

30
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,050
Um...

31
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,919
And she's my fashion
inspiration because she,

32
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,489
like, pushed the limits,
like, more than any person

33
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:04,990
that I can even think of.

34
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,259
<i>So, this is my first time in</i>
<i>Youngstown and, uh...</i>

35
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:11,263
<i>I hear there's like a lot of,</i>
<i>uh, you know, murders here.</i>

36
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,499
<i>Like, unsolved murders</i>
<i>and...</i>

37
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:17,669
I mean, the area's really
revitalizing a lot,
gentrifying.

38
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,473
Um, trying to, I guess
forget about that history.

39
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,041
Okay, what's it like outside?

40
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,576
Murder-y.

41
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,978
- [scoffs]
- It's, uh, it's--

42
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,379
I'm so glad...

43
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,413
It's crisp.

44
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,116
I'm so glad that my film crew

45
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:34,319
is planning a murder video

46
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,354
[laughing]

47
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,055
on my day.

48
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,056
[laughing]

49
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,124
Do this on your time!

50
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,127
This is why
the murders happen.

51
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,330
It's uh...Youngstown,
it's uh...

52
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,066
It's a self... it's a
auto-suggestion thing,

53
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,502
You just say the word
murder in Youngstown,

54
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,271
and people just
become paranoid

55
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:53,772
and then they
start murdering

56
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,674
because they heard it.

57
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,810
And it's just like, it's inner
prophecy thing that just...

58
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:03,015
Where are some of the
weirdest places you guys

59
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,750
have seen bullet holes?

60
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:07,986
Uh, in a church bathroom.

61
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,421
Uh, in a car.

62
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,857
It used to be mostly
on the south side,

63
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,793
but now it's kind of...
it's sort of happening,

64
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,261
when you were saying
they were gentrified,

65
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,530
it's more of like,
civilized murder now.

66
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,433
It's less like bullet holes
in a windshield,

67
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,969
and it's more like
"Where is that guy?"

68
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,370
[laughing]

69
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:29,041
It's like this disgruntled
cesspool of like...

70
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,142
uh, repression...

71
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:31,310
Wow, I really like it here.

72
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:34,213
Youngs--Youngstown...
well then there's the train,

73
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,314
there's always the train.

74
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:38,417
There's this one murder
that...

75
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,353
Like there's a set of train
tracks that like...

76
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,355
I think this guy used to be

77
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,190
like some kind of
train operator

78
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,992
or something like that
and like...

79
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,694
when the train sort of
like shut down,

80
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,896
he couldn't handle it,
so he like,

81
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,831
kind of lives
at the train track,

82
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,399
like at the old B & O station

83
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,034
and he kind of like...

84
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,636
That's where like multiple
killings have been,

85
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,104
but they've never found him,

86
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,707
so the fact that they never
found him, like...

87
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,041
Nobody, it adds
the mystery. Like--

88
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,243
So he's still out there?

89
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,444
- Apparent--
- Murdering?

90
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,579
And well,
nobody really knows.

91
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,414
That's the, that's the thing
of it is like,

92
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,451
"Oh, that's the train track..."
and it's half fact,
half fiction,

93
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,019
and if you ask
the police station, like,

94
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,787
they won't give you...

95
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,690
Like, the media doesn't
really say, it was this guy

96
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,225
or it wasn't this guy.

97
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,860
- But he used to be--
- And they know who he is?

98
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:22,828
No, cause
they can't find him.

99
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,664
All they find are dead bodies
at the train tracks.

100
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,732
[laughing]

101
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,584
So this is like a half mile
away from my house,

102
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,985
right down the road.

103
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,054
And this is, I mean,
it's an awesome place.

104
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:52,491
I love the look and the rustic
feel and everything of it,

105
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,926
but it's where a lot of
murders have happened,

106
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,795
and it's extremely...

107
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,297
sad.

108
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,265
Creepy, definitely creepy.

109
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,602
Yeah, but I like it.
I mean, it's, it's pretty.

110
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,904
I mean, it's a shame
that nothing has ever...

111
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,472
been done about the place,

112
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,775
like no one's ever
cleaning it up or anything,
like the rest of...

113
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:10,742
Everyone's getting murdered

114
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,810
cause they
come down here.

115
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:12,778
Right, I mean it's...

116
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,946
And people have
disappeared here.

117
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,748
It's not, I mean
it's not safe.

118
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,983
I mean,

119
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,618
I could see people
disappearing

120
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,019
and getting murdered here
though, definitely,

121
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,120
like at nighttime...

122
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,155
- Well, yeah...
- You have to like--

123
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,123
Who's gonna hear anything
with all the cars.

124
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,326
- And nobody's around...
- Well, hunting gunshots,

125
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,226
so it sounds like a...

126
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:32,464
Yeah, there's gunshots right
now, I mean, but they're...

127
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,466
suppose...supposedly,

128
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,001
what you keep
in the back of your head

129
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,469
is that they're just hunting,
but who knows?

130
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,004
Yeah, that's
not so reassuring.

131
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,774
But it sucks because
everybody thinks it's
terrible,

132
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,643
it's really not that bad,
but I guess it's just
cause...

133
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,345
- ...this is all we know.
- We're used to it.

134
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,379
- Yeah, really.
- This is all we know.

135
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,814
Definitely has some
potential though.

136
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,215
There are some beautiful
places here.

137
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:50,882
Yeah!

138
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,119
I know, I mean you see like
in Vogue and stuff,

139
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,521
people are all doing photo
shoots on railroad tracks,

140
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,023
and then these rustic,

141
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,392
country side areas, they go
to like Baton Rouge...

142
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,127
like, no, come the fuck
to Youngstown.

143
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,363
There's lots of space
and you know,

144
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:09,901
Yeah. I like it, and I mean,
I don't know, it's kinda...

145
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,071
It's just pretty.

146
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,540
You guys see that?

147
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,376
See what?

148
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,443
[indistinct dialogue]

149
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,245
No, I'm not freaking you out.

150
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,848
I mean, I really did just see
like a person...

151
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,784
It's not a person.

152
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,388
No, I do see something.

153
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,589
Where?

154
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,191
Over there,
like by the pillars.

155
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,527
Did you see anything?

156
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,463
Oh my God. Holy shit.
Did you see that?

157
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,867
Please tell me you saw that.

158
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,403
- Are you scared?
- Come on.

159
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,872
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>that's a good idea.</i>

160
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,508
Why? What are you
talking about?

161
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,610
Are you scared?

162
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,246
I'm not scared.
He's the one scared.

163
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,249
You're the one who saw it.

164
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,084
I know I did, but I don't...

165
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:04,189
[indistinct chatter]

166
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,991
Are you serious?

167
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,859
Oh, what the fuck?

168
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,261
[nervous laughter]

169
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,729
Oh my God.

170
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,267
What is that?
Is that blood?

171
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,635
You're the one who saw it.

172
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,670
I know I did, but I don't...

173
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,778
No, no. It's probably just
like some teenagers

174
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,880
doing some stupid shit,
shooting up,

175
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,383
getting some blood on their
hands, rubbing it on the...

176
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,318
"Argh."

177
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,920
So I mean we have
a party to go to tonight.

178
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,656
I, I know this is fun and
great Mr. Camera Guy,

179
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:40,258
but I mean we need to go
get ready for the party.

180
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,595
- So, let's get out of here.
- Yeah, let's go.

181
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,241
<i>Yeah, that totally</i>
<i>looks like real blood.</i>

182
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,409
<i>Yeah.</i>

183
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,511
<i>Dude, that's real blood.</i>

184
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,614
<i>Lick it, dude.</i>

185
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,317
No. No way.
There's no way, I'm not...

186
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,852
I didn't come here.
I didn't sign...

187
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:10,455
I'm not licking crap off
a pillar in Zombieland.

188
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,990
[laughing]
No, I'm not doing that.

189
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,659
I'm not doing that.
That's disgusting.

190
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,827
<i>Lick it dude.</i>

191
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,028
You wanna pay me?

192
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,663
<i>I bet you it's deer,</i>
<i>deer blood though,</i>

193
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,500
<i>that some hunter did.</i>

194
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,467
Will you give me a--

195
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,669
<i>Real blood but deer blood.</i>

196
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,471
<i>I'll give you a dollar.</i>

197
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:27,572
A dollar? [laughs]

198
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,340
<i>I'll double it.</i>

199
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,574
Okay, a dollar!

200
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,177
<i>Get your tongue in</i>
<i>there dude, yeah.</i>

201
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,111
<i>Do it, do it.</i>

202
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,779
<i>At least smell it.</i>

203
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,115
[laughing]

204
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,850
Oh my-- [coughs]

205
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,487
Yeah, you just got deer
herpes, bro.

206
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,588
Shut up, man.

207
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,857
[vomiting]

208
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,192
Holy shit.

209
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,498
What it taste like?

210
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,233
Cough syrup?

211
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,268
[laughing]

212
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,071
[indistinct dialogue]

213
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:21,092
[marching band audio]

214
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,796
Oh my God, I haven't seen
you guys in so long.

215
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,764

00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,199

00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,200
- You look amazing.
- Look at you.

219
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,268
Oh, thank you!

220
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,336
No, you guys

221
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,237
You look great.
Yeah.

222
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,505

224
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,374
What is this cameras
[indistinct]?

225
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,342
I didn't tell you guys.

226
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,743
I, I've been getting
followed around

227
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,278
for the past few weeks
for the,

228
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,746
for a fashion documentary,
yeah.

229
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,383
So you go into the writing
shit, the fashion writing shit.

230
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,518
Right, yeah.

231
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,619
- Strange, I have to say.
- That is nice.

232
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,254
Thank you.
I mean you guys look great,

233
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,221
you should definitely
get in it.

234
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,289
Thank you so much.

235
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,592
No, look at you, you the
fashion designer...

236
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,560
- ...fashion writer.
- Thank you.

237
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,062
- It's been so long.
- It has been.

238
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,430
It's nice seeing you guys.

239
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,732
- Yeah.
- We'll catch up with you,
okay?

240
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:01,766
Yeah, definitely.

241
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,969
- Aww.
- Take care, Jo. all right?

242
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,637
- Thank you.
- All righty, nice to see you.

243
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,972
- Nina.
- I'm Gia.

244
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,807
Oh my God, Nina and Gia.

245
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,676
[overlapping dialogue]

246
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,318
So basically nobody knows

247
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,220
what happened
to him, right?

248
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,955
I mean, no.

249
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,124
All I heard was that
the soldiers came

250
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,660
and delivered his
[overlapping dialogue]

251
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,061
with the flag.

252
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,796
Hey, this is supposed to be
a fashion documentary.

253
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,198
Why are you
talking about Bobby?

254
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,100
- Well, they were just--
- Oh, no. They-- She...

255
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,068
We're just joking.
We love you, Jo.

256
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,004
I know, I mean everyone
looks so great,

257
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,739
and you're talking
about sad stuff.

258
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,474
You're right, you're right.
Guys...

259
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,908
- I'm sorry.
- I'm Jo, yeah.

260
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,743
- Hi, I'm Yanna.
- This is Yanna.

261
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,512
I wanted to say, it's not
just sad. It's not that sad.

262
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,648
I mean it's sad,
but it's also like a moment

263
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,849
for you guys to celebrate
your friend.

264
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:51,750
- Right?
- Right. Yeah, definitely.

265
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:52,951
So it's not just sad. Yeah.

266
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,152
- That's what we're doing.
- Yeah, yeah.

267
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,420
Yeah...

268
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,288
And he was cute,
I saw a picture of him.

269
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,757
How's the fashion thing
going?

270
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,424
It's going great.

271
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,793
I mean I haven't talked to
you in a while so, just...

272
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,362
I didn't even know about it
until right today.

273
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,264
I've been really busy,
I'm sorry.

274
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,100
- ...we glad that you--
- You look, you look great.

275
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,368
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

276
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,971
I'm not into fashion, though.
I'm into arts.

277
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,040
Are you, I mean are
you a model or anything?

278
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,676
I go to art school, but I do
a lot of projects in the city.

279
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,611
We should like get together
cause she's a dancer,

280
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:20,945
we should like do a project
together...

281
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:23,181
Do you design at all,
like if you're into art?

282
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,016
I didn't do design,
I like painting though.

283
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,217
- Oh really?
- Painting is my thing.

284
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,218
That'd be really cool to,
you know, like--

285
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,022
I like talking to college
students and seeing like
what they're doing,

286
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,525
like what their goals are and
write a little article about it.

287
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,526
We should definitely
get together.

288
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,660
- Yeah, we should do that.
- Yeah.

289
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:36,661
Do you come
to the city a lot?

290
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,962
Uh, a little bit, yeah.

291
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,331
That's where we're based in,
so I go every so often.

292
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,332
That's cool.

293
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,001
Yeah, we'll exchange
information.

294
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,136
And she should come
and join us right?

295
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,905
Yeah, I'm down for anything.

296
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,174
I'm like, I love fashion.
I love fashion.

297
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,177
Please girl, I can do
a fashion show for you.

298
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,712
A joke?

299
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,448
No, like a real one, I mean.
It's funny, but it's real.

300
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,482
Oh.

301
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,050
It's actually like
gonna happen.

302
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,519
I'm in Cleveland right now,
me and my girl.

303
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,122
- Oh really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

304
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,057
What do you do there?

305
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,426
Uh, I work at a coffee shop
but I'm getting fired

306
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,561
cause I'm not coming
home tonight

307
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,663
and I have
to be there at 6am.

308
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,365
So I don't have a job,
which is awesome.

309
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,700
So that's why you
should come to the city.

310
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,336
Ahh! Let's go to the city!
Let's do it.

311
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,637
I love this girl.

312
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,705
So guys, how about this?

313
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:21,840
- Did you just meet her?
- Yeah.

314
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:25,577
So basically after the wake,
after we spend time here,
we all go to the city.

315
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,878
- Yeah.
- How 'bout that?

316
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,812
Yeah, I'm down.

317
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:31,483
I've never actually been to
like a bigger city before.

318
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:32,684
- Come with us.
- No?

319
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,453
I mean... no, I, I just
haven't had to go.

320
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,523
I know, I never brought you
before, you should come.

321
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,024
- Yeah.
- You should come, man.

322
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,693
- Chase us.
- I mean yeah, if you want.

323
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:42,894
- You come?
- Yes.

324
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,529
I didn't even get a drink.

325
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:45,563
What is this?

326
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,365
Oh um,
anybody got a drink?

327
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,100
Hey what's up, this is Ken.

328
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,369
How you doing, it's Jed.

329
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,072
And we're just basically
here for, um, Bobby's wake.

330
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,573
Um, I was a freshman
in high school,

331
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,641
he was a senior so...

332
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:57,909
Yeah, and they played on
the basketball team,

333
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,310
I didn't really know
the guy but...

334
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,112
I didn't know him that much,
but you know,

335
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,881
I knew him a little bit before
he went to war though,

336
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:03,848
he seemed like
a pretty awesome guy.

337
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,150
- Yeah?
- Pretty awesome guy.

338
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:08,286
I mean I... like I said but,
it's nice that since we can all

339
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,988
work together and honor

340
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,122
what seems to be a great
man...

341
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,259
I think it's an honor to be
here though, I think it is.

342
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,494
- It's still a great honor.
- Yeah, definitely.

343
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,429
- Um, let's toast to Bobby.
- Yeah.

344
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,398
What's, what's with
all the cameras?

345

Sad to see him go.

I'm sure, you all seem like
lovely kids,

379
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:36,174
he would really appreciate
that you're here to honor him

380
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,909

381
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,310

you've all been.

You know, they talk about
the greatest generation,

384
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:48,319
but I really believe that
this is the greatest generation,

385
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,054
and Bobby was
a member of that

386
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,856
and he was a terrific
soldier.

387
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,659
Uh, it's my honor and
privilege

388
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:58,830
to have served with him in
Afghanistan, and I just, uh...

389
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,900
I think he's emblematic
of young people

390
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:05,603
who've put their lives
on the line for their country

391
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:09,574
and um, I hope that
everybody appreciates that.

00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,663
You okay?

520
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,966
She, she bit... she bit her.
I don't know.

521
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:09,867
There was so much blood
and everything...

522
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,436
- You're okay.
- Did anyone else get bit?

523
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,871
- No.
- You guys are fine?

524
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,406
- Yeah, we're good.
- We're good. We're good.

525
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,641
Oh god, this is not--

526
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,542
Did you guys get followed?
Were they behind you?

527
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:19,577
I don't know. We don't know.

528
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,479
We just ran as fast as
we could.

529
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,546
You guys, we need
to get inside.

530
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,215
We need to get inside.
We need to get inside.

531
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,283
What is this?

532
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,152
- So it's safe, it's safe?
- It should be, yeah.

533
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,454
Ok cool, cool. I trust you
man, I really trust you.

534
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,890
Jo, John, come on.

535
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,499
Let's go, dude.

536
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,037
Come on, dude.

537
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Come on,
come on, come on.

538
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,609
Somebody lock that door.

539
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,990
What are we doing now?

540
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,525
I'm sorry,
where the fuck are we?

541
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:08,626
Guys, it's okay we're safe
here.

542
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:10,995
I went to school here,
it's a Catholic school.

543
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,396
I don't think so.

544
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,265
Pretty sure.

545
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,033
What are we gonna do?

546
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,102
Guys, I feel like
Alice in Wonderland.

547
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:19,603
What?

548
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,138
We gotta figure this out.

549
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,441
Yeah, I don't know if I'm
getting feeling about this.

550
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:25,009
Which door, man?

551
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,445
- Guys, they're labeled.
- I don't know.

552
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,846
Well what does the numbers
means for, huh?

553
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:29,780
What are the numbers for?

554
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,649
How the fuck
am I supposed to know?

555
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:32,983
It's his school...

556
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,518
They're, they're classrooms.
I don't know, I mean...

557
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,387
What about if we
stay stuck down here.

558
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,189
Like we gotta think about
this shit.

559
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,157
- Nah nah.
- Two is even.

560
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,461
Nah, nah. All these doors,
nah this, this shit ain't right.

561
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:44,795
This shit ain't right.

562
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,164
In, in the 20's,
you know the, the klan,

563
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,066
they had a place in this
town, like a headquarters.

564
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,167
Right here.

565
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,304
Yo, like this...nah,
you think it's funny,

566
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:57,208
until your fuckin' ass get
popped up by a fuckin' like
the grand wizard zombie,

567
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,143
and they fuckin' come after
you -- well shit,

568
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,478
they ain't goin' after you,
they goin' after me.

569
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,912
Your ass too,
you should be worried.

570
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,013
Don't mess with me,
all right?

571
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,382
Listen let's be cool,
like seriously,

572
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,816
let's pick
a door and move.

573
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,319
Yo, we saw freakin'
zombies upstairs,

574
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:09,220
you're talking about
being cool...

575
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,121
Come on!

576
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:12,456
[arguing]

577
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,924
- Come on, guys.
- Guys, they're right out there.

578
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,193
We gotta get in these doors.
Number two, final deal.

579
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:20,498
Whoa whoa whoa, wait wait.
Wait. Ken Ken Ken, dude.

580
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,366
Jed, what's wrong?
You sure that...

581
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,934
You sure that that's the
right door?

582
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,504
Cause there's plenty of other
doors in here, right guys?

583
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:29,407
Maybe we should take a...
like a general consensus.

584
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,609
Guys, it's better than being
out here, just go in.

585
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:32,810
Trust me.

586
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,979
Trust me, Jed.

587
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,683
[creaking]

588
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,491
Watch your step.

589
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,927
What the hell.

590
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,796
This is kinda cool.

591
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,765
What is that?

592
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,700
A cross.

593
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:59,570
Oh no no...

594
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,739
Where are we?

595
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,541
I feel a presence.

596
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,276
Oh what the fuck is this?

597
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,677
Oh what now?

598
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,283
No no.

599
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,185
This is the wrong door.

600
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,121
What's over there?

601
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,058
- Ah shit.
- What is that?

602
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,293
Ah shit.

603
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,461
Do you guys...
do you guys see that?

604
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,129
Shh. Shh.

605
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,398
Wait you guys.
Listen, listen, listen.

606
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,066
It's fucking creepy as is...

607
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,601
This is the wrong door.

608
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:33,137
- What the fuck.
- ...this cross right here?

609
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,839
This was the wrong door.

610
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:37,141
Yo, this shit is the
underground railroad.

611
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,242
This shit--

612
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,978
- Guys. Shh. Shh.
- This is the wrong--

613
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,947
Just calm down, all right.

614
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,782
Don't tell me to fucking
relax, there's fucking
zombies upstairs, dude.

615
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:46,584
I don't, I don't like this.

616
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,986
Let's just go back
and try a different...

617
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,022
- No, I wanna go outside.
- Guys, I don't like this!

618
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,157
Something isn't right!

619
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,025
- Just calm down.
- No, I just wanna...

620
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,928
Nina, I just wanna go.
Can we please just go?

621
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,966
No, I left Bob! I left Bob
alone. He needs me.

622
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:04,768
He won't eat without me.
I gotta go!

623
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,703
Who's Bob?

624
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:07,538
I have to--just let me go!

625
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,975
[overlapping dialogue]

626
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:12,943
Look, I have pictures.
Tell them, Nina!

627
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,312
I have pictures.
I can't leave him alone!

628
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,348
A zebra? Really?

629
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,949
[overlapping dialogue]

630
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,719
It's my zebra,
I left him all alone.

631
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:22,786
- I have to--
- Calm down.

632
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:23,821
Shh shh shh.

633
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:26,290
- Shut up!
- Shh shh shh shh.

634
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:27,691
- Listen! Just shut up.
- Listen! Listen!

635
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,760
- Listen!
- Shh, guys.

636
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,730
You hear that?

637
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,666
Hello?

638
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:36,834
[eerie noises]
- Oh, shit!

639
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:37,801
Oh, shit! Come on!

640
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,537
- Guys!
- Hold on. Hold on.

641
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,372
Wait, wait.
Zombies don't talk.

642
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,374
How the fuck you know,
Ken?

643
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,708
Get away from that door...

644
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,743
Wait, guys.
Zombies don't talk.

645
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,912
- Fuck!
- Shh...

646
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:49,246
Zombies don't talk, guys.
Hold on.

647
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,748
- Hello?
- Hello.

648
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,882
[distant voices]
Hello?

649
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:52,983
Who are you?

650
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,118
There's people back there.

651
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,819
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

652
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:56,820
Go, they might be hiding
from...

653
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,656
All right, come on, guys.

654
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,593
Guys, it's Ghostbusters.

655
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,528
Ghostbusters?

656
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,498
Yeah, that, that's
what they said.

657
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,933
Hello?

658
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:10,568
Fucking Ghostbusters.

659
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,936
- No.
- No.

660
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,571
We're the
Collective Paranormal
Research Society.

661
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:14,605
We're on investigation.

662
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,006
Who the hell are you?

663
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:19,043
We're just college students.

664
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:19,910
College students?

665
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,779
Yeah, we were stopped by
zombies.

666
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:22,780
Zombies...

667
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,782
[laughing]

668
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:27,251
[overlapping dialogue]

669
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,919
...fucking zombies.
It's not a fucking game!

670
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,522
We were asked, we were
asked by the homeowner,

671
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:32,423
or the building owner

672
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,091
to come in and do
an investigation.

673
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,859
We deal with paranormal,
we don't deal with like

674
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,628
the whole zombie folklore
kind of stuff.

675
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,662
I mean, we're...

676
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:40,931
You know what?
We need to unite, okay?

677
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,067
This is really not the time
to be fighting over stupid shit

678
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,302
like who's a zombie,
what's a ghost, you know,

679
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,370
what's real, what's not real.

680
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:47,605
We just saw a girl get
bitten.

681
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:48,606
And like honestly,

682
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,274
what's up with all these
damn cameras?

683
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,376
We just keep drawing
freakin' more attention,

684
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:55,212
just keep it up, why don't
you just shut that shit off?

685
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:56,714
- Honestly.
- Seriously.

686
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:58,248
That's a good ass fuckin'
idea, turn that shit off.

687
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,650
Turn that shit off, man.

688
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:02,553
You guys have no idea
what's going on outside,
all right?

689
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:03,587
- They don't.
- Trust me.

690
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,722
We just need
to band together.

691
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:05,823
We've been down here for
hours and we haven't heard

692
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:06,824
one word or any...

693
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:09,159
There's walking
corpse outside.

694
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,295
Well don't you think that we
have the kind of equipment

695
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,830
to be able to hear these
kinds of things?

696
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:14,999
Please help us. Just tell us
how to get out.

697
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:16,800
We have to get away.
We're being chased.

698
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,302
Guys, you think we
making up shit right now?

699
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,804
How did you... 'How did you
get in?' is the first question.

700
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:21,672
Yeah, the owner...

701
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:22,906
Cause this place
was locked up.

702
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,274
We've been here, again,
for the past four hours.

703
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,909
There's walking corpse
outside.

704
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,177
Maybe the zombie unlocked
the door.

705
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,012
How does a zombie unlock
a door?

706
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:32,616
Listen there's a lot of shit
that's going on that's
unexplainable right now.

707
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,718
We don't wanna argue with
you, we're not joking around.

708
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,753
I, I understand.

709
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:37,187
Really?
You guys are the skeptics?

710
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:38,889
The paranormal team
is the skeptics?

711
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:41,025
As far as I'm concerned,
you're contaminating
our equipment.

712
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,793
I mean, we have nothing
here that's saying that...

713
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:45,829
We have the right stuff to
say if zombies exist,

714
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,698
or if there's any kind of
noise going on outside.

715
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,267
It seems like you've done,
you know, well enough
yourself so far.

716
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,969
You just stick to a group,
I'm sure you'll be fine.

717
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:53,671
But again, we don't deal with
zombies.

718
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:54,805
- Hey, guys...
- Hey, guys!

719
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,106
The spike's getting a
reading.

720
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,107
Hold on, everybody be quiet.

721
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,742
We are getting a spike
over here.

722
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:02,046
Something's...
something's around.

723
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:05,449
Something coming through,
basically.

724
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:07,718
all right, do we have
anybody here with us
right now?

and it went through five
frequencies

736
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:45,989

737
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,227

You know what,
this is not safe.

743
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,674
We have nowhere to go.

744
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:05,676
No you are safe here, we
have, we have priests.

745
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:07,444
- No, we're not!
- We have priests here.

746
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:08,579
We're not joking...

introduce you to two people,

748
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,283
we have Father Delroy
and Father John.

749
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,551
Why do you have priests in
here?

750
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,719
Why are they smoking?

751
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:16,587
Perhaps--

752
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,388
Our priests
are trigger objects.

753
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,057
They're our trigger objects
and you know,

754
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,892
we can't really protect
ourselves from demons.

755
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:24,361
We can wear metals,
but they're not, you know...

756
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,897
It's not, doesn't give us
the same protection as
having a priest with us.

757
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:27,765
Guys...

758
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,299
We have other people here,

759
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,602
and other sources of
protection just in case

760
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:34,138
that we come across
some kind of contact

761
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,007
- like maybe you guys--
- Hey guys...

762
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,208
Frankie, it's over here.

763
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,410

Father John, Delroy...

765
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,782
would you guys
maybe come over here
and check this out?

766
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,884
all right, one second please.

767
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:47,785
One second.

like that before.

going towards this shit?

go towards the corner.

No, it's okay.

804
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,536

under control.

a lot out of them...

Please just stand back,
everything's okay.

00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,078
We need to relax.

00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,079
We do this all the time.

812
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,414
Jed, Jo, where are you?

813
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,084
There's nothing to be afraid
of guys, I promise.

814
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:29,086
Could just be a malevolent
spirit, that's all.

815

They can make noise.
It's okay.

- Yeah, it's something else.

00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:37,895
Yeah, there's no possible
way it could be zombies.

820
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,832
- Go upstairs!
- It's okay. Just calm down.

what's going on.

You guys are freaking out
over nothing.

835

And that--the only thing
that's scary is our mind.

836
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:07,758
It's all in our heads, okay?

837
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,859
- Exactly.
- Listen...

838
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,928
You, girl, need to sit down.
sit down!

839

- Sit down! Sit down.
- Nina, no...

Sit down...

842
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,368
And I'm gonna go see

843
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:23,140
what all this mystery is all
about, okay guys?

844
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:25,075
Don't worry.

845
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:26,443

In here, in here.

00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,097
I knew it was a bad idea.

861
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,432
I knew it was a bad idea
to come here. I knew it.

862
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:24,868
I would never listen to you
if...if it was...

863

Bad idea? Babe, calm down.

- Calm down?

to calm down.

Why do I ever listen to you?

868
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,445
Why was I so stupid to come
here with you?

869
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,447
I just don't understand.

870
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,282
What? Yanna, this is
not my fault.

871
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,318
- It's not your fault,
of course.
- What are you sa--

872
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,987
Yeah never nothing is your
fault, nothing is your fault.

873
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:47,190
You're so blind, Scott. You
can't see what's going on.

874
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,293
You can't. You know why I
came to Youngstown?

875
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,195
To break up with you.

876
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,031
I can't be your mom
anymore.

877
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:56,133
I can't make every single
decision.

878
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:57,134
- Yanna!
- Of you.

879
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,668
Are you fucking kidding me?

880
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,037
Fucking kidding you?

881
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,406
We almost died in there
and you wanna
break up with me?

882
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:04,041
Yes, I think it's
the perfect time.

883
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:06,209
I need you
to wake up, Scott.

884
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,811
It's been going on
for months.

885
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,846
- I can't do it anymore...
- Where is this coming from?

886
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,014
Seriously!

887
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:14,351
Where is it coming from?
Oh God, don't be such a liar.

888
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:17,154
I saw you there with Joanne.
I saw it.

889
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:18,488
With Joanne?

890
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,890
You're trying to deny it to
me?

891
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:21,324
You're un--unbelievable.

892
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:23,927
Joanne's my family friend.
She's like my sister to me.

893
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,829
All right yeah,
I saw what was going on.

894
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,064
I knew what was going on.

895
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,099
You fucking bastard,
I'm done.

896
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:31,401
I'm done, I don't wanna--
ever wanna see you again.

897
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,004
Seriously, get a fucking
grip.

898
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,275
This is not the time for this
shit.

899
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:40,343
It's not.
Yeah, it's true it's not.

900
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:41,845
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

901
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:44,781
We're gonna be fine, right?
We're gonna be fine.

902
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,316
Yeah, I hope so.

903
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,551
Yeah...

904
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:48,785
Look...

905
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,620
Did you hear that?

906
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:53,090
[growling]

907
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:56,760
[screaming]

908
00:34:56,762 --> 00:35:01,064
[growling continues]

909
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:05,602
[creepy laughter]

910
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,972
[footsteps]

911
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,243
Honestly what's going on
right now?

912
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,812
I have no clue.

913
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,350
I mean is this...

914
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,653
What's gonna happen?

915
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,589
What's gonna...

916
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,391
What's gonna happen to our
family?

917
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:30,360
Our friends?

918
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,598
Let's hope
we get back to them.

919
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,667
That's all that matters right
now.

920
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,736
During my childhood,
I was...

921
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,738
I was abused by my dad.

922
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:46,076
But I never really
told y'all this.

923
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:47,577
Every day...

924
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,812
every day
coming from school

925
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,447
just seeing my dad there...

926
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,082
sit on the couch.

927
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,520
This mean face
with a belt in his hand.

928
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:58,255
Just hit me.

929
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,757
Pow pow pow.

930
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,492
Crying just on the floors,

931
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,261
and every time
y'all called me, I just...

932
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:07,097
just act like
everything is all right,

933
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:08,765
but nothing was all right.

934
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,901
Nothing at all was all right.

935
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,871
You guys, I have to tell
you...

936
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,344
Cause my mom
and dad died

937
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,684
in that car accident,

938
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,453
before you guys met me.

939
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:35,192
So I had to live with my...
my grandma.

940
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,498
And I just...

941
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,967
I don't know what I would do
without you guys because...

942
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,802
It's okay man.

943
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,270
It's okay man.

944
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,674
Cause she...

945
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:54,211
You're the only ones that
have been there for me.

946
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,316
Jed, we love you,
all right, man?

947
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:00,984
I love you guys, too.

948
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,052
We love you man.

949
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,720
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

950
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,357
Your mom is out there
watching for you,
all right bro?

951
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,392
She's watching for you, Jed.

952
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:13,530
She's watching for you
up in heaven, man.

953
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:14,764
And we gonna stay together.

954
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,900
We gonna get through this
Jed, all right?

955
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,568
Yeah.

956
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,237
Just like my dad.

957
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,908
He's over us.
He's with us. It's fine.

958
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,910
Everything will be fine.

959
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,180
It's what brought us
together, right?

960
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:31,248
Mhmm.

961
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,650
It's all that counts, man.

962
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,686
It's all that counts.

963
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,123
- We'll be fine.
- We'll be fine.

964
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,558
We gonna take these
zombies out.

965
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,792
Fuck those zombies.

966
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,594
Yeah, fuck the zombies.

967
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,062
Let's go...

968
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,798
- What the fuck was that?
- Oh my God, Ava!

969
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,700
- Ava...
- Is that...Is that Ava?

970
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,369
- Ava!
- Sounds just like her.

971
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:54,037
Oh shit.
It's coming from here.

972
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,906
Oh my god, we gotta...

973
00:37:56,908 --> 00:38:00,076
- Oh my god. What is this?
- What is this?

974
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,911
- Ava!
- Ava!

975
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:02,846
[screaming]

976
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,414
Oh shit! Oh!

977
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:06,116
Oh shit!

978
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:08,151
Yo, what the fuck
is going on?

979
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:09,052
What the--

980
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:10,220
They squished her head!

981
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:11,521
[screaming]

982
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,123
Oh shit!

- Oh shit!
- Oh my god!

984
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,625
Oh my god.

985
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,626
This can't be
happening, man.

986
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,595
Yo, this shit can't be
happening, man!

987
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:20,930
[yelling]

988
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,332
Woohoohoo!

990
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,603

Help me!

992
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:31,641

995
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:41,918
Oh my god.

996
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,219
Go go!

997
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:46,656
What is that? Ahh!

998
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,058
Oh god. Oh god.

999
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,426
Is that a gun?

1000
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:50,493
Who is that?

1001
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,163
[yelling]

1002
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:54,497

Uh, go go go go go!

[screaming]

1015
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,578
- Calm down.
- Calm down!

1016
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,912
You're gonna be all right...

1017
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,949
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

1018
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:47,117
No problem.

1019
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,687
- Get down.
- Get down.

1020
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:53,723
- Everybody get down.
- Get down. Get down

1021
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:56,926
Oh my god, oh my god.

- Oh shit.
- Oh my god.

1023
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:03,199
Don't worry about it.
You'll--I promise you.

1024
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:05,168
You'll be okay.

1025
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,637
You'll be okay.

1026
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,774
You'll be fine.

1027
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:11,908
Guys, where's Ken?

1028
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,077
He's still out there.

1029
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,915
No, as long as you're with
me, you're gonna be fine.

1030
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,020
[groaning]

1031
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,465
Are you a priest?

1032
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,033
- You're...
- Yes, yes I am.

1033
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,468
- You're a priest.
- I'm father Frank.

1034
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,303
Oh come on...

1035
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,772
You know what, we've seen
too many priests today.

1036
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,774
Listen, we need all the good
will we can get.

1037
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,543
What did the priests in the
basement do but die?

1038
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:47,877
And they're dead.
They're all dead.

1039
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,145
Okay, but this is a different
situation, right now.

1040
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:51,448
We need all the good will
we can get, right?

1041
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,383
We have only each other.

1042
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:55,118
And God is with us.

1043
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,152
No, he's not.

1044
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,821
Who's the fucking God?

1045
00:40:57,823 --> 00:40:59,122
Are we safe now?

1046
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,323
Are we safe...yeah...

1047
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:01,558
- We're not safe!
- For now!

1048
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,092
We don't know
where we're going.

1049
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,228
What is this,
some sort of conspiracy?

1050
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,796
No. No conspiracy.

1051
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:10,133
I'll put my life on the line
for this.

1052
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,935
Listen this whole fucking
thing is crazy.

1053
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:13,903
There's fucking zombies
running around out there

1054
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,271
eating people and shit.

1055
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:17,574
Our friend Ken is dead,
all right?

1056
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:19,809
Our friend is dead, all
right?

1057
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,178
We need to get the hell out
of this Goddamn town.

1058
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,315
We're gonna die. If we stay
out here, we're gonna die.

1059
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,116
Just like those girls
at the party.

1060
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,284
Listen! This--

1061
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,019
...just like the priests,
we're gonna fucking die!

1062
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:32,455
This is the time to come
together okay,

1063
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,691
because we're all we have.
We have nothing, okay?

1064
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:38,294
All we have is our trust in
each other, okay?

1065
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:39,496
Okay honey, okay.

1066
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:42,265
We don't wanna end up like
Ken, we don't.

1067
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:43,700
- Can we all hold hands?
- Do we have any choice?

1068
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:46,569
Can we all hold hands
please?

1069
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:49,506
And say a prayer
on our own.

1070
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,874
- You may not believe...
- I'm not doing this.

1071
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,208
but we have to believe now.

1072
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,810
You don't have to do it
ma'am.

1073
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:54,978
Okay?

1074
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,880
But God will protect us.

1075
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:59,616
We need to find a way out
of this fucking town.

1076
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:01,017
I fucking mean it.

1077
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,051
We're gonna be out of this--

1078
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,319
I am not gonna die here.

1079
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:07,023
I am not gonna stay here
and wait for anybody.

1080
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,725
- I agree.
- Nobody.

1081
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:09,692
You understand?

1082
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,060
Yes I do, ma'am.

1083
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,695
Just try, Yanna.
Just try to pray.

1084
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,863
I came here
for my friend's funeral.

1085
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,465
I didn't come here to die,
all right?

1086
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:18,368
And this is how
we ended up in the back
of a fucking truck.

1087
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,737
Grant me the serenity...

1088
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:23,006
Let's, together.
You know this prayer.

1089
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:24,741
[all]
Grant me the serenity

1090
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:29,012
to accept the things
I cannot change.

1091
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:31,614
The courage to change
the things we can,

1092
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:34,317
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

1093
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,885
Our father,
who art in heaven...

1094
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,253
- We have courage
- They kingdom come...

1095
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:38,388
- thy will be done
- ...courage...

1096
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,822
[all]
...on earth as it is in heaven.

1097
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,591
Give us this day
our daily bread

1098
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:43,359
and forgive us our
trespasses

1099
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:46,162
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

1100
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,097
And lead us not
into temptation

1101
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,166
but deliver us from evil.

1102
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:51,668
For thy is the kingdom,

1103
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,236
thy is the wisdom...

1104
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:58,341
- I don't believe it in any--
- I can't, I can't do this.

1105
00:42:58,343 --> 00:42:59,609
I just can't.

1106
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:01,377
The power, the glory,

1107
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,447
the kingdom, the power,
the glory, yours.

1108
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:11,254
Well, I guess you're alive
until you die, you know, so...

1109
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,855
- But...
- We're alive.

1110
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:15,625
I know and God
is to protect us.

1111
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:17,760
[all]
God is to protect us.

1112
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,562
God is to protect us.

1113
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:21,898
- God is to protect us.
- Last thing, last thing is...

1114
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,399
- Listen to me.
- God is to protect us.

1115
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:25,568
God is gonna
show us the way.

1116
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,905
[all]
God is gonna
show us the way.

1117
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:31,574
God is gonna
show us the way.

1118
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:34,143
God is gonna
show us the way.

1119
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:36,112
God is gonna
show us the way.

1120
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,047
Okay, a moment of silence.

1121
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:41,150
Just a few moments
of silence.

1122
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,089
And pray for the sick and
suffering.

1123
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:47,557
We are not suffering
cause we're safe.

1124
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:49,292
We're safe.

1125
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,896
Okay you're gonna be fine,
sir.

1126
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,135
You'll be fine, young man.

1127
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:01,871
Could you come up here,
please?

1128
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:03,072
Marcus.

1129
00:44:03,074 --> 00:44:05,174
Mar--Marcus, could you just
come up here?

1130
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:07,443
Could you please
come up here?

1131
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:09,646
- No no, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

1132
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:11,614
I'm fine, I'm just...
Leave me alone. I'm fine.

1133
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:12,615
[metal clanking]

1134
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:14,717
Oh shit. Oh shit.

1135
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,722
Out of the truck!

1136
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,828
Come now!

1137
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,300
All of you, hurry.

1138
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:32,935
Hurry.

1139
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,345
Don't look around.

1140
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:45,048
You're not a sight-seeing
tour! Come!

1141
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,217
Marcus...are you okay?

1142
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,426
Move.

1143
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,544
I don't know where we are.

1144
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,458
This way.

1145
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,995
Does this seem like a safe
place to you?

1146
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:34,697
What are you saying?
Stop talking.

1147
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,699
I don't trust you. I don't
trust this place.

1148
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:38,401
I need to get out of here.

1149
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,169
- We don't--
- No, she's right guys.

1150
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,571
We don't know this guy.

1151
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:43,239
Stop screaming, guys.
Let's have--

1152
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,207
You gonna stay here?

1153
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:45,675
He took us
away from the zombies.

1154
00:45:45,677 --> 00:45:46,676
We need to get out
of here, guys.

1155
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:47,944
No, Ava...

1156
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:50,580
Don't listen at all
to the foolishness.

1157
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:51,781
- Come on.
- Ava, come on!

1158
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:53,082
[overlapping dialogue]

1159
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,217
What are you doing?

1160
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:55,518
- Just please...
- I'm gonna go.

1161
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,619
- You wanna stay?
- No, Yanna!

1162
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:58,588
Go! If you're gonna go, go!

1163
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,757
Yanna, are you serious?

1164
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:01,791
Serious, yeah.

1165
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:03,760
Where are you
gonna run to?

1166
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,099
Against the wall.

1167
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,004
This is crazy.

1168
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,812
I can't believe this.

1169
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,017
I can't believe this.

1170
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:32,488
- I know, we can't stay here.
- No, we have to stay here.

1171
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,725
You guys, save yourselves.
Save yourselves.

1172
00:46:35,727 --> 00:46:38,795
If they're stupid enough to
run off...leave them.

1173
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:41,063
That's just fucked up,
it's just not right, man.

1174
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:44,634
Why are you guys still
filming all of this?

1175
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:45,802
I mean seriously.

1176
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:47,136
After everything
that you just saw?

1177
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,772
<i>Who else is gonna</i>
<i>tell our story?</i>

1178
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:52,575
This isn't a story man,
this is survival.

1179
00:46:52,577 --> 00:46:54,277
We're gonna freaking die.

1180
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:55,845
This is government shit,
dude.

1181
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:58,981
If the world doesn't see this,
it's gonna happen
everywhere else too.

1182
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:02,418
Do you have information
about what's going on?

1183
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,754
It doesn't matter, you really
need to turn that off.

1184
00:47:04,756 --> 00:47:05,621
Those lights...

1185
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:06,956
[overlapping dialogue]

1186
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,958
But aren't you afraid too?

1187
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,426
Yeah.

1188
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:13,596
I'm all for it.
I...if they don't cover this,

1189
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:15,331
and this is a government
conspiracy,

1190
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,533
or whatever the fuck this is,
people need to see this.

1191
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:18,634
Shit.

1192
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,770
Um, look what if
we don't make it?

1193
00:47:20,772 --> 00:47:22,371
What if we all, what if we
all get killed here?

1194
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:24,140
Yo, shut up.
Stop saying that.

1195
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:25,708
I mean it's possible.

1196
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,944
This is just not fucking
right, you guys.

1197
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:32,114
Like honestly, this is just
not fucking right.

1198
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:33,683
- Oh my God...
- You're in a safe place.

1199
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,184
Come on, let's sit down.

1200
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:38,120
Everyone get down,
everyone get down.

1201
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:39,722
We need to go back
and get them.

1202
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:42,225
No, we're in a safe place.
Could you sit down please?

1203
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:43,292
Be calm.

1204
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:44,894
Ask these guys
what's going on.

1205
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:46,362
Whatever.

1206
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:48,564
- Oh...
- Oh my God, the lights.

1207
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:51,200
- The lights!
- Oh my God...

1208
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,301
- What'd I tell you?
- He's back.

1209
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:53,336
What'd I tell you?

1210
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:55,805
Put that down. Put it down.

1211
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:58,875
- What are we doing now?
- Against the wall.

1212
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:00,810
Why or what
are we doing here?

1213
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:02,078
Against the wall.

1214
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,748
No, you against the wall,
put that there.

1215
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,749
You against the wall.

1216
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:10,186
- All right, relax!
- Against the wall.

1217
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:12,154
Where are these zombies
coming from?

1218
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:14,690
Why are they here?

1219
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:18,160
The military has had
experiments going on

1220
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:19,562
on the battlefield for years.

1221
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:23,199
Do you think we're just there
to help stop terrorism?

1222
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:26,035
We're there to cause
experiments that will help us

1223
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:28,571
profit and dominate.

1224
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,741
To be an empire, not to
spread democracy.

1225
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:36,078
We are an empire, and we
do that through death,

1226
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,748
destruction,
and money grabbing.

1227
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:42,251
We had experiments
on our own soldiers.

1228
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,087
In Afghanistan,
my own buddies...

1229
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,757
guys I was fighting with
every day,

1230
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:50,726
we bled together, okay?

1231
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:53,062
That's where it started,
they have a cure,

1232
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:55,631
but they will not use it
until it gets so big...

1233
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:57,934
after Youngstown is gone,

1234
00:48:57,936 --> 00:49:00,603
and then they'll present it
on the market,

1235
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,738
and make billions.

1236
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:06,976
Billions and billions on your
corpses.

1237
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,547
So what do we do?

1238
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:15,451
You listen to me, okay?

1239
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:16,652
Yes.

1240
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:17,620
Everyone?

1241
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,288
Yes.

1242
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,656
Yes.

1243
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:24,527
If you want to live,
you will listen to me.

1244
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:30,232
Is this... is this what
happened to Bobby?

1245
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:32,935
Bobby was on our team.

1246
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:34,437
I knew Bobby.

1247
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:36,005
I fucking knew it.

1248
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:38,274
That's terrible.

1249
00:49:38,276 --> 00:49:41,143
But what about change?

1250
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:44,580
What about whoever we're
gonna be voting for against
big corporations?

1251
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:46,115
Did you go to school?

1252
00:49:46,117 --> 00:49:48,184
Yeah, I did. I went to
a liberal arts college.

1253
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:49,986
Did you study history?

1254
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,320
Yeah.

1255
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,489
There's your answer.

1256
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,124
Is this on the news?
Where are the press?

1257
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:57,927
Are they following this story?
Do people know?

1258
00:49:57,929 --> 00:49:59,628
Is this on the news?

1259
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,764
You're in Youngstown.

1260
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:03,733
Nobody cares.

1261
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,435
Sit back.

1262
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:12,008
I want you to relax,
get some rest.

1263
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,910
We've got a long night
ahead of us.

1264
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:18,714
Are you the only one?

1265
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:21,550
I'm the only one.

1266
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:23,185
Why are you saving us?

1267
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,222
I have my reasons.

1268
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:33,629
I don't wanna get too close
to you, but I want you to live.

1269
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:36,365
Um, I don't know
if anybody's ever
told you before...

1270
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,468
but you look like the
Terminator.

1271
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,638
[sighs]

1272
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,475
[whispering]
He does look like
the Terminator

1273
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:48,310
[laughs]

1274
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:49,545
Doesn't he?

1275
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,480
Oh my God...

1276
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:52,581
You bitches are crazy.

1277
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,183
Why would you say that?

1278
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:56,252
This girl's gonna get us
shot.

1279
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:57,686
- Shit...
- No he's not.

1280
00:50:57,688 --> 00:50:58,554
[laughing]

1281
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,223
She's fucking crazy.

1282
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,859
[laughing]

1283
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:05,594
What are we gonna do
about our friends?

1284
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:07,830
My girlfriend and Marcus is
out there.

1285
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:10,566
We have to be concerned
about us right now.

1286
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,902
- Maybe he'll go get them...
- That's really selfish,
father.

1287
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:14,737
- Yeah.
- Seriously.

1288
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:17,440
Well, let's start,
let's start with us,

1289
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:20,076
and then we'll go further.

1290
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,677
You know what, fuck this.

1291
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,879
He's not gonna help us,
I'm going to Yanna.

1292
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:24,914
- I'm gonna find Marcus...
- Come on, sit down.

1293
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:25,881
- Don't go...
- No.

1294
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:27,783
You know what?
He's not gonna help us.

1295
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:29,885
Our friend Bobby died
like this, okay?

1296
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:31,120
You're gonna dig a hole
and hide in it?

1297
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:32,421
What the fuck, man.

1298
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:33,522
Stay. Just--

1299
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:34,857
We were told to stay here.

1300
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:38,060
You guys can stay here.
I'm gonna find them.

1301
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,698
Do-- we, we should
go after him.

1302
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,134
No. We have to stay
in this room together.

1303
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:46,969
- Joanna...
- No, you know we have to.

1304
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:50,072
No, we don't. We can stay
in this room together.

1305
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:51,740
That's what he said,
we have to stay together.

1306
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,409
Yeah, we don't know what's
going on out there, guys.

1307
00:51:53,411 --> 00:51:54,944
- No no no no no.
- I'm going.

1308
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:58,147
Just stay, just stay. Come
on. Just stay, please?

1309
00:51:58,149 --> 00:51:59,648
- Just stay with me.
- Jed.

1310
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,749
Just stay here.

1311
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,251
This is crazy.

1312
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:04,053
Why aren't you listening
to what he said?

1313
00:52:04,055 --> 00:52:05,154
No, come on.

1314
00:52:05,156 --> 00:52:07,056
- and we can be safe, okay?
- We're going.

1315
00:52:07,058 --> 00:52:08,457
No. We have to go find
Scott.

1316
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,593
No no.

1317
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:12,528
- No. No.
- Let her go.

1318
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,663
Come on.

1319
00:52:14,665 --> 00:52:16,632
- Don't go, stay with us.
- Just stay.

1320
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:19,101
We're a team,
we're doing this for Ken.

1321
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:20,503
Come on,
just stay here with us.

1322
00:52:20,505 --> 00:52:21,637
- No. No. Come on.
- You're safe here.

1323
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,605
We're safe...

1324
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,306
Come on.

1325
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,678
That's what they say
about fashion...

1326
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:40,322
Goddamn...Whoo..

1327
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,858
Oh shit.

1328
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,497
Mm, look at you.

1329
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:51,133
And you, and those. And...

1330
00:52:51,135 --> 00:52:53,536
Ooh, mm.

1331
00:52:53,538 --> 00:52:57,506
[muffled groaning]

1332
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:09,018

[breathing heavily]

1335
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,452
Disgusting...

1336
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,470
[water running]

1337
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,012
[Yanna]
Hello?

1338
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:11,380
Hello?

1339
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:13,349
Marcus?

1340
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:14,850
Is that you?

1341
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,487
Marcus...

1342
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:26,028
Marcus... Marcus.

1343
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:28,697
Marcus?

1344
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:31,066
[screaming]

1345
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:31,934
Oh, fuck!

1346
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:34,069
What the fuck. Come one.

1347
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:34,970
Who are you?

1348
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,438
[gunshot]

1349
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,844
[gunshot]

1350
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:49,585
Sick fucker!

1351
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:50,886

[groaning]

1357
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:04,460
<i>There's no one here.</i>

1358
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:06,395
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

1359
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,065
<i>I think it's coming</i>
<i>from down here.</i>

1360
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:24,079
Mealtime's over,
you fucking piece of shit!

1361
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:34,723
[groaning]

1362
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,211
Where's Yanna?

1363
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:57,880
Where's Marcus?

1364
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:01,750
[breathing heavily]

1365
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:22,604
Where's that fucking
Terminator guy?

1366
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:29,711
Don't ever fucking come to
my town!

1367
00:57:29,713 --> 00:57:31,547
Ugh.

1368
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:36,218
Fuck!

1369
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:44,059
Ahh fuck, get off!

1370
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,334
[yelling]

1371
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:09,084
[coughing, choking]

1372
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,055
Come on man...

1373
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,606
[gasping]

1374
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,888
Holy shit.

1375
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,689
Let's go. Let's go.

1376
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:50,959
Let's go find the Zombinator.

1377
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:53,962
Oh god.

1378
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:55,898
[breathing heavily]

1379
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,798
Oh god.

1380
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,900
Do you know where the
others went?

1381
00:58:57,902 --> 00:58:59,134
Did you see any of them?

1382
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:01,470
Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.

1383
00:59:01,472 --> 00:59:03,505
I think they were falling
behind, all I saw...

1384
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:07,209
I only saw, I only saw Yanna
and Scott run in and...

1385
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:08,577
Wait they were in front of
us.

1386
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:11,380
They were in front of us,
they were in front of us.

1387
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:13,549
Well... do you know
where they went?

1388
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:15,050
Did they come in through
the same door as us?

1389
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,319
No, I have no idea. I don't
know where they went.

1390
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:19,988
I don't know where they
went.

1391
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,256
We need to find them.

1392
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:23,258
We need to find Scott.

1393
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,627
We need to find everybody.
We need to find everybody.

1394
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:26,528
I don't know
where they went.

1395
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:27,829
I mean if we don't know
where they are,

1396
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:29,665
then that's fine, then we
just have to find Scott.

1397
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,266
We have to find Scott and
Yanna, right?

1398
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:35,370
I mean I don't know if we're
gonna find Yanna, but we
definitely have to...

1399
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:36,672
we need to find Scott.

1400
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:39,775
- ...need to find the others.
- No, we need to find him.

1401
00:59:39,777 --> 00:59:41,043
The others...

1402
00:59:41,045 --> 00:59:42,177
What's that?

1403
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:46,882
Wait the bathroom, the
bathroom, the bathroom,
the--

1404
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:48,884
That's fucking where Scott
was, right?

1405
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:50,519
Oh my God, we have to go.

1406
00:59:50,521 --> 00:59:52,654
How are we gonna get
through?

1407
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,158
They're just fucking
zombies, right?

1408
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,694
They're just fucking
zombies right?

1409
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:00,596
Are you, are you
gonna come with us?

1410
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,030
Fuck, you better
come with us.

1411
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:03,865
I got 20 pounds of camera
gear with me.

1412
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:07,903
I don't give a fuck about
your 20 fucking pounds
of Goddamn camera--

1413
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:08,770
Why are you still filming
anyway?

1414
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,739
...run with us and we're
gonna get...

1415
01:00:10,741 --> 01:00:11,807
Cause I just fucking...

1416
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:14,710
We need to find Scott,
please--

1417
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:16,378
I love him.

1418
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:19,615
I, I just said it, okay?

1419
01:00:19,617 --> 01:00:22,184
I love him.
We need to find him.

1420
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,920
Okay.

1421
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:26,888
Let's go. Are you coming?

1422
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:30,359
Wait, let's just...let her
fucking do it, right?

1423
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,161
Go!

1424
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:43,505
[groaning]

1425
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,368
[indistinct dialogue]

1426
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:15,604
Lock it!

1427
01:01:15,606 --> 01:01:16,805
It doesn't lock.

1428
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:18,106
There's nothing in here.

1429
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:19,541
Can we go in there?

1430
01:01:19,543 --> 01:01:22,310
I'm not going in there,
look at that...

1431
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:23,478
Come on.

1432
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,846
Here they come.

1433
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,615
- Dude there's no...
- There's not enough room.

1434
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:28,150
Fucking hide, fucking hide.
Why are you fucking--

1435
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:29,418
Come hide, man?

1436
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,889
[panting]

1437
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:38,226
Shh shh.

1438
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:43,131
Oh fucking Scott.
Do you fucking see Scott?

1439
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,868
I'm sorry.

1440
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,070
No, whatever.

1441
01:01:48,072 --> 01:01:51,406
I hear someone.
It's one of them...

1442
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:55,544
[groaning]

1443
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,816
[screaming]

1444
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:02,384
Fucking ge--

1445
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:04,486
Well, hello dears.

1446
01:02:04,488 --> 01:02:06,488
Oh God. I'm gonna cry.

1447
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:08,256
Let me get you into safety.

1448
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:11,560
You have to fucking help us,
you have to fucking help us.

1449
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:12,561
- Cause they're here...
- Wait...

1450
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:13,729
We got some helpers.

1451
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:15,097
No the zombies are out
there.

1452
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:16,598
No no no. No, no.
It's okay.

1453
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,401
What've we got here?
Couple of, couple of...

1454
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:21,002
- I'm Joanne.
- Little precious...

1455
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:24,773
No! What are you fucking
doing to her?

1456
01:02:24,775 --> 01:02:26,074
- No!
- Yes!

1457
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,043
Fucking get fucking
away from me.

1458
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:30,846
No! No!

1459
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:32,681
- No!
- No!

1460
01:02:32,683 --> 01:02:34,783
Don't!

1461
01:02:34,785 --> 01:02:36,218
Don't!

1462
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:38,587
Shut your pie-holes.

1463
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:16,792
Wakey wakey.

1464
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:18,293
Ugh!

1465
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:25,734
You know I'm so
disappointed in you.

1466
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,638
You were damn near my
protege.

1467
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:34,109
We're in Afghanistan fighting
side by side,

1468
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:36,945
then we're winging it out
there and boom -

1469
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:41,583
a corporation comes along
and gives us a ticket to ride.

1470
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:44,686
Next thing I know, you're on
the other side.

1471
01:03:44,688 --> 01:03:46,855
Now...

1472
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:48,757
what is up with you, man?

1473
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:50,525
We got the best weapons,

1474
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,360
we got state of the art
equipment,

1475
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:54,296
we're doing what we
were always given

1476
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:56,531
the skill set to do.

1477
01:03:56,533 --> 01:03:58,466
You know we're in the one
percent,

1478
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:03,004
and instead you go with the
great unwashed 99 percent.

1479
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,307
We're gonna take these
pupa,

1480
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:08,043
and we're gonna get them
infected with this disease,

1481
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:09,611
and then we're gonna cure
them all.

1482
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:11,046
Now what's the harm in
that?

1483
01:04:11,048 --> 01:04:13,615
You could've been a profit
participant.

1484
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:14,850
Just like the rest of us.

1485
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:16,618
Huh?

1486
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,453
Instead...

1487
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:21,056
we're gonna have to let the
zombies take you and...

1488
01:04:21,058 --> 01:04:25,060
masticate on your,
your well-toned body.

1489
01:04:25,062 --> 01:04:29,130
Colonel, I don't think you
can understand anymore.

1490
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:31,499
You're a lost man.

1491
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:34,903
No no no wait, let me
explain to you.

1492
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:36,905
We are the healers.

1493
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:39,841
We get them sick,
but we make them well,

1494
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:42,911
and we make a big time
buck while we're doing it.

1495
01:04:42,913 --> 01:04:44,145
Now what is wrong with
that?

1496
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:46,181
One twisted philosophy.

1497
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:48,550
Let me share you with a
little something.

1498
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:51,753
We're like Dr. Lister coming
up with Listerine.

1499
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:53,555
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1500
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:56,024
Colonel, you were the best.

1501
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:58,760
Now, you're not
even in the rank.

1502
01:04:58,762 --> 01:05:00,228
You're nothing,

1503
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,697
and these men
you have with you?

1504
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:05,367
Heartless bastards
that don't even deserve

1505
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:06,635
to hold a weapon.

1506
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:09,838
Shut up.

1507
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,106
You were the best okay?

1508
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:12,007
You were trained
by this man.

1509
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:15,343
So you're a backstabbing
bastard, that's what you are.

1510
01:05:15,345 --> 01:05:16,845
I am the best.

1511
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:18,113
You're the best
my fucking ass,

1512
01:05:18,115 --> 01:05:21,783
look where you are now
with the chains, huh?

1513
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:22,918
How's that make you
the best?

1514
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,919
I won't be in these chains
for too long.

1515
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,388
You'll see me again,
you bastards.

1516
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,956
Guess what?

1517
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:30,225
Every zombie in
Youngstown

1518
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:32,193
is gonna know
where you are,

1519
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:33,795
and they're gonna
come along

1520
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:35,864
and the very people

1521
01:05:35,866 --> 01:05:37,465
that you're saving

1522
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:40,268
are gonna be the ones
that are gonna chomp
all over you.

1523
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,102
Yeah?

1524
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,905
So...God bless, brother.

1525
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:45,807
I would've loved
to have you on the team.

1526
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:48,910
You don't know who God
is anymore, Colonel.

1527
01:05:48,912 --> 01:05:51,780
He's the one who's got the
biggest dividends.

1528
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,615
Its the American way.

1529
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:04,793
Are you all right?

1530
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:06,561
Get me out of here.

1531
01:06:06,563 --> 01:06:09,297
Come on, hurry.

1532
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,774
Guys, come on.
Get him out of here.

1533
01:06:19,776 --> 01:06:21,076
I can't do this myself.

1534
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:23,645
[chains clanking]

1535
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:36,791
Who's in the bags?

1536
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:42,063
Who's in-- What are they--
Who's in there?

1537
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:46,534
- Are they dead?
- Oh.

1538
01:06:46,536 --> 01:06:48,136
Is she alive?

1539
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:51,206
Good god.
They've been injected.

1540
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:05,053
Goddamn it, Carol.

1541
01:07:05,055 --> 01:07:07,188
I told you this is my night
out. Listen...

1542
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,456
Why don't you go and--

1543
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:12,427
[choking]

1544
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,083
Your helmet might help.

1545
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:37,786
Is this how you wanna do it,
Colonel?

1546
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:42,257
I'll do it anyway you like.

1547
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:53,234
You know I hate
fights like this.

1548
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:55,270
I always get my shirt ripped.

1549
01:07:55,272 --> 01:07:59,107

[gunshot]

1552
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:41,316
I'm so sick. I'm done with...
I'm not even getting paid.
I came here for the free pizza.

1553
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:44,152
I didn't get-- I'm done,
dude.

1554
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:46,588
Dude, I don't care.
Ooh, I'm the camera man.

1555
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:48,590
[mocks cameraman]

1556
01:08:48,592 --> 01:08:49,891
No done.

1557
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:51,292
Dude, we're gonna fucking
win awards for this shit.

1558
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,760
- I don't care.
- You're gay.

1559
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:54,462
Gonna get riches--

1560
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,431
Turn that damn thing
out of my face.

1561
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:57,899
Dude.

1562
01:08:57,901 --> 01:08:58,633
You need to be--

1563
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,602
Bye I quit.

1564
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,103
Bye Bye.

1565
01:09:02,105 --> 01:09:03,605
- Dude, I think there's--
- Bye!

1566
01:09:03,607 --> 01:09:04,639
Dude, that's so--

1567
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,507
There's zombies down
there.

1568
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:07,108
You wanna see my ass?

1569
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,309
- Done.
- So gay.

1570
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:11,846
I'm gonna tattoo D-U--
D-O-N-E on my ass.

1571
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:12,914
Goodbye.

1572

[laughing]

1573
01:09:15,252 --> 01:09:16,818
Whatever man, you're dead.

1574
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,153
Bye.

1575
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:22,023
Well, fuck it.
There goes our sound guy.

1576
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:24,359
Yeah, I guess we're rolling
on camera.

1577
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:25,927
Sound guy's dead.

1578
01:09:25,929 --> 01:09:27,195
Sound guy's dead.

1579
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:29,597
You're dead dude.

1580
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:30,932
There's zombies in there.

1581
01:09:30,934 --> 01:09:32,200
Bye.

1582
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:38,673
Which one
are we gonna go in?

1583
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,309
There's no safe place to...

1584
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:42,510
It's just too weird.

1585
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,579

he'll protect us.

Nina!

1590
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:06,301

1600
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:14,675
Lieutenant, you got some
hard bark on you coming
down here like this.

1601
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:17,712
You put a .45 slug in me.

1602
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:19,881
That's enough for books,
Colonel.

1603
01:15:19,883 --> 01:15:22,450
Well I hope
to return the favor.

1604

[gunshots]

1605
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:28,222
Now I aim like I haven't had
since I was a little baby.

1607

gonna look like.

You'll know soon enough,
Colonel.

No! No!

1613
01:15:59,522 --> 01:16:01,889
What's her life worth,
brother?

1614
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,894
What's she worth, Atam?

1615
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,329
Yeah?

1616
01:16:08,331 --> 01:16:11,365
Colonel, she's worth
a hell of a lot more than you.

1617
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:15,369
And apparently a hell
of a lot of more than
America to you.

1618
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:19,607
Bobby bit the big one
for the corporation,

1619
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:22,043
and these people aren't
gonna get the serum

1620
01:16:22,045 --> 01:16:24,278
if you don't let me out of
here.

1621
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:27,248
You get a commission on
Bobby?

1622
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,216
Did you get some money?

1623
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:30,618
What'd you buy, Colonel?

1624
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:33,087
It's all part of a strategic
plan.

1625
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,426
Please help me.
Please help me...

Hey little girl...

01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:05,486
Come on.
Kiss me like you love me.

1631
01:17:05,488 --> 01:17:07,655
Maybe I'll take you with me.

1632
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:22,003
It's a new day.
