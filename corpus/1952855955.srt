3
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm not gonna do it.

4
00:00:20,357 --> 00:00:23,053
You goddamn sons of bitches,
I'm not doing it!

5
00:00:23,126 --> 00:00:25,560
You can't make me.
I know it.

6
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:26,789
I know what you are.

7
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:31,027
I know what you are.

8
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:33,365
You can't make me do it!

9
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:36,701
You goddamn sons of bitches!
I know what you are!

10
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:39,139
No one is gonna take me!

11
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:44,105
You're gonna have to find
somebody else!

12
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:47,639
You
have to find somebody else!

13
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:51,653
Help, somebody I Somebody, help!

14
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:14,437
Ah!

15
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:47,367
Hi, Cody.

16
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:48,877
Mary.

17
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:53,712
You girls staying out
of trouble this summer?

18
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:55,045
Yes, of course.

19
00:01:57,787 --> 00:02:00,620
Hey, say hi to your
pops for me, huh?

20
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,555
I will.

21
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:06,653
Yeah, say hi to Pops.

22
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,572
Ugh!

23
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,661
Q home?

24
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,199
Q?

25
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:46,827
Uh, I believe he's busy.

26
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,968
Well he better hurry up
'cause I'm looking for him.

27
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:58,277
Who are you again?

28
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:00,908
Tim.

29
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:08,951
Hey, what's up Tim?

30
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:11,391
How you doing man?

31
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:24,766
He's right there, Tim, if
you're still looking for 'em.

32
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:26,468
He just kicked his ass!

33
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:27,100
Ugh!

34
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:35,444
Whoohoo!

35
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:36,883
Get up!

36
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:03,005
Fucking Escalator shit!

37
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:13,880
Here we go.

38
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,848
There you go, man.

39
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:17,045
All right.

40
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:21,823
Just be careful backing up.

41
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:32,658
Where's my beer man?

42
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:34,703
Elroy!

43
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:36,602
Get them belts?

44
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:38,038
Yeah yeah, don't even trip.
They're right in the back.

45
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,598
We need them belts.

46
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:42,736
What about Tim?
The fancy Escalade?

47
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:46,612
I don't know, thinks I sold
him some bad dope or something.

48
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:50,783
Did ya'?

49
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:52,014
Probably.

50
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:57,552
Damn it, I forgot my wrenches.
I'll be right back.

51
00:05:57,627 --> 00:06:00,289
I'll go, all right?

52
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:02,456
All right.

53
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,943
Fucker.

54
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:18,139
Well, hello, Cody.

55
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:22,812
Shade.

56
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:24,877
Haven't seen you
in awhile.

57
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:26,546
Yeah I've just been
laying low

58
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:29,091
after all that drama
went down last month.

59
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:30,820
It's by the heater.

60
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:33,294
And don't forget those
are my tools,

61
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:34,955
you guys are always
losing my stuff.

62
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:36,931
All right. Yeah.

63
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,662
What did you do yourself?
Really?

64
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:42,762
Again? Ugh, get over here.

65
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,171
No, I'm fine. I gotta go.

66
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:47,232
No no, over here now.

67
00:06:52,348 --> 00:06:57,843
Ugh. Off, come on.

68
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:00,856
Come here.

69
00:07:00,924 --> 00:07:03,757
Put your
hand there.

70
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,711
Gimme that.

71
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:27,807
Now you should
really consider

72
00:07:27,884 --> 00:07:32,719
changing up
your lifestyle, buddy.

73
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:38,489
Yeah, I don't think change is
much of an option for me, Shade.

74
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,894
I worry about you, Cody.

75
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:47,463
What are you doing?

76
00:07:47,537 --> 00:07:51,564
Sh. You know you can tell
a lot about a person

77
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:54,007
just by reading
their palm.

78
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:56,409
What does mine say?

79
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,812
I have no idea.

80
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:02,180
Haven't gotten that far
in the book yet.

81
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:04,083
Gimme my hand back.

82
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:13,251
Tomboy wannabe palm reader who
looks like a cover model.

83
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:15,661
God just insists
on giving me lunatics

84
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,757
for family members,
doesn't he?

85
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:20,759
Look good?
How do I look?

86
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:23,237
Amazing, go get 'em.

87
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:25,365
I'll see you
at the party tonight?

88
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:26,840
Yeah.

89
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:32,873
Yeah.

90
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:39,518
I love you, cuz!

91
00:08:52,035 --> 00:08:53,627
Its not getting
enough gas!

92
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,406
We gotta hit the road "Code,"

93
00:08:57,473 --> 00:09:00,738
takes three hours almost to
get up to the farmhouse.

94
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,074
I know how long it takes.

95
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:05,307
All I'm saying is your mom
and Shade left awhile ago

96
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:08,373
and you know how your mom
gets when we're late.

97
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:11,386
That's trouble
I don't want.

98
00:09:11,454 --> 00:09:13,149
It's not gonna happen
today, Cody.

99
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:15,281
Just leave the bike here,
we'll fix it tomorrow.

100
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:18,327
Okay, stuck with you
fucking clowns.

101
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:53,656
Come on man, lighten up,
it's your mom's 50th birthday.

102
00:10:11,347 --> 00:10:13,542
Whew!

103
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:16,244
All right.
Let's party.

104
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:24,726
Man, it's a damn shame no one
really comes up here anymore.

105
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:27,786
Place just sits
up here empty.

106
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:30,492
We had some good times,
didn't we, brother?

107
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:33,034
Good times.

108
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:34,694
Yeah.

109
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:37,399
Elroy, back in the day,

110
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:40,408
this place was the spot, man.

111
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:42,910
I'm telling you,
gambling, drugs,

112
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:46,676
back door business,
no cops.

113
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:49,411
Had my first hooker up here.

114
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:51,043
I was 12.

115
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:54,852
See these boys?

116
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:57,392
Hey, boys!

117
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,550
Oh!

118
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:25,451
How's my prince?

119
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:27,045
Happy birthday, Mom.

120
00:11:27,123 --> 00:11:29,591
Oooh.

121
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:37,957
How you doin',
Uncle Linus?

122
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,968
Good to see ya'.

123
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:42,266
Oh.

124
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:47,439
I didn't really know you
were going to be here

125
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,978
It's my mom's
birthday, Michelle.

126
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:52,105
Yeah.

127
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:57,175
You remember Dave, right?
He's my old man now.

128
00:11:59,822 --> 00:12:01,585
We've met before, right?

129
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:04,558
Yeah, like three times.

130
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:08,586
Well Michelle, six months.

131
00:12:08,664 --> 00:12:11,724
You sure move on
quick, don't ya?

132
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:13,666
Hey, Cody, Cody.

133
00:12:13,736 --> 00:12:16,398
Get your mom a drink.

134
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:17,962
Happy birthday.

135
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:21,638
Get your mom
a drink, boy.

136
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:24,407
It's stupid in here.

137
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,311
Come on.

138
00:12:34,323 --> 00:12:37,087
Hey, what's up?
Haven't seen you around here before.

139
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,650
My name's Elroy, I
wrench for Cody and Q.

140
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:42,289
Hi.
I'm Megan.

141
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:45,095
Damn shame no one comes
around here anymore.

142
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,931
Back in the day this
used to be the spot.

143
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:48,800
Really?

144
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:50,668
Mm.

145
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,868
That's odd. I can't recall
seeing you here before.

146
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:55,808
H uh?

147
00:12:55,878 --> 00:13:00,679
You know, since my dad's an
original member and all.

148
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,344
Don't try
so hard, rookie.

149
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:13,690
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

150
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:40,705
Your Uncle Linus
isn't feeling real well

151
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:43,251
so I gotta
get him home.

152
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:45,116
Love you, baby.

153
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:49,386
And be good.

154
00:15:13,315 --> 00:15:14,748
Fuck you man I

155
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:16,785
Hey! Hey!

156
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:19,116
Not in my house, hey!

157
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:42,510
You don't remember me, do you Cody?

158
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:46,139
Megan. Michelle's
little sister.

159
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:49,514
Megan.

160
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:53,214
How long
has it been?

161
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:58,693
Um, I think I was 17 the
last time I saw you.

162
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:02,162
Just  before
I left for school.

163
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:04,665
How'd that
work out for you?

164
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:07,999
I graduated last semester.

165
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,662
Right.

166
00:16:15,311 --> 00:16:18,007
Anyway, I heard it
was your mom's birthday

167
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,810
so I tagged along
with my sister.

168
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:23,875
Sorry it didn't
work out between you guys.

169
00:16:23,953 --> 00:16:26,581
Seven years is a long time.

170
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:32,389
And well, now she's running
around with that douche bag.

171
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:39,100
Well.

172
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:41,102
I just wanted to say hi.

173
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,263
Um, I should probably
go find Michelle

174
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:46,137
before she leaves me
stranded once again.

175
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:50,903
Megan.

176
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:58,282
Couple years back
when I got locked up,

177
00:16:58,354 --> 00:17:03,417
I knew it was you that
sent me those letters.

178
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:06,290
Thanks for the beer.

179
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:08,853
It was good to see you, Cody.

180
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:28,581
Better take off
man, it's getting late.

181
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:31,449
Hey.

182
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,147
Let's get
outta here.

183
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:34,450
Yeah?

184
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:42,493
Yo, man, everybody's leaving.

185
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:45,125
You want me to drive Mama?

186
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:47,465
Don't be stupid.

187
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,745
Yoo hoo!

188
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:09,354
Hey, have you guys
seen my sister?

189
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:12,656
Oh, my God, honey, it
is an angry college person.

190
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:22,268
Are you kidding me?
Did she leave?

191
00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:24,932
Maybe she went
on a beer run.

192
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:29,273
Maybe she did, except that there's
nothing around here for miles.

193
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:34,510
Do you guys mind if I
catch a ride with you?

194
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,313
Sure thing honey, but
you better get comfortable

195
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:38,819
'cause we ain't leaving
till the morning.

196
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:41,013
Are you serious?

197
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,115
Do I look serious?

198
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:46,161
I'm sorry, baby, but everyone's
already left.

199
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:47,889
Sorry, baby.

200
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:51,399
Well, who's that?

201
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:54,630
You better go find out
if you want a ride...

202
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,934
Hello?

203
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:31,833
Anyone out there?

204
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:55,185
Crazy mother
fucker, your old man.

205
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:58,124
Sick one.

206
00:20:58,193 --> 00:20:59,455
Yeah.

207
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:00,825
Here.

208
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:07,962
What were we,
like 5 and 10?

209
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:09,664
Something like that.

210
00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:12,468
Born into The Crew.

211
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,476
Bred to be fearless.

212
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:17,273
All we've ever known.

213
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:19,541
All we've ever known.

214
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:24,382
Look, I know this
is going to sound like

215
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:27,889
some club
house bullshit

216
00:21:27,956 --> 00:21:30,322
but the old timers,

217
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:34,522
They want you to do
a chump border run.

218
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:37,121
Prove your loyalty
to the Crew.

219
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:40,032
Is that right?

220
00:21:42,704 --> 00:21:47,038
Border runs are for
rookies and prospects.

221
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:51,307
I was born in.

222
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,977
I've given my life
to The Crew.

223
00:21:59,221 --> 00:22:04,591
You fucked up bad, man.

224
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,061
You exposed us.

225
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:13,033
You know we're not in a position
to mess with the damn Russians

226
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:15,161
or the Gangbangers.

227
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:23,877
And if I refuse?

228
00:22:23,946 --> 00:22:28,747
What do you want me
to say, Cody?

229
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,384
Help me.

230
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:41,220
Help me!

231
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:16,657
Wake up.

232
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:20,395
Please, wake up, Michelle.
Just wake up now.

233
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:23,768
You're going to be okay.

234
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,500
No, we can't just leave them.

235
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:27,405
You know how far the
hospital is from here.

236
00:23:27,476 --> 00:23:29,273
Where were
you at?

237
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:38,478
Oh, shit.

238
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:40,317
What the f...

239
00:23:56,772 --> 00:23:58,034
He's dead.

240
00:23:58,106 --> 00:24:00,199
What the fuck?

241
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:04,268
What the shit man?
She didn't hit nothing.

242
00:24:04,346 --> 00:24:07,213
Well it had
to be something.

243
00:24:07,282 --> 00:24:10,012
How the fuck
did this happen?

244
00:24:12,554 --> 00:24:14,647
Maybe it was a bear?

245
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:17,692
Okay, don't talk, okay?

246
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,129
Not anymore, you aren't allowed
to talk anymore. Understand me?

247
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:27,862
Come on.

248
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:32,066
Come on!

249
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,631
Fuck!

250
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:43,678
Oh.

251
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:54,490
This shit's
not working, man.

252
00:24:54,563 --> 00:24:56,929
Put it in neutral, Elroy.

253
00:25:11,513 --> 00:25:14,573
Oh honey, what on
earth are you doing?

254
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,912
Come on!

255
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:17,884
It's fucking dead!

256
00:25:17,953 --> 00:25:21,252
The fuck do you
mean my truck is dead?

257
00:25:21,323 --> 00:25:25,384
That thing was running perfectly,
Cody, I swear to God.

258
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,927
Hold on,
hold on.

259
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:42,309
How is she?

260
00:25:42,377 --> 00:25:46,814
Could be
bleeding internally.

261
00:25:46,882 --> 00:25:49,646
She needs help, Cody.

262
00:25:49,718 --> 00:25:51,447
I'm working on that.

263
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,545
What do you mean?

264
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:59,317
We got
a serious problem.

265
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:01,294
Truck's not working.

266
00:26:01,363 --> 00:26:05,732
Everything's lined up,
it's just, just dead.

267
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,240
See what
I'm saying?

268
00:26:17,412 --> 00:26:20,245
This can't be happening, Q.

269
00:26:20,315 --> 00:26:24,945
It's way too far
to walk back to town.

270
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,956
We put somebody out on the
road, try to flag down a car.

271
00:26:29,024 --> 00:26:34,189
At 2 in the morning? We'd have better
luck just walking the 30 miles, man.

272
00:26:34,262 --> 00:26:36,230
Plus, we don't know
what's out there.

273
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:43,196
What about the old
hermit up the way?

274
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:47,173
Will you watch my sister for me?
I'm gonna go try my cell phone again.

275
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:49,608
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
no problem.

276
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:11,421
I'm sorry!
Is this okay?

277
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:19,933
Fuck.

278
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:22,799
You're, you're
okay with that?

279
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:25,128
Yeah?

280
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:26,469
Oh!

281
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,336
Ugh.

282
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,960
Get the fuck off of her!

283
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:23,190
Shade, get her
out of here.

284
00:29:35,844 --> 00:29:38,369
Shade, get something
to tie her down with!

285
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:40,380
Fuck you!

286
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:47,384
Mother fuckers!

287
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:13,806
Stop it!
You're hurting her!

288
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:17,885
Come on, gimme.

289
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:20,478
Hurry up Q, I don't know
how much longer I can hold her.

290
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:27,388
Holy fuck, she's strong.

291
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,294
All right.
Stop it!

292
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:43,203
What the fuck are you doing?
Just don't stand there, help him!

293
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:25,485
It's okay.

294
00:31:28,456 --> 00:31:29,582
Okay?

295
00:31:29,658 --> 00:31:30,716
Okay.

296
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:35,127
Elroy, hang
in there, man,

297
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:39,326
we're going to get you
some help okay, I promise.

298
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:48,837
Elroy's not gonna
make it another hour.

299
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,243
Fuck! I'm going to
kill that fucking bitch!

300
00:31:56,651 --> 00:31:58,516
You can't lose it, man.

301
00:31:58,586 --> 00:32:00,417
I need you here with me.

302
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:03,082
Don't fucking lose it?
Don't fucking lose it?

303
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:09,188
That cunt! She tried to kill Elroy.
See his fucking face?

304
00:32:09,264 --> 00:32:14,361
All we can do now is get
them out of here and get help.

305
00:32:14,436 --> 00:32:16,495
All right,
what are you thinking?

306
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:20,132
The old hermit lives a
couple miles up the road.

307
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:22,802
I'm gonna
hike it up there.

308
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:24,811
Doesn't have
a phone,

309
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:28,280
but maybe in the last six
months he's gotten a car.

310
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:31,113
It's worth a fucking shot.

311
00:32:31,186 --> 00:32:34,622
All right, I'll
stay on the truck.

312
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,360
Hey brother.

313
00:32:50,972 --> 00:32:53,463
Guess I forget

314
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:56,408
you used
to love that girl.

315
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:40,146
Wilmer?

316
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:45,686
Hey, old man,
are you in there?

317
00:34:56,664 --> 00:34:58,632
Wilmer?

318
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,498
Is that you?

319
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:34,892
Wilmer?

320
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:38,735
Is that you?

321
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:41,172
No!

322
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:46,407
You can't make me!

323
00:35:50,151 --> 00:35:51,413
You'll have to find
someone else!

324
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:59,256
Michelle?

325
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:07,828
Michelle?

326
00:36:09,304 --> 00:36:10,999
Shade?

327
00:36:15,443 --> 00:36:16,910
Why...

328
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:19,503
Why am I tied up?

329
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,038
You tried to eat
Elroy's face, honey...

330
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:25,608
What?

331
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:30,790
Where's Dave at?

332
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:33,349
It's okay.
It's okay.

333
00:36:33,428 --> 00:36:34,861
I've read about this.
Okay?

334
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:36,021
What?

335
00:37:37,525 --> 00:37:41,928
Do you think he had something
to do with Michelle and Dave?

336
00:37:41,996 --> 00:37:46,160
What did you get
yourself into, old man?

337
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:48,759
There's something inside you?

338
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:50,701
What is it?

339
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:54,765
Please, why are
you doing this to me?

340
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:57,333
What do you
want from us?

341
00:37:57,412 --> 00:37:59,437
Are you looking for someone?

342
00:37:59,514 --> 00:38:00,981
What?

343
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:02,346
What do you want?

344
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:07,014
Please Shade,

345
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:10,023
I don't... Something's...
Something's wrong!

346
00:38:13,394 --> 00:38:16,124
Michelle, come back to me!
Come on Michelle.

347
00:38:16,197 --> 00:38:18,290
Something's wrong with me!

348
00:38:20,368 --> 00:38:23,064
Q! Q! Q!

349
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:05,103
Q!

350
00:39:06,814 --> 00:39:08,941
Q!

351
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,851
Q!

352
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,030
What happened?

353
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,035
She got out.
She's in there.

354
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:34,432
Get back.

355
00:39:53,361 --> 00:39:55,295
I'm gonna end this now.

356
00:39:56,564 --> 00:39:58,623
Ah I

357
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:07,804
No, baby. No. No.

358
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,002
It's okay.

359
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:36,366
Shit, I don't like this, Q.
Where the fuck is she?

360
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,422
Where are you at,
you bloody bitch?

361
00:41:24,652 --> 00:41:26,552
Q.

362
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,589
Q?

363
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,988
The fuck happened?

364
00:41:34,061 --> 00:41:35,255
Michelle!

365
00:41:37,898 --> 00:41:39,661
What did you do
to my sister?

366
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:42,703
What did I do?

367
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,898
Bitch was in there
crawling on the ceiling.

368
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:50,103
Open the door.
I want to see her.

369
00:41:53,648 --> 00:41:55,741
Be my guest.

370
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:15,529
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

371
00:42:27,715 --> 00:42:29,979
Jesus.

372
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:32,417
How did she?

373
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:34,716
I think with those.

374
00:42:36,991 --> 00:42:38,891
Oh, fuck me!

375
00:42:43,064 --> 00:42:45,294
Oh Michelle,
we gotta clean you up.

376
00:42:46,901 --> 00:42:50,302
Yeah. I wouldn't do that.

377
00:42:50,371 --> 00:42:52,601
She gets a little touchy.

378
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:55,164
Oh, my God.

379
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,378
What the hell happened?

380
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:34,346
There's something
inside her.

381
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:37,748
Something really
fucking evil.

382
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,054
Time to abandon
ship, brother.

383
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:48,960
What are you
talking about, Q?

384
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:51,497
We've done all we can.

385
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:55,399
If we leave, they both die.

386
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,562
Can you live with that?

387
00:43:57,638 --> 00:43:59,799
I'm not
leaving my sister.

388
00:43:59,874 --> 00:44:02,172
We all know,

389
00:44:02,243 --> 00:44:06,703
that thing in there,
is not your sister.

390
00:44:06,781 --> 00:44:09,375
Shade's my
only priority now.

391
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,748
Shade is my blood.

392
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,583
You're my best friend.

393
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:19,683
But we are not leaving people here.
Do you understand me?

394
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,422
Cody's right, Q.

395
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:25,693
We gotta stay and help them.

396
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:28,200
I'm taking Shade,

397
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:30,703
and uh,

398
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:33,740
we're leaving now.

399
00:44:33,808 --> 00:44:35,673
Come on.

400
00:44:35,743 --> 00:44:39,372
I never took you
for a coward, Q.

401
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,919
Ugh!

402
00:44:49,457 --> 00:44:51,288
Was I the one,

403
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:54,122
was I the one who bitched
out to the East Bay posse?

404
00:44:54,195 --> 00:44:55,924
Admit it!

405
00:44:55,996 --> 00:44:57,759
Admit it!

406
00:44:57,832 --> 00:45:00,926
You fucked up last month
'cause you're the coward!

407
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:03,060
You're the coward!

408
00:45:03,137 --> 00:45:04,968
Cody, don't.
He'll kill you.

409
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:18,779
Come on I

410
00:45:24,225 --> 00:45:25,783
Come on.

411
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,884
Ugh!

412
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:46,470
Q! Don't!

413
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,589
You had enough?
You had enough?

414
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:33,891
What's it gonna be?

415
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:36,395
You know that
Cody once told me

416
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:39,728
that he only trusted
one person in this world.

417
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,700
I guess he was wrong.

418
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,402
Fine.

419
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:55,244
You let him
take care of you then.

420
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,218
What the hell?

421
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:30,742
Fuck!

422
00:48:30,811 --> 00:48:32,039
Fuck!

423
00:48:35,716 --> 00:48:38,617
Do you know why I
wrote you all those letters?

424
00:48:38,686 --> 00:48:40,916
'Cause Michelle wouldn't?

425
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:43,617
The park fair.

426
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:47,922
You took me there
when I was 13.

427
00:48:47,995 --> 00:48:51,453
Remember? You used to come
to town every summer.

428
00:48:51,532 --> 00:48:53,625
I was begging Michelle
to take me for weeks,

429
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:55,635
and all of a sudden
you showed up

430
00:48:55,703 --> 00:48:59,002
and you picked me up in that
ugly prime red car of yours.

431
00:48:59,073 --> 00:49:02,167
And no one could believe
that Cody McKay

432
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:04,676
picked me up
and took me to the fair.

433
00:49:04,745 --> 00:49:08,306
I was the coolest girl
in school for weeks.

434
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:11,977
All because
of a simple gesture.

435
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:17,046
I'm aware of all the
things you've done.

436
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:19,388
All the violence,

437
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,897
but between your uncle
and my dad,

438
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:26,398
and losing your father,

439
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:30,836
you never really had a
chance and that's not fair.

440
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:36,898
What is that?

441
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,193
Elroy!

442
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:55,489
Shit!

443
00:50:00,968 --> 00:50:03,436
You should not be up.

444
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:05,734
Hey, do you
have a beer?

445
00:50:05,806 --> 00:50:08,104
I don't think you want
a beer right now.

446
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:12,475
No no no, a beer
sounds amazing right now.

447
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:17,449
Sure, Elroy.

448
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,498
Yeah, oh, yeah.

449
00:51:05,566 --> 00:51:08,160
What are you doing
out here man?

450
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:11,932
What the fuck are you
doing out here, Dave?

451
00:51:12,005 --> 00:51:15,236
I don't know, man.

452
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:20,747
But it's been a really weird night.

453
00:51:20,814 --> 00:51:23,146
Me and, uh,

454
00:51:23,217 --> 00:51:25,242
Michelle.

455
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,817
We got hella high, bro.

456
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:38,262
What's the matter, Q?

457
00:51:38,332 --> 00:51:40,323
Shit man,

458
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,164
you were dead a few
hours ago, you asshole.

459
00:51:50,544 --> 00:51:52,842
What are we doing
after this?

460
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:01,986
Sh.

461
00:52:02,055 --> 00:52:05,149
You hear that?

462
00:52:10,864 --> 00:52:12,525
Elroy,

463
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,693
are you all right?

464
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:18,465
Why?

465
00:52:20,107 --> 00:52:22,200
Hey, what's that noise?

466
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,616
I don't
hear anything.

467
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:40,050
It sounds pretty.

468
00:52:40,127 --> 00:52:43,528
Like music.

469
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:50,094
Holy shit!

470
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,001
Hell, yeah!

471
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,406
Guys, the fucking
thing is working!

472
00:52:55,475 --> 00:52:57,102
What did you do?

473
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:59,236
I don't know, but who cares?
God!

474
00:52:59,313 --> 00:53:02,180
Hey, Shade.
I'm totally feeling better now.

475
00:53:02,249 --> 00:53:04,046
Are you all right?

476
00:53:04,117 --> 00:53:06,085
Elroy, we gotta get you
into the truck, okay?

477
00:53:06,153 --> 00:53:08,280
That sound,
its like that song,

478
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:10,619
what the hell
is that song?

479
00:54:17,691 --> 00:54:20,660
Thank you.

480
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:23,821
For what?

481
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:31,194
You saw me different.

482
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:33,637
Cody.

483
00:54:33,707 --> 00:54:36,107
It's gone dead.

484
00:55:41,575 --> 00:55:42,735
Ugh I

485
00:56:05,765 --> 00:56:08,359
Whoo! Come on big fella!

486
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:45,763
Hey.

487
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:50,071
Hey, hey, hey.

488
00:56:50,143 --> 00:56:53,510
Loverboy is awake!

489
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,275
Hey, loverboy.

490
00:56:55,348 --> 00:56:58,909
Oh I You looking for this?

491
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:03,848
All this sweet
puss loverboy,

492
00:57:03,924 --> 00:57:06,859
and you keep it to your self?

493
00:57:10,096 --> 00:57:11,563
Ah.

494
00:57:17,037 --> 00:57:18,595
What do you want?

495
00:57:18,672 --> 00:57:20,663
Want?

496
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:25,442
We just heard there's a
wild party here tonight?

497
00:57:25,512 --> 00:57:28,538
And we weren't
invited, now is that true?

498
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:29,547
H uh?

499
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:32,107
Who are you?

500
00:57:32,185 --> 00:57:36,053
Do you have any idea whose
house you just set foot in?

501
00:57:36,122 --> 00:57:38,488
All right, all right.

502
00:57:38,558 --> 00:57:43,621
All right. Before we all get into a
hissy fit and start raising a ruckus,

503
00:57:43,697 --> 00:57:46,461
you're right!
We should all go round the room

504
00:57:46,533 --> 00:57:49,866
and learn each other's names.
Proper like. Me first, I'm Vernon.

505
00:57:49,936 --> 00:57:52,336
This handsome
gentleman over here

506
00:57:52,405 --> 00:57:55,033
with the switchblade,
that's Jazz.

507
00:57:56,743 --> 00:57:58,233
I'm shy.

508
00:57:58,311 --> 00:58:02,304
Ba-dat-dat-dat-da-dat!

509
00:58:04,217 --> 00:58:06,481
Greetings and salutations.

510
00:58:06,553 --> 00:58:08,350
And that other
gentleman over there

511
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:10,981
with the earphones,
that's, Murderball!

512
00:58:11,057 --> 00:58:13,685
Murderball,
Murderball, Murderball.

513
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,252
He's a little
on the quiet side.

514
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,821
The two fine young
specimens in the back

515
00:58:19,899 --> 00:58:23,357
hanging out, that's
Trixie and Pussywagon.

516
00:58:23,436 --> 00:58:26,234
Hi, loverboy.

517
00:58:26,306 --> 00:58:28,604
Oh, they like you.

518
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:33,169
We're just a friendly bunch,
looking for a good time.

519
00:58:33,246 --> 00:58:37,376
The violent kind.

520
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:40,351
So, now, loverboy,

521
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,048
what's your name?

522
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:46,953
Ew.

523
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:50,795
What's you name. Hm?

524
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:53,298
Cody.

525
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:56,733
Cody. Now how 'bout the girls?
What's their names?

526
00:58:56,803 --> 00:58:58,634
Megan.

527
00:58:58,705 --> 00:58:59,763
Shade.

528
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,273
Megan and Shade.

529
00:59:02,342 --> 00:59:03,934
Now those are pretty names.

530
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,478
You see Megan
and Shade over there,

531
00:59:06,546 --> 00:59:09,913
they were scratching up ol'
Murderball so we had to wrap 'em up!

532
00:59:09,983 --> 00:59:14,079
Murderball just
looooves his plastic.

533
00:59:15,689 --> 00:59:17,589
Is it time yet, please?

534
00:59:17,657 --> 00:59:22,651
No, no Jazz it's not time yet.
Have some patience!

535
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:25,289
The show
hasn't even begun!

536
00:59:25,365 --> 00:59:28,664
Now, it's been real
nice meeting all of you. But,

537
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:32,398
this isn't all of you now is it?
Hm?

538
00:59:32,472 --> 00:59:35,805
I'll give you one more chance,
round up all your friends,

539
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:37,843
and get the fuck
out of here.

540
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:48,516
Wow, you said
that with such conviction.

541
00:59:48,588 --> 00:59:50,954
So hero-like.

542
00:59:51,024 --> 00:59:58,760
I count three of you, but I
feel like somebody's missing.

543
01:00:01,034 --> 01:00:04,595
Of the female persuasion.

544
01:00:07,841 --> 01:00:10,537
There's no one else.

545
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:15,714
Now, lying is a weakness Cody.
And you ain't weak!

546
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:19,309
You're a strong boy,
I can see it in ya.

547
01:00:19,386 --> 01:00:21,877
What do you want
from us?

548
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:24,446
We're here for the girl,
loverboy,

549
01:00:24,524 --> 01:00:26,549
Try and keep up.

550
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:31,723
You're not
touching either of them.

551
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:33,732
I don't think you're
in the position to negotiate,

552
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,031
and besides, we're not here
for Megan and Shade.

553
01:00:37,103 --> 01:00:39,367
We're looking
for the other one.

554
01:00:39,439 --> 01:00:41,202
Don't you fucking
touch my sister!

555
01:00:41,274 --> 01:00:43,037
Now there
is some truth!

556
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:45,077
Megan, you gotta stay quiet.

557
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:49,548
Sh.
Baby, we're not gonna touch her.

558
01:00:49,616 --> 01:00:51,550
We didn't come here
for your sister.

559
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:55,520
We came here for what's
inside of her.

560
01:00:57,557 --> 01:01:00,253
Michelle doesn't mean
harm to anyone.

561
01:01:00,326 --> 01:01:03,853
Michelle. Michelle!

562
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:06,262
Another pretty name.

563
01:01:06,332 --> 01:01:10,029
Girls! Put another
record on I

564
01:01:10,103 --> 01:01:11,764
This one's
a real drag. Whoo!

565
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:14,830
Time for some fun.
Some fun and games!

566
01:01:14,908 --> 01:01:16,933
Whoo! Nothing better
than fun and games!

567
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,843
Except for a good
ol' fashioned drag race!

568
01:01:23,516 --> 01:01:26,508
Ya'll like to dance, right?

569
01:01:41,801 --> 01:01:44,292
Hm.
Yeah, get in here Murderball.

570
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:46,702
Whoo!

571
01:01:46,773 --> 01:01:48,604
Whoo!

572
01:01:48,675 --> 01:01:51,269
Feeling good! Yeah!

573
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:52,777
Whoo hoo hoo!

574
01:02:07,994 --> 01:02:10,724
Whoo! Lemonade and
dancing, I love this country I

575
01:02:10,797 --> 01:02:12,560
It's enough!

576
01:02:12,632 --> 01:02:15,157
I don't think it is enough.

577
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:27,473
It's real simple,
just tell us where she is.

578
01:02:38,024 --> 01:02:41,084
Now's the real fun
and games, finally!

579
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,628
You let them go
and I won't hurt her.

580
01:02:43,696 --> 01:02:46,597
Her? Go ahead, see if I care

581
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:48,429
I said let them go, now I

582
01:02:49,602 --> 01:02:53,265
Okay Cody, we will.

583
01:02:55,942 --> 01:02:58,308
Ah!

584
01:03:00,446 --> 01:03:04,314
I'm digging your style bamalam
but you are wearing on me.

585
01:03:04,384 --> 01:03:07,353
Tell me where Michelle is.

586
01:03:11,391 --> 01:03:12,983
She's not here,
I swear to God!

587
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:16,153
Don't swear,
I don't like swearing.

588
01:03:35,214 --> 01:03:37,512
Is that all
you got, loverboy?

589
01:03:37,584 --> 01:03:39,552
Whoo!

590
01:03:42,455 --> 01:03:43,649
Whoo!

591
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:50,993
Leave him alone!

592
01:03:51,064 --> 01:03:52,395
Whoo!

593
01:03:52,465 --> 01:03:53,932
Stop!

594
01:03:56,936 --> 01:03:58,597
Whoo hoo hoo!

595
01:03:58,671 --> 01:03:59,501
I love this!
I'm coming!

596
01:04:03,776 --> 01:04:06,768
Hell, ladies, put
on some fighting music!

597
01:04:06,846 --> 01:04:09,440
You just earned yourself
another chance.

598
01:04:09,515 --> 01:04:11,676
A chance to kill me,
if you can.

599
01:04:11,751 --> 01:04:13,878
Whoo hoo hoo!

600
01:04:13,953 --> 01:04:15,113
Cody!

601
01:04:16,756 --> 01:04:19,281
Kick it up a notch,
Pussywagon! Yeah!

602
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:25,221
Hey, you ever see Jimmy Dean
in "Rebel"? Hm?

603
01:04:25,298 --> 01:04:27,289
Jimmy Dean and this tough
guy from another gang

604
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:30,427
get into a knife fight at the
Griffith Observatory in L.A.,

605
01:04:30,503 --> 01:04:32,130
It's a terrific film,
Cody, you gotta see it.

606
01:04:32,205 --> 01:04:34,469
Okay, come on, now.

607
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:38,977
You're the tough guy and I'm
good ol' James Dean, the hero.

608
01:04:39,045 --> 01:04:41,605
All right. Circle me
and attack.

609
01:04:41,681 --> 01:04:43,114
Whoo!

610
01:04:43,182 --> 01:04:44,809
Attack me! Yeah!

611
01:04:47,553 --> 01:04:49,578
You got it.
You got it. Okay, now,

612
01:04:49,656 --> 01:04:51,146
call me chicken.

613
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:54,660
Oh! No! Don't
swing at me yet.

614
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:57,321
Call me chicken!

615
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:00,231
You're a
fucking chicken!

616
01:05:00,299 --> 01:05:02,893
You shouldn't
have called me that!

617
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:04,664
Ugh.

618
01:05:04,737 --> 01:05:06,136
You get it, you get it.
All right now,

619
01:05:06,205 --> 01:05:07,968
Jimmy Dean swings again.

620
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:09,804
Whoo!

621
01:05:09,876 --> 01:05:13,471
Hey. Now, come on.
Come on.

622
01:05:13,546 --> 01:05:16,777
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
He's pretty good, huh, Jazz.?

623
01:05:16,849 --> 01:05:18,077
Whoo hoo!

624
01:05:18,151 --> 01:05:20,449
Oh!

625
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,923
I thought you'd
seen the film, Cody.

626
01:05:26,993 --> 01:05:30,258
No sticking, just a little
jabbing, that's all!

627
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:34,491
Fuck!

628
01:05:34,567 --> 01:05:36,364
Stop!

629
01:05:36,436 --> 01:05:38,700
I don't want
no trouble, okay?

630
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:40,363
Oh!

631
01:05:46,412 --> 01:05:48,937
Oh.

632
01:05:49,015 --> 01:05:50,778
Shade, Megan.

633
01:06:04,564 --> 01:06:07,795
[Strangers
laughing hysterically

634
01:06:17,443 --> 01:06:20,173
That's not how
the movie goes, Cody.

635
01:06:21,547 --> 01:06:23,242
Now that
was a nice try,

636
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:25,876
but I'm getting a little
bored with all this.

637
01:06:25,952 --> 01:06:27,681
Maybe our little surprise

638
01:06:27,754 --> 01:06:31,087
will help you remember
where Michelle is, huh?

639
01:06:37,897 --> 01:06:38,989
Hey.

640
01:06:39,065 --> 01:06:40,760
Come on Katmandu.

641
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,494
The show
ain't even over yet.

642
01:06:44,504 --> 01:06:46,836
You're fucking
with the wrong people!

643
01:06:46,906 --> 01:06:52,071
No, you are.
You have no idea what's coming, Shade.

644
01:06:55,081 --> 01:06:56,776
Hm.

645
01:06:56,849 --> 01:06:59,283
Ah.

646
01:06:59,352 --> 01:07:01,946
Please,

647
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:03,511
please, just let us go,

648
01:07:03,589 --> 01:07:05,079
Michelle has nothing
to do with you.

649
01:07:05,158 --> 01:07:06,682
Untrue! We had
an arrangement

650
01:07:06,759 --> 01:07:08,386
with the old man
down the road

651
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:09,553
but he didn't honor
that arrangement.

652
01:07:09,629 --> 01:07:11,119
And your sister,

653
01:07:11,197 --> 01:07:12,755
well your sister was just

654
01:07:12,832 --> 01:07:16,791
at the wrong place
at the right time.

655
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:18,302
You're crazy.

656
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:20,202
You're crazy!

657
01:07:20,273 --> 01:07:22,571
Man! Crazy!

658
01:07:22,642 --> 01:07:25,042
Women, more music,
and something upbeat.

659
01:07:25,111 --> 01:07:27,477
This place
is becoming real square.

660
01:07:56,509 --> 01:07:57,635
Ugh!

661
01:08:15,361 --> 01:08:18,023
Please, God.

662
01:08:18,097 --> 01:08:22,090
Please, just let us...
Just let us go.

663
01:08:22,168 --> 01:08:24,136
You think God
only listens to you?

664
01:08:24,203 --> 01:08:28,196
So selfish, Megan.
We got our gods too, you know,

665
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:31,710
just as real.

666
01:08:31,777 --> 01:08:36,043
And you know what, let me let
you in on something else.

667
01:08:36,115 --> 01:08:40,779
If there is a God,
guess what else exists.

668
01:08:49,228 --> 01:08:51,389
Leave her alone.

669
01:08:51,464 --> 01:08:55,059
You don't scare us with
your stupid "Manson" shit.

670
01:08:55,134 --> 01:08:59,127
Shade. Sh.
They aren't who they say.

671
01:08:59,205 --> 01:09:03,904
What? Huh? I can hear
you, pretty girl.

672
01:09:03,976 --> 01:09:07,036
We're not...
We're not what?

673
01:09:07,113 --> 01:09:10,139
You don't know
what we are?

674
01:09:12,385 --> 01:09:15,013
No. No. You don't.

675
01:09:15,087 --> 01:09:18,921
We have been waiting
for a long time.

676
01:09:18,991 --> 01:09:22,927
Dormant for more than sixty years.

677
01:09:22,995 --> 01:09:27,364
And we are not trying
to scare anyone, Shade.

678
01:09:27,433 --> 01:09:32,063
It's just, what's
coming,

679
01:09:32,138 --> 01:09:35,869
Something is gonna
happen that can't be stopped I

680
01:09:35,942 --> 01:09:40,902
And you get to witness the birth firsthand.
I'm so excited! Hm.

681
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:43,778
Fuck you, you delusional dick, fuck!

682
01:09:43,849 --> 01:09:47,945
Such ugly, ugly words
from a pretty, pretty girl.

683
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:52,389
You are never gonna find a man with
a mouth like that, are you, Shade?

684
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:55,621
Or will ya? Speak of the devil!
Whoo!

685
01:09:55,695 --> 01:09:57,253
No!

686
01:09:57,330 --> 01:09:59,457
No! No! I'm gonna
fucking kill you,

687
01:09:59,532 --> 01:10:02,057
you fucking dick-head! No!

688
01:10:02,134 --> 01:10:03,965
I'll kill you,
you fucking bastard I

689
01:10:04,036 --> 01:10:06,402
Someone needs to shut her
trap, she is wearing on me!

690
01:10:06,472 --> 01:10:07,268
Fuck you!

691
01:10:08,975 --> 01:10:11,876
Oh, thank you, Trixie.

692
01:10:11,944 --> 01:10:13,605
Who is this?

693
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:16,147
Who could it be?

694
01:10:18,651 --> 01:10:21,643
Oh. Oh, oh, oh I

695
01:10:21,721 --> 01:10:25,316
Ain't so pretty
anymore, is he?

696
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,564
We don't know where
she is, goddamn it I

697
01:10:33,632 --> 01:10:34,963
Ugh.

698
01:10:43,009 --> 01:10:46,172
Yeah!
Fuck him up, Vernon! Whoo!

699
01:10:46,245 --> 01:10:48,145
What?

700
01:10:48,214 --> 01:10:50,512
What?

701
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:52,574
Stop! Stop the music ladies.

702
01:10:52,651 --> 01:10:54,744
What did you
just say, Jazz?

703
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:57,846
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, Vernon.
I didn't mean to cuss, man.

704
01:10:57,923 --> 01:10:59,823
You're sorry?
Well, sorry ain't good enough, Jazz.

705
01:10:59,892 --> 01:11:01,826
That's five in the swear jar, now.
Five! Now!

706
01:11:01,894 --> 01:11:04,362
Five in the swear jar.

707
01:11:09,535 --> 01:11:11,662
We gotta take responsibilities
for our actions, don't we?

708
01:11:11,737 --> 01:11:13,034
Yes, sir.

709
01:11:13,105 --> 01:11:14,595
Yes, we cannot
be like them.

710
01:11:14,673 --> 01:11:15,469
No, sir.

711
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:16,405
No.

712
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:24,378
It's gonna be
okay, Jazz.

713
01:11:29,088 --> 01:11:33,457
You could put an end to all this Cody,
all you gotta do is tell us where she is.

714
01:11:37,696 --> 01:11:39,027
Get out of here!

715
01:11:39,098 --> 01:11:40,861
Whoo!

716
01:11:40,933 --> 01:11:43,458
Fuck you, I'm
gonna kill you I

717
01:11:43,536 --> 01:11:45,800
Jazz, shut her down.

718
01:11:52,812 --> 01:11:55,576
Hey, Cody, you ever wonder
what's wrong with the world?

719
01:11:55,648 --> 01:11:57,673
You ever wonder how to change it?
H uh?

720
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,980
You're fucking dead.

721
01:12:16,001 --> 01:12:17,593
Cody I

722
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:19,433
I love this cat I

723
01:12:22,108 --> 01:12:24,008
Is it finally time, Vernon?

724
01:12:24,076 --> 01:12:26,601
It is, Jazz. It is.
Whoo hoo!

725
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:29,045
Murderball!

726
01:12:32,284 --> 01:12:34,878
Where has my head been?

727
01:12:34,954 --> 01:12:38,890
I completely forgot,
we put her in the bathtub I

728
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,851
I am such a dummy.

729
01:12:42,928 --> 01:12:44,190
Now I know
what you're thinking,

730
01:12:44,263 --> 01:12:45,924
Vernon, you're a fibber!

731
01:12:45,998 --> 01:12:48,523
You knew this whole
time she was here.

732
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:52,628
Guilty as charged. But we needed a
safe place for Michelle to incubate,

733
01:12:52,705 --> 01:12:56,539
so we really did have
some time to kill.

734
01:13:00,379 --> 01:13:02,313
Whoo hoo hoo whooo!

735
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:05,544
Michelle.

736
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:10,215
What the fuck?

737
01:13:10,289 --> 01:13:12,314
This is how the
world's gonna end, Cody.

738
01:13:12,391 --> 01:13:14,222
It's okay,

739
01:13:14,293 --> 01:13:16,284
she just doesn't
recognize her own yet.

740
01:13:16,362 --> 01:13:18,421
What
did you do to my sister?

741
01:13:18,497 --> 01:13:20,931
Your sister, well,

742
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,436
she's not really your sister
anymore now, is she? No.

743
01:13:24,503 --> 01:13:28,337
You see,
Michelle is the host,

744
01:13:28,407 --> 01:13:31,399
to what you might
call our queen.

745
01:13:31,477 --> 01:13:34,241
But that title doesn't really
give it justice,

746
01:13:34,313 --> 01:13:38,443
now does it, Jazz? No.

747
01:13:38,517 --> 01:13:41,452
Line 'em up in the front row.
I don't want anybody to miss this.

748
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,250
I am so excited for you to see
this, especially you, Cody.

749
01:13:44,323 --> 01:13:48,817
It is gonna to be solid,
gold, fantastic.

750
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:26,723
Meg.

751
01:14:26,799 --> 01:14:29,063
We gotta figure out

752
01:14:29,134 --> 01:14:31,864
a way to get you
out of here.

753
01:14:31,937 --> 01:14:33,700
I'm not gonna leave you.

754
01:14:33,772 --> 01:14:36,297
Look at me,

755
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:38,400
I'm done.

756
01:14:38,477 --> 01:14:40,240
Hey I

757
01:14:40,312 --> 01:14:43,213
Shut your mouth.

758
01:14:45,818 --> 01:14:49,811
You wouldn't want
me to do something awful.

759
01:14:49,888 --> 01:14:52,914
Screw you.

760
01:14:52,992 --> 01:14:55,552
You just might.

761
01:14:55,628 --> 01:14:57,493
Jazz, get over here.

762
01:14:57,563 --> 01:14:59,724
Yeah.

763
01:14:59,798 --> 01:15:02,665
Keep an eye on her,
would ya?

764
01:15:08,173 --> 01:15:11,336
Help us.

765
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:16,677
I can tell, you're
different from everyone else.

766
01:15:16,749 --> 01:15:19,684
Just  let us go.

767
01:15:35,267 --> 01:15:39,533
Please, just let us go.

768
01:16:05,497 --> 01:16:07,260
She's something,
ain't she?

769
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:09,665
All right, boys.

770
01:16:09,735 --> 01:16:13,637
Grab our friends and bring 'em over here.
It's time to bee-bop-a-loobop.

771
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:27,676
Well, we want to
thank you all for everything.

772
01:16:27,753 --> 01:16:31,245
It has been a wild ride.

773
01:16:31,323 --> 01:16:34,486
Cody, Megan, Quentin,

774
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,654
ya'll sure do know how to
have a real swell time.

775
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:41,131
But, all good things
must come to an end.

776
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,963
Michelle.

777
01:16:43,035 --> 01:16:45,970
Oh, you really don't
understand, do you? H uh?

778
01:16:46,038 --> 01:16:48,836
You gotta let her go.
Michelle's gone, baby.

779
01:16:48,907 --> 01:16:51,307
But something brilliant
is taking her place.

780
01:16:51,377 --> 01:16:55,279
You're not even human!
You're a devil! A monster!

781
01:16:55,347 --> 01:16:57,212
Do you even
know what is happening?

782
01:16:57,282 --> 01:16:59,842
Look around you
at what is happening.

783
01:16:59,918 --> 01:17:03,854
Your stories of gods and monsters
and devils and angels and,

784
01:17:03,922 --> 01:17:06,550
where do you think
they come from? H uh? H uh?

785
01:17:06,625 --> 01:17:10,857
They come from the void.
The blackness, in-between the stars, Cody I

786
01:17:10,929 --> 01:17:15,957
Out there where time doesn't
exist! From our kind.

787
01:17:16,034 --> 01:17:20,733
Oh, these fragile bodies

788
01:17:20,806 --> 01:17:24,469
you decided
to dwell in.

789
01:17:24,543 --> 01:17:28,809
These small moments

790
01:17:28,881 --> 01:17:32,510
of emotion

791
01:17:32,584 --> 01:17:35,314
So strange.

792
01:17:35,387 --> 01:17:40,552
Oh. Oh.
This feeling,

793
01:17:40,626 --> 01:17:43,720
is this love?

794
01:18:02,848 --> 01:18:06,944
You're gonna have to deal with
some unpleasant shifts in time.

795
01:18:07,019 --> 01:18:12,047
But dig, you're gonna see
the beauty of the moment.

796
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:16,319
This is for Shade.

797
01:19:31,436 --> 01:19:33,836
Murderball, finish him off.

798
01:20:42,941 --> 01:20:45,171
You're not gonna see
the grand finale?

799
01:20:47,846 --> 01:20:50,610
You're gonna have to kill me
before I let you get to her.

800
01:20:50,682 --> 01:20:55,449
All this killing and
violence, so unnecessary,

801
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,217
but it seems to be the only
thing you people respond to.

802
01:20:59,291 --> 01:21:03,955
I'm not gonna kill you, Cody.
I came to see you off.

803
01:21:04,029 --> 01:21:06,020
You left
without saying goodbye.

804
01:21:06,098 --> 01:21:09,090
We had a real good time
with ya, didn't we?

805
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:11,567
Lotta kicks, real fun.

806
01:21:11,637 --> 01:21:17,132
But, now, I got some more serious
stuff I gotta take care of.

807
01:21:19,611 --> 01:21:24,742
You see, I like you, I do.
In fact, I like you both,

808
01:21:24,816 --> 01:21:28,752
which is why
I'm gonna let you go.

809
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:31,948
Trust me, I'm not
doing you a real favor.

810
01:21:32,024 --> 01:21:35,323
What's coming down
now is a far worse fate.

811
01:21:35,394 --> 01:21:37,988
Something you can't imagine.

812
01:21:38,063 --> 01:21:41,760
You see, your kind
is a dying breed.

813
01:21:41,833 --> 01:21:45,064
The human kind.

814
01:21:47,339 --> 01:21:49,534
All right then.

815
01:21:52,644 --> 01:21:55,340
I almost forgot.
You can go ahead and take our wheels.

816
01:21:55,414 --> 01:21:58,008
We got no use
for 'em anymore.

817
01:21:58,083 --> 01:22:02,486
Oh, plus Murderball drank all the
gasoline in your pickup truck.

818
01:22:02,554 --> 01:22:07,082
Good luck. You're gonna need it.

819
01:22:16,501 --> 01:22:20,301
It's gonna be a beautiful day!

820
01:23:17,896 --> 01:23:19,921
Stay with me.

821
01:23:19,998 --> 01:23:25,197
Don't fall asleep.
I'll get us some help.

822
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:28,034
Stay awake.

823
01:23:28,106 --> 01:23:30,267
I'm awake.

824
01:23:34,012 --> 01:23:36,173
Megan.

825
01:23:36,248 --> 01:23:38,682
Thank you.

826
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,980
For what?

827
01:23:43,021 --> 01:23:44,921
A simple gesture.

828
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:48,187
You saw me different.

829
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:50,694
Thank you.

830
01:23:54,533 --> 01:23:57,832
I'll be right back. Okay?

831
01:24:38,577 --> 01:24:42,104
Cody.

832
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,774
It's gone dead I
