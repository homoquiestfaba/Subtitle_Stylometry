1
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,090
What about the mess hall retard?

2
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,580
Her name is Tanakoff.

3
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,840
The less she knows the better.

4
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,630
All we need her for is access to
the kitchen then she is cut lose.

5
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,680
I don't know man. This whole
plan just seems kind of fucked.

6
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,550
Look we only get one shot at this.

7
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,710
One time.
That is it. Just one chance.

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,260
It just seems halfassed you know.
I just I don't think it's gonna work.

9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,060
What the fuck isn't halfassed
to you private?

10
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,990
It's the dyke.

11
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,390
Tartakoff.
He's got a thing for the dyke.

12
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,630
Is this true Riggs?
You have a thing for Retardakoff?

13
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,230
She ain't a dyke.

14
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,890
Admit it.
She wants your cock in her orifices.

15
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,120
Fuck you man!
Fuck you!

16
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,780
Riggs! Is that it?

17
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,760
She is not a combat solider alright. I do not
feel right using her like we are doing.

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,460
Yeah were all being used solider.
Her no more than any of us.

19
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,190
Now I need to know
are you in or out?

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,550
Are you in?
Or are you out?

21
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,580
Alright. Im in.

22
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,110
Yeah motherfucker!
Alright!

23
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,210
Quit it man! Quit it!

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop!

25
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,290
Don't move a muscle.
Fucking trip mine.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,640
Oh shit.

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,920
Sergeant check your feet.

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,880
I'm fine. It's not me.

29
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,370
Shit.

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,540
You are on a motherfucking
landmine.

31
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,150
Looks like Riggs won't be joining us
unless we need an amputee or something.

32
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,070
Hey, fuck you man! If you hadn't pushed me
I wouldn't be on this thing!

33
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,410
Riggs! Riggs! Easy okay?

34
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,280
My face is a little too fucking close
to this so I'm kind of attached to it.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,380
Let me have this.
Thank you.

36
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,650
Okay.

37
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:46,280
Okay, when this detonator springs we
have about a half a second to bat it off.

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,420
Like baseball. Fun.

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,310
Yeah. Only we get one swing
and one pitch. That's it.

40
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,450
Uh, that does not sound like too
good of an idea sir.

41
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,500
- Anybody play baseball?
- Sir that does not sound like a good idea.

42
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,080
I am pretty good at Wii.

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,320
Oh yeah? Who the fuck are you?
Johnny Damon?

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,350
No way man. His long hair made
him look like a gay lumberjack.

45
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,990
Who does not look gay to you?

46
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,810
- Dude it's just my gaydar.
- Do you have a problem...

47
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,840
-...with homosexuals being in the Army?
- Not at all man!

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,640
Hey guys! Get me the fuck
off this mine!

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,130
No, I know. I'm working on it.

50
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,400
Jesus Christ.

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,520
Okay. So um...

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,070

54
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,990
You're the jump off pan.

55
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,110
Maybe I should I will pull him off.

56
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,430
- I will pull him this way.
- I don't know if--

57
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,350
- No, I don't think that's gonna--
- No I've done it before. It's okay.

58
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,450
No, let him jerk you
off. He'll get off on it.

59
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,830
Come on I will give you a little
momentum. Pull you off. come on.

60
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,040
Alrighty on the count of three
you wanna count?

61
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,160
Yeah, maybe you should
count to three.

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,690
But you have to ask yourself is
this where you wanna fucking die?

63
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,820
I'm not gonna count.

64
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,070
He cant count to three.
Come on. You count.

65
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,750
- No I'm swinging.
- Count of three. Your count.

66
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,290
Im not gonna count.

67
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,130
- Let me count it out.
- You count to three.

68
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,420
- Okay, I will count. come on.
- On three. It's on three.

69
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,370
So it's one two and then go.
Right? One two go.

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,010
Ready? Okay. One two three!

71
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,260
That was kind of anticlimactic.

72
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:31,730
<i>♪ Oh beautiful forspacious skies ♪
♪ for amber waves of grain. ♪</i>

73
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,580
<i>♪ For purple mountain majesties... ♪</i>

Twenty three years and I'm

79
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,750
They'll have to drag me out
kicking and screaming boys.

80
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,400
The President is going to come out
here and we are going to be enjoying

81
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,960
Thanksgiving turkey with him.

82
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,700
I'm so nervous.
I've always wanted to meet him.

83

Ready for some turkey?

84

special ingredient.

87

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,870
Sergeant secure the area!

173
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,800
What's she doing here?
What the fuck are you doing here?

174
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,060
I'm sorry I just didn't
know where to go.

175
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,530
Are you brain dead Tartakoff?
We told you to stay away from the kitchen!

176
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,630
Can somebody tell me
whats going on?

177
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,790
Should I waste her sir?

178
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,860
No! Hey!

179
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,760
Stand down sergeant! No one's
getting wasted, not yet!

180
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,750
Hey! I am your commander in chief!

181
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,870
I demand to know
what the fuck is going on!

182
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,460
Riggs! Chair!

183
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,680
Relax! Relax!

184
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,080
Mr. President,
you are being held prisoner.

185
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,980
By who?

186
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,890
Really?

187
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,550
By us dumb-ass!

188
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,650
This is an outrage.

189
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,140
Let me go now!

190
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,720
- Hold this! Neck! Balls!
- What is this?

191
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,010
That's duct tape sir.

192
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,610
Do you have any idea what
you've gotten yourself into?

193
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,500
Yes sir.

194
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,730
Yeah, then you understand the
gravity of your actions.

195
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,960
Do you see this uniform, sir?

196
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,070
Yes I do!

197
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,790
Those of us that wear it face death
every day prepared to die at any moment.

198
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,610
The question is are you?

199
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,900
Are you sir prepared
to die at any moment?

200
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,540
<i>Happy Thanksgiving!
Gobble gobble gobble!</i>

201
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,360
Riggs! You shoot anything
that comes through that door!

202
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Hey cheesedick!

203
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,020
Tanakoff! Make yourself useful!
Grab that med kit!

204
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,700
The President is alive and well
but you keep banging on that door

205
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,450
and it is gonna turn all
Peckinpah in here.

206
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,730
Riggs! Check all frequencies!

207
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,260
- Peckin what?
- Peckinpah. Film director.

208
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,560
Bloody Sam?

209
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,960
Where you from?

210
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,130
- Uh, Charlotte sir.
- Straw Dogs.

211
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,470
Fuckin Nazis man.

212
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,750
Is that for me?

213
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,300
Oh I don't know.
You'd have to ask Garrison.

214
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,250
- Right there.
- The Wild Bunch, 1969.

215
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,620
The Wild Bunch.

216
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,780
Jesus. come on.

217
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,580
Let's take a look at it will ya?
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

218
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,070
Let's go!
Got your headphones?

219
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,090
Yes sir.

220
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,730
- Whats your first name?
- Alexandra sir. Alex for short.

221
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,040
That's a pretty name.
My first puppy was named Alex.

222
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,820
Really?

223
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,680
Yeah, very smart dog. Obedient.
Did whatever I told him to do.

224
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,930
Now why do not you be
obedient and untape my hands.

225
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,220
Do not talk to him.

226
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,170
You oughta apply to NASA Tartakoff.

227
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,680
You're that smart.
Medical kit!

228
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,100
Show me your lag.

229
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,640
What do you think?
That Im not prepared to die?

230
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,410
I get death threats every single day.

231
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,830
But you know what the thing is?

232
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,580
I expect it to come from
whackos and terrorists!

233
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,070
Not from U.S. soldiers who have--
Oh ow! Ow!

234
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,070
We're Army Rangers, sir.

235
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,470
Looks like it passed through the
soft tissue and didn't hit any bone.

236
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,970
Tough old cowboy like you?

237
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,760
You oughta be able to shrug
this off no problem.

238
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,890
So who shot me son?
Was it you?

239
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,290
Hard to tell in a firefight
who shot who, sir.

240
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,240
If you like we can measure it
from the inside

241
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,250
and narrow it down based
on possible caliber.

242
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,340
Or we can shoot a hole in the
other leg and see if it matches.

243
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:16,780
Garrison talk you into this son?
Because you are so fucked!

244
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,310
I suggest you direct all
questions to me Mr. President.

245
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,500
I don't know what you are after soldier
but it's not gonna work.

246
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,940
Did you miss the pan about us
being Army Rangers, sir?

247
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,720
Hold him.

248
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,120
Ow! Ow shit!

249
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,700
It's gonna feel like a little
mosquito bite there Mr. President.

250
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,930
Oh my God!

251
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,220
Strong one isn't he?

252
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,050
Tartakoff, let me make this
perfectly clear.

253
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,770
You can leave now but you are facing
almost certain court martial.

254
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,430
That's to say you don't get shot
to shit walking into that hallway.

255
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,120
So the million dollar question is...

256
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,940
do you want to stay
or do you want to go?

257
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,530
I'll stay.

258
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,200
The man in that chair, he is not
your president, he is not your friend.

259
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,820
He is nobody.
I am your commanding officer.

260
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,220
- Hooah?
- Hooah.

261
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,510
And under my command that
means no complaining,

262
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,690
no freaking out and
no fucking whining.

263
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,690
Yes sir.

264
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,580
What did you inject in me?

265
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,220
Acetonitrile derivative.

266
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,010
Less than two hours it'll induce a
chemical paralysis in your brain.

267
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,670
 It will lead to cranial hemorrhaging.

268
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,590
What?

269
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,220
Blood vessels in your brain will
rupture first causing blindness,

270
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,150
excruciating pain, leading
to paralysis and death.

271
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:56,670
Of course you can have the antidote but
only if you cooperate.

272
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,710
Cooperate?

273
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,850
Cooperate with what?
I don't even know why I'm here.

274
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,440
Hear anything Riggs?

275
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Not much. Mostly just fighting
about whos in charge--

276
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,520
the military or the
Secret Service.

277
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,490
Fighting and bureaucratic bullshit are about
the only two things can rely on out here.

278
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,910
Downey! Boob tube!

279
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,270
Tartakoff! Med kit!

280
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,810
This is Captain Hank Garrison.
Anyone copy?

281
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,700
I say again this is
Captain Garrison. Copy?

282
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,650
<i>- We hear you over.</i>
- Identify yourself.

283
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,010
This is Agent Stenson of
the Secret Service.

284
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,140
Is POTUS with you?

285
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,530
<i>Affirmative. The President of the
United States is here he is safe</i>

286
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,390
and relatively unharmed.

287
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,300
<i>What is it you want
Captain Garrison?</i>

288
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,350
For right now I just want you to
stay the fuck out and cooperate.

289
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,860
I will cooperate
<i>as long as The President remains unharmed.</i>

290
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,910
We need confirmation he is safe.
We're sending in a medic.

291
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,720
<i>Negative.</i>

292
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,060
You send in the Civi news crew.

293
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,440
<i>The British chick and her cameraman.</i>

294
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,710
- I don't think that's possible.
- Yes it is. You just try asking them.

295
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,540
Standby.

296
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,610
Let them send in a medic.
I need a real doctor alright?

297
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,100
Who the hell is this Garrison?
Give me some stats on him.

298
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,940
Sorry sir there's no medics
available.

299
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,390
Casualty of your latest cutbacks.

300
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,070
<i>Okay, Melody Stone and cameraman</i>
Steve Ullmer are heading in.

301
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,170
Only two are allowed in.
I see anyone else

302
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,260
<i>and we kill them all.
Copy that?</i>

303
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,800
Copy.

304
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,830
<i>It's the moment you've been
waiting for.</i>

305
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,820
<i>The best day of your life
with that special someone.</i>

306
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,750
<i>The gin of your dreams.</i>

307
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:34,400
<i>So you pledge your love knowing
that this moment is forever.</i>

308
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,160
<i>And then the ultimate nightmare!</i>

309
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,220
<i>Dumped at the altar!</i>

310
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,810
Eh his heart's been broken.
What a damn shame.

311
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,230
Doesn't look like they know
about us yet.

312
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,420
Let's go!

313
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,480
Come on! Come on!
Tight fit! Come on in!

314
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,970
Come on! Tight fit! Tight fit!

315
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,510
Welcome!

316
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,140
Welcome!

317
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,190
Check em!

318
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,670
<i>I mean he was an okay
fuck and all but he always wanted</i>

319
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,600
<i>to do it in the ass and I was
like no way.</i>

320
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,880
<i>You gotta go down on me
if you want some of this.</i>

321
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,490
They're clean sir.

322
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,180
Let's see your pretty faces.
Come on.

323
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,150
Hang on!
Who are you?

324
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,940
Im Steve.
Im camera.

325
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,260
Bullshit! It was a different
cameraman in the mess hall!

326
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,140
- Who is he?
- Hes the cameraman.

327
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,350
A cameraman?

328
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,220
No he is my cameraman.

329
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,890
Any weapons on him? A wire?

330
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,030
Man just leave her alone!

331
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,460
Shut the fuck up!
Was I fucking talking to you?

332
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,250
The camera!
What's in the camera?

333
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,480
I don't know.
It's just a camera!

334
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,100
Maybe you care to explain this
little doodad there Stevie.

335
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,870
Ah man, they just gave
me that camera.

336
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,380
Look at him! He's one of their own!

337
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,020
Clean shaven! Secret Service!

338
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,850
This wasn't my idea!

339
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,560
All of you need to fucking stand down!
You think you're gonna get away--

340
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,780
Head or chest SteveO?
Head is more efficient but sometimes messy.

341
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,780
Stand down Sergeant.

342
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,210
Son of a bitch.

343
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,480
He could be useful.

344
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,690
Melody Stone.
Get me on the air.

345
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,660
I'm sorry?

346
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,780
I want to be live on the air now.

347
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,800
I do not have that authorization.

348
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,220
Surely we're more important
than that shit!

349
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,320
<i>Yeah, I mean the Walmart dude
said it was the best ring they had.</i>

350
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,840
This show gets really
good numbers.

351
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,420
Do it!

352
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,290
Uh, we're on a military base!
I need clearance from them!

353
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,360
Jesus fucking Christ we have
The President of the United States hostage!

354
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,950
I'm sorry. I cant do anything.

355
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,140
I haven't got my cell.

356
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,910
You really are Tit is McGhee.

357
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,760
Garrison for Stenson. Over.

358
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,640
<i>This is Stenson. Over.</i>

359
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,970
<i>I want to be live. On the air. Now.</i>

360
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,940
I want this camera broadcast live.

361
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,910
<i>Negative.</i>

362
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,750
I do not have the authorization.

363
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,890
Are you guys fucking kidding me?

364
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,920
<i>You make this camera broadcast live</i>

365
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,060
or you bring in a dozen fucking shovels
to clean up the body pans when we're done!

366
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,830
<i>Standby.</i>

367
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,250
See what you can get.

368
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,890
Hey! You realize the only
thing you are going to

369
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,400
accomplish here is embarrassing
yourself and the United States?

370
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,960
Mr. President!
Did they hurt you?

371
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,400
No one speaks unless spoken to!
Riggs! Come on!

372
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,500
Don't worry sir.
We're gonna get you out of here.

373
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,580
Shut the fuck up!
Stenson!

374
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,740
You have 5 minutes
to get me live feed!

375
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,820
<i>Garrison it's not that easy.</i>
There is a lot involved.

376
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,300
They're not gonna
work with you.

377
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,580
We don't negotiate with terror--

378
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,270
Sorry Steve.

379
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,560
You fucking maniacs!
You fucking--

380
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,490
Sit the fuck down!

381
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,120
Shut the fuck up.

382
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,940
<i>What was that?</i>
Garrison?

383
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,830
<i>Garrison, was that gunfire? Over!</i>

384
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,410
Standby.

385
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,980
I didn't have anything to do with this.
I'm just a reporter.

386
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,380
Please. You've seen
me on the TV before.

387
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,670
I just did what they told me to!
Please!

388
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,300
Steve is dead.

389
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,700
<i>Now give me my live feed.</i>

390
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,600
<i>Let me hear The President's voice.</i>

391
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,450
You're gonna say this
is The President. I'm okay.

392
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,660
<i>This is The President.</i>

393
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,310
This is more fun than
a Texas rodeo.

394
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:32,230
That was real cute.
Now get me my live feed.

395
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,000
<i>Give me 10 minutes.</i>

396
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,160
You got three. Out.

397
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,700
What are you doing?

398
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,020
Get up.

399
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,090
What I'm doing is something they should
have taught you in Journalism 101.

400
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,340
Ask real questions, expect real answers.

401
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,350
You just killed an unarmed
American in cold blood.

402
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,430
Killed a lot of people.
Novelty wears off after awhile.

403
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,680
Negative sir.
I still enjoy it every time.

404
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,990
You see Downey here is your best
friend in a battle.

405
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,850
He has an instinctive knack for killing.

406
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,830
Of course you wouldn't want him
around in the civilian world.

407
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,100
He'd probably just get bored

408
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,090
and start a shooting rampage in a
shopping mall or some other place.

409
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,600
KFC. Bigger targets there.

410
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,980
You think this is funny?
This is sick.

411
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,660
Sick to you. Reality to us.

412
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,130
You see Steve here?
That to us is nothing.

413
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,620
We have lived through the worst
neckdeep shit you can imagine.

414
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,020
Stuff that would make your pampered
collagen head spin right the fuck off.

415
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,230
But you wouldn't know about
that would you?

416
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,230
No because we have never seen your
types out in the places we have to go.

417
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,780
You report about these wars from your cushy
comfy airconditioned studios.

418
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,370
Well honey
welcome to Bumfuck Iraq.

419
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,420
I don't use collagen.

420
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,100
Sir. I could use the camera.
I used to be an AV tech in school.

421
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,270
Outstanding.
Let's see what you can do private.

422
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,810
Downey. Put Steve on ice.

423
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,070
Nice shoes Steve.

424
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,680
Riggs?

425
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,970
Yeah?

426
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,400
Are you okay?

427
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,810
Yeah Im fine.

428
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,360
Hey! Tartar Sauce!
Let's go! They patched us in.

429
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,740
<i>This is Adrian Davis.</i>

430
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,050
<i>We have interrupted your regularly scheduled
programming to bring you breaking news.</i>

431
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,520
<i>The President of the United States</i>

432
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,820
<i>has been kidnapped in the green
zone in Baghdad Iraq.</i>

433
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,970
You set?

434
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,250
<i>We're going live right now.</i>

435
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,860
Okay Mr. President.

436
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,330
Hey it's warm in here.

437
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,870
Yes sir it is.

438
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:40,200
Please. Focus and
say hello to the outside world.

439
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,890
I am The President of the United States.
I'm being held hostage.

440
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,360
Very good sir. Very good.
Outstanding job. Come on.

441
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,590
This here is Melody Stone.

442
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:57,130
She is usually cast as a cleavage-baring
ovely opinionated talking head on cable news.

443
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,320
Today she is in
the middle of the shit with us.

444
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,050
Oh shit. Am I allowed to
say shit on the news?

445
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:01,810
No.

446
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,080
Oh fuck. Maybe we can edit that
out can't we?

447
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,830
Tell me Melody Stone,
what is your assessment here?

448
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,390
I'm in a kitchen in the green zone

449
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:13,690
and The President is being held
captive by several U.S. soldiers.

450
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,140
Army Rangers!
Hooah!

451
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,320
Excuse me.
Army Rangers.

452
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,350
And do you see any terrorists in here?
Any guys with camels?

453
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,910
Any turbans?

454
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:29,970
No guys with turbans or camels.
Just soldiers, the president and me.

455
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,200
And what is the condition
of The President?

456
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,380
He has a leg wound but other
than that I do not know.

457
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,960
I'm not a doctor.

458
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,690
And neither was the hack who put
in those lopsided tits of yours.

459
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,400
The fuck?

460
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,370
They injected me
with something.

461
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,230
Wait sir!

462
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,190
Wait! Hold.

463
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,680
Go ahead.

464
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:58,840
Put a needle in my neck.
Some acetonotrilsomething. I dunno.

465
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,480
- Acetonitrile sir.
- Yeah.

466
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,450
<i>It's a derivative.</i>

467
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,060
<i>Yes, The President has been injected</i>

468
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,050
<i>with a timed release substance
that will kill him in an hourand a half.</i>

469
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,250
<i>The correct antidote is rare
but I have it in one of my many pockets.</i>

470
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,150
<i>It's in a glass container.</i>

471
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,750
So if I get shot or even perchance

472
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,130
fall down there is an excellent chance
that it will shatter.

473
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,610
So tune in later for
must-see TV!

474
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,020
Will somebody shut him up?

475
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,750
I've tried Mr. President.
Feel free to give it a shot though.

476
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,800
<i>Once again this is Adrian Davis.
Breaking news.</i>

477
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,120
<i>The President of the United
States has been kidnapped</i>

478
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,490
<i>by four U.S. Army troops.
That's correct.</i>

479
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,810
<i>American Army Rangers have taken
The President of the United States hostage</i>

480
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:46,030
<i>in a kitchen in the green zone in Iraq
during a Thanksgiving dinner.</i>

481
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:49,930
<i>We have absolutely no idea why--</i>

482
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:58,290
<i>Alright Im just being told that
there was a handgun hidden in side.</i>

483
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,190
<i>They are just telling me right now</i>

484
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,870
<i>there was a handgun hidden
inside a Thanksgiving turkey.</i>

485
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,310
<i>Hopefully we'll have some information
coming to us pretty soon.</i>

486
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,310
Sir!

487
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,310
Cut it. Cut the camera.

488
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,820
They're trying to get
through the vent shaft.

489
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,270
Private show me.

490
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,010
Right there.

491
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,310
Ready to roll?

492
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,940
Don't look up.

493
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,790
Oh!

494
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,300
I told you not to look
at the ceiling.

495
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,580
This is Garrison for Stenson.
Over.

496
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,280
Pick up the fucking radio!
Garrison for Stenson. Over!

497
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,310
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

498
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,310
What? You think we didn't
expect you to use the vents?

499
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,990
Come on Stenson!
Who do you think we are?

500
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,940
<i>Grayson and Jones are dead!
Everyone pull back!</i>

501
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,910
Those were two good
Americans you killed.

502
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,580
I had a Jones once in my unit.

503
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,640
Had his leg blown off
and severe head trauma.

504
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,560
<i>He will spend the rest of his
life in and out of VA hospitals.</i>

505
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,230
<i>I think your
Jones is better off.</i>

506
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,380
This has to stop.

507
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,020
I agree. Your three guys are
dead because of you!

508
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,810
<i>So the sooner you stop trying to
fuck with us</i>

509
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,820
the sooner this will all be over! Copy?

510
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,620
<i>Do you copy?</i>

511
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,790
I Copy.

512
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,090
Garrison out!

513
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,130
You put bombs in the vents?

514
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,500
Yeah. I was in charge of the tact team that
cleared the area for The President's arrival.

515
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,290
Camera. Makes you feel all
safe and snuggly doesn't it?

516
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:42,150
There is no security. Boo!

517
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,530
Come on! Stan the camera.

518
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,710
Welcome back to America's funniest
home away from home videos!

519
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,830
Let's go.
Let's get The President.

520
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,450
Come on.

521
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,870
<i>What do you got sir?</i>

522
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,650
You don't think I
feel them also?

523
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,280
I'm responsible for these soldiers.

524
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,390
I know the names and faces and families
of everyone Mo's died for this country.

525
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,270
That must be so taxing
on you sir.

526
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:14,060
No. do not take this
lightly soldier.

527
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,150
Every one of them died for something
this country asked them to do.

528
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,780
Something that I
asked them to do.

529
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,310
Did you say asked?

530
00:29:20,336 --> 00:29:21,810
<i>Did he say asked?</i>

531
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,970
<i>So we can opt out at any time?
We can just pack up our shit and go home?</i>

532
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,450
Fuck yeah! Let's get the
fuck out of here!

533
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,940
I'm going to Disneyland.

534
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,820
That's nut what I meant.

535
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,880
Mr. President, have you ever
had to stuff the intestines

536
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,020
of your best friend back
into his own body?

537
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,960
Many soldiers have made
great sacrifices, son.

538
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,480
That still does not
justify your actions.

539
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,260
Do you know who this man is sir?

540
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,820
No I do not.

541
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,430
Neither did I. I slit his throat
a few months ago though.

542
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,340
Yup. Tums out he is got a wife
and two daughters just like you, sir.

543
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,730
Any particular reason why
this man was on a hit list sir?

544
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,220
We do not have hit lists.

545
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,250
We don't. So there is no particular
reason why this man was killed then?

546
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,440
How about this fella?

547
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,150
There are many things about war
that are unpleasant

548
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,700
but I trust the capable people in charge on
the ground will come up with

549
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,310
tough but good decisions.

550
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:34,030
Just like you trusted the capable folks
about the links to Al Qaeda and WMDs.

551
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,090
Pesky things, those WMDs.

552
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:39,790
It's annoying when things don't
turn out the way Jesus intended.

553
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,370
It wasn't Jesus's fault.
It was nine.

554
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,590
But I thought you were divinely
guided by God's own hand sir.

555
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,410
And to be human is to err.

556
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:53,200
So what's the point of
having Jesus as your guide

557
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,840
if you're just going to
fuck up anyway?

558
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,420
What does religion
have to do with this?

559
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,730
I do not know. You tell me. You're the one
who is shoving it down our fucking throats.

560
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,150
Because it sure as shit
isn't written in the Constitution.

561
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,840
You should read it some time.

562
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,810
<i>Mistakes have been made.
But our core beliefs</i>

563
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,360
<i>and the determination of our young
men and women in uniform</i>

564
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,350
<i>will show in time that
our cause was just.</i>

565
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,330
Where do you get this shit from?
Do you stuff this crap up your ass?

566
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,070
Sir!

567
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,000
Turn the camera off.

568
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,710
What is it?

569
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,670
Nothing. That is just it.
All radio communications are stopped.

570
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,970
I ain't heard
nothing the last couple minutes.

571
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,700
Well they must have figured
out we have been listening in.

572
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,940
How's the perimeter mic?

573
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,190
- Mr. President?
- Yeah.

574
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,020
I'm sorry this is happening.
And I just wanted to say

575
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,120
if we don't get out it has been an honor
absolute honor to be here with you, sir.

576
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,640
It is still working but it only picks
up noise 25 feet from the main door.

577
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,130
Thank you Melody. And by the way
I think your tits are fine.

578
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,040
Honestly?

579
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,880
Yeah yeah. And my
wife loves your show too.

580
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,360
Well that is better than a porcupine
stuck up our ass isn't it?

581
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,730
Keep listening.

582
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,310
<i>Captain Hank Garrison.</i>

583
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:01,610
<i>Captain Hank Garrison is the
ringleader in this hostage situation.</i>

584
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,300
<i>Garrison apparently requested
one of our best and</i>

585
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,980
<i>our brightest Melody Stone in
there with him.</i>

586
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,820
Mr. President I was just wondering if it was
possible to get an interview at some point--

587
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,430
What the fuck is going on?

588
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,710
Im sorry. We were just
making small talk.

589
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:22,140
I do not care what kind of talk it was.
Shut the fuck up.

590
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,350
Tartakoff.

591
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,090
Up. Up!

592
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,180
- Are you pan of this team?
- Yes.

593
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,820
Yes sir!

594
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,880
Then you gotta watch out for this.
You have to be alert.

595
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,900
I want you to let me know the moment
these two do or say anything.

596
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,300
- Is that understood?
- Yes sir!

597
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,090
- Good. You're a heck of a soldier.
- Thank you sir.

598
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,000
Where are you going
with all of this?

599
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,700
We have all heard about the soldier's
sacrifice the civilian deaths the WMDs.

600
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,490
Taliban in my basement.

601
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,350
Surely you didn't go through all
this trouble just to rehash...

602
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,970
...something that could easily be discovered
in the archives of the New York Times.

603
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,750
Would you prefer to talk about
the economy? Afghanistan?

604
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,280
How about uh the auto industry, sir?
So many great legacies.

605
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,340
Hey I'm not afraid to die.

606
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,090
If I get killed on the
battlefield sewing my troops

607
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:23,800
 it will counter everything
you are trying to do.

608
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,290
I will be a hero.

609
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,410
And finally live up to your
dad's expectations.

610
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,270
And what's that
supposed to mean?

611
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:36,240
I read your book Mr. President.
I was struck by one particular story.

612
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,090
When your father said to you

613
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:43,040
"An honest man can see the lies leaving
his mouth like steam from his breath."

614
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,030
I wonder what he meant by that.

615
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,150
Should I be getting this, sir?

616
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,660
I do not intend for you to die, sir.

617
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,820
But you will feel pain though.
As we do. We feel pain every day.

618
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:06,230
Pain and rage.
I can't live with myself anymore.

619
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,050
I do not know how you do.

620
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,860
Get the camera.

621
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,780
Let's go.

622
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,680
So where were we?

623
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,300
You can't tell me any reason
why these men were killed?

624
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,150
Talk to your commanding officer.

625
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,200
You are my commanding
officer, sir.

626
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,760
Th at is why I am talking to you.

627
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,470
Your immediate
commanding officer.

628
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:38,080
You want to ask me why any particular
person here has latrine or garbage duty?

629
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,680
I'm not responsible for
everybody giving orders.

630
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,070
No. How about the orders to
ignore UN weapons inspectors?

631
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,430
Orders to set up
detention camps?

632
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,880
That's an old story Captain.
You want to blame that on me go ahead.

633
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,940
Hell blame everything on me, alright?

634
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,130
Are we done now?

635
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,990
No. We are not done.

636
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:59,430
We're still stuck in this endless
fucking hell hole with no exit plan.

637
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,970
Tell me sir. How do you explain this
quagmire to your children?

638
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,090
I give them the facts that the
news fails to report.

639
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,450
Jesus Christ.
I can't win with any of you.

640
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,370
I tell them about the hospitals
and the schools being built.

641
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,200
About democratic
elections free markets.

642
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,960
Electricity where there was
no electricity once before.

643
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,550
You mean like the electricity
that is killing soldiers in showers

644
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,060
because of shoddy work by
shitty overpriced contractors!

645
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,500
Contractors who were
your pals before the war!

646
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,940
Ah come on you know as well
as I do mistakes are going

647
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,110
to be made when you're
rebuilding from scratch!

648
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,930
Who asked for any of this?

649
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:39,350
This was supposed to be the war on terror,
on terror.

650
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:42,190
Not the war on whatever the fuck you
say it is after the fact.

651
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:45,560
I made choices I had to make
to keep America safe!

652
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,910
Like ensuring that levees and
bridges are properly maintained.

653
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,010
No ensuring that terrorists did
not attack us on our own soil!

654
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,370
Oh by signing off on torture?

655
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,970
- No, we do not torture!
- We don't?

656
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,490
No, we interrogate.
America does not torture!

657
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,610
- Is that right sir?
- Yeah, that's right!

658
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,760
Shut off the camera.
Stand up.

659
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,450
- Why?
- I said stand up!

660
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,510
He's been shot in the leg.
He shouldn't be standing.

661
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,140
You shut your cakehole!
Stand up!

662
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,190
Walk over to the sink!

663
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,440
Why?

664
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,430
You've heard of
Abu Ghraib haven't you?

665
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,730
Oh yeah what are we gonna
rehash that now?

666
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,850
No. We're gonna relive it.

667
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,300
Fucking contractors.

668
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,500
What the hell--

669
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,940
Riggs! Riggs! Lend a hand!
Tartakoff! Grab a rifle!

670
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,340
You're on guard! Up!

671
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,580
Let's go! Up!

672
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,650
Table! Bring it under!
You just relax.

673
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,280
Relax Mr. President.

674
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,910
Everything were about to do you
personally approved so it's all perfectly safe.

675
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:46,450
And legal.
Hey, how about some music huh?

676
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:51,140
How about some mu sic? Yeah!
Sergeant! Grab a towel!

677
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,280
Now we're talking!

678
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,650
Ah! And oldie but a goodie.

679
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,530
I get it. Yeah.

680
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,390
This is a joke, huh?
Come on stop! Stop!

681
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,710
I get it!

682
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,790
Riggs! Grab your rifle.

683
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,900
It's a joke right?

684
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:12,420
Come on!
Hey! Hey hey hey! Stop!

685
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,220
Stop it now!
Stop it now!

686
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,650
Downey fresh.

687
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,330
You do not need to do this!

688
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,410
Please! Don't do this!
Ah!

689
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:28,240
Fuck yeah! It don't Gitmo
better than this motherfucker!

690
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,100
Imagine being haunted by the
faces of the people you killed

691
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,960
day after day, night after night.

692
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,730
Not knowing who they were or
why you killed them.

693
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,510
I killed them on their way home
from work, coming out of mosques.

694
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,300
Collateral damage, oh that's all
okay as long as you hit the target!

695
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,410
We all have friends that we have seen get
killed or maimed in every way possible.

696
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,800
Stop it!

697
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,390
You want us to shut that off?

698
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,450
Stop it!

699
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,910
Mr. President, when you've been
in hell long enough you become the devil!

700
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,960
So consider this your cleansing.
Your exorcism!

701
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,030
Or your fucking baptism!
I don't fucking care!

702
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,430
Jesus, you are killing him!

703
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,380
Hey prez. You might like to know that the
water you are choking on is contaminated.

704
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,290
That's due to the no bid contractors

705
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,170
who were overpaid to do the
piping and water treatment.

706
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,310
So you can thank them
for that tasty flavor.

707
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,230
Please stop it. Please.

708
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,290
Still it's not neany as bad as
some of the shit they call food.

709
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:13,450
You know sometimes we had to wait three hours
in the fucking desert for food to arrive.

710
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,870
Have you ever had muddy spaghetti before?
Crunchy mashed potatoes?

711
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,160
Mmm good!

712
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,470
Had enough yet?

713
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,620
Water in the lungs stings
doesn't it sir?

714
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,260
So what do you think your father meant?

715
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:38,350
When he said "An honest man can see the lies
leaving his mouth like steam from his breath."

716
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,650
What do you care?

717
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,920
What do I care?
Why don't I do this again sir?

718
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,000
No. No, no, no, no, stop.

719
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:58,630
My family had a cabin in Minnesota
we'd go to in the winter.

720
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:04,720
I was 10 years old and my mother
forbade me from walking on the frozen lake.

721
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,330
I promised her I wouldn't.

722
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:12,020
But I did anyway because I
liked to go ice fishing.

723
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:18,060
My father caught me and he punished me
by making me shovel snow for hours.

724
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,750
He loved metaphors.

725
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,940
And he said that the steam coming from
my mouth were the lies of an honest man.

726
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:30,920
I tried to hold my breath for a
long time to make the lies go away.

727
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:35,720
But it kept coming back.

728
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:40,100
And reminded me of my wrong.

729
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,010
You see?
Hey Riggs!

730
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,180
What?

731
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,600
How come you are not
talking to me?

732
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,440
I've been busy.

733
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,210
We've got got The President
hostage and stuff.

734
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,880
I knew this wasn't a good idea.
You know the reason I came in here--

735
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,840
You know I gotta listen to
what's going on out there.

736
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,540
Riggs, if you would
just listen to me!

737
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,160
Every little sound,
every little noise...

738
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,880
Riggs! The reason I came in here
was because of you!

739
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,230
Son, you keep watching the door.

740
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,520
Tartakoff camera.

741
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,280
Yeah, yes sir.

742
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,980
Sergeant.

743
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,410
<i>Stenson for Garrison. Over.</i>

744
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,770
Go for Garrison.

745
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,090
What's going on in there?

746
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,970
Oh we're just playing
a little drinking game.

747
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,150
I need visual on The President.

748
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,910
Tanakoff let's roll.

749
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,030
<i>Welcome back America.</i>

750
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,880
<i>How you feeling Mr. President?</i>

751
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,800
<i>I'm fine. I feel better.</i>

752
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,920
- What the hell did you do to him?
- Nothing much.

753
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,930
<i>Garrison what the hell did you
do to The President?</i>

754
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,640
Nothing even close to torture.
Ain't that right Mr. President?

755
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,670
The deal was The President
was to remain unharmed.

756
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,270
You broke that deal a
longtime ago Stencil Dick!

757
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,310
Garrison if this continues

758
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,770
<i>we're going to need to use extreme force.</i>

759
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,910
I'm looking forward to that.

760
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,860
What are you trying to prove?
I still don't understand the point of all this.

761
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:18,000
That is a good question sir.
What is the point of all this?

762
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,910
I don't know soldier.
You brought me in here.

763
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,820
No sir. You brought us here.

764
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:30,270
Like a lot of people I was
sick to my stomach after 9/11.

765
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:37,140
I'm a patriot and I wanted bad to avenge the
deaths of those poor innocent Americans.

766
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,540
So I believed in you sir.
I trusted you, sir.

767
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,570
Now I may not have been a
professional athlete but I quit

768
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,950
a lucrative engineering job and
I recommissioned.

769
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:51,060
I know you're sick to death of looking at
these pictures because

770
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,070
I am too sir.

771
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,800
I am too.

772
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,760
Now I expected to be
going from cave to cave

773
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,970
looking for the bastards
who plotted those attacks.

774
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:07,510
I expected to be shot.
I expected to watch friends die.

775
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,650
But it'd be for a cause worth fighting for.

776
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:14,750
But you know what? Not a single one of these
motherfuckers had anything to do with 9/11.

777
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:20,940
Not one of these men had ever
planned to attack America. Ever.

778
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,000
So my question again sir.

779
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,060
Why was I ordered to kill these men?
Why are we here?

780
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:41,770
<i>I think it is highly unlikely that I'm going
to come up with an answer to satisfy you.</i>

781
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:44,130
On the contrary.
This is your one chance sir

782
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,620
to do something you have never done before.

783
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,950
To openly and honestly level
with the American people.

784
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:56,400
No dodging or grandstanding for the press.
Just the cold honest truth sir.

785
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,570
You know despite what you think

786
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:04,280
The President doesn't actually
have that much power.

787
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,140
A single term is four short years.

788
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,650
Lot of obstacles trying to move
through both legislative branches.

789
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:15,350
9/11 was a tragedy we all wish
we could have avoided.

790
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,420
But I'm gonna tell you something.

791
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:22,840
There wasn't a single soul in my
administration who feels otherwise.

792
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,360
Ow! Goddammit!
Is that that fucking soldier?

793
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,740
You're lucky Steve
only had two feet!

794
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,230
Downey knock it off.

795
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:36,040
Want me to answer these or not?

796
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,880
God yes, please sir.
Continue.

797
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,330
9/11 forced us to look
at the bigger picture.

798
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,460
<i>We had an opportunity to stop a rogue
regime and make our</i>

799
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,280
<i>presence felt around the wand
where trouble was festering.</i>

800
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,310
Everybody was on board.
Bipartisan.

801
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,560
Not a single decision
was made in isolation.

802
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,030
But your administration had a heavy hand in
forcing the issue and doctoring evidence.

803
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,820
We used the information available.

804
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,450
Yeah sure we emphasized evidence

805
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:02,130
that supported our position but
we did not doctor anything.

806
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,730
Did George Washington mislead his men
into fighting a war they couldn't win?

807
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:08,370
They ran from the British
army for seven years.

808
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,340
Not a popular item at the time either.

809
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,800
I didn't know you knew any
history Mr. President.

810
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,880
Yeah I didn't flunk
all my classes.

811
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,810
So let's just say that the
grand scheme of all of this

812
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,120
was to secure American
interests in hostile regions.

813
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,370
Was that the overall goal?

814
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,150
Longterm stability and security.

815
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,110
Okay, well how is security and
stability obtained when you

816
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:32,270
disband their entire military turning
loose half a million armed soldiers

817
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:34,460
who become the backbone of the insurgency.

818
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,940
We couldn't take any chances.
They were all members of a rogue regime.

819
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,670
<i>Happy Thanksgiving!
Gobble gobble gobble!</i>

820
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,190
For weeks after defeating
Saddam's pitiful resistance

821
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:50,280
we did nothing to restore order
and basic human necessities.

822
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,200
The top priority was to make a
mad dash for the oil wells.

823
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,760
The oil industry is the center of their
infrastructure and their economy!

824
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,050
It was vital that we
secure them immediately!

825
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:02,900
And while the country crumbled
and the insurgency took hold

826
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:07,430
assholes like us were sent in to
pick up the pieces.

827
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:12,340
These wounds they don't heal Mr. President.
Not ours, not theirs.

828
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:18,060
The anger will live on for decades.
Do you understand that?

829
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,940
Looks to me like you've
got all the answers.

830
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,280
Or at least the answers as
you believe them to be.

831
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,450
Gas!

832
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,190
You! You! Freezer!

833
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,440
- I don't have a mask!
- You don't need one. Go!

834
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,550
But what about The President?

835
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:38,520
He stays here with us!
You! Sit down!

836
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,680
Get in the fucking freezer!

837
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,420
Hey! Guard her!

838
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,130
Yes sir!

839
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:51,440
Hello everyone! Right now your
own beloved government is

840
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,560
pumping gas in here in
an attempt to incapacitate us.

841
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,570
Including your president. Fortunately
for us though we brought our gas masks.

842
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,980
Sadly we forgot
<i>to bring one for The President.</i>

843
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,670
<i>So given the trauma that
The President has already been through,</i>

844
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:11,100
even a small dose of an
incapacitating agent might be fatal.

845
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,910
Agent Stencil Dick of the Secret Service
if you're still watching...

846
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:19,850
I'd advise you to figure
out a way to reverse this.

847
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,190
Can you lower that please?

848
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,410
Thank you private.

849
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,160
So uh, how did you get into this?

850
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,780
Don't play no mind
games with me.

851
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,120
I'm not playing mind games. I'm
just asking questions.

852
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,210
That's what reporters do.

853
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:39,510
Cuz I'm on their side.
100%.

854
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,520
And whoose side is that?

855
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,620
Shit did he just move?

856
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,830
I don't think so.
Why did you join the Army?

857
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,040
I don't know.

858
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,400
Some of my friends were doing it and
it's better than working at Wendy's.

859
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,280
Is Riggs your boyfriend?

860
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,630
Riggs? No.
He ain't my boyfiiend.

861
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:58,930
He's just my buddy. You know.

862
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:02,050
Yeah yeah. I've got lots of guy
buddies back at the station too.

863
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:03,520
Yeah you mean like
guys you have sex with?

864
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,610
What? No! I do not have sex with them.
They are just my friends.

865
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,800
Oh. Right. Yeah.

866
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:13,740
Do you have sex
with your friends?

867
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:18,800
What? Me? No. Not all the time.
I mean no.

868
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,860
What's with all the
damn questions?

869
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,340
I'm a reporter.
I ask questions.

870
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,750
Oh.

871
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,120
Hows it looking Riggs?

872
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:37,380
Oh it's going down.
Still not totally safe yet though.

873
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,490
Yo Riggs. How long you
been nailing Tartakoff?

874
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,640
I'm not. I mean I haven't.

875
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,780
No worries bro.
I've boned lots of hoes too.

876
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,010
She ain't a ho.

877
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:03,750
Look man. When I was your age
anything with a hole was good to go.

878
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:09,880
So does she take it up the ass?
You gotta use the ass, man

879
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,270
because with the mileage on her the other
side is like fucking a glass of water.

880
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:15,340
Fuck you man!

881
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,550
Hey! Stand down!

882
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,720
I'm sick of this shit!

883
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,160
Sergeant go tug your turkey.

884
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,100
I think Captain Garrison is kinda right.
But The President is sorta right too.

885
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,110
I mean it is like how were we supposed to
know the Iraqis wouldn't be team players?

886
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:30,840
I mean know we kind of fucked up
some of their shit, but...

887
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,650
...we're trying to help
them and everything now.

888
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,540
I mean it's like show some
appreciation you know?

889
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:39,260
I mean it's like there is
no I in team you know?

890
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,920
Nope. And there is no
U in intelligence either.

891
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,370
What?

892
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:46,420
Oh forget it.

893
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,660
What? Oh.

894
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,660
<i>It's all clear, sir!</i>

895
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,090
Let's go.

896
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:58,420
Nice job Tartakoff.

897
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,370
Thank you, sir.

898
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,740
Keep an eye on her.

899
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,800
Looks like Saddams old chemical stockpile
finally went to some good use, huh, sir?

900
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:19,510
<i>We've just gotten word that
The Secret Service...</i>

901
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,260
Jesus I cant see.

902
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,840
<i>...flooded the room with tear gas.</i>

903
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,010
<i>We're trying to get an expert right now
to join us over--</i>

904
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,310
Come on just free
up my hands.

905
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,380
<i>satellite to--</i>

906
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,240
I still can't see.

907
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,950
<i>...give us some information on
the chemical makeup</i>

908
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,980
<i>of that substance and what the
effects can be on The President.</i>

909
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,200
Relax. It's just CS gas. It'll sting for awhile
but your body's gonna flush it out.

910
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,970
- On your feet.
- Why?

911
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:45,120
On your feet!

912
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,510
Shit.

913
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,550
Walk over there.
Riggs you set up over here.

914
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:52,700
Downey.

915
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,950
Come on, you're breaking
my fucking heart.

916
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,710
You want to know why your hands have
been duct taped to that stick sir?

917
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:02,720
Fuck off.

918
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,320
Infrared is being used to see
through those walls.

919
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,670
To them you look like a grunt.

920
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:11,470
I'd hate to be the poor dickhead
that shoots you thinking you are one of us.

921
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:12,590
May I sit?

922
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,020
No, you may not sit.

923
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,440
Sir, making prisoners stand
for extended periods of time

924
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,010
is another coercive technique
that you authorized.

925
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:23,350
Therefore it should be
perfectly acceptable.

926
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,380
Not when they're shot
in the goddamn leg!

927
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,900
Stand up!

928
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:37,690
Oh no actually sir, prisoners are often wounded
and fatigued when employing these techniques.

929
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,930
Stand up goddammit!

930
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,750
Can't I just lean against the--

931
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,490
Stand up!

932
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,890
Garrison stop him!

933
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,500
Cheer up buttercup.

934
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:05,750
I said stand up!

935
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,440
Tartakoff! Camera.

936
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,040
Act like a fucking man!

937
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,570
Alright I'm up. I'm up.

938
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,630
- Okay. Your turn.
- My turn for what?

939
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,400
Dildo torture. What do you think?
To ask him questions.

940
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,850
That's what you've been
waiting for isn't it?

941
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,090
I don't know what
you're talking about.

942
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:20,230
Oh come on that's the reason you
came in here isn't it?

943
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,570
No they asked me to.
I had to.

944
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:25,580
Right. Right. You had a choice.

945
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:29,610
You have free will. Could have
said no but you didn't. Why?

946
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,380
In case you had not noticed he's
The President of the United States.

947
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,260
It was a completely selfless act.

948
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,530
Nice. A silicone Mother Teresa.

949
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,450
Alright. It was an opportunity. Okay?

950
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:42,270
Well darling here's your
chance to prove to your mummy

951
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:45,560
and your daddy how truly awesome you are.

952
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,870
You are on.
Tartakoff get him.

953
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,070
I'm sorry Mr. President.

954
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,730
It's okay Melody. I'm with you.

955
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:00,930
So uh, where's the
First Lady right now?

956
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:06,060
The First Lady oh she's at the ranch.
Maybe having dinner I guess.

957
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,010
And how is she?

958
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,650
Ow! Fuck!

959
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:16,310
What kinda bullshit
questions are these?

960
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,880
I want tough questions.
I want real questions.

961
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,670
No fluff less smile.
Be nice to the camera.

962
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,740
Go.

963
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:34,020
Okay. Um so whose idea
was it to go to war?

964
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,420
It was a collective decision.

965
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,640
But who was pushing for it most?

966
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,760
The VP, the Secretary of Defense.
But ultimately the decision fell upon me.

967
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,330
And do you think that your
legacy will be defined by

968
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,620
failed domestic and
international policy?

969
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,740
I don't know Melody.

970
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,160
Do you think your legacy will
be defined by your cup size?

971
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,350
Did you know that
Saddam was preoccupied

972
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:07,050
with finishing his fourth
novel before the invasion?

973
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,000
Nice one. Keep coming.

974
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,600
This for real?

975
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,130
Crime thriller.

976
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:16,230
No, I didn't know that.

977
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:18,350
He was a fan of
American pulp novels.

978
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:21,580
Do you think it's possible that
if he was busy writing his book

979
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,530
that he wasn't thinking about building
a nuclear arsenal to attack us?

980
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,790
Yeah I also think it's possible he
was doing both at the same time.

981
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:31,430
I made a judgment call and we erred
on the side of keeping America safe.

982
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:35,110
He was a third-rate dictator whoose
country was ravaged by sanctions.

983
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,650
Now how do you think he would
have had the infrastructure

984
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,500
to build and deploy nuclear weapons?

985
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:47,190
Well Melody. In addition to his novel writing
apparently he had some other hobbies.

986
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,620
Like gassing civilians.

987
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,580
What are you doing?

988
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:55,510
No dodging!

989
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:04,880
Ask him about his dad.

990
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:16,210
So uh, what about your father?
Did he approve of the war?

991
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:19,210
Yeah, he thought Saddam
was a threat to peace.

992
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,570
Actually he was urging restraint.

993
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,820
He knew an occupation would
be an endless hell hole.

994
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,600
I can't do this.

995
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,200
No, you do not get to walk away!

996
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,460
You do not get to tum a blind eye
to the realities of war!

997
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:41,490
Pretend it's all clean and sanitized
and that horrible things don't happen.

998
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:43,590
Get up!

999
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:49,290
War doesn't create guys like Downey.
It just gives them a creative outlet.

1000
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,040
What were you neglected as a child?

1001
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,950
Violent video games not
satisfying enough?

1002
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:56,890
Not neany. I like to feel
the blood touch my skin.

1003
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:59,360
So in fact you owe
this all to me, huh?

1004
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,280
Because without this
war you're nobody.

1005
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:07,890
You're right. I have a strange way
of showing gratitude don't I?

1006
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,440
Then why are you in here?

1007
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,040
Why aren't you out killing women and
children if you like it so much?

1008
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,780
Because I figure by torturing
The President of the United States

1009
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,880
I will be the envy of sadists
for generations to come.

1010
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,950
Yeah, you're still a nobody.
You know that?

1011
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:26,070
That makes two of us!

1012
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,610
You know what?
Garrison doesn't even like you.

1013
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:35,880
He uses you because you're helpful.
Nobody likes you!

1014
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,980
- How can you let this go on?
- Easy Sergeant.

1015
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,510
Have you ever smelled your
own flesh burning fucker?

1016
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:44,240
Downey! Do not deviate
from the plan!

1017
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,700
Sergeant! Back down!

1018
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,790
Back down sergeant!
Sergeant! Sergeant!

1019
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,980
At ease sergeant! At ease!
Stand down!

1020
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,750
Stand down sergeant!
Stand--

1021
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:12,600
Fuck! Goddammit Riggs!

1022
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,830
You're out of your fucking mind.

1023
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,750
Get him off me!

1024
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:34,250
Breakit up! Break it up!
Break it the fuck up!

1025
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:36,300
Get off me!

1026
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,380
Come on! I don't have
time for this shit!

1027
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,680
You are jeopardizing the
mission sergeant!

1028
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:55,010
I always knew you were the fucking
weak pussymmipped fucking link!

1029
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:57,000
You piece of shit.

1030
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,010
You ugly--

1031
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:03,630
Fuck you Downey!

1032
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,510
Fucking--

1033
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,050
Fucking cunt!

1034
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:12,400
Call me a cunt again.

1035
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,970
Private.

1036
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,130
Come on.

1037
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:41,560
Fuck.

1038
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:50,630
You provoked him.

1039
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:53,120
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1040
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,780
Sir! They're getting
ready to break in!

1041
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,640
Rifles!

1042
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,250
Back away from
the door Stenson!

1043
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,830
Give me a visual on The President.

1044
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:07,130
Back away from the door first!

1045
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:16,350
What is that sound?

1046
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:17,670
They're backing away.

1047
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:19,820
Does anyone smell that?

1048
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,360
Up there!

1049
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:33,760
Stenson I need you
to turn this gas off!

1050
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,050
Goddammit Stenson!

1051
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:41,190
Down! Down! Down!

1052
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,200
Tanakoff! Get down!

1053
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,800
They're shooting
through the walls!

1054
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,940
Get down!

1055
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,660
Goddammit!

1056
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:03,180
Freezer! Freezer!
You two! Freezer! Come on!

1057
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:08,770
Now! Go! Move! Stay down!
Stay down! Riggs!

1058
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:15,810
Riggs! Riggs! Motherfuckers!
Fall back Riggs!

1059
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,410
Bring it on!

1060
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,050
Do not discharge your weapon!

1061
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,520
You're all fucking faggots!

1062
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:24,200
Riggs! Riggs!

1063
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,240
Fuck you!

1064
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,420
Riggs fall back!
Fall back Riggs!

1065
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:31,930
Fuck you!

1066
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,040
Point the camera.

1067
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,790
Isn't this over yet?
What more do you have to prove?

1068
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:53,200
My mission is almost complete.
Point the goddamn camera.

1069
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,190
<i>Mr. President
are you In there?</i>

1070
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,820
<i>Mr. President!</i>

1071
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,130
<i>Mr. President can you hear me?</i>

1072
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,420
The door is rigged like
the vents Stenson!

1073
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,420
I wouldn't touch it!

1074
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,220
<i>Mr. President!</i>

1075
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,190
Back away!

1076
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:12,420
I still have a gun and The
President, Stenson!

1077
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,730
Your antidote. Where is it?

1078
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:21,560
Oh uh, I must have forgot
that in the kitchen. My bad.

1079
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:28,270
You never had an antidote did you?
You just intended for me to die?

1080
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,650
Sugar water sir.

1081
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,940
What?

1082
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,940
It was sugar water, sir.

1083
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:40,260
That's another interrogation technique
that you and your cronies love. Sweet huh?

1084
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,750
Put that down for just a second?

1085
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:44,750
Why?

1086
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:47,690
Can you just have her turn
off the camera for a minute?

1087
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:51,980
Hey, let's, let's, um,
let's make a deal huh?

1088
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:55,920
We uh... we walk
out of this together.

1089
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,090
We can say whatever we see fit.
Anything you want.

1090
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:02,590
You can come out of this thing
looking like a hero.

1091
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:09,490
Like shiny medals and parades?
A new car every month sir?

1092
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,990
Yeah sure.

1093
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:13,890
Can you make me a senator?
Or a high-ranking cabinet position?

1094
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:17,280
Oh no wait! How
about FEMA sir?

1095
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,650
I don't know if I

1096
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,230
Make me FEMA.

1097
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:22,420
No soldier. I'm serious.

1098
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,670
Me too. Camera back on.

1099
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:30,120
Soldier I'm The President of
the United States.

1100
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,420
This will embarrass the office
and the country forever.

1101
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,620
You already did that
without any of my help sir.

1102
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,710
Stand up. Stand up!

1103
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,670
Don't. Hey come on.

1104
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:47,360
Don't shoot me now.
Don't shoot me.

1105
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:52,080
You don't have to prove anything.
Just don't shoot me.

1106
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:54,310
You don't have to do this.

1107
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:56,320
Sir is this how you want
to be remembered sir?

1108
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,900
I've seen stray cats
die with more dignity.

1109
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:03,680
No. No no no no. Please.
Im begging you. Not like this.

1110
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,730
Your father was a man
of honor and integrity.

1111
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,070
He believed in fighting for what was right.

1112
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:12,900
Don't talk about my father.

1113
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,210
But not you sir.

1114
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:20,250
You are a dishonest man whose lies have killed
Americans for the sake of personal profit.

1115
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:23,040
Shut up.

1116
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,200
Your father was right sir.

1117
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,800
An honest man can see the
lies leaving his mouth.

1118
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,810
Only after you have been broken and beaten

1119
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:32,220
and forced to see the truth
you see your own lies.

1120
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,410
I want you to shoot me sir.

1121
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,770
Your lies and actions have
killed thousands of people.

1122
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:54,090
But you've been shielded by
impenetrable layers of bureaucracy.

1123
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:59,300
I want you to shoot me because I want
the wand to remember this as your legacy.

1124
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:03,670
When they speak or hear your name the
lasting image will be you putting a bullet into

1125
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:07,100
a soldier's brain. Nothing
between me and your bullet sir.

1126
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,100
No spin. No Patriot Act.

1127
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:14,160
Just me and whatever's in
that rotten soul of yours.

1128
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,780
<i>Mr. President! Are you okay?</i>

1129
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,210
<i>Mr. President!</i>

1130
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:45,250
Jesus.

1131
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,210
Oh my God.

1132
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:53,390
Mr. President.
We made it.

1133
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,210
We made it.

1134
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,500
This is the most amazing thing
I've ever been through.

1135
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,360
It was like being in a war.

1136
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,330
I mean I know we're in the
middle of a war but this...

1137
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:09,910
this is going to change my life forever.

1138
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:14,370
Oh thank you Mr. President!
It's all possible now!

1139
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:20,380
The Pulitzer Prize. My own show.
Oprah.

1140
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:42,420
Mr. President. Are you okay?

1141
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:48,940
No Stenson. I'm not okay.
Get me the fuck out of here.

1142
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:30,400
No fucking way.
Get that out of here.

1143
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:52,920
Prick.

1144
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,280
Hey Stenson got your walkie?

1145
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,330
Agent Davis. Nice set.
Where you at?

1146
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:04,870
<i>I'm in the mess hall, sir.</i>

1147
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:07,880
Very convincing. You might have
a second career as a reporter.

1148
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,040
<i>I appreciate that sir but
I still enjoy my day job.</i>

1149
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,510
<i>See you in the
hospital shortly.</i>

1150
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:14,240
Yes you will.

1151
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,800
Not a word of the broadcast left
the building Mr. President.

1152
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,960
That's good. Hey uh get the VP
on the phone and my press secretary.

1153
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:20,890
Yes, sir.

1154
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:23,060
- Oh and one more thing.
- Yes, sir.

1155
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:25,240
Bring me my cowboy hat.

1156
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,950
Jesus Christ.

1157
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,090
<i>This is breaking news.</i>

1158
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:36,330
<i>Good evening. We bring
you breaking news from Iraq.</i>

1159
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:38,880
<i>The President made a daring
landing in Baghdad early</i>

1160
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,970
<i>today to show his dedication to the troops
while honoring them on Thanksgiving.</i>

1161
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:46,780
<i>Details are still coming in but we
do have reports that The President</i>

1162
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:49,400
<i>has been taken hostage by--</i>

1163
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,130
<i>Wait. Uh he isn't?</i>

1164
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:56,870
<i>Yes. It has been confirmed that
The President of the United States</i>

1165
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:59,880
<i>has been taken hostage by some...</i>

1166
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,420
<i>...group of people.</i>

1167
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:05,640
<i>The evidence shows that the
Islamic call to prayer</i>

1168
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,570
<i>was heard moments before The President
was taken hostage.</i>

1169
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:11,770
<i>A clear indication that Muslim
terrorists were involved.</i>

1170
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,250
<i>At WOV News we always
bring the most equal</i>

1171
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:25,750
<i>and equitable perspectives from some of
the most diverse minds around the world.</i>

1172
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:29,870
<i>With us today are Dr. Francis McCarthy,
associate professor of theology at the</i>

1173
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:33,120
<i>Christian American Academy of
Patriotism and Gerald Jones,</i>

1174
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,770
<i>senior administrator at the Ayn Rand Institute
of Prosperity and Anti-Socialism.</i>

1175
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:40,390
<i>Dr McCarthy what do you make
of what you have just heard?</i>

1176
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:42,290
<i>I need to interject here Whit.</i>

1177
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:45,740
<i>You heard the waver and
the call to jihad thing?</i>

1178
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,360
<i>The call to prayer.</i>

1179
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,390
<i>Clearly that was not a
heterosexual man.</i>

1180
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:54,530
<i>A normal person who loves God does not
make that kind of a sound.</i>

1181
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:58,270
<i>Our country is being actively
destroyed by gays and Muslims.</i>

1182
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,550
<i>And liberals.</i>

1183
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:02,710
<i>Since news broke of The President's
abduction many have been quick</i>

1184
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:06,390
<i>to use it as a pulpit to peddle
their skewed political objectives.</i>

1185
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:10,440
<i>From gay marriage to phony

<i>being enforced in your neighborhood
pundit is have flung</i>

1187
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,640
<i>every right wing scare tactic in the book.</i>

1188
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,610
<i>Of course the last thing
they would want is...</i>

1189
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:21,180
<i>...real dialogue because that would
actually require you to think.</i>

1190
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:25,060
<i>We go to our correspondent on the
ground in Baghdad who has more.</i>

1191
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,990
<i>David what details can you give
us of this shocking event?</i>

1192
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:33,020
<i>David can you hear me? What's
going on with The President?</i>

1193
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:36,360
<i>Apparently David is unable
to hear me at this time.</i>

1194
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:39,780
<i>Yes, we have reports from
the green zone in Baghdad</i>

1195
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:43,030
<i>that The President has...</i>

1196
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,100
<i>David we're having
trouble hearing you.</i>

1197
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,000
<i>David?</i>

1198
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,410
<i>And that is all we have been
able to find out so far.</i>

1199
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:52,880
<i>I'm sorry David.
We missed all of that.</i>

1200
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,710
<i>We want you tn think though.
So were putting the question out there.</i>

1201
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:56,970
<i>
What should we do?</i>

1202
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,980
<i>Do they know who it was that
took The President hostage?</i>

1203
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:13,920
<i>We believe it was a group
of people who took him hostage.</i>

1204
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:19,360
<i>Now giving some uh, fresh perspective on the
issues are Dr. Norman Jasper Friedberg,</i>

1205
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,280
<i>executive director at Washington
Think Tank "People Unified"</i>

1206
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,350
<i>and Rupert Brannigan Emmy nominated
actor on the hit political drama</i>

1207
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:26,610
<i>"The Oval Office".</i>

1208
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:30,890
<i>Dr. Frieberg there's been a lot
of speculation on how, why and</i>

1209
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:33,470
<i>who is responsible for
President's abduction.</i>

1210
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:37,480
<i>What're your observations on the
circumstances leading up to this?</i>

1211
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,880
<i>Well the symptoms of
contention in this debate</i>

1212
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,710
<i>are en gendered by perpetual
historical amnesia.</i>

1213
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:46,050
<i>The hostilities arising from the
chaos of conflicting ideas</i>

1214
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:49,790
<i>cannot be diagnosed by
simple reflective analysis.</i>

1215
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:56,250
<i>I see. So what you mean is uh...</i>

1216
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:58,870
<i>What exactly do you mean?</i>

1217
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,220
<i>Do we know if there were any
witnesses? Was anyone hurt?</i>

1218
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:06,490
<i>Is The President okay?</i>

1219
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:11,080
<i>As far as we know it happened
when a group of people</i>

1220
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:16,340
<i>we believe took him hostage and took
The President to a being held hostage.</i>

1221
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:18,920
<i>How could this have happened?</i>

1222
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:23,900
<i>Clearly these raghead Muslims
want to destroy our freedoms.</i>

1223
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,860
<i>It is the decline of moral
civilization.</i>

1224
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:29,540
<i>This is leftist agenda at it is worst.</i>

1225
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:32,490
<i>It's a symptom of big
government and overregulation.</i>

1226
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:34,740
<i>So Rupert. Please share your perspective.</i>

1227
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:37,250
<i>What do you think The President
is going through right now?</i>

1228
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:41,610
<i>Well on The Oval Office I play the chief
adviser to The President not The President.</i>

1229
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:42,520
<i>Of course.</i>

1230
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:45,020
<i>So there is going to be a very
different character analysis</i>

1231
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,950
<i>between The President and
the chief adviser.</i>

1232
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:53,230
<i>Okay, so from chief adviser
perspective what are your thoughts?</i>

1233
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:55,250
<i>Hmm.</i>

1234
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,260
<i>As chief advisor I think I would have
recommended that he not go to Baghdad.</i>

1235
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:07,720
<i>Well it's a bit too late for that.
What about now that he's been abducted?</i>

1236
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:11,530
<i>Well now that he is abducted
I'd say the only person...</i>

1237
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:13,610
<i>...to solve the problem
would be Jack Bauer.</i>

1238
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:18,110
<i>If we do not do something soon this
country will lose all its moral compass.</i>

1239
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,230
<i>I mean what should we expect next?</i>

1240
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:21,720
<i>A black president?</i>

1241
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,610
<i>Or a foreign-born president.</i>

1242
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:27,980
<i>Even worse a foreign born
Muslim black president!</i>

1243
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,640
<i>That is where we are headed.
Oh me oh my!</i>

1244
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,270

1251

<i>There have been many questions

1263
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,080
<i>We now have answers.</i>

1264
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:34,420
<i>It was not Iraqis foreign Jihadists
or even Fidel loyalist Cubans. No.</i>

1265
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:36,350
<i>It was U.S. Soldiers.</i>

1266
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:41,030
<i>That's right. Members of our own
military have abducted The President.</i>

1267
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:43,780

French for this one.</i>

You know I didn't think it was right at first
what we intended to do with the president,

1300
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:48,300
but then I thought about it and uh,

1301
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:52,140
I almost died myself on many
occasions and I got angry.

1302
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:58,870
Angry because my life was about to be sacrificed
for some bullshit surrounding this war.

1303

1305

There was this time we shot
this kid and his father.

1306
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,870
We got the order from Centcom. They were
on a kill list and had to be taken out.

1307
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:25,050
They were aiding the insurgency.
A9 year old boy

1308
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:28,830
who knew how to build
sophisticated roadside bombs.

1309
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:33,730
It was bad intel.
We killed the wrong people.

1310
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:37,080
We weren't even in the correct province.

1311
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:43,470
We killed innocent people because
this administration is so incompetent

1312
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:47,240
and desperate to make good news
that they'll spin any intelligence

1313
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,360
to make themselves look like kings.

1314

Look at me. Look at my hands.
These hands you used to hold.

1315

Well you taught me right from wrong.
And this war is wrong.
