1
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,130
<i>So the next story,
the president of the United States...</i>

2
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,970
<i>...left the press conference today
and relocated to an undisclosed location.</i>

3
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,670
<i>Everybody was a little scared...</i>

4
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,940
<i>...because the president doesn't just get up
and leave a press conference.</i>

5
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,610
<i>You know, everyone was terrified
in that conference room.</i>

6
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,150
<i>We don't know
what made the president leave...</i>

7
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,020
<i>...but we deserve some answers,
I think, from the government.</i>

8
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,260
- Hey, what's up, man?
- What's up?

9
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,100
Oh, it's like a V6.

10
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,140
Oh, my God. John. John.

11
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,440
- John.
- Dr. Scott.

12
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,940
- Buddy. Hello, my friend.
- Hey, man. What's up?

13
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,540
- Hold up. Nuts.
- Nut. Nuts.

14
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,680
- How does it feel to be done with school?
- It's awesome.

15
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,720
The school was kicking my ass, though.
That shit was wack.

16
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,020
Moving on to bigger and better things now.

17
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,220
Speaking of which, who do we have here?

18
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,390
This is Samantha. Samantha, this is John.

19
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,530
Samantha, um,
lives down the street from you.

20
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,330
I know Samantha.

21
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,600
- Trust me, not only is Scott now a doctor...
- Hold on.

22
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,600
- Veterinarian.
- ...but he's also one of the best guys I know.

23
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,200
I have to warn you that he will find a way
to screw up this conversation.

24
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,740
Don't listen to him, okay?

25
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,810
Because this guy is not full--
He's full of it because really, I'm dirty. Heh.

26
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,480
No, I mean-- I don't mean that
in a sexul way.

27
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,190
Unless you like that. You like that?

28
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,520
I mean, I could be.

29
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,060
See what I mean?

30
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,360
Hey, John. Get your ass over here.
It's time for some shots.

31
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,730
Our presence has been requested
in the kitchen.

32
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,500
Screw up this conversation later.

33
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,230
Don't leave, okay?
Please don't leave. Take a nut.

34
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,640
Everybody, all right, grab a glass.
Grab a glass. Hey, shut up.

35
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,740
Grab a glass. You too, Astrid.

36
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,140
Okay, I'm not one for speeches...

37
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,380
...so I'm gonna keep this short, okay?

38
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,580
For the past year, I've come to know all of you
like a family, okay?

39
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,620
And I love each of you very much,
especially you, man.

40
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,920
Oh, I know. I know.

41
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,720
When we drove out here,
I never would have thought...

42
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,890
...I'd be the only one left still unemployed.

43
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,100
- Big surprise.
- So having said that...

44
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,670
...I'll strike a little deal
with you guys, okay?

45
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,970
The first person--

46
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,740
The first person who gets me a job,
I will let have sex with my blow-up doll.

47
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,170
- Yeah!
- Okay.

48
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,680
- Okay, that's-- Put her away. Put her away.
- Just a joke, John.

49
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,280
I'm just trying to have fun with the people.
Okay, raise them high and toast to friends--

50
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,580
Correction. Family.

51
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,820
Family, good tunes...

52
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,820
...good brew and the best firsts...

53
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,960
...anybody can ever hope to have
in a new city. Cheers.

54
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,360
- Yeah!
- Get them up there.

55
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,430
Seconds? Who wants seconds?
I'll keep these going all night.

56
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,740
- Going all night?
- John.

57
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,670
What's the deal, man?

58
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,640
Didn't you guys break up,
like, two weeks ago?

59
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,010
- Dude, I can go kick his ass if you want.
- No, I'm fine, you guys.

60
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,350
This is a celebration, right?

61
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,090
- And we're celebrating.
- Copy that, brother.

62
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,750
So there.

63
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,900
- Do it, man.
- I'll be right back.

64
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,270
- Hey, hey, yeah.
- No fucking serious.

65
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,570
Tori.

66
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,140
Hi.

67
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,840
John, hi. How are you?

68
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,750
Good. Good. Things are, uh, really good.

69
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,350
- How about yourself?
- Good. Yeah. Yeah.

70
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,150
I'd just been really busy with school
and other stuff. Heh.

71
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,220
Yeah. Uh....

72
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,330
So who is your friend here?

73
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,430
Oh, God. I'm sorry. This is Jacob.

74
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,630
Jacob, nice to meet you. I'm John.

75
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,730
Tori told me a lot about you.

76
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,700
I just want you to know
that, uh, she's in good hands.

77
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,010
Really? That's good to hear.
Very comforting.

78
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,550
- Look, I hope that this isn't awkward--
- No.

79
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,350
No, no, no, this-- It's fine, right?
We're all adults.

80
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,420
Let's skip it. Ah.

81
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,250
So, Jacob, can I get you anything to drink?

82
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,750
Glad you asked.

83
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,160
Kind of feeling a Long Island Iced Tea.
I'm not gonna lie.

84
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,760
- Heh.
- Heh. All right, that's a....

85
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,700
I'll go get that for you.

86
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,570
- Long Island Iced Tea.
- It's like he never heard of it before.

87
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,340
What a rookie.

88
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,040
So, what's the verdict?

89
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,680
You know, what I thought, typical frat boy.

90
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,810
He looks like a cowgirl with that shirt.
I could take his head, dunk him in our toilet.

91
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,120
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

92
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,220
I know it's hard, but it's a big city
and there are plenty of good girls out there.

93
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,490
- You just need one. Just one.
- Yeah, he's right.

94
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,730
What do you know, Adam? How many girls
have you been with since we got here, huh?

95
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,060
- Shut up. No, you shut up.
- No, you shut up.

96
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,730
Can we be a little mature here, please?
Please?

97
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,140
- Mature? Really?
- Huh? Yeah.

98
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,570
<i>Well, we just now have breaking news
coming in.</i>

99
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,740
<i>- We go now to the top story of the hour.</i>
- Guys, come over here. Check this out.

100
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,950
<i>Amateur photographers are capturing--</i>

101
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,520
- What's going on?
- Everyone, shut up.

102
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,580
Yeah, I got this.

103
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,350
<i>You might be one of many viewers
trying to figure out...</i>

104
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,720
<i>...what those mysterious bright lights are.</i>

105
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,790
<i>Truth is you're not the only one.
NASA, along with the Russian space program...</i>

106
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,230
<i>...alerted the media that it is believed to be
a group of meteors from deep outer space.</i>

107
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,870
<i>They say
they are still investigating the matter...</i>

108
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,340
<i>...but need more time
to make a valid assessment.</i>

109
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,340
<i>Some astronomers managed
to come to their own conclusion...</i>

110
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,740
<i>...after remote surface
temperature readings...</i>

111
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,380
<i>...indicated the meteors
are mostly comprised of ice...</i>

112
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,450
<i>...resembling glaciers
rather than rocks.</i>

113
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,010
<i>Space programs wrapped up
the press conference...</i>

114
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,320
<i>...by saying that these meteors pose
absolutely no threat to us...</i>

115
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,060
<i>...and are expected to safely pass by Earth
tomorrow morning.</i>

116
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,860
Dude, I see it.

117
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,890
Wait. What?

118
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,970
What? Seriously?

119
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,060
- Where is this?
- There it is.

120
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,070
There.

121
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,670
- Come on, out here.
- Yeah.

122
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,170
My gosh, imagine if that thing
actually hit us.

123
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,980
Whoa, that's scary.

124
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,150
How big did they say it was?

125
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,660
- This calls for shots.
- Oh, no.

126
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,530
- No, no, no.
- Hey, dude.

127
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,860
Hey, you said it yourself,
we just missed out on the apocalypse.

128
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,370
If it didn't deserve a toast,
I don't know what the hell does.

129
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,870
Everybody, get in here.

130
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,810
John, get your head in the game, bro.
Grab a glass. Toast to tomorrow.

131
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,940
Because with each night you live...

132
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,680
...you never know
what tomorrow's gonna bring. Right?

133
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,410
I'll drink to that.

134
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,820
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

135
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,390
Hello?

136
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,610
Adam. Adam.

137
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,750
- What happened?
- I don't know. I don't freaking know.

138
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,180
Where is everybody?

139
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,820
Your guess is as good as mine.

140
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,790
Look, just go in the house
and turn off the gas, all right?

141
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,350
I'm going to Davey's
to make sure they're okay.

142
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,060
All right.

143
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,320
David?

144
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,350
- David.
- He's out front.

145
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,590
- What's going on?
- I don't know. Just stay inside.

146
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,490
- David.
- We're out here.

147
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,830
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, we're all right.

148
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,000
Amy? Amy, stay inside
till we know what's going on, all right?

149
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,170
- Dude, what's going on?
- Hey.

150
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,700
- What do you guys see up there?
- Lots of smoke.

151
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,710
Looks like Downtown,
possibly North Hollywood.

152
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,540
How bad is it?

153
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,710
Looks pretty freaking bad.

154
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,650
- What is going on?
- I don't know. My sister goes to UCLA...

155
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,520
- ...said a bunch of things just hit the campus.
- What?

156
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,950
She doesn't know, but they're everywhere.
Amy.

157
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,550
- Amy, stay inside.
- Have you seen my brother?

158
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,320
- Amy!
- Have you seen my brother?

159
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,230
Not since last night.
Don't know where he is.

160
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,660
- I'll check in with you later.
- All right. Good luck. Be careful.

161
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,800
Amy, stay inside.

162
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,930
- What does it say?
- Shut up, shut up. Turn it up, Adam.

163
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,930
<i>the Los Angeles area...</i>

164
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,500
<i>...ranging from Downtown
all the way to Santa Monica.</i>

165
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,930
<i>Police and fire departments
are working together.</i>

166
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,600
<i>Thousands,
if not tens of thousands of citizens...</i>

167
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,810
<i>...have been injured or killed
in this horrifying incident.</i>

168
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,470
- Oh, my God.
<i>- We can't confirm...</i>

169
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,580
<i>...but sources are indicating
the explosions may or may not...</i>

170
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,610
<i>...be related
to last night's meteor sighting--</i>

171
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,280
- Where's my brother?
- I thought he was with you.

172
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,120
- Where's my brother? Where is Turner?
- I don't know.

173
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,620
He was gonna stay at a friend's house,
Ricky.

174
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,020
- Mickey. Mickey.
- Damn it.

175
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,830
- What--? Wait, where are you going?
<i>- We strongly recommend to our viewers...</i>

176
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,270
<i>...that you stay indoors
until we figure out what's going on.</i>

177
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,410
<i>- Yeah, hello?</i>
- Turner, thank God, okay.

178
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,580
- All you all right?
<i>- Yeah. Oh, my God.</i>

179
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,780
<i>- Are you seeing what's happening outside?</i>
- Stay where you are. I'm coming to get you.

180
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,650
- Why? We're perfectly fine.
- Look, just wait at Mickey's.

181
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,320
- I'm on my way, all right?
<i>- John, I don't--</i>

182
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,620
- Did you hear me?
<i>- What?</i>

183
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,190
No, just wait at Mickey--
I'm coming to get you, all right? Just-- Hello?

184
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,710
Turner! Shit!

185
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,410
Turner? Hello? Turner!

186
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,120
<i>--were in fact meteor-related...</i>

187
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,320
<i>...and now we are being told
that more might be on the way.</i>

188
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,820
<i>Official satellite photographs indicate
that yet another meteor...</i>

189
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,930
<i>...roughly the size of a school bus...</i>

190
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,460
<i>...may hit the city within the following hour.</i>

191
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,830
<i>We recommend to our viewers
that you seek shelter immediately.</i>

192
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,200
<i>The government is instructing people
to follow--</i>

193
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,070
Hey. Wait. Wait, Mickey.

194
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,900
- What?
- Where's my brother?

195
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,040
Everybody's at the top of the parking structure
trying to get a better look.

196
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,810
Are you coming?

197
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,100
- Turner.
- Hey.

198
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,130
Hey, check it out.
It's like freaking madness out there.

199
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,430
- Look, we have to go.
- Are you kidding me?

200
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,370
We got front row seats.
Jimmy ran to the store to get beer.

201
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,740
There may be more on the way.
We have to go now.

202
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,510
Hey, check it out.
I think one just hit West L.A.

203
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,650
Wow, this is really freaking exciting, man.

204
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,250
- Come on, we have to go right now.
- All right.

205
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,090
Hey, Mickey, save me some beers, all right?

206
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,310
- Get in the car, put your seat belt on.
- What? Why?

207
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,650
Just do what I say.

208
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,550
Whatever, Grandpa.

209
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,020
There. Are you happy now?

210
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,030
Jesus Christ. This is ridiculous.
What should we do?

211
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,540
We get back to the house
and we wait for things to calm down.

212
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,800
I can't believe this is happening.
It's exciting, don't you think?

213
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,570
Just call the guys,
tell them to pack up what they can.

214
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,270
All right, all right. Okay.

215
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,350
Damn it, it's not working.

216
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,750
- Try it again.
- All right. Watch out!

217
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,400
<i>--what is going on,
but I can assure you that the police are out there.</i>

218
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,170
<i>They're taking care of every situation
as fast and as quickly as possible.</i>

219
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,170
<i>Now, uh, turning to another note...</i>

220
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,270
<i>...I'm getting some more news
regarding this potential meteor...</i>

221
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,910
<i>...that's on its way to Los Angeles
as I speak right now.</i>

222
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,280
<i>And I don't know anything about it, but--</i>

223
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,050
<i>- Wait, wait. Now, I'm getting reports--</i>
- Ugh.

224
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,780
<i>It's on its way. It's in the sky.</i>

225
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,350
<i>If you look outside, you can see them in the sky.
Everybody, get inside.</i>

226
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,950
<i>Everybody, get inside.</i>

227
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,370
Is it over?

228
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,880
I can't see anything. Nothing but smoke.

229
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,720
Well, keep the door shut. I don't want
any of that smoke to get inside here.

230
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,260
God, is this really happening?

231
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,460
Adam, are you okay?

232
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,500
Yeah. I think it's just the smoke.

233
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,700
Power must be out
in the whole neighborhood.

234
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,160
Anybody see any streetlights
that are working?

235
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,830
- It's the middle of the day.
- Where's the radio?

236
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,100
Check under the tool drawer.

237
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,410
I can't believe this is happening.
I mean, do you think anybody's dead?

238
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,650
Wait. I see people outside.
Should we make sure they're okay?

239
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,820
- What do we do?
- No, no, no, not yet.

240
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,660
Wait till the smoke dies down more.

241
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,930
There. Go back.

242
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,000
<i>--that this an isolated incident.</i>

243
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,930
<i>--in Los Angeles, due to the cloud of smoke...</i>

244
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,370
<i>...police and fire have been halted
until further notice.</i>

245
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,570
<i>Reports that thousands,
if not hundreds of thousands of people...</i>

246
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,780
<i>...are believed to be dead
and we expect that number to increase.</i>

247
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,010
Jesus Christ.

248
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,750
<i>We've been told
by the government to relay this message:</i>

249
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,350
<i>"Do not attempt to vacate the city
and stay away from other people."</i>

250
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,860
<i>We are getting urgent requests
to tell our listeners to stay indoors.</i>

251
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,060
<i>Do not try to vacate the city.</i>

252
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,690
- LAX and all major highways--
- So that's it, we're stuck in here now?

253
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,200
What? No, no, no.
There's no way I'm staying here.

254
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,600
Why did they say
to stay away from other people?

255
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,470
We don't know what's going on.

256
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,470
They know more than we do
so we have to do what they say.

257
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,410
John, look, what's the big deal,
I inhale a little smoke?

258
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,380
My girlfriend lives eight blocks from here.
I gotta go and make sure she's okay.

259
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,710
I'll bring her back.

260
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,550
He's right.

261
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,920
We should group up.

262
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,120
All right. Go on, but come right back.

263
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,830
You got it.

264
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,500
- I'm going too.
- No. No, you're staying here.

265
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,230
Why, you're the boss of me now?

266
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,830
- You're my kid brother, my responsibility.
- You may be my older brother...

267
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,240
...but that doesn't mean shit
when it comes time to make decisions.

268
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,310
- If you used logic, I wouldn't have to babysit.
- Is that right?

269
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,910
- That's right.
- Come on, guys.

270
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,350
Guys, stop it!
What are you doing? Come on.

271
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,620
You could fight about this later,
but right now, you need to calm down.

272
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,120
Now, go drink some milk or something.

273
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,630
Are you coming?

274
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,910
We'll be right back.

275
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,590
All right, come on.

276
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,910
All right, come on, through here.

277
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,200
- Which one is it?
- Number three, up top.

278
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,340
Astrid. Astrid?

279
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,920
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

280
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,450
Astrid?

281
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,460
Baby?

282
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,860
- Astrid.
- Nate?

283
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,690
- We're in here.
- Astrid?

284
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,200
- God, what happened? What's wrong?
- I don't know.

285
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,970
She was fine 20 minutes ago,
then she just fell down.

286
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,100
Okay, baby, just hold on, okay?

287
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,080
What's happening to me?

288
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,730
- I can't breathe.
- Turner, get in here!

289
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,630
Just hold on, everything's gonna be okay,
all right?

290
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,970
Just try and breathe slowly.
Concentrate on breathing, all right?

291
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,800
- I can't breathe.
- Jesus Christ, Nate, what happened?

292
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,880
I don't know, I have no idea.

293
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,880
- What should we do?
- We need to get her back to the house, okay?

294
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,650
No. No, we need to call an ambulance.

295
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,980
You think I didn't try?
The phones aren't working. I tried 20 times.

296
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,420
We get her to Scott,
he should know what to do.

297
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,420
- He can help.
- Scott's a veterinarian.

298
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,820
Yeah, I know that.

299
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,630
But look, he's all we got, okay?

300
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,630
- Turner.
- All right.

301
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,470
All right, just go get all the batteries
and flashlights that you can, okay?

302
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,340
- And any food too.
- Okay.

303
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,340
- Okay.
- Hang in there. Hang in there.

304
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,910
- Grab her arm.
- Okay.

305
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,410
We're gonna lift you, okay?
Can you stand? Can you stand?

306
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,710
Grab her arm.

307
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,380
We're gonna lift you, okay? Can you stand?

308
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,980
- Hang in there.
- Grab her arm.

309
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,050
We're gonna lift you. Can you stand?

310
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,350
- Hang in there. Okay.
- Grab her arm.

311
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,790
We're gonna lift you, okay? Can you stand?

312
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,460
<i>Grab her arm.</i>

313
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,030
<i>We're gonna lift you, okay? Can you stand?</i>

314
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,260
<i>We're gonna lift you. Can you stand?</i>

315
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,640
<i>If your power goes out, remain calm...</i>

316
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,940
<i>...and assist family members or neighbors
who may be vulnerable...</i>

317
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,240
- ...if exposed to extreme heat or cold.
- I think I see more people.

318
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,080
Locate a flashlight with
batteries to use until power comes back on.

319
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,380
<i>- Do not use candles, as this can cause a fire.</i>
- What was that?

320
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,350
The power clicked back on.
Check the breaker.

321
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,360
<i>Turn off sensitive electric equipment.</i>

322
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,960
<i>Turn off major electric appliances
that were on when the power went off.</i>

323
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,060
<i>This will help to prevent power surges
when electricity is restored.</i>

324
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,570
<i>Keep your refrigerator and freezer doors closed
as much as possible to keep cold in--</i>

325
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,540
- I think that's it.
- Yup, that's it.

326
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,840
<i>Do not use the stove to heat your home.</i>

327
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,410
Power's back on.

328
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,680
Is there anything we should be doing,
like trying to call police?

329
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,550
I tried that. It's not working.
Let's see what's going on.

330
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,780
<i>If you're just joining,
reports are coming in over the waves...</i>

331
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:14,220
<i>...that thousands of people
are now becoming extremely ill...</i>

332
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,890
<i>...due to what is believed to be toxins
released from the glacial meteors...</i>

333
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,120
Turn it up.

334
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,730
<i>...that made landfall just a while ago.</i>

335
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,560
<i>Reports started coming in over the radio
that people were becoming sick...</i>

336
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:29,700
<i>...and forced the government to quarantine the
city until they figure out exactly what's going on.</i>

337
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,640
<i>We've been hearing
that people are becoming mentally ill...</i>

338
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,370
<i>...and in some cases,
showing extreme violence.</i>

339
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,640
<i>- Symptoms that can--</i>
- What are they saying?

340
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,750
Is there something in the smoke
that's making people violent?

341
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,980
<i>--began quarantining the city
just under an hour ago.</i>

342
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,920
- Is that possible?
<i>- We can't stress this enough.</i>

343
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,650
<i>Do not come into contact with anyone
who may show these symptoms...</i>

344
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,160
<i>..for they are considered
extremely dangerous...</i>

345
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,260
<i>...and not to mention, possibly contagious.</i>

346
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,400
Baby, baby, hang in there.
We're gonna get you help, okay?

347
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,740
- How much further?
- Just a few more blocks.

348
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,150
Easy, easy, easy.

349
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,350
- Scott, get over here.
- Oh, my God, what happened?

350
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,160
<i>We don't know. Just get over here and help.</i>

351
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,060
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Watch it.

352
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,930
- Scott, she needs your help, man.
- I'm not a doctor.

353
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,130
Yeah, I know that.
Just do something, damn it, please.

354
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,830
Jesus Christ, she's burning up.
Somebody grab some towels.

355
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,970
- Put some water on them, okay?
- I'm on it.

356
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,470
My God, her heart sounds like
it's gonna explode.

357
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,770
Do we have any aspirin?

358
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,750
- Somebody get some aspirin.
- Scott, please help.

359
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,750
- Please help.
- Astrid, it's gonna be okay.

360
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,990
John, get a flashlight too.

361
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,360
Scott, what else?

362
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,820
I don't know, goddamn it.

363
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,090
Oh, please.

364
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,890
Please. Please help.

365
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,200
Please.

366
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,500
It's all right. Give me the aspirin, John.

367
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,410
- Here, here.
- Thank you.

368
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,170
- Baby?
- Hang in there.

369
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,510
How did this start?

370
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,910
She just was acting funny
and then she started bleeding.

371
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,880
- I don't know.
- Did she take any other kind of medications?

372
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,150
- Anything at all?
- I don't know.

373
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,620
- Come on, yes or no?
- No.

374
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,250
Here's the towel.

375
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,830
Okay. There we go.

376
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,360
All right, there. Take some of these.

377
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,560
- Try and swallow.
- Try to get some in there.

378
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,330
It's just like the TV said.

379
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,930
What? What are you talking about?

380
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,400
Something in the smoke,
it's making people sick.

381
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,440
Astrid's not the only one.
It's happening all across the city.

382
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,840
What's causing it?

383
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,640
They don't know.

384
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,350
It has to be some type of amoeba
or spore.

385
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,750
You know, something inhaled
through the smoke.

386
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,050
Wait, wait. If that's the case,
then why aren't we all sick, huh?

387
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,450
We've all inhaled some of that stuff, right?

388
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,590
Yeah, but from what I've studied,
if it's a respiratory virus...

389
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,360
...some show effects immediately
and it may not affect others at all.

390
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,310
What's happening?

391
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,940
She's convulsing. Hold her arms.

392
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,270
What? Wait, what?

393
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,180
Hold her arms down.

394
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,680
- Baby. Come on, baby.
- Astrid?

395
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,810
Hold on. Baby.

396
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,450
Do something, goddamn it.

397
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,990
Would you do something?

398
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,750
Is she okay?

399
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,830
It's okay.

400
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,920
Do something.

401
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,700
She's dead.

402
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,110
What?

403
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,310
Astrid?

404
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,940
Baby?

405
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,320
No.

406
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,350
No!

407
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,830
I need a drink.

408
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,960
No.

409
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,180
Okay.
Okay, we need to come up with a plan.

410
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,180
Plan? What kind of plan?

411
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,850
Plan to get out of here.
You did see what happened.

412
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,650
But you heard the TV,
they're quarantining Los Angeles.

413
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,890
- Where are we gonna go?
- I don't know.

414
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,160
But unless we wanna end up like Astrid,
we really don't have a choice.

415
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,160
Well, Scott, you said so yourself.

416
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,900
It can affect each one of us differently.

417
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:58,240
And that means any one of us
could start showing symptoms at any minute.

418
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,710
Now what can we do?

419
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,440
Who's got a plan?

420
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,150
We could all head to the coast.

421
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,780
Follow the beach up north.

422
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,550
It's actually not such a bad idea, you know.

423
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,160
The coastal winds will help dilute the air
so it'll be less threatening to breathe it there.

424
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,790
Okay, well, how will we get there?
I mean, who has a car close by?

425
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,730
My roommates.

426
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,940
It's in the parking garage on 28th.
It's a walk, but I think we can make it.

427
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,810
All right.
All right, that's what we're gonna do.

428
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,490
We're gonna take the car to the coast
and we're gonna drive ourselves out of here.

429
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,620
We're taking her with us.

430
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,630
Nate, uh....

431
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,660
You can't be serious.

432
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,970
I can't just leave her here.

433
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,200
Just look at her. She's gone.

434
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,370
I don't care, all right?

435
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,840
We're taking her with us.

436
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,910
Jesus, Nate, John's right.

437
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,110
Okay, man, listen to logic.

438
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,550
All right, I know it's hard
to accept Astrid's gone, okay?

439
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,490
For all we know, she may be contagious.
We can't take that risk. We have to go.

440
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,350
- And we have to leave her.
- No.

441
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,090
Yeah, man, just have a drink and calm down.

442
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,900
I don't want a goddamn drink, okay?

443
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:35,170
Look, either we're taking her with us
or I'm staying. Do you understand?

444
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,100
I'm not about to abandon her
like some kind of dead dog.

445
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,640
I'm not gonna do that.

446
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,680
Don't ask me to do that.

447
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,140
- Either we take her or I'm staying.
- She's gone.

448
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,920
We can't take a dead body with us.
We don't have room in the car.

449
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,000
Astrid?

450
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,100
Astrid?

451
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,410
Help! Help!

452
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,310
Astrid?

453
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,170
Get her off me! Get her off me!

454
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,570
Did that or did that not just happen?

455
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,810
Scott.

456
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,710
Is she all right?

457
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,180
She's dead.

458
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,280
She's freaking dead.

459
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,350
The whole city could be like this.

460
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,790
Anybody else think
it's time for us to get out of here?

461
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,490
Nate?

462
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,160
All right.

463
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,800
The sun's gonna be down soon.

464
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,400
So if we're gonna do this, we do it now.

465
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,310
Grab only what you need.

466
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,670
We'll leave this house in five minutes.

467
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,430
This is it.

468
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,010
- Come on, Scott, do you live here or not?
- You've got to--

469
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,910
I never used the back entrance.

470
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,820
I'm a little bit nervous.
I've never stolen a car before.

471
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,260
- Scott, stop talking and open the door.
- Okay, I got it.

472
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,610
So, what's the plan?
What roads are we taking?

473
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,850
I say we take Lincoln all the way to Wilshire
then hop on the 1 north up to Malibu.

474
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,580
We have to make a stop first.

475
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,720
Whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait a minute.
We're not stopping anywhere.

476
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,120
You're talking about Tori?

477
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,820
I have to make sure she's okay.

478
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:21,130
You have no idea where she is right now.
She could be in a car heading out of town.

479
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,400
- Or worse, she could be sick.
- It sounds risky.

480
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:28,070
I don't care what you guys think.
It's on the way.

481
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,010
And if you're adamant against it,
I'll go alone.

482
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,710
It's on the way?

483
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,710
Yes.

484
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,910
If she's not there, we go without her. Got it?

485
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,850
Yeah.

486
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,150
All right.

487
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,160
Let's go.

488
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,760
Guys. My roommate's car
is over by the elevators.

489
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,130
- I'll run upstairs, get the keys, be right back.
- Hey, make it fast.

490
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,030
We should check these cars
for stuff that could be useful.

491
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,570
That's a good idea. Everybody, split up.
But nobody leave this level.

492
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,110
We meet here in five minutes. Got it?

493
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,320
Adam, come on.

494
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,990
All right. Wait right there, all right?

495
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,940
Hey.

496
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,420
Thank God.

497
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,490
Hello? Reggie?

498
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,960
Reggie, you here?

499
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,000
Hello.

500
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,310
Reggie, where did you put your keys?

501
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,890
Thank you.

502
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,170
Reggie?

503
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,710
- What is that?
- I don't know.

504
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,570
It's some kind of a radio.

505
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,410
Maybe you should try another channel.

506
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,250
Reggie, are you in there?

507
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,490
Hello?

508
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,360
Oh, thank God, man.

509
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,570
Reggie, we're all leaving town, man.
Come on, let's go.

510
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:30,150
Reggie, come on. Let's go, man.

511
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:37,050
Reggie?

512
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,230
Oh, my God.

513
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,510
On second thought, you better stay here.

514
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,250
Hello?

515
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,190
Hello?

516
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,990
Hey, hey, I got something.

517
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,230
What is it?

518
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,500
I don't know. It's a weak signal.

519
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,630
What is that?

520
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,240
Should you try saying something?

521
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,370
Hello?

522
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,510
Hello?

523
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,180
Can anybody hear me?

524
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,200
Are you okay?

525
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,410
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what happened?
Are you guys okay?

526
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,350
Yeah, we're fine.

527
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,350
Did you guys find anything useful?

528
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,250
Just a radio. We can't reach anyone
from down here, though.

529
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,090
It's been 10 minutes.
Where the hell is Scott?

530
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,830
I think we need a new plan.

531
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,700
I can't hold them. What do we do?

532
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,780
Run!

533
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,650
Where do we go? Scott!

534
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,390
South tunnel!

535
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,690
Be more specific!

536
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,270
Keep going forward!

537
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,740
- Scott, which way?
- Left. Left!

538
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,870
- Which way, Scott?
- Left, left, turn left!

539
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,480
Nate, come on!

540
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,780
Keep going.

541
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,990
- Nate!
- Just go!

542
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,040
Well?

543
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:08,980
What do we do now, huh?

544
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,940
- Which one of you has a bright idea now?
- Just calm down.

545
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,110
I'm not gonna calm down, John.
You wanna know why?

546
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,650
Because none of us
are gonna make it out alive.

547
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,950
What do we do now?

548
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,620
- What are we gonna do?
- All right, new plan.

549
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:27,260
My car is only about a mile from here,
so I think, considering the circumstances...

550
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:29,130
...that's our best bet.

551
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,260
I'm going for Tori now.

552
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,760
Oh, my God, John, you cannot be serious.
Really?

553
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,800
Her place is a couple blocks from here.
I get her now, we won't have to stop later.

554
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:42,170
All right, but no bullshit. If she's not there,
then we leave without her. You got it?

555
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:46,040
- Yeah.
- What if you don't make it, huh?

556
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,240
How will we even know?

557
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,320
If we're not there in 40 minutes,
you leave without us.

558
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,950
Do you understand me?

559
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,350
Yes.

560
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,300
All right.

561
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,460
Then that's the plan.

562
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,660
I'm going with you.

563
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,330
Are you sure?

564
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,370
Yeah.

565
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,440
All right.

566
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,970
Forty minutes. See you there.

567
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,740
Take care of yourself.

568
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,820
You too.

569
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,190
What, you kidding me?

570
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,460
Wait!

571
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,570
<i>--remain calm
and assist family members or neighbors...</i>

572
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,880
<i>...who may be vulnerable
if exposed to extreme heat or cold.</i>

573
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,750
John?

574
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,350
Oh, my God. Jo--

575
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,590
What are you--? What are you doing here?

576
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,930
- Why the hell did you just hit me?
- Wait, I didn't know it was you.

577
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,190
- John, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

578
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,360
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

579
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:35,060
<i>--when electricity is restored.</i>

580
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,070
My God, you're bleeding, all right?

581
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,070
Come on,
let's take care of this thing.

582
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,310
- Tori, is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's fine. It's just John.

583
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,880
<i>Do not use the
stove to heat your home. This can cause a fire--</i>

584
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:50,110
- Hi. I'm Tori's boyfriend, Jacob.
<i>- Use caution when driving.</i>

585
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,780
<i>If traffic signals are out,
treat each signal as a stop sign.</i>

586
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,860
- Nice to meet you too.
- Stop in every intersection.

587
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,460
Okay, this is gonna sting a little bit.

588
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,970
You have no idea how happy I am
to see you.

589
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,140
Really? I wouldn't have guessed that.

590
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:17,240
Well, what are you guys doing here?

591
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,080
We came here to get you.

592
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,810
To get me? Okay, why?

593
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,050
You don't know.

594
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,510
Know what?

595
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,220
There's something in the smoke,
making people change, making people sick.

596
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,520
And we were on our way out of here,
and I just-- I couldn't--

597
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:34,100
You couldn't what?

598
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:37,730
I couldn't leave
without making sure you're okay.

599
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,270
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

600
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,770
Look, all right, I appreciate your concern,
but we are perfectly fine.

601
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,910
You don't understand.
If you stay here, you can die.

602
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,250
- Both of you.
- Trust us.

603
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,450
- Then what's the plan?
- We meet up at Turner's car...

604
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,530
...we drive up the coast,
and get out of this mess.

605
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,590
- That's it? That's the plan?
- Yeah. That's the plan. You're coming with us.

606
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,760
So you and Jason can go grab
whatever you need so we can get out of here.

607
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,100
His name is Jacob.

608
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:15,070
- What?
- Never mind.

609
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,540
Adam.

610
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,120
- All right, is everybody ready?
- Yeah.

611
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,630
- Jacob?
- Yeah, I think so.

612
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,300
<i>The following is a public announcement...</i>

614
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,400

<i>...of operations currently underway.</i>

<i>At 0500, orders are in place
for the U.S. military...</i>

619
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:05,120
<i>...to begin the use of chemical weapons
over the city of Los Angeles.</i>

620
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:10,150
<i>If you are able to vacate the premises,
you have until 5 a.m. to do so.</i>

621
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,620
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Chemical weapons?

622
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,930
- What the hell are they talking about?
- What's going on?

623
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,160
It must be worse than we thought.

624

- How long does that give us?
<i>- The following message--</i>

625

I'm staying.

633
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:42,450
Tori, if you don't mind,
I like to just stay here in this apartment...

634
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,950
- ...if that's okay.
- No, no.

635
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,860
- That's not part of the plan. We all go.
- John, I'm sick.

636
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:51,960
I've seen what I'm gonna become.
I'd rather do it alone than burden my friends.

637
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,460
Maybe he should stay here.

638
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,900

Go.

Just get in the car.

660
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,340
He didn't make it.

We're on the clock.

What's he talking about?

663
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,960
We heard on the radio
they're gonna bomb the city in a few hours.

664
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,660
They can't be serious.

665
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:49,430
I hate this city.

666
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,160
All right, everybody buckle up.

667
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,870
I ain't stopping this car for nothing.

668
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,620
I can't believe this.

669
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:17,790
After all I've given this city,
all the parking tickets I've paid.

670
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,590
I was planning on paying all my taxes
on top of things...

671
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,860
...only for them to return the favor
by dropping bombs on us in a crisis.

672
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:27,360
What the hell kind of town is this?

673
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,900
Who the hell is this guy?

674
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:31,400
My name is Jacob.

675
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:36,170
Well, Jacob, would you mind shutting
your face while I drive your ass to safety?

676
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,640
I can't think with these stupid noises
coming from your fricking mouth.

677
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:44,110
Heh. My father happens to be a very powerful
congressman, I'll have you know...

678
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,650
...and one day,
I plan on being a state senator.

679
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,650
So I would watch the tone
in which you are speaking.

680
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,560
- ''The tone in which you are speaking''?
- Quit it, Turner.

681
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:54,490
No. Who the hell talks like that?

682
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,430
You wanna know who talks like this?

683
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,160
Your mother,
because I had sex with her last night.

684
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,330
Will both of you just shut the hell up?

685
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,530
Look, I don't know who you think you are...

686
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:07,870
...from what I gather, one of my best friends
died trying to save your worthless life.

687
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:13,010
So please forgive me if I politely ask you
to shut your freaking mouth...

688
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:15,780
...before I kick your ass out of this car!

689
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:20,320
- How's that for a tone, dipshit?
- Turner, just drive the damn car.

690
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,450
I don't know how she picked you
over my brother.

691
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,000
This world just continues to surprise me.

692
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:34,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

693
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,630
What's this?

694
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,470
Hey, get out of the way.

695
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:48,280
Are you deaf? Get out of the way. Come on.

696
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:53,690
- You know, this isn't right. I don't like this.
- What do you want me to do, run her over?

697
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,370
Turner.

698
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:16,010
Put the car in park
and get out of the vehicle.

699
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,610
Everybody, just stay calm, okay?

700
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:31,090
I'm not gonna ask again.

701
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:34,190
Just do what the man says, all right?

702
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:36,830
No.

703
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,860
- What?
- I'm not giving him this car.

704
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,770
Turner, the man has a gun.
Come on, do what he says.

705
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:45,230
You think I can't see that?

706
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:48,000
Don't mess with him, okay?
He just wants the car.

707
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,870
I'm not giving him this goddamn car.

708
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,640
We'll get another car. Just do what he says.

709
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,540
Everybody, hold on.

710
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,210
No, please.

711
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,150
Please don't do this.

712
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:12,730
Get down!

713
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,910
No!

714
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,350
- Oh, my God, Scott.
What--?

715
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,020
- Scott. Scott.
- What happened?

716
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:39,100
- He shot him.
- What?

717
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,330
Scott. Scott.

718
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,100
- Scott, Scott.
- Oh, my God.

719
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:48,230
God, I'm so sorry. Scott.

720
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,170
- Oh, my God.
- Tell me what to do.

721
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:53,100
What should we do? What should we do?

722
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:55,100
- Scott.
- Jesus, Turner, do something.

723
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:58,440
- We don't have time for this. Keep going.
- Scott, I'm so sorry, man.

724
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:01,920
Please forgive me.
This is all my fault. Please forgive me.

725
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,950
Tori, get in the car now. We're going.

726
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,450
- Do something.
- You'll be just fine. Hang in there.

727
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,860
Scott! Scott!

728
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:17,260
- Hey!
- Scott!

729
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:19,960
Scott!

730
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:35,320
- Scott! Scott!
- Turner, he's dead, man.

731
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:40,050
- Scott.
- Okay, we have to go. Come on.

732
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,450
We have to go.

733
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,890
Turner, come on, we have to go.

734
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,050
Scott.

735
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,190
I'm sorry.

736
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:55,070
I'm so sorry.

737
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:20,020
Turner.

738
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:22,360
What are you doing?

739
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,540
Is he okay?

740
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:31,610
Just give us a second.

741
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:51,660
Turner, we have to go.

742
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:57,730
Do you hear me?

743
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,910
It's all my fault.

744
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:07,740
Scott's dead and it's all my fault.

745
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,490
It's not your fault.

746
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:25,790
None of this is your fault.

747
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,070
You did the right thing back there.

748
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,870
Even if the rest of us were too afraid
to admit it.

749
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:41,940
All I wanted to do was save us.

750
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:43,970
I know.

751
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,870
I know.

752
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,850
But, look....

753
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,720
It's over.

754
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:03,390
There's nothing you can do
to bring Scott back.

755
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,640
Or any of our friends.

756
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,710
What's done is done.

757
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,910
We have to keep moving...

758
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,320
...or else we're gonna be next.

759
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,990
Do you understand?

760
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:29,420
Now, the coast is only a few blocks away...

761
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:32,220
...and we don't have a lot of time.

762
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,860
So come on.

763
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,430
Let's go.

764
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:14,970
Hey, isn't that my car?

765
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:38,720
God. Jesus.

766
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:41,020
Looks like something got to him.

767
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,570
What happened?

768
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:46,630
Payback for stealing my car,
that's what happened.

769
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,710
Shut up, Turner.

770
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:20,100
Is he okay?

771
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,300
He's dead.

772
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,990
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

773
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:05,940
<i>--remain calm
and assist family members or neighbors...</i>

774
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:10,810
<i>...who may be vulnerable
if exposed to extreme heat or cold.</i>

775
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:14,180
<i>Locate a flashlight with batteries to use
until power comes back on.</i>

776
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:18,590
<i>Do not use candles, as this can cause a fire.</i>

777
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:23,890
<i>Turn off sensitive electric equipment
such as computers and televisions.</i>

778
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,560
<i>Turn off major electric appliances
that were on when the power went off.</i>

779
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:32,570
<i>This will help to prevent power surges
when electricity is restored.</i>

780
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:36,310
<i>Keep your refrigerator and freezer doors closed
as much as possible...</i>

781
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,570
<i>...to keep cold in and heat out.</i>

782
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,910
<i>Do not use the stove to heat your home.</i>

783
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,850
<i>This can cause a fire or fatal gas leak.</i>

784
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:48,750
<i>Use extreme caution when driving.</i>

785
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:53,220
<i>- Listen to news radio stations for updates--</i>
- Stop. Stop. Stop.

786
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:55,200
Please. I can't.

787
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,260
I can't.

788
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,800
Wait. What?

789
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,730
We can't stop.

790
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,500
It's not much further. Come on.

791
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:05,600
I can't.

792
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:07,470
Look at me.

793
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,340
Look at me.

794
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,440
We have to keep moving.

795
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,650
I'm sorry.

796
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:20,450
It's okay.
It's just a few more blocks. I promise.

797
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,490
No.

798
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:29,000
I mean, I'm sorry that I left you.

799
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:36,910
It's all my fault, you know.

800
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:40,280
And I just....

801
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:47,610
I just needed you to know that I'm sorry.

802
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,430
I know.

803
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,970
Oh, my God. Oh, my-- Come on. Come on.

804
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:21,610
- Turner.
- You guys go.

805
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,350
- Don't give me that crap.
- I know what I'm doing, okay?

806
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,080
- We'll never make it unless I distract them.
- No, we can make it.

807
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:28,380
Just do what I say!

808
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,620
I make my own decisions, remember?

809
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:32,420
Now, go!

810
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:35,690
Turner. Turner!

811
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,260
- Turner!
- Come on.

812
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:38,930
No.

813
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:42,800
Hey, over here!

814
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,970
Come get me.

815
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:31,710
Goodbye, brother.
