00:00:58,696 --> 00:01:02,827
DARKNESS CANNOT DRIVE OUT DARKNESS.

2
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:08,370
ONLY LIGHT CAN DO THAT.
- MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.

3
00:01:18,858 --> 00:01:22,019
<i>1926. Macon, Georgia

4
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:27,641
The only thing I ever
knew was cotton.

5
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:31,972
It was hard work.

6
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,663
...and you know the cotton is
ready when the bulb splits,

7
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:43,470
and the bulb is star shaped,
like a big old star

8
00:01:43,612 --> 00:01:49,018
in the sky. Like your big ol'
head. Oh, that's some kind!

9
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:56,379
But I didn't mind because I got to
spend all day with my dad.

10
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:59,073
Hurry up and take this picture.
- Take a picture of you?

11
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,034
Why don't everybody smile?

12
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:14,909
Hattie, come on. I need
your help in the shed.

13
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:17,344
Come on.

14
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:29,625
Pa, where is he taking ma?
- Get back to work!

15
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:33,871
Cecil, get back to work!

16
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:37,920
Mamma! - Come here.

17
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:43,129
Look at me boy. Don't lose
your temper with that man.

18
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:47,528
This is his world. We just
living in it. You hear me?

19
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:49,957
Now get on back to work!

20
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:23,414
Pa, what you gonna do?

21
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:30,090
Hey!

22
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:46,052
Dad!

23
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:04,744
What are you looking at?! Huh?

24
00:04:04,902 --> 00:04:08,076
Who wants to go next?
You get back to work!

25
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:21,229
Hey you, get some of the hands to
help dig a hole for his pa. Hurry up!

26
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,418
Stop crying.

27
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:36,448
I'm gonna have you
in the house now.

28
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:44,897
I'm gonna teach you how
to be a house nigger.

29
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:53,833
INSPIRED BY THE TRUE STORY

30
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:59,448
He's commin'. - Yes, sir.
- And quiet when you're serving.

31
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:03,140
I don't even want to hear
you breathe. - Yes, ma'am.

32
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:17,443
It was much nicer working in the
house than in the field.

33
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:21,134
Crazy, make it from the left.

34
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:28,350
Give me more.

35
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:02,431
When I got older, I knew I had to
go before he killed me too.

36
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:10,069
Part of me was scared to leave,

37
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:13,198
it was the only world I ever knew.

38
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,074
Ma, I took pa's watch.

39
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:34,239
Ma?

40
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:37,665
Ma, I'm leavin'.

41
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:42,666
My mamma never spoke much after that.

42
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:47,030
I knew she'd miss me.
But I also knew

43
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,456
she wanted me to leave that place.

44
00:06:58,046 --> 00:07:01,334
And even though
Miss Annabeth never said it,

45
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,135
I knew she'd miss me too.

46
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:22,331
I don't think God meant for people
to not have a family.

47
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:34,429
Outside the cotton fields was even
worse than I thought it'd be.

48
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:40,655
No one would give me a job, or
food, or a place to sleep.

49
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:52,000
Any white man could kill
any of us at any time...

50
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,376
and not be punished for it.

51
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:58,923
The law wasn't on our side.

52
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,456
The law was against us.

53
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:13,399
I was hungry all the time.

54
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:44,290
You know what could
happen to you, son?

55
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,080
Get up.

56
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,314
I said get up.

57
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:07,085
I'm going to have to lie to the
boss man about that window.

58
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,473
Good Lord says you
ain't supposed to lie.

59
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:13,418
Sorry sir.

60
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,663
Where's your ma and your pa?

61
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,927
My Ma crazy in the head
and my Pa got killed.

62
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,786
I'ma make you some ham sandwiches

63
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:28,948
and send you on your way.

64
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:34,639
The boss will be here any minute.
Sunday's our busiest morning.

65
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:39,306
You looking for some help?
I know how to serve.

66
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:44,095
You done broke our window.
You done stole our food.

67
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:47,681
And now you asking for a job?
- Back in Macon, I'ma house nigger.

68
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:48,933
A good one.

69
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:55,263
Don't you ever use that word son.

70
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:59,767
That's the white man's word.
It's filled with hate.

71
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:03,380
Didn't your father
teach you any better?

72
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,453
Slow down! - Yes, sir.

73
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,203
You gotta look 'em in their eyes.

74
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:20,465
See what it is they want, got it?
- Sure, Mr Maynard, I got it!

75
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:29,678
See what it is they need...

76
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Right this way.

77
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:35,237
Anticipate.

78
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:46,580
I'm - I'm sorry ma'am.

79
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:53,358
When you smile with
the eyes, be principle.

80
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:02,941
Perfect!

81
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:09,800
Don't forget to save me chitlins.
- Why do you like chitlins so much?

82
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:14,865
Cuz, it's good eating. The manager
of the Excelsior in DC,

83
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:20,158
he came by yesterday.
He offered me a job as a butler.

84
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,641
They must be paying you
top dollar, huh boss?

85
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:28,498
Yeah...I was thinking
about taking it.

86
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:32,678
But I dunno, I'm too old to
be leaving North Carolina.

87
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:35,903
I'm just fine right here.

88
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:40,156
I told them to hire you.

89
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:42,610
I'm just now finding my
way 'round this hotel.

90
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:45,340
I'm not ready for those
high falootin' white people

91
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,934
with all their fancy words.
- Cecil, we got two faces.

92
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:53,937
Ours, and the ones that we
got to show the white folks.

93
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,201
Now to get up in the world,

94
00:11:57,262 --> 00:12:00,744
you have to make them feel
nonthreatened.

95
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:05,575
Use that all fancy
words that I taught you.

96
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,988
White folks up north, they
like some uppity coloreds.

97
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,952
Yeah.

98
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:18,795
<i>1957. Washington, DC

99
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:22,722
When I took that job up in
Washington, DC,

100
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:26,975
it was the most beautiful
hotel I had ever seen.

101
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:36,792
I hope I wasn't too
presumptuous to have prepared

102
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:40,156
a few spirits after your
long journey in from Buffalo.

103
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:46,107
Best decision that court ever made
was to slow this whole mess down.

104
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:49,749
Nigger boys in school with white girls?!
Who ever heard of such a thing?

105
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:53,063
Next thing you know
they'd be fornicatin'.

106
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:57,932
Gentlemen, this is different.
We could start another Civil War.

107
00:12:59,457 --> 00:13:03,495
Cecil, what do you think about niggers
going to school with white children?

108
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:06,437
To be honest with you, Mr. Jenkins,

109
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,625
I tend to not to be too concerned
with American or European politics.

110
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:16,253
Nor should you, Cecil,
they're all criminals.

111
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:18,797
Earl Warren should be
shot and hanged.

112
00:13:19,105 --> 00:13:23,461
That dumb son of bitch judge
is trying to integrate our schools.

113
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:28,940
I think, judge Warren is going to
find that quite a challenge.

114
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:32,041
Damn right, Cecil! Damn right!

115
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:37,225
Never in my life did I dream that I would
work in a place as fancy as this.

116
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,562
I never dreamed
my life could be so good.

117
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:53,554
Gloria and I met
working at the Excelsior.

118
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:57,196
She was a maid at the
hotel. But now,

119
00:13:57,207 --> 00:14:00,051
her only job was
raising our two boys.

120
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:06,724
I made sure that they never
laid eyes on a cotton field.

121
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,817
I gotta pee.

122
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,870
Not today. Don't try that.
Finish that homework.

123
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:17,878
Where's Louis at?
- He's taking the trash out.

124
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:20,574
Working late again, huh?
How was your shift?

125
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:22,904
Beats working for a livin'.

126
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:25,856
I miss you at night, honey.

127
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,592
Didn't you say you gotta pee?
Go ahead then.

128
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:35,270
Wash your hands when you come
out of that bathroom, boy.

129
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:40,846
Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

130
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:51,251
Hey dad! - Hey Louis.
You alright? - Yeah, I'm fine.

131
00:14:52,544 --> 00:14:55,227
That woman whose son got killed,

132
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,853
she's around doing speeches now.
What's her name, honey?

133
00:14:59,705 --> 00:15:02,447
Mamie Till. - Mamie Till...

134
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,780
I remember that story
just like it was yesterday

135
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,598
even though it was three years ago.

136
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:12,849
It was dis-damn-graceful
what they did to that boy

137
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:15,637
just for looking at a white woman...

138
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,641
Beat him up,
threw his body in the river...

139
00:15:20,762 --> 00:15:24,713
Killed him. He was just 14
at the time.

140
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:27,002
Crazy white folks down south.

141
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:30,279
Thanks, ma. - At least we have
it a little better here in DC, huh?

142
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,070
Still treating us bad too.
- Get on down here Charlie!

143
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,346
Wash your hands. - Louis said we
should stop taking the white man's shit.

144
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,774
Watch your mouth.
- Watch your mouth.

145
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:44,143
Hello, Gaines' residence.

146
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,900
Uh, yeah... Hold on Mr. Kidgan.
It's the boss man dad.

147
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,459
What's he calling for?

148
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,581
When the white man called,
I always assumed the worst.

149
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:59,081
Yes sir? - I would have
put money on it,

150
00:15:59,112 --> 00:16:02,526
that I was getting laid off
or something that day.

151
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,390
Would you follow me, please?
- Yes, sir.

152
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,321
I'm Cecil Gaines. It's a pleasure to
meet you. - You as well. Have a seat.

153
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:02,938
Are you political, Mr. Gaines?
- No, sir.

154
00:17:03,132 --> 00:17:08,477
Good, we have no tolerance for
politics at the White House.

155
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,508
How did you find me?
- I didn't.

156
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,247
You served RD Warner at
the Excelsior Hotel.

157
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,107
He oversees operations
for the entire White House.

158
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:21,108
You made quite an impression.
- I don't recall.

159
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:24,453
Mr. Warner and myself make note
of potential staff around town.

160
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:30,015
Butler positions rarely open as
most stay on for 30 years or more.

161
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,527
I know I was quite surprised
when I got the call.

162
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:40,027
It was a surprise for me as well.

163
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:44,453
As the White House Maitre D',
I normally hire the butlers.

164
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,701
Forgive me for saying this,
Mr. Fallows,

165
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,585
I certainly wouldn't
want to be hired

166
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:55,778
under circumstances that would
make you feel uncomfortable.

167
00:17:56,663 --> 00:18:00,552
Oh, really? - You need butlers
that you've hand picked,

168
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,580
men to your liking that
will fulfill your vision

169
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,336
of a proper White House staff.

170
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:27,085
Is that...Louis Trace?

171
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:32,308
These decanters are
replicas of metal flasks

172
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:38,157
that were found on the
battlefield in Jarnac. Correct?

173
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:40,775
The Italians,
they know their wines,

174
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:44,287
and the Irish certainly know how to
make a great whiskey.

175
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:47,740
But I believe the French

176
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,910
have a distinct advantage
when it comes to cognac.

177
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:55,603
Is that right?

178
00:18:58,324 --> 00:19:01,730
Oh yeah, you'll make
a good house nigga.

179
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:05,523
Would you care for a demitasse?

180
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:10,032
"I wish I knew some other way..."

181
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:13,190
Sometimes it be just me
and Faye up in here.

182
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,313
Me, Faye, and a little
scotch.

183
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:25,696
Say it, Faye!

184
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:28,804
What did you do to this potato salad?
- I'll tell you what I did.

185
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:32,062
I put some dill in it, because
I read in Women's Day,

186
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:35,711
where pickles drown out the flavor
and dill bring up the flavor.

187
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:40,562
That's what you tasting right there.
- Oh, okay. Yeah, I like it.

188
00:19:41,107 --> 00:19:43,885
It makes a different, dont' they?
- It really does.

189
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:48,147
You must be so proud of Cecil.
- You know he got that job by himself.

190
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:50,404
The White House called him,
he didn't call the White House.

191
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:52,666
He's a good man.
You got a good man.

192
00:19:52,697 --> 00:19:54,152
She fun man!

193
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:58,639
Not like this one right here.
Little sourpuss still mad at me.

194
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,681
I got reason.
- No you don't.

195
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,838
I told you I went down to
the number spot.

196
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:06,461
Played my little numbers,
got me some barbecue,

197
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:09,143
and I went down. I didn't even
get nothing to drink!

198
00:20:09,244 --> 00:20:13,899
I'm so - I'm so sick of these
number spot stories, Howard.

199
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,875
How you expect me to believe you
was down at the number spot...

200
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:20,038
Believe or not, it was true.
- Come on, come on, stop this mess.

201
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,765
Come on y'all. Come on...

202
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:23,436
If you don't believe,
you don't have to believe but...

203
00:20:26,835 --> 00:20:30,470
Stop this mess, right now.
We are here to celebrate.

204
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:33,834
So y'all could be nice just one time.
- Baby, come on. Get over here.

205
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:36,131
Celebrate!

206
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:40,172
That's right. I'll make you happy.
- Y'all need to get a room!

207
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,899
What? - Ain't that the truth!
Or something...

208
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:46,179
He just drive me crazy!
He just...

209
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:51,041
You, uh... you wanna
come to the room? - No.

210
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:55,525
Hey where are the boys at?
- They upstairs playing.

211
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:59,291
Boys! Get down here!
I need to see your face now!

212
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:01,619
What y'all doing up there?
- Cecil, congratulations.

213
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,393
Honey, when you gonna take me
to the White House?

214
00:21:03,414 --> 00:21:05,741
You wanna go to the
White House, baby?

215
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:09,566
You know I wanna go to White
House. - When you want to go?

216
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,630
Don't play with me now,
you know I want to go.

217
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:14,861
The White House,
that's a big step up.

218
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:18,980
It is exciting. - Girl, you are
up in that house now!

219
00:21:19,197 --> 00:21:21,237
I want to hear <i>all</i> of the stories.

220
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:22,737
I don't know how many
stories you gonna hear,

221
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:24,882
'cus they done swore
him to some kind of

222
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:27,381
secret code and he
can't tell me nothin'.

223
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:29,581
No, no, no. Girl,
you give it to him right.

224
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,751
He'll tell you everything!
- That's the key right there.

225
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,173
You listening?
Did you hear her?

226
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:38,059
Whom do you giving to?
- Crazy. - You got at home.

227
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,300
I can give it to you.

228
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:41,386
I don't know what are
you talking about. - Elroy!

229
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:46,524
Here they come.

230
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:48,829
Boys stop running through this
house, you know better than that.

231
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,233
Elroy, get over here.
Come here.

232
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:56,517
Give me some money.

233
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,226
Nah... Tell them...

234
00:22:00,297 --> 00:22:02,307
Tell them what you gonna
be when you grow up.

235
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:05,105
I wanna work at the White House
just like Mr. Gaines.

236
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:08,070
That's my boy! - Mine too.
- Alright.

237
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:11,404
Louis! What you gonna
be when you grow up?

238
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,908
You gonna work at a White
House just like your daddy?

239
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:17,646
I don't know.

240
00:22:17,747 --> 00:22:21,403
I'll tell ya exactly what I wanna
be when I start a thing.

241
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:23,912
Yeah, a number runner!

242
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,216
I'm Cecil Gaines.
I'm the new butler.

243
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,907
Yes, sir.

244
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:38,312
There are 16 full time maid,
we are 6 butlers,

245
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:41,178
4 carpenters, 2 painters,
7 electricians,

246
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:43,872
3 dishwashers, 3 doorman,
a full kitchen staff including

247
00:22:43,883 --> 00:22:45,733
pastry chef and 3 full
time calligraphers.

248
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:49,266
2 painters, 7 electricians,
9 engineers...

249
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:51,201
Here comes Warner.

250
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:56,867
Mr. Warner, I wanted to thank you for
this opportunity to work in the Whi...

251
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:05,860
Come on. Here we go.

252
00:23:08,642 --> 00:23:12,150
Ma'am, I'm Cecil Gaines,
I'll be working with you here.

253
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:15,331
Mr. Gaines, please don't
do that. Come on. - Yes, sir.

254
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:18,710
When lifting a plate,
never scrape the bottom.

255
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:22,341
Never listen or react to
a conversation.

256
00:23:22,706 --> 00:23:26,892
The room should feel...
- Emptiness. When I'm in.

257
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:30,807
...so then she says...

258
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:35,285
Then she says, "Stick
two fingers". "Okay."

259
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,769
Then she starts yelling out,
"Stick your whole hand in!”

260
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:42,453
So I put my whole hand in.

261
00:23:42,939 --> 00:23:45,944
Then she yells out,
"Put both hands in!".

262
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:48,132
Okay.

263
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:52,505
Then she screams, "Now
clap!". I say, "I can't."

264
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:57,276
She looks up, smiles and says,
"See, I told you my stuff was tight."

265
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:02,148
Hey, there he is! I heard you were
coming. What's your name, brother?

266
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:06,535
Cecil. Cecil Gaines.
- I'm Carter Wilson, head butler.

267
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:08,971
Don't worry about Big
Mo behind you. That brother

268
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:10,482
will steal your wallet
before you even knew it.

269
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:13,572
This brother in the mirror over here,
his name's James Holloway,

270
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,431
he's my second in command.
- James?

271
00:24:15,532 --> 00:24:17,319
Jackie Robinson or Willie Mays?

272
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,634
Why don't you shake the man's hand first

273
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:20,550
'fore you start asking
difficult questions like that?

274
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,601
I just want to know
where the man's coming from.

275
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:24,719
Look like the jury is still out
on that one, alright?

276
00:24:25,469 --> 00:24:27,795
Welcome. Fancy
Freddie give you the tour yet?

277
00:24:27,806 --> 00:24:30,802
He did. Are the Dodgers losing?

278
00:24:30,823 --> 00:24:32,226
I might be able to
answer that question

279
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:34,968
if Carter over here stop
running his nasty mouth?

280
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:36,961
Cut that shit, let's get to work.

281
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:02,121
Ready! - Lord, help us.

282
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,134
Don't be nervous man.
Just go on and get to it.

283
00:25:26,982 --> 00:25:31,486
You hear nothing, you see nothing.
You only serve.

284
00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:56,048
Send federal troops to Little Rock?
- If it comes to it, yes.

285
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:57,511
<i>1957.
The Eisenhower Administration

286
00:25:57,532 --> 00:26:02,829
I can't see any situation where I'd
send troops to the South. Ever.

287
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:08,653
It would cause another Civil War.
- Sir, if the Federal government

288
00:26:08,674 --> 00:26:11,710
doesn't enforce Brown,
then who will?

289
00:26:12,026 --> 00:26:14,440
The South must comply
with the law.

290
00:26:14,595 --> 00:26:17,435
It's just going to take some time
to adjust, that's all.

291
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:18,906
I understand, Mr. President,

292
00:26:18,997 --> 00:26:22,911
but if Faubus continues to block the
negro children, then what do we do?

293
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:25,372
We must enforce the Constitution.

294
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,951
Give Faubus more time.

295
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:30,101
With a little persuading,
he'll back down.

296
00:26:30,102 --> 00:26:32,243
We just want to move slowly.

297
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,585
How'd it go?
- I almost shit myself.

298
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,301
I dated a girl once. Every time I
hit it, she shit herself.

299
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:51,904
Shut up.
- You shut up.

300
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:53,845
I put a towel down.

301
00:26:55,911 --> 00:26:58,037
<i>Marcella said the
very same thing last night

302
00:26:58,068 --> 00:27:00,745
<i>just before I put her to sleep.

303
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:10,384
<i>You put her...
- Just like I did Ed.

304
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:14,110
<i>I do it real quick.

305
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,682
Popcorn all over sofa!

306
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,821
Your dad's gonna kill you.
- Hey dad. - Hey.

307
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:31,557
Hi, Mr. Gaines. - Hey Elroy.

308
00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:36,318
Louis, I told you about letting
the kids watch that show.

309
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:38,883
It's too scary.
They're too young for it.

310
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:41,041
Turn it off.

311
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:45,789
Where's your mamma at?

312
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,548
Miss Gloria tried staying up,
but she went to sleep.

313
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,728
Elroy, nobody asked you nothin'.

314
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,676
Take your butt home before
your mamma come in here

315
00:27:52,697 --> 00:27:55,316
and whoop the both of us.
- Come on dad. - Go on.

316
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,063
Bye. - Turn it off.

317
00:28:05,136 --> 00:28:07,500
Don't go stomping up the stairs
and wake your mom up.

318
00:28:07,695 --> 00:28:09,695
MAMIE TILL
"SPEAKS OUT"

319
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:21,402
What is that? Is that
Mamie Till stuff?

320
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:24,955
I want to go to this.
- Absolutely not.

321
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:30,416
How come?

322
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,283
Ain't no good
gonna come of that.

323
00:28:33,897 --> 00:28:35,397
Dad, you hear what mom said?

324
00:28:35,418 --> 00:28:37,017
That mess right
there happen down south.

325
00:28:37,037 --> 00:28:39,512
This could have been me.
- It happened down south.

326
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,203
I got out of there so we
could have us a better life.

327
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,722
Right now, I'm working for the white
man, make things better for us.

328
00:28:45,753 --> 00:28:50,218
And not just any white man, either.
Put the lights off. Go to bed.

329
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,687
I have your chicken soup,
Mr. President.

330
00:29:10,803 --> 00:29:13,291
Just set it on the table, Cecil.
- Yes, sir.

331
00:29:17,562 --> 00:29:20,277
Did you ever complete school, Cecil?

332
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:25,571
I didn't go to school, Mr. President.
I grew up on a cotton farm.

333
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:29,639
I grew up on a farm.
Do you have any children?

334
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:35,246
Yes, I have two sons. - Do they
go to an all colored school?

335
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:37,424
Yes, sir. They do.

336
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,248
What is it?

337
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:48,840
The State Guard just blocked
all the colored kids again.

338
00:29:48,861 --> 00:29:51,850
Faubus promised me the guards
would escort the kids in.

339
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,401
The Governor of Arkansas
lied, Mr. President.

340
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,877
What is wrong with him?!
Why is he forcing me to do this?

341
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:08,055
Our next move needs to be
bold and swift.

342
00:30:12,155 --> 00:30:17,349
<i>I have today issued an Executive
Order directing the use of troops

343
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,281
<i>under Federal authority
to aid in the execution

344
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:25,163
<i>of Federal law at Little Rock, Arkansas.

345
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,364
When the President sent those
troops down to Little Rock,

346
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:32,931
it was the first time I'd ever seen

347
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:35,648
a white man stick
his neck out for us.

348
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:40,755
I told Louis that the President was
going to make things better for us.

349
00:30:42,044 --> 00:30:45,458
Your graduations are long.
She was so nosy!

350
00:30:45,575 --> 00:30:47,396
I'm gonna make some potato salad.

351
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:50,121
Now he could see I knew
what I was talking about.

352
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:52,209
That was wonderful.
I'm so proud of you.

353
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,561
Thanks, mamma.
- That hat looks stupid.

354
00:30:56,306 --> 00:30:57,931
Your face looks stupid.

355
00:30:59,686 --> 00:31:01,593
I'm proud of you too.

356
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:04,954
Dad, did you see...
- Don't start up in there!

357
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,969
Did you see one
white kid in my school?

358
00:31:18,057 --> 00:31:22,443
Why couldn't Louis see that the
President made things better for us?

359
00:31:23,854 --> 00:31:25,478
Good luck. - Thanks.

360
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,016
Thank you.

361
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:39,961
Boy, I told you're gonna be late!
You can't miss this bus!

362
00:31:42,053 --> 00:31:46,733
Wait, wait, wait! We gotta say
goodbye. This can wait!

363
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:55,069
Tennessee is a long ways away Pops.

364
00:31:55,271 --> 00:31:57,918
Fisk is a really good school, dad.

365
00:31:58,945 --> 00:32:01,251
You can change your mind and
go to Howard. - I cannot believe

366
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,216
you are still talking
about Howard University.

367
00:32:04,441 --> 00:32:06,775
He's going to Fisk! - I know.

368
00:32:06,796 --> 00:32:10,652
I know, it's just - it's just
so far away. That's all.

369
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,082
That's the point.
- What's the point?

370
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:18,397
Gimme a cigarette. And don't
tell me you don't smoke.

371
00:32:18,498 --> 00:32:23,277
I don't have one. Come here.
You know you wanna cry punk.

372
00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:25,002
Not for you.

373
00:32:25,574 --> 00:32:27,471
Look under your mattress.
I left something.

374
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:29,174
I can't protect him in the south.

375
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:32,091
The south has changed Cecil.
- I'm too young for Playboys.

376
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:34,142
The south ain't what it was
when you was there.

377
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:36,962
Mom, Louis is leaving me
his filthy magazines.

378
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,403
Stop lying on your brother.

379
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:43,842
I love you momma.
- I love you, son.

380
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,375
I love you Louis.

381
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:49,279
I made you a ham sandwich.
- Thanks, mom.

382
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,072
Come on, dad.

383
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,011
You're the first.

384
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:10,391
I know.

385
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:13,197
I'm really proud of you.

386
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:15,454
I gotta go dad.

387
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,825
I gotta go.

388
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:31,768
If you need anything,
you call me. - Alright.

389
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:33,663
Alright?

390
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:35,683
Bye, mamma.

391
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:43,238
Bye, Louis.

392
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:54,561
It's all right.

393
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:06,814
Remind me again, why we're doing
this please, somebody? Tell me?

394
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:09,457
That look like a mugging to me,
this that what that look like.

395
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:11,512
This is the art of french baking.

396
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:14,503
Nigro, please.
Art of french baking...

397
00:34:14,564 --> 00:34:18,055
This is absolutelly
nothing. This is, I don't...

398
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,063
Always so simple. - You want me
to play with it? I'll play with it.

399
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:25,242
Playing with it like this.
It'd be good if it had a little...

400
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:27,635
...a little nipple on it.
- Come on, man!

401
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:30,315
This is how you
playing, you shake it.

402
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:34,719
Good evening, Mr. Vice President.

403
00:34:36,414 --> 00:34:38,516
That looks like a tasty treat.

404
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,108
Yes, sir.

405
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,639
I brought you all something.

406
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,977
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

407
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:53,375
I don't want to say anything
negative about that Kennedy boy.

408
00:34:53,396 --> 00:34:55,296
I'm sure he's a real nice fellow,

409
00:34:55,317 --> 00:34:58,132
but do you really want that
spoiled rich son of a bitch fuck

410
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:01,772
to be your next president?

411
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:04,464
Think about it.

412
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,025
We're cheering for you,
Mr Vice president.

413
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:13,857
Thank you, Cecil.

414
00:35:16,597 --> 00:35:18,771
Let me ask you something,
in all candor,

415
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:23,817
as members of the Negro community,
what are your biggest concerns?

416
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:30,632
Come on now boys.

417
00:35:30,908 --> 00:35:32,503
Don't be shy.

418
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,257
Holloway, come on.

419
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:40,390
Well, since you
asked, sir... - I did.

420
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,739
...the colored help gets paid almost
40% less than the white help.

421
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,478
Is that right? - Yes, sir.

422
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:51,006
And it's very difficult for the
colored staff to be promoted.

423
00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:53,922
I'll tell ya what,

424
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:55,790
when I'm President I'm gonna
look into getting you boys

425
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:58,412
the raises and
promotions you deserve.

426
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:02,369
That-that would be swell, sir.
- You got my word on that.

427
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,955
Thank you, sir.

428
00:36:04,786 --> 00:36:06,734
You tell your people
to vote for me

429
00:36:06,795 --> 00:36:09,311
and that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

430
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,243
Give this to somebody.

431
00:36:37,555 --> 00:36:39,880
<i>1960. Fisk University

432
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:43,370
Carol, please. - Like that one?

433
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,507
I'm talking about you.

434
00:36:59,645 --> 00:37:00,924
Hey.

435
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:04,546
You lookin' for love, boy?

436
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,793
That's what we call the Lawson
workshop, the love school.

437
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:14,319
Is that what you're lookin' for?
- That's why I came to Fisk.

438
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:17,503
Me too!

439
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:25,073
I'm Carol Hammie.
- Louis Gaines.

440
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,447
Come on. Follow me.

441
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:31,986
You a country boy, ain't you?

442
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,084
He's a doctor.

443
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,845
...nor could you sustain it in
over a month. This requires time,

444
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:45,729
commitment, dedication,
discipline and focus.

445
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,100
And we are measuring our
accomplishments in waves. Right?

446
00:37:49,181 --> 00:37:51,476
This is not a fly-by-night affair,
this doesn't happen over a week,

447
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:55,427
this requires a fierce discipline,
which is what we've been discussing.

448
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:57,741
How do we measure
these things? We go back

449
00:37:57,841 --> 00:37:59,934
and look at someone
like Ghandi. Together,

450
00:37:59,995 --> 00:38:02,572
we are going to study and
examine Ghandi's techniques.

451
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:05,872
What has been so effective in
South Africa, so effective in India,

452
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,559
for his own people and others,

453
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:11,191
and we're gonna employ it
right here, in Nashville.

454
00:38:11,212 --> 00:38:13,882
So we're gonna form
an army, you and I.

455
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,022
This army has one weapon,
and that weapon is love.

456
00:38:18,223 --> 00:38:19,867
Now I am of the...Yes?

457
00:38:20,226 --> 00:38:23,518
If our only weapon is love
and their weapons are...

458
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:27,832
Weapons - isn't that dangerous?
- Oh, you can be killed.

459
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:30,463
If anyone is uncomfortable with
that, you know where the door is.

460
00:38:30,494 --> 00:38:33,400
I understand that sounds
provocative, but it's true.

461
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,408
Alright kids.
It's show time.

462
00:38:58,323 --> 00:39:02,038
Ghandi has demonstrated
for us that a brown man,

463
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,389
in his native land, or anywhere
that he is being oppressed,

464
00:39:06,717 --> 00:39:11,188
can pull himself out of segregation
with patience, with persistence,

465
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:14,010
with intelligence and
thought. With discipline...

466
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:20,600
...and a bit of a
sense of humor.

467
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,138
COLORED

468
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:32,526
You know y'all can't sit here.

469
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:34,446
We would like to
be served, please.

470
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,090
This is unprecedented
what we're talking about.

471
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:40,593
But it needs a patience that
none of us have ever seen.

472
00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:42,543
You can order food
in the colored section,

473
00:39:42,594 --> 00:39:44,790
but I'm not going to be
serving you here.

474
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:48,479
We are organized. We have
a leader with every group.

475
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,013
We have lookouts,
with pocket change,

476
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,578
and the local phone numbers
for ambulances ready.

477
00:39:53,781 --> 00:39:56,407
And when one wave comes off that
lunch counter, what follows?

478
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:58,385
A whole another wave of negro
students sitting right there

479
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,104
at that lunch counter
blowing their minds.

480
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:02,607
We would like to be served, please.

481
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:07,882
Now, who wants to role play?

482
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:10,972
Jim, I need your
help over here.

483
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:13,239
Now, y'all know you're not
supposed to sit there.

484
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,292
Attack! - Get up, niger!
- This is an experiment.

485
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,365
So you need to do whatever
it takes to break their spirit.

486
00:40:20,366 --> 00:40:22,426
Come on, get up!
- Use the language.

487
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,942
I need to hear nigger
coming out of your mouth.

488
00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:25,795
I need to hear coon. - I don't feel
comfortable saying that.

489
00:40:25,896 --> 00:40:28,621
You came here to get yourself
prepared, and get her prepared.

490
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:30,843
So let me hear it, now!

491
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,622
Nigger. - Louder.

492
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:36,050
Say the words
like you mean it!

493
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:39,106
Nigger! - Louder.
- You are a nigger!

494
00:40:40,257 --> 00:40:42,316
You need to be sitting
in the colored seating.

495
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,669
This is not for you! You
cannot be served here!

496
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,712
You need to do what was
told is sitting in your place.

497
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:49,583
You are a nigger!
- Make her believe it!

498
00:40:49,684 --> 00:40:52,216
You know is there
where colored people sit.

499
00:40:52,476 --> 00:40:55,802
You see this people over here?
They're in their section over here.

500
00:40:57,756 --> 00:40:59,538
Get up! Get up, you nigger!

501
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:02,505
If you want us to shop in this
establishment, make them go!

502
00:41:02,606 --> 00:41:04,549
Come on, Robert.
Let's go.

503
00:41:23,376 --> 00:41:25,180
Get up, monkey!
- What is this?!

504
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,643
Get up! Come on, get up!

505
00:41:38,544 --> 00:41:40,866
What are you doing here?

506
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,406
What are you reading?
Nigers can read, ha?

507
00:41:57,466 --> 00:42:00,345
What, are you stupid? You're a nigger
lover now? - Get up! Get up!

508
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,052
You hear me?!

509
00:42:03,037 --> 00:42:05,143
Disrespect, fuckin', ha?

510
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:09,908
Stop it! Stop it!

511
00:42:14,768 --> 00:42:18,247
Get up! Get up, niggers!
Look at me!

512
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:42,580
Want some more pomfri?

513
00:43:06,518 --> 00:43:09,434
To serving our country.
- To serving our country.

514
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,422
You are all sentenced to
30 days in the county jail.

515
00:43:57,219 --> 00:44:00,441
Get those niggers out of here.

516
00:44:22,668 --> 00:44:25,327
Something special's
going on down here, dad.

517
00:44:28,203 --> 00:44:31,153
What's so special about
another colored man in jail?

518
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:36,384
What are you doing with my
hard earned money, Pops?

519
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,665
Are you even in school?
- I'm trying to change the way

520
00:44:39,686 --> 00:44:42,119
negroes are perceived...
- You're breaking the law!

521
00:44:42,673 --> 00:44:46,443
That judge just sentenced you to
30 days in the County Work House.

522
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:49,212
You'll get killed. - If I can't
sit at any lunch counter

523
00:44:49,243 --> 00:44:51,564
I want then I might
as well be dead.

524
00:44:51,765 --> 00:44:53,270
But dad, we're fighting
for our rights. - Fight?!

525
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:54,803
Boy, what are you talking about?
- We're going to change nation's

526
00:44:54,844 --> 00:44:57,285
consciousness toward the American
negro. - And postcards you sent me?

527
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,730
You're a damn liar!
Hey!

528
00:45:02,651 --> 00:45:05,600
Who do you think you're talking to?
I brought you into this world

529
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:07,783
and I'll take you out of it.

530
00:45:40,265 --> 00:45:44,490
Y'all been able to talk to him?
- Talk to who? - Louis.

531
00:45:45,504 --> 00:45:47,495
Yeah, we talk to him.

532
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,167
He said he joined something
called the "Freedom Riders",

533
00:45:50,268 --> 00:45:52,432
whatever the hell
that's supposed to mean.

534
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:54,969
You gonna see him?

535
00:45:55,069 --> 00:45:57,693
I've been fixing to trying to
see him. Every time I do,

536
00:45:57,794 --> 00:46:01,750
Cecil get all riled up so I don't
know when that's gonna happen.

537
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:04,000
Fixing to trying...
See that's the problem.

538
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:06,673
You gotta stop trying
and you just got to do it.

539
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,085
He take you
to the White House yet?

540
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,688
No. Cecil say we goin' soon.

541
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,177
Cecil say, Cecil say...

542
00:46:17,072 --> 00:46:20,170
Four years. That's what makes
you a little bit gullible darling.

543
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:23,718
Yeah, I don't understand why he can't
get the President to do something.

544
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:26,609
You see, Ginam that's your problem.
You just say stupid stuff.

545
00:46:26,723 --> 00:46:31,675
The President's got more to do than
be thinking about Louis' foolishness.

546
00:46:32,662 --> 00:46:38,257
You know, why don't you just shut
up? It's just a mess! Be nice!

547
00:46:38,661 --> 00:46:41,560
Who told you, you
could tell me to shut up?

548
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:45,594
Well, you... - Go get me a drink.
I want some scotch.

549
00:46:47,415 --> 00:46:52,115
Well, I personally think Louis gonna
get every one of us killed.

550
00:46:52,414 --> 00:46:55,123
They comin' to get us, they
comin' to get us...

551
00:46:56,299 --> 00:46:58,434
He crazy like his mamma.

552
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:01,271
I meant it in a good way!

553
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,361
I'm sorry! Im sorry...

554
00:47:15,781 --> 00:47:18,471
The President lives at the White House

555
00:47:18,572 --> 00:47:21,538
until the moment
the next one is sworn in.

556
00:47:21,907 --> 00:47:27,309
So the staff has exactly two hours
during the inauguration ceremony

557
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:31,667
to move the old President out
and move the new one in.

558
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,487
They say this new
white boy is smooth.

559
00:47:35,508 --> 00:47:37,017
<i>1961. The Kennedy Administration

560
00:47:37,058 --> 00:47:39,320
I just need to get
my butt home to Gloria.

561
00:47:39,351 --> 00:47:41,807
These hours are killing us.

562
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:46,593
How's your boy doing, Cecil?
- Gentlemen, the President's arriving.

563
00:47:51,646 --> 00:47:53,928
Where should we start?
- I'm not sure. This end?

564
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:56,134
Maybe over here? - Thank you.
- Right this way Mr. President.

565
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:59,205
Hello, everyone.
- Hello, Mr. President!

566
00:48:00,062 --> 00:48:03,678
I'm thrilled to be working with all
of you over the next four years.

567
00:48:03,976 --> 00:48:05,956
Eight years, Jack.

568
00:48:08,008 --> 00:48:10,439
Well, you see who wears
the pants around here.

569
00:48:11,215 --> 00:48:13,305
If I'm lucky remembering
your names, I'm gonna try.

570
00:48:14,275 --> 00:48:16,702
Jessy - it's good thing you're
here, 'cus I never forget.

571
00:48:18,654 --> 00:48:19,957
James. - Mr. President.

572
00:48:20,687 --> 00:48:22,088
Carter. - Mr. President.

573
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:24,975
This is Cecil. - Pleasure to
meet you, Mr. President.

574
00:48:25,256 --> 00:48:26,849
Miss Kennedy...

575
00:48:27,373 --> 00:48:28,903
How are you?

576
00:48:31,027 --> 00:48:35,082
She's all right. Pleasure to
meet you Miss Caroline.

577
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,584
Stop, okay? Stop.
- What's that?

578
00:48:42,215 --> 00:48:45,644
I can smell gin in your breath.
- That says Addison's Disease.

579
00:48:45,695 --> 00:48:49,855
Stop. Did you take Charlie
to the dentist today?

580
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,793
Does someone at the White House
got Addison's disease?

581
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,954
No, I did not take Charlie
to the dentist today.

582
00:49:00,995 --> 00:49:04,505
And what you asking
me about it for? You never home.

583
00:49:04,556 --> 00:49:07,639
Now, you gonna act like you gonna
take Charlie to the dentist?

584
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,000
You ain't never here, I don't know
how you gonna take him.

585
00:49:10,087 --> 00:49:12,468
His teeth fall out
waiting on you to take him.

586
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:16,428
Just go to bed Gloria.
I'll take him tomorrow.

587
00:49:16,529 --> 00:49:19,471
Hoe many pairs of shoes
does she have?

588
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:26,443
I said, how many pairs of shoes
does Miss Jackie Kennedy have?

589
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:28,254
How the hell do I know?!

590
00:49:32,325 --> 00:49:35,009
You in that White House
all day and night...

591
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:37,085
I thought you knew
everything.

592
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:43,579
Coming in and telling
me what to do...

593
00:49:44,021 --> 00:49:48,203
Worry about me drinking. You ought
to be worried about your house!

594
00:49:48,223 --> 00:49:50,467
Our boy's in jail, Cecil!

595
00:49:51,202 --> 00:49:54,634
Our boy's in jail,
and you can't come home!

596
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:59,214
You don't see I'm
here trying to talk to you?!

597
00:50:01,353 --> 00:50:05,408
I bet you wish I spoke
French just like Jackie?

598
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:11,117
Jackie Kennedy...
Que sera, sera...

599
00:50:13,002 --> 00:50:16,982
You like that?
You like the way she talk?

600
00:50:18,657 --> 00:50:21,563
Cecil, you hear me talking to you?

601
00:50:22,014 --> 00:50:24,326
You ain't asleep.

602
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,780
Bobby told the President

603
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:45,035
that they shouldn't be worried
about the Negro sit-ins.

604
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,746
Polls showed the US
does not support civil rights.

605
00:50:48,847 --> 00:50:51,206
Told you that white boy was
smooth...

606
00:50:51,247 --> 00:50:53,655
A little too smooth for
my money.

607
00:50:59,021 --> 00:51:01,652
Cecil, how's your boy doing?
- Out of jail.

608
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,973
He says he's back in
school. But I think,

609
00:51:03,074 --> 00:51:05,458
he's doing that
freedom riding thing.

610
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:07,601
How's Gloria doing with
that drinking?

611
00:51:08,907 --> 00:51:10,513
She's hangin'.

612
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,762
You see that Kat that's
playing? He's a big deal.

613
00:51:16,793 --> 00:51:20,745
Pablo Casals. World famous.
- Course, he's world famous!

614
00:51:20,846 --> 00:51:23,214
You think Ms. Kennedy's
gonna have some

615
00:51:23,265 --> 00:51:25,597
back woods country fiddle band
playing out there for her? - Man...

616
00:51:25,998 --> 00:51:28,534
Why don't you start a band.
Maybe you could go out there too?

617
00:51:28,535 --> 00:51:30,668
You know, in fact,
let's all start a band!

618
00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:34,879
I'll play the bongos... What about
you? - I'll play a mean skin flute.

619
00:51:36,297 --> 00:51:39,818
Casals is a righteous soul.
He refuses to play

620
00:51:39,899 --> 00:51:42,461
in any country that
recognizes Franco's regime.

621
00:51:43,009 --> 00:51:44,407
Who's Franco?

622
00:51:46,934 --> 00:51:51,682
Forget it, man. - Huh?
- Forget it. You're ignorant.

623
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:05,545
Carol, you tired?

624
00:52:05,795 --> 00:52:08,103
You want me to put my
head on your shoulder?

625
00:52:08,174 --> 00:52:10,924
What's wrong with that? - I'm not
putting my head on your shoulder.

626
00:52:10,935 --> 00:52:11,816
You can...

627
00:52:15,225 --> 00:52:17,781
You ever been on a Freedom Bus
before? - No, it's my first time.

628
00:52:17,794 --> 00:52:20,057
No? How's your boyfriend
feel about that? - My boyfriend?!

629
00:52:20,258 --> 00:52:25,742
Yeah. He must be upset at you,
being on this bus? Down here.

630
00:52:25,793 --> 00:52:27,856
I don't have a boyfriend.
- You don't have a boyfriend?

631
00:52:28,925 --> 00:52:30,734
How do you not have a boyfriend?

632
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,843
Do you want some?
- No, thanks.

633
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:42,000
It's too hot to eat.

634
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,277
It's a long bus drive.

635
00:52:50,009 --> 00:52:52,155
Louis, what is that?

636
00:52:59,149 --> 00:53:02,463
It's a Cross! It's a Cross!
- Driver, turn! Turn the bus!

637
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,582
Shit! Shit!

638
00:53:14,893 --> 00:53:16,390
Get out! Get out!

639
00:53:16,614 --> 00:53:19,200
<i>Alabama hates niggers!

640
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:13,051
Oh, my God!
- Everybody out!

641
00:54:22,403 --> 00:54:26,445
In an old house in Paris
that was covered in vines,

642
00:54:28,409 --> 00:54:33,296
lived 12 little girls
in two straight lines.

643
00:54:34,307 --> 00:54:39,572
The smallest one was Madeline.
- Like Caroline!

644
00:54:41,106 --> 00:54:43,133
She was not afraid of mice.

645
00:54:43,336 --> 00:54:46,510
Why do people ride
in the Freedom Bus?

646
00:54:50,357 --> 00:54:55,044
Uncle Bobby told my daddy,
that the Freedom Bus exploded.

647
00:54:55,095 --> 00:54:56,095
Today.

648
00:55:08,454 --> 00:55:11,554
I didn't know if
my boy was dead or alive.

649
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:31,356
Hello? - <i>Hi, dad.</i>

650
00:55:31,801 --> 00:55:33,832
I'm in Mississippi.

651
00:55:34,902 --> 00:55:38,499
<i>I thought you was in Alabama.
- We spent two weeks in jail there

652
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:42,139
<i>now we're in Mississippi.</i>
- I want you to listen to me, Louis.

653
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,585
I want you to come home.

654
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:47,072
<i>I know we ain't seen eye to eye,

655
00:55:47,906 --> 00:55:49,864
<i>but your mamma,
she wants you home.

656
00:55:53,409 --> 00:55:55,055
They keeping me.

657
00:55:55,173 --> 00:55:57,772
How long? - Where is he?
- <i>I don't know...</i>

658
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,509
<i>They said 3 months. When I get
out, I'm gonna take another ride.

659
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,724
What are you talking about?!
- What is he saying?

660
00:56:05,434 --> 00:56:07,449
Let me talk to him.
Give me that phone!

661
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:10,284
<i>It is my right to ride that bus.
That is my legal right,

662
00:56:10,991 --> 00:56:13,870
and I will exercise my rights
as an American citizen.

663
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:17,007
<i>American citizen?
What you talking about?

664
00:56:17,108 --> 00:56:20,571
You know what they gonna do
to you? They gonna lynch ya.

665
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:24,286
Then they gonna throw
your little ass in the river.

666
00:56:25,309 --> 00:56:26,992
They gon' kill you.

667
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:30,225
Ma, then they just
gonna have to kill me.

668
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,937
I don't know what country I'm
looking at.

669
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:44,413
Louis man...That little nigga
might be on to somethin'.

670
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,854
Stop calling him a nigga,
cause he ain't no nigga.

671
00:57:51,686 --> 00:57:53,594
What's wrong, baby?

672
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:57,328
What's wrong with me is...this.
- What are you talking about?

673
00:57:57,399 --> 00:58:00,737
This is what's wrong with me.
You know what? This is wrong.

674
00:58:00,738 --> 00:58:02,594
You used to like wrong. - This is
wrong. - We ain't been wrong yet.

675
00:58:03,278 --> 00:58:06,500
I can't do this to Cecil.
- We ain't doing this to Cecil.

676
00:58:06,534 --> 00:58:08,347
I'm doing it to you.

677
00:58:08,608 --> 00:58:10,561
I want you out of my house.

678
00:58:11,794 --> 00:58:14,538
Why do you think God brought us
next to each other each day?

679
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:17,609
God ain't got nothing to do with this.
- He put you right next door to me.

680
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,631
You always talk about how lonely you are
with Cecil being at the White House,

681
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:24,035
and you need a man that
can appreciate the love

682
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:26,438
and the woman you are like I do.

683
00:58:26,439 --> 00:58:29,130
I want your number running ass
up out of my house,

684
00:58:29,191 --> 00:58:31,458
off my sofa right now.

685
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,048
I'm through! I told you!

686
00:58:35,307 --> 00:58:37,010
Let me make a
demonstration for you.

687
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:39,143
Don't come up with
this bullshit crazy stuff.

688
00:58:40,795 --> 00:58:43,375
This is you, right?
You got your direction.

689
00:58:45,276 --> 00:58:47,890
This is you.
And this is me.

690
00:58:47,911 --> 00:58:51,296
We seem like we don't fit at all.
We just crash into each other.

691
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:54,967
But, when you align things properly,

692
00:58:55,402 --> 00:58:57,999
like God putting you next door to me,

693
00:58:58,303 --> 00:59:00,681
everything kinda works out.

694
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:04,371
And even if you
slow down, I got you.

695
00:59:05,698 --> 00:59:08,312
You need to get your yellow
ass up out of my house.

696
00:59:08,393 --> 00:59:10,913
We need each other. - What
I need is my husband.

697
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,845
And not to be laying up
here in the gutter with you.

698
00:59:25,804 --> 00:59:29,221
On an average, how many pills do
you think I take a day, Cecil?

699
00:59:29,952 --> 00:59:33,330
About 103, sir.

700
00:59:36,891 --> 00:59:39,447
Help me up. - Mr President...

701
00:59:46,811 --> 00:59:48,981
I know your son
is a Freedom Rider.

702
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:56,140
He's in prison right now in
Birmingham with Martin Luther King.

703
01:00:02,696 --> 01:00:06,839
Do you...Do you know
how he is, sir?

704
01:00:07,759 --> 01:00:11,385
I'm guessing he's beat up.
But based on his record,

705
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:15,426
he must be used to it.

706
01:00:17,374 --> 01:00:21,180
Cecil, he's been arrested 16 times
over the past two years.

707
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:24,133
Yes, sir.

708
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:32,844
Anything else?
- No, that's it.

709
01:00:35,736 --> 01:00:37,787
You know, I never understood

710
01:00:38,431 --> 01:00:42,874
what you all really went
through, until I saw that.

711
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:52,670
My brother says these kids
have changed his heart.

712
01:00:59,152 --> 01:01:01,380
They've changed mine too.

713

01:02:20,723 --> 01:02:23,366
Hey...Hey Cecil.

730
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:26,387
Cecil, what's wrong?

731
01:02:28,434 --> 01:02:29,971
Cecil.

732
01:02:32,931 --> 01:02:35,102
Cecil?

733
01:02:36,193 --> 01:02:38,062
They blew his...

...head off.

735
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,919
Who are you talking about?
- Kennedy.

736
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:57,016
<i>President Kennedy was
shot as he brought

737

<i>There is report that
three of bullets ran out.

740
01:03:24,826 --> 01:03:28,683
Mrs. Kennedy refused
to change her clothes

741
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:33,485
so that everybody could see
what they did to her husband.

742
01:03:41,206 --> 01:03:44,581
The last time I saw
that much blood

743
01:03:44,782 --> 01:03:47,301
was the day my daddy was killed.

744
01:03:56,787 --> 01:03:59,080
Please, tell me how
I could help you.

745
01:04:36,288 --> 01:04:39,166
Mom? What are you doin'?

746
01:04:39,967 --> 01:04:43,509
Here. I want you to take this box
and put it down in the basement.

747
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:45,935
Make sure you label it "trophies".
- This is Louis' stuff.

748
01:04:45,996 --> 01:04:49,377
You know he's gonna be pissed. - I don't
care about Louis being pissed.

749
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,953
I'm the one who's pissed.
He ain't been here in three years.

750
01:04:51,994 --> 01:04:54,819
Why you pissed mom? - And don't
put that next to my jarred okra.

751
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:56,845
Ain't no body trying to
smell that stankin' okra!

752
01:04:56,896 --> 01:04:59,032
And when you come back, I want
you to get me some fish food.

753
01:05:18,105 --> 01:05:22,283
Look what the President...
Mrs. Kennedy gave me.

754
01:05:23,112 --> 01:05:25,590
It belonged to the President.

755
01:05:27,542 --> 01:05:32,012
Gloria, the President was killed.

756
01:05:33,546 --> 01:05:37,777
I'm really sorry about the
President. I really am.

757
01:05:39,044 --> 01:05:42,000
But you and that White House
can kiss my ass.

758
01:05:42,011 --> 01:05:43,607
I don't care what's
going on in that house.

759
01:05:43,677 --> 01:05:46,262
I care what goes on in this house.

760
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:28,514
I knew that Gloria had been
unhappy for some time now.

761
01:06:30,285 --> 01:06:32,991
I knew that's
probably why she drank.

762
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,503
She wanted me to
get along better with Louis.

763
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:42,514
I didn't know how, if I couldn't.

764
01:06:43,802 --> 01:06:47,544
If I could, I'd cut back long
hours at the White House.

765
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:50,471
And I did just that.

766
01:06:50,872 --> 01:06:55,963
How many pairs of shoes she's
got? - She got about...125.

767
01:06:56,142 --> 01:07:00,658
125 pairs of shoes. - Yeah. I put
them in a line from the blacks,

768
01:07:00,699 --> 01:07:03,020
all the way to the whites.

769
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:04,923
And I'll tell you what

770
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:07,035
The next time there is a light
on in an empty room,

771
01:07:07,096 --> 01:07:09,092
I will fire every sorry
son of a bitch in this house!

772
01:07:09,193 --> 01:07:10,827
<i>1964. The Johnson Administration</i>
I mean it, Cecil!

773
01:07:11,135 --> 01:07:13,400
I'll go back to Texas and run the country
from a dirt shack if I have to!

774
01:07:13,491 --> 01:07:15,365
Is that what you want?!
Who do you think pays

775
01:07:15,466 --> 01:07:17,192
the God-damned bills
around here. I don't,

776
01:07:17,213 --> 01:07:19,070
but you know what I mean.
- Yes, sir.

777
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:25,986
Yeah, I almost forgot. Ladybird
and I want you to have this.

778
01:07:27,161 --> 01:07:30,167
It matches your eyes.
- Thank you, sir.

779
01:07:39,496 --> 01:07:41,889
I see you baby! - You know
how daddy likes it! - Put it on!

780
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:59,363
Negro! Get out here! Back there
stinkin up my bathroom!

781
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,521
Oh Lord, what you doing?

782
01:08:14,113 --> 01:08:16,143
Give me my wig!
What's wrong with you?!

783
01:08:16,244 --> 01:08:19,376
This my good wig!
- Oh shit. Oh, shit!

784
01:08:25,403 --> 01:08:28,132
James told me that
Dr. King told the President

785
01:08:28,233 --> 01:08:31,308
we would be going to the streets
down south for our right to vote.

786
01:08:31,409 --> 01:08:33,904
Didn't you baby? - What?
- Didn't you tell me

787
01:08:33,995 --> 01:08:36,215
that Dr. King told the President
that we was going down south

788
01:08:36,256 --> 01:08:38,751
for our right to vote?
I ain't make that up.

789
01:08:38,855 --> 01:08:41,258
Is that what you heard?
- That Dr. King ain't no joke

790
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,604
with his little militant ass.
- Who she talking to?

791
01:08:43,645 --> 01:08:45,133
Well, it look like
someone is talking...

792
01:08:45,423 --> 01:08:47,582
Shut up!
- Leave my bird alone.

793
01:08:47,683 --> 01:08:50,056
You know three kids
got killed down there.

794
01:08:50,257 --> 01:08:52,187
Trying to get colored folks
registered to vote.

795
01:08:52,218 --> 01:08:53,800
That's why I didn't want
Louis to go down there.

796
01:08:53,891 --> 01:08:56,463
That's what I was trying to tell you. - Well
you shouldn't have sent him down there.

797
01:08:56,484 --> 01:08:58,732
I know. - Well he is
down there now,

798
01:08:58,763 --> 01:09:00,267
and there ain't nothing
we can do about it.

799
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:02,314
The only reason why
the President sent the FBI,

800
01:09:02,345 --> 01:09:05,396
is cause two of them were white.
- Now, who told her that?

801
01:09:05,417 --> 01:09:06,677
Where did you hear that?
I didn't tell you that!

802
01:09:06,698 --> 01:09:09,310
It was in one of them colored
newspapers from Baltimore!

803
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:10,835
That alright with you?

804
01:09:11,202 --> 01:09:13,268
See, she getting smart now. Damn!

805
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:15,300
Honey, you think the President
ought to do something about

806
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:19,019
the voting rights bill?
- President Johnson just passed

807
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:22,571
the greatest piece of civil rights
legislation since Lincoln freed the slaves.

808
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,878
it's going to be very difficult to
pass another bill anytime soon.

809
01:09:26,088 --> 01:09:28,361
That's it. - You see,
how my wife quizzes me?!

810
01:09:28,812 --> 01:09:32,301
I get it every day. - Only you
gotta know how much to say,

811
01:09:32,392 --> 01:09:34,690
and when you cross the line. - You deal
with your woman, I'll deal with mine.

812
01:09:34,711 --> 01:09:37,552
At least you tell your wife what's
going on over there. - Aces!

813
01:09:37,652 --> 01:09:40,986
Damn! - You can't be king
in your one castle.

814
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,982
Hey, Glo. Did you all hear
about your neighbor Howard?

815
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:53,090
Guy down on 8th st. caught
him in bed with his wife.

816
01:09:53,888 --> 01:09:56,408
Shot him dead.
Shot him in the back.

817
01:09:56,629 --> 01:09:58,990
That's it.
That's all of it.

818
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,900
I don't know. Maybe he
got what he deserved.

819
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:08,422
You sorry sap asses gotta realize that
the nigger ain't gonna take it no more.

820
01:10:08,623 --> 01:10:11,897
This entire country is a tinderbox.
A goddamn tinderbox

821
01:10:11,998 --> 01:10:14,010
of nigger rage just
waitin' to explode!

822
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:17,981
I want all of you to get on the
phone, call the NAACP, Core

823
01:10:18,622 --> 01:10:20,382
and who ever else will listen
to your sorry asses

824
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,457
and help me keep them
niggers off the street!

825
01:10:22,867 --> 01:10:26,082
Buck, I smell your ass from here!
What the hell are you waiting for?!

826
01:10:27,096 --> 01:10:28,984
Jesus Christ!

827
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:31,588
Cecil, get me some of that
god-damned prune juice.

828
01:10:38,281 --> 01:10:40,589
I'm not sure what to
make of Malcolm X.

829
01:10:41,013 --> 01:10:44,205
I know what to make of. He's got a
better plan in place than Dr. King.

830
01:10:44,993 --> 01:10:48,041
If someone puts their hands on you,
put them in the cemetery.

831
01:10:48,042 --> 01:10:49,704
<i>1965. Malcolm X Speaking Tour</i>
That's a better plan?

832
01:10:50,758 --> 01:10:54,434
We gonna go. - Alright, good night.
- Good night.

833
01:11:00,334 --> 01:11:02,726
You just mad because he
talking about your daddy.

834
01:11:04,103 --> 01:11:07,929
What? - He was saying all that
stuff about house negroes.

835
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:11,854
I saw you get mad. - My dad
is not a house negro.

836
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,021
He's a butler, ain't he?
- Don't talk about my dad.

837
01:11:19,122 --> 01:11:20,829
I don't talk about
your dad, alright?

838
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,820
That's because my daddy's
proud of what I'm doin'.

839
01:11:37,638 --> 01:11:39,874
You alright?

840
01:12:22,101 --> 01:12:26,471
Everybody went to church to raise
money for the kids down in Selma.

841
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:31,833
But I didn't go. I wasn't going to give
money to pay for my son to be killed.

842
01:12:39,566 --> 01:12:42,744
Once again, them kids got beat.

843
01:12:43,373 --> 01:12:47,948
This one was so bad that the press
called it "Bloody Sunday".

844
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,437
How are your boys, Cecil?

845
01:13:17,698 --> 01:13:21,773
I don't know how my
oldest is, Mr. President.

846
01:13:22,174 --> 01:13:24,611
I believe he might be in Selma.

847
01:13:25,305 --> 01:13:28,913
Sometimes I feel like we're
living in two different worlds.

848
01:13:31,798 --> 01:13:33,647
I just want to keep them safe.

849
01:13:41,002 --> 01:13:46,089
<i>Every American citizen must
have an equal right to vote.

850
01:13:47,645 --> 01:13:51,887
<i>Yet, the harsh fact is that in
many places in this country

851
01:13:52,874 --> 01:13:58,714
<i>men and women are kept from voting,
simply because they are Negroes.

852
01:13:59,095 --> 01:14:02,766
Negroes? Since when they
start calling us negroes?

853
01:14:04,099 --> 01:14:07,026
That nigger uses the word
nigger more than I use it.

854
01:14:07,244 --> 01:14:11,708
<i>Really, it's all of us,
who must overcome

855
01:14:11,799 --> 01:14:17,742
<i>the crippling legacy of

856
01:14:18,828 --> 01:14:21,418
<i>And we shall overcome.

<i>Hey, hey LBJ, how many

858
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:42,331
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN FOR UNCLE SAM!
I AIN'T GOING TO VIETNAM

859
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:54,098
At least, they shut up.

860
01:14:54,299 --> 01:14:57,695
<i>First rifle shots ricochet around
the thick wall of the building,

861
01:14:57,796 --> 01:15:00,602
<i>taking the first casualties on the squad.

01:15:01,118 --> 01:15:06,420
<i>The snipers, maybe only

<i>1968. Memphis, Tennessee<i>
There's also a machine gun down the street...

864
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:18,745
President Johnson is making a
tragic error in Vietnam.

865
01:15:19,263 --> 01:15:23,375
Move on, Big Yellow. - Why
shouldn't we fight in Vietnam?

866
01:15:23,455 --> 01:15:26,016
The Vietcong don't
call us niggers, for one.

867
01:15:29,617 --> 01:15:33,074
Seriously, how many of your
parents support the war?

868
01:15:35,282 --> 01:15:38,826
Well my Lord...Why do
your parents support it?

869
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:43,082
We haven't spoken about it
specifically, I just know they do.

870
01:15:43,694 --> 01:15:45,563
What do your daddy do?

871
01:15:47,444 --> 01:15:48,742
He's a butler.

872
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,603
The black domestic plays an
important role in our history.

873
01:15:52,704 --> 01:15:55,120
I didn't tell you
that to make fun of me.

874
01:15:56,059 --> 01:15:59,404
Young brother, the black
domestic defies racial stereotypes

875
01:15:59,415 --> 01:16:02,749
by being hardworking and trustworthy.

876
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:12,263
He slowly tears down racial
hatred is the example

877
01:16:12,364 --> 01:16:16,754
of his strong work ethic
and dignified character.

878
01:16:19,306 --> 01:16:23,242
Now while we perceive the butler or
the maid as being subservient

879
01:16:23,862 --> 01:16:28,138
in many ways they are subversive,
without even knowing it.

880
01:16:31,034 --> 01:16:32,643
Come in, Cecil.

881
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:35,481
Good afternoon, Mr. Warner.

882
01:16:39,893 --> 01:16:41,606
Thank you for seeing me.

883
01:16:56,199 --> 01:16:57,882
Since the colored...

884
01:16:58,902 --> 01:17:03,469
The black staff does just as
much work as the white staff,

885
01:17:04,644 --> 01:17:09,064
I believe that our salaries
should reflect our service, sir.

886
01:17:10,684 --> 01:17:12,242
"Black" staff?

887
01:17:13,667 --> 01:17:17,313
I also feel that we should have...

888
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:22,178
...opportunities of advancement.

889
01:17:24,048 --> 01:17:28,169
I know black housemen
has ever been promoted,

890
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:30,769
to be engaged in this office.

891
01:17:32,113 --> 01:17:34,688
You're very well liked here, Cecil.

892
01:17:35,348 --> 01:17:37,518
But if you're unhappy
with your salary or position

893
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:40,027
than I suggest you seek
employment elsewhere.

894
01:17:40,328 --> 01:17:42,062
With all due respect, sir... - Don't let
that Martin Luther King shit

895
01:17:42,113 --> 01:17:46,352
fill your britches out. Just
remember where I found you.

896
01:17:54,048 --> 01:17:56,159
Yes sir.

897
01:18:03,109 --> 01:18:04,541
Excuse me.

898
01:18:13,242 --> 01:18:17,860
<i>Dr Martin Luther King, the apostle on
nonviolence and Civil Rights Movement,

899
01:18:18,078 --> 01:18:20,869
<i>has been shot to death
in Memphis, Tennessee.

900
01:18:59,135 --> 01:19:01,844
I didn't know if I was
gonna get home alive.

901
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:08,931
It was the first time I felt like I
didn't belong in my own neighborhood.

902
01:19:10,699 --> 01:19:15,100
The whole world was changing
and I didn't know where I fit in.

903
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:26,441
Ma? My room's pink.

904
01:20:31,607 --> 01:20:35,110
Make sure you get some
of my sweet potatoes, Carol.

905
01:20:35,973 --> 01:20:39,877
I use orange juice when I make ‘em.
That what make ‘em so tart.

906
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:45,693
How long ya'all been dating?
- 5 Years. - We're just friends.

907
01:20:50,168 --> 01:20:55,180
Is all the rest of the students
getting involved in politics too?

908
01:20:59,778 --> 01:21:02,907
There's been a division,
kind of a split Ma.

909
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:07,706
A few of them like John Lewis
are... - I love John Lewis.

910
01:21:08,104 --> 01:21:11,367
How do you know who John Lewis is?
- Because I read JET Magazine.

911
01:21:11,398 --> 01:21:14,599
I'm not just sitting up there,
sewing for you all day.

912
01:21:16,688 --> 01:21:19,184
I'm getting sick and tired of
gettin' thrown in jail.

913
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:22,248
Yeah? Well that makes
two of us, don't it?

914
01:21:24,146 --> 01:21:27,147
Dr. King's philosophy
ultimately got him murdered.

915
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:31,236
It worked when we started, but
now it's time to take the next step,

916
01:21:31,297 --> 01:21:34,627
which is politics. - What, so y'all
going to the White House now?

917
01:21:35,117 --> 01:21:36,715
Dad, Louis going to the
White House.

918
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:39,248
You know they ain't gonna let
you in with them nipples out.

919
01:21:39,762 --> 01:21:42,214
Maybe one, but not both of
them out. - Shut up.

920
01:21:42,782 --> 01:21:46,646
Nah, we're more grass roots,
one on one with the community.

921
01:21:47,498 --> 01:21:50,231
Although we have started
our own political party.

922
01:21:50,607 --> 01:21:53,853
What's your party?
You like to party?

923
01:21:54,189 --> 01:21:57,627
I like to party. What's your
party called?

924
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:03,292
The Black Panther Party.
- What kind of name is that?

925
01:22:05,393 --> 01:22:09,002
What that stand for? - We provide
free breakfast for children,

926
01:22:09,043 --> 01:22:12,849
free medical clinics, free clothing
and self defense classes.

927
01:22:13,398 --> 01:22:16,976
And why y'all need self defense?
- We ain't gettin' beat no more.

928
01:22:22,986 --> 01:22:25,305
Me and your daddy saw a
wonderful movie the other night

929
01:22:25,356 --> 01:22:27,335
reminded me so much of you.

930
01:22:27,436 --> 01:22:31,239
Oh yeah? - What was the name
of that movie, honey?

931
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:33,366
"In the Heat of the Night".

932
01:22:34,309 --> 01:22:39,935
"In the Heat of the Night"
with Sidney Poitier.

933
01:22:39,996 --> 01:22:42,994
Lord, Sydney Poitier.
I love Sydney Poitier...

934
01:22:43,195 --> 01:22:46,184
Sidney Poitier is the white man's
fantasy of what he wants us to be.

935
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,650
But his movies have him
fighting for equal rights.

936
01:22:49,651 --> 01:22:52,148
Only in a way that is acceptable
to the white status quo.

937
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:56,107
And the brother can't act.

938
01:22:56,708 --> 01:22:59,924
What are you talking about? He just
won the Academy Award...

939
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:03,533
He's breaking down barriers
for all of us. - By being white.

940
01:23:03,634 --> 01:23:08,632
By acting white. Sidney Poitier is
nothing but a rich Uncle Tom.

941
01:23:11,773 --> 01:23:15,247
Look at you. You all puffed up.

942
01:23:16,134 --> 01:23:19,446
You got your hat on your
head. Coming in here.

943
01:23:19,497 --> 01:23:21,381
Saying whatever you want.

944
01:23:21,483 --> 01:23:25,322
Your girlfriend is belching at the
table. You don't even think

945
01:23:25,423 --> 01:23:28,418
you need to go to school even
though I gave you the money.

946
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:32,526
You need to go.

947
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:37,672
Yeah, Louis, I need you
to get out of my house.

948
01:23:37,802 --> 01:23:39,511
What?

949
01:23:39,712 --> 01:23:44,204
Get a hell out of my house!- Cecil!
Cecil no! No, no, no! Cecil, no!

950
01:23:44,274 --> 01:23:46,811
I can't take this no more! - Please!
We ain't seen this boy!

951
01:23:46,892 --> 01:23:50,108
We ain't seen this boy in years!
Now everybody just sit down!

952
01:23:50,209 --> 01:23:53,612
I'm sorry, Mr Buttler! I didn't
mean to make fun of your hero!

953
01:23:55,342 --> 01:23:58,230
Everything you are
and everything you have,

954
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:00,600
is because of that butler.

955
01:24:01,626 --> 01:24:04,714
Now you take that triflin',
low class bitch

956
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:09,044
and get out of this house!

957
01:24:24,089 --> 01:24:26,000
I like Sydney Poitier, daddy.

958
01:24:48,105 --> 01:24:50,134
Y'all gonna make me late for work.

959
01:24:50,195 --> 01:24:53,332
Uncle Carter, I'm sorry. Who else
am I gonna call to bail him out?

960
01:24:54,103 --> 01:24:56,891
What they got him in
for this time? Sit up!

961
01:24:57,122 --> 01:24:59,991
He said the cop
stopped him "just because".

962
01:25:01,257 --> 01:25:07,003
Just because? - He said he wasn't
gonna get beat no more, so...

963
01:25:07,441 --> 01:25:09,644
He got out the car and
hit him back.

964
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,194
What about that little gal of his?

965
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,406
They put her in the hospital.

966
01:25:15,783 --> 01:25:21,291
In the hospital? Charlie this
shit's gotta stop, man.

967
01:25:24,102 --> 01:25:28,083
I'm late for work. You tell
Louis I'm not his momma.

968
01:25:28,475 --> 01:25:30,294
I want my money back.

969
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:35,622
You alright?

970
01:25:36,196 --> 01:25:39,962
Yeah, I'm alright.
Thanks, Uncle Carter.

971
01:25:41,218 --> 01:25:43,965
You can take all this Black Panther
shit somewhere else.

972
01:25:44,394 --> 01:25:47,191
I'm not them, I want my
money back. Hear me?

973
01:25:47,597 --> 01:25:51,313
Yes, sir. - Every dime.

974
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,112
Hey Uncle, don't tell Daddy.

975
01:26:03,105 --> 01:26:06,599
How you avoid anal sex in prison?

976
01:26:06,735 --> 01:26:08,979
Do they teach you that
at The Panthers?

977
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:12,110
They teach you how to sit?

978
01:26:17,282 --> 01:26:20,892
She been drinking again?
- No. She sober.

979
01:26:21,603 --> 01:26:24,528
She ain't doing nothing but sewing
and feeding them damn fishes.

980
01:26:25,176 --> 01:26:27,591
Feed them more than
she feed me.

981
01:26:28,553 --> 01:26:30,973
You excited about
going back to Howard?

982
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,812
I'm excited about not going back.

983
01:26:34,671 --> 01:26:39,155
What? - Yeah.
I'm going to Vietnam.

984
01:26:39,392 --> 01:26:44,648
Charlie, don't do this. Don't do this!
This country treats us like dogs!

985
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:47,630
Do what?! Don't do this?

986
01:26:48,695 --> 01:26:53,988
You fight your country.
I wanna fight <i>for</i> my country.

987
01:26:55,234 --> 01:26:58,229
I'm not going to
your funeral. - Good.

988
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:23,498
I wanna know every god-damn
domestic policy decision right now,

989
01:27:23,548 --> 01:27:26,200
and I want it on the
table right now. - Okay.

990
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,213
Did you get the memos
we sent last week?

991
01:27:28,294 --> 01:27:32,863
John and I strongly agree
that the time calls for...

992
01:27:32,894 --> 01:27:34,905
<i>1969. The Nixon Administration</i>
There's a God damned fly in here.

993
01:27:34,955 --> 01:27:38,738
Jesus Christ... - John and I agree
that the time calls for

994
01:27:38,799 --> 01:27:41,771
a period of benign neglect.
- Benign neglect? - Yes.

995
01:27:42,119 --> 01:27:44,006
I like that. I like that.

996
01:27:44,034 --> 01:27:45,927
<i>Black Panther Headquarters</i>
- The pigs in the media,

997
01:27:45,998 --> 01:27:50,715
describe us as terrorists. A
terrorist is one who terrorizes

998
01:27:50,884 --> 01:27:54,956
and frightens others. We're the
ones getting terrorized!

999
01:27:54,997 --> 01:27:57,228
How can we exist in peace

1000
01:27:57,599 --> 01:28:00,230
when we scared to walk down
the street to the store?!

1001
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:03,079
Now there's this whole black power
movement going on, right?

1002
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,210
What if we...

1003
01:28:10,055 --> 01:28:14,050
What if Nixon promotes black power
to mean black businesses

1004
01:28:14,091 --> 01:28:17,605
and we find ways to support
black entrepreneurs.

1005
01:28:17,656 --> 01:28:20,019
We pass the buck on
desegregation to the courts,

1006
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:24,441
but push black enterprise to win
the 20% that could vote our way...

1007
01:28:24,492 --> 01:28:26,199
Excellent. - Excellent, sir.

1008
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:28,227
You don't know if
your ceiling gon' cave in,

1009
01:28:28,298 --> 01:28:32,042
'cause your slumlord too busy
running around collecting rent checks,

1010
01:28:32,143 --> 01:28:35,584
but he won't fix your roof.
It's time that we take a stand

1011
01:28:35,615 --> 01:28:40,596
against these injustices that plagued
our community! They take one of ours?

1012
01:28:41,415 --> 01:28:44,948
We takin' two of theirs!
- That's right! - Spin time!

1013
01:28:45,149 --> 01:28:47,706
We just need to make sure
that "Nixon's black power"

1014
01:28:47,797 --> 01:28:50,285
doesn't equate Nixon
with the Black Panthers.

1015
01:28:50,286 --> 01:28:52,878
Have you lost your mind? Did you
read Hoover's last memo on that?

1016
01:28:52,899 --> 01:28:55,468
That's my point. - It's God damned
terrifying. No, no, no...

1017
01:28:55,499 --> 01:28:57,811
I gave him the green light to
gut those sons of bitches...

1018
01:28:57,912 --> 01:29:02,112
Absolutely. - Round them all up and
throw them down an elevator shaft.

1019
01:29:03,987 --> 01:29:07,791
I don't proclaim to know
everything. But I promise you,

1020
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:11,431
they'll always beware of
the nigger with a gun.

1021
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:18,671
Will there be anything else,
Mr. President?

1022
01:29:29,866 --> 01:29:32,389
How many kids we got comming to
the breakfast tomorrow morning?

1023
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:36,291
We got about 25 or 30.
- 25 or 30 kids...

1024
01:29:51,281 --> 01:29:53,633
What are we doing here?

1025
01:29:55,454 --> 01:29:58,299
I thought this meant to be
our community service.

1026
01:29:58,684 --> 01:30:02,540
This IS community service.
- Someone kills one of us,

1027
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:05,166
we kill two of theirs?
- Community protection!

1028
01:30:06,008 --> 01:30:08,576
Are you ready to
kill somebody, Carol?

1029
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,124
'Cause I ain't.

Well, you want it right here?

Alright! - Right here?
- Kids up? Kids down?

You know, I don't drink.
I don't drink.

1048

I was just playing with you. I was
just seeing if it worked. Go ahead.

No.

01:32:38,194 --> 01:32:41,841
No? - I haven't heard from Charlie.
I know, I got an idea.

1053
01:32:42,171 --> 01:32:44,829
I think we should go to
Shantay's tonight. - Oh, no!

some alterations.

Where?!

1066
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:34,099

for some money?

Hey, Louis.

01:33:55,874 --> 01:33:58,293
I didn't expect to hear
from you on my birthday.

1074
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:00,220
You should feel ashamed of yourself.

1075
01:34:00,221 --> 01:34:03,761
You're a grown ass man and your calling
your mamma asking for money.

1076

Well guess what,
it's the butler's money.

1077
01:34:06,371 --> 01:34:09,908
It's Uncle Tom's money. And he
ain't giving none out today.

Bye.

1079
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:18,377
I'll get it.

You got the wrong house...

1081
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:38,845
It's the wrong house.

He was the one who cleaned me up.

1128

anybody could ever want.

1130
01:41:46,266 --> 01:41:48,104

1131
01:41:50,199 --> 01:41:53,065

should be engineers by now.

1151
01:43:36,337 --> 01:43:40,106
They should've been promoted
years ago.

1152
01:43:42,315 --> 01:43:44,235
You think so?

1153
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:52,132
I'm gonna have to be paid
the same as the white help,

1154
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:54,931
or I'ma have to move on.

1155
01:43:57,441 --> 01:43:59,939
I guess you'll be moving on then.

1156
01:44:04,193 --> 01:44:07,333
I told the President,
that you'd say that.

1157
01:44:09,387 --> 01:44:14,209
He told me to tell you to
take this up with him, personally.

1158
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:21,034
Excuse me.

1159
01:44:28,231 --> 01:44:32,208
I'm not comfortable with all the foreign
policy hawks surrounding Ronnie.

1160
01:44:33,415 --> 01:44:35,546
We need more moderates on
his staff.

1161
01:44:35,597 --> 01:44:37,115
And I want a summit
with the Russians.

1162
01:44:37,216 --> 01:44:40,552
Ronnie has to meet with them face to
face if we really want to thaw this ice.

1163
01:44:41,730 --> 01:44:44,628
Cecil. - Yes, Mrs. Reagan?
- We will talk.

1164
01:44:46,472 --> 01:44:49,912
Yes ma'am? - You're very
popular around here.

1165
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:54,983
Everyone says you're the man that
got them raises and promotions.

1166
01:44:54,984 --> 01:44:59,079
I had no idea! - I wish I could
take credit for that.

1167
01:45:00,123 --> 01:45:02,639
I'd like to invite you to
the State Dinner next week.

1168
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:07,389
But I'm going to be there, Mrs.
Reagan. - No. Not as a butler, Cecil.

1169
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:10,232
I'm inviting you as a guest.

1170
01:45:10,779 --> 01:45:13,912
But, the President prefers
for me to serve him personally.

1171
01:45:14,797 --> 01:45:17,770
Don't you worry about, Ronnie.
I'll take care of that.

1172
01:45:18,853 --> 01:45:22,211
So, we'll see you next week.
You and your wife.

1173
01:45:22,382 --> 01:45:23,778
My wife?

1174
01:45:27,299 --> 01:45:30,615
It's...It's Gloria, yes?

1175
01:45:31,271 --> 01:45:33,132
Yes, ma'am. - Yes.

1176
01:45:49,257 --> 01:45:51,253
This is the Entrance Hall.

1177
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,725
Beautiful!

1178
01:46:12,548 --> 01:46:15,261
Can I get you a glass
of champagne, Mr. Gaines?

1179
01:46:16,071 --> 01:46:18,512
Shut up! - Alright!

1180
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:26,289
Ladies and Gentleman, the President
and First Lady of the United States.

1181
01:46:47,955 --> 01:46:51,247
It was different sitting at the
table instead of serving it.

1182
01:46:51,619 --> 01:46:53,355
Real different.

1183
01:46:55,008 --> 01:46:59,522
I could see the two faces
the butlers wore to survive.

1184
01:47:00,837 --> 01:47:04,896
And I knew I lived my life
with those same two faces.

1185
01:47:11,515 --> 01:47:16,365
Gloria looked so happy,
but I didn't feel the same way.

1186
01:47:16,859 --> 01:47:20,871
I guess I wished we were
there for real, instead of show.

1187
01:47:31,203 --> 01:47:33,890
I think that's <i>bon appetite</i>,
everybody.

1188
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:35,943
You a black motherfu...!

1189
01:47:41,483 --> 01:47:45,272
I want to make myself
clear on this issue.

1190
01:47:47,312 --> 01:47:51,653
If Congress passes sanctions
against South Africa,

1191
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:58,050
I will be forced to veto
those sanctions.

1192
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:01,953
Well, Mr. President, we feel
that would be a major mistake.

1193
01:48:02,454 --> 01:48:06,098
The brutal repression of
South African black citizens

1194
01:48:06,119 --> 01:48:09,320
makes no longer
a foreign policy issue,

1195
01:48:09,451 --> 01:48:13,086
but a United States racial issue.

1196
01:48:13,127 --> 01:48:17,367
We're Senators from your own party.
That's why we feel so comfortables

1197
01:48:17,428 --> 01:48:21,204
in letting you know that South
Africa is a human rights disaster.

1198
01:48:21,305 --> 01:48:26,834
Black people are being beaten, tortured,
gunned down in the middle of the street.

1199
01:48:27,059 --> 01:48:31,070
Americans see this on TV.
They're horrified by Apartheid.

1200
01:48:31,111 --> 01:48:34,136
I've made my decision.

1201
01:48:34,337 --> 01:48:38,931
Mr. President, your reputation
as a world leader is at stake.

1202
01:48:39,517 --> 01:48:43,639
The USA needs to be on the right
side of history on the race issue.

1203
01:48:43,994 --> 01:48:46,000
I'll say it again.

1204
01:48:46,458 --> 01:48:49,610
If Congress passes this bill,

1205
01:48:50,769 --> 01:48:52,656
I will veto it.

1206
01:48:53,739 --> 01:48:55,456
Period.

1207
01:49:05,072 --> 01:49:06,796
What, you reading now?

1208
01:49:08,832 --> 01:49:11,557
Get up and do the dishes ‘fore
I shoot you in the head.

1209
01:49:25,036 --> 01:49:28,183
Nothing seemed right to me
after that State Dinner.

1210
01:49:29,001 --> 01:49:30,635
I got all confused.

1211
01:49:58,025 --> 01:50:00,755
They started writing books

1212
01:50:00,924 --> 01:50:05,021
about everything Louis
and his friends had done.

1213
01:50:11,072 --> 01:50:13,679
Louis was never a criminal.

1214
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:19,357
He was a hero!

1215
01:50:19,858 --> 01:50:23,093
Fighting to save the soul
of our country.

1216
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:36,935
Would you like a cookie?

1217
01:50:40,350 --> 01:50:43,336
Cookie? - Thank you.
- Thank you.

1218
01:50:45,013 --> 01:50:46,253
Cookie?

1219
01:51:01,242 --> 01:51:03,832
I had always loved serving.

1220
01:51:04,468 --> 01:51:06,884
But it just felt different now.

1221
01:51:09,839 --> 01:51:14,108
I didn't know that an old man
could feel so lost.

1222
01:51:15,321 --> 01:51:17,683
But that's how I felt...

1223
01:51:18,491 --> 01:51:20,524
That's how I felt.

1224
01:51:27,255 --> 01:51:30,390
Americans always turned a blind eye

1225
01:51:30,702 --> 01:51:33,525
to what we had done to our own.

1226
01:51:34,009 --> 01:51:37,620
We look out to the world and judge.

1227
01:51:38,422 --> 01:51:41,532
We hear about the
concentration camps.

1228
01:51:42,137 --> 01:51:46,602
But these camps went on
for 200 years...

1229
01:51:46,902 --> 01:51:48,850
Right here, in America.

1230
01:52:01,813 --> 01:52:04,536
I buried my daddy right over there.

1231
01:52:07,906 --> 01:52:11,442
My mamma would have
been right proud of me,

1232
01:52:12,207 --> 01:52:14,400
being with a man like yous.

1233
01:52:14,909 --> 01:52:18,448
Taking such good care of me
all of these years.

1234
01:52:21,288 --> 01:52:24,124
I love you, Cecil Gaines.

1235
01:52:25,728 --> 01:52:28,537
I love you more, Gloria.

1236
01:52:41,007 --> 01:52:43,588
Are you sure about this?

1237
01:52:44,313 --> 01:52:46,169
Yes, sir.

1238
01:52:46,802 --> 01:52:49,950
I just want to be the one who
tell you first, that's all.

1239
01:52:51,391 --> 01:52:56,226
You're the best butler here.
You are like family, Cecil.

1240
01:52:58,622 --> 01:53:00,598
It's been an honor serving you.

1241
01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:05,421
Not just for me, I'm sure I speak
for all the Presidents

1242
01:53:05,492 --> 01:53:09,859
when I say that you've served
your country well.

1243
01:53:12,174 --> 01:53:13,916
Thank you, Mr. President.

1244
01:53:18,698 --> 01:53:20,052
Cecil?

1245
01:53:22,203 --> 01:53:25,039
This whole civil rights issue...

1246
01:53:28,928 --> 01:53:31,648
I sometimes fear I'm...

1247
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:36,758
...on the wrong side of it.
That I'm...just wrong.

1248
01:53:39,104 --> 01:53:42,782
Sometimes I think I'm just
scared of what it really means.

1249
01:53:43,647 --> 01:53:46,833
But I'm trying to not be
so scared anymore.

1250
01:53:48,086 --> 01:53:50,682
Who do we want to free?
- Mandela!

1251
01:53:50,723 --> 01:53:52,871
When do we want him free?
- Now!

1252
01:53:52,972 --> 01:53:57,470
Twenty years ago, we marched in
this country for our rights.

1253
01:53:59,433 --> 01:54:03,835
Today, we march to free
the people of South Africa.

1254
01:54:05,362 --> 01:54:09,954
Ronald Reagan has attacked or dismantled
every civil rights program

1255
01:54:10,908 --> 01:54:12,710
that has ever been put in to place!

1256
01:54:13,627 --> 01:54:17,423
Aiding the oppression of black South
Africans is absolutely consistent

1257
01:54:17,494 --> 01:54:21,177
with his policies on
race issues. Am I right?

1258
01:54:21,228 --> 01:54:23,593
Am I right?

1259
01:54:29,635 --> 01:54:31,488
Excuse me...Steven!
Where is Steven?

1260
01:54:32,106 --> 01:54:34,040
Free Mandela y'all!

1261
01:54:53,083 --> 01:54:55,028
Hi, dad.

1262
01:54:56,338 --> 01:54:58,301
Hi, Louis.

1263
01:54:59,895 --> 01:55:02,011
What are you doing here?

1264
01:55:08,349 --> 01:55:10,645
I'm here to protest with you.

1265
01:55:13,807 --> 01:55:16,496
You'll get arrested dad. You'll
lose your job.

1266
01:55:18,975 --> 01:55:21,327
I've lost you.

1267
01:55:25,195 --> 01:55:27,163
I'm sorry...

1268
01:55:37,164 --> 01:55:39,497
I'm sorry, son...

1269
01:55:59,086 --> 01:56:02,488
Don't worry dad, we'll be
out of here in a few hours.

1270
01:56:03,173 --> 01:56:05,364
Who said I was worried?

1271
01:56:10,127 --> 01:56:13,994
After going to jail, I thought
I had seen it all.

1272
01:56:18,823 --> 01:56:20,450
But I'd never imagined

1273
01:56:20,491 --> 01:56:26,164
I'd see a black man be
a real contender

1274
01:56:26,265 --> 01:56:29,727
for the President of the US.

1275
01:56:52,369 --> 01:56:56,629
Gloria and I would walk to our
polling place every night

1276
01:56:56,690 --> 01:57:01,246
to see where we would be
voting for Barack Obama.

1277
01:57:02,590 --> 01:57:06,738
We would just stare at it
and smile.

1278
01:57:12,786 --> 01:57:15,490
You done?
- Pretty much.

1279
01:57:15,551 --> 01:57:17,736
Good. You done good.

1280
01:57:19,692 --> 01:57:23,284
You done pretty good
there. Thanks, honey.

1281
01:57:25,485 --> 01:57:28,594
How come Louis' wife
name that child...

1282
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:32,707
Shaquanda? - Now don't
start that again.

1283
01:57:32,768 --> 01:57:36,720
I ain't starting it, I just don't
know what kind of name that is.

1284
01:57:36,921 --> 01:57:40,173
I mean, really, Shaquanda?!

1285
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:43,443
I think she done that
just to spite me.

1286
01:57:43,544 --> 01:57:46,883
Honey, ain't nobody done
nothing to spite you.

1287
01:57:46,984 --> 01:57:48,515
Yes, indeed.

1288
01:57:50,303 --> 01:57:54,089
She an ugly little girl, too.
That little pug nose...

1289
01:57:54,522 --> 01:57:57,955
I hope she grow out of it.
- You need to stop that.

1290
01:57:58,537 --> 01:57:59,802
You know that ain't right.

1291
01:57:59,903 --> 01:58:02,861
Don't you think she look a little
like Louis around the mouth?

1292
01:58:02,912 --> 01:58:07,427
I think she look just like you.
- Like me?! - Yes.

1293
01:58:07,488 --> 01:58:10,684
So, you need to stop
talking about her.

1294
01:58:11,656 --> 01:58:14,866
Let me look at her again
then real good...

1295
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:20,011
She do look a little bit like me.

1296
01:58:20,412 --> 01:58:22,122
She a pretty little thang.

1297
01:58:28,484 --> 01:58:30,580
I forgot where I put my Bible.

1298
01:58:31,883 --> 01:58:34,155
You know I need my Bible.

1299
01:58:34,970 --> 01:58:38,496
I think I left it in the bathroom.
- Why is Louis late?

1300
01:58:40,262 --> 01:58:42,614
Boy gets elected into Congress

1301
01:58:43,307 --> 01:58:46,733
and he ain't been on time
getting us to church ever since.

1302
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:49,519
I can't believe,
you still fussing...

1303
01:58:49,550 --> 01:58:51,147
He's going to be late
to his own funeral.

1304
01:58:51,228 --> 01:58:54,715
You still fussing about Louis. - He
said he gonna be here for us!

1305
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,212
Go ahead and call.
- I ain't calling Louis.

1306
01:59:00,146 --> 01:59:02,499
I'm gonna get my purse...

1307
01:59:07,755 --> 01:59:09,795
What did you say, Isiah...

1308
01:59:10,961 --> 01:59:13,634
You got that mark here.

1309
01:59:16,305 --> 01:59:21,077
I'm gonna fall over myself.
Baby...

1310
01:59:35,175 --> 01:59:36,966
Baby?

1311
01:59:39,078 --> 01:59:40,872
Honey?

1312
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:46,082
You sleeping?

1313
01:59:49,948 --> 01:59:52,139
Baby?

1314
01:59:53,734 --> 01:59:55,638
Are you alright?

1315
02:00:48,576 --> 02:00:50,539
Louis!

1316
02:00:55,791 --> 02:00:58,631
Louis, come on down!
Come down!

1317
02:01:02,271 --> 02:01:06,695
<i>And CNN can now project that
Barack Obama, 47 years old,

1318
02:01:06,726 --> 02:01:10,561

of the United States.

1319
02:01:12,124 --> 02:01:14,892
<i>If there is anyone out there,

1320
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:21,145
<i>who still doubts that America is a
place where all things are possible;

1321
02:01:22,433 --> 02:01:28,275
<i>who still wonders, if the dream of
our founders is alive in our time;

1322
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:33,032
<i>who still questions the power
of our democracy,

1323
02:01:33,666 --> 02:01:36,078
<i>tonight is your answer.

1324
02:02:41,777 --> 02:02:44,154
Look them in the eye...

1325
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:48,927
See what it is they want.

1326
02:02:50,564 --> 02:02:53,117
See what it is they need.

1327
02:02:55,127 --> 02:02:56,820
Anticipate.

1328
02:03:00,019 --> 02:03:03,815
Bring a smile to
the principal's eyes...

1329
02:03:12,131 --> 02:03:16,081
Mr. Gaines, I'm Admiral Rochon
the Chief Usher.

1330
02:03:23,544 --> 02:03:27,180
It's nice to meet you, Chief.
- The pleasure's all mine, sir.

1331
02:03:30,862 --> 02:03:33,798
I just wanted to tell you what
an honor it is to meet you, sir.

1332
02:03:35,636 --> 02:03:37,605
The honor is mine.

1333
02:03:37,646 --> 02:03:40,260
The President so excited
to meet with you.

1334
02:03:41,346 --> 02:03:42,291
Well...

1335
02:03:46,074 --> 02:03:47,912
that's just fine.

1336
02:03:48,723 --> 02:03:51,927
Let me show you the way.
- I know the way.

1337
02:03:56,315 --> 02:03:58,239
The heart of the question is,

1338
02:03:58,339 --> 02:04:03,768
whether all Americans are to be afforded
equal rights and equal opportunities.

1339
02:04:05,095 --> 02:04:07,830
It is the effort of American Negros,

1340
02:04:08,705 --> 02:04:14,620
to secure for themselves the full
blessings of American life.

1341
02:04:16,277 --> 02:04:18,652
We will respond with
that timeless creed

1342
02:04:18,693 --> 02:04:21,207
that sums up the
spirit of a people:

1343
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:23,369
Yes, we can!

1344
02:04:23,469 --> 02:04:26,228
<i>This film is dedicated
