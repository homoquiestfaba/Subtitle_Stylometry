Where Sleeping Dogs Lie (1991)

3
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:38,616
<i>"To live...</i>

4
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:40,950
<i>is to battle with fiends...</i>

5
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:46,449
<i>in the vaults of heart and mind.</i>

6
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:48,461
<i>To write:</i>

7
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:52,329
<i>that is to sit in judgment</i>
<i>over one's self."</i>

8
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,062
<i>Ibsen said that.</i>

9
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:56,562
<i>He was right.</i>

10
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:35,674
Jesus!

11
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,377
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

12
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:43,849
Come on! Come on!

13
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:45,886
Shit! Shit!

14
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:50,890
Jesus!

15
00:03:57,064 --> 00:04:00,465
<i>I'm learning one good thing--</i>

16
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:03,264
<i>that if you're</i>
<i>in trouble or hurting...</i>

17
00:04:03,337 --> 00:04:06,773
go to the poor people.

18
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:10,072
They're the only ones
who understand.

19
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:12,078
The only ones.

20
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:16,674
She holds his face in her hands.

21
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:19,982
"Don't mess with the bosses," she tells
them. "They'll beat the hell out of you.

22
00:04:20,054 --> 00:04:22,989
If they do, they figure you're the one
who started the trouble at the plant."

23
00:04:23,057 --> 00:04:25,218
Tom shakes her.

24
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:27,920
"I'm doin' it," he says
"because I have to.

25
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:33,092
Because it's for you, and me and
all the souls that want a better life.

26
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:37,194
That's what makes it right!"

27
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:41,105
- I hear a voice. Two flashlights fall--
- Excuse me. One second.

28
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:45,712
Hi. Put her through.

29
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,714
Hi, honey bunny.

30
00:04:49,383 --> 00:04:51,317
No, I'm in a meeting
with a young writer.

31
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:53,114
You don't know him.

32
00:04:54,522 --> 00:04:58,117
Mmm, I love that outfit.

33
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:00,786
Uh-huh. Okay.
See you tonight.

34
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:03,262
Go on, Bruce.

35
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:06,799
I hear a voice.

36
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:09,563
Two flashlights fall on them,
blinding them.

37
00:05:09,637 --> 00:05:11,935
The voice comes out of the darkness.
"Stand where you are...

38
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:13,940
you slippery red bastard."

39
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:17,774
Tom stares blindly into the light.
He says, "You leave her alone.

40
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:21,076
I'll take you all.
You don't understand what you're doing."

41
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:23,946
She's trying to drag him away
because she's frightened for him.

42
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:26,111
They hear the sound
of a dozen footsteps...

43
00:05:26,187 --> 00:05:28,280
see them break
through the undergrowth.

44
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:30,949
"There he is,
the red son of a bitch!"

45
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,425
- Tom turns to face him--
- Bruce.

46
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:36,190
- He dies, doesn't he?
- Yeah.

47
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:38,197
That's right, he dies.
And this--

48
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:42,759
As I told you before, people go
to the movies to see winners.

49
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:46,772
How am I gonna sell that?

50
00:05:47,842 --> 00:05:50,037
I'm trying to be helpful, Bruce.

51
00:05:51,512 --> 00:05:53,480
But you have to understand.

52
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:57,877
It's okay to have a loser in plays.
I love plays.

53
00:05:57,952 --> 00:06:01,080
But the public doesn't want
to see a loser on the screen.

54
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,625
Movies are more
than just a great business.

55
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:12,632
They're our social responsibility.

56
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,830
I'd rather starve than write most of
the crap that I see on the screen.

57
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:19,805
Bruce?

58
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:23,876
That's what you're doing, isn't it?

59
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:41,058
Okay, Evan.

60
00:06:41,128 --> 00:06:43,062
Okay.

61
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:49,094
There must be something
I can write...

62
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,606
that doesn't need a happy ending.

63
00:06:57,378 --> 00:06:59,312
I'll call you.

64
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,008
I'll call you, okay?

65
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,694
Bruce, the door!

66
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:36,315
Serena?

67
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:40,787
Serena?

68
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,384
Oh, hi, Bruce.
I didn't see you.

69
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:49,395
Right, right. Bruce.

70
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:53,422
- You remember.
- Don't hassle me. I said I'd call you.

71
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,968
You haven't called me
in seven months.

72
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:58,766
Write something I can sell.
Then I'll call you, okay?

73
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,704
Come on.
You know I'm a good writer.

74
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:03,675
You write what you want,
not what I can sell. I'm late.

75
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,714
Bruce?

76
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:13,384
Write something that grabs me
between the legs.

77
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:17,447
Write something that makes me laugh,
makes me scream.

78
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:21,585
Write something that
makes me call Mel Gibson.

79
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:24,392
Sweetie, feelings, morals,
all that sweet-smelling shit...

80
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:26,433
went out with the bullet
with two Kennedys.

81
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:28,934
Two bullets.

82
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:30,994
Whatever.

83
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:33,801
If you want to talk to me,
you know where to find me.

84
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:38,072
If you have any new ideas,
my ears are always open.

85
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:44,917
It's all a compromise, Bruce.

86
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,688
We've all got to compromise.

87
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:02,829
Oh, thank you.

88
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:10,542
These are delicious.

89
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,713
You wanted to see me?

90
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,111
Yes, I did. Yeah.

91
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,017
- Seems we've got a little problem here.
- Oh, yeah?

92
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,558
How long are you workin'
for Reeb Realty now?

93
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:28,060
About six months?

94
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:30,722
And you haven't turned over
a single shithouse.

95
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:34,163
I'll do my best.
You've got my word on that.

96
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:39,538
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

97
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:42,370
I got a house here.
Fine house.

98
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:46,372
You sell that house, and you're set.

99
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:49,739
I'll remember you for this, Stan.

100
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:52,911
Don't remember me.
Do a good job.

101
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:55,285
I will.
I promise you that.

102
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:56,789
Keep me posted.

103
00:09:56,857 --> 00:10:00,452
- You take care.
- Thanks a lot. Oh, Stan.

104
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:05,263
I'm short on the rent.
I need to borrow some money.

105
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:07,391
Could I have a few dollars?

106
00:10:07,468 --> 00:10:12,269
You know, Bruce,
if you got anything, you got balls.

107
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:19,242
Hey, what are you guys doing?

108
00:10:19,313 --> 00:10:21,406
- What are you guys doing?
- You're outta here.

109
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:23,416
- This is my shit.
- You're evicted.

110
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:26,317
You're full of shit!
Gimme my stuff.

111
00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:29,789
You sons of bitches.

112
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:32,223
Let me in there.
Let me in there!

113
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,993
Shit!

114
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:55,476
Mrs. Reeb?
Hi, it's Bruce.

115
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:58,780
Is Stan there?

116
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:01,218
Great.
Can I talk to him?

117
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:07,853
Stan, hi.

118
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:09,862
It's Bruce.

119
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,195
Yeah, Stan...

120
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:17,303
I just got evicted.

121
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,600
I really need
to borrow some money.

122
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:28,439
Stan.
Stan, I got nowhere else to go.

123
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:32,551
Where am I supposed to stay, Stan?

124
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:34,917
Stan? Hello--

125
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:49,057
Allison.
She's a possibility.

126
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:57,666
Nancy. Nancy would be great.
Nancy.

127
00:11:57,744 --> 00:12:01,680
No, I think she's--
Nancy's married now.

128
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:03,181
Shit, she's off.

129
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,486
Who else?

130
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:11,285
Betty, Betty.
Betty's good, Betty's good.

131
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:14,885
No, she-- No, she hates me.
Oh, Christ!

132
00:12:14,962 --> 00:12:17,858
I gotta get out of here.

133
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:20,056
I gotta get out of here.

134
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:28,734
What the fuck is this?

135
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:39,745
The Davenport house.

136
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:42,746
Hello, baby.

137
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,250
Thank you.
Thank you.

138
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:18,381
<i>It seemed like a good idea at the time.</i>

139
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,325
<i>A free place to stay.</i>

140
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:26,025
<i>I always believed deep down</i>
<i>that when things go bad...</i>

141
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:28,033
<i>they're gonna get worse.</i>

142
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:33,235
<i>Like someone once said...</i>

143
00:13:33,307 --> 00:13:37,505
<i>in L.A. you can find sympathy...</i>

144
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:39,546
<i>in the dictionary...</i>

145
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:43,606
<i>and everything else</i>
<i>in the drugstore.</i>

146
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:54,378
It could be a story about a hooker.

147
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:57,719
Yeah, she--
She, um--

148
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,625
She gets-- She gets killed.
No, we've seen that.

149
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:04,892
How about a killer cop?
We've seen that about a thousand times.

150
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:08,365
I know, I know.
A killer robot...

151
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:11,370
comes to Hollywood,
takes over the major studios...

152
00:15:11,438 --> 00:15:14,805
and he becomes
the number one guy in town.

153
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,070
And all he does
is cast Mickey Rourke in films.

154
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:19,078
Everywhere you go,
you see Mickey Rourke.

155
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:22,274
"Hi, how ya doin'?
What's the matter with you?

156
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:24,909
Why you so fucked up?"
Everywhere you go, Mickey Rourke.

157
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:27,351
Mickey Rourke this,
Mickey Rourke that.

158
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:31,255
People start killing themselves. They
see these Mickey Rourke films. "Why?"

159
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:33,691
Yeah, I think that'll sell.

160
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,058
It's a big hit.
I'll send it to Mickey.

161
00:15:52,312 --> 00:15:54,906
The door was open.

162
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:57,541
I was wondering
if you had a room to rent.

163
00:15:57,617 --> 00:16:00,017
I've been looking for an apartment.

164
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:02,578
Yeah, well, maybe.
Maybe.

165
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:06,592
You wanna come back tomorrow?
Now is not-- It's not a good time.

166
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:15,701
Okay. But maybe about
the apart-- the room?

167
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:19,034
Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

168
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:24,534
That's great. Great.

169
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:26,545
Okay.

170
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:01,040
What I particularly like about
that kitchen is there's enough space...

171
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:04,845
so you can put as many appliances
in there as you really need.

172
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:09,218
Say you need another freezer
or something, which I like to have.

173
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:14,249
Um, now in terms of the breakfast--

174
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:17,592
Disregard these antiques.

175
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:19,723
Antiques?

176
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,204
All right, here we go.
This is a lovely room.

177
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:28,036
This is the dining room.

178
00:17:30,343 --> 00:17:32,777
It's decorated with great taste,
don't you think?

179
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:34,279
Oh, yes.

180
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:45,716
Is there anything wrong?

181
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:50,559
He did do--
He did do it here?

182
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:55,067
- What are you talking about?
- We just got into town.

183
00:17:55,135 --> 00:17:57,831
We heard all about it.

184
00:17:57,904 --> 00:17:59,963
About what, for Christ's sake?

185
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:02,407
Jack?

186
00:18:02,476 --> 00:18:05,070
Wanda, don't worry.
He's just putting you on.

187
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:08,342
No, really, I'm sorry.
I must've missed something.

188
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:10,349
What are you talking about?

189
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:16,482
The Carrols! This is where
he killed all those Carrols!

190
00:18:16,556 --> 00:18:19,684
Surely you've heard about it.
He must've used an axe or something.

191
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,557
- Chopped 'em up into a thousand pieces.
- I read about it in the paper.

192
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:25,564
- There was blood everywhere.
- I don't wanna hear any more.

193
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:27,896
I don't want
to hear any more, please.

194
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:31,995
Thank you for coming by.
Please.

195
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:34,768
Well, if that's the way
you want it, of course.

196
00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:38,504
Sorry. We just-- Sorry.

197
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:14,073
Hi. Is this...

198
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:18,075
Moretti?

199
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,350
Is this Moretti's?

200
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:29,327
Thanks.

201
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:08,800
Hi.

202
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,641
Serena?

203
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,644
Back here, baby.

204
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:21,704
Does this look like $1,200?
Okay.

205
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:24,579
Then I'll take that.
So, go on.

206
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:26,710
- What?
- The pitch, Bruce, the story.

207
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:29,721
What you couldn't tell me
on the phone. That too.

208
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:31,950
It's a story about a guy.
His name's Tom.

209
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:34,687
He's a really good guy.
He has a dream.

210
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:38,458
Shit!
Bruce, dreams?

211
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:41,989
By the time I come out of here,
I want that dream to be gone.

212
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:43,933
Okay, time's up.

213
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:47,735
I'll have that.
Give me something dark, okay?

214
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:49,741
That's it. Dark!

215
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:51,743
You didn't let me finish the story.

216
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:55,178
People don't give a shit
about dreams anymore. They just don't.

217
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:57,944
You've gotta give them what they want.
You gotta give me--

218
00:20:58,018 --> 00:21:02,785
Give me-- I don't know.
Give me madness, Bruce.

219
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:04,824
You know?
Or give me...

220
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,393
blood.

221
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:11,191
Yeah, that's it.
That's what they want.

222
00:21:11,264 --> 00:21:13,630
Give me blood.

223
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,726
- I'll take everything but the hat.
- Very well.

224
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:58,162
Hello?

225
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:12,104
Hello.

226
00:25:10,703 --> 00:25:12,136
Blood.

227
00:25:56,316 --> 00:25:57,749
Blood.

228
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:00,206
Yes. Yes.

229
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,338
That's exactly it.

230
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:13,517
Is that what they want?

231
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:16,426
Oh, yes, then I'll give it to 'em.
Yes!

232
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:19,294
Yes, yes, yes!
I'll give it to 'em.

233
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:22,892
Yes! Yes!
I'll give it to 'em. Yes!

234
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:36,971
"Similarities have been established
between the Davenport slayings...

235
00:28:37,043 --> 00:28:39,910
and the Harris murders
six years ago.

236
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:41,913
Both families were wiped out.

237
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:44,609
Just as in both cases
no sexual motive can be established...

238
00:28:44,684 --> 00:28:49,348
as neither the Harrises' or
the Carrols' bodies were ever found."

239
00:29:01,134 --> 00:29:03,068
"It was not until the following day...

240
00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:05,195
that detectives found
the entrance to the cellar...

241
00:29:05,271 --> 00:29:09,105
where it was believed
the bodies were dismembered."

242
00:29:09,175 --> 00:29:11,109
Jesus Christ.

243
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,243
"In cases as bizarre
as the Davenport killing...

244
00:29:17,316 --> 00:29:20,752
every detail
in the investigation...

245
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,311
must be gone over
again and again.

246
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:28,486
Even though eight years
have passed since the killing...

247
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:32,122
no new light
has fallen on the case.

248
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:35,997
The motive remains obscure...

249
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:40,232
the key evidence elusive."

250
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:53,848
"This shadow killing
has tormented detectives...

251
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,686
haunting their personal lives
with a deathly stain...

252
00:29:57,757 --> 00:30:00,351
on all who come in contact
with this story."

253
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:08,400
Come on.
I'll show you the bedroom.

254
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:11,061
I don't know if this means
anything to you...

255
00:30:11,137 --> 00:30:15,801
but this was Ricardo Montalban's
original Hollywood home.

256
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,536
Really? He's my favorite actor.

257
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,043
Really?

258
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:22,137
<i>Fantasy Island.</i>
Greatest show ever made.

259
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:25,748
It's got its own bathroom.

260
00:30:30,623 --> 00:30:32,648
- How much are you asking?
- It won't be for long.

261
00:30:32,725 --> 00:30:34,659
I've got a book deal.

262
00:30:34,727 --> 00:30:36,160
- You a writer?
- Yeah.

263
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:39,858
Say 350 a month
until I get my advance?

264
00:30:39,932 --> 00:30:41,365
That'd be fine.

265
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:44,028
We could do it by the month.

266
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:47,595
- Whatever. That'd be great.
- Okay.

267
00:30:47,673 --> 00:30:49,106
So--

268
00:30:52,878 --> 00:30:56,109
Enjoy. Come on.
I'll show you the house.

269
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,324
...to catch intelligent
psychopaths, as often...

270
00:31:06,392 --> 00:31:09,156
they leave no trace of motive,
making it necessary...

271
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:13,028
to reconstruct
the murderer's thinking.

272
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:15,932
Somewhere out there a killer
is living an ordinary life--

273
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:21,338
eating, drinking,
maybe reading articles like this one.

274
00:31:21,407 --> 00:31:23,534
In the case of
the Davenport killings...

275
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:28,012
evidence of sadistic concentration
on female members...

276
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,744
lead detectives to believe
that the killer was male.

277
00:31:52,405 --> 00:31:54,930
I just made up some coffee.

278
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:56,941
Would you like a cup?

279
00:31:57,977 --> 00:32:00,104
I'm working.

280
00:32:02,848 --> 00:32:07,012
Yes, I'm-- I'm sorry.

281
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:08,519
Pardon me.

282
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,716
Society...

283
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:49,090
wants to believe it can identify...

284
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,462
evil...

285
00:32:53,532 --> 00:32:54,965
or bad...

286
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,661
or harmful people.

287
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,502
But it's not practical.

288
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:07,802
<i>You see, there are no stereotypes.</i>

289
00:33:10,383 --> 00:33:14,615
<i>The thing is</i>
<i>that some people...</i>

290
00:33:14,687 --> 00:33:18,987
<i>are just psychologically...</i>

291
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:23,661
<i>less ready...</i>

292
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:30,963
<i>for failure...</i>

293
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:32,970
<i>than others.</i>

294
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:46,150
You been here long?

295
00:33:46,218 --> 00:33:48,516
In L.A.?

296
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:51,488
Oh, I was--

297
00:33:51,557 --> 00:33:54,685
I was in Las Vegas before.

298
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,593
I worked at one of the casinos.

299
00:33:58,764 --> 00:34:02,666
Which casino was that?
I hate those places. Noisy as hell.

300
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:07,766
Oh, I, uh--
I had a room to myself....

301
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,537
where I'd clean the chips, you know.

302
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:16,441
They spit on them...

303
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:18,449
for good luck.

304
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:21,452
I never tried that.

305
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:25,849
Maybe I should have.

306
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:28,325
Maybe I should spit
on my book for good luck.

307
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:32,825
I'm sure it's quite good.

308
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:36,390
Yeah, well, we'll see.

309
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,103
Good night.

310
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:40,604
Good--

311
00:34:45,177 --> 00:34:47,145
Good night.

312
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,961
It's dynamite.

313
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:13,271
You've done something wild.

314
00:35:14,507 --> 00:35:17,806
Surprised me--
You really did.

315
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:19,310
Good.

316
00:35:21,013 --> 00:35:23,208
And it's true, right?

317
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:31,882
It's the real thing, right?

318
00:35:33,158 --> 00:35:35,888
And you're talking
direct to the source, right?

319
00:35:37,696 --> 00:35:41,132
I can get you such a deal,
you won't believe it.

320
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,134
This could be a best-seller.

321
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:48,462
Where is he?

322
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,478
Who is he?

323
00:35:56,215 --> 00:35:59,343
I can't tell you that.

324
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:02,353
No, I guess not.

325
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:06,289
Hello. Serena Black's office.
May I help you?

326
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:09,020
You think you can get me
a book deal?

327
00:36:09,094 --> 00:36:11,585
Seriously?

328
00:36:11,664 --> 00:36:13,723
I'm damn sure of it.

329
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:16,825
You know, you've come a long way
since <i>Poetry and Lies.</i>

330
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:26,344
- You read that?
- You don't remember?

331
00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:27,845
No.

332
00:36:27,913 --> 00:36:31,482
You read it to me in bed.
You don't remember?

333
00:36:36,956 --> 00:36:40,858
Look, Serena, I think
I should tell you something.

334
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:45,793
Forget it.

335
00:36:45,864 --> 00:36:48,162
Go home, write your book...

336
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:51,225
let me call New York.

337
00:37:00,045 --> 00:37:01,569
I love you.

338
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:09,717
Serena Black's office.
May I help you?

339
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:12,086
All right, I'll transfer you.

340
00:37:12,157 --> 00:37:15,285
Yes, she'll be delighted
to know that. All right.

341
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:18,091
- All right. Okay.
- Shit.

342
00:37:18,163 --> 00:37:20,631
That's right.
And this guy, the murderer...

343
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:23,361
is telling him his story.

344
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:28,338
No, it's unsolved.
I know. I love it.

345
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:30,932
It's so hot.

346
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,706
Yeah, I think--
Uh-huh.

347
00:37:33,779 --> 00:37:35,713
I need to talk to you.

348
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:40,784
Yeah? Deal.

349
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:44,588
We did it.

350
00:37:44,657 --> 00:37:47,023
We got a deal.

351
00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:48,525
It's fiction.

352
00:37:50,362 --> 00:37:54,526
I'm making it up.
It's pure fiction.

353
00:37:57,636 --> 00:37:59,968
I'm not hearing this.

354
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:03,907
You told me it was the real stuff,
I sold it as the real stuff.

355
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:06,342
- Don't fuck me around.
- You gotta call 'em.

356
00:38:06,412 --> 00:38:10,109
Call New York and tell 'em, okay?
You gotta call 'em.

357
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,485
Let me tell you one thing.
Okay?

358
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:17,545
You're a failure!
You can't sell your work!

359
00:38:17,623 --> 00:38:20,319
I don't care where you got it.
You made it up? Great.

360
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:23,452
But my deal with the publisher is,
it's the real story...

361
00:38:23,529 --> 00:38:25,963
sold to you by the real guy.

362
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:27,965
Got it?

363
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:29,728
I lied.

364
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:33,936
I lied.

365
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:36,133
Who gives a shit?

366
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:38,142
Just shut up and do it!

367
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,610
I don't think
you understand something.

368
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:44,046
I'm writing the whole thing.
I'm making it up.

369
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:46,984
Okay.

370
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,086
They don't want to know that!

371
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,060
It's the murderer's confession
they're interested in.

372
00:38:57,129 --> 00:38:59,620
Got that?

373
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:05,036
Your name on the book means zilch.

374
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:07,804
I'm sorry.

375
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:10,741
Zilch.

376
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:26,223
"Name means zilch."

377
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,816
"Name means zilch."

378
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,488
What a fuckin' day.

379
00:42:49,461 --> 00:42:50,894
Hale!

380
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,225
Hale!

381
00:43:00,806 --> 00:43:02,967
We better get some things
clear in this house.

382
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:07,273
I don't want to hear you in the morning.
I don't want to see or hear you anytime.

383
00:43:07,346 --> 00:43:10,315
You got that?
Jesus.

384
00:43:15,787 --> 00:43:17,721
I read your book.

385
00:43:19,024 --> 00:43:20,958
You did what?

386
00:43:23,362 --> 00:43:27,765
- I read part of your book.
- You did what?

387
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:30,097
Get this straight, Hale.
Never!

388
00:43:30,168 --> 00:43:34,298
Never go near my work again. You go
near that room again and you are out!

389
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:36,739
You understand that?
Out!

390
00:43:42,781 --> 00:43:44,214
Right.

391
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,648
I got you.

392
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:55,992
Got you.

393
00:44:26,324 --> 00:44:28,258
You don't mind?

394
00:44:30,695 --> 00:44:34,688
No. The garden looks like shit.

395
00:44:36,034 --> 00:44:37,729
Listen.

396
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:40,931
I'm sorry I was hard
on you this morning.

397
00:44:43,275 --> 00:44:44,708
That's okay.

398
00:44:44,776 --> 00:44:47,677
You wanna come in for a drink?

399
00:44:49,181 --> 00:44:52,082
Come on. My treat.

400
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,141
Okay.

401
00:45:07,632 --> 00:45:10,465
- Here, come on.
- No, no.

402
00:45:10,535 --> 00:45:15,097
No. I never drink alcohol.

403
00:45:15,173 --> 00:45:20,372
"Men put an enemy in their mouths
to steal away their brains."

404
00:45:23,448 --> 00:45:25,973
Oh,Jesus.
What's that from?

405
00:45:27,052 --> 00:45:29,612
<i>Othello.</i>
It's from <i>Othello.</i>

406
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:32,915
That's right.
Oh, Jesus.

407
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:39,063
I used to know all those quotes,
always spurting them out all the time.

408
00:45:39,131 --> 00:45:44,091
"Who is the third that walks
always beside you?

409
00:45:44,169 --> 00:45:46,797
There's always another one
walking beside you.

410
00:45:49,674 --> 00:45:52,837
But who is that
on the other side of you?"

411
00:45:56,882 --> 00:45:58,850
I don't know that one.

412
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,183
Eliot, T.S.

413
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:12,996
I work at a supermarket.

414
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:16,433
I never forget anything.

415
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:18,662
Manager...

416
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:23,875
at a supermarket.

417
00:46:23,942 --> 00:46:25,876
That's great.

418
00:46:30,248 --> 00:46:33,615
I guess I'm gonna get back to work.

419
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:38,421
I won't disturb you then.

420
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:20,196
Help me, Bill.

421
00:47:20,265 --> 00:47:22,563
Help me, help me, help me.

422
00:47:32,744 --> 00:47:36,043
"Is this a dagger
which I see before me...

423
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:38,480
the handle toward my hand?

424
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,280
Come, let me clutch thee.

425
00:47:41,353 --> 00:47:45,050
I have thee not, and yet...

426
00:47:45,123 --> 00:47:48,422
I see thee still.

427
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:51,428
Art thou not, fatal vision?"

428
00:47:54,866 --> 00:47:56,800
Fatal vision.

429
00:48:06,177 --> 00:48:08,907
Thinking of giving her
a paint job next?

430
00:48:10,448 --> 00:48:13,383
It's the least I can do.

431
00:48:16,221 --> 00:48:18,189
Not working today?

432
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:23,427
No. I was just wondering
how I would get in...

433
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:25,793
if I wanted to kill the people inside.

434
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:30,623
There isn't anybody inside, Mr. Simmons.
We're all out here today.

435
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:34,632
Call me Bruce.

436
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:37,072
I'm sorry. Bruce.

437
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:44,204
Well, I guess most likely you'd just
walk right in the front door.

438
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,045
I read that somewhere.

439
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,849
People-- they usually know
who they're going to kill.

440
00:48:50,922 --> 00:48:52,856
They know them.

441
00:48:52,924 --> 00:48:56,121
Something crazy,
like eight out of ten.

442
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:01,293
You seem to know
a hell of a lot about it.

443
00:49:04,502 --> 00:49:06,561
I'm sorry, I was just--

444
00:49:06,638 --> 00:49:08,833
I was just trying to help.

445
00:49:11,576 --> 00:49:13,771
Nothing personal.

446
00:49:14,879 --> 00:49:17,973
It's true, though, Mr. Simmons.

447
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:38,034
Do you mind if I joined you?

448
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:41,072
No. Go ahead.

449
00:49:53,718 --> 00:49:56,448
You know, it's true.
Statistics show...

450
00:49:56,521 --> 00:50:00,355
that murderers most times,
they know their victims.

451
00:50:04,195 --> 00:50:05,628
Doesn't make sense.

452
00:50:05,697 --> 00:50:09,189
Well, they'd have their reasons,
I guess.

453
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:13,567
They had something against
the person or persons.

454
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:17,540
I mean, people can
hurt one deeply, you know?

455
00:50:20,578 --> 00:50:24,912
I may be crazy, but this was one
of the hardest years of my life.

456
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:27,747
I'm gonna be 30
in a couple of days.

457
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,183
I just hate
workin' on this stuff.

458
00:50:32,257 --> 00:50:35,818
Well, your book is so good.

459
00:50:35,894 --> 00:50:37,919
- You think so?
- Yeah.

460
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:40,396
Everything about it.

461
00:50:40,465 --> 00:50:44,196
- It's just that--
- What?

462
00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:45,702
Well, I--

463
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:50,139
Remember I told you about my memory?
I never forget anything?

464
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:52,802
I've done a lot of reading
since I've studied psychology...

465
00:50:52,877 --> 00:50:57,678
and I don't want to appear presumptuous,
but I'd like to help you here and there.

466
00:50:57,749 --> 00:51:01,913
- It might be fun.
- Jesus Christ! Look at that bastard.

467
00:51:02,821 --> 00:51:04,880
You see him?

468
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:08,825
See what I mean?

469
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:13,023
Even he knew where
to find him, and when.

470
00:51:14,165 --> 00:51:17,726
You have to think
like the hawk, you know...

471
00:51:17,802 --> 00:51:19,736
not the swallow.

472
00:51:19,804 --> 00:51:22,068
Filthy bastard.

473
00:51:25,009 --> 00:51:27,637
It's all right, Bruce.

474
00:51:27,712 --> 00:51:30,909
All human activity...

475
00:51:30,982 --> 00:51:34,440
moves towards a manifestation...

476
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:36,510
of God, you know.

477
00:51:38,022 --> 00:51:40,354
What the hell you talking about?

478
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:45,162
Everything we do...

479
00:51:46,698 --> 00:51:48,893
everything they do...

480
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:51,561
has no meaning...

481
00:51:51,636 --> 00:51:55,436
until God shows his face.

482
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,335
You ever seen his face?

483
00:52:01,412 --> 00:52:03,676
Bruce?

484
00:52:09,487 --> 00:52:11,853
See his face?

485
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:24,224
No.

486
00:52:24,302 --> 00:52:26,236
Of course not.

487
00:53:02,473 --> 00:53:05,874
"Everyone that is found
shall be thrust through.

488
00:53:05,944 --> 00:53:09,277
And everyone that is joined
unto them...

489
00:53:09,347 --> 00:53:12,544
shall fall by the sword.

490
00:53:12,617 --> 00:53:16,849
The children also
shall be dashed to pieces...

491
00:53:16,921 --> 00:53:20,789
and their wives ravished."

492
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:31,735
That's what it says.

493
00:53:37,308 --> 00:53:39,242
Enough for tonight.

494
00:55:10,935 --> 00:55:15,167
Hey, you. I miss you.

495
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:17,707
Come over here and give me a kiss.

496
00:55:23,347 --> 00:55:26,578
Whoa, I'm not feeling you,
writer man.

497
00:55:29,253 --> 00:55:31,221
That's better.

498
00:56:09,861 --> 00:56:11,795
I'm glad you came.

499
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:26,134
Don't look so scared, Bruce.

500
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:30,078
You get your check next week,
and you've got me right now.

501
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:50,165
Hey, you don't want to, don't.

502
00:56:51,836 --> 00:56:54,999
You know what we got today,
Bruce baby?

503
00:56:55,072 --> 00:56:58,667
We got women who want, can't.

504
00:56:58,743 --> 00:57:00,608
Men who aren't.

505
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:02,612
It's the book.
I've got problems.

506
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,113
Who hasn't?

507
00:57:04,182 --> 00:57:06,207
We've all got problems.
So what?

508
00:57:06,284 --> 00:57:09,344
I'm dealing with
a lot of shit right now, Serena.

509
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,149
Listen to you.

510
00:57:11,222 --> 00:57:15,488
You and your fucking
artistic sensibility.

511
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,529
You should be kissing my ass.

512
00:57:18,596 --> 00:57:20,530
I got you your deal.

513
00:57:20,598 --> 00:57:23,761
I got you what you've been whining about
for so long I lost my memory.

514
00:57:23,835 --> 00:57:25,268
I did it.

515
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:29,237
Ever occur to you
what I had to give up?

516
00:57:29,307 --> 00:57:31,935
Did it ever cross your mind
that maybe I wanted...

517
00:57:32,009 --> 00:57:34,603
roses around the door and a baby?

518
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:39,409
And what are you, huh?
You're nothing.

519
00:57:39,483 --> 00:57:42,611
Nothing--
just like me, sweetheart.

520
00:57:42,687 --> 00:57:46,350
In this town, we all
lose our way a little bit.

521
00:57:46,424 --> 00:57:48,483
Gives us a barrel of gold and then...

522
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,824
cuts off our fingers
so we can't count it.

523
00:57:53,931 --> 00:57:57,594
To win, we all have to lose
a little bit.

524
00:57:57,668 --> 00:57:59,659
Tough shit.

525
00:59:01,632 --> 00:59:03,065
Eddie?

526
00:59:22,653 --> 00:59:26,089
Surprise! Surprise.

527
00:59:26,157 --> 00:59:29,058
Jesus Christ.
You scared the hell out of me.

528
00:59:29,126 --> 00:59:33,028
Happy birthday.
I'm not much of a singer.

529
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,336
You didn't have to do this.

530
00:59:40,404 --> 00:59:41,996
It's not even my birthday.

531
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:46,075
It's tomorrow, Eddie.

532
00:59:46,143 --> 00:59:48,077
Tomorrow's my birthday.

533
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:54,783
Well, it's too late now.

534
00:59:55,853 --> 00:59:57,286
Blow out your candles.

535
00:59:57,355 --> 00:59:59,550
Come on now, blow 'em out.

536
01:00:00,624 --> 01:00:03,320
Blow 'em out!

537
01:00:03,394 --> 01:00:05,089
- Okay.
- Make a wish.

538
01:00:15,473 --> 01:00:16,906
Great.

539
01:00:17,775 --> 01:00:19,970
Oh, I forgot the plates.

540
01:00:20,044 --> 01:00:21,978
I'll get 'em.

541
01:00:26,384 --> 01:00:30,548
<i>I always felt that life</i>
<i>was kind of like an elephant.</i>

542
01:00:31,555 --> 01:00:36,515
You know. I liked it.
I loved it sometimes, but--

543
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,524
We could never see eye-to-eye.
It was--

544
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,535
It was just too big for me.

545
01:00:47,204 --> 01:00:48,569
You understand?

546
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:50,072
Yeah, yeah.

547
01:00:51,742 --> 01:00:54,267
I was like that.

548
01:00:54,345 --> 01:00:56,677
My family was great about it.

549
01:00:58,749 --> 01:01:00,683
Me being a loner.

550
01:01:02,053 --> 01:01:04,681
Funny sort of kid.

551
01:01:04,755 --> 01:01:06,689
Always staring at the moon.

552
01:01:13,297 --> 01:01:18,030
Did I ever show you
a picture of my sister?

553
01:01:19,203 --> 01:01:20,693
No.

554
01:01:28,579 --> 01:01:30,012
Here they are.

555
01:01:34,585 --> 01:01:36,519
Look, man.

556
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:43,650
She's a knockout, isn't she?

557
01:01:46,397 --> 01:01:49,389
They look perfect.

558
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:51,230
Perfect.

559
01:02:02,379 --> 01:02:05,143
Mine all died in a crash.

560
01:02:10,788 --> 01:02:12,278
Jesus, Eddie.

561
01:02:16,193 --> 01:02:17,626
Sad.

562
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:22,164
Sad, sad, sad.

563
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:33,275
Well, come on.

564
01:02:33,344 --> 01:02:38,247
Let's get our minds
off this sad stuff.

565
01:02:40,484 --> 01:02:42,179
Feel like doing some work?

566
01:02:42,253 --> 01:02:44,915
The story. Let's do that.

567
01:02:51,195 --> 01:02:53,129
Now, I was thinking.

568
01:02:54,198 --> 01:02:59,101
I saw some--
I've got some clippings of the house.

569
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:01,866
<i>So Eddie and I became friends.</i>

570
01:03:01,939 --> 01:03:05,102
<i>Days slipped into long nights.</i>

571
01:03:05,176 --> 01:03:09,010
<i>Sometimes he made me feel</i>
<i>uncomfortable...</i>

572
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:12,640
<i>when his mind crossed over</i>
<i>into mine.</i>

573
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:16,015
<i>He knew my hopes and dreams</i>
<i>and terrors.</i>

574
01:03:16,086 --> 01:03:18,020
<i>Nothing separated us anymore.</i>

575
01:03:18,088 --> 01:03:21,387
<i>We clicked into place</i>
<i>like a jigsaw puzzle...</i>

576
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:26,157
<i>two minds after one end--</i>
<i>the book to end all books.</i>

577
01:03:37,274 --> 01:03:39,742
Yuck. Yuck, yuck.

578
01:04:04,235 --> 01:04:05,668
What's this?

579
01:04:07,638 --> 01:04:10,038
Oh, it's a doll I found outside.
It was the little girl's.

580
01:04:12,776 --> 01:04:14,710
She needs a bath.

581
01:04:17,781 --> 01:04:20,341
I wonder what it was like
that night.

582
01:04:21,285 --> 01:04:23,583
Well...

583
01:04:23,654 --> 01:04:26,555
he obviously watched them, all right?

584
01:04:27,258 --> 01:04:29,556
They were unaware.

585
01:04:30,728 --> 01:04:33,356
Perfect urban household.

586
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:36,729
Perfect couple and their kids.

587
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,031
That's great. I like that.
I like that a lot.

588
01:04:40,104 --> 01:04:44,131
And him watching like the angel
of sorrow, just like you wrote.

589
01:04:46,677 --> 01:04:49,908
TV on, the roast cooking
through there in the kitchen.

590
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:53,677
- Jennifer pouring Chad a drink.
- Scotch.

591
01:04:55,686 --> 01:04:59,247
Do you think the murderer
could have been jealous, maybe?

592
01:05:00,357 --> 01:05:01,790
Angry?

593
01:05:11,001 --> 01:05:13,026
You ever love a woman, Eddie?

594
01:05:13,103 --> 01:05:14,764
- Me?
- Mmm.

595
01:05:22,379 --> 01:05:24,313
It would have to be something
important...

596
01:05:24,381 --> 01:05:26,611
for him to kill the whole bunch
of them, don't you think?

597
01:05:26,684 --> 01:05:31,781
Maybe, maybe not. I mean, it could have
been in himself, you know.

598
01:05:31,855 --> 01:05:33,789
Building up.

599
01:05:33,857 --> 01:05:37,953
Something about them seriously
interfering with his ability to survive.

600
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:42,961
I know that sounds mad.
I read that somewhere.

601
01:05:43,033 --> 01:05:46,799
Bundy, at school.

602
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:49,065
I was at school.

603
01:05:52,743 --> 01:05:54,938
And sex?

604
01:05:55,012 --> 01:05:57,207
He'd have some deep problems
with sex.

605
01:05:58,582 --> 01:06:02,040
Sex could be a factor, I guess.

606
01:06:11,028 --> 01:06:12,461
There you go.

607
01:06:12,529 --> 01:06:16,226
Listen, if this is getting to you,
you know, all this stuff...

608
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,667
you can just go ahead
and do what you have to do.

609
01:06:19,737 --> 01:06:22,331
I'll take care of it.

610
01:06:22,406 --> 01:06:24,601
No. No, I--

611
01:06:25,743 --> 01:06:27,301
I want to help you.

612
01:06:27,378 --> 01:06:31,644
It's important that
you get it right.

613
01:06:34,051 --> 01:06:35,814
Why?

614
01:06:35,886 --> 01:06:38,252
I'm making the whole thing up.

615
01:06:40,824 --> 01:06:42,348
Who's gonna care?

616
01:06:44,795 --> 01:06:47,195
You are.

617
01:06:47,264 --> 01:06:48,697
You'll care.

618
01:06:50,968 --> 01:06:52,701
Work.

619
01:06:57,107 --> 01:06:58,840
Work.

620
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,642
Put that back on the shelf, will you?

621
01:07:05,716 --> 01:07:07,149
Sure.

622
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:10,584
<i>The Davenport killer...</i>

623
01:07:10,654 --> 01:07:16,092
<i>seems to have been more typical</i>
<i>of a serial murderer...</i>

624
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:20,358
<i>with a ritual that might break down</i>
<i>into key phases.</i>

625
01:07:21,632 --> 01:07:25,193
<i>How to put it in his own words.</i>

626
01:07:25,269 --> 01:07:29,797
<i>When I first entered the Davenport house</i>
<i>to kill...</i>

627
01:07:29,873 --> 01:07:33,240
<i>time seemed to slow down.</i>

628
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:35,870
<i>Sounds and colors became more vivid...</i>

629
01:07:35,946 --> 01:07:38,278
<i>odors more intense...</i>

630
01:07:38,348 --> 01:07:41,317
<i>and my skin became sensitive...</i>

631
01:07:41,385 --> 01:07:43,910
<i>to even the slightest pressure.</i>

632
01:07:43,987 --> 01:07:48,287
<i>The aura phase begins as a prolonged</i>
<i>fantasy.</i>

633
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:51,327
<i>The killer acts out</i>
<i>the thrill of the crime...</i>

634
01:07:51,395 --> 01:07:52,828
<i>in his own mind.</i>

635
01:07:52,896 --> 01:07:58,095
<i>Every stranger who crosses his path</i>
<i>becomes a performer in that fantasy...</i>

636
01:07:58,168 --> 01:08:00,728
<i>until an emotional trip wire...</i>

637
01:08:00,804 --> 01:08:03,102
<i>is snapped.</i>

638
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:02,891
Shit.

639
01:11:12,696 --> 01:11:14,129
Morning, Eddie.

640
01:11:15,999 --> 01:11:18,263
I'm gonna make some breakfast.
You want some?

641
01:11:58,075 --> 01:11:59,906
You okay?

642
01:12:02,512 --> 01:12:04,503
You want me to call the market?

643
01:12:21,598 --> 01:12:24,692
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi. I'm a friend of Eddie Hale's.

644
01:12:24,768 --> 01:12:28,534
He was sick today.
He'll be in tomorrow. Okay?

645
01:12:28,605 --> 01:12:30,266
<i>Las Palmas Market?</i>

646
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:32,638
Yeah. Your manager, Eddie Hale.

647
01:12:32,709 --> 01:12:34,643
He'll be in tomorrow.
He was sick today.

648
01:12:34,711 --> 01:12:38,670
<i>Hale? We don't have a Hale here.</i>
<i>Our manager is a lady.</i>

649
01:12:38,749 --> 01:12:41,684
Is this the Las Palmas Market
on Sunset and Fairfax?

650
01:12:41,752 --> 01:12:44,585
<i>You got it.</i>
<i>No Eddie Hale here, buddy.</i>

651
01:12:44,654 --> 01:12:46,087
<i>Wrong place.</i>

652
01:14:44,641 --> 01:14:50,511
<i>Therefore I will set free your body</i>
<i>from its evil desires, you bitch.</i>

653
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:53,879
<i>Do not offer the parts of your body</i>
<i>to sin--</i>

654
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:57,716
<i>- No!</i>
<i>- But rather offer yourselves to God.</i>

655
01:14:57,787 --> 01:15:01,723
<i>Fucking-- As those who've been born</i>
<i>from death to life.</i>

656
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:04,055
<i>And offer the parts of your body--</i>

657
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,198
<i>Bitch.</i>
<i>You ungrate--</i>

658
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:17,434
<i>What better than you would be untied</i>
<i>from the things you are now ashamed of?</i>

659
01:15:17,507 --> 01:15:19,907
<i>Those things which result in death.</i>

660
01:15:19,976 --> 01:15:22,945
<i>Stop it, fucking bitch.</i>

661
01:15:23,013 --> 01:15:27,575
<i>Now that you've accepted your sin,</i>
<i>you can become close to God.</i>

662
01:16:00,984 --> 01:16:02,918
Busy day at the store, Eddie?

663
01:16:03,987 --> 01:16:05,420
Terrible.

664
01:16:06,489 --> 01:16:08,423
Terrible day.

665
01:16:13,964 --> 01:16:15,488
What?

666
01:16:17,067 --> 01:16:18,500
What's wrong?

667
01:16:18,568 --> 01:16:22,265
It was you. Wasn't it?

668
01:16:22,339 --> 01:16:24,273
- What are you talking--
- Shut up.

669
01:16:37,354 --> 01:16:38,844
It was you.

670
01:16:43,693 --> 01:16:45,126
Yes, Bruce.

671
01:16:46,596 --> 01:16:48,530
You're writing my story.

672
01:16:53,203 --> 01:16:55,034
I did it.

673
01:16:58,108 --> 01:17:00,042
It was me.

674
01:17:09,986 --> 01:17:12,284
I'm calling the police.

675
01:17:12,355 --> 01:17:16,485
It's no use running and telling, Bruce.
I'd be gone.

676
01:17:16,559 --> 01:17:19,995
I'd be long gone.
Nobody!

677
01:17:20,063 --> 01:17:22,759
Nobody...

678
01:17:22,832 --> 01:17:24,265
catches me.

679
01:17:26,603 --> 01:17:29,163
Don't torture yourself, Bruce.
Don't you see?

680
01:17:29,239 --> 01:17:33,300
Don't you see we're linked now?
We're linked now forever.

681
01:17:33,376 --> 01:17:36,345
We are bonded by this secret.

682
01:17:36,413 --> 01:17:38,574
I only did what you always
thought of doing.

683
01:17:38,648 --> 01:17:43,381
These ordinary,
ugly, suburban people...

684
01:17:43,453 --> 01:17:45,614
who go in for the lowest...

685
01:17:45,688 --> 01:17:48,486
the cheapest thrills.

686
01:17:48,558 --> 01:17:51,493
Junk. Junk!

687
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:53,859
<i>Hang up and try your number--</i>

688
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:56,364
Couldn't sell them the sweet dreams,
now could you?

689
01:17:56,433 --> 01:17:59,994
So I killed them for you.

690
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:02,561
I killed them for you and for me.

691
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,873
Okay.

692
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:11,310
What have you got to lose now? I'm here.
I'm here for you, for your book.

693
01:18:11,381 --> 01:18:13,941
My story, my life!

694
01:18:14,017 --> 01:18:15,951
My life!

695
01:18:18,922 --> 01:18:20,856
Everything you've ever wanted.

696
01:18:20,924 --> 01:18:23,154
Your fortune.

697
01:18:23,226 --> 01:18:25,057
Success.

698
01:18:25,128 --> 01:18:28,757
Isn't that what you want?
Money? Recognition?

699
01:18:29,866 --> 01:18:31,299
Fame?

700
01:18:34,437 --> 01:18:37,338
Money, fame.

701
01:18:37,407 --> 01:18:38,840
Fame!

702
01:18:45,582 --> 01:18:48,608
Fame? Money?
Fame, Bruce?

703
01:18:50,019 --> 01:18:51,953
Where are you going?

704
01:18:58,661 --> 01:19:01,494
<i> Mr. Simmons</i>

705
01:19:01,564 --> 01:19:05,125
<i> Are you not</i>

706
01:19:05,201 --> 01:19:11,106
<i> Gift for you we got</i>

707
01:19:11,174 --> 01:19:16,771
<i> It is money big</i>

708
01:19:16,846 --> 01:19:22,079
<i> For the work you did</i>

709
01:19:22,152 --> 01:19:26,384
<i> From New York City</i>

710
01:19:26,456 --> 01:19:30,358
<i> And your agent, pretty</i>

711
01:19:31,194 --> 01:19:34,789
<i> Huge amount</i>

712
01:19:34,864 --> 01:19:39,597
<i> For your account</i>

713
01:19:39,669 --> 01:19:42,502
Be happy,
'cause here's much applause.

714
01:20:31,187 --> 01:20:34,020
Bruce, could you pass me
those pages, please?

715
01:20:36,793 --> 01:20:38,226
Sure.

716
01:20:45,435 --> 01:20:49,030
I bought something for you.

717
01:20:51,608 --> 01:20:53,599
I don't want anything.

718
01:20:53,676 --> 01:20:55,610
You'll like this.

719
01:21:01,017 --> 01:21:02,450
Like it?

720
01:21:13,029 --> 01:21:14,963
Do you like it?

721
01:21:21,371 --> 01:21:23,805
You must keep the faith, Bruce.

722
01:21:41,491 --> 01:21:44,324
You were late again this morning,
Bruce.

723
01:21:44,394 --> 01:21:46,794
It's hard for me
when you're not disciplined.

724
01:21:46,863 --> 01:21:50,060
It's not good for our concentration.

725
01:21:50,133 --> 01:21:53,728
You know, to verbalize these
sensations...

726
01:21:53,803 --> 01:21:56,271
it's very dangerous for me.

727
01:21:56,339 --> 01:21:58,466
Now, you have to respect that.

728
01:22:00,743 --> 01:22:04,144
Bruce. Bruce, are you listening?

729
01:22:04,213 --> 01:22:08,081
Bruce, are you listening?

730
01:22:12,588 --> 01:22:16,490
Five for you.
Do you want another drink?

731
01:22:17,794 --> 01:22:19,523
Play.

732
01:22:22,999 --> 01:22:26,491
Why can't we be friends?

733
01:22:28,037 --> 01:22:31,200
Being with you is beyond
my worst nightmare.

734
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:36,444
Well, that's too bad.

735
01:22:44,153 --> 01:22:46,644
If we're here to work, let's work.

736
01:22:49,025 --> 01:22:50,959
I want to play cards.

737
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:55,864
Where'd you hide the bodies, Hale?

738
01:23:00,603 --> 01:23:03,470
There were no bodies afterwards,
actually.

739
01:23:07,777 --> 01:23:10,678
The Carrols wanted more garden,
you see.

740
01:23:10,747 --> 01:23:13,944
The pool was being filled in.

741
01:23:14,016 --> 01:23:15,950
So...

742
01:23:16,018 --> 01:23:18,782
that's where I left them.

743
01:23:19,956 --> 01:23:22,015
To grow.

744
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:31,523
I'll raise you 20, and I'll take one.

745
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,674
Bruce, is something wrong?

746
01:23:41,778 --> 01:23:43,973
- What is it?
- I've gotta get some air.

747
01:23:47,884 --> 01:23:49,818
Too much for you, Bruce?

748
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,754
Too much for you.

749
01:23:55,425 --> 01:23:57,689
Too much for you, Bruce?

750
01:24:01,831 --> 01:24:05,699
Well, I win...

751
01:24:05,768 --> 01:24:07,235
'cause you quit.

752
01:24:08,471 --> 01:24:12,202
<i>I remember them all, every detail...</i>

753
01:24:12,275 --> 01:24:13,902
<i>perfectly.</i>

754
01:24:13,976 --> 01:24:17,935
<i>Every breath, every season.</i>

755
01:24:18,014 --> 01:24:19,948
<i>It began with the Winter girl.</i>

756
01:24:20,016 --> 01:24:24,544
Then the next one was...

757
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:27,020
this Belgian girl.

758
01:24:27,089 --> 01:24:29,751
That was tenth grade.

759
01:24:29,826 --> 01:24:32,260
And that was rough.

760
01:24:32,328 --> 01:24:36,196
How about you?
You like them, don't you?

761
01:24:40,703 --> 01:24:42,637
You're not talking?

762
01:24:44,207 --> 01:24:46,141
You're not talking?

763
01:24:47,743 --> 01:24:49,540
Well, I hated her.

764
01:24:49,612 --> 01:24:52,740
She was a nightmare.

765
01:24:52,815 --> 01:24:54,476
She wasn't the last.

766
01:24:58,754 --> 01:25:00,779
<i>There were others.</i>

767
01:25:00,857 --> 01:25:03,985
<i>Always others.</i>

768
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:05,994
<i>Always, Bruce.</i>

769
01:25:07,497 --> 01:25:08,930
<i>Always.</i>

770
01:25:19,742 --> 01:25:22,404
Where have you been?
We have work to do.

771
01:25:22,478 --> 01:25:25,242
- I don't want to know about it.
- What are you talking about?

772
01:25:25,314 --> 01:25:27,646
- We have to get this down.
- I said I don't wanna know.

773
01:25:27,717 --> 01:25:29,651
We have to get this down.

774
01:25:29,719 --> 01:25:31,653
You're drunk, aren't you?

775
01:25:31,721 --> 01:25:34,690
I said I don't wanna know about it.
Do you understand me?

776
01:25:34,757 --> 01:25:36,884
I don't wanna know about it!

777
01:25:36,959 --> 01:25:40,725
- Don't holler at me!
- I don't wanna know about it!

778
01:25:42,732 --> 01:25:45,530
Don't holler at me.
I never did anything to you.

779
01:25:50,706 --> 01:25:53,937
I never did anything to you.
And I'm gonna tell you all about it.

780
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:58,344
I don't want to hear another
fucking word from you.

781
01:25:58,414 --> 01:26:01,076
All right? Nothing!

782
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:03,141
Nothing!

783
01:26:03,219 --> 01:26:04,846
- Okay.
- Nothing!

784
01:26:09,358 --> 01:26:10,916
I can't help it!

785
01:26:12,094 --> 01:26:14,722
Don't you see it's a disease?

786
01:26:14,797 --> 01:26:17,231
I'm like an alcoholic.
One's not enough. Two?

787
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:18,858
Two, three?

788
01:26:18,935 --> 01:26:21,130
I'm normal, Bruce.
I'm normal. I'm just like you.

789
01:26:21,203 --> 01:26:25,469
Stop this. Now, stop this.
Let's do the story.

790
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:28,840
Get off me, you fucking maniac!
Get off of me!

791
01:26:28,911 --> 01:26:34,372
Now, listen to me.
I am trying to talk to you. Shut up!

792
01:26:34,450 --> 01:26:35,883
Now, shut up!

793
01:26:43,793 --> 01:26:46,023
Now we're one.

794
01:26:46,095 --> 01:26:48,461
Don't you see we're one?

795
01:26:48,531 --> 01:26:51,159
Without me, you're nothing.

796
01:26:52,468 --> 01:26:54,732
And without you, I'm alone.

797
01:26:57,306 --> 01:26:59,399
Kill me.

798
01:27:00,509 --> 01:27:03,239
- I'd rather die.
- Oh, yeah?

799
01:27:04,714 --> 01:27:08,081
I'd rather die than go on with this.

800
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:10,084
I'd rather die.

801
01:27:12,121 --> 01:27:13,554
Go ahead.

802
01:27:15,024 --> 01:27:16,457
Go ahead.

803
01:27:32,475 --> 01:27:35,171
Money...

804
01:27:35,244 --> 01:27:36,836
power...

805
01:27:36,912 --> 01:27:38,345
fame?

806
01:27:45,221 --> 01:27:47,519
You're gonna burn, Hale.

807
01:27:52,028 --> 01:27:53,962
You're gonna burn.

808
01:28:36,706 --> 01:28:38,139
Where's Clifton?

809
01:28:48,184 --> 01:28:50,379
- What's going on? You find anything?
- Not yet.

810
01:28:50,453 --> 01:28:53,286
You've gotta be kidding me.
I've been here for six hours!

811
01:28:53,355 --> 01:28:55,289
We're doin' the best we can.

812
01:28:55,357 --> 01:28:57,018
Been diggin' in the pool?

813
01:28:57,093 --> 01:28:59,357
- I got men working up there right now.
- Show me.

814
01:29:16,378 --> 01:29:18,608
You gotta be kiddin' me.
This is all you dug up?

815
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:22,316
It's clean.
There's nothin' here, buddy.

816
01:29:22,384 --> 01:29:26,081
- Bullshit.
- I was on this case for six years.

817
01:29:26,155 --> 01:29:29,454
Never did make sense.
All that blood and no bodies.

818
01:29:29,525 --> 01:29:31,516
I'm telling you the bones--
The bones are down there.

819
01:29:31,594 --> 01:29:35,394
- There are no bones--
- I'll do it myself. Get outta the way.

820
01:29:35,464 --> 01:29:37,295
- He's a phony.
- Move.

821
01:29:37,366 --> 01:29:40,028
Damned if I know why he picked on you.

822
01:29:40,102 --> 01:29:43,003
Maybe he needed his five minutes
of celebrity, you being a writer.

823
01:29:43,072 --> 01:29:45,006
They love to get in the papers,
that kind.

824
01:29:45,074 --> 01:29:47,065
- I want you to get a bulldozer.
- I'm not--

825
01:29:47,143 --> 01:29:49,338
And I want you to come in here,
and I want you to dig.

826
01:29:49,411 --> 01:29:52,903
And dig deep,
till you find those bones...

827
01:29:52,982 --> 01:29:55,382
'cause I'm telling you
that they're down here.

828
01:29:55,451 --> 01:29:57,885
- They're not down there.
- They're down here.

829
01:29:57,953 --> 01:30:00,114
Come on. Come out. Give it up.

830
01:30:04,326 --> 01:30:08,729
All right.
I'm gonna show you something.

831
01:30:08,798 --> 01:30:11,767
Come on with me.
You come with me.

832
01:30:16,472 --> 01:30:19,032
Come here for a second.

833
01:30:19,108 --> 01:30:23,169
I'll show you right now. It's
right here. I got it right in my notes.

834
01:30:23,245 --> 01:30:25,770
Right in my notes.
You wait right there, Clifton.

835
01:30:27,116 --> 01:30:30,051
Here we go. Okay.

836
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:31,552
Here it is.

837
01:30:33,322 --> 01:30:36,621
Every single word of this is true.

838
01:30:37,493 --> 01:30:40,587
This is what he said, okay?

839
01:30:40,663 --> 01:30:42,631
"He must have watched them.

840
01:30:42,698 --> 01:30:46,190
They were unaware of him,
that perfect urban household.

841
01:30:46,268 --> 01:30:49,032
Perfect couple and their kids.

842
01:30:49,104 --> 01:30:51,163
And him watching...

843
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:54,676
like the angel of sorrow."

844
01:30:54,743 --> 01:30:56,802
The angel of sorrow, Clifton.

845
01:30:56,879 --> 01:31:00,906
And this, I found this
the first day that I came here.

846
01:31:00,983 --> 01:31:04,475
I found it. It was on top of the pool.
It's Jennifer Carrol's.

847
01:31:04,553 --> 01:31:06,487
- We've heard this all before.
- I put it--

848
01:31:06,555 --> 01:31:08,147
Did you hear it? You?

849
01:31:08,224 --> 01:31:10,385
- This was on top--
- You? You hear it?

850
01:31:14,997 --> 01:31:16,897
You don't believe me.

851
01:31:16,966 --> 01:31:19,560
We've heard that story before,
Mr. Simmons.

852
01:31:19,635 --> 01:31:21,569
The bones are there.
I'm telling you.

853
01:31:21,637 --> 01:31:24,037
There are no bones!
That's bullshit.

854
01:31:24,106 --> 01:31:26,438
- Because you're not digging deep enough!
- We did dig deep enough.

855
01:31:26,508 --> 01:31:28,533
That's it. The show's over.
Let's go.

856
01:31:28,611 --> 01:31:32,445
Clifton! You're not diggin'
deep enough.

857
01:31:32,514 --> 01:31:34,448
Have a nice day.

858
01:31:35,918 --> 01:31:39,183
You're not digging deep enough, Clifton!

859
01:31:45,094 --> 01:31:48,154
The bones. The bones are there.

860
01:33:25,227 --> 01:33:28,094
<i>I killed them, Bruce.</i>
<i>I killed them and many others.</i>

861
01:33:28,163 --> 01:33:31,894
<i>Many perfect families,</i>
<i>just like yours.</i>

862
01:33:31,967 --> 01:33:35,095
<i>How far is it to your sister's house?</i>

863
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:37,604
<i>How far is it to the desert?</i>

864
01:33:47,116 --> 01:33:49,880
Help!

865
01:35:28,350 --> 01:35:29,783
Heather.

866
01:35:33,822 --> 01:35:35,255
Heather?

867
01:35:56,378 --> 01:36:00,280
- What the hell you doing here?
- You're okay.

868
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:07,211
You all right?

869
01:36:07,289 --> 01:36:09,757
- Where are the kids?
- They're inside taking a nap.

870
01:36:09,825 --> 01:36:12,157
- What happened to your head?
- I'm fine.

871
01:36:12,227 --> 01:36:14,889
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Sit down. Come over here.

872
01:36:14,963 --> 01:36:17,796
Everything's gonna be fine.

873
01:36:17,866 --> 01:36:19,834
Come on.
Let me get you some water.

874
01:36:21,203 --> 01:36:22,670
Are you in trouble?

875
01:36:22,738 --> 01:36:26,606
No, no. I'm fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.

876
01:36:26,675 --> 01:36:28,870
- Here, buddy.
- Thank you.

877
01:36:30,279 --> 01:36:33,248
This friend of yours stopped by.
Some guy named Eddie?

878
01:36:33,315 --> 01:36:36,113
He said happy belated birthday.
He left this for you.

879
01:36:41,523 --> 01:36:44,219
I forgot your birthday too.

880
01:36:44,293 --> 01:36:45,885
Happy birthday.

881
01:36:51,934 --> 01:36:54,664
- What is it?
- It's a Bible.

882
01:37:00,042 --> 01:37:01,475
Strange.

883
01:37:05,581 --> 01:37:08,573
Come on. Let's go inside
and get this cleaned up.

884
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:11,380
Come on, Bruce. Come on, bud.

885
01:37:48,123 --> 01:37:50,956
<i>You don't know what you're feeling,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

886
01:37:51,026 --> 01:37:53,187
<i>You can't even think, can you?</i>

887
01:37:54,363 --> 01:37:57,423
<i>Yes, I was there, Bruce.</i>
<i>I watched them.</i>

888
01:37:57,499 --> 01:38:02,732
<i>You've no idea how much</i>
<i>I wanted to hurt them, to kill them.</i>

889
01:38:02,804 --> 01:38:06,205
<i>No idea.</i>
<i>No idea what it's like...</i>

890
01:38:06,275 --> 01:38:09,836
<i>to finger the saliva</i>
<i>and wet your hands in blood.</i>

891
01:38:09,911 --> 01:38:14,177
<i>To strangle and cut.</i>

892
01:38:14,249 --> 01:38:17,741
<i>And the ground you bury them under,</i>
<i>it becomes sacred.</i>

893
01:38:20,589 --> 01:38:22,682
<i>You relive their last screams...</i>

894
01:38:22,758 --> 01:38:24,783
<i>their pleas for mercy...</i>

895
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:27,226
<i>their pathetic whimpers...</i>

896
01:38:27,296 --> 01:38:30,663
<i>because you are the last one there.</i>

897
01:38:30,732 --> 01:38:35,032
<i>And then, then it begins again.</i>

898
01:38:36,938 --> 01:38:39,702
<i>The trolling...</i>

899
01:38:39,775 --> 01:38:41,709
<i>the stalking.</i>

900
01:38:42,778 --> 01:38:44,746
<i>And once I've identified them...</i>

901
01:38:44,813 --> 01:38:48,249
<i>once I've memorized their schedules</i>
<i>and habits...</i>

902
01:38:48,317 --> 01:38:50,251
<i>they're mine.</i>

903
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,454
<i>I possess them.</i>

904
01:38:53,522 --> 01:38:56,685
<i>I possess them, just like</i>
<i>I possessed you for a while.</i>

905
01:38:58,794 --> 01:39:02,787
<i>You see, Bruce, it's like a door.</i>

906
01:39:03,865 --> 01:39:05,799
<i>A door between two realities.</i>

907
01:39:06,902 --> 01:39:09,564
<i>Good and evil.</i>

908
01:39:12,774 --> 01:39:15,299
<i>I cross over into the side</i>
<i>of darkness.</i>

909
01:39:15,377 --> 01:39:19,404
<i>I become the angel of sorrow...</i>

910
01:39:20,482 --> 01:39:21,915
<i>like we wrote.</i>

911
01:39:23,318 --> 01:39:24,751
<i>And Bruce...</i>

912
01:39:26,855 --> 01:39:28,447
<i>you'll never catch me.</i>

913
01:39:31,226 --> 01:39:33,160
<i>You'll never catch me...</i>

914
01:39:35,197 --> 01:39:37,131
<i>until God...</i>

915
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,334
<i>shows his face.</i>

916
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:45,472
<i>Until God shows his face.</i>

917
01:39:56,051 --> 01:40:00,181
<i>I had seen the face of evil.</i>

918
01:40:02,624 --> 01:40:04,751
<i>As for the face of God...</i>

919
01:40:08,029 --> 01:40:10,122
<i>I think I caught a glimpse...</i>

920
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,934
<i>just in time.</i>
