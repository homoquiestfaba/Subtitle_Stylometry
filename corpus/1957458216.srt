Why are you still here?

177
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:59,735
When you ran back in,
you dragged me with you.

178
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:01,103
- I did?
- Yeah.

179
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:04,373
You dragged me by the hair.

180
00:08:07,176 --> 00:08:08,011
So what?

181
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:09,813
It hurt.

182
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:14,718
You're alive, be grateful.

183
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:21,925
You don't remember me, do you?

184
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,529
From before all of this?

185
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:28,132
Anyway, your friend,
he's definitely alive.

186
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,202
Saw his face when
he hit the floor.

187
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:33,404
He was in pain, but alive.

188
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:37,208
I felt helpless.

189
00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:39,177
Helpless?

190
00:08:40,112 --> 00:08:41,246
You are helpless.

191
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,081
What are you, 12?

192
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:45,517
- I'm 16.
- What's a 16 year old doing

193
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:46,385
in a bank?

194
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:50,422
You gonna let me go?

195
00:08:53,392 --> 00:08:56,262
I promise I won't tell
the police your real name.

196
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:58,364
You don't know my name.

197
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:02,001
Yeah, you're right, I don't.

198
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:07,640
How do you know my name?

199
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:08,474
I don't.

200
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:10,009
Don't lie to me.

201
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:12,279
I just made that up.

202
00:09:12,313 --> 00:09:13,814
You said you knew
my name, tell me how.

203
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:16,350
I don't know
anything, I promise.

204
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:19,688
[phone ringing]

205
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,689
Yeah?

206
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:21,522
[Lisa] He's alive.

207
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:22,723
You 100% sure.

208
00:09:22,756 --> 00:09:24,291
[Lisa] Yes, but
it's not looking good.

209
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:26,026
Listen, I need
a way out of this.

210
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,261
[Lisa] Out of?

211
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:28,363
The bank.

212
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:29,631
What else?

213
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:30,899
[Lisa] Why don't
you call God back?

214
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:33,501
- What?
- Listen, I can't help you.

215
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:34,704
I just saw on the news.

216
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:35,671
You're surrounded,
you're fucked.

217
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:37,973
You gave me your number.

218
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:39,541
You said you fixed shit, Lisa.

219
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:41,910
You said anything
go wrong, call me.

220
00:09:41,943 --> 00:09:43,512
[Lisa] Okay, let me
just come down there

221
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:45,147
and dig you a tunnel.

222
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:47,550
Can you at least go
to the fuckin' hospital

223
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,618
to see if he pulls through?

224
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:49,485
Fuck no, fuck no.

225
00:09:49,518 --> 00:09:50,319
Come on.

226
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:51,320
You crazy?

227
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:52,855
- Fuck no.
- Please.

228
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:57,493
- [Lisa] I want my cut.
- A cut of zero?

229
00:09:57,526 --> 00:10:00,197
- [Lisa] Bye Felicia.
- Hold up!

230
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:06,903
If I make it out of this, there
may be some loot involved.

231
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:09,106
That's a big fuckin' if.

232
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:12,409
I got a hostage.

233
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:15,345
A girl.

234
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:17,815
[Lisa] Really?

235
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,584
I want 10 percent.

236
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:21,019
For going to the hospital?

237
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:22,153
[Lisa] Damn right.

238
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:24,422
- Fuck that.
- Okay, bye!

239
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:25,290
Hold up.

240
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,593
Fine.

241
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:32,798
How are you going to
pay her with no money?

242
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,133
What?

243
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,067
I've got money.

244
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,402
No, you left the money outside

245
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,505
when you dragged me in here.

246
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:43,409
I mean you could always
rob the bank again.

247
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,611
I think I see some money
on the floor inside

248
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,414
that area over there.

249
00:10:48,783 --> 00:10:53,520
But if you leave this
office, they might shoot you.

250
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:56,791
I think they got
snipers out there too.

251
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,293
You gonna kill me?

252
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,795
That's his blood, not yours.

253
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:49,312
Stop?

254
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:55,820
[heavy breathing]

255
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:12,270
Oh fuck, fuck,

256
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:15,907
why'd they fuckin' do that?

257
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:21,479
[heavy breathing]

258
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:31,023
[phone ringing]

259
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:38,631
[Man] Mr. You, hey bud,

260
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:40,934
listen, I gotta apologise.

261
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:42,436
I was a little rough
on you earlier.

262
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:45,773
And I got this toxic
masculine something

263
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,307
that my therapist is on about.

264
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,844
Wife says I'm just too
fuckin' aggressive,

265
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:51,445
but you wanna know the bullshit?

266
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,881
My daughter, she
fuckin' loves it.

267
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:54,816
Are you kiddin'?

268
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:55,751
She goes out to the playground,

269
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:56,685
she's like, don't mess with me,

270
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:58,519
my dad will go God mode on you.

271
00:12:58,553 --> 00:12:59,987
[laughing]

272
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:02,423
The best, you got kids, man?

273
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:03,658
Or wait no, I guess
you probably don't.

274
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:04,625
You're too young, right?

275
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,327
What are you, like 25, 26, 28?

276
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,628
Something like that?

277
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,397
I spent all day talking
to your god damn friend.

278
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,998
I don't know you yet.

279
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:13,870
I mean, that guy was, you know,

280
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:17,005
I was about to say I liked
him, but I don't know why

281
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,540
I would say that, I
fuckin' hated him.

282
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:20,008
He was an asshole.

283
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:23,545
Anybody who kidnaps 12 people
is an asshole, all right?

284
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,648
But I want us to get to
know each other asshole.

285
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:28,384
I am Aaron.

286
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:29,986
I am your crisis negotiator.

287
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,690
I'm not like those guys out
there that shot your friend.

288
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:34,023
They spend all
day holding a gun.

289
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:35,425
They get all itchy.

290
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,794
They want to shoot
something and then go home

291
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:38,796
and fuck their wives
missionary style.

292
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:40,163
I am the talker.

293
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:43,935
I'm the one who's your
friend here, okay?

294
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:45,402
I'm not your friend.

295
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:47,104
Sorry, what was that?

296
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:49,106
I said I'm not your friend.

297
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,108
All right, fair,
you know what?

298
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:53,544
That's still progress,
we're communicating now.

299
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:56,080
All right, so how old are you?

300
00:13:59,116 --> 00:14:00,820
C'mon man, this is
not communicating.

301
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:01,787
You're not answering me.

302
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:02,722
You got to give me something.

303
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:03,890
What's your favourite colour?

304
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:05,123
What's your favourite
day of the week?

305
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:06,525
Do you like a reach
around in the shower?

306
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:07,392
The fuck?

307
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,732
You know, I don't have time for this.
You got 10 minutes.

308
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,165
You got fuckin' 10
minutes before I sick

309
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:15,635
these god damn wild
animals in there

310
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:17,838
and they shoot you dead, just
like your fuckin' friend.

311
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:20,139
- So end this shit.
- If he dies, I'm gonna kill her.

312
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:21,808
[Aaron] We can go home.

313
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:22,675
Her?

314
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:26,013
What do you mean her?

315
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:29,315
What her are you
talkin' about here, bud?

316
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:30,751
Is there a girl
in there with you?

317
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:33,120
Nah, that can't be right,
we did a headcount.

318
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:34,087
Will you answer my
fuckin' question?

319
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:36,390
How old is your daughter?

320
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:39,727
[Aaron] She's 14.

321
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:42,462
Girl in here ain't much older.

322
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:49,103
If he dies, I'm
going to kill her.

323
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:59,180
[upbeat music]
[dog barking]

324
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:02,317
[muffled radio]

325
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:07,791
Why'd you always leave?

326
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,893
All things come to an end.

327
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,027
Right.

328
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:11,895
You sad?

329
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:14,864
No.

330
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:19,770
Don't look at my ass
when I get my clothes.

331
00:15:30,748 --> 00:15:33,183
What's up with the picture?

332
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:38,556
That is a '70 to '75 BMW CSL.

333
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:44,763
Launched the M brand, vintage.

334
00:15:44,796 --> 00:15:46,297
Set you back 135K.

335
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:50,534
I'm saving up, gonna get one.

336
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:53,338
How's that going for you,

337
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:55,507
considering you just got fired?

338
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,409
How do you get sacked
from a fuckin' car garage?

339
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:58,845
I had that job for you.

340
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:01,114
Asshole called
me stupid, I don't.

341
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:02,147
Calm down.

342
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:06,284
I've got a couple G's saved.

343
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:09,155
Oh, only another
133,000 to go.

344
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:22,836
You know, you're in violation
of your parole right?

345
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,105
Cause I'm fuckin' you?

346
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:26,306
Because you have no job.

347
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:30,912
Can't you just pretend
that I do have a job?

348
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:33,014
- I know a guy.
- A guy?

349
00:16:33,048 --> 00:16:36,051
A guy, needs a fourth man.

350
00:16:36,084 --> 00:16:37,317
Collection?

351
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:38,519
Collection.

352
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:41,090
What collection
job needs four men?

353
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:41,957
Robbery.

354

00:35:03,694 --> 00:35:04,628
- No.
- You don't fuck

709
00:35:04,661 --> 00:35:05,830
with Face-Off?

710
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:08,398
You don't with some
Bad Lieutenant?

711
00:35:08,432 --> 00:35:10,235
What the fuck are
you talking about?

712
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:12,203
You're talking about two
different fuckin' things here.

713
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,503
How is that even the same thing?

714
00:35:13,537 --> 00:35:14,973
It's chalk and cheese.

715
00:35:15,006 --> 00:35:16,908
- What?
- I come to you with prime,

716
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:18,878
prime fuckin' rib
and I say to you,

717
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,478
show me what you got
and what do you do?

718
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:22,147
You bring me fuckin' fast food.

719
00:35:22,181 --> 00:35:23,481
You show me fuckin'
burgers, man.

720
00:35:23,514 --> 00:35:25,717
Fries, fuckin' milkshake.

721
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,853
What the fuck is
he talking about?

722
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:29,788
Wait, Nath, back me up,

723
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,792
Nath, back me the
fuck up, come on.

724
00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:35,394
- I mean.
- Come on.

725
00:35:38,064 --> 00:35:39,766
I fuck with some Nic Cage.

726
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:40,733
Dude, thank you.

727
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:42,068
For sure, he talented.

728
00:35:42,102 --> 00:35:43,636
Get the fuck outta
here, talented?

729
00:35:43,669 --> 00:35:45,238
What the fuck are you?

730
00:35:45,272 --> 00:35:49,541
However, however, I must
contest with you Stally,

731
00:35:50,644 --> 00:35:52,712
and I show you
fair favour for it.

732
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:56,483
He indeed, humbly
served your platter,

733
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:58,352
some steak and yo ass,

734
00:35:59,854 --> 00:36:04,158
ungrateful repost delivered
this nigga chicken nuggets

735
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:08,230
and mozzarella dips
and all kind of shit.

736
00:36:08,263 --> 00:36:11,133
Now, if you going
to go Nick Cage,

737
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,835
and may I add so fuckin' boldly,

738
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:17,940
go Raisin' Arizona,
go Lord of War.

739
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:20,641
Shit even go Joe,

740
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:24,781
you go Leavin' Las Vegas.

741
00:36:24,814 --> 00:36:26,581
Well fuckin' done.

742
00:36:26,615 --> 00:36:28,184
But by the law of Hades,

743
00:36:28,217 --> 00:36:30,186
how the fuck you
gonna go Face Off?

744
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:31,921
- No, no, no, no.
- Well fuck you sir.

745
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:33,689
Face Off is a classic film.

746
00:36:33,722 --> 00:36:35,258
You know what,
fuck both of you.

747
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:36,458
It's not even a film.

748
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:38,594
Okay, so then what the fuck is it?
A telenovela?

749
00:36:38,628 --> 00:36:40,763
[laughing]

750
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:45,803
There's a distinct difference
between a movie and a film.

751
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:47,704
What?

752
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:49,173
See even the fuckin'
new guy's chimin' in.

753
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:50,441
Yeah, you ask him.

754
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:52,508
What the fuck are
you talking about?

755
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,745
Name me the best
films ever, go.

756
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,781
- Shawshank.
- Godfather.

757
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,483
- Scarface.
- Scarface?

758
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:03,355
New guy's fuckin'
killin' me over here,

759
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,223
I'm agreeing though, Scarface.

760
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,325
I mean, seriously, seriously.

761
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,160
Get the fuck out.

762
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:10,729
There's the door, go on.

763
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,398
We'll forget that
one, all right?

764
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:13,366
Yeah, all right.

765
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:15,234
I mean, Fred here,

766
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:17,803
seems like things a
little less than perfect.

767
00:37:17,837 --> 00:37:18,636
You know?

768
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,006
I mean his girl.

769
00:37:21,774 --> 00:37:23,009
What you gonna
do about it, Fred?

770
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:25,979
All right, move the
fuck on, now, quickly.

771
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:28,514
Finish your fuckin'
film movie nonsense.

772
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:29,682
Yes, professor.

773
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,218
Why don't you talk?

774
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:34,154
Hey, he given you one of his
rousing fuckin' speeches yet?

775
00:37:34,187 --> 00:37:36,423
No, you're gonna
fuckin' love this.

776
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:39,459
Marcus Anthony and Caesar's
funeral every fuckin' time.

777
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:40,827
Go ahead.

778
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:42,529
[clearing throat]

779
00:37:42,562 --> 00:37:45,066
Friends, niggas, countrymen.

780
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:49,370
Lend me your motherfucking ears.

781
00:37:49,404 --> 00:37:53,808
The best films ever,
Shawshank, Godfather, Scarface.

782
00:37:56,277 --> 00:37:57,278
Thank you!

783
00:37:58,414 --> 00:38:00,382
They all have
something in common.

784
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,250
Anyone?

785
00:38:08,257 --> 00:38:09,091
Realism.

786
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:14,264
They're all settled in
a measure of realism.

787
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:18,802
Now, of course, there are some
peculiarities to these rules,

788
00:38:18,835 --> 00:38:21,737
Pulp Fiction borderline
being a movie.

789
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,773
It's very referential.

790
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:28,411
And the thing, that, seriously,
almost fucking tips it,

791
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:32,016
Mia Wallace 'don't be a
square' scene, oh my god.

792
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:33,484
I love that scene.

793
00:38:33,517 --> 00:38:36,053
Near fourth wall-breaking
and spends too much time

794
00:38:36,087 --> 00:38:38,688
tryna' be French New Wave.

795
00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:42,393
Now Star Wars, Harry
fucking Potter, movies.

796
00:38:46,031 --> 00:38:49,534
Back to the Future,
other such relatedness.

797
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:52,871
Now personally, I prefer film.

798
00:38:52,904 --> 00:38:56,640
If I had to walk around in
a movie world all my life,

799
00:38:56,674 --> 00:38:59,077
well, I'd rather die.

800
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:03,015
Now my heart is in the
coffin there with truth.

801
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:08,454
And I must wait until
it returns to me.

802
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:15,128
So basically,
sci-fi ain't film?

803
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:20,100
Is that what this nigga
got from what I just said?

804
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:23,303
Oh my days, for the
welfare of lucidity,

805
00:39:23,337 --> 00:39:25,105
sci-fi can be film.

806
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:27,808
Perfect example, Twelve Monkeys.

807
00:39:28,674 --> 00:39:29,843
I'm fuckin' confused.

808
00:39:29,877 --> 00:39:31,078
Oh my God.

809
00:39:31,111 --> 00:39:33,547
- No I'm gettin' it.
- It doesn't make no fuckin' sense.

810
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,283
Jaws, Jaws?

811
00:39:35,316 --> 00:39:36,750
Film.

812
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:38,820
- Jurassic park?
- Film.

813
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:41,322
- Sunset Boulevard.
- All right, film.

814
00:39:41,356 --> 00:39:42,524
Minority Report.

815
00:39:42,557 --> 00:39:44,092
All right, all right,
do you wanna get off

816
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,561
Spielberg's dick
for a minute, Jesus.

817
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:47,595
Listen Nath.

818
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:50,665
This plan, robbin' a bank,

819
00:39:53,735 --> 00:39:56,105
you know that's mad, right?

820
00:39:56,138 --> 00:39:58,641
- Nah, it's fuckin'.
- You too?

821
00:39:59,842 --> 00:40:02,278
Come on man, it's a
fuckin' bank, all right?

822
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:03,479
Think about it.

823
00:40:03,512 --> 00:40:05,047
In four weeks, with
no fuckin' plan,

824
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,983
how the fuck are we
even gonna do it?

825
00:40:07,017 --> 00:40:08,185
There's no money
in banks anymore.

826
00:40:08,218 --> 00:40:09,619
It's all digital.

827
00:40:10,554 --> 00:40:12,122
Not with this bank.

828
00:40:12,155 --> 00:40:14,157
Three to four hundred K.

829
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:17,794
Yeah, because
it's a police bank.

830
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:18,694
[groaning]

831
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:19,829
Pension's, all that.

832
00:40:19,863 --> 00:40:21,264
- I know, I did my research.
- Police bank,

833
00:40:21,298 --> 00:40:22,366
what the fuck is
he talkin' about?

834
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,301
This is suicide.

835
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:24,569
The rookie as well, like mate.

836
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:26,703
Hey, I need new
blood, all right.

837
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:29,574
Pencil is doin' a
stint, Chris is,

838
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:33,377
I mean, we can't trust Chris.

839
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,746
After that last job.

840
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,185
Something went wrong,
he seemed culpable,

841
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:42,321
he might be on that bake.

842
00:40:43,754 --> 00:40:45,424
You know, my money's on
Saida for that last job

843
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:46,792
and it's downfalls anyway.

844
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:50,429
Listen, here's the
translucent condition,

845
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:55,134
I'm doin' this job, even
if me and tenderfoot here

846
00:40:55,168 --> 00:40:56,669
have to go in alone.

847
00:40:56,703 --> 00:40:58,605
If you guys want me
to step out, I can.

848
00:40:58,638 --> 00:40:59,939
Shut the fuck up.

849
00:40:59,973 --> 00:41:01,474
The fuck you talkin' about.

850
00:41:01,507 --> 00:41:03,176
Don't speak another fuckin'
word, you hard-rock right now.

851
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:04,611
It's fuckin'
suicide all right,

852
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:06,112
it's fuckin' suicide.

853
00:41:06,145 --> 00:41:08,581
Just think about it man,
use your fuckin' head, huh?

854
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:10,517
You wanna fuckin' die?

855
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,752
Fuck the piglets.

856
00:41:12,786 --> 00:41:15,155
Here we shall take our stand.

857
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,259
We rob their asses.

858
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:21,028
I want out, being
a whippin' boy.

859
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,298
You know the rules.

860
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:29,571
What we do is strictly
business, it's never personal.

861
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:33,308
But this, I can't
commit to this.

862
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:38,013
Look I'm sorry, mate, all right?

863
00:41:38,046 --> 00:41:40,649
[upbeat music]

864
00:41:56,499 --> 00:41:57,333
I'm in.

865
00:42:03,573 --> 00:42:06,777
Just like that,
the Beatles break up.

866
00:42:08,712 --> 00:42:11,348
Nah, this ain't the end, mate.

867
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,260
It's all right, don't worry,

868
00:42:22,293 --> 00:42:26,531
alone I left the womb, so
same I'll enter the tomb.

869
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:30,636
[soft music]

870
00:42:46,586 --> 00:42:49,255
[phone ringing]

871
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:53,560
Hey, it's me.

872
00:42:55,061 --> 00:42:57,163
What do you mean, who me?

873
00:42:58,398 --> 00:43:02,103
Oh, right, yeah,
I'm sure you were.

874
00:43:02,136 --> 00:43:02,970
Oh really?

875
00:43:03,871 --> 00:43:05,539
Yeah, I bet you are.

876
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:13,114
[dramatic eerie music]

877
00:43:30,465 --> 00:43:32,634
[banging]

878
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:41,110
Jane Perkins, right?

879
00:43:42,478 --> 00:43:44,815
Listen, there's
a gun in my drawer.

880
00:43:44,848 --> 00:43:47,984
It's a 357 magnum, five bullets.

881
00:43:48,017 --> 00:43:49,686
You need to take
it and shoot him,

882
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,889
don't even think twice about it.

883
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:52,891
I can't shoot him.

884
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:54,091
Why not?

885
00:43:54,124 --> 00:43:55,559
Have you ever
shot anyone before?

886
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:58,028
Besides, you're a
mortgage broker so,

887
00:43:58,061 --> 00:43:59,898
why do you even have a
gun in the first place?

888
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,565
This is a highly secured bank.

889
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:03,300
Even the mortgage brokers?

890
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:05,603
He wants to kill you.

891
00:44:05,637 --> 00:44:06,806
Why would he wanna kill me?

892
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,208
Because he's fuckin'
black, that's why.

893
00:44:11,576 --> 00:44:13,344
He'll die and take
you down with him,

894
00:44:13,378 --> 00:44:15,613
he's crazy, he'll kill you.

895
00:44:17,015 --> 00:44:18,283
And you?

896
00:44:18,316 --> 00:44:19,651
No, cause you're
not gonna tell him

897
00:44:19,684 --> 00:44:22,021
that I'm in the bathroom.

898
00:44:22,054 --> 00:44:26,325
He's coming, just get the
gun and fuckin' kill him.

899
00:44:30,563 --> 00:44:32,465
Mhm, yeah, mhm.

of life, you got it.

Oh, thank god, I didn't,

to get you out of here.

I just found out

928
00:45:34,497 --> 00:45:37,500
that my daughter is actually
a fan of yours, all right.

929
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,335
Now do you have a family
member that you want us

931
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,273
No.

932
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,975
[Aaron] Okay, well
I need to promise.

933
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:44,876
- Okay.
- No.

934
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:45,877

you are, Madison Jones.

Are we doing scene two?

[Man] What's it say on
the side, Madison Jones?

945
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:13,874
Scene two.

946
00:46:13,907 --> 00:46:15,241
[Man] So what
are we doing here?

947
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:18,477
Top of scene two, let's
go, Madison Jones.

948
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:27,153
When they asked
me if I saw him,

949
00:46:27,186 --> 00:46:29,690
I told them no, not in awhile.

950
00:46:31,258 --> 00:46:34,963
I said that with such an
assuredness, like it meant nothing.

951
00:46:34,996 --> 00:46:37,832
The night before, he
stumbled back into our house,

952
00:46:37,865 --> 00:46:40,068
same as always,
cocky, complacent,

953
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,501
as if he belonged there.

954
00:46:41,535 --> 00:46:45,506
Still, his breath wreaking
as the same spirit

955
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,076
he was so fond of.

956
00:46:47,108 --> 00:46:48,743
He kept on telling me
how much he loved me

957
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:50,946
and how he didn't mean
it the last night,

958
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,147
he never means it,
but he does it again,

959
00:46:53,181 --> 00:46:55,617
and again, and again.

960
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,152
When he does, I feel ashamed.

961
00:46:58,186 --> 00:47:00,355
Not because I am a victim

962
00:47:00,388 --> 00:47:05,394
but because I feel intrinsically
obliged to forgive him.

963
00:47:06,595 --> 00:47:08,764
I am ashamed because
I am numb to anger.

964
00:47:12,601 --> 00:47:14,104
I can do it again.

965
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:16,873
[Man] No thanks, Madison.

966
00:47:16,906 --> 00:47:18,174
Thank you.

967
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,676
I can do it again,
I was a little.

with your agent, Madison.

whole thing, by the way,

a chance at this,

1059
00:51:49,462 --> 00:51:52,366
and I'm not talking
about acting,

1060
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,302
I'm talking about life.

1061
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:02,076
I want you to have the
best, you're my girl.

1062
00:52:08,383 --> 00:52:12,921
If anything were to happen
to you, I don't what I'd do.

1063
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,826
Don't ever leave me.

1064
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:23,066
I love you.

1065
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,170
I love you too.

1066
00:52:29,471 --> 00:52:32,308
[heavy breathing]

1067
00:52:46,823 --> 00:52:49,059
[scraping]

1068
00:52:52,429 --> 00:52:54,099
Get off the floor.

1069
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:58,236
Hey, get off the floor.

1070
00:53:00,905 --> 00:53:02,606
It's dirty.

1071
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:05,410
Don't tell me what to do.

1072
00:53:05,443 --> 00:53:08,213
People always tell
me what to do.

1073
00:53:08,246 --> 00:53:09,448
Not anymore.

1074
00:53:09,482 --> 00:53:10,615
That's life.

1075
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:12,918
Get used to it.

1076
00:53:12,952 --> 00:53:15,620
All day long, my
mom, do this, do that.

1077
00:53:15,653 --> 00:53:17,390
My dad, god, fuck him.

1078
00:53:25,765 --> 00:53:29,702
My dad, he used to
preach to me all the time.

1079
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:34,474
He should've been a preacher.

1080
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:40,080
Is that who you were
talking to on the phone?

1081
00:53:40,113 --> 00:53:41,916
- Your mom?
- No.

1082
00:53:41,949 --> 00:53:43,451
Right, who then?

1083
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:47,654
- Does it matter?
- It matters to me.

1084
00:53:47,687 --> 00:53:49,891
- So.
- So that Stockholm Syndrome

1085
00:53:49,924 --> 00:53:51,758
you spoke of.

1086
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:52,960
How 'bout now?

1087
00:53:57,565 --> 00:54:00,402
No one ever listens
to a thing I say.

1088
00:54:00,436 --> 00:54:03,738
My whole life, they
think I'm some simpleton,

1089
00:54:03,771 --> 00:54:05,207
got no voice, that's
what they think.

1090
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,408
Maybe they're right.

1091
00:54:06,442 --> 00:54:07,843
Now look at this mess,
everything's fucked,

1092
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:08,911
fuckin' chaos theory.

1093
00:54:08,944 --> 00:54:11,679
- Not chaos theory.
- No?

1094
00:54:11,712 --> 00:54:14,451
Chaos theory is the
exact opposite of chaos,

1095
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,519
it's the, doesn't matter.

1096
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:30,700
Something is everything and
nothing at the same time.

1097
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:37,875
Something, not everything,
exactly everything

1098
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:39,510
is everything and
nothing at the same time

1099
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:43,547
so your gun, the floor,
this situation, you, me.

1100
00:54:45,217 --> 00:54:47,419
[heavy breathing]

1101
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:49,254
- Sit down.
- This wall.

1102
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:51,289
- Sit down.
- The table.

1103
00:54:51,323 --> 00:54:52,324
Sit down!

1104
00:54:52,357 --> 00:54:53,691
Do you get it?

1105
00:54:56,161 --> 00:54:57,996
- No.
- You can exactly put

1106
00:54:58,029 --> 00:54:59,830
all importance, no
importance into something,

1107
00:54:59,865 --> 00:55:02,869
it's weight, it's value, it's
what you choose it to be.

1108
00:55:02,902 --> 00:55:03,936
- All right.
- You get it.

1109
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:05,271
- Sure.
- Ah, you don't get it.

1110
00:55:05,304 --> 00:55:06,805
I do.

1111
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:08,807
It's some spiritual
vegan bullshit.

1112
00:55:08,841 --> 00:55:10,476
- God, what is your problem?
- What?

1113
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:11,810
I don't what you believe in,

1114
00:55:11,844 --> 00:55:13,179
you have a gun, you
have an attitude,

1115
00:55:13,212 --> 00:55:14,180
- but why either?
- Because.

1116
00:55:14,213 --> 00:55:15,381
Because?

1117
00:55:15,414 --> 00:55:17,317
- Yeah, because.
- So you want chaos?

1118
00:55:17,351 --> 00:55:18,986
Yeah, I want chaos theory.

1119
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:21,754
Ugh, annoying, god, did
you even go to school?

1120
00:55:21,787 --> 00:55:23,490
I did go to school.

1121
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:25,791
Maybe not one as fancy
as yours, but I did.

1122
00:55:25,825 --> 00:55:27,060
I'm not stupid.

1123
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:36,838
What about your dad, hm?

1124
00:55:37,906 --> 00:55:39,340
What about him?

1125
00:55:39,374 --> 00:55:43,444
Is he something and
nothing at the same time?

1126
00:55:43,478 --> 00:55:46,481
Why'd you bring
my dad up for, hm?

1127
00:55:46,514 --> 00:55:48,283
Trying to wind me up?

1128
00:55:49,518 --> 00:55:50,785
Just curious.

1129
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:54,323
So?

1130
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:02,830
My name is Madison
Jones, I'm 16,

1131
00:56:03,966 --> 00:56:06,903
17 next week, these
are my profiles

1132
00:56:10,907 --> 00:56:12,808
and these are my hands.

1133
00:56:14,477 --> 00:56:15,879
I don't get it.

1134
00:56:22,386 --> 00:56:25,456
When they asked
me if I saw him,

1135
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:27,992
I told them no, not in awhile.

1136
00:56:30,928 --> 00:56:34,098
I said that with such
assuredness like,

1137
00:56:34,131 --> 00:56:35,967
like it meant nothing.

1138
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:42,341
The night before, he
stumbled back into our house,

1139
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:46,445
same as always,
cocky, complacent,

1140
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:52,584
as if he belonged.

1141
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,590
Still, his breath wreaking
of the same spirit

1142
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,563
he was so fond of,
he kept on telling me

1143
00:57:03,596 --> 00:57:05,331
how much he loved me.

1144
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:10,604
And how he didn't
mean it that night.

1145
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:12,139
He never means it.

1146
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:17,311
But he does it again,
and again, and again.

1147
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:25,587
When he does, I feel ashamed.

1148
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:28,690
Not because I'm a victim,

1149
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:33,827
but because I feel
intrinsically obliged

1150
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:37,999
to forgive him, I am ashamed

1151
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:43,739
because I am numb to anger.

1152
00:58:07,698 --> 00:58:08,765
How was that?

1153
00:58:13,837 --> 00:58:15,606
It's from a script from a
film I auditioned for about

1154
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,942
a month ago, I
probably didn't get it.

1155
00:58:17,975 --> 00:58:20,912
I thought you said
you were a singer.

1156
00:58:20,945 --> 00:58:21,779
That was,

1157
00:58:25,049 --> 00:58:27,318
good, that was really good.

1158
00:58:30,222 --> 00:58:31,590
You got a talent.

1159
00:58:31,623 --> 00:58:35,994
I wasn't as good as
that in the audition.

1160
00:58:36,028 --> 00:58:37,863
I didn't wanna get it.

1161
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:41,867
I didn't want my
mum to be right.

1162
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,802
Didn't want her to win.

1163
00:58:44,971 --> 00:58:46,473
You won though.

1164
00:58:46,506 --> 00:58:47,674
How?

1165
00:58:47,707 --> 00:58:49,609
Got me off the floor.

1166
00:58:51,044 --> 00:58:51,878
Happy?

1167
00:58:54,714 --> 00:58:56,416
- Where's this car?
- What car?

1168
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,184
I made a demand while
you were in the bathroom

1169
00:58:58,218 --> 00:58:59,786
- on your phone.
- At least I wasn't taking

1170
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:02,490
a shit when you burst in, right?

1171
00:59:03,924 --> 00:59:05,159
You trust them?

1172
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,628
Most likely I
walk out of here,

1173
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:09,663
they shoot or arrest me.

1174
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:13,467
So let me go then.

1175
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:17,272
No, I get it, you
can't let me go.

1176
00:59:22,177 --> 00:59:23,178
You need me.

1177
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,348
So what's the plan?

1178
00:59:27,649 --> 00:59:28,917
I don't know.

1179
00:59:30,786 --> 00:59:33,189
I wish they didn't shoot him.

1180
00:59:34,657 --> 00:59:36,092
He'd have a plan.

1181
00:59:37,226 --> 00:59:40,730
A way out, I was
just working on it.

1182
00:59:40,763 --> 00:59:42,131
Working on it, no,
you're sitting here

1183
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:44,333
crying feeling
sorry for yourself,

1184
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:47,270
I mean, come on man, you've
gotta pull yourself together.

1185
00:59:47,303 --> 00:59:49,173
Have you even looked
at that fire exit door

1186
00:59:49,206 --> 00:59:50,741
since we got back in here?

1187
00:59:50,774 --> 00:59:54,411
Hm, what if, what if they
come storming in, hm?

1188
00:59:54,445 --> 00:59:57,080
Smash everything
down, take you away,

1189
00:59:57,114 --> 00:59:58,682
you're just hiding.

1190
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:06,558
So listen, there's still some
money left over in the bank,

1191
01:00:06,591 --> 01:00:07,893
you can grab some.

1192
01:00:07,927 --> 01:00:09,160
When the vintage car comes,

1193
01:00:09,194 --> 01:00:10,628
walk me out the
front door with you,

1194
01:00:10,662 --> 01:00:12,564
use me as a shield, they
are not gonna risk shooting

1195
01:00:12,597 --> 01:00:15,266
some teenage white girl who's
got so much to live for.

1196
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,702
Okay, then, when
the car comes, yeah,

1197
01:00:17,735 --> 01:00:18,938
you're gonna put me in the car,

1198
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:20,205
dump the car anywhere,
dump me anywhere,

1199
01:00:20,238 --> 01:00:21,974
get a new ID, get on
a plane and bounce.

1200
01:00:22,007 --> 01:00:23,008
- Bounce?
- Bounce.

1201
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:24,343
- New ID?
- Yeah, you're probably

1202
01:00:24,376 --> 01:00:25,578
gonna have to get
rid of your phone,

1203
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:26,779
get a burner, I don't know,

1204
01:00:26,812 --> 01:00:28,581
plane hop to Cuba or
Brazil, some place hot.

1205
01:00:28,614 --> 01:00:29,950
- Done this before?
- I watch movies.

1206
01:00:29,982 --> 01:00:30,783
Moves or films?

1207
01:00:30,816 --> 01:00:31,617
What's the difference?

1208
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:32,451
Jaws, film,

1209
01:00:32,485 --> 01:00:33,954
Minority Report, movie.

1210
01:00:33,986 --> 01:00:34,820
I think.

1211
01:00:35,754 --> 01:00:36,958
I don't get it.

1212
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:38,458
How much do you
reckon's there?

1213
01:00:38,492 --> 01:00:43,029
Oh I saw a bunch of cash
when you dragged me in here.

1214
01:00:44,197 --> 01:00:47,969
There could be hundreds,
maybe even thousands,

1215
01:00:48,001 --> 01:00:49,836
it's all on the floor.

1216
01:00:53,307 --> 01:00:56,444
I mean, you could live off
thousands for awhile, right?

1217
01:00:56,477 --> 01:00:58,981
- What do you like?
- Like?

1218
01:00:59,013 --> 01:01:02,717
In life, what are your
hobbies, your interests?

1219
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:03,986
- Well I don't know.
- Come on,

1220
01:01:04,018 --> 01:01:05,052
there must be something.

1221
01:01:05,086 --> 01:01:07,655
I like cars, I
like vintage cars.

1222
01:01:07,688 --> 01:01:08,892
You sure?

1223
01:01:08,925 --> 01:01:10,459
Sorry, it just seems
like something you'd say

1224
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:12,728
to make it seem to people like
you have an interest in life.

1225
01:01:12,761 --> 01:01:14,530
You know, a boy's thing.

1226
01:01:14,563 --> 01:01:16,665
Yeah, I'm sure,
I was a mechanic.

1227
01:01:16,698 --> 01:01:18,133
Oh my god, well there you go,

1228
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:19,401
eureka, right, this
is what you do, okay?

1229
01:01:19,434 --> 01:01:21,537
You are gonna move to Bolivia,

1230
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:24,172
set up a vintage car
store, maybe even a garage

1231
01:01:24,206 --> 01:01:26,276
and then, you're
gonna call it, ready,

1232
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:30,046
wait for it, Nath's
Place, you know,

1233
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,481
in honour of your friend.

1234
01:01:31,514 --> 01:01:33,550
- Maybe.
- I mean what were you gonna do with the money anyway?

1235
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:36,085
Buy a car, get out the hood.

1236
01:01:37,253 --> 01:01:38,555
Just drive.

1237
01:01:38,588 --> 01:01:40,824
It's a good idea, I mean,
no one wants to live in the hood.

1238
01:01:40,858 --> 01:01:42,293
Well why am I the lucky
one that gets to leave?

1239
01:01:42,326 --> 01:01:43,193
Who cares?

1240
01:01:43,227 --> 01:01:45,062
It's your life, free will.

1241
01:01:45,095 --> 01:01:46,430
Yeah, I guess.

1242
01:01:49,633 --> 01:01:51,970
How's your upper class mansion?

1243
01:01:52,003 --> 01:01:53,203
Mansion?

1244
01:01:53,237 --> 01:01:54,705
No, no, I don't
live in a mansion.

1245
01:01:54,738 --> 01:01:55,639
Bullshit.

1246
01:01:57,275 --> 01:02:00,046
Fuckin' suburban
girl if ever saw one.

1247
01:02:00,078 --> 01:02:03,381
With your suburban problems,
I can see it in your eyes.

1248
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:07,319
Daddy ran off with my
rich girl money bullshit.

1249
01:02:16,862 --> 01:02:19,131
Think what you wanna think.

1250
01:02:19,165 --> 01:02:21,267
We all have our problems.

1251
01:02:31,244 --> 01:02:33,246
There is money.

1252
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,214
Told you.

1253
01:02:35,984 --> 01:02:37,484
I'm gonna do it.

1254
01:02:42,155 --> 01:02:43,357
[phone ringing]

1255
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:46,095
[Aaron] Mr. You,
how you doin' baby?

1256
01:02:46,127 --> 01:02:47,462
I would love to talk to Madison.

1257
01:02:47,495 --> 01:02:48,496
Where's my car?

1258
01:02:48,529 --> 01:02:49,932
[Aaron] All right,
the car is gonna take.

1259
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:51,766
- You've got one hour.
- I need.

1260
01:02:51,799 --> 01:02:54,636
- 90 minutes or she dies.
- I need at least two,

1261
01:02:54,669 --> 01:02:59,008
don't be, what do you
mean, she dies, you mother?

1262
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,176
When the car comes, we go
straight out the front door,

1263
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,545
take as much cash as we can.

1264
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,037
[Man] How you been?

1265
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,804
You mean since the last time?

1266
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,407
[Man] Yeah, exactly right.

1267
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,310
Pretty good, miss
this room though.

1268
01:03:33,344 --> 01:03:35,080
[Man] Yeah?

1269
01:03:35,113 --> 01:03:38,482
It's got a charm, a certain
palatial aesthetic to it.

1270
01:03:38,516 --> 01:03:40,052
[Man] Palatial?

1271
01:03:40,085 --> 01:03:43,088
Plenty of time to
read in here, huh?

1272
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,925
In here you either push
weights or push pages.

1273
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:48,727
[Man] Or push dope.

1274
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,163
No sir, not me.

1275
01:03:51,663 --> 01:03:54,399
Drugs are the devil's food.

1276
01:03:54,433 --> 01:03:56,234
[Man] I got a list of
misdemeanours here that suggest

1277
01:03:56,268 --> 01:03:58,971
that you may be consuming
the devil's food.

1278
01:03:59,005 --> 01:04:00,739
Is that what you wanna do?

1279
01:04:00,772 --> 01:04:03,775
Spend the rest of
your life in jail?

1280
01:04:05,344 --> 01:04:07,246
Is that for?

1281
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,681
Sure, go ahead.

1282
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:26,834
[sighing]

1283
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:29,003
Thank you, sir.

1284
01:04:29,037 --> 01:04:31,206
[Man] Cut the sir, shit.

1285
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:34,641
Where were we?

1286
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:37,512
[Man] I asked you
if you wanna spend

1287
01:04:37,545 --> 01:04:38,480
the rest of your life.

1288
01:04:38,513 --> 01:04:40,950
The rest of my life in jail?

1289
01:04:40,983 --> 01:04:43,219
Yeah, I remember now.

1290
01:04:43,251 --> 01:04:44,586
I'd favour not to.

1291
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,821
- [Man] Yeah?
- Yeah.

1292
01:04:46,855 --> 01:04:48,057
[Man] Then why re offend?

1293
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:50,658
I mean, some of these
are repeat offences.

1294
01:04:50,692 --> 01:04:51,526
Can I?

1295
01:04:52,695 --> 01:04:54,197
[Man] Go for it.

1296
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:59,002
Most gangster
move ever, Ceaser,

1297
01:05:00,669 --> 01:05:03,173
knowing his reign
would one day end,

1298
01:05:03,206 --> 01:05:06,642
maybe in betrayal,
writes in his will,

1299
01:05:06,675 --> 01:05:11,448
Augustus, a boy, nearly 17,
would acquire all his wealth,

1300
01:05:12,917 --> 01:05:15,119
upon his own certain demise.

1301
01:05:15,153 --> 01:05:16,586
[Man] Octavian.

1302
01:05:17,754 --> 01:05:20,925
I'm sorry, what was
the point of that?

1303
01:05:22,325 --> 01:05:23,860
Nothin'.

1304
01:05:23,895 --> 01:05:27,765
[Man] Wouldn't you be
happier doing a normal thing?

1305
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:29,034
Normal thing?

1306
01:05:31,736 --> 01:05:34,372
[Man] Yeah, a J-O-B,
someone to love,

1307
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:38,143
a nice clean bed, garden,
maybe a dog or two.

1308
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:41,713
I'm allergic to dogs.

1309
01:05:41,747 --> 01:05:44,884
And is that why you think we
were put here on this earth?

1310
01:05:44,918 --> 01:05:47,253
[laughing]

1311
01:05:47,287 --> 01:05:51,723
Three percent of animals are
monogamous, home building,

1312
01:05:51,757 --> 01:05:53,492
cookie cutter.

1313
01:05:53,525 --> 01:05:58,531
[Man] Three to five percent,
and we're not animals.

1314
01:05:59,399 --> 01:06:00,901
No we're better than animals.

1315
01:06:00,935 --> 01:06:02,802
You know this morning, when
I purchased my daily coffee,

1316
01:06:02,836 --> 01:06:04,504
I was served by a
pretty coloured girl

1317
01:06:04,537 --> 01:06:06,273
who always serves me.

1318
01:06:06,307 --> 01:06:08,775
I think she's
Nigerian or somethin'.

1319
01:06:08,808 --> 01:06:11,411
She got them scars, irrelevant.

1320
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,416
Point is, I wasn't
served by no penguin

1321
01:06:15,449 --> 01:06:18,586
or a parakeet or even a dolphin.

1322
01:06:18,619 --> 01:06:21,189
Apparently dolphins are
meant to be pretty smart.

1323
01:06:21,223 --> 01:06:25,459
But I never seen a dolphin
trade on the stock exchange.

1324
01:06:25,492 --> 01:06:27,761
Animals are pretty useless.

1325
01:06:29,464 --> 01:06:33,202
Well, that sir, is
a factual statement.

1326
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:35,304
[Man] Cut the sir shit.

1327
01:06:37,974 --> 01:06:40,375
Again, we reached an impasse.

1328
01:06:41,776 --> 01:06:44,480
Do you wanna spend the
rest of your life in jail?

1329
01:06:44,513 --> 01:06:47,683
All this education
you've taught yourself?

1330
01:06:47,717 --> 01:06:52,289
Don't you wanna show the
world how smart you've become?

1331
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,860
Kay, let's play this out.

1332
01:07:00,063 --> 01:07:03,902
I get outta here, I go
apply for say, 15 jobs.

1333
01:07:05,802 --> 01:07:08,639
That's the normal thing, right?

1334
01:07:08,672 --> 01:07:11,276
Now I get interviews, cause
I got a degree in here

1335
01:07:11,309 --> 01:07:15,113
and one out there, so
they'll see me for sure,

1336
01:07:15,146 --> 01:07:19,684
I get there, nice suit, say
I borrow one from a friend.

1337
01:07:19,717 --> 01:07:23,655
I start talkin', you
know, turn on the charm,

1338
01:07:23,688 --> 01:07:26,992
tell 'em a tale about Moken
sea gipsies of the Andaman Sea

1339
01:07:27,026 --> 01:07:30,062
and how they developed the
ability to focus sight underwater

1340
01:07:30,095 --> 01:07:32,265
so they could hunt
for they food.

1341
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:35,035
Tell 'em a joke or two,
you know, get 'em on my side.

1342
01:07:35,068 --> 01:07:38,405
Now at this stage, they love me.

1343
01:07:38,437 --> 01:07:42,474
Then they ask me
that, menial question,

1344
01:07:42,508 --> 01:07:45,477
you know, the one they ask
you for mere formality.

1345
01:07:45,511 --> 01:07:47,414
Do you have a criminal record?

1346
01:07:47,446 --> 01:07:50,051
Expecting a quick, firm no.

1347
01:07:50,084 --> 01:07:53,421
I mean, I know my
shit, got a nice suit,

1348
01:07:54,788 --> 01:07:59,592
two degrees, dialled back
demeanour, oh he speaks so well,

1349
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,629
how could I have a record?

1350
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,934
But, in fact, I retort
yes, sheepishly.

1351
01:08:07,735 --> 01:08:11,907
Their jaws drop, I don't
get the job, I gotta eat.

1352
01:08:14,608 --> 01:08:17,145
Government wages ain't enough.

1353
01:08:17,179 --> 01:08:18,813
So if I gotta eat
before somebody else

1354
01:08:18,846 --> 01:08:22,085
than that's just the
way it's gotta be.

1355
01:08:23,953 --> 01:08:26,588
[Man] There's other
ways, though, isn't there?

1356
01:08:26,621 --> 01:08:29,624
There's ways you can
get out of here early

1357
01:08:29,658 --> 01:08:32,395
and be good for your community.

1358
01:08:32,428 --> 01:08:33,762
My community?

1359
01:08:33,795 --> 01:08:35,697
[Man] Your community.

1360
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,634
And which one would
that be, master?

1361
01:08:38,668 --> 01:08:40,337
Please tell me, sir.

1362
01:08:41,604 --> 01:08:44,274
[grunting]

1363
01:08:44,308 --> 01:08:48,445
[Man] Didn't I tell
you not to call me sir?

1364
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,880
Now are we animals, huh, huh?

1365
01:08:56,154 --> 01:08:57,588
I can't hear you.

1366
01:08:58,522 --> 01:09:00,125
I can't hear you.

1367
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:02,494
[screaming]

1368
01:09:04,429 --> 01:09:06,697
[coughing]

1369
01:09:12,405 --> 01:09:15,241
[heavy breathing]

1370
01:09:20,312 --> 01:09:23,215
Since we agree, we
are not animals,

1371
01:09:24,683 --> 01:09:27,620
since we now have
an understanding,

1372
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:34,127
I think we both also agree,
you should help your community.

1373
01:09:38,398 --> 01:09:41,169
Because we all
need to be normal.

1374
01:09:49,876 --> 01:09:52,612
♪ Yesterday she told me ♪

1375
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:57,386
For this job, I'm Quint,
you Brody, no more real names.

1376
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,489
What's that called?

1377
01:10:00,522 --> 01:10:02,291
What you're fixin' to buy?

1378
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:04,393
'70 to '75 BMW CSL 3.0.

1379

You seen batman?

1380

'60s batman, bam, boom, crash!

1381
01:10:12,168 --> 01:10:15,572
It's similar to his,
they actually called it the batmobile.

1382
01:10:15,604 --> 01:10:19,142
Someday's you just
can't get rid of a bomb.

1383
01:10:19,175 --> 01:10:21,077
That's from the show.

1384
01:10:23,313 --> 01:10:25,548
Hey man, you trust Saida?

1385
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:29,819
Got no reason not to.

1386
01:10:29,853 --> 01:10:32,123
Started to deduce
that she may have been

1387
01:10:32,156 --> 01:10:35,159
the reason that that
last job went Hitchcock.

1388
01:10:35,192 --> 01:10:36,893
Remember that Lisa
I told you about?

1389
01:10:36,927 --> 01:10:38,996
Yeah, she gon' be there later.

1390
01:10:39,029 --> 01:10:40,931
She saw some doubt in my mind.

1391
01:10:40,965 --> 01:10:42,299
Paranoid, man.

1392
01:10:44,001 --> 01:10:46,138
We gettin' the gun off
Saida at nine, right?

1393
01:10:46,171 --> 01:10:47,105
What time?

1394
01:10:47,139 --> 01:10:49,474
Time to get a watch, nigga.

1395
01:10:51,143 --> 01:10:52,210
What's wrong?

1396
01:10:54,146 --> 01:10:56,515
You don't like that word.

1397
01:10:56,548 --> 01:10:58,617
I see you flinchin'
every time I use it.

1398
01:10:58,649 --> 01:11:01,287
Is that why you keep usin' it?

1399
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:05,291
Ain't my favourite word.

1400

me, they see black.

As if it's academic.

liability to articulate.

You can't just be
doing this because

1448
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:29,711
you're angry with the police.

1449

I mean, we are criminals.

- I counter.

1451

We didn't choose this life.

It chose us.

We were born to be
in this exact moment.

this exact same conversation.

subjected to slavery.

1456

They won't let us erect statues,

1457

1458

They won't salute our heroes,

1459
01:14:02,145 --> 01:14:05,415
so we'll make our
heroes martyrs.

1460
01:14:05,449 --> 01:14:08,418
They won't acknowledge
our brevity,

1461
01:14:08,452 --> 01:14:11,054
so we'll become
disquieted lighthouses.

I feel a sense of parity.

boxers and one of them goes,

1574
01:20:57,087 --> 01:20:59,288
remember Joe Lewis?

1575
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:04,293
And the other one goes, ah
him, from the olden days, yeah.

1576
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:07,731
He was good but he
weren't no Mike Tyson.

1577
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:12,869
Fuck you and your fuckin'
set of feminist morals.

1578
01:21:12,903 --> 01:21:15,806
- Oh, don't go there.
- Shut the fuck up!

1579
01:21:15,839 --> 01:21:19,110
You didn't say shit
before, fuck you too.

1580
01:21:19,143 --> 01:21:21,611
It's a gender thing, huh?

1581
01:21:21,645 --> 01:21:25,817
You upset because I control
your narrative and I got tits?

1582
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:28,053
I've seen more balls on a unic.

1583
01:21:28,086 --> 01:21:31,389
Take your fuckin' rookie,
take your fuckin' gun

1584
01:21:31,422 --> 01:21:33,524
and then go fuck off
into the annals of time,

1585
01:21:33,558 --> 01:21:35,860
you fucking jaded asshole.

1586
01:21:35,893 --> 01:21:38,896
Is that what you
countin' on, huh?

1587
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:42,367
You countin' on these
kids you be groomin'.

1588
01:21:42,401 --> 01:21:45,437
How they gon' grow up
and become Mike Tyson.

1589
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:47,539
Pigeons and all that.

1590
01:21:47,573 --> 01:21:51,244
When the truth is, you
out here killin' 'em?

1591
01:21:52,911 --> 01:21:54,981
Trying to prove your worth,

1592
01:21:55,014 --> 01:21:56,482
cause you ain't got none.

1593
01:21:56,516 --> 01:21:59,352
Ah, the fuckin' rumours,
I set you straight on those.

1594
01:21:59,385 --> 01:22:03,857
Yeah I killed a kid, he stole
from me, I'd do it again.

1595
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:06,260
Damn, that's fucked up.

1596
01:22:06,293 --> 01:22:07,527
Where's your fucking
sense of sisterhood?

1597
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:10,496
Oh, oh, I'm just
here for the money.

1598
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:12,800
Y'all motherfuckers got
some Billy Jean King

1599
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:15,070
vs Bobby Riggs shit goin' on.

1600
01:22:15,103 --> 01:22:16,370
Y'all need to
simmer the fuck down

1601
01:22:16,403 --> 01:22:18,240
before someone get hurt.

1602
01:22:18,273 --> 01:22:20,541
So what of it, Saida, huh?

1603
01:22:21,542 --> 01:22:24,045
Since you out here confessin'.

1604
01:22:25,213 --> 01:22:27,415
I swindled jewellers,

1605
01:22:27,449 --> 01:22:30,219
get out clean,
then all a sudden,

1606
01:22:31,386 --> 01:22:35,924
these porkchops got they
fingers all over me.

1607
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:39,461
Gettin' me on this
charge and that charge.

1608
01:22:40,462 --> 01:22:43,099
Sending me up for the big house.

1609
01:22:45,035 --> 01:22:48,537
You gon' tell me you
didn't do that to me?

1610
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,408
You didn't do that to me?

1611
01:22:57,381 --> 01:22:59,783
And fuck yeah, I'm a veteran.

1612
01:23:01,752 --> 01:23:03,553
Long, tall, I'm a vet.

1613
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,593
Seasoned but I ain't jaded.

1614
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:15,166
And you, fuckin' audacity,
to call me jaded.

1615
01:23:17,735 --> 01:23:19,470
Joe fuckin' Lewis?

1616
01:23:19,504 --> 01:23:21,773
Trying to curtain
me as washed up?

1617
01:23:21,806 --> 01:23:23,841
You're a fuckin' dilettante.

1618
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:26,145
I'm out here gettin'
my hands dirty.

1619
01:23:26,178 --> 01:23:28,613
I'm Mike Tyson, motherfucker.

1620
01:23:30,015 --> 01:23:33,420
Yeah, yeah, you sit on
your fuckin' pink throne,

1621
01:23:33,452 --> 01:23:36,022
collecting off of my hard work.

1622
01:23:36,056 --> 01:23:38,291
[clapping]

1623
01:23:42,461 --> 01:23:45,831
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to have this bunny.

1624
01:23:45,864 --> 01:23:47,734
My family actually gave
it the name, Bunny,

1625
01:23:47,767 --> 01:23:51,238
fuckin' imaginative,
I loved that rabbit.

1626
01:23:51,272 --> 01:23:53,274
One day, Bunny was gone.

1627
01:23:54,674 --> 01:23:57,144
My mother, she tells me
she gave Bunny to a friend,

1628
01:23:57,178 --> 01:23:59,246
but I knew the truth.

1629
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,748
My mother was a decent woman,

1630
01:24:01,781 --> 01:24:04,453
she knew Bunny was old, in pain.

1631
01:24:08,223 --> 01:24:11,393
She put it out of
it's fuckin' misery.

1632
01:24:13,494 --> 01:24:16,198
Gotta tell ya, I ain't
too much thought about

1633
01:24:16,231 --> 01:24:18,000
that Bunny ever since.

1634
01:24:18,033 --> 01:24:19,067
Fuck you.

1635
01:24:19,101 --> 01:24:21,703
[upbeat music]

1636
01:24:25,441 --> 01:24:28,044
[gun shooting]

1637
01:24:33,082 --> 01:24:35,419
[screaming]

1638
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,495
We gotta call the cops!

1639
01:24:44,527 --> 01:24:47,331
Somebody please call the cops!

1640
01:24:47,364 --> 01:24:50,968
You guys, come on, you
gotta call the cops!

1641
01:24:51,835 --> 01:24:54,506
Somebody please call the cops!

1642
01:24:54,571 --> 01:24:56,874
[screaming]

1643
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,297
We gotta call the cops, we
gotta do something, please!

1644
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:20,865
[gun shooting]

1645
01:25:24,471 --> 01:25:27,307
[heavy breathing]

1646
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,478
Nath, we goin' now?

1647
01:25:40,188 --> 01:25:42,856
[gun shooting]

1648
01:25:42,889 --> 01:25:43,723
Yeah.

1649
01:25:45,592 --> 01:25:46,693
We goin' now.

1650
01:26:12,021 --> 01:26:12,921
Nice gun.

1651
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:21,064
Want it?

1652
01:26:36,846 --> 01:26:37,647
What you doin'?

1653
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:38,516
Hungry.

1654
01:26:39,617 --> 01:26:41,552
Will you stop doing that?

1655
01:26:41,585 --> 01:26:44,322
[dramatic music]

1656
01:26:54,566 --> 01:26:57,068
So, how much money do I get?

1657
01:26:59,539 --> 01:27:01,007
Five percent.

1658
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,609
I should really
get 50 percent.

1659
01:27:03,643 --> 01:27:06,479
I mean, full disclosure
now, you know,

1660
01:27:06,512 --> 01:27:08,481
since we're working together.

1661
01:27:08,514 --> 01:27:09,582
Since we're a team.

1662
01:27:09,615 --> 01:27:10,983
Oh, not working together.

1663
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,018
Since we're besties.

1664
01:27:12,051 --> 01:27:13,486
- No, we are not a team.
- Yep.

1665
01:27:13,519 --> 01:27:14,353
Mhm, no.

1666
01:27:19,193 --> 01:27:20,927
I lied, earlier on.

1667
01:27:22,629 --> 01:27:26,567
I didn't come here to get the
money from my dad's account.

1668
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,768
I came to get his address.

1669
01:27:29,936 --> 01:27:32,940
I wanted to find out
why he didn't want me.

1670
01:27:32,974 --> 01:27:34,442
You know what,
I'm a good person,

1671
01:27:34,475 --> 01:27:36,743
why wouldn't he want me, why
would he choose money over me?

1672
01:27:36,777 --> 01:27:37,844
People are fucked.

1673
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:39,447
Can't be as simple as that.

1674
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:40,315
It is.

1675
01:27:41,748 --> 01:27:43,218
People are fucked.

1676
01:27:45,987 --> 01:27:46,887
No one cares.

1677
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,090
That's not true, my mum cares,

1678
01:27:48,123 --> 01:27:50,426
she's just, she
just cares too much.

1679
01:27:50,459 --> 01:27:51,493
She cares about herself.

1680
01:27:51,527 --> 01:27:52,528
You don't know her.

1681
01:27:52,561 --> 01:27:54,729
People are not selfless.

1682
01:27:56,898 --> 01:27:58,167
My dad, my dad,

1683
01:28:00,336 --> 01:28:03,073
he, he got himself
thrown in jail

1684
01:28:04,207 --> 01:28:06,977
and then OD'd there
when I was 12.

1685
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:10,879
I spent most of my life in
and out of foster homes.

1686
01:28:10,913 --> 01:28:12,415
Shit foster homes.

1687
01:28:13,882 --> 01:28:18,154
People tellin' me they
love me in spite of,

1688
01:28:18,188 --> 01:28:20,957
always in spite
of, always tainted.

1689
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,560
One of these foster parents used

1690
01:28:22,593 --> 01:28:24,861
to hit me so hard,
my skin would bleed.

1691
01:28:24,894 --> 01:28:26,930
I'd hide in the
cupboard and say my name

1692
01:28:26,964 --> 01:28:28,399
over and over and over again

1693
01:28:28,432 --> 01:28:31,068
until the pain was gone.

1694
01:28:31,102 --> 01:28:32,869
Block out everything.

1695
01:28:35,173 --> 01:28:38,843
The guy, asshole husband,
I forget his name,

1696
01:28:40,445 --> 01:28:41,879
he was the worst.

1697
01:28:43,048 --> 01:28:45,484
He'd hit me, he'd
call me stupid.

1698
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:49,954
One day I stole a
hammer from the shed,

1699
01:28:49,988 --> 01:28:52,492
big one, could barely lift it.

1700
01:28:54,227 --> 01:28:57,063
And I smashed his
fuckin' head in.

1701
01:29:00,033 --> 01:29:03,303
And then I hit him
a couple more times.

1702
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,908
Did he die?

1703
01:29:16,283 --> 01:29:17,884
I don't remember.

1704
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:23,957
My dad.

1705
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:28,697
He should've been a preacher.

1706
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:30,898
You said that already and it
doesn't mean everybody else.

1707
01:29:30,931 --> 01:29:32,167
Said what already?

1708
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,568
You're 16, you've
got plenty of time

1709
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:35,003
to get like this.

1710
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,038
Your dad being a preacher
and I'm not like that,

1711
01:29:37,072 --> 01:29:38,306
I'm not fucked.

1712
01:29:40,343 --> 01:29:43,279
When I see my dad, I'll
move forward, be able

1713
01:29:43,312 --> 01:29:45,914
to close that
chapter in my life.

1714
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:47,516
No spite, no anger.

1715
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,887
You're defined by your actions.

1716
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:55,359
No, I'm defined by my race.

1717
01:29:55,392 --> 01:29:57,594
No one is racist nowadays,
your actions define you.

1718
01:29:57,627 --> 01:29:58,595
[laughing]

1719
01:29:58,628 --> 01:30:00,797
I'm sorry, I'm confused,

1720
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:04,234
what the fuck are
you talking about?

1721
01:30:04,267 --> 01:30:05,669
We're in a new world, okay,

1722
01:30:05,702 --> 01:30:08,238
so I think if you feel
oppressed, your mind

1723
01:30:08,271 --> 01:30:10,540
is clearly living in
the past, you know?

1724
01:30:10,574 --> 01:30:13,277
Self slavery, Gen Z, we're.

1725
01:30:13,311 --> 01:30:15,813
Let's, let's, let's move on.

1726
01:30:17,215 --> 01:30:20,184
Geez, I'm debating race
with a fuckin' 12 year old.

1727
01:30:20,218 --> 01:30:22,653
The fuck I done with my life?

1728
01:30:26,992 --> 01:30:30,262
Got anymore of that chocolate?

1729
01:30:30,295 --> 01:30:35,033
There's none, Jane
Perkin's must be on a diet.

1730
01:30:35,067 --> 01:30:36,168
What time is it?

1731
01:30:36,201 --> 01:30:38,871
- Uh, 10 PM.
- Where's this car?

1732
01:30:42,976 --> 01:30:44,644
There's no other exits.

1733
01:30:44,677 --> 01:30:45,678
Maybe a vent?

1734
01:30:45,712 --> 01:30:48,615
- Where?
- I, I, I don't know.

1735
01:30:48,648 --> 01:30:50,350
I'm thinkin' out loud.

1736
01:30:50,383 --> 01:30:52,886
The front door, it's so risky.

1737
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,542
You gonna leave me?

1738
01:31:15,444 --> 01:31:17,446
What are you talking about?

1739
01:31:17,479 --> 01:31:19,947
After, when we leave the bank,

1740
01:31:19,981 --> 01:31:22,684
are you just gonna leave me?

1741
01:31:22,717 --> 01:31:24,419
Well, yeah.

1742
01:31:24,453 --> 01:31:27,055
You go back to your
mom with your cut,

1743
01:31:27,088 --> 01:31:28,690
I drive some place.

1744
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:31,594
Don't know where.

1745
01:31:33,496 --> 01:31:34,931
Can I come with you?

1746
01:31:34,997 --> 01:31:36,299
Of course not.

1747
01:31:37,934 --> 01:31:39,435
You're 16, I'm 28.

1748
01:31:42,104 --> 01:31:45,608
You've got your whole
life ahead of ya.

1749
01:31:45,641 --> 01:31:48,445
We're from different places.

1750
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:51,381
You've got
opportunities, a future.

1751
01:31:58,422 --> 01:32:00,824
There's gotta be other exits.

1752
01:32:08,132 --> 01:32:12,203
Nath wanted to die,
become a villain, a martyr.

1753
01:32:13,938 --> 01:32:17,642
Maybe I should become a
villain, a super villain.

1754
01:32:17,675 --> 01:32:18,944
What'd you say?

1755
01:32:18,979 --> 01:32:22,147
- I said maybe I should become a villain.
- No, before that.

1756
01:32:22,181 --> 01:32:24,350
Listen, why don't you
just shut your mouth?

1757
01:32:24,383 --> 01:32:26,252
You're a kid, you don't know
what you're talking about.

1758
01:32:26,285 --> 01:32:27,586
The thing is not
necessarily true

1759
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:30,089
because a man dies
for it, Oscar Wilde.

1760
01:32:30,122 --> 01:32:32,024
Who's that, your dad?

1761
01:32:34,727 --> 01:32:37,597
I thought you
didn't wanna leave.

1762
01:32:37,631 --> 01:32:39,199
I thought you wanted to kill me,

1763
01:32:39,232 --> 01:32:40,934
now you wanna leave?

1764
01:32:40,967 --> 01:32:42,168
The fuck wrong with you?

1765
01:32:42,202 --> 01:32:44,170
Do you even know what
day of the week it is?

1766
01:32:44,204 --> 01:32:45,572
I'm warning you.

1767
01:32:45,605 --> 01:32:47,741
You're stupid.

1768
01:32:47,774 --> 01:32:49,309
You're still that same child

1769
01:32:49,342 --> 01:32:51,679
that used to hide
in the basement.

1770
01:32:51,712 --> 01:32:54,682
- Yeah, you're weak.
- I'm weak?

1771
01:32:54,715 --> 01:32:56,551
- Yeah.
- I'm weak.

1772
01:32:56,584 --> 01:32:59,387
- You're so stupid!
- Shut the fuck up!

1773
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:00,555
Go on, call your dad, call 'em.

1774
01:33:00,588 --> 01:33:02,056
I don't wanna, I don't wanna!

1775
01:33:02,089 --> 01:33:02,890
I'm weak?

1776
01:33:02,924 --> 01:33:04,525
Fuck you, I'm weak!

1777
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:08,964
You're a little girl,
a fuckin' child.

1778
01:33:08,998 --> 01:33:13,569
You, you ain't been through
what I been through.

1779
01:33:13,602 --> 01:33:15,337
You wanna trade places, hm?

1780
01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:18,574
- See the kind of life I live?
- Absolutely not!

1781
01:33:18,607 --> 01:33:19,508
Then why are you here?

1782
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:21,010
Cause you got me hostage.

1783
01:33:21,044 --> 01:33:24,280
Well, we just plans
to fuckin' leave.

1784
01:33:36,926 --> 01:33:38,829
Everyone else leaves.

1785
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:53,844
Look, we can start
this journey together.

1786
01:33:53,877 --> 01:33:56,615
- Really?
- Yeah, things go, yeah.

1787
01:33:56,648 --> 01:33:57,882
Maybe, but you,

1788
01:34:05,256 --> 01:34:08,193
how did you know his name?

1789
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:09,361
Nath.

1790
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:11,031
Oh, yeah, you
mentioned it earlier.

1791
01:34:11,064 --> 01:34:12,632
No, I never said it.

1792
01:34:12,665 --> 01:34:15,501
- Yeah, see, you said.
- I always called him Quint.

1793
01:34:15,534 --> 01:34:17,570
You also said you
knew my name, huh?

1794
01:34:17,603 --> 01:34:20,306
How do you know my name, huh?

1795
01:34:20,339 --> 01:34:22,708
Have you been working
with him from the start?

1796
01:34:22,742 --> 01:34:24,810
Is that why you want the money?

1797
01:34:24,844 --> 01:34:27,280
Who do you work for, are
you workin' for Lisa?

1798
01:34:27,314 --> 01:34:30,018
Yeah, her two, you know,
she loves him so much.

1799
01:34:30,051 --> 01:34:31,952
Stop fuckin' with me.

1800
01:34:34,855 --> 01:34:37,524
[phone ringing]

1801
01:34:42,329 --> 01:34:43,831
[Aaron] Mr. You.

1802
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:49,038
Who's the next contestant
on the Price is Right, baby?

1803
01:34:49,071 --> 01:34:50,872
Would you like a new car,
cause I got a new car

1804
01:34:50,905 --> 01:34:53,108
out here for you kids,
how you gettin' along?

1805
01:34:53,142 --> 01:34:54,442
Good.

1806
01:34:54,475 --> 01:34:55,943
I wanna get the fuck outta here.

1807
01:34:55,977 --> 01:34:57,478
[Aaron] You sound
agitated, Mr. You.

1808
01:34:57,512 --> 01:34:59,581
I'm scared, he's
trying to kill me.

1809
01:34:59,615 --> 01:35:02,951
You're against me, all
of you, I know you are.

1810
01:35:02,985 --> 01:35:04,319
[Aaron] Why did
I just hear her say

1811
01:35:04,353 --> 01:35:05,989
that you're gonna kill her,
did you try to kill her?

1812
01:35:06,022 --> 01:35:08,390
You tell me my car's
outside, lure me out, kill me?

1813
01:35:08,424 --> 01:35:11,627
She says she knows my
name, you're playin'

1814
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:14,864
like you don't know my name,
you know my fuckin' name.

1815
01:35:14,898 --> 01:35:17,200
You must've seen
my records by now,

1816
01:35:17,233 --> 01:35:19,836
my fuckin' PO files, huh?

1817
01:35:19,869 --> 01:35:22,205
[crying]

1818
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:24,175
Don't play me like
I'm fuckin' stupid,

1819
01:35:24,207 --> 01:35:26,509
I swear to fuckin' god,
I'll fuckin' kill her.

1820
01:35:26,543 --> 01:35:27,911
[Aaron] I don't
know what's going on.

1821
01:35:27,944 --> 01:35:29,180
I've got my gun
pointed at her right now.

1822
01:35:29,245 --> 01:35:30,413
[Aaron] I believe
you, I believe you.

1823
01:35:30,447 --> 01:35:32,349
Tell me what the
fuck's going on?

1824
01:35:32,383 --> 01:35:33,617
[Aaron] Okay, what
do you wanna know?

1825
01:35:33,651 --> 01:35:35,386
I'll shoot her, I
swear to fuckin god.

1826
01:35:35,419 --> 01:35:36,787
Start talking.

1827
01:35:36,821 --> 01:35:39,991
- [Aaron] What do you want to know?
- All over the fuckin' wall.

1828
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:40,825
Talk!

1829
01:35:40,858 --> 01:35:42,760
[Aaron] Okay, Mr. You!

1830
01:35:42,793 --> 01:35:46,965
Don't call me that, I,
you know my fuckin' name!

1831
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,004
You know everything,
stop playin' me.

1832
01:35:52,038 --> 01:35:53,705
Tell me the truth.

1833
01:35:53,739 --> 01:35:55,407
[Aaron] I'm trying
to tell you the.

1834
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,143
- Talk!
- Mr. You, if you.

1835
01:35:57,176 --> 01:35:59,678
Call me that again and
I'll fuckin' shoot her.

1836
01:35:59,711 --> 01:36:03,150
[Aaron] All right,
listen, listen,

1837
01:36:03,183 --> 01:36:05,318
there's a lot to
unpack right now

1838
01:36:05,351 --> 01:36:06,853
but the only thing
that's important

1839
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:10,690
is that your car is gonna
be here in 10 minutes.

1840
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:12,192
Let's get you out of there,

1841
01:36:12,226 --> 01:36:14,527
let's get you on the road,
let's get you driving, okay?

1842
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,163
And it is, I gotta tell you,

1843
01:36:16,196 --> 01:36:17,697
the car is fuckin' cherry man,

1844
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:19,700
everybody out here is callin'
it the batmobile, you know?

1845
01:36:19,733 --> 01:36:21,368
[gun cocking]

1846
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:23,670
Did you hear that?

1847
01:36:23,704 --> 01:36:24,905
[Aaron] I heard it.

1848
01:36:24,938 --> 01:36:27,341
That's the sound of
my gun being cocked.

1849
01:36:27,374 --> 01:36:29,177
[Aaron] Yeah, I
know that sound.

1850
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:30,878
Tell me the truth.

1851
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:35,151
[Aaron] Yeah, fine,
I know some stuff.

1852
01:36:35,184 --> 01:36:38,286
I know your fuckin'
name, woopdidoo, okay?

1853
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:40,688
I've seen your jacket,
I also happen to know

1854
01:36:40,722 --> 01:36:43,058
all the phone calls
you made to Lisa

1855
01:36:43,092 --> 01:36:45,860
and what she's trying
to get you to do.

1856
01:36:45,894 --> 01:36:48,797
I also know your PO is dead,
I know that Nath Clark,

1857
01:36:48,830 --> 01:36:51,534
your friend that you're
so worked up about,

1858
01:36:51,567 --> 01:36:53,502
is beneath you man.

1859
01:36:53,536 --> 01:36:55,871
That guy's a CI, he's
a criminal informant,

1860
01:36:55,905 --> 01:36:57,840
he's a fuckin'
professional snitch,

1861
01:36:57,873 --> 01:37:01,410
I don't know that he sang
about today's job necessarily,

1862
01:37:01,443 --> 01:37:03,813
I think he was honestly here
to commit suicide by cop.

1863
01:37:03,846 --> 01:37:05,681
- What, he's a snitch?
- But if you are not careful,

1864
01:37:05,714 --> 01:37:07,151
he is gonna take you
fuckin' with him,

1865
01:37:07,185 --> 01:37:08,052
do you understand me?

1866
01:37:08,085 --> 01:37:09,053
- Informant?
- Yes.

1867
01:37:09,086 --> 01:37:11,922
[heavy breathing]

1868
01:37:14,357 --> 01:37:15,926
Why'd you shoot him?

1869
01:37:15,959 --> 01:37:19,130
[Aaron] Well, CI's
only belong to one cop,

1870
01:37:19,163 --> 01:37:20,231
that's why they're confidential,

1871
01:37:20,264 --> 01:37:21,865
nobody else knows about it.

1872
01:37:21,898 --> 01:37:23,367
The guy's out here didn't know,

1873
01:37:23,401 --> 01:37:25,103
they just saw bank robbers
so they shot a bank robber.

1874
01:37:25,137 --> 01:37:26,637
Cause he's black,
cause he's black.

1875
01:37:26,671 --> 01:37:28,173
[Aaron] It has nothing to do.

1876
01:37:28,207 --> 01:37:29,440
You see a nigga runnin'
and he must be a criminal.

1877
01:37:29,473 --> 01:37:30,675
He was in the middle
of committing a crime.

1878
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:31,909
It's okay to cheer a
nigga when he's runnin'

1879
01:37:31,943 --> 01:37:33,978
with a ball in his
hand or in his foot,

1880
01:37:34,012 --> 01:37:36,081
or he's a passin' a
baton, but any other time,

1881
01:37:36,114 --> 01:37:38,116
he must be trouble, huh?

1882
01:37:40,752 --> 01:37:44,690
[Aaron] Come on, Mr.
You, let's talk serious.

1883
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:49,229
I told you not to fuckin' call me
that, now I'm gonna fuckin' kill her.

1884
01:37:49,262 --> 01:37:50,529
[Aaron] No, she's not the one.

1885
01:37:50,562 --> 01:37:52,564
[screaming]

1886
01:37:57,037 --> 01:37:59,572
You're a man of
morals, I like that.

1887
01:37:59,606 --> 01:38:01,108
A guy should have morals, right?

1888
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:03,077
Yeah, definitely.

1889
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:04,345
A man of morals would
definitely understand

1890
01:38:04,377 --> 01:38:06,512
the basic ethics
of conversation.

1891
01:38:06,546 --> 01:38:08,915
One person speaks,
the other one listens.

1892
01:38:08,948 --> 01:38:10,217
I thought you had finished.

1893
01:38:10,251 --> 01:38:11,619
I had not finished.

1894
01:38:11,652 --> 01:38:12,953
It's just, you
asked a question,

1895
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:15,156
- I just assumed you.
- You assumed?

1896
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:17,259
Yeah, I assumed, I
thought you had fin.

1897
01:38:17,292 --> 01:38:18,959
Listen, listen, listen,
let's not start gettin' upset

1898
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:19,760
and angry with each other.

1899
01:38:19,793 --> 01:38:21,062
I'm not gettin' angry.

1900
01:38:21,096 --> 01:38:22,830
- You're gettin' very angry.
- No I'm not.

1901
01:38:22,863 --> 01:38:24,032
Calm down.

1902
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:25,900
No, I assure you,
I'm not gettin'.

1903
01:38:25,933 --> 01:38:29,604
Look, what are we gonna do
about the monetary situation?

1904
01:38:29,638 --> 01:38:32,108
I can probably get
it in a couple of days.

1905
01:38:32,141 --> 01:38:34,910
I just need to see
a few people and.

1906
01:38:34,943 --> 01:38:36,279
You know what?

1907
01:38:36,312 --> 01:38:37,913
- Don't worry about it.
- What?

1908
01:38:37,946 --> 01:38:39,382
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Seriously?

1909
01:38:39,414 --> 01:38:42,885
Yeah, I'm feelin' generous,
don't worry about it

1910
01:38:42,919 --> 01:38:45,421
Well that's uh, should I go?

1911
01:38:47,423 --> 01:38:48,557

How can you quit on yourself?

2261
02:03:40,710 --> 02:03:44,012
Because, it's time
I become a lighthouse.

2262
02:03:46,884 --> 02:03:50,153
[Aaron] What the
fuck does that mean?

2263
02:03:50,187 --> 02:03:52,823
Just, I don't know
what that means, Wyatt.

2264
02:03:52,856 --> 02:03:56,460
Just come out here,
get in this fuckin' car

2265
02:03:56,493 --> 02:03:57,895
I got you because
they are gonna storm

2266
02:03:57,928 --> 02:04:00,230
this place and I
can't stop them.

2267
02:04:00,264 --> 02:04:03,601
They're going to come in, just.

2268
02:04:03,635 --> 02:04:05,537

2270
02:04:10,742 --> 02:04:13,076
It's time I made a fuckin'
decision and kept to it.

2271
02:04:13,111 --> 02:04:15,213
[Aaron] Man,
please, don't do this.

2272
02:04:15,246 --> 02:04:17,081
I gotta be a martyr.

2273
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:30,162
Three times I could've
had this gun tonight,

2274
02:04:30,195 --> 02:04:34,467
but I didn't because I
thought this was your story.

2281
02:05:01,094 --> 02:05:05,033
Madison, the gun doesn't
work properly, okay?

2282
02:05:09,972 --> 02:05:11,807
Give me the gun, okay?

2283

Give me the gun.

2284
