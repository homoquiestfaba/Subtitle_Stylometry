00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,601
SO, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

581
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,436
A BIT BETTER.

582
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:19,304
WELL, LISTEN.

583
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,338
YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY.

584
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,106
I'VE GOT FOOD IN THE FRIDGE

585
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,341
THERE'S TOWELS IN THE

586
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:24,575
BATHROOM.

587
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,043
HELP YOURSELF TO

588
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,077
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

589
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,577
I'VE GOT TO GO GET READY

590
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,379
FOR WORK.

591
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,180
ISN'T IT LATE TO BE STARTING

592
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,415
WORK, ISN'T IT?

593
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,182
WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT

594
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:35,286
YOU DO.

595
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,257
AND WHAT DO YOU DO?

596
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,058
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU

597
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:40,725
THE SAME THING.

598
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:41,492
WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN THAT

599
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:44,295
ALLEY, LAST NIGHT?

600
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,231
WELL, I'M HERE FROM HONG KONG.

UHM, SOUNDS EXCITING.

604
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:57,241
WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON.

00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,677
OH YEAH?

606
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,045
WHAT'S THAT?

607
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,280
WELL, YOU'RE A COP.

608
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,481
I'M A CARD DEALER.

609
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:04,315
WE BOTH SEE PEOPLE

610
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,418

611
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:11,122
HUH.

612
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,724

613
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:17,195
UH-HUH.

614
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,196
GOT A LOT OF CHINESE PATRONS

615
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,832

616
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:24,836
WELL, IT IS A CHINESE CLUB.

617
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:28,806
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

618
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:30,241
HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING THE VIEW,

619
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:34,379
DETECTIVE.

620
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,647
OH!

621
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,149
MAYBE I'LL DROP IN

622
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,385

623
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,419
NO.

624
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:44,188
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

625
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:53,698
BET SIR?

626
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:54,298
HUH?

627
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,334
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BET SIR?

628
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,269
SURE, WHY NOT.

629
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,805
YOU CALL THAT A BET.

630
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:03,107
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

631
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,713
WE HAVE A BLACK JACK WINNER

637
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:17,688
HOW COME YOU NEVER DEAL ME

638
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,290

639
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:19,824

00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,809
DEALER WINS.

646
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:38,743
TYPICAL WOMAN, ALWAYS TAKING

647
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,745

648
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:49,554
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

649
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,021
OH YEAH?

650
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,489
WHAT'S THE CHARGE?

651
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,557
FOR STARTERS, HOW ABOUT

652
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,759
ASSAULTING A POLICE OFFICER.

653
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,394
NO, MAKE THAT TWO.

654
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,530
ATTACK AND A GRAND THEFT AUTO,

655
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,398

657
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,903
IT'S PARKED OUT FRONT.

658
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,207
LET'S TALK.

659
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:16,848
I'LL BE BACK.

660
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:18,216
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE

661
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,450
JENSON?

662
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,318
WHAT AM I DOING HERE.

663
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:23,387
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

664
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,222
THIS IS A CHINESE GAMBLING

665
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,490
PARLOR.

666
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,592
CHANG IS CHINESE.

667
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,429
JUST CALL IT A BRILLIANT HUNCH.

668
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:31,963
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE SOME

669
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,297
KIND OF SIXTH SENSE.

670
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:34,565
RIGHT HERE, YOU'RE LOOKING AT

671
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,800
THE WHO'S WHOM IN CHINESE

672
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,535
MAFIA.

673
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:38,736
TOMMY HONG, BERNARD CHIN,

674
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,339
RICKY LIM, JAMES HAN,

675
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,841
DANIEL SAL.

676
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,610
SAL RUNS THIS PLACE.

677
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,878
TRIADS?

678
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:47,778
YEAH.

679
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,514
LOCAL VERSIONS.

680
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:52,216
MORE LIKE A GENTLEMEN'S MAFIA.

681
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:52,850
MAKE NO MISTAKES THOUGH.

682
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:53,651
THESE GUYS ARE THE CREAM OF

683
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,720
THE CROP.

684
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:56,354
I KNOW THEY'RE NOT WORKING

685
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,723
WITH CHANG BUT [INDISTINCT]

686
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,259
ONE OF THEM KNOWS WHERE HE IS.

687
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,493
THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION.

688
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,761
NO PROBLEM.

689
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:04,795
YOU'RE STILL UNDER ARREST.

690
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,764
[LAUGHS]

691
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,300
THAT WAS QUITE A STUNT YOU

692
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,935
PULLED THE OTHER DAY.

693
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:11,969
ANY ONE OF THEM IS WORTH

694
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,938
10 OF ME, RIGHT?

695
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:14,705
SO MAYBE MY MATH'S A LITTLE

696
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:15,973
OFF.

697
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:16,707
YOU'RE STILL GOING BACK TO

698
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,743
HONG KONG.

699
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:19,610
I'LL GO BACK TO HONG KONG

700
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:20,478
WHEN I'VE GOT MY MAN

701
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:26,517
AND NOT BEFORE.

702
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,253
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU

703
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:33,457
AND THIS GUY ANYWAY?

704
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,091
THIS MAY BE JUST ANOTHER CASE

705
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,960
FOR YOU JENSON, BUT FOR ME,

706
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:38,329
IT'S PERSONAL.

707
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,999
PERSONAL?

708
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:42,633
CHOY, THE UNDERCOVER COP THAT

709
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,302
WAS KILLED THE OTHER NIGHT?

710
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,804
HE WAS A FRIEND OF MINE.

711
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,973
I KNEW HIM FOR 9 YEARS.

712
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:49,774
SO, DON'T YOU TELL ME THIS IS

713
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,643
JUST ANOTHER CASE.

714
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:53,444
OKAY, I DIDN'T KNOW.

715
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,812
I'M SORRY.

716
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:55,913
NO YOU COULDN'T HAVE.

717
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,517
LOOK, FOR WHATEVER REASONS,

718
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,519
WE BOTH WANT CHANG.

719
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,620
I'LL LET YOU WORK WITH ME ON

720
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:03,888
THIS BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO CUT

721
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,790
THE COWBOY SHIT.

722
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,959
WORK WITH ME.

723
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,794
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

724
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,729
YOU GOT SOME KIND OF A PLAN?

725
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:12,597
YEAH.

726
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,532
WHERE ARE YOU STAYING?

727
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,634
WELL, I JUST HAPPENED TO BUMP

728
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,569
INTO THIS LOVELY YOUNG LADY

729
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,437
THE OTHER DAY.

730
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,539
AND SHE IS LETTING ME STAY

731
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,408
AT HER PLACE.

732
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:27,445
HERE'S THE NUMBER.

733
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,013
IT'S GOT TO BE THE ACCENT.

734
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,948
THEY ALWAYS GO FOR THE ACCENT.

735
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,550
WHAT CAN I SAY?

736
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,985
[LAUGHTER]

737
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:46,497
YOU KNOW THESE GUYS?

738
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,932
YEAH, THAT'S MR. SAL.

739
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:50,668
HE IS THE OWNER OF THE CLUB.

740
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:54,071
HE'S A BIG TIPPER.

741
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,873
I'M OFF IN 15 MINUTES.

742
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:56,574

744
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,345
I THINK I'LL TAKE

745
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,813
A RAIN CHECK ON THAT, OKAY?

746
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,916
OH, OKAY.

747
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,891
HEY, DON'T GO IN THERE.

748
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,092
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

749
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,096
HEY, HEY.

00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,003
BATHROOM IS OVER THERE.

753
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:26,904
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA

754
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,406
MAKE IT.

755
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:28,806
HEY!

756
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,809

00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,080
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

763
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,981

767
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,130
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

768
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,532
