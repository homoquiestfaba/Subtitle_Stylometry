1
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,777
<i>Federal prosecutor</i>
<i>Sam Ellis is widely expected</i>

2
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,645
<i>to run for higher office.</i>

3
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:50,282
- <i> With a "not guilty" verdict.</i>
<i>- But a resolution</i>

4
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,784
<i>is expected shortly</i>
<i>on federal charges.</i>

5
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:55,220
<i>That Ellis plans to seek</i>
<i>higher office...</i>

6
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,256
<i>For Ellis, everything is</i>
<i>riding on today's decision.</i>

7
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,258
<i>Today's decision will</i>
<i>either launch</i>

8
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,759
- <i> his political career...</i>
<i>- ...Presumably beginning</i>

9
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,062
<i>with a run</i>
<i>for Attorney General.</i>

10
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,130
Mr. Ellis?

11
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,366
Yeah.

12
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:08,434
A couple of us arranged

13
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,202
this little drinks thing
at blend.

14
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,504
We're kind of all assuming
that You'll be there.

15
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,407
Don't we have to win first?

16
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,276
There's no way You'll lose.

17
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,286
All rise.

18
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,422
Do you think
sheriff Haussler should be given

19
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,791
a lesser sentence given
his record of public service?

20
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,460
As I said at the trial,

21
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:37,229
Jim, this is a black-and-white
issue legally and morally.

22
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,831
There should be
no special treatment.

23
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,732
After today's victory,
do you intend to pursue

24
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,334
corruption charges
against other officials

25
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,269
- in the mayor's administration?
- No decisions

26
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,338
on any further action
have been made at this time.

27
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,707
Any chance you're gonna run
for Attorney General, Sam?

28
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,275
<i>Well, I have my hands full</i>

29
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,710
<i>at the U.S. attorney's office</i>
<i>right now.</i>

30
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,412
<i>While Haussler is expected</i>

31
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,347
<i>to appeal today's decision,</i>
<i>all eyes will be on</i>

32
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,282
<i>whether the U.S. attorney's</i>
<i>office plans to seek charges</i>

33
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,444
<i>against mayor Jonas Stiegel.</i>

34
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,355
So, straight on
to Attorney General?

35
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,858
I can neither confirm
nor deny, counselor.

36
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,493
- Fucking liar.

37
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:08,827
You didn't hear mommy say that.

38
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,429
How's his temperature?

39
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,264
Mm.

40
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,599
Almost there.

41
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,833
We were watching you on TV.

42
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,502
Yeah? Did I look nervous?

43
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,402
I felt like I was shaking.

44
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,138
You looked hot.

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,673
Women on the jury really
loved your lady justice thing.

46
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,242
Uh-huh. It's you they liked.

47
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,144
Well, they did throw
their undergarments at me.

48
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:27,613
- Is that unusual?
- Whores.

49
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,615
My dad was watching
with George Hiller.

50
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,150
They think we should get
Nigel Coaker

51
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,452
to write you up in his
"faces to watch" piece.

52
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:34,887
Yeah, that'd be amazing.

53
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,588
I have Nigel's number.
I'll give him a call.

54
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,524
He owes my dad
a ton of favors, anyway.

55
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:39,691
What time are you coming home?

56
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,893
Uh, you know, they're having

57
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,294
a little victory lap party
for us.

58
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,629
I got to put in an appearance.

59
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:44,830
Lame. I'm kidding.

60
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,698
It's fine. Proud of you, honey.

61
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,433
Okay, I'm pulling up.
I love you.

62
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,202
Love you.

63
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,874
To Sam Ellis.

64
00:02:55,876 --> 00:03:00,512
After 18 months of nonstop toil,
may he enjoy his moment

65
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,648
in the sun, 'cause tomorrow,

66
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,683
I'm going to bury him
under a pile of work.

67
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,252
To Sam.

68
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,221
To Sam.

69
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,762
Do you guys not get it out
of your systems freshman year?

70
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,498
- Fuck off.
- Fuck off.

71
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,533
Okay.

72
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,735
Jeannie must be excited, yeah?

73
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,304
Yeah. Yeah.
She's getting restless, though.

74
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:28,740
Don't tell me you're not,
either.

75
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,309
You've done all you can here,

76
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,944
especially with that fucking
fossil running the show.

77
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:34,213
- Easy.
- All right.

78
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,614
It's, uh...

79
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,316
It's time, yeah?

80
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,519
Sam Ellis
for attorney fucking general.

81
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:43,555
Everybody was just waiting
for you to win this fucker.

82
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,592
Put a pin in it for now.

83
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,760
No, no.

84
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,295
Don't leave me hanging here.

85
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,730
There's got to be more to life
than hedge funds,

86
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,899
or I'm gonna
fucking kill myself.

87
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:54,967
Come on.

88
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,903
I do have to go, though.

89
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,471
Before the wife throws a fit.

90
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,739
Come on.

91
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,840
Listen, congrats again.

92
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,542
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

93
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,278
- See ya.
- See ya.

94
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,653
I'll take another.

95
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,868
You did not!

96
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,437
No, I don't believe you.

97
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,884
I'm not saying that.
You did a great job.

98
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,053
And what exactly
are you saying, counselor?

99
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,989
I am saying that you
should just move around a bit

100
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,491
before the semester's over.

101
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,059
You don't want to go back
to law school thinking

102
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:58,697
that this whole office
is just one boring section.

103
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,632
What If I like your section?

104
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,668
I still think It's a mistake.

105
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,036
I do. You got to figure out

106
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,539
what you believe in,
what makes your righteous.

107
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,741
Angry, even.

108
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,810
And you have this figured out?

109
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,412
Absolutely.

110
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:17,316
Guys that I take down
have no reason to break the law,

111
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,918
yet they're
these over-privileged,

112
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,586
morally bankrupt individuals who

113
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:25,424
think they can just stomp
on the weak and the powerless

114
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,559
and get away with it
because they usually do.

115
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,894
Mm.

116
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,496
If I didn't think
they deserved to go down,

117
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,332
couldn't try the case.

118
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,769
Don't quote me on that.

119
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,071
These cigarettes go to my head.

120
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,440
You're a lightweight.

121
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:42,774
Yeah, I don't...

122
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,410
I don't smoke.

123
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,812
Just doing it to impress me?

124
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,682
Oh, I gave up
trying to impress girls like you

125
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,050
a long time ago.

126
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,358
Oh, boy.

127
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,549
Yeah, this, uh...

128
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,720
Can't do precisely that.

129
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,689
All right.

130
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,157
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,926
- Yeah.
- You're married.

132
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,067
Oh.

133
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,771
You know,
I can keep a secret, though.

134
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,976
I'm sure you can.

135
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,512
I just can't be one of them.

136
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,417
Goodnight, kiddo.

137
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,578
I love you, Ellis.

138
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,947
Love you, too.

139
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,772
If you want to move on this,

140
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,307
you better be staying here
long enough to see it through,

141
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,909
'cause I'm not getting burned
on it.

142
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,610
Guy's committed actual crimes.

143
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,146
If human frailty's all we got,
it'll look like a moral crusade.

144
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,648
Then let it go.

145
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,716
It's not my job
to help you chase headlines.

146
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,719
Do you want the mayor
out of office or not?

147
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,054
Yeah.

148
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,024
Hey, how much longer is Dalia
with us?

149
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,258
Eight weeks.

150
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,826
Any chance
we could transfer her?

151
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,628
I'm not telling
the ninth circuit judge

152
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,665
I fired his daughter
'cause she's too damn pretty.

153
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,033
Right.

154
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,303
Sam.

155
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,638
This is Ellie green.
Miss green, this is Sam Ellis,

156
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,240
- chief of our criminal division.
- Sam Ellis.

157
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,875
- Hello.
- Hi.

158
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,310
And you've already met
U.S. attorney kirkland.

159
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:39,778
I wanted Sam
to review your file.

160
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,613
He's tried a lot
of these identity-theft cases.

161
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,583
Knows how to work a jury
on these kind of issues.

162
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,818
Hmm.
The right man for the job, then.

163
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,025
So, what's the concern?

164
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:57,162
Would you prefer to explain?

165
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,598
I have a record as an escort.

166
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,935
How'd you, uh...

167
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,937
How'd you get into that?

168
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,672
Was trying to model, and,

169
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:11,776
um, I was working as a waitress
at a hotel.

170
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,213
I met this guy who suggested
I could make a lot more money

171
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:19,684
just going on a few dates
for an agency.

172
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,086
He was right.

173
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,954
That how you met the defendant?

174
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,356
No.

175
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:28,994
Elite encounters only serviced
very high-end clients.

176
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:32,230
Politicians,
prominent businessmen.

177
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:36,735
I, uh, saved the lowlifes
for my personal life.

178
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,670
Would you say
that your experience makes you

179
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,305
an expert in lying?

180
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,109
No.

181
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:47,712
No, It's... It's not about that.

182
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,382
It's about fulfilling
people's fantasies

183
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:54,185
while minimizing their guilt.

184
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,720
I'd say being a lawyer

185
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:59,791
is probably better training
for lying.

186
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,259
But you do have
a criminal record.

187
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,328
Not for lying.

188
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,863
Would you tell your parents
about it?

189
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,431
It's not
like I was a street Walker.

190
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,334
You think the jury
would perceive that distinction?

191
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,771
The men will.

192
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,444
- Wow.
- Hmm.

193
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:22,013
Yeah.

194
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,783
I know I should
really push the parent issue.

195
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,151
The jury might get past it.

196
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,053
If they see her
as an abandoned kid up there.

197
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,888
Maybe.

198
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,458
Everyone's got a dark side
you don't normally get to see.

199
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,860
I think jurors understand that.

200
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,064
I know a lot of guys
who used her agency.

201
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,799
Swore by it.

202
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,367
Shouldn't we
be prosecuting that?

203
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,770
Trafficking, sure,
but we got bigger problems.

204
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,138
You said it yourself, Sam.

205
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,241
Nobody cares about human
frailty.

206
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,910
It's still against the law.

207
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,845
Right. Boy scout.

208
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,716
Say "hi" to the intern for me.

209
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,161
Night, chief.
Have a great weekend.

210
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,497
Take it easy.

211
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,931
Oh...

212
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,608
No.

213
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,852
James asked
If he could have a sibling.

214
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:14,919
Really?

215
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,588
Yeah.

216
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,489
That Stiegel?

217
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,526
Uh, no, I'm just
helping Noah with a case.

218
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,066
You think a jury would discredit
testimony from an escort?

219
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,602
I don't know.
Depends on the witness, I guess.

220
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:33,872
You don't think they'd find
it morally reprehensible?

221
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,874
I think they probably
understand It's not quite

222
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,042
the taboo it used to be.

223
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:42,914
I mean, you got all those people
watching Internet porn.

224
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,618
What's she like? You meet her?

225
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,152
Is she sexy?

226
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,989
Uh... I don't know.

227
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,093
Uh...

228
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,962
Mm...

229
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,007
- You tired?
- Yeah.

230
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,243
I just... I have to be up early.

231
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,445
Can I get a hug?

232
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,383
I think I can manage that.

233
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,097
James, you ready?

234
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,632
Here, no, I'll get that.
I got it.

235
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,367
- Okay.
- Don't worry.

236
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,669
Not joining us, huh, Sam?

237
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:41,072
Sure you can survive
a whole weekend

238
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,106
without my daughter?

239
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,375
I'll have to try, sir.

240
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,110
Don't really have your sea legs,
anyway.

241
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,112
That is true.

242
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,315
Remind me next time.
I got some pills for that.

243
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,316
Ah.

244
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:52,717
So, you taking the new one?

245
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,686
You bet.

246
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,588
130-footer.

247
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,158
Stiegel keeping you on land?

248
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,659
Yeah, mostly.

249
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,329
Guess you pretty much
dug yourself into that hole.

250
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,664
What's your plans If you lose?

251
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,700
Doing my best not to lose.

252
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:13,237
Try not to burn the house
down while we're away, hmm?

253
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,006
- Will do.
- Ah.

254
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,008
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Have fun, pal.

255
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,244
Ready to go sailing
with grandpa?

256
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:21,446
How bad was he?

257
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,281
The usual. Do you have to go?

258
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,049
I'll be so bored
without you guys.

259
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,718
You're so sweet.

260
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,087
It's only a couple of days.
Be back Sunday night.

261
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,188
Okay.

262
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,723
And, uh,

263
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:36,394
If you get lonely, you
can always call that witness.

264
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,529
I love you.

265
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,631
Love you.

266
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:25,076
"Is intended for companionship
and modeling services only."

267
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,096
Can I get
a pre-paid phone, there?

268
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,223
Executive privilege.

269
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,457
Uh, hi, yes.

270
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,260
Uh... I was, uh,
looking on your site,

271
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:53,131
and, uh, I'm just wondering
how I could, uh,

272
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,466
make an appointment with, uh,
Christy.

273
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,734
Christy, yeah. Great girl.

274
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,469
She's one of our favorites.

275
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,737
My name's Mona.

276
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,174
I just need to ask you
a few questions.

277
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,208
Uh, what, uh,

278
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,543
what questions?

279
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:06,744
What was your name?

280
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:07,778
Oh, yeah. Okay.

281
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,283
Uh, my name is, uh, Bob fisher.

282
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:14,886
And what do you do, Bob?

283
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:17,455
I'm a, uh, I'm a lawyer.

284
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:18,923
Okay, Bob, is there something

285
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,359
that you can tell me
about yourself

286
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,627
that I can share with Christy?

287
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:23,661
Oh, I don't know.

288
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,298
I'm, uh, Caucasian.

289
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,933
6 feet, 190.

290
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,402
What are some of your hobbies?

291
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,637
What do you like to do, Bob?

292
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,438
Not much of a movie guy.

293
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,208
I...Read a lot.

294
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,843
I like crime novels.

295
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,779
Well, I'm sure Christy
will like to dress for you.

296
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,381
Do you have any preferences?

297
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:47,285
Uh... Maybe like, uh,
like a tight sweater.

298
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,787
I don't know.

299
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:53,291
But you do know
what you like, yes?

300
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,592
Yeah.

301
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,928
Have you ever
used an agency before?

302
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,196
Uh, no.

303
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:02,800
Okay, perfect.
My favorite kind of client.

304
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,771
So, once you get there,

305
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:10,808
You'll leave your money
in an envelope on the counter.

306
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,377
And once we know that
everybody's fine, safe, happy,

307
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,814
and comfortable,
then We'll start the hour.

308
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:20,751
And If you're not happy,
all you have to do is call,

309
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,553
and We'll make sure
We'll make you happy.

310
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,755
We have plenty of girls.

311
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,691
She'll be at the Stanwick hotel.

312
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,426
Have you been there before?

313
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,728
Stanwick, yeah. Yes.
I know where that is.

314
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,430
Room 209.

315
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,931
209.

316
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,434
Yeah, and If anything
comes up, Bob, give me a call,

317
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,002
and I'll do the same for you.

318
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,537
Okay.

319
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,606
I'll be on time.

320
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,307
Thank you, Bob.

321
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,909
Thank you.

322
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,274
Shit.

323
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,283
What floor you heading to?

324
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,719
Uh, 2, please. Thank you.

325
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:26,977
Hi there.

326
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,446
Hi.

327
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,814
So, you must be, uh...

328
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,415
- Christy.
- ...Christy.

329
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,718
Your hair looks different.

330
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,353
Oh, I love this suit.

331
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,355
- Oh, thank you.
- Don't tell me.

332
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,457
It's Canali?

333
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:42,626
- Wow, that's impressive.

334
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,362
Uh, I have the, uh...

335
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,664
Oh, you can just leave
the donation on the counter.

336
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,766
Right.

337
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,876
So, yeah.

338
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,811
First time, maybe?

339
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,481
Might be.

340
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:08,119
Well, I am flattered
you chose me, then.

341
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,787
I can already tell
you're my kind of guy.

342
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,828
Sorry, I'm...

343
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,029
I don't know how this works.

344
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,401
Bob, do you like scotch?

345
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,670
Why don't I fix you a drink?

346
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:27,705
Uh, yeah.

347
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:28,739
Okay.

348
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:32,843
Make yourself comfortable.

349
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,784
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

350
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,552
That's good.

351
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,967
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

352
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,509
I seriously love this fabric.

353
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,845
You have really good taste.

354
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,481
Uh, thank you. Yeah.

355
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:13,150
Worked at a clothing store
in college.

356
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,219
Wound up spending most
of my paycheck on clothes.

357
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:17,121
- And now I sound like a girl.

358
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,489
- No.

359
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,791
No, even men
need to be pampered.

360
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,526
Yeah.

361
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,895
I, um...

362
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,832
I used to work
as a massage therapist.

363
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,501
So...

364
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:34,038
I know how important
it is to have someone around

365
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,974
to take care of your needs.

366
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,639
Go ahead.

367
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,913
You must have
a really stressful job.

368
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,681
Yeah.

369
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,117
I can feel it
in your shoulders.

370
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,561
You want to take
a shower with me?

371
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:37,735
I'll do it myself.

372
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,134
You want to come join me?

373
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,007
I can't do this.

374
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,310
Uh... I'm sorry.

375
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:21,111
It's my mistake.

376
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:25,616
Well, there's no need to rush.

377
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:29,353
Thank you,
but I-I-I have to go.

378
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:31,288
I'm... I'm sorry.

379
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,893
Let me help you.

380
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:37,227
Thank you.

381
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,800
You married?

382
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,234
Yeah.

383
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:45,836
13 years.

384
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,338
13 years.

385
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,839
Yeah.

386
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,942
How old are you?

387
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,011
We were married young.

388
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,849
I see.

389
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,184
What?

390
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:04,221
Well, I can understand
why you're here.

391
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:08,258
It must be hard giving
your youth away to one person.

392
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:17,368
It's a lot of things.

393
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,972
She cheated on me
back in school.

394
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,708
I thought, uh...

395
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,177
You know, It's before we were
married, but I... yeah.

396
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,751
Are there things she won't do?

397
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,853
Things you want to try?

398
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,855
Uh, yeah, sure.

399
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,127
I like to try things.

400
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,825
Is that okay?

401
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,233
God.

402
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,747
How are you doing?

403
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:12,182
I'm good.

404
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,918
You want to fuck me now?

405
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,937
Fuck!

406
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:18,882
So, any plans for the rest
of the day?

407
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,117
Sorry.

408
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,252
You don't have to answer that.

409
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,588
No. I, uh...

410
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,559
I have no more appointments,
If that's what you're asking.

411
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:31,228
I might go lingerie shopping.

412
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,534
Hey, do you always, uh,
kiss on the lips?

413
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,237
I thought that wasn't
part of it.

414
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:43,140
You're sweet.

415
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:46,009
Well, Christy.

416
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,578
It was nice to meet you.

417
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,179
You know,
you should make an appointment

418
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,348
with my friend clio.

419
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,183
She's the top girl
at the agency.

420
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,419
She only sees referrals.

421
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:58,422
Maybe the three of us
could have some fun together.

422
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:01,625
Sorry, but this was a, uh,
a one time thing.

423
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:03,126
Well, I'll tell her about you

424
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:05,529
in case you change your mind.

425
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,932
Trust me,
You'll definitely like her.

426
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,403
Thank you.

427
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,890
- Thank you.
- Sure.

428
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,619
- Dad!
- Hey.

429
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,489
Wha... what are you doing home?

430
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,391
We got back early.

431
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:09,026
Thought we'd surprise you.

432
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,560
Where you been?

433
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:14,197
Uh, we had a meeting with
some of the agents on Stiegel.

434
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,532
Weekend? That's a drag.

435
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:17,401
- Yeah.
- Your hair's wet.

436
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:18,602
You been to the gym?

437
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:19,569
Yeah, stopped on my way back.

438
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:23,240
Good for you.

439
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,374
Want to come eat?

440
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:27,144
Uh, yeah. Smells amazing.

441
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:36,213
<i>With more</i>
<i>than 800,000 federal workers</i>

442
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:37,481
<i>standing to lose their</i>
<i>paychecks...</i>

443
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:40,484
You nervous?

444
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:44,054
I'm just wondering
If It's the smart move

445
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:45,589
to do this right now.

446
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,257
He knows I can't talk
about Stiegel.

447
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,526
Nigel Coaker's on "meet
the press" every other week.

448
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,129
He's barely gonna
know who Stiegel is.

449
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,066
Which one?

450
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,068
Your call.

451
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,503
You know, don't over-think it.

452
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:02,472
Just relax.

453
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,508
Let him see the man underneath.

454
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,512
<i>Many estimates suggest</i>

455
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:09,746
<i>a shutdown could cost</i>
<i>the government...</i>

456
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:13,316
Nice. Just a few more.

457
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,484
Good.

458
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:18,188
So, Sam, your mother...

459
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,124
um, you've cited her as being
a source of inspiration...

460
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,293
was arrested
on a number of occasions

461
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,429
in protests during the '70s.

462
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:29,666
What does she think about you
becoming a federal prosecutor?

463
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:33,437
Well, she passed away
before I got the job, but...

464
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:34,805
I hope she'd be proud of me.

465
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:36,840
Would she have supported
your prosecution of,

466
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:41,144
uh, medical marijuana
facilities, for example?

467
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:43,213
Well, Nigel, my mother
taught me from an early age

468
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:46,450
to fight for justice, protect
those who are vulnerable.

469
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:48,185
The law's the best way
to do that.

470
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:50,420
The U.S. attorney's office
prosecutes those who break it.

471
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,155
We don't decide
what the laws are.

472
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:55,459
No, but you pick
the cases you pursue.

473
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:58,628
So, that means there is
a moral intent.

474
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,832
Now, If 20 states
have a medical exemption

475
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,500
for it, uh,

476
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:06,303
how can the issue
be black-and-white?

477
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:07,838
Because it is.

478
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,773
Nigel, I want to thank you
for including me in your piece.

479
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,708
Oh, anything for Jeannie.

480
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,743
Listen, Sam,
If you're interested,

481
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,212
I'd like to talk to the magazine

482
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:17,180
about doing a longer profile
on you,

483
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,850
maybe I can trail you
in the office.

484
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:22,886
You know, um, do a "day
in the life" kind of thing.

485
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,821
Well, our meetings
are usually confidential,

486
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:26,890
but I'm sure
we can arrange something.

487
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:28,558
Look, I got to get James
to school.

488
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,826
You got any more questions?

489
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,294
Yes.

490
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,263
When are you running?

491
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,133
Mama's gonna pick you up.

492
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,404
Your father seems to
think he'll go far.

493
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,473
If he can handle the pressure.

494
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,208
What do you think?

495
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,277
I don't think he likes me.

496
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:49,713
Oh, he's just sensitive
about his mother, that's all.

497
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:51,581
Mm, well, I think
he's intimidated

498
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,784
by the size of my reputation.

499
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,486
Hmm?

500
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:01,491
How are you two doing?

501
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,893
Great.

502
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:05,795
Things are a little crazy,
but we're great.

503
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:09,499
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

504
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,214
There's a piece
about the Attorney General race.

505
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:28,218
Oh, yeah? I need to watch that.

506
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,653
They mention me?

507
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:31,655
No, they weren't
singling anybody out.

508
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,723
You want me to record it?

509
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,797
Sam?

510
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:43,333
Uh, yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.

511
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,943
Is there a history
of cancer in your family?

512
00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:56,813
Uh, my mother
died from liver cancer.

513
00:36:56,815 --> 00:37:00,450
But, you know, she was
a heavy smoker and big drinker.

514
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:04,354
Have you been with any
new sexual partners recently?

515
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:10,961
Well, uh, I'm married.

516
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:13,363
But yeah.

517
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:16,700
One other one a few days ago.

518
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:17,867
It was just one time, though,

519
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:20,670
and I-I used a condom.

520
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,840
Well, there is a bump,

521
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:27,577
but It's probably
an ingrown hair or something.

522
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,099
In all likelihood,
I think you're fine.

523
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:37,454
Ladies and gentlemen,
senator Edward Pollan.

524
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,992
Thank you, Jeannie.

525
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:45,028
Your exemplary work with
the edible schoolyard project

526
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,431
is an inspiration to all of us.

527
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:52,269
You know, I often ask myself
what we can do in Washington

528
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:55,805
to help shape
our children's sense of place.

529
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,678
Sam Ellis.

530
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,713
- George Hiller.
- Yes.

531
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,415
Glad to finally
meet you in person.

532
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,583
Absolutely, sir.

533
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:08,351
That country club thing,

534
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:10,053
that was a heck of a move.

535
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:14,691
I understand that you're
looking at Attorney General.

536
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,026
Well, I'm not looking
at any job

537
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:18,328
beyond my current employment.

538
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,831
I got something better.

539
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,036
What'll you two ladies have?

540
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,504
I'll take a champagne, please.

541
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:29,005
- Bourbon for me.
- Yes, ma'am.

542
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:30,707
- Who are you?

543
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:31,775
Jeannie?

544
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:33,410
Noah.

545
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:34,511
How's the boss treating you?

546
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:36,379
Oh, total slave master.

547
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:40,684
He drag you in for that FBI
meeting last weekend?

548
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,819
Uh, no.

549
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,921
Guess it must've been
above my pay grade.

550
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:48,091
Well, don't worry.
You'll make it.

551
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,426
You want a drink?

552
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:51,027
Senator Pollan?

553
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,495
You sure?

554
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,531
He's gonna give up his seat?

555
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:57,067
I got him to promise
not to go public yet,

556
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:58,935
but It's done.

557
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:03,873
Now, Pollan Says he's gonna
announce in a year.

558
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,009
When he announces,
we pull the trigger.

559
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:09,546
You quit your job
and you jump in the race.

560
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:16,553
But I got to know now whether
you got the balls for this.

561
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:19,756
I'll have to think it over.

562
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,691
Well, think it over.

563
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,928
But remember,
I'm the other woman here,

564
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,964
so don't keep me waiting.

565
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,499
Now, Nigel Coaker's

566
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,835
already agreed to write
the longer article,

567
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:35,071
which will keep things alive.

568
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:39,843
You just cultivate that clean
image, 'cause your mythology

569
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:42,579
is your best asset.

570
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,117
Look, I know you're...

571
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,019
Hi, there. So nice to meet you.

572
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:52,155
I love your tuxedo.
Is that Armani?

573
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:56,025
I'm the one who gets you there.

574
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:58,128
- I win these things.

575
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:01,464
So, why don't we
pool our resources?

576
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:05,135
I'll bring in my boys, and you
and Jeannie bring in yours,

577
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:07,637
and We'll work together and get

578
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,872
the right team around you, and

579
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:13,410
there's just no telling
where this stops.

580
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,111
You with me?

581
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,517
Absolutely.

582
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,155
We should definitely keep
talking.

583
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,825
It was very nice
to finally meet you.

584
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,118
You should see my friend, clio.

585
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,134
Care for a nightcap,
congressman?

586
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:50,039
What, are you drunk?

587
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,242
You're not drunk enough.

588
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:56,546
Would you come to bed?
We should be celebrating.

589
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:59,148
Aren't you excited?

590
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,018
We would be scrutinized
under a microscope.

591
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,186
You know that, right?

592
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,522
We have anything to hide?

593
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,959
Of course not.

594
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:13,129
But you know these campaigns
get personal.

595
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:15,698
Certain level of brutality,
exposure.

596
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,735
Just want to make sure
It's the right moment

597
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,069
while James is so young.

598
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:22,071
Well, James
isn't like his friends.

599
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:23,640
He obsesses about presidents

600
00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:25,842
the same way other boys
obsess about dinosaurs.

601
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:30,580
I mean, isn't this exactly
what you always wanted?

602
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:35,251
What?

603
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:38,054
I just noticed how adorable
you are in my shirt.

604
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,290
I just... right now.

605
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:42,125
Come here.

606
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,227
Come back up here.

607
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:26,202
No, no. Don't do that.

608
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:27,303
Mnh-mnh.

609
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:29,739
This way.

610
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,664
I love you.

611
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:58,935
I know all the sacrifices
you've made for this.

612
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:02,105
I'm just not sure about Hiller.

613
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,973
Everybody knows he plays dirty.

614
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,209
Well, his candidates win.

615
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,885
I need to know you still
really want this.

616
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:22,325
That you're, um, the same
idealistic guy I fell for...

617
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,661
Who's gonna change the world.

618
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:27,997
Maybe one with
a little less hair, but yeah.

619
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,267
Same guy, I hope.

620
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:35,004
Then I'll be there.

621
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,907
I believe in you, Sam.

622
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,877
Just do whatever you need to do
to make it happen.

623
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,769
Executive privilege.

624
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:10,306
Hi, this is, uh,
Bob fisher calling back.

625
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:13,009
Uh, I'd like
to make an appointment with, uh,

626
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,110
with clio.

627
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:18,981
Hi, Bob. Um, yes, clio.

628
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:24,921
Christy had, uh, said
she'd, uh, tell her about me.

629
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:26,856
Um, I'm sorry, Bob.

630
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:30,093
She's out of town at the moment.

631
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:32,328
Well, when will she be back?

632
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,298
I'm not sure.

633
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,966
Well, when will you know?

634
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:39,936
I don't know, but, um,
I-I can make a note to call you.

635
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:41,904
Uh, okay.

636
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,909
Is there another girl
you'd be interested in?

637
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,212
Did you look at Donna
on our website?

638
00:45:49,214 --> 00:45:51,214
She's available.

639
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:53,816
Donna, yeah.

640
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:55,818
The brunette.

641
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,886
Right.

642
00:45:56,888 --> 00:45:58,888
Yeah, that's fine.

643
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,461
Sure.

644
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:07,029
When?

645
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,833
You know, I've been asking
myself what possible wisdom

646
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:14,470
I can impart to the bright
young minds of tomorrow.

647
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:17,840
And I was gonna say,
"be anyone you want to be."

648
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:21,210
If you want to be an attorney,
be an attorney.

649
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:27,250
You want to be a ballerina,
be a ballerina.

650
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:29,385
If you want to be a fireman,
be a fireman

651
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:31,888
or an astronaut or a playwright.

652
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,390
Technology.
I mean, he can talk directly...

653
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:42,265
But then I realized
that's ridiculous.

654
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:43,933
When are we gonna talk
about ethics reform

655
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:45,902
- and campaign finance?

656
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:49,539
I can't be a ballerina,

657
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:54,544
an astronaut, or a playwright.

658
00:46:54,546 --> 00:46:58,147
I'm just not built that way.

659
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,149
Because really,
you can only be you.

660
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,551
Get your message across.

661
00:47:01,553 --> 00:47:04,253
But maybe that's
what I'll impart.

662
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:05,922
Be you.

663
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:07,924
- Coaker's piece.
- Morning, Sam.

664
00:47:07,926 --> 00:47:12,428
Whoever that is.

665
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,431
Be honest about your weaknesses,

666
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:18,601
but capitalize
on your strengths.

667
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:22,872
Get to the core
of who you really are,

668
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:26,576
because the sooner you
figure out who that is...

669
00:47:26,578 --> 00:47:29,011
The sooner you can decide
which grad school

670
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,280
to blow 100 grand on.

671
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:32,281
Thank you.

672
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:07,049
This bother you?

673
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,518
- No.
- No?

674
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,888
I can touch you any way I like?

675
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,256
Uh-huh.

676
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:15,291
Huh?

677
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:27,236
What If some guy
wanted to cum in your eye?

678
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,438
On those pretty lashes.

679
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:38,581
You're so pretty.

680
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:41,951
Why do you let guys
do this shit to you?

681
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:44,453
I don't know.

682
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:47,056
It's just
what some guys are like.

683
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:49,625
Well, some guys
aren't supposed to be.

684
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,630
Especially in my line of work.

685
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:57,566
Doesn't make a difference,
does it?

686
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,369
That's not the point.

687
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:07,610
It's just
basic human engineering.

688
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:10,146
Fighting that really
make you a better person?

689
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:13,049
The world doesn't work
the way it does when you're 19.

690
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:14,083
You'll see.

691
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:15,318
Oh, whatever.

692
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,554
Rules are just rules
someone made up.

693
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:20,556
None of my clients are 19.

694
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,591
And most of them are married.

695
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,427
If that makes
you feel any better.

696
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:28,164
I didn't say I was married.

697
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:30,299
Sorry.

698
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,402
I talk too much.

699
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:35,104
Don't get mad, okay.

700
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:37,173
I just don't see
why pretending you're someone

701
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:38,374
you're not makes you any better.

702
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:40,443
That's all.

703
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:42,445
Sure you're okay doing this?

704
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:43,980
I mean, come on.

705
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:45,448
Isn't there something
better out there for you?

706
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:48,084
Did you have a favorite subject
in school?

707
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,421
I like what I do.

708
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,392
And I like you.

709
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,064
You want to see me again?

710
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:04,467
I never see the same girl
twice.

711
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:08,504
Oh, poor Bob.

712
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,007
It's okay to come out and play.

713
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,469
We knew Sam
was destined for politics,

714
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:42,371
but I always thought
Jeannie would end up

715
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,507
being the prosecutor.

716
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:46,275
Really? Me? Wow.

717
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,078
You're the one
with the background.

718
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,579
You could jump back in any time
you wanted.

719
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:52,248
Probably.

720
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,450
I just didn't realize
I'd miss James so much

721
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:55,785
being in the office all day.

722
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:57,653
Your charity work
will look better

723
00:50:57,655 --> 00:50:59,388
on a first lady's résumé.

724
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,456
Oh, God.

725
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,092
No pressure, Sam.

726
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,531
Who wants dessert?

727
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:15,204
Sam.

728
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:17,106
Come in.

729
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,776
Pollan's calling a
press conference for next week.

730
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:22,445
Thought you said we had a year.

731
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:23,846
It doesn't matter
what I thought.

732
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:25,481
I couldn't hold him off
any longer.

733
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:27,149
Well, what about Stiegel?

734
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:28,617
Am I supposed to drop the case
in somebody else's lap?

735
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,487
Pollan's got cancer.

736
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:33,756
And It's getting worse.

737
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,225
I'm... I'm sorry about that.

738
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:41,197
Look, Sam, I-I know
you wanted to try that case,

739
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,465
and I respect you for that,

740
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,100
and I know
that Kirkland's probably gonna

741
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:47,670
but this field is gonna
get real crowded real fast

742
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:49,205
once the news gets out.

743
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:51,407
This is game time.

744
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:53,576
You announce, Coaker
writes his piece,

745
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:55,177
you're the man to beat.

746
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:56,545
Okay.

747
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:59,181
"Okay"? Is your head in this?

748
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:01,550
Just took me by surprise,
that's all.

749
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:03,719
Well, this is the perfect time

750
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:05,654
to get used to surprises.

751
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:08,124
You ought to get yourself
some bigger nuts.

752
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:09,792
You got one week.

753
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:30,212
Executive privilege.

754
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:31,780
Yes, hello. This is Bob fisher.

755
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:33,616
I need to cancel
all my upcoming appointments.

756
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:35,584
Things are a bit crazed
right now.

757
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:37,319
Oh, that's too bad, Bob.

758
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,522
I have a note here from clio
to tell you that she's in town.

759
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:41,190
Just for three days, though.

760
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:44,160
She knows you've been inquiring,
and she's willing to meet.

761
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:45,761
Clio?

762
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:50,166
Her schedule's almost
full, but she's free Tuesday.

763
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:53,669
No, that's fine. Thank you.

764
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,507
Constantino is running
for sure.

765
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,776
There's no way
that's happening.

766
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,244
Please give
me another viable name.

767
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:03,412
Bradford.

768
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,347
- Bradford? Mm-hmm.

769
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,261
I like your pictures. Noted.

770
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:21,263
She's got charisma,
but she doesn't have money.

771
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:22,698
She doesn't have donors.

772
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,800
Constantino's gonna
top our million in commitments

773
00:53:24,802 --> 00:53:26,669
by the end of this week.

774
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:27,703
Constantino.

775
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,471
Running or not running?

776
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:30,706
He'll run If I don't.

777
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,275
Oh, I like the balls
on this guy.

778
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:34,910
This is what I like.
This is what we're selling.

779
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:38,948
Confidence, hope, optimism
versus a three-time loser.

780
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:41,250
Success versus failure,
all right?

781
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:42,885
Versus corruption, actually.

782
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,820
- Ideas?
- E.J.'S right, guys.

783
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,355
I just think we need a platform

784
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:48,357
before we want to start
getting the message out.

785
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,826
I want to have the announcement
on a college campus.

786
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:52,528
I want him surrounded
by people under 30.

787
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,431
I want him swimming in people
under 30, you understand?

788
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,505
Hello?

789
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:07,276
Hi, is this Bob?

790
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:08,644
Uh, yes.

791
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:10,246
Hey, It's Laci.

792
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:12,581
I'm... I'm sorry
to call you directly,

793
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,850
but I might be changing
agencies,

794
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:16,752
and I just
wanted you to have my number.

795
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:17,720
Can you talk?

796
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:20,689
Uh... Not exactly.

797
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,827
I-I just wanted you to know

798
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:27,563
how much I enjoyed
the other day.

799
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:30,599
And it'd be great
to see you again.

800
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,468
Uh...

801
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:37,039
Okay, well, I-I have it now.

802
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,607
Yeah.

803
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,709
Sorry again.

804
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:42,478
I hope I'll see you soon.

805
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,612
Okay.

806
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,681
Okay, bye.

807
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:53,856
What phone was that?

808
00:54:53,858 --> 00:54:57,359
Uh, FBI phone.

809
00:54:57,361 --> 00:55:00,629
They heard something
on the wire, needed advice.

810
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,498
I'll see you tonight, okay?

811
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,466
Of course.

812
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,386
They're kind of overpriced.

813
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:28,824
That's the point.
It's my treat.

814
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,492
Isn't my wife a knockout?

815
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,528
Yeah, very flattering.

816
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,796
She gets self-conscious.

817
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:36,765
I understand.
A lot of women do.

818
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,667
- Where are you from?
- Brazil

819
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:41,537
Brazil? Well, never been.

820
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:42,504
I think you would like it.

821
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:43,605
Probably would.

822
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:45,007
What's your name?

823
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:48,010
- Tora.
- Ah. Sam.

824
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,778
Do you think
they're too young for me?

825
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,447
Not at all. They're stunning.

826
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:52,948
We'll take them.

827
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,452
You didn't miss
anything at the conference.

828
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:58,420
Your son is a model student.

829
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:00,356
Good.

830
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:05,661
I'm sorry, sir,
but your card was declined.

831
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:06,829
It was?

832
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:08,597
It's probably just the machine.

833
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:11,367
It happens every now and then.
Would you like me to call them?

834
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,869
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It's fine. Try this one.

835
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,371
Hm.

836
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,139
What have you been buying
lately?

837
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:23,078
Everything okay?

838
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,486
What's going on, Sam?

839
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:32,654
What?

840
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:34,723
I thought we were having
a nice afternoon together.

841
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:37,693
Yeah, I'm just not sure
why you felt that I needed

842
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:40,596
a $400 pair of sunglasses
right at this exact moment.

843
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:42,664
You know, Jeannie,
I took time out of my schedule.

844
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:43,866
I canceled an appointment.

845
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:45,734
- With whom? I jus...

846
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:49,705
is this about the...
the Brazilian girl at the store?

847
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:52,641
No.

848
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:53,809
But now that you mention it,

849
00:56:53,811 --> 00:56:56,845
that was fucking embarrassing.

850
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,881
If you really are going
to become a candidate...

851
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:00,082
"If" I become a candidate?

852
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:01,617
You're gonna have to learn

853
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,152
to deal with flattery
from girls like that.

854
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:04,953
You can't just buy
whatever shit they're selling.

855
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:06,622
What's bothering you,
Jeannie? Just say it.

856
00:57:06,624 --> 00:57:08,891
- Just spit it out.
- Is there someone else?

857
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,997
- No.

858
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:16,532
I don't believe you. I'm sorry.

859
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:19,535
Well, what am I supposed
to do about it?

860
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:21,537
There's nobody else.

861
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,977
Come on.

862
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:40,682
Executive privilege.

863
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,251
Yes, It's, uh, Bob fisher.

864
00:58:42,253 --> 00:58:44,219
Uh, does clio still
have any times available?

865
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:47,523
Hey, Bob.
Um, yes, she does... 5:00.

866
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:51,793
Yes, today.
You want me to pencil you in?

867
00:58:51,795 --> 00:58:54,129
Okay, I'll take it. Uh, where?

868
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:55,831
We have two officers

869
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:56,965
that are gonna be contacts.

870
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:16,251
How'd it go today?

871
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:17,853
All right, I suppose.

872
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:19,888
Sam's not exactly an open book,
but he's good.

873
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,690
He's very, very good
at what he does.

874
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:23,992
It's only 4:30.
He's done already?

875
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:26,895
No, I think he's got a 5:00

876
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,964
outside the office.

877
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:31,867
Get out of the fucking way!

878
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,675
Hi, I need to check
the balance of my card.

879
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:42,711
It was declined.

880
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:46,648
Uh, all right, what are
my options for payment?

881
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:50,052
$2,000.

882
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:52,588
Can I open a line of credit?

883
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,039
Fuck!

884
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,715
Shit!

885
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:21,617
Sorry.

886
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,656
Come on.

887
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,402
Call 911.

888
01:00:40,404 --> 01:00:42,237
Are you all right?

889
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:44,106
You okay? Hey, just stay down.

890
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:46,108
- No.
- You sure?

891
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:48,810
I'm fine.

892
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,746
Hey!

893
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,717
No, they're not ready.

894
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:31,853
Not now.

895
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:14,830
Executive privilege.

896
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:16,264
Hi, this is Bob fisher.

897
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:17,866
I'm not gonna be able
to make my appointment today,

898
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:20,435
but I, uh...

899
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:23,071
I-I think you may be
under investigation.

900
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,906
I don't know, I just...

901
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:27,909
I think they have surveillance
at Clio's hotel.

902
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,377
I could be wrong.

903
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,480
Can you help us?

904
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:32,514
Help you?

905
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:35,016
Uh, no. No, I can't. I'm sorry.

906
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:36,251
Just destroy your records.

907
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,286
Just do whatever you need to do.

908
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:40,388
Just disappear.

909
01:03:01,044 --> 01:03:02,277
Hello.

910
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,380
Please don't hang up,
Mr. Ellis.

911
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:07,249
I'm asking as a friend.

912
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:09,217
Can you help us?

913
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:54,095
Who is she, Sam?

914
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:56,431
What happened? Why were you
at the Saint regency hotel?

915
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:57,899
You can interrogate me later.

916
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:59,067
Just let me rest.

917
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:01,069
Sure.

918
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:02,103
Give you time to prep, right?

919
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:04,039
Jeannie, please.

920
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,510
This? What the fuck is this?

921
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:09,611
Hmm?

922
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:11,146
Hush money for your girlfriend?

923
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:13,014
It's, uh...

924
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:16,318
It's a donation.

925
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,886
You don't treat me

926
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:21,323
like some stupid
suburban housewife, Sam.

927
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:24,326
I outpaced you
in every fucking law class.

928
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:26,928
I was earning a higher salary
than you until...

929
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:30,332
fuck me.

930
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:32,334
I don't understand.
You're my best friend.

931
01:04:32,336 --> 01:04:35,604
You don't do this kind of thing.
Not to me.

932
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:39,040
The nurse said
you fractured a rib.

933
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,009
I wouldn't move too much.

934
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:50,252
What am I supposed to do?
Do I, uh... should I leave?

935
01:04:50,254 --> 01:04:51,486
'Cause I won't be the victim
here.

936
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:53,088
You saw what that did
to my parents.

937
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,222
I'll walk before that happens.

938
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:55,257
We're not your parents.

939
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:57,292
Then get it together.

940
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:00,328
If not for me, do it for James.

941
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:03,465
He looks to you
for how to behave.

942
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:06,501
And whatever mess you're in,

943
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:08,403
you need to dig yourself
out of it now.

944
01:05:10,274 --> 01:05:12,407
I'm going to get our son.

945
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:21,616
You're welcome.

946
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,003
We're sorry.

947
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:44,139
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

948
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:46,074
or is no longer in service.

949
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:50,378
Hello.

950
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,680
Noah, It's Sam.

951
01:05:51,682 --> 01:05:52,948
I need you to check something
out for me.

952
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:56,084
Uh, sure. What's up?

953
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,690
Nigel Coaker
called three times.

954
01:06:01,692 --> 01:06:03,425
I don't want to talk to him.

955
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:06,728
Noah's in your office
with the meeting you asked for.

956
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,330
Okay.

957
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:10,065
It's been mostly FBI so far.

958
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:12,000
We've handled a couple
of warrants.

959
01:06:12,002 --> 01:06:13,435
They put in a request
for a wire,

960
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:14,469
but I think It's too late.

961
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,237
The agency's rolling up fast.

962
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:17,706
What do we know?

963
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:19,975
Some interstate,
some international activity.

964
01:06:19,977 --> 01:06:21,643
For the right price,
a v.I.P. Client

965
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:24,112
could bring a prostitute
to New York or Paris.

966
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:26,448
At the very least, I think
we've got them on the mann act.

967
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,683
We sure about that?

968
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:31,052
Not 100%.

969
01:06:31,054 --> 01:06:32,387
And the agents want
to move now?

970
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:33,621
Who's on it?

971
01:06:33,623 --> 01:06:36,057
Park and Strellitz...
solid guys.

972
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:39,227
They don't want
to see it slip away.

973
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:42,163
Well, I want to come
on board and help out.

974
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:44,099
And I'll lead the case.

975
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:46,368
Is there a reason
you would need to, sir?

976
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:47,602
Is there a problem?

977
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:50,505
No. It's your call, of course.

978
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:54,609
It's just I was hoping to
try the case If it came to that.

979
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:57,479
I used to volunteer at a clinic

980
01:06:57,481 --> 01:06:59,481
that helped prostitutes
get out and get clean,

981
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:02,584
and I saw a lot
of girls go through there.

982
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:04,387
Even at the high end,
there's a pretty intense

983
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:05,620
psychological toll.

984
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:07,222
I think what Flynn
is trying to say,

985
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:10,091
sir, is that we'd like
to stay on the case

986
01:07:10,093 --> 01:07:13,094
unless there's a compelling
reason for us to switch.

987
01:07:13,096 --> 01:07:15,797
You sure you want
to spend your time on this?

988
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:17,399
You think I'm chasing
headlines?

989
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,434
Is that it?

990
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:24,639
You're right, Ms. Flynn.

991
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:26,241
It is an important issue,

992
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:27,776
and that's
why I want to be more involved.

993
01:07:27,778 --> 01:07:31,246
I want to make sure
it stays on the right track.

994
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:32,514
And If it goes to trial,

995
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:34,149
you can have the case.
Fair deal?

996
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:38,253
All right, tell the agents
we're transferring the case.

997
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:41,222
I want to see them in here
at their earliest convenience.

998
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,158
Noah, hang back a sec.

999
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:49,264
A buddy at the bureau
slipped me the lead on this,

1000
01:07:49,266 --> 01:07:52,400
and I don't want to burn him,
so If anyone asks,

1001
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,269
I heard about it from you,
okay?

1002
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:56,071
You got it, chief.

1003
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,693
James, honey, no.

1004
01:08:55,165 --> 01:08:59,601
Otherwise, they're gonna
keep you back in that class.

1005
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,218
You okay?

1006
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,520
Yeah.

1007
01:09:18,522 --> 01:09:19,888
Fine.

1008
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:22,790
Sure. Already read it.

1009
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:29,597
Okay.

1010
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:31,366
See you tonight.

1011
01:09:31,368 --> 01:09:33,301
Okay.

1012
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:47,582
Word is the FBI
sent it upstairs yesterday.

1013
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:48,850
Why the fuck
would they do that?

1014
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:50,785
Look, I talked to my buddy
at main justice.

1015
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:51,920
He said they split it.

1016
01:09:51,922 --> 01:09:53,655
They bumped the case
to New York,

1017
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:55,690
and the rest is going to opr,
which only happens.

1018
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:57,592
If someone in this office
is implicated, right?

1019
01:09:57,594 --> 01:09:58,760
Jesus.

1020
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:00,595
Any idea who that might be?

1021
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:04,826
You know,
Noah, I'm gonna call you back.

1022
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,894
Jesus.

1023
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:53,514
- Hey. H...

1024
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:54,877
I know you called.
Leave a message.

1025
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,301
Detective Brixy.

1026
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:15,770
Ellis, how you doing, man?

1027
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,338
You gonna nail Stiegel
to the wall?

1028
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,940
You are a regular fucking hero
down here, man.

1029
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,942
Yeah, I know. Thanks.

1030
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:23,745
Couldn't have done it without
some solid police work, right?

1031
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:25,513
I-I need you to run a number
for me.

1032
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:27,448
I need an address.

1033
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,974
Can I help you?

1034
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:57,845
Uh, yes.
I, uh... is Jennifer here?

1035
01:11:57,847 --> 01:11:59,414
Just a second.

1036
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:01,482
Thank you.

1037
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:11,693
Hi.

1038
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:12,927
I'm sorry to bother you here.

1039
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:14,962
Um...

1040
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:16,998
It's Jennifer, right?

1041
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,533
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1042
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:19,667
Can I come in?

1043
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:20,768
My mom's in there.

1044
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,103
It's really, really important.

1045
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:25,006
Uh, is there somewhere else
we can talk, then?

1046
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:31,045
They already brought me in
for questioning this morning.

1047
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:33,681
It sucked.
Cops really creep me out.

1048
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:37,085
What did they ask you?

1049
01:12:37,087 --> 01:12:38,786
They said I can't discuss that.

1050
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:43,658
Listen, you need to get
a... a message to the agency.

1051
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:47,061
You need to tell them not to
volunteer any information, okay?

1052
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:48,663
The FBI doesn't have a case.

1053
01:12:48,665 --> 01:12:50,098
- Everybody's in custody.
- It doesn't...

1054
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,899
no, I mean they
got every single person.

1055
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:53,501
You have to think of a way,
though.

1056
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,103
There has to be some way
to get in touch with somebody.

1057
01:12:55,105 --> 01:12:57,572
There's nothing. No, I'm serb...

1058
01:12:57,574 --> 01:12:59,407
- what about the book?
- There's nothing.

1059
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:00,975
- They're gone.
- Can you text somebody?

1060
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:02,610
- One of the other girls?
- What the fuck, man?!

1061
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:04,445
You think they're just gonna use
up their one phone call

1062
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:05,847
- to see how Laci's doing?
- Just think!

1063
01:13:05,849 --> 01:13:07,448
- Just think! Just think!
- The fuck?

1064
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:08,850
- There is nothing!
- Just think of everybody!

1065
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:10,418
- They are gone!
- Help me out!

1066
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:14,989
I never even spoke
to them in person.

1067
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:16,858
It was all just over the phone.

1068
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:19,861
Fuck. I am so fucked.

1069
01:13:19,863 --> 01:13:23,965
This is, uh...
shouldn't have said anything.

1070
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,100
You don't have anything
to worry about.

1071
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,885
I recognized you, you know.

1072
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,823
You're a lot better-looking
in person than you are on TV.

1073
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:56,464
I was gonna go poli-sci
before my mom got diagnosed.

1074
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:07,041
She has cancer, doesn't she?

1075
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:14,115
My mom died from cancer
when I was about your age.

1076
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,923
You guys close?

1077
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,860
Yeah.

1078
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:33,100
She was kind of out of control.

1079
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:35,002
But...

1080
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:40,074
I just got into this
to help her out.

1081
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:44,212
I'm all she's got.

1082
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:52,086
But once you're at the party...

1083
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:54,155
You should get out.

1084
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,495
I-I already switched agencies.

1085
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:04,799
These guys have been
courting me for a while.

1086
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,901
They're super-discrete.

1087
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:23,518
It's okay.

1088
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:35,596
It's all good, right?

1089
01:15:35,598 --> 01:15:38,065
You don't have
to worry about anything.

1090
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:41,002
Everything's gonna be fine.

1091
01:15:41,004 --> 01:15:42,937
Wait.

1092
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:48,609
Can't we, uh...

1093
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:50,211
I've got, uh...

1094
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:56,017
It's all I got.

1095
01:15:56,019 --> 01:15:59,220
I can go to the bank
after If you want.

1096
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:10,031
Right here?

1097
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:12,133
Yeah.

1098
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:55,496
Sorry I'm late.

1099
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:57,798
All rise.

1100
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,234
The honorable Catherine Liu
presiding.

1101
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:04,238
Well, we're off
to a roaring start.

1102
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,842
Apologize for the delay,
your honor.

1103
01:19:07,844 --> 01:19:09,944
Be seated.

1104
01:19:09,946 --> 01:19:11,178
Not you, Mr. Ellis.

1105
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,214
You're not going
to be here that long.

1106
01:19:13,216 --> 01:19:15,282
Let's hear your motions.

1107
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:19,286
Right. Uh...

1108
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:30,264
Hey, um, there's two FBI agents

1109
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,832
that want to speak to you.

1110
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:33,434
I put them in your office.
I hope that's okay.

1111
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:35,236
That's fine. Thank you, Dalia.

1112
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:38,339
And next Friday's my last day.

1113
01:19:38,341 --> 01:19:41,275
I don't know If you knew that.

1114
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,843
Let us know where you land.

1115
01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:45,846
Mm-hmm.
And I wanted to apologize.

1116
01:19:45,848 --> 01:19:48,516
I never meant to complicate
your life or... or your wife's.

1117
01:19:48,518 --> 01:19:50,451
You didn't.

1118
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:56,390
- Gentlemen.
- Mr. Ellis.

1119
01:19:56,392 --> 01:19:57,992
- Sam Ellis.
- Agent park.

1120
01:19:57,994 --> 01:20:00,127
I'm agent Strellitz.
Agent park.

1121
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,796
Have a seat.

1122
01:20:01,798 --> 01:20:03,330
You know why we're here?

1123
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:06,066
You tell me.

1124
01:20:06,068 --> 01:20:09,904
Why this get passed up to main?

1125
01:20:09,906 --> 01:20:14,041
How familiar are you
with executive privilege?

1126
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:15,409
Uh, not very.

1127
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:18,245
I stepped in 'cause
I was concerned about, uh,

1128
01:20:18,247 --> 01:20:19,880
some of the warrants
y'all asked for.

1129
01:20:19,882 --> 01:20:21,415
How did you hear
about the case?

1130
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:25,152
Uh, Noah, one of my
a.U.S.A.S told me about it.

1131
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:27,988
Our investigation started
with a particular elected

1132
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:30,424
official moving large sums
of money around.

1133
01:20:30,426 --> 01:20:32,393
We thought
he might be embezzling funds.

1134
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:34,895
Turns out he was a client
at the agency.

1135
01:20:34,897 --> 01:20:36,597
- Hmm.
- Started to build a list.

1136
01:20:36,599 --> 01:20:39,600
High-profile public officials,
mostly state.

1137
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:41,235
All of whom are clients
and many of whom...

1138
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:43,003
and many of whom

1139
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:46,006
were social friends
of a colleague of yours here.

1140
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,210
Kirkland?

1141
01:20:49,212 --> 01:20:50,945
Mm-hmm.

1142
01:20:50,947 --> 01:20:54,882
We think maybe they asked him
to hold up the investigation.

1143
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:56,417
Has he ever mentioned the case
to you?

1144
01:20:56,419 --> 01:20:58,953
Uh, no. Not at all.

1145
01:20:58,955 --> 01:21:02,056
He ever mention the agency
or prostitution in general?

1146
01:21:02,058 --> 01:21:04,425
Maybe the occasional
off-color comment.

1147
01:21:04,427 --> 01:21:05,626
We're using an escort
as a witness

1148
01:21:05,628 --> 01:21:07,528
on an unrelated
identity-theft case,

1149
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:11,532
but... I believe she worked
for a different agency.

1150
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:14,969
And you yourself
have never had any contact

1151
01:21:14,971 --> 01:21:20,341
with the agency
or any of its employees?

1152
01:21:20,343 --> 01:21:22,443
Not that I'm aware of.

1153
01:21:22,445 --> 01:21:24,011
You were in the hospital
on Tuesday.

1154
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:25,946
Is that correct?

1155
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:28,315
Yes, I was hit
by a car crossing the street.

1156
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:29,416
Then you passed out four blocks

1157
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:30,885
from the Saint regency hotel.

1158
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:32,453
I'm not really sure
where I passed out.

1159
01:21:32,455 --> 01:21:34,488
The police report
could clarify that.

1160
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:37,024
I'd be careful here, fellas.

1161
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:41,662
Do you have a case?

1162
01:21:41,664 --> 01:21:44,665
'Cause it sounds
like you're fishing.

1163
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:48,569
That's exactly why I wanted
to check the warrants.

1164
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,237
If you have any information

1165
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,572
that could assist
the investigation,

1166
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:55,609
- we'd be extremely...
do you have a case?

1167
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:59,647
We suspect
that someone tipped the agency.

1168
01:21:59,649 --> 01:22:01,582
They started rolling up,
destroyed all their records.

1169
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:04,418
That's why we moved in.

1170
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:08,055
But we think we were too late.

1171
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:10,024
Okay.

1172
01:22:10,026 --> 01:22:12,493
So, you gonna charge
them with something?

1173
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,434
No.

1174
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:26,206
Well, hopefully
You'll get them next time.

1175
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:29,176
Y'all should've
come to me first.

1176
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:30,678
It was nice to meet you.

1177
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,013
Mm-hmm.

1178
01:22:33,015 --> 01:22:34,949
Mm-hmm.

1179
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:43,023
Are you
a married man, Mr. Ellis?

1180
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:45,960
13 years.

1181
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:49,330
I'm married 38 years myself.

1182
01:22:49,332 --> 01:22:52,032
I've seen every kind of husband.

1183
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:57,237
You can imagine
for every sort of indiscretion.

1184
01:22:57,239 --> 01:22:58,706
Guys telling themselves.

1185
01:22:58,708 --> 01:23:02,209
It's just a little vacation
from reality.

1186
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:06,981
Or that they're some other guy
when they step into that room.

1187
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:12,119
And I have seen
grown men break down

1188
01:23:12,121 --> 01:23:15,689
and cry
when the chickens come home.

1189
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:18,192
Even If you're getting away
with it,

1190
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:21,362
you only get to be one person
under the eyes of God.

1191
01:23:21,364 --> 01:23:23,130
And these guys,

1192
01:23:23,132 --> 01:23:26,767
they got to be asking themselves
at the end of the day.

1193
01:23:26,769 --> 01:23:31,772
If you're the guy that walks
through that door

1194
01:23:31,774 --> 01:23:33,674
or If you're not.

1195
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:40,014
Have a good day, counselor.

1196
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:23,123
You know, they say that
jogging is shit for the knees.

1197
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,326
So I hear.

1198
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:28,462
You followed me?

1199
01:24:28,464 --> 01:24:30,397
You want to grab a coffee?

1200
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:32,199
We need to have a chat.

1201
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,171
How's your lovely wife?

1202
01:24:37,173 --> 01:24:41,141
Probably sitting
a lot more than I have lately.

1203
01:24:41,143 --> 01:24:44,211
And I heard you had
a visit from the FBI today.

1204
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:48,282
They were briefing me
on a case.

1205
01:24:48,284 --> 01:24:51,218
Mm-hmm. Is that all?

1206
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:54,688
That's funny,
'cause, um... My sources

1207
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:58,125
said it was a little bit more
than that.

1208
01:24:58,127 --> 01:24:59,426
Yeah?

1209
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,495
What did they say?

1210
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:11,271
I think you know.

1211
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:13,240
Hmm?

1212
01:25:16,644 --> 01:25:18,779
You know they haven't got a case
against you, Sam,

1213
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:20,714
and there's no doubt
the pressure from the top

1214
01:25:20,716 --> 01:25:24,151
will get them to drop it.

1215
01:25:24,153 --> 01:25:27,521
And from where I stand, I still
think people have the right

1216
01:25:27,523 --> 01:25:32,726
to know the truth about their,
um, assistant U.S. attorney and

1217
01:25:32,728 --> 01:25:36,530
aspiring future congressman.

1218
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:00,621
You know It's really
the hypocrisy

1219
01:26:00,623 --> 01:26:02,923
that offends most people,

1220
01:26:02,925 --> 01:26:05,759
and you're quite good
at fooling everyone.

1221
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:09,730
But soon, people are gonna
know what you really are.

1222
01:26:09,732 --> 01:26:14,434
Then they can make up
their own mind about it.

1223
01:26:14,436 --> 01:26:15,636
Now, I want to give you

1224
01:26:15,638 --> 01:26:19,373
the chance
to tell me your own story,

1225
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:24,778
and maybe... maybe they
will forgive you.

1226
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,547
If you make them understand.

1227
01:26:26,549 --> 01:26:28,182
When are you running the piece?

1228
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:29,917
Soon.

1229
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:40,427
I have nothing
to say at this time.

1230
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:43,430
<i>Edward Pollan,</i>
<i>the three-term senator</i>

1231
01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:45,399
<i>announced today</i>
<i>that he intends to retire</i>

1232
01:26:45,401 --> 01:26:47,601
<i>at the end of the current</i>
<i>legislative session.</i>

1233
01:26:47,603 --> 01:26:50,938
<i>The unexpected decision leaves</i>
<i>the playing field wide open</i>

1234
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,874
<i>given pollan's 17-year tenure</i>
<i>in the office.</i>

1235
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:57,544
<i>Normally one of</i>
<i>the senate's most outspoken...</i>

1236
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:05,319
Yeah.

1237
01:27:05,321 --> 01:27:06,587
Want cheese on your burger?

1238
01:27:06,589 --> 01:27:08,255
Yeah.

1239
01:27:08,257 --> 01:27:10,557
Yeah.

1240
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,359
Hi, mom.

1241
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:20,834
Here you go.

1242
01:27:20,836 --> 01:27:22,436
Can I give Jack a lettuce leaf?

1243
01:27:22,438 --> 01:27:25,639
Sure.
Just wash your hands, okay?

1244
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:32,713
So, where have you been?

1245
01:27:32,715 --> 01:27:35,449
Around.

1246
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:39,453
I saw the announcement.
You talk to Hiller?

1247
01:27:39,455 --> 01:27:42,589
Not yet.

1248
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:44,625
He wanted some
photographs of your mother

1249
01:27:44,627 --> 01:27:45,626
for the website.

1250
01:27:45,628 --> 01:27:49,029
There's a box in my office.

1251
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,672
Back to business.

1252
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:02,943
Something wrong?

1253
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:06,313
No, sweetie.
Just, um... just hungry.

1254
01:28:55,331 --> 01:28:56,863
Thank you.

1255
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:05,872
Just take your time.

1256
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:20,821
If I talk to you, will you
give me time to resign

1257
01:29:20,823 --> 01:29:22,956
and get my affairs in order?

1258
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:26,760
That's a poor choice
of words, but okay.

1259
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:38,939
Well, first, I-I
want to apologize to my family.

1260
01:29:38,941 --> 01:29:42,442
To my wife and son.

1261
01:29:42,444 --> 01:29:44,778
And my colleagues
at the U.S. attorney's office,

1262
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:48,014
with whom it has been
a great honor

1263
01:29:48,016 --> 01:29:51,818
and privilege to serve.

1264
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:53,954
There are no excuses.

1265
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:02,929
Why take the risk?

1266
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:14,007
I don't know. I don't know.

1267
01:30:14,009 --> 01:30:16,877
It's gonna take me a long time
to figure out.

1268
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:22,883
Jeannie thinks
the world of you.

1269
01:30:22,885 --> 01:30:26,753
Off the record.

1270
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:29,423
How are you gonna
break it to her?

1271
01:30:30,892 --> 01:30:33,960
Well, she already knows,
I think.

1272
01:30:33,962 --> 01:30:36,062
You think?

1273
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:46,506
Why do we
hold public servants to a...

1274
01:30:46,508 --> 01:30:50,644
to a higher standard when it
comes to marriage and fidelity?

1275
01:30:50,646 --> 01:30:53,113
We're flawed like everyone else.

1276
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:59,820
I set out to help people.

1277
01:30:59,822 --> 01:31:02,122
I never said
I was better than them.

1278
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:10,630
Go talk to your wife.

1279
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,676
Jeannie, we need to talk.

1280
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:30,817
It's over.

1281
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:32,586
I'm gonna resign tomorrow.

1282
01:31:35,756 --> 01:31:39,092
What? Why?

1283
01:31:39,094 --> 01:31:42,028
Coaker knows.

1284
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:44,164
Knows what?

1285
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:49,636
Come on, Jeannie.
You already know.

1286
01:31:49,638 --> 01:31:52,105
What is it
I'm supposed to know?

1287
01:31:53,975 --> 01:31:56,076
You want me to say it?

1288
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:07,854
For the past few months...

1289
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:10,657
I've been a client
of an escort agency.

1290
01:32:14,962 --> 01:32:17,063
"Been a client"?

1291
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:24,037
How would you want
me to say it?

1292
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:30,076
You make it sound so clean.

1293
01:32:32,146 --> 01:32:35,582
I have been so afraid
that somebody

1294
01:32:35,584 --> 01:32:38,552
would find out
that now I feel I...

1295
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:41,154
I don't know. I feel relieved.

1296
01:32:41,156 --> 01:32:43,557
I know that sounds horrible.

1297
01:32:45,092 --> 01:32:48,295
When this blows over, I'll get
a job on the civil side.

1298
01:32:48,297 --> 01:32:51,064
Something with less hours
and more money

1299
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:55,001
so I can spend more time
with you and James.

1300
01:32:55,003 --> 01:32:56,636
Maybe you can go back
to practicing law,

1301
01:32:56,638 --> 01:32:58,038
If that's something
that you wanted.

1302
01:33:00,309 --> 01:33:01,675
Jeannie, I need your help here.

1303
01:33:01,677 --> 01:33:03,043
I'm splitting apart here.

1304
01:33:03,045 --> 01:33:05,579
- I can't imagine...
just shut up!

1305
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:13,887
What are we talking about here?

1306
01:33:13,889 --> 01:33:16,289
How many other girls
did you fuck?

1307
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:18,792
5, 10? I mean, you can tell me.

1308
01:33:18,794 --> 01:33:22,062
Do you not think the wife
has a right to know?

1309
01:33:24,231 --> 01:33:25,732
What was it like with them?

1310
01:33:25,734 --> 01:33:26,833
I don't know, Jeannie.

1311
01:33:26,835 --> 01:33:28,101
You don't know?

1312
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:30,670
Why didn't you just
have an affair, Sam?

1313
01:33:30,672 --> 01:33:34,174
That was my worst fear
all along.

1314
01:33:34,176 --> 01:33:37,944
But that...
that would've made you human.

1315
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:42,349
This makes you sick
that you view women that way.

1316
01:33:42,351 --> 01:33:43,984
And there isn't one person
I can blame,

1317
01:33:43,986 --> 01:33:45,952
not one bitch
I can point the finger at.

1318
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:47,087
You didn't even give me that!

1319
01:33:47,089 --> 01:33:48,355
Sorry.

1320
01:33:48,357 --> 01:33:50,323
If life
with us was so fucking terrible,

1321
01:33:50,325 --> 01:33:51,791
why didn't you just fucking go?

1322
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:53,760
I didn't want that.
I never wanted that.

1323
01:33:53,762 --> 01:33:56,363
Then what, Sam?
Help me understand.

1324
01:33:56,365 --> 01:33:58,698
Was our routine so stifling?

1325
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:00,734
Was that it?

1326
01:34:00,736 --> 01:34:02,302
Was it your crazy mama
who wanted you to be

1327
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:03,803
the next Kennedy? Was it me?

1328
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:05,205
Was it my dad?
I know he talks down to you,

1329
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:06,873
but he put a roof
over our heads.

1330
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:08,108
He started your political
career.

1331
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:09,976
Thank you.
Thanks for reminding me.

1332
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:11,811
You know, I felt suffocated,
too, but you know what I did?

1333
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:13,680
I started a fucking vegetable
garden.

1334
01:34:13,682 --> 01:34:16,016
But you...

1335
01:34:16,018 --> 01:34:17,417
You couldn't even
talk to one journalist

1336
01:34:17,419 --> 01:34:18,918
without destroying everything
we worked for.

1337
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:19,986
No, he already knew, Jeannie.

1338
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:21,388
He already knew.

1339
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:23,757
You think you can do any better?
I'd like to see you try.

1340
01:34:23,759 --> 01:34:26,993
Riding me is not the same
as doing it yourself.

1341
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:28,194
Coaker never liked me.

1342
01:34:28,196 --> 01:34:30,063
He was doing this for you
and your father.

1343
01:34:30,065 --> 01:34:31,398
This was my fault now?

1344
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,966
So, we should all feel sorry
for you?!

1345
01:34:32,968 --> 01:34:34,734
I never asked anybody
to feel sorry for me.

1346
01:34:34,736 --> 01:34:37,137
Please tell me it was worth it

1347
01:34:37,139 --> 01:34:39,272
for that few minutes
of excitement.

1348
01:34:39,274 --> 01:34:41,274
Or is that why you did it?

1349
01:34:43,277 --> 01:34:45,745
So you could have a secret
from me.

1350
01:34:45,747 --> 01:34:47,280
From everyone
who believed in you.

1351
01:34:47,282 --> 01:34:49,249
Well, at least it was mine.

1352
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,448
It's okay. It's okay.

1353
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:23,316
It's okay, buddy.

1354
01:35:44,171 --> 01:35:46,406
I suppose you'd like
to come in.

1355
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:04,357
How'd you find out?

1356
01:36:04,359 --> 01:36:08,428
Just because I'm old
doesn't mean I'm lazy.

1357
01:36:15,469 --> 01:36:17,337
Here you go.

1358
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:23,510
Attagirl.

1359
01:36:23,512 --> 01:36:26,412
Don't write the piece.

1360
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,531
It's a matter of time
before he brings himself down.

1361
01:36:44,533 --> 01:36:46,432
That doesn't mean
you have to humiliate me

1362
01:36:46,434 --> 01:36:48,067
in front of the entire world,
in front of my son.

1363
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:50,537
If It's not me, it'll be
someone else eventually.

1364
01:36:50,539 --> 01:36:52,038
Let it be somebody else.

1365
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,139
Why the fuck should I?

1366
01:36:53,141 --> 01:36:54,507
'Cause I'm asking you to.

1367
01:36:54,509 --> 01:36:56,843
I didn't write the piece
in the first place.

1368
01:36:56,845 --> 01:36:59,879
Now It's getting interesting,
and you want me to stop.

1369
01:36:59,881 --> 01:37:01,214
Look, I realize It's your job,

1370
01:37:01,216 --> 01:37:03,116
but is it worth destroying
my family

1371
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:04,551
to sell a few fucking magazines?

1372
01:37:04,553 --> 01:37:07,320
I didn't break the law.

1373
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:08,955
Where as you, my dear, now you

1374
01:37:08,957 --> 01:37:11,891
just found out your husband's
fucking prostitutes.

1375
01:37:11,893 --> 01:37:13,526
Now all you can do
is defend him?

1376
01:37:13,528 --> 01:37:15,061
How many students did you fuck

1377
01:37:15,063 --> 01:37:16,296
in exchange for better grades?

1378
01:37:16,298 --> 01:37:18,231
I mean,
is it really any different?

1379
01:37:18,233 --> 01:37:21,835
It's not about me, right?

1380
01:37:21,837 --> 01:37:25,972
This is about you protecting
your ticket to the top.

1381
01:37:25,974 --> 01:37:28,474
I mean, that's all
you really care about.

1382
01:37:28,476 --> 01:37:30,443
I don't think you're really
bothered about any of them

1383
01:37:30,445 --> 01:37:32,846
other women, I mean,
'cause you just like him.

1384
01:37:32,848 --> 01:37:34,547
I mean, what does he do?
Does he pull your hair?

1385
01:37:34,549 --> 01:37:36,583
Does he talk filth to you?

1386
01:37:36,585 --> 01:37:40,053
Or are you content to allow
his young whores

1387
01:37:40,055 --> 01:37:41,554
to do as they will with him?

1388
01:37:41,556 --> 01:37:44,390
Just as long as you can sit
on that fucking throne.

1389
01:37:50,598 --> 01:37:52,966
Oh.

1390
01:37:52,968 --> 01:37:55,368
You're your father's girl, yeah?

1391
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,337
Now I know I'm digging
in the right place.

1392
01:37:57,339 --> 01:37:58,404
Fuck you.

1393
01:37:58,406 --> 01:38:00,073
Anytime, Jeannie.

1394
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:03,343
Since you were 16.

1395
01:38:03,345 --> 01:38:05,378
Any fucking time.

1396
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:11,117
Okay.

1397
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:13,586
I beg your pardon?

1398
01:38:13,588 --> 01:38:17,090
Call it an even trade.

1399
01:38:17,092 --> 01:38:18,491
What?

1400
01:38:18,493 --> 01:38:20,193
We both know
you haven't been staring at me

1401
01:38:20,195 --> 01:38:21,661
since I was 16, Nigel.

1402
01:38:21,663 --> 01:38:24,297
More like 13.

1403
01:38:24,299 --> 01:38:26,599
I'm still the same girl, so...

1404
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:31,671
Come on. What do you say?

1405
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:24,524
Coaker's not gonna
run the story.

1406
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:34,167
What did you do?

1407
01:39:34,169 --> 01:39:37,437
Remember everything
we talked about?

1408
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:39,339
Remember all the goals
we set for ourselves?

1409
01:39:39,341 --> 01:39:41,174
Let's not throw that away.

1410
01:39:45,346 --> 01:39:49,349
But what If I
can't do it anymore?

1411
01:39:49,351 --> 01:39:51,517
Bit late for that,
don't you think?

1412
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:03,529
I didn't think
you had it in you.

1413
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,134
Go to hell, Sam.

1414
01:40:18,078 --> 01:40:19,779
Let me ask you one thing.

1415
01:40:21,615 --> 01:40:24,017
What did they have that I don't?

1416
01:40:28,489 --> 01:40:30,590
Nothing.

1417
01:40:43,337 --> 01:40:46,305
Sir, you wanted to see me?

1418
01:40:46,307 --> 01:40:48,241
Have a seat.

1419
01:40:54,648 --> 01:40:57,784
I know the FBI
asked you about me, Sam.

1420
01:40:57,786 --> 01:40:59,685
I'm sorry about that whole mess.

1421
01:40:59,687 --> 01:41:01,654
They were just grasping
at straws.

1422
01:41:01,656 --> 01:41:03,723
Shouldn't have happened.

1423
01:41:05,793 --> 01:41:11,731
Listen, I know you're gonna
go after pollan's seat.

1424
01:41:11,733 --> 01:41:13,633
Well, I haven't officially
decided anything yet.

1425
01:41:13,635 --> 01:41:19,372
Just wanted you to know
that I'm all for it.

1426
01:41:19,374 --> 01:41:22,141
We need guys like you in D.C.

1427
01:41:22,143 --> 01:41:25,344
Still see things clearly.

1428
01:41:25,346 --> 01:41:30,650
Been at it as long as I have,
everything looks gray and murky.

1429
01:41:32,486 --> 01:41:34,587
Thank you, sir.

1430
01:41:41,362 --> 01:41:43,629
Fucking "a."

1431
01:41:45,165 --> 01:41:46,866
Look at that.

1432
01:41:54,441 --> 01:41:55,575
Wow.

1433
01:41:55,577 --> 01:41:56,709
Hmm.

1434
01:41:56,711 --> 01:41:58,678
Better than we could've
imagined.

1435
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,301
Senator?

1436
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:26,472
Senator?

1437
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:27,707
Your wife just called.

1438
01:42:27,709 --> 01:42:29,442
She won't be able
to make it on Tuesday,

1439
01:42:29,444 --> 01:42:32,445
but she'll be coming down for
the governor's ball on Saturday.

1440
01:42:32,447 --> 01:42:33,779
All right, that's fine.

1441
01:42:33,781 --> 01:42:36,249
Just make sure she has a pick up
at the airport.

1442
01:42:36,251 --> 01:42:37,483
Yes, sir.

1443
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:38,484
Do you want
us to come in with you?

1444
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:39,752
No.

1445
01:42:39,754 --> 01:42:42,488
We have some private business
to discuss.

1446
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:43,656
You go have lunch.

1447
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:45,625
I'll call you
when we're finished.

1448
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:55,501
Senator.

1449
01:42:55,503 --> 01:42:58,237
George.

1450
01:43:00,241 --> 01:43:02,441
Good to see you.

1451
01:43:02,443 --> 01:43:03,476
Coffee?

1452
01:43:03,478 --> 01:43:05,811
No. Kicked the habit.

1453
01:43:05,813 --> 01:43:08,514
Everything in moderation, huh?

1454
01:43:08,516 --> 01:43:09,916
That's right.

1455
01:43:09,918 --> 01:43:12,919
How's the family?
Your son doing all right?

1456
01:43:12,921 --> 01:43:15,321
Can't run him for congress
till he's 25.

1457
01:43:16,291 --> 01:43:17,390
Well, We'll see.

1458
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:20,426
So, you liking it up here?

1459
01:43:20,428 --> 01:43:22,528
Well, Jeannie doesn't love it,

1460
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:25,798
but her charity
keeps her at home mostly.

1461
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:28,434
I like D.C. it suits me.

1462
01:43:28,436 --> 01:43:29,669
Good.

1463
01:43:29,671 --> 01:43:31,671
'Cause you might be here
for a long time.

1464
01:43:31,673 --> 01:43:33,306
If I have anything
to say about it.

1465
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:37,677
Reelection campaign headquarters
are opening up next week,

1466
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:39,879
and I talked to the governor
this morning.

1467
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:42,782
You can expect
a formal endorsement.

1468
01:43:42,784 --> 01:43:44,317
Glad to hear it.

1469
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:47,620
Sam, I do want
to talk to you, though,

1470
01:43:47,622 --> 01:43:49,555
about your...

1471
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:52,258
Your zipper problem.

1472
01:43:54,661 --> 01:43:57,930
Now, it doesn't surprise me.

1473
01:43:57,932 --> 01:44:03,269
And, uh, I don't really care
what you do in your spare time.

1474
01:44:03,271 --> 01:44:05,738
But the day
you signed on for this,

1475
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:10,710
you put your life on probation.

1476
01:44:10,712 --> 01:44:14,547
Your time on this planet
as a human being

1477
01:44:14,549 --> 01:44:19,986
who eats and shits
and fucks like the rest of us,

1478
01:44:19,988 --> 01:44:22,321
that's over.

1479
01:44:22,323 --> 01:44:26,392
You got a patriotic duty
to be squeaky clean

1480
01:44:26,394 --> 01:44:29,862
for these people
who would turn on you on a dime,

1481
01:44:29,864 --> 01:44:32,798
and that is the contract.

1482
01:44:34,735 --> 01:44:38,638
There may be some people
who want the truth...

1483
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:41,641
In a courtroom.

1484
01:44:41,643 --> 01:44:43,609
But outside,

1485
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:48,814
they want to believe that you're
somehow better than they are.

1486
01:44:48,816 --> 01:44:51,484
They need that fairy tale.

1487
01:44:51,486 --> 01:44:54,654
It's the only thing
that society has to keep it

1488
01:44:54,656 --> 01:44:59,358
from sinking into the muck.

1489
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:03,329
That and wise policy.

1490
01:45:05,565 --> 01:45:08,367
It's under control.

1491
01:45:08,369 --> 01:45:11,003
That's all behind me now.

1492
01:45:11,005 --> 01:45:14,640
Well, that's...
that's all I wanted to hear.

1493
01:45:14,642 --> 01:45:19,011
I suppose that, uh,
If we ruled out every candidate

1494
01:45:19,013 --> 01:45:22,315
who ever stepped out
on his wife,

1495
01:45:22,317 --> 01:45:25,384
it'd be just pussy-whipped nerds
running the country.

1496
01:45:25,386 --> 01:45:28,454
We don't want that, do we?

1497
01:45:30,457 --> 01:45:34,660
People still need heroes.

1498
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:36,529
Let's give them one.

1499
01:45:36,531 --> 01:45:39,498
Good.

1500
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,668
Now, here's the first round
of donations from our friends,

1501
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:44,870
and that's just the beginning.

1502
01:45:51,412 --> 01:45:53,446
And, uh, Sam,

1503
01:45:53,448 --> 01:45:58,050
I wouldn't spend a lot of time
on ethics reform right now.

1504
01:45:58,052 --> 01:46:01,454
You don't want to make a lot
of promises on that.

1505
01:46:01,456 --> 01:46:03,756
And besides, you got a lot
of other subjects

1506
01:46:03,758 --> 01:46:06,459
that you can tackle first.

1507
01:46:06,461 --> 01:46:07,793
Well,
I don't know about you, George,

1508
01:46:07,795 --> 01:46:09,395
but I can handle two things
at once.

1509
01:46:11,566 --> 01:46:14,567
You are a quick study, Ellis.

1510
01:46:14,569 --> 01:46:16,068
You'll do all right.
