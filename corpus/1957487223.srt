Okay, read it to me, Barney boy.

8
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:37,834
Ah-ah-choo

9
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:44,041
Uh, gee, Fred.
It says, "Fatso's House."

10
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,583
Flintstone, it's 6:30
in the morning.

11
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:50,125
Cut the lava loving racket.

12
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:51,958
Ha ha ha.

13
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:55,125
Oh, that's just the caffeine
talking, Mr. Gravelberry.

14
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:58,500
It's Christmas. Try and show
a little excitement.

15
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:03,583
Uh, who's Flintstone?

16
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:06,291
Merry Christmas. I'm..

17
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:13,041
Boy, oh, boy.

18
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,999
What's happened to everyone's
Christmas spirit this year?

19
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,625
I don't know.
It's probably the world, Fred.

20
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:19,916
Everywhere you look.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,333
"The Bedrock savings
and loanstone collapse."

22
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,999
Another drive by
stoning last night.

23
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:29,916
Give me that, Barn. I am not
gonna let a few, little problems

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,542
ruin Christmas
for me and my family.

25
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,999
Oh, great,
now, if I wanna read the news

26
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,916
I got to play scrabble first.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,208
Ha ha ha.

28
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:40,999
Wilma, did you ever notice
how the boys turn

29
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,542
into over grown kids
every Christmas.

30
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:46,792
Oh, Barney's forever trying
to figure out what he's getting.

31
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:49,667
I know what you mean, Betty.
Fred's the same way.

32
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:53,416
Look, I got him one of
these new portable phones.

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,083
My specialty is call waiting.

34
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:03,708
Do you think he'll be surprised?

35
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,958
Oh, I'm sure he will.
He wants a pool table.

36
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:08,500
Ha ha ha.

37
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:13,375
Fred, Pebbles
and Bamm-Bamm just called.

38
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:15,708
They're on the next flight
out of Hollyrock

39
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,875
and should be here
by 4 o'clock.

40
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,083
Yabba-dabba do!

41
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,166
You hear that, Barn?

42
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,375
Little Chip and Roxy
are on the way.

43
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:27,041
My grandkids
are gonna see me play Santa

44
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,667
in the Slate Corp
Christmas Parade.

45
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,416
Just one of the perks
of working

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,708
in the biggest pit
in Bedrock, eh, Fred?

47
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:36,667
But we still have lots to do
before they arrive.

48
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:39,208
"Buy and decorate the tree.
Hang the stockings."

49
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,375
"Deliver these gifts
to all the neighbors."

50
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:42,708
Whoa, whoa, Wilma.

51
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,875
We have to wait
till everyone gets here.

52
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,875
Kids are gonna make Christmas
so special.

53
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,291
But at least go pick up
the turkeysaurus.

54
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,999
And some more quartz
for these gift stars.

55
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,458
I tell you, this is gonna be
the greatest Christmas ever.

56
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,750
Come on, Barn.

57
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:01,583
♪ Rudolf the red nosed
pterodactyl ♪

58
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,583
Alright, what's next, Barn?

59
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,667
Uh, it looks like
"the A n BC market

60
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:14,958
"for Christmas crumble cake
and two boxes

61
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,458
of turkeysaurus helper."

62
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:18,667
Make a donation
for a good cause.

63
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:21,542
- What cause?
- Cause I said.

64
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:24,375
Okay, give me everything
you got.

65
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:29,792
Uh-uh-uh, what
do we do now, Fred?

66
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,250
Unless that bird is
bullet proof, give it to him.

67
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:38,542
Gee, Fred,
I broke Santa in half.

68
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:40,208
Yeah, well,
let's get out of here

69
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:42,459
before he pulls himself
together.

70
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,708
'Okay, folks, sorry
you have to go through this'

71
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:49,958
on Christmas eve,
but we got a line up.

72
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:58,916
- That's the mugger.
- That's the mugger. That's him.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,041
I'd recognize that face
anywhere.

74
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,333
Ha ha ha.

75
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:05,125
Fred, he's just
a harmless child.

76
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,750
Yeah, well, he was a lot bigger
when he robbed us.

77
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,750
Kid runs this Santa sting

78
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,166
with a partner
who plays the bottom half.

79
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,583
'Yeah, well, then you
better put out and APB on his pants.'

80
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,750
This is a tapestry of justice.

81
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:20,166
I want the book throw at him.

82
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:27,834
Stella Stalactite,
Bedrock Social Services.

83
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,458
This is Stony,
a caveless kid

84
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,625
from the wrong side
of the tar pits.

85
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,250
Caveless?

86
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:37,166
Oh, Fred,
he's just a child.

87
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,999
Sure he is, ma'am.

88
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,918
Would you like
to see his baby pictures?

89
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,375
<i>Abandoned as an infant.</i>

90
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:50,958
<i>Stony looted his nursery
as the infamous Pinky Burglar.</i>

91
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,958
<i>He's terrorized
every foster home in Bedrock.</i>

92
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:04,291
<i>As a youngster
he was impossible to place.</i>

93
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:08,208
<i>No matter how hard we tried, no
one could get through to him.</i>

94
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,416
I called the media.

95
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,916
He was even unwanted
by Bedrocks most wanted.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,041
Oh, I'm not that bad.

97
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,542
He stuck us up with a gun.

98
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:25,041
It was just a twig.

99
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,542
See it doesn't even
have a twigger.

100
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,333
Stella, tell him that's a joke.

101
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:34,416
You're sure gonna have them
in stiches down at juvie hall

102
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,416
this holiday, Stony.

103
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,041
Oh, Fred, it's so sad.

104
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,041
No one should have to spend
Christmas in jail.

105
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,166
Maybe we could take him in.

106
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,041
Oh, sure and while we're at it
why don't we see

107
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,834
if Charlie Manson-Stone
wants to come for New Years.

108
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,125
Uh, I'm gonna be busy
New Years, Fred.

109
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,708
What has happened
to your Christmas spirit

110
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,083
Fred Flintstone?

111
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,083
I'll tell you
what's happened to it.

112
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,583
It's sitting in some pawn shop
with my watch and wallet.

113
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,542
That kid is not setting foot
in our house.

114
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:07,500
And that's final.

115
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:08,916
Creak.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,083
Whoa! Great places,
Mrs. Flintstone. What a carpet.

117
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:16,875
Ill get some rock-nog.
Barney, come give me a hand.

118
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,792
Why don't you make Stony
feel at home, Fred.

119
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:21,958
Barney, you gotta help me.

120
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:24,625
Ha ha. Right, Fred.
I'll hide the silver.

121
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:29,999
Whoa, Mr. Flintstone, nice TV.
I can get you free cable.

122
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:35,041
Alone tonight, cave man?

123
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,708
Turn us on.
We're the All Cave Girl Network.

124
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:42,792
W-What.. Give me that.
We'll watch what I say.

125
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:51,416
Cable cruisers
are a big pain in the beak.

126
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,542
<i>And now, the conclusion</i>

127
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:56,125
<i>of Frank Cap-Rocks
holiday classic.</i>

128
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:59,166
Oh, this is my all time
favorite Christmas movie.

129
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,500
We used to watch this every year
when Pebbles was growing up.

130
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:05,792
'"It's a Wonderful
Stone-Age Life."'

131
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,458
What's that sound, daddy?

132
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:11,667
Why that's a sound of another
angel getting his wings, dear.

133
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:13,458
Gets me every time.

134
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:14,916
Oh, give me a break.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,208
Christmas ain't that way for me.

136
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:21,166
What's that sound, daddy?

137
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,458
Is that another angel
getting his wings?

138
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:24,875
No, sweetheart.

139
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,542
It's probably another orphan boy
all alone on Christmas.

140
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,792
Get out of here,
we don't wanna think about

141
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:34,834
people like you
on a nice time like Christmas.

142
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,667
Oh, what a wonderful movie.

143
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:44,834
The only wonder is
that anyone believes

144
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:46,916
all this Christmas junk.

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,208
Hey, my grandkids
are on their way home

146
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,708
and you're not gonna put down
Christmas in front of them.

147
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,166
Why not?

148
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,500
It's the same as any other day
of the year only colder.

149
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:59,166
Look, as long as
you're under my roof

150
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,041
you're gonna enjoy it
whether you want too or not.

151
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,834
'You got that?'

152
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,083
What is going on out here?

153
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,542
Kids are supposed
to like Christmas, Wilma.

154
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:11,291
- This one's defective.
- Fred, Stop it.

155
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,792
The only way you're gonna
get through to Stony

156
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:17,083
is to start treating him
like a member of this family.

157
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:20,041
I say, let him spend
the holiday with his own family.

158
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,708
The Corleone Stones.
Oh!

159
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:26,999
Stony, would you help us
get ready for Christmas?

160
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,125
- Uh, I don't care.
- Good.

161
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,834
Now the first thing
we always do

162
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,458
is go pick out
our Christmas tree.

163
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:36,667
But, Wilma,
I thought we were gonna wait

164
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:38,083
until the kids got here.

165
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:41,125
Hey, Mr. Flintstone,
I know where to get a tree

166
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:44,750
at a rock bottom price.
Only 20 bucks.

167
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:47,416
Come on, Fred,
give Stony the money.

168
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,708
But, Wilma.

169
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:51,958
Fred, we have to show
that we trust him.

170
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:56,918
Catch you later.

171
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:01,792
Some Christmas
this is turning out to be.

172
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,042
Cling cling...

173
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:09,458
Uh...
Stony.

174
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:11,625
Gee, I-I don't know what to say.

175
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,417
That's the most beautiful pine
we've ever had in this house.

176
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,542
Thud.

177
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:21,291
Hey, that's my tree.

178
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,417
'Wilma!'

179
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:29,291
Fred, the boy took back
the Rubble's tree.

180
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,208
Doesn't that tell you anything?

181
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:33,416
Yeah, he missed Betty's China.

182
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,958
Oh, great. Now, what?

183
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,458
Mom, we're stranded
in O'Harestone.

184
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,458
Oh, Betty and Barney
just got here.

185
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,916
I'm gonna put you
on the speaker phone.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,333
Click.

187
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:51,125
Hi, everyone. We're okay,
but there's a blizzard.

188
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:54,708
We just don't know, when
we'll get our connector flight.

189
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:57,708
Be sure to call
the minute you know, honey.

190
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:00,083
We love you.
Bye, Pebbles.

191
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,542
Well, that does it, Wilma.
Our Christmas is ruined.

192
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:07,750
Without the kids
none of it's gonna be any fun.

193
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,291
Cheer up, Fred.

194
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,834
We'll all be there
to see you in the parade.

195
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:15,500
- Uh, Mr. Flintstone.
- What do you want?

196
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:17,416
I wasn't trying to rip you off.

197
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,083
You gave me 20 bucks,
I got you a tree.

198
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:23,667
- What did I do wrong?
- You got me my neighbors tree.

199
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,792
So, I'll only charge you 15.

200
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,125
Ha ha ha.

201
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,542
Fifteen. That's a good one,
huh, Fred?

202
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:30,875
Ha ha ha.

203
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,041
Boy, oh, boy.

204
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,625
Girls were sure
a lot easier, Wilma.

205
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:37,625
He's doing things
the only way he knows how.

206
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:39,916
But at least
he's reaching out to us.

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,208
Yeah, the kid's
not so bad, Fred.

208
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:45,375
He just got me
the All Cave Girl Network.

209
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:48,041
You've still got a child
to share Christmas with

210
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,542
if you want.

211
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:52,875
Maybe he doesn't understand
what Christmas is all about.

212
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,125
Because he's never had
a real one before.

213
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:58,708
I'll try to make it up to you,
Mr. Flintstone.

214
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,875
I'll-I'll scrub floors,
dig ditches.

215
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,208
Even help you get those
ugly things off your front lawn.

216
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,875
Ugly?

217
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,291
Look, Christmas is my
favorite time of the year.

218
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,416
Just try to enjoy it. Okay?

219
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,250
Well, okay.

220
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:17,916
Oh-ho! I'm glad to see
you two working things out.

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,458
Alright, gang. Time to make
our Christmas rounds.

222
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,416
Everybody in the car.

223
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,583
You hear that, Mr. Flintstone.
Christmas rounds.

224
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,958
Boy, am I gonna
try to enjoy this.

225
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,834
So, can I drive?

You know, Wilma, I think
I'm getting through to that kid.

247
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:51,291
I got a suit just like yours but
somebody ran off with the pants.

248
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,834
Yeah. Things are tough all over.

249
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,958
I'm not the real Santa,
you know.

250
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,708
I used to be a broker
for Dragful Birnhamstone

251
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:00,708
until the rock market crumbled.

252
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,583
People trusted me
and they got nothing.

253
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,583
Look at those little faces.

254
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,792
If they don't wind up getting
what I promised

255
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:11,208
they'll be crushed.
And it'll be all my fault.

256
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,667
Do you know the guilt
that goes with this suit?

257
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,166
Aw, everybody could use
a lift around the holidays.

258
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,542
Even Santa.
Merry Christmas, pal.

259
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:22,750
Gee, thanks.

260
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,751
Merry Christmas to you too.

261
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,375
Ho ho ho.

262
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,709
What do you want for Christmas,
young fellow?

263
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,625
Look, Fred, an eight foot fur.

264
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:41,958
At these prices it better be
an eight foot fur coat.

265
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:45,542
Hey, Fred, how about something
in anorexic pine?

266
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:48,625
It's your grandkids
first Christmas, guys.

267
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:50,875
The tree shouldn't be
shorter than they are.

268
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,375
Unfortunately
I can't print my own money.

269
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,250
Can you? Ha ha ha.

270
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:00,500
Hold this tree, mister.

271
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,083
Step right up, folks.

272
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,208
Here, there,
everywhere she goes.

273
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,542
Where she stops
only Stony knows.

274
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:11,250
<i>- It's under the number three.</i>
- It better be under number two.

275
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,625
What do you know.
Where's she go?

276
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:18,583
You little cheater.
Give me my money.

277
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,875
<i>Help! Mr. Flintstone.</i>

278
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,625
Something tells me that
isn't one of Santa's elves.

279
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,792
Help!

280
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,250
Hey, leave the kid alone, buddy.

281
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,416
That little rock-rat cheated me.

282
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,542
Stony, is that true?

283
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:37,458
No, sir. No matter what
I run a honest game.

284
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,999
You can ask anyone.

285
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,375
Please, believe me,
Mr. Flintstone.

286
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:44,208
Please.

287
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:49,875
If Stony says he didn't
cheat you, I believe him.

288
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:52,834
Yeah, well,
believe this, jerko.

289
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:59,125
<i>Paging Dr. Schenck.</i>

290
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:02,166
<i>Dr. Irving Schenck,
please report to OR.</i>

291
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,792
<i>Dr. Schenck, please.</i>

292
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:06,291
What next?

293
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,625
I've been mugged, insulted

294
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,542
decked with a Christmas tree.

295
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:13,625
Yeah. And now you're gonna
have to eat hospital food.

296
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,792
Flintstone, sorry
to hear about your accident.

297
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:19,500
Unfortunately it means
now I'm gonna have

298
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,751
to replace you in the parade.

299
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:27,333
- No, I can do it, Mr. Slate.
- Not a chance, Flintstone.

300
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:31,166
Your well-being comes first
and foremost with Slate Corp.

301
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,792
Uh, besides how would it look
if Santa died on our float?

302
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:41,250
Oh, Wilma, do you know how much
that parade meant to me?

303
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:44,041
There'll be
other Christmases, Fred.

304
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:49,626
Shoot!
It's all my fault.

305
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,542
Flintstone's house
on the double.

306
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:05,708
I have to get that Santa suit.

307
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:10,375
Oh, the things I do
for my rock holders.

308
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,208
You did what to Mr. Slate?

309
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:20,125
But I thought
you wanted to be Santa.

310
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:31,208
Help! I've been kidnapped
and locked in a bathroom.

311
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:34,166
Hold on, Mr. Slate,
I'll get you out.

312
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,918
About time you got here.

313
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,625
Break down his door.
Destroy his property.

314
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:47,375
Then get those
ugly lights off his roof.

315
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:52,999
Fred Flintstone,
give yourself up.

316
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:57,792
Stony, give me a han..
Whoa! Ugh!

317
00:16:57,876 --> 00:17:01,125
<i>Come out with
your hands over your head.</i>

318
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:03,083
Oh, boy.

319
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,792
<i>Couple of rules
to remember in the joint.</i>

320
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:10,834
Don't call another prisoner
a dirty number.

321
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:14,542
And never slow dance
with anyone named Bubba.

322
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:19,333
Look, Mr. Flintstone,
we got a great view

323
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,042
of the exercise yard.

324
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,958
This is the most
terrible day of my life.

325
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:29,708
- Things could be worse.
- How?

326
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:32,958
You could wind up playing
Marie in the prison musical.

327
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,333
That does it.

328
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,334
I don't want you
crossing this line.

329
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,958
How come your part's bigger?

330
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:42,958
Prison rule number three.

331
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:46,875
The bigger guy
gets the most floor space.

332
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:50,875
- 'Mr. Flintstone.'
- Leave me alone.

333
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:53,834
'Want some of Mrs. Flintstone's
crumble cake?'

334
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,291
The bigger guy
gets the bigger half.

335
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,792
Well..
What're you doing with that?

336
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:02,916
On the street
you never know

337
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,208
where your next meal's
coming from.

338
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,875
You always save something.

339
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,792
Oh, thanks, Stony.

340
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,667
Too bad, this didn't come
with a file in it, huh?

341
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:16,083
Ha ha ha.

342
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:17,834
Mr. Flintstone?

343
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:21,667
How come you stood up for me
at that Christmas tree lot?

344
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:24,250
Because that guy
was gonna clobber you.

345
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:27,708
And because I believed you.

346
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:30,834
Huh! You're the first person
who's ever believed me.

347
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:34,250
I wanted to
...give you something in return.

348
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:37,708
But heck, what could I give
a guy like you

349
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,583
who has everything?

350
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:42,667
Getting the Santa gig back
was all I could think of.

351
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:47,625
That's...
Stony, that's nice.

352
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,708
But it's just the way
you did it.

353
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:52,083
It's sorta the way
you do everything.

354
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,625
Uh, I always seem to mess up.

355
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:58,041
Hey, you can't cut corners
to get what you want, Stony.

356
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:02,375
- Understand?
- Yeah, I'm starting too.

357
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:04,999
Maybe I just need
a little more practice.

358
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:09,375
I'm really sorry you're gonna
have to spend Christmas in here.

359
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:10,999
Well, like you said.

360
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,750
At least we've got a great view
of the exercise yard.

361
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,542
Yeah.

362
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,875
Come on, Stony,
I could see your placement

363
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,583
with the Flintstone's
went like all the others.

364
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:28,542
Hurry, Flintstone the parade
starts in two minutes.

365
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,500
Hold on a minute, Mr. Slate.

366
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:32,458
Mr. Flintstone.

367
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:33,918
Stony!

368
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,958
I cleared up the kidnapping mess
and you seem healthy enough

369
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:43,708
to be Santa
put on you hat and let's go.

370
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,916
'Stony.'

371
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,792
Stony.

372
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,041
Hey, Fred,
glad to see you got paroled.

373
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,916
Get any tattoo's?
Ha ha ha.

374
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,750
We have great news.

375
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,916
The kids got a flight
out of O'Harestone.

376
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,291
They'll be here by tonight.

377
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,999
Yeah.
Well, I got bad news.

378
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,208
The anti-social worker
Stella Stalactite

379
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:13,708
took Stony away.

380
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:16,625
- Oh, no, Fred.
- Yeah.

381
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:20,916
You know, he wasn't such a bad
kid when you got to know him.

382
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,792
I even think he was starting
to figure out Christmas.

383
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,000
What's this?

384
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:34,625
Merry Christmas, Stony boy.

385
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:36,750
Stony.

386
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:39,417
Stony.
Stony, wait.

387
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:46,166
On Donnerstone,
on Blitzenquartz

388
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,916
on Prancerpit.

389
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:55,875
Flintstone,
what are you doing?

390
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:58,333
Jingle jingle jingle.

391
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,542
Stony, wait.
Don't go.

392
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:09,500
Mr. Flintstone.

393
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,834
Tell the gang at juvie hall.

394
00:21:14,918 --> 00:21:18,166
Stony's got a home
for the holidays.

395
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:24,250

396
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:28,416

402
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,208
Come on, Stony,

403
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:53,667
we haven't done yet.

404
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:56,916
Newest member of the family
gets to hang the star.

405
