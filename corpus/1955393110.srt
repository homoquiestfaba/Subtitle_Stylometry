1
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:22,553
- <i>I can't do it, Ma.
We have to do something.</i>

2
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:30,127
<i>You can't keep doing this thing where
you pretend that everything's okay,</i>

3
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:32,602
<i>'cause it's not okay. It's not.</i>

4
00:00:33,552 --> 00:00:35,619
<i>We just need to be better.</i>

5
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:56,166
<i>If we don't do anything, we're
gonna just die like this here.</i>

6
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,360
<i>If you don't do this
for yourself, then do it for me.</i>

7
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:28,401
Fuck. Get up!

8
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:33,377
Walter!

9
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:43,874
What happened, Ma?

10
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:48,836
- It just blew.
- I... I know, but how?

11
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,773
I was cooking
that leftover bacon.

12
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,568
You take the foil off?

13
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,423
- No.
- It's okay, Ma. Shhh...

14
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,184
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Ma. Don't cry.

15
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,901
- What do you think
you're doing, Buchanan?

16
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:04,192
Having lunch.

17
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,982
Your clothes look
like they're gonna sprout.

18
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:12,291
You know, advisors should
really deal with the future,

19
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,736
not the present.

20
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:17,180
- Yeah, well, when students
start to vegetate, I step in.

21
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:20,580
Your future depends
on extracurriculars.

22
00:03:20,622 --> 00:03:23,088
Colleges love soup kitchens.

23
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,764
It's time to get serious,
Buchanan.

24
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:43,564
I told you, Miss Parker,
it's gallstones.

25
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:45,182
I'm not gonna have
a temperature.

26
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:48,162
You can't have gallstones.
You're too young.

27
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,352
However unlikely,
it is happening. It's...

28
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,873
- Ninety-nine.
You're fine, Missy.

29
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:06,849
- You don't wanna leave anything
up to chance. I could be contagious.

30
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:18,781
What?

31
00:04:19,763 --> 00:04:21,637
Uh, nothing.

32
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:24,141
You got gallstones?

33
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,347
I had the flu last week.

34
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,603
Must go around.

35
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:34,379
- Hardy, how's
your bowel movements?

36
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:38,981
- S-standard bowel movements.
- Still have the diarrhoea?

37
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:41,599
No.

38
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,292
It was a one-time thing.

39
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,289
It was a one-time thing.

40
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:51,869
I don't... I don't even know
why she brought it up.

41
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:53,893
It was a field trip,
like, a week ago.

42
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:56,434
It's a long story.
They're normal now.

43
00:04:56,935 --> 00:04:58,534
What about you, Lake?

44
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:05,794
Well, Mom's in the Turks and
Caicos and Dad is in the cemetery.

45
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:09,926
I'll trust that you are safe
to drive yourself?

46
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:11,667
- Yup.

47
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,667
- I-I'll see you tomorrow.

48
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,794
Feel... feel better.

49
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:40,090
- Come on, Walt.

50
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,036
Come on.

51
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:47,837
- Don't feed him too fast.
He'll bloat.

52
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,393
- He's not.

53
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:53,397
- I can hear him eating
too fast. Walter, baby!

54
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:56,363
He's fine, Ma.
It's okay. Really.

55
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,531
Ma, we talked about smoking
in the house, right?

56
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:04,340
Walt's been moving funny.
He's moving funny.

57
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:07,752
I know, yeah.

58
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:10,613
I-I'll get him checked out.
Don't worry about it.

59
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:14,291
I could've sworn I made dinner.

60
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,993
Don't worry about it.
I ate at work.

61
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:18,502
No, no, no, I'll whip you up
something special.

62
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:22,792
- You don't have to. Really.
- I got it.

63
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,753
- Hardy, I don't know what to say.

64
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:56,925
There's a tumour...
pressing on the nerve.

65
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,025
It's back cancer.

66
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:04,660
Walter, it looks like
he's had a really good life.

67
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:06,988
Like he's been really loved.

68
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:12,886
That's the problem with dogs:
they don't live long enough.

69
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:17,688
Look, I... I know
that you can fix this.

70
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,214
Okay?
It's not even a question.

71
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:24,360
My neighbour, Franklin, had orthopaedic
surgery to replace his femoral head.

72
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,261
Walter's half the geriatric he is.

73
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,797
If you're gonna do the surgery,
I would do it immediately.

74
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,239
In two weeks,
he won't be able to walk.

75
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:37,106
Okay, and how much...
how much will that cost?

76
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:40,668
Around $10,000.

77
00:07:49,114 --> 00:07:52,383
Is there some kind of payment
plan that we can do for that?

78
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:21,430
- You're doing it wrong.
- What's the difference?

79
00:09:21,472 --> 00:09:24,321
There's a right way
and a wrong way.

80
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,564
Who cares about a little thing?

81
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,542
I do.

82
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,132
I sleep in this bed.

83
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:35,001
You're sure
you're not just a volunteer?

84
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:38,056
I volunteer and they give me
a place to sleep.

85
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:41,019
Come on! Really?

86
00:09:41,434 --> 00:09:42,898
Yeah.

87
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:46,130
Well, what do you do?

88
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,267
I'm a stripper.

89
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:58,899
Don't take this the wrong way,

90
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:01,542
but you're way too hot
to be in your position.

91
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:03,352
Stage fright.

92
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,795
Stage fright
doesn't really explain it.

93
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:08,340
I have a cool way to do this.

94
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,913
Alright.

95
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:18,378
Gonna blow your mind.

96
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,312
Okay, grab my biceps.

97
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:24,542
Just grab my...

98
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,313
You are not flexing right now.
Come on.

99
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:29,128
- I'm not. That's all me.

100
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:32,290
You don't even wanna see flexing.

101
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,526
Alright, here we go.
So on three, pull, okay?

102
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,201
One, two, three.

103
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:41,112
Not bad.

104
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:42,979
It's kinda cool.

105
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:45,675
Kinda cool? That's awesome!

106
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:57,815
I'm here by choice.
To answer your question.

107
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:00,954
So you're a psychopath.

108
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:03,156
That figures. Typical.

109
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:06,314
- I see you've met
our most unspoken visitor.

110
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:09,740
Well, not yet, actually.
I'm Hardy.

111
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:12,283
Nice to meet you, Hardy. Bo.

112
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,297
- I need to steal her
for a second.

113
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:17,377
Okay, yeah.

114
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,693
Yeah, could you...?

115
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:21,185
Oh, you wanna steal her
right here?

116
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,060
- Yeah. Give us a little...
- Okay.

117
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:25,569
- Thank you.
- I'm not... I wouldn't...

118
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:30,297
This guy in the rec room,
same dude...

119
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:33,297
I think he'll be back.

120
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:36,568
Don't believe what he says.

121
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,664
I don't want to, but the things
he's saying are pretty heavy.

122
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:42,568
You're one of the good guys,
right?

123
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,943
Yeah.

124
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:46,185
Just stall for me again, please?

125
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:47,680
Okay, what are you gonna do?

126
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:49,646
I'm gonna get outta here,
that's what I'm gonna do.

127
00:11:49,688 --> 00:11:53,156
- You don't have to do that.
- It's okay. Thank you.

128
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,272
Alright,
I think that's it for me.

129
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:09,559
- Where you going?
- Home.

130
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,735
Where's home?

131
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:13,369
East.

132
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,758
That way.

133
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:17,969
It sounds nice.

134
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:22,398
It's just...
it's totally nice. It's... cool.

135
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:28,248
Do you think I could maybe
come home with you?

136
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,158
They're out of beds for tonight,
so I'm kinda stuck.

137
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:36,007
Really?

138
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:37,960
Why not?

139
00:12:38,806 --> 00:12:41,062
Well, you could be, like,
a psychopath,

140
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:44,811
a crazy psychopath, for one.
- Is that right?

141
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:48,654
Or, um, I could be, like,
a totally mean rapist.

142
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:51,887
Opposed to a really nice rapist?

143
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,329
I could just be a rapist.
That's all I'm trying to say.

144
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,403
I could take you.

145
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:06,577
Okay.

146
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,249
- Yeah?
- Yeah...

147
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,518
Sure, why not? It'd be fun.

148
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:14,470
Just don't get the wrong idea.

149
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:18,928
I think I already have
the wrong idea.

150
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:26,498
That's Walt.

151
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:29,602
Hiya, Walter.

152
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:31,766
You're a cutie.

153
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:35,365
Oh, God, you didn't tell me
we were having company tonight.

154
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:37,834
- Look at me.
- You look fine, Ma. You look good.

155
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:40,037
Bo, Ma.
Ma, Bo.

156
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,618
- It's nice to meet you.
- You, too.

157
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:44,173
Bo's a stripper.

158
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:48,331
He... he always had
such an imagination.

159
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:49,685
I bet.

160
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:51,993
Bo's going to stay
for the night.

161
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:56,035
- If that's okay with you.
- Okay. Of course it's okay.

162
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:59,860
You're the first girl
Hardy's ever had over.

163
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:03,204
That's not true. Come on.

164
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,647
- So...

165
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,553
...how was your day?

166
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:18,865
- Shit.
- Ugh. Shush.

167
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:20,795
Not in front
of your girlfriend, honey.

168
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,771
- Oh, we're not...
- Unless...

169
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:24,979
No.

170
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:27,274
Okay.

171
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:29,984
- You don't go
to Hardy's school, do you?

172
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:33,810
No, I'm out of school.
I'm currently looking for work.

173
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:36,419
Oh, I know that's hard.

174
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,248
What line of work were you in?

175
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,029
I-I told you, Ma.

176
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:45,935
- She's a stripper.
- Well, you have the body for one.

177
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:47,476
Thank you, Lorna.

178
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,820
So are you two
wearing protection?

179
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:55,810
Come on, Ma, come on!

180
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,312
In this economy, you never know.

181
00:14:58,354 --> 00:15:00,193
That doesn't even make sense.

182
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:02,420
What does the economy have to do
with wearing protection?

183
00:15:02,462 --> 00:15:04,701
It has everything to do with it.

184
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:07,178
Raise a kid in a decline?
No, you don't!

185
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,701
The economy's not responsible
for everything we do.

186
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,795
- He's just mad
that he got canned this week.

187
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:14,307
- Ma!
- Can't keep his mouth shut.

188
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:17,771
I wonder where I get it from.

189
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:23,723
You two are very cute.

190
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:25,925
Thank you, Bo.

191
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,027
You can come over
for dinner anytime.

192
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:31,503
Okay, please, guys, enough.

193
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:35,112
- Mom, how was Walt today?
- Oh, you know Walter.

194
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:38,655
He's the sweetest little baby
I ever did see.

195
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:42,464
- He's sick, though.
- What's wrong with him?

196
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:45,246
He's walking kinda funny.
He can't poop.

197
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:47,317
- Poor guy.
- I'm gonna go feed him.

198
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,902
- You do that.
- Come on, boy, let's go,

199
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:50,425
let's go get you
something to eat. Come on!

200
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,378
- He actually listens...
- Come on, food's over here.

201
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,854
- Let's go. Let's go.
- He's so cute.

202
00:15:56,677 --> 00:16:00,818
- Thanks again for letting me stay.
- Of course, of course.

203
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:03,456
Frankly, I'm relieved.

204
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:05,191
Why's that?

205
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:08,482
Hardy's always been
a little light in the loafers.

206
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:14,393
Do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

207
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:17,318
It's just down the hall.
The room with the toilet in it.

208
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:18,910
You can't miss it.

209
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:22,435
Unless, of course, you do!

210
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:06,337
Okay, buddy, okay, okay, okay.

211
00:17:07,183 --> 00:17:09,017
Oh, what's that?

212
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:12,485
Look.

213
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:18,814
Come on,
you've gotta eat something.

214
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:26,274
Come on, look,
this is delicious.

215
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:28,550
I know you like it.

216
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:49,462
You can spit it out.

217
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:52,404
That was disgusting.

218
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,446
Next time,
try the pickled herring.

219
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:56,706
It's really good.

220
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,602
- Y'know, your name
doesn't sound very Jewish.

221
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:01,663
- I'm not really Jewish.

222
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,133
Not really.

223
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:05,139
I'm not that religious.

224
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:08,827
So what are you, like,
half-Jewish or something?

225
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:10,834
Yeah, well, it started...

226
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:14,139
When I was younger,
my ma confused the holidays.

227
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:17,774
She thought that Eight Crazy
Nights was a Beatles song.

228
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:20,108
And then it kinda went off
from there.

229
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,906
We put up a Hanukah bush
and got into the holiday spirit.

230
00:18:23,948 --> 00:18:25,779
So you're Jewish by default.

231
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:28,615
Most of my life is by default.

232
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,905
Jesus.

233
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:43,970
That's not right.

234
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:47,520
That's... You shouldn't...
encourage him.

235
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,256
So what's wrong with the dog?

236
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,828
- He's got problems.
- I know. Like what?

237
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:56,664
He needs a surgery
that I can't afford.

238
00:18:56,706 --> 00:18:58,662
Until I get that worked out...

239
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,904
Isn't he a little old
for surgery?

240
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:02,670
- So what?

241
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:04,970
No, I mean, I'm just saying.

242
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:07,592
Why don't you pawn that?

243
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:10,373
It's a relic.
Doesn't even tick.

244
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,530
- Who gave it to you?

245
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:13,834
Just some dude.

246
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:16,100
Plus my mom needs Walt.

247
00:19:16,142 --> 00:19:18,920
It's... I'm gonna be gone
in a couple of months,

248
00:19:18,962 --> 00:19:20,944
so what else is she gonna have?

249
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:22,045
Y'know?

250
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:25,489
You can get her
another dog, or a fish.

251
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,264
A little Jewish herring.

252
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,405
It's not just the... company.
It's not about that.

253
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:32,726
It's Walt.

254
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,307
He gives her a purpose.

255
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:39,290
Like, my mom is afraid
to leave our property.

256
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:42,225
She doesn't leave our house, ever.

257
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:46,545
So without Walt there, I'm afraid
to even think what she would do.

258
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:48,115
Where's Dad?

259
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:51,436
You're the nosiest date
I ever had. A lot of questions.

260
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:53,282
You bring them all here?

261
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:56,731
Uh, he left when my mom
was pregnant.

262
00:19:57,689 --> 00:20:00,266
He's just some dude.
He's not my dad.

263
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,313
Some dude, huh?

264
00:20:02,582 --> 00:20:04,649
That sucks. I'm sorry.

265
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:07,844
So what's your deal?

266
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:10,975
Did your dad touch you
or something?

267
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:12,600
You know, you're a real gem
to talk to.

268
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:14,678
Well, I don't know.
I'm asking.

269
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,858
He did not touch me, no. Uh...

270
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,412
Three weeks ago,
I walked out of a hospital.

271
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,561
You know, the...
the crazy one?

272
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:26,462
I knew you were a psychopath.

273
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:27,959
I was...

274
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,764
- I was a little messed up.
- You... you're crazy.

275
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:34,253
I was a little messed up,
but I'm totally fine now.

276
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:37,201
You know what?
If you're gonna kill me...

277
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:38,725
do me a favour.

278
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:40,733
Have sex with me first?

279
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,545
It'll be the highlight of my life.
You'll forget it right away.

280
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:46,758
I'm not comfortable
dying a virgin. I'm serious.

281
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:49,897
Maybe we should just try
to find you a nice girl.

282
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:51,358
- A nice girl.

283
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,100
What's the point?

284
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:55,209
All the women in my life
are crazy.

285
00:20:58,462 --> 00:20:59,859
Little shit.

286
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,063
It's not funny!

287
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:07,920
Little assholes.

288
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,921
- Hey, guys.

289
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,491
Here

290
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:46,344
Least I could do.

291
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:50,287
Did you just blow him?

292
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:52,395
You got problems, you know that?

293
00:21:54,332 --> 00:21:57,196
This is 50 bucks!
What did you do?

294
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,427
Showed 'em my tits.

295
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,928
How many tits do you have?

296
00:22:04,821 --> 00:22:06,318
Alright, look, I'm not an idiot.

297
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,115
Clearly you're dealing with stuff
outside of a cuckoo's nest.

298
00:22:09,157 --> 00:22:10,647
Disgruntled boyfriend,

299
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:11,710
pimp problems...

300
00:22:11,752 --> 00:22:13,545
Strippers don't have pimps.

301
00:22:13,587 --> 00:22:16,373
Yeah, strippers don't all hang out
with guys like me, either.

302
00:22:16,415 --> 00:22:19,305
Tsss. What are you getting at?

303
00:22:20,243 --> 00:22:22,678
This is a great idea.
This is a really good idea.

304
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,646
You're gonna make us
some serious money.

305
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:25,920
No, I'm not.

306
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:27,506
Yeah, you are.

307
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:30,623
Those guys, they're gonna back to school,
they're gonna tell everybody.

308
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:33,085
By the end of the day,
the entire student body is gonna know

309
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,586
you flashed that little douchebag.

310
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:37,017
- Oops.

311
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,490
No. Eureka, not oops.

312
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:41,265
This is amazing.

313
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:42,967
We'll split everything 50/50,

314
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:45,334
it'll be the easiest money
you and I have ever made.

315
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:47,529
I can save money for Walt.

316
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:49,959
You can extend
your little vacation.

317
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,967
- I already made 50 bucks.

318
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:54,843
Yeah, but that's not gonna last.

319
00:22:55,837 --> 00:22:57,279
They're kids.
I'm not gonna do that.

320
00:22:57,321 --> 00:22:59,498
They're not kids.
What difference does it make?

321
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,092
It was a one-time thing.
I'm not gonna...

322
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:04,498
You did it...
Bo, you did it once.

323
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,467
I'm... I-I mean,

324
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:09,643
I need you here, y'know.
What else are you gonna do?

325
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:19,469
Actually, do you think you can
get me some Xanax or Valium?

326
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:23,178
Is that...
for the crazy thing?

327
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,055
No, I just... have trouble
sleeping, so that helps.

328
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:30,943
Yeah... Well, yeah, um,
that stuff's like Pez at school.

329
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:32,451
No problem.

330
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:35,087
Okay.

331
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,048
Okay.

332
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:40,543
Steady.

333
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:43,579
Just... Alright.

334
00:24:00,645 --> 00:24:03,080
She's in the shower.
Can't miss her.

335
00:24:22,814 --> 00:24:24,088
- Hi.

336
00:24:24,706 --> 00:24:26,036
Sorry.

337
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,196
No touching, no photos.

338
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:49,370
No touching the girl,
no touching yourself.

339
00:25:15,308 --> 00:25:17,576
Is there something wrong?

340
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,807
That's your problem right there.

341
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:35,166
You can't expect her to give you oral sex
if you're not willing to give it back.

342
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,103
- Right. Uh-huh.
- It's a two-way street.

343
00:25:37,145 --> 00:25:39,882
She wants it.
All girls do.

344
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:41,746
- Really?
- Really.

345
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:45,392
I mean, and it's like, you know,
like just a balance.

346
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:47,604
You have to be willing.

347
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,361
We want what you want, you know?

348
00:25:50,403 --> 00:25:52,025
Are you guys crazy?!

349
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:55,293
A naked girl wasn't enough?!

350
00:25:56,942 --> 00:25:59,777
- Yo! Dean Clark's coming!
- Oh, shit!

351
00:26:20,974 --> 00:26:23,916
That was great.
That was incredible!

352
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,518
You were...
you were something else.

353
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,919
Oh, my God.

354
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,775
They weren't that interested in
me, they just wanted a story.

355
00:26:31,747 --> 00:26:33,245
Well, they got one.

356
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,848
We just made 500 bucks.

357
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:38,063
Here's your half.

358
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:41,309
And some of that garbage you like.

359
00:26:42,246 --> 00:26:44,026
You can rest comfortably.

360
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,115
Alright.

361
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,575
You like to be clean.

362
00:27:19,198 --> 00:27:21,466
Okay. Go.

363
00:27:46,528 --> 00:27:49,207
- Hardy, may I speak with you?

364
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,676
No.

365
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,032
It's of extreme importance
I talk to you.

366
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:01,847
It's about your friend.

367
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,220
Alright. Sit.

368
00:28:09,703 --> 00:28:12,063
I have a business proposal
for you.

369
00:28:12,105 --> 00:28:16,724
The country club I'm a member of
is hosting a function on Saturday night.

370
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:19,213
All members of the club
will attend,

371
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:21,522
but most importantly,
my father will be there.

372
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:24,963
It's set to be quite a night,

373
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:27,705
but I'm afraid I don't have
a date for it.

374
00:28:29,106 --> 00:28:31,426
Dude, you're, like,
14 years old.

375
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:35,330
- My chips.
- Fifteen.

376
00:28:37,738 --> 00:28:39,871
My girl won't be into it.

377
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:42,789
I have $1,000.

378
00:28:43,466 --> 00:28:44,934
Two thousand.

379
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:46,403
No.

380
00:28:46,615 --> 00:28:48,153
$1,500.

381
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:50,049
No.

382
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:51,356
Well...

383
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,379
1,200.

384
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,408
Deal.

385
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,446
If you get frisky,
in any way imaginable,

386
00:29:02,488 --> 00:29:05,463
I'm gonna call up
her pimp/boyfriend thug.

387
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:08,603
He's gonna come rip your 14-year-old
hairless testicles right off.

388
00:29:08,645 --> 00:29:10,064
I'm actually 15.

389
00:29:10,106 --> 00:29:13,675
Your 15-year-old
hairless testicles right off.

390
00:29:14,177 --> 00:29:16,924
- Put 'em in your own mouth.
- But I thought she was a stripper.

391
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:18,675
Ex-stripper, yeah.

392
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:20,567
Strippers don't have pimps.

393
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:23,229
I know that.

394
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:26,169
Think I don't know that?
My client...

395
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:29,690
- I'll be a complete gentleman.
- Good.

396
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:33,541
Money... 1,300 now.

397
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,500
Jesus, what are you doing?

398
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:09,736
You could've called!

399
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:11,275
I don't have a cellphone.

400
00:30:11,317 --> 00:30:13,697
People from Zimbabwe
have cellphones.

401
00:30:13,731 --> 00:30:16,224
Yeah, people from Zimbabwe
have friends.

402
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:19,228
What do you do all day?

403
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,502
What do you mean?

404
00:30:20,544 --> 00:30:25,014
I mean this isn't a fun town.
Not a lot of attractions.

405
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,942
- I find stuff to do.
- Like what?

406
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:31,682
- I... walk around, I...

407
00:30:31,724 --> 00:30:34,997
I wander into people's backyards
and watch them.

408
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,096
That's like the creepiest
thing I've ever heard.

409
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:40,263
I'm living in the moment.
That's all you need to know.

410
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:43,855
Wait. Seriously, is this part
of, like, a 12-step program?

411
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:46,252
Like, part of the crazy thing?

412
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:49,822
Is it part of the crazy thing?
'Cause that can't be your actual plan.

413
00:30:49,864 --> 00:30:53,159
Like, you can't plan on being
a creep forever, you know?

414
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:56,603
But, seriously, do you have
any other solidified stuff besides that?

415
00:30:56,645 --> 00:31:00,017
- Like a five-, 10-year plan?
- You are so annoying.

416
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,072
- Uh...

417
00:31:01,114 --> 00:31:03,142
Okay, you were right
the first time.

418
00:31:03,184 --> 00:31:04,635
There's someone who's looking for me

419
00:31:04,677 --> 00:31:07,215
and I'd appreciate it
if you didn't bring it up again.

420
00:31:10,698 --> 00:31:13,099
Have you been in a towel
this whole time?

421
00:31:14,317 --> 00:31:15,818
Yes.

422
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:20,682
Well, if that's the case, you kinda
backed yourself into a corner.

423
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:23,234
I mean, Long Island's
a cul-de-sac.

424
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:25,140
Should've gone west.

425
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:27,292
Yeah, well, I don't really
have any money right now,

426
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:29,739
- so I'm kinda stuck.
- Exactly.

427
00:31:30,144 --> 00:31:32,161
That's why I came.

428
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:39,847
Bo, I have a rare and unique
business opportunity for us.

429
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:42,607
Does it involve
playing with my clothes?

430
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:46,630
Well, yeah. But this time,
you're playing dress-up.

431
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:48,705
Oh, my God, even scarier.

432
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:52,882
A Cavalier freshman
has acquiesced for your hand.

433
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,579
You used that word incorrectly.

434
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:58,342
Which one?

435
00:31:59,154 --> 00:32:00,432
Never mind.

436
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:03,341
You know, I'd rather not.

437
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:12,705
- That is $600. And some
of that garbage you like.

438
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:14,237
Now, that's half.

439
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:17,074
You'd be his date
to his country-club ball.

440
00:32:17,116 --> 00:32:20,401
You eat nice food,
you dress nice, you smile.

441
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:22,343
Easy money!

442
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:25,807
What's in it for me?

443
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:28,282
I have this room
for the next week.

444
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:32,280
- Goodbye.
- Good... goodbye?

445
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:33,748
- Goodbye.
- Bo, no!

446
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,487
Bo, it's just one night.
All you have to do is show up.

447
00:32:36,512 --> 00:32:38,739
You don't even have to do
anything, the clothes stay on...

448
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:40,809
- Get up.
- Bo...

449
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,998
Will you please help me?

450
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:48,971
If we're in this together,

451
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:51,013
then you're coming
and you're bringing a date.

452
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,778
Jaime wouldn't like that.

453
00:32:55,091 --> 00:32:56,411
Who's Jaime?

454
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:00,282
- It's your date.
- Not if you don't man up.

455
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:02,674
You want me to go,

456
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:05,708
then you're coming too
and you're bringing a date.

457
00:33:07,982 --> 00:33:10,650
Here. You can call here.

458
00:33:28,286 --> 00:33:30,855
- <i>Hello?</i> - Hi.
C-can I speak to Tito, please?

459
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,126
A girl! Come on.

460
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:54,050
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi. May I speak...

461
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:56,027
please speak with Lake?

462
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:58,182
- It-it's Hardy.
<i>- Hold on.</i>

463
00:34:00,795 --> 00:34:04,364
<i>La, there's a boy named Hardy
on the phone for you.</i>

464
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:10,073
What do you want?

465
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:15,752
Look. I know we don't talk much...
but I'd like to change that.

466
00:34:15,794 --> 00:34:19,026
Um... the River's having a thing
tomorrow night,

467
00:34:19,068 --> 00:34:21,246
and I was hoping
that we could go together.

468
00:34:21,288 --> 00:34:22,815
Country clubs aren't my thing.

469
00:34:22,857 --> 00:34:25,371
Yeah, no, me either.
They... they suck.

470
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:26,823
So why are you going?

471
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:30,908
Uh... a friend had asked me to
go and to bring somebody, so...

472
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,112
- Is this friend a girl?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

473
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,981
She a prostitute?

474
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:37,550
No.

475
00:34:37,747 --> 00:34:39,544
<i>She a stripper?</i>

476
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,113
Ex-stripper.

477
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:43,990
Yeah, h-how did you know?

478
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,716
People are talking.

479
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,495
Nice.

480
00:34:47,537 --> 00:34:49,502
<i>Not if the wrong people hear.</i>

481
00:34:49,544 --> 00:34:52,690
Okay, well, I can't worry
about that right now. I just...

482
00:34:52,732 --> 00:34:55,010
All I need is for you
to be my date.

483
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:58,520
Please come, Lake. It can be a
really great waste of time.

484
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,675
Fine.

485
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,870
Great!

486
00:35:03,912 --> 00:35:06,737
Aw-awesome!
Okay, uh-uh-um...

487
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:08,505
I'll pick you up...

488
00:35:09,294 --> 00:35:10,947
at 7:00.
I'll pick you up at 7:00?

489
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:15,255
- I'll just meet you there.
- <i>You will. Okay. Even better.</i>

490
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:17,770
Wow, we're...

491
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:19,966
Hello?

492
00:35:23,953 --> 00:35:25,320
Alright.

493
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,106
Not bad.

494
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:47,476
Hey, Ma,
why is Walt's hair in my comb?

495
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:49,985
Why do you think?
I was brushing him.

496
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:52,142
But there's a dog brush for that.

497
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:54,048
Quit busting my chops.

498
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:01,281
Ma, why is there dog hair
in my toothbrush?

499
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:03,812
I said I was brushing him.

500
00:36:03,854 --> 00:36:05,635
Well, yeah, what part of him
did you brush?

501
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,047
All of him.
His teeth, his hair.

502
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:10,362
Quit busting my chops.

503
00:36:11,057 --> 00:36:14,523
Ma, there's dog stuff for dogs

504
00:36:14,565 --> 00:36:16,594
and people stuff for people.

505
00:36:16,636 --> 00:36:17,937
- He's an equal.

506
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:20,200
Do not treat him any different.

507
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:21,308
Ah.

508
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,368
Where'd it go?

509
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,096
Where's my nail?

510
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,820
Alright, Ma,
you sure you got him?

511
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:35,797
I got it, baby, I got it.

512
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,144
- I fed him,
so he's good with that.

513
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:41,203
And, Ma, please don't try
to cook anything.

514
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:44,854
I won't!
Quit busting my chops!

515
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:45,955
- Okay.

516
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,651
Oh, I'm fine. Love you.
Get outta here, would you?

517
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,388
- How are you tonight, Miss?
- Fine.

518
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:30,680
I have itchy boobs.

519
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:42,094
- Well, of course you're not gonna wear it tonight.
You never wear anything I get you, huh?

520
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:44,017
- Stop, stop!
You're making a scene.

521
00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:47,475
Andre you must stop.
- Always complaining, I must buy you a dress

522
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,260
and you didn't even wear it.

523
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:51,990
You're crazy. You're crazy!

524
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,772
You... you look great.

525
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:05,913
Are you wearing perfume?

526
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:11,645
I thought it was gender neutral.

527
00:38:11,687 --> 00:38:13,320
- I can smell it.

528
00:38:20,749 --> 00:38:22,977
Would you stop looking at me
like that?

529
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:24,518
- Like what?

530
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,322
I dunno, like a puppy
that needs to be let out to make.

531
00:38:28,632 --> 00:38:31,334
- What do you mean?
- It's desperate.

532
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,380
Sorry, well...

533
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:37,804
- Don't apologize.
- S-sorry. My bad.

534
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:45,048
What's wrong?

535
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:49,176
I've got a bully for a dad.

536
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:54,466
You are trembling.
Just... relax, okay? Breathe.

537
00:38:54,508 --> 00:38:56,225
Forget him.

538
00:38:57,374 --> 00:39:01,137
People are always telling you
to become something, but...

539
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:03,335
life is about being.

540
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:06,616
It's about... right now.

541
00:39:07,437 --> 00:39:10,796
You're holding me,
we're dancing.

542
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:19,158
Okay, yeah, lesson learned.

543
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,895
- That was quick.

544
00:39:23,937 --> 00:39:26,319
- Hope he doesn't want
his money back.

545
00:39:26,843 --> 00:39:29,265
What are you, like, her pimp?

546
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:32,336
Think of it more
like a fundraiser.

547
00:39:32,593 --> 00:39:34,223
It's not a career choice.

548
00:39:34,265 --> 00:39:37,030
Well, that's good,
'cause I think it's pretty low.

549
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:40,280
Why is it low?
I'm not hurting anybody.

550
00:39:40,472 --> 00:39:42,105
Says who?

551
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,517
You wanna go dance or something?

552
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:49,794
Why, do you want to?

553
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:51,184
Well, no, not really.

554
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:52,450
Then we won't dance.

555
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:54,293
I do wanna dance.

556
00:39:54,335 --> 00:39:57,457
I just don't know... how...
how to dance.

557
00:39:57,499 --> 00:40:02,042
What does being able to dance actually
have to do with dancing, Hardy?

558
00:40:02,757 --> 00:40:04,902
It doesn't, I guess.

559
00:40:06,711 --> 00:40:08,530
I can't dance.

560
00:40:13,406 --> 00:40:15,207
- So you wanna go dance?
- Mm-hmm.

561
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:17,282
- Okay.
- Yeah, fine.

562
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,950
- Hey.
- Shit. God!

563
00:41:37,992 --> 00:41:39,528
- Sorry.
Did I scare you?

564
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,981
- You scared the shit out of me.

565
00:41:41,023 --> 00:41:42,792
- Sorry.

566
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,004
- Mind if I join you?
It's stuffy in there.

567
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:49,513
- Sure.

568
00:41:59,577 --> 00:42:01,319
You're so pretty.

569
00:42:01,614 --> 00:42:04,448
I can see why everyone's
talking about you.

570
00:42:04,968 --> 00:42:07,437
- Yeah, it's a small town.
- I know.

571
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,722
Don't you find that annoying?

572
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:13,171
It's alright.

573
00:42:20,531 --> 00:42:21,879
What?

574
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:26,621
It's just you're so pretty
and you're so confident.

575
00:42:26,663 --> 00:42:29,231
And you're so cool
and in control.

576
00:42:29,273 --> 00:42:31,600
You people just need to relax.

577
00:42:31,642 --> 00:42:34,059
You're giving me heartburn.
Have a drink and relax.

578
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:36,684
- I can't.
- Sure, you can.

579
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:38,960
Just sit back and...

580
00:42:40,672 --> 00:42:42,319
You hear the crickets?

581
00:42:58,257 --> 00:43:00,972
I can't really talk
to my friends.

582
00:43:01,569 --> 00:43:05,671
Everyone is so judgmental
around here.

583
00:43:08,727 --> 00:43:13,314
As you grow up,
you learn whose opinion matters

584
00:43:13,356 --> 00:43:16,757
and... the rest of 'em,
who gives a fuck?

585
00:43:22,117 --> 00:43:25,039
- So it's curl for the girl...

586
00:43:26,585 --> 00:43:27,918
Just stop.

587
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,428
- Alright the Lord.
- Okay.

588
00:43:30,632 --> 00:43:31,999
So...

589
00:43:33,984 --> 00:43:36,985
...what was the whole idea
behind bringing me here?

590
00:43:38,898 --> 00:43:40,966
I just really wanted to see you.

591
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:45,410
I guess it's 'cause
you scare me.

592
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:48,335
That's an awful thing to say.

593
00:43:48,484 --> 00:43:49,943
- I didn't mean it like that.

594
00:43:49,985 --> 00:43:52,140
I meant it like a compliment.

595
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,598
Like, you don't act your age.

596
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,036
Like...

597
00:43:56,078 --> 00:43:58,863
you don't hang out
with other kids our age.

598
00:43:58,905 --> 00:44:02,186
You act like you already have
a bachelor's degree.

599
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,577
That stuff all makes you
really interesting.

600
00:44:09,281 --> 00:44:11,349
You're a cute kid, Hardy.

601
00:44:12,088 --> 00:44:14,679
You should be able to find
the right kind of girl.

602
00:44:20,936 --> 00:44:22,390
Yeah.

603
00:44:23,313 --> 00:44:25,382
I mean... yeah.

604
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,647
Cool car.
This is really awesome.

605
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:34,535
Yeah, my mom uses it
as a fashion statement.

606
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,155
Notice the yacht-club permits
on the window.

607
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:39,686
Right.

608
00:44:40,484 --> 00:44:42,152
Good night, Hardy.

609
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:45,632
See you around.

610
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:51,802
Drive safe!

611
00:44:51,844 --> 00:44:53,725
It's... it's dark.

612
00:44:55,398 --> 00:44:56,887
- Get inside.
Could you get inside?

613
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:58,966
- Lorna, hey, wake up!

614
00:44:59,008 --> 00:45:00,746
You're a nutbag, Lorna!

615
00:45:00,788 --> 00:45:02,398
- I'm calling the cops!
- Ma!

616
00:45:02,423 --> 00:45:04,357
- I'm calling the cops on her, Hardy!
- What are you doing?

617
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:05,418
No, it's my house.

618
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,637
You hear that, bitch?
It's my property.

619
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,770
You ain't the only one living
on this street, Lorna! You loon!

620
00:45:10,812 --> 00:45:14,645
- Come over here and say that.
- Ma, Ma, look at me. Stop, okay?

621
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,138
- It's time to go inside.
- Why? It's my house.

622
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:19,660
I can dress however I want,
bitch! You hear that?!

623
00:45:19,685 --> 00:45:21,513
Yeah, but you can't have
an open container on the street.

624
00:45:21,538 --> 00:45:24,442
- She likes it!
- Ma, she does not, okay?

625
00:45:24,484 --> 00:45:25,519
I knew it!!

626
00:45:25,561 --> 00:45:26,653
You crumbed all my flowers.

627
00:45:26,695 --> 00:45:28,979
You know how much time I spent
on the magnolias and you're crushing them.

628
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:31,838
- Here we go. One and two...
- Lesbian.

629
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,424
- Here, we're almost home, okay?
- Oh, God, please hurry.

630
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:36,799
Here you go.
Okay, bed sounds nice, right?

631
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:39,108
- I need to be horizontal.
- One, two...

632
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:44,821
Come on.
Good boy.

633
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:48,838
Okay.

634
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,309
- She made me so mad.
- Okay, Ma.

635
00:45:56,193 --> 00:45:57,972
Here you go.

636
00:45:58,014 --> 00:45:59,466
You got it?

637
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:18,446
Why can't you just stay
on track, Ma?

638
00:46:18,488 --> 00:46:20,589
What do you mean, baby?

639
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,313
What the doctor gave you,
it's gonna help.

640
00:46:24,987 --> 00:46:26,654
Healthy baby.

641
00:46:27,938 --> 00:46:30,823
- Where's my baby?
- I'm right here, Ma.

642
00:46:30,865 --> 00:46:33,869
- I mean Walter.
- He's asleep on the floor.

643
00:46:33,911 --> 00:46:36,863
Ah, such good babies.

644
00:46:36,905 --> 00:46:38,325
Such good...

645
00:46:44,357 --> 00:46:45,784
We gotta do something, Ma.

646
00:46:45,826 --> 00:46:49,739
We're not taking good care
of each other.

647
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:51,816
It'll be fine.

648
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:55,916
I'll be better.
I promise.

649
00:47:22,954 --> 00:47:25,022
Eat up. You'll feel better.

650
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:32,417
I'm so sick of this.

651
00:47:34,498 --> 00:47:36,966
Life isn't cooperating.

652
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:42,344
She's not gonna get any better.

653
00:47:42,615 --> 00:47:44,719
I can't help her.

654
00:47:45,372 --> 00:47:50,028
It's... like the more I try to do,
the more useless I feel.

655
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,723
It's... it's pathetic.
I can't do anything.

656
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,189
I can't do anything.

657
00:47:58,091 --> 00:48:00,604
Hey, you're such a useless
piece of shit,

658
00:48:00,646 --> 00:48:02,512
then why am I sitting here?

659
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:05,690
My dog's cute.

660
00:48:05,732 --> 00:48:07,825
He's not that cute.

661
00:48:10,435 --> 00:48:12,269
What about the girl?

662
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,900
I think I blew it.

663
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:19,802
Well, she showed up. That's like
half the battle right there.

664
00:48:21,052 --> 00:48:22,330
You think? Yeah?

665
00:48:22,372 --> 00:48:23,973
I know.

666
00:48:33,802 --> 00:48:34,886
Crap.

667
00:48:34,928 --> 00:48:36,473
What's wrong?
What's...

668
00:48:36,677 --> 00:48:38,956
I think I left my jacket
there last night.

669
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,437
At the club? It's Sunday.
The place is gonna be crowded.

670
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:43,729
- I know.
- I'm not going.

671
00:48:43,771 --> 00:48:46,179
Well, I gotta get it, so...

672
00:48:46,221 --> 00:48:49,661
- I'm goin'.
- I'll go with you. Alright.

673
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,202
Come in.

674
00:49:01,746 --> 00:49:04,387
Uh, good afternoon, Officer.

675
00:49:05,074 --> 00:49:07,735
Um, I was wondering
if maybe you could help me out.

676
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:10,649
I'm looking for my niece,

677
00:49:10,691 --> 00:49:13,610
and she's been missing
for a few weeks.

678
00:49:13,652 --> 00:49:16,286
Have you filled out
a missing-person report?

679
00:49:16,762 --> 00:49:19,739
Not in this town, I haven't, no.

680
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:22,970
Oh, and guess what.
I have a picture.

681
00:49:23,012 --> 00:49:26,247
We used to vacation around here
in this town.

682
00:49:26,488 --> 00:49:28,579
Hmm, pretty girl.

683
00:49:28,621 --> 00:49:32,019
- Yeah, thank God she doesn't
have my brother's nose.

684
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:34,250
Family trait.

685
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:38,556
Uh, anyway, listen, I talked
to a ticket-taker on the LIRR

686
00:49:38,598 --> 00:49:40,825
and he said
she could've gotten off

687
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:43,431
at half-a-dozen of these stops,
this being one.

688
00:49:43,473 --> 00:49:48,142
Alright, well, we'll have to have you
fill out a missing-person report.

689
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:51,852
Um, just give me a minute
to find one. It's been a while.

690
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:59,770
I've officially landed
in Mayberry.

691
00:50:03,238 --> 00:50:04,931
What's up, guys?

692
00:50:04,973 --> 00:50:06,439
Looking for her jacket.

693
00:50:06,481 --> 00:50:08,147
Hi, I'm Jason.

694
00:50:08,762 --> 00:50:11,485
- You look familiar.
- I, uh...

695
00:50:11,527 --> 00:50:14,074
I was, uh, in the locker room.

696
00:50:14,356 --> 00:50:16,115
- Huh.
- Is this it?

697
00:50:16,157 --> 00:50:19,712
Yes! Thank you.
You are a rock star.

698
00:50:19,754 --> 00:50:21,931
Wait. Please, actually,
I was wondering

699
00:50:21,973 --> 00:50:24,120
if I was ever
gonna see you again?

700
00:50:24,162 --> 00:50:25,189
Why?

701
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:26,759
Could... could we talk?

702
00:50:26,801 --> 00:50:30,270
- Her time is money, pal.
- How much?

703
00:50:31,848 --> 00:50:33,353
Um...

704
00:50:33,395 --> 00:50:36,163
We can talk first
and figure that out later.

705
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:38,782
- Is there someplace we could go?

706
00:50:38,824 --> 00:50:41,258
She's not going anywhere
I can't see her.

707
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:43,665
Let's get something straight
right now.

708
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,507
- How about here?

709
00:50:46,145 --> 00:50:48,941
Uh... do you have to be here,
Hardy?

710
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:53,073
Serious question?

711
00:50:53,548 --> 00:50:56,517
- When I explain the situation...
- Just give us a little privacy.

712
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,878
Okay?
Just for like a minute.

713
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,470
I don't like this guy at all.

714
00:51:01,512 --> 00:51:03,238
He's fine.

715
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,415
- He's got a stupid face.
- He doesn't...

716
00:51:05,457 --> 00:51:08,087
- He's got a stupid face.
- He has glasses, he's harmless.

717
00:51:08,129 --> 00:51:09,728
- Ahem.
- Come on, just go.

718
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:12,217
Like, a minute.
Relax.

719
00:51:18,307 --> 00:51:20,342
No, wait, wait, wait!

720
00:51:21,401 --> 00:51:22,796
How can you be mad about that?!

721
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:25,077
I went once! Behind the shed,
when nobody's here.

722
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,092
- Stop talking!
- Your parents aren't even here.

723
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,937
How can you be mad?
Are you serious?

724
00:51:28,979 --> 00:51:30,460
- We've talked about this
a million...

725
00:51:30,502 --> 00:51:32,906
- Guys, how you doing?
- Will you walk away, Hardy?

726
00:51:32,948 --> 00:51:35,359
What's up, man? She's just mad
at the world today.

727
00:51:35,401 --> 00:51:36,452
What'd I do?

728
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:39,577
I heard all about you guys
and that... prostitute!

729
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:42,070
- She's not a prostitute.
- See? I told you!

730
00:51:42,112 --> 00:51:44,612
Yeah, like I'm gonna believe him.

731
00:51:47,393 --> 00:51:48,874
You brought her here?

732
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:51,228
Yes. She's with Jason.

733
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,477
What is she doing with Jason?
He's a good guy!

734
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:57,274
He is a good guy. She's helping
him exorcise some demons.

735
00:51:57,316 --> 00:52:00,054
Now I think about it, I recommend
the two of you sit down with her.

736
00:52:00,096 --> 00:52:02,516
- Ah, very funny!
- What for?

737
00:52:02,558 --> 00:52:05,845
- Seems like you have a few
problems you need to deal with.

738
00:52:06,815 --> 00:52:09,054
- What does a hooker know?
- Not a hooker.

739
00:52:09,096 --> 00:52:12,171
Katy, she's not like us.
She's seen things, really.

740
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,062
- Mm.
- She's kinda smart, actually.

741
00:52:14,104 --> 00:52:16,681
- Very smart.
- How would you know?!

742
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,209
- I got high with her.
- What?! Argh!!!

743
00:52:22,853 --> 00:52:25,491
- Lot of energy.
- I lie, she hates me.

744
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:27,281
I tell the truth,
she hates me even more.

745
00:52:27,323 --> 00:52:28,741
But she'll come back.

746
00:52:28,783 --> 00:52:31,843
You had your turn, now it's mine.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

747
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:34,327
- Whoa, no, no, no!
- Katy, Katy, baby.

748
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:36,892
You think someone like that
comes cheap?

749
00:52:37,518 --> 00:52:40,424
- Fifty a head.
- Oh, no way!

750
00:52:41,377 --> 00:52:42,734
- Smith...

751
00:52:48,557 --> 00:52:50,429
Nice, man.
Thanks a lot.

752
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:52,170
- Enjoy!
- What?

753
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:57,008
Thattaway, Smithy.

754
00:53:01,033 --> 00:53:04,241
So what's the deal?
You seem pretty put together.

755
00:53:04,283 --> 00:53:06,499
I... confidentially speaking...

756
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:08,341
- Of course.

757
00:53:09,151 --> 00:53:10,749
Uh... Chrissy's
a close friend of mine.

758
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:14,171
She and I have the type of secrets
you can only share under water.

759
00:53:14,213 --> 00:53:15,999
She told me she talked to you.

760
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:19,546
She did. I'm not sure
how much help I was, but...

761
00:53:19,588 --> 00:53:21,642
- She's better for it, believe me.

762
00:53:22,276 --> 00:53:25,010
- Okay, so... what's up?

763
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,441
I think I might be possibly gay.

764
00:53:32,757 --> 00:53:35,103
So what's the problem?

765
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,366
Uh...

766
00:53:38,643 --> 00:53:41,711
It's a problem around here.
Believe me.

767
00:53:42,647 --> 00:53:45,585
Why do you take your clothes
off for those idiots?

768
00:53:45,627 --> 00:53:48,718
I'm studying the developmental
process of adolescent behaviour.

769
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,394
Smart!
See? I told you.

770
00:53:51,963 --> 00:53:54,724
He won't have sex with me
if he has to wear a condom.

771
00:53:54,766 --> 00:53:56,874
It's not the condom.
I'm gay.

772
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:58,781
My father plays golf
professionally

773
00:53:58,823 --> 00:54:01,284
and we just became members here.

774
00:54:01,326 --> 00:54:03,968
I was born in this country,
English is my first language.

775
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:06,062
I don't even understand Chinese,

776
00:54:06,104 --> 00:54:10,607
and still everyone looks at me here
like I built the fucking railroads.

777
00:54:11,393 --> 00:54:14,874
Woman to woman,
let's forget that he's here.

778
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:17,679
My parents want me
to date someone else.

779
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,906
Argh!
Tell her the truth!

780
00:54:18,948 --> 00:54:21,698
You're not supposed
to be here! Shhh!

781
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:25,697
They already have this...
person in mind.

782
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:28,140
- What are your parents like?
- Oh, it's like the Titanic.

783
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,829
Except Rose's mother,
in this case, spits fire.

784
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:32,679
Shut up, Smith!
You just want to be Leo!

785
00:54:32,721 --> 00:54:34,757
Yeah, who doesn't want to be Leo?

786
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:37,399
I keep having a recurring dream.

787
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,187
Just... me and my brother,

788
00:54:40,229 --> 00:54:43,377
we're on a beach,
and it's the end of the day.

789
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:46,804
And he decides he wants
to go for a swim.

790
00:54:46,846 --> 00:54:49,038
The waves get heavier...

791
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,088
and it's harder for my brother
to swim back.

792
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,663
And I watch him struggle...

793
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:56,752
to get back to shore.

794
00:54:57,619 --> 00:55:00,287
And when he finally
goes under...

795
00:55:03,108 --> 00:55:05,576
...I walk home.

796
00:55:09,611 --> 00:55:11,585
- I think you're stressing
not because you're gay,

797
00:55:11,627 --> 00:55:13,648
but because you like older men.

798
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:17,523
I mean, the boys around here
don't exactly exude sexual confidence.

799
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:20,399
There's literally
no one else around here.

800
00:55:20,596 --> 00:55:22,445
- You're like Professor Xavier.

801
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:26,257
There's a bunch of X-Men out there,
they just don't know they're X-Men yet.

802
00:55:26,299 --> 00:55:28,674
Believe me, there are more.

803
00:55:28,824 --> 00:55:31,187
My advice: go on the date.

804
00:55:31,229 --> 00:55:33,829
I'm not cool with that!

805
00:55:34,252 --> 00:55:36,122
- Go on the date?
- Smith.

806
00:55:36,164 --> 00:55:39,367
Jealousy and possession are two
of men's most primal instincts.

807
00:55:39,392 --> 00:55:41,389
But how do you think
you're gonna let a girl in

808
00:55:41,414 --> 00:55:43,427
if you're constantly worried
about letting her go?

809
00:55:43,469 --> 00:55:46,575
- So just let her cheat on me?
- Why am I cheating on you?

810
00:55:46,617 --> 00:55:48,944
- I'm not telling her
to be with the guy, just...

811
00:55:48,986 --> 00:55:50,849
go on the date,
make the parents happy,

812
00:55:50,891 --> 00:55:53,570
and then sneak out
the Smiths' for dessert.

813
00:55:57,438 --> 00:55:59,008
Alright.

814
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,078
- Okay.
- Okay!

815
00:56:02,102 --> 00:56:04,013
- Those are just thoughts.

816
00:56:04,055 --> 00:56:06,312
You're not crazy
and you're not alone.

817
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,730
Crazy people
don't know they're crazy.

818
00:56:09,086 --> 00:56:10,886
- Bonnie?

819
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:13,218
Who?

820
00:56:13,398 --> 00:56:14,953
Is that you?

821
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,249
I don't know anyone
by that name.

822
00:56:17,648 --> 00:56:21,724
You bear a striking resemblance to the
daughter of an old friend of mine.

823
00:56:21,766 --> 00:56:23,147
It's... uncanny.

824
00:56:23,189 --> 00:56:24,491
Must be your contacts.

825
00:56:24,533 --> 00:56:27,726
- I haven't seen you here before?
- Nope!

826
00:56:28,336 --> 00:56:30,804
Oh, can I ask for your name?

827
00:56:31,539 --> 00:56:33,139
Miss Von Teese.

828
00:56:33,844 --> 00:56:35,505
Pleasure, Miss Von Teese.

829
00:56:35,547 --> 00:56:37,054
Cliff Thomas.

830
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:40,021
We're kind of a in the middle
of something right now, Cliff.

831
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,796
If you don't mind.

832
00:56:42,204 --> 00:56:44,194
Sure, sure.

833
00:56:51,648 --> 00:56:53,739
I-I'm sorry,
I just remembered I...

834
00:56:53,781 --> 00:56:55,781
I have somewhere to be.

835
00:56:56,133 --> 00:56:57,882
I'm... I'm sorry.

836
00:57:06,992 --> 00:57:08,859
- What are you doing here?

837
00:57:19,664 --> 00:57:20,859
Yo!

838
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:27,343
- Dude, what the hell?
- What's going on?

839
00:57:29,148 --> 00:57:30,966
Your friend invited us over.

840
00:57:31,008 --> 00:57:34,140
- Where is she?
- They went to the swamp, bro.

841
00:57:34,251 --> 00:57:35,507
- They?

842
00:57:35,613 --> 00:57:38,210
Her and some other kids.
Man, get outta the way.

843
00:57:39,703 --> 00:57:42,200
Aren't parents gonna wonder
where everybody is?

844
00:57:42,242 --> 00:57:44,867
- Study group.
- What study group?

845
00:57:45,203 --> 00:57:47,942
The study group. The one
that gets us outta the house.

846
00:57:47,984 --> 00:57:51,192
This kid's been teaching me
American history all term.

847
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:53,890
I do what I can.

848
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:55,848
I do what I can.

849
00:58:09,563 --> 00:58:10,700
- You're it!

850
00:58:10,742 --> 00:58:12,664
- Bo, what's going on here?

851
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:14,747
One kid showed up, another one,

852
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:17,411
and then another one,
and someone brought beer.

853
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:20,263
- I don't get it.
- Kids are like penguins,

854
00:58:20,305 --> 00:58:22,661
constantly searching
for a place to chill.

855
00:58:22,703 --> 00:58:24,966
- Hey, who are you calling
a penguin?! Huh?

856
00:58:25,008 --> 00:58:27,554
Smith could never be a penguin
because they're monogamous!

857
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:29,403
Pfft, since when do you know
about penguins?

858
00:58:29,428 --> 00:58:31,599
You took me to see Happy Feet
for our anniversary!

859
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,908
Of course I did, baby.

860
00:58:35,602 --> 00:58:37,826
Oh, hey, Hardy, Lake is here.

861
00:58:37,868 --> 00:58:39,130
- So?

862
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:42,380
So don't play the innocent.
I know you two have a thing.

863
00:58:42,422 --> 00:58:43,700
- Did she say that?

864
00:58:43,742 --> 00:58:46,656
Dude, when are you gonna open
your eyes?

865
00:58:47,133 --> 00:58:48,817
- Wh-where is she right now?

866
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,692
Just over by the lake.

867
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:53,106
Go get her, dude!

868
00:58:54,096 --> 00:58:57,165
Relax, okay?
It's gonna be fine.

869
00:59:06,508 --> 00:59:08,185
Waiting on someone?

870
00:59:08,227 --> 00:59:09,630
- Here you go, babe.

871
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:11,296
Shit...

872
00:59:11,703 --> 00:59:13,218
Hey, Hardy.

873
00:59:14,242 --> 00:59:17,856
Hey, I was just gonna...
gonna give you some company, but...

874
00:59:17,898 --> 00:59:20,481
Sorry, this is Paul.
Paul, this is Hardy.

875
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:22,880
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- Nothing.

876
00:59:22,922 --> 00:59:26,114
Just looking for a...
place to chill out for a bit.

877
00:59:26,156 --> 00:59:28,857
That's cool, bro.
Join us, it's fine.

878
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:33,903
So Hardy, uh...
Paul's at Harvard.

879
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,474
That's where you wanna go,
right?

880
00:59:35,516 --> 00:59:37,389
MIT, actually.

881
00:59:37,431 --> 00:59:38,877
Oh, right next door.

882
00:59:38,919 --> 00:59:40,585
Yeah...

883
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:48,083
So how do you two know each other?
You go back or...?

884
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:51,934
Yeah, Lake and I used to,
uh, hang out together, y'know.

885
00:59:51,976 --> 00:59:54,278
I don't know
if you'd call it dating, but,

886
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,942
you know,
we had some good times.

887
00:59:55,984 --> 00:59:58,334
Yeah... good times, huh?

888
00:59:58,376 --> 00:59:59,771
We're friends.

889
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:01,867
Yeah, with... with benefits.

890
01:00:02,187 --> 01:00:04,747
- Frennies with bennies. Nice.
- Uh-huh.

891
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:06,304
Cool, man.

892
01:00:08,024 --> 01:00:10,478
I don't like
this guy at fucking all.

893
01:00:11,336 --> 01:00:13,771
He's got a stupid face.

894
01:00:13,813 --> 01:00:16,981
I think he may be retarded
or something.

895
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,778
- He's at Harvard.
- Bush went to Yale.

896
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,622
- Yeah, look, Hardy?
- Yeah.

897
01:00:21,664 --> 01:00:24,554
Why don't you take off, man,
before you end up in the brook?

898
01:00:24,758 --> 01:00:27,585
Let me tell you something.
That's a pond, Paul.

899
01:00:27,627 --> 01:00:29,528
A brook is a small stream
of water.

900
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:32,718
Last time I checked,
yep, that water's stagnant.

901
01:00:33,404 --> 01:00:34,820
Right.

902
01:00:35,228 --> 01:00:38,500
- Guys... grow up.
- Take a biology class, Paul.

903
01:00:38,814 --> 01:00:40,896
He is right.
It is... it is a pond.

904
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:43,334
Okay, Lake, you are way better
with your mouth shut.

905
01:00:43,376 --> 01:00:45,411
Whoa,
don't talk to her like that.

906
01:00:45,453 --> 01:00:49,060
What are you gonna do, man?
I play lacrosse, you dumb shit!

907
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:52,687
Fuck...

908
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,710
- Stop, stop!

909
01:00:57,547 --> 01:01:01,283
Hardy... hey, are you alright?

910
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:06,217
What?

911
01:01:08,949 --> 01:01:10,416
- Lake...

912
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:17,351
- Thanks.
- Yeah, sure.

913
01:01:19,913 --> 01:01:21,286
You're really playing lacrosse?

914
01:01:21,328 --> 01:01:23,395
Pfft! Yeah.

915
01:01:33,531 --> 01:01:35,244
Yeah, she's definitely gone.

916
01:01:35,648 --> 01:01:37,921
- Yeah, you fucked it up.
- Pfft!

917
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,903
Oh...!

918
01:01:49,766 --> 01:01:51,341
- 'Morning.

919
01:01:52,485 --> 01:01:54,083
Quit yelling.

920
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,614
Potassium and caffeine.

921
01:01:59,656 --> 01:02:01,757
It's an old college trick.

922
01:02:03,672 --> 01:02:05,478
You went to college?

923
01:02:06,118 --> 01:02:07,710
I dabbled.

924
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:17,476
- Um... here, you can...
you can take these.

925
01:02:17,518 --> 01:02:20,185
Sell them, whatever.
I'm done with them.

926
01:02:22,268 --> 01:02:24,125
Good for you.

927
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:26,634
I... I'm proud of you.

928
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:35,389
What are you doing?!
That's gonna make you pass out!

929
01:02:37,581 --> 01:02:38,820
Screw it!

930
01:02:38,862 --> 01:02:41,196
Don't you have school?

931
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,409
Yeah.

932
01:03:06,237 --> 01:03:07,941
Stupid fuck.

933
01:03:08,057 --> 01:03:10,205
Screw it. Fuck it.

934
01:03:12,026 --> 01:03:13,693
Come with me.

935
01:03:34,216 --> 01:03:37,285
Well, Hardy, I'm glad to see
you're comfortable.

936
01:03:38,056 --> 01:03:40,224
I'm sure you know
what this is about.

937
01:03:41,511 --> 01:03:44,643
Uh... no, I'm not sure.

938
01:03:45,893 --> 01:03:51,250
Over the weekend, I was awakened
by a very disturbing phone call

939
01:03:51,292 --> 01:03:54,258
regarding recent activities
that you were part of.

940
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,166
Now do you know?

941
01:03:58,862 --> 01:04:00,664
I think...

942
01:04:00,706 --> 01:04:02,539
- You think?

943
01:04:03,558 --> 01:04:06,148
Why don't you just go ahead
and please tell me...

944
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,422
why.

945
01:04:07,464 --> 01:04:09,711
A very distressed student
told me

946
01:04:09,753 --> 01:04:14,344
that you hired a woman
to bare herself

947
01:04:14,386 --> 01:04:17,541
in front of several
of our student body.

948
01:04:19,955 --> 01:04:21,346
Oh.

949
01:04:22,175 --> 01:04:23,730
Oh?

950
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,473
- I mean, um...

951
01:04:27,933 --> 01:04:30,898
Well, I'm clearly
very embarrassed by it...

952
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,307
I would assume you would be.

953
01:04:34,065 --> 01:04:35,243
Now, before we continue,

954
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:39,234
would you like to discuss anything
with Dr. Ruth in private?

955
01:04:40,089 --> 01:04:41,680
Uh, no, that's fine.

956
01:04:41,722 --> 01:04:43,255
Fine?

957
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:46,726
- No offence to Dr. Ruth,
of course, but I...

958
01:04:46,768 --> 01:04:48,476
I know that anything
I share with you,

959
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:51,703
you'll just turn around and share
with all the people present in this room,

960
01:04:51,745 --> 01:04:55,147
so I'll go out
and come out with it myself.

961
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:56,825
Go on.

962
01:04:59,737 --> 01:05:01,195
I'm sorry, where was I?

963
01:05:01,237 --> 01:05:02,313
The woman.

964
01:05:02,355 --> 01:05:03,940
The woman, thank you.

965
01:05:04,268 --> 01:05:05,976
Thank you. Um...

966
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:09,305
Well, the woman was wandering
around Main Street.

967
01:05:09,347 --> 01:05:11,633
I was lonely and I...

968
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:14,069
I just really wanted
someone to talk to...

969
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:15,516
Not that that's any excuse.

970
01:05:15,558 --> 01:05:18,055
I understand it was stupid
and it was very juvenile.

971
01:05:18,097 --> 01:05:23,117
Um, but I did not expect for her
to take it up with other students.

972
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:25,226
Was this on school grounds?

973
01:05:28,206 --> 01:05:29,742
Hardy?

974
01:05:29,784 --> 01:05:32,518
Did you bring her
onto school property?

975
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:39,068
Yes.

976
01:05:42,455 --> 01:05:46,805
I'm sorry, but...
unless the board disagrees,

977
01:05:46,847 --> 01:05:48,633
you are no longer
a member of this school.

978
01:05:48,675 --> 01:05:52,643
What you did was not only
juvenile, it was illegal!

979
01:05:54,003 --> 01:05:55,018
Tsk!

980
01:05:55,792 --> 01:05:59,680
School has a lot to discuss
and we will call upon you to clarify,

981
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:02,672
to help investigate
what can only be described as...

982
01:06:02,714 --> 01:06:06,149
as the lowest act of social
depravity I've ever seen here.

983
01:06:06,768 --> 01:06:10,330
I expect you to keep this
a private matter until then.

984
01:06:23,784 --> 01:06:24,836
Ugh!

985
01:06:26,628 --> 01:06:28,182
I'm sorry.

986
01:06:29,472 --> 01:06:31,430
Oh, oh! Hey.

987
01:06:31,472 --> 01:06:33,573
Kid! Listen, uh...

988
01:06:33,972 --> 01:06:36,335
Driving around Long Island's
like landing on the moon.

989
01:06:36,377 --> 01:06:38,547
I got no reception
and this cellphone is dying.

990
01:06:38,589 --> 01:06:40,689
Can you give me some directions?

991
01:06:41,472 --> 01:06:43,461
- No. No, thanks.
- Oh, hey, come on, man.

992
01:06:43,503 --> 01:06:45,039
I see that you're going
somewhere with your bike.

993
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:49,190
I'll give you a lift anywhere you're going
if you just help me out.

994
01:06:50,581 --> 01:06:52,820
Look, man, no offence,
but you kinda look like a weirdo

995
01:06:52,862 --> 01:06:54,266
and I'm not in the mood.

996
01:06:54,308 --> 01:06:57,209
- Tell you what:
I'll give you 50 bucks.

997
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:01,805
- You got anything bigger?

998
01:07:05,741 --> 01:07:07,426
Uh, yeah.

999
01:07:07,956 --> 01:07:09,916
I got a C-note.

1000
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:12,190
You know what a C-note is?

1001
01:07:18,155 --> 01:07:19,812
- Hey, man,
what is it you're looking for?

1002
01:07:19,854 --> 01:07:23,195
We've been driving for...
15-20 minutes now.

1003
01:07:23,237 --> 01:07:25,784
- I'm actually looking
for someone.

1004
01:07:26,808 --> 01:07:29,479
What, did you wife leave you
or something?

1005
01:07:30,408 --> 01:07:32,570
No, I'm looking for my niece.

1006
01:07:32,612 --> 01:07:34,578
Bonnie Newman.

1007
01:07:38,104 --> 01:07:40,461
- Have you seen her?
- No, no, I've never seen her.

1008
01:07:40,503 --> 01:07:41,914
- You sure?

1009
01:07:41,956 --> 01:07:45,252
Yeah. You wanna...
take that back.

1010
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:01,784
I don't respond well
to violence.

1011
01:08:02,183 --> 01:08:04,057
Neither do I.

1012
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:16,024
Look...

1013
01:08:18,097 --> 01:08:21,000
Listen...
Will you stop moving around?

1014
01:08:21,042 --> 01:08:23,104
You're like
a Mexican jumping bean.

1015
01:08:23,651 --> 01:08:25,717
More comfortable over here.

1016
01:08:26,683 --> 01:08:28,594
I'm looking for my niece.

1017
01:08:28,636 --> 01:08:31,664
I know she's here,
and I know you know where she is.

1018
01:08:31,706 --> 01:08:32,987
Where'd you even get that from?

1019
01:08:33,012 --> 01:08:35,256
You're completely twisted, man.
I don't know where she is.

1020
01:08:35,281 --> 01:08:38,672
- A friend of our family's
saw her at the country club

1021
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:40,750
talking to some kids
from your private school.

1022
01:08:40,792 --> 01:08:43,652
- I go to a very large private school.
That could be a number of people.

1023
01:08:43,677 --> 01:08:46,743
And your friends ratted you out.

1024
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,846
What do you want?

1025
01:08:54,165 --> 01:08:55,858
I want to take Bonnie home.

1026
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,935
She is not well.

1027
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,421
I don't know any Bonnie.

1028
01:09:00,463 --> 01:09:03,212
If I did, why would I tell you?

1029
01:09:10,392 --> 01:09:14,313
Bonnie escaped from a hospital
in Upstate New York three weeks ago.

1030
01:09:17,036 --> 01:09:19,720
- And you're her uncle?
- That's right.

1031
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,475
You got a lot of dough.

1032
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:25,415
That's right.

1033
01:09:25,614 --> 01:09:27,850
Let me ask you something
about... Bonnie.

1034
01:09:27,892 --> 01:09:30,077
Is she or is she not a stripper?

1035
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:31,226
Come again?

1036
01:09:31,268 --> 01:09:33,235
Never mind.
That's a stupid question.

1037
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:35,124
Look, man, I don't know
where she is right now.

1038
01:09:35,149 --> 01:09:37,290
But I can look for her.

1039
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:40,144
I... I promise.

1040
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,665
You have a family, right?

1041
01:09:44,869 --> 01:09:46,434
Yeah.

1042
01:09:46,654 --> 01:09:50,322
Well, I want you to think
about your family right now.

1043
01:09:51,371 --> 01:09:53,202
Because Bonnie...

1044
01:09:53,244 --> 01:09:55,511
she needs her family.

1045
01:09:57,158 --> 01:09:58,925
If you see her...

1046
01:10:02,587 --> 01:10:04,087
...call.

1047
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,303
I'll be staying in town.

1048
01:10:16,955 --> 01:10:18,723
- What are you doin'?

1049
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:23,188
You drive me out to the middle of nowhere.
Can I get a ride home?

1050
01:11:30,139 --> 01:11:31,838
Walt?

1051
01:11:45,323 --> 01:11:46,790
Walt?

1052
01:12:00,101 --> 01:12:02,303
Walter, come on, boy!

1053
01:12:02,905 --> 01:12:04,337
Walt!

1054
01:12:06,195 --> 01:12:07,508
Walt!

1055
01:12:08,272 --> 01:12:10,444
Come on, buddy, let's go.

1056
01:12:12,085 --> 01:12:14,152
Walter, come on.

1057
01:12:14,927 --> 01:12:16,628
Walt.

1058
01:12:46,601 --> 01:12:48,147
Morning.

1059
01:12:58,210 --> 01:12:59,844
Walter.

1060
01:13:02,452 --> 01:13:04,520
Where's Trouble?

1061
01:13:04,726 --> 01:13:06,585
Where is he?

1062
01:13:07,038 --> 01:13:09,305
Sweet little baby.

1063
01:13:34,566 --> 01:13:36,433
Baby, what is it?

1064
01:13:42,015 --> 01:13:44,662
There's something that I need
to tell you and I...

1065
01:13:44,704 --> 01:13:46,602
I don't know how.

1066
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:53,378
You can tell me... honey.

1067
01:13:53,691 --> 01:13:55,157
It's okay.

1068
01:13:59,441 --> 01:14:01,041
Ma...

1069
01:14:01,444 --> 01:14:03,312
Walter died.

1070
01:14:11,097 --> 01:14:13,423
Baby, where's Walt... Walter?

1071
01:14:13,465 --> 01:14:15,418
Walter!
Come here, boy!

1072
01:14:15,776 --> 01:14:19,320
- Mom... Walter was sick.
- No, no.

1073
01:14:19,362 --> 01:14:21,258
He was sick, Mom, and he died.

1074
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,573
- No.

1075
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:25,148
You tell me the truth!

1076
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:26,891
You tell me now!
You tell me.

1077
01:14:26,933 --> 01:14:29,932
- Mom, come on.
- Back! Back! Back!

1078
01:14:31,542 --> 01:14:33,362
You killed him!

1079
01:14:35,515 --> 01:14:36,803
Walter...

1080
01:14:36,998 --> 01:14:38,253
Walter...

1081
01:14:38,295 --> 01:14:40,034
No, no!

1082
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:41,707
No, no!

1083
01:14:41,749 --> 01:14:43,397
No... no!

1084
01:14:52,569 --> 01:14:54,203
Hey!

1085
01:14:57,022 --> 01:14:58,683
What's going on?

1086
01:14:58,725 --> 01:15:01,370
- You alright?
- Who are you?!

1087
01:15:01,412 --> 01:15:02,830
- What?

1088
01:15:03,389 --> 01:15:07,145
You... you tell me who you are
right now.

1089
01:15:07,187 --> 01:15:09,542
What do you...?
What is this about?

1090
01:15:09,584 --> 01:15:11,433
You lied to me!

1091
01:15:11,475 --> 01:15:14,109
I ran into your uncle.

1092
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:18,753
Okay, just...
calm down, okay? It's...

1093
01:15:18,795 --> 01:15:20,917
- Walter died.

1094
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:24,193
He died
and you could've helped him!

1095
01:15:25,579 --> 01:15:28,013
- You can let it out, okay?

1096
01:15:35,061 --> 01:15:37,454
Who the fuck are you?!!

1097
01:15:54,246 --> 01:15:56,747
- I'm sorry about Walter.

1098
01:15:59,293 --> 01:16:02,123
Why were you at the hospital?

1099
01:16:06,139 --> 01:16:08,027
They...

1100
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:10,936
they called it
a nervous breakdown.

1101
01:16:13,501 --> 01:16:17,897
I... I put an incredible effort
into getting my shit together.

1102
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:20,673
I did everything
I was supposed to be doing.

1103
01:16:22,032 --> 01:16:27,217
I was put together
piece by piece and...

1104
01:16:27,259 --> 01:16:30,155
...when I saw
the bigger picture,

1105
01:16:30,197 --> 01:16:32,311
it just wasn't who I was.

1106
01:16:32,353 --> 01:16:34,721
I just...
I couldn't take it anymore.

1107
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:39,459
I could never be
who they wanted me to be.

1108
01:16:40,025 --> 01:16:42,501
I was never good enough.

1109
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:47,345
So...

1110
01:16:49,603 --> 01:16:52,842
I took enough pills to...

1111
01:16:52,884 --> 01:16:55,108
end all of that...

1112
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:56,522
and...

1113
01:16:56,564 --> 01:16:58,844
when I woke up...

1114
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:02,919
I was put into a hospital.

1115
01:17:04,025 --> 01:17:07,195
And they told me that I...

1116
01:17:07,237 --> 01:17:10,004
I was a danger to myself.

1117
01:17:16,361 --> 01:17:18,006
You should go home.

1118
01:17:21,548 --> 01:17:25,079
You know, you're lucky
for the problems you have now.

1119
01:17:25,267 --> 01:17:28,402
You'll be better equipped,
you'll cope.

1120
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:31,152
Co...

1121
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:36,993
I don't want to have
to co... cope my whole life.

1122
01:18:00,931 --> 01:18:03,120
Family's important.

1123
01:18:03,634 --> 01:18:06,186
Fix what you're running from.

1124
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:08,295
They'll always find you.

1125
01:18:32,181 --> 01:18:34,061
I lieu of making this public,

1126
01:18:34,103 --> 01:18:36,938
we decided to keep it
a private issue.

1127
01:18:39,099 --> 01:18:43,315
Your actions reflect very poorly
upon this school,

1128
01:18:43,357 --> 01:18:48,698
and if you have any hope of continuing
your education at another school,

1129
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:52,401
you will give us the names of
the students who participated,

1130
01:18:52,443 --> 01:18:55,077
as well as the name
of the woman.

1131
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:01,054
Dammit, Hardy, I wanna know who!

1132
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:04,614
What if it was your kid?

1133
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:07,010
Chrissy would never do
something like that.

1134
01:19:07,052 --> 01:19:10,946
All he wants to know...
are the names.

1135
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:14,441
Screw it.

1136
01:19:15,023 --> 01:19:16,664
- Excuse me?

1137
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,966
Let me ask you a question:
When you look at your students,

1138
01:19:20,008 --> 01:19:23,966
do you see signs on our foreheads
that say "little assholes"?

1139
01:19:24,008 --> 01:19:26,642
I don't understand the question.

1140
01:19:26,726 --> 01:19:28,708
Oh, because you treat us all
like little assholes.

1141
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:30,216
Oh, cut the crap!

1142
01:19:38,727 --> 01:19:40,810
- These walls
that you've built around us,

1143
01:19:40,852 --> 01:19:43,263
they haven't nurtured us.

1144
01:19:43,305 --> 01:19:45,999
They've trapped us inside!
We-we-we show up here,

1145
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:48,083
day after day, after day,
after day,

1146
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:51,528
in our blazers and our ties
and dress shirts and fancy shoes

1147
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:53,911
like we're walking out
of a fucking J.Crew catalogue,

1148
01:19:53,953 --> 01:19:55,474
gilded in our own austerity!

1149
01:19:55,516 --> 01:19:58,020
Why is that?!
That's not cool.

1150
01:19:58,062 --> 01:20:00,169
That's very uncool.

1151
01:20:00,211 --> 01:20:04,052
You're supposed to excite us,
entice us, distract us! Come on!

1152
01:20:04,094 --> 01:20:07,099
You gotta bring it each
and every day and you don't.

1153
01:20:07,141 --> 01:20:08,200
Jesus Christ, you don't.

1154
01:20:08,242 --> 01:20:12,677
Instead, you walk these halls
looking for someone to penalize.

1155
01:20:13,765 --> 01:20:16,781
And for what?
What's the purpose of that?

1156
01:20:17,797 --> 01:20:21,265
For wearing a skirt that's
a couple of inches too short?

1157
01:20:21,841 --> 01:20:25,916
You don't stimulate ingenuity,
you don't create growth.

1158
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:29,369
You fabricate these mindless
'droids with hollow centres,

1159
01:20:29,411 --> 01:20:30,924
and you do it again
year after year.

1160
01:20:30,966 --> 01:20:32,713
You abrogate responsibility.

1161
01:20:32,755 --> 01:20:34,229
And it's this national crisis,

1162
01:20:34,271 --> 01:20:35,955
people all over
asking themselves:

1163
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:38,393
Is it the home that's at fault,
or is it the school?

1164
01:20:38,435 --> 01:20:39,776
I don't know.

1165
01:20:39,818 --> 01:20:43,338
I say that it's the whole mix
of who we are and the classroom

1166
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,731
that's supposed to help us
decide who we wanna be.

1167
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:50,929
Maybe I'm just crazy, right?

1168
01:20:52,732 --> 01:20:54,712
And a puffin?

1169
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:57,260
Who's the genius
who is behind that idea?

1170
01:20:57,302 --> 01:21:00,010
Our motto is:
Fly Above All Else.

1171
01:21:00,052 --> 01:21:02,519
A puffin is a low-flying bird.

1172
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:06,086
That doesn't make any sense!

1173
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:09,510
So to address
your previous request,

1174
01:21:09,552 --> 01:21:11,018
I'm not going to give
you those names

1175
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,510
so you can punish
those kids further,

1176
01:21:12,552 --> 01:21:16,012
'cause you're already doing
a perfectly fine job at that.

1177
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:25,489
- So that's it?

1178
01:21:25,963 --> 01:21:28,286
You walk out on your future.

1179
01:22:46,514 --> 01:22:48,214
Fuck!

1180
01:23:06,122 --> 01:23:07,769
I can't do it.

1181
01:23:07,811 --> 01:23:10,125
I can't do this anymore, Ma.

1182
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:12,236
We need to do something.

1183
01:23:12,278 --> 01:23:15,279
- What?
- What?!

1184
01:23:15,693 --> 01:23:18,565
You nearly burned the kitchen
down again, Ma! Come on!

1185
01:23:18,607 --> 01:23:21,608
- Don't be silly.
It's just a little overcooked.

1186
01:23:22,943 --> 01:23:24,245
- You...

1187
01:23:24,287 --> 01:23:27,313
Will you please
just let me help you?

1188
01:23:27,466 --> 01:23:29,967
- Baby,
you're not making any sense.

1189
01:23:32,153 --> 01:23:34,348
I've been doing some research.

1190
01:23:34,653 --> 01:23:37,080
There's a place nearby
that you can get help.

1191
01:23:37,122 --> 01:23:40,900
- Help? What am I,
some kind of pity case?

1192
01:23:40,942 --> 01:23:42,283
It's...
it's just what they want.

1193
01:23:42,325 --> 01:23:43,527
It's...

1194
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:45,636
Who's they?!

1195
01:23:45,678 --> 01:23:47,221
What are you even talking about?

1196
01:23:47,263 --> 01:23:51,051
I can't take care of you
anymore! I can't do it!

1197
01:23:52,403 --> 01:23:54,471
Will you please stop it?

1198
01:23:58,107 --> 01:23:59,408
Will you please listen to me?

1199
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:02,346
Enough, enough with the water.
Stop.

1200
01:24:02,388 --> 01:24:04,988
Get... Leave it, Ma.

1201
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:06,674
You need help.

1202
01:24:06,716 --> 01:24:09,310
You need serious help
and I can't help you.

1203
01:24:09,352 --> 01:24:11,291
I want to and I can't.

1204
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:15,513
I can't... figure everything out
all the time. I'm the kid!

1205
01:24:15,677 --> 01:24:17,318
I don't know
how to figure everything out.

1206
01:24:17,325 --> 01:24:20,111
I... I can't be responsible
for making our lives better!

1207
01:24:20,153 --> 01:24:24,801
My life fucking sucks!
It sucks! Stop!

1208
01:24:26,911 --> 01:24:29,760
Ma, you can't keep pretending
like everything's okay.

1209
01:24:29,802 --> 01:24:31,329
It's not okay.

1210
01:24:31,371 --> 01:24:33,924
And you need serious help
and I can't help you.

1211
01:24:33,966 --> 01:24:37,701
What do you want from me?
What do you want me to do?

1212
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:41,929
Okay, there's...
there's this place,

1213
01:24:41,971 --> 01:24:44,259
and it'll be just like a...
a... a vacation.

1214
01:24:44,301 --> 01:24:45,726
You'll be so much happier.

1215
01:24:45,768 --> 01:24:49,141
I'd get to see you smile again
when I come and visit you.

1216
01:24:49,183 --> 01:24:52,580
You come when you want
and you leave when you want.

1217
01:24:52,831 --> 01:24:55,976
They'll take care of you.
You'll be happy. Right?

1218
01:24:56,018 --> 01:24:58,430
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

1219
01:24:58,472 --> 01:25:00,172
What's wrong with me?

1220
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:03,323
I don't know...

1221
01:25:03,553 --> 01:25:05,318
I don't know.

1222
01:25:05,925 --> 01:25:10,727
But if we don't do anything, we're gonna
die like this here in this house.

1223
01:25:11,151 --> 01:25:15,010
If you don't wanna do it for
yourself, then you can do it for me.

1224
01:25:16,426 --> 01:25:18,126
Okay?

1225
01:26:27,985 --> 01:26:30,654
- What a nice setup you got, Ma.

1226
01:26:31,881 --> 01:26:33,753
I might bunk up with you.

1227
01:26:33,795 --> 01:26:36,162
Hardy, what are you going to do?

1228
01:26:40,277 --> 01:26:41,943
I don't know.

1229
01:26:45,226 --> 01:26:47,824
But at least I know
that I don't know.

1230
01:26:47,866 --> 01:26:51,968
So I got that going for me.
That's nice, right?

1231
01:26:53,623 --> 01:26:55,417
- Put that over there.
- Over by the TV?

1232
01:26:55,459 --> 01:26:57,025
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

1233
01:27:01,054 --> 01:27:02,788
C'mere.

1234
01:27:04,881 --> 01:27:08,217
I, uh... I-I need to tell you...

1235
01:27:08,553 --> 01:27:10,878
I wanna tell you that...

1236
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,935
- What do you wanna tell me,
Mom? Huh?

1237
01:27:16,248 --> 01:27:17,886
You can tell me.
It's okay.

1238
01:27:17,928 --> 01:27:20,929
I want...
to tell you that I'm...

1239
01:27:21,295 --> 01:27:23,562
I'm very proud of you.

1240
01:27:26,928 --> 01:27:29,395
- I'm very proud of you too, Ma.

1241
01:27:31,506 --> 01:27:34,498
You are so... handsome.

1242
01:27:35,248 --> 01:27:37,136
My boy is so handsome!

1243
01:27:37,178 --> 01:27:38,920
- Thank you, Ma.

1244
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,058
Ah... You are!

1245
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,925
- Thank you, Ma.
- You know what else?

1246
01:27:42,967 --> 01:27:45,076
- What?
- Those shoes?

1247
01:27:45,561 --> 01:27:49,936
They've been stinking for a long time now.
You gotta throw those out.

1248
01:27:50,186 --> 01:27:53,253
- These are the only shoes I have.
- I don't care. They just...

1249
01:27:53,287 --> 01:27:55,012
- They're... Woof!
- Okay...

1250
01:27:55,015 --> 01:27:56,780
I didn't know
if it was the dog or your feet.

1251
01:27:56,818 --> 01:27:58,708
It was probably my feet.

1252
01:27:58,733 --> 01:28:00,644
It's... You're right.
It's a problem.

1253
01:28:02,623 --> 01:28:05,124
Girls don't like stinky feet.

1254
01:28:05,806 --> 01:28:07,772
I'll throw 'em out.

1255
01:28:11,084 --> 01:28:12,718
So?

1256
01:28:13,936 --> 01:28:15,636
So?

1257
01:28:17,795 --> 01:28:20,390
Before you go...

1258
01:28:20,432 --> 01:28:22,699
you gotta do the thing.

1259
01:28:25,061 --> 01:28:27,288
How do you still remember?
I don't do it anymore!

1260
01:28:27,313 --> 01:28:29,418
I don't care. I'm your mother,
I'm telling you to do the thing.

1261
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:30,849
I haven't done it
since I was eight!

1262
01:28:30,874 --> 01:28:33,186
- I don't care. Do the thing.
- Is that sign language?

1263
01:28:33,211 --> 01:28:34,466
- Yes.
- You want me to do the thing?

1264
01:28:34,491 --> 01:28:36,705
Well, If you're doing sign language,
I gotta do the thing.

1265
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:38,183
Do what I say.

1266
01:28:38,225 --> 01:28:40,959
- Turn the other way first.
- Really? Are you kidding?

1267
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:42,730
- You want me to do the thing...
- Go.

1268
01:28:42,772 --> 01:28:44,756
- These are the conditions.
- Hurry up.

1269
01:28:45,912 --> 01:28:48,863
I hate goodbyes. Are you done?
Hurry. Go. Go!

1270
01:28:48,905 --> 01:28:51,839
- Ma, I'm getting ready.
- Go, go!

1271
01:28:53,162 --> 01:28:54,887
Ya know, these people,
Lorna,

1272
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:56,676
let me tell you,
unbelievable.

1273
01:28:56,718 --> 01:28:58,387
I called on the telephone.

1274
01:28:58,429 --> 01:29:00,194
I say,
"Am I gonna need a sweater?"

1275
01:29:00,219 --> 01:29:02,013
They say, "Yes,
you're gonna need a sweater."

1276
01:29:02,038 --> 01:29:05,309
They got the air conditioning
not working, there's no watah.

1277
01:29:05,351 --> 01:29:08,652
I'm... I'm schvitzing
like I don't even know what.

1278
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:11,176
Oh, my goodness.

1279
01:29:11,218 --> 01:29:12,691
Are you good?
Your shoulder okay?

1280
01:29:12,733 --> 01:29:15,613
- I'm so...
- You should... I tell you.

1281
01:29:15,655 --> 01:29:19,163
I tell you...
Okay, no, I'm fast enough.

1282
01:29:31,007 --> 01:29:33,897
You know, you missed Nana's 96.

1283
01:29:34,595 --> 01:29:37,194
She might not get another one.

1284
01:29:38,194 --> 01:29:40,348
You've been saying that
since I was a kid.

1285
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:42,523
I'm just saying...

1286
01:29:43,179 --> 01:29:45,270
suggesting that you...

1287
01:29:45,312 --> 01:29:48,847
might wanna send her a card.

1288
01:29:49,471 --> 01:29:51,305
I'll do that.

1289
01:29:56,531 --> 01:29:59,199
Didn't want you jumping ship.

1290
01:30:05,657 --> 01:30:07,291
We're gonna be okay.

1291
01:31:06,382 --> 01:31:08,241
What are you doing here?

1292
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:11,020
I came to see you.

1293
01:31:11,062 --> 01:31:12,379
- I can see that.

1294
01:31:12,421 --> 01:31:13,820
Why?

1295
01:31:15,733 --> 01:31:17,418
Well, I needed to see you,

1296
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:19,952
because I'm always thinking
about you.

1297
01:31:20,936 --> 01:31:24,285
Come on, Hardy.
That gooey stuff is not for me.

1298
01:31:24,327 --> 01:31:26,754
- What else do you want me
to say? I'm telling the truth.

1299
01:31:26,796 --> 01:31:29,157
Yeah, I know that.
Will you lie to me?

1300
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:30,798
It's easier.

1301
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:34,220
Fine.

1302
01:31:43,233 --> 01:31:45,734
I don't think about you
every day.

1303
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:48,569
I don't think you're amazing.

1304
01:31:48,866 --> 01:31:52,168
I definitely don't think that
you're funny or you're smart.

1305
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:55,731
It's not like I sit around pretending
we already have inside jokes

1306
01:31:55,773 --> 01:31:58,070
that other people
find obnoxious.

1307
01:31:59,218 --> 01:32:02,320
I don't think you're...
confident or exciting.

1308
01:32:03,546 --> 01:32:08,889
I'm definitely not into
your face or your, uh... body.

1309
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:12,973
In fact, I-I think you're ugly, Lake...

1310
01:32:13,015 --> 01:32:15,482
And I'm pretty sure you suck.

1311
01:32:16,985 --> 01:32:20,426
And even though I think
all of those things,

1312
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:24,603
I'm still completely and
irreversibly obsessed with you.

1313
01:32:30,143 --> 01:32:32,092
That's pretty good.

1314
01:32:32,632 --> 01:32:35,867
I had a lot of time
to think about it.

1315
01:32:37,372 --> 01:32:40,645
Okay, well...
you can come in...

1316
01:32:40,687 --> 01:32:43,045
if you quit picking on me.

1317
01:32:47,615 --> 01:32:49,077
Okay.

1318
01:36:34,656 --> 01:36:35,773
The End

1319
01:36:35,828 --> 01:36:37,582
