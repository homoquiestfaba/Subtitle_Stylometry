00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:33,471
Come on, guys,
I can't.

184
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,106
Not today, please.
Come on.

185
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,941
[clamoring]

186
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,910
Give us any information
at all, please.

187
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,245
Blood suckers.

188
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:43,014
Sheriff, come on.
Something.

189
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,655
Hey, Elliot.

190
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,025
How you doing?

191
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,393
Not today, Mrs. Fowler.

192
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,395
Well actually it's
Miss Perlman now.

193
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,198
Well, you'll always be
Mrs. Fowler to me.

194
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,532
And it's deputy now.

195
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,601
That's nice.

196
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,370
How's Adrianne?

197
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:08,106
We broke up...2005.

198
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,674
Oh.

199
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,476
So, where's the suspect?

200
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,011
That's none of your concern.

201
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,046
Really?

202
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,181
'Cause I'm about
to post her bail.

203
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,451
[sighs]

204
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,458
All right, people, we're gonna
have to split up the recovery

205
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,526
search a few more miles.

206
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,528
Hyde keeps finding pieces.

207
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,396
Which way?

208
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,463
[sighs]

209
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,599
They keep popping up
everywhere.

210
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,067
Right.

211
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,235
Where the hell
are the paramedics?

212
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,436
Always the
last one on the scene,

213
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,671
you know that.

214
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,475
Speak of the devils, huh?

215
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,652
You Hamilton?

216
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,254
Yeah, that's me.

217
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,322
Jim Duffy.

218
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,456
You in charge?

219
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,092
but, uh, Sheriff Fowler
from Jefferson Parish

220
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,394
He's a little tied up
with the press.

221
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:05,964
Fucking maggots?

222
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,532
[scoffs]
You're telling me.

223
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,067
So what are we
talking about here?

224
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,335
Three bodies, six?

225
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,203
Shit, try 20 or 30.

226
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,306
What the fuck happened?

227
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,141
Well, it's all under
investigation but, uh,

228
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,043
we do have a girl
in custody.

229
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,181
A girl?

230
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,649
You guys think
a girl did this?

231
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,018
Shit yeah.
We got good reason too.

232
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,754
You guys don't tell
us how to do our job;

233
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,256
we won't tell you
how you suck at yours.

234
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,762
let's start gathering the
bodies over here.

235
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:40,131
Bob, Randy,
bag and tag.

236
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,033
Andrew, come with me.

237
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,501
What happened?

238
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,004
Some people died
and made a mess.

239
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,538
Barney Fife back there,

240
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,507
he says they got a
girl in custody.

241
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,043
- A girl?
- Yeah.

242
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,212
We're not gonna be out
here all night, are we?

243
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:55,279
How the fuck do I know,
Andrew.

244
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,681
What? Are you scared
or something?

245
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,217
You know where we are,
right?

246
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,552
Be a man.
Have a Twinkie.

247
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,692
What girl did that?

248
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,266
Humph.

249
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,503
[coughing]

250
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,171
[clears throat]

251
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,611
You're awake.

252
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,182
I'm Amanda Perlman.

253
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,652
I-I tried to post your bail

254
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,487
but you have to go
before a judge for that

255
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,724
and there's no
bail set, so...

256
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:43,728
I'm sort of the local expert
on the Victor Crowley legend.

257
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,663
Had a big splashy
article not long ago,

258
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,065
local legends and lore&

259
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,132
The Bayou Butcher.

260
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,567
Yeah, I saw you on
"Montel".

261
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,835
Oh, you saw that.

262
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:54,672
Yeah, well, you know,
not my best career move.

263
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,674
[chuckles]

264
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,578
Been trawling county websites
ever since but you know--

265
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,247
I just--I had a belief
and I have a passion

266
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:08,219
and it's kinda made me a
national journalism joke.

267
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,255
And one minute
you're on national TV,

268
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:16,627
What the fuck do you
want from me?

269
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,697
Well, I don't wanna
waste your time.

270
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,466
I can see you're busy.

271
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,303
I just wanted to,
you know, interview you

272
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,206
about what happened,
find out what you saw.

273
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,608
Listen, I can help you.

274
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,611
that the ghost of Victor
Crowley actually exists,

275
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,446
that would help me a lot.

276
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:40,852
So you want me to
help you, right?

277
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,287
- Right?
- Yeah, that's right.

278
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,592
I mean, right now you're
looking at a lifetime in jail.

279
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,594
I might be the best chance
and the best friend you've got.

280
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,864
No offense,
but fuck you.

281
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,533
I wanna fucking lawyer,
not blogger.

282
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,535
I gave you your
two minutes.

283
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:00,738
Now, you just listen to me.

284
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,573
We're gonna run
through this again,

285
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,742
Marybeth Dunston,

286
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,744
daughter of Samson Dunston,

287
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,180
washed up local drunk,

288
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,815
who if he's even got
enough education

289
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,550
to sign off on your death
penalty acceptance

290
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:16,287
would have to be poured out
of a local bar to do it.

291
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,489
And let's not forget
your brother Ainsley.

292
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,192
How many dozen
DUI he got?

293
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,793
Oh, and those three months
community service

294
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,930
for defacing a church?

295
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,832
Look, I know you
didn't do this

296
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:28,933
but you're gonna
go down for it

297
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,502
'cause you're
po' white trash.

298
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,271
You know what they do
with po' white trash

299
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:37,608
who are convicted on
a capital charge?

300
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,879
The state of Louisiana
will execute you.

301
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,881
So you go ahead
and you sit in here.

302
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:47,552
You can bark at me
like a big dog in a cage,

303
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:52,490
you can either help me prove
Victor Crowley exists

304
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:53,925
or you can wait for
the lethal injection

305
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,561
that's gonna end your
miserable life.

306
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,368
Do it.

307
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,406
your pappy ain't been
here to see you.

308
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,509
Must be happy hour
somewhere.

309
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,411
Maybe he'll show up
after he's panhandled

310
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:17,415
enough pocket change
for a Pabst.

311
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,784
My father is dead.

312
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:22,320
Victor Crowley killed him.

313
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:29,594
Please,
tell me what happened.

314
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,662
I know I can help you.

315
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,873
Fine.

316
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,278
I'll wait.

317
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,667
Son-of-a-bitch,

318
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,869
where the hell
are the other guys?

319
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,337
Oh, shit.

320
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,473
Where the fuck did
this rain come from?

321
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,845
Randy.

322
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:23,481
[grunts]

323
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,349
- One, two, three.
- Holy shit.

324
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:26,751
[grunts]

325
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,721
What'd you guys
bring me a giant?

326
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,524
Yeah, it's, uh,
hard to tell.

327
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,059
This poor bastard
was lying on top of

328
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:37,962
the biggest chainsaw I've
ever seen in my life.

329
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:41,432
and his body is in a lot
of different pieces.

330
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:41,966
Jesus.

331
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,902
I thought you might wanna
take a look at this one

332
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,805
The guy looks like he had
all kinds of muscular

333
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,674
and skin deformities&

334
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,677
and he was only
wearing overalls.

335
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,345
Get the fuck out.

336
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,680
I know, right?

337
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:58,816
Anyway, looks like this
one in particular might be,

338
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,453
I don't know, crucial
component in all of this.

339
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:03,788
Wait a minute.
You don't think, uh&

340
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,023
I'm not saying shit,
all right?

341
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,658
All I'm saying

342
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,027
is that you might wanna
drop whatever you're doing

343
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,596
and check this one
over first.

344
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:13,864
Awesome.

345
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,533
Gonna be fucking creepy
but awesome.

346
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:16,801
Let's go.

347
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,104
Come on, big man,
we got a date.

348
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,978
Oh, oh.

349
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,614
Okay, here we go.

350
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,352
One, two, three.

351
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,620
[grunting]

352
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,622
Dude, I'm telling
you this may be--

353
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,558
I have seen some
crazy shit, man.

354
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,126
I was working on
an Asian male,

355
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:43,661
head severed off,

356
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,896
uh, leg cut off
below the knee.

357
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,398
I'm telling you, man.

358
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,368
Look kind of like you,
man.

359
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,937
Oh, what,
because I'm Asian?

360
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,572
No, dude,
because you were--

361
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,374
Oh, yeah, I-I get it.

362
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,109
We all look the same,
right?

363
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:59,110
Ha-ha-ha.

364
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:00,745
It's hilarious.

365
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,914
Asshole.

366
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,649
Oh, fuck that.

367
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,024
He was shredded to pieces.

368
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:17,495
There was nothing left to
possibly get back up again.

369
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:20,498
I mean, taking his
head off wasn't enough,

370
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,867
dismembering him was.

371
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,135
I got away.

372
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:26,637
Now what time was this?

373
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:29,940
This morning.
I don't know.

374
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:32,109
Reverend Zombie thought

375
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,611
that by letting
Crowley kill the

376
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:36,013
three people that were
responsible for his death

377
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,815
somehow the curse
will be lifted

378
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:41,585
and I don't know he
would just go away.

379
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,587
It was all bullshit.

380
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,991
when I interviewed a
voodoo priestess,

381
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,893
and she was a real
voodoo priestess--

382
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,562
Oh, she was real voodoo
priestess, of course.

383
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:52,897
I know it sounds crazy

384
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,632
but if anything should
be a believer,

385
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,801
I would imagine
that would be you.

386
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:57,902
According to legend,

387
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:00,504
Victor Crowley is cursed
as a repeater.

388
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:03,007
Each night he has to
return exactly as he was

389
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,575
when he died.

390
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,444
He has to relive the
night of his death

391
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,612
in an endless cycle
over and over again.

392
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,914
You can't kill him.

393
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,183
He's already dead.

394
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:13,651
It's kinda sad really.

395
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:17,087
I sawed his body
into little pieces.

396
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,657
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

397
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:23,828
keep him from returning
again and again

398
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,763
in his original form.

399
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,532
[scoffs]
He's dead.

400
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,068
He's not.

401
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,034
Any sign of the sheriff yet?

402
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,135
Nothing yet.

403
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:07,872
All right, well, he should
be here soon, all right?

404
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,240
I'm on channel six
when you see him.

405
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:10,941
Hey.

406
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,510
Any more bodies?

407
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:14,678
Oh, man.
It's hard to tell.

408
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,081
It looks like we got a whole
area down there by the cabin,

409
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,782
the whole crime
scene over there

410
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:21,886
a whole mess of bodies
even more in the east.

411
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:24,288
[sighs]
My call,

412
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,123
I think the victims
were in two separate groups.

413
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,792
Hell, they probably didn't
even see each other down there.

414
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:31,562
Coming each way in
different directions.

415
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,098
Oh, man, how the hell do
you deal with that smell?

416
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,201
It takes a couple of years
but you do get used it.

417
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,570
Another day
on the job for me.

418
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,105
You know,
close the door, man.

419
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,173
I'll be on six.

420
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,827
[whistling]

421
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,268
[screaming]

422
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,386
Randy?

423
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,522
Freeze!

424
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,790
Don't move!

425
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,626
[growling]

426
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,231
[groaning]

427
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,837
Shit!
What?

428
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,074
Hamilton?

429
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,776
<i>Get off of me,</i>
<i>right now, dammit!</i>

430
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:26,844
<i>Somebody help!</i>

431
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:28,779
Holy shit! Holy shit.

432
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:31,081
Help. Help!

433
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,149
Hamilton!

434
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,389
<i>Hamilton,</i>
<i>do-do you read?</i>

435
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,861
Sheriff?

436
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:44,895
Lou, are you there?

437
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,430
<i>I heard it. I'm making</i>
<i>a call to the state.</i>

438
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:48,866
<i>Bring everyone and</i>
<i>everything I can bring with me.</i>

439
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:50,834
<i>We should be out</i>
<i>there in less than 30.</i>

440
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,936
You still think he's dead?

441
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:53,904
I killed him!

442
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,106
You didn't
but I know how.

443
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,042
How?

444
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:04,114
His father endlessly
night after night.

445
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:06,717
he can finally find
peace and pass on--

446
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:09,953
Thomas Crowley has
been dead for years.

447
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:13,090
but first I need to know that
you're gonna help me out.

448
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,392
I already told you
everything that I know.

449
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:18,462
You are the only living
relative of Samson Dunston,

450
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,164
the man who caused
all of this.

451
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,700
You are the only one
who can end it.

452
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:25,769
That means you are the only
one who can make it stop.

453
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:28,338
You heard what
I heard on the radio!

454
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,407
How many more people have
to die before this is over?

455
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:31,208
I can't.

456
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,044
You can.

457
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,113
We're going for a ride.

458
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,383
Oh, hell, no.

459
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,351
<i>we have a report of</i>
<i>a man down at</i>

460
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,853
<i>Honey Island Swamp.</i>

461
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,189
<i>No response from fire,</i>
<i>paramedics on site.</i>

462
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:47,191
<i>I need all available</i>
<i>units to Honey Island.</i>

463
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:48,892
<i>All available units</i>
<i>to the swamp.</i>

464
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,995
Elliot, you have to help me
because if you don't,

465
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,164
everybody in that
swamp is gonna die.

466
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,166
You open that door.

467
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:57,101
<i>Look out, look out!</i>

468
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,136
[screaming]

469
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,406
[screaming]

470
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,907
Open it!

471
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,077
Oh!

472
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,946
<i>All right, cover-cover me!</i>

473
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:11,014
<i>[screaming]</i>

474
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,483
Now!

475
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,290
All right, here's
what we know now.

476
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:23,193
A group of Jefferson Parish PD,
paramedic and fire

477
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,295
respond to a report of
a multiple homicide

478
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:30,033
There are 12 people
all of whom are now MIA.

479
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,969
We have one suspect
in custody

480
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:37,040
and our last contact was
about 45-45 minutes ago

481
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,243
but we did receive
distress calls

482
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,478
of an unknown attacker
and multiple men down.

483
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,846
So, who's left?

484
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:45,115
We're not exactly sure.

485
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,818
Do we know if the
attacker is still in the area?

486
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,520
Well, we have to
assume so, yeah.

487
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:52,923
But, uh, guys, I want you
all armed and at the ready.

488
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:54,958
We got no idea what
we're dealing with here

489
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,427
so let's be prepared
for anything, okay?

490
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,029
Is the attacker armed?

491
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,898
Definitely, but we just
don't know with what.

492
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,933
I'll take it from here,
Sheriff.

493
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:05,202
Officer Hawes,
Louisiana State SWAT.

494
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:06,570
Uh, nice to meet you, sir,

495
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:10,507
but actually these are
my men and, uh--sir&

496
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:11,475
[grunts]

497
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,144
All right, everybody,
listen up.

498
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,879
You will give one
verbal warning

499
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,915
and then you will
shoot to kill.

500
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,116
Do I make myself clear?

501
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:20,484
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

502
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,319
Let's stay together
and move out.

503
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,427
Son of a bitch!

504
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,033
What have you got in
there nuclear warhead?

505
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:39,236
but I brought about every other
toy I could get my hands on.

506
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,004
You don't fuck around.

507
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,006
Mikaela Dougherty.

508
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,442
Cory Schneiderman.
It's a pleasure.

509
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:49,413
You're planning on
taking out a T-Rex tonight?

510
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:51,615
You do know where
we are, right?

511
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,517
Smelly swamp?

512
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,286
This is his swamp.

513
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,589
Victor Crowley.

514
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:00,190
I'm sorry.
I'm new here.

515
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,525
I just transferred
from Arizona.

516
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,460
Who's Victor Crowley?

517
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:07,397
there's this little boy who
was born deformed and he--

518
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,367
Come on, let's go,
dipshit.

519
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,336
That guy's such a
fucking asshole!

520
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,272
I'll tell you
about it later.

521
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:17,074
The NRA would be proud.

522
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:18,242
I'm a member.

523
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,319
Can you please take
these cuffs off of me?

524
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,021
Absolutely not.

525
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,990
I shouldn't be doing this.

526
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,157
I'll lose my job on this.

527
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,894
locked up in the back
of this fucking car?

528
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,929
Will you please shut up?

529
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,230
How far is Ozona?

530
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,932
Ozona?

531
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,267
It's up there, uh,
11 freeway

532
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,601
on the other side
of Nicholson.

533
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:46,336
What-what?
What's in Ozona?

534
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,907
Ozona is nowhere near
Honey Island Swamp.

535
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,576
We need to get to Ozona
is what we need to do.

536
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,144
And for the last time,
it's Miss Perlman,

537
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:55,946
Elliot, okay?

538
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:57,381
Just, you know,
call me Amanda.

539
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:59,383
Do that. Amanda.

540
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:02,019
I thought you were
Sheriff Fowler's wife.

541
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,454
I need to call Sheriff and
let him know what we're doing.

542
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,957
No, you absolutely
do not.

543
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,326
Not yet.

544
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:12,396
Do you understand how much
trouble my ass is gonna be in?

545
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,331
I'll tell you what,
get me to Ozona

546
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,199
and then you can call Louis
and tell him we're on our way.

547
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,034
Deal?

548
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:20,437
What is in Ozona?

549
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,272
Thomas Crowley.

550
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,708
Thomas Crowley?
Thomas Crow--

551
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,109
if he were alive,
wouldn't he be like,

552
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,346
300 fucking years
old by now?

553
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:31,048
He's dead.

554
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,217
So what are we
gonna do dig him up?

555
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:36,286
Not exactly.

556
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,308
Tell me about the suspect.

557
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,710
Well, she turned
herself in this morning.

558
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:02,346
She was covered in
someone else's blood

559
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:04,147
holding a shotgun.

560
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,515
Did she give a confession?

561
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,151
She kept carrying on
about some local legend

562
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,619
named Victor Crowley.

563
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,688
Hmm.
Yeah, I'm familiar.

564
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:16,193
when your men made a
distress call, correct?

565
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:20,364
But my guess is it's one of
these Crowley impersonators,

566
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:24,034
who's heard the ghost story
one time too many.

567
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:27,337
But she's clearly
part of it though.

568
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,006
Yeah, well, I'll be
the judge of that.

569
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,111
I suppose if anybody's
a Crowley expert

570
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,146
that would be you, right?

571
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:38,415
I mean your wife is
Amanda Fowler, correct?

572
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,449
Ah, ex.

573
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:42,052
She's my ex-wife.

574
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:43,620
I've got a few of
those myself.

575
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,655
Yeah, it's complicated.

576
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:51,261
I thought she and I, we just
clicked so good, you know.

577
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,597
But then I don't know--

578
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,799
I was just making
small talk, Sheriff.

579
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:58,301
I really don't wanna
hear about your divorce.

580
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:00,704
No offense.

581
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:18,255
So, uh,
when did you transfer?

582
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:19,756
About a month ago.

583
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,592
So far so good, though,
Mardi Gras has been a trip.

584
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,061
Fucking Mardi Gras.

585
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,595
It's the worst time of
the year for all of us.

586
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,197
Everyone flocks to
Bourbon Street thinking

587
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,399
it's gonna be like one of
those Bayou beaver DVDs

588
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,334
and instead they get two
for 60-year-old women

589
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:32,803
flashing their sagging
pancake--

590
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,705
Just a bird.

591
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,140
You're really
freaked out, huh?

592
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,376
Yes, I'm really freaked out.

593
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:40,610
There's a reason this
swamp is condemned

594
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:42,379
and closed off
to the public.

595
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:44,815
Enough people disappear,
enough bodies pile up

596
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,550
and eventually you
can't help but believe

597
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:47,651
there's some truth to
the ghost stories

598
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:49,619
you hear around here.

599
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:52,823
and I'm already a believer.
I'll tell you that much.

600
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:54,291
Hey, I get it.

601
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:56,093
I believe in ghost too.

602
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,728
I swear I saw one in my bedroom
when I was six years old

603
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,164
but it just smiled at
me and walked out.

604
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,301
It wasn't scary, kinda
peaceful and comforting.

605
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,169
This isn't Casper
the Friendly Ghost.

606
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:10,474
'Cause Casper doesn't tear you
in half with his bare hands.

607
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,739
Fucking Christ.

608
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,851
Do you still believe
in friendly ghost?

609
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:57,187
What the hell did this?

610
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,356
What's that?

611
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,158
God, we're fucked.
We're fucked.

612
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,794
Someone shut
Schneiderman the hell up.

613
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,233
It's a good thing you
got that girl in custody,

614
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,968
huh, Sheriff?

615
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:25,348
I'm trying to reach the
person we're going to see.

616
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,349
See if he's home.

617
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,651
Who are we going to see?

618
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:29,386
His name is Abbott McMullen.

619
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:31,688
Um, I did a bunch of interviews
with him a couple of years back.

620
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,590
My original Crowley piece.

621
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:34,824
Okay.

622
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,895
What are you doing?
Why are you stopping, Elliot?

623
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,897
Ol' man McMullen?

624
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,432
Abbott McCrazy.

625
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,833
Yeah, your point is?

626
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,969
We are in some serious
shit here, Amanda.

627
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:47,470
We have friends
in that swamp

628
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,639
that are seriously injured,
if not dead.

629
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,409
And I just took our prime
suspect out of jail

630
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:53,910
against the law.

631
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,213
And against my
better judgment.

632
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:58,715
And now you have me out here
on some wild goose chase

633
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,417
chasing I don't know what

634
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:03,320
with a more morbid version
of Wednesday Addams

635
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:06,823
who could possibly be
a psycho killer.

636
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,358
Yeah,
I'm sitting right here.

637
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:08,959
No offense.

638
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:10,760
None taken.
Asshole.

639
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,762
Hey, I'm still an
officer of the law

640
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:13,997
so watch your mouth
before I add

641
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,233
a few more charges
to your list.

642
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,802
Oh, can me telling you
to go fist your own ass

643
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,503
be another one
of them charges?

644
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:21,605
Okay, see, that's it.

645
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:22,572
Okay.
No, no, no.

646
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,542
Abbott McMullen is the
only living relative

647
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:26,776
of Thomas Crowley.

648
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,545
Thomas Crowley is
his great uncle.

649
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:33,350
He has Thomas Crowley
on his mantle in an urn.

650
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:36,920
The only way to give the ghost
of Victor Crowley peace

651
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,989
is to finally give
him what he wants.

652
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:40,657
If that's true, then why
didn't you just bring him

653
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,392
Thomas Crowley's
ashes years ago?

654
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,395
Only the person
responsible for his death

655
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:47,764
can finally deliver what
it is he's looking for.

656
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,032
I tried to have this
conversation

657
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:52,969
and he pulled a gun on me and
told me to go fuck myself.

658
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:54,437
Classy family.

659
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,772
Go fuck yourself.

660
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,774
Look, I know how
insane this sounds,

661
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,342
but until somebody
has a better idea,

662
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,744
this is the only
option we got.

663
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:02,612
So I suggest we
stop the fighting,

664
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:06,383
and we try to put an end
to this once and for all.

665
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,421
Louis is out in that swamp,

666
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:12,689
your best friend,
my husband.

667
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,691
You mean your
ex-husband, right?

668
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,293
[sighs]

669
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:18,028
Just drive.

670
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,929
Please.

671
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,831
I hate to break it
to you again, lady,

672
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,667
but my father is dead.

673
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:25,735
He sure is,
but you're not.

674
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,722
No way one person
did all of this.

675
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:50,660
Can you stop dancing around
what's really going on here?

676
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,495
Shut up, Schneiderman.

677
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,498
With all due respect, whether
you wanna believe it or not,

678
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,001
this is Victor Crowley
written all fucking over.

679
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,569
Control your deputy,
Sergeant.

680
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:01,771
Schneiderman, stand down.

681
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,340
Are you kidding me?

682
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:05,742
These are somebody's balls.

683
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,777
Balls are not supposed to
be hanging from trees

684
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:11,748
yet I'm finding myself looking
at fucking balls, sir.

685
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,516
That guy knows what's up.

686
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,385
We need to get the
fuck out of here

687
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:17,354
and call the national
fucking guard or some shit

688
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,756
- before we all end up&
- Shut your fucking mouth.

689
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,828
This whole thing could
be some sort of a joke.

690
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:30,700
A sick, perverse
practical fucking joke.

691
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,903
That doesn't look
like a joke to me.

692
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:35,372
My deputy is right.

693
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,540
I'm calling in the military
and we're leaving.

694
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,008
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

695
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,443
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire!

696
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,679
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire.

697
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,149
Who the hell are you?

698
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,552
I'm Andrew.

699
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,555
I'm what's left of the
first response team, sir.

700
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,858
Look, we got to get the
fuck outta here right now.

701
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,426
[breathing heavily]

702
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:58,795
Thank God,
you guys showed up.

703
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,397
Why don't you tell me
what happened then?

704
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,132
W-What happened?

705
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:04,634
Fucking Victor Crowley
happened that's what.

706
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:07,036
Look around!

707
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:09,472
Then why are you still here?

708
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:12,942
I hid underneath someone
else's body I found over there.

709
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:16,179
All right? He massacred
everyone in minutes!

710
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:17,547
And you didn't fight back?

711
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,549
No, I didn't fight back!

712
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:22,852
And that's the only reason
those aren't my balls

713
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,521
hanging from that tree!

714
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,122
Okay, please!

715
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,825
Please, we need to leave
right this second.

716
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,997
This is Sheriff Fowler,
Jefferson Parish.

717
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,698
I'm trying to reach
Colonel Mesco,

718
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,901
Louisiana National Guard.

719
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,569
<i>Repeat that,</i>
<i>Sheriff Fowler?</i>

720
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:41,738
We got a sit--

721
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,640
Cancel that request.

722
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:45,442
<i>Copy that.</i>

723
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,777
This is SWAT Team
Leader Tyler Hawes.

724
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,646
The situation's under control.

725
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:50,914
Cancel that request.

726
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,484
<i>What's your 20,</i>
<i>Officer Hawes?</i>

727
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,686
Do not answer that.

728
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,628
All right, everyone,
listen up.

729
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,498
I will not,
and I repeat, not

730
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,867
be losing my job by calling
the fuckin' military

731
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,135
until I figure out
what exactly

732
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,971
is fuckin' going on here.

733
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,172
Do I make myself clear?

734
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,841
Yes, sir.

735
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:20,043
I-Is this guy kidding?

736
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:21,778
Fuck this shit!

737
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,048
Your ego is putting
all of us in danger.

738
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,549
Fuckin' fire me.
I don't care.

739
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:27,784
I'm leaving.

740
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,520
Officer Schneiderman,

741
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:31,788
are you aware of
the consequences

742
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,590
for fleeing the
scene of a murder?

743
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,997
Yup, but at least
I'll be alive.

744
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,632
Don't do it, deputy.

745
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:48,938
[grunts]

746
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,007
Calm down!

747
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,943
What are you?
Are you scared?

748
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:54,811
Yes!

749
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,179
Yes, I'm fuckin' scared!

750
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,681
How the fuck are
you not scared?!

751
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,049
He's like a tank.

752
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:01,818
No matter how many
bullets he took,

753
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,287
he just kept getting
back up and coming.

754
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,222
If we don't leave
right this second,

755
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:08,691
nobody's gonna be
alive tomorrow.

756
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,563
Where is he?

757
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:14,831
I don't know!

758
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,199
I've been playing dead
a-and hiding

759
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,001
until you guys showed up!

760
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:22,071
Last I heard w-was screaming
coming from & over there.

761
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,875
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

762
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:00,944
Hold your--

763
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,221
Go check it out.

764
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,056
We got him.

765
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,897
[chuckling]

766
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:56,332
Good job, fucktards.

767
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,707
[distant growling]

768
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,309
Oh, my god!

769
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:08,277
Hide!

770
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:09,846
Hide, hide, hide!

771
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:11,781
Move.
Move, move.

772
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:14,917
Go!

773
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:18,755
Guys, guys, guys,
check this out.

774
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:19,722
Who wants in on this?

775
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:20,990
No.
No, no.

776
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,992
Hey, lights down.
Stop.

777
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,828
This is not a good
place t-to hide.

778
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,764
Um, I-I think he
lives here so--

779
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:29,165
Bushes over here.

780
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,434
Hey, you?
You wanna hide in the bush?

781
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:34,037
I'm so gonna fuckin' die.
I'm so gonna fuckin' die.

782
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:36,305
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

783
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:37,774
Stop, guys!

784
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,842
[murmuring]

785
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,834
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

786
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,408
[groans]

787
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,946
[screaming]

788
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:21,084
[screaming]
Louis, Louis, Louis.

789
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,821
Stop, stop!
Stop the fire!

790
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:25,822
Stop!

791
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:28,091

792
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:29,392
Help me!

794
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:33,162
Louis! Louis!

795
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:35,264
No. No.
Help.

796
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:37,333
Help me!
No.

797
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:39,235
[screaming]

798
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,472
Move your head!

799
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,875
Help me! Can you--

800
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:47,844
[screaming]

801
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,080
Oh no!

802
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,151
Move back! Move back,
move back, move back!

803
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:04,160
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

804
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,367
[growls]

805
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,572
Fire!

806
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,394
[growls]

807
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:13,129
[screaming]

808
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,866
Help me!

809
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:17,867
Help!

810
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,502
[screaming]

811
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,340
What the-what the fuck!

812
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,478
Get down!

813
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,350
[growling]

814
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,021
[screaming]

815
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,226
[growling]

816
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:26,502
No!

817
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:32,475
[growling]

818
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,978
Let's do this,
you little bitch.

819
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,482
Oh!

820
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,559
Whoa.

821
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,194
[growling]

822
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,265
Oh, fuck this!

823
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:05,141
[growling]

824
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:12,548
[screaming]

825
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,318
Schneiderman!

826
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,119
Hey!

827
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,089
- You're gonna kill him!
- He's already dead!

828
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:22,191
The guy was a real
fuckin' dick anyways.

829
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,600
Running around in your
fuckin' overalls

830
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:33,436
killing everybody
I fuckin' know.

831
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:35,371
Oh, my god, please!

832
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:37,039
Please, God!

833
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:38,407
Please stop!

834
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:40,509
I'll give you
your fuckin' daddy,

835
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:42,311
you deformed douche.

836
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,113
[screaming]

837
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:45,214
Sorry, Rick.

838
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:47,616
Eat this, motherfucker!

839
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,198
Woo!

840
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,299
[laughing]

841
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:04,533
Yeah!

842
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:05,701
Woo!

843
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:08,237
Now that's how you
take a bitch out!

844
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,372
[chuckles]

845
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,476
Run!

846
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:15,277
[screaming]

847
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,482
[screaming]

848
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,384
Come on,
back to the boat!

849
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:22,785
Come on!

850
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:24,286
Get up!

851
00:50:24,288 --> 00:50:26,222
[screaming]

852
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,726
Oh, dammit!

853
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,564
Oh my god!

854
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:43,272
[screaming]

855
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,682
Fuck you!

856
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,586
Fuck you!

857
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:02,825
[screaming]

858
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,860
[growls]

859
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,381
This is it?

860
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:01,283
I spent two days interviewing
Abbott McMullen

861
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,618
for my Crowley story.

862
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,720
You never quite get the
smell out of your sinuses.

863
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:06,722
And you think he's just
gonna hand over the ashes

864
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:08,491
of Thomas Crowley to you?

865
00:52:08,493 --> 00:52:11,894
No, but he'll hand
them over to you.

866
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:13,762
Wait&what?

867
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,832
Stay here.

868
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:18,868
Where the fuck
am I gonna go?

869
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,908
Amanda, this is crazy!
You can't do this!

870
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:30,346
you can personally haul
my little ass to jail.

871
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:32,748
'Cause this is the
last chance we've got

872
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,183
to bring this to an end.

873
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:35,384
[scoffs] How?

874
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:38,454
That girl is Samson
Dunston's bloodline.

875
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:44,627
Hi, Mr. McMullen.

876
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:45,528
Remember me?

877
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,395
Who are you?

878
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:47,596
I'm Amanda Fowler.

879
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:48,564
From the paper?

880
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:50,266
Yes, sir.

881
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:51,367
I ought to shoot you dead

882
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,235
for waking me up at
this crazy hour.

883
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:55,604
It's the middle of the
night for Chrissakes!

884
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:56,739
It's 8:45.

885
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:58,574
Well, that's what I said!

886
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:02,478
Who is the colored?

887
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,579
Who's the--

888
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:05,814
Deputy Winslow,
Jefferson Parish.

889
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:08,250
And you do know that the
whole Civil Rights thing

890
00:53:08,252 --> 00:53:10,686
did take place,
just FYI.

891
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,321
I didn't do nothing
to that little girl.

892
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:14,456
There ain't no crime
in looking.

893
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:16,258
I'm sure you didn't.

894
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,195
Not a nice tolerant
man such as yourself.

895
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:21,397
This here is harassment.

896
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:22,965
I'll have your job.

897
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:26,202
After tonight, yeah,
you just might have my job.

898
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,938
Mr. McMullen, we just wanted
to visit with you about

899
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,273
a matter of extreme urgency.

900
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:32,308
What?
Was there a fire?

901
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,410
She's fine, she's fine.

902
00:53:34,412 --> 00:53:36,579
Um, we just wanted to
have a minute of your time,

903
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:37,980
just a minute.

904
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:46,388
Well, all I got's a minute.

905
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,791
Got a lot of irons in
the fire, you know?

906
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:50,759
Oh, yes, I know.
I know that.

907
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:51,860
Thank you.

908
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:53,929
Thank you very much.

909
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:55,898
And don't you try
to steal nothing.

910
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,634
I got eyes in the
front of my head.

911
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:00,369
Why don't you just offer
me some fried chicken

912
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:01,704
and watermelon
while you're at it?

913
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:03,772
I ain't got no food.

914
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:05,474
It was a joke.

915
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:07,710
You mumble.
I can't understand you people.

916
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:09,878
You--forget it.

917
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,480
What?

918
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:12,348
Forget it!

919
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,449
Faggot?!

920
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:15,317
I ain't no faggot.

921
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:18,821
[scoffs]
Well, come on in.

922
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:28,797
If you're here to talk
about Victor Crowley again,

923
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:31,900
I told you everything
I had to say yesterday.

924
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:34,003
Well, actually, Abbot,
that was 10 years ago.

925
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:35,504
What?
Speak up!

926
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:38,007
I-I'm not here to talk
about Victor Crowley.

927
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:39,408
Well, then what the
hell do you want?

928
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:41,677
We are here on
official police business.

929
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:43,646
You've got a piece
of evidence

930
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:45,281
that is part of our
investigation.

931
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:46,548
We wanted to borrow it

932
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,751
and then bring it
right back to ya.

933
00:54:48,753 --> 00:54:50,286
And where is your warrant?

934
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:51,887
You're not under arrest.
It's okay.

935
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:53,656
You're not in any kind of
trouble, Mr. McMullen.

936
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:55,357
We just want to borrow
an item from you

937
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,492
and return it to you briefly.

938
00:54:56,494 --> 00:54:57,593
You know you mumble
too much.

939
00:54:57,595 --> 00:54:59,928
I can't even understand you.

940
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:03,032
Oh, you know, um,
when last we spoke

941
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:05,801
you told me that these are
Thomas Crowley's ashes.

942
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:06,669
Isn't that right?

943
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:07,503
No.

944
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:08,937
Them's my uncle's ashes.

945
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:11,674
That's right.
These are your uncle's ashes.

946
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:13,542
What the hell you doing,
you little harlot?

947
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,477
I am just gonna borrow
these for a little bit.

948
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:16,412
We're gonna bring
him right back.

949
00:55:16,414 --> 00:55:17,946
Oh, oh,
over my dead body!

950
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:20,416
Mr. Mullin,
I'm afraid I must insist.

951
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:23,852
I'll bring your uncle's
ashes back to you personally.

952
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:25,921
What the hell do you want
with my uncle's ashes anyway?

953
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:28,524
I'm taking these as evidence.

954
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:30,526
This is part of a
police investigation.

955
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:33,495
- Show him my badge?
- Show your badge.

956
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:38,600
It's official
police business, sir.

957
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:39,702
That's right.

958
00:55:39,704 --> 00:55:41,437
Who did you rob this from?

959
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:43,572
Who did I--
You know, that's it.

960
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:45,774
I'm through.
I'm done.

961
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,710
Abbott, I promise we'll
be bringing him back.

962
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:49,378
We'll be bringing
him right back.

963
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,580
I said over my dead body.

964
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:54,850
Well, then you
leave me no choice.

965
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,452
Go ahead, shoot me.

966
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:57,353
Go on, do it!

967
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:59,054
Shoot a defenseless old man.

968
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:01,390
Go on,
pull the trigger.

969
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:04,860
Abbott, I'm sorry but we are
leaving now with this urn.

970
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:05,928
Open the door!

971
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:06,895
Do it, shoot me!

972
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:08,030
Go on, do it.

973
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:10,132
[chuckles] Yeah,
I knew you's a coward.

974
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:11,734
You come barging
into my house

975
00:56:11,736 --> 00:56:13,869
with some negro thief
claiming to be a cop.

976
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,704
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

977
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,806
I am a veteran.

978
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,808
I went all the way to Korea.

979
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,744
Fuckin' white people!

980
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,080
That's right, run, boy!

981
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:26,615
[chuckles]
Pow!

982
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:28,517
Yeah, I gotcha.

983
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:29,818
Let's get the hell
outta here!

984
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,587
Is it-is it still
following us?

985
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:32,988
Come on.

986
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,957
Okay, he knocked
the wind out of me.

987
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:36,392
What are you doing?
No stopping!

988
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:37,760
Stopping,
stopping is very bad!

989
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,697
[screaming]

990
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,836
Who the hell was that?

991
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:50,906
Well, he was a paramedic.
Doesn't he work with you?

992
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,609
Yeah, but I-I
don't know his name.

993
00:56:53,611 --> 00:56:54,777
Hey?

994
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:55,878
We gotta get back
to the boat.

995
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,813
You're going the
wrong way.

996
00:56:57,815 --> 00:56:58,914
See?

997
00:56:58,916 --> 00:56:59,948
Fuck that guy!

998
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,417
Well, I--

999
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,521
[distant growling]

1000
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,996
[grunts]

1001
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:22,871
You gotta be fuckin'
kidding me.

1002
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,674
[growls]

1003
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:34,550
[screaming]

1004
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,124
You're Samson's bloodline.

1005
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,693
You have to be the one to
give the ghost what it wants.

1006
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:46,028
The fuck I do.

1007
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,663
You can't bring me
back there!

1008
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:49,164
We don't have a choice.

1009
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:50,699
The one who caused
the ghost death

1010
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:52,601
is the only one who
can make it right.

1011
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:54,937
I had nothing to do
with this.

1012
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:56,505
But your father did.

1013
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:59,475
this is the only way
to make it right.

1014
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:01,643
Why are you just coming
up with this plan tonight?

1015
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:05,147
I told you I approached
your father years ago.

1016
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:06,915
It didn't exactly
go over well.

1017
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:08,917
And until you waltzed
into the police station

1018
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:10,486
wearing Victor
Crowley's innards,

1019
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:12,821
what proof did I have
that he was real?

1020
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:13,989
- No!
- Stop!

1021
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:14,823
- You're gonna get us killed!
- No! Stop it, Marybeth!

1022
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,792
- Stop!
- You can't take me back!

1023
00:58:16,794 --> 00:58:18,694
Turn the fuckin' car around.
You can't--

1024
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:20,128
You have to go,
Marybeth!

1025
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,497
- No!
- Only you!

1026
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:23,899
Only you!
You're the one!

1027
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:25,801
[grunts]

1028
00:58:25,803 --> 00:58:27,703
Oh, gee.
Oh.

1029
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:29,905
[panting]

1030
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,274
Oh, God.

1031
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:33,542
Come on, man,
let's go!

1032
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:35,277
What's wrong with this one?

1033
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:36,211
I don't have the keys.

1034
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:37,613
What? Why?

1035
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:38,981
I work with a bunch
of redneck racist.

1036
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:40,249
They won't let me
drive anything.

1037
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:42,084
Christ almighty, let's go!

1038
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:46,054
Fuck it.

1039
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:47,022
Back in the ambulance.

1040
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,824
Move it!

1041
00:58:48,826 --> 00:58:50,225
[growling]

1042
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:57,633
Shit!

1043
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,620
[screams]

1044
00:59:18,622 --> 00:59:21,123
This is Sheriff Fowler
of Jefferson Parish.

1045
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:23,091
- This is Sheriff Fowler&
- Fuck!

1046
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,660
This is Sheriff
Louis Fowler--

1047
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:26,562
Goddamn it's dead!

1048
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:27,896
Does that work?

1049
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,665
- Yeah.
- Thank God.

1050
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:34,770
This is Sheriff Fowler,
Jefferson Parish PD.

1051
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:36,271
S-O-S, I repeat, S-O-S.

1052
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:38,340
We are under attack
in Honey Island Swamp.

1053
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:40,776
<i>This is the National Guard's</i>
<i>frequency, Sheriff Fowler.</i>

1054
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:42,177
<i>Did you say you</i>
<i>are under attack?</i>

1055
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:45,080
We need help immediately,
okay?

1056
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:48,784
Listen, you gotta send military
assistance or something

1057
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:51,153
as soon as possible, okay?

1058
00:59:51,155 --> 00:59:52,854
We're-we're pinned down here.

1059
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:54,923
We got SWAT team
officers dead,

1060
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:58,860
we've got fuckin' half of
Louisiana police department

1061
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:00,662
is dead.

1062
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:02,297
<i>Who's attacking you,</i>
<i>sheriff?</i>

1063
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,838
Victor Crowley.

1064
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,674
<i>Repeat that?</i>

1065
01:00:12,676 --> 01:00:13,842
Crazed gunmen.

1066
01:00:13,844 --> 01:00:15,944
and-and they're firing
everything they've got.

1067
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,245
We need military assistance.

1068
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:18,814
You gotta send some kind
of chopper or something,

1069
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:21,049
airlift us the
fuck out of here!

1070
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:22,084
<i>Understood, sheriff.</i>

1071
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:24,286
<i>We are dispatching air</i>
<i>support immediately.</i>

1072
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:25,754
<i>What are your coordinates?</i>

1073
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:29,858
I ain't got no fuckin'
coordinates, you moron!

1074
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,760
I'm in Honey Island
fuckin' Swamp!

1075
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:35,931
There's a six major league
fuckin' police boats

1076
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:37,699
that will be parked
alongside the shore.

1077
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:39,067
That's where we'll be,
okay?

1078
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:41,370
Pinned down in an
ambulance taking heavy fire!

1079
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:43,405
<i>We are on our way.</i>
<i>Hold tight.</i>

1080
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:44,973
[sighing]

1081
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,945
Finally.

1082
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:53,181
Fuckin' finally
somethin' goes right.

1083
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:54,650
Wait.

1084
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:55,851
Be quiet.

1085
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:56,685
What?

1086
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:58,053
He's gone.

1087
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,957
Nobody move.

1088
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:03,158
Maybe he gave up.

1089
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,694
Even if he did,

1090
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:08,830
nobody steps outside
this fuckin' boat.

1091
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:11,299
Nobody touches anything
without my say so.

1092
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:12,834
Do you understand me?

1093
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,903
Sounds good.

1094
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:32,688
We're staying put till the
National Guard gets here.

1095
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:38,193
Randy.

1096
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,763
That guy's name
was Randy.

1097
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,368
I knew his name.

1098
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:54,309
What is that?

1099
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:58,747
Shut up and listen.

1100
01:01:58,749 --> 01:01:59,981
Oh!

1101
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:01,016
[gasps]

1102
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:02,818
Where the fuck
he get a grinder?

1103
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,821
Oh, shit!
It's a gas belt sander.

1104
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,022
It was in the evidence pile

1105
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:08,290
outside the boat with
those other weapons.

1106
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:11,993
Oh, oh, okay, okay,
okay, I put it there.

1107
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:16,264
My bad.

1108
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:21,570
Oh, shit!

1109
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,885
We really need to call the
sheriff and let him know&

1110
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:39,254
Elliot, Elliot, no.

1111
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,923
he will order you to take
me and Marybeth back.

1112
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,925
- Yeah, probably.
- And then what?

1113
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:47,162
- I'll say I pulled your gun.
- Yeah, right.

1114
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:48,330
I'll do whatever
it takes, Elliot,

1115
01:02:48,332 --> 01:02:49,898
because I am not wrong.

1116
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,399
I am not.

1117
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,004
I'm sorry.

1118
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:57,806
Oh, don't do it, Elliot.
Please don't do this.

1119
01:02:57,808 --> 01:03:00,008
Sheriff, you there?

1120
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,944
Lou, come back.

1121
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,312
Louis?

1122
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:08,350
This is Deputy Winslow.
Heather, you there?

1123
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:11,186
<i>Where the hell have</i>
<i>you been all night?</i>

1124
01:03:11,188 --> 01:03:13,088
<i>Shit is going down</i>
<i>out on Honey Island.</i>

1125
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,189
Yeah, I'm aware.

1126
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:15,857
I'm boarding the boat now.

1127
01:03:15,859 --> 01:03:17,526
<i>Do you have that</i>
<i>Dunston girl with you?</i>

1128
01:03:17,528 --> 01:03:19,394
<i>Please, tell me</i>
<i>that isn't true.</i>

1129
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:21,096
Look, I can explain
everything.

1130
01:03:21,098 --> 01:03:23,331
Just--when's the last time
you talked to the sheriff?

1131
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,332
<i>It's been almost two hours</i>

1132
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,034
<i>since we've heard from</i>
<i>anyone out there.</i>

1133
01:03:26,036 --> 01:03:27,502
<i>But the National Guard</i>
<i>received a distress call</i>

1134
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:29,971
<i>from a paramedic boat</i>
<i>and they're on their way in.</i>

1135
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,439
<i>What the hell is</i>
<i>happening out there?</i>

1136
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:33,809
Look, who-who placed
the distress call?

1137
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:36,311
<i>Why did you take the</i>
<i>suspect out of her cell?</i>

1138
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:39,047
Who sent out
the distress call?

1139
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:40,348
<i>They said</i>
<i>it was the sheriff.</i>

1140
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,149
<i>He said there's a</i>
<i>group of gunmen</i>

1141
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,851
<i>attacking them</i>
<i>or something.</i>

1142
01:03:42,853 --> 01:03:44,820
<i>We can't get a response</i>
<i>from anyone here.</i>

1143
01:03:44,822 --> 01:03:46,822
Don't you see
Louis is alive?

1144
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,123
Yeah, two hours ago!

1145
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,257
He called in the military.

1146
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:51,259
He said it was a
group of gunmen.

1147
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:52,961
Don't you get it?

1148
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:56,431
He did that so that he would
be sure that they would come.

1149
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:58,533
What's he gonna say?
Victor Crowley's attacking us?

1150
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:00,268
You gotta think about this.

1151
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,536
We have got to
get out there

1152
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,104
and we gotta get
out there now!

1153
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:05,607
And then what?

1154
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:07,442
And then we make sure
she puts that monster

1155
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:10,145
back in his grave
where he belongs.

1156
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:19,855
Oh, shit!

1157
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:20,956
Should we run for it?

1158
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:22,424
Where?
Back to the woods?

1159
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:24,359
No, to his boat.

1160
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,895
While this fucker is distracted
sawing through this wall,

1161
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:29,164
let's open the door and
run for the other boat.

1162
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:30,365
Even if you get
a head start,

1163
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,300
there's no way the three
of us will make it.

1164
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:34,002
It's like he's
everywhere at once.

1165
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:38,974
What are you doing?

1166
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:40,275
I don't know.
I don't know.

1167
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:42,143
We have to find something
to fight back with.

1168
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:43,278
The RPG didn't take him.

1169
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,146
Do you think a
couple of needles will?

1170
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:46,581
Well, we have to
do something.

1171
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:49,017
[growling]

1172
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,485
[screams]

1173
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,021
We're running out
of time here.

1174
01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:54,422
What's the ETA
on that chopper?

1175
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:56,258
<i>Chopper's coming in</i>
<i>from Baton Rouge.</i>

1176
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,993
<i>ETA 10 minutes.</i>

1177
01:04:57,995 --> 01:04:59,361
We ain't got 10!

1178
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,365
Dammit!

1179
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:06,201
He must have chewed
through the wiring!

1180
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,673
Hey, I see the other boats.
Let's-let's pull around.

1181
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:13,008
We don't have time.

1182
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:14,442
We're close enough.

1183
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,180
You heard her,
let's go.

1184
01:05:19,182 --> 01:05:20,215
Let's go.

1185
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:21,583
[grunts]

1186
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:27,188
Now, listen,
you gotta trust me.

1187
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:32,394
Look, I promise I won't
let anything happen to you.

1188
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,332
You know that promise?

1189
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:38,700
It's fading fast.

1190
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:41,369
Come on,
get it together.

1191
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:43,438
Get your hands off me!

1192
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,473
This will be over soon.

1193
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:47,943
Yeah, it will be.

1194
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,080
[screaming] [grunts]

1195
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:01,289
Stop it!
Stop it!

1196
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,091
Get it off!
Get it off!

1197
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:05,160
[screams]

1198
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:29,718
Sheriff?

1199
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,353
Louis?

1200
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:33,088
Lou!

1201
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,656
Now what?

1202
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,594
- Sheriff?
- Louis, answer me!

1203
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,764
- They're all dead.
- He's not dead!

1204
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:44,733
- He is so dead!
- No, he isn't.

1205
01:06:44,735 --> 01:06:47,135
He called for help.
He's not dead.

1206
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:48,169
- Here!
- No!

1207
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:50,238
Take it. Take it!

1208
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,140
Get out of my face, bitch!

1209
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:53,541
Take it!

1210
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:55,443
Sheriff!

1211
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:00,215
Victor?

1212
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:02,217
Victor, come out.

1213
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:05,286
Come and get your daddy.

01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,337
Why did he stop?

01:07:22,339 --> 01:07:24,773
<i>- Louis?</i>
<i>-</i> Shh!

1219
01:07:24,775 --> 01:07:26,508

<i>Sheriff Fowler?</i>

I think it's them.

Oh, thank God.

Who's Amanda?

1226
01:07:40,057 --> 01:07:42,057
Oh god, it's my wife.

1227
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,459
Okay.

1228
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:46,828

You come out here
to me right now.

1232
01:08:20,363 --> 01:08:23,431
I got something you've
been needing a long time.

<i>Sheriff Fowler!</i>

1234
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,681
Don't even.

1235
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:42,217
I still have ammo.

Don't.

01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,478
Don't. Stop.

1249
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,281
<i>You come out now!</i>

1250
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:16,017
[whimpering]

1251
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,462
Stop.

1252
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:32,167
<i>I got your daddy here,</i>
<i>Victor!</i>

1253
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,941
[screaming]

1254
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,567
Come out!

1255
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:06,768
Come and get your daddy!

1256
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,570
This is bullshit.

1257
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:10,572
Amanda, we need to
find the others.

1258
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:13,675
We found them.

1259
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:15,577
There you go.

1260
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:17,212
Look around.

1261
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:20,615
Victor, come on,
where are you?

1262
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:25,353
He's-He's here.

1263
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:28,456
Freeze!

1264
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:34,796
Oh god.

1265
01:10:34,798 --> 01:10:35,997
On the floor now!

1266
01:10:35,999 --> 01:10:38,366
Don't let anything
happen to her.

1267
01:10:38,368 --> 01:10:40,401
[growls]

1268
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,005
- No.
- Only you.

1269
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:47,575
We can't kill him unless
you put it into his hand.

1270
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:48,576
Go!

1271
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:49,844
You hear me?
You do it.

1272
01:10:49,846 --> 01:10:52,647
You do it.
Do it!

1273
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:01,589
Here.

1274
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:04,659
Don't shoot
until he has it.

1275
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,370
Here he is.

1276
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:28,049
I'm s--I'm sorry for
what they did to you

1277
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:32,887
and I'm-I'm sorry.

1278
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:35,490
[whimpering]

1279
01:11:35,492 --> 01:11:39,560
And I'm sorry for what
my father did to you.

1280
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:56,177
I'm sorry.

1281
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,895
Daddy.

1282
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:17,665
Take it.
Take it.

1283
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,006
[sighs]

1284
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:45,827
- Ah!
- Step back, Marybeth.

1285
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:47,462
I said step back!

1286
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:50,131
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

1287
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:52,867
I'm so sorry.

1288
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:03,878
He's dead.

1289
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:06,681
[growling]

1290
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:08,483
[screaming]

1291
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,453
No, Elliot, no!

1292
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:16,391
Elliot, no!

1293
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:18,025
Give him the ashes!

1294
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:24,766
[screams]

1295
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,871
I knew you were real.

1296
01:13:29,873 --> 01:13:30,772
[whimpering]

1297
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:36,444
I came to save you.

1298
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:40,548
[screaming]

1299
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:51,459
[screaming]

1300
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,136
[groans]

1301
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,955
Here's daddy,
you motherfucker!

1302
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:27,628
[groans]

1303
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:28,222
Got to get up.

1304
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:29,657
Get up.

1305
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:33,094
Get up.

1306
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:35,830
Fuckin' do it already!

1307
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:37,999
[panting]

1308
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:43,170
Just one more time.

1309
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,807
Come on, do it.

1310
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:49,043
Come on, do it.
Come on, do it.

1311
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,545
Come on, do it.

1312
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:53,548
Come on,
fuckin' do it already!

1313
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:56,217
Come on, get up!

1314
01:15:56,219 --> 01:16:00,121
Oh, goddammit,

1315
01:16:00,123 --> 01:16:02,223
Fuckin' do it already!

1316
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,828
Fuck it!

1317

01:16:18,841 --> 01:16:20,908
[coughing]

1319
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:48,135
Hey!

01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:51,739
Hey!
