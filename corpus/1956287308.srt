We're clear?

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,792
Uh, seven hours, 15 minutes.

15
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,110

We have a viable cortex.
Do you concur?

20
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
I concur.

21

This man is dead.

Yet his neurological data
is still accessible.

24
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,399
We are going to take his biological brain,
imprint it into that synthetic brain,

25
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,153
to replicate the human mind.

26
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,233

No, they've vocalized before,

I can't tell you how amazing
that would have been eight months ago.

Today, it just annoys the shit out of me.

It's progress, undeniable progress.

100
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,596
In my world,
progress is measured in results,

101
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,000
which we don't have.

102
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,994
The truth is, I'm not sure
how much longer I can keep the lights on.

103
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,559
Turns out, colossal and repeated failure
tends to spook shareholders.

This is my life's work.

I moved my family here, made sacrifices.
I promise you, I am this close.

Well, it just isn't close enough,
is it, Bill?

How's it going? How was your day?

Matt!

[Matt] Not in the house, I know.

The troll will not stop spying

- It is called a spy drone.
- Okay.

Hey, nugget.

Can you feed him once a day?
But don't overfeed him.

- I'll show you the food. Come on.
- Okay.

128
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,519
Hey, uh, you talked to Jones?

129
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,795
Something like that.

130
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,656
Okay, well, what did he say?
Did you get fired?

131
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,115
- What's "fired"?
- No, I didn't get fired.

132

- Daddy.

- Nobody got fired.

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,156
Well, I thought you were a goner, man.

135
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,799
Wait, what's going on?

136
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,032
Uh, our test subject ripped
itself apart earlier today.

137
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,793
- It was pretty brutal.
- What's "brutal"?

138
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,990
It spoke, Mona.

139
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,398
345, the test subject.

140
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,714
It actually spoke.

141
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,834
It spoke?
If it could speak, then it could feel.

142
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,913
We shut it down as soon as possible.

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,856
You can't keep bringing people
back from the dead

144
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,519
until you have this stuff worked out.

145
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,675
How many times have you had a patient
flatline in ER and you brought them back?

146
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,911
My patients don't rip themselves apart.

147
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,231
She's got a point there, William.
[chuckles]

148
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,993
I should probably, uh...

149
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,119
find Sophie for the fish situation.

150
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,475
William, honey, I believe in you.

151
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,713
But I don't like where this is headed.

152
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,236
People could suffer.

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,993
The first heart transplant
patient survived 18 days.

154
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,158
He suffered. Was that wrong?

155
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,114
No. No.

156
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
[William] I'm on the verge
of a breakthrough, Mona.

157
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,270
Soldiers, accident victims, Alzheimer's.

158
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,352
Lives that won't have to be cut short.

159
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,956
But something's preventing the synthetic
from achieving watershed consciousness.

160
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,710
Maybe there's more that
makes us human, like a soul.

161
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,798
We're the sum total of what has happened
to us and how we've processed it.

162
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,958
That's what makes us us.
It's all neurochemistry.

163
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,397
Do you really believe that?
That's all I am?

164
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Your children?

165
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,396
Just pathways, electrical signals
and chemistry?

166
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,430
You have kids that love you
and a wife that adores you.

167
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,913
And we have a scientist.

168
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,280
Do you think I should quit?

169
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,589
- [Zoe] Hi.
- [both] Hi.

170
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,677
I'm just worried you're losing sight
of what's right and wrong.

171
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,995
I won't.

172
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Trust me.

173
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
[Ed] Okay, have fun.

174
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,391
Oh, I'm gonna get you back.

175
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,754
What's the boat called again?

176
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,475
It's... [sighs]
It's called the <i>Cheatin' Hussy.</i>

- [William] All right, thanks.

180
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,831
- We'll see you Sunday night.
- Yeah. Okay, man.

181
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Everybody in?

182
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
[Mona] Seat belts.

183
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:43,360
The Foster family ferry to Funtown
is ready to sail.

184
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,874
- [Zoe] Yay!
- [Matt] Really, Dad?

185
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,590
- Actually...
- Hoist the mainsail, Ahab.

186
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,520
[thunder rumbles, cracks]

187
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,113
I spy, with my little eye,
something that is...

188
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,590
Bored, embarrassed?
Possibly adopted?

189
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,680
That would be me.

190
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,354
Hey, Dad, when we get there,
can we go fishing on the boat?

191
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,679
- Absolutely.
- Are we almost there?

192
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,195
Well, we could just wait
for the boat to float by.

193
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,914
You know what they say.

194
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,310
If you don't like the weather,
just wait five minutes.

195
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,880
[thunder rumbles]

196
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,515
I can't see anything.
Can you see anything?

197
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,880
I feel like we should pull over.

198
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,232
- [truck horn blaring]
- [Zoe and Mona scream]

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,150
Okay? Everybody okay?

200
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,551
- Holy shit! Holy shit!
- That was close.

201
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,314
- [thunder cracks]
- [hail pelting]

202
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,200
- Whoa!
- [Mona gasps]

203
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,839
- [glass shatters]
- [Zoe] Daddy!

204
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,800
- [William] Hold on!
- [Sophie] Oh, my God! Mom!

205
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,429
[Zoe] Mommy!

206
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,313
[children screaming]

207
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,199
- [Sophie] Zoe, hold on!
- [Zoe] Mommy!

208
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,353
[Zoe] Daddy! [shrieks]

209
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,913
[glass shatters]

210
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,879
[water sloshes]

211
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,754
Mona. Mona.

212
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,879
Kids?

213
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,440
Oh, God

214
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,518
Sophie! Matt!

215
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,557
Zoe! Zoe!

216
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,079
[William groans]

217
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,440
Oh, Zoe!

218
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,391
Oh, my baby girl!

219
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,315
[sobbing]

220
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,000
Mona! Mona!

221
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,079
[dialing]

222
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,597
[line ringing]

223
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
[sets brake]

224
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,519
[car alert chiming]

225
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,830
William?

226
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,079
What's up? What's going on?

227
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,913
[William] I told you, no questions.

228
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,195
Where is it?

229
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,034
It's all in the back.

230
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Oh, shit.

231
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,549
William.
What the hell happened, man?

232
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,116
I need you to do something for me, Ed.

233
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,157
Oh, no. No way.

234
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,152
- I can't.
- They are not gone!

235
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,995
Not yet.

236
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,836
William, we need to call the police.

237
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,438
Or something, man. I mean...

238
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,914
William. What the hell?

239
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,912
Boot the mapping sequence.

240
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,515
[Ed] We cannot do this, man.

241
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,113
Boot the mapping sequence, Ed!

242
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,277
[device beeping]

243
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,599
[monitor hums]

244
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,151
[computer] <i>Edward Whittle.
Access granted.</i>

245
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,270
[Ed] Okay.

246
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,313
Just because I think I can do it,
doesn't necessarily mean I <i>can,</i> okay?

247
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,995
There is a reason
human cloning is banned.

248
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,754
And just because it's hard to do
is only half the issue here.

249
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,109
Just let me know what we need.

250
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,760
[sighs] God. Look, William,
I know you've been through hell,

251
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,355
but you need to understand
something here, okay?

252
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,956
The first few animals
I cloned came out blind.

253
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,713
Their skulls were deformed.

254
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,269
Their internal organs weren't
internal anymore, man.

255
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,192
That's what a mistake here means.

256
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,509
And if we make a mistake,

257
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,120
I need to know
if you're prepared to terminate.

258
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,397
We just won't make a mistake.

259
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,076
[sighs]

260
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,549
Okay, uh...

261
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,834
[sighs]

262
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,435
Those are pods.

263
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,317
Can I clone a human being in one?

264
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,960
Technically, yeah, it's possible.

265
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,110
But, look, William, if this works,

266
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,318
their brains are gonna
come out like infants,

267
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,034
okay, a total blank slate,

268
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,635
and not to rub salt
in the wound here tonight,

269
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,155
but you haven't exactly
worked out all the kinks

270
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,674
for transferring a mind.

271
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,256
Do I need to remind you of
what's happened every time you've tried?

272
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,830
We've transferred biological to biological
on cloned animals.

273
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,833
- Rats, monkeys.
- Not human beings, man.

274
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,718
You've seen it. We can do it.

275
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,480
What if something horrible goes wrong?

276
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,957
Something already has.

277
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,716
Ed, nobody can know what happened.

278
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,310
[whispering]
I need you to get rid of the bodies.

279
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,479
[nervously] William, I don't know if I...

280
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,517
I'm begging you. I can't do it.

281
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,233
[scoffs] Okay.

282
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,789
Okay, I'll, uh...
I'll meet you at the house.

283
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,475
[door clangs shut]

284
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,551
[truck beeping]

285
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,160
[beeping]

286
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,034

[lock clangs]

288
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
What's in the barrels?

289
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,233
Uh...

290
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,312
Components, building blocks.

291
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,596
Amino acids, fructose, accelerants.

292
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,036
You know, just a ton of primordial ooze.

293
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,397
Everything you need to build a... "you,"
you know?

294
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,320
There's only three pods.

295
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,799
Three's not four. I need four pods.

296
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,917
Yeah, I know. Well, there weren't four.

297
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,473
I need four pods, Ed.

298
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,758
I can maybe get another one,
next quarter, maybe.

299
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,831
Do not tell me there aren't four!

300
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,513
What do you want me to do here?

301
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,956
Okay, these pods are $1.7 million each.

302
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,512
I'm not a freakin' genie here.
I can't sneeze out another pod.

303
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,839
Sorry, William.

304
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,509
[Ed] William?

305
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,355
You all right?

306
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,675
[William] Pick a name.

307
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,880
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

308
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,394
There aren't enough pods.

309
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,595
Pick a name.

310
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,792
No way, man. You pick it.

311
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,159
Please? Please, goddamn it.
Please, pick a name!

312
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
William, no, no!

313
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,840
- Pick the name!
- No!

314
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,231
This one's on you.
You wanted this. You pick it.

315
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,199
You pick the damn name.

316
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,396
[sobbing]

317
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,876
[indistinct voices]

318
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,432
[Ed] You gotta watch the levels.
The levels are everything.

319
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,719
I've seeded the pods with their DNA.

320
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,032
But you got to keep an eye on them
all the time. Never leave them alone.

321
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,079
If the chemical balance isn't maintained,
the clones will die,

322
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,437
and we can't just start over,
so, you need to watch the levels.

323
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,274
Okay, and they'll all be done
at the same time, right?

324
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
[Ed] Okay.

325
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,996
Uh... Ah, shit.
This just got a lot more difficult.

326
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,076
Tell me you can do that.

327
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,673
Uh... yeah, yeah, I just gotta
compensate with something.

328
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,797
- Ed?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

329
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,917
Yeah, it can be done.

330
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,156
Oh, uh, where is your backup generator?

331
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,440
In case we lose power.

332
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,197
- I don't have a generator, Ed.
- Okay.

333
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,637
Is there something I should know?

334
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,514
Yeah. The pods can't lose power.

335
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,792
Ever. If there is a seven-second
power interruption,

336
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,336
well, then,
that will throw off the levels,

337
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,096
and I just told you
how important those things are.

338
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,033
- So, yeah, we need a generator.
- It's 2:00 a.m.

339
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Nothing's open.

340
00:25:07,602 --> 00:25:10,035
Well, shit, man, I don't know.
What do you want from me?

341
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,589
I can't think of everything. All right?

342
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,755
I am so far in over my head at this point.
And so are you, man. You know that?

343
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,120
Is there anything else?

344
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,237
Uh, no, I think that's it.

345
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,478
[motorbike revving]

346
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,189
[Ed] That is a lot of batteries.

347
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,518
In 17 days, they're coming out.

348
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,600
You got till then to figure out
how to give them watershed consciousness.

349
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,756
If, by some miracle,
we can pull this off...

350
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,400
what about Zoe?

351
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,316
Every memory they had is in here.

352
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,799
I'll delete her.

353
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,189
I'll delete the memory of her

I'll corrupt the memory

00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,791
Upload the new neural map.

360

Good morning, officers.

Do you speak Spanish?

389
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,879
- No. Sorry.
- Well, pardon my English.

390
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,997
I'm Officer Perez. This is Rodriguez.

391
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,470
We're following up
on some recent car robberies.

392
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,920
Somebody stole the batteries
out of every car on the block.

393
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,754
How odd.

394
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,354

No. No, they didn't.

Yeah.

00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,640
Nothing out of the ordinary?

399
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,438
Well, if you see anything
or anybody suspicious, let us know.

400
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,395
Will do, Officer.

401
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,155

[Jones] Edward.

406
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,517
I feel compelled to comment

407

on the noticeable lack
of Bill around here.

408
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,910
Wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

409
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,638
Uh, well, just that he has pneumonia.

410
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,313
Uh, the walking pneumonia.

a message for me?

I spoke to the board today.

Unless 345 works, we're getting shut down
at the end of the quarter.

Shut down?

00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,838
Would you like a nice reference letter?

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,477
Uh... yes.

418
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,876
Uh, I'm sure he'll be in soon.

00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
Shit.

530
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,276
Ed.

531
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,835
Ed. Do you see that?

532
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,240
I still don't know why it happens.

533
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,310
If I don't know what causes it, how can I
be certain it won't happen to them?

534
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,153
Yeah, well, Christ, man,

535
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,471
you should have thought
about that 17 days ago.

536
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,839
The accelerants follow
the DNA profile precisely, okay?

537
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,913
You keep them in the tanks,
they keep aging.

538
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,957
Your wife, uh,
two weeks from now,

539
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,838
cancer maybe.

540
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,195
Your daughter, menopause.

541
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,000
Your son, I don't know,
male pattern baldness

542
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,400
and a droopy old man sack.

543
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,713
My point is, in a couple of days,
even if you do figure this out,

544
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,837
they will have aged years

545
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,640
beyond the age they were
when they died.

546
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,594
How are you gonna explain that?

547
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,992
[laughs] How are you not freaking out
right now, William?

548
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,871
- I'm trying to think.
- [Ed] Okay, good.

549
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,316
Yeah, sure, you think.
I'll think, too.

550
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,596
I'll think about what's it like in jail,

551
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,351
or when Bionyne sues us
for $30 billion, or...

552
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,669
What? What are you doing?

553
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,431
I'll sedate them, induce a coma.

554
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,835
It'll keep their minds in a blank state...

555
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,040
till I figure it out.

556
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,519
What if you don't figure it out?

557
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,559
You can't keep them sedated
for more than 72 hours, tops.

558
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,758
After that, you're gonna have
to make a very tough decision.

559
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,635
Drain the pod.

560
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,714
[alarm sounding]

561
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,239
[Mona gasps]

562
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,236
[breathes deeply]

563
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,991
[Ed] Got her?
Whoa! She's slippery, man.

564
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
[Mona groaning]

565
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,675
Hold her!

566
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,036
[Mona groans]

567
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
[Ed] Holy shit.

568
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,156
[chuckles]

569
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,594
I did it. We did it.

570
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,754
She's perfect, man.

571
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,080
It's better than successful.
I mean, this is perfect.

572
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,830
Holy shit.

573
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,560
Okay.

574
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,760
This should keep their bodies
fed for a while.

575
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,197
And, uh,
drop some more off tomorrow.

576
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,109
Thank you.

577
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,199
You got it.

578
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,434
You got three days, man.

579
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,912
Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

580
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,156
Yeah.

581
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,120
Hey, we made clones today.

582
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,839
You can add that to your resume.

583
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,639
[William] <i>Margaret, energize the body.</i>

584
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,798
<i>Sergeant Kelly. Do you hear me?</i>

585
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,078
[Kelly groans] <i>Who am I?</i>

586
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,350
[Kelly breathing erratically] <i>Who am I?</i>

587
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,039
[alert chimes]

588
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,554
<i>Sergeant.</i>

589

[Kelly breathing erratically]

590
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,515
<i>Sergeant.</i>

591
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,116
- [Kelly screaming]
- [William] <i>Turn it off.</i>

592
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,395
<i>The imprint failed.</i>

593
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,550
[screaming continues]

594
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,671
[equipment crashing]

595
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,150
- [monitor beeping]
- [screaming continues]

596
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,799
[William] <i>Turn it off.</i>

597
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,794
[Zoe laughing]

598
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,354
[monitor beeping speeds up]

599
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,119
I thought I could do it.

600
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,510
Sorry.

601
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,440
[phone rings]

602
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,520
[rings]

603
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,030
- What?
- [Jones] <i>Bill.</i>

604
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,879
Have you been avoiding my call?

605
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,916
<i>Bill? Bill?</i>

606
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,875
What?

607
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,311
<i>Do you realize how much money has been
invested in this project?</i>

608

<i>People are counting on you.
I'm counting on you.</i>

610
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,680
Holy shit.

611
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,474
<i>- And we're almost out of time.</i>
- Holy shit.

612
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,880
<i>What did you say?</i>

00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,394

00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,153
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

615
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,550
- [line clicks]
- Bill, are you still there?

616
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,638
We've been looking
in the wrong place.

617
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,598
You're really close to me, man.

618
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,797
No, it's not the mind,
it's not the brain, Ed.

619
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,075
It's the body.

620
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,756
- The body?
- [William] It's so obvious. So elegant.

621
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,760
So simple!

622
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,117
Hey, man, let's pump the brakes
on the crazy train, all right?

623
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,869
- Follow me, Edward.
- What...

624
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,551
[footsteps climbing stairs]

625
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,955
Dead flat.

626
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,240
Watch this.

627
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,674
[electronic hum, monitor beeps]

628
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,720
[hum, monitor beeps]

629
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,474
Her mind is a blank slate.

630
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,835
Comatose.

631
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,480
She's never experienced
a moment of consciousness.

632
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,916
Yet she's breathing.
Her heart's pumping.

633
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,633
But that's not a sign of consciousness.

634
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,757
Those are involuntary functions.

635
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,513
All controlled in the brain.

636
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,592
Her brain knows it has a body.

637
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,829
This specific body.
That's what I was missing.

638
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,111
That's why 345 doesn't work.

639
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,716
It has electrodes and wires
connected to steel and titanium.

640
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,350
We're imprinting a biological brain
into a synthetic mind.

641
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,874
But it doesn't know that.

642
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,839
It's looking for its body,
its heart, its lungs.

643
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,070
But it can't find them.

644
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,232
So the lower reptilian brain
freaks out.

645
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,114
It thinks that it's dying,
reacts accordingly

646
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,880
and never has a chance to reach
watershed consciousness.

647
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,280
Oh, shit, yeah.

648
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,317
It's like transplant rejection.

649
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,118
We just have to trick the synthetic mind

650
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,752
into believing that it has its biological,
actual flesh-and-blood body.

651
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,274
That's the solution.

652
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,671
That may be 345's solution, but what does
this have to do with your family?

653
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,598
They're not robots, William.

654
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,473
It has everything to do with my family.

655
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,715
I'll be imprinting her mind

656
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,233
into her own body.

657
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,277
I know it's going to work.

658
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,070
But are you sure? I mean,
we're only gonna get one shot at this.

659
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,990
Stand by to initiate
the neural imprint, Ed.

660
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,760
Ready?

661
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,153
Has that ever mattered?

662
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,593
Initiate the neural imprint.

663
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,712
Commence bio-to-bio protocol.

664
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,157
[electronic pulsing]

665
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,592
Keep an eye on Mona's sensory cortex.

666
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,795
Good.

667
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,194
I'm going temporal.

668
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,989
Parietal.

669
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,749
Limbic.

670
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,596
Vitals?

671
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,476
Vitals are good.

672
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,354
Okay.

673
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,440
Pulse state's good.

674
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,120
All functions good.

675
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,672
Initiating neural imprint.

676
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,116
Incredible.

677
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,315
Imprint completed.

678
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,840
[Ed] What's going on, man?
Nothing's happening.

679
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,240
Can you hear me, Mona?

Shit. Oh, shit. She's rejecting it.

683
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,840
Oh, shit, man,
what are we gonna do?

684
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,920
Wait!

685
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,398
[beeping decelerates]

686
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,475
William?

687
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,920
Baby.

688
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,795
Whoa, whoa.
William, what are you doing?

689
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,590
Putting her to sleep.

690
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,000
I can't have her and the kids
wake up to the house like this.

691
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,640
[Ed] Yeah. Yeah, good thinking.

692
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,518
You have any idea what we just did?

693
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:49,478
I mean, this is the single greatest thing
that I have ever done in my life,

694
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,233
you, anyone has ever done.

695
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,915
I mean, granted,
we can't tell anybody about it,

696
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,639
but, oh, my God!

697
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,394
I mean...

698
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,154
We're talking Nobel Prize, right?

699
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,391
Foster-Whittle?
Scratch that, Whittle-Foster.

700
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,279
[voice fading]
It doesn't have to be alphabetical.

701
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,512
Well, I, uh...
I hope they're gonna be okay.

702
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,757
- We did it.
- Yeah.

703
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,756
All right.

704
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,992
Well, I'll, uh... I'll see you at work.

705
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,676

Kids?

710
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,674
Good morning, William.

711
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,760
[William] Good morning.

712
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,991
So, how is everybody?

713
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,594
- I'm hungry.
- Starving.

714
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,191
I feel great. I'm going for a run.

715
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,676
- Outside?
- You look tired.

716
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,395
Did you sleep okay?

717
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,590
Yeah.

718
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,276
Have a good run.

719
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,192
[Matt] Dad. Dad.

720
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,314
Can I have some pancakes?

721
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,590
Yes.

722
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,399
Yes, you can have
some pancakes, Matthew.

723
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,669
Sophie, you want
some pancakes, too?

724
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,952
- Yeah.
- [William] Great.

725
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,196
Great.

726
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,235
[William] Flapjacks up.

727
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,753
- Hey, can I have French toast?
<i>- Oui.</i>

728
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,674
French toast for the lady.

729
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,356
Coming up.

730
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,676
[labored breathing]

731
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,280
Gross.

732
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,990
Mom, this milk went sour.
Did you go shopping?

733
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,240
- I bought this the other day.
- [Sophie] It's curdled.

734
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,599
- They sold us expired milk.
- Yeah.

735
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,271
Somebody's gonna get a piece of my mind.

736
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,272
- I'll take care of it.
- [phone buzzing]

737
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,160
[William] Work.

738
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,916
I gotta... I got...

739
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,950
Okay.

740
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,114

- Yeah.
- [Ed] <i>Yeah, hey, it's me.</i>

743
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,437
We got a donor inbound. 37 minutes.
You gotta meet me at the lab, ASAP.

[William] <i>My familyjust woke up.</i>

745
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,269
Congratulations, but it's gonna
be a pretty short reunion

746
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,158

747

<i>- If we get shut down, we get exposed.</i>
- [dish clatters]

748
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,835
- [Mona] Matt, careful.
- [Ed] <i>Are you listening to me?</i>

749
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,314
William, you hearing me?

750
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,759
<i>Hello?</i>

751
00:58:10,761 --> 00:58:12,831
Yeah, okay, I'll be there.

752
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,593
- [blade clangs]
- [Matt] Damn it!

753
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,240
Buddy, you okay?

754
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,035
Yeah, I'm fine.

755
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,516
Are you all right?
You don't seem like yourself today.

756
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,597
I have to go into the lab.

757
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,992
You take off, baby. We're good.

758
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,599
[scoffs] I hate to leave you
on a Saturday.

759
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,879
We'll still be here when you get back.

760
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,876
Okay.

761
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:53,794
[indistinct announcements on PA]

Neural tissue intact.
Protoplasmic integrity approximately 60%.

763
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,320
I make it 55.

764
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,393
[Ed] Still, cortex is viable.
Do you concur?

765
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,790
William?

766
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,874
Negative.

767
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,759
It's too corrupt.

768
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,840
What's going on, man?
Donor was good.

769
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,392
I couldn't do it.

770
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,676
I couldn't put
another person through that.

771
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,235
[scoffs] Well, you picked a hell of a time
to grow a conscience.

772
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,951
I hope you're ready to go to jail,
lose your family,

773
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:48,080
because that's what's gonna happen
if we don't get 345 to work.

774
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,593
So you better figure something out.

775
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,274
Soon.

[Jones] Are you in there, Bill?

778
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,911
Yeah, it's me.

779
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,680
[Jones] Everything okay in there?

780
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,560
All good.

781
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,429
Damn shame about
that donor today, huh?

782
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,553
We'll get the next one, sir.

783
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,395
[Jones] Hope there is a next one, Bill.

Oh, my gosh.

789
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,793
Mom, have you seen my cell phone?

790
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,439
No, I've been looking for mine, too.

791
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,598
Well, your whole social life
doesn't depend on it. Mine does.

792
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,275
- So where did you have it last?
- [Sophie] I have no idea.

793
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,473
Troll, did you take my cell phone?

794
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,917
- No.
- Oh, my God.

795
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,670
[William] Ed!

796
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,720
Hey!

797
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,359
Jesus, are you crying blood?

798
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,231
William, you didn't...

799
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,074
- I did.
- On yourself? Are you out of your mind?

800
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,231
Have you considered
the very real possibility

801
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,232
that you've gone
completely batshit insane?

802
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,993
- That could kill you.
- Ed, I had to.

803
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:22,120
Listen, I'm going to upload
my neural map into 345.

804
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,672
Ed, it's going to be me in there.

805
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,880
- Sure, that makes me feel...
- [man] Edward, William.

806
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,280
Hey, Phil.

807
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,111
We start with a scan of my body.

808
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,635
I take that data, create an algorithm

809
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,554
which will bridge with
my neural imprint in 345.

810
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:44,274
Okay, so you write an algorithm
that tricks the synthetic brain

811
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,034
into thinking that
its real, actual body is there.

812
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,315
Exactly.

813
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:52,470
And with my mind inside,
we'll be able to verify

814
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,359
that the synthetic has reached
watershed consciousness because

815
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,309
I'll be able to ask... myself.

816
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,998
I'm the baseline, Ed.
I'm the control.

817
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,790
<i>It</i> will be me.

818
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,196
I'll start writing the algorithm tonight.

819
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,157
[Ed] Okay, so are we still going
tree shopping tomorrow?

820
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,552
- [Mona] Something's wrong.
- What's wrong?

821
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,920
I don't know, William,
but something's not right with me.

822
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,960
I don't remember what I had
for dinner last night.

823
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,296
I don't remember leaving
the clinic for Christmas break.

824
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,879
And didn't we go on a boat trip?

825
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,998
I don't remember going on a boat trip.
Something's not right with me.

826
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,434
Oh, baby.

827
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,230
Where are the kids?

828
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,075
Asleep.

829
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,397
Sophie has a fever, but she's okay.

830
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,391
Maybe you have what Sophie has.

831
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,949
Maybe.

832
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,199
Why don't you go and lie down and...

833
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,078
see how you feel in the morning?

834
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,594
Yeah.

835
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,109
I'm exhausted.

836
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,959

- Dad! Dad!
- Sophie? Sophie!

01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,994
- Dad, is Mom dead?
- What?

846
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,150
I saw her die, Dad!

847
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,516
- No!
- Dad, are you sure?

848
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,314
No, it was just a bad dream.
Mommy's okay.

849
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,990
I saw her die!

850
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,072
No, no.

851
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,958
Everything's gonna be all right.

852
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,920
Go back to sleep.

853
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,354
But it felt so real.

854
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,557
- It's just a dream. Mommy's okay.
- You sure?

855
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,836
Yeah. It's okay.

856
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,713
It was just a bad dream.

857
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,437
- Okay.
- Yeah. It's over.

858
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,634

01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,150
All better.

866
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,754
It'll be like it never happened.

867
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:03,876
[Mona] William.

868
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,640
What's going on?

869
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,752
- Mona, can we go upstairs?
- What have you done to Sophie?

870
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,354
I gave her a little sedative.

871
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,318
- You did what? What?
- She's okay.

872
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,473
Mona, please. Let's talk upstairs.

873
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,270
No, William. Tell me the truth.

874
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,873
There was a crash.

875
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,239
You and the kids died.

876
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,593
I brought you back.

01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,719
You're replicas.

878
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,839
Get that thing... off her head.

01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,354
Sophie, and...

884
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,754
and no one has to know.

885
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,474
How could you do this?

886
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,875
I watched our children die.

887
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:55,072
I held your lifeless body in my arms
and I thought...

888
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,599
I could bring you back.

889
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,233
What would you have done?

890
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,435
Hey, Ed!

891
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,556
Hey!

892
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,319
- How you doing?
- [Matt] Very good.

893
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,470
- What's up?
- Hey.

894
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,316
- Good.
- Morning.

895
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,720
Morning.

896
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,071
- Hi, Ed. How are you?
- Hey.

897
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,072
- I'm good, how are you?
- [Mona] Great.

898
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,313
Hey, Matty, come stay here with me.

899
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,359
- But I like this one.
- No, I hate those ones. They're fake.

900
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,872
I think they're... nice.

901
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,475
[scoffs] Come on. Let's look over here.

902
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,616
[Sophie] Mom, check this one out.

903
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,016
[Matt] Think this one's big enough?

904
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,999
So... you got 'em back.

905
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,639
[Mona] You like this one?

906
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,392
- Yeah.
- [Latin music in background]

907
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,118
All right, let's get you a tree.

908
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,678
Maybe... Maybe we should
move back home.

909
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,395
- What?
- We just settled here.

910
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,480
Are you serious, Dad?

911
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,356
- Matt, you missed your plate.
- Idiot.

912
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,635
What?

913
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,515
- Hey, Dad, who is Zoe?
- [glass shatters]

914
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,836
Who?

915
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,957
Someone scribbled "Zoe"
in my closet with a crayon.

916
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,194
There was a bunk bed
in that bedroom.

917
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,840
A bunk bed?

918
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,480
- Are you sure?
- [Mona] I'm not crazy.

919
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,352
I remember photos
in the upstairs hallway.

920
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:24,509
Honey, that thing that happened,
there might be some things...

921
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,640
And I remember
what you look like when you're lying.

922
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,029
[doorbell rings]

923
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,477
<i>Feliz Navidad,</i> Bill.

924
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,157
Mmm, is that lamb I smell?

925
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,317
I'm interrupting dinner, aren't I?

926
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,760
Mona!

927
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,956
- You look stunning.
- Mr. Jones.

928
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,353
Such a lucky man, Bill.

929
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:55,111
What an unexpected pleasure.
Do you care to join us?

930
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,477
Beautiful and generous.
I've heard about women like you.

931
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,069
Thanks, but I wouldn't dream of imposing.

932
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,674
William, can I have a quick word?

933
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,917
Promise I'll have him back
in five minutes.

934
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,109
We're not done.

935
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,955
What brings you by?

936
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,633
Let me ask you something.

937
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,396
Didn't you ever think
this was all a little too easy?

938
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,599
I don't know what you're talking about.

939
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,677
Oh, let me help.

940
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:43,349
Subjects 346, 347, 348.
Bionyne property, Bill.

941
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,993
Desperation has driven many a great man
to accomplish the impossible.

942
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:51,471
Fate caused that car crash.
I just let things play out.

943
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:55,076
Color me impressed,
but now I have a problem.

944
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,600
Three, actually.

945
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,677
Do you know what would happen
if word of this ever got out?

946
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,158
Nobody has to know.
Nobody will ever know.

947
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,390
Mona knows.

948
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,915
How long until Sophie and Matt
start asking questions?

949
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,116
Maybe their friends will.

950
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,995
Lies are messy.

951
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,390
I'm not in the business of messy,
it's risky.

952
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,914
Simple is safe.

953
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,871
Those three subjects in the wild
is something I cannot tolerate.

954
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:28,030
I know how to make 345 work.
That's worth something.

955
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:32,599
Bionyne would be the most successful
biomedical company in the world.

956
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,956
William, ask yourself a question.

957
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:39,350
Who would spend this much money
saving mortally wounded soldiers?

958
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,909
My God, man, come on.

959
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,752
That's not how you win wars.

960
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,916
We're not a biomedical company.

961
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,435
My name isn't even Jones.

962
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:56,395
Now, you figured out how to transfer
human consciousness into a machine.

963
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,917
Imagine, the best pilot put into
a thousand individual drones,

964
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,357
the mind of a hacker
loaded into the virus.

965
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,990
Do you have any idea
how much that's worth?

966
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,675
Bill, isn't it exciting?

967
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,269
What about my family?

968
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,120
Your family died in a car accident, Bill.

969
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,713
The algorithm.
Get me the algorithm.

970
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,760
And then finish dinner.

971
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,274
Kiss the kids good night.

972
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:26,639
Hell, make love to your wife.

973
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,599
Have what you didn't have
the first time.

974
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,950
A chance to say... good-bye.

975
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,518
That's my gift to you.

976
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,072
I'll get the algorithm.

977
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,400
[phone chirps]

978
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,480
[cocks gun]

979
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,912
You see? Knew you were smart
enough to do the right thing.

980
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,673
[Jones groaning]

981
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,831
This is gonna piss me off, isn't it?

982
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,830
[Mona] William, you are scaring the kids.

983
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,752
- Where's Mr. Jones?
- [Matt] Mom, Dad.

984
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,440
Are you guys getting a divorce?

985
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,994
- [Mona] Maybe.
- [William] No.

986
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,434
Can you go to your rooms, please?

987
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,920
- [William] Where's the tin foil?
- In the top drawer by the dishwasher.

988
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,516
William, I need to know what's going on.

989
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,194
And who is Zoe?

990
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,234
Zoe is our daughter.

991
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:38,997
I couldn't bring you all back.
I couldn't save you all.

992
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,239
There weren't enough pods.

993
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,272
I deleted her from your memories.

994
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,836
You took the memory
of my child from me?

995
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,240
I'm sorry.

996
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,198
And I don't blame you
if you want to hate me

997
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:57,990
for the rest of my life,
but right now, we have to go.

998
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:04,037
Bionyne isn't a medical company.
I don't even know what they are.

999
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:10,317
But they're going to kill you and the kids
unless we go, right now.

1000
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:14,037
And I didn't defy
every natural law there is

1001
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,032
just to lose you again.

1002
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,350
We have to go.

1003
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,754
Kids, we're leaving!

1004
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,552
[cell phone ringing]

1005
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,113
[car starts]

1006
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,760
[tires screech]

1007
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,752
- [Mona screams]
- [car bangs curb]

1008
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,436
[Mona shrieks]

1009
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,432
[tires screech, engine revs]

1010
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,994
[groans]

1011
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,440
[Sophie] What is going on?

1012
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,798
[Mona] Matt, Sophie.

1013
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:36,672
There are some bad people
trying to hurt us.

1014
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,036
Just hold on and everything
will be all right.

1015
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,355
We'll go to Ed's boat,
get out of here.

1016
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,833
[zapping]

1017
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,233
[beep]

1018
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,076
[sizzling]

1019
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,039
I'm disappointed, Bill.

1020
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,315
Very disappointed.

1021
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,676
Sir, they're on the move.

1022
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,997
Don't shoot him in the head.

1023
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,920
- This is all your fault.
- I didn't do anything.

1024
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,160
[thud]

1025
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,476
- How did they find us?
- Don't you guys watch TV?

1026
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,680
- They tracked Sophie's phone.
- They didn't. Shut up.

1027
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:36,040
Shit, maybe it's in the car,
maybe it's the GPS.

1028
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,640
It's not the car, it's not the phones.

1029
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,836
Bionyne puts tracker markers
in all of the experimental animals.

1030
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,794
The trackers are in you.

1031
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:54,840
William!

1032
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,758
[screaming]

1033
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,359
- [horn blares]
- [tires screech]

1034
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,190
We're okay!
It's all right. We're all right.

1035
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,840
- You okay?
- [William] We're all right.

1036
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,559
[both gasping]

1037
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,240
How do we get the trackers out?

1038
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,919
They're in the pods and they
attach to the spine in utero.

1039
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,871
They're powered by
the central nervous system.

1040
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,189
They don't come out.

1041
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,715
- What are you talking about?
- Drive to the clinic.

1042
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,960
That's back the way we came.

1043
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,360
Drive to the clinic.

1044
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,030
Okay.

1045
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,670
- Sophie, I need you to lie down.
- What do you mean? Dad, why?

1046
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,319
It's okay. Get on the table.

1047
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:05,696
- It's all right.
- [Sophie] What?

1048
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,633
The trackers are powered by
the nervous system so this will fry them.

1049
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,359
Red, white, black.

1050
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,592
- Trackers? What are you saying?
- [William] It's okay, Sophie. It's okay.

1051
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,239
Mom, what's going on? I'm serious.

1052
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,536
Somebody put something bad in us,
and I'm trying to kill it.

1053
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:18,479
And I know you're afraid,

Keys are in the bait box.

1095

You said the keys were in the bait box.

We got the wife and kids.
What about Foster?

1108
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,040
He'll come to us.

1109
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,840
Good call, Eddie.
Here are your boat keys.

1110
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,400
You bastard.

1111
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:55,394
Mona, look, everything's gonna be fine
if William just cooperates.

1112
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,399
Fine? You idiot.
They're gonna kill us, Ed.

1113
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,914
- Mom.
- What are you talking about?

1114
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,720
I have snacks in my office.
Take the kids in there.

1115
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,836
Mom!

1116
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,320
Mom, come with us.

1117
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,236
[man] Foster's here.

1118
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,556
Yes, sir.

1119
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,035
[hangs up receiver]

1120
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,156
Look, Mona, we...

1121
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,191
We stole millions of dollars' worth
of Bionyne equipment to make you.

1122
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,953
- Make me?
- Yes, make you.

1123
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,838
To bring you back.
You died, remember?

1124
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,877
I was supposed to get rid
of the bodies.

1125
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,839
Your bodies. But I couldn't do it.

1126
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,877
And then Jones found out,
and, look...

1127
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,919
If we just play ball,
we can make it out of this.

1128
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,116
Get your hands off my wife!

1129
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,114
- Where are the kids, honey?
- They're okay. They're over there.

1130
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,351
William, man, I'm... I'm sorry.

1131
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,750
This wasn't supposed to happen.
This got way out of hand.

1132
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:00,117
It's all right, Ed. It's going to be okay.

1133
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,079
I destroyed the algorithm.

1134
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,310
I noticed that.

1135
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,632
The only place that algorithm
exists is in my head.

1136
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,999
You want it, we walk out of here.

1137
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,515
You never see us again.
Me and my family disappear.

1138
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:13,790
Bill, are you negotiating?

1139
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:17,910
You need me.

1140
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,875
[Jones] Maybe.

1141
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,837
- But I don't need her.
- Jones, wait!

Wait, no, I'll do it!
I'll do it, I'll do it!

1145
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:37,920
I'll give you the algorithm.

1146
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,435
I know.

1147
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,679
If you trust him, he'll kill us.

- It's all there?
- It's all there.

1154

Now, let my family go.

1155
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,594
Why are you stuck on that?

01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:02,549

I mean, you really don't get it?

Where is he going?
