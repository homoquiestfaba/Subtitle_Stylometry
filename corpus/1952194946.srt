1
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,763
Dad! A white hair.

2
00:03:17,508 --> 00:03:21,137
Look for more Alvaro,
five liras for each white hair.

3
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:22,445
That is, Dad.

4
00:03:23,058 --> 00:03:24,398
Alvaro!

5
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,005
Alvaro, come here!

6
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:36,211
Dad has all white hair.

7
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,725
<i>Your ticket please sir.</i>

8
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:45,534
Sir, your ticket, please.

9
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:58,321
Here you go. Bon voyage to all.

10
00:03:58,712 --> 00:03:59,861
- Thanks.
- Good Day

11
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:02,211
Tickets, please.

12
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:21,448
Hey, must be yours, let fall.

13
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:22,781
Me?

14
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:24,406
Thank you.

15
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:26,926
Fortunately, I only have this copy.

16
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:30,075
It's beautiful,
Do you work in the theater?

17
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:33,395
No, it's a family portrait.

18
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:38,968
Look, look, the middle one
is me with my wife.

19
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,000
Below are my babies.

20
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:43,282
Guglielmo.

21
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,438
Like that of Rossini.

22
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:47,422
Alvaro. "La forza del destino" by Verdi.

23
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,408
Norma, Bellini's like.

24
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:53,375
Tosca, by Puccini. There's even a tape.

25
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,332
And Cannie clown.

26
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:58,835
I got named after characters in opera.

27
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,252
Because I am a fanatic of lyrics.

28
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,595
That's why...

29
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:06,550
four years ago I was surprised...

30
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:09,899
...dressing well for the carnival.

31
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:12,786
Do not want to see it?

32
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:14,002
Look at it.

33
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,087
Well, I'd say they are no longer children.

34
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:22,159
You're right, but..

35
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:23,532
What do you want?

36
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:26,824
The children, of children,
they want... large.

37
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:31,930
Then when they grow up...
children were always seen.

38
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:38,212
I bet you also want to see.

39
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,065
Like it? Show it to the lady.

40
00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:48,133
- Bonita
- Already? Pásesela her boyfriend.

41
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,663
- Not my boyfriend.
- Never mind, give it.

42
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,520
- Large family
- If you increase...

43
00:05:59,996 --> 00:06:03,403
the wives, the sons and
friends, are an army.

44
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:05,913
A fragment of Italy.

45
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:10,554
Look, not only are they my children...

46
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:13,414
but believe me, are very good.

47
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:16,416
Yes they are. I do not know, have...

48
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,429
I know not what.

49
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,246
All good, with important jobs.

50
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,604
But the exceptional...

51
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:25,977
is that they have... hobbies in mind.

52
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,329
They grew up with sacrifice.

53
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:31,432
I confess something.

54
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:34,305
It is the first time
that I am going to see them.

55
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:38,511
In general, come to Sicily
once or twice a year, and...

56
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,673
Are uncomfortable?

57
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:53,692
You really do not want to know...

58
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:58,437
- ...how they work, how they live?
- Honestly... no thanks.

59
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:00,563
Whatever.

60
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:05,402
Do not know what is lost.

61
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:18,311
Excuse me, could do me a favor...

62
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:20,936
...to take me.

63
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:22,061
Thank you.

64
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:31,282
Thank you. You know, for my wife.

65
00:07:31,615 --> 00:07:33,544
I'm Sicilian, from Trapani.

66
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:36,030
Do not want to know where to go?

67
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:43,674
I am also Neapolitan!

68
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,938
So am!

69
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:48,345
I want one billion!

70
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:50,365
Billions!

71
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:53,391
Thieves, murderers, damn!

72
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:54,672
Damn!

73
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,671
All are thieves, murderers!

74
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:58,188
Yes!

75
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:01,036
Murderers damn!

76
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,590
I want one billion!

77
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,004
Thieves, murderers, damn!

78
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,036
Please bring me the money...

79
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,943
...I will make a killing throughout Europe!

80
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:14,057
With all of you all!

81
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:18,753
If I have for the night one billion...

82
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:23,502
...take away all these
television antennas, all!

83
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:29,567
He is armed, call the police.

84
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,338
Toy gun, and we got used.

85
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,621
Even the police know.

86
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:36,808
Filthy!

87
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:41,176
If for the night I don't have the money...

88
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,929
remove the TV antennas!

89
00:09:06,216 --> 00:09:07,228
Hello?

90
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:12,154
Alvaro, guess, who am I?

91
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:13,615
An idiot.

92
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:24,932
Scuro.

93
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:29,966
Excuse me, where can I...
can not hear me?

94
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:32,483
- In the microphone.
- What? This.

95
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,970
- Where...?
- In the microphone there.

96
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:37,110
- Here.
- Here?

97
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,642
- Excuse me, where can I find
Mr. Alvaro Scuro?

98
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:46,124
- Are here at the University of Naples.
- One moment

99
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,585
What name do I say?

100
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,609
Scuro, Alvaro Scuro.

101
00:10:56,979 --> 00:10:59,258
It's my son, and colleague also.

102
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:01,003
How is it that does not know?

103
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,334
Look...

104
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,070
is on vacation, or furlough...

105
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,271
or commissioner is ill...

106
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,415
or commissioner of union, or left...

107
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:25,895
or retired...

108
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:29,052
or may not have been to work.

109
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:31,301
What is certain is that he exists.

110
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:33,449
Thank goodness.

111
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:55,018
<i>Well? I'm answering machine
of Alvaro Scuro...</i>

112
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:57,308
<i>Not at home now.</i>

113
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:01,608
<i>Please leave your message,
name and phone number.</i>

114
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:05,064
<i>If I return, I'll call. </i>

115
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,092
<i>Please leave message after the beep.
Thanks.</i>

116
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:19,998
Well? I...

117
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:22,201
your...

118
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,653
The stupidity of the answering machine.

119
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:31,341
What do I do? I can not speak in a voice...

120
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,275
...as taken from the refrigerator.

121
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:37,375
I feel like... the world freezes.

122
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,744
They say that Naples is super crowded.

123
00:12:56,114 --> 00:12:58,145
Sure, neither are dogs.

124
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:04,830
You want company, Grandpa?

125
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:06,660
Look at his legs.

126
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:14,240
And look at mine.

127
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:34,207
<i>I look out of my mind...</i>

128
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,673
<i>I do not know what I mean...</i>

129
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:42,236
<i>or what I do.</i>

130
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:46,736
<i>And even without hope, get up...</i>

131
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:53,948
<i>and be a man forever.</i>

132
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:00,034
Well...

133
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:36,955
Alvaro, I...

134
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:39,829
I wanted to surprise you.

135
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:42,427
Where have you been?

136
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:48,049
Are you planning to sleep outside?

137
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:52,804
I always liked you women.

138
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,737
No?

139
00:14:57,788 --> 00:15:00,736
Blow your nose, look no more.

140
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:02,767
Always with his nose dirty.

141
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:05,924
The same nose as always.
Let's see.

142
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:08,604
Yes, laugh.
Strong.

143
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:16,759
Are you tired, Dad?

144
00:15:17,145 --> 00:15:19,475
- A little
- Sorry.

145
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:22,019
Where you going now?

146
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,077
Listen... sorry...

147
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:44,861
the... the twelve...

148
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:46,985
- Is it the same?
- How?

149
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:50,345
I say that if you follow to room twelve.

150
00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:52,687
Where would that be?
Here it is.

151
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,914
Here you go.

152
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:58,518
You never know.

153
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:03,704
Ask me why I asked for room twelve.

154
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:06,703
- You do not want me...
- Ask, without penalty.

155
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,425
Well, why room twelve?

156
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:13,737
Very easy. When I married 45 years ago...

157
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:16,367
and I came to Naples for honeymoon.

158
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,472
We slept in this hotel...

159
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:21,541
in the room number twelve.

160
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,660
- Want to know what I paid?
- Actually, I...

161
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,746
- Ask.
- Well, how much?

162
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,082
- Seventy-two lire.
- Nothing.

163
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:35,334
Today would equal about...

164
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:39,771
- ...twenty thousand lire.
- It is sixty.

165
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:42,200
- Sixty what?
- Sixty thousand.

166
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:06,696
Everything has changed.

167
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:09,181
But it's the same furniture.

168
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,687
Remember our first night?

169
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:19,086
You wanted to sleep dressed.

170
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:21,714
And I, out of respect...

171
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,324
...slept with a hat.

172
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:52,262
How far have we come?

173
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:56,089
Well, I speak English perfectly.

174
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:58,784
Do you think about and talk
neapolitan english? Really?

175
00:18:06,578 --> 00:18:08,076
Look, Belisario.

176
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:10,551
<i>Good morning, baby!</i>

177
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:19,054
Big deal.

178
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:29,682
How was it?
sure did here.

179
00:18:30,997 --> 00:18:31,892
How on earth did it?

180
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:34,347
Just look at that antenna.

181
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:35,852
Why was included?

182
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,943
<i>Attention, leave a message
after the beep. Thanks.</i>

183
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:48,788
Well, well.

184
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:49,957
See if you record.

185
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:54,719
Alvaro, It's Dad.
I came to Naples, but...

186
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:56,160
didn't find you.

187
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,415
Where are you?
Are you okay?

188
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:02,371
I... I... I...

189
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:06,131
well, you'd expect, but...

190
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,538
If for some reason you're late...

191
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,914
or you have other commitments...

192
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,274
what?

193
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,637
Reportata, never call.

194
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:17,126
Alvaro, look...

195
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,624
better go with your brother Cannie.

196
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:22,938
But do not call before he arrives.

197
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:25,950
I have to give the surprise, see?

198
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:29,889
Are you listening?
I have to board the train.

199
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,469
Goodbye.

200
00:19:33,402 --> 00:19:35,393
It's me, Dad.

201
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,175
Please answer me this.

202
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:03,950
Why 74 years a pensioner...

203
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,282
be hitchhiking on the freeway?

204
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:08,755
- On the train strike.
- It was.

205
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,204
But...

206
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:12,831
was too impulsive.

207
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:15,794
Just had to ask.

208
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:17,867
I was going to respond.

209
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,122
- Is Siciliano?
- Yes.

210
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:24,017
- How did you know?
- Because you hear strange.

211
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:29,955
Hey, What kind of work
does his son in Rome?

212
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:33,754
To see if it is so good and wise woman.

213
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,389
Look, just tell him one thing, listen.

214
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,532
The day he was born in 1947...

215
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:42,675
that day, I said,
local elections were held.

216
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:47,298
And his mother still sore as
he walked to the polls.

217
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:50,642
He was alone, I was a teller.

218
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:54,113
You follow? Then, back home...

219
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:56,643
half hour later, Cannie was born.

220
00:20:58,142 --> 00:21:02,800
Let's see, someone born in
such circumstances, tell me...

221
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:05,082
what trade matters?

222
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:07,385
GYN.

223
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:12,734
Sorry, expression, but...

224
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:15,146
and who urinated out of place.

225
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:17,040
Neither more nor less.

226
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:10,470
Hey, Where are you going?

227
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:17,140
Identify.

228
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,889
- Siciliano?
- Yes

229
00:22:32,744 --> 00:22:33,625
Grandpa!

230
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:36,553
- Grandpa!
- Erina!

231
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:42,362
They are the guardian angels
of the judge Brandi.

232
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,446
Have not you seen in television?

233
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:46,299
Oh yeah? Does he live here?

234
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,299
Yeah, takes one week with fever.

235
00:22:49,516 --> 00:22:53,118
But they are my friends, do no harm.

236
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,862
Thank goodness. I brought very nice gift.

237
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:59,926
We open at night.
Are you alone?

238
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,165
Mom and dad was working the party.

239
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:06,677
Thank... all those...

240
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:09,257
that their participation...

241
00:23:10,191 --> 00:23:13,195
have enriched the work...
our convention...

242
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:17,080
offering reflections...

243
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:19,647
comments...

244
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,366
and new proposals...

245
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:24,450
of great political value.

246
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,574
They will be brief...

247
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,069
although the circumstances require.

248
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:35,520
Why should we be brief?

249
00:23:36,636 --> 00:23:38,021
The time we live...

250
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,170
is a slave to speed...

251
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:42,332
anxiety, is it fair?

252
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:47,243
Perhaps it was,
especially for our party...

253
00:23:47,921 --> 00:23:51,334
a time to acknowledge
the issue of community...

254
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:54,436
the sense of "potilas".

255
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,016
Excuse me, is a policy.

256
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,982
A fair policy.

257
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:06,649
Modern.

258
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:10,024
To take into account social needs...

259
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:19,087
A fair policy.

260
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:20,964
Modern.

261
00:24:21,356 --> 00:24:24,107
To take into account social needs...

262
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:28,276
and disturbing questions...

263
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,758
the years... ninety...

264
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:32,464
we face.

265
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:03,237
- Cannie!
- Dad!

266
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,654
Dad, look who came!

267
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,644
Hi, Dad! When did you get here?

268
00:25:15,876 --> 00:25:17,216
When did you get here?

269
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:21,529
What are you standing
there like a post? Low.

270
00:25:22,408 --> 00:25:23,375
Downloaded.

271
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:40,296
But how many columns, seems San Pedro.

272
00:25:41,034 --> 00:25:43,140
Too bad you can't take pictures.

273
00:25:43,513 --> 00:25:46,046
It's huge, how many people it holds?

274
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,951
You know how many Muslims are here?

275
00:25:49,224 --> 00:25:50,810
- More than 50 thousand.
- Castelvetrano...

276
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:53,486
has 25 thousand inhabitants.

277
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:05,329
- And did it all yourself?
- I wish.

278
00:26:05,654 --> 00:26:07,611
Just take care of heating.

279
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:09,810
- What modest.
- No, man.

280
00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:11,974
And where are they seen when they pray?

281
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:15,113
From there.

282
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:37,958
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

283
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:48,282
Well, tell me something,
there in the Congress...

284
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:51,707
- ...Will you be secretary of the party?
- What do I say?

285
00:26:52,222 --> 00:26:53,754
No party secretary...

286
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:58,188
but the Provincial Federation party.

287
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:00,500
Well, what's the difference?

288
00:27:00,717 --> 00:27:01,969
At the end of the secretary.

289
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:03,653
Talk about something else.

290
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:06,063
Finally meets the house.

291
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:09,266
- Is not it pretty?
- Yes, very pretty.

292
00:27:09,846 --> 00:27:13,140
And when will you decide to join us?

293
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:17,062
- We'd be happy.
- Come on, Grandpa, come.

294
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:20,918
A thousand thanks, but it's impossible.

295
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:23,428
"At our age...

296
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:27,239
how could mom and I change their lives?

297
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,382
No, you can not, no.

298
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:32,147
What is he saying?

299
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,086
Stay here all you want.

300
00:27:36,582 --> 00:27:39,555
- But others visit
- Yes, but do not tell.

301
00:27:40,317 --> 00:27:42,242
Well... I want to surprise them.

302
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:44,775
Please.

303
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,615
By the way Alvaro know what?

304
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:50,588
Where is he? I went to his house
and was not there.

305
00:27:51,226 --> 00:27:54,085
- He has answering machine
- Vacation, did not you know?

306
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:57,245
- Won a free trip.
- A trip?

307
00:27:58,202 --> 00:28:02,149
- What if I expect?
- It was a... wait a minute.

308
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:06,619
Why they do not off-hook
it to eat? A trip.

309
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:09,371
What luck for Alvaro, always wins.

310
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,058
"We opened the gift, grandfather?

311
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,524
<i>not worry about that.</i>

312
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:18,212
<i>Do you not have faith Congress</i>

313
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:20,059
<i>Look, all support you.</i>

314
00:28:20,622 --> 00:28:21,558
Not that.

315
00:28:22,122 --> 00:28:24,237
Better tell me what happened
with my interview.

316
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:25,997
I spent a month.

317
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,140
<i>Nothing happened. Do not be published.</i>

318
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:31,997
<i>- I say no more.
- How can we publish?</i>

319
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,091
Did he kill someone?

320
00:28:34,637 --> 00:28:36,201
<i>depends on who mates.</i>

321
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,243
Nothing, grandfather Matteo.

322
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:43,775
Why not?
Let's see, looking good.

323
00:28:44,363 --> 00:28:45,377
You'll see.

324
00:28:52,737 --> 00:28:53,969
Broke.

325
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,755
What a pity!

326
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:01,138
They were rare candy.
You know? You do not know.

327
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:03,875
Your dad ate in droves.

328
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:06,312
So I was always at the dentist.

329
00:29:06,935 --> 00:29:07,874
I'm so sorry.

330
00:29:09,365 --> 00:29:12,503
If you know them, are slaves of sugar.

331
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:16,937
Dad bought sicilian cakes, look at them.

332
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:20,563
Have you seen them?

333
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,097
- Hello?
- "Tosca, are you?

334
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,891
- Who is this?
- I'm Cannie.

335
00:29:36,926 --> 00:29:38,408
- Hello, Cannie.
- How are you?

336
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,281
Look... is beautiful, beautiful.

337
00:29:44,594 --> 00:29:45,741
A work of art.

338
00:29:47,022 --> 00:29:49,586
Although television is... larger.

339
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:51,495
And more natural, yes.

340
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,343
I'm going, Dad, I can not wait.

341
00:29:53,755 --> 00:29:57,252
If. Cannie, before death I see you.

342
00:29:57,514 --> 00:29:59,988
At the... the...
the Chamber of Deputies.

343
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:03,599
Okay, bye. if you get lost
then call or call a taxi.

344
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:06,470
Ah, Cannie wait. Listen.

345
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:12,330
And if we met like before but here in Rome?

346
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:15,315
It would be nice.
We will have to ask others.

347
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,799
Agreed. Now go, then we are.

348
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:21,180
Go away from here I see.

349
00:30:30,347 --> 00:30:31,582
Cannie!

350
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:33,568
Do not move!

351
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:37,036
You can go now.

352
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,633
- Hello.
- Good morning, Deputy.

353
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,191
This is the meeting today.

354
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:00,403
- This for the convention.
- Is it long?

355
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:05,479
38 min. 21 sec., Of which you
can skip 4 minutes and a half...

356
00:31:06,053 --> 00:31:09,368
- ...if desired.
- Thanks, anything else?

357
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,781
Yes, I wanted to ask her opinion of me.

358
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:58,607
- Hey, why kill them?
- Not us.

359
00:31:58,954 --> 00:32:00,405
It has happened many times.

360
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,658
Also in the morning there.

361
00:32:03,374 --> 00:32:06,376
They, when they are around the city...

362
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:08,833
lose their orientation.

363
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,002
They get mad.

364
00:32:11,993 --> 00:32:13,115
They kill.

365
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:15,992
Leaping from minced... and kill.

366
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,471
These are going to save, you'll see.

367
00:32:37,598 --> 00:32:39,931
<i>The wine is made from grapes.</i>

368
00:32:46,743 --> 00:32:48,525
Someone will hurt you.
Someone will make...

369
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:32,628
Give me everything.

370
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:37,984
- How old are you?
- Less than you. The money.

371
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:47,861
If.

372
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:52,081
I'll give everything, but do not hurt me.

373
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,002
Okay, and in his pocket?

374
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:55,549
How old are you?

375
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:57,427
What do you care?
No bother.

376
00:33:57,723 --> 00:33:59,385
No, the camera does.
Please.

377
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:04,882
Okay,
But give me the scroll.

378
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,760
Do not you want to know why?

379
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:08,432
I already had enough.

380
00:34:11,948 --> 00:34:14,054
What if I'm not a fucking useless scroll.

381
00:35:07,464 --> 00:35:09,566
If it were in the United States
they would decorate to me

382
00:35:09,911 --> 00:35:11,692
Here, I briefly go to jail.

383
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:14,660
Do I face female robber?

384
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:16,910
I don't know.

385
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:24,590
Tosca!

386
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:33,864
Tosca!

387
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,060
Dad!

388
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:43,104
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

389
00:35:43,694 --> 00:35:45,415
In there are crazy.

390
00:35:45,688 --> 00:35:46,697
Goodbye, good luck.

391
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:48,852
- Goodbye!
- Bye, bye!

392
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,413
Bye.

393
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:07,167
- Yes, Mr.
- "Messenger Republica Press..."

394
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:11,543
<i>...Unit, Time, People,
Morning, Manifiesto, Newspapers.</i>

395
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,113
Stay with inserts.

396
00:36:16,104 --> 00:36:18,158
Do not write if I never wrote one?

397
00:36:19,198 --> 00:36:22,861
Call us, not much at least once a week.

398
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:26,428
- I never know where you are.
- Where to find you

399
00:36:27,364 --> 00:36:29,738
What do you do... I see... you mock me?

400
00:36:30,115 --> 00:36:33,035
Perhaps you have car
and you make much money...

401
00:36:33,272 --> 00:36:34,879
but I'm your father.

402
00:36:35,387 --> 00:36:38,358
A journey, for some Japanese
advertising and two parades.

403
00:36:39,273 --> 00:36:42,524
Will you go to Sicily?
I have no accent.

404
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,327
- Lucky
- Why?

405
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:49,023
I will work in Pescara,
went home, but here I am.

406
00:36:49,058 --> 00:36:52,364
Where? The last time
you lived in Padua.

407
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:54,964
No, I live in Florence.
You'll see.

408
00:36:56,574 --> 00:36:59,359
Hey where did Alvaro travel?

409
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,638
- When returning?
- It does not take.

410
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:04,116
- Thank God
- He went to the Falklands.

411
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:09,527
- He gave the University.
- Insurance is the best.

412
00:37:10,182 --> 00:37:11,902
One night I went to the theater.

413
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:14,205
- He gave me a penalty.
- Why?

414
00:37:14,414 --> 00:37:17,040
For my part was very small...

415
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:18,995
but when he came on stage...

416
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:21,715
began to applaud shouting: "Bravo!"

417
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:24,392
She tugged at the public.
You see how it is.

418
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:28,642
Then came the star and no one clapped.

419
00:37:30,884 --> 00:37:34,839
- Therefore.
- When will theaters feature you...

420
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:38,779
- How do you know?
- For the newspaper and Cannie.

421
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:41,144
An article thus, congratulations.

422
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:42,963
Thank you.

423
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:46,156
Nothing else was missing this.

424
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:50,018
What was it that happened?

425
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,903
Do not know.

426
00:37:53,498 --> 00:37:56,030
Still exists the cherry tree
that I planted at home?

427
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:01,269
Sure. Is very tall.

428
00:38:01,952 --> 00:38:04,187
This year it gave many cherries.

429
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,968
Sweet as...

430
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:08,812
like cherries.

431
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:14,560
So it should be.
You cry easily.

432
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,843
Come, let's see what happened.

433
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:18,689
How this one is removed?

434
00:38:19,687 --> 00:38:21,159
Looks like a lot.

435
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:23,366
We will not ever leave.

436
00:38:25,408 --> 00:38:27,494
Well? You hear me, Irene?
Where am I?

437
00:38:28,626 --> 00:38:29,846
Locked on the highway.

438
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:27,433
Here we are.

439
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,918
- Come in, come.
- Yes

440
00:39:31,055 --> 00:39:32,745
It smells of confinement
because I have not come in days.

441
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:35,371
It's beautiful.

442
00:39:36,246 --> 00:39:37,354
A little messy.

443
00:39:40,641 --> 00:39:42,987
So that you don't say
that I have no home.

444
00:39:43,282 --> 00:39:44,729
It's very big.

445
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:47,395
Well this is my house.

446
00:39:47,798 --> 00:39:51,435
- It's...
- Rented ehe?

447
00:39:57,468 --> 00:39:59,163
Dad... you seem like seller.

448
00:39:59,198 --> 00:40:00,858
Do not loose your bag.

449
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:02,950
Come on, give it me.

450
00:40:03,202 --> 00:40:05,700
Well, I worked in exports.

451
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:08,251
And don't think I did wrong.

452
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:11,779
I was exporter of children wholesale.

453
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:13,909
Wholesale?

454
00:40:14,198 --> 00:40:15,889
- Only we are five.
- How?

455
00:40:15,924 --> 00:40:19,998
What about the 19,882 registered
birth certificates?

456
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:23,509
Where is it?
Everyone's out of town.

457
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:30,260
I doubt they know that, at least
on paper, I made them be born.

458
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:32,818
An army of children.

459
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:37,069
It invited if them to eat
I don't know where to fit them.

460
00:40:39,756 --> 00:40:42,496
- What is church?
- Santa Cruz.

461
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:44,635
It has a world of tiles.

462
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,603
As in Castelvetrano.

463
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:50,211
It's beautiful, like a movie screen.

464
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:54,335
You can sleep in that bed
or would you like mine?

465
00:40:54,649 --> 00:40:59,038
- Whatever.
I should not pick it...

466
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:01,092
and decide my arthritis.

467
00:41:01,368 --> 00:41:03,922
You'd better book for when you leave.

468
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:07,015
Otherwise, you may not
find there is room.

469
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:09,226
Do not worry.

470
00:41:10,258 --> 00:41:12,899
- Ask me what I decided.
- What you decided?

471
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:17,236
Stay up for your presentation, you happy?

472
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,612
Thrilled.

473
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,671
Guglielmo!

474
00:42:42,934 --> 00:42:44,483
Tosca, Alvaro.

475
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:45,970
Look.

476
00:43:21,256 --> 00:43:23,988
<i>Liar, you're a liar</i>

477
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:27,525
<i>I'll get out of here.</i>

478
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:34,535
<i>Leave this house!</i>

479
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,457
<i>Pray hear me. Trust me.</i>

480
00:43:36,896 --> 00:43:40,866
<i>If you do not hurt me I
would have gone with my stuff.</i>

481
00:43:47,555 --> 00:43:49,545
<i>This time I was the payer, Fabio.</i>

482
00:43:49,897 --> 00:43:50,898
<i>Unhappy.</i>

483
00:43:52,085 --> 00:43:53,511
Tosca!

484
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,479
<i>Dad, I didn't wake before you were
leaving. The boy is my friend.</i>

485
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,204
<i>It will happen later for him.</i>

486
00:44:28,513 --> 00:44:31,046
<i>I hope, if he cries, give him bottle.</i>

487
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:34,153
<i>Your breakfast is on the table.</i>

488
00:44:34,188 --> 00:44:36,857
<i>I have audition in the theater.
A kiss. Tosca.</i>

489
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:46,094
Nene, little baby.

490
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:54,121
How pretty.

491
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:14,811
Sorry.

492
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,437
Before the children cried
as if I was killing them.

493
00:45:23,743 --> 00:45:25,180
This makes no noise.

494
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,001
That's fine, one more.

495
00:45:28,608 --> 00:45:31,063
Okay, turn around more slowly.

496
00:45:31,376 --> 00:45:32,642
No, hands up.

497
00:45:33,054 --> 00:45:34,316
One more, okay.

498
00:45:34,536 --> 00:45:36,597
Okay, so... no, not like that.

499
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:40,535
Faces do not interest me,
what I want is the rear.

500
00:45:41,499 --> 00:45:42,898
Thus it is, fine.

501
00:45:43,629 --> 00:45:45,128
The chin raises.

502
00:45:45,501 --> 00:45:47,138
The sunken belly.

503
00:45:47,173 --> 00:45:49,363
Instead, changes twice.
Fast.

504
00:45:50,535 --> 00:45:51,975
Come forward.

505
00:45:52,346 --> 00:45:54,471
That's fine, but hides the tummy.

506
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,319
That sums the belly.

507
00:46:23,749 --> 00:46:24,857
Stefano, How are you doing here?

508
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:27,373
How are you?

509
00:46:27,938 --> 00:46:29,547
Evil, but no matter.

510
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,013
I do not know how to say, Tosca.

511
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:34,691
Do not misunderstand me.

512
00:46:35,722 --> 00:46:37,108
In the course of the week...

513
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:40,230
I want my car... and also the house.

514
00:46:41,856 --> 00:46:44,745
It's better for me, and for you.

515
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,235
Handsome babies, they are ready?

516
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:57,046
In study 2 they look for actress...

517
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:59,788
for a film in America. "Dollars".

518
00:47:00,005 --> 00:47:02,124
How not to see who you believe.

519
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:03,753
- Go see.
- It will be another porno.

520
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,424
It is an American film.
Go see.

521
00:47:06,662 --> 00:47:08,898
It is there, even for you.

522
00:47:18,257 --> 00:47:19,841
Do you want?

523
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:21,819
- Aren't you?
- Not interested.

524
00:47:24,772 --> 00:47:26,412
Need anything?

525
00:47:34,776 --> 00:47:37,045
What's wrong?
What ails you, boy?

526
00:47:38,433 --> 00:47:39,777
Why are you crying?

527
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:42,233
I saw why.

528
00:47:44,218 --> 00:47:46,090
You missed the soap opera.

529
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:47,963
I will fix it for you,
and the button?

530
00:47:50,183 --> 00:47:52,015
Aparécete image!

531
00:47:54,326 --> 00:47:55,262
Let's see.

532
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,938
Take the bottle.
Hold her.

533
00:47:58,747 --> 00:47:59,622
Milk.

534
00:48:00,061 --> 00:48:01,594
Milk is very rich.

535
00:48:29,537 --> 00:48:31,094
Invent another television.

536
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:43,274
Good day, sir Scuro.

537
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:46,338
I'm a friend of Tosca.
I came for the child.

538
00:48:46,805 --> 00:48:48,140
Okay, come, come.

539
00:49:23,256 --> 00:49:24,496
Excuse me, please...

540
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:28,419
ask who is the orange and yellow.

541
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,916
- Who is?
- My daughter.

542
00:49:38,502 --> 00:49:40,858
- Like.
- Thanks.

543
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,029
The one connects in the same plane.

544
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:03,873
Again that fool waving.

545
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:06,846
Bravo.

546
00:51:11,822 --> 00:51:13,070
Bravo!

547
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:16,616
Way to go!

548
00:52:02,021 --> 00:52:05,961
I'm proud of you.
You succeed, you're happy.

549
00:52:06,285 --> 00:52:09,214
Okay. All you need is a good husband.

550
00:52:09,729 --> 00:52:11,444
Really?

551
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:18,962
- See you in Rome right?
- Do not worry.

552
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,480
Oh, I forgot.

553
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,748
Do not tell Guglielmo who will visit.

554
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:25,712
- It will surprise.
- Agreed.

555
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:28,026
Need money?

556
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:29,794
Money.

557
00:52:49,393 --> 00:52:51,120
Gentlemen, your tickets, please.

558
00:52:53,028 --> 00:52:55,019
Oh, is not the ticket.

559
00:52:55,434 --> 00:52:56,779
- What?
- Sorry.

560
00:52:58,645 --> 00:52:59,682
I did not realize.

561
00:53:28,326 --> 00:53:29,331
That's it.

562
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:34,552
It was not same, but it works.

563
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:37,927
Don't know how to thank him.

564
00:53:39,193 --> 00:53:41,482
It was perfect, not even noticed.

565
00:53:41,517 --> 00:53:43,596
- She is an artist.
- It was worth it.

566
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:47,144
- Yes
- How does it work?

567
00:53:48,283 --> 00:53:50,583
No, no, it is a family photo.

568
00:53:51,346 --> 00:53:53,802
Look, this is me, and
these are my children.

569
00:53:54,586 --> 00:53:57,157
Guglielmo, Alvaro, Norma, Tosca, Cannie.

570
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:00,573
Their names are as opera...

571
00:54:01,688 --> 00:54:03,940
I was always a fan... of lyrics.

572
00:54:04,192 --> 00:54:06,622
- Like me.
- Do you see it?

573
00:54:06,824 --> 00:54:09,100
- Yes, thanks.
- Pass it to others.

574
00:54:09,585 --> 00:54:10,638
That color.

575
00:54:12,446 --> 00:54:13,662
Are your family?

576
00:54:13,973 --> 00:54:17,786
No, not exactly.
We traveled together as retirees.

577
00:54:18,911 --> 00:54:20,352
Also I'm retired.

578
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:22,976
- Really?
- And also travel by train.

579
00:54:24,225 --> 00:54:26,195
I travel to Italy to see my children.

580
00:54:26,446 --> 00:54:28,692
I'm going to Milan.
I want to see how they are.

581
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:33,162
Wouldn't you know where are we going?

582
00:54:34,022 --> 00:54:35,960
Sir, I congratulate you.

583
00:54:35,995 --> 00:54:37,899
- Thanks
- No?

584
00:54:39,288 --> 00:54:41,138
Not to be impertinent.

585
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,140
Please ask me.

586
00:54:45,651 --> 00:54:47,320
Go ahead, ask me.

587
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:51,181
"Where are you?

588
00:54:52,196 --> 00:54:56,150
HAPPY HOLIDAYS

589
00:55:21,169 --> 00:55:24,060
Do not disclose, but Italy is beautiful.

590
00:55:24,782 --> 00:55:26,285
That's right. We have evidence.

591
00:55:27,752 --> 00:55:30,136
Excuse me ma'am. "They travel often?

592
00:55:30,777 --> 00:55:31,855
Twice a year.

593
00:55:32,857 --> 00:55:35,378
The other time was to Fiuggi baths...

594
00:55:36,293 --> 00:55:38,764
- ...And the Satrunia in Tuscany.
- Good.

595
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,317
<i>Welcome to Rimini.</i>

596
00:55:42,579 --> 00:55:47,267
<i>We thank the Association of
Retired Persons to come here.</i>

597
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:50,829
<i>Rimini beach hosts...</i>

598
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:53,234
<i>most global destination
of vacationers.</i>

599
00:55:53,643 --> 00:55:56,091
<i>We have very modern facilities.</i>

600
00:55:57,048 --> 00:56:01,914
<i>A lifeguard every 10 meters
tends to the swimmers.</i>

601
00:56:01,949 --> 00:56:06,781
<i>Of losing a child.
We offer its quick appearance.</i>

602
00:56:07,234 --> 00:56:11,234
Well. In Sicily they find never them.

603
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:13,048
And looks for who is lost.

604
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:18,037
<i>Now I leave the magic of a
place that will make them dream.</i>

605
00:56:19,021 --> 00:56:20,518
Thanks!

606
00:57:48,755 --> 00:57:52,754
Perfect. Now a polka
for the more daring.

607
00:57:54,514 --> 00:57:55,481
A polka.

608
00:57:55,757 --> 00:57:58,172
Madam, ask me what I'm thinking.

609
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:01,501
- What do you think?
- If you dare to dance.

610
00:58:01,536 --> 00:58:04,452
- Do you think I can?
- No, please.

611
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,503
What's wrong? Are you tired?

612
00:59:18,048 --> 00:59:19,314
No.

613
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:29,660
Doesn't it feel good?

614
00:59:37,776 --> 00:59:39,549
You'd better sit down.

615
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:01,447
- Do you feel better?
- Yes

616
01:00:01,777 --> 01:00:05,308
- You want something?
- No.

617
01:00:11,352 --> 01:00:13,824
Many years ago since dancing...

618
01:00:16,276 --> 01:00:18,761
Sure... with an ex-soldier...

619
01:00:20,118 --> 01:00:21,165
Excuse me.

620
01:00:23,507 --> 01:00:26,873
It's ugly and feels bad here
alone and away from home.

621
01:00:31,374 --> 01:00:33,407
You... Do not have children?

622
01:00:33,686 --> 01:00:35,722
Yeah.
I have two.

623
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:40,992
But do you know?
There comes an age that...

624
01:00:41,215 --> 01:00:42,839
the children go away.

625
01:00:44,198 --> 01:00:46,157
They need to get away.

626
01:00:47,292 --> 01:00:48,966
And they are right because...

627
01:00:50,461 --> 01:00:52,433
I must admit...
We are bored.

628
01:00:54,949 --> 01:00:55,904
Well...

629
01:00:55,939 --> 01:00:59,720
My sons agreed to send me to an asylum.

630
01:00:59,755 --> 01:01:01,467
Very nice, indeed.

631
01:01:02,106 --> 01:01:05,628
A former convent in the middle
of Olives. I'm fine.

632
01:01:09,189 --> 01:01:12,637
But... I never visit.

633
01:01:13,314 --> 01:01:15,515
Telephone.

634
01:01:16,818 --> 01:01:20,105
The other day, Julio
didn't recognize my voice.

635
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:24,437
- I hung up
- Why don't you say?

636
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:29,264
Sometimes there is interference
on the line, they often do.

637
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:31,986
Look, Matteo...

638
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,483
sometimes...

639
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:39,095
is much easier to pretend
it's not understood.

640
01:01:39,301 --> 01:01:41,592
Doesn't bring clarification.

641
01:01:42,844 --> 01:01:44,810
It can be fun.

642
01:01:46,628 --> 01:01:49,440
Please, can you expect anything.

643
01:01:49,475 --> 01:01:52,002
Even the rejection of children.

644
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:20,211
Lady... I ask because I am sad.

645
01:02:20,498 --> 01:02:23,290
I won't because I am also.

646
01:02:23,592 --> 01:02:25,887
Think, don't continue with their journey.

647
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,500
Forget it.

648
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:30,428
No, I can.

649
01:02:30,463 --> 01:02:33,475
And to be honest...
I do not.

650
01:02:33,763 --> 01:02:36,854
I promised my wife to wait in Sicily.

651
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:42,374
In addition, look,
we are very close to our children.

652
01:02:42,409 --> 01:02:44,743
We never parted.

653
01:02:45,203 --> 01:02:48,874
- Although this was wonderful.
- I believe so.

654
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:52,259
Ma'am, I...

655
01:02:52,533 --> 01:02:57,150
never kissed another woman's hand,
may I have yours.

656
01:03:10,729 --> 01:03:12,292
<i>That icy little hand.</i>

657
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:16,089
You are very noble,
I won't forget.

658
01:03:34,818 --> 01:03:37,872
Relax, I'm not betraying you.

659
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,487
Hey, excuse me...

660
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:38,453
I have three children.

661
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:40,683
Congratulations.

662
01:04:40,718 --> 01:04:43,965
I have five ... and...

663
01:04:49,129 --> 01:04:52,441
Hey. Listen, Mister... you...

664
01:04:52,667 --> 01:04:54,632
Well... I think...

665
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:56,902
- Did you want donations?
- Go to hell.

666
01:05:56,505 --> 01:05:58,240
What is he doing?

667
01:05:58,275 --> 01:06:01,308
Always back like the wind instruments.

668
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:03,900
Again. In line 32

669
01:07:13,424 --> 01:07:15,217
Dad! What are you doing here?

670
01:07:15,252 --> 01:07:16,519
Are not you glad?

671
01:07:16,769 --> 01:07:18,927
- What do you think?
- Well, I say.

672
01:07:20,435 --> 01:07:22,493
Guglielmo, do not you play?

673
01:07:23,092 --> 01:07:26,435
Papa, the bass drum is
not like the violins.

674
01:07:26,778 --> 01:07:28,220
It's played occasionally.

675
01:07:28,769 --> 01:07:31,371
Yes, but when the time arrives ...

676
01:07:32,295 --> 01:07:34,147
I told you we were coming.

677
01:07:34,902 --> 01:07:36,844
What now?

678
01:07:38,999 --> 01:07:42,395
Completing the test, then to the airport.

679
01:07:42,873 --> 01:07:45,419
I'm going to London.

680
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,124
To work.

681
01:07:49,935 --> 01:07:52,672
- Well...
- Wait, then.

682
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:23,118
It had not failed in 10 years.

683
01:08:23,153 --> 01:08:25,407
And he just happens when you come.

684
01:08:26,787 --> 01:08:28,473
What?
What about that look?

685
01:08:29,031 --> 01:08:30,222
Do you feel that I leave?

686
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:35,683
For the family Scuro,
meeting is a luxury.

687
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,409
But that's not why.

688
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:41,627
I just do not like your laugh.
Before it was not.

689
01:08:41,846 --> 01:08:43,673
I laugh same as before.

690
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:46,932
- Come, walk.
- I know, Guglielmo.

691
01:08:47,215 --> 01:08:49,726
You're not going.

692
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:53,035
You're seeing the face, I know.

693
01:08:54,114 --> 01:08:55,926
How do you think, Dad?

694
01:08:56,255 --> 01:08:58,991
I give concerts in Europe.

695
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:01,493
Furthermore, why lie?

696
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,451
That's what I want you to tell me.

697
01:09:05,491 --> 01:09:06,992
While I know.

698
01:09:14,888 --> 01:09:16,699
What do you know?
What do you know?

699
01:09:17,607 --> 01:09:18,774
Nothing.

700
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:22,070
But I assure you're
not telling me something.

701
01:09:22,484 --> 01:09:24,243
You can see in his face.

702
01:09:29,301 --> 01:09:31,741
It's true. I hid something.

703
01:09:33,691 --> 01:09:35,628
I knew you were coming to Milan.

704
01:09:37,117 --> 01:09:38,020
Yes

705
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:40,524
- Tosca called me.
- Oh, really?

706
01:09:41,505 --> 01:09:43,494
I asked him not to tell you.

707
01:09:44,053 --> 01:09:45,606
It had to be a surprise.

708
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:48,986
But I expected you three days ago.

709
01:09:49,021 --> 01:09:52,602
- Me?
- What are you hiding?

710
01:09:53,477 --> 01:09:54,749
Not hiding anything.

711
01:09:55,273 --> 01:09:56,593
What could be?

712
01:09:56,628 --> 01:09:57,913
Where'd you go?

713
01:09:58,148 --> 01:10:00,392
Me?
Where?

714
01:10:00,427 --> 01:10:02,373
Where do you think would go?

715
01:10:02,408 --> 01:10:04,320
- Where'd you go?
- What the...?

716
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,509
I do not know why...

717
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:10,300
See, that if you laugh.
That really pleases me.

718
01:10:10,335 --> 01:10:13,499
- Yes, cámbiamela.
- Don't want to change anything.

719
01:10:13,718 --> 01:10:16,651
But child what did you expect?

720
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:21,814
Look, look...
- Gentlemen, I do not want to intrude...

721
01:10:21,849 --> 01:10:24,699
...but invite me to laugh or let me work.

722
01:10:25,853 --> 01:10:27,793
- They're going to ruin.
- Sorry.

723
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:31,221
"Excuse me." So easy.

724
01:10:52,709 --> 01:10:54,529
<i>Hello, Antonello, I'm your dad.</i>

725
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:57,291
<i>I feel clear of
your favorite music.</i>

726
01:10:57,507 --> 01:11:00,147
<i>But I wanted you
to hear my message.</i>

727
01:11:00,512 --> 01:11:02,322
<i>I'll buy the cassette.</i>

728
01:11:02,584 --> 01:11:04,947
<i>I go away and
mother comes with me...</i>

729
01:11:04,982 --> 01:11:06,494
<i>will be a few days.</i>

730
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:09,279
<i>Listen, you will have a surprise.</i>

731
01:11:17,588 --> 01:11:21,085
<i>- And remember...
- The wine is made from grapes.</i>

732
01:11:22,256 --> 01:11:24,494
- Matteo!
- Antonello.

733
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,967
- Let me see.
- When did you get?

734
01:11:28,002 --> 01:11:29,620
You're great.

735
01:11:35,384 --> 01:11:38,384
Tell me what is in wine and grapes.

736
01:11:38,633 --> 01:11:40,837
I like, but do not understand.

737
01:11:41,484 --> 01:11:45,155
A farmer turned rich making wine.

738
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:49,115
He did more in life than produce wine.

739
01:11:49,483 --> 01:11:52,783
And their children,
working with him were rich.

740
01:11:53,614 --> 01:11:58,531
Facing death, he summoned
his sons and said:

741
01:11:59,062 --> 01:12:03,404
<i>My children, before dying
I'll tell my big secret.</i>

742
01:12:04,284 --> 01:12:06,940
<i> Wine can also be grape.</i>

743
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,796
Do not laugh or so I will be pulling.

744
01:12:18,845 --> 01:12:21,001
You're always complaining you're a romantic.

745
01:12:21,752 --> 01:12:24,434
- Unbelievable.
- I'm just fed up.

746
01:12:25,813 --> 01:12:27,736
Andrea, a chair was vacated.

747
01:12:28,691 --> 01:12:30,806
I want orange juice and sandwich.

748
01:12:36,662 --> 01:12:39,879
These things and views seem plastic.

749
01:12:40,145 --> 01:12:44,207
- It's true
- And to eat taste like plastic.

750
01:12:51,787 --> 01:12:54,368
Anyway... taste is good.

751
01:12:55,006 --> 01:12:56,995
How can you be always happy?

752
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,397
You do not look like an old man.

753
01:12:58,754 --> 01:13:01,480
Let's clarify something.
I am not old.

754
01:13:02,035 --> 01:13:04,169
As many who are here.

755
01:13:05,888 --> 01:13:08,491
In addition, look,
how do you explain it?

756
01:13:08,914 --> 01:13:11,420
I am so very scared of death.

757
01:13:20,851 --> 01:13:22,761
Now it is called on to ask to me.

758
01:13:23,977 --> 01:13:27,730
Tell me something.
What happens to your father?

759
01:13:31,249 --> 01:13:35,791
I got the impression that
he has something. I'm sure.

760
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:39,063
How is your mother?

761
01:13:41,409 --> 01:13:44,875
Pretty good.
Well, I tell you one thing...

762
01:13:45,104 --> 01:13:48,420
I, with my things,
my work in the gymnasium...

763
01:13:48,651 --> 01:13:50,417
friends, school...

764
01:13:50,855 --> 01:13:52,635
I can tell you almost do not see...

765
01:13:52,836 --> 01:13:55,138
Sometimes we agree, but...

766
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:59,918
if we talk, but...

767
01:14:00,596 --> 01:14:02,278
well, never really spoke.

768
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:04,579
But how is this possible?

769
01:14:06,889 --> 01:14:08,888
Come, I want you to see
something phenomenal.

770
01:14:21,955 --> 01:14:24,381
- Not possible.
- You like?

771
01:14:26,693 --> 01:14:28,887
- Are fireflies.
- Did you like?

772
01:14:30,357 --> 01:14:33,643
In Milan?
Not that there were no fireflies?

773
01:14:35,656 --> 01:14:37,192
I must be dreaming.

774
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:39,546
Just look how many.

775
01:14:42,288 --> 01:14:46,513
I never saw so many
when I was your age.

776
01:14:48,502 --> 01:14:50,045
Grandpa...

777
01:14:50,593 --> 01:14:55,251
When you were my age did you
have someone... you liked?

778
01:14:56,256 --> 01:14:58,470
No one I liked, but rather in love.

779
01:15:00,314 --> 01:15:02,775
She was the daughter of Carbonero,
I remember.

780
01:15:03,033 --> 01:15:05,050
Her name was Rosa.

781
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:07,526
Who's your litter?

782
01:15:08,317 --> 01:15:10,754
Her name is Linda.
I do not know what to do.

783
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:14,513
Rejoice. Also I'll tell one thing.

784
01:15:14,548 --> 01:15:17,596
Do not be shy with women.

785
01:15:17,881 --> 01:15:20,215
Do and say whatever comes to mind.

786
01:15:20,653 --> 01:15:21,995
But be careful.

787
01:15:22,674 --> 01:15:27,584
When a woman tells you that
she won't live without you,
and she is about to leave you.

788
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,114
- Do not be fooled.
- But is it true?

789
01:15:31,525 --> 01:15:33,647
If so, she will tell you

790
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:40,708
- What is the problem?
- Pregnancy.

791
01:15:41,179 --> 01:15:42,588
Damn.

792
01:15:43,365 --> 01:15:44,584
What did you do?

793
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:46,614
Grandpa wouldn't you know?

794
01:15:47,225 --> 01:15:49,152
- It often happens
- But you're very young.

795
01:15:49,187 --> 01:15:50,865
No, look, see?

796
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:53,680
Do you see?
I already have gray hair. Three.

797
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:56,354
- There are fifteen lire.
- How?

798
01:15:56,947 --> 01:15:59,155
Nothing.

799
01:16:00,154 --> 01:16:02,687
And the girl, how is it?
What have you...?

800
01:16:03,401 --> 01:16:04,791
What happened?

801
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:08,103
But what...?

802
01:16:10,585 --> 01:16:12,248
Was it a trick?
You tricked me.

803
01:16:12,589 --> 01:16:13,965
Yes, it's silly.

804
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:16,418
I made it up, look.

805
01:16:21,104 --> 01:16:23,417
I get it, there is a glass.

806
01:16:23,727 --> 01:16:26,283
But Linda is pregnant
and it isn't nonsense.

807
01:16:26,714 --> 01:16:28,097
Well, you're going to sleep.

808
01:16:42,995 --> 01:16:44,511
A pregnant girl.

809
01:16:46,155 --> 01:16:47,705
It's crazy.

810
01:17:03,121 --> 01:17:04,681
<i>The scale</i>

811
01:17:06,017 --> 01:17:10,791
Angela, how many times we
wanted to see "La Traviata"?

812
01:17:12,433 --> 01:17:14,370
But we never did.

813
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,257
Master. "La Traviata".

814
01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:13,445
Prelude of the third act.

815
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:16,155
Thank you.

816
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:40,546
Alvaro, I'm your dad.

817
01:20:41,089 --> 01:20:42,904
I see you have not returned.

818
01:20:43,114 --> 01:20:44,966
Have fun, congratulations.

819
01:20:45,498 --> 01:20:47,865
Please call me when you arrive.

820
01:20:48,874 --> 01:20:50,499
I will be in Turin with Norma.

821
01:20:51,624 --> 01:20:52,909
I give you a hug.

822
01:20:53,115 --> 01:20:55,155
I'm your dad.
Bye.

823
01:21:16,766 --> 01:21:18,752
I do not know if you do well, Guglielmo.

824
01:21:19,222 --> 01:21:20,915
You've been following him two days.

825
01:21:21,189 --> 01:21:24,500
You suffer and you solve nothing.
Why hide?

826
01:21:25,829 --> 01:21:30,300
- We should be with him.
- May also be right.

827
01:21:31,907 --> 01:21:33,894
But it was always like that with me.

828
01:21:35,172 --> 01:21:37,817
It is enough that he just
looks into my eyes.

829
01:21:38,597 --> 01:21:39,893
And he knows everything.

830
01:21:40,503 --> 01:21:42,848
If I had stayed... know everything.

831
01:21:45,518 --> 01:21:48,504
I am ashamed of having hidden.

832
01:21:49,503 --> 01:21:50,870
But I could not do anything else.

833
01:22:32,069 --> 01:22:33,341
- Dad!
- Norma!

834
01:22:34,058 --> 01:22:35,406
- Norma!
- Dad!

835
01:22:40,103 --> 01:22:42,163
Not surprisingly, it's all I know.

836
01:22:42,398 --> 01:22:43,696
Hi, Dad.

837
01:22:44,977 --> 01:22:47,634
- Milo, a kiss for Grandpa.
- No.

838
01:22:48,105 --> 01:22:49,920
- Come, come, kiss me.
- Milo.

839
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:51,745
Will not you kiss her grandfather?

840
01:22:53,214 --> 01:22:55,012
Grandfather stinks.

841
01:22:58,652 --> 01:22:59,742
Why are you laughing?

842
01:22:59,777 --> 01:23:01,760
When one travels they bathe little.

843
01:23:03,207 --> 01:23:05,206
And do not want to
inconvenience the landlords.

844
01:23:09,339 --> 01:23:10,850
Well, tell me.

845
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:13,433
He sizes the shoulders of your husband?

846
01:23:14,341 --> 01:23:15,614
Clearly.

847
01:23:17,249 --> 01:23:18,624
When do they speak?

848
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:20,267
Sometimes.

849
01:23:22,402 --> 01:23:25,346
We talked more in the
bathroom than in bed.

850
01:23:26,606 --> 01:23:30,731
His hands were so calloused
that he didn't need sponges.

851
01:23:35,389 --> 01:23:37,138
Liar is not true.

852
01:23:37,356 --> 01:23:40,154
That's for me.
You carved mother's shoulders?

853
01:23:40,935 --> 01:23:42,725
- No.
- Neither my husband.

854
01:23:43,503 --> 01:23:44,548
Hurry.

855
01:23:47,251 --> 01:23:49,078
How disgusting that the foam.

856
01:23:53,034 --> 01:23:54,517
Can I come to your office?

857
01:23:54,552 --> 01:23:57,168
Yes, but in these days
I do not have meetings.

858
01:23:57,203 --> 01:23:59,784
Pity, I wanted to see your command post.

859
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:02,782
- If you get lost, take a taxi.
- Well.

860
01:24:05,084 --> 01:24:06,542
Do not walk too much.

861
01:24:07,407 --> 01:24:09,379
Good morning, "Mr. Director."
Lucky.

862
01:24:09,792 --> 01:24:13,645
And fix the phone lines, sometimes get tired.

863
01:24:18,674 --> 01:24:21,407
It's behind schedule.
"Nose fine."

864
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:23,726
Get angry yesterday, grandpa?

865
01:24:24,305 --> 01:24:27,053
Gentlemen do not offend one another.

866
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:46,681
You're late.

867
01:25:07,557 --> 01:25:08,960
Good day. Telegrams.

868
01:25:10,085 --> 01:25:11,185
Can I repeat the number?

869
01:25:12,397 --> 01:25:14,478
Run, Grandpa, run.

870
01:25:14,781 --> 01:25:17,041
- Milo.
- Go, go, Grandpa.

871
01:25:17,966 --> 01:25:19,993
- Run, grandfather, run.
- I can not.

872
01:25:20,028 --> 01:25:21,616
Wait.

873
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:24,737
For failure to pay is
going to delay delivery.

874
01:25:25,182 --> 01:25:27,095
Grandpa, run, run.

875
01:25:27,321 --> 01:25:29,416
- Run!
- Milo, stop.

876
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:32,230
<i>Sincere condolences Mauro.
You okay?</i>

877
01:25:32,446 --> 01:25:34,311
- Go, go, Grandpa.
- Wait.

878
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:37,126
<i>Sincere congratulations,
Vincenzo Grossi.</i>

879
01:25:37,497 --> 01:25:39,434
- Grandfather, run.
- Milo.

880
01:25:39,806 --> 01:25:41,290
- Will you repeat?
- Milo!

881
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:44,076
- Hello?
- Run, Grandpa.

882
01:26:24,533 --> 01:26:25,910
Help!

883
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:35,852
<i>It's absurd.
Eight years have passed.</i>

884
01:27:36,729 --> 01:27:38,262
<i>Years, not weeks.</i>

885
01:27:40,437 --> 01:27:41,666
<i>Can't you accept it?</i>

886
01:27:42,353 --> 01:27:44,652
<i>I know it can work again.</i>

887
01:27:45,783 --> 01:27:48,949
<i>Why when we do it,
it is so difficult?</i>

888
01:27:49,188 --> 01:27:52,950
<i>Always the same at Christmas time.</i>

889
01:27:54,533 --> 01:27:55,696
<i>Or in the summer.</i>

890
01:27:56,232 --> 01:27:58,042
<i>is tragic.</i>

891
01:27:59,689 --> 01:28:01,699
<i>Having to pretend
to fear it's discovery.</i>

892
01:28:03,799 --> 01:28:06,427
<i>- I hate the holidays.
- Then we finish now.</i>

893
01:28:07,152 --> 01:28:11,052
<i>Stop pretending that your
father's family was happy before.</i>

894
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,404
<i>don't scream, I wake up.</i>

895
01:28:16,084 --> 01:28:18,344
<i>Every time I see
I feel sorry for him.</i>

896
01:28:19,061 --> 01:28:21,239
<i>Luckily he has no suspicion,
and is content.</i>

897
01:28:22,045 --> 01:28:23,783
<i>We can't say so now...</i>

898
01:28:25,034 --> 01:28:26,755
<i>with what just happened.</i>

899
01:28:27,346 --> 01:28:28,703
<i>I love your father.</i>

900
01:28:29,282 --> 01:28:32,579
<i>But I urge you to leave us alone.</i>

901
01:28:51,233 --> 01:28:54,579
Please do not ask what I am doing here.
I do not know.

902
01:29:03,091 --> 01:29:06,483
What is out so late?
Identification.

903
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,725
Sicilian?

904
01:29:16,949 --> 01:29:18,939
Is that bad?

905
01:30:21,075 --> 01:30:22,604
Hey, buddy!

906
01:30:23,874 --> 01:30:25,105
There are no taxis.

907
01:30:25,666 --> 01:30:26,887
It's too late.

908
01:30:27,512 --> 01:30:30,073
Come, come, my friend.

909
01:30:30,671 --> 01:30:31,874
It's cold.

910
01:30:32,139 --> 01:30:34,621
Here is free. It's big.

911
01:30:34,951 --> 01:30:37,073
And convenient, you will.

912
01:30:38,029 --> 01:30:42,439
Go to sleep there, buddy.
See.

913
01:32:06,570 --> 01:32:07,884
Norma...

914
01:32:08,212 --> 01:32:09,708
What about your husband?

915
01:32:10,795 --> 01:32:12,210
I'm in love with him.

916
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:14,135
We do not get along.

917
01:32:15,086 --> 01:32:16,774
But we have not divorced.

918
01:32:17,649 --> 01:32:20,357
If in marriage you care,
you will suffer.

919
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:23,649
Then we divorced.
After all that...

920
01:32:23,922 --> 01:32:26,918
still can't find another
who understands me.

921
01:32:28,134 --> 01:32:30,840
I live alone with my son.

922
01:33:14,372 --> 01:33:16,155
All I lied.

923
01:33:17,722 --> 01:33:18,858
But why?

924
01:33:20,036 --> 01:33:23,498
The truth is we did not
want to hurt you.

925
01:33:24,169 --> 01:33:25,265
Now you're old...

926
01:33:25,999 --> 01:33:28,470
and sick with not much life left.

927
01:33:31,724 --> 01:33:33,203
Tosca...

928
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:35,162
that boy...

929
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,499
is yours, right?

930
01:33:38,993 --> 01:33:41,270
Yes, I was afraid to tell you.

931
01:33:41,305 --> 01:33:43,413
I don't know who the father is.

932
01:33:43,448 --> 01:33:45,487
I didn't know how to react.

933
01:33:45,522 --> 01:33:48,483
There are many things you never said.

934
01:33:49,191 --> 01:33:50,718
But why?

935
01:33:50,922 --> 01:33:53,252
We always believed most talented.

936
01:33:53,657 --> 01:33:55,543
And screaming and screaming.

937
01:33:55,578 --> 01:33:57,930
Do you not remember?
And we stuck together.

938
01:33:58,264 --> 01:34:01,690
But I... I did for his sake.

939
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,141
To grow strong.

940
01:34:05,501 --> 01:34:10,424
Alvaro, where are you?
How much longer till I see you?

941
01:34:13,972 --> 01:34:17,301
I'm thinking something very ugly.

942
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:22,472
I can see where it ends
with dishonest people.

943
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:26,957
Even so, there are
many innocent people.

944
01:34:27,502 --> 01:34:29,583
But I can tell you where I am.

945
01:34:30,254 --> 01:34:32,539
You only have a slingshot.

946
01:34:32,574 --> 01:34:34,193
The burn.

947
01:34:37,771 --> 01:34:40,084
What do they want to do?

948
01:34:40,741 --> 01:34:42,498
Pretend nothing happened, Dad.

949
01:34:42,703 --> 01:34:44,269
Pretend that nothing happened.

950
01:34:45,384 --> 01:34:46,880
It's better for everyone.

951
01:34:47,474 --> 01:34:50,852
But what... what you tell your mother?

952
01:34:53,901 --> 01:34:55,726
At least you are happy...

953
01:34:55,962 --> 01:34:58,945
having them for the last
time reunited at the table.

954
01:34:59,322 --> 01:35:02,650
As in other times.
At least that.

955
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:10,463
- Come and eat in Rome.
- Yes, yes, yes!

956
01:35:10,773 --> 01:35:12,320
Yes, yes, yes!

957
01:35:13,103 --> 01:35:15,602
We will gather all together!

958
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:16,946
Health!

959
01:35:17,916 --> 01:35:18,665
Thank you.

960
01:35:19,303 --> 01:35:21,750
- We wait for more, gentleman?
- What you make?

961
01:35:22,073 --> 01:35:25,200
You see? We're ready.
Twelve hungry mouths.

962
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,738
You aren't going to take?
You do not like?

963
01:35:30,996 --> 01:35:34,559
- So, a napkin.
- Do not do that, Dad.

964
01:35:34,805 --> 01:35:37,104
Please there are people watching.

965
01:35:40,244 --> 01:35:41,716
So what, Cannie?

966
01:35:42,122 --> 01:35:43,838
How was the Congress?

967
01:35:44,206 --> 01:35:46,031
How many votes did you get?

968
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:49,995
Well, it went very well.

969
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:52,436
I won almost 80 percent of vote.

970
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,795
But what a triumph!

971
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:56,513
Congratulations to the deputy.

972
01:35:57,176 --> 01:36:01,136
Tell me, teacher, your gigs
in Europe are a success, right?

973
01:36:01,171 --> 01:36:05,879
I knew it!
I am proud, very proud.

974
01:36:06,705 --> 01:36:10,343
It was almost impossible
for everyone to come.

975
01:36:35,534 --> 01:36:37,675
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

976
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:39,987
Bon appetit.

977
01:36:42,891 --> 01:36:44,735
Of course it's a bad sign...

978
01:36:45,565 --> 01:36:49,412
to see only men at the appointment.

979
01:36:50,664 --> 01:36:51,706
Although, of course...

980
01:36:52,613 --> 01:36:54,027
Tosca...

981
01:36:54,319 --> 01:36:56,502
perhaps released some important work.

982
01:36:58,314 --> 01:37:02,376
And Norma will have
had some important meeting.

983
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:07,743
And Alvaro...

984
01:37:08,535 --> 01:37:10,851
- Dad, Alvaro...
- I do not know what he did.

985
01:37:12,596 --> 01:37:14,723
Nor what prison he's locked in.

986
01:37:16,224 --> 01:37:19,225
I just want to know when to leave.

987
01:37:31,646 --> 01:37:33,041
Dad...

988
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:38,540
Kenny is dead.

989
01:37:54,899 --> 01:37:57,428
It happened this summer.

990
01:37:58,632 --> 01:37:59,791
In July.

991
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:04,546
I, the last time I saw him...

992
01:38:04,951 --> 01:38:07,079
was six months ago.

993
01:38:09,779 --> 01:38:10,977
I was tired.

994
01:38:13,355 --> 01:38:15,194
She suffered from loneliness.

995
01:38:17,838 --> 01:38:20,179
We talked a lot.

996
01:38:23,909 --> 01:38:27,290
But I... I never thought...

997
01:38:27,604 --> 01:38:28,938
it would came to that.

998
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:35,505
He committed suicide.

999
01:38:37,721 --> 01:38:40,479
Even at this moment...

1000
01:38:40,683 --> 01:38:42,433
I don't know if we did well.

1001
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:46,014
We had decided not to tell you.

1002
01:38:50,728 --> 01:38:53,043
In newspapers little was said.

1003
01:38:53,717 --> 01:38:55,315
Only two lines.

1004
01:38:56,433 --> 01:38:58,067
And with the wrong name.

1005
01:39:07,812 --> 01:39:09,296
Where is it?

1006
01:39:09,529 --> 01:39:11,330
It seems like...

1007
01:39:12,484 --> 01:39:13,787
he took a boat.

1008
01:39:16,457 --> 01:39:18,956
He went to sea.

1009
01:39:19,985 --> 01:39:21,108
Luego...

1010
01:39:24,503 --> 01:39:26,706
he could not be found.

1011
01:39:28,676 --> 01:39:31,081
As if could be anywhere.

1012
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:34,235
The sea is big.

1013
01:39:59,358 --> 01:40:00,358
Liars.

1014
01:40:01,028 --> 01:40:02,390
Liars, lying.

1015
01:40:04,662 --> 01:40:06,048
A misnomer.

1016
01:40:06,797 --> 01:40:07,858
Loneliness.

1017
01:40:09,515 --> 01:40:12,267
What does it mean to die of loneliness?

1018
01:40:12,602 --> 01:40:15,029
Currently, what it means?

1019
01:40:18,252 --> 01:40:19,627
Loneliness.

1020
01:40:20,119 --> 01:40:23,118
With newspapers, the television
always controls that them.

1021
01:40:24,816 --> 01:40:27,197
Two lines, a misnomer. They lie!

1022
01:40:30,487 --> 01:40:34,345
If Alvaro dies, young thirty-nine years...

1023
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:35,984
strong...

1024
01:40:36,019 --> 01:40:37,845
the most intelligent of all...

1025
01:40:38,582 --> 01:40:40,893
and should be advertised
on the first page.

1026
01:40:43,597 --> 01:40:45,283
If no body is living.

1027
01:40:46,755 --> 01:40:48,133
How many are there...

1028
01:40:48,393 --> 01:40:53,605
that disappear a month or more
and come back??

1029
01:40:54,793 --> 01:40:56,190
In his case will be.

1030
01:40:56,711 --> 01:40:58,098
Have had something to do.

1031
01:40:59,197 --> 01:41:00,261
Perhaps...

1032
01:41:01,137 --> 01:41:02,804
a disappointment in love.

1033
01:41:06,523 --> 01:41:08,211
Alvaro is too sensitive.

1034
01:41:11,807 --> 01:41:12,958
Now leave me alone.

1035
01:41:28,359 --> 01:41:29,914
Why nobody sings?

1036
01:41:29,949 --> 01:41:32,731
Sing!
Here no one sings!

1037
01:41:41,358 --> 01:41:42,859
Sing, sing!

1038
01:41:46,951 --> 01:41:48,230
Let me see.

1039
01:42:07,576 --> 01:42:08,532
Sing!

1040
01:42:08,888 --> 01:42:10,064
Let them sing.

1041
01:42:37,331 --> 01:42:38,690
What's wrong, Dad?

1042
01:42:39,657 --> 01:42:41,063
Do not you feel well?

1043
01:42:41,688 --> 01:42:44,379
When you give me my 140 libras?

1044
01:42:46,856 --> 01:42:50,238
Remember how you removed
the first gray hairs?

1045
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:55,523
You promised me 5 liras
for each one removed.

1046
01:42:57,019 --> 01:42:58,377
I removed twenty-eight.

1047
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:01,114
140 liras.

1048
01:43:03,521 --> 01:43:04,753
Sir, your ticket.

1049
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:07,895
Thank you.

1050
01:43:14,367 --> 01:43:15,771
Sorry, you dropped this.

1051
01:43:17,946 --> 01:43:19,232
Thank you.

1052
01:43:19,854 --> 01:43:22,600
It is a beautiful photo.
Is he entrepreneur?

1053
01:43:26,131 --> 01:43:27,936
If artistic entrepreneur, yes.

1054
01:43:50,476 --> 01:43:53,359
<i>How many times have I told you,
Matteo?</i>

1055
01:43:54,087 --> 01:43:55,496
<i>The money in hand.</i>

1056
01:43:57,404 --> 01:43:58,609
<i>The money in hand.</i>

1057
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:00,800
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

1058
01:44:01,383 --> 01:44:04,556
<i>When the children are born
and we cut it's nails...</i>

1059
01:44:04,964 --> 01:44:07,025
<i>we put money in it's hand.</i>

1060
01:44:07,373 --> 01:44:10,464
<i>Simply enough, grow
strong and fortunate.</i>

1061
01:44:10,934 --> 01:44:12,774
<i>How many times must I tell you?</i>

1062
01:44:15,079 --> 01:44:16,778
You're right, Mom.

1063
01:44:17,747 --> 01:44:18,919
I forgot.

1064
01:44:19,884 --> 01:44:21,831
<i>Matteo, what?</i>

1065
01:44:22,557 --> 01:44:24,466
I thought my children were happy.

1066
01:44:26,151 --> 01:44:27,547
Not so.

1067
01:44:28,989 --> 01:44:31,218
The sacrifices were of no avail.

1068
01:44:32,625 --> 01:44:34,018
Not yours, Mom.

1069
01:44:34,573 --> 01:44:35,737
Not mine.

1070
01:44:37,498 --> 01:44:42,029
Neither the recommendations made,
nor the people I saw...

1071
01:44:42,438 --> 01:44:44,310
for examinations, qualifications...

1072
01:44:44,586 --> 01:44:47,457
contests, transferences...

1073
01:44:49,093 --> 01:44:50,782
the bank loans...

1074
01:44:51,630 --> 01:44:53,007
the coffins.

1075
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:55,047
<i>I told you, Matteo.</i>

1076
01:44:55,548 --> 01:44:57,631
<i>You put money in their hands.</i>

1077
01:44:58,256 --> 01:45:00,568
<i>The first time you cut the nails.</i>

1078
01:45:01,049 --> 01:45:02,155
<i>No matter how much.</i>

1079
01:45:36,253 --> 01:45:37,679
It's a boy.

1080
01:45:37,714 --> 01:45:39,646
It will be called Matteo.

1081
01:45:58,944 --> 01:46:00,788
It's out of danger. He was serious.

1082
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,441
It was a miracle.

1083
01:46:03,743 --> 01:46:05,290
Please do not get tired.

1084
01:46:20,906 --> 01:46:23,663
I finally managed to gather everyone.

1085
01:46:26,041 --> 01:46:30,570
Although were not
all around the table.

1086
01:47:00,888 --> 01:47:02,044
Trust me.

1087
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:04,903
You and your girlfriend...

1088
01:47:05,594 --> 01:47:07,123
should stay with the child.

1089
01:47:08,331 --> 01:47:11,312
They will have problems with
their families, but then...

1090
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:13,799
everything will be fine.

1091
01:47:15,435 --> 01:47:16,717
And when born.

1092
01:47:17,342 --> 01:47:19,427
The first time you cut your nails...

1093
01:47:20,311 --> 01:47:23,122
put a million in your hands, hear?

1094
01:47:24,248 --> 01:47:26,952
So grow strong and successful.

1095
01:47:27,824 --> 01:47:29,719
- Do not forget.
- Agreed.

1096
01:47:29,973 --> 01:47:31,003
And something else.

1097
01:47:32,142 --> 01:47:34,631
They don't educate it
so that he is somebody.

1098
01:47:36,048 --> 01:47:38,883
Teach them to be an ordinary person.

1099
01:47:47,537 --> 01:47:49,770
I traveled very little in my life.

1100
01:47:50,821 --> 01:47:52,922
Moreover, almost never.

1101
01:47:54,659 --> 01:47:56,007
I can't do anything.

1102
01:47:56,042 --> 01:47:57,988
Only birth certificates.

1103
01:47:58,538 --> 01:48:01,563
As a young man wanted
to be a signalman.

1104
01:48:02,297 --> 01:48:04,255
I liked the trains.

1105
01:48:05,488 --> 01:48:07,442
I was mad when he went...

1106
01:48:08,549 --> 01:48:10,253
to the cinema.

1107
01:48:10,738 --> 01:48:11,910
But despite my ignorance...

1108
01:48:13,476 --> 01:48:15,473
can tell you something.

1109
01:48:17,414 --> 01:48:19,002
Remember:

1110
01:48:20,128 --> 01:48:21,719
<i>Wine...</i>

1111
01:48:21,754 --> 01:48:23,568
<i>also made with grapes.</i>

1112
01:48:25,097 --> 01:48:26,832
And is the best.

1113
01:48:30,581 --> 01:48:33,554
Tell that to Alvaro when he returns.

1114
01:49:24,974 --> 01:49:26,508
Now that I've returned...

1115
01:49:26,543 --> 01:49:28,668
ask me this question please.

1116
01:49:29,266 --> 01:49:30,764
How did it go?

1117
01:49:31,158 --> 01:49:34,574
Angela, what happened?
Are you afraid to ask?

1118
01:49:35,112 --> 01:49:37,167
I will respond likewise.

1119
01:49:38,606 --> 01:49:40,755
It was a trip... important.

1120
01:49:41,796 --> 01:49:45,226
I wish I could show you pictures.

1121
01:49:47,643 --> 01:49:49,266
Walked a lot.

1122
01:49:50,436 --> 01:49:52,282
I discovered many things.

1123
01:49:53,328 --> 01:49:56,171
Such as our earth is...

1124
01:49:56,206 --> 01:49:59,015
beautiful in itself as they say.

1125
01:50:00,018 --> 01:50:02,481
It is beautiful because living...

1126
01:50:03,352 --> 01:50:04,925
in distant lands...

1127
01:50:05,912 --> 01:50:07,859
they seem better.

1128
01:50:08,519 --> 01:50:09,671
If.

1129
01:50:09,923 --> 01:50:12,970
How? Are our children?

1130
01:50:13,469 --> 01:50:15,037
Our children...

1131
01:50:15,486 --> 01:50:17,446
they are well.

1132
01:50:18,535 --> 01:50:20,511
If they are honorable in the continent.

1133
01:50:21,297 --> 01:50:24,172
We can walk with our heads held high.

1134
01:50:24,521 --> 01:50:26,834
Sicily and all can be proud.

1135
01:50:28,845 --> 01:50:30,985
What? Clearly.

1136
01:50:32,331 --> 01:50:36,462
They also send you
greetings and many kisses.

1137
01:50:48,817 --> 01:50:51,473
They are all well.

1138
01:54:03,874 --> 01:54:05,874
