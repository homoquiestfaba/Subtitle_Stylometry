00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,727
But you-when he comes in,
and he sees you, you-

174
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:16,599
a big smile, put your arm around him,
that's, you know,

175
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,146
"I'm gonna get you a coffee,"
and you say, "Coffee."

176
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,940
Yeah, for the big guy, a cup of coffee.

177
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,904
And you head off, and then we cut.

178
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:23,863
<i>Um Right here?</i>

179
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,699
<i>[Lynch]
Now we're sitting in the restaurant.</i>

180
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,241
<i>You are in the blue chair.
You are in the red chair.</i>

181
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,365
You have access to a sight of pie.

182
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,993
You-the waitress brings the coffees.

183
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,961
He has his coffee.
You have your coffee.

184
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,458
And you're looking at him,
and you're looking at the coffee.

185
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,381
And then he sees the pie,

186
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,220
and he gets up.

187
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,216
Well, isn't that a beautiful break?
And you look around.

188
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,388
People are reading or talking,

189
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,603
and you bring the coffee up,

190
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,097
and you surreptitiously, you know,

191
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,895
put the crystals in,

192
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,484
and you put it back over there.

193
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,569
Okay. Meanwhile, you're in-
the waitress says,

194
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,063
"Cherry-you want some cherry pie?

195
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,407
I'll bring it to you.
Go enjoy your coffee."

196
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,197
And so you say "coffee" again.

197
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,193
<i>- And you go over.
- [Kyle] Right.</i>

198
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,288
[Lynch] <i>And you're walking toward him,
and you see dandruff on his back,</i>

199
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,953
<i>and you think he's feeling sorry for you,</i>

200
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,202
<i>and he's-he's, you know, like this,</i>

201
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,704
but he's really playing
with your dandruff, right?

202
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,799
And he's now like this,
and you start breaking down,

203
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,510
and you're saying,
"Oh, my God, what have I done," right?

204
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,380
[laughing] And-and he's still
rubbing your shoulders,

205
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,930
and you reach out, and you get
that coffee, and you're sobbing,

206
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,518
<i>and you race out,
and you're running.</i>

207
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,228
<i>You're sobbing across the-
you throw open the stall,</i>

208
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,143
<i>and you dump it down in there, right?</i>

209
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,358
<i>And the guy peeing over there says,</i>

210
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,726
"That bad, huh?"

211
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,649
And-and it goes like that. Okay?

212
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,770
[Kyle] Malone.

213
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,397
[laughter]

214
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,651
[Tom]
That's inspired comedy, it truly is-.

215
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,082
Just from the depth of your souls, Tom,

216
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,622
the depth of your soul, you're so sorry.

217
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,495
You're-you're dying.

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,625
Okay. Just let-

Don't-don't come apart all the way yet.

221
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,300
Just trembling, trembling,
trembling, trembling.

222
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,898
[Tom sobbing] Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

Okay, just set it-set it down.

"I never meant to hurt anyone.
I'm so sorry."

226

Okay, Wilson, you'll be coming in

you'll be wearing headsets.

269
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,168
when Cole starts talking,

270
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,466
you'll pull your phones away,

273
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,348
You pick up the phone,
it starts going loud,

00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,142
and-and you're listening.

275

You hear it very clearly,

276
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,600
and then when you get to
Douglas Jones business,

277
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,978
you settle down a little bit, sit down,

278
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,479
<i>and rapidly type in.</i>

279
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,029
<i>Then you report to Wilson,

280
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,527
You report to Wilson, and then you say,

281
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,403
"How in the world are we gonna find them?"

282
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,156
- And then you-start it with "Wilson."
- [Jay] Okay.

283
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,999
- And really give it to him.
- [Jay] You got it.

284
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,618
And we'll cut right in the middle of that.

285
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:32,088
Okay, let's take a rehearsal
and see how it-how it goes.

286
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,003
Okay, action, Wilson.

287
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay, Headley, jump up faster

288
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,049
and be more, you know, like,
ramrod stiff.

289
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,093
- Up, and then get the phone.
- [Jay] Okay.

290
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,262
Okay, and start talking right away.

291
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,221
[softly] "Gordon Cole."

292
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,019
You really go with that one.

293
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,107
"Gordon Cole," and it sets you up.

294
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,397
- [Jay] Yeah, I can do it.
- Yeah? Okay.

295
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,771
And that-everything else is real good,
real good.

296
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,896
[Jay] Director Cole, sir, I-

297
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,739
- Okay, Headley.
- [Jay] Sir?

298
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,733
You can speak a little louder

299
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,860
and more urgently to Cole.

300
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,034
Okay, new, don't sit down
till he finishes speaking.

301
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,079
In other words, when you say "Yes, sir,"
when you're down, keep-"Yes, sir!"

302
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,918
- [Jay] Okay. Okay, you got it.
- You know, you be sharp.

303
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,003
- Okay.
- Be sharp and-and pumped.

304
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:17,592
Okay, don't-there's 23 Douglas Jones
in the-don't hurt your voice, now.

305
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,051
- Save it for the thing.
- [Jay] You got it.

306
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,465
'Cause you'll-you'll lose it.

00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,099
And, Wilson, it's like, you know,
for Gordon Cole.

310
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,222
It's like you've got Elvis Presley

311
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,224
- [Owain] Yeah. Yeah.
- So keep it-

00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,397

- Keep that star power going.

313
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,612

00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,901
<i>And then you look where it's going,
but then you see the fly,</i>

338
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,990
and it goes around his chin, okay?

339
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,825
So we have a-you-you just-
it's on you.

340
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,412
You're just looking,
like, real intense.

341
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,156
<i>And you're moving pretty fast
on this one.</i>

342
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,953
And then you come in close,

343
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,543
and you're watching up in here,
watching up in here,

344
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,539
watching up in here,
then you-then you sort of-

345
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,131
no, just reach down and get it.

346
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,625
- Oh, this is so beautiful.
- Oh!

347
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,217
Amazing.

348
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,008
' Oh!
_ [laughter]

349
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,506
- You did it right on-
- Hit me, hit me, hit me.

350
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,554
- Hit me.
- No, no. I'm not gonna hit you.

351
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,927
[Amy] I'd hit him slightly lower in the-

352
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,019
[Lynch] Okay, so this is so great.

353
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,138
- Should we shoot it?
- [man] It's on his-

00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,102
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

357
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,649
- Candie! What the...
- I'm so sorry.

358
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,989
- Candie, what did you do?
- [Robert] Get off.

359
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,450
- [Jim] Let me see. Let me see.
- [Robert] Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding?

360
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,695
- [Jim] Yeah, you're bleeding.
- [sobbing]

361
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,696
Cut it!

[laughter]

363
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,953
[Robert] I think I anticipated
the head turn a little.

364
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:02,207
[Lynch] Well, you would if you'd looked up
and saw that fucking thing coming at ya.

365
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,628
Very good, you guys.

366
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,252
[woman] You gonna try to do
a close-up on Candie still?

367
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,879
If you need...

368
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,883
If you want to out the time down...
I don't know.

369
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,680
What's with-what is this with everybody?

370
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,017
- [woman] No, no, no, no.
- What is it, really?

371
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,307
It's only me, it's my call.

372
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,476
Why-I'm not-l'm not-
I'm serious.

373
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,894
Fucking A, man.

374
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,483
It drives me nuts.

375
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,025
Who gives a fucking shit
how long a scene is?

376
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,773
Okay. Now let's see here.

377
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,741
We need a cut to make the other one work.

378
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,827
- Yeah.
- Cut of Candie crying.

379
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,117
- Okay, let's get that.
- Okay.

380
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,412
And we're still gonna get the fly
on the chin?

381
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,625
We might not have...

382
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,962

<i>Ma“ Q“. bay.</i>

392
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,508
Okay, so Thursday is Naomi's last day,

393
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,306
so I know what that is-.

394
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,270
The three Fusco brothers come in.

395
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,733
Well, first Rhonda comes in,
says the police are out there.

396
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,102
<i>They want to talk to you,
and she goes like this.</i>

397
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,524
- [man] <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>- [Lynch] And so Cooper goes like this.</i>

398
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,148
"Oh, you want him to come in here? Fine."
She goes out.

399
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,274
They come in, three detectives,

400
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,869
and trailing the three detectives,

401
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,578
pretty quickly, is Naomi-

402
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,323
is-is Janey-E.

403
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,994
And she comes in, and she's-
"What's going on?"

404
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,789
She comes up next to Cooper.

405
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,162
<i>So now we're over the two of them,</i>

406
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,505
<i>and I'll probably be right between them</i>

407
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,217
<i>and the three detectives,
and then Mullins comes in.</i>

408
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,462
[man] That's a wonderful scene.

409
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,338
- Mm-hmm.
- [man] And we have all day to do it.

410
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,682
- I think we're fine.
- We're gonna make that scene fantastic.

411
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,766
- No problem.
- [man] Yeah, yeah.

412
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,260
- That's what I think, too.
- [drumming on table]

413
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,058
[man] And Janey-E's last day,
which will be great.

414
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,398
Not to have a day that's impossible,
and we're worried, and, like, oh-

415
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,017
Yeah, but she's got a lot of dialogue.

416
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,066
[man] She does, but ifs also really fun.

417
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,654
- Mm-hmm.
- [man] It's a fun scene.

418
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,149
- Yeah.

419
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:36,118
So, remember,
you were waiting out there for so long.

420
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,612
Door open, everything like this.

421
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,865
That fucking guy's not showing up, right?

422
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,866
- So you march up to the thing.
- [Naomi] Yeah.

423
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,164
And then you see these guys go in,
you know, like this.

424
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,582
- [Naomi] Yeah. Look through the window.
- So-you know, yeah.

425
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,673
And you're look-and they're going
into Dougie's office, right?

426
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,338
<i>So you come in here.
You're-I mean, he's fate.</i>

427
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,632
<i>And now there-there's these, you know,</i>

428
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,427
<i>you get the vibe it's-
it's detectives, police.</i>

429
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,515
Good to see you guys. Rhonda's gonna...

430
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,600
And you say, "What's going on here?"

431
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,892
And-and so you're-you're irritated,

432
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:07,688
and you're-these things come out,
like, schoolmarm.

433
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,357
- You know, like, you know-
- [Naomi] Barbs.

434
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,856
- Barbs, you know, and you're just on it.
- [Naomi] Yeah.

435
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,233
<i>And in such a way {hat when they say,</i>

436
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,325
<i>"But we can talk about this tomorrow,"</i>

437
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,162
you know, when you-
when you're more calm.

438
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,203
So you're worked up
from the very beginning.

439
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,951
<i>Okay?</i>

440
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,167
<i>Not a calm scene.</i>

441
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,835
You keep it going, so that they see
that you're totally stressed,

442
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,628
and that-yeah, they-and they say,

443
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,127
- "Don't worry. It's okay, ma'am."
- [Naomi] Okay.

444
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,423
- [Lynch] <i>Okay?
'</i> [Naomi] Okay.

445
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,388
When you come into the place,

446
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,304
it's more than a stolen car.

447
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,677
- This car was blown up.
- Mm-hmm.

448
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,430
And so this could be, you know-

449
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,307
this could be a deep, you know,
troubling (hing,

450
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:52,107
so it's not like-
y0u're-you're trying to get to the bottom

451
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,777
of why someone would want
to blow this guy's car up.

452
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,276
<i>And-and there's all these fatalities now
connected to it.</i>

453
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,243
<i>You're son of starting
to put two and two together</i>

454
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,035
<i>and seeing that it's no! really them,
but you're not sure.</i>

455
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,658
<i>So, when he says,
"Yes, we know where the ca! is,"</i>

456
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:06,909
you're coming clean,

457
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,129
but take a good look at both of them
on the-you know.

458
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,796
This guy's acting weird, and this guy-
and she's on a thing.

459
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,759
- Is there anything else going on here?
- Yeah.

460
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,595
And then at the same time, you know,
she's on a stress roll.

461
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,589
- Right.
- So then you say, "Okay, look, calm down.

462
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,466
We'll-you can do this tomorrow."

463
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,808
- [Lynch] You're nice <i>to</i> her...
- [man] Okay.

464
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,974
<i>- [Lynch] ...'cause she's light on edge.
- [man] All right.</i>

465
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,314
[Lfimch] Okay. Com'.

466
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,146
[man] Quiet.

467
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,441
[man] And roll, please.

469
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,859

470
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,539
[man] Set.

471
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,877
[Lynch] Action.

472
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,167
Silver, four-door-

473
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,505
That makes you angry.

474
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,843
Just-just make-makes you sick
about that car, okay?

475
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,509
Okay, try that one more time,
and really, like,

476
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,132
"You crazy, you imbecile."
Okay, here we go.

477
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,261
Naomi, just say it again,
and be sick through the whole thing.

478
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,978
That car-a horrible car.

479
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,939
[Naomi] Ah, it's a terrible car,
always in the shop-

480
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,150
No, I'll give you a reason-get-
now stay up on the high horse.

481
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:14,610
Okay, try it again.

482
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,355
Just-just say-just ask the question.

483
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,355
"Well, there's your answer."

484
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,528
Now you start thinking, "Wait a minute.
How did he know that?

485
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,196
What's going on? Did they find the car?

486
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,786
Have they been keeping something
from you?"

487
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,281
Look at those guys.
Just keep looking at-don't smile.

488
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,952
Just keep looking at them, like,
you're not working.

489
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,620
Okay, now do it again,
and then you're looking at them,

490
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,710
and then they/re detectives,
and they're police-

491
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,376
and in case you-
and don't start thinking like-

492
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,464
Now, that sort of pisses you off.

493
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,209
Thinking about that insurance.
That's another angle.

494
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,008
Maybe a better car.
Look-shoot daggers in their eyes.

495
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,096
You're not gonna make these-We're going.

496
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,968
You know, you like Mr. Mullins,
but just give him one good look,

497
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,719
