1
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,482
Does somebody hear me?

2
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,038
Somebody?

3
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:29,624
Allow me to leave!

4
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:36,548
Open this door!

5
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:06,786
He/she thinks.

6
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:09,414
We go, he/she thinks.

7
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:53,827
Hello.

8
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:58,540
Hello!

9
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:06,482
Allow me to leave of here!

10
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:14,115
Please!

11
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:16,242
He/she has to help me!

12
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,403
Did he/she leave?

13
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,363
Did he/she leave who?

14
00:08:55,698 --> 00:08:57,700
Who he/she wants him to be,
that is in the corridor.

15
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:59,034
Did you also listen to it?

16
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:01,787
Of course that I listened to it.
Not I want to be close when he/she returns.

17
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:05,165
Your door was not closed.

18
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,001
He was not?

19
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:10,671
The blackout should have made something
in the locks.

20
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:17,386
How do you call yourself?

21
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:22,891
I don't know it.

22
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,063
I neither know mine.

23
00:09:29,022 --> 00:09:30,565
Not I can remember who am.

24
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:32,567
Or like I arrived here.

25
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:35,362
It seems that I have
the same problem.

26
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,202
Which the last thing is
that you remember?

27
00:09:42,702 --> 00:09:44,246
To wake up in that cell.

28
00:09:45,038 --> 00:09:46,039
Me also.

29
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,838
My whole life...

30
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,464
...before that moment,
it is a space in white.

31
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:57,884
Good, at least you are better
in underwear that me.

32
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:02,305
Thank you.

33
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,601
Some idea of where we are?

34
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,186
Neither a track.

35
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,073
That has to stop to happen.

36
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,536
Not I believe that this place,
it can put on more terrifying.

37
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:35,797
You know...?

38
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,549
If the lights fade,
jodidos will be.

39
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:40,218
As if now,
he were not.

40
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:46,224
Good point.

41
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:55,483
Then...
Does it list?

42
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:03,825
It is cold there outside.

43
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,326
Somebody comes closer.

44
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:16,003
Dead end.

45
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:18,673
I believe that we should prove,
toward the other side.

46
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:21,175
The doors of those cells,
they are open.

47
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:28,933
Hello.!

48
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:30,017
Is somebody there?

49
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:35,397
Alone we look for the exit.

50
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:46,534
We are here.

51
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:49,203
Who are "us?"

52
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,790
Alone me and...
a woman.

53
00:11:52,873 --> 00:11:54,083
Do they have names?

54
00:11:58,128 --> 00:11:59,713
Undoubtedly we have...
...alone that...

55
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:02,299
...none of both,
he/she can remember it.

56
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:04,760
Welcome to the club.

57
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:06,428
Us neither
we remember anything.

58
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:08,972
And that doesn't give them
a lot of fear?

59
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,684
Clear...that he/she gives us.

60
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,520
A lot.

61
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:17,731
But we are about concentrating,
in leaving of here.

62
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:20,567
And what do they believe that it is "Here?"

63
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:23,612
For what you leave,
some prison class...

64
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:24,905
...or asylum.

65
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:26,698
Pardon for not having
answered before...

66
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,201
...But we think that they were...
...guards.

67
00:12:29,576 --> 00:12:30,410
Have guards seen?

68
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:32,079
Not we have seen anybody.

69
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,791
There are... heard...
sew a so much extra.as.

70
00:12:36,124 --> 00:12:37,125
Also us.

71
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:40,420
Be what is,
that he/she is spending...

72
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:42,756
...it seems that we have the same tailor.

73
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:45,634
Her this a little sensitive,
to be in smaller pa.os.

74
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:48,887
No, I am a little sensitive,
for that you are close.

75
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:51,723
I believe that our dress,
it is it that less he/she should worry.

76
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:53,683
Is there some exit somewhere around?

77
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:56,645
I don't know it.

78
00:12:57,103 --> 00:13:02,400
After the last blackout,
we lock in our... cell.

79
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:06,780
What do they think?
do you enter or do we come out?

80
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:09,574
You revise that corridor,
we will revise toward here...

81
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:10,575
...after some gets the exit...

82
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:13,036
...we will worry
of as opening this door.

83
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:14,037
Will we separate?

84
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:16,164
Don't worry.

85
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:19,417
As soon as we get something,
we will be here.

86
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:21,669
It is well.

87
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:25,215
But if they find the heating,
before us... please light it.

88
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:26,257
We will make it.

89
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:28,885
Although, I would conform to
with a jacket.

90
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,012
I would be happy
with some pants.

91
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,265
Be careful.

92
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:50,615
Somebody was desperate
to leave.

93
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:54,285
Or to enter.

94
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:18,935
<i > Spirit, body, mind,
Luz, clothes, memory.</i>

95
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:24,565
What you believe that it has happened
with all?

96
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:27,610
I don't know it.

97
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:30,696
But what has been...
it will pass us.

98
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:32,907
I wait that not.

99
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:52,885
This this wrong.

100
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:55,512
You have just given bill?

101
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:10,944
The ladies first.

102
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:12,654
Are you joking?

103
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:15,699
I won't lower there.

104
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:18,118
There really is not another option,
or if?

105
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:19,703
If, if we have.

106
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,288
Which?

107
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,706
Do you want to return to your cell?

108
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:30,881
Neither in jest.

109
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:34,384
Well.

110
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:36,595
Stay here.

111
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:39,848
I will revise.

112
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:17,344
What is all this?

113
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:01,179
I believe that it is some type of,
camera of sensorial privation.

114
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,681
That amusing.

115
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:07,018
Not if you are locked in her.

116
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,355
Remind me of erasing it
of my list of "things to make."

117
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:25,036
One of these mark temperature.

118
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,706
It can maybe heat the room,
and to feel more comfortable.

119
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:33,628
No, thank you, I prefer to stay
out in the cold.

120
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,431
Are you listening that?

121
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,281
I hope the other ones are well.

122
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,246
In spite of everything, you worry
for people that you have just known?

123
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:10,998
I wonder to that were devoted.

124
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:18,839
That sound is new.

125
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:21,967
But not less frightening.

126
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:24,988
Did you find something?

127
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:34,164
You found a naked girl,
ba.ándose in the pool.

128
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,167
And you were with fear
of lowering the stairways.

129
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:41,921
Not you do believe that something is extra.o?

130
00:19:43,423 --> 00:19:45,675
No, because undoubtedly I believe it.

131
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:59,105
Why both not me acompa.an,
instead of hiding?

132
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,401
To where you go?

133
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,486
To speak with her.

134
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:21,544
- Hello.
- Hello.

135
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:26,090
What do you make?

136
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:27,800
Swiming.

137
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:30,386
That already sees it.

138
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:35,391
Do you know where we are?

139
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,643
No, You if?

140
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:39,020
No.

141
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:48,612
Not he/she does scare you?

142
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:49,947
Would it should?

143
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:53,492
That that the pervert
this being about saying is...

144
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:55,661
...why are you swiming here?.

145
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,916
It relaxes me.

146
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:06,171
Do you know who are?

147
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:08,632
No.

148
00:21:14,346 --> 00:21:16,515
You would care to give that become,
to be able to get dressed?

149
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:19,435
No, of course.

150
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:46,336
Passionate, not?

151
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:50,507
Did you dress that?

152
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:52,217
If I saw what?

153
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:55,053
Not it is that this much more dressed one,
of what was before.

154
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,347
He/she leaves the small calm poor person.

155
00:21:58,056 --> 00:21:59,850
Alone it is...

156
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:02,561
...afraid.

157
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:03,895
And you not?

158
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:06,106
What there is somewhere around,
to be afraid?

159
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:08,108
Already me you what will spend.

160
00:22:10,735 --> 00:22:11,736
And what will that be?

161
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:15,198
We all will die.

162
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:05,248
What rays did it happen here?

163
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:14,465
Care.

164
00:23:19,637 --> 00:23:21,222
It seems that there was a war.

165
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:23,891
Even this alive one.

166
00:23:25,852 --> 00:23:27,103
But I believe that their brain,
it is dead.

167
00:23:43,452 --> 00:23:44,954
This schemes it was used eight times.

168
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:48,833
Do you know that that is ago?

169
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,292
or did he/she make?

170
00:23:50,918 --> 00:23:51,669
No.

171
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:55,005
But what was,
it is irreversible.

172
00:23:57,925 --> 00:23:59,218
You seem to know much about this.

173
00:24:00,094 --> 00:24:01,053
How is that?

174
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:04,723
Not I am sure,
alone I know it.

175
00:24:07,518 --> 00:24:10,604
So, our abilities
they are intact...

176
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:11,605
...although our memory
it disappeared.

177
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:13,649
It is because they use different parts
of the brain.

178
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:20,072
Not I see any wound.

179
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:23,701
What means,
that somebody made him/her this, or...

180
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:27,496
... what happened, happened.

181
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:32,376
He/she looks at what we have here.

182
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,132
Now both are better.

183
00:24:38,465 --> 00:24:39,675
Thank you.

184
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:44,137
He/she looks to see that you can find,
we don't know that we will be able to need.

185
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:46,723
He/she was thinking rather
in a he/she arms.

186
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,786
How's it going in that tray?

187
00:25:09,496 --> 00:25:10,539
Oh if.

188
00:25:23,552 --> 00:25:24,386
oooppsss.

189
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:28,598
Nobody comes now.

190
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:31,059
Nobody comes.

191
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:04,884
Anything.

192
00:26:51,472 --> 00:26:53,015
If you move, she dies.

193
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:56,519
They won't make me,
what you/they made to him.

194
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,353
No!

195
00:26:58,729 --> 00:26:59,397
Be quiet!

196
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,608
He/she listens, he/she leaves the scalpel,
and we speak.

197
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:04,276
I want answers
and I want them now.

198
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:05,361
We all want answers.

199
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:09,657
He/she looks at our clothes,
we dress the same thing that you.

200
00:27:16,664 --> 00:27:18,374
I only want to know that demons
it is happening.

201
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:20,834
Not I can remember anything,
not even who am.

202
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:22,836
Us neither.

203
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:26,382
To discover it,
we should work together.

204
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:28,258
Please.

205
00:27:45,651 --> 00:27:47,236
I woke up this way,
alone in a cell.

206
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:51,031
When I saw them, I thought
that they were the responsible ones.

207
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:53,867
You made a mistake
of people, friend.

208
00:27:55,494 --> 00:27:57,955
It is well,
we all are afraid.

209
00:27:59,248 --> 00:28:00,540
What did it pass him?

210
00:28:03,085 --> 00:28:04,336
We find this way it.

211
00:28:04,628 --> 00:28:05,963
What did you make two here?

212
00:28:06,088 --> 00:28:07,381
Looking for the exit.

213
00:28:09,716 --> 00:28:11,009
I found the exit.

214
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:12,636
Did you make it?

215
00:28:13,095 --> 00:28:13,887
Where?

216
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:18,892
Continue for this corridor
and they arrived to a door of security.

217
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:20,936
But this closed one electronically.

218
00:28:23,063 --> 00:28:25,065
Be about forcing it, but it was useless.

219
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:26,107
We listen the knocking.

220
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:28,318
That was me.

221
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:30,987
That doesn't explain the other noises.

222
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:31,905
What are there of those?

223
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:26,834
We have to leave!

224
00:29:28,002 --> 00:29:28,878
Now!

225
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:31,089
Run!

226
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:49,774
We have to hide.

227
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:50,733
No, there not!

228
00:29:53,361 --> 00:29:54,236
There not!

229
00:30:07,124 --> 00:30:08,417
He/she comes after us.

230
00:30:38,697 --> 00:30:39,865
There he/she comes.

231
00:30:51,418 --> 00:30:52,669
Let us go!

232
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:24,534
What demons was that?

233
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:26,369
I don't know it, but I believe that
he/she already left.

234
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:30,665
Oh my God.

235
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:34,377
Why didn't he/she enter here to kill us?

236
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:35,503
Are you complaining?

237
00:31:39,883 --> 00:31:40,884
Oh not!

238
00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:43,845
Are you well?

239
00:31:44,095 --> 00:31:44,846
Ah, is not so serious.

240
00:31:45,138 --> 00:31:45,847
Allow me to see.

241
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:52,812
The Scalpel, do you Still have it?

242
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:53,813
If.

243
00:31:57,817 --> 00:31:58,943
It tolerates.

244
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:13,625
I see that you have already made
this before.

245
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:16,502
Probably
be right.

246
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:19,547
God willing he/she could know when.

247
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:24,636
Maybe the other ones had
better luck that us.

248
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:27,305
That waits.

249
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:31,017
For its well.

250
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,539
I believe that it is safe.

251
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:56,083
Good, it is a form of speaking.

252
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,419
Let us continue.

253
00:33:07,511 --> 00:33:09,055
Where you believe that they go
these stairways?

254
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:16,687
Below.

255
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:18,981
Cari.o...

256
00:33:39,835 --> 00:33:40,753
Do you feel like swim?

257
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:43,422
Maybe later.

258
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:51,221
How he/she sounds a hospital,
with a pool?

259
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:54,767
Don't forget the room
of sensorial privation.

260
00:34:29,092 --> 00:34:30,302
This towel still this humid one.

261
00:34:34,055 --> 00:34:35,098
That cannot be good.

262
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,141
No, he/she is not able to.

263
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:46,902
OK, Her this with us.

264
00:34:47,944 --> 00:34:49,446
Shit!
You gave us a fright of death.

265
00:34:51,948 --> 00:34:53,116
And you that made there inside?

266
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,785
Not we knew that you,
they were you.

267
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:00,582
I am getting tired that people and things
appear suddenly to my backs.

268
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:01,458
I regret it.

269
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:03,376
I promise you that next time,
I will appear for the front.

270
00:35:07,213 --> 00:35:08,465
Who is this?

271
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:10,175
We find it in the pool.

272
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,719
The same as us,
he/she doesn't remember anything.

273
00:35:13,553 --> 00:35:14,721
A pleasure to know you.

274
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:19,767
The pleasure is all mine.

275
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:22,812
And to you as it was them?

276
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:25,607
Treatment her of killing them?

277
00:35:26,774 --> 00:35:27,567
No.

278
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,319
Then, it was them better
that to us.

279
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,613
What did it happen?

280
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:35,616
We were attacked.

281
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:39,537
For kind of a... creature.

282
00:35:40,496 --> 00:35:41,497
What do you mean with "creature?"

283
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:42,498
I don't know it.

284
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,459
Not I can explain to it, it was as...

285
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:47,336
...if the shades came out of the wall,
to kill us.

286
00:35:48,921 --> 00:35:50,631
I know that it sounds disheveled,
but it is certain.

287
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:54,927
Listen you...
Did the shades attack them?

288
00:35:56,512 --> 00:35:58,598
Not alone it is impossible,
it is thing of crazy.

289
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:02,018
Possible or not, the shade killed
to the man that we knew.

290
00:36:02,768 --> 00:36:05,855
A man without memory,
the same as us.

291
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:08,983
I told them to him,
we all will die.

292
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:11,569
Could we stay positive?

293
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:17,742
Then... I understand that not
did they find the exit?

294
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,746
No, but the man that we saw die,
he/she said that the if.

295
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:25,416
unfortunately, he/she also said that
it was electronically closed.

296
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,209
I not even know,
if he/she was telling the truth.

297
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:28,335
It was a little crazy.

298
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:29,753
As you.

299
00:36:30,546 --> 00:36:33,632
Even if an exit, that "thing exists"
also this being about somewhere around.

300
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:37,177
In that case, I imagine
that they will want to look for an exit.

301
00:36:37,344 --> 00:36:38,304
Over there.

302
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:41,181
We go, follow me.

303
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:56,155
Not I trust her.

304
00:36:57,573 --> 00:37:00,742
Good, it is not necessary to worry,
unless their shade begins to grow

305
00:37:02,995 --> 00:37:04,538
In fact, that already happened.

306
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:13,213
We go boys, she belongs one to us.

307
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,772
All these corridors seem same.

308
00:37:41,616 --> 00:37:44,536
The room is at the end,
where I woke up.

309
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:50,417
And there inside...
Good, see it you.

310
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,581
Not you if this is good idea.

311
00:38:29,622 --> 00:38:32,083
If I penetrate there are people, probably
need of our help.

312
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:41,318
It was already the damned hour.

313
00:39:46,573 --> 00:39:48,075
Do you know who are?

314
00:40:09,304 --> 00:40:13,684
That is a stupid question...
It grants a doctorate.

315
00:40:15,227 --> 00:40:17,521
You know. who is?

316
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:20,065
No.

317
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:22,567
None of us knows it.

318
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:30,534
Good... that converts us
in a happy great family.

319
00:40:33,286 --> 00:40:36,665
Then, they will help me
to leave of here or what?

320
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:44,881
Don't liberate it.

321
00:40:51,263 --> 00:40:52,389
Why would not it should?

322
00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:54,933
For that have been contain,
for a reason.

323
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,269
The same thing could have been said of you.

324
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:02,357
Are you sure of this?

325
00:41:02,357 --> 00:41:04,234
If, she is sure of this.

326
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:05,402
Be quiet!

327
00:41:10,031 --> 00:41:11,366
If, I am sure.

328
00:41:13,618 --> 00:41:15,161
All here are
in the same situation.

329
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:04,669
Thank You Doctor.

330
00:42:05,753 --> 00:42:07,463
Why do I call myself "Doctor?"

331
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:13,094
Good, you have a robe,
on that underwear...

332
00:42:13,844 --> 00:42:17,306
..so or it is a Stripper or
a Doctor.

333
00:42:18,265 --> 00:42:19,976
Of anyone in the ways,
I don't complain.

334
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,793
That is disgusting.

335
00:42:46,418 --> 00:42:48,671
I have remained chained
per hours.

336
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:53,425
What it never passes you
do they give you desires?

337
00:42:56,845 --> 00:42:59,223
I assume that your neither
you know where we are.

338
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:06,480
Good... judging by the bars
I believe that it is some prison class.

339
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:13,320
And I eat we don't have clothes,
I believe that we are not those in charge.

340
00:43:14,154 --> 00:43:17,199
Good, not yet we have found
to anybody that is taken charge.

341
00:43:17,574 --> 00:43:20,536
Maybe it is like we said before,
and this it is an asylum...

342
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:21,995
...and we are patient.

343
00:43:22,037 --> 00:43:23,163
If, that is what I believe.

344
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,709
And somehow...
something passed the Doctors...

345
00:43:27,751 --> 00:43:29,044
...and we are in freedom.

346
00:43:30,045 --> 00:43:31,922
Do you believe that we are moonstruck?

347
00:43:44,226 --> 00:43:45,060
Allow it to go!

348
00:43:46,353 --> 00:43:50,023
The "moonstruck" ones,
they don't depilate his legs.

349
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,693
And with security,
they don't have access keys.

350
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:01,701
Bastard!

351
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:03,286
He/she knew that we didn't should
to have you liberated.

352
00:44:03,328 --> 00:44:04,788
Relax you boy!

353
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,251
I am not the one that would should
to cause them concern.

354
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:14,923
It is her.

355
00:44:21,971 --> 00:44:22,889
And who this there?

356
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:28,561
Judging by the door of the cell,
somebody much more dangerous that me.

357
00:44:30,563 --> 00:44:31,898
Maintain it watched over.

358
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:33,441
With all pleasure.

359
00:45:01,094 --> 00:45:02,845
There is a girl here.

360
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:10,353
What do you make?

361
00:45:10,436 --> 00:45:11,646
I will take out it.

362
00:45:11,687 --> 00:45:12,730
Don't make it.

363
00:45:12,772 --> 00:45:14,565
In this opportunity,
I should agree with the one.

364
00:45:23,616 --> 00:45:25,242
I sit down it, but me not.

365
00:45:56,565 --> 00:45:58,233
It is well.

366
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,653
Alone I will take off the mask.

367
00:46:01,278 --> 00:46:02,780
This well?

368
00:46:17,336 --> 00:46:21,465
My God!
I believed that it will never leave of here.

369
00:46:21,465 --> 00:46:22,674
He/she waits.

370
00:46:23,967 --> 00:46:25,385
They tied you very tight.

371
00:46:28,263 --> 00:46:30,057
Not even you like I arrived here.

372
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:37,898
Your friend,
he/she has a lot of anger.

373
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:41,693
One cannot say
the same of you hombretón.

374
00:46:41,735 --> 00:46:43,111
Neither you are happened to move.

375
00:46:43,153 --> 00:46:46,865
Neither two as you would rot
to stop, if he/she wanted it.

376
00:47:02,255 --> 00:47:03,423
The shades!

377
00:47:05,508 --> 00:47:06,968
You m...ueven.

378
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:15,018
We have to leave!

379
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,519
Now!

380
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,439
Oh not.

381
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,692
What does it happen?

382
00:47:23,443 --> 00:47:27,489
The hombretón with the scalpel,
is he/she afraid of their shade?

383
00:47:28,573 --> 00:47:29,741
Alone when he/she tries to kill me.

384
00:47:31,534 --> 00:47:32,452
Let us go!

385
00:48:52,865 --> 00:48:54,116
Take out them of here!

386
00:48:54,158 --> 00:48:55,409
What is there of your friend?

387
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:56,202
I will go for her.

388
00:48:58,537 --> 00:49:00,039
Let us go!,Let us go!

389
00:49:32,112 --> 00:49:33,864
She is here, in some side.

390
00:49:41,413 --> 00:49:42,706
She is here, in some side.

391
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:50,797
No!

392
00:49:50,964 --> 00:49:51,798
We leave of here.

393
00:49:52,215 --> 00:49:52,924
Now!

394
00:49:52,966 --> 00:49:53,675
No!

395
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,094
No!

396
00:50:04,853 --> 00:50:06,313
Don't save her.

397
00:50:06,354 --> 00:50:08,607
Not you can save all.

398
00:50:08,899 --> 00:50:11,776
You and I will come out together of this,
I promise it to you.

399
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:17,407
We go with the other ones.

400
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:21,244
Here, hurry!

401
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:28,293
Come unfastened!

402
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,588
What rays was that thing?

403
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,507
That era the creature of the shades,
that we told you before.

404
00:50:34,924 --> 00:50:36,092
Not it is possible!

405
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:38,761
Maybe if we are
all lunatics.

406
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,889
No... we are... crazy.

407
00:50:42,724 --> 00:50:44,058
At least, not all.

408
00:50:45,185 --> 00:50:46,311
What does it happen here?

409
00:50:46,853 --> 00:50:49,272
She left, and that thing appeared.

410
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:51,733
It seems as if she knew
what will happen.

411
00:50:56,195 --> 00:50:57,155
Why did you leave?

412
00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:59,532
Not he/she knew that he/she needed permission.

413
00:50:59,574 --> 00:51:00,491
You don't need it.

414
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:09,667
Loose it.

415
00:51:15,256 --> 00:51:16,507
Allow it to go.

416
00:51:20,136 --> 00:51:21,637
What you say.

417
00:51:24,056 --> 00:51:24,974
It grants a doctorate.

418
00:51:28,436 --> 00:51:32,231
Somebody here, knows something
of all this.

419
00:51:36,277 --> 00:51:38,029
He/she will hold on to all,
Do you know?.

420
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:42,533
As well as it killed all
those that worked here.

421
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,368
I believed that you not taenias fear.

422
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:46,120
No, I don't have it.

423
00:51:46,996 --> 00:51:48,539
Even when we are crazy.

424
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:52,793
If it killed all...
where are the bodies?

425
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,088
If it is this way...
where are all?

426
00:51:58,966 --> 00:52:01,051
Why we are not able to
to remember anything?

427
00:52:01,927 --> 00:52:03,512
Even so, I don't trust her.

428
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:07,766
Neither in you.

429
00:52:07,808 --> 00:52:10,853
And that what?
You neither are my type.

430
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:12,021
Beautiful.

431
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,273
Not we can become
those some against the other ones.

432
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:16,650
Not now.

433
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:18,777
Not with that "thing" there outside.

434
00:52:21,697 --> 00:52:23,782
What it passed with the girl
of the shirt of force?

435
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,538
It didn't achieve it.

436
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,293
I believe that it was not so dangerous,
as all we believed.

437
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:41,633
What do you believe that there is there?

438
00:52:44,011 --> 00:52:46,138
It is probably a warehouse,
we should continue ahead.

439
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,516
Not I believe that it is it.

440
00:53:41,776 --> 00:53:43,111
Boys, have to see this.

441
00:53:46,698 --> 00:53:48,032
I believe that I found who are.

442
00:53:48,533 --> 00:53:49,284
Who?

443
00:53:51,578 --> 00:53:53,580
Your you are a Programmer
of Computers.

444
00:53:53,621 --> 00:53:54,706
You call yourself Charlie.

445
00:54:19,147 --> 00:54:20,648
My name is Stacey.

446
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,611
I am an Executive of Finances,
for a signature investor...

447
00:54:28,447 --> 00:54:30,616
...and this place
it was one of my clients.

448
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:33,452
Good Stacey, you and me
we take ourselves well.

449
00:54:34,662 --> 00:54:35,496
I am a Lawyer.

450
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:36,914
And my name is Jack.

451
00:54:37,623 --> 00:54:40,251
I believe that you and me,
we won't "take Jack well."

452
00:54:41,168 --> 00:54:42,044
Why is that?

453
00:54:42,169 --> 00:54:44,880
Because according to this,
my name is Steve.

454
00:54:46,841 --> 00:54:47,925
And I am here a prisoner.

455
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,387
What do you mean with "prisoner?"

456
00:54:51,887 --> 00:54:55,141
Prisoner, bad type, criminal.

457
00:54:56,642 --> 00:54:58,394
They even have
my leaf of antecedents.

458
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,440
Non memory to have made
anything of this.

459
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:05,484
Not there is nobody bad here today.

460
00:55:07,111 --> 00:55:08,529
Single people with fear.

461
00:55:12,032 --> 00:55:15,035
What there are of you... "Does it grant a doctorate?"

462
00:55:15,744 --> 00:55:16,745
Who are?

463
00:55:19,331 --> 00:55:20,416
My name is Kate...

464
00:55:22,459 --> 00:55:24,753
Dra. Kate Adams.

465
00:55:27,297 --> 00:55:30,175
Then the "Doctor"
he/she is in fact a Doctor.

466
00:55:31,677 --> 00:55:33,137
It seems this way.

467
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:36,598
To somebody it does sound him/her something of this?

468
00:55:40,727 --> 00:55:42,062
Look at this.

469
00:55:43,939 --> 00:55:45,524
It was already hour.

470
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:01,123
It was in the certain thing...

471
00:56:02,749 --> 00:56:04,918
...If I am a patient.

472
00:56:06,002 --> 00:56:10,298
According to this, I am a model
of name Amber.

473
00:56:11,466 --> 00:56:16,763
But I had a nervous breakdown
and I was correspondent here, for treatment.

474
00:56:20,475 --> 00:56:23,603
Because there is not better place,
to cure your madness...

475
00:56:23,603 --> 00:56:24,604
...that this.

476
00:56:26,273 --> 00:56:27,232
It is well.

477
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:29,985
Your you are as the rest of us.

478
00:56:30,402 --> 00:56:31,611
I know it.

479
00:56:55,468 --> 00:56:59,305
The girl of the shirt of force,
their name was Melissa.

480
00:57:00,265 --> 00:57:01,724
He/she worked here as nurse.

481
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:15,488
And the man that we saw die below,
he/she was the Boss of Security.

482
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:19,242
The Nurse and the Boss of Security?

483
00:57:22,453 --> 00:57:24,664
It seems that that confirms that they were not
those in charge, those that made this.

484
00:57:25,581 --> 00:57:26,582
I don't understand it.

485
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:30,128
This is a prison
or an asylum?

486
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:32,421
I would say that none of two o'clock.

487
00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:34,757
Or both.

488
00:57:40,137 --> 00:57:41,264
Eight pigeonholes...

489
00:57:43,683 --> 00:57:45,518
...And we were eight...

490
00:57:49,605 --> 00:57:52,400
Eight people that are not able to
to remember who are.

491
00:57:52,608 --> 00:57:53,859
Or like they arrived here.

492
00:58:01,742 --> 00:58:03,119
Give me that boy!

493
00:58:05,287 --> 00:58:07,832
The one that has experience,
it should manage it.

494
00:58:08,207 --> 00:58:09,708
And what experience is that?

495
00:58:10,918 --> 00:58:12,294
I steal armed.

496
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,505
Murder intent.

497
00:58:15,756 --> 00:58:17,967
And tendency to the violence.

498
00:58:18,842 --> 00:58:22,471
Perfect, let us give the weapon to the criminal.

499
00:58:23,055 --> 00:58:24,473
You will take out of their cell,
to the next murderer in series...

500
00:58:24,515 --> 00:58:26,392
...that we find?

501
00:58:27,935 --> 00:58:29,395
Don't worry...

502
00:58:29,895 --> 00:58:31,230
...if him ago...

503
00:58:32,314 --> 00:58:33,273
...I protect you.

504
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:39,363
I don't believe that the bullets,
they can hurt more than a scalpel.

505
00:58:42,324 --> 00:58:44,201
But it seems that he/she fears to the light.

506
00:58:45,035 --> 00:58:49,581
In any way,
don't neglect your back...

507
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:52,793
...Jack.

508
00:59:05,013 --> 00:59:06,765
What are we waiting?

509
00:59:08,517 --> 00:59:09,476
We go.

510
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,066
What do we make?

511
00:59:28,745 --> 00:59:29,579
We follow it.

512
00:59:50,392 --> 00:59:51,309
Amber?

513
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:54,062
You say that you have walked
for all this?

514
00:59:54,104 --> 00:59:55,021
If.

515
00:59:55,772 --> 00:59:57,232
In that think?

516
00:59:57,273 --> 01:00:00,151
Good, if we are the only ones
that we are even alive...

517
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:02,695
...I want to see, of where that came.

518
01:00:05,156 --> 01:00:06,658
Will we continue to this moonstruck one?

519
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:07,867
For the time being.

520
01:00:09,077 --> 01:00:09,869
He/she waits.

521
01:00:16,751 --> 01:00:17,877
It is a telephone!

522
01:00:19,879 --> 01:00:21,923
I believe that he/she comes of behind
of those doors.

523
01:00:32,767 --> 01:00:33,684
Let us go!

524
01:00:38,648 --> 01:00:40,149
We have to arrive to that telephone.

525
01:00:42,401 --> 01:00:43,527
Allow me to prove with this.

526
01:00:45,154 --> 01:00:46,322
Open up!

527
01:00:51,285 --> 01:00:52,370
He/she stopped to sound.

528
01:00:53,996 --> 01:00:54,622
Here we won't enter.

529
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:56,499
Let us go!

530
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:01,253
Then the "hombretón" has a plan.

531
01:01:02,171 --> 01:01:04,006
Maybe somebody of them was here.

532
01:01:09,887 --> 01:01:11,972
This was the room
where I woke up.

533
01:01:19,438 --> 01:01:20,689
It is more beautiful than mine.

534
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:23,108
It is more beautiful than the one of all.

535
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:25,736
To be crazy has their advantages.

536
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:32,785
This is a mirror of two faces.

537
01:01:35,204 --> 01:01:36,538
So they observed it.

538
01:01:38,165 --> 01:01:39,500
As a laboratory animal.

539
01:01:44,046 --> 01:01:45,214
Can you break the glass?

540
01:01:53,388 --> 01:01:54,389
It is very thick.

541
01:02:02,814 --> 01:02:04,191
We have to arrive to that telephone.

542
01:02:05,484 --> 01:02:06,526
How will we make that?

543
01:02:07,444 --> 01:02:08,904
This way.

544
01:02:20,248 --> 01:02:21,583
Somebody that answers that telephone!

545
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:29,549
Hello.

546
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,801
Hello!

547
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:34,846
Hello!

548
01:02:36,556 --> 01:02:38,225
The line intersected,
in the moment that I answered it.

549
01:02:38,308 --> 01:02:39,225
Give me that!

550
01:02:39,476 --> 01:02:40,310
Hello!

551
01:02:41,186 --> 01:02:41,978
Hello!

552
01:02:42,228 --> 01:02:43,396
Damned it is!

553
01:02:44,189 --> 01:02:46,024
Suppose you that alone was
a loose cable.

554
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:48,068
Neither you are happened to begin
with me hombretón.

555
01:02:56,993 --> 01:02:58,912
Good we already happen
through the glass.

556
01:03:01,706 --> 01:03:03,291
How it can have blood...

557
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:04,834
...and non bodies?

558
01:03:07,253 --> 01:03:09,088
Many of them died here.

559
01:03:10,465 --> 01:03:11,216
Who?

560
01:03:12,008 --> 01:03:13,593
Those that made us this?

561
01:03:14,302 --> 01:03:15,261
They were people as us.

562
01:03:17,096 --> 01:03:18,306
Hey, hey, what do you make?

563
01:03:18,348 --> 01:03:18,973
What?

564
01:03:19,307 --> 01:03:21,684
Not you would drink to play anything of this.

565
01:03:21,726 --> 01:03:24,062
Hey, leaves the boy, hombretón.

566
01:03:24,604 --> 01:03:26,481
The computers
they won't make us da.o.

567
01:03:27,857 --> 01:03:29,484
The computers are friends.

568
01:03:30,735 --> 01:03:33,321
It is really that this beginning
to give me chills.

569
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:41,245
Here we cannot leave.

570
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,127
Then what?
We will die in this room...

571
01:03:48,169 --> 01:03:50,129
...or do we choose some of the other ones?

572
01:03:54,258 --> 01:03:55,259
Nobody will die
in any room.

573
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:57,970
Charlie, your you are a programmer,
he/she looks to see that you can discover.

574
01:03:58,012 --> 01:03:59,347
I am already working in it.

575
01:04:04,393 --> 01:04:10,066
We are in a Psychiatric institution,
directed by a certain Dr. Frederick Decreased.

576
01:04:13,694 --> 01:04:18,157
Apparently, Dr. Decrease it has developed
one schemes able to erase...

577
01:04:19,867 --> 01:04:21,494
...all the memories of a person.

578
01:04:25,539 --> 01:04:26,790
With which purpose?

579
01:04:29,877 --> 01:04:32,755
It was originally conceived,
for the treatment of patient...

580
01:04:32,796 --> 01:04:34,506
...with severe traumas.

581
01:04:35,549 --> 01:04:38,344
But Dr. Decrease it was
exploring other uses.

582
01:04:38,802 --> 01:04:40,137
How what?

583
01:04:43,057 --> 01:04:45,893
Amber was the first patient
with the one that was proven.

584
01:04:47,061 --> 01:04:49,938
A little end for somebody
with a nervous breakdown they don't believe?

585
01:04:50,481 --> 01:04:53,442
According to this,
you are also a nymphomaniac.

586
01:04:54,526 --> 01:04:57,696
So, allow me to guess,
did the criminal come later correct?.

587
01:05:00,991 --> 01:05:06,538
If, in an intent to take off
your violent tendencies.

588
01:05:07,873 --> 01:05:09,541
I believe that it didn't work.

589
01:05:10,876 --> 01:05:12,419
Your you were following Jack.

590
01:05:12,461 --> 01:05:12,919
Me?

591
01:05:15,422 --> 01:05:20,969
Seemingly you were catatonic
and the one erased of Dr. Decrease, he/she woke up you.

592
01:05:22,137 --> 01:05:25,557
But... something came out bad.

593
01:05:26,016 --> 01:05:26,600
What?

594
01:05:27,267 --> 01:05:28,393
Am I I not wake up?

595
01:05:28,435 --> 01:05:29,519
I don't know it...

596
01:05:31,062 --> 01:05:36,359
...something of the body guiding to the mind,
that it guides to the spirit...

597
01:05:36,443 --> 01:05:38,153
What does that mean?

598
01:05:39,613 --> 01:05:41,740
Not I have neither he/she devises.

599
01:05:42,824 --> 01:05:46,369
The registration says that it schemes it
you uses eight times, but...

600
01:05:46,411 --> 01:05:48,997
Jack is the last entrance in the registration.

601
01:05:50,874 --> 01:05:52,751
There is some thing Preposition
of the rest of us?

602
01:05:59,507 --> 01:06:03,511
Of you non Kate, but Stacey this
in the list of visitors.

603
01:06:04,387 --> 01:06:07,682
Amber and I were patient,
Steve a prisoner...

604
01:06:07,724 --> 01:06:10,018
...Stacey was a visitor, but
what are there of you Charlie?

605
01:06:11,102 --> 01:06:15,773
Together with Dave the Boss of Security
and Melissa the Nurse...

606
01:06:15,773 --> 01:06:19,402
...me... work here.

607
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:23,281
Still that doesn't explain, of where
the creature of the shades left...

608
01:06:23,323 --> 01:06:25,158
...and like we arrive here.

609
01:06:25,283 --> 01:06:26,451
He/she explains a lot...

610
01:06:27,577 --> 01:06:28,619
Steve!

611
01:06:29,787 --> 01:06:34,834
All the other ones here are dead,
except you that interesting not?.

612
01:06:34,876 --> 01:06:36,169
I don't remember anything...

613
01:06:36,294 --> 01:06:38,504
...single era the computation technician.

614
01:06:38,546 --> 01:06:39,046
Allow it to go.

615
01:06:39,088 --> 01:06:42,592
With which I like it would kill Dr. Decrease,
but of sure already this dead...

616
01:06:42,633 --> 01:06:44,969
...so alone you are me you.

617
01:06:47,096 --> 01:06:48,556
Their mind was erased...

618
01:06:48,973 --> 01:06:51,475
...it was locked in a cell
as the rest of us...

619
01:06:51,517 --> 01:06:53,227
...it is in our team,
not in that of them.

620
01:06:53,603 --> 01:06:56,606
Good... and your also
you worked Doctor here.

621
01:06:56,606 --> 01:06:58,858
Then in that
decree you are hey?

622
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,068
Of the one that takes out us
to all of here alive.

623
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:14,498
That that you Doctor says.

624
01:07:38,439 --> 01:07:39,648
Something?

625
01:07:40,941 --> 01:07:43,861
These cables go to the main generator.

626
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,155
It should have a short circuit
in some place.

627
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:52,828
To begin to revise
up to where I arrive da.o.

628
01:07:53,287 --> 01:07:56,540
And it is for that reason the twinkling
of the lights.

629
01:07:56,832 --> 01:07:58,208
And what of the phone line?

630
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:02,087
The same thing,
it is totally dead.

631
01:08:02,296 --> 01:08:04,631
Although has arrived
to the telephone before...

632
01:08:04,965 --> 01:08:07,259
...we had not been able to
to listen anything.

633
01:08:17,769 --> 01:08:18,937
We find another lantern.

634
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:20,188
And that is everything.

635
01:08:23,191 --> 01:08:24,985
What will we make Kate?

636
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:28,363
If... It grants a doctorate.

637
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:30,073
What will we make now?

638
01:08:32,743 --> 01:08:36,037
According to that map, there is alone an entrance
and exit of this place.

639
01:08:36,288 --> 01:08:39,082
And that is upstairs, where
the boss of security said that it was.

640
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:41,168
He/she also said that it was
electronically closed.

641
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:43,253
That it serves us a door
that we cannot open up.

642
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:48,633
An electronic lock,
he/she needs current.

643
01:08:49,634 --> 01:08:54,055
To disconnect it, we cut the current,
they fade the lights, the door opens up.

644
01:08:54,806 --> 01:08:55,765
Can you make it?

645
01:08:56,558 --> 01:08:57,600
The computer can.

646
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:04,232
But to be able to him to make, the net
he/she has to be in operation.

647
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:09,195
And the net needs at least,
two computers.

648
01:09:09,821 --> 01:09:10,989
Where we will get
another computer?

649
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:12,115
The one that this in the hospital.

650
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:15,034
Where was the type in coma?

651
01:09:15,493 --> 01:09:18,288
That place was totally
destroyed, everything there was useless.

652
01:09:19,205 --> 01:09:24,794
Not he/she makes lack neither the monitor neither the keyboard,
alone we need CPU to light it.

653
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:26,879
I can make the rest from here.

654
01:09:27,422 --> 01:09:30,883
Your you say that those creatures of the shades,
do they escape from the correct light?

655
01:09:32,093 --> 01:09:35,346
Your brilliant idea is
to turn off them in the night?

656
01:09:35,388 --> 01:09:37,181
Unless you have
a better idea.

657
01:09:37,223 --> 01:09:41,644
Do You Know that Amber?
maybe you are the most sensible of all.

658
01:09:42,687 --> 01:09:48,192
Once the main generator
he/she fades, alone the pool and...

659
01:09:49,235 --> 01:09:51,696
...the room of sensory privation
they are with light...

660
01:09:51,737 --> 01:09:53,531
...because they feed
of another source.

661
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:56,075
We will make it.

662
01:09:59,704 --> 01:10:02,957
Alone there is a problem...

663
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:08,170
Not I can cut the current,
until the net connection is made.

664
01:10:08,587 --> 01:10:09,380
What do you mean?

665
01:10:10,381 --> 01:10:11,549
Do you have to stay here?

666
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:16,387
No!

667
01:10:16,721 --> 01:10:18,139
You would be completely
to dark...

668
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,890
...How will you be?

669
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:23,853
With luck, with this.

670
01:10:24,937 --> 01:10:25,855
It won't achieve it.

671
01:10:25,896 --> 01:10:27,022
We could be us,
those that we don't achieve it.

672
01:10:27,106 --> 01:10:30,609
Alone you make sure of putting to work
that other computer.

673
01:10:31,235 --> 01:10:32,862
I stay with you.

674
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:42,162
In the moment that the light leaves,
you two, move.

675
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,081
We will make it.

676
01:10:44,456 --> 01:10:47,710
Alone... don't leave without us.

677
01:10:48,502 --> 01:10:49,753
Never.

678
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,651
Boys with anger.

679
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:15,112
Do you know what?
I don't trust none of both.

680
01:11:15,445 --> 01:11:17,155
Single mantén your open eyes.

681
01:11:23,328 --> 01:11:24,788
Do you believe that still this there?

682
01:11:26,957 --> 01:11:28,333
It can be in any place,
at this time.

683
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:30,085
Hiding.

684
01:11:30,377 --> 01:11:31,461
Waiting.

685
01:11:32,379 --> 01:11:33,338
Drifting.

686
01:11:37,175 --> 01:11:39,553
Let us hope he/she doesn't make a lot,
none of those things.

687
01:11:52,899 --> 01:11:55,277
Here he/she went where we find the madwoman,
naked ba.ándose.

688
01:11:55,402 --> 01:11:56,152
Naked?

689
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,196
Of having known it...

690
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:01,658
...maybe it had been
nicer with her.

691
01:12:14,003 --> 01:12:15,964
You happened
through this?

692
01:12:17,048 --> 01:12:18,341
They are more valiant
of what I believed.

693
01:12:29,811 --> 01:12:33,398
Ok... The only thing that we can
to make now is to wait.

694
01:12:37,068 --> 01:12:38,569
Do you believe that we will achieve it?

695
01:12:41,572 --> 01:12:43,157
If they make work
the other computer...

696
01:12:45,118 --> 01:12:46,202
...we have probabilities.

697
01:12:48,788 --> 01:12:51,290
And... that if they don't achieve it?

698
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:58,840
Then... he/she played me to die
beside a supermodelo...

699
01:12:58,881 --> 01:13:00,174
...nymphomaniac, semi-nude.

700
01:13:41,715 --> 01:13:42,883
Where this the body?

701
01:13:42,925 --> 01:13:43,717
What?

702
01:13:44,176 --> 01:13:47,179
The man that we knew,
the Boss of Security.

703
01:13:47,513 --> 01:13:49,265
It was murdered,
Where this their body?

704
01:13:53,852 --> 01:13:55,354
We will put
that computer to work.

705
01:13:59,274 --> 01:14:01,568
The boy said that he didn't need
neither the monitor neither the correct keyboard?

706
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:04,071
Why the creature of the shades,
has not it killed him to the one?

707
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:08,367
Maybe he/she thought that already
it was dead.

708
01:14:09,118 --> 01:14:11,620
You mean, died cerebrally,
their body even works.

709
01:14:12,996 --> 01:14:13,747
If.

710
01:14:31,473 --> 01:14:32,766
This is the it schemes of having erased
of the memories.

711
01:14:34,935 --> 01:14:36,478
Or at least what is of her.

712
01:14:38,939 --> 01:14:40,941
And I believe that this man,
it is one it kills of her.

713
01:14:41,525 --> 01:14:42,317
I sit down it for him.

714
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:46,738
What it passes hombretón,
already this working the computer?

715
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:48,115
No, you don't understand...

716
01:14:50,742 --> 01:14:52,577
It schemes it it was used eight times,
and we were eight...

717
01:14:52,577 --> 01:14:55,038
...but if you include it to the, they are nine.

718
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,585
What is Kate saying?

719
01:15:02,045 --> 01:15:05,423
She says, it is that one of us
he/she has been lying the whole time.

720
01:15:06,633 --> 01:15:07,842
One of us...

721
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,345
...it belongs one to them.

722
01:15:11,638 --> 01:15:15,308
Can the boy be then, an it spies?

723
01:15:15,558 --> 01:15:17,644
Is that what you say, it Grants a doctorate?

724
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:18,937
What the boy
it spread us an ambush...

725
01:15:18,937 --> 01:15:19,938
...to eliminate us?

726
01:15:22,148 --> 01:15:23,191
To where you go?

727
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,988
Before turning off the lights, we go
to make sure that that exit exists.

728
01:15:29,447 --> 01:15:31,199
How we know
that your you are not the spy?

729
01:15:31,449 --> 01:15:33,952
Because when they found me,
it was chained to the wall.

730
01:15:34,702 --> 01:15:37,247
And if has not been for the Doctor,
it would be probably even there.

731
01:15:38,998 --> 01:15:42,377
Make sure of not lighting that computer,
until we have returned.

732
01:15:42,669 --> 01:15:43,753
We go.

733
01:15:48,049 --> 01:15:50,426
How's it going if it is Amber,
non Charlie...

734
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,845
...and that of being the madwoman,
is single performance?

735
01:15:52,887 --> 01:15:54,639
In any way, if I die...

736
01:15:55,765 --> 01:15:57,391
...I will take myself to somebody with me.

737
01:16:17,036 --> 01:16:18,287
Jack?

738
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:22,541
How was your last name?

739
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:23,959
Why do you ask?

740
01:16:26,045 --> 01:16:26,921
Would Roberts Be?

741
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:28,923
It could be.

742
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:37,473
Because this man's name
he/she is Jack Roberts.

743
01:16:43,062 --> 01:16:44,647
Then, I believe that it could not be the one.

744
01:16:45,773 --> 01:16:47,900
No, you would not rot.

745
01:16:54,114 --> 01:16:57,117
Already you, when the lights faded,
the shade attacks and...

746
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:04,792
Who are?

747
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:15,094
We were about helping people...

748
01:17:16,762 --> 01:17:18,305
...to give them a new life.

749
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:21,683
Without being prisoners of the old one "me"

750
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:26,104
Without the memories of who you were...

751
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:28,523
...you could become
in who you wanted to be.

752
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:32,653
But something came out bad.

753
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:37,991
Not you can be somebody,
if you don't have memory.

754
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:51,630
The relationship among the mind, the body
and the spirit, is complicated.

755
01:17:53,548 --> 01:17:55,884
They are more interconnected
of what we never think.

756
01:17:57,886 --> 01:17:59,638
Jack's body was intact...

757
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,307
...but when it schemes it he/she entered
in their mind, he/she left until...

758
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:06,269
...I believe that their soul...

759
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:12,108
...and somehow
this monstrosity was liberated.

760
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:16,029
What thing is it?

761
01:18:17,322 --> 01:18:19,783
Pure essence of life.

762
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:25,121
But now their hunger,
he/she goes beyond mind and body...

763
01:18:26,748 --> 01:18:29,501
...he/she wants to consume a lifetime.

764
01:18:31,127 --> 01:18:32,504
Then it killed everybody,

765
01:18:33,838 --> 01:18:34,923
Almost everybody.

766
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:40,011
The direct light hurts him,
that knows it...

767
01:18:40,428 --> 01:18:43,598
For that reason those in illuminated cells,
they were temporarily safe.

768
01:18:44,432 --> 01:18:46,893
You always knew what would happen.

769
01:18:47,018 --> 01:18:47,810
If.

770
01:18:48,937 --> 01:18:50,188
You made it.

771
01:18:50,271 --> 01:18:51,397
What?

772
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:55,401
When the creature was liberated,
your you closed the facilities...

773
01:18:55,568 --> 01:18:57,028
...to avoid that he/she escaped.

774
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,072
To avoid me to escape.

775
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:05,411
Your you are Dr. Decrease.

776
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:08,164
If.

777
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:12,752
And who I am?

778
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,298
Your you are my wife.

779
01:19:32,563 --> 01:19:33,481
The net this lit one.

780
01:19:35,775 --> 01:19:37,485
He/she prepares the lantern.

781
01:19:39,278 --> 01:19:43,324
We were betrayed
for the nurse, Melissa.

782
01:19:44,116 --> 01:19:45,993
As you, she thought that me...

783
01:19:46,035 --> 01:19:47,786
...it was arriving very far
with my experiments.

784
01:19:47,828 --> 01:19:49,538
Contrary to you,
she counted it to Stacey...

785
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:51,373
...and she ordered an audit.

786
01:19:53,334 --> 01:19:55,294
Our money was
committed, so...

787
01:19:55,336 --> 01:19:57,254
... I was forced
to erase the mind of two o'clock.

788
01:19:58,088 --> 01:19:59,965
Charlie and the Boss of Security
they found out...

789
01:20:00,007 --> 01:20:01,842
...so they had
that to also be treated.

790
01:20:03,469 --> 01:20:04,845
Why you erased
mine also...

791
01:20:04,887 --> 01:20:06,555
...if I was your wife?

792
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:10,684
For that became
in my against Kate.

793
01:20:12,394 --> 01:20:14,021
You united to my enemies.

794
01:20:20,277 --> 01:20:21,153
I love you.

795
01:20:22,654 --> 01:20:23,405
More than to anything.

796
01:20:25,157 --> 01:20:27,159
So to preserve that love...

797
01:20:29,328 --> 01:20:30,746
...erase your mind completely...

798
01:20:30,829 --> 01:20:34,458
...removing those bad thoughts.

799
01:20:37,961 --> 01:20:39,963
You are a bastard sick person.

800
01:20:42,049 --> 01:20:43,175
Maybe.

801
01:20:44,176 --> 01:20:48,680
But ironically,
those bad memories...

802
01:20:48,722 --> 01:20:51,808
...they were eliminated forever.

803
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:56,605
The creature of the shades,
it will kill equally to all...

804
01:20:56,605 --> 01:20:59,566
...although he/she seems to prefer those
whose identity this intact one.

805
01:21:01,485 --> 01:21:05,280
Then, take off the clothes it Grants a doctorate.

806
01:21:06,823 --> 01:21:08,283
If not, you will be their first objective.

807
01:21:09,284 --> 01:21:10,869
That boy can have problems.

808
01:21:12,954 --> 01:21:14,080
Does that believe?

809
01:21:15,832 --> 01:21:17,917
It will be a long road
in the darkness...

810
01:21:17,959 --> 01:21:20,170
...being about finding the exit.

811
01:21:22,005 --> 01:21:23,340
Care!

812
01:21:29,721 --> 01:21:30,889
No!

813
01:21:33,683 --> 01:21:35,059
Stacey Runs!

814
01:21:36,978 --> 01:21:38,229
Run!

815
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:51,868
I waited to make this
during a lot of time.

816
01:22:06,924 --> 01:22:07,967
We go.

817
01:22:47,757 --> 01:22:48,591
Stacey.

818
01:22:50,259 --> 01:22:51,343
Stacey!

819
01:23:13,032 --> 01:23:13,949
Stacey.

820
01:23:17,578 --> 01:23:19,038
We go, we have to leave of here.

821
01:23:19,705 --> 01:23:21,915
The creature of the shades,
it can arrive in any moment.

822
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:23,625
Jack.

823
01:23:25,085 --> 01:23:26,253
Why did he/she make it?

824
01:23:28,589 --> 01:23:30,090
Because he/she is not Jack.

825
01:23:31,133 --> 01:23:32,384
It Is Dr. Decrease.

826
01:23:35,179 --> 01:23:36,471
We go.

827
01:23:38,432 --> 01:23:39,975
What will we make?

828
01:23:40,642 --> 01:23:42,894
Charlie and Amber will arrive
in any moment.

829
01:23:43,395 --> 01:23:45,981
And then we will release ourselves of here.

830
01:23:46,898 --> 01:23:48,692
That is very optimistic on your behalf.

831
01:23:52,112 --> 01:23:53,488
You were always an optimistic Kate.

832
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:58,785
The only thing good
of having lost the memory...

833
01:23:58,827 --> 01:24:01,121
...it is not to have to remember
having been married with you.

834
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:09,588
Originally he/she waited
that we left this, both together.

835
01:24:09,963 --> 01:24:11,423
Who is the optimist?

836
01:24:12,549 --> 01:24:14,509
Better you make sure
that none of us escape...

837
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:16,428
...and we count to the world
what you have made here.

838
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:20,932
That drifts.

839
01:24:23,018 --> 01:24:23,768
No!

840
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:24,853
No!

841
01:24:25,437 --> 01:24:26,855
Open the door!

842
01:24:28,064 --> 01:24:29,357
No!

843
01:24:30,358 --> 01:24:31,735
Open the door!

844
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,445
Open it!

845
01:24:34,028 --> 01:24:35,739
Open the door!

846
01:24:40,034 --> 01:24:41,244
It is later on.

847
01:25:12,692 --> 01:25:14,402
Amber.Run!

848
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:36,382
Where was it?

849
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:38,467
I believe that you goes.

850
01:25:40,803 --> 01:25:41,721
I believe that he/she fears to the water.

851
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:04,118
We go, let us leave of here.

852
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:25,597
Amber, Salt of the water!

853
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:32,604
Amber!

854
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:28,493
Take off the clothes.

855
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,411
What?

856
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:30,495
Make it quick!

857
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:31,496
Take off them!

858
01:30:26,211 --> 01:30:27,546
Do you remember my?

859
01:31:54,298 --> 01:31:55,883
I thought that you would be hiding here.

860
01:31:59,053 --> 01:32:00,429
Nobody is left behind.

861
01:32:00,471 --> 01:32:01,138
Do you remember?

862
01:32:01,555 --> 01:32:02,598
Charlie.

863
01:32:11,941 --> 01:32:12,691
Where this Stacey?

864
01:32:14,401 --> 01:32:15,819
Not he/she survived.

865
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:24,244
It also killed Amber.

866
01:32:26,413 --> 01:32:27,289
What did it pass with Jack?

867
01:32:27,498 --> 01:32:29,500
Not he/she is Jack, it is Dr. Decrease.

868
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:33,087
And it killed Steve
before closing up here.

869
01:32:37,549 --> 01:32:38,675
Good, not yet we are dead

870
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:43,013
No, he are not.

871
01:33:12,793 --> 01:33:14,002
Not we will be able to happen.

872
01:33:15,379 --> 01:33:19,049
Take off the clothes, he/she transforms into objective.

873
01:33:38,443 --> 01:33:39,569
Now what?

874
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:42,364
Subject the lantern.

875
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:46,034
To the bill of three, we will attack.

876
01:33:46,493 --> 01:33:47,369
What?

877
01:33:47,994 --> 01:33:49,746
This is our only opportunity.

878
01:33:55,043 --> 01:33:57,087
Don't aim him/her
until I tell you.

879
01:34:13,811 --> 01:34:14,270
Now!

880
01:34:21,277 --> 01:34:23,529
It ascends and don't stop.

881
01:35:24,548 --> 01:35:25,758
He/she waits, he/she waits, he/she waits.

882
01:35:39,646 --> 01:35:40,481
We go.

883
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:12,220
Run!

884
01:38:07,543 --> 01:38:08,294
Good morning.

885
01:38:13,174 --> 01:38:14,592
What did it happen? Where are we?

886
01:38:15,468 --> 01:38:16,427
Don't you remember?

887
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:20,764
No, I don't remember.

888
01:38:21,599 --> 01:38:22,516
Thanks to God.

889
01:38:23,017 --> 01:38:25,477
It was sufficiently bad,
to remind it one day in my life.

890
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:27,438
And the accountant returns to zero.

891
01:38:30,983 --> 01:38:32,568
What it passed with the creature
of the shades?

892
01:38:35,237 --> 01:38:37,072
I believe that ma.ana conquered it.

893
01:38:56,175 --> 01:38:57,759
It is a beautiful view.

894
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:00,971
Of for sure it is it.

895
01:39:11,106 --> 01:39:12,691
Yesterday we were born.

896
01:39:14,443 --> 01:39:15,652
Today we live.
