1
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,562
<i>- We need to know what you know.</i>

2
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,131
- It wasn't my op.
I have no intel.

3
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:08,101
- It wasn't authorized.

4
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,638
- No.

5
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:19,581
Why'd you call me here?

6
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,849
- Jeremy and Caleb
have disappeared.

7
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:26,721
As you can see,

8
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:30,592
they delivered an asset into
the hands of the Russians.

9
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:49,811
CIA contracted Anthony Greene
and his team to stop them.

10
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,278
- Reads like an ambush.

11
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,455
- Yeah, there was a shootout.

12
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,948
The asset got away.

13
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:14,301
We need to know everything
that they might have shared.

14
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,878
- What happened to
my father and Caleb?

15
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:25,713
<i>- Caleb, he fled.</i>

16
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,315
He went underground.

17
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,451
<i>- My father?</i>

18
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,353
- Greene reported that
your father went down,

19
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,932
but he had to remove
any dead and wounded

20
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:36,891
before anyone else arrived.

21
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,693
- Where's his body?

22
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,160
- I'm assuming the
Russians got him.

23
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,605
Perhaps Caleb came
back. I don't know.

24
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,263
The site was clean
once we arrived back.

25
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:52,439
As of 1800 hours last night,

26
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:55,475
their status has been
changed internally.

27
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:58,178
The CIA has deemed
them as traitors,

28
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,849
and they now have a
bounty on their head.

29
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,326
Their position with
this organization

30
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,686
has been forfeited

31
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:07,088
And anyone working with
them is now in question.

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,964
- Are you suggesting
that I'm a traitor?

33
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,470
- Within time, I'm sure you can

34
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:25,573
repair the damage
that's been done by...

35
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,842
Banshee, don't do this.

36
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:30,511
You're not an
enemy of the state.

37
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:33,548
- We both know that
Caleb and my father

38
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,650
were loyal to this organization.

39
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,919
- Well, in light of
this current situation,

40
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,185
I'm not really sure right now.

41
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,724
Don't do this!

42
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,966
- Take my name off your books.

43
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:54,267
I'm out.

44
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,537
And when I find out
what really happened,

45
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:58,806
I'll return for all of you

46
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:02,009
that left them out
there to fucking die.

47
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,245
- I got control of the cameras.

48
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,647
You're good to go.

49
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,616
In and out, just
like we planned.

50
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,185
There'll be two in the lobby.

51
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,217
- Any others?
<i>- None visible.</i>

52
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,254
<i>Second set of elevators.</i>

53
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:57,357
And your chariot is on its way.

54
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,227
- There's no way
those guys are Feds.

55
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:02,029
<i>- Obviously, he knows
there's a price on his head.</i>

56
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,535
- What the hell did
this guy do anyway?

57
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,971
- I'm the executioner,
not the judge.

58
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,329
- Damn it!

59
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:09,496
<i>- Kronos?</i>
- One second.

60
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:10,874
I'm having some
technical difficulty.

61
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,366
- Are they taking it back?

62
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,135
<i>- No, no, no. Don't worry.</i>

63
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,740
- I need to know. Am
I walking into a trap?

64
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,607
- No, it's just an
elevator. I wouldn't worry.

65
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,314
- Talk to me.

66
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,982
- All right, there's
one small thing.

67
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:30,051
- There's no such
thing as a small thing.

68
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,877
- I couldn't access the
camera on this floor.

69
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,220
- And?

70
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,623
- Ugh, someone's overriding
my control in the elevator.

71
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,432
- Do something.

72
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,498
- I can't!

73
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,506
- Well, well, well.

74
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,773
There she is.

75
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,378
Banshee...

76
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:07,314
You still going with that?

77
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,551
- Anthony Greene.

78
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,453
It's been a minute.

79
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:13,854
You took my kill.

80
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:21,328
You just cost me
a million dollars.

81
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,864
- No.

82
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:26,300
I didn't cost you a
penny, sweetheart.

83
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:31,806
In fact, I'm going to give
you the credit and the money.

84
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:35,743
And all you have to do is
hand over your boy Caleb.

85
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:48,656
Oh, man, you're still on that?

86
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:49,857
Really?

87
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,392
It's kind of sad,
don't you think?

88
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:54,595
- No, uh, I fucking don't.

89
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:57,064
'Cause every second
that I get closer

90
00:09:57,131 --> 00:10:01,769
to that piece of shit
is a second well spent.

91
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,852
- Five years is kind of a
long time to track someone,

92
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:12,480
but a revenge killing is a
revenge killing, I guess.

93
00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:13,647
- Uh-huh.

94
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:19,554
For what he did, I'm
going to take his life.

95
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:29,029
- Hmm.

96
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:32,633
We both know he's off the grid.

97
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,668
He's a fucking ghost.

98
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:38,239
- Yeah, he's a fucking ghost.

99
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,543
That's why you're the perfect
person to track him down.

100
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:47,915
- If I didn't know any better,

101
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,594
I would think that
you're too big of a pussy

102
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:51,018
to take me on one-on-one.

103
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:52,486
- Oh.

104
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:54,623
Shut the fuck up.

105
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:58,425
I ain't come here to play.

106
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,467
Banshee, do some thinking.

107
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:07,902
'Cause end of the day,

108
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:12,607
we both know how this
shit's going to end.

109
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:13,673
Don't we?

110
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:18,712
- I do.

111
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,115
Kronos, open the door!

112
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,220
- Opening elevator doors.

113
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:28,522
- Go!

114
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,793
- Kronos!
- I'm trying!

115
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:36,463
Got it.

116
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:49,143
- Walkie. She's
on her way down.

117
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,478
Do you hear me? She's
on her way down.

118
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:52,780
Move, move, move.

119
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:02,489
- I take it we're not
getting that 1 million.

120
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:06,927
- Not now.

121
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,932
- I really needed that money.

122
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,837
<i>Door's about to
open. Are you ready?</i>

123
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,506
- Fucking bring it.

124
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:24,945
How many?

125
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:26,681
- Two in the lobby.
Anthony's on the move.

126
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,781
I'm trying to stop him.

127
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:53,307
- Kronos, start the car now!
<i>- Done.</i>

128
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,276
What?

129
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:42,156
So one person did
all of this to us.

130
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,424
Who was she talking to?

131
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,225
- She called him Kronos.
- Go on this.

132
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,027
I wanna know who
he is, where he is.

133
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,897
I want my hands on him.

134
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,865
Clean this shite up.

135
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,282
- Well, that was fun, Banshee.

136
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,518
- Dude, I've told
you ten million times

137
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:11,919
do not call me that.

138
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,254
<i>- How do you know
Anthony Greene?</i>

139
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,891
- He's former Special Forces
who's made it his goal in life

140
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,561
to hunt down people for the CIA.

141
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:21,261
<i>- So he's part of the Collective</i>

142
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,764
<i>and you want him dead?</i>

143
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:37,411
- He killed someone
who's close to me.

144
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:39,490
<i>- If he's an assassin, why
does he have so many guys?</i>

145
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:43,518
- Because he's a fucking pussy,
and he knows I would kill him.

146
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,856
I need you to find
someone for me.

147
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,592
<i>- That's what I'm here for.</i>

148
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:52,426
- Find Caleb Navvaro.

149
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,400
<i>- Are you serious?</i>

150
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,537
Caleb Navvaro?
That's our target?

151
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:05,939
- Yes.

152
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:11,613
- We're talking about
the same Caleb Navvaro?

153
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,482
The one that trained
you and ran black ops?

154
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,484
- That's the one.

155
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:20,154
- D, there's a thousand
people named Caleb Navvaro.

156
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,624
If Greene couldn't find
him, there's no way I will.

157
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,559
He's been underground
for five years.

158
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:26,594
<i>And we just lost out on
a whole lot of money.</i>

159
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:29,129
<i>Can we please just move
on to the next contract?</i>

160
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:32,299
- We will not have
another shot at Anthony.

161
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,736
- Are you serious? It's
you versus a small army.

162
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:35,837
<i>Please.</i>

163
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:38,472
- I'm not letting him win again.

164
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:48,048
- You've seen the photographs.
Told you he's dead.

165
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,585
Listen, I want our money in my
account by the end of the week.

166
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:52,986
- Sir?

167
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,088
- No, as usual, it's a million.

168
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:58,593
Yeah, sure.

169
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,795
Yeah, always a pleasure.

170
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:03,363
What?
- I've a lead on Kronos.

171
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,365
- And?
- Top-rate hacker.

172
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,167
Acts as a middle
man for Banshee.

173
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,771
Apparently, he's been her
eyes and ears for a few years.

174
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:11,972
- So where is he?

175
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,041
- I don't know yet.

176
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:17,277
- So find him,
and before sun up.

177
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,552
- All right, let's see
what the CIA has to say.

178
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:30,692
- If they knew
anything, he'd be dead,

179
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:33,160
and we would not be
having this conversation.

180
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:35,996
- Is this about
the traitor thing?

181
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:38,867
- Amongst other things, yes.

182
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:55,015
<i>- The price on this
guy's head is 10 million.</i>

183
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,416
- I know.

184
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,218
<i>- And you didn't
kill him. Why?</i>

185
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,825
- You don't understand.

186
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:05,292
Greene and Caleb are worth

187
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,862
so much fucking more
to me than 10 mil.

188
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,767
<i>- All right.</i>

189
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:15,803
Would you say you knew
him better than anyone?

190
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,938
<i>- Yes.</i>

191
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:19,272
<i>Definitely.</i>

192
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,522
<i>- He had to slip
up at some point,</i>

193
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:26,915
<i>shared some kind of
info that could help us.</i>

194
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:28,550
<i>If you were Caleb,
where would you go?</i>

195
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:30,785
<i>He's from Chicago.
Would he go back?</i>

196
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:33,387
- Nah, nah, nah, nah.
No, no, definitely not.

197
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,322
He'd gain too much
attention there.

198
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,859
- Favorite vacation
spots, friends, family,

199
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:40,227
<i>something, let's... let's
work with something here.</i>

200
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:50,004
- Wellburg. Check Wellburg.

201
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,273
- Where the hell is Wellburg?
<i>- Jersey.</i>

202
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,144
<i>- All right, there's a few homes</i>

203
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,913
<i>that were purchased
five years ago.</i>

204
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,782
<i>Some businesses opened up too.</i>

205
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:05,452
<i>Barb's Hardware. We
have an Italian place.</i>

206
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,522
<i>And there's a bar
named Old Well Tavern.</i>

207
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:08,823
That's it, that's it!

208
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,357
Old Well Tavern, that's it.

209
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,002
<i>- Old Well Tavern, It's
owned by Walter Herrero.</i>

210
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:13,928
<i>Looks like Mr. Herrero
bought the house and bar</i>

211
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:15,597
<i>about three years ago.</i>

212
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:18,633
- Mm.

213
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,071
Lay low for two years,
start a new life.

214
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:26,074
That's fucking
him. Take me there.

215
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,642
<i>- Update the GPS.</i>

216
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:55,402
This is what I call a game.

217
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:58,773
Players who can actually play.

218
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,075
- It's a rerun, Rick.

219
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,376
- Still.

220
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,512
You know what I'm saying, right?

221
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:07,214
Our team can't stay healthy,
and our bullpen sucks.

222
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,616
- Ugh.

223
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:10,551
I can't see that
changing any time soon.

224
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:15,056
Imagine if we got some decent
pitching like those guys.

225
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:16,456
- Hmm.

226
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:18,793
- We'd be a ball club
worth playing against.

227
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,263
Ah! Another shot.

228
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:33,007
What was the, uh, home team
where you come from again?

229
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:34,408
Laredo, right?

230
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,778
- Nuevo Laredo,
across the river.

231
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,913
- Mm.

232
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,783
Do you run a tavern there too?

233
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,385
- You always drink this
much at 10:00 a.m.?

234
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:58,298
- Kronos?

235
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:02,870
I'm here.

236
00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:04,505
- How are you this morning?

237
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:07,608
- Probably better than you
are. Did you drive all night?

238
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:10,912
- No, I stopped at some dumpy...

239
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:13,213
Some dumpy...

240
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,482
Gee, Kronos, come on, man.

241
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,851
- All right, I'm here.

242
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:17,918
I'm here.

243
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:23,457
- Anyway, so I stopped
at some dumpy place,

244
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:25,325
and I had a shower and
a little bit of sleep.

245
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,327
- Little vacation.

246
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,529
- Shut up.

247
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:37,739
- You're almost there.

248
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:40,273
- I know.

249
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,511
There's something I
wanna talk to you about.

250
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:45,980
This is kind of a
personal matter,

251
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:49,083
so I'm gonna go offline until
I sort things out with Caleb.

252
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:53,221
- No complaints with me.
I finally get a day off.

253
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,422
- Good to know.

254
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:58,059
I'll see you on the
other side, my friend.

255
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,292
<i>- Godspeed, Banshee.</i>

256
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,828
- Don't fucking call me that.

257
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:11,906
- Mmm!

258
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,811
You're a real asshole,
you know that?

259
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:19,714
The only reason I
keep coming back here

260
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:23,918
is because my wife's a
bitch and you open early.

261
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:27,354
- Well, at least you come back.
- Yes.

262
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,756
- Yes.

263
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:42,603
- Sorry.

264
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,438
No, it was my fault.

265
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:47,208
I'm the one who should be sorry.

266
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:51,279
And between me and you,
get your drinks and leave.

267
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:54,148
The owner is a real crank.

268
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,683
- He's always been that way.

269
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,287
Yeah.

270
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:18,239
- Anybody else here?

271
00:22:18,306 --> 00:22:20,308
- Mornings are quiet.

272
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:26,247
There is a latch
right behind you.

273
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:27,314
You know what to do.

274
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,725
- I assume you want these down?

275
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,459
- Sure.

276
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:52,773
- Caleb, don't.

277
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,308
- I have to.

278
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,447
And you too.

279
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:02,415
Just slowly.

280
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,927
That's good.

281
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:16,463
- It's great to see you too.

282
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,065
Yeah.

283
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:21,502
- How did you find me?

284
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:27,440
- You said you were going
to buy this place someday.

285
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:28,576
- Hmm.

286
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:30,678
- You were drunk, but...

287
00:23:30,745 --> 00:23:32,479
- What?
- Sincere.

288
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:34,348
- You remember that?

289
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:38,853
- I'm not here to kill you.

290
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:41,822
- Okay.

291
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:45,192
So what is my price anyway?

292
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:46,193
4 mil, 5 mil?

293
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,930
- Ten.

294
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:52,199
- Well, that feels pretty good.

295
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:55,269
- And it's, uh...

296
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:57,470
it's gonna get collected
if you don't listen to me.

297
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,778
Anthony Greene is
gunning for you.

298
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:08,883
He, uh, beat me to a
job and ambushed me...

299
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,519
and offered me a
mil to give you up.

300
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:12,720
- So you gave me up.

301
00:24:12,787 --> 00:24:17,091
- Who do you think I am?

302
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:19,660
- I haven't seen you in
years, so I don't know.

303
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,099
- And whose fault is that?

304
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:31,872
I am not gonna let him
get away this time.

305
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:37,912
And I can't handle
his army alone.

306
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:45,553
- It looks like I...

307
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,989
I trained you well.

308
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,126
So...

309
00:26:17,478 --> 00:26:20,948
Hey, Suit, don't move!

310
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:22,583
- Who's the girl
with the black hair?

311
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,485
- She's my daughter.
- Your what?

312
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:26,787
- Yeah. Hailey, she's fine.

313
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:27,888
- Who is she?

314
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:31,425
- Uh, she's an old
friend from work.

315
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:32,561
- Are you a hostage?

316
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:33,961
- No! No.

317
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:36,497
Just stop pointing your
gun at our guest, right?

318
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:38,265
- You have a lot of
explaining to do.

319
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:39,433
- Yeah.

320
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:41,570
Well, you know, Hailey,
this is, uh, Delilah.

321
00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:43,704
Delilah, Hailey.

322
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:45,372
Come on, give me that.

323
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:56,717
- Get ready to lose
everything you own, Dogmom93.

324
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:01,355
<i>- ♪ Don't talk to me ♪</i>

325
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:03,190

Hmm.

332
00:27:23,578 --> 00:27:25,146
Hello?

333
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:32,186
Hello?

334
00:27:36,357 --> 00:27:38,359
Hello?

335
00:27:55,176 --> 00:27:58,312
- Kronos, are there any
guns hidden in here?

336
00:28:01,282 --> 00:28:06,086
We're gonna find them
if there are, so...

337
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:08,523
make things easier for
yourself and tell us.

338
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:14,195
- I always keep a
revolver in the pizza box.

339
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:17,798
- Hmm.

340
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:23,737
- Kronos.

341
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:28,209
What a shithole.

342
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:34,348
So you're a gambler, huh?

343
00:28:34,415 --> 00:28:36,817
That's expensive.

344
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:38,018
You ever won?

345
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:40,321
- Not my lucky day.

346
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,855
- Eh.

347
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:45,326
I wouldn't say that.

348
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:48,128
Yet.

349
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:51,600
So this is how you live, huh?

350
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:55,169
Computers and fucking plants.

351
00:28:58,072 --> 00:29:00,374
- Plants don't talk back.

352
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:07,414
- Kronos, perhaps over here
would be more comfortable.

353
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:08,916
- Okay.

354
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:21,428
- So you know the man I've
been looking for, don't ya?

355
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:27,569
No.

356
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:29,470
Well, I got a hunch

357
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:33,508
that you know exactly
where the fuck he is.

358
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:36,277
No.

359
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:41,181
Well, if you don't know where
he is, maybe Banshee does.

360
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:45,452
And I know for sure
you know where she is.

361
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:49,990
I'm here to offer you something.

362
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:58,733
That there...

363
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,834
is a million dollars.

364
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:06,708
Now, what's your usual cut?

365
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:08,309
20% maybe?

366
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:12,980
Look at the balls on this guy.

367
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:19,554
Tell him.

368
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:21,723
- Your real name's
Michael Shea Thomson.

369
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,325
You graduated from MIT with
a degree in computer science

370
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:26,761
before joining the Department
of Homeland Security,

371
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,862
where you spent
every waking moment

372
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:31,265
preventing Russian cyberattacks.

373
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:33,434
That is, until you
realized there's more money

374
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:37,605
in contracting and
made the switch.

375
00:30:37,672 --> 00:30:39,039
- He knows me.

376
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:43,545
- Yeah, we know you.

377
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:47,281
Your mom and dad are dead.

378
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:49,718
And I can't find
anyone who loves you

379
00:30:49,784 --> 00:30:52,754
that I can terrify and hurt.

380
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:54,789
So...

381
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:59,893
do I just kill you and then
find Banshee on my own?

382
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,697
No?

383
00:31:02,764 --> 00:31:07,368
Well, that's kinda handy 'cause
I'm not much of a computer guy.

384
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:11,171
But these four
people in this room

385
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:14,174
are very, very good
at hurting people.

386
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:17,978
And they will hurt
you for hours.

387
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:23,718
Now, do I have to
keep you alive?

388
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:26,053
Not at all.

389
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,256
Is it convenient for me?

390
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:30,658
Maybe.

391
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,371
- I wanna run your contracts.

392
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:47,007
I wanna be your
eyes and your ears.

393
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,410
I wanna be your new cyber guy.

394
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:55,916
- Why would I do that?

395
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:59,486
- 'Cause I can give you Banshee.

396
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:01,955
Let's make this deal.

397
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:08,295
- You give me Banshee,
you give me Caleb.

398
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:12,366
But if you try and fuck
me, son, I'll find ya.

399
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:32,986
- Is your mom a painter?

400
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:35,122
- Was.

401
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:36,490
She's dead.

402
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:42,664
- Nancy got diagnosed with
cancer four years ago.

403
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,567
She... she died a few
months before we moved here.

404
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:49,571
- I'm sorry.

405
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:51,539
Yeah.

406
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:55,710
- If she's your friend,

407
00:32:55,777 --> 00:32:57,444
then how does she
not know about Mom?

408
00:32:57,512 --> 00:33:02,249
- Well, we... we... we
weren't that close, actually.

409
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,753
- Are you kidding?

410
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,125
- What are you
guys talking about?

411
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,061
- Your dad and my
dad were very close,

412
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:16,296
so we grew up together.

413
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,035
- Was your dad in construction?

414
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:29,911
- We worked into... In
construction together.

415
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:32,279
- Yep, well, there was a time...

416
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:36,450
we'd be in some kind
of danger spots and...

417
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:38,285
- Yeah, like when we
had to build skyscrapers

418
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:41,221
and had to have
each other's backs.

419
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:46,937
- What does any of that have to
do with not knowing about Mom?

420
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:53,066
- Well... it's been a
long time, Hailey, really.

421
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:54,969
Yeah.

422
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:56,275
- Well, she knows where we are.

423
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:59,007
Does she know about the mob?
- Hailey, enough.

424
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:01,241
Don't you have
some homework to do

425
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:03,277
or a show to watch
on television?

426
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,116
- Fine.
- Good.

427
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:10,450
- I'll go upstairs.

428
00:34:10,518 --> 00:34:11,518
- Thank you.

429
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:29,837
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm...
okay. All right.

430
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:30,904
- Good night.

431
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,350
Construction worker?

432
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,419
Really?

433
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:47,055
Out of all the
options that you had,

434
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,957
you went with
construction worker?

435
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,528
- Yeah.

436
00:34:53,595 --> 00:34:55,763
Construction sites in big cities

437
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,497
can get tangled
with dirty people,

438
00:34:57,565 --> 00:34:59,266
giving me a reason to
move to a small town.

439
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,637
So construction.

440
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:06,040
- Ah, so you're
hiding from the mob?

441
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:11,178
Makes sense, why she
said hello at gunpoint.

442
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:15,683
Oh, and you're training
her to fight the mob.

443
00:35:17,986 --> 00:35:19,496
Well, it's interesting
because it's very similar

444
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,254
to how you trained me.

445
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,390
Yeah.

446
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:27,227
So you wanted to
talk about Anthony.

447
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:30,765
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

448
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:32,543
- Was he there that night
with you and my father?

449
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:36,004
- No, no, no, no. We're
done with my past, eh?

450
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,006
We're talking about Anthony.

451
00:35:38,072 --> 00:35:41,509
- This isn't about your past.

452
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:43,845
You are...

453
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:48,683
You <i>were</i> such an
amazing mentor for me.

454
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,586
And I need you.

455
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:52,854
I really do.

456
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,055
I need your help.

457
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:02,864
- You know, all your
questions are for Anthony.

458
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,215
Yeah, he was there.

459
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:28,455
- Was he alone?

460
00:36:28,523 --> 00:36:29,724
Did he bring anyone?

461
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:30,958
- Does it matter?

462
00:36:34,294 --> 00:36:35,294
- No.

463
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:43,771
- So you're gonna
fight Stalin Jr.?

464
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:45,606
- No.
- Oh.

465
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:49,711
- We are going to
fight him together.

466
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:56,316
Don't you wanna stop hiding?

467
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:58,753
- Can't change the past.

468
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:01,789
I am fine.

469
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:03,256
I'm fine right here.

470
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,262
- What happened to you?

471
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:16,170
- You know, I...

472
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:18,873
I wish your father was here

473
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,878
as much as you do.

474
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:27,314
I know what it feels
like to be alone.

475
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,788
There is more to life than
just contract killing.

476
00:37:36,157 --> 00:37:38,458
I'm happy now.

477
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:40,460
Right here, right now, yes.

478
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:46,801
- Well, I'm happy
for your happiness.

479
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:47,902
- Thank you.

480
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:54,642
But, um...

481
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:57,645
I am not gonna be your bait.

482
00:37:59,312 --> 00:38:01,916
- Hey, it was a good move.

483
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:07,454
- Well, you taught me well.

484
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:13,727
Hold on.

485
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:35,683
The files on your
dad are two in back.

486
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:40,688
- Good night, Banshee.

487
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,592
- Thank you.

488
00:38:46,027 --> 00:38:47,027
- You're welcome.

489
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:25,066
- Malia, this is Mr. Navvaro.

490
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:29,003
He's a friend of myself
and our organization.

491
00:39:32,106 --> 00:39:35,843
- Uh...

492
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,980
Miss Malia, I... I understand,
uh, your father is,

493
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:41,616
uh, is a powerful man.

494
00:39:41,682 --> 00:39:43,851
- You know who he is.

495
00:39:43,918 --> 00:39:45,485
- I do.

496
00:39:45,553 --> 00:39:47,922
I would like to
know who you are.

497
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:51,859
And I also would like to know

498
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:55,062
what do you get out
of this whole thing?

499
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:03,571
- Protection. All I
want is protection.

500
00:40:03,638 --> 00:40:05,506
- But, yeah.

501
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:06,707
But you don't get protection

502
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:08,509
just because your
father is a billionaire.

503
00:40:08,576 --> 00:40:10,511
You know I can't grant it.

504
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:20,154
- On that drive is just a taste.

505
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:21,789
Customers, transactions,

506
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:24,457
but most important,
blueprints to weapons

507
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,560
most governments
don't even know about.

508
00:40:26,627 --> 00:40:28,596
The government, with all
the secrets he's stolen,

509
00:40:28,663 --> 00:40:32,300
takes a leap forward
by ten years.

510
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:33,501
- Right.

511
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:38,205
- It's all there.
- I'm sure it is.

512
00:40:40,975 --> 00:40:45,579
Or it's all fake

513
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:48,716
and you're just,
uh, setting us up.

514
00:40:48,783 --> 00:40:51,752
- I don't care what
you suits think.

515
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:54,355
I get you the names
of all his buyers

516
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:56,524
and the locations
of all his weapons,

517
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,393
and I get protection.

518
00:41:03,197 --> 00:41:04,497
He's a monster,

519
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:08,569
and I need you to hide me as
far away from him as you can.

520
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:21,415
- Right.

521
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:25,119
I'll make some calls, yeah.

522
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:52,213
Good morning.

523
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:56,117
Hmm.

524
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:05,292
- So that's what happened.

525
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:13,801
I knew it.

526
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:15,770
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

527
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:17,204
I fucking knew it.

528
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,678
Where's my dad?

529
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,349
- Move on. You know
nothing has changed.

530
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:29,717
Nothing.

531
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:41,629
- They didn't recover his body.

532
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:43,330
He could still be out there.

533
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:47,334
- Banshee, I saw him go down.

534
00:42:55,843 --> 00:42:59,780
- But they didn't find him.

535
00:42:59,847 --> 00:43:01,615
He could still be out there.

536
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:06,887
- You know, I-I-I told you
yesterday, that's, uh...

537
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:08,923
- That's a question for Anthony.

538
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:17,198
- Good morning.

539
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,983
- Am I interrupting something?

540
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:36,917
- Uh, no.

541
00:43:36,984 --> 00:43:40,287
Just, uh, having
a cup of coffee.

542
00:43:40,354 --> 00:43:44,492
Speaking of which,
uh, I should be going.

543
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,093
Ugh.

544
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:52,032
D, call the tavern
if anything comes up.

545
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:09,783
- The pub has a
front and a back door

546
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,385
that leads to a parking lot.

547
00:44:11,452 --> 00:44:14,455
It's pretty straightforward.

548
00:44:14,523 --> 00:44:17,758
- There's nothing
straightforward about Caleb.

549
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:19,693
What about the house?

550
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:25,666
- Dead-end streets
surrounded by woods.

551
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:27,401
- Banshee's probably there.

552
00:44:27,468 --> 00:44:30,437
That means Caleb knows
that you're coming.

553
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:32,373
- We're coming?

554
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:33,707
Are you not going?

555
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:35,843
- Oh, Jesus Christ,
you know what?

556
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,479
You want to question me again?

557
00:44:38,547 --> 00:44:39,914
Please.

558
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,617
Do I need to find
another assistant?

559
00:44:44,785 --> 00:44:46,020
How long?

560
00:44:46,086 --> 00:44:49,056
- Um, six hours or so.

561
00:44:51,992 --> 00:44:54,629
Call the Philly team.

562
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:56,797
- What are you thinking?

563
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:58,766
- Two teams.

564
00:44:58,832 --> 00:45:01,802
One takes the house,
one takes the tavern.

565
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,672
They can be there
within the hour.

566
00:45:06,307 --> 00:45:08,909
And tell the team that
goes to the Old Well,

567
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:12,146
you know, be subtle, be quiet.

568
00:45:12,213 --> 00:45:14,081
Caleb is smart. It
may all be for not.

569
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:16,050
Tell them to text me
when they're in position.

570
00:45:16,116 --> 00:45:17,885
- Got it.

571
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:21,623
- And remind them
I want him alive.

572
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:25,392
Alive and kicking
'cause he's mine.

573
00:45:25,459 --> 00:45:28,862
You got it?
- Got it.

574
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,397
- So make the damn call.

575
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:37,606
You, find me a
take-away. I'm starving.

576
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:03,764
- All right, so we
head out at 1500.

577
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:06,166
No sooner, no later.

578
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:09,704
Stay off the main
road at all cost.

579
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:13,340
We wouldn't want any uninvited
guest during the party.

580
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:17,512
Now, when we reach the
outskirts of town, we hit dirt.

581
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:21,382
Now, all off-road until we
find an old packing house

582
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,183
about seven clicks out.

583
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,887
There, the handoff
to the CIA happens.

584
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:29,123
Male and female agents,

585
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:31,892
they will take Malia and her
drives into protective custody.

586
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:33,595
Good? Happiness?

587
00:46:33,662 --> 00:46:37,464
All right, so get some coffee,
take a nap, and be ready.

588
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:43,437
- Jeremy, wait.
- What is it?

589
00:46:43,505 --> 00:46:47,808
- This all sounds
great, Mr. Navvaro.

590
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:49,810
But?

591
00:46:49,877 --> 00:46:52,614
- But there's no Plan B.

592
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:53,782
- This is a routine op.

593
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:55,249
We have done it
hundreds of times,

594
00:46:55,316 --> 00:46:58,553
and I trust my men, believe me.

595
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,988
- Seems as though you've
taken every precaution

596
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:02,524
against my father's men,

597
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,527
who are definitely out there
hunting for me right now.

598
00:47:05,593 --> 00:47:09,897
But you've taken no precautions
against your own men.

599
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:13,334
- Malia, if I may,

600
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,704
it is normal to be
a little nervous

601
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,139
or even paranoid as we
get closer to the handoff.

602
00:47:19,206 --> 00:47:20,441
- Is it..
- But...

603
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:24,178
- More rational to be
paranoid or careless?

604
00:47:24,244 --> 00:47:27,381
I am risking
everything being here.

605
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:30,317
You have no idea what he'll
do to me if he catches me.

606
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:31,885
I've held up my
end of the bargain,

607
00:47:31,952 --> 00:47:34,488
and I expect you to do the same.

608
00:47:34,556 --> 00:47:36,924
- We are.

609
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:41,462
Have you met the agents
I'm being handed off to?

610
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:42,564
- Of course.

611
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,600
They are CIA agents
with top clearance.

612
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:48,570
- The CIA's always been the
most trustworthy organization.

613
00:47:48,636 --> 00:47:51,372
- Let us do our job, Malia.

614
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:54,875
In six months, you will be
living wherever you want

615
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:56,778
and doing whatever
the fuck you want.

616
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,414
Trust me, okay?

617
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:02,049
Okay.

618
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:09,323
- Hey, it's okay.

619
00:49:54,796 --> 00:49:57,732
- Used to be one
of my favorites.

620
00:49:57,799 --> 00:50:00,467
- Used to?

621
00:50:00,535 --> 00:50:02,770
- Memories suck when
you know how they end.

622
00:50:07,609 --> 00:50:09,911
So what's your deal?

623
00:50:09,978 --> 00:50:12,045
- My deal?

624
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:13,356
- You came here to
get my dad's help,

625
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,549
but you haven't done anything

626
00:50:14,616 --> 00:50:17,519
but eat and stare at
photos of my family.

627
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:22,624
Were you lovers or something?

628
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,459
No.

629
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:29,597
I've known him
since I was seven.

630
00:50:29,664 --> 00:50:31,064
- Is he in danger?

631
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:36,971
Look, I know he's in
danger with the mob.

632
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:39,541
I looked at your
file on the table.

633
00:50:39,607 --> 00:50:40,985
Are you with the
government or something?

634
00:50:41,009 --> 00:50:42,249
- You shouldn't have done that.

635
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:43,678
- I'm sorry. I
couldn't help it.

636
00:50:43,745 --> 00:50:45,523
I feel like he's in danger,
and he is all I have left.

637
00:50:45,547 --> 00:50:47,147
Hey, if he's in
danger, I need to know,

638
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:48,048
because I will not
let anything...

639
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:50,952
- Stop!

640
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:53,453
I'm here to help you.

641
00:50:53,521 --> 00:50:57,090
Now, tell me everything
that you know.

642
00:50:57,157 --> 00:51:00,427
Sit.

643
00:51:00,494 --> 00:51:02,095
Sit.

644
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:32,092
- Tough, but quiet bar owner.

645
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:34,394
Love it.

646
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:36,564
Let's start with,
uh, three beers.

647
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:40,167
- Sure.

648
00:51:40,233 --> 00:51:41,936
All right.

649
00:51:42,003 --> 00:51:43,170
- And some menus.

650
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:48,076
- Oh, I'm sorry, but,
uh, the cook is sick.

651
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:50,778
- That's fine then.

652
00:51:50,845 --> 00:51:52,714
We're celebrating, actually.

653
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,481
- All right.

654
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:57,117
- Yep, my son's getting married.

655
00:51:57,184 --> 00:51:58,620
- Oh, wow.

656
00:51:58,686 --> 00:52:03,357
Well, nothing says wedding
destination like Wellburg.

657
00:52:03,423 --> 00:52:05,258
Ah!

658
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:06,460
- He grew up here.
- Yeah.

659
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,967
- It's like one last
bit of nostalgia

660
00:52:07,996 --> 00:52:11,032
before he takes that
next big step in life.

661
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:15,202
- Hey, you know, you seem
happier about it than he is.

662
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:23,578
- Ah, what can I say?

663
00:52:23,645 --> 00:52:25,513
Guess he knows what he's
getting himself into.

664
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,180
Yeah, it's true.

665
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:28,783
Excuse me, gentlemen.

666
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:39,794
- They're in position.
- Good.

667
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:41,461
Give them the go.

668
00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:43,665
And tell the other
team to hit the house.

669
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:46,366
And make sure they find
anything they may have on me,

670
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:49,604
and to keep him alive
until I get there.

671
00:53:02,215 --> 00:53:04,886
- I didn't read much of it.

672
00:53:04,952 --> 00:53:06,854
I just saw pictures of bodies

673
00:53:06,921 --> 00:53:09,724
and buzz words
like nuclear codes.

674
00:53:12,492 --> 00:53:15,797
Are people coming here?

675
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:17,899
- Yes.

676
00:53:17,965 --> 00:53:19,366
- What are we gonna do?

677
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:41,055
It's my dad.

678
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:43,356
<i>- Hey, Baby.</i>

679
00:53:43,423 --> 00:53:44,568
You see, I forgot to tell you

680
00:53:44,592 --> 00:53:46,894
that the repairman is coming by.

681
00:53:46,961 --> 00:53:48,029
- They're here.

682
00:53:55,036 --> 00:53:58,271
- Yeah, I'll be there
as soon as I can, yeah.

683
00:53:58,338 --> 00:54:00,307
Uh, yeah, give a kiss
to the baby for me.

684
00:54:00,373 --> 00:54:02,677
- I will.
- Thank you. Bye.

685
00:54:05,378 --> 00:54:06,279
- Get your gun.

686
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:08,082
Now!

687
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:38,311
- Honestly...

688
00:54:38,378 --> 00:54:39,747
I have seen worse.

689
00:54:39,814 --> 00:54:42,449
I mean, you were
very good, very good.

690
00:54:42,517 --> 00:54:44,085
But these two?

691
00:54:44,152 --> 00:54:46,087
They preform like wet towels.

692
00:55:14,282 --> 00:55:15,516
- Three entrances. Any others?

693
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:17,618
- Basement entrance
comes out down the hall.

694
00:55:17,685 --> 00:55:18,695
- Hailey, I want
you to go upstairs,

695
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:19,954
lock yourself in your room.

696
00:55:20,021 --> 00:55:21,330
And do not come out
until I say it's clear.

697
00:55:21,354 --> 00:55:22,924
- I'm not leaving you alone.

698
00:55:24,091 --> 00:55:25,159
- Hailey, go!

699
00:57:29,016 --> 00:57:30,985
- Let me go!

700
00:57:43,631 --> 00:57:45,266
- Get off! Get up!

701
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,114
- Don't worry.

702
00:58:00,181 --> 00:58:01,983
I'll take care of your
girl when you're gone.

703
00:59:05,479 --> 00:59:06,947
- Hey.

704
00:59:07,014 --> 00:59:08,014
Baby.

705
00:59:10,084 --> 00:59:11,952
Hey, baby.

706
00:59:30,037 --> 00:59:35,009
Um... hey...

707
00:59:35,076 --> 00:59:40,147
she needs to know the truth...

708
00:59:40,214 --> 00:59:42,683
before she hears lies.

709
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:46,620
- Yes.

710
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:52,259
- I'm so sorry I didn't
tell you this before.

711
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:53,260
I'm sorry.

712
00:59:53,327 --> 00:59:54,505
- It's okay, it's
okay, it's okay.

713
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:56,597
- Hmm, yeah?

714
00:59:56,664 --> 00:59:58,332
I, you know, I have trained you.

715
00:59:58,399 --> 01:00:03,437
And you have to listen
to... To D now, all right?

716
01:00:03,505 --> 01:00:05,272
You understand me?

717
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:06,440
- I understand.

718
01:00:06,508 --> 01:00:09,310
- You understand what
I'm trying... good, good.

719
01:00:14,583 --> 01:00:17,218
Hide her.

720
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:18,520
- I will.

721
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:24,658
- You know they want her, right?

722
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:26,595
- Yes.

723
01:00:28,829 --> 01:00:32,266
- Hey, Baby, you're...

724
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:35,136
you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

725
01:01:04,365 --> 01:01:06,333
- What's the word on the
team that had the house?

726
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,570
- Not a thing.

727
01:01:08,637 --> 01:01:10,137
- Okay, they're dead.

728
01:01:10,204 --> 01:01:11,648
- I mean, maybe
they're just waiting...

729
01:01:11,672 --> 01:01:13,874
- Nah, they're dead.

730
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:15,676
What about the spotters?

731
01:01:15,743 --> 01:01:17,978
- They're in position now.

732
01:01:18,045 --> 01:01:21,982
Caleb's car's there, but
no sign of him or Banshee.

733
01:01:22,049 --> 01:01:25,252
- So they're holed up in
the house waiting for us.

734
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:29,256
What're you hearing?

735
01:01:29,323 --> 01:01:31,992
- Our three are dead
inside the tavern.

736
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:34,395
- And is there anything
to link them back to us?

737
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:36,263
- Cops think it was
a robbery gone wrong.

738
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:38,032
They're trying to
find the owner.

739
01:01:38,098 --> 01:01:41,335
- How long before
we get some backup?

740
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:43,113
- There's another team
coming from the city now.

741
01:01:43,137 --> 01:01:45,406
They'll be here in three hours.

742
01:01:45,472 --> 01:01:47,609
- Ugh, make sure they hustle.

743
01:01:47,676 --> 01:01:49,009
I want these assholes.

744
01:01:49,076 --> 01:01:51,712
- What if they run?
- Where?

745
01:01:51,779 --> 01:01:53,548
There's only one
way out of town.

746
01:01:53,615 --> 01:01:55,015
The spotters will see them.

747
01:01:55,082 --> 01:01:57,952
So now, we just sit back and
we play the waiting game.

748
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:33,821
- What was it he
wanted me to know?

749
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:38,459
- The truth about who he was.

750
01:02:46,133 --> 01:02:50,104
<i>The CIA sent a man named
Anthony to kill them.</i>

751
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:53,941
<i>They said that
they were traitors</i>

752
01:02:54,008 --> 01:02:56,010
<i>selling witnesses'
intel to the Russians.</i>

753
01:02:58,045 --> 01:03:00,881
<i>- Why would the CIA do that?</i>

754
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:04,552
<i>- They were getting old.</i>

755
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:06,755
<i>They were too powerful,
and they knew too much.</i>

756
01:04:27,602 --> 01:04:28,770
- Fuck!

757
01:04:47,354 --> 01:04:49,490
<i>- Caleb went into hiding.</i>

758
01:04:49,557 --> 01:04:51,258
<i>My father had been shot.</i>

759
01:04:51,325 --> 01:04:52,993
<i>And Anthony's brother
had been killed.</i>

760
01:04:57,364 --> 01:05:00,802
- So Anthony will come here?

761
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:05,305
- I fucking hope so.

762
01:05:05,372 --> 01:05:09,611
- Good.

763
01:05:09,677 --> 01:05:12,980
Do you have a plan?

764
01:05:13,046 --> 01:05:18,419
- I'm working on one.

765
01:05:18,485 --> 01:05:20,254
- Come with me.

766
01:05:30,899 --> 01:05:32,166
Will this help?

767
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:49,049
- He kept all these?

768
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:50,852
- He had trust issues.

769
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:55,690
Lucky me.

770
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:07,836
We should take the upstairs.
It'll be to our advantage.

771
01:06:07,902 --> 01:06:10,170
- My dad said if you
aren't mobile, you're dead.

772
01:06:10,237 --> 01:06:11,338
- Normally, that's true.

773
01:06:11,405 --> 01:06:14,975
But if we go anywhere,
they'll find us.

774
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:17,110
This house is our territory.

775
01:06:17,177 --> 01:06:20,113
It's advantageous to us.

776
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,382
- Won't they just burn us out?
- No way.

777
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:24,953
They need Caleb's
body as proof of kill.

778
01:06:25,018 --> 01:06:25,954
I have a price on my head,

779
01:06:26,019 --> 01:06:27,339
so they'll wanna
collect that too.

780
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:48,643
- How many you got?

781
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:49,811
- Enough.

782
01:06:52,881 --> 01:06:54,516
- Send them in.

783
01:07:25,479 --> 01:07:28,650
- What was he really like?

784
01:07:28,716 --> 01:07:30,150
- What?

785
01:07:30,217 --> 01:07:34,622
- My dad. What was
he really like?

786
01:07:34,689 --> 01:07:37,224
- I think you probably
knew him best.

787
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:39,426
You just knew a
different version of him.

788
01:07:42,964 --> 01:07:44,164
- Which version did you know?

789
01:07:47,969 --> 01:07:52,907
I knew the big, strong,
I'm-a-bad-ass Caleb.

790
01:07:56,476 --> 01:08:00,247
He had a hard shell, but...

791
01:08:00,314 --> 01:08:02,249
he had a soft spot
for a few people.

792
01:08:12,026 --> 01:08:14,996
- What was it like when
you lost your parents?

793
01:08:18,933 --> 01:08:21,836
- It was hard.

794
01:08:21,903 --> 01:08:24,739
I was angry.

795
01:08:24,806 --> 01:08:27,976
But I just kept my head
down, focused on the work,

796
01:08:28,042 --> 01:08:31,813
and eye on the prize.

797
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:43,190
- So he really
never mentioned us?

798
01:08:43,256 --> 01:08:44,759
- No.

799
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:51,833
Which means he loved
you more than anything.

800
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:52,910
He was protecting your safety

801
01:08:52,934 --> 01:08:55,069
even from the ones that
he trusted the most.

802
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:10,084
- So you guess it's just us now?

803
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,385
- Yes.

804
01:09:15,422 --> 01:09:18,793
- That's fine.

805
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,260
Kinda like you.

806
01:09:23,463 --> 01:09:25,399
- Kinda like you too.

807
01:09:58,265 --> 01:10:00,968
- Why are they not getting out?

808
01:10:19,352 --> 01:10:21,321
- Come here.

809
01:10:24,992 --> 01:10:26,426
- What are you doing?

810
01:10:26,493 --> 01:10:29,396
- They're using thermal.
We need to register as one.

811
01:10:47,081 --> 01:10:49,150
<i>- Looks like the front
door is boarded up.</i>

812
01:10:52,352 --> 01:10:54,254
- Walkie.

813
01:10:54,321 --> 01:10:55,890
Go around the back.

814
01:10:55,957 --> 01:10:57,191
Make sure it's the same.

815
01:10:57,257 --> 01:10:58,257
<i>- Roger that.</i>

816
01:11:27,588 --> 01:11:28,856
- Two guys across the yard.

817
01:11:31,626 --> 01:11:34,461
<i>- Back door's boarded up too.</i>

818
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:36,130
- Did they just board
it up and leave?

819
01:11:43,738 --> 01:11:46,908
- All I'm seeing is
one thermal image,

820
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:50,745
so what the fuck are
you talking about?

821
01:11:50,812 --> 01:11:53,047
- Is there any sign
of life downstairs?

822
01:11:53,114 --> 01:11:56,284
<i>- Negative. I'll
go around back.</i>

823
01:11:56,349 --> 01:11:58,119
- Sir, what if it's a trap?

824
01:11:58,186 --> 01:11:59,821
- Of course it's a trap.

825
01:11:59,887 --> 01:12:02,355
But I need to know who
the second person is.

826
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:06,961
Use this to find out
before Caleb's on.

827
01:12:09,864 --> 01:12:10,898
It's time.

828
01:12:33,521 --> 01:12:36,423
- Hey, Banshee!

829
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:42,029
Little bitch! Little bitch!

830
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:45,066
Time to play!

831
01:12:45,132 --> 01:12:47,001
Come on, Banshee.

832
01:12:48,502 --> 01:12:50,905
I know you're in there.

833
01:12:53,808 --> 01:12:57,078
- D, don't worry about me!

834
01:12:57,144 --> 01:12:58,445
Kill this bastard!

835
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:07,555
- Banshee...

836
01:13:07,622 --> 01:13:10,558
are you really going
to let your boy die?

837
01:13:13,426 --> 01:13:14,862
- Do something.

838
01:13:14,929 --> 01:13:17,298
- I can't.

839
01:13:17,365 --> 01:13:20,501
Anthony's the only one
who knows about my father.

840
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:24,505
- Oh!

841
01:13:29,076 --> 01:13:31,178
Three more in the back.

842
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:32,580
Go.

843
01:13:42,757 --> 01:13:44,517
- Three going around
back! They're coming in!

844
01:15:01,235 --> 01:15:04,305
- Oh, fucking Christ!

845
01:15:06,674 --> 01:15:09,343
Rush the house!
Rush the house!

846
01:15:38,672 --> 01:15:39,673
- How's it going?

847
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,175
- Not great!

848
01:16:41,368 --> 01:16:42,670
Fucking useless.

849
01:16:45,306 --> 01:16:47,608
They keep kicking them
before they go off!

850
01:16:47,675 --> 01:16:49,544
- Cook 'em.
- What?

851
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:50,678
- Cook 'the grenades.

852
01:16:50,744 --> 01:16:52,379
- I don't know what that means!

853
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:54,682
- Hold them for a few seconds
before you throw them.

854
01:16:59,653 --> 01:17:04,158
- One, two, three...

855
01:17:14,768 --> 01:17:17,404
- You got a gun?

856
01:17:25,614 --> 01:17:27,281
You do now.

857
01:17:29,183 --> 01:17:30,684
Come on.

858
01:17:58,979 --> 01:18:00,314
- Five or six coming in!

859
01:18:00,381 --> 01:18:01,949
- Eyes on Anthony?
- I don't know!

860
01:18:02,016 --> 01:18:03,217
They're all wearing masks!

861
01:18:03,284 --> 01:18:05,452
- Fucker's trying
to wear us down.

862
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:33,974
Go upstairs now.

863
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:54,895
Fuck!

864
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:17,318
- Go. Go, go, go, go!

865
01:20:34,769 --> 01:20:36,805
- Finally.

866
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:38,472
- Fuck off.

867
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:44,978
Do you got any men left alive?

868
01:20:45,045 --> 01:20:48,583
- I don't know. I
think they're all dead.

869
01:20:51,118 --> 01:20:53,688
- No, I can't do this.

870
01:20:53,755 --> 01:20:55,757
- Of course you can.

871
01:20:55,824 --> 01:20:57,191
Listen to me.

872
01:20:57,257 --> 01:20:59,393
Who we find in that
building, I want them alive.

873
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,928
- Are you serious?

874
01:21:00,994 --> 01:21:02,363
- Yeah, I'm serious.

875
01:21:02,429 --> 01:21:05,332
Until I put them in body
bags, I'm very serious.

876
01:21:05,399 --> 01:21:06,399
Go.

877
01:21:16,611 --> 01:21:18,813
Fuck.

878
01:21:18,879 --> 01:21:19,879
- Whoa!

879
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:25,419
Wow.

880
01:21:25,486 --> 01:21:26,920
Look at you, girl.

881
01:21:28,422 --> 01:21:29,657
Good job.

882
01:21:31,793 --> 01:21:32,861
Where's Caleb?

883
01:21:35,797 --> 01:21:37,532
Go, go, go!

884
01:22:08,095 --> 01:22:10,431
Where's Caleb?

885
01:22:10,497 --> 01:22:11,800
- I have an idea.

886
01:22:11,866 --> 01:22:13,744
How about you get your
fucking dudes off the girl?

887
01:22:13,768 --> 01:22:16,771
I'll tell you where Caleb is,
you tell me where my father is,

888
01:22:16,838 --> 01:22:18,105
everybody's fucking happy.

889
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:23,845
- I don't recall
where your father is.

890
01:22:23,912 --> 01:22:25,145
- You're a liar.

891
01:22:25,212 --> 01:22:27,582
You know what? You're right.

892
01:22:27,649 --> 01:22:29,149
I do recall.

893
01:22:29,216 --> 01:22:30,919
The last time I seen him,

894
01:22:30,984 --> 01:22:33,287
there was a couple of guys
beating the shit out of him.

895
01:22:33,353 --> 01:22:35,322
And he was lying
in a pool of blood.

896
01:22:35,389 --> 01:22:37,859
Silly me.

897
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,609
- Get the fuck in here!

898
01:22:54,676 --> 01:22:57,745
- Feels like a little
much for a teenage girl!

899
01:23:00,882 --> 01:23:02,617
- They never found a body.

900
01:23:04,586 --> 01:23:09,423
- Or because your father's
a traitor, and he ran away.

901
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:11,425
- Wrong. Get them
off the fucking girl!

902
01:23:22,804 --> 01:23:26,708
- Where's Caleb?

903
01:23:26,774 --> 01:23:29,911
- Buried in the back yard.

904
01:23:29,978 --> 01:23:33,413
- Now you're upsetting me
because I know you're lying!

905
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:38,051
'Cause after Caleb shot my men,

906
01:23:38,118 --> 01:23:41,221
I know he came back here.

907
01:23:41,288 --> 01:23:42,790
Where the fuck is he?

908
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,503
- Oh, you're feeling tough?

909
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:56,671
Okay.

910
01:23:58,673 --> 01:24:01,709
Let's do this old school.

911
01:24:19,961 --> 01:24:21,896
- Shoot her!

912
01:25:18,118 --> 01:25:20,153
Shoot her!

913
01:25:55,255 --> 01:25:57,224
- Yeah. Hey, hey, hey.

914
01:25:59,493 --> 01:26:02,229
Where...

915
01:26:02,295 --> 01:26:04,331
the fuck...

916
01:26:04,398 --> 01:26:08,670
is... Caleb?

917
01:26:08,736 --> 01:26:09,837
Huh?

918
01:26:09,904 --> 01:26:13,107
- You punch like a
little fucking bitch.

919
01:26:13,173 --> 01:26:15,543
- Hey, asshole.

920
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:17,210
Fuck you.

921
01:26:21,248 --> 01:26:22,817
- Fuck.

922
01:27:10,397 --> 01:27:14,267
- Are there more?

923
01:27:14,334 --> 01:27:16,403
- I hope not.

924
01:27:19,874 --> 01:27:23,410
- I got shot today.

925
01:27:23,477 --> 01:27:25,947
- I got shot too.

926
01:27:26,013 --> 01:27:29,817
- No. I got shot.

927
01:27:29,884 --> 01:27:31,152
In the shoulder.

928
01:27:34,922 --> 01:27:37,759
- It's a flesh wound.
You'll be okay.

929
01:27:43,231 --> 01:27:44,799
- What's next?

930
01:27:44,866 --> 01:27:47,001
Are more people
gonna shoot at us?

931
01:27:52,305 --> 01:27:53,508
- Probably.

932
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:59,180
It just depends on where
we go and who we go after.

933
01:28:02,617 --> 01:28:04,252
But for now, let's
just get a cocktail

934
01:28:04,317 --> 01:28:07,420
and a steak in a hotel room.

935
01:28:07,487 --> 01:28:09,456
