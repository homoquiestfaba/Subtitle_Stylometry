1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:04,237
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,350
(tense music)

3
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,166
(phone beeps)

4
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,769
- [Sanders] Get me the Senator.

5
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,077
- The Colonel.

6
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,614
- The situation under control?

7
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,285
Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,354
Some fucking mess
you've created.

9
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,824
You call me when it's done.

10
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:01,428
(slow suspenseful music)

11
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,800
- [Sanders] There
she is, right there.

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,134
Come on, step on it.

13
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,142
(tires screeching)

14
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,725
(woman panting)

15
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,716
(gun fires)

16
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,160
(sullen music)

17
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,632
(woman gurgling)

18
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,691
(gun fires)

19
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,394
(eerie music)

20
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,943
- So, anyone else
give me some examples?

21
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,279
Tyler?

22
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,416
- Um, stem cell research.

23
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,751
- Ah.

24
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,852
Stem cell research.

25
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,491
Yet another moralistically
ambiguous topic.

26
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:16,262
Is it ever ethical to sacrifice

27
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,599
one embryo to save 10,

28
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,370
20, a hundred or a
thousand individuals?

29
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,839
Who would like to speak to that?

30
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,375
Caleb.

31
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,543
- Yeah, I think so.

32
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,346
I mean, it's all about
the greater good, right?

33
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,582
- I don't know
Caleb, you tell me.

34
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,085
Mr. Anderson.

35
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,087
- Well, define the greater good.

36
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,824
- Ah, (chuckles) define
the greater good.

37
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,394
Ava, why don't you
do that for us?

38
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,697
- I don't think
it's right at all.

39
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,567
Who's to say one life is
more important than another.

40
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,769
I mean, where do
we draw the line?

41
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:00,440
- So, we have four
very different opinions
to one question.

42
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:04,310
A four-sided, complex
moral question.

43
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,146
Now, who's to say
that either side

44
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,050
will be able to see the
other's perspective.

45
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,818
Right?

46
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:15,021
Ms. Donovan.

47
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,592
- I'm not sure.

48
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,329
- Indecisiveness will
get you only so far

49
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,897
in my class young lady.

50
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:30,737
- Well, then, I'd have to
say it's highly unlikely.

51
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,005
I mean, it's hard
enough to get two people

52
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,506
to agree on a movie,

53
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:37,543
let alone the value of one
life versus the collective.

54
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,679
- Very well put, Ms. Lacie.

55
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,915
All right, good people,
that takes us to the end.

56
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,718
It is indeed semester break,

57
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,888
and contrary to what
Mr. Caleb believes,

58
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,624
I am not an unreasonable man.

59
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,927
So, I've only assigned
chapter seven and eight

60
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,895
to be completed over break.

61
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,364
And yes, Mr. Anderson,

62
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:02,802
there will be an exam over
this material when you return.

63
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:03,670
- Can't wait.

64
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,772
- All right, good
people, that's it.

65
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,673
Enjoy your break.

66
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,274
Get some rest.

67
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,876
We'll see you in
a couple of weeks.

68
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,050
Ms. Donovan, can I
speak to you a moment?

69
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,386
- What's up, Professor?

70
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,622
- Well, I'll be frank,
you're missing work.

71
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,924
Two research projects,
two essay papers,

72
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:28,695
plus you've got a 62
on that last exam.

73
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,297
Now, I'm telling you this
because you're a good student.

74
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,932
Use the break to
get it together.

75
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,002
Come back, finish out
the semester strong.

76
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,470
- I do want to.

77
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,872
I just, I had to work the
night before the exam,

78
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,842
and I did give you the
Roe versus Wade paper.

79
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,112
- Ms. Donovan, I am
not your life coach.

80
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,714
I'm your professor.

81
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,016
You've got time to
make up the work.

82
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,251
Let's make sure that you do.

83
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,686
Okay?

84
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,554
- Okay.

85
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,460
(phone ringing)

86
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:02,929
Hey.

87
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:03,963
Whats' up?

88
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,067
(Lacie sighs)

89
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,102
I can't.

90
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,407
Okay.

91
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,009
Yeah, thanks.

92
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,947
(Lacie laughing)

93
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:24,984
Yeah, good.

94
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,919
Have a good time.

95
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:30,123
(slow suspenseful music)

96
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,127
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

97
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:37,797
Okay, bye.

98
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,040
(dramatic music)

99
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,043
(microwave beeping)

100
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,447
(light knocking)

101
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,948
- [Killian] Lacie.

102
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:56,983
- Hey, Killian.

103
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,317
- Good, you are up.

104
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,053
Listen, Joe is having
a party tonight,

105
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,989
and you are coming with me.

106
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,590
- Yeah, I don't know.

107
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,693
- Okay, well you do know that
it is officially break, right?

108
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,729
Come on, everyone's doing it.

109
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,899
- Is this peer
pressure I'm detecting?

110
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,833
(Killian laughs)

111
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,202
- No, no, but you
want to fit in, right?

112
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,770
(both laughing)

113
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,772
- Yeah, no, I would
love to go, but um,

114
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,741
I just, I have a ridiculous
amount of studying to do,

115
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,744
and plus I have to get
up early tomorrow, so.

116
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,546
- How is the job going?

117
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,914
- Uh, it sucks.

118
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,550
Overworked, underpaid,
typical stuff.

119
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,384
- [Killian] Bummer.

120
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,385
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,986
- Well, since it
is a work night,

122
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,024
what if I promise to
have you home at 11?

123
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,525
(Lacie laughing)

124
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,427
- You know, I am not some
naive freshman anymore.

125
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,129
That stuff doesn't work on me.

126
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,833
- Okay, well, what if I
told you that we bought

127
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,001
a foam machine and we are
about to break it out.

128
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,270
Not gonna lie, it's
gonna get wild.

129
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,071
(Lacie laughs)

130
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,907
- Um, foam machine, wow.

131
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,976
I would have to say,
good luck with that.

132
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,580
- Hey, did you sign up for this?

133
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:05,384
- No, I wasn't
sure it was for me.

134
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,886
Why?

135
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,421
- Because I signed up
for it earlier this week.

136
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,722
You should totally do it.

137
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,257
A buddy of mine did a
research study like this

138
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,491
a few year ago,

139
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,893
I guess they just had
him play video games

140
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,596
for like five straight days,
and he earned two grand.

141
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,530
Easy money.

142
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,065
- Oh, sounds excruciating.

143
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:19,799
(Killian chuckles)

144
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,967
- I don't know about that.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,602
He was also saying
that when he was there,

146
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:27,840
like 90% of the time they
just, you know, read books or--

147
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,508
- Played video games?
- Or played video games.

148
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,810
(both chuckling)

149
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,545
So technically, you could
get some studying done,

150
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,247
and you could earn a few bucks.

151
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,314
- Yeah, that doesn't sound bad.

152
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,582
- No, not at all.

153
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,351
- But uh, but what
are they testing?

154
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,852
- What do you mean?

155
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,687
- I mean, it doesn't say
what we're signing up for.

156
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,189
- Yeah, I asked
Clint about that too,

157
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,690
and I guess it's
not supposed to.

158
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,359
Something about
knowing what it is

159
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,927
would attract a
certain personality.

160
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,062
This way it keeps it
completely random.

161
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,097
- Completely unbiased.

162
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,231
That makes sense I guess.
- Makes sense, yeah.

163
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,466
(light knocking)

164
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,001
- [Friend] Hey bro,
hit or quit it.

165
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,235
We're out of tequila and the
ladies are getting restless.

166
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,136
Let's go.

167
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,972
- Wow, I am sorry about that.

168
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,074
My friend is kind
of, well, an ass.

169
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,344
- It's okay, go, go,
go, have sex with girls.

170
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,579
(Killian laughs)

171
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:10,216
- No, that's not,
okay, I do have to go.

172
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,550
Am I gonna see you later?

173
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,752
- No, I can't.

174
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,353
But um, but you put
up a good fight.

175
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,856
- Thank you.

176
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,626
Well, if you change your
mind, you know where we'll be.

177
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,128
And you should seriously
think about doing that.

178
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,329
It would be nice to see you

179
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,765
outside of the
dorms for a change.

180
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,199
- Okay, goodnight.

181
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,367
- [Killian] Good night.

182
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,302
- [Lacie] Have fun.

183
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,403
- [Killian] Bye.

184
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,139
(eerie music)

185
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,082
(phone beeping)

186
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,155
(phone ringing)

187
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,024
- [Operator] Thank you for
calling Systems of Science.

188
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,160
Please leave a message
after the beep.

189
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,661
(phone beeps)

190
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,263
- Hi, this is Lacie Donovan.

191
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,799
I found your flyer on my campus,

192
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,667
and I have a few
questions for you.

193
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,637
So, if you could call me
back at your convenience,

194
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,773
my number is 555-7178.

195
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:08,941
Thanks so much, bye.

196
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,017
(phone rings)

197
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,787
Hello?

198
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,222
- [Brian] Lacie Donovan.

199
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,757
- May I ask who's calling?

200
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,425
- [Brian] Yes, my
name is Brian Nelson.

201
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,760
I work for Systems of Science.

202
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,062
You just left us a message.

203
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,864
- Oh yeah, yeah,
yeah, that was me.

204
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,399
- [Brian] Okay, good.

205
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,800
I know this is last minute,

206
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,802
but we're holding evaluations
tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.

207
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,237
Are you interested?

208
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,638
- Yeah, absolutely.

209
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,174
I'm off at work by
then, so that's great.

210
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,009
- [Brian] Excellent.

211
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,410
If you give me
your email address,

212
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,946
we can send you all the
information you're looking for.

213
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,183
- [Lacie] Sure, it's
LacieDonovan@yahoo.com.

214
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,120
- [Brian] Okay, Ms. Donovan,
the email has been sent.

215
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,354
Good luck tomorrow.

216
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,089
- [Lacie] Thank you.

217
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,358
(tense music)

218
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,031
- Right here.

219
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,333
Right.

220
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,437
Good.

221
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,273
Open.

222
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,409
Say ah.

223
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,476
- Ah.

224
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,310
- Ah.

225
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,213
Good.

226
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,048
Uh-huh.

227
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,229
- [Lacie] Ah, it's cold.

228
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,264
- Breathe deeply.

229
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,003
Again.

230
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,341
One more time.

231
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,617
We, uh, need to draw some blood.

232
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:04,023
We'll use this to test your
red and white blood cell count,

233
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,560
cholesterol, liver function,

234
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,929
blood glucose levels, et cetera.

235
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,632
We'll also know if
you've taken any drugs,

236
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,101
legal or otherwise.

237
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,236
- Well, then it's a good thing

238
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,207
I kicked my heroine addiction
a few weeks ago. (giggles)

239
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,542
- Drugs are not a laughing
matter, Ms. Donovan.

240
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,112
- Oh, no, I know.

241
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,984
- Normally an assistant
would do this,

242
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:35,855
but she went home sick.

243
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,088
Hold that.
- Mm-hmm.

244
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,527
- We're done here.

245
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,195
We'll be evaluating your,

246
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,898
your results over
the next few days.

247
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,034
No need to contact us
with any questions.

248
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,704
We'll call you if
you're accepted.

249
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,339
- Okay.

250
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,741
- Uh-huh, good.

251
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:29,575
Oh.

252
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,549
Thank you, Ms. Donovan.

253
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,918
- Thank you.

254
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,529
(light knocking)

255
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,766
- I think we're good.

256
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,403
(slow suspenseful music)

257
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,443
(phone rings)

258
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,380
- I believe we've
got our next group.

259
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,715
- Good.

260
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,250
Very good.

261
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,586
Let's see to it that you don't
fuck it up this time, okay?

262
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,520
- You got it.

263
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,690
Asshole.

264
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,759
(Dr. Detrick laughing)

265
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,028
- [Dr. Detrick] Asshole.

266
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,567
(tense music)

267
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,425
(phone ringing)

268
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:55,761
- [Lacie] Hello.

269
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,062
- [Brian] Lacie Donovan?

270
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,364
- [Lacie] May I
ask who's calling?

271
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,366
- [Brian] This is Brian Nelson
from Systems of Science.

272
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,701
We spoke on the
phone the other day.

273
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,136
- [Lacie] Oh yeah.

274
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,238
- [Brain] Congratulations,
you've been accepted.

275
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,539
We've emailed you the directions

276
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,008
and everything you need to know.

277
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,044
Please be there no later
than 6:00 p.m. tomorrow.

278
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,146
- [Lacie] Okay, thanks.

279
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,319
- Hello.

280
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,754
- [Lacie] Hi, um, I'm
here for the test.

281
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,624
I have this confirmation email.

282
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,458
- Great.

283
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,061
Yes, yes.

284
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,262
How are you today?

285
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,930
Did you have any
trouble finding us?

286
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,465
- Yeah, actually,
I got really lost.

287
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,435
I'm, I don't really come
out this far normally.

288
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,869
- Out here in the
middle of nowhere.

289
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,037
Why would you?

290
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,539
- (chuckles) Good point.

291
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,441
- Okay, let's see here now.

292
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,777
There you are, Ms. Donovan

293
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,447
I'm sure you already
read this in the email,

294
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,082
but I am required to tell you
that there are no cell phones,

295
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,617
laptops, or anything
electronic on the premises.

296
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,519
They tend to interfere
with our equipment.

297
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,253
- Oh yeah, that's okay.

298
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,621
I didn't bring anything anyway.

299
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,589
- [Receptionist] Great.

300
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,291
Lacie, this is nurse Daphne.

301
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,959
She's gonna go ahead and
take you to your room.

302
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,594
- Is she ready to go?

303
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,329
- She's all yours.

304
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,063
All right.

305
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,231
Have a great time, Lacie.

306
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,232
- Thank you so much.
- All right, thank you.

307
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,033
Bye bye.

308
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,478
(scanner beeps)

309
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,326
- Okay, what's with the smile?

310
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,095
- It's nothing.

311
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,296
- [Daphne] Not-uh, you can't

312
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,165
be smiling like
that about nothing.

313
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,368
- Okay, well this is stupid,

314
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,470
but um, when I was a little kid,

315
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,874
I had this pet white
mouse named Daphne.

316
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:22,775
- Oh!

317
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,210
- You know, from Scooby-Doo.

318
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,613
We would just sit outside
and talk for hours.

319
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,814
- Aw, that's cute.

320
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,256
- Yeah, but then she kind
of sort of died tragically

321
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,892
in an eighth grade
science fair experiment.

322
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,260
- [Daphne] Ew.

323
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,097
- It's just that, I
hadn't heard that name

324
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,232
in a really, really long time.

325
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,401
- Well, everything
has to go sometime.

326
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,772
However God sees fit,
that's how I see it.

327
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:54,606
- I guess.

328
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:58,577
Is this it?

329
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,345
- Mm-hmm, this is
where you'll be staying

330
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,281
for the next several days.

331
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,615
- Looks just like home.

332
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,349
(Daphne chuckles)

333
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,384
- I'm sorry to have to do this,

334
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,785
but I need to
check your backpack

335
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,754
for any electronic devices.

336
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,888
It's company policy.

337
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,223
- Oh yeah, that's fine.

338
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:14,893
- [Daphne] All right.

339
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,495
Pockets.

340
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,863
- Uh, I.

341
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,667
(Lacie chuckles)

342
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,669
- All right, well,
thanks for understanding.

343
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:24,736
Go ahead and get settled in.

344
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,405
There are scrubs on your bed.

345
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,841
You should get changed and
then head down to the cafeteria

346
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,008
for a meet and greet.

347
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,977
I believe most everyone
is there already.

348
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,579
It's around the
corner on the left.

349
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,447
- Okay, great,
thank you so much.

350
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,448
- All right.

351
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,721
(slow suspenseful music)

352
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,274
- Hey.

353
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,642
- [Lacie] Oh hey.

354
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,376
- How's it going?

355
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,677
Are we supposed to wait here?

356
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,945
- Oh no.

357
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,682
No, I'm just standing here
watching that bald, funny guy.

358
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,117
But how's it going?

359
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,984
- Awesome, I'm Carter.

360
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,186
- [Lacie] Hey, Lacie.

361
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,520
- Nice to meet you.

362
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,490
This beautiful creature right
here is my fiance, Amanda.

363
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,161
- I want you right here, baby.

364
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,664
- Ah, god, he's
so inappropriate.

365
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,833
It's really nice to meet you.
- Hey, nice to meet you.

366
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,602
- So, let's go man.

367
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,838
- Yeah, let's go,
yeah, let's go.

368
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,740
- Let's go. (chuckles)

369
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,280
- [Jake] Oh, I know this guy.

370
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,183
- What's going on buddy?
- Dude, what was it?

371
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,651
Erectile dysfunction.

372
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,419
- Yeah.
- Yes.

373
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,955
Yes, it's uh, it's Carter.

374
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:23,922
- Got it.

375
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,224
- Yeah, dude, what's up man?

376
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,525
- Jake, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,759
- Cool, man.
- What's going on?

378
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:28,894
- Not much dude.

379
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,028
I'm glad to see you're still
coming to these things, man.

380
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,063
This is um, this is Amanda.

381
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,197
Jake, Amanda.
- Hello.

382
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,899
- This is my fiance.
- Hi.

383
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,801
- Oh, pleasure to meet you.

384
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:36,735
- It works.

385
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,203
- Oh my god.

386
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,672
Look at you, dude, last
time I saw this guy,

387
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,441
they gave us one of
those limp dick pills

388
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,544
that had us hard for
like a month straight.

389
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,979
We were like just
clanging swords.

390
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:47,813
- Not a month.
- Fiance.

391
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:48,614
- Come on.

392
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,982
- He's got Excalibur down there.

393
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,383
- Okay.
- Congrats.

394
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,618
- Thanks.
- Let's sit down.

395
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,785
- Come on, come on.
- Yeah, that was awesome.

396
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,888
Thank you.
- Hey.

397
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,889
- [Killian] Hey, it's
about time you showed up.

398
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,824
- How's it going?

399
00:20:58,857 --> 00:20:59,691
- How you doing?
- Good.

400
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:00,225
How are you?

401
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:01,126
- Good, good.

402
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,394
- [Lacie] Okay.

403
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,162
- Well, look who
decided to show up.

404
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,130
- Hi, Killian, what's up?

405
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,398
- Not much.

406
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,666
So, now you telling me

407
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,035
that you will drive to
some god-forsaken facility

408
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,837
in the middle of
nowhere to see me,

409
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,572
but you won't walk 50
feet down the hall?

410
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,240
Now, what is up with that?

411
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,642
- Well, I'm here now, right.

412
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,344
- Yes, you are, and
I'm glad you are.

413
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,812
Did you get a chance to
meet my buddy, Ty over here?

414
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:21,780
- No.

415
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:22,714
- [Killian] Ty, Lacie.

416
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,449
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

417
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,617
You guys know each other
from school or something?

418
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,886
- Yeah, we live in
the dorms together.

419
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,954
- [Ty] That's cute.

420
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,422
- I'm telling you, she's
always hitting on me,

421
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,623
trying to take me to
the bars and stuff,

422
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,825
and I'm like Lacie,
it's 10 in the morning.

423
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,060
Let it go.

424
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,294
- He's a liar.

425
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,830
- Anyway, Lacie, I'd
like you to meet Keisha.

426
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,365
Keisha, Lacie.

427
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,166
- What's up?

428
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,467
- Nice to meet you.

429
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,902
So, you guys came together?

430
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,207
- What do you mean by that?

431
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,309
Seriously, what do
you mean by that?

432
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,209
Did we come together?

433
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,678
What, because we're black,

434
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,613
we just automatically
just come and go together?

435
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,414
- What?

436
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,682
- You, you speechless right now?

437
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:57,883
I don't understand,
what's going on?

438
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:58,684
- [Lacie] You're serious.

439
00:21:58,717 --> 00:21:59,584
- Yeah, seriously, like yeah.

440
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,752
That's what happened.

441
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,521
Harriet Tubman just
led us on the fucking

442
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:03,889
Underground Railroad here,
to this place right here.

443
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,357
I don't understand
what you mean by that?

444
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,758
Why would you even ask us that?

445
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,659
Seriously.

446
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:08,794
I'm here to make a
buck, just like you.

447
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,494
No, no, don't.

448
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,395
What the fuck is this shit.

449
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,396
Lacie, seriously.

450
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,332
Lacie.

451
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,034
I'm completely fucking with you.

452
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,669
(everyone laughing)

453
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,004
- Oh my god.
- Shit, fuck.

454
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,039
- Oh my god, she's sweating.

455
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,240
Do I look like that type?

456
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,508
Now, I'm really
offended, seriously.

457
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,609
- [Lacie] Fuck you.

458
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,478
- [Ty] You're killing
me sweetheart.

459
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,647
- I'm a really
racist person too.

460
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,749
- No, actually,
Keisha and I just met

461
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,551
like a minute before
you walked in.

462
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,252
- Oh, I'm an idiot,
nice to meet you guys.

463
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,055
- [Ty] No, no, I feel terrible.

464
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,091
- No you don't.

465
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,227
- Hey, hello lady.

466
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,229
Why don't you come
join us, come on.

467
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,097
Come on.

468
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,467
There you go.

469
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,301
- See?
- Hey!

470
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,902
- [Jake] Yay!

471
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,170
- Thanks.
- So, so,

472
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,338
what's your name?

473
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,507
No, no, wait, let me guess.

474
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:57,642
Sarah?

475
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,011
- Noah.

476
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,513
(all laughing)

477
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,082
- You look like a
Kelly kinda, yeah?

478
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,717
- My name's Riley.

479
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,518
- Riley.

480
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,786
She's Korean.

481
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,790
So, Riley, do you come
to these things often?

482
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,926
- So, did they give
you those stupid pills

483
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,928
at the last experiment?

484
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:17,662
- Oh!

485
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,264
- Ow.
- Those pills.

486
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,732
- Listen, listen.

487
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:24,536
I'm just trying to impress
her with my witty personality

488
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,172
and my rugged good looks.

489
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:27,973
(all chuckling)

490
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,074
- It's fine, it's fine.

491
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,943
As a attracted as I am to you,

492
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,013
I found the flyer on my campus,

493
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,382
and I thought it looked
interesting, so I came.

494
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,584
- Uh, where do you go to school?

495
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,820
- I'm studying art at
the Westlake branch.

496
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,523
- Oh, cool, yeah, I'm
at the main campus.

497
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:45,590
- Do you like it?

498
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,260
- Uh, it's okay, it's okay.

499
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,562
I mean, it's, it's
really expensive,

500
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,764
so that's, that's
kind of why I'm here.

501
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,132
- I thought I was
why you are here.

502
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,267
(Lacie chuckling)

503
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,234
- No, I'm not.

504
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,536
Um, yeah.

505
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,770
(all laughing)

506
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,639
No, my mom, my mom is
having a hard time,

507
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,207
so just trying to help her out.

508
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,144
So yeah, do you know
that they're raising

509
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,245
tuition next semester?

510
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,714
- Actually, I didn't.

511
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,184
My parents pay for school and
pretty much everything else.

512
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:17,022
So, I just come to these
things to really piss them off.

513
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,089
- Does it work?

514
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,457
- Fucking yes.

515
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,027
(all laughing)

516
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,997
- Gentlemen, ladies.

517
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,232
I hope everyone is well.

518
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,067
My name is Sanders.

519
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,168
- Dude,

520
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,036
it's fucking Colonel Sanders.
- Before we get started.

521
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:31,603
- Shut up.

522
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,040
- You're here because we're
developing a new medicine

523
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,576
for the military that
will aid our soldiers

524
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,945
in coping with anxiety
on the battlefield.

525
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,112
Now, it's very safe.

526
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:46,017
At most you may feel euphoric,
more anxious, nothing more.

527
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,485
I just want you to
know that you're doing

528
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,855
your country a great
service here today.

529
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:54,025
- Listen, that is so cool
about the soldiers and all.

530
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,727
I mean, I feel you.

531
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,064
But I'm here for the
thousand bucks, man.

532
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,832
(all chuckling)

533
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,000
- Well, don't worry about that.

534
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,736
You'll all be taken
care of in good time.

535
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,304
- Uh, what about dinner?

536
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,841
- Will there be a secret
blend of 11 herbs and spices?

537
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,878
- Salads or like
sides of any sort?

538
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,180
- I understand you're all
hungry from fasting today,

539
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,548
and I apologize for that.

540
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,916
We will be feeding you shortly,

541
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,653
since it's important that you
eat prior to the procedure.

542
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:23,855
- Could have used a better word

543
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,156
than procedure, don't you think?

544
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,625
- Yeah, right.

545
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:27,926
- In fact, a nurse should
be in here any minute

546
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:28,860
with your food.

547
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,295
You can eat in here
or in the rec room,

548
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,097
which is just down the hall.

549
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,868
Remember, what's most important
is everyone relax, have fun.

550
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,070
Before you know it,
you'll all be out of here

551
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,372
a thousand bucks richer.

552
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,407
(all cheering)

553
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,910
I, uh, almost forgot.

554
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,479
The procedure starts
tonight at 8:00 p.m. sharp.

555
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,648
We'll call for you
when we're ready.

556
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,116
Be sure to drink lots of water.

557
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,217
Have a good night.

558
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,085
- Thank you.

559
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,256
- All right, let's eat, yeah.

560
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,824
- [Ty] Let's go.

561
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,644
- You know, this isn't bad.

562
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,780
No, it's not bad at all.

563
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,281
- Are you serious?

564
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,951
This makes me look forward
to my diet of ramen noodles.

565
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:29,854
- Mm, just be glad that they
didn't serve the ravioli.

566
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,057
My man Carter can
back me up on that.

567
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,425
- Yeah.

568
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:34,759
You guys have no idea.

569
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:38,596
It was like a piece of cardboard
with snot wrapped on it

570
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,732
and then tomato paste on top.

571
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,666
- That's gross.

572
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,500
- [Amanda] Oh my god.

573
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:43,702
- No, he's right.

574
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:45,971
He's exactly right.

575
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,506
- Do you know what
snot tastes like?

576
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,276
(all snickering)

577
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,313
- This actually tastes
like my grandma's chicken.

578
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,815
- [Jake] Really?

579
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,117
- Well, that's not saying
too much, she's um,

580
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,454
she's starting to lose it,
if you know what I mean.

581
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:03,922
And she swears she's fine,

582
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,624
but she recently invited
my whole family over

583
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,828
for Easter dinner in
October, mind you.

584
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,733
And she served us cat
food and potato chips.

585
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,670
Now, none of us had the
heart to say anything,

586
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,071
we just kept finding
excuses to get up

587
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,874
and throw the food
in the garbage.

588
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,543
- [Amanda] Oh, that's sad.

589
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,012
- The worst part about it was

590
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,048
that cat's been dead for
years, so it's anybody's guess

591
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,784
how long that food had
been sitting around.

592
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,153
I guess that's why
I'm doing this.

593
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,989
I'm gonna, I'm gonna take the
money that I make from this

594
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,291
and use it to fly her
back to Ireland before,

595
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,328
well before she--

596
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,263
- Before she invites everyone
over for Christmas dinner?

597
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,033
(all laughing)

598
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,168
- What about everybody else?

599
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,904
I mean, what are you guys
gonna do with the money?

600
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,307
- I think I'm gonna
fly home to see my mom.

601
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,077
She's been really lonely
since my dad left, so.

602
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,079
I don't know, I found that

603
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,914
as I get farther and
farther along in school,

604
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,916
I have less time
and less money, so.

605
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,318
Hey Jake, can you
hand me the blanket?

606
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,319
It's kind of cold.

607
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,187
- Yeah.

608
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,492
Yeah, I mean,
dude, I don't know.

609
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,061
I mean, my rent's due,

610
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,031
but I don't know how
I'm gonna pay for it,

611
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,301
considering I'm gonna blow
this money on a giant TV.

612
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,369
- Awesome.

613
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,203
- Nice.

614
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,674
- I cannot wait to
play my Xbox 360

615
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,910
in glorious high definition.

616
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,647
- I'm glad you got your
priorities straight.

617
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,915
- Oh hell yeah.

618
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,249
Shit, I mean, even
if I get evicted,

619
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,285
I can still snuggle
up with that TV.

620
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:44,322
- I like that my fiance
finds this amusing.

621
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:46,825
- Yeah, odd couple.
- Straight priorities too,

622
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,059
apparently.

623
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,727
- What are you guys
gonna be spending,

624
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:50,895
spending your cash on?

625
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,365
- Well, we're saving up for
the wedding and the honeymoon.

626
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,333
- Yeah, we're gonna go to Vegas.

627
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,501
We've never been to Vegas.

628
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,703
Never done the
whole casino thing.

629
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:00,972
So you know, kind
of a one shot deal.

630
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,374
Maybe get Elvis up in there.

631
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,414
- Come on, hey
guys, guys, come on.

632
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,349
There's children around here.

633
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,955
- So, Keisha, what are
your plans with the money?

634
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:22,060
- No disrespect, but you guys
are really willing to risk

635
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,663
your health and
wellbeing for what?

636
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:29,434
A television or a flight home?

637
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,503
To me, that's ridiculous.

638
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,104
I don't know.

639
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,541
- All right, well, what
makes you different?

640
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,646
- Well, four months ago, I got
laid off because of cutbacks

641
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,117
and unemployment ran
out and reality sank in.

642
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,720
This for you guys is a choice.

643
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,055
But me, it's my only option.

644
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,224
- I'm sorry to hear that.

645
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:59,264
- Well, look on the bright
side, at least the food's good.

646
00:29:59,297 --> 00:29:59,831
(all laughing)

647
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,366
- Amen girl.

648
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,200
Amen.

649
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:08,640
- So, um, Ty, I'm sure you
got somewhere else to be

650
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:11,042
besides this lame hospital.

651
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,912
- Well, it's funny
you should ask.

652
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,448
- [Woman] Attention,
attention, it is now 7:50.

653
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,551
Test subjects need to report.

654
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,619
Please get there immediately.

655
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,887
Thank you.

656
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,423
- First procedure, and
then test subjects.

657
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,791
What have you gotten me into?

658
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,226
- (chuckles) A weekend with me.

659
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,329
- Yeah, and six strangers
in a creepy hospital.

660
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,864
How romantic.

661
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:35,500
- We'll probably be great.
- Test subjects, let's go.

662
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,101
- [Carter] I guess.

663
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,571
- Good, 'cause I
don't want to pick up.

664
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,207
(Carter chuckles)

665
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,343
- Hey, I'll meet up with
you guys in a sec, okay.

666
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,590
(eerie music)

667
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:07,198
(heavy breathing)

668
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:11,102
- [Man] Hey, get the
fuck out of here.

669
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,204
(Lacie gasps)
(tense music)

670
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:16,274
- You're not
supposed to be here.

671
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:18,977
- Nice.

672
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,645
- [Lacie] Thank you.

673
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,988
- What did you do out there?

674
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,456
Nurse Ratchet looked mean.

675
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,659
- She has that effect on people.

676
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,394
(Jake laughing)

677
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,997
- I feel embarrassed.

678
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,632
- How dare you.

679
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:41,466
Naughty.

680
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,604
- This is kind of a shady place.

681
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:47,872
- Yeah.

682
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,140
- I like it though.
- Yeah, it's weird.

683
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,241
- You would like it.

684
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,677
- So, what's up with
like the one nail?

685
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,079
- Oh, you know, just a
fashion statement, you know.

686
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:55,980
- Oh.
- What's up

687
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,181
with the head though?

688
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,984
- Well, that's, a total
fashion statement.

689
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,085
- All right.
- Yeah.

690
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:01,753
Shiny.
- It's kind of cute.

691
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:02,987
- And beautiful.

692
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:03,921
- Shave that thing.
- Aerodynamic.

693
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,456
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

694
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,491
- Like that?

695
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:07,492
Like that?

696
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,897
(tense music)

697
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,966
- [Daphne] Amanda,
please come with me.

698
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:19,404
- Um, do I really
have to be first?

699
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,707
- [Daphne] Amanda, you
need to come with me now.

700
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,746
(Amanda sighs)

701
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,115
- Everything will be okay, baby.

702
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,584
It'll be over
before you know it.

703
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,852
- Are you sure?

704
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:35,687
- [Carter] Yeah.

705
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,823
- Do you promise?

706
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:39,624
- [Carter] Yeah.

707
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,260
- Say it.

708
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,363
- I promise, baby.

709
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,102
- Okay.

710
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,371
- [Carter] You good?

711
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,205
- Yeah.

712
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,075
I love you.

713
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,409
- I love you too, baby.

714
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,813
And I'll see you
real soon, okay?

715
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:07,018
- Okay.

716
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,700
(Carter sighs)

717
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,377
- So, a priest and a lawyer
are walking down the street,

718
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,245
they come across
this playground.

719
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,447
The priest turns to the lawyer,

720
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,916
says, hey, you want
to fuck some kids?

721
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,919
The lawyer says sure,
but out of what?

722
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,121
(all chuckle)

723
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,422
Ba dum cha.

724
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:48,359
- You know, you really should
stop doing these tests.

725
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:52,430
They're starting to effect
your intelligence and tact.

726
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,065
- Come on, come
on, that was funny.

727
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,733
- No.
- That was funny.

728
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:56,901
- [Keisha] No, it wasn't.

729
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,202
- All right, all
right, try this one.

730
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,705
So, a guy walks out
of a bathroom naked.

731
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,374
He's got, he's got a
poodle under one arm,

732
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,676
he's got 50 feet of duct
tape under the other.

733
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,681
- [Daphne] Ty, come with me.

734
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,720
- Let's get this shit over with.

735
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:20,691
(somber music)

736
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,669
(clock ticking)

737
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:33,871
- [Daphne] Jake.

738
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:36,574
Riley.

739
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:39,877
Keisha.

740
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,681
Carter.

741
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,231
- Where is everyone?

742
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,733
Shouldn't they be done by now?

743
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,670
- Well, they're probably
just waiting for us

744
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:06,704
back in the rec room.

745
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:08,840
Right?

746
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,742
- I don't know, maybe.

747
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,680
But there's something really
weird about this place.

748
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,015
I saw Sanders wearing
one of those masks.

749
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,584
- What kind of masks?

750
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,086
- The masks you
see in the movies

751
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,555
when something really
bad is about to happen.

752
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,635
- [Daphne] Killian,
please come with me.

753
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:40,471
(Killian sighs)

754
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,341
- [Killian] Hang in there, okay?

755
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,742
You're gonna be all right.

756
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,755
- [Daphne] Lacie,
please come with me.

757
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,996
(suspenseful music)

758
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:55,813
After you.

759
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,052
- Hey, hey.

760
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:01,886
Hey.

761
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:03,821
Let me out.

762
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,124
Hey!

763
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,259
Let me out!

764
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:25,876
Hey!

765
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,413
Please let me out.

766
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:30,982
Please!

767
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,818
Please.

768
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,855
(Lacie whimpering)

769
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,795
- Release the gas.

770
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,000
(gas hissing)

771
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,902
(Lacie panting)

772
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,483
(Lacie coughing)

773
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,874
(Lacie screams)

774
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,543
(Lacie sobbing)

775
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,921
(Lacie panting)

776
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,960
(Lacie screaming)

777
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,830
(Lacie panting)

778
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,673
All right, call in a crew,
let's get outta here.

779
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,076
- All right then,
come and get her.

780
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,679
(slow suspenseful music)

781
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,817
Are you recording?

782
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,651
- Standby.

783
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,653
- Everything's set up correctly?

784
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,388
- Everything is good.

785
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:26,724
- Senator, are you
getting our feed?

786
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,659
- Everything looks
good on my end.

787
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:31,262
I want updates with
each new development.

788
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:32,930
- All right, we are recording.

789
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,934
(camera whirring)

790
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,870
(Amanda gasping)

791
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:45,342
- Carter?

792
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,479
Carter?

793
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,481
(Amanda groans)

794
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:51,482
Carter?

795
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,920
(Amanda sighs)

796
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,622
(door creaks)

797
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,837
(eerie music)

798
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,111
(Carter groaning)

799
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,112
- Hey, baby.

800
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,081
- Hey.

801
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,115
How are you?

802
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,016
- I'm good.

803
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,920
Mm, you smell good.

804
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,189
- I always smell good.

805
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,058
- Yeah.

806
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,305
(Carter sighs)

807
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,107
- [Amanda] I want you inside me.

808
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:52,843
- Now?

809
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:53,944
- Yeah, now.

810
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,079
Take off my shirt.

811
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,048
Come on.

812
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:01,252
(slow suspenseful music)

813
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,564
Take yours off.

814
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:23,841
- Oh, baby.

815
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,623
- Take off my pants.

816
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,526
- You take off my pants.

817
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,229
(both laughing)

818
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,168
(Carter moaning)

819
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,938
(Amanda panting)

820
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:56,807
- Mm.

821
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,526
(both moaning)

822
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,261
Pull my fucking hair.

823
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:21,398
Mm.

824
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,302
Pull it harder.

825
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:28,238
(Carter panting)

826
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,140
Oh!

827
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,711
- Oh fuck.

828
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:34,545
- [Amanda] What's the matter?

829
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,213
- [Carter] Baby.

830
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,915
- Is that my hair?

831
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:40,751
What the fuck?

832
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,320
What's going on?

833
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,322
- Baby, what is going on?

834
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,258
(Amanda panting)
(tense music)

835
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,128
(Amanda groans)

836
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:52,963
Baby.

837
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:58,235
Fuck.

838
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,044
Oh my god.

839
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,347
Oh fuck.

840
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,148
Amanda.

841
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,604
Amanda.

842
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,239
Baby.

843
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,040
Whats' going on?

844
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:52,256
(suspenseful music)

845
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,169
- What's happening to me?

846
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:08,338
Oh.

847
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,208
Oh, Carter.

848
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,344
My hair.

849
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,213
Carter.

850
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,853
(Amanda sobbing)

851
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:28,826
Carter.

852
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:35,466
Carter!

853
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:44,308
- [Carter] Whoa.

854
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,089
(water trickling)

855
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,464
(tense music)

856
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,748
- [Amanda] You did this to me.

857
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:25,749
- What?

858
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,984
(Amanda screams)

859
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:32,022
(Carter screaming)
(dramatic music)

860
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:41,098
(suspenseful music)

861
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,367
(Lacie gasps)

862
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,036
(Lacie panting)

863
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:38,956
- Hello?

864
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:40,991
Hello?

865
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:49,666
Hello?

866
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:59,142
(clock ticking)

867
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:28,538
Hello?

868
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:39,349
Hello?

869
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,087
Is anyone there?

870
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:48,492
Hello?

871
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:52,529
Seriously guys,
this isn't funny.

872
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:55,999
- Lacie.
- Hey.

873
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,234
- What's with all the yelling?

874
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,636
- No one is here,
Killian, everyone is gone.

875
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,171
- [Killian] Wait, what do
you mean no one's here?

876
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:03,607
- I, I can't find any of
the doctors or nurses,

877
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,375
and every single door
I checked is locked.

878
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:08,312
I just--
- Well, it's still early.

879
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,314
- No, that's the thing.

880
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,382
There's one clock that
says it's like 11:15

881
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,084
and another one that
says it's like four.

882
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,252
- Okay, okay, okay, calm down.

883
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,321
There's got to be a good
explanation for this.

884
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,256
Let's um, let's just look around

885
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,459
and see if we can find anyone
else who's awake, okay?

886
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:24,895
- Okay.

887
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,530
- [Killian] Okay.

888
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:41,545
- What time is it?

889
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:42,646
- I'm sorry to wake you.

890
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,621
- [Lacie] Hey Riley, I'm
sorry to wake you up, but.

891
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,689
- Just bear with us.

892
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,525
Lacie seems to think that
there's something wrong.

893
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,660
- We can't find anyone.

894
00:49:56,693 --> 00:50:00,630
Kind of weird, so, do you
want to just meet me outside?

895
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,965
- Now?

896
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,667
- Yeah, now.

897
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,968
- Like right now?

898
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,169
- Would you mind?

899
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:08,238
- Sure, just give
me a minute, okay.

900
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,840
- Okay, thanks.
- I'll be right out.

901
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,475
- [Killian] Okay.

902
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,178
- See you outside.

903
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:17,514
- Okay.
- Thanks.

904
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,396
Anything?

905
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:33,830
- No.

906
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,599
- [Lacie] Told you.

907
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,608
- Jesus Christ, I'm so
freaking tired right now.

908
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:45,475
- Me too.

909
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:47,878
- So, what's going
on, why are we here?

910
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,613
Why we up so early?

911
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:50,947
- There's no one here.

912
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,949
Everybody is gone.

913
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,284
- What's she talking about?

914
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,385
- Well, what Lacie
is trying to say

915
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,987
is that none of us
can seem to find

916
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,388
any of the doctors or nurses

917
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:01,992
and she's, well, we're
all a little concerned.

918
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,460
That's all.

919
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,561
- No, no, no, no.

920
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:07,397
What I'm saying is that
something is very wrong here.

921
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,165
- Seriously?

922
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,467
That's what you woke us up for?

923
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:12,736
I'm going back to bed.

924
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:13,370
- [Killian] Ty, just hang on.

925
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,604
- No, you don't get it.

926
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:15,705
There is nobody here.

927
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,607
There is no way out.

928
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:18,675
Everyone is gone.

929
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,410
All the doors are locked.

930
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:23,747
- So then, where's
the honeymooners?

931
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,414
- I checked their rooms.

932
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,149
We don't know where they are.

933
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,918
- Probably just fucking
on some gurney somewhere.

934
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:29,186
(Ty groans)

935
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:30,120
I'm sorry, they're
probably making love

936
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,421
on some gurney somewhere.

937
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,757
- Or they're probably
having breakfast

938
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,492
with the doctors and nurses.

939
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,260
- No, no, you guys,
I'm telling you--

940
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:38,995
- But since we're all up,

941
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,364
we might as well go
look for them, okay?

942
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:45,202
So, you three go that way,
and we'll go this way,

943
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,471
and we're bound to run into 'em.

944
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:48,438
Good?

945
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:49,906
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

946
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,609
(tense music)

947
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:01,418
Carter.

948
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:03,720
Amanda.

949
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,290
It is awfully quiet.

950
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:08,792
I mean, someone
should be here, right?

951
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:09,726
- See, I told you.

952
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:11,761
- You know, this reminds me.

953
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,930
I was doing one of these
a couple of years ago.

954
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:17,000
Couldn't find this
guy for like two days.

955
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,134
- Seriously?

956
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:19,503
- Yeah, yeah.

957
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,671
It ended up, he was
underneath his bed,

958
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:25,208
like just paralyzed,
locked with fear.

959
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,843
Essentially, the guy
was having nightmares,

960
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,044
but he was like fully awake.

961
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:30,413
- What the fuck were
you guys testing?

962
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,816
- Let's just say it's a drink

963
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,117
that gives you a lot of energy.

964
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,051
- Really?

965
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:35,919
- Yeah.
- Which one?

966
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,622
- A very popular one.

967
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:43,660
- What is that?

968
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,231
(slow suspenseful music)

969
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,744
What the?

970
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,781
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude, dude,

971
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:05,949
you don't, you don't
want to go in there.

972
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,551
- Well, what if they're hurt?

973
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:09,819
All right, what if
they need our help?

974
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,854
- After you.

975
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:21,431
Whoa, whoa, Lacie,
Lacie, whoa, don't.

976
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,567
Shit.

977
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,709
- Oh.

978
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:33,743
Carter.

979
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,581
Amanda, is anyone in here?

980
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:38,415
- Oh god!

981
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,284
- [Killian] Lacie.

982
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:51,027
(Carter gasping)

983
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,772
(Carter screaming)

984
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,476
(Jake retching)

985
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:20,924
- Carter.

986
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:23,760
(Carter growling)

987
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:26,896
(Jake panting)

988
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,964
Dude, we gotta go.

989
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:28,898
- What is it?
- We gotta go.

990
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:29,833
- We gotta fucking go, dude.

991
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:30,900
- What is it?

992
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:31,701
What did you see?

993
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:32,836
- It's Carter!

994
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:36,272
It's fucking Carter in
there, man, but, but it's,

995
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:38,174
but it's, it's not him.

996
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,809
It's no, no, no.

997
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:41,077
Don't, don't go in there.

998
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,280
Okay, okay.

999
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,715
Trust me on this, okay?

1000
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,717
Let's just find everyone,
we'll just get out.

1001
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:48,418
- Okay.
- Okay?

1002
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,219
- Okay, okay.
- Okay?

1003
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:50,320
Come on, come on!

1004
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:51,354
- Come on.

1005
00:54:59,062 --> 00:54:59,896
- [Jake] Go, go, go.

1006
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,398
Go, go, go!

1007
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,232
No time to explain, we gotta
get the hell out of here.

1008
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:03,833
Let's go, let's go.

1009
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:04,834
Go, go.

1010
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,871
(suspenseful music)

1011
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,775
- Damn it, damn it.

1012
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,410
You need the security
card to get in.

1013
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,311
- [Killian] Okay, let me try.

1014
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:17,647
(Killian groaning)

1015
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:18,581
Shit.

1016
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:19,716
- Okay, um, well,
what about the stairs.

1017
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,951
- We tried them all,
they're all locked.

1018
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,453
- Will someone care to tell me

1019
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,255
why the hell are we running?

1020
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:26,556
And what exactly is going on?

1021
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:27,824
- Carter's dead, man.

1022
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:29,826
- [Keisha] What about Amanda?

1023
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,961
- He's fucking, Carter is
fucking dead, did you hear me?

1024
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,664
Fucking, someone tore him
apart and left him for dead.

1025
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:38,535
I don't know, he was,
he was still alive.

1026
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:42,072
I saw him, but I don't
know exactly what I saw.

1027
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,139
- What about Amanda?

1028
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,674
- We don't know.

1029
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,176
Look, there's got to be a
phone or something, right?

1030
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:47,243
- We tried them all.

1031
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,078
They're all dead.

1032
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,413
(Jake panting)

1033
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,348
- This is just fucking great.

1034
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,617
This is great, we're trapped
in here with no way out.

1035
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:55,885
Everyone's gone except for us.

1036
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:57,854
None of the phones work.

1037
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:58,955
And Carter's dead.

1038
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:01,758
You know what this is?

1039
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:05,061
This is fucked, man, this
is completely fucked!

1040
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,429
- Calm down, all right?

1041
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:07,931
There's gotta be
another way out of here.

1042
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:08,965
- Really?

1043
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,901
- I got a phone.

1044
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,704
- You mean like a cellphone?

1045
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,806
- Yeah, I snuck
it in when I came.

1046
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,441
- Why didn't you say so?
- Can we go?

1047
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:19,375
- Go, go, go!
- Go!

1048
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,111
- Go, go!
- Don't stop!

1049
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,282
- You guys hungry at all?

1050
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,617
'Cause I am starving.

1051
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,954
I'm thinking pizza,
maybe some peperoni.

1052
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,559
Or we could do vegetarian
if that's your thing.

1053
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:39,963
- Bring up camera
12, and 17 over here.

1054
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:40,797
- Fine.

1055
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:46,302
Just, I've got a very high
metabol, you know what, fuck it.

1056
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:47,604
You don't give a shit.

1057
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,875
- Hold on, I'm gonna go get it.

1058
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,577
(Riley panting)

1059
00:56:57,213 --> 00:57:00,617
(Ty and Lacie panting)

1060
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,120
(tense music)

1061
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:07,123
- Guys.

1062
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:10,927
Is that Amanda?

1063
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:15,632
- Amanda, is that you?

1064
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,469
I got a bad feeling about this.

1065
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,038
- What is she
standing there for?

1066
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:22,939
- I got it.

1067
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,009
- [Ty] Keisha, Keisha, run.

1068
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:29,579
Run, Run!
(Keisha screams)

1069
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,549
(dramatic music)

1070
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,625
- [Ty] Hey, hey, don't,
what are you doing, man?

1071
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:43,693
We gotta get her.

1072
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:44,627
- It's too late, man.
- No, no!

1073
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:45,995
- It's too late,
there's no time!

1074
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,330
- What the fuck are you doing?
- This shit ain't over, man.

1075
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,264
- Come on.
- It's locked.

1076
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,899
It's too late, it's too late.

1077
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:52,302
- [Thank you] Are you kidding
me, man, listen to her.

1078
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:55,171
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1079
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,039
Come on.

1080
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:57,607
(tense music)

1081
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,275
- [Killian] Oh shit.

1082
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,681
(all panting)

1083
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:07,517
Oh shit.

1084
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:12,755
- What the fuck, man,
we could have saved her.

1085
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:13,990
- Ty, it was too
great a risk, man.

1086
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,625
There's nothing we
could have done.

1087
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,893
- You mean there's nothing
you could have done.

1088
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:18,161
- Ty, you need to
calm down, right.

1089
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:19,162
This isn't gonna help anything.

1090
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,063
This isn't gonna
change anything.

1091
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:21,164
- Let me tell you something.

1092
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:24,267
This thing between you
and me, it ain't over.

1093
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,003
(dramatic music)

1094
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:42,018
- Shouldn't have brought
your cell phone, huh?

1095
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,024
(phone ringing)

1096
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:48,858
Guys.

1097
00:58:49,525 --> 00:58:50,760
- Pick it up.

1098
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,031
- Here it is.

1099
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,403
- Progress report, gentlemen.

1100
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:02,639
Are we ready to execute or not?

1101
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,842
- No sir, but we have made
quite a bit of progress.

1102
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,810
The subjects are still
exhibiting various symptoms

1103
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:10,413
such as trouble
breathing, hair loss,

1104
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,148
and bleeding from
various orifices.

1105
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,650
But the good news is

1106
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:15,952
that the chemical is taking
effect much more rapidly.

1107
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,021
We also believe
that we do in fact

1108
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,390
have a fully functional
counter agent.

1109
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:21,658
- How so?

1110
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:22,859
- We inoculated
two of the subjects

1111
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,727
prior to being
exposed to the gas.

1112
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:27,397
So far, both subjects
are symptom free.

1113
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,165
- And they're both still alive?

1114
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,734
- Not exactly.

1115
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:35,138
One of them has unfortunately
expired sooner than we hoped.

1116
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:39,776
- If you had kept them
isolated like I suggested,

1117
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:41,945
we wouldn't be talking about
this issue right now, would we?

1118
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,082
- Sir.
- It's, it's important

1119
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:48,751
that the subjects
remained together.

1120
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:51,654
Physical interaction and
conversion are important

1121
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:54,090
and necessary,
keeping the mind busy.

1122
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:57,060
If we separate them, we
risk the possibility--

1123
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,494
- Dr. Detrick, yes.

1124
00:59:58,528 --> 00:59:59,862
Yes, how long
before you're ready

1125
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:02,198
to start manufacturing
the agent?

1126
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:04,734
- We're certainly close, sir.

1127
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:09,172
Could be ready within
a matter of weeks.

1128
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,374
- I beg your pardon,
did you say could?

1129
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:15,211
- Will, (chuckles) will.

1130
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:16,279
It will be ready, sir.

1131
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:19,148
- Good.

1132
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:22,352
(slow suspenseful music)

1133
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:26,990
- Christ sake.

1134
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,061
- I don't know if
that thing was Amanda,

1135
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,163
but whatever it is
might come back.

1136
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,434
- The barricade's solid.

1137
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,669
Nothing's getting in.

1138
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,272
- I don't suppose that
gate opens, does it?

1139
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,540
- No, I already checked.

1140
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:45,375
You need a key.

1141
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,246
How are you holding up, baby?

1142
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,217
- Why are they doing this to us?

1143
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,186
(suspenseful music)

1144
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,014
- Uh-huh.

1145
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:27,483
No, no, there's no way, man.

1146
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,019
That thing was
moving way too fast.

1147
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:32,955
I mean, this must be something
completely different.

1148
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,257
- Brilliant insight, Jake.

1149
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,992
Okay, now that we're clear
on what actually constitutes

1150
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,527
as a zombie, we need to--

1151
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,196
- Do you guys think that we're
gonna turn into those things?

1152
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:44,333
I mean, seriously you
guys, what was in that gas?

1153
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,904
- Look, I think we need
to stop hypothesizing

1154
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:51,007
and actually start to
think of some kind of plan.

1155
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,309
- Hey, check out those cameras.

1156
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:58,181
They, mm-mm, they
weren't here before,

1157
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,183
which means someone's
watching us.

1158
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,617
Hello.

1159
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:02,418
Hello.

1160
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,089
We need some help please.

1161
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:06,889
Hello?

1162
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:09,926
- Will you please

1163
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,962
turn that off.
- We need help, someone.

1164
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,467
(suspenseful music)

1165
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:20,303
Fuck it.

1166
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,745
(static buzzing)

1167
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:30,780
- Uh-oh.

1168
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:34,183
- I thought you said
they were shatter proof.

1169
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:35,551
- Hopefully, it's
still under warranty

1170
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,752
because I'm pretty sure

1171
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,621
we don't have the
extended service plan.

1172
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,756
- This isn't the time.

1173
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,258
I don't know how, but fix it.

1174
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:44,360
Do we have another
camera in that room?

1175
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:47,296
- Of course, it's coming
up right now, Jesus.

1176
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:50,333
And there it is.

1177
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:59,041
(Sanders sighs)

1178
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,677
- [Killian] What are you doing?

1179
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:03,579
- You know what,
if they want us,

1180
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,114
they can come and get us.

1181
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:08,518
I don't know about you, but
I am not going to die here.

1182
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:09,585
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1183
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,520
You all right, you all right?

1184
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:11,821
- Yeah.
- You okay?

1185
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:12,822
- Yeah, yeah.

1186
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:15,391
It must have been
the chicken, right?

1187
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:17,160
(Ty coughing)

1188
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:18,394
- Should one of us
go check on him?

1189
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:19,328
- He's fine.

1190
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,498
- Listen, I think Ty's gone
off the reservation, man.

1191
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,500
- I can hear you, asshole.

1192
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:30,139
Okay hotshot, you got
us locked in this room.

1193
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:31,374
What next?

1194
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:32,408
Huh?

1195
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,144
Tell me there's something
more to all this.

1196
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,346
Tell us all what the
fuck you plan to do

1197
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,948
if that thing comes back.

1198
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:39,849
- I don't know.
- What?

1199
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:41,117
- [Killian] I said I don't know.

1200
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,286
- Hey, I don't see you
coming up with a better idea.

1201
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,188
Okay, so while you sit
over there in the corner,

1202
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,190
at least he is doing something.

1203
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,424
Killian's gotten us this far,

1204
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:51,194
so if you don't have
anything constructive to say,

1205
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:53,029
then why don't
you just back off.

1206
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,966
(Jake snickers)

1207
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,535
- You got something you
want to say, funny man?

1208
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:00,403
- No, no.

1209
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:05,408
- That's what I thought.

1210
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,449
- Check out the balls on Lacie.

1211
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:14,951
- Shut up, Jake.

1212
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,953
- Guys, guys, seriously,
we need a legitimate plan.

1213
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:21,924
- Sooner or later,

1214
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,926
someone's gonna come
looking for us, right?

1215
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,061
As long as that
thing's out there

1216
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,696
and we're in here, we're safe.

1217
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:28,130
All right, so let's
just sit tight,

1218
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,699
relax, wait this thing out.

1219
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:30,933
- No way.

1220
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,101
What about food?

1221
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:33,936
Or going to the bathroom?

1222
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,205
I mean, you guys, it feels
like I haven't eaten in days.

1223
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,075
- Yeah, I mean, for all we
know it could have been days.

1224
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,416
- Maybe we should try to
get Keisha's cellphone.

1225
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:50,319
- That's a good idea.

1226
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:52,221
Yeah.

1227
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,223
Yeah, we'll just go out
in the hallway there.

1228
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:55,925
We'll hang out with
whatever that thing is.

1229
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:56,859
You know, it's
probably just waiting

1230
01:04:56,892 --> 01:04:58,427
around the corner for us.

1231
01:04:58,461 --> 01:04:59,562
- It was just an idea.

1232
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:01,030
- No, I think it's worth a shot.

1233
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,231
I mean, we can't
stay here forever.

1234
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:05,201
- You know what, my ass
is staying right here.

1235
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,702
- That's very
noble of you, Jake.

1236
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:10,139
- You know, chivalry died
with women's lib, all right?

1237
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:11,974
I'm all for equal
rights, ladies.

1238
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:13,943
- I can do it.

1239
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:16,412
Seriously, I'm the
smallest one here.

1240
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:18,147
You guys can move the vending
machine a couple of inches.

1241
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,883
I'll squeeze through, I'll
get the phone, and we're done.

1242
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:22,451
- You're serious?

1243
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:23,286
- Yeah.

1244
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,988
- You sure you want to do this?

1245
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,490
- Yes, I'm sure.

1246
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:29,592
Let's go.

1247
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:31,661
Come on.

1248
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:32,662
- Okay, okay.

1249
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:34,430
Let's do this.

1250
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:37,933
Ready?

1251
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,904
On the count of three,
one, two, three.

1252
01:05:41,937 --> 01:05:45,508
(slow suspenseful music)

1253
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,828
(dramatic music)

1254
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:08,664
(Riley screaming)

1255
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,002
(Riley panting)

1256
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:15,137
- [Riley] I got it.

1257
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,539
- Does it work?

1258
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:17,973
- Yeah.

1259
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:19,608
Oh shit.

1260
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,509
- What?

1261
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,878
- There's no signal.

1262
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:23,713
(phone beeping)

1263
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,348
Hey.

1264
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:26,182
- Fucking

1265
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,085
bullshit.

1266
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,060
Excellent idea.

1267
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:41,997
- Get it off my hands,
get it off my hands.

1268
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:43,299
Get this shit off my
hands, get it off my hands.

1269
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,000
Get it, no, no, I need to
get this off right now.

1270
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:47,370
You don't understand, no,
no, get this off of me!

1271
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:49,505
- Calm down, calm down,
breathe, breathe, breathe.

1272
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,207
Just breathe, just
breathe, all right.

1273
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,076
Just breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe, okay?

1274
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:56,545
- We need to face reality

1275
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:58,547
and assume that no
one is coming for us.

1276
01:06:58,581 --> 01:06:59,281
- You don't know that.

1277
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,449
- Jake.

1278
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,651
Jake, think about the people
who are operating this, okay?

1279
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,386
They kidnapped us.

1280
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:05,187
They held us against our will.

1281
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:07,189
Okay, they pumped us
full of god knows what.

1282
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:08,557
They have everything to loose,

1283
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,059
so they're going to do whatever
it takes to keep us here.

1284
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:11,026
We can't just wait around here.

1285
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,628
We need to find a way out.

1286
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,364
- What do you propose we do?

1287
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:16,098
Huh?

1288
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,500
Walk out the front door?

1289
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,535
- Okay, we're on the top floor.

1290
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:20,536
We can't go down,

1291
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,205
so we need to find a
way to the roof, okay?

1292
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:25,641
And then from there, we
can see if we get a signal.

1293
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:26,876
- Or use the fire escape.

1294
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,110
- If there is one.

1295
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:29,612
- [Killian] Right,
if there is one.

1296
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:30,513
- The roof is our best bet.

1297
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,148
Do, do you agree?

1298
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:33,582
- Yeah, I think
that's our best option

1299
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:34,817
given the circumstances.

1300
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:36,719
Riley?

1301
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:37,853
- Yeah, I agree.

1302
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:41,190
- All right, and how do you
propose we get to the roof?

1303
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,926
(tense music)

1304
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:45,694
- What about the air ducts?

1305
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:46,896
- [Jake] What?

1306
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:47,863
- You know what, she's right.

1307
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,298
In buildings like this,

1308
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:50,933
the air conditioning units
usually are located on the roof.

1309
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:52,134
- Okay, okay.

1310
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:53,402
Okay, so we find a
way to the air ducts

1311
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,371
and then, and then
we get to the roof.

1312
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,238
Right?

1313
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:57,406
- You think it'll work?

1314
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,641
- The air ducts
should be big enough.

1315
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:00,309
- There's an air
duct in the rec room.

1316
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:01,677
- [Killian] Okay, are
you sure about that?

1317
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:02,645
- Yeah, absolutely.

1318
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:04,513
- All right.

1319
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:05,714
Then we make our
way to the rec room.

1320
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,783
We use the air duct,
and we should be golden.

1321
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:08,617
- Listen, I,

1322
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:12,354
I hate to be Debbie
Downer on this, all right,

1323
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:15,424
but you guys remember that
thing's still out there.

1324
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,894
- [Ty] Even if we make it
to the roof, what then?

1325
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,529
- You know what Ty,

1326
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:22,765
you contributed exactly
two things today.

1327
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:24,300
Jack and shit.

1328
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:25,534
So, here's your chance pal.

1329
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:27,770
We're all listening,
we're all here.

1330
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,138
Enlighten us.

1331
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:32,608
(Ty retching)

1332
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:35,911
- Fuck.

1333
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,546
It's throwing me.

1334
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:38,981
- Dude, I don't
think that's normal.

1335
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:39,849
- Ty.

1336
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:42,151
- Run.

1337
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:43,319
- Shit!
- Ty!

1338
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:44,587
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Run!

1339
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,156
(Lacie screaming)

1340
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:48,991
- [Killian] Go, go, go, go, go!

1341
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:54,196
(Killian and Ty grunting)
(dramatic music)

1342
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:01,670
(glass clattering)

1343
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:09,345
(Killian groaning)

1344
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:13,782
- God.

1345
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:16,785
- No.
- No!

1346
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:17,386
- No!
- I have to go back.

1347
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:19,488
- He's gone, he's gone.

1348
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:27,096
(Ty pants)

1349
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:29,064
(Riley screams)

1350
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:30,966
(Ty panting)

1351
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,971
(Ty grunts)
(dramatic music)

1352
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:48,350
(Jake screaming)

1353
01:09:57,826 --> 01:09:59,094
- [Ty] Where are you?

1354
01:09:59,128 --> 01:09:59,995
Huh?

1355
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,866
(all panting)

1356
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:10,873
- Okay.

1357
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,310
I think we're good, come on.

1358
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:16,579
- Guys, guys, guys, guys.

1359
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,114
Look where we're at.

1360
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,783
- It's the waiting room.

1361
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:21,817
- Jake, no.
- Yeah.

1362
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,222
Yeah, we gotta at least look.

1363
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:27,556
- No, no, that's
a horrible idea.

1364
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:28,924
- What?
- No, no, no, come on.

1365
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,759
Come on.
- Jake.

1366
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:31,727
- [Jake] Come on.

1367
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,828
- [Lacie] Goddammit.

1368
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:34,830
- [Riley] I don't understand
what's going on you guys.

1369
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,371
- I hope I didn't
miss anything tasty.

1370
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,745
Now, this is interesting.

1371
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:54,350
(slow suspenseful music)

1372
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:04,660
(glass clattering)

1373
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:08,731
- So, they were watching
us this whole time.

1374
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,432
How did you know that
they would be watching?

1375
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:12,234
- Well, I've been doing
enough of these things

1376
01:11:12,267 --> 01:11:14,703
to know that there is
always someone watching.

1377
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:17,973
Maybe now I can
get some answers.

1378
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:18,807
Come on.

1379
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:25,881
(slow suspenseful music)

1380
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:26,715
Come on.

1381
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:35,858
Okay.

1382
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:03,352
There's not a goddamned thing.

1383
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:05,854
I thought we'd find
something, anything.

1384
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:06,755
It's nothing.

1385
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:08,357
- It's okay, it's
not a big deal.

1386
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:10,793
We just start it--
- No, no, no, it's not okay.

1387
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:13,495
We may be turning into one
of those things out there

1388
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:14,697
that's chasing us.

1389
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,166
I say we're anything but okay.

1390
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,567
- Jake, calm down.

1391
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,152
- I'm sorry.

1392
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,056
- It's fine, it's just
you're not the only one

1393
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,524
who's dealing with this.

1394
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:45,928
We all are, so let's
stick together.

1395
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:49,064
- You're right.

1396
01:12:52,367 --> 01:12:53,602
You're right.

1397
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:57,539
- Okay.

1398
01:12:57,573 --> 01:12:59,274
Okay, the important
thing is we keep moving,

1399
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:01,276
so let's, let's
get to the rec room

1400
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,846
and just get the fuck
out of here, okay?

1401
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,314
- Okay.

1402
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:06,115
Okay.

1403
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:23,665
(dramatic music)
(Ty panting)

1404
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:44,019
- Should I call
in a cleanup crew?

1405
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:45,487
- Put 'em on standby.

1406
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:48,090
Let 'em know we'll
need 'em soon.

1407
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:49,224
You take care of their cars yet?

1408
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,058
- All good.

1409
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:53,495
- How we doing otherwise,
anything else to report?

1410
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:56,965
- You missed it, they
broke into the lab.

1411
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,000
- Really?

1412
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:58,934
- See for yourself.

1413
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:09,778
- It's over there.

1414
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:12,514
- Uh, I'll find something
to block the door.

1415
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:13,949
Get this vent off.

1416
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:18,220
(grate clanging)

1417
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:21,857
(slow suspenseful music)

1418
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:32,100
I think we're okay.

1419
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,635
Okay, all right?

1420
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,038
All right, you ready?

1421
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:37,005
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1422
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,975
(Lacie grunting)

1423
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:44,046
(Lacie panting)

1424
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:51,086
(Lacie coughing)

1425
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:55,057
Okay, come on.

1426
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:55,991
- Wait, what about you?

1427
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:57,025
- Don't worry, I'll
be right behind you,

1428
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:57,793
don't worry about me.

1429
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:02,564
Go, go.
(Riley screams)

1430
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:04,099
(dramatic music)

1431
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:06,535
(Ty panting)

1432
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:15,043
Shit.

1433
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:17,613
(Ty screaming)

1434
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:25,954
- Not so funny now, are you?

1435
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:30,692
(Ty grunting)

1436
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,031
- Where?

1437
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,532
- Right there.

1438
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:40,469
(tense music)

1439
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,004
- As I was saying Colonel,

1440
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,240
I expect a full report on my
desk at the end of the week.

1441
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:46,441
Anything else?

1442
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:48,410
- Cleanup crew will
be here shortly.

1443
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:50,412
We're about ready to wrap it up.

1444
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:52,147
- Perfect.

1445
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,749
I'll handle the local press.

1446
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:55,884
Our cover story runs
day after tomorrow.

1447
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:58,020
- We'll be long gone by then.

1448
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:00,289
- Excellent, gentlemen,
you've done your country

1449
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:01,690
a great service today.

1450
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:03,191
- [Sanders] Thank you, sir.

1451
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:10,299
(dramatic music)
(Jake panting)

1452
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:15,237
(Ty grunts)
(Jake groaning)

1453
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:21,910
(Jake panting)

1454
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:26,048
(Ty grunting)

1455
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:35,057
(Jake groans)

1456
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:39,995
(Riley screams)

1457
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:42,297
(Ty groaning)

1458
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,170
(suspenseful music)

1459
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:11,026
(Jake coughing)

1460
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:18,367
(Riley coughing)

1461
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:22,037
- Hey, you okay?

1462
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:26,708
(dramatic music)

1463
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:29,311
(Riley groans)

1464
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:43,025
- Jake?

1465
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:44,893
Riley?

1466
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:48,263
Where are you?

1467
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:51,233
(suspenseful music)

1468
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:55,370
Help.

1469
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:57,806
Help!

1470
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:00,442
Damn it.

1471
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,958
(engine rumbling)

1472
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,261
- [Soldier] Go!

1473
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:26,234
- Help!

1474
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:28,970
Help!

1475
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:38,313
Jake.

1476
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:45,353
(gun fires)

1477
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,856
- Do you understand
that time is an issue?

1478
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:23,024
That we're under contract
to deliver this weapon

1479
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:25,026
and that, and that the results

1480
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,395
are far from what
the Senator wants?

1481
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,097
- Would you stop worrying?

1482
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:31,867
We have plenty of time,
despite what he thinks.

1483
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:34,136
Now, don't give me that look.

1484
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:36,271
This is a small price
to pay for progress.

1485
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:37,572
- Really?

1486
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,474
- We're doing a good thing,
and when we're done here,

1487
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:42,410
an American casualty will
be a thing of the past.

1488
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,279
No more taking an enemy head on.

1489
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:46,615
We'll release this gas
on whomever we want

1490
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,216
and simply let them
kill themselves.

1491
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:52,087
No virus, no hole in the ground,
no connection to the U.S.

1492
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,955
- Do you really believe that?

1493
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:55,457
- [Sanders] I sleep quite
well at night, my friend.

1494
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,292
- Well, I don't.

1495
01:19:58,193 --> 01:19:59,261
- Tough.

1496
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:00,996
'Cause we're not done
till we have a weapon

1497
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:03,431
that leaves no visible symptoms.

1498
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:23,485
(Lacie grunts)

1499
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:36,398
(soldier screaming)

1500
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,336
(gun firing)

1501
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:44,206
What the fuck is
going on out there?

1502
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:48,009
- [Soldier] We have
a man down, man down.

1503
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,160
(gun firing)

1504
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,403
(gun fires)

1505
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:09,257
- We need to be more careful.

1506
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,126
Things are getting
out of control.

1507
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:13,328
- Are you kidding?

1508
01:22:14,796 --> 01:22:16,498
This was nothing.

1509
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:20,835
You're lucky you weren't around

1510
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,437
when we were developing AIDS.

1511
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:26,541
Our initial results were
ungodly to say the least.

1512
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:46,594
(soldier groaning)

1513
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,003
(gun firing)

1514
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:04,612
(tense music)

1515
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:10,652
- South wing clear,
moving forward.

1516
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:13,221
(somber music)

1517
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,456
(fire crackling)

1518
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:53,288
(tense music)

1519
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,615
- [Sanders] You about done?

1520
01:25:20,648 --> 01:25:21,716
- Just finished.

1521
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,885
- [Sanders] Good, the truck's
loaded and ready to go.

1522
01:25:26,054 --> 01:25:29,524
(slow suspenseful music)

1523
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:32,393
- Mr. Vice President,
everything went as planned.

1524
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:34,562
Yes, sir.

1525
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:39,801
We are almost ready to
launch a live field test.

1526
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:40,802
Yes, sir.

1527
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:44,472
No, no, no, thank you, sir.

1528
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,864
(suspenseful music)

1529
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:55,336
(dramatic music)

1530
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,809
(somber music)

1531
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,475
(tense music)

1532
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:12,033
(MultiCom Jingle)
