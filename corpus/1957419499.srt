00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,352
I don't like she-males.

211
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:24,323
 I find you people so
 gross and disgusting.

212
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:28,360
 I get no comfort from
 having a muscular,

213

  You think I wanted to shove
  that cucumber up my ass?

223
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:17,809
 Did you think I wasn't
 going to see it?

224
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:19,945
How did that work in your mind?

225
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:21,747
 Did you think I
 wasn't going to notice

226
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:25,350
 you have a large
 plant taped to your...

227
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,654
   Oh my God, oh my.

228
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,023
  I feel so violated.

229
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:35,527
  - Mr. Barney

230
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:38,463
   Did you ever have a dream?

231
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,000
A most sensational inspirational
celebrational dream?

232
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:45,671
  - Excuse me?

233
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:48,507
 - I just did this so
 I could be with Gerry.

234
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:51,376
 I didn't want you to
 get all mad and stuff.

235
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:54,646
   - I'm not mad, I'm just...

236
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:59,351
  Crap, I don't know.

237
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,455
So, who's this Gerry
guy, is that your pimp?

238
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:04,756
- Pimp?

239
00:13:04,823 --> 00:13:07,726
   No, he's just the one
   that told me to dress like

240
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:10,562
 a closet transvestite
 prostitute.

241
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:13,899
- Oh. So he's your pimp.

242
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:16,935
  - No, he's my daddy.

243
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:20,105
   - So what else does your
   daddy pimp want you to do?

244
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:21,940
   - He's made me
   write love letters

245
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:23,742
 to a serial killer in prison.

246
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:24,810
- Oh, which one?

247
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:25,811
   - Folsom.

248
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:27,813
  - No, which killer?

249
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,481
- Kenny Kingman.

250
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:33,719
 - The Lollypop Killer,
 oh, he's bad news.

251
00:13:33,785 --> 00:13:36,054
 So you're in love
 with a serial killer?

252
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:38,590
   - Nah, I mean he's
   all right, but,

253
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:45,530
   look, Mr. Barney, falling
   in love it seemed so easy,

254
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:49,801
   but none of the things dad
   wants me to do are easy.

255
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:52,003
  So I have a plan B.

256
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,572
- Shove that cucumber up my ass?

257
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:54,940
  - No, I'm saving up.

258
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:57,075
 I'm saving up so I can
 see him in Chicago,

259
00:13:57,142 --> 00:13:59,811
  the land of wishes,
  hopes and dreams.

260
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:01,246
   And you know what?

261
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:03,915
 I'm real, real, close.

262
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:07,719
 - Look, maybe I should
 head back to the wife.

263
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,724
you know it's late and,
it's just, kinda weird.

264
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,628
- Sorry.

265
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:18,764
- No, no, it's not you.

266
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,565
It's me.

267
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:23,902
   You know, with the others
   it was a lot easier.

268
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:26,705
  You know it didn't
  seem like cheating,

269
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:29,107
it was just something different,

270
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:31,810
but you, you're a Jane,

271
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:33,812
   and we're in a motel room

272
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,782
   and that's weird.

273
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,494
   I am such a jerk.

274
00:14:50,762 --> 00:14:52,898
  I'm not gay.

275
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:55,767
   Okay, maybe a little bit,

276
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,836
   but like a pinky's
   worth of gayness,

277
00:14:57,903 --> 00:15:02,040
  barely noticeable,
  but I love my wife.

278
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,145
  Maybe I should talk to her.

279
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:11,049
  Maybe I should talk to her?

280
00:15:11,116 --> 00:15:12,250
   That's the ticket.

281
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:13,885
Maybe she'll understand.

282
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:16,655
 Maybe I'll understand,
 what I'm doing.

283
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:21,092
 I am not going to
 hurt my wife anymore!

284
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,160
Do you hear me?

285
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:26,097
 I am not going to
 hurt my wife anymore!

286
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,936
  Can you give me a ride home?

287
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,142
 Make a right.

288
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:38,143
 No, not there!

289
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,178
Not there, here!

290
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:46,751
 Turn left at the sign.

291
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:52,090
   Yeah, and the third
   house, 704 Hauser Street.

292
00:16:00,665 --> 00:16:02,934
  This is the start of
  something beautiful,

293
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:05,804
I can smell it.

294
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:07,305
Thank you, Jane.

295
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:11,176
 You've helped me put some
 perspective back into my life.

296
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:13,879
  I now know that I was
  hurting the one that I love

297
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:17,582
   in a profound and
   meaningful way.

298
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,120
   So how much do you need to
   see your daddy in Chicago?

299
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:25,624
 - Three dollars and 42 cents.

300
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:32,797
   - Well, good luck.

301
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,072
 Do you have change for a five?

302
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:46,211
Say hi to Gerry for me.

303
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:49,180
 Your pimp sounds like
 a really lucky guy.

304
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:53,184
  - He's not my pimp.

305
00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:04,629
  Dear Kenny.

306
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,698
 I'm glad you are well.

307
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:10,335
 Please don't write to me again

308
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:15,040
 cause Mr. Barney gave
 me enough money to

309
00:17:15,106 --> 00:17:18,043
go to Chicago to be with Daddy.

310
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,814
I don't need to fall in
love with you anymore.

311
00:17:23,448 --> 00:17:26,618
So, um, thanks.

312
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:32,057
Besides, you're a serial killer.

313
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:37,996
   Good luck with the lethal
   injection and everything.

314
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,932
Love and kisses,

315
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:46,071
  Jane White.

316
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:52,911
   (singing) It's the
   Jane White Show!

317
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:55,714
   It's the Jane White Show.

318
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:57,882
   It's the song the
   Jane White Show

319
00:17:57,949 --> 00:18:00,418
 I'm gonna sing that
 on the Jane White Show

320
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:03,989
 Cause I'm Jane White
 Jane White Jane White

321
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:07,125
On the Jane White Show!

322
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:11,062
   (applause)

323
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:13,665
- Come on poopy pants, move it.

324
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:19,137
   Oh, noodle nose, you
   haven't been watching that

325
00:18:19,204 --> 00:18:22,073
  idiot box, have you?

326
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,943
 Of course not.

327
00:18:26,077 --> 00:18:28,279
Is that?

328
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:30,849
   You're not wearing
   eye liner are you?

329
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:33,451
  No, I don't like it.

330
00:18:33,518 --> 00:18:36,021
  And do you know why?

331
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:39,524
- Because boys will get
aroused and get me drunk

332
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:43,528
 - (together) at a bar and take
 me home and play Barry White

333
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:45,230
 and have sex with me.

334
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:46,364
 (laugh track)

335
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:49,768
- And get you pregnant,
and then leave you,

336
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:52,504
  alone, with a child.

337
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,840
   And even if that child
   is the most special thing

338
00:18:55,907 --> 00:18:58,410
  in the whole world,
  it wouldn't matter.

339
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:00,412
 Because every time
 you look into her eyes

340
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:03,148
  you will be reminded
  of the abandonment.

341
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:05,417
   And hate every day you're
   alive because of the

342
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:08,987
 feelings of resentment
 and loneliness,

343
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:10,922
 and you'll end up a
 bitter old woman with

344
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:12,957
   no friends at all except
   the one person responsible

345
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:15,427
for the whole damn mess
in the first place.

346
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:17,829
  Your child.

347
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:20,765
  - [Audience] Ooo...

348
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:22,400

00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:27,285
   a 200 mile radius.

528
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:29,587
We're going to be going
live now to Mel Holiday

529
00:27:29,654 --> 00:27:32,657
   who is at the scene, Mel?

530
00:27:33,457 --> 00:27:35,293
  Mel?

531
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,309
 - [Jane] (echoing) Dear Kenny

532
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:54,946
 Mr. Barney gave me
 money to go to Chicago

533
00:27:55,012 --> 00:27:57,415
  to be with dad, and

534
00:27:57,481 --> 00:28:02,520
   kisses Jane White.

535
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,956
   (buzzing)

536
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:06,691
 Wake.

537
00:28:06,757 --> 00:28:08,826
  I know who you are.

538
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,296
- Are you free Saturday?

539
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:19,570
- You're Kenny Kingman,
the Lollypop Killer.

540
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:21,472
- Jane!

541
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,347
   Jane, darling, I
   knew I'd find you!

542
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:32,883
  - Hey, get the
  hell off my street.

543
00:28:33,084 --> 00:28:34,552
Can't you read the sign?

544
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,320
   This is my street.

545
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:38,689
   Oh crap, this is
   Chi-Chi's street.

546
00:28:38,756 --> 00:28:40,658
  - Isn't she a beaut?

547
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:41,759
 - Who?

548
00:28:41,826 --> 00:28:44,729
  - Betsy. She's not
  dying anymore, Jane.

549
00:28:44,795 --> 00:28:46,397
 You saved her!

550
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,399
   It's just what the
   doctor ordered.

551
00:28:48,466 --> 00:28:50,968
   - Do you have my
   ticket to Chicago?

552
00:28:52,637 --> 00:28:56,874
  - Listen dollface, I'm just
  looking for some kindness.

553
00:28:57,074 --> 00:28:59,977
 Someone to travel this
 beautiful world with.

554
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:03,314
  And a good hand job.

555
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:04,749
Okay and a beer.

556
00:29:04,815 --> 00:29:08,686
  Some kindness to the world,
  a hand job and a beer.

557
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:10,588
What do you say we
give that guy the slip,

558
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:15,393
  and go travel the world
  together, getting hand jobs?

559
00:29:15,626 --> 00:29:17,995
- Jane? When you gave
me that money I thought

560
00:29:18,062 --> 00:29:19,864
   it was for Betsy.

561
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,099
  You didn't want
  her to die did you?

562
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:25,636
  - No, but where's my ticket?

563
00:29:25,836 --> 00:29:28,973
 - Okay, no beer, just
 kindness to the world,

564
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,509
and a hand job.

565
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:35,746
 Okay, no world, just a little
 four-knuckle love shuffle,

566
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:37,848
   and some kindness.

567
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:40,117
- Betsy will take you. Tonight!

568
00:29:40,184 --> 00:29:42,953
 Oh Jane, it'll be monumental.

569
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,191
 Shh.. Ever since I first laid
 eyes on you in the bus station

570
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:48,959
 I knew that we were
 meant to be together.

571
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:50,094
 And now that I've got
 you I'm not ever going

572
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:51,696
 to let you go.

573
00:29:51,762 --> 00:29:53,197
 I'm going to handcuff
 you to my heart,

574
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:56,734
and stab you repeatedly
with my love.

575
00:29:56,934 --> 00:30:00,404
- Okay, just a hand job
and then I'm outta here.

576
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:07,978
 Oh look, there's gum.

577
00:30:08,212 --> 00:30:11,849
 - Jane, let's start
 something beautiful together.

578
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:14,185
   - What time is it?

579
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:15,486
- Time?

580
00:30:15,553 --> 00:30:16,520
My darling there's no concept...

581
00:30:16,587 --> 00:30:18,522
  - The time?

582
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:21,125
- 10:14?

583
00:30:21,192 --> 00:30:23,761
 - The Gerry Show starts at 11.

584
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:26,130
   - Well I know the perfect
   place to watch Gerry,

585
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:28,232
before we go see Gerry.

586
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:30,601
- Want some gum?

587
00:30:30,968 --> 00:30:35,506
 (guitar music)

588
00:30:40,778 --> 00:30:43,647
 ♪ I'm throwing my
 love against the wall

589
00:30:43,848 --> 00:30:47,184
 ♪ I watch it slide as it falls

590
00:30:47,251 --> 00:30:51,188
♪ And I think to myself,
what you do that for?

591
00:30:53,924 --> 00:30:58,763
   ♪ I walk away I hear
   sweet things that you say

592
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,701
♪ Then I turn around
and I come back for more

593
00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:08,506
   ♪ I throw my love
   against the wall ♪

594
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:10,941
 - Wow!

595
00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:14,278
- You know I've never
liked this place before.

596
00:31:14,345 --> 00:31:16,213
   Until now.

597
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,616
 - Why?

598
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:23,020
  - Because it's never looked
  beautiful until tonight.

599
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:29,827
 I never thought I
 could fall this hard.

600
00:31:29,894 --> 00:31:32,463
- I never thought I
could be this hard too.

601
00:31:33,664 --> 00:31:37,535
(flies buzzing)

602
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:43,474
   - Gotcha!

603
00:31:44,608 --> 00:31:48,512
  (squishing)

604
00:31:58,622 --> 00:32:01,559
 - You are so talented.

605
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:04,495
 - Shut up, I am not talented.

606
00:32:04,695 --> 00:32:07,097
You just make me feel that way.

607
00:32:08,032 --> 00:32:10,267
 - Um..

608
00:32:10,468 --> 00:32:12,736
- Jane?

609
00:32:12,803 --> 00:32:13,237
   - The TV.

610
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:14,138
- What?

611
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:14,939
   - Where's the TV?

612
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:16,807
   - What TV?

613
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:20,177
- Wait!

614
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:55,713
- [Gerry] And his wife
is a full-time mom and a

615
00:32:57,248 --> 00:33:01,151
part-time cashier at
the Hoggly Woggly Mart.

616
00:33:01,218 --> 00:33:05,823
  Tiffany, why don't you start
  by telling me what happened.

617
00:33:06,223 --> 00:33:09,793
   - Gerry, my husband
   thinks he's Jesus Christ.

618
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,329
  (audience laughing)

619
00:33:13,864 --> 00:33:14,331
- Burt?

620
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:15,132
- What?

621
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:17,868
   - Are you the son of God?

622
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:18,936
   - Yes sir, Gerry.

623
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:21,338
 Swear to Dad.

624
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,173
 I ain't a particularly
 religious man,

625
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,042
at least I wasn't until
a couple month ago.

626
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,944
  - Yeah 12 months
  to the year, Gerry.

627
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:29,647
  - Shut up, bitch,
  I'm the son of God.

628
00:33:29,713 --> 00:33:31,015
I'll smite you.

629
00:33:31,081 --> 00:33:32,650
 - You don't even
 know what that means.

630
00:33:32,716 --> 00:33:35,152
- Why you up in my face,
don't you know who I am?

631
00:33:36,954 --> 00:33:40,891
- You see this, Gerry, we
haven't had sex in eight months.

632
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:45,963
 - Yeah, that is because my
 dick has been blessed by God.

633
00:33:46,964 --> 00:33:49,967
I got Jesus dick, Gerry.

634
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:53,103
   - Baby, you and me gotta
   be the luckiest dreamers.

635
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,306
 - Shh!

636
00:33:59,343 --> 00:34:01,979
  (audience applause)

637
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:03,881
   - Wow, that's some remote.

638
00:34:03,948 --> 00:34:05,849
- Yeah.

639
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:09,987
 - [Gerry] Nancy is 29
 years old, enjoys fine

640
00:34:10,054 --> 00:34:12,890
  French merlot and
  candle wax massages.

641
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:17,394
 She also says she is,
 the daughter of God.

642
00:34:17,995 --> 00:34:20,130
  (audience laughing)

643
00:34:20,197 --> 00:34:23,100
 Now, Nancy, are you religious?

644
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:24,902
  - Religious?

645
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:27,371
 - Yes, do you pray, go
 to church, et cetera?

646
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:32,109
- Well, Gerry, isn't
that a little redundant?

647
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,246
  - This was indeed a special
  night for all of us,

648
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:38,382
not just because we were
blessed with the son

649
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:41,251
  and daughter of God, oh no.

650
00:34:41,318 --> 00:34:45,889
   But because we can now
   take a deep breath, relax,

651
00:34:46,523 --> 00:34:50,361
   and know that everything
   is going to be all right.

652
00:34:50,828 --> 00:34:54,031
 That no matter horrors
 lie in our future...

653
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:58,869
   (snoring)

654
00:35:00,237 --> 00:35:03,807
 This is Gerry King for
 The Gerry Show saying,

655
00:35:03,874 --> 00:35:08,812
  be kind, be happy, be free.

656
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:12,182
  (audience applause)

657
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:14,051
   - [Announcer] Next on The
   Gerry Show, how my alien

658
00:35:14,118 --> 00:35:16,787
 abduction gave my sex
 life super powers.

659
00:35:16,854 --> 00:35:18,389
If you've been abducted
by extra-terretrals,

660
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:20,357
  and notice that your sexual
  performance has improved

661
00:35:20,424 --> 00:35:22,192
 or your partner has been
 abducted with similar results,

662
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:23,560
 - Yes!

663
00:35:23,627 --> 00:35:25,329
   - [Announcer] then call us
   at The Gerry Show today.

664
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:26,830
   - Gee, I forgot the soap.

665
00:35:26,897 --> 00:35:30,768
  - This is the most greatest
  thing in the whole world.

666
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,970
 Better than Sweet Valley High.

667
00:35:33,037 --> 00:35:35,472
 Better than Saved by the Bell!

668
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:37,808
  - Oh, that Screech is funny.

669
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:41,078
  - If we find aliens and get
  supernatural sex powers,

670
00:35:41,145 --> 00:35:43,047
 we could have it all!

671
00:35:43,113 --> 00:35:45,983
  There is no way Dad
  won't see me now.

672
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,452
   We could take home
   the grand prize,

673
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:51,488
the final spin, three
joker's secret password,

674
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:53,223
final jeopardy.

675
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,060
So, let's do it.

676
00:35:56,627 --> 00:35:58,962
- Right here? Right now?

677
00:35:59,029 --> 00:36:00,431
 Or in Chicago?

678
00:36:00,497 --> 00:36:02,332
  - No, in the desert.

679
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:04,535
(dramatic music)

680
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:06,103
 - The desert?

681
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,839
- Yes! Doesn't it feel so right?

682
00:36:08,906 --> 00:36:11,442
  Doesn't it feel as fantastic
  as a Christmas special

683
00:36:11,508 --> 00:36:13,243
   with Rudolph the
   Red-Nosed Reindeer and the

684
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,879
  Abominable Snowman?

685
00:36:16,547 --> 00:36:18,315
   What's the matter?

686
00:36:18,382 --> 00:36:20,851
  You're losing color.

687
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:23,387
  - I'm fine.

688
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:26,023
 I would travel to the ends of
 the earth for you, my dear,

689
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:29,326
  but you must tell
  me, why the desert?

690
00:36:29,393 --> 00:36:32,362
   - Aliens love the desert.

691
00:36:33,163 --> 00:36:35,332
  - Aliens love swamp
  gas and drunken

692
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,600
  old fishermen and moonshine.

693
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,368
  - No, silly.

694
00:36:38,435 --> 00:36:43,006
 The X-Files, Area 51,
 Project Bluebook, Millennium,

695
00:36:43,073 --> 00:36:46,110
  3rd Rock from the Sun, duh!

696
00:36:46,176 --> 00:36:47,444
  That is where it'll happen!

697
00:36:47,511 --> 00:36:51,048
  That is where we'll get
  abducted and get, you know,

698
00:36:51,115 --> 00:36:53,050
 those powers.

699
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:55,285
  - Of course.

700
00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:57,187
  The desert.

701
00:36:57,254 --> 00:37:01,391
   Far away from people, no
   phones, no human contact.

702
00:37:02,392 --> 00:37:04,928
 Alone.

703
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:07,397
 Okay.

704
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:09,500
 I will take you to the
 desert and we will be

705
00:37:09,566 --> 00:37:12,369
 abducted by aliens if
 that is what you wish.

706
00:37:12,436 --> 00:37:13,804
  - Then set a course
  for adventure.

707
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:18,041
 This is going to be the most
 perfectest weekend of my life!

708
00:37:19,143 --> 00:37:23,046
  (zany music)

709
00:37:33,557 --> 00:37:36,460
 (yawning) Are we here?

710
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,061
- Yeah.

711
00:37:39,496 --> 00:37:41,465
 Yeah.

712
00:37:41,665 --> 00:37:43,300
  The desert.

713
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:45,936
(dramatic music)

714
00:37:46,003 --> 00:37:48,005
 - I gotta pee.

715
00:37:53,343 --> 00:37:58,348
(ominous music)

716
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:07,090
- There.

717
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:12,029
 Jane?

718
00:38:13,163 --> 00:38:14,865
 Jane?

719
00:38:15,532 --> 00:38:17,401
  Jane, where are you?

720
00:38:18,602 --> 00:38:20,938
   Oh my God, she's left me.

721
00:38:21,004 --> 00:38:23,540
   Oh my God what
   have I done, Jane!

722
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,442
 Jane!

723
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:27,244
- I'm over here.

724
00:38:27,311 --> 00:38:29,046
  See!

725
00:38:29,379 --> 00:38:31,548
   - Ah ah ah

726
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:39,957
   - Ah ah ah

727
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:44,294
- Are you cold?

728
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:46,463
 You're all white or something.

729
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,631
 - Ah ah ah ah

730
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:50,267
- Did an alien get you already?

731
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:51,335
 - Ah ah ah ah

732
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:53,537
- How's your sex drive?

733
00:38:57,174 --> 00:39:02,246
 - Don't you ever ever do
 anything like that again Jane.

734
00:39:04,414 --> 00:39:07,251
   You promise me,
   do you understand?

735
00:39:07,317 --> 00:39:09,119
 - Pee?

736
00:39:09,186 --> 00:39:12,422
- You know exactly what
I'm talking about Jane.

737
00:39:12,623 --> 00:39:15,626
   You ignorant slut!

738
00:39:19,663 --> 00:39:23,700
I'm, I'm sorry.

739
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:28,939
   Could we maybe pretend
   that that never happened?

740
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:32,109
 - Whatchu talkin' 'bout, Dick?

741
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:34,578
   - Thanks.

742
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:38,181
   Let's prepare our
   camp, sweetness.

743
00:39:43,287 --> 00:39:47,624
(ominous music)

744
00:40:01,138 --> 00:40:02,506
(echoing voices)

745
00:40:02,572 --> 00:40:03,874
 - [Dick] And now that I've got
 you I'm not ever going to...

746
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,242
 [News Anchor] Authorities are
 saying that Kenny Kingman,

747
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,811
   also known as the Lollypop
   Killer, has escaped from

748
00:40:07,878 --> 00:40:09,546
  Folsom State Prison.

749
00:40:09,613 --> 00:40:13,450
   - [Mom] Men are evil, men
   are evil, men are evil

750
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:16,186
  - Stay back!

751
00:40:16,253 --> 00:40:17,254
 Back!

752
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:20,757
 I know all about you.

753
00:40:20,824 --> 00:40:23,060
   You and your past.

754
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:25,429
 What the heck was I thinking?

755
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:29,499
 You were going to serial
 kill the aliens, weren't you?

756
00:40:29,566 --> 00:40:32,602
 What in the world did
 they ever do to you?

757
00:40:32,669 --> 00:40:35,639
They're cute, and green,
and Gerry says they

758
00:40:35,706 --> 00:40:38,642
can give us
supernatural sex powers.

759
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:41,378
 Is that it? You don't
 like green things?

760
00:40:41,445 --> 00:40:43,714
 - Jane, listen to me.

761
00:40:45,248 --> 00:40:50,253
  When I was very young, I
  went camping with my father.

762
00:40:52,189 --> 00:40:55,492
 - So? When I was four I went
 to the market with my mother.

763
00:40:55,892 --> 00:41:01,164
- Shortly after 2:33 A.M.,
Father, having indigestion from

764
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:06,303
 our nightly kill, you see, all
 of us boys knew how to hunt.

765
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:10,574
   Father, exited the safety
   of our camp to excrete the

766
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,777
evening's fare.

767
00:41:14,444 --> 00:41:16,780
   The scream, Jane.

768
00:41:18,181 --> 00:41:20,183
  The scream.

769
00:41:20,751 --> 00:41:25,756
  Such pain and
  horror and surprise.

770
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:31,828
I jumped up thinking
that it was a nightmare.

771
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,699
But I was awake.

772
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,068
And it was real.

773
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:41,805
 I tried to get out of my
 sleeping bag but I was caught

774
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:44,374
 and confused.

775
00:41:45,342 --> 00:41:49,212
  Finally, through a clearing,

776
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:51,314
   I saw it.

777
00:41:57,254 --> 00:42:02,325
A mighty, 39-point buck

778
00:42:04,494 --> 00:42:08,198
 was humping my father.

779
00:42:08,698 --> 00:42:12,402
 With great speed and ferocity.

780
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:14,805
  My father and I locked eyes,

781
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:17,941
 him, unable to escape
 the buck's embrace,

782
00:42:18,008 --> 00:42:21,411
me, unable to help him.

783
00:42:21,478 --> 00:42:25,682
It must have gotten him
when he bent over to...

784
00:42:28,618 --> 00:42:32,622
 The buck leaned its head back,

785
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:38,862
and it let loose
a lustful squeal

786
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:56,146
  (squealing)

787
00:43:10,494 --> 00:43:14,531
   (thudding)

788
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:18,768
- I'm so sorry.

789
00:43:19,336 --> 00:43:20,937
- Naturally, Jane, when
you said you wanted to

790
00:43:21,004 --> 00:43:24,741
 come into the desert, all of
 this came flooding back to me.

791
00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:30,680
  And then, when you,
  you know, when you

792
00:43:31,515 --> 00:43:35,552
  went number one over there,

793
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:38,021
I vowed that I would never again

794
00:43:38,088 --> 00:43:41,958
  experience that type
  of horror, Jane.

795
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:44,528
  I just want to protect you.

796
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:45,929
From everything.

797
00:43:45,996 --> 00:43:48,965
   Including aliens.

798
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,870
   I'm so sorry, can
   you forgive me?

799
00:43:54,571 --> 00:43:57,541
   - Is that what you
   wanted to tell me?

800
00:43:57,607 --> 00:44:00,844
  That was very Party
  of Five of you.

801
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:06,583

 wish I was abducted.

826
00:45:50,053 --> 00:45:53,023
- So that you could get
supernatural sex powers?

827
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:54,724
 - No.

828
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:56,793
   Just so I could get away.

829
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,063
  To see other things
  and other places.

830
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,867
   I think that it would be
   so neato to see everything

831
00:46:03,933 --> 00:46:06,403
  I see on TV.

832
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:10,373
  But my mom says my TV's
  made me too stupid to leave.

833
00:46:11,174 --> 00:46:14,878
  But one day I'll get
  smart, I know it.

834
00:46:14,944 --> 00:46:18,915
   And then nothing will stop
   me, I will see everything.

835
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:23,853
  - But what about the aliens?

836
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,191
 - Well, maybe it's okay if we
 don't see the aliens tonight.

837
00:46:28,258 --> 00:46:30,960
  - But Jane it means
  so much to you.

838
00:46:31,027 --> 00:46:32,595
 - I have you.

839
00:46:32,662 --> 00:46:34,931
  And Betsy can still
  take us to Chicago.

840
00:46:34,998 --> 00:46:38,034
   - But darling if I don't
   produce the aliens for you

841
00:46:38,101 --> 00:46:40,503
 then I've failed you.

842
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:44,140
   However, if Gerry's next
   topic is the most in-love

843
00:46:44,207 --> 00:46:47,043
   people in the entire
   world, then surely we will

844
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,713
be his next guests,
because anyone else who

845
00:46:49,779 --> 00:46:53,183
attempts to claim that
mantle will be a fraud.

846
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:58,455
 - No, no the topic is, I'm
 in love with a serial killer.

847
00:46:59,222 --> 00:47:01,958
   - Well, if you have killed
   me a thousand times with

848
00:47:02,025 --> 00:47:05,495
 your loving heart then you
 are truly that serial killer.

849
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:07,731
 - No, you are.

850
00:47:07,797 --> 00:47:11,000
- Then I am your serial killer.

851
00:47:11,801 --> 00:47:14,537
   - You don't have to sound
   like a Hallmark card.

852
00:47:14,604 --> 00:47:16,239
 I know all about you.

853
00:47:16,306 --> 00:47:17,874
   And it's perfect!

854
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:22,612
You and me and Gerry,
it's all I ever wanted.

855
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:26,015
 It's just us here in
 the middle of nowhere,

856
00:47:26,082 --> 00:47:31,054
  alone, cut off from everyone
  with a serial killer.

857
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:35,892
 - What? Serial killer?

858
00:47:35,959 --> 00:47:37,026
 Where?

859
00:47:37,093 --> 00:47:40,263
- Kenny? Kenny Kingman?
The Lollypop Killer,

860
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,665
  you escaped.

861
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,973
   Oh my God.

862
00:47:50,206 --> 00:47:52,142
  - Jane, Jane you're
  talking in riddles,

863
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:54,210
   honey, I don't understand.

864
00:47:54,277 --> 00:47:57,213
- Who the heck are you?

865
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,083
   - Believe it or
   not it's just me.

866
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,985
   Just Dick.

867
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:04,521
 I'm Dick, Dick Smith.

868
00:48:04,587 --> 00:48:06,289
  I'm an econ major
  at community college

869
00:48:06,356 --> 00:48:08,758
  and I world three nights a
  week at Wally's Weiner World

870
00:48:08,825 --> 00:48:10,627
  to pay off my student loans.

871
00:48:10,693 --> 00:48:11,828
  Who's Kenny?

872
00:48:11,895 --> 00:48:14,164
  - Dick, who's Dick?

873
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,300
And what the heck did

00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:37,187
 We came out here into
 the desert so we could

   abducted by aliens and get
   supernatural sex powers.

883
00:48:42,692 --> 00:48:45,962

  just a minute ladies
  and gentlemen.

978
00:54:28,204 --> 00:54:30,406
  Okay, approximately
  four minutes ago

979
00:54:30,473 --> 00:54:33,042
 at the taping of his show
 Gerry, host and international

980
00:54:33,109 --> 00:54:36,012
   star of The Gerry Show and
   former mayor of Chicago,

981
00:54:36,078 --> 00:54:39,081
   was brutally and viciously
   butchered on his live show

982
00:54:39,148 --> 00:54:40,950
 earlier today.

983
00:54:41,017 --> 00:54:43,152
Luckily, we have it all on tape.

984
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:46,989
The topic, my daughter
is a Clover Scout Nazi.

985
00:54:48,591 --> 00:54:53,196
   Re-roll the tape,
   re-roll that now.

986
00:54:55,198 --> 00:54:58,434
  Let's see that again, but
  can you slow it down a bit?

987
00:54:59,335 --> 00:55:02,171
  I believe we can see the
  moment just when Gerry loses

988
00:55:02,238 --> 00:55:05,474
  all consciousness
  and hope of living.

989
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:07,410
 Can we see that on camera two?

990
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:11,113
   There. Now can you shuttle
   frame that last image?

991
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,417
And zoom it. Yes, good.

992
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:17,987
 Now there, you see it?

993
00:55:18,487 --> 00:55:21,090
 You know just frame by frame
 until we get to the last image

994
00:55:21,157 --> 00:55:24,961
  in one more moment,
  yes, there it is,

995
00:55:25,161 --> 00:55:27,196
   there is where is life it
   gone, that is the moment

996
00:55:27,263 --> 00:55:30,166
   where he is no
   more, right there.

997
00:55:30,233 --> 00:55:31,968
Could we roll that back at all?

998
00:55:32,034 --> 00:55:33,436
 We can? Good.

999
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:35,738

going to roll the tape?

  Right here.

1012

 - So how was Chicago?

1013
00:57:52,942 --> 00:57:55,511

- Oh, the pimp.

1017
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:01,884
  - And now he's dead.

1018
00:58:01,951 --> 00:58:04,253
   Dead because of
   that stupid idiot

1019

Why Mr. Barney?

1021

 Why did she have to kill him?

1022
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:14,830
 - Maybe the other pimp
 wanted his bitches.

1023
00:58:14,897 --> 00:58:16,732
  - You think?

1024
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:20,503
  You think maybe it
  was Sally or Oprah?

1025
00:58:21,303 --> 00:58:22,304
- Sure.

1026
00:58:22,371 --> 00:58:24,673
  Oprah. That name
  sounds pretty evil.

1027
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,809
 - That bitch.

1028
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:29,345

1035
00:58:47,663 --> 00:58:51,267
 - My wife and I we're
 in counseling now.

1036
00:58:51,634 --> 00:58:53,202
- Is it helping?

1037
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:55,604
   - Yeah, it's pretty good.

1038
00:59:00,543 --> 00:59:03,479
Look, I'm sorry your pimp died.

1039
00:59:05,881 --> 00:59:08,551
  - He wasn't my pimp.

1040
00:59:08,617 --> 00:59:11,454
   He was my father.

1041
00:59:13,389 --> 00:59:16,759
 - Man, that's twisted.

1042
00:59:17,493 --> 00:59:22,131

1043
00:59:38,547 --> 00:59:41,817

 didn't he? Didn't he?

1044
00:59:41,884 --> 00:59:42,985
 - The aliens?

1045
00:59:43,052 --> 00:59:45,254
  - What? What aliens?

1046
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:46,889
- No aliens, we didn't see any.

1047
00:59:46,956 --> 00:59:47,756
- See any what?

1048
00:59:47,823 --> 00:59:48,624

1049
00:59:48,691 --> 00:59:50,593

00:59:52,394 --> 00:59:53,696
   - Who, the alien?

1052
00:59:53,762 --> 00:59:54,930
  - No, Dick.

1053
00:59:54,997 --> 00:59:56,432
  - Dick, the Mexican?

1054
00:59:56,499 --> 00:59:58,567
  - No, Dick the dick,
  he's just Dick.

1055
00:59:58,634 --> 01:00:00,503
   He's not Dick the Mexican
   or Dick the Alien,

1056
01:00:00,569 --> 01:00:02,972
   or Dick the serial killer.

1057
01:00:03,038 --> 01:00:04,840
 - Look, honey, I don't
 care if he's Mexican,

1058
01:00:04,907 --> 01:00:06,542
 that's not the point.

1059
01:00:06,609 --> 01:00:08,978
 - He could be Mexican
 but I don't think so.

1060
01:00:09,044 --> 01:00:11,013
 Mom I'm really tired.

1061
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:15,951
- Did Dick the Mexican,
or the Alien, rape you?

1062
01:00:16,418 --> 01:00:17,486
 - Mom!

1063
01:00:17,553 --> 01:00:20,022
  Dick the dick and I
  didn't vo-di-oh-do.

1064
01:00:20,089 --> 01:00:21,991
   What about you and Burger?

1065
01:00:22,057 --> 01:00:23,392
- What?

1066
01:00:23,459 --> 01:00:24,460
Don't be stupid.

1067
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:25,961
  And don't try to
  change the subject.

1068
01:00:26,028 --> 01:00:27,663
 - I got to Mrs. White.

1069
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,031
   Hey, Janie, how you doing?

1070
01:00:29,098 --> 01:00:30,232
  - [Jane] Hi Burger.

1071
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:33,569
- Burger, so did you get
that order for tomorrow?

1072
01:00:33,636 --> 01:00:36,505
  You know the brushes
  and the things?

1073
01:00:36,705 --> 01:00:38,574
  - No, uh-huh, you want me to
  pick up some brushes for ya?

1074
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:40,809
- Okay then, goodnight, Burger.

1075
01:00:40,876 --> 01:00:43,279
  - Whatever.

1076
01:00:43,646 --> 01:00:47,683
(dramatic music)

1077
01:00:49,685 --> 01:00:51,320
  - Goodnight, Burger.

1078
01:00:51,387 --> 01:00:54,790
Don't forget those
brushes and the things.

1079
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:57,326
   Yeah, oh yeah I'm going to
   bring a brush back later

1080
01:00:57,393 --> 01:00:59,395
   and dip it in some
   more of that pie.

1081
01:00:59,461 --> 01:01:01,564
  Everyone wants a
  taste of the Burger.

1082
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,699
  Nighty-night Janie.

1083
01:01:07,436 --> 01:01:10,973
  - Where were we? Oh
  yes, the Mexican.

1084
01:01:12,741 --> 01:01:17,746
  - I tried Mom, I tried
  ever since I saw Dad on TV.

1085
01:01:18,013 --> 01:01:19,982
   - What? What are
   you talking about?

1086
01:01:20,049 --> 01:01:22,451
Your father's never been on TV.

1087
01:01:22,518 --> 01:01:23,852
  - Now who's stupid?

1088
01:01:23,919 --> 01:01:25,854
   - Your father sold
   TVs for a living,

1089
01:01:25,921 --> 01:01:28,357
but he was never on TV.

1090
01:01:28,424 --> 01:01:30,659
Don't you remember your father?

1091
01:01:30,726 --> 01:01:33,596
   - My father was going to
   have me on his show right

1092
01:01:33,662 --> 01:01:36,532
after I fell in love with a
serial killer, and he was going

1093
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:40,603
to take me away from you
and this stupid house

1094
01:01:40,669 --> 01:01:44,406
 and this stupid city
 and this stupid life!

1095
01:01:44,607 --> 01:01:48,510
 - Your father is Mel
 Martin Benjamin White.

1096
01:01:48,577 --> 01:01:52,047
 And he sold televisions at
 BBW Appliance at Oak Park....

1097
01:01:52,114 --> 01:01:55,718
 - No! Stop it! He left
 us when I was eight to

1098
01:01:55,784 --> 01:01:59,822
   be the mayor of Chicago
   and to start his TV show.

1099
01:02:04,493 --> 01:02:07,896
   - Is this what television
   has done to you?

1100
01:02:10,566 --> 01:02:12,801
  Booger butt!

1101
01:02:13,502 --> 01:02:15,904
(dramatic music)

1102
01:02:15,971 --> 01:02:18,374
   - Where's my door?

1103
01:02:19,808 --> 01:02:22,544
   Where's my window?

1104
01:02:23,746 --> 01:02:25,914
  Mom?

1105
01:02:28,517 --> 01:02:30,519
  Mom?

1106
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,623
   - Your boob tube's
   in my room, I...

1107
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:37,660
  - My shows?

1108
01:02:40,929 --> 01:02:43,565
 - So I'm the bad person here?

1109
01:02:43,632 --> 01:02:45,134
   The freak?

1110
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,736
I'm the terrible parent?

1111
01:02:47,803 --> 01:02:51,674
- What do you want? Who are you?

1112
01:02:52,908 --> 01:02:55,077
   - I'm your mother.

1113
01:02:55,144 --> 01:02:59,615
 I am not some god
 damn television show.

1114
01:02:59,882 --> 01:03:01,884
   That box doesn't need you.

1115
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,786
  I need you.

1116
01:03:03,852 --> 01:03:05,888
  That tube can't
  give you what I can.

1117
01:03:05,954 --> 01:03:07,489
- You're wrong.

1118
01:03:07,556 --> 01:03:09,958
 That box gives me my freedom.

1119
01:03:10,025 --> 01:03:11,994
It takes me out of here.

1120
01:03:12,061 --> 01:03:14,897
   It takes me to Green
   Acres and to Central Perk,

1121
01:03:14,963 --> 01:03:19,034
   it takes me sailing across
   the galaxy on Voyager,

1122
01:03:19,101 --> 01:03:23,138
 and plants me on a barstool
 where everybody knows my name.

1123
01:03:24,073 --> 01:03:27,643
 I can buy shoes from Al
 Bundy, it lets me take a trip

1124
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:30,045
 on Road Rules.

1125
01:03:30,112 --> 01:03:34,516
   On my TV I can roam the
   sewers with real monsters,

1126
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:39,588
 my doctor is Mark Greene and I
 live at 1313 Mockingbird Lane

1127
01:03:40,022 --> 01:03:42,591
 where the kisses are
 hers and hers and his,

1128
01:03:42,658 --> 01:03:45,527
  and I have friends too, Mom.

1129
01:03:45,594 --> 01:03:49,732
  Frasier and Sigmund and
  Homer and Tutti and Elly May

1130
01:03:49,798 --> 01:03:53,168
   and Mr. Rogers and
   Samantha and Horshack and

1131
01:03:53,235 --> 01:03:56,071
  Roscoe P. Coltrane.

1132
01:04:00,676 --> 01:04:03,879
 - I thought I was your friend.

1133
01:04:04,747 --> 01:04:07,916
- You took away my door.

1134
01:04:08,117 --> 01:04:10,853
  - You tried to run
  away with a Mexican.

1135
01:04:10,919 --> 01:04:11,987
 - So?

1136
01:04:12,054 --> 01:04:15,624
You take away my TV?
You take away my tapes?

1137
01:04:15,691 --> 01:04:18,093
  You call yourself my friend?

1138
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:28,470
   (saxophone music)

1139
01:04:31,974 --> 01:04:36,979
 (piano music)

1140
01:04:53,328 --> 01:04:55,898
 Daddy?

1141
01:04:56,165 --> 01:04:58,901
  It's me, Jane White.

1142
01:04:58,967 --> 01:05:01,837
 I never made it to your show.

1143
01:05:01,904 --> 01:05:04,840
   I missed it by that much.

1144
01:05:05,207 --> 01:05:07,876
  But I tried.

1145
01:05:07,943 --> 01:05:10,546
 Is that okay?

1146
01:05:11,246 --> 01:05:15,617
I don't know, just,
why did you always have

1147
01:05:15,684 --> 01:05:18,754
   to pick such a hard topic?

1148
01:05:18,954 --> 01:05:21,657
  Why couldn't you do
  something simple?

1149
01:05:21,723 --> 01:05:25,027
Something about my life?

1150
01:05:25,093 --> 01:05:28,297
I'm not a lesbian
grandmother and I'm not

1151
01:05:28,363 --> 01:05:32,501
 sleeping with my
 best friend's father.

1152
01:05:32,835 --> 01:05:35,337
 - Jane! Jane!

1153
01:05:35,404 --> 01:05:37,706
(dramatic music)

1154
01:05:37,773 --> 01:05:39,641
- Dick?

1155
01:05:40,242 --> 01:05:42,044
 Dick?

1156
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,049
 Dick?

1157
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:48,951
- Jane!

1158
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:50,853
 Jane!

1159
01:05:51,053 --> 01:05:53,222
- Dick?

1160
01:05:53,655 --> 01:05:55,557
 Dick?

1161
01:05:56,225 --> 01:05:59,528
  (screaming)

1162
01:05:59,728 --> 01:06:01,663
   - You remembered my name!

1163
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,232
 - Dick, what is this?

1164
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:05,267
  - This is a gift,
  for you my darling.

1165
01:06:05,334 --> 01:06:07,035
  (screaming)

1166
01:06:07,102 --> 01:06:08,303
   If it is a serial
   killer you want,

1167
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:10,372
then a serial killer I shall be.

1168
01:06:10,439 --> 01:06:13,375
 We will be on The
 Gerry Show, you and I.

1169
01:06:13,442 --> 01:06:15,344
  (screaming)

1170
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:19,047
  I love you Jane White,
  with all my heart and soul.

1171
01:06:22,117 --> 01:06:25,854
But my petal, whatever is wrong?

1172
01:06:26,388 --> 01:06:29,191
 - Dick, Gerry's dead.

1173
01:06:30,259 --> 01:06:32,828
The show's over.

1174
01:06:33,295 --> 01:06:35,230
 - Oh.

1175
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:39,668
   (moaning)

1176
01:06:39,935 --> 01:06:42,004
  That sucks.

1177
01:06:42,771 --> 01:06:45,841
  - It sucks so much.

1178
01:06:54,216 --> 01:06:58,020
I miss him Dick,
I want him back.

1179
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:01,356
   It is so not fair.

1180
01:07:02,457 --> 01:07:06,061
   - [Mom] Pumpkin? Darling?

1181
01:07:06,128 --> 01:07:08,897
  - Um, Dick, I've got to go.

1182
01:07:08,964 --> 01:07:10,065
- Wait!

1183
01:07:10,132 --> 01:07:11,166
  (crunching)

1184
01:07:11,233 --> 01:07:13,101
(screaming and moaning)

1185
01:07:13,168 --> 01:07:14,403
- What?

1186
01:07:14,469 --> 01:07:19,107
   - Jane, if you can wait
   for a few life sentences,

1187
01:07:19,174 --> 01:07:23,879
I promise you I will
always be there for you.

1188
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,815
For us.

1189
01:07:26,882 --> 01:07:28,717
Forever.

1190
01:07:28,784 --> 01:07:30,752
- Oh, silly Dicky wicky.

1191
01:07:30,819 --> 01:07:33,055
  What's a few life sentences?

1192
01:07:33,121 --> 01:07:36,024
   I bet we've been together
   for a million years,

1193
01:07:36,091 --> 01:07:39,695
  and I bet we'll be together
  for a million more.

1194
01:07:40,529 --> 01:07:45,734
(romantic music)

1195
01:07:59,815 --> 01:08:04,886
  - (mumbling) No,
  turn your head, okay

1196
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:11,026
 - Ah!

1197
01:08:15,397 --> 01:08:19,234
 - You are frappalicious, Jane.

1198
01:08:20,502 --> 01:08:23,739
  Now go, I don't want
  you to see this.

1199
01:08:24,172 --> 01:08:26,041
   - You'll be okay?

1200
01:08:26,108 --> 01:08:28,276
- I'll be fine.

1201
01:08:28,343 --> 01:08:32,347
The only thing that can
hurt me now is a meteor.

1202
01:08:33,315 --> 01:08:36,118
 Or the plague.

1203
01:08:37,019 --> 01:08:39,054
- I love you Dick Smith.

1204
01:08:39,121 --> 01:08:43,291
   Always, I will be with you
   every step of the trial

1205
01:08:43,358 --> 01:08:45,794

   you're standing on there?

1209
01:08:57,139 --> 01:08:59,441
 Damn.

1210
01:09:00,542 --> 01:09:02,811
He must workout.

1211
01:09:09,885 --> 01:09:11,086

  F is for fireman

1223
01:10:36,438 --> 01:10:40,976
  - [Gerry] Stay right there,
  I have a surprise for you.

1224
01:10:43,311 --> 01:10:47,449
  Ladies and gentlemen, he
  was convicted for 13 counts

1225
01:10:47,516 --> 01:10:52,187
  of first degree murder, 50
  counts of child molestation,

1226
01:10:52,254 --> 01:10:56,324
   has over 65 felony arrests
   and last month just...

1227
01:10:58,727 --> 01:11:02,264
- Daddy?

1228
01:11:06,701 --> 01:11:09,905
 Mommy?

1229
01:11:12,307 --> 01:11:15,143
  Mom?

1230
01:11:19,247 --> 01:11:21,950
 - Hello, Jane.

1231
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:23,385
   - Burger?

1232
01:11:23,451 --> 01:11:26,421
(dramatic music)

1233
01:11:26,488 --> 01:11:28,990
   You're not Burger.

1234
01:11:30,725 --> 01:11:33,261
- Do you know who I am?

1235
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:39,000
- You're Kenny Kingman,
the Lollipop Killer.

1236
01:11:39,067 --> 01:11:42,671
  Um, Beau Bridges played you
  in the movie of the week.

1237
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:43,638
 - Yes.

1238
01:11:43,705 --> 01:11:45,607
  Yes, he did.

1239
01:11:47,142 --> 01:11:51,913
 - You want some milk?
 It does a body good.

1240
01:11:54,349 --> 01:11:55,550
 - No.

1241
01:11:57,686 --> 01:12:01,523
- You want to watch television?

1242
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:04,492
   It's must see TV.

1243
01:12:08,697 --> 01:12:10,298
 - No.

1244
01:12:11,066 --> 01:12:13,468
 You know what I want.

1245
01:12:13,735 --> 01:12:16,471
  - Another lollypop?

1246
01:12:19,174 --> 01:12:21,743
   - You write good letters,

1247
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:24,913
  and you have really
  pretty boobies.

1248
01:12:27,282 --> 01:12:31,519
(dramatic music)

1249
01:12:37,325 --> 01:12:39,961
  Ow!

1250
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:45,433
  - Oh my God, you
  killed Mr. Kingman!

1251
01:12:46,234 --> 01:12:48,937
  You bastard!

1252
01:12:49,137 --> 01:12:51,406
 I guess TV can save lives too.

1253
01:12:51,473 --> 01:12:53,174
 - It sure can.

1254
01:12:53,241 --> 01:12:55,543
   - Oh Dick you're so silly.

1255
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:56,411
   - Am not!

1256
01:12:56,478 --> 01:12:56,945
   - Are too!

1257
01:12:57,012 --> 01:12:57,512
   - Am not!

1258
01:12:57,579 --> 01:12:58,513
   - Are too!

1259
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,481
   - Are not!

1260
01:12:59,547 --> 01:13:01,449
 Infinity not!

1261
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:03,752
  - Pretending to kill
  my neighbors when

1262
01:13:03,818 --> 01:13:07,188
really it was the serial
killer Kenny Kingman.

1263
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:11,359
  - Uh-huh. Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1264
01:13:12,594 --> 01:13:15,130
   - Why didn't you just
   tell me you didn't do it?

1265
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:17,132
I would still love you.

1266
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:19,334
- Well, you see Jane...

1267
01:13:24,572 --> 01:13:26,341
 Jane!

1268
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:29,744
  Ooo, you thought he was me?

1269
01:13:30,378 --> 01:13:31,780
 Jane, he doesn't look
 anything like me,

1270
01:13:31,846 --> 01:13:35,283
 that guy weighs close
 to like 300 pounds.

1271
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:38,386
 Jane, he's like 60 years old!

1272
01:13:39,754 --> 01:13:43,658
 - Dick, sorry. They were using
 old pictures on the computer.

1273
01:13:44,426 --> 01:13:46,661
 - He's a whale, Jane!

1274
01:13:46,728 --> 01:13:49,831
  That guy didn't kill
  his victims, he must
  have ate them all.

1275
01:13:49,898 --> 01:13:52,500
 Is that how you see me,
 Jane? Is that how you see me?

1276
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:54,602
   Tell me the truth.

1277
01:13:55,136 --> 01:13:57,706
   - Well, you do look a
   little like Beau Bridges.

1278
01:13:57,772 --> 01:14:00,275
  - Beau Bridges? Ooo!

1279
01:14:00,342 --> 01:14:05,380
 Jeff Bridges is the
 cute one, Jane. Geez!

1280
01:14:05,613 --> 01:14:09,484
   - [Mom] Sweetheart? Honey?

1281
01:14:10,185 --> 01:14:11,786
  Did you see?

1282
01:14:11,853 --> 01:14:15,390
Did you see me? I went outside!

1283
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:19,694
 I saw my car and our mailbox,
 and a bunch of people

1284
01:14:19,761 --> 01:14:21,429
  lying in the street.

1285
01:14:21,496 --> 01:14:24,399
   - I know, I know.

1286
01:14:24,766 --> 01:14:29,237
  Life is a ball again,
  laughter is calling for you.

1287
01:14:30,505 --> 01:14:33,375
   - I love you, Booger Butt.

1288
01:14:33,775 --> 01:14:36,378
 - I love you too, Mom.

1289
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:41,716
  Oh, Mom. I want you
  to meet Dick Smith.

1290
01:14:45,253 --> 01:14:47,122
 - You're the Mexican.

1291
01:14:47,188 --> 01:14:48,823
(dramatic music)

1292
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:50,291
   - Mexican?

1293
01:14:50,358 --> 01:14:52,394
   Oh great, now I'm Mexican.

1294
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:55,263
  First I'm Shamu,
  and now I'm Mexican.

1295
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:56,698
- What do you want here?

1296
01:14:56,765 --> 01:14:58,299
  - Well, I..

1297
01:14:58,366 --> 01:15:00,368
- We're in love.

1298
01:15:00,902 --> 01:15:03,638
   I know that I'm not smart
   enough to leave you,

1299
01:15:03,705 --> 01:15:06,307
  but Dick is.

1300
01:15:06,708 --> 01:15:09,110
  - What do you mean?

1301
01:15:15,683 --> 01:15:17,786
  But?

1302
01:15:19,821 --> 01:15:22,257
- We are going to see the world,

1303
01:15:22,323 --> 01:15:25,427
   and be the masters
   of our domain.

1304
01:15:25,493 --> 01:15:26,728
   - We are?

1305
01:15:26,795 --> 01:15:28,897
   - Yes, and we're going to
   meet interesting people

1306
01:15:28,963 --> 01:15:32,667
 and boldly go where no
 man has gone before.

1307
01:15:33,301 --> 01:15:35,236
- What about me?

1308
01:15:35,303 --> 01:15:38,339
- Mom, you have Burger.

1309
01:15:39,507 --> 01:15:41,443
  - It's not the same.

1310
01:15:41,509 --> 01:15:44,512
   - I know, you can
   have sex with him.

1311
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:47,849
Mom, it's been too long.

1312
01:15:47,916 --> 01:15:51,419
Dad died a long time
ago, you should be free

1313
01:15:51,486 --> 01:15:54,722
and happy and have fun.

1314
01:15:55,657 --> 01:15:58,893
- Like you, Jane White.

1315
01:15:59,594 --> 01:16:01,529
   - Like me.

1316
01:16:01,896 --> 01:16:03,798
 Come on, Dick.

1317
01:16:09,037 --> 01:16:11,506
 - Jane, wait!

1318
01:16:12,373 --> 01:16:14,309
 Where do you want to go today?

1319
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:17,745
  - I don't know, how
  about Sesame Street?

1320
01:16:17,946 --> 01:16:18,913
- Oh that's great, that's great.

1321
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:20,982
   I always wanted
   to meet Big Bird.

1322
01:16:21,049 --> 01:16:23,518
Oh, or Twin Peaks,
that place is so scary.

1323
01:16:23,585 --> 01:16:25,887
 - I have an uncle in St. Olaf.

1324
01:16:25,954 --> 01:16:28,857
   - [Dick] How about
   the Twilight Zone?

1325
01:16:28,923 --> 01:16:30,725
  Ooo, or we could go
  to the Outer Limits.

1326
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:32,760
 Or Springfield, nobody really
 knows how to get there,

1327
01:16:32,827 --> 01:16:34,295
  but I know we'll find a way.

1328
01:16:34,362 --> 01:16:35,330

- Network executives
are scrambling to find a

1362
01:18:37,518 --> 01:18:39,887
  suitable replacement for
  the time slot once occupied

1363
01:18:39,954 --> 01:18:42,357
  by the now deceased
  and never to awaken

1364
01:18:42,423 --> 01:18:44,392
host of The Gerry Show.

1365
01:18:44,459 --> 01:18:46,494
Until a new replacement
can be found,

1366
01:18:46,561 --> 01:18:49,931
  episodes of Manimal will be
  airing in all time zones.

1367
01:18:49,998 --> 01:18:53,768
  As you may recall, he's
  part animal, he's part man,

1368
01:18:53,835 --> 01:18:56,371
 he's Manimal.

1369
01:18:56,571 --> 01:18:57,739
  - Okay we have a
  question here, yes,

1370
01:18:57,805 --> 01:18:58,973
  you sir, what is your name?

1371
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,541
- Hi, I'm Terry.

1372
01:19:00,608 --> 01:19:03,845
 When did you know you
 were Jesus Christ?

1373
01:19:04,212 --> 01:19:06,881
 - Ever since I was
 able to walk on water.

1374
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:09,450
- Would it make you feel
better if we had sex?

1375
01:19:09,517 --> 01:19:11,152
   - Jane you realize I
   can't allow aliens to take

1376
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:13,021
   you away from me?

1377
01:19:13,087 --> 01:19:14,789
 For if I were to sit
 idly by and allow your

1378
01:19:14,856 --> 01:19:16,758
 abduction to occur my
 heart would be empty

1379
01:19:16,824 --> 01:19:18,960
and my soul would
mourn for all eternity.

1380
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,664
- Silly, they'll
take both of us.

1381
01:19:23,965 --> 01:19:26,034
- The tribe has spoken.

1382
01:19:27,502 --> 01:19:29,704
 Hey isn't that a UFO?

1383
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:31,939
- Well according to this
we were supposed to hit

1384
01:19:32,006 --> 01:19:34,375
 the 54 freeway two inches ago.

1385
01:19:35,043 --> 01:19:37,812
   - Over there, you
   stay over there.

1386
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,114
  - But Jane I have the knife.

1387
01:19:40,181 --> 01:19:41,849
  - Well, I said put it down.

1388
01:19:43,351 --> 01:19:46,554
 - People are basically
 narrow-minded bigots,
 and jerk wads.

1389
01:19:47,221 --> 01:19:50,458
- I sure love this neighborhood.

1390
01:19:50,858 --> 01:19:52,660
 A lot of fine people.

1391
01:19:53,561 --> 01:19:55,596
 All lying in the road.

1392
01:19:56,564 --> 01:19:57,832
  - Who could that be?

1393
01:19:57,899 --> 01:20:01,636
Maybe it's some of your
friends from school (laughing).

1394
01:20:01,703 --> 01:20:03,037
 That's a joke!

1395
01:20:03,104 --> 01:20:05,606
   You don't have any
   friends except me.

- Somebody get off their
lazy ass and help me!

1406
01:20:39,107 --> 01:20:41,476
  Or at least bring me a beer.

   Beau Bridges played you
   in the movie of the week.

   - Yes. Yes he did.

1411
01:21:02,897 --> 01:21:06,901
 Though I thought his
 portrayal of my angst against

1412
01:21:06,968 --> 01:21:09,737
  society was a
  little melodramatic.

1413
01:21:16,978 --> 01:21:19,247
  - How dare you speak
  to me that way?

1414
01:21:19,313 --> 01:21:21,916
   I was just trying
   to protect you.

1415
01:21:21,983 --> 01:21:24,185

 Window people?

1417
01:21:37,265 --> 01:21:39,734
