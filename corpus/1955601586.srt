1
00:00:03,673 --> 00:00:04,940
Are you ready?

2
00:00:05,308 --> 00:00:07,243
I can't do it for you.

3
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:17,488
I had a dream about you.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,229
- What happened?
- You took the bullets out of my gun.

5
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:22,433
- Alvey doesn't need this fight.
- Is that him?

6
00:00:22,493 --> 00:00:24,577
- Should we come down on the number?
- Why would we do that?

7
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:26,033
Pony the fuck up.

8
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:28,508
It's a million fuckin' dollars.

9
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:30,330
Why are you being so mean?

10
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:33,713
Because I don't need your
unsatisfied, depressing shit.

11
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:38,036
Open the fuckin' door, Kayla.

12
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:39,754
She can hardly walk.

13
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:46,332
Let's do a third fight.
Just get back in, dude.

14
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,537
Make money with the
gift that God gave you.

15
00:00:50,547 --> 00:00:52,504
I am Sid fuckin' Vicious.

16
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:57,931
Get the fuck off me.

17
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:46,673
I baptize thou for the Father...

18
00:02:46,674 --> 00:02:50,010
and of the Son...

19
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:53,747
and of the Holy Spirit.

20
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,623
Thank you.

21
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,125
It's buzzing.

22
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,147
Shit.

23
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:14,443
Shh.

24
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:16,729
Sorry.

25
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,536
You answer that phone,
you're going straight to hell.

26
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:24,205
Come sit down...

27
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:27,420
for a sec.

28
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,793
When's the last time
you were in a church?

29
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:38,231
Besides a meeting?

30
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:43,192
When the boys were little
and we went on that church kick.

31
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:44,715
Yeah.

32
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:47,955
We were gonna show them the way.

33
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:54,127
Are you okay?

34
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:56,236
Yeah.

35
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:00,272
Just banged up. I'm fighting again.

36
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,687
God damn it.

37
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,151
Hey, would you stop?

38
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:08,468
I got to go.

39
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:11,484
Are you going to Jay's
for dinner tonight?

40
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:13,648
Wasn't asked.

41
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:17,812
You better go, grandma.

42
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:22,581
What's wrong?

43
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:24,919
Well, use another room.

44
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,892
You girls are driving me crazy.

45
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:32,542
Too bad Mac wasn't there.

46
00:05:33,026 --> 00:05:34,962
Yeah, he was on call.

47
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:38,684
I just got a text from Dan
and I got to go show a house.

48
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,968
Right now?

49
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:41,151
Yeah.

50
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:42,837
Even with your face like that?

51
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:49,277
Who punches a friend in the face?

52
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,179
I hit him first.

53
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,781
Crazy isn't cute.

54
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:57,280
It's not?

55
00:05:57,363 --> 00:05:58,698
Not when you have a daughter.

56
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:02,405
She loves me crazy.

57
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:05,714
You were wasted and you drove.

58
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:07,267
- You can't do that.
- I'm never gonna do it again.

59
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,534
- You always say that.
- I'm never gonna do it again.

60
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:09,476
I was kidding.

61
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:11,892
I fuckin' woke up this morning,
I felt like shit.

62
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,932
It's never gonna happen again.

63
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:21,832
What house are you showing?

64
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:23,824
Um...

65
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:27,581
It's a pocket listing
in Mar Vista, I think?

66
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:28,946
What time is your mom coming?

67
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,183
I told her six.

68
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:32,277
Can you pick this stuff
up from the store

69
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:34,377
on your way home for dinner?

70
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:41,355
You got it, boss.

71
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:43,998
I won't let you down.

72
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:46,725
You really want to impress me?

73
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,903
Go sell that fucking house.

74
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,175
So you just came in and he was gone?

75
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:56,677
No note? Nothing?

76
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:58,212
No.

77
00:06:58,391 --> 00:06:59,836
He got a phone?

78
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:01,614
He left it in his room.

79
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:03,542
That's not good.

80
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:05,601
What do you mean?

81
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:10,050
A lot of times, suicides
leave important shit behind.

82
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:11,879
Phones, wallets...

83
00:07:11,904 --> 00:07:14,035
They don't need'm anymore.

84
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:16,941
Yeah, I am... kinda worried.

85
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:18,780
He's been really depressed.

86
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:20,929
I bet he has.

87
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,874
Jesus Godamighty, can you imagine?

88
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,765
But, hey. Maybe he...

89
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,726
He just went off the grid.

90
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:31,539
I mean, a lot of times
I go to the pool,

91
00:07:31,563 --> 00:07:33,265
I leave the phone in the car, you know?

92
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:35,862
It's good to unplug.

93
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:39,362
But on a positive note,
you're looking well.

94
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:43,682
You got a suit on.
Put on some good weight.

95
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:46,495
You fitting in okay?

96
00:07:46,815 --> 00:07:47,893
Yeah.

97
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:49,120
Okay.

98
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:50,552
Good. Good.

99
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:57,093
Me, I'm...

100
00:07:57,094 --> 00:08:00,197
I'm actually retiring.

101
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:02,198
Good for you.

102
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,733
Well, I had to.

103
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,002
I got a whitehot case of shingles.

104
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:08,406
Felt like a goddamn harpoon
going through my chest.

105
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,041
Still got marks on my side.

106
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:13,343
Fucking wakeup call.

107
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:14,544
Gotta slow down.

108
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,613
Yeah.

109
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:19,142
You see, Keith,

110
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:20,662
you tell'm we're looking for him. Okay?

111
00:08:20,686 --> 00:08:21,786
Yeah.

112
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:24,892
Nice to see you
picking up the pieces, Ryan.

113
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:26,218
You stay the course?

114
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:49,413
Come on, come on!

115
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,453
- Come on!
- Come on! Hustle!

116
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:57,787
- Let's go!
- Okay!

117
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,857
Good. Good.

118
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,792
You good?

119
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,461
Keep working.

120
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:05,462
Keep working.

121
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:14,002
Right there. That...

122
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,885
That was your mistake.

123
00:09:16,744 --> 00:09:19,080
You gave up your back.

124
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:23,380
At some point, you... you got...
you gotta tap.

125
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,016
Dan, I am so sorry...

126
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,357
Jay...

127
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:31,201
You're fired.

128
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,037
I...

129
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:35,625
Dude, I gave you chances, okay.

130
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:37,560
I don't know hat world
you think you're living in,

131
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:38,827
but this is civilization

132
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:41,027
and you act like a fucking monkey.

133
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:43,701
You did more dumb shit in one night

134
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,235
than most people do in their career.

135
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,022
I've never seen anything like it.

136
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,657
All right, I have
a philosophy when I...

137
00:09:49,774 --> 00:09:51,968
When I hire an agent, okay?

138
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,577
I don't give a shit about experience.

139
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:56,905
Any retard can learn real estate.

140
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:59,444
I want a dynamic personality,
and guess what?

141
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,647
You got that, man. You do.

142
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:05,340
But you also have
a fucking screw loose.

143
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:07,962
Seriously. It's like you
don't want to succeed.

144
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,592
You don't want to thrive, man.

145
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,045
What do I do?! Tell me, because...

146
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:14,480
I can't work with that.

147
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:18,830
Do you have anything
you want to say to me?

148
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:27,503
Thank you for the opportunity.

149
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:29,347
I really appreciate it.

150
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:31,820
And I'm sorry it didn't work out.

151
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,282
All right. The final check
is going to go to your house,

152
00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:37,586
and I'm gonna need... I'm
gonna need your iPhone back.

153
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,306
Good luck out there, man. I...

154
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,937
Yeah?

155
00:11:03,681 --> 00:11:04,931
You in the middle of something?

156
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:06,002
No, come in.

157
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:09,886
That was nice, this morning.

158
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,855
It was.

159
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,590
You okay?

160
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,494
Yeah, we should talk about Nate.

161
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,796
Yeah. What's up? What's going on?

162
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:22,593
Garo's dragging his feet about
putting him on his next card.

163
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:23,637
Why?

164
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:24,867
I don't know. It's weird.

165
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:27,237
He's just kind of not responding.

166
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:29,669
Fuck'm, put him on another promotion.

167
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,755
He needs a fight. He's got momentum.

168
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,876
I agree.

169
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,744
And Ryan? What about Ryan?

170
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:37,849
Garo wants to put him on your card.

171
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:39,149
Comain event.

172
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:41,716
Not gonna happen.

173
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:43,606
You'll be fighting last.

174
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:44,771
No. Not doing it.

175
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,188
Your name will be bigger.
What is the problem?

176
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:48,466
No. Geez, I don't know, Lisa.

177
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:50,037
What is the fucking problem?

178
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:52,875
I'm doing one fucking fight. One.

179
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:55,063
I mean, all the cards in the world...

180
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:57,117
He's got to be on my fucking card?
He can't wait four weeks?

181
00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:58,924
It's not Ryan. It's Garo.

182
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:00,868
This is a big event.

183
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:02,937
He is paying you a million dollars.

184
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:05,207
Do you really want to make
a big deal out of this?

185
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:08,184
I'm not doing a comain event. Okay?

186
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,710
It's not what I signed up for.

187
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:11,511
He can be on the card,
but he can't be comain.

188
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,994
Okay. I'll relay the message.

189
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:25,669
Hey. I want you to try some of this.

190
00:12:25,883 --> 00:12:27,188
What is it?

191
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,317
Whey. Grassfed.

192
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:31,969
Super fucking clean.

193
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,641
There's vanilla. I got chocolate, too.

194
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:40,897
Not bad.

195
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,194
Nice, right? Natural.

196
00:12:44,585 --> 00:12:46,616
Hey. It's on me.

197
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:48,522
Thanks.

198
00:12:58,256 --> 00:12:59,958
Watching you and Alvey today.

199
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:03,781
You guys have been working
together for a while, right?

200
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:05,772
Long time.

201
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:06,891
Yeah.

202
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:10,745
I kind of...

203
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,877
Kind of noticed something.

204
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:17,284
If I may.

205
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:19,166
By all means.

206
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:24,161
When you jab, you leave
that front leg wide open.

207
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:26,591
No, I'm angled away. It's safe.

208
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:29,396
Not if he steps over the left foot.

209
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:32,352
Right?

210
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:34,495
Hey, Alvey.

211
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:36,310
How you doing?

212
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:43,872
I got a class. Catch you guys later.

213
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,605
Hey, Lisa tell you I'm on the card?

214
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:52,040
Yeah, she did.

215
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,582
You're cool with that, right?

216
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:56,887
We'll figure out. This you?

217
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,363
Yeah.

218
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:03,011
You don't clean up after yourself?

219
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,245
I just used it.

220
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:06,928
Wash your fucking dishes, man.
All right?

221
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,620
There's other people here.

222
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,457
Can I get another one of these?

223
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:33,410
So, there's a crib, and a pack 'n play,

224
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:35,170
changing table.

225
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:41,163
Jay took some of it, but
a lot of it's boy stuff, so...

226
00:14:41,484 --> 00:14:43,875
Thank you. This is really helpful.

227
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,593
No problem.

228
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:51,211
So, how's Mac?
Is he taking care of you?

229
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:53,242
He's trying to.

230
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,047
Are you guys getting married?

231
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,453
No.

232
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:59,063
It's more like just friends.

233
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:00,285
He really wants to be involved.

234
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:02,008
Good.

235
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:03,692
He's a good one.

236
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:06,653
Could've been worse.

237
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,195
Take whatever you want.
Just lock up before you go.

238
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:15,303
Okay.

239
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,169
I've been in a really...

240
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:23,296
I've been in a shitty mood lately, too.

241
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:25,623
Everything pisses me off.

242
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,818
That could be
withdrawal from the Lexapro.

243
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:34,795
I also got this pain

244
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:39,640
running down both my arms,
my hands are numb, my back.

245
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:41,882
Fucking with my sleep.

246
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:44,005
Were you injured?

247
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:45,165
No.

248
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:47,571
Not that kind of pain. It's...

249
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:53,165
It's like... It's like...
I feel something coming on.

250
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,052
Have you seen a doctor?

251
00:15:56,146 --> 00:15:57,416
Mnhmnh. No.

252
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,574
I wanted to talk to you
about it, you know?

253
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:02,580
Since I'm coming off
the medication that, you know,

254
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:05,705
maybe it's causing some kind
of misfire, you know?

255
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,336
Nervewise.

256
00:16:08,994 --> 00:16:10,008
Possible.

257
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:12,594
I mean, I've never seen it.

258
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,358
I would really like you
to go see a doctor

259
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:20,825
to rule out anything structural
or neurological.

260
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,545
See, this is what I'm talking about.
This is what I'm concerned about, doc.

261
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:26,623
I...

262
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:29,061
I have been hit in the head a lot.

263
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,475
You mean CTE?

264
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:36,359
Parkinson's,

265
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:39,382
CTE, all of it.

266
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:44,874
Is that common among MMA fighters?

267
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,724
You know, it's common
among fighters, period.

268
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,992
You get hit in the head.
Yeah, MMA fighters,

269
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:53,389
fighting... just... Whatever.

270
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:54,795
I mean, I don't know.

271
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:57,232
What does it even fucking matter?

272
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,912
First tremor, I'm putting
a bullet in my head.

273
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:07,970
When's the pain the worst?

274
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:14,736
The morning.

275
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:19,017
And at night.

276
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:26,194
Times when you're typically alone?

277
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:36,840
It's all I can fucking think about.

278
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:43,989
'Sup, brother?

279
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:45,653
You done for the day?

280
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:47,830
Alvey's got an appointment.

281
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:52,424
Shit, I can hold some pads for you.

282
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:54,752
Want to get some extra work in?

283
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:58,526
No, man, you're leaving. It's all good.

284
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:03,402
Bro, where the fuck
am I going? Come on.

285
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:05,393
You sure you don't mind?

286
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,184
Get your ass in there, come on.

287
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:08,825
Get some work in.

288
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,255
You know what the worst mistake
in hu... in human history was?

289
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,323
You know what the worst mistake
in human history was?

290
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:25,766
Anyone?

291
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,995
It's... It's a little controversial.

292
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,120
The worst mistake
in human history was...

293
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,737
Agricultural revolution.

294
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,233
Once we learned how to plant crops,

295
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:45,624
we effectively enslaved ourselves.

296
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,960
We used to be nomads.
We used to forage and hunt.

297
00:18:51,014 --> 00:18:55,160
I'm hungry, I'm gonna grab
a fig out of the tree.

298
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:56,932
A turnip out of the ground.

299
00:18:57,018 --> 00:18:59,588
Take a nap. Fuck a little.

300
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:01,957
Now you just... it's all work.

301
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:04,456
I mean, that's all you do
is work, you know?

302
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:09,263
You c... you c... you clear
the fields, you till the soil,

303
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:12,300
you plant the seed,
you water it, you harvest it,

304
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:14,105
you put it into a silo.

305
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:18,784
And even when you have enough,
it's like all you want is more.

306
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:22,893
And this has made us violent,

307
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:26,402
and... and bloodthirsty,
'cause we don't roam.

308
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,255
We just... We settle into one spot.

309
00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:33,388
And we acquire possessions,
and we shit out babies,

310
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:35,800
and we get real territorial.

311
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,291
No, I'm not gonna walk away.

312
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:39,293
No, I'm gonna fight
to the fucking death!

313
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:40,815
That's what we do now.

314
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,558
Because...

315
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:46,792
You know, because
we don't roam anymore.

316
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:51,317
And we don't know there's
a big fucking fig tree,

317
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:54,540
a sweet, ripe, plump fig tree
right over the hill.

318
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,408
We're all just...

319
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:03,843
slaves to...

320
00:20:05,175 --> 00:20:07,344
wheat, and corn, and potatoes,

321
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:09,796
and famine, and bloodshed...

322
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:16,406
We're not what we were meant to be.

323
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:20,480
Agricultural revolution.

324
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:23,887
Anyway, I'm gonna go to the...
The grocery store rright now.

325
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,629
So, I wish everybody here
a wonderful afternoon.

326
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,762
Don't work too hard.

327
00:20:34,282 --> 00:20:36,287
Nice. Nice.

328
00:20:38,853 --> 00:20:39,858
Nice! Oooh.

329
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:42,389
All right.

330
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,325
Loose, loose, loose.

331
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,627
When you come in, jab step,

332
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:47,893
right hand. All right?

333
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:49,983
You got it.

334
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:57,405
Hey.

335
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,594
Yeah?

336
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:00,753
First, you coming in
with the jab, right?

337
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:01,947
Yeah.

338
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,026
Fake the takedown,
come with that power.

339
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:07,659
I strike to the takedown.
It's... It works for me.

340
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:10,118
I understand, I understand.
It's a little predictable.

341
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:13,485
Won me a lot of fights.

342
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,414
Listen to me.

343
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,193
You got KO power in your hands, right?

344
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:20,180
I feel it. I feel it.

345
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:22,262
I see it when you're hitting
mitts with Alvey. All right?

346
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:24,241
He flinches every time you let one go.

347
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,268
You got dynamite in your fucking fist.

348
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:29,006
Fucking use it.

349
00:21:29,631 --> 00:21:30,705
Let it go.

350
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,959
Dom?

351
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:36,446
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

352
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:38,513
Alvey doesn't want you to coach Ryan.

353
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:39,866
That's not why you're here.

354
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:41,563
He asked for my help. Alvey isn't here.

355
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,159
Dom! Let's fucking work.

356
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:44,185
Let's work!

357
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,985
I got to go.

358
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:51,086
Hey!

359
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:09,811
You fucking cunt.

360
00:22:10,723 --> 00:22:11,895
Dom!

361
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:13,891
My office. Now.

362
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:18,774
There's Vaseline in the lounge.

363
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:20,922
I'll bite down on my pad.

364
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:26,561
Hey, coach.

365
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,232
Shut the door.

366
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:34,347
I thought I made myself
clear about Ryan.

367
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,146
You absolutely did.

368
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:38,138
The fuck you doing
in the cage with him?

369
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:40,472
He just wanted to
get work in, that's it.

370
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:43,309
He got his work in before I left, Dom.

371
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:45,028
I...

372
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,732
I was literally holding pads.
Hand to God...

373
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,309
I'm not gonna deal with this bullshit!

374
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,950
You understand?
I don't have fucking time.

375
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,387
You get a warning today.

376
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,025
Nate and Ryan need one
fucking voice in their head.

377
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,285
You understand? That's mine.

378
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:58,384
You start contradicting the shit I say,

379
00:22:58,446 --> 00:22:59,839
you confuse my fighter.

380
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:01,466
You confuse my fighter,
we got a problem.

381
00:23:01,495 --> 00:23:02,510
Are we clear?

382
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,151
Yes. Yes.

383
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,832
I apologize.

384
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:07,361
You do it again, you're out.

385
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:09,050
I understand, and I apologize.

386
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:11,503
I apologize.

387
00:23:12,988 --> 00:23:15,980
You're just... You're just
figuring the place out still.

388
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:19,245
I'm enjoying myself.

389
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:21,261
I mean, you set up a great
culture here, you know?

390
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:22,353
All right. Dom, we're done.

391
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:23,777
Just get the fuck out of my office.

392
00:23:28,556 --> 00:23:29,924
Ooh, he's cute.

393
00:23:31,548 --> 00:23:33,743
And British, which is awesome.

394
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,454
He's a US citizen now.

395
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,821
Yeah, but he's got that accent.

396
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:41,157
I'm a sucker for a British accent.

397
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:44,083
Or Australian. It's very hot.

398
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:47,970
But you... you...
You have to watch that.

399
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,635
Everything they say will
sound like a royal decree.

400
00:23:50,745 --> 00:23:52,657
It makes you feel too stupid to talk.

401
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:56,133
He's not like that.
He's from Manchester.

402
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:57,783
It's kind of, like, a rough area.

403
00:23:57,907 --> 00:24:00,276
Well, good. I don't
want you to feel inferior.

404
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:04,493
I don't.

405
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:13,012
Are you sure you want to be
in a relationship?

406
00:24:14,762 --> 00:24:16,027
Why wouldn't I?

407
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:18,566
Aww. You haven't done this before.

408
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:21,953
I mean, you might not even know
what kind of guy you like.

409
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,278
Maybe you need to go
through a couple of them

410
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,547
before you settle down.

411
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,981
I'm not settled down.

412
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:28,597
It sounds like you are.

413
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:32,057
Nate, he gave you a key.

414
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,838
Dad doesn't even know yet.

415
00:24:41,996 --> 00:24:44,065
Is Will pushing you to come out?

416
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:46,948
No. No, he gets it.

417
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:51,505
Well then,
it's none of your dad's business

418
00:24:51,506 --> 00:24:52,581
until you're ready.

419
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:55,088
It's your life.

420
00:24:57,862 --> 00:24:59,760
You guys heard from Jay?

421
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:02,331
Not yet. Did you call him?

422
00:25:02,415 --> 00:25:04,117
Yeah, it says his phone
is disconnected.

423
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,345
Will you try him?

424
00:25:05,735 --> 00:25:07,431
Yeah.

425
00:26:01,573 --> 00:26:02,901
Hey, Lisa.

426
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:05,032
How'd your little chat go?

427
00:26:05,135 --> 00:26:06,425
Shh.

428
00:26:06,946 --> 00:26:08,698
Can't say I didn't warn you.

429
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:12,654
So, your... your top fighter
asked me to train.

430
00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:14,178
What am I supposed to do?

431
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:16,702
You're not supposed to train him.

432
00:26:16,936 --> 00:26:18,342
He asked me.

433
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,413
And then he played you against Alvey

434
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,147
and got Alvey's attention.

435
00:26:23,597 --> 00:26:26,233
I fucking hate politics.
I fucking hate it.

436
00:26:26,404 --> 00:26:28,406
Then don't be fucking political.

437
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,983
How do I fix this?

438
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:35,702
Leave it alone.

439
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,727
He'll forget about you
in a couple of days.

440
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:43,641
How do I fix it with you?

441
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:46,446
We're good.

442
00:26:46,587 --> 00:26:48,102
You want to have a drink with me?

443
00:26:48,222 --> 00:26:50,591
My God. You can't be serious.

444
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:53,603
Are you kidding me?
I can't do that either?

445
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:55,294
I mean, I got to fucking write a list

446
00:26:55,295 --> 00:26:56,333
of all the things I can't do.

447
00:26:56,357 --> 00:26:57,997
Don't train Ryan,
don't drink with Lisa...

448
00:26:58,098 --> 00:27:00,300
Don't be a smartass.

449
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:02,056
I feel like a dumb-ass.

450
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,722
I feel like a dumb-ass after today.

451
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,090
Have a drink with me.

452
00:27:10,502 --> 00:27:11,855
Come on.

453
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:21,392
She go down okay?

454
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:22,829
Yeah. Finally.

455
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:27,027
You need a glass of wine.

456
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:38,299
Are your parents still together?

457
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:41,208
Sorry, what?

458
00:27:41,423 --> 00:27:43,076
Are your parents still married?

459
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:45,579
- Yeah.
- How long?

460
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:47,047
Umm...

461
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:48,637
42 years I think.

462
00:27:50,598 --> 00:27:53,036
That's amazing.

463
00:27:53,676 --> 00:27:54,989
I bet your mom is beautiful.

464
00:27:56,692 --> 00:28:00,496
Please just fucking sleep.

465
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:03,931
Do you want me to try?

466
00:28:04,577 --> 00:28:06,655
No, it's ok. She'll... She'll stop.

467
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,092
Sorry.

468
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:20,546
Hi.

469
00:28:20,547 --> 00:28:22,281
Where the fuck have you been?

470
00:28:22,282 --> 00:28:24,617
At work.

471
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:26,753
You're three hours late.

472
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,310
Yeah. Dan insisted on cocktails.

473
00:28:30,394 --> 00:28:32,330
Why is your phone disconnected?

474
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:34,209
My phone was stolen at the bar,

475
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:36,038
so Dan had to disconnect it.

476
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:38,913
For security reasons.

477
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:42,569
Because it's a company phone,
but fear not.

478
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:45,395
I took it upon myself
to upgrade dinner.

479
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:48,108
Steaks.

480
00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:50,708
$30 a pop!

481
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:51,911
And...

482
00:28:54,681 --> 00:28:57,328
A bottle of French wine...

483
00:28:58,024 --> 00:29:00,119
highly rated in the low 90s

484
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,680
with hints of wet leather,
soil, and currants.

485
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:07,386
Look at me.

486
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,899
You're fucking high.
I can't fucking believe you!

487
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:25,849
It's... Dan insisted on a few drinks.

488
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:28,239
Why?

489
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:29,850
Drumroll, please.

490
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:32,736
Because I...

491
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:36,068
sold a house today.

492
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:37,884
That's great.

493
00:29:38,892 --> 00:29:40,093
That is great.

494
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:45,068
Thank you.

495
00:29:45,332 --> 00:29:47,099
It's just an offer,

496
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:50,217
but it is above asking,

497
00:29:50,242 --> 00:29:54,358
which is exactly what
we were looking for.

498
00:29:59,446 --> 00:30:02,139
So, I'm gonna get cleaned up,

499
00:30:03,694 --> 00:30:05,885
make myself appropriate,
use the facilities,

500
00:30:05,886 --> 00:30:07,387
and then we can get cooking.

501
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:11,171
What do you say? You hungry?

502
00:30:12,585 --> 00:30:14,335
Starving.

503
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:37,117
Just a minute.

504
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,151
- Open the door.
- Just a second.

505
00:30:39,152 --> 00:30:43,046
Open it.

506
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,571
You're blowing it.

507
00:31:00,574 --> 00:31:02,180
What are you on?

508
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,313
You on coke?

509
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:10,015
Let me see your pockets.

510
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,813
Get out of my house.

511
00:31:23,964 --> 00:31:25,198
You're scaring her.

512
00:31:25,244 --> 00:31:26,741
This is not your home.

513
00:31:28,535 --> 00:31:29,703
Please leave.

514
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:31,453
No.

515
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:34,541
I want you to leave.

516
00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:46,459
Mnh.

517
00:31:48,822 --> 00:31:50,381
Okay.

518
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:28,192
Yep, I'm here.

519
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:32,265
Yeah, it's in Venice.

520
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:33,864
Cash.

521
00:32:35,068 --> 00:32:36,130
Enzo.

522
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:40,046
No, it's not a problem.

523
00:32:40,737 --> 00:32:42,362
I don't have a preference.

524
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:46,385
That's fine.

525
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:50,096
Natural?

526
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,466
Sure.

527
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:57,176
Ten o'clock, latest.

528
00:32:58,331 --> 00:32:59,762
Can't do any later.

529
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:02,550
Yeah?

530
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:05,714
That's great. Thank you, sweetheart.

531
00:33:17,743 --> 00:33:20,431
How are the steaks?

532
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,665
How's your steak?

533
00:33:25,486 --> 00:33:26,852
It's good.

534
00:33:26,853 --> 00:33:27,986
Let me see.

535
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:37,340
Look. At. That.

536
00:33:38,164 --> 00:33:39,898
Goddamn thing of beauty.

537
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:41,254
It's not too done, is it?

538
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,869
- Nope.
- No?

539
00:33:43,508 --> 00:33:44,871
I take mine rare.

540
00:33:44,977 --> 00:33:47,107
Knock off the horns and wipe the ass.

541
00:33:57,951 --> 00:34:00,845
Is that a... baby crying?

542
00:34:02,462 --> 00:34:04,223
Am I wrong? What the fuck? Am I wrong?

543
00:34:04,224 --> 00:34:05,630
Is that a baby crying?

544
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:07,739
Are you... are you gonna pick her up?

545
00:34:07,787 --> 00:34:08,955
When I'm finished.

546
00:34:08,995 --> 00:34:10,333
Well, then, I'll pick her up.

547
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:11,919
No, you won't pick her up.

548
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,958
Rowr!

549
00:34:16,536 --> 00:34:17,736
Tiger mom.

550
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:22,385
We could've used one
of those, Nathaniel?

551
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:44,642
If we're not gonna do anything,

552
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,494
then maybe we just kill
the fucking monitor.

553
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:50,403
You want me to turn
this baby monitor off?

554
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:52,371
Well, if it just doesn't matter
that she's crying,

555
00:34:52,372 --> 00:34:54,254
then I don't know why we
have to fucking listen to it.

556
00:34:54,278 --> 00:34:57,915
Do you have any idea how fucking
gross you are right now?!

557
00:34:58,111 --> 00:35:00,045
Drunk and high like a fucking loser.

558
00:35:00,046 --> 00:35:01,373
You have a daughter, Jay!

559
00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:03,174
I know that because
of the fucking crying

560
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,734
that I hear for her mother.

561
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:07,196
I am disgusted by you.

562
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:09,303
I'm a monster, right?

563
00:35:12,054 --> 00:35:14,223
Fuck you, Amy.

564
00:35:14,317 --> 00:35:15,389
Yeah.

565
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:16,205
Do better.

566
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:17,329
Jay, shut the fuck up.

567
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,697
Nate, she's bringing up an issue,

568
00:35:18,698 --> 00:35:19,798
but it's not the real issue.

569
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:21,166
The real issue, right, is class.

570
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:22,287
You can't let this go!

571
00:35:22,312 --> 00:35:24,646
No, no, 'cause we
are white fucking trash,

572
00:35:26,615 --> 00:35:30,240
and she can't believe
that she got stuck with us.

573
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,138
And a baby, no less.

574
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:35,036
You see this?

575
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:41,169
$30 steak.

576
00:35:43,598 --> 00:35:45,434
Means shit to me.

577
00:35:45,558 --> 00:35:49,028
Means shit to me 'cause I am who I am.

578
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,294
And I'll eat scraps
out of a fucking gutter.

579
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,153
I'll dig a fucking ditch.

580
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:41,677
I'm out. You want a ride?

581
00:36:42,107 --> 00:36:43,872
Whoa, we're done?

582
00:36:44,017 --> 00:36:45,279
Yeah. You want a ride?

583
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:47,321
It's early. Where you going?

584
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:48,468
Home.

585
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,508
To do what?

586
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:52,141
To do whatever
the fuck it is I want to.

587
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:53,578
- Hey.
- Thanks for the drinks.

588
00:36:53,603 --> 00:36:54,720
Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Come on.

589
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:55,941
Before you go... Before you go...

590
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:56,996
Sir?

591
00:36:57,234 --> 00:36:58,936
Sir, can we get two shots of añejo?

592
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,065
No, no, I'm good.

593
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,158
The good shit up top?

594
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:03,699
Come on.

595
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:05,441
Before you go, before you go...

596
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,841
You want to play a game of chance?

597
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:10,579
What's the game?

598
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:11,795
What's the game?

599
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:14,881
You sure you want to know my game?

600
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,217
You don't even have one.

601
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:17,384
No, I do.

602
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:18,842
Don't be scared.

603
00:37:20,316 --> 00:37:22,613
But, I got to... I need
to know if I can trust you.

604
00:37:22,678 --> 00:37:24,965
Now, see, are you gonna
be honest with me?

605
00:37:25,006 --> 00:37:27,605
I don't know. That's really your call.

606
00:37:29,126 --> 00:37:30,355
I can trust you.

607
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,581
You got an honest face.

608
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:32,668
Get on with the fucking game.

609
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:33,784
Okay, okay.

610
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,363
I have to guess three things

611
00:37:38,138 --> 00:37:40,560
that you're gonna do
when you get home tonight.

612
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,481
Now, if I'm wrong... I'm never wrong...

613
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,388
I take both shots.

614
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:48,669
Now, if I'm right,

615
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:50,575
you take a shot with me

616
00:37:51,732 --> 00:37:53,794
and we keep on drinking.

617
00:37:58,129 --> 00:37:59,764
How many guesses?

618
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:01,115
Shit, I'm gonna go three for three.

619
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:02,134
Cocky.

620
00:38:02,189 --> 00:38:03,915
I'm not cocky. I'm desperate.

621
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:08,822
You ready?

622
00:38:08,847 --> 00:38:09,911
- You sure?
- Yeah.

623
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,990
Okay.

624
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:12,302
In no particular order...

625
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:13,328
Okay.

626
00:38:14,813 --> 00:38:16,055
Number one...

627
00:38:17,345 --> 00:38:19,922
When you get home,

628
00:38:21,723 --> 00:38:23,991
you're gonna pour yourself
a glass of wine.

629
00:38:24,311 --> 00:38:27,166
I'm also going to brush
my teeth and go to sleep.

630
00:38:27,229 --> 00:38:28,245
Those are easy ones. They don't count.

631
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:29,494
I'm warming up.

632
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,041
I'm on my move... I'm gonna get there.

633
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:32,455
- Okay.
- I'm gonna get in there.

634
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,642
Number two. Number two...

635
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:38,934
Tchtchtchtchtch tchtchtchtch.

636
00:38:39,206 --> 00:38:40,607
Don't slap me.

637
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,145
I can't promise anything.

638
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,123
You may get a little upset.

639
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:47,316
When you go home,

640
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:50,698
you're gonna get yourself off.

641
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:54,113
You have no fucking class at all.

642
00:38:54,144 --> 00:38:55,706
Was I wrong?

643
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:57,055
What, that's...

644
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:59,306
- My bad. Am I wrong?
- Go to the next question.

645
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:00,556
Thank you.

646
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:03,824
Number three.

647
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,587
Number three...

648
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:09,463
When you go home,

649
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,635
you're gonna cry about some shit

650
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:17,881
that's not even your fault.

651
00:39:30,697 --> 00:39:32,401
Who'd you talk to?

652
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:35,883
A few people told me.

653
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,985
They... they love you.

654
00:39:42,283 --> 00:39:43,672
It wasn't gossip.

655
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:03,473
Can we have two more shots?

656
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:10,512
- Hey.
- Enzo?

657
00:40:10,552 --> 00:40:11,887
Yeah. Come on in.

658
00:40:18,906 --> 00:40:20,116
Drink?

659
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:21,530
I don't drink.

660
00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:27,272
They told you everything?

661
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:28,882
They did, indeed.

662
00:40:36,697 --> 00:40:37,893
Thanks.

663
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:50,671
Okay.

664
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:52,425
So...

665
00:40:53,574 --> 00:40:55,050
Where do you want me?

666
00:40:55,615 --> 00:40:56,902
The bed?

667
00:40:57,979 --> 00:40:59,074
The bed.

668
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:54,843
You on the pill?

669
00:41:54,883 --> 00:41:55,897
What?

670
00:41:55,922 --> 00:41:57,013
Are you on the pill?

671
00:41:57,038 --> 00:41:58,101
Yeah. Shut the fuck up.

672
00:41:58,126 --> 00:42:00,561
My God. My God.

673
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,957
My God. My God.

674
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,595
- Fuck.
- Shit.

675
00:42:12,681 --> 00:42:14,016
Fuck.

676
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,035
Shit.

677
00:42:18,174 --> 00:42:20,286
Where you going?

678
00:42:20,477 --> 00:42:22,770
Shit.

679
00:42:28,321 --> 00:42:30,309
You're fucking wild, man.

680
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:31,507
Dom?

681
00:42:31,743 --> 00:42:32,786
'Sup?

682
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,247
I'll see you tomorrow.

683
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:42,271
Wow. Just like that?

684
00:42:42,482 --> 00:42:44,122
Are you serious?

685
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:47,825
I think you had a pretty
fucking good time tonight.

686
00:42:49,873 --> 00:42:53,177
All right.

687
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,997
You drive safe, all right?

688
00:43:01,168 --> 00:43:02,184
Yep.

689
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:22,889
I got fired today.

690
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:27,857
Why?

691
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:33,407
Numerous offenses.

692
00:43:37,671 --> 00:43:39,750
You told Amy you sold a house.

693
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,229
Yeah, I did that so
that she wouldn't get mad at me

694
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:44,143
when I came home all fucked up.

695
00:43:44,144 --> 00:43:48,048
You gotta combine a positive
with a negative.

696
00:43:48,457 --> 00:43:50,595
Like, I'm wasted,

697
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:53,830
but I'm celebrating.

698
00:43:55,306 --> 00:43:56,931
Sweet and sour.

699
00:43:57,694 --> 00:43:59,259
Sugar and poison.

700
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:03,763
There are the
fundamental building blocks

701
00:44:03,764 --> 00:44:05,537
of a healthy relationship.

702
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,092
You can try it on Will.

703
00:44:08,368 --> 00:44:12,607
You can call me and say thank you.

704
00:44:24,698 --> 00:44:26,424
She's trying with you.

705
00:44:30,073 --> 00:44:31,846
I know, but, it...

706
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,166
It's, like, hard.

707
00:44:41,205 --> 00:44:42,276
She's got...

708
00:44:46,973 --> 00:44:49,160
one foot out the door.

709
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:54,574
I'm just giving her,
you know, a little push.

710
00:44:55,268 --> 00:44:56,605
It's not a joke.

711
00:44:57,551 --> 00:44:59,051
You gonna lose them.

712
00:45:00,684 --> 00:45:02,457
Maybe it's better.

713
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:05,618
Yeah, I mean,

714
00:45:05,673 --> 00:45:08,342
she can bring Maya to Wisconsin.

715
00:45:12,899 --> 00:45:14,946
She's got a really good family.

716
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:18,571
Her dad is a, um...

717
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:22,297
He's an actuary
which is, like, a, um...

718
00:45:22,729 --> 00:45:25,599
It's like the elite form of accounting

719
00:45:25,886 --> 00:45:29,415
'cause they have money
put on their back

720
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:31,308
in order to predict the future.

721
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,123
It's... it's a better life.

722
00:45:40,127 --> 00:45:42,142
That is so fucking weak.

723
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,109
I'm a very weak man.

724
00:46:05,185 --> 00:46:07,079
I thought you wanted a family.

725
00:46:10,031 --> 00:46:11,814
I want for nothing.

726
00:46:13,388 --> 00:46:17,399
I just... I accept what comes my way.

727
00:46:24,237 --> 00:46:25,954
Can I ask you something?

728
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:28,071
Yeah.

729
00:46:28,142 --> 00:46:30,767
When you were getting
fucking shitfaced today,

730
00:46:31,991 --> 00:46:34,189
and you got fired
from your fucking job...

731
00:46:39,145 --> 00:46:41,251
acting like an asshole at dinner,

732
00:46:42,189 --> 00:46:45,251
did you think for one second
about your fucking daughter?

733
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,141
I mean, do you want to be
a part of Maya's life or not?

734
00:46:53,954 --> 00:46:56,688
I accept what comes my way.

735
00:47:04,311 --> 00:47:05,485
Well...

736
00:47:09,012 --> 00:47:10,481
I don't respect that.

737
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,719
Nathaniel,

738
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,543
you have so much to learn, man.

739
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:21,980
You have so much to fucking learn.

740
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:48,620
Yeah.

741
00:48:06,973 --> 00:48:08,230
Again?

742
00:48:08,408 --> 00:48:10,105
I must be on your mind.

743
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,285
How was dinner with the boys?

744
00:48:12,694 --> 00:48:13,922
Disaster.

745
00:48:14,176 --> 00:48:15,199
What happened?

746
00:48:15,348 --> 00:48:18,738
Jay disappeared,
and then he came home high.

747
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:20,465
Fuck, really?

748
00:48:21,363 --> 00:48:23,199
Fucking kid loves chaos.

749
00:48:23,323 --> 00:48:25,035
Yeah, I wonder where he gets that from.

750
00:48:25,253 --> 00:48:27,425
Mnh. You?

751
00:48:27,725 --> 00:48:30,305
No, that would be you.

752
00:48:30,397 --> 00:48:33,071
Me? I'm fucking stable.
You're... you're a gypsy.

753
00:48:33,266 --> 00:48:34,899
Where do you even live?

754
00:48:35,126 --> 00:48:37,040
I live in your dreams.

755
00:48:38,004 --> 00:48:39,961
That's right.

756
00:48:40,325 --> 00:48:41,531
You do.

757
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,546
There anything else about that
dream you want to tell me?

758
00:48:45,709 --> 00:48:47,123
Like what?

759
00:48:47,148 --> 00:48:49,686
Like... did we fuck?

760
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,780
Did we fuck?

761
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:54,149
You really wanna know?

762
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:56,049
Well, I'm curious.

763
00:48:58,008 --> 00:48:59,674
No.

764
00:49:00,557 --> 00:49:02,900
You gave me too much heroin.
I couldn't get a hardon.

765
00:49:02,996 --> 00:49:05,908
You must be getting old.

766
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:08,729
What are you wearing?

767
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:34,708
Keith?

768
00:49:48,842 --> 00:49:50,639
Keith?

769
00:50:01,372 --> 00:50:02,807
Keith?

770
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:13,230
Hey, man, where have you been, dude?

771
00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:15,730
I thought you fucking
killed yourself, dude.

772
00:50:17,012 --> 00:50:18,304
Dude.

773
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,348
What the fuck happened to you?

774
00:50:20,473 --> 00:50:22,402
Are the police looking for me?

775
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:24,685
Yeah. What the fuck happened, man?

776
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,552
I fell down the side of the highway.

777
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,904
We gotta get you to a hospital.

778
00:50:32,038 --> 00:50:33,789
No.

779
00:50:33,896 --> 00:50:35,164
Yeah, dude. Keith...

780
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:36,489
No.

781
00:50:36,641 --> 00:50:38,102
Keith.

782
00:50:38,586 --> 00:50:40,735
Keith, you're fucking bleeding, man.

783
00:50:42,335 --> 00:50:44,069
I am bleeding,

784
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:47,311
but can we go in the morning?

785
00:50:49,053 --> 00:50:52,374
I'd just like to spend
one more night here.

786
00:50:53,553 --> 00:50:54,600
Please?

787
00:50:55,842 --> 00:50:58,834
Please, Ryan, and then... Then I'll go.

788
00:50:59,746 --> 00:51:03,725
You can... can have
this whole place to yourself.

789
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,521
Keith.

790
00:51:06,986 --> 00:51:08,826
I don't want this place.

791
00:51:13,178 --> 00:51:14,443
Why not?

792
00:51:17,497 --> 00:51:19,896
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

793
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:23,873
What?

794
00:51:29,209 --> 00:51:30,248
What?

795
00:51:30,677 --> 00:51:32,171
Come on, man.

796
00:51:32,545 --> 00:51:33,680
Nobody wants...

797
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:35,519
What?

798
00:51:35,582 --> 00:51:37,671
Nobody wants to live here.

799
00:51:37,884 --> 00:51:39,148
Let's...

800
00:51:43,156 --> 00:51:46,157
I don't want you to look at me.

801
00:51:46,247 --> 00:51:48,048
Come on, man. Come on, buddy.

802
00:51:49,837 --> 00:51:51,164
Hey.

803
00:51:51,415 --> 00:51:53,050
Why you crying, man?

804
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:56,878
I don't want you to look at me.

805
00:51:56,954 --> 00:51:58,542
Why you crying?

806
00:51:59,172 --> 00:52:02,238
No, hey. Hey, I got you dude.

807
00:52:02,822 --> 00:52:03,823
I got you.

808
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:06,603
Keith.

809
00:52:06,713 --> 00:52:08,330
Buddy.

810
00:52:08,448 --> 00:52:10,353
I got you, buddy. Come here.

811
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:13,713
It's all good, man. There no...

812
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:27,233
Come here. I got you. I got you.

813
00:52:28,735 --> 00:52:31,071
- Shh.
- I got...

814
00:52:32,978 --> 00:52:34,907
It's okay. It's okay.

815
00:52:35,008 --> 00:52:36,423
Hey, I got you, man.

816
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:38,478
I got you, buddy, okay?

817
00:52:39,112 --> 00:52:40,181
Shh.

818
00:52:50,623 --> 00:52:52,716
You wanna stop somewhere to eat?

819
00:52:52,892 --> 00:52:54,160
Get a burger?

820
00:52:59,899 --> 00:53:02,430
Keith, they're not gonna
put you to sleep, dude.

821
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:07,673
Probably just gonna
extend your probation

822
00:53:07,674 --> 00:53:09,032
for cutting off the monitor.

823
00:53:09,142 --> 00:53:10,797
I'm not coming back, Ryan.

824
00:53:11,217 --> 00:53:12,985
Sure you are, dude.

825
00:53:13,212 --> 00:53:15,247
We'll get you sorted out
with the police.

826
00:53:15,248 --> 00:53:16,748
We'll get you under a doctor's care.

827
00:53:16,749 --> 00:53:18,977
You'll be back before
you know it, okay?

828
00:53:20,386 --> 00:53:21,788
Turn right up here.

829
00:53:22,376 --> 00:53:24,173
What?

830
00:53:24,457 --> 00:53:25,924
Ryan, just turn right.

831
00:53:25,925 --> 00:53:27,492
- Why?
- Please, just turn right!

832
00:53:27,493 --> 00:53:29,128
Okay, all right. Calm down.

833
00:53:34,267 --> 00:53:37,160
Keep going.

834
00:53:40,106 --> 00:53:42,129
Okay, you're gonna stop here.

835
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:43,910
Where?

836
00:53:44,043 --> 00:53:45,793
Just stop here. Turn the car off.

837
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,878
- Up here.
- Over here?

838
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,902
Yeah.

839
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:52,785
Okay.

840
00:53:55,355 --> 00:53:56,449
Right here?

841
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:03,972
What're we doing?

842
00:54:05,598 --> 00:54:07,543
I have to show you something.

843
00:54:10,003 --> 00:54:11,847
Okay. What?

844
00:54:12,965 --> 00:54:15,745
- Follow me.
- Keith... Keith, wh...

845
00:54:22,248 --> 00:54:23,698
Keith?

846
00:54:23,783 --> 00:54:25,159
Keith, what are we doing, bud?

847
00:54:30,412 --> 00:54:31,680
Keith.

848
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:37,652
Is this... Is this where you were?

849
00:54:46,072 --> 00:54:47,807
Keith, come on, man.

850
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:54,366
What? What? What about it?

851
00:54:56,282 --> 00:54:57,506
Lift it up.

852
00:54:58,484 --> 00:54:59,803
Lift it up!

853
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:15,001
Fuck!

854
00:55:22,508 --> 00:55:24,177
Ga...

855
00:55:26,279 --> 00:55:27,646
Keith, what did you do, dude?

856
00:55:27,647 --> 00:55:29,567
Whoa.

857
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:32,098
Fuck!

858
