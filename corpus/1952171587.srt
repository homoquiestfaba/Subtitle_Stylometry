1
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,032
Baby...

2
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,749
It's okay. It's okay.

3
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,379
Don't be frightened.

4
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,717
I'll take very good care of you.

5
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,397
Don't be frightened.

6
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,651
I'm going to take very good care of you.

7
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,558
Excuse me?

8
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,393
- Can I help you?|- I want your database.

9
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,939
Look, I don't know what you think|you're gonna find here, we're just "a..."

10
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,357
I wasn't asking.

11
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,070
All right.

12
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,171
- Looks like we've got a problem.|- What?

13
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,384
Michael, hostiles converging|from the south quadrant.

14
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,430
Listen, "please..."

15
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,812
Michael, go!

16
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,519
I need a location on Nikita.

17
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,772
She's just behind you, Michael.|Getting an elevation reading.

18
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,676
Nikita's location.

19
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,387
She's on the ground, Michael.

20
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,057
Sixteen meters south-southeast. You're|going to have to make a ground approach.

21
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,062
right in front of you, Michael.

22
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,942
Michael, do you have her?

23
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,652
Michael?

24
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,328
Michael, report.

25
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,705
Michael, can you hear me?

26
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,124
Michael?

27
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,190
Housekeeping found this.

28
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,276
It's a thermo-block.

29
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,279
We knew that Bright Star had the|technology to block our IR and RF scans.

30
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,282
But not this.

31
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,993
This is why we couldn't see them|until they left the back room.

32
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,704
What's the status on Nikita?

33
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,541
Nikita's implant went dark a few minutes|after we lost visual on her.

34
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,211
Last known location?

35
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,216
Two blocks from where she fell.

36
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,178
She's off the board.

37
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,724
Quinn's isolated another Bright Star|substation in Rouman.

38
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,352
And since they mirror their database|information across their network...

39
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,897
we'll assemble a storm team...

40
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:59,484
and attempt to acquire|the personnel database we lost.

41
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:04,281
It is essential we obtain this information|within the next 72 hours.

42
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,743
There will be severe repercussions|if we can't.

43
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,287
Nikita has the disk.

44
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,080
Your mission is now listed|as aborted, Michael.

45
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:16,126
We consider database information|you acquired on premises unobtainable.

46
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,216
We've had no contact with her|for six hours.

47
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,469
Per procedure,|she'll be listed as killed in action.

48
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,491
I don't think you're being fair, Mother.

49
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:51,537
I made you dinner and there's a nice,|hot bath waiting for you.

50
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,892
You're alive.

51
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,854
Where am I?

52
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,982
Well, you know,|you wouldn't be if it wasn't for me.

53
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,234
Alive, that is.

54
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,696
It wasn't easy getting that bullet|out of you.

55
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,364
Thank you.

56
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,413
Mother always said|if you're going to be good at anything...

57
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,583
you'd better resolve yourself to practice.

58
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,714
Who are you?

59
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,301
Your doctor.

60
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,481
You smell a lot nicer|than most of my patients.

61
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,572
Do you think you could|take these handcuffs off me?

62
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,574
I like that.

63
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,910
The patient telling the doctor what to do.

64
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:59,790
I'll make those decisions,|if it's all right with you.

65
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,044
I appreciate everything|you've done for me.

66
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,547
I will take very good care of you.

67
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,634
You're very safe here.

68
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,596
What's your name?

69
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:16,974
Henry...

70
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,393
Paul Collins.

71
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,770
What's yours?

72
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,438
Nikita.

73
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:24,940
Nikita.

74
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,651
That is a very pretty name.

75
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,529
Nikita.

76
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,911
Do you want to know a secret?

77
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,414
Besides my mother...

78
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:44,585
you're the first girl I have ever...

79
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,131
been able to talk to.

80
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:02,853
No one as smart and pretty like you.

81
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,544
Where's Michael?

82
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,463
He's in his office.

83
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,966
- Was he informed about the briefing?|- Yes, sir.

84
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,096
This briefing will be rescheduled|one half hour from now.

85
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,979
You're aware of the procedure, Michael.

86
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,857
Did you expect|we'd make an exception for Nikita?

87
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,651
No.

88
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,112
Then you know you have a job to do|and you're expected to do it.

89
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,991
If you have to grieve,|do it on your own time.

90
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,289
You owe me 15 days.

91
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,836
For helping your friend.

92
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,547
Yes, I did promise you that.

93
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,759
I'd like to take them now.

94
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,097
All right, Michael.

95
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,850
You do what you've got to do.

96
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,061
But you're on your own.

97
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,439
If I find out you employed...

98
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,483
any Section resources...

99
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,820
put a drain on our manpower...

100
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,782
I will act accordingly.

101
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:41,910
I understand.

102
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,433
You know what I wished for?

103
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,145
What did you wish for, Henry?

104
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,399
Nothing.

105
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,694
Absolutely nothing.

106
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,866
I finally think I've got everything|I always wanted, right here.

107
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,332
You care about me?

108
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,544
You're very special, Nikita.

109
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,964
Haven't I proven that to you|by saving your life?

110
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,515
But I don't understand...

111
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,850
why you're keeping me down here.

112
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,269
Why the handcuffs?

113
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:54,149
You don't want me to feel like|a prisoner, do you?

114
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,778
You're not nearly well enough to get out|of bed and start running around.

115
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,363
You'll catch your death.

116
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,156
I'd take your advice, Henry.

117
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,118
Even if you took the handcuffs off, "I..."

118
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:09,373
If you said that I should stay in bed,|I would stay in bed.

119
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,625
Then it really doesn't matter|that much, does it?

120
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,004
You know, Mother baked this cake herself.

121
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:25,180
I think she's getting rather jealous|that I brought the rest of it down here.

122
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,393
She thinks I spend too much time|down here.

123
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,396
Does she know about me?|She know I'm down here?

124
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,856
Truth is...

125
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,943
I think she's getting|a little too attached to me.

126
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,449
I suppose it's better than not being loved.

127
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,755
She sounds like she's really very nice,|your mother.

128
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,301
I'd love to meet her.

129
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,102
I'm sure you would.

130
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,356
You see, I knew you were smart.

131
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,695
Henry, I need something to drink.

132
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:23,906
Some water.

133
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,073
Mother...

134
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,952
One of these days|she's gonna push me too far.

135
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,791
Be a good girl and drink your milk.

136
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,891
Nut case.

137
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,065
Thank you, Henry.

138
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,605
Hi.

139
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,932
Forgive me for being rude.

140
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,229
I forgot to say goodnight.

141
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,444
Mother said you might need this.

142
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,547
Oh, hi.

143
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,382
Can I help you?

144
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,217
Hi.

145
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,779
You feeling better, Nikita?

146
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:02,995
If you're going to recycle a sim|or check redundancies...

147
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:07,207
you've got to clear your subnet mask|and make sure your gateways line up.

148
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,752
You're just saying that to get me excited,|aren't you?

149
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,923
Your loins must be a sad|and primitive place, Mr Crawford.

150
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,843
They're just lacking for company,|is all, darling.

151
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,761
And tact, apparently.

152
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,598
Tact is for the boardroom,|not the bedroom.

153
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,726
Or in your case, just bored in the bedroom.

154
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,937
You're too good for me, darling.

155
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,063
Smarter...

156
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,024
faster with the one-liners...

157
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,026
and I'll bet that moat around your thighs...

158
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:37,446
has kept most every human male|standing at the drawbridge...

159
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:41,450
trying to figure out why he ever wanted|to cross it in the first place.

160
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,037
I need a DMV trace.

161
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,289
No can do, Michael, you know the drill.

162
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:00,177
Trust me, pal. Been there, done that.|Forget it.

163
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:04,348
You know the iceberg|that sunk the "Titanic?" It's an amateur.

164
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,142
What do you need?

165
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,688
No good deed goes unpunished.

166
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,985
She's always trying to pound that into me.

167
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,820
And I always resisted.

168
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,659
Seems mother knows best.

169
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:29,039
Nikita, you and I are friends now.

170
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,375
And...

171
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,003
we should treat each other...

172
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,840
like friends.

173
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,017
You really do need your milk.

174
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,203
You are so beautiful, Nikita.

175
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,498
So very beautiful.

176
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:39,443
Won't mother be happy|when she learns of our surprise?

177
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,786
I spliced off Quinn's network bus...

178
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,123
and stuck a null terminal on the line.

179
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,419
She won't even know we were here.

180
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,132
That's good there.

181
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,801
I can enlarge and enhance.

182
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:10,641
That's good.

183
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:15,521
Now all we gotta do is run this puppy|through the DMV database.

184
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,606
That means Quinn.

185
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:18,732
Half an hour.

186
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:19,816
I'll do my best.

187
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:23,529
I try a little harder.

188
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:48,971
Dear God.

189
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:06,154
It's going to be small,|but that doesn't mean we can't do it right.

190
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:15,539
I think it really does something|for the room, don't you?

191
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:16,623
Henry...

192
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,503
Henry...

193
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:23,297
come here.

194
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:28,635
Sit down.

195
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:32,848
Sit down.

196
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,228
I'm very excited about all this.

197
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,441
Haven't you forgotten something?

198
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,485
Forgotten something?

199
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:52,201
Well, I've got the decorations, the cake...

200
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,244
and we're both here.

201
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,121
No.

202
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:57,664
No, I "don't..."

203
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,542
I don't think I left anything out.

204
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:05,506
You never asked me|how I felt about all of this.

205
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:13,055
I saved your life, Nikita.

206
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:16,892
I've taken excellent care of you.|I can't think of any reason why...

207
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:20,062
Then you don't know anything|about women, do you, Henry?

208
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:29,738
Even if a girl's going to say yes...

209
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,326
she likes to be asked.

210
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,583
If I ask, you promise you'll say yes?

211
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,253
That's cheating.

212
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:05,941
Nikita, will you marry me?

213
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,985
Henry, look at me.

214
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,279
Look at me!

215
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,784
Come back here and sit down.

216
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,583
You promised.

217
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:26,044
Henry, take the handcuffs off.

218
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:28,839
You know I can't do that.

219
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,424
If you cared about "me..."

220
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,717
Oh, Nikita, please.

221
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,803
You're like a broken record.|"If you care about "me..."

222
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:38,807
If I unlock those handcuffs,|you're going to try and run for the road.

223
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,267
Henry, I'm sorry.

224
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,311
You're right.

225
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:45,689
That was before|you asked me to marry you.

226
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,944
It's different now.

227
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:56,200
What's so different now?

228
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:59,328
When I'm all tied up like this...

229
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,084
I can't even touch you.

230
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,129
Henry...

231
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,883
I want to know what you feel like.

232
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,056
You sound like a whore, Nikita.

233
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,685
I would never marry a whore!

234
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:34,988
You utilized Section facilities|and manpower...

235
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,407
to assist in an off-profile operation.

236
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,537
I thought Michael worked here.

237
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,705
You know very well what I mean.

238
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,874
All right.

239
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,918
So I helped the guy out some.

240
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,254
It took ten minutes.

241
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:55,217
You're not going to climb out of your skirt|about that, are you?

242
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,428
Why did you do it?

243
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,763
The guy's okay.

244
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,140
Doesn't talk much...

245
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,018
but he plays straight. I like that.

246
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:07,396
Besides...

247
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:10,983
all he's doing is trying to help someone|he cares about.

248
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:12,901
I don't really see the harm in that.

249
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:16,154
And despite the rules...

250
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:20,075
you believe it all comes down|to how you see it.

251
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:30,878
I get the point.

252
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,217
So what now?

253
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:41,430
You gonna cut my head off?

254
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:43,348
No.

255
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:48,520
I'm actually quite pleased|with your progress.

256
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:54,109
It seems the more time you spend with us,|the more like your brother you become.

257
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,404
You're doing quite well, Jason.

258
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:58,780
Quite well.

259
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,266
Mr Collins?

260
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:29,645
That's right.

261
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:31,688
I'm here to read your meter.

262
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,942
- My meter?|- Right.

263
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:38,111
This is really a bad time.

264
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:42,324
I'd have to clear a path for you.|Maybe you could come back next week.

265
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:43,408
I'm sorry.

266
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,245
According to our records,|you're already overdue.

267
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:53,627
- Lf you could just give me a couple days...|- I wish I could.

268
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,711
Rules.

269
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:03,595
Beautiful day.

270
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:58,418
What...

271
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:01,129
What are you doing down there?

272
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:02,506
Mrs Collins...

273
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,801
can you help me, please?

274
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,650
Talk about bad timing.

275
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:25,863
Henry pleaded with him to come back|next week, but he wouldn't have it.

276
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:30,158
Anyway, it'll be nice|to have another guest, huh?

277
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,621
I'd say you were, what? Autumn.

278
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,708
Earthy. Rosy.

279
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,548
Henry's so excited about all of this.

280
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:49,011
You've made him happier|than I've seen him in years.

281
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:57,060
I believe that a boy inevitably|reaches a certain age...

282
00:32:57,102 --> 00:33:00,355
when his mother's attentions|just aren't enough anymore.

283
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:04,359
It's funny, you know, because you keep...

284
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,403
tending to think of them as babies...

285
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:07,905
and then one day...

286
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:11,658
you open your eyes|and you realize that they're all grown up.

287
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:17,706
And that your hugs and kisses|are not what they're looking for.

288
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:20,876
Sad, isn't it?

289
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:25,672
There are people looking for me,|Mrs Collins.

290
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:30,135
Very dangerous people.

291
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:33,347
Who won't hesitate to hurt your son.

292
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,892
See, you have to understand about Henry.

293
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:39,811
His father died just after he was born.

294
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:43,023
And I've tried to be both|a mother and a father to him.

295
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:47,986
I expect that you'll do|everything in your power...

296
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,405
to make him happy.

297
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:52,241
Mrs Collins...

298
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:55,869
if you keep me here, you and Henry...

299
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:58,872
will be in jeopardy.

300
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:02,251
Oh, look at you! You've got butterflies!

301
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:07,965
I remember I had such a case of|the humpy-jumpies before my wedding.

302
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:11,009
It's perfectly normal, you know.

303
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:13,554
You are going to be just fine.

304
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:39,788
Got it.

305
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:46,295
I ran satellite surveillance|on the four likelies I told you about.

306
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:48,630
And lookie here.

307
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:53,260
That's the same truck you were looking at|on those security tapes.

308
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:56,138
You have an address?

309
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,183
I got more than an address. Look at this.

310
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:04,521
Thought maybe I could pick up|some faces for you.

311
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:09,276
Couldn't get much more than the top|of the head of this little guy over here.

312
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:11,236
But the gas man...

313
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,405
just as he looks up...

314
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:15,032
here...

315
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,701
I ran an ident scan on the guy.

316
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:20,037
His name's Craig Burrell.

317
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:25,042
We have him listed in our database|as a third-level operative for Bright Star.

318
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:27,002
He never left the house.

319
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:31,006
Could be we stumbled|on a Bright Star substation.

320
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:34,259
Thought you might want to know.

321
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:36,470
Thank you.

322
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:38,096
Hey, any time.

323
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:41,391
As soon as they got wind|that I was helping you out...

324
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:44,102
old Mata Hari with the shape to die for...

325
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,189
she was all over me|with the compliments.

326
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:50,400
I think she likes it|when I take my own initiative.

327
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:07,167
You really think she's still alive?

328
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:08,836
Yes.

329
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,214
You think or you want to think?

330
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:23,183
You know you've got enough|to go to Operations on this.

331
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,729
You've got a location,|you've ID'd a Bright Star operative.

332
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:30,357
If she is in that house|and she's still alive...

333
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,526
he might reconsider.

334
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:34,152
He won't.

335
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,113
You don't know what you're walking into.

336
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:37,781
If this is a Bright Star operation...

337
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:39,867
you might find a very large|welcoming committee.

338
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:42,244
I'll get her out.

339
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:10,856
Henry...

340
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,734
You look just like your father.

341
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:22,993
You look beautiful.

342
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:28,624
Dearly beloved...

343
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:33,128
we've gathered here today to witness|the bonding of these two young people...

344
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:34,755
in holy matrimony.

345
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:38,759
Do you have the rings?

346
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:48,060
One at a time, Henry.

347
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:49,811
Yours first.

348
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:56,109
Do you, Henry Paul Collins,|take this woman, Nikita...

349
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:58,654
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

350
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,906
In sickness and in health...

351
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,700
for richer or poorer...

352
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:06,119
forsaking all others...

353
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:08,455
until death do you part?

354
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:10,541
I do.

355
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,085
You can't do this.

356
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:22,678
Where's the disk?

357
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:26,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

358
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,257
Where is it?

359
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:03,093
I don't know what you're talking about.

360
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,743
You should've had backup.

361
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:14,456
You had no way of knowing|I was going to be alive.

362
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:18,710
What if this had been|a Bright Star substation?

363
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:22,798
You wouldn't have made it out of here.

364
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:25,676
If you weren't alive,|it wouldn't have mattered.

365
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:01,628
Been here a couple of weeks now, Jason...

366
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:04,840
and already you're checking|anomalies in the inventory.

367
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:08,927
What can I tell you?|They don't have cable. Gotta keep busy.

368
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:12,347
So what do you say, Walter?

369
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:15,851
I got a couple of Beretta 92F's,|a Glock 9 millimeter...

370
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,396
a MAC-10, all unaccounted for.

371
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:23,192
They seemed to go missing|around the time Michael showed up.

372
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:27,613
You know, maybe you should check|your figures one more time.

373
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:32,784
Four times.

374
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:37,372
All right, be that way.

375
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:40,959
I guess you're the kind of guy who just|doesn't like to get a pat on the back.

376
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:42,669
Don't make sense to me.

377
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,130
What do you mean by that?

378
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:48,342
You and me, pal.

379
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:52,429
We seem to be the only two in this place|who want to help that guy.

380
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:55,224
That really seems to impress the brass.

381
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:59,978
- Impress them?|- Hell, yeah.

382
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:03,232
I thought I was gonna get a promotion|on the spot.

383
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,236
I'll put in a good word for you.

384
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:08,320
Don't.

385
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:09,988
All right.

386
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:11,448
Have it your way.

387
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,201
I like you, Walter.

388
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:16,954
I really do.

389
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:19,581
You're my kind of people.

390
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:25,587
Excuse me.

391
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,925
I don't think you should press|those buttons while you're walking.

392
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:36,098
I'm just finishing the download now.

393
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:38,809
It's the entire Bright Star database|from Nikita's disk.

394
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:41,144
It's complete.

395
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:44,314
Do you have a location|and an ETA on Michael and Nikita?

396
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:47,317
No, sir, the download was sent|automatically, on a timer.

397
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:50,654
I had only one voice contact from Michael,|giving me the channel and frequency.

398
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:52,155
Well, where the hell are they?

399
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,324
There was a message on the file header.

400
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:57,286
It seemed cryptic to me. Code, maybe.

401
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:58,996
All it said was:

402
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,456
"It took me four days to find Nikita.

403
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,042
"That leaves eleven."

404
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:07,546
Does that make sense to you?
