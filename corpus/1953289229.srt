00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,492

00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,568

hell  is  empty.

26
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,343
and  all  the devils are here.

27
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,614
There are not 50 ways of fighting.

28
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:08,252
There’s only one, and that's to win.

29
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,428
The doors will remain closed

30
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,229
unless  I want it opened.

31
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,770
and  now, time for the introductions.

35
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,820
and is also known for his colorful use of language.

36
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,084
and political views.

37
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,829
quite unlike the young man to his left,

38
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,763
who lets his fists do all the talking.

39
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,859
They call him, the kid,

40
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:54,803
because of his first kill, at 14.

41
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,733
next to the kid, the Frenchman.

Loomis Cartier.

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,645
he is an ex-legionnaire, who betrayed his own legion for greed.

44
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,777
how the fuck does he know that.

45
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:13,689
and the lady decorated with colorful ink is some.

46
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:20,491
alone assassin who likes to play with knives and guns.

47
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:26,100
some, what do you think of black scorpion's tattoos?

48
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,299
who the fuck is black scorpion?

49
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,568
he is to your left.

50
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,579
not my thing.

51
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,677
carpenter is a legend in the world of assassins.

52
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,160
why you looking me?

53
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,824
you want a problem?

54
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,172
you got a problem with me,

55
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,036
come on over here and say it to my face.

56
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,543
now, now.

57
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,843
It’s not fall out just yet.

58
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:17,253
There is a time and place for such things.

59
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:22,720
Isn't that right,gabriel?

60
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,927
so what?

61
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,730
you know everything about us?

62
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,568
you are an expert at explosives.

63
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,233
you like to be prepared.

64
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,107
and you like classical music.

65
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,745
oh, Gabriel.

66
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:51,187
please, tell us about your suicide attempts.

67
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,555
why, gabriel, why?

68
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,324
Don't you have friends?

69
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,796
Don't you have family?

70
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,662
are you so lonely?

71
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,468
fucking coward.

72
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,806
Talking to me  through a fuckin
microphone and a camera.

73
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,916
what the  fuck are you smiling at?

74
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:22,879
ok.

75
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,558
Don't under estimate his young look

76
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,253
Like his other targets did.

77
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,696
This is mickey,

78
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:39,031
a young assassin who does not know right from wrong.

79
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,041
hi, everybody.

80
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,139
are  you my friends?

81
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:55,515
now, you are  all standing in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        special                                                                                                                                                      a very special place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       special                                                                                                                                                     a very special place.

82
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,647
a place you may have heard of.

83
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,258
The Killing chamber.

84
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,625
Killing chamber.

85
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,663
a Killing chamber?

86
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,031
year right.

87
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,866
fucking Killing chamber.

88
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,667
There’s no such thing.

89
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,736
It is real.

90
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:23,041
This is where hit men are taken to die.

91
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,419
but one will be allowed to leave here.

92
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,419
permitted to live

93
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:35,550
after all the others have been killed in combat.

94
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,391
Is that clear?

95
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,365
yeah, it's fucking clear.

96
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,771
Time to clean up.

97
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,540
ladies first. you’re next.

98
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,878
nobody fights until i tell them to fight.

99
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,743
I deal with my own problems.

100
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,556
what makes you think that might work?

101
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,681
what makes you think it's not?

102
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,555
you got a point right there.

103
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,026
I'll get the midget first. and you.

104
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,893
you suck on my cable later.

105
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,370
stop it.

106
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,019
stop it, or you will be gassed.

107
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,389
fuck you!

108
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,283
Gas, it is.

109
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,856
you will do as you are told.

110
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,330
comply or die.

111
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,996
anyone who refuses my challenges

112
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,696
will suffer the same fate as Schmidt.

113
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,572
Do I make myself clear?

114
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,636
I said, do I make myself clear?

115
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,715
I guess we got no choice, ashore.

116
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,975
ok!

117
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,183
Just get on with it.

118
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,347
so when is the next challenge?

119
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,395
now.

120
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,626
Take one ball.

121
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,179
each ball is numbered.

122
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,382
It cannot be used as a weapon.

123
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,993
The two assassins with the lowest numbers

124
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,061
must fight each other.

125
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,125

will be killed.

136
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,876
you may choose only one weapon.

137
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,711
That doesn’t seem fair.

138
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,392
I'm not taking any crap from you, traitor.

139
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,596
well go fuck yourself.

140
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,872
what's wrong with this nut case?

141
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,803
he is an old-school killer.

142
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,180
he believes the holy tattoos will protect him.

143
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,112
really?

144
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,242
year.

145
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,388
he thinks the tattoos will save his life,

146
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,719
so he can return to his lover.

147
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,728
he’s a nut case. a real nut case.

148
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,529
and you?

149
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,996
what about me?

150
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,262
you got a girl waiting for you?

151
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,007
not anymore.

152
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,011
she’s dead.

153
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,814
Maybe it's best that way, kid.

154
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,214
If it comes down To you and me:

155
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,846
it isn’t going to be you walking out of here.

156
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,921
nothing personal. you understand that, right?

157
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,029
some

158
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:42,205
we’re not going to be able target out of here alone.

159
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,537
If me and you team up,

160
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,773
we can double our chances forgetting out of here.

161
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,974
I don't operate that way.

162
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,432
Meal time is over.

163
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,130
now, for the next two.

164
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,569
There are numbers on the back of the boxes.

165
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:20,975
as before,

166
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:24,809
the two with the lowest numbers must fight.

167
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,581
six.

168
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,149
four.

169
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,797
Three.

170
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,595
Eight.

171
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,335
you may begin. fight!

172
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,275
fuck it. bring it on.

173
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,788

174
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,790

175
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,218
come on, you bitch.

176
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,393
another one bites the dust.

177
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,828
yeah, that's right.

178
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,762
another one bites the dust.

179
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,734
so, is it my turn to get what’s behind door number one?

180
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,635
of course.

181
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,521
all this ninja bullshit.

182
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,858
now maybe you'll want to re-think
that deal I offered you?

183
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,858
what's next?

184
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,556
now you can sleep,

185
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,862
knowing that you are better off than the others.

186
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:12,637
I hope you can trust Each other not to attack in the night.

187
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,909
sleep well.

188
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,531
some

189
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,670
we need sleep.

190
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:47,903
all of us.

191
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,674
we have no idea what this guy's
gonna do tomorrow.

192
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,706
I do know this:

193
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,878
if we do not sleep, we’ll be fucked.

194
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,746
can we have a trust?

195
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,753
please.

196
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,630
ok.

197
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:08,527
ok?

198
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,157
I said 'ok'.

199
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,525
ok.

200
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,707
hay!

201
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,901
Me and some have a trust.

202
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,107
we’re all tired.

203
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,943
we need sleep.

204
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,051
we have no idea what’s going to happen tomorrow.

205
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,946
so for tonight:

206
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,257
can we have a trust to get some sleep?

207
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,792
That's all.

208
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:38,920
Does that work?

209
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,088
Is that a deal?

210
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,894
ok.

211
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,934
ok. Kid?

212
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,439
Maybe.

213
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,007
I'll think about it.

214
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,910
Maybe is not enough.

215
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,916
alright. alright.

216
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,146
we got a deal.

217
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,583
but just for tonight.

218
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,043
Looking for me?

219
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,822

220
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:55,144
Looks like your voodoo shit
didn't work, Did it?

221
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,375
This is insane.

222
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,254
what the fuck are we doing here.

223
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,355
I mean, I don't know you.

224
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,688
I don't know you.

225
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,420
I certainly don't know you.

226
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,190
so what is it?

227
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,567
all of us did a hit on one family?

228
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,295
some kingpin.

229
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,435
Impossible.

230
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:55,241
we’re here for some sick fuck's enjoyment.

231
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,607
and all that's happening is:

232
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,511
we’re stacking up bodies over there.

233
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:00,982
for him.

234
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,711
you think someone’s actually going to leave here?

235
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,258
you think he’s gonna
let anybody walk out that door.

236
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,293
you’re out of your fucking mind.

237
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,529
It isn’t happening.

238
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,999
nobody's leaving this room.

239
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,532
nobody.

240
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,466
It's just going to be a bunch of fucking bodies over there.

241
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,131
you understand that?

242
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,003
here’s what I do know:

243
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:31,876
four is better than one.

244
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,951
If we stick together, we can get out of here.

245
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,760
anybody else? now?

246
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:50,425
no one wants to team up? huh?

247
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,364
ok. I'll tell you one thing:

248
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,841
I am walking out that motherfucking door.

249
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:03,469
with or without you.

250
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,144
see you on the stack.

251
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,489
yeah.

252
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,753
Good morning.

253
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:55,824
I see that you have been bad children in the night.

254
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,000
he deserved it.

255
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,536
whomever killed black scorpion,

256
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,435
is not Entitled to a weapon.

257
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,907
The fight wasn't approved.

258
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:07,908
fuck.

259
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,637
but don't worry.

260
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,375
It's time for the next challenge.

261
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,078
I want Everyone to check their sleeping bags.

262
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,037
Eight.

263
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,445
Three.

264
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,109
Two.

265
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:51,547
now, the highest two numbers must fight.

266
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,591
five.

267
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,589
Like I said, kid: nothing personal.

268
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,778
I'll make it fast.

269
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,028
I'm sorry.

270
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,005

271
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,137

274
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:05,847

277
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,694
I said 'stop it'.

278
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,922
Keep doing it.

279
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:16,589
stop it. or you will be gassed.

280
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,059
Keep doing it.

281
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,229
Gas, it is.

282
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,054
Enough.

283
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:45,528
ninjas: kill them all.

00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:49,121
ok so why does that tie us together? huh?

315
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,124
what is the link? some, think about it.

316
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:51,989
there is some fucking link.

317
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,153
stop it.

318
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:54,628
stop what?

319
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,754
can't you see?

320
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:56,797
see what?

321
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:57,992
we are assassins.

322
00:48:58,135 --> 00:48:59,363
i know we’re all assassins, some.

323
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:01,164
but what does that have to do with anything?

324
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,495
we do all people’s dirt.

325
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,335
yeah, well  you know, i know. we do people’s  dirt.

326
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,375
we  do people’s dirt. why the fuck are we  here?

327
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:09,908
he’s  out there.

328
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:11,310
who's out there?

329
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,716
- him.
- ah, there you are.

330
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,348
very clever, some.

331
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,649
but not good enough.

332
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,159
Give  yourselves up now.

333
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,929
There  is no escape here.

334
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,292
i promise to give you a quick death.

335
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,480
come  on. come  on!

336
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:33,551
some!

337
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:49,738
Go!

338
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:10,727
Move.

339
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,481
some, I saw a room.

340
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,782
I can get us out of here, ok?

341
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,824
Iet's go. please.

342
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:23,666
watch the door.

343
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,510
hurry up.

344
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,453
we’re  getting slaughtered.

345
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:49,157
They're killing my entire army.

346
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,700
Those freaks are complete idiots.

347
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,167
They can't even kill three people.

348
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:57,206
well if these pests
aren't exterminated soon,

349
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,706
the cabal will look weak.

350
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:06,609
you two, go and sort it out. now!

351
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,620
wait.

352
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:55,862
hold on.

353
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:00,300
wait. some, some.

354
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:01,927
look around.

355
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,902
This is exactly where we started.

356
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,999
we’re in the same fuckin place.

357
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,643
slow.

358
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,928
holy shit.

359
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,257
I don't know why they call you the kid.

360
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:31,834
The way I see it,

361
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:36,833
I'm going to start calling you the... beast.

362
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:44,939
you did all this?

363
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,184
That's pretty good shit.

364
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,118
so can one of you two please tell me:

365
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:53,847
where the fuck are we?

366
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:57,451
- I can tell you.
- ok.

367
00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:00,688
we are good at what we do, but we work alone.

368
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,390
ok well that doesn’t tell me shit.

369
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,661
we’re the big fish at shoran cabal.

370
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:07,929
shoran ca--what?

371
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,130
shoran  cabal.

372
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:10,034
never heard of it.

373
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,367
of course you haven’t.

374
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,669
shoran  cabal is a network outfit.

375
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,506
very, very hush hush

376
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,840
and how do you know this, beast?

377
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,381
I heard stories. rumors.

378
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,853
rumors? not so much.

379
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,652
They target only just the best hetman.

380
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,992
sounds like aerially really good video game.

381
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,758
The question I'm asking you is:

382
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,526
where the fuck are we?

383
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:42,762
we are in the Killing chamber.

384
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,838
That should be the name of the video  game.

385
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:50,343
so you’re telling me, that they built this big fucking arena,

386
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,711
and then came and got us just for us to fight?

387
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,646
why not just
fuckin  kill us first, right?

388
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,349
wrong.

389
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,509
Go!

390
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,385
fuck!

391
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,018
I'm going to shoot you batches in the face.

392
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:09,762
oh I'm sorry.

393
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:12,697
Did the kid take outcall your freaks, you douche?

394
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,998
This is my house, punk.

395
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,803
you’re in my world, bitch.

396
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,570
I make the rules here.

397
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,770
you die when I say so.

398
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,879
I'll tell you what.

399
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:28,908
I'll make you a deal.

400
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:34,490
Me, some and the kid will not fuck up your whole crew and kill you...

401
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,023
you let us go.

402
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:38,060
nobody escapes us.

403
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:39,423
Don't bet on it.

404
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,621
heard  that? Don't bet  on it!

405
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:46,498
east deluded lowlife prick that tried to break out died slowly.

406
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,901
bled dry like a pathetic stuck pig.

407
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,440
That's too bad.

408
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,172
I guess we have to do better.

409
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,111
I guess we do.

410
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:02,708
you’re just parasites compared to us.

411
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:05,151
and it's time to do some delousing.

412
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,413
delousing, huh?

413
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,484
I don't know what that means, but, delouse this!

414
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,739
ok, come on.

415
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,473
almost there, ok?

416
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,310
we almost made it.

417
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,782
so let’s go. which way?

418
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,944
which way do we go now? huh?
which way?

419
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:39,782
I’ve got business to handle.

420
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,823
I'm sorry. what?

421
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,790
I have business  to handle.

422
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:46,452
oh you have business  to handle.

423
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:49,031
oh ok, that's cool. uh, ready?

424
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:49,859
which way?

425
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,023
me, too.

426
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:51,963
you, too?

427
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,534
oh, look at you guys.

428
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,900
yeah going to open up a frikin pizza parlor or an ice cream shop.

429
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,233
what the fuck are you talking about.

430
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:58,305
we’re a team, man.

431
00:57:58,441 --> 00:57:59,874
we made it this far. what are you doing?

432
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,567
let's go! which way?

433
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:03,844
exit is there.

434
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:14,246
ok. you know, I hate long goodbyes.

435
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,721
Go fuck yourselves.

436
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,693
Good luck.fuckers.

437
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:00,364
we have a breech in the asylum sector.

438
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:03,495
target is heading main junction.

439
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,602
give me more soldiers!

440
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,700
I want more men!

441
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:11,875
surround them!

442
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,285
fuck this.

443
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,249
fucking bangkok.

444
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,789
stop right there!

445
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:49,431
Drop the weapon. now!

446
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,297
Game over.

447
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:01,206
you will never  understand what wisdom lies within my madness.

448
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:06,306
an assassin's life has no value other than what I decide.

449
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:12,017
your kind is like a cancer that must be wiped out like a disease.

450
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:17,988
There can only be one winner, and that winner is me!

451
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,094
Down!

452
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:36,238
oh fuck.

453
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,722
how'd I do, beast ? Good?

454
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,163
Thank you.

455
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,000
why did you come back?

456
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,145
you see, I was on the roof.

457
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:14,273
and I was ready  to go.

458
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,908
and I thought, what the fuck?

459
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,521
you left without saying goodbye to some, right?

460
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:22,182
because we’re team mates.

461
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,724
Is that right?

462
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,760
we’re a team, right?

463
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,154
Team mates we are.

464
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:30,923
and you trust me?

465
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:33,767
huh?

466
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:35,268
I trust you.

467
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:37,401
so finish him.

468
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:40,265
please. finish him.

469
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,354
how is your girlfriend?

470
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:52,032
she’s just fine.

471
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,184
you’re good.

472
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,810
I know.

473
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:48,946
you did nothing in here.

474
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,389
I can fix this place  in no time.

475
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:56,822
I'm going to bust you open like you did to Jake.

476
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,493
Jake ?

477
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,262
my brother.

478
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,867
Jake  was your brother?

479
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:09,266
yes. he was.

480
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,116
how do you think I knew about this place ?

481
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:20,616
Jake  did escape the chamber.

482
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:23,457
I saw him die on the street.

483
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,490
alone.

484
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,866
he did not have time to talk to anybody.

485
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:37,131
who said anything about talking?

486
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:46,105
two years ago, jake, my brother,

487
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,547
escaped the Killing chamber.

488
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:52,543
he had been beaten.

489
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,349
he had been  shot.

490
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,117
but he escaped.

491
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:04,598
Jake  and I were both assassins.

492
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:07,998
we knew  how to communicate  in secret.

493
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:12,230
we use dead drops.

494
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:20,143
he wrote down everything about this place.

495
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:23,182
he told me how to escape.

496
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,583
he told me how to get out.

497
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:33,961
and he told me about you

498
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:35,927
and what you do.

499
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:46,606
I have never  stopped thinking about what happened to jake.

500
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:49,643
and i resolved to avenge his death.

501
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:52,103
but i had to wait.

502
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:56,741
I had to wait, for you to seek me out.

503
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:01,287
I had to get better at killing.

504
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:04,081
and i did.

505
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:07,725
i knew  if i got good.

506
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:12,859
made my name  as the top assassin,

507
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:17,594
you would come calling for me one day.

508
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:21,100
and now you have.

509
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:26,406
That red tie belonged to Jake.

510
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,810
I like to collect trophies.

511
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:33,353
but in the end I get bored with them.

512
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:37,083
all these, taken from dead assassins?

513
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:41,423
I don't permit assassins to operate outside my organization.

514
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,329
The cabal.

515
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,564
you expect me to join you?

516
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:50,570
no, some.

517
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:54,938
I expect  you to die.

518
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,122
