Regina, I am prepared to depart.
Have my project brought up.

3
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,783
[Regina] <i>Yes, Mr. Wenan.</i>

4
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,733
Billy, I just got word

5
00:01:57,862 --> 00:02:01,126
that your father will not be
joining us for Christmas.

6
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,686
Oh, I know, sweetie.

7
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,598
It's... his work.

8
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:07,686
It's unfortunate.

9
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:10,534
I was really looking
forward to seeing John.

10
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:15,270
I'm sorry that I won't be able
to be there for you today.

11
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:17,765
- It's okay, Grandma.
- [exhales sharply]

12
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:19,270
Come here.

13
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,134
You know what would
look good here?

14
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:27,429
Another ribbon.
[chuckles]

15
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:29,894
Bring home the blue,
Billy.

16
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:32,998
I will, Grandmother,
because that's what winners do.

17
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,045
Oh, that's my boy.

18
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:37,957
And we'll send a picture
to your father afterwards.

19
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:39,526
- Hmm?
- [chuckles]

20
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:45,541
Please be a dear
and get me a glass of milk.

21
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,046
Of course, Grandma.

22
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:48,549
Thank you.

- Yes, Mr. Wenan.

25
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:02,438
I need this letter
mailed overnight.

26
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:03,973
Of course.

27
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,989
I'll be back in
approximately four hours.

28
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:07,653
Otherwise, I can be reached
on my phone.

29
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:10,054
Oh, and, um, Regina,

30
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:12,230
Grandmother would like
a glass of milk.

31
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,022

Working something out,

34
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:53,062
Yeah.

35
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,942
I finished up early
on the day's orders,

36
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,830
so I figured
I'd get in some practice.

37
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,774
This is our lowest year
on record.

38
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:04,485
Yeah, we've had slumps before.
It'll pick back up.

39
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:07,878
And the supply bill
next month?

40
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:09,766
We can't run up
any more credit.

41
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:13,318
Try not to worry.

42
00:04:13,446 --> 00:04:15,877
Just trying to keep things
in perspective.

43
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:17,670
I'll head
into town tomorrow

44
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:19,270
and check on the late entries.

45
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:20,613
I'll look at the PO box.

46
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,533
They've assured me
our check's in the mail.

47
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:23,942
All right.

48
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,990
I'll make cookies
for the drive.

49
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,582
That'd be nice.

50
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,110

Uh, yeah.
Yes. Yes, I do.

As long as it takes.

70
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:51,558
Is there a place
I can sit?

71
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:54,342
Does it look like there's
someplace that you can sit?

72
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:59,270
Does this belong to you?

73
00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:03,078
Uh, yeah. I got it for
Christmas when I was 11.

74

Eleven. Eleven.
That's great.

75

You know, I never got
what I asked for.

76

Are you
a baseball player?

77
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:20,966
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I am.

You're an athlete?

79
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:24,934
I mean, I was.

80
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:29,734
I, uh, blew my ACL out in
college, like, 15 years ago.

81
00:06:29,862 --> 00:06:32,070
- Why are you selling it now?
- I don't really wanna.

82
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:37,254
But my little girl wants to go to
space camp, so, uh, we can't afford it.

I'll give you
$900 for it.

gonna get me halfway there.

it or you can fuck off.

of my project.

90
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:14,150
- [woman] How long did this take you?
- Two weeks of conceptualizing

91
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:15,494
and ten days
of actual building.

92
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:17,190
How'd you come up
with this?

93
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:20,390
After I realized the amount of
power within a flowing water source,

94
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:22,086
the rest was elementary.

Oh, that fella.
Well, I guess he left.

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:32,262
Why is it every time you come in
here, I end up going home alone?

half of last year's product,

reflects that.

"Subsidy payment is dependent on
volume of presents made and delivered."

how you've been paid.

be able to survive.

fat ass down your chimney

308

a whole bunch of presents

Christmas Eve, so you know it's serious.

I mean, I thought we did
a great job for you back in '98.

My team is fast.

330

they do quality work, right?

No, no, I can't beat that.

gotta be sacrificing something somewhere.

00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:17,446
[song continues on speakers]

520
00:33:32,455 --> 00:33:34,501
[speaking Chinese]
May I get another pot of tea?

521
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,454
[woman] Mr. Wenan.
This package came for you.

522
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:54,949
From your father
for Christmas.

523
00:33:57,511 --> 00:33:59,431
[sighs]

524
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:00,999
It's a few days late.

525
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:02,341
Yes, sir.

526
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:05,095
From the Bahamas?

527
00:34:05,221 --> 00:34:07,269
That's what it says,
sir.

528
00:34:07,397 --> 00:34:10,149
He's probably there with
his girlfriend, Kara.

529
00:34:11,013 --> 00:34:12,486
I wouldn't know, sir.

530
00:34:13,925 --> 00:34:16,422
Well, pass it to me.

531
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,783
[clattering]

532
00:35:16,293 --> 00:35:17,574
[sighs]

533
00:35:21,798 --> 00:35:23,206
[sighs]

534
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:42,438
Where the hell are you?

535
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:17,478
[engine shuts off]

536
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:23,718
Hey.

537
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:25,638
Where do the, uh...

538
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,070
the letters
to Santa go?

539
00:36:28,198 --> 00:36:30,213
You know, the letters the
children write to Santa Claus?

540
00:36:30,341 --> 00:36:31,814
- What happens to 'em?
- Yeah, yeah. H-36.

541
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:34,534
Uh, it's a... it's a bin
down at the office.

542
00:36:34,662 --> 00:36:37,893
- Right. What happens to 'em after that?
- Uh, I don't know.

543
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,877
Guess you could ask Weyland,
our district super.

544
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:41,254
Weyland? You know
where I could find him?

545
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:43,366
Yeah, downtown office,
just off Redding Street.

546
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:44,613
- Redding?
- Yeah.

547
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:47,270
- Great. Thank you.
- No problem.

548
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:48,806
Have a good day.

549
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:03,206
Morning.

550
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:06,246
Sorry.
This is my first day.

551
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:08,677
Know where I can find
Supervisor Meeks's office?

552
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,590
Um...

553
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,702
can I help you?

554
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:25,318
I'm looking
for the fat man.

555
00:37:25,446 --> 00:37:26,374
Where is he?

556
00:37:26,502 --> 00:37:27,942
Excuse me?

557
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:30,918
Santa Claus,
motherfucker.

558
00:37:32,774 --> 00:37:34,629
Come on, Weyland.

559
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:36,326
Don't act stupid.

560
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:40,261
Just give me the address and
I'll walk right out of here.

561
00:37:43,558 --> 00:37:45,318
- [stammers]
- Where do you send the letters?

562
00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:47,366
Okay, just take it easy.

563
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:52,550
[whimpers] Look,
I can't give you an address because...

564
00:37:52,678 --> 00:37:54,246
Shh.

565
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:56,645
[whispering] I can't give you an
address because I don't have one.

566
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,438
Then you just sorted
your last piece of mail.

567
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:00,166
No, no, no, no.
I just...

568
00:38:00,294 --> 00:38:03,718
Look, it's a classified program.
They give me a PO box and that's it.

569
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:05,414
I don't know anything else.
I swear to you.

570
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:08,229
We just crate up the letters
and send them out.

571
00:38:10,502 --> 00:38:11,686
Write it down.

572
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,502
- Write it down.
- Okay.

573
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,294
Okay.

574
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,950
To the right.

575
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:20,166
Other way.

576
00:38:26,694 --> 00:38:28,806
Not that page.
Use a blank one.

577
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:33,350
Okay.

578
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,430
- Slow down. Make it legible.
- Fuck.

579
00:38:35,558 --> 00:38:37,190
[breathing heavily]

580
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:38,470
Okay?

581
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,582
- You gotta be shitting me.
- No, no, no. It's the truth. I swear it.

582
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:52,966
[chuckling]

583
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:57,510
So, uh, what now?

584
00:38:59,782 --> 00:39:01,126
Well...

585
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:03,398
that's it.

586
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:05,222
- [gunshots]
- [body falls]

587
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,157
[Chris] Son of a...

588
00:39:13,286 --> 00:39:14,822
[tools clattering]

589
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,542
[groaning]

590
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,702
[creaking]

591
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,165
[grunts]

592
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:32,613
[groaning]

593
00:39:33,862 --> 00:39:37,574
[breathing heavily]

594
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,510
[phone: line ringing]

595
00:39:48,742 --> 00:39:50,278
[Billy] <i>Hello?</i>

596
00:39:50,406 --> 00:39:51,942
We're a go.

597
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,726
- I'll be on the road by midnight.
- <i>Sounds good.</i>

598
00:39:54,854 --> 00:39:56,806
<i>Keep me updated
on your progress.</i>

599
00:40:28,422 --> 00:40:29,766
[squeaking]

600
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:06,341
[chattering]

601
00:41:08,198 --> 00:41:10,054
They'll understand.

602
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:13,542
They shouldn't have to.

603
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:17,191
Can I assume
they speak English?

604
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:22,342
Our work requires that they
speak many different languages.

605
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,998
Let's just get this
over with.

606
00:41:34,982 --> 00:41:38,822
[man] All right, everyone.
Quiet down now. Let's quiet down.

607
00:41:44,678 --> 00:41:48,966
- Is everybody here?
- We're all here and accounted for, sir.

608
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,638
Well, firstly, uh,

609
00:41:53,766 --> 00:41:56,902
I'm sorry to call you
all back so early.

610
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,845
But I'm sure you're all
excited to get cracking

611
00:41:59,974 --> 00:42:03,718
and get working again
on next year's Christmas season.

612
00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:05,765
- [cheers, applause]
- [bells jingling]

613
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:16,358
And you're probably wondering about
all the new faces around here today.

614
00:42:16,486 --> 00:42:17,989
[chattering, murmuring]

615
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,974
[Chris] Well,
as you already know...

616
00:42:21,894 --> 00:42:26,278
there is a rising number of our
youth making poor decisions.

617
00:42:26,406 --> 00:42:27,878
[murmuring]

618
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:32,422
Now, this has unfortunately
caused our yearly subsidy

619
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,142
to be well below
our current budget.

620
00:42:36,871 --> 00:42:39,205
Now, to make up
for that shortfall...

621
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:46,022
we are fulfilling a two-month
contract with the US military.

622
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,117
[chattering,
murmuring continue]

623
00:42:54,182 --> 00:42:58,502
Now, I know this must come
as a shock to a lot of you.

624
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,926
Believe me,
had there been any other way...

625
00:43:03,078 --> 00:43:04,262
[clears throat]

626
00:43:06,278 --> 00:43:08,326
[Chris]
This is Captain Jacobs.

627
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:10,662
Captain Jacobs'll fill you in

628
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:13,413
on a lot of the changes
that are going on around here.

629
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:14,918
Thank you.

630
00:43:19,206 --> 00:43:22,086
I am going to go over
some rules

631
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:24,358
that must be followed
without exception

632
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:26,662
and throughout the duration
of this engagement.

633
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:31,174
These rules are for your safety,
and your safety alone.

634
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:34,246
Number one,
you will be fingerprinted,

635
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:38,054
- assigned a security badge to be worn at all times.
- Next.

636
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:41,669
Number two, you must enter
and exit the factory floor

637
00:43:41,798 --> 00:43:43,718
through the
southern bay doors only.

638
00:43:43,846 --> 00:43:48,006
Number three, you must remove
the bells from your uniforms

639
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:50,695
as they will set off
our metal detectors.

640
00:43:50,822 --> 00:43:55,109
In addition to these rules,
we will be upgrading the site's security.

641
00:43:55,782 --> 00:43:57,573
Do you have any questions?

642
00:43:58,918 --> 00:43:59,974
Yes.

643
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:02,311
What kind of toys
are we making, sir?

644
00:44:02,437 --> 00:44:03,782
Not toys, miss.

645
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,982
Control panels for
America's eagle in the sky,

646
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,734
our FJ-63 fighter jets.

647
00:44:11,718 --> 00:44:14,214
[horns honking]

648
00:44:17,926 --> 00:44:19,813
What's the purpose
of your visit?

649
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:23,206
Recreation. Hunting.

650
00:44:23,335 --> 00:44:25,382
I'm gonna kill some things.

651
00:44:27,622 --> 00:44:29,509
You fill out the 5589?

652
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:33,413
Yes, ma'am,
I have my 5589...

653
00:44:33,862 --> 00:44:36,902
my 4457,

654
00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:39,782
and my 3177 right here.

655
00:44:42,406 --> 00:44:44,069
[honking continues]

656
00:44:54,469 --> 00:44:56,262
[stamper clicks]

657
00:44:58,213 --> 00:44:59,462
All right.

658
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,966
Welcome to Canada.

659
00:45:01,414 --> 00:45:02,853
Good to be here.

660
00:45:44,935 --> 00:45:47,815
Holy Christ, Corporal,
you call that hammering?

661
00:45:48,485 --> 00:45:50,727
Show a little pride
in your work.

662
00:45:50,853 --> 00:45:52,102
Here. You're up.

663
00:45:52,229 --> 00:45:54,118
[loud crash]

664
00:45:54,245 --> 00:45:55,909
Holy hell.

665
00:45:56,038 --> 00:45:58,406
Soldier, get your sorry ass
out of that lift.

666
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:00,135
Clean that shit up.

667
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,197
[groaning]

668
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:15,269
Hey, partner. Here.

669
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:16,837
Hang on to this.

670
00:46:20,005 --> 00:46:21,159
[grunts]

671
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:24,902
[groaning]

672
00:46:30,886 --> 00:46:32,229
Thank you.

673
00:46:32,902 --> 00:46:34,246
Steroids.

674
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:43,045
[grunts]
I come in peace.

675
00:46:43,174 --> 00:46:44,806
Thank you.

676
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:01,575
Morning, 7.
How's everybody holding up?

677
00:47:01,702 --> 00:47:04,966
Very well, sir. We got the
line up and running last night.

678
00:47:05,093 --> 00:47:07,621
- Right now we're optimizing.
- Oh, yeah.

679
00:47:07,749 --> 00:47:09,925
Okay, optimizing.
I see.

680
00:47:10,053 --> 00:47:11,845
19, 23,
how are you doing?

681
00:47:11,973 --> 00:47:14,151
- Wonderfully perfect, sir.
- Uh, super-duper good.

682
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:16,870
Ah, I appreciate
the positivity.

683
00:47:16,998 --> 00:47:17,926
Are you buying that?

684
00:47:18,055 --> 00:47:19,815
Absolutely, boss.

685
00:47:19,942 --> 00:47:23,013
I really backed you into a corner on this
one, 7. Don't think I don't know that.

686
00:47:23,142 --> 00:47:25,861
The order calls for a lot of
product in a short amount of time.

687
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:29,701
Yeah, it's gonna be a squeaker even if
everything goes perfect. Refill, thanks.

688
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:31,013
Which it never does.

689
00:47:31,142 --> 00:47:32,837
When have you seen it
go perfect?

690
00:47:32,965 --> 00:47:35,398
- 1910 was close.
- There was a bad war that year.

691
00:47:35,526 --> 00:47:36,549
You can't blame
yourself.

692
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:39,175
- I'll go check the crew.
- The office.

693
00:47:39,301 --> 00:47:40,678
Oh, one more thing.

694
00:47:40,806 --> 00:47:42,373

695
00:47:42,502 --> 00:47:45,189
this is make or break
for us.

696
00:47:45,317 --> 00:47:48,646
I don't need to tell you that
absolutely everything is on the line.

697
00:47:49,638 --> 00:47:52,294
Christmas is at stake, sir.
We won't let you down.

698
00:47:52,422 --> 00:47:55,558
- We'll have the order finished on time.
- Good man.

699
00:47:55,686 --> 00:47:58,119
Chris, I just
talked to my superiors.

700
00:47:58,246 --> 00:48:00,326
They're very impressed with
the numbers that I gave them.

701
00:48:00,453 --> 00:48:03,685
They're sending in a couple of suits
to have a look at the operation.

702
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,862
It's a very impressive
group of...

703
00:48:06,726 --> 00:48:08,646

you've got here.

704
00:48:08,775 --> 00:48:09,735
Real hard workers.

705
00:48:10,951 --> 00:48:13,126
I'd like to use the break
room, if that's possible.

706
00:48:13,253 --> 00:48:15,686

rotation, four on at all times.

inside the factory 24 hours a day.

708
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:20,837
How does that
sit with you, 7?

709
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:23,686
We can take our breaks
in the cafeteria.

710
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:25,990
Many thanks to you.
Captain Jacobs.

711
00:48:26,118 --> 00:48:27,589
- 7.
- 7?

712
00:48:27,718 --> 00:48:29,638
We're all ranked and
accounted for by number.

713
00:48:29,766 --> 00:48:31,015
It's more efficient
that way.

714
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,966
7's our factory foreman.

715
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:34,213
What happened to
1 through 6?

716
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:36,229
Well, we've been at this
a long time.

717
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:38,278
We don't reissue numbers.

718
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:41,223
That would be unethical
and dishonorable.

719
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:43,110
I like it.

720
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:44,997
That's a hell of
a way to run a crew.

00:48:45,126 --> 00:48:48,613
Would you like a cookie,
Captain Jacobs?

722
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:50,501
Indeed.

723
00:48:51,717 --> 00:48:53,253
A hell of a way
to run a crew.

724
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:54,663
Excuse me.

725
00:48:59,622 --> 00:49:00,678
Mmm.

726
00:49:01,861 --> 00:49:03,109

You all right, buddy?

730

The hamster hammock is a top
seller and this, the roller.

731
00:49:33,926 --> 00:49:36,453
Then we have
the seesaw.

Nibblers and
the pet playhouse.

733
00:49:39,397 --> 00:49:41,542
There's no room
for the pet playhouse.

734
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:44,422
You know, it's funny.
You don't strike me as a hamster person.

735
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:47,686
- Well, I am.
- You seem more like a... a reptile person.

736
00:49:47,815 --> 00:49:49,861
Do you like lizards?

737
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,711
I have a great selection
of chameleons.

738
00:49:52,837 --> 00:49:54,821
I don't want a chameleon.

Snakes.

740
00:49:57,669 --> 00:50:00,453
That's it.
You're a snake person.

741
00:50:01,413 --> 00:50:03,110
Snakes eat hamsters.

742
00:50:03,238 --> 00:50:05,477
You know, lots of people don't know
what kind of pet person they are,

743
00:50:05,606 --> 00:50:07,526
but I'm really good
at this.

744
00:50:08,326 --> 00:50:10,630
You know, you remind me
a lot of my mother.

745
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,101

- Yeah.

She wasn't
a good listener,

747
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:16,997

when to shut the fuck up.

752
00:50:49,222 --> 00:50:51,397
We had a hell of a time
finding this place.

753

Asked around town,
but no one had a clue.

754
00:50:53,606 --> 00:50:55,975
Yeah, as you can imagine,
it has to be that way.

755
00:50:56,101 --> 00:50:57,286
And we think
it's a good thing.

756
00:50:57,414 --> 00:50:59,173
Great thing.
Yeah, I'm Lex Taylor.

- This is, uh, Carter Mapplethorpe.
- I know who you are.

758
00:51:02,214 --> 00:51:04,263
Right. They warned us
about that.

759
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:06,693
Things were a little touch-and-go
for a couple of years.

760
00:51:06,821 --> 00:51:08,326
Weren't they, Carter?

00:51:20,229 --> 00:51:21,958
7, my shop foreman,

766
00:51:22,085 --> 00:51:23,686
will show you anything
you might need to see.

767
00:51:23,815 --> 00:51:25,925
We, uh, don't need to have
a look around, Chris.

768
00:51:26,053 --> 00:51:28,550
No, we've seen the numbers,
we've seen the samples,

769
00:51:28,678 --> 00:51:30,438
and the work you do
is exceptional.

770
00:51:30,566 --> 00:51:33,733
The military would like to procure
your services on an annual basis.

Let's not get ahead
of ourselves here.

We are prepared to guarantee
your subsidization for 15 years.

I hear
what you're saying,

774

but this is a one-time deal,
gentlemen.

775
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:49,190
How about you wait until you get that
check on the first of next month,

776
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:52,454
and then we'll see if you
don't have a change of heart.

777
00:51:52,582 --> 00:51:53,990
That's not gonna happen.

778

I appreciate your optimism,
sir, I-I really do,

779
00:51:57,158 --> 00:52:00,038
but with all due respect,
I think both of us know

780
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:03,558
that there's a very good chance you're
gonna end up right back here next year.

781
00:52:04,261 --> 00:52:05,670
And then maybe,
Mr. Cringle,

782
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:09,061
- the deal we offer won't be so sweet.
- Mm-hmm.

815
00:54:56,038 --> 00:54:59,814

817

Captain, we have discovered the most
efficient and productive way to eat

818
00:55:05,862 --> 00:55:07,749
is simple carbs
and sugars

819
00:55:07,878 --> 00:55:08,806
six times a day.

820
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:10,790
But that's unnatural.

821
00:55:10,918 --> 00:55:12,774

regular exercise,
a minimum of six hours of sleep.

Oh, every elf takes a 20-minute
nap every eight hours.

I wouldn't be thrilled to hear it.

1041
01:11:32,357 --> 01:11:34,054
- Oh, is that all?
- Hmm.

1042
01:11:34,182 --> 01:11:35,686
What's wrong with that,
Mrs. Cringle?

1043
01:11:35,814 --> 01:11:38,150
I thought you wanted me
to mend your bag.

1044
01:11:38,278 --> 01:11:39,941
Yeah, I do.

1045
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,798
But, um, later.

1046
01:11:41,926 --> 01:11:43,334

- What are you thinking?
- [inhales deeply]

1051
01:13:08,357 --> 01:13:10,471
I'm thinking,

1052
01:13:10,598 --> 01:13:13,702
you know, the good
does outweigh the bad.

1053
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:15,014
Mm-hmm.

1054

Hey.

1060
01:14:19,686 --> 01:14:21,062
Hey.

1061
01:14:22,085 --> 01:14:23,558
Hey, uh...

1062
01:14:24,549 --> 01:14:26,662
Just take it easy,
little fella.

1063
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:28,326
Okay?

1064
01:14:29,446 --> 01:14:31,525
That's not a toy.

1065
01:14:32,358 --> 01:14:34,213
You one of
Captain Jacobs's men?

1066
01:14:34,342 --> 01:14:37,222
Yes, I am. I'm one
of Captain Jacobs's men.

1067
01:14:37,831 --> 01:14:39,942
So put it down
on the ground.

1068
01:14:40,421 --> 01:14:41,766
Right now.

01:14:50,981 --> 01:14:52,135
I have no idea.

01:14:52,262 --> 01:14:54,950

Oh, shit.

1077
01:15:08,102 --> 01:15:11,814
Pressure, Henshaw.
Press down on it, son.

Where's Chris?

1080
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:26,949
Shit.

[shouting]

1082
01:15:31,942 --> 01:15:34,118
- Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?
- They're shooting.

1083
01:15:34,246 --> 01:15:35,782
- Who is? The soldiers?
- I-I don't know.

1084
01:15:35,909 --> 01:15:38,629
Go. I'm initiating
barricade protocol yellow!

1085
01:15:38,758 --> 01:15:41,605
- Get into the domestic wing!
- Go, go, go!

1086
01:15:41,734 --> 01:15:44,518
- [beeps]
- Dobson, McCranie, Phillips.

1087
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:45,670
We are under fire.

1088
01:15:45,798 --> 01:15:48,389

- Stay close.

1089

7, you all get your asses
ready to move.

1090

7, where are you going?

1098

- [intercom beeping]

1099
01:16:45,158 --> 01:16:46,533
All right. Yeah?

Jonathan Miller.

1117
01:18:56,422 --> 01:18:58,373
You twisted child.

1118
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:04,359
And I always thought
you forgot about me.

1119
01:19:12,549 --> 01:19:14,086
You remember this?

1120
01:19:15,622 --> 01:19:18,918
This was the only goddamn
thing you ever got me.

[grunts]

1122
01:19:29,382 --> 01:19:34,054
After all the times
that I wrote you.

1123
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:39,653
I'm sorry, son.

1124
01:19:42,151 --> 01:19:44,453
There are limits
to what I can do.

1125
01:19:46,213 --> 01:19:48,646
I couldn't replace
your parents.

1126
01:19:51,205 --> 01:19:52,455
Yeah.

1127
01:19:53,478 --> 01:19:54,789
You couldn't.

1128
01:19:58,215 --> 01:20:00,006
Well, here we are.

1129
01:20:02,533 --> 01:20:06,469
I've come for your head,
fat man!

1130
01:20:09,382 --> 01:20:11,141
You think
you're the first?

1131
01:20:14,021 --> 01:20:17,829
You think I got this job
because I'm fat and jolly?

Helga!

1161
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:01,029
I'll be working in my room
for the rest of the evening,

1162
01:27:01,158 --> 01:27:03,142
so no interruptions.

1163
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:04,326
[Helga]
Yes, Mr. Wenan.

1164
01:27:04,454 --> 01:27:06,918
Why are you calling me
about this now?

1165
01:27:07,045 --> 01:27:09,478
How can there be
that much missing?

1166
01:27:09,606 --> 01:27:12,134
Oh, I want this tracked.

1167
01:27:12,262 --> 01:27:15,014
Find out where
it was cashed.

1168
01:27:15,142 --> 01:27:17,094
Then check my signatures.

1169
01:27:17,221 --> 01:27:21,093
Call the bank. Tell them to
keep an eye on all my accounts.

1170
01:27:21,222 --> 01:27:24,742
If there's a rat,
I want to snap its little neck.

Damn it, Helga.
I said no interruptions.

1177
01:28:08,102 --> 01:28:12,038
Don't you speak English?
I said stay out.

1178
01:28:13,989 --> 01:28:15,526
Who the hell are you?

1179
01:28:16,486 --> 01:28:17,926
I'm Ruth.

1180
01:28:18,949 --> 01:28:21,542
And this is Chris.

1181
01:28:32,582 --> 01:28:34,534
- [door closes]
- [Chris] Billy.

1182
01:28:35,558 --> 01:28:36,933
Well...

1183
01:28:38,118 --> 01:28:40,262
I can't say
I'm surprised.

1184
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:43,045
Mmm.

1185
01:28:52,134 --> 01:28:54,726
Yeah. Fentanyl.

1186
01:28:55,558 --> 01:28:57,414
That'll get the job done.

1187
01:29:03,686 --> 01:29:05,702
This is partly my fault.

1188
01:29:06,854 --> 01:29:10,310
You know, I just haven't quite
been myself lately, have I, dear?

1189

[Ruth] Mm-mmm.

1190
01:29:12,646 --> 01:29:15,974
But the time has come
to turn things around.

1191
01:29:16,645 --> 01:29:19,781
I've decided to be proactive.

1192
01:29:21,286 --> 01:29:23,206
And it starts with you.

1193
01:29:26,982 --> 01:29:29,477
Ow. Ow. Ow.

1194
01:29:31,397 --> 01:29:32,709
Ow.

1195
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:58,150
[Chris]
Now look at me, child.

1196
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:03,558
I said look at me.

1197
01:30:04,838 --> 01:30:08,007
A wicked soul
bent on bloodshed

1198
01:30:08,133 --> 01:30:09,862
was sent
to collect my head.

1199
01:30:09,991 --> 01:30:15,846
Like you, he thought he lived
outside of morals and consequence.

1200
01:30:17,477 --> 01:30:20,646
He is now buried
with his lack of reverence.

1201
01:30:21,766 --> 01:30:24,005
One more time,
Billy Wenan,

1202
01:30:24,134 --> 01:30:26,086
once more,

1203
01:30:26,215 --> 01:30:29,605
and you'll be getting more
than coal in your stocking.

1204
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:33,542
If your grandmother
meets an early grave,

1205
01:30:34,405 --> 01:30:38,022
if Christine Crawford
suffers so much as a cold,

1206
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:43,397
if anybody that crosses your path is made
to feel less or lower because of you...

1207
01:30:44,742 --> 01:30:46,533
I'm coming back.

1208
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:52,709
I'll come while you sleep
and rip you from your covers.

1209
01:30:52,838 --> 01:30:57,766
By my hand, you will know the
consequence of your actions.

1210
01:31:00,133 --> 01:31:02,214
So don't screw it up.

1211
01:31:06,054 --> 01:31:09,286
The fat man's
got his eye on you, kid.

[squeaking]

1213
01:31:41,031 --> 01:31:42,373
Mmm.

1214
01:32:04,678 --> 01:32:06,790
Why don't you all take 15?

1215
01:32:06,918 --> 01:32:08,805
Uh, I'd really
rather not.

1216
01:32:08,935 --> 01:32:10,982
I wasn't asking.

1217
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:12,646
[Chris] If there's one thing
I've learned, 7,

1218
01:32:12,775 --> 01:32:14,822
it's never argue with

I am.

1224
01:32:32,998 --> 01:32:34,630
