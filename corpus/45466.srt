00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,900

Venga.

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,100
That will teach to you to respect to me.

7
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
Abran the doors.

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,300
I am Zao.

11
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,500
You you arrive late.

12
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,800
Mr. Van Vier.

13
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,600
- he was waiting for this encounter.
- I also.

14
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,800
My African military friends thank to him, Colonel Moon.

15
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,300
Few men have nutgalls to deal with conflicting diamonds...

16
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,100
... after the embargo of the UN

17
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,200
Conozco the UN I studied very well in Oxford and Harvard.

18
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,600
I know that it registers in hipocresía western.

19
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,400
Seeing its modest collection of cars, never had said it.

20
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,800
- Muéstreme the diamonds.
- Muéstreme the arms.

21
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,700
Traigan the arms.

22
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,600
Meeting the arms in demilitarized zone...

23
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,900
... surrounded by minefields.

24
00:06:05,200 --> the 00:06:07,700
cultural contribution of the USA

25
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,500
a million terrestrial mines...

26
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
... and my hovercrafts float on them.

27
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,600
Grenade launcher, flame thrower, arms and the ammunition
sufficient to wage a small war.

28
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,000
My diamonds.

29
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,600
fast Chequéalo.

30
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,500
- they do not spend everything of once.
- No, I have a special plan for this reluctant one.

31
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,000
Its name is James Bond, an English assassin.

32
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,000
Mr. Van Vier, I will teach something to him.

33
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,700
Our antitank...

34
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,700
... with projectiles of an impoverished
area, obvious.

35
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,500
Of course.

36
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,600
How will kill you to me now?

37
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,300
Mr. Bond.

38
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Is pathetic. The British still are created
with right to be the guardians of the world.

39
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,900
But, you will not live to see the day in
that the North will dominate all Korea

40
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Already we have something in common.

41
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,800
- Who is?
- Where he is my son?

42
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,800
Is the general.

43
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,500
- Hello... father.
- Why there is a fire there?

44
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,900
I will be there in five minutes.

45
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,200
Saquen the arms from...

46
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,800
... and kill the spy here.

47
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,100
I have been saved by the bell.

48
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,600
My son is dead.

49
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,400
ANOTHER DAY TO DIE

50
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,400
14 Months Later

51
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
I do not approve what she is made here.

52
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Quéjese to the manager.

53
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,700
Insiste on joking.

54
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,300
Challenging one until the end.

55
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,300
Their friends have left it.

56
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,300
Even deny their existence.

57
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,400
Why keeps silence?

58
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,500
Now no longer matters.

59
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,400
No longer is in my hands.

60
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,400
we have arrived in the end, Mr. Bond.

61
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,100
Ahórreme the morbosa part.

62
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,100
50 years after the superpowers
divided to Korea in two...

63
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,700
... you you appear here.

64
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,400
A British spy.

65
00:19:04,400 --> 0:19:05,900
A assassin.

66
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,900
Now the extremists have the
test that we cannot trust the West.

67
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,700
You...

68
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,000
You snatched my son.

69
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,200
Its firing squad had to do it by me

70
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,100
I waited for...

71
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,000
Deseaba that the western education helped
him to become a bridge between our worlds.

72
00:19:37,700 --> the 00:19:41,700
But only one that did, was to corrupt it.

73
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,300
Acabemos of once, wants?

74
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,900
My son had an ally in the West.

75
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,400
For the last time, who was...

76
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,500
Who caused that it betrayed to its
mother country and its name?

77
00:19:57,500 --> the 00:19:59,600
same one that betrayed to me

78
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,700
returned Dese.

79
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,700
Empiece to walk.

80
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Siga walking, please.

81
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,100
Siga advancing.

82
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,900
Zao...

83
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,100

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600

Mírelo.

86
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,700
Who would say that it is a hero.

87
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Very well, we go.

88
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,600
In the exploration, are not appraised biological
agents. He is clean.

89
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,900
Pulse 72. Arterial pressure 12/8.

90
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,600
enzymatic Indications of neurotoxina,
sistamina, serotonin and inhibitors.

91
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,400
Poison of scorpion.

92
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,300
Also detect antiserum of a poison. They would have
pricked and soon administered it the antidote.

93
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,600
Even so, their internal devices do
not seem affected.

94
00:22:26,600 --> the 00:22:30,400
and liver is not in good conditions.
There is no doubt, is him

95
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,600
Welcome one.

96
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,500
That hospitality.

97
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,700
does not seem very contented to see me.

98
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
If outside by me, still it would
follow in Korea of the North.

99
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,300
Its freedom has been to us very expensive.

100
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,900
Zao.

101 00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,900
Intentó to torpedo a summit between
Korea South and Chinese del.

102
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,100
Mató to three Chinese agents before they catched it.

103
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,900
Now is free.

104
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,000
I did not ask for the interchange.

105
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,300
Before seeing frees it, would prefer to have died.

106
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Tenía its cyanide.

107
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,400
I took leave of him years ago.
To what demons all this comes?

108
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
best North American agent...

109
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
... infiltrated in the norcoreano High Command,
was executed one week ago.

110
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,800
the North Americans detected a signal
from their prison that exposed it.

111
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,300
- and thinks that I was?
- there were no more resources.

112
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,600
Dedujeron that one had crumbled and
that was giving the information them.

113
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,200
Teníamos to remove it.

114
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,700
and you what you create?

115
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,500
With the drugs that they provided to him,
could not know that it said or no.

116
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,500
Conozco the rules.

117
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,800
and number one is that there are no treatments.
If they take hold to you, dates by lost.

118
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,700
the mission was seen it jeopardize.

119
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,300
Somebody alerted to Moon, exposing to me.

120
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,900
Tenía a partner in the West.
His father even knew it.

121
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,700
Is certain or no, that is irrelevant.

122
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,300
No, is not it

123
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,200
same that exposed to me, now has
tended me another trap to remove to Zao.

124
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,900
So that I think to go by him

125
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,600
To the only place that will go is to our
center of evalución of the Falklands.

126
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,900
- the status of 00 is terminated to him.
- Along with my freedom?

127
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,400
While I consider it necessary, yes

128
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,500
Now is not to us useful.

129
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,700
I discharge the from the hospital.

130
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,200
Thanks for the kiss of the life.

131
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,300

I am glad much to see it.

136
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,300
Mr. Chan.

137
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,200
Abran the Presidential Suite. Perhaps

138
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,500

And something of food.

139
00:28:21,500 --> the 00:28:25,400

52
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,100

153
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,300

- By the addiction of the flown tobacco.

180
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,000
Arde slowly.
181
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,800
Never is consumed.

182
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,200
- Since I do that it dozes.
- I feel this abrupt one to wake up.

183
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,900
I love my country, Mr. Bond.

184
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,500
Never would request to
him that it betrayed its town.

185
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,200
Busco a norcoreano.

186
00:33:22,200 --> a 00:33:24,500
- tourist?
- Terrorist.

187
00:33:24,500 --> the 00:33:27,900
terrorist of a man is the
liberator of another one.

188
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,900
To Zao does not interest the
freedom to him of the others.

189
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,200
Still I have left friends in the high spheres.

190
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,800
I have remembered favors and
distributed some dollars.

191
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,800
Encontramos to its friend here.
In an island.

192
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,800
In the Organos.

193
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,000
is a clinical stranger
directed by the Dr There Alvarez.

194
00:33:59,500 --> a 00:34:01,600
figure of the genic therapy.

195
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,900
is dedicated to increase the life
expectancy of ours loved leaders.

196
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,400
and by supesto, of western the richest ones.

197
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,600
Can that we lost freedom
with the revolution but...

198
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,700
... we have sitema sanitary incomparable.

199
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,700
To you you do not seem to him to
have gone badly with the revolution.

200
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,500
Each one has its form to solve.

201
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,900
would surprise to know whichever
officials to Him of the government go to me...

202
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,200
... in search of memories of the declining time.

203
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,500
- It could prestármelos?
- Please.

204
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,700
My sources have said to me that
that such Zao is very dangerous.

205
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,900
I would like to be more useful to him.

206
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
would go a fast car well to Me.

207
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,400
Gentleman, the papers for its
enter tomorrow the Clinic Alvarez.

208
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,100
Already went being hour, Fidel.

209

Quiero that you take more
girls to me. To room 42.

210
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,700
Unless you prefer that they call
" Castrated Fidel to you ".

211
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,500
Magnificent view.

212
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Yes, already I create it.

213
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,300
Is a pain that nobody plus
knows it to appreciate.
214
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,300
Mojito?

215
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Would have to prove.

216
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Jacinta Johnson.

217
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,200
- My friends call Jinx to me.
- mine they call James to me Bond.

218
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,600
Jinx does not mean bad of eye?

219
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,200
Nací Friday and 13.

220
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,600
Cree in the bad luck?

221
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,800
Only we say that my relations are broken immediately.

222
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,100
I know that one feels.

223
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,300
the predators appear to the fall of sun

224
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,600
- Why reason...
- It is when their prey leaves to drink.

225
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,800
Very hard for you?

226
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,800
Acabaría liking I, if she had time.

227
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,900
Of whichever time arranges?

228
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,500
- Until the dawn. And you?
- I am in favor here of the birds.

229
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,100
- I am ornithologist.
- Ornithologist.

230
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,800
That word.

231
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,500
Supongo that lechuzas will maintain
it occupied tonight.

232
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
is no lechuzas in the Devices.

233
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,900
is nothing no to see until the morning.

234
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,600
At least in the outside.

235
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,700
What makes a predator when
it begins to grow dark?

236
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,400
occurs festín.

237
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,800
As if there was not a morning.

238
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:18,500
- you are Always so juguetón?
- the tact of a good woman Was strange.

239
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,900
Who says that it is good?

240
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,100
What carajo you love?
I do not need a wheelchair.

241
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,000
No? Now yes

242
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,300
Is well.

243
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
ISLAND DEVICES

244
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,600
Hello.

245
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,200
You want to be put under a therapy
of DNA substitution

246
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,100
I will explain the two phases to Him.

247
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,700
In Phase 1 we eliminated its
marrow and we cleaned DNA completely

248
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,200
In phase 2 we introduce a DNA coming from healthy donors.

249
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,200
Orphans, deserters, people without
family to whom nobody will miss.

250
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,500
I like to consider an artist me.

251
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,400
and I am it when I create.

252
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,500
Thanks.

253
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,700
Temo that is a painful process.

254
00:43:23,700 --> the 00:43:27,700
But authentic art is it

255
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,900
Will be a pleasure to work with you.

256
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:40,000
and you know that to the great artists them
usually she recognizes herself once dead.

257
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,300
to Finally you do case me.

258
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,100
Who pays the metamorphosis to you, Zao?

259
00:45:20,200 --> the 00:45:23,600
person who exposed to me in Korea of the North.
260
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,800
James. What happens?

261
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,800
Jinx, salt of here, runs!

262
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:51,600
Friend mine, its chemical composition indicates
to us that they are of Mountain range Lioness.

263
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
conflicting Diamantes.

264
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,100
and seems here that there is a mark.

265
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,200
- GG.
- Déjeme to see

266
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,300
Yes.

267
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,100
Of the Greg corporation of Iceland.

268
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,700
That is its laser company/signature. There

269
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:20,300
a certain Gustav Serious discovered diamonds
a year or something ago thus.

270
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,500
Are identical to conflicting diamonds.

271
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,500
a amazing coincidence.

272
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,700
How can escape of a ship military...

273
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,600
... in means of Hong Kong, in front of its noses?

274
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,400
- a interesting transmitter, Moneypenny.
- it is Only a warning of storm.
275
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,700
assumed that it had to throw the key.
Not to leave the opened door of pair in pair

276
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,800
is insinuating that I have had
something to see in that flight?

277
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,300
- Good, Bond escaped very quickly.
- it is trained to do it.

278
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,200
been very has occupied training.
It appeared in Cuba, set afire a clinic.

279
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,800
Escuche, puts order in its house, or we will do.

280
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:21,300
- Its drink, Mr.
- Thank heavens that I requested it mixed.
281
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,900
SERIOUS GUSTAV the Diamond King

282
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,100
- I believe that his man will not come.
- I would say that she arrives precise.

283
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,400
- day ideal to be named " Sir ".
- Will use its title, Mr. Graves?

284
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,400
You know me, I am proud of my country of
adoption, but I do not like the ceremonies.

285
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,900
With an arrival like the one of today,
will not surprise it that they describe
it as addict to the adrenalin.

286
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,700
Prefiero " adventurous " term
287
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,400
we have heard rumors on the space project Ícarus.

288
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,800
- Which is the secret?
- it is not a secret, is a surprise.

289
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,900
Soon will be dazzled.

290
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,400
would say that it does not stop to work.
It is truth that does not need to sleep?

291
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,600
Only we have a life, why to squander sleeping it?

292
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,300
Intentará to enter the British Olympic equipment of fencing?

293
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,800
- We listened that it trains with rage.
- I do not do anything with rage.

294
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,400
As he says himself in fencing... " Now not to touch ".

295
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:14,100
Very well, thanks to all. Understand that
we cannot make wait for more to Its Majesty.

296
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:49,200
Verity? James Bond.

00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,500
Its weapon.

298
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,000
Tiene a good handling of a weapon.

299
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,700
Tengo fame to maintain high the end affluent.

300
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,800
would matter to Him? I believe that one has untied to me.

351
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,300
Since we have improved the bet, we also improve the arms.

352
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,100
we will do It to old usanza.

353
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,000
Piede first that it bleeds in the torso.

354
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,800
Already is sufficient.

355
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,000
Only is a sport, Miranda.

356
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,200
Parece that it has won to me, Mr. Bond.

357
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,400
Saldemos accounts down.

358
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,500
Miranda.

359
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,400
you Are a great challenge, Mr. Bond.

360
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,100
East weekend, organized in Iceland

362
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,400
wants to accompany to us. Ocúpate of everything, Miranda.

363
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,800
Before I must file harshness with the club.

364
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,400
That I without you would do?

365
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,000
Tendré the pleasure of its company in Iceland?

366
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,800
Temo that never will have that pleasure, Mr. Bond.

367
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,600
Perdone Bond Commander.
Somebody left something him.

368
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,700
Sooner or later was necessary to redecorate the premises.

369
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,600
had heard speak of this place.

370
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,300
Never I thought about being here to my same one.

371
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,300
Hay things that are safer under earth.

372
01:01:09,400 --> a 01:01:11,200
left station...

373
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,400
... for left agents.

374
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,900

... and now it asks for my aid.

378
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,800
That is what hoped, an excuse?

379
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,400

01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,200
I cannot allow the luxury to see all target or black me.

383
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,600
- While it was outside, the world changed.
- For me no.

384
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,300

I would not be here.

Of the anything to a whole is a sigh.

01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:10,980

we had heard rumors, but I never thought that existed

397
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:29,000
Now no longer exists.

398
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,600
Zao was able to save...

399
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,100
