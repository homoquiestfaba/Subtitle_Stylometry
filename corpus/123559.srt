00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,231
(¢Ü "Taste for Life" by Scott Miller)

3
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,204
Hey, Billy.

4
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,072
- Why not shake another one?
- I can't, Hoover. I gotta go.

5
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,168
Come on. Just one more?

6
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,544
I'll go out with you Saturday night.

7
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,277
You know, if your name wasn't Hoover..

8
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,750
Yeah, OK.

9
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,562
You know I don't smoke pot.
It destroys your memory.

10
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,965
(giggling) No, it doesn't.

11
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,593
- I have a riddle for you.
- Yeah?

12
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,197
What's white and gets shoved in your face
by a screaming landlord?

13
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,334
I wanna say
a free, trial-size bottle of shampoo.

14
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,503
- An eviction notice.
- (scoffs)

15
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,742
And where is said eviction notice?

16
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,806
You're smokin' it.

17
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,211
Ooh, you got some other mail, though.

18
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,622
Ugh! Great.
Let's just pile it on, why don't we?

19
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:57,952
Oh! Shit! This is from that snowboarding
academy I applied to two months ago.

20
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,693
Hey, if I get accepted,
this could change our lives forever.

21
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,960
Open it.

22
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,793
Gimme a hit of this first.

23
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,375
You know I don't smoke pot.
It destroys your memory.

24
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,438
No, it doesn't!

25
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,745
Oh, shit! This is from the snowboarding
academy I applied to two months ago.

26
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,811
If I'm accepted,
this could change our lives forever!

27
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,720
Open it.

28
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,657
Pine Mountain Academy, here I come!

29
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,719
(both whoop)

30
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,495
- Case, thanks for comin' with me.
- What are best friends for?

31
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,506
How are you gonna pay
for this fancy-shmancy academy anyway?

32
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,439
I'm just gonna use
the money my parents gave me

33
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,238
when I promised
they never had to see me again.

34
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,303
- (Casey laughs)
- But check this out, though.

35
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,680
"The Pine Mountain Academy
was founded by Colonel Jaffe, retired,"

36
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:55,243
and since its conception
they have produced three gold medalists,

37
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:59,519
four national champions and a Saturday
morning cartoon series in the Netherlands.

38
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,856
Hey, maybe you just might fall in love
with an academy member.

39
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,625
Maybe I will.

40
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,825
They have a state-of-the-art
training facility.

41
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,767
Check out this pipe!

42
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,830
And they have the steepest vertical
in the country. What's it called? The Goat.

43
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,602
Only two men
have ever skied it and lived.

44
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:20,009
Oooh! The Goat!
Death trap. Very cool.

45
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,274
It also says that the locals
are a group of colorful natives

46
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,781
happy to serve your every need,

47
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,183
and only academy members
are allowed on the slope.

48
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,789
How's it going, Cornhole?
I meant Colonel.

49
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,556
Well, I'll tell you, boys..
it's not goin' that good.

50
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:44,832
You see, I was about 90 seconds
into a three-minute soft-boiled

51
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,566
when I saw you little shitbirds
crappin' on my snow.

52
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,734
We just pissed!
We meant no disrespect, brah.

53
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,712
Well, I guess it's no surprise to me
that you hogs can't read.

54
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,943
You little cocksuckers got five seconds
to get off my mountain!

55
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,518
Let's time it!

56
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:04,284
(all) Five.. four.. three.. two.. one!

57
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,552
(all) Aaargh! Aaargh!

58
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,724
(Casey) Hey, look, Billy.
There's a "Help Wanted" sign.

59
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,724
Ha! Even in the middle of nowhere
there's a.. Naomibucks?

60
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,996
(both giggle)

61
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,096
- Oh!
- Fuckin' asshole!

62
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:57,734
I'm sorry you hit the ground, but maybe
you should be watchin' where you're goin'.

63
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,335
Watch where I'm goin'! (chuckles)

64
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,040
Well, I would love
to watch where I'm goin'.

65
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,243
The only problem with that is..

66
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,809
I'm fucking blind!

67
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,787
I'm blind!

68
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,121
Oh, sweet Jesus. I didn't know.

69
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,888
Hey, you must be blind too!

70
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,522
I'm yellin' at another blind guy!
That's horrible!

71
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,162
You wanna touch faces
and see what we look like?

72
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,170
The thing is, I'm not.. blind.

73
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,199
Well!

74
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,705
Joke's on me.

75
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,470
In that case..

76
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,535
fuck you!

77
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,445
Oh, by the way.

78
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,610
Name's Blind Danny Temples.
My card.

79
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,985
For all your housing and realty needs,
gimme a call. I'll help you out.

80
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,047
Welcome to Schittville.

81
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,918
(entrance bell)

82
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,461
- I need a coffee. Do you want one?
- Sure.

83
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,364
Hello..

84
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,963
- Naomi.
- Hi. Billy.

85
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:07,704
- Can I get a couple of coffees?
- Well, Billy boy, get ready for a treat.

86
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,090
- Eight bucks.
- Oh.

87
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,961
Keep the change.

88
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,789
Check it!
The new dude's got wood!

89
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,461
(laughter)

90
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,009
- So do you!
- I know! So does Shaft!

91
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,042
My shit is rock-hard!

92
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:47,151
- Quite a little think tank they've got goin
- Aw, just havin' a little good-natured fun.

93
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,916
I'm gonna get in with these guys.
Use a little bit of the Wagstaff charm.

94
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,548
Hey, brahs!

95
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,887
Billy Wagstaff.

96
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,985
Just got accepted to the academy.

97
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,827
Might be Olympic gold medalist someday.

98
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:06,600
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm Balls, that's Shaft, that's Grabs,

99
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,606
Sack and Gash.

100
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,609
We got a special way of welcoming
academy members, brah.

101
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,936
(loud farts)

102
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,315
- (high-pitched farts)
- Oh! Oops.

103
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,608
(can't fart)

104
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,613
I'll be back.

105
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,959
Those must be those "colorful, happy
natives, here to serve our every need."

106
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,155
Ha, ha.

107
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,156
(explosive fart)

108
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,463
I did it!

109
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,801
Uh-oh.

110
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,113
Oh, God. It's too hot.

111
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,823
(shrieks) Oh, God!

112
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:19,802
(woman) Colonel Jaffe,
there's a Billy Wagstaff here to see you.

113
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,177
Oh, good.
I'll be right out, Lizzie.

114
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:26,480
Suzy. It's Suzy.
I've only been here for 11 years.

115
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,020
Ah, Jesus, I hurt.

116
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,919
Now, here's a tip.

117
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,517
Never call him "Coach."
You have to call him "Colonel."

118
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,562
Or he'll hurt you
in places that don't show.

119
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,925
Funny!

120
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:48,167
Yeah.. I get it. He's probably
the nicest guy in the world, isn't he?

121
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,040
At ease, Lizzie!
I'll take this young man from here.

122
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,636
A day early! I like that.

123
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,148
Shows keen interest.
Shows desire.

124
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,877
It's a good quality.

125
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,111
Unless you've been
invited over for dinner.

126
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,586
(both men chuckle)

127
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,644
Billy Wagstaff.

128
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,487
William Wagstaff,
Venice Beach, California. I know.

129
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,050
I recognize you
from your application video.

130
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,119
Shows some raw talent, son.

131
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,792
Well, you know, the video's a year old. I go
some new moves I can't wait to show you.

132
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,859
I'm all chicken skin
just thinkin' about it.

133
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,734
Colonel Jaffe, retired.

134
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,602
I'm also the coach
here at the academy.

135
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,040
Ah. What do you prefer?
"Coach" or "Colonel"?

136
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,340
I prefer "God."

137
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,107
But that would be unseemly.

138
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,881
I'd show you around the academy myself,
son, but I'm a little busy right now.

139
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:39,152
So I'm gonna have my daughter Winter
give you the grand tour.

140
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:43,889
Winter! Report to admissions office,
double time, soldier!

141
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:48,297
- Do you copy?
- I'm coming, Daddy! I'm coming!

142
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,159
Copy that!

143
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,330
(grunting)

144
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,271
(both sigh)

145
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,474
Thank you.

146
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,576
Go, go.

147
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,419
That's real attractive, Brandt.

148
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,126
(moans)

149
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,103
I'm her daddy.

150
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,664
Yes, Daddy?

151
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,644
Winter, I want you to meet Billy Wagstaff,
a new member of the academy.

152
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:38,274
- Billy, meet Winter.
- That's an interesting name, Winter.

153
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,944
So is.. Billy.

154
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:46,918
I named her Winter
because she's as pure as the driven snow.

155
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,153
I hear different and someone dies.

156
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,059
Now, I want you to show Wagstaff here

157
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,598
everything the academy has to offer,
little girl.

158
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,659
And save that halfpipe till last.
All right?

159
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,365
We got the best halfpipe
in the country, son.

160
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:04,374
- Yeah? What happened to the other half?
- Very humorous.

161
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,908
I want you back here at 0600
for orientation.

162
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,744
Maybe you can see
how funny myworld is.

163
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,810
- Man.
- Let's go, Mr. Wagstaff.

164
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,547
Hey, Winter.

165
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,919
Why don't you let me
show the new guy around?

166
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,185
I'm sure
you've got better things to do.

167
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,251
Thought I did,
but they weren't any better.

168
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:27,857
I'd be more than happy
to show the new member around myself.

169
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,924
Come on.

170
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,895
(Billy) Whoo! Yeah, Winter!
Looking good!

171
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,548
Wait till you see the gorge.

172
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,989
It's tight and wet,
but it sure feels good when you go down it.

173
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,082
- Race you to the bottom.
- You got it.

174
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,115
- Well?
- It's great. Everything is great.

175
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,912
Can we ride it?

176
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,113
And can you go first?
You know, just give me the lay of the land.

177
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,679
Who told you my nickname?

178
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,283
- Oh-ho.
- Follow me if you can keep up.

179
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,588
Keeping up is no problem.
God, I love her.

180
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,261
(¢Ü "High" by Hydrophonix)

181
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:34,583
This is a little move I like to call
"Keep the change."

182
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,359
Make sure the steam is blowing up against
the boobies so the na-nas stand up.

183
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:44,232
Then make sure you get some foam
on the ta-tas.

184
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,670
And then dip with your finger like this.

185
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,076
And then put your finger
all the way in your mouth to lick it off.

186
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,047
There you go.

187
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,981
That'll be four dollars.

188
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:02,850
(shuffling bills)

189
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,184
Keep the change.

190
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,021
That was so.. cool.

191
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,197
Yep.

192
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,099
These tits are practically
paying for themselves.

193
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,503
I don't think I have the na-nas, the ta-tas,
the boo-boos or the ba-bas for that.

194
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,303
You're right.
Those aren't exactly moneymakers.

195
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,812
But I think we can work with
that little ass of yours.

196
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,906
- Get me a muffin.
- OK.

197
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,722
Oh, yeah, that works.

198
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,883
Looks like I got a new muffin girl.

199
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,115
- So, what dorm are you staying in?
- Oh, I can't afford to.

200
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,775
My friend and I
are getting a place in town.

201
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,876
In town?

202
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,183
You're gonna live with the poories?

203
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,051
Poories?

204
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,182
That's what we call
the locals in Schittville.

205
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:18,821
Poories - 'cause they're poor.
Get it? Poor..ies.

206
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,268
Yeah, um..
I guess that makes me a poorie.

207
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:34,802
What do you guys call yourselves?
The richies, 'cause you're rich..ies?

208
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,071
As a matter of fact, we do.

209
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,674
Oh. Clever. Yeah.

210
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,083
I hope you were clever enough
to wear a lot of warm clothes.

211
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,521
- Why?
- Because I don't hang out with poories.

212
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:50,518
See you in another life -
hopefully a richer one. Bye-bye.

213
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,995
Aaaarghhh!

214
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,767
God, I'm in love.

215
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:06,938
Casey Richards, welcome to paradise!

216
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,405
- Oh.
- Huh?

217
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,281
I think you made the right choice
coming to Blind Danny Temples

218
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,446
for all your realty needs.

219
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:20,686
Now, just so you know,
the trick to being blind

220
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,091
is to memorize your surroundings.

221
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,153
That's the key.

222
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,630
- (screams)
- (Casey) Oh, God!

223
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,326
Oh, my God!

224
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,996
Don't help me, don't help me.
I'm not a cripple, I'm not a cripple.

225
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,666
Cane, cane, cane, cane, cane!

226
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,731
- Here.
- Thank you.

227
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,798
You're welcome.

228
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,277
- So, what do you think?
- Uh..

229
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:45,009
As you can see,
this is our deluxe single.

230
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:49,816
And.. this is all fresh paint.
Just had this done.

231
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,449
If you step right this way,
you will see..

232
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,393
the most beautiful
mountain view in all Pine Valley!

233
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,930
- Beautiful!
- (sniffs) Take a smell!

234
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:03,058
- Ah! That mountain air!
- (coughs)

235
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,602
And that's Schittville.

236
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,728
So, what do you think?

237
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,070
- You wanna rent the place?
- Sure.

238
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,305
All right. Enjoy.

239
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,811
Thanks.

240
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,408
- Let me help you to the door.
- I don't need help, I don't need help.

241
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,215
I've got this place memorized to a T.

242
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,380
Whoo! (laughs)

243
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,120
Can't believe those idiots
rented this shithole.

244
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:33,130
- Here, Danny, want me to show you out?
- Oh, Jesus!

245
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,962
- (nervous chuckle) I was kiddin' around.
- Yeah?

246
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,025
- It was a joke!
- Yeah?

247
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,866
- It's not bad.
- Tell that to him.

248
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,473
Yeah, it's not too bad
for a couple of poories.

249
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,410
- Poories? What's that?
- It's what they call us at the academy.

250
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:59,480
- Why? Because we're poor?
- Well, actually, yeah.

251
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,424
OK, so what do they do?
They call themselves the richies?

252
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,452
No.

253
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,588
Yes.

254
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,644
- Hey, is this the..?
- No talking in the lecture hall.

255
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,950
Well, how are we gonna get a lecture
if there's no talking in the lecture hall?

256
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,753
(German accent) No wisecracking
in the lecture hall either,

257
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,793
mystery party crasher.

258
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,253
(Nordic accent) Keep the talking,

259
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:43,165
and my ass you can be eating,
'cause I'm making the bad report on you,

260
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,497
new blabby guy.

261
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,194
OK..

262
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,735
(sighs) Fun group.

263
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,836
Ten-hut!

264
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,648
As you were, gentlemen.

265
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,584
Introduce yourselves to the new recruit,
William Wagstaff.

266
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,922
Hey, brahs.

267
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,256
We don't refer to people
as "bra," Wagstaff.

268
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,320
You see, a bra is something
that holds up a woman's titties.

269
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,025
Is that what you are?
Something that holds up a woman's titties?

270
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,534
On a good day, yeah.

271
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,591
(Billy chuckles)

272
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,128
- What do you think this is? Jay Leno?
- (roars of laugher)

273
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,765
This is the best of the best.

274
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:31,840
What I'm saying is.. snowboarding
is the relentless pursuit of perfection,

275
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,214
which, of course,
is the American way.

276
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,279
Now let me introduce you
to the members

277
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:42,623
of the Pine Mountain Academy
all-American snowboarding team!

278
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,355
From Germany,

279
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,420
Hans Gruber!

280
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,858
From Sweden, Sven Darden!

281
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:55,032
From Russia, Nootnik Kratzin!

282
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:02,041
From Switzerland, via Israel,
Schlomo Boardstein!

283
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,140
And you will buddy up
with my team captain,

284
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,551
America's own Brandt Von Hoffman!

285
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,514
For your professional needs,
talk to me.

286
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,117
For your personal needs,
talk to my daughter, Winter.

287
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,957
(knowing laughter)

288
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,554
All right!
Everyone up on that hill!

289
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,793
Let's see what you got!

290
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:55,699
What the fuck are you doing on skis,
you homo, Schlomo?

291
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,031
Don't you know
this is a snowboard academy?

292
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,095
Total bagel job, Schlomo! Zero!

293
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,176
Hey, have a good run, Nootnik.

294
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,680
Your dick is so small,
I would not even suck it.

295
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,818
Yeah, it takes a while to learn
the language, but I get what you mean!

296
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,352
Thank you.

297
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:23,019
You snowboard
as good as you talk, Nootnik!

298
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,360
And your mother's a whore!

299
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,067
- Hey, good luck, Sven.
- Ja?

300
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:35,732
And you have nice cumshots on your face,
you bitch jerk-off.

301
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,206
Sven is in the house.

302
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:43,270
Yeah, you guys
are a great bunch of kidders!

303
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,980
Hey, Hans.

304
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,851
Hi, Billy!
Welcome to the academy!

305
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,822
I hope this experience
will be good fun for you.

306
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:58,727
I got a chili bean stuck in my starfish. You
might wanna suck it out, you Nazi fuck!

307
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,821
What?

308
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,356
Oh..

309
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:04,963
Oh, God. He was being nice.

310
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:07,163
Thank you, Hans!

311
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:18,814
I'd rather fuck a dog - your dog -
than watch you do this again.

312
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:23,878
All right, Brandt! Show Billy boy here
what it takes to be a national champion!

313
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,657
Hey, Brandt.

314
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:31,059
You know, Wagstiff,
you got no shot with Winter Jaffe.

315
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,359
You might fuck her,
but that's as far as it's gonna go.

316
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,093
Actually, Brandt,
that would be plenty for me.

317
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:41,769
I'm gonna do everything I can to get you
kicked out of this academy, Wagstiff.

318
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,276
Just in case you thought
you knew how to snowboard, watch this.

319
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,342
Way to go, Brandt! Beautiful!

320
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,442
Nice move, Brandt!

321
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,083
All right!

322
00:25:56,154 --> 00:26:01,251
OK, Billy! Show these goofballs
why I let you into school!

323
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:22,410
What was that, Wagstaff? Huh?
All that wigglin' around up there.

324
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,041
You look like you got a combination
of Tourette's and the runs.

325
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,381
(phony laughter)

326
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,614
Ha ha ha!

327
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,351
Maybe I should dig up Katharine Hepburn,
throw her in there.

328
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,858
She'd give me a smoother run.

329
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:40,887
- I've always been a big fan of her work.
- Oh! He's got the balls to sass me!

330
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,595
I think I know
how to get the punk out of you.

331
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,799
How about a nice long ride
all the way down the mountain, huh?

332
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:52,001
And if you fall, you start over.

333
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,068
Yes, sir.

334
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:58,309
No, no. Where are you going, Wagstaff?
The lift is for snowboarders.

335
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,977
Ass wiggling go-go dancers walk.

336
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,111
Seriously?

337
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,220
Well, how did I miss that?

338
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,159
Have a nice walk, Britney.

339
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,493
(PA) Attention
all Pine Mountain Academy members!

340
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:16,659
Please report to
the annual calendar shoot.

341
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,760
Except you, Wagstaff.

342
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,520
I am going to die!

343
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,619
(Naomi) Do it outside.

344
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,961
How was your first day?

345
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,762
Pain.. and terror.

346
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,064
The school's having a party tonight.
You wanna go?

347
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,629
- Cool.
- Great.

348
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:34,077
I'm gonna go home, lay down for a while.
Coach made me walk the mountain today.

349
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:37,137
You must've wiggled your ass
like a go-go girl.

350
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,240
Can't you read the fuckin' sign?

351
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,445
Tell you what, sloppy.
I'll give you an acupuncture treatment.

352
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,681
- For real?
- Fuckin' A.

353
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,884
My parents are Benihana chefs -
long story, don't ask.

354
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:51,156
- Look, you want my help or not?
- Does it hurt?

355
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,221
- Have you ever had blood drawn?
- Yeah. That wasn't so bad.

356
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,928
Just like that -
only 600 times in 20 minutes.

357
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,401
Oh, don't be such a pussy!

358
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:05,533
(¢Ü "Also Sprach Zarathustra"
by Richard Strauss)

359
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,942
I see the problem.

360
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,147
Your lower back is in spasm.

361
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,556
I'm gonna have to stick some needles
in your ass now, sweetie.

362
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:24,652
Um.. But my butt feels fine.

363
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,721
I'll say!

364
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:39,401
Why does my butt feel like
it needs to cough?

365
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,935
I, uh.. I heat the needles.

366
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,107
(coughs)

367
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:51,110
Will you just let the person that knows
what the fuck they're doing just do it?

368
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,714
- Hyah!
- OK, yeah. That hurt.

369
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,590
You know what they say -
no pain, no gain.

370
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,492
- Agh!
- No!

371
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,121
- Hyah!
- No!

372
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,825
- Cha!
- No!

373
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,697
- Vom!
- Oh!

374
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,861
- (shriek)
- Die, Daddy.

375
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,172
(whimper)

376
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,538
- Just 74 more to go, sweetie.
- Oh, God.

377
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,636
Here.

378
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,076
Bite this.

379
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,313
- It's all good.
- Really?

380
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,324
I love healing.

381
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,088
Oh!

382
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,122
Ooh!

383
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,687
- Yeah!
- Agh!

384
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,660
Your back feels better now,
doesn't it?

385
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,704
Yeah, back feels good.

386
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,866
My ass feels like
it's been clawed by a litter of panthers.

387
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,911
Your butt looks like
that guy from Hellraiser.

388
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:51,107
He's gonna be as good as new
in about an hour. My work here is done.

389
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,015
Now I'm gonna get myself all prettied up
for the party tonight.

390
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,849
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What about the needles?

391
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,786
Hm.

392
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:03,054
Casey? Yank 'em out in about half an hour.
Don't be gentle.

393
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:08,054
- Is that part of the therapy?
- No. It's just more fun that way. Toodles!

394
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,799
Wow. That is the sweetest, sexiest,

395
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,672
most brutal woman I've ever met.

396
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:21,268
- I think she kinda digs me.
- Really?

397
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,335
Aargh!

398
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:32,422
You know, back in the day,
there wasn't no richies or poories.

399
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,950
There was just whities..
and then there was others.

400
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,826
And guess who got to ski
the goddamn mountain.

401
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,198
It wasn't like they said
black folk could only ride the slushy hill,

402
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,260
but, hell,
we knewwhat "others" meant.

403
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,931
It wasn't like we didn't have our own rules
on the slushy hill.

404
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:53,444
I was a poor motherfucker back then,
and I could only afford one ski.

405
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:56,002
So I rode that slushy hill on one.

406
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,379
- You invented snowboarding?
- I called it "boogie-woogie one-ski."

407
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:03,944
Then I realized there was only one way
to free up the mountain

408
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,615
so all men could use it,

409
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:11,094
and that was to do the one thing
that no man had ever done before:

410
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,887
ski the Goat.

411
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,434
I boogie-woogie one-skied that Goat,

412
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:25,169
and for years after, all men -
and bitches too -

413
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,404
could ski Pine Mountain.

414
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,503
Oh, it was beautiful, babies.

415
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:35,909
But, like everything beautiful,
people fucked it all up.

416
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:40,151
I tried to stop 'em, but..
I was pretty fucked up my damn self.

417
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:45,491
Well, that's when the Colonel..
the motherfucker stole my one-ski idea

418
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:48,361
and had the mountain declared
a private skiing academy.

419
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,568
Then we was all
back on the slushy hill.

420
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,970
Brah, why don't you go do all that shit
again and get our mountain back for us?

421
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,166
(all) Yeah!

422
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:01,644
How am I supposed to do that, Balls?
Pretend I'm not tired, bitter and drunk?

423
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,550
(whistle)

424
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,019
Check it out.
It's the guys from the cafe.

425
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,320
- Yeah. Let's just go this way.
- No, no. Be polite.

426
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,920
Hey! Let me buy you brahs
a couple of glasses of suds.

427
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,159
Actually, you know, I'm not a bra, mister.
I'm a man.

428
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,826
Bras are what are used
to hold up women's breasts.

429
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,391
Look, we're only being nice to you

430
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,200
'cause we like the new muffin girl
with the dope ass.

431
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,762
(laughs)

432
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,902
And now we're not gonna
buy you any suds.

433
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,376
- Academy members only.
- William Wagstaff.

434
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,612
I should be somewhere on the list.

435
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,349
Oh, yeah.
You're the new half-poorie kid.

436
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,051
- And you are..?
- Casey Richards.

437
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,617
She's not in the academy.
She's my guest.

438
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,960
Sorry. Only members of the academy
can be guests.

439
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,900
Thanks! Billy, I'm gonna go hang out
with the less classy group over there.

440
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,960
Yeah, yeah.

441
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:07,774
Shot?

442
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:11,178
- Bubbles..
- Yeah.

443
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,739
Hey, Winter.

444
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,945
Um, yeah. Fuck off, sweetie.

445
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,319
- Hi!
- Hey.

446
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,856
Hi, Billy.

447
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:24,755
Come on. Don't tell me you're upset 'cause
you're not over there with your buddy.

448
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,820
Let me tell you
something about losin' a man.

449
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,458
There ain't one alive
worth sheddin' a tear over.

450
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,526
- Drink up, sister.
- So you've never been in love?

451
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:33,865
Maybe if I could find the guy

452
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,304
that could see past
my incredible good looks, perfect figure

453
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,365
and the sexiest mouth God ever created.

454
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,911
But I don't know if I could
find a guy like that in Schittville.

455
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,412
Maybe he's sitting right next to you.

456
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:47,713
Somebody better get Danny away
from that beaver before he fucks it - again.

457
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,654
So you didn't tell me
you even had a poorie girlfriend.

458
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,919
(singsong)
Somebody might need a blood test.

459
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:58,291
Casey? She's not my girlfriend.

460
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:02,230
I've known her since I was, like, six.
She's kind of like my sister.

461
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,791
I don't know. She's very pretty.

462
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,402
She is?

463
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:13,069
Look at him, sittin' over there
like he owns the damn place.

464
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,477
I hate that asshole.
He can suck my..

465
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:17,980
Black cock!

466
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,449
And he knows it too.

467
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:24,784
Straight, upstandin',
cheap-ass whiskey-drinkin' motherfucker!

468
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,614
Bitch!

469
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,126
(blows)

470
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,162
Daddy, look who I found.

471
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:37,668
Well! Enjoy your hike there, son?
Or did my mountain kick your ass?

472
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,726
(raucous laughter)

473
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,806
My butt's seen better days, sir.

474
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:53,241
Well, why don't you get yourself a nice
massage tomorrow up at the academy?

475
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:58,186
Just don't let that big-titted whore at the
coffee house stick any needles in your ass.

476
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:03,592
I hear she almost
bled some poor son of a bitch to death.

477
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,297
(raucous laughter)

478
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:18,170
Hi. I'm Brandt Von Hoffman,
Pine Mountain Academy team captain.

479
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,732
Second in command.

480
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,300
Casey Richards.

481
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:25,076
Let me be right up-front with you.
I'm a poorie, and proud of it.

482
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,513
Are you kidding?

483
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:31,544
I don't play all that stupid richie-poorie
crap like the rest of those snobs.

484
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:35,023
No. To me, people are people.

485
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:38,289
Rich or poor,
there's good and there's bad people.

486
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,525
But if you're into
that kind of segregation thing, I can split.

487
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,294
No, no!

488
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:47,326
I.. I just can't believe
I met someone who isn't.

489
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:51,364
So.. if I asked you to have a drink with me
you'd do it?

490
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,273
(Billy) Yeah, I'll be right back.

491
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,368
I'd love to.

492
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,936
Casey!

493
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:03,552
Oh, Case. I'm sorry, I think
I might have been inside for a long time.

494
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,715
- Brandt, this is my friend Billy.
- I know Billy!

495
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,726
Awesome ride
on the slopes today, brah.

496
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,025
This guy is one heck of a snowboarder.

497
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,792
I'm so glad you could make it.

498
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,390
Casey and I were about to grab a drink.
Can you join us?

499
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:20,733
Yeah.. No.
I gotta pee really bad.

500
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,137
(whispers) And I think
my ass might be bleeding.

501
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,869
- Good luck with that.
- OK.

502
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,712
(urinates, groans with relief)

503
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,683
I drank too much.

504
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,054
Hi, handsome. I've been looking for you.

505
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,389
Jesus, Winter!
You're not supposed to be in here.

506
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,897
Are you sure?
Your lips say no..

507
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:53,929
but your stream says yes!

508
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:58,704
- You want me to tap that off for you?
- No, no, no! I'm fine, thank you.

509
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,642
You want me to suck it for you?

510
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,510
I'm gonna have to say yes to that.

511
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,876
Sven, front and center.

512
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,111
- Ja, Colonel.
- Are you seeing my daughter?

513
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:11,154
Never from the front -
I swear it!

514
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,424
Jeez! Does your father know
you do stuff like this?

515
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,655
God, I hope so. (moans)

516
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,464
Hey, J.P., the Colonel's
mad-dogging you right now.

517
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,605
Well, goddamn. So he is.

518
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:34,435
Hey, Balls, you gonna let him do that
to me, your hero? After that story?

519
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:38,175
No way, brah. I got something
right here in my pocket for him.

520
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,240
Well, bust it out.

521
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,180
- (laughs)
- He's giving you the bird!

522
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,553
- The double bird!
- Bitch of a son!

523
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,484
Are you just gonna sit there?

524
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,085
Or are you gonna
do something about it?

525
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,494
Jawohl!

526
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,555
Hey, poories!

527
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,527
Freibier!

528
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,806
Dude, that hit me
right in the head!

529
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:10,313
Goddamn, boy! You can't let people
hit you in the head with beer bottles!

530
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,406
J.P.'S right.

531
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:16,476
- Let's kick some richie ass!
- (all) Yeah!

533
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,701
Come on, get in there.

534
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,550
Who's next? Who got some?
Sit down!

535
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:04,661
Get in there!
Hidin' behind me, you big queen.

536
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:13,342
Now I shall ass-beat you, big black man,
so the Colonel will like me more!

537
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,708
Sven is here.

538
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,178
A little help, Danny!

539
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,714
Up on that.

540
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,273
Thank you very much, my brother.

541
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,549
- Swing, Danny!
- (Danny whoops)

542
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,487
Nailed him!

543
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,888
(raucous laughter)

544
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,463
Ja.

545
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,866
Kick the asses.

546
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,529

Oh, yes!

549
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:50,441
Nothing like a well-deserved
evacuation of the bowels, son.

550
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,146
That sounds like your father.

551

(grunting)

552
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,916
Perfect.

553
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,820
What the hell is goin' on in there?

554
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,257
You gotta go. Go!

555

556
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:14,160
Colonel! I was just..

557
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,934
I know what you were doin',
you goddamn animal.

558
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,770
We don't go in for that
up here at Pine Mountain.

559
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:26,180
I don't knowwhat kind of..
small, blond man you found

560
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:31,517
to perform fellatio on you
here in a public environment,

561
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:36,925
but I'm sure his father feels shame
unlike any father has ever felt

562
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,461
since the dawn of time.

563
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:41,498
I don't like you, Wagstaff.

564
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:44,557
You're always doin' something
that you shouldn't be doin'.

565
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:48,537
Dancing on the slopes,
disobeying a direct order,

566
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:52,872
havin' sex in a shitter
with what was clearly a man.

567
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:58,674
Matter of fact,
you just made it to the top of my shit list.

568
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,880
Thank you, sir.
You won't be disappointed.

569
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,586
All right!
We can't have nice-nice.

570
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,060
(whistles) Move out!

just kicked his own ass.

(whistle)

573
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,006
I got my eye on you, blind man.

574
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,006
I got my ear on you.

Elevate, you limp-dicked mother-hump..

578
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:58,486
It's pathetic.
Wankers! I'm surrounded by wankers.

579
00:44:04,126 --> 00:44:06,060
I guess you wanna hear me say

580
00:44:06,128 --> 00:44:09,962
that that was creative and inventive
and fun to watch.

581
00:44:10,032 --> 00:44:12,125
Is that what you were thinking, Wagstaff?

582
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:15,034
I was told it was impolite
to ever refuse a compliment, sir, so..

583
00:44:15,104 --> 00:44:16,969
please, can I hear what you thought?

584
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:19,098
Here's my thought, dipshit.

585
00:44:19,175 --> 00:44:21,700
Watching you felt like..

586
00:44:21,777 --> 00:44:26,305
a small, intensely powerful wolverine

587
00:44:26,382 --> 00:44:30,648

588
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,585
Get to my office.

but I think I know
what you were gonna say.

598
00:45:38,888 --> 00:45:42,051
You want me to be team captain.
I don't think I've been here long enough

599
00:45:42,124 --> 00:45:45,821
to have gained the respect and admiration
of the other guys.

What the hell. I accept.

You know, that's just a crazy enough idea
to actually work.

No, you puke.

I've just spent more than a day and a half

606
00:46:07,016 --> 00:46:12,318
trying to mold you
into an Olympic-caliber snowboarder.

607
00:46:12,388 --> 00:46:16,586
I just realized
that I've been polishing a turd.

608
00:46:16,659 --> 00:46:19,924
You are fuckin' expelled.

Huh. Well, thank you for you support, sir.

about getting a tuition refund?

613
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:35,802
All right.
I'm leaving.

614
00:46:36,779 --> 00:46:41,682
Ooh. There's something I could tell you
about last night that would devastate you.

615
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:44,345
- But I got too much class for that.
- Gossip? Wait, get back here.

That's so you can breathe, Wagstaff.

Because we are no monsters, you know.

636
00:47:56,992 --> 00:47:59,324
You like hanging out
with the poories so much?

637
00:47:59,428 --> 00:48:02,397
Maybe you can show them
some of your fancy moves.

00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,900
I love it when the Colonel
orders a code red.

639
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:11,736
Just the sound of that body
thumping on the inside of that can.

640

645
00:48:30,526 --> 00:48:32,619
Ja.

646
00:49:00,623 --> 00:49:02,591
$500 for your thoughts.

647
00:49:03,192 --> 00:49:08,152
Well, I'm still a little mad at Billy,
but now I'm starting to get worried.

648
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:12,223
Listen, your friend got himself in a lot
of trouble before he quit the school.

649
00:49:12,301 --> 00:49:16,431
He stole his tuition money back. He
practically attacked the Colonel's daughter.

650
00:49:16,505 --> 00:49:21,306
And he seemed to be involved in some sort
of homosexual men's room scam.

651
00:49:21,377 --> 00:49:23,845
I've known Billy my whole life.
That just doesn't sound like him.

652
00:49:23,913 --> 00:49:27,371
Unfortunately, there's just some people
in this world who act nice,

653
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:30,941
but in truth they're not very nice at all.

654
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,648
Have some more wine.

655
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:40,520
- And try not to worry so much.
- You're right.

656
00:49:40,596 --> 00:49:43,622
The one thing I know about Billy
is that he's a survivor.

657
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:48,363
He's probably out on the beach
right now, partying the night away.

658
00:49:49,104 --> 00:49:51,470
Oh, sweet savior.

659
00:49:59,248 --> 00:50:02,012
What happened to that Billy dude
Casey came up here with?

660
00:50:02,084 --> 00:50:04,882
- I thought she was all up on his dick.
- She is.

661
00:50:04,954 --> 00:50:08,048
It's one of those things
any fool can see but them.

662
00:50:08,123 --> 00:50:09,954
And me.

664
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,062
OK. That is the last time
I take a shit in this can.

00:50:34,316 --> 00:50:37,114
Oh, shit. (screaming)

666
00:50:38,888 --> 00:50:41,948
I heard some dude was blowing him
in the bathroom last week

667
00:50:42,024 --> 00:50:45,619
during that fight we had
when the richies kicked our ass.

668
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:48,822
- Yeah, that was a good fight.
- Yeah!

669
00:50:49,565 --> 00:50:53,558
What are you guys so happy about?
You lost. They beat you like rugs.

670
00:50:53,636 --> 00:50:55,604
Maybe we are giant losers.

671
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:59,368
I mean, even Casey, our muffin girl,
is dating a richie.

672
00:50:59,475 --> 00:51:02,774
Oh, Billy-shmilly.

673
00:51:03,712 --> 00:51:05,703
I love Schittville.

00:51:06,849 --> 00:51:08,840
Salt.

675
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:12,010
A salted road.

676
00:51:13,289 --> 00:51:15,450
I'm on a salted road!

677
00:51:17,326 --> 00:51:20,022
Oh, sweet Jesus, I'm in the road.

678
00:51:20,095 --> 00:51:22,086
(car approaches)

679
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:26,524
Here comes the pain.

680
00:51:27,436 --> 00:51:29,427
(Billyjabbers)

681
00:51:29,939 --> 00:51:31,338
(crash)

682
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:37,111
Brandtsy. So what is this?
Like, our.. third date?

683
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:38,111
Fifth.

684
00:51:40,215 --> 00:51:43,082
What the fuck is wrong with that
nasty-looking and smelly motherfucker?

685
00:51:43,152 --> 00:51:46,280
If you're here for more acupuncture,
I'm all booked up.

686
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:49,950
Listen, everybody.
I know we got off on the wrong foot,

687
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:56,931
but.. five days duct-taped into a trashcan.
can change a man.

688
00:51:56,999 --> 00:51:58,261
Yeah. Into garbage.

689
00:51:58,334 --> 00:52:01,201
- Do you mind?
- Would you let the motherfucker finish?

690
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:03,864
- Or else he ain't gonna leave.
- Thank you. Look..

691
00:52:03,939 --> 00:52:06,806
We can't let the richies do this
to us anymore.

692
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:09,139
I admit, when I first got here,
I was a jerk.

693
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:12,647
I was trying to be someone that I'm not.
And I was wrong.

694
00:52:12,715 --> 00:52:16,913
Yeah, something most of us learned in
the fourth grade, but, please, go on.

695
00:52:16,986 --> 00:52:21,821
Well, I learned a couple of things
and I wanna share 'em with you.

696
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:26,953
First, is that a human being can
live off the lickings of a garbage can

697
00:52:27,029 --> 00:52:31,363
for five.. long.. days.

698
00:52:31,433 --> 00:52:33,560
Another thing
we learned in the fourth grade.

699
00:52:33,635 --> 00:52:36,934
How about this? We don't have
to kowtow to the richies anymore.

700
00:52:37,006 --> 00:52:39,270
Question. Kowtow?

701
00:52:39,341 --> 00:52:42,674
- Goddamn, they're stupid motherfuckers.
- Get pushed around, idiot.

702
00:52:42,745 --> 00:52:45,213
Oh! Like the richies do to us.

703
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,975
Kowtow!

704
00:52:47,049 --> 00:52:49,313
Wait a minute. We hate kowtowing.

705
00:52:49,385 --> 00:52:50,647
Yeah!

706
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:53,483
I'll cut the next bitch that kowtows me.

707
00:52:53,555 --> 00:52:57,514
The point is, we need to take back
what belongs to Schittville.

708
00:52:57,593 --> 00:53:00,118
It smells like
you done took plenty back already.

709
00:53:00,229 --> 00:53:04,689
I'm talking about the mountain.
And our honor, and our dignity.

710
00:53:04,733 --> 00:53:07,258
Honor and dignity?

711
00:53:07,336 --> 00:53:09,896
That's some pretty redundant shit
for five days' work.

712
00:53:09,972 --> 00:53:15,000
Poopy pants is right. We need to take back
our shit, including Casey our muffin girl,

713
00:53:15,077 --> 00:53:19,912
unless Brandt Von Hoffman's
kowtowing her right now.

714
00:53:19,982 --> 00:53:22,246
- Can you use it like that?
- I think you can.

715
00:53:22,317 --> 00:53:23,648
Whoa. Wait, wait.

716
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:26,347
Casey is kowtowing Brandt?

717
00:53:26,422 --> 00:53:31,052
Why don't you take me back to my place
so we can fuck like wild dogs?

718
00:53:32,194 --> 00:53:34,424
I can put both my feet behind my head.

719
00:53:34,663 --> 00:53:35,652
Check!

720
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:37,995
But I do have to go
put a stop to that right now.

721
00:53:38,067 --> 00:53:41,002
You might want to wash the crap
out of your pants first, dear.

722
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,005
She got a helluva an idea,
Mr. Honor and Dignity.

723
00:53:44,073 --> 00:53:47,839
OK. But I still have
a good hunk of speech left.

724
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,003
- We can't wait to hear it!
- OK.

725
00:53:50,946 --> 00:53:53,779
Goddamn!
Can somebody crack the window?

726
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:56,317
Not you, Danny, you blind son of a bitch.

727
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:01,486
Case? Casey?

728
00:54:03,492 --> 00:54:05,551
Oh, thank God.

729
00:54:14,837 --> 00:54:16,930
(¢Ü soft music)

730
00:54:25,614 --> 00:54:26,911
Oh, God.

731
00:54:26,982 --> 00:54:28,643
(giggles)

732
00:54:29,751 --> 00:54:31,446
Whoo!

733
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,546
- OK, I can't do this.
- What?

734
00:54:34,623 --> 00:54:37,490
I'm already wearing a rubber.
The Colonel says always wear a rubber.

735
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:40,528
Even if you're just eating with a poorie.

736
00:54:40,596 --> 00:54:44,123
Right, I'm really glad you said that
incredibly insulting thing.

737
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:46,793
That'll make this a lot easier.

738
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,961
I'm not gonna have sex with you.

739
00:54:50,038 --> 00:54:53,166
I mean, our going out
was a really big mistake.

740
00:54:54,543 --> 00:54:58,104
I like somebody else.
That's why I moved here in the first place.

741
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:01,980
What am I supposed to do with this wood?
Build a coffee table?

742
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:06,612
OK. You're not swaying me much.
I have to ask you to leave.

743
00:55:06,688 --> 00:55:09,486
Not until I get what I came for.

744
00:55:14,263 --> 00:55:16,197
(groans)

745
00:55:16,265 --> 00:55:17,493
Billy!

746
00:55:17,566 --> 00:55:19,557
I believe the lady said..

747
00:55:26,642 --> 00:55:27,904
Wow.

748
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:30,968
What page of National Geographic
did he pop off of?

749
00:55:31,046 --> 00:55:33,879
I don't know. But I have a feeling
you have a lot to do with this.

750
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:37,112
Now, if you don't leave
right now, I'm gonna..

751
00:55:37,186 --> 00:55:39,484
Ohh!

752
00:55:39,555 --> 00:55:43,150
I get it.
I might be rich, but I'm not stupid.

753
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:45,589
Actually, yeah, you are.
Bye-bye.

754
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:58,071
Here.
Give this to your boyfriend.

755
00:55:58,774 --> 00:56:01,470
He can wear it as a wet suit.

756
00:56:01,543 --> 00:56:02,407
(Casey gasps)

757
00:56:02,477 --> 00:56:08,074
- He threw a rubber on my face, didn't he?
- Yeah. Let me get it for you.

758
00:56:16,525 --> 00:56:18,516
Sorry if I ruined your date.

759
00:56:18,627 --> 00:56:22,028
You did.
But not for the reasons you think.

760
00:56:33,175 --> 00:56:34,267
(groans)

761
00:56:48,457 --> 00:56:50,448
- J.P.
- Hm?

762
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:52,516
(slurps)

763
00:56:53,362 --> 00:56:57,093
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

764
00:56:57,866 --> 00:56:59,857
But, uh..

765
00:57:00,435 --> 00:57:03,632
I don't have to "follow you to your car"?

766
00:57:03,705 --> 00:57:06,037
No! Jesus!

767
00:57:06,108 --> 00:57:10,442
I wasn't with a guy. I was with the..
Colonel's daughter.

768
00:57:10,512 --> 00:57:13,913
How did you get at the end of that line?
I'm still waitin' for the call.

769
00:57:13,982 --> 00:57:16,450
I feel.. I feel terrible.

770
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:20,784
I screwed everybody over and..
I acted like an asshole.

771
00:57:20,856 --> 00:57:23,188
Let me tell you something.

772
00:57:23,258 --> 00:57:30,255
A man who can't see that he's acting
like a asshole - there's a real asshole.

773
00:57:30,766 --> 00:57:36,602
But a man who can admit it,
that man's all right in my book.

774
00:57:39,308 --> 00:57:40,639
I wrote a book, you know.

775
00:57:41,777 --> 00:57:42,744
Give it a skim.

776
00:57:42,811 --> 00:57:46,076
- It's a big.. font.
- Thank you very much.

777
00:57:46,148 --> 00:57:50,312
I talk all about the Kennedys,
Jimmy Hoffa..

778
00:57:50,986 --> 00:57:53,147
space aliens.

779
00:57:53,221 --> 00:57:56,816
That bullshit moon landing.
We never go to no fucking moon.

780
00:57:56,892 --> 00:58:00,453
I bought the commemorative plate
for nothing.

781
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:05,397
I got a whole chapter on the president
and his pretty-ass wife

782
00:58:05,434 --> 00:58:09,598
having dinner
with Osama Bin Laden on 9/12.

783
00:58:09,671 --> 00:58:11,195
It's some heavy shit.

784
00:58:11,273 --> 00:58:13,264
Hey, back me up on this.

785
00:58:15,143 --> 00:58:17,236
I taught Jim Morrison..

786
00:58:18,647 --> 00:58:21,707
how to boogie-woogie one-ski

787
00:58:22,784 --> 00:58:26,777
in 1989.

788
00:58:26,855 --> 00:58:28,880
I'm talking heavy shit.

789
00:58:28,957 --> 00:58:31,892
He taught John Lennon how to be ironic.

790
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,155
There's some shit about Area 51.

791
00:58:34,229 --> 00:58:36,220
Keep it to yourself.

792
00:58:36,298 --> 00:58:40,667
I've been to Area 58.
It's sort of a rest area.

793
00:58:48,243 --> 00:58:51,735
And here's one,
just between the two of us.

794
00:58:52,614 --> 00:58:55,913
Kurt Cobain killed
that crazy bitch Courtney Love,

795
00:58:55,984 --> 00:58:58,384
cut off his own dick,
bought him some titties,

796
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:00,421
and he's Courtney Love.

797
00:59:00,455 --> 00:59:03,083
That's her in his grave.
Dig her up and find out.

798
00:59:03,158 --> 00:59:05,456
There's a hole in that Hole.

799
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:18,098
Well, I don't know about the two of you,
but I'm going to sleep.

800
00:59:26,381 --> 00:59:28,372
William?

801
00:59:31,586 --> 00:59:33,577
Are you all right, son?

802
00:59:34,289 --> 00:59:36,280
- J.P.?
- Mm-hm?

803
00:59:37,659 --> 00:59:40,025
Aren't you drunk?

804
00:59:40,095 --> 00:59:43,189
I've never been drunk a day in my life.

805
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:47,597
I've been waiting for you, boy.

806
00:59:47,669 --> 00:59:50,695
And no more bullshit between us now.

807
00:59:50,772 --> 00:59:53,536
I've seen what you can do
up on that mountain.

808
00:59:53,608 --> 00:59:58,170
You are the finest
natural-born snowboarder..

809
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:01,376
I have ever seen in my life.

810
01:00:02,651 --> 01:00:06,143
Now, what you got to do
is get the respect of this town,

811
01:00:06,221 --> 01:00:08,519
and you are not going to do that
by walking in

812
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:11,889
with a load of crap in your pants
and some dumb-ass speech.

813
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,861
How do I get the respect of the town?

814
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:19,565
Only two men have ever ridden
the Goat and lived.

815
01:00:19,634 --> 01:00:22,228
And I'll bet everything I wish I had..

816
01:00:22,971 --> 01:00:26,566
that you, Billy Wagstaff,
are gonna be number three.

817
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:31,802
What if I'm one of the ones who dies?

818
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,973
Well, then, at least you'll make the board.

819
01:00:44,693 --> 01:00:46,957
Yeah, baby.

820
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:55,292
Yeah, baby.

821
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:59,932
Hey, guys. That fuckshit Wagstaff,
he's not as dead as we'd hoped.

822
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:03,499
And here is the kicker.
The Goat he is going to ride now.

823
01:01:03,545 --> 01:01:05,672
- Let's go.
- Ja.

824
01:01:05,747 --> 01:01:07,578
But I thought we were gonna have sex.

825
01:01:07,649 --> 01:01:09,617
Who wants sex
when you can watch Wagstiff

826
01:01:09,684 --> 01:01:11,743
trying to kill himself
riding the Goat?

827
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:14,880
No brainer.
Let's go watch that bastard break his neck.

828
01:01:14,956 --> 01:01:18,084
Hey, you guys.
You're not gonna believe this.

829
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:22,061
I just heard Billy Wagstaff
is skiing the Goat.

830
01:01:22,197 --> 01:01:23,858
Look.

831
01:01:23,932 --> 01:01:26,264
The Goat?

832
01:01:34,576 --> 01:01:38,068
"Tog ruy ogta"?

833
01:01:40,282 --> 01:01:42,910
What the hell does that mean?

834
01:01:50,959 --> 01:01:52,950
"Tog ruy"?

835
01:01:54,963 --> 01:01:58,228
Aaagh!

836
01:02:11,279 --> 01:02:12,712
Go, go, Billy.
Go, go!

837
01:02:12,781 --> 01:02:14,772
(cheering)

838
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:19,116
(¢Ü "The Last Ride" by Evan Olson)

839
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:17,940
You'll never see the other side
of Goat's Hump.

840
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,050
Die, you sucker.

841
01:03:28,757 --> 01:03:30,816
Oh, fuck!

842

01:03:58,086 --> 01:04:00,077
(honking)

844
01:04:01,056 --> 01:04:04,389
Shit, I'm alive! Oh, shit.

845
01:04:04,459 --> 01:04:05,824
(horn)

846
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:15,098
I can't believe that bastard Wagstiff
boarded the Goat.

847
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:17,536
(Sven) Maybe one of us
should ski the Goat.

848
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:20,369
Yeah. Brandt should do it.
He's the team captain.

849
01:04:20,442 --> 01:04:22,433
No way.

850
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:25,411
- Nootnik, you do it.
- Sven, it is your idea. You do it.

851
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,880
No. No! Make Hans do it.

852
01:04:27,949 --> 01:04:31,282
- Why me? Make Schlomo do it.
- Schlomo can't do it. You must do it.

853
01:04:31,352 --> 01:04:32,910
- No, you do it.
- No, you do it.

854
01:04:32,987 --> 01:04:34,978
- You do it, Hans.
- No, you do it.

855
01:04:35,056 --> 01:04:36,853
- No, you do it.
- You do it.

856
01:04:36,925 --> 01:04:39,086
(all) You do it.

857
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,754
Doesn't anyone want to do me?

858
01:04:44,265 --> 01:04:45,391
(all) You do it.

859
01:04:45,867 --> 01:04:49,098
Here's to Billy "Who the Man" Wagstaff,

860
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:52,230
who boarded the Goat
and gave us poories a hero.

861
01:04:52,307 --> 01:04:55,208
- We love you, brah.
- (cheering)

862
01:04:57,612 --> 01:04:58,601
Billy, Billy.

863
01:04:58,713 --> 01:05:01,443
Now would be the right time
for that speech,

864
01:05:01,483 --> 01:05:04,919
which is funny,
yet motivates us to become better people.

865
01:05:04,986 --> 01:05:06,180
(all) Yeah!

866
01:05:06,254 --> 01:05:08,279
Yes, thank you, J.P.

867
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:11,915
Wow. I guess I'd just like to say

868
01:05:11,993 --> 01:05:15,724
that when I was trapped in the trash,
the one thing that kept me going

869
01:05:15,797 --> 01:05:19,233
was knowing that all of Schittville
was out there looking for me.

870
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,426
Yeah..

871
01:05:27,709 --> 01:05:29,939
Huh. Yeah.

872
01:05:30,011 --> 01:05:32,479
I did learn what I valued most in life,

873
01:05:32,547 --> 01:05:34,947
and that is friends..

874
01:05:35,016 --> 01:05:37,075
freedom..

875
01:05:37,152 --> 01:05:39,916
and, of course, food and air.

876
01:05:39,988 --> 01:05:43,446
And the right to board
where we want to board.

877
01:05:43,525 --> 01:05:45,789
(all) Yeah.

878
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:49,421
- Right on, brother.
- Damn, this is some speech.

879
01:05:49,497 --> 01:05:52,159
(Billy) So let's raise a glass, you guys.

880
01:05:52,233 --> 01:05:54,292
To a new era on Pine Mountain.

881
01:05:54,369 --> 01:05:59,068
And let's end this ridiculous distinction
between richies and poories

882
01:05:59,174 --> 01:06:04,908
and let's make this a place where every
single person is welcome and accepted.

883
01:06:04,946 --> 01:06:06,937
(all) Yeah.

884
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:10,850
And get those assholes outta here.

885
01:06:10,919 --> 01:06:16,323
They put me in a garbage can
and left me to die.

886
01:06:16,391 --> 01:06:18,416
I wanna talk to you, Wagstaff.

887
01:06:18,493 --> 01:06:21,155
Your days on the mountain
are over, old man.

888
01:06:21,229 --> 01:06:24,289
Billy boarded the Goat.
You know the rules.

889
01:06:24,365 --> 01:06:26,629
I know the law of the mountain.

890
01:06:26,701 --> 01:06:29,568
I know that any team
can challenge any other team

891
01:06:29,637 --> 01:06:33,971
to a Chinese downhill,
no-holds-barred race to the bottom

892
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:36,840
for total domination of Pine Mountain,

893
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:42,008
and I say you poories haven't got the guts.

894
01:06:52,093 --> 01:06:54,061
- Hell, yeah.
- (all) Yeah.

895
01:07:03,471 --> 01:07:05,632
All right, gentlemen.

896
01:07:05,707 --> 01:07:06,674
Listen up.

897
01:07:06,741 --> 01:07:10,074
There's absolutely no way in hell
you can lose this race

898
01:07:10,144 --> 01:07:12,874
if you board good and hard.

899
01:07:12,947 --> 01:07:17,577
Now, there's a lot at risk here,
so I'm leaving nothing to chance.

900
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,884
Step up and grab a piece of insurance.

901
01:07:22,557 --> 01:07:24,457
- Ja!
- (laughter)

902
01:07:28,096 --> 01:07:32,430
But, Colonel, why do we need
the medieval weapons or clubs of death?

903
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,161
Because we're not taking a chance.

904
01:07:34,235 --> 01:07:36,999
He just explained this,
you stupid Australian.

905
01:07:37,071 --> 01:07:39,301
But I am Hungarian.

906
01:07:39,374 --> 01:07:42,207
Well, if you're so hungry, eat me.

907
01:07:42,277 --> 01:07:43,608
(laughter)

908
01:07:45,346 --> 01:07:47,337
Ja! Ja!

909
01:07:48,316 --> 01:07:50,511
(manic laughter)

910
01:07:58,927 --> 01:08:01,919
All right, the winners rule the mountain.

911
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:06,498
The losers.. don't rule the mountain.

912
01:08:07,368 --> 01:08:10,201
You just said the same damn thing twice,
you redundant-talking,

913
01:08:10,271 --> 01:08:11,932
big truck-driving,

914
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:14,873
one-ski boogie-woogie idea-stealing,

915
01:08:14,943 --> 01:08:18,106
ho-raising,
dumb signposting motherfucker.

916
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:19,874
(all) Yeah!

917
01:08:19,948 --> 01:08:24,544
Why don't you have another beer,
you adjective-throwing,

918
01:08:24,619 --> 01:08:27,918
Will Smith-loving, lie-telling,

919
01:08:27,989 --> 01:08:32,688
big book-writing-that-ain't-nobody
ever-gonna-read idiot?

920
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,749
(all) Yeah!

921
01:08:33,828 --> 01:08:36,023
There's some heavy shit in there.
You really ought to give it a skim.

922
01:08:36,097 --> 01:08:38,258
Look, I think we all knowwhat's at stake

923
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:40,528
and that J.P. wrote a book
with some very heavy shit in it.

924
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:42,796
Now, please, can we just race?

925
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:46,169
- Who's gonna say "Go," brah?
- Who's not boarding?

926
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:51,210
Gee, I wonder who everybody's looking at.

927
01:08:57,719 --> 01:08:59,949
Come on, honey. This way.

928
01:09:04,225 --> 01:09:08,958
I know you hate me, Billy,
but, really, good luck.

929
01:09:13,901 --> 01:09:15,892
Thank you, Winter.

930
01:09:24,178 --> 01:09:26,772
(Brandt) You can watch my butt.

931
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:31,585
Come on.
Hang on to your jewels.

932
01:09:52,306 --> 01:09:56,743
Hey, J.P.!.
You're sure easy to see in the show.

933
01:09:57,245 --> 01:10:00,078
Kiss my black ass,
you crazy white devil.

934
01:10:01,382 --> 01:10:03,782
(yells)

935
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:12,259
Look who it is -
Billy's little slut girlfriend.

936
01:10:12,326 --> 01:10:14,089
I hate you.

937
01:10:17,565 --> 01:10:20,363
(screaming)

938
01:10:38,352 --> 01:10:40,217
(screams)

939
01:10:52,867 --> 01:10:54,425
You fucking bitch!

940
01:11:03,311 --> 01:11:06,007
Whoo! Whoo!

941
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:18,452
Whoo!

942
01:11:40,214 --> 01:11:41,875
(cheering)

943
01:11:47,054 --> 01:11:49,113
Damn you, Wagstaff.

944
01:12:07,375 --> 01:12:09,536
You know I love you, don't you?

945
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:10,804
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

946
01:12:14,182 --> 01:12:21,350
Naomi, what I'm asking you is..
if you'd be my seeing-eye wife.

947
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:22,616
Yes, Danny.

948
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:27,957
Because even though you can't see
my mind-boggling beauty on the outside,

949
01:12:28,029 --> 01:12:31,328
you can see my mind-boggling beauty
on the inside.

950
01:12:31,966 --> 01:12:34,764
I'm the happiest guy in the world.

951
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:38,804
Danny, honey,
you're kissing a dead beaver.

952
01:12:38,873 --> 01:12:41,637
I don't care.
I love you anyway.

953
01:12:52,486 --> 01:12:54,420
That beaver's not dead.

954
01:12:55,823 --> 01:12:58,656
That is one lucky,
no-seeing, beaver-licking,

955
01:12:58,759 --> 01:13:01,193
Naomi-hugging son of a gun.

956
01:13:01,229 --> 01:13:06,496
Hey, brahs, the Colonel, Winter
and the richies are here.

957
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:09,661
This is a private party,
you no-contest-winning motherfuckers.

958
01:13:09,737 --> 01:13:12,205
But that fine daughter of yours,
she can stay.

959
01:13:12,273 --> 01:13:15,208
But you other tight-ass bitches,
get the fuck out of here.

960
01:13:15,276 --> 01:13:18,211
Actually, we're just here to say goodbye,

961
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:21,305
because you poories have ruined
snowboarding for us.

962
01:13:21,382 --> 01:13:24,215
So we're taking
our Olympic skills elsewhere

963
01:13:24,285 --> 01:13:27,880
because I've invented a new sport.

964
01:13:27,955 --> 01:13:31,391
It's called one-board boatless water-skiing.

965
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:34,558
That's surfing, motherfucker.

966
01:13:34,629 --> 01:13:38,087
Africans invented that shit
trying to get off your goddamn slave ships

967
01:13:38,165 --> 01:13:41,134
by hanging on to pieces of driftwood
headed for the motherland.

968
01:13:41,202 --> 01:13:44,899
It's in the book, fool.
Give it a skim.

969
01:13:44,972 --> 01:13:47,941
Oh, skim that book high and hard,
Supertan.

970
01:13:48,009 --> 01:13:49,067
(laughter)

971
01:13:50,077 --> 01:13:54,446
You know, I think the important thing
is here that you're leaving.

972
01:13:54,515 --> 01:13:57,416
No, Billy.
The important thing is..

973
01:13:58,552 --> 01:14:01,612
this is leaving, OK?

974
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:04,851
Wrap it up.

975
01:14:08,162 --> 01:14:12,656
And you poorie chicks
are gonna be missing out on this.

976
01:14:14,035 --> 01:14:19,098
Oh, who are we fooling? We poories
should be fighting with the richies.

977
01:14:19,173 --> 01:14:20,765
It's what we do.

978
01:14:21,542 --> 01:14:23,009
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

979
01:14:23,077 --> 01:14:24,635
Stop, you guys.

980
01:14:24,712 --> 01:14:27,875
Why do the richies and poories
always have to be fighting each other?

981
01:14:27,948 --> 01:14:31,179
Why can't we just make Schittville
the example for the whole world?

982
01:14:31,252 --> 01:14:34,744
All right, gentlemen. Greener pastures.

983
01:14:36,357 --> 01:14:38,450
Hold on one second, guys.

984
01:14:40,494 --> 01:14:43,122
You're lucky we're leaving, Wagstiff.

985
01:14:43,197 --> 01:14:45,927
If we weren't,
I don't think it would be too long

986
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,027
before little Casey here starts begging
for a piece of what's in this package.

987
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:53,430
(yelling)

988
01:14:54,909 --> 01:14:58,345
Goddamn, some more
heavy shit for my book.

989
01:14:58,813 --> 01:15:00,804
Give it a skim.

990
01:15:04,618 --> 01:15:06,051
(man) Roll cameras. Cue marker.

991
01:15:07,688 --> 01:15:09,383
Hey, Brandt.

992
01:15:09,457 --> 01:15:10,446
(laughter)

993
01:15:10,524 --> 01:15:13,152
I'm counting on you to hold me there, boss.

994
01:15:13,227 --> 01:15:16,822
- (man) Keep rolling.
- That fucking hurt my leg.

995
01:15:16,897 --> 01:15:18,387
- (man) Still rolling?
- (man #2) Still rolling.

996
01:15:18,466 --> 01:15:20,457
(man) Great. Thank you.

997
01:15:22,903 --> 01:15:24,894
Do it two times.

998
01:15:24,972 --> 01:15:27,202
(laughter)

999
01:15:27,274 --> 01:15:28,366
Marker.

1000
01:15:30,911 --> 01:15:32,310
(Naomi laughs) Oh, God!

1001
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:34,314
That beaver's not dead.

1002
01:15:34,382 --> 01:15:36,509
(Naomi) What happened to my chair?

1003
01:15:36,584 --> 01:15:38,916
- Yes, I just hurt my ass.
- Oh, my God.

1004
01:15:47,161 --> 01:15:48,389
(laughs)

1005
01:15:49,463 --> 01:15:51,454
Your lips say no.

1006
01:16:04,912 --> 01:16:06,641
I'm Billy Wagstaff.

1007
01:16:06,714 --> 01:16:10,343
What the fuck is wrong with that
nasty-smelling and looking motherfucker?

1008
01:16:10,418 --> 01:16:12,409
(Naomi laughs) Sorry.

1009
01:16:14,955 --> 01:16:16,946
It's Billy Wagstaff.

1010
01:16:17,091 --> 01:16:22,723
What the fuck is wrong with that
nasty-looking and smelly motherfucker?

1011
01:16:23,497 --> 01:16:25,863
But I got a really good hunk of speech left.

1012
01:16:25,933 --> 01:16:27,298
(J.P.) What was that?

1013
01:16:27,368 --> 01:16:28,357
Well, good.

1014
01:16:28,436 --> 01:16:30,427
I'm happy.

1015
01:16:32,506 --> 01:16:34,667
(man) I like "Nazi fag." Good line.

1016
01:16:34,742 --> 01:16:35,766
Blow me.

1017
01:16:36,811 --> 01:16:38,472
Hot stuff.

1018
01:16:38,546 --> 01:16:40,980
I bet I could hear that if I tried,

1019
01:16:41,048 --> 01:16:45,041
and maybe a little labia-flapping
kind of action.

1020
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:47,110
I mean, you know, I felt her face.

1021
01:16:47,188 --> 01:16:51,318
She's a good-looking girl,
and, you know, come to think of it,

1022
01:16:51,392 --> 01:16:58,025
I wouldn't mind putting my mouth right..
if I could get a mouthful of that camel toe.

1023
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:02,358
All that about labias flapping
and camel-toeing and shit.

1024
01:17:02,436 --> 01:17:03,425
White people.

1025
01:17:04,138 --> 01:17:09,576
You wouldn't know anything about that,
would you.. Colonel?

1026
01:17:09,643 --> 01:17:11,941
Hey, Kate.

1027
01:17:12,012 --> 01:17:13,912
Listen, I'm not an educated man,

1028
01:17:13,981 --> 01:17:16,643
and I wouldn't know Strasberg
from Stanislavski,

1029
01:17:16,717 --> 01:17:19,550
but I thought that was a little
on the indicate-y side.

1030
01:17:20,187 --> 01:17:26,126
Hey, Kate. If overacting was sexy,
I'd be hard as a fucking rock right now.

1031
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:29,127
Hey, Kate. William Shatner just called.

1032
01:17:29,196 --> 01:17:31,289
He wants his acting style back.

1033
01:17:31,899 --> 01:17:34,094
Oh, God, forgive me.
What do you know? Wait.

1034
01:17:34,168 --> 01:17:36,466
I'm going to hell.

1035
01:17:36,537 --> 01:17:38,835
I'm going directly to hell.

1036
01:17:38,906 --> 01:17:42,603
Well, there you go, boys.
It's all true what they told you.

1037
01:17:42,676 --> 01:17:45,509
(laughter)

1038
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:47,570
(¢Ü "Fall" by Scott Miller)

1039
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:29,998
Damn, look at the bucket of junk
sticking out of those pants.

1040
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:36,479
- (applause)
- Thank you, thank you.

1041
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:38,484
Good to see you.
I love you..

1042
01:20:38,552 --> 01:20:40,383
Good to see you.
Good..

1043
01:20:40,454 --> 01:20:44,083
Doggone, doggone.
You really, really, really know

1044
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:46,217
how to make a fella feel welcome.

1045
01:20:46,293 --> 01:20:50,229
And as I scan the crowd here,
I see a few new faces.

1046
01:20:50,297 --> 01:20:52,288
And if any of you don't know me,

1047
01:20:52,366 --> 01:20:55,164
I am Jack Schitt.. the third.

1048
01:20:55,235 --> 01:20:58,170
- We love you, Jack!
- I love you too, man!

1049
01:20:58,238 --> 01:20:59,728
Somebody get a video camera.

1050
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,037
- A what?
- Oh, yeah.

1051
01:21:03,077 --> 01:21:05,841
I guess we're just gonna have
to use our rememberers.

1052
01:21:05,913 --> 01:21:07,744
Your rememberers?

1053
01:21:07,815 --> 01:21:10,841
Oh, lord. We truly are
in the town that time forgot.

1054
01:21:10,918 --> 01:21:15,014
They say his house is so opulent,
he has his own driveway.

1055
01:21:15,089 --> 01:21:17,319
I would too if I made Jack Schitt money.

1056
01:21:17,391 --> 01:21:21,953
Now, very rarely do I get
a chance to interface

1057
01:21:22,029 --> 01:21:26,022
with the youth of the community.
I thought this was a prime opportunity.

1058
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:29,592
The first nugget of wisdom
I need to share with you

1059
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:32,002
is to stay off the doggone drugs.

1060
01:21:32,072 --> 01:21:34,006
- Even pot?
- Oh, no, no, no.

1061
01:21:34,074 --> 01:21:37,737
Pot's OK. That's medicinal.
I'm talking the hard stuff.

1062
01:21:37,811 --> 01:21:39,369
- What about cocaine?
- No, no, no.

1063
01:21:39,446 --> 01:21:41,380
I got no problem with cocaine.
I mean, as a matter of fact,

1064
01:21:41,448 --> 01:21:44,417
I've been known to do a bump or two
in the morning to get me out of bed.

1065
01:21:44,485 --> 01:21:47,511
I am talkin' the hard drugs.

1066
01:21:49,823 --> 01:21:52,291
Ecstasy?

1067
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:54,725
Ecstasy..

1068
01:21:54,795 --> 01:21:58,060
is a tool.
It's not a drug.

1069
01:21:58,132 --> 01:22:00,896
As a matter of fact,
I got a belly full of it right now!

1070
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:06,636
Now, drugs is just
a minor part of the problem.

1071
01:22:06,707 --> 01:22:09,733
The big thing I want you to remember,
for the love of Mike,

1072
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:12,210
is to stay in school.

1073
01:22:12,279 --> 01:22:15,407
I'm 31. School's not really
an option for me.

1074
01:22:15,482 --> 01:22:17,712
Jack Schitt is a straight shooter.

1075
01:22:17,785 --> 01:22:19,446
And if you're over 30,

1076
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,148
and you're havin' trouble
with the readin' and writin',

1077
01:22:22,222 --> 01:22:24,156
I'm not gonna tell you that's a plus.

1078
01:22:24,224 --> 01:22:27,660
Mr. Schitt, is anything about us a plus?

1079
01:22:30,497 --> 01:22:32,965
I'll see y'all at the Schittville holiday parade.

1080
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:35,001
Thank you very much!
Thank you!

1081
01:22:35,068 --> 01:22:37,127
(cheers/applause)

1082
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,804
Love you. I love you, man.

1083
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,503
I love you! I love you.

1084
01:22:44,578 --> 01:22:49,242
Man, they sure could use
a man like that in Washington.

1085
01:22:49,316 --> 01:22:51,910
That big-talkin', corny-dressin',

1086
01:22:51,985 --> 01:22:54,886
out-of-style,
bolo-tie-wearin' motherfucker.

1087
01:22:54,955 --> 01:22:56,923
I hate that motherfucker.
