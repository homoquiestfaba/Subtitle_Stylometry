1
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,141
What?

2
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,476
Never again, no horror movies.

3
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:20,712
Come on, no, the first kill
was amazing.

4
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,781
Oh, look, he texted me
like three times since
we went in there.

5
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,750
Anything good?

6
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:28,153
No, just basically saying
"what's up?" In several
different ways.

7
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,354
Uh-huh.

8
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,522
What are you doing now?

9
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,491
I have to go home and study.

10
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:37,229
That's so lame. No, come over to
my house, we'll watch a movie.

11
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,231
We literally just watched
a movie.

12
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,667
Yeah, but studying... sucks.

13
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:43,869
I know, I know, I got to.
I'll call you later.

14
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:47,439
All right--
hey, where'd you park?

15
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,874
So, let me drive you.

16
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,542
It's 50 feet away.

17
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:51,610
All right, fine.
I love you.

18
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,145
Bye. Love you.

19
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,751
Help!

20
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:55,987
Oh, fuck!

21
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00,071
Miss hannaford, in a minute...

22
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,307
I'm gonna ask you to take a look
at the statement you gave us...

23
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,209
And uh... sign it.

24
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,114
Wait, the camera doesn't
show anything?

25
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,182
Well, the camera in the foyer
there doesn't show
the bulletin board.

26
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,051
Can't you move it?

27
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,320
I mean, how many more of these
do I have to keep on finding?

28
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:19,724
Well, then we'd be looking
at the doors, which is why
the store has the camera there.

29
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,794
Someone made that image
and sneaked it past cameras
to post it up there...

30
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,096
For anyone to see,
for a kid to see...

31
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,666
Doesn't that make you feel like,
i don't know, maybe it's not
a good thing?

32
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,935
It is a graphic depiction.

33
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,970
It's not a crime, though.

34
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,639
It's not a crime to make 'em,
not a crime to show 'em.

35
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,207
It's poor taste.

36
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,577
The girl in the photographs,
she's someone, isn't she?

37
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,713
There's no way for me to look at
this and even know if it's real.

38
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,783
Unless we can link it to some
kind of actual criminal
activity...

39
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,719
A body, or ID on a missing
person. But this--

40
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,254
no body, no crime.

41
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,056
Wait, but this one's numbered.
You saw that.

42
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,724
It's numbered seven
at the bottom.

43
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,859
Well, it's probably some kind
of a art thing...

44
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,829
Some kind of a numbered art
thing, street art.

45
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:58,897
What do they call it?

46
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,265
Uh...

47
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,834
Outsider art.
Yep.

48
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,636
Okay, has anyone else
seen these?

49
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,904
Or are they just for me?

50
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:07,205
Is that what's concerning
you here?

51
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,774
Yes, has anyone else
turned them in?

52
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,611
No. No, I don't think so.

53
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,680
So, they're art,
but just for me to see?

54
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:18,049
So I would encourage you
not to take this personally.

55
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,718
Great.

56
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,786
Do you know any photographers?

57
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,888
No, I don't.

58
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,727
Well, we got your statement, so
I'm gonna ask you to take a look
at it...

59
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:35,133
And sign it... right there.
There you go.

60
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,076
How can I be the only guy who
wants the police in spearfish,
south Dakota...

61
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,882
To call the gruesome discoveries
of the past several weeks the
work of a serial killer?

62
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:07,852
Who wants to give me a reason
why the gruesome photograph...

63
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:11,022
That was found stapled to a
telephone pole...

64
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:16,027
Behind the local library isn't
a photograph of the mutilated
remains...

65
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,396
Of 23-year-old Savannah Simms...

66
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:24,202
Who was reported missing some
ten days earlier from a not
so neighboring town?

67
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,138
The nature of the mutilation
portrayed in the photograph...

68
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,843
Made a definitive identification
impossible at this time...

69
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:38,483
And so I'm asking, "why can't
it just be Savannah Simms,
just this once?"

70
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:43,154
And the photograph that was
found pinned to the community
bulletin board...

71
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,890
At the local wellborn
supermarket...

72
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,927
Can't<i> it</i> please be of
22-year-old Janet teasley...

73
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,162
Where do you want these
new prints?

74
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:57,068
Who was reported missing 75 days
earlier from yet another not
at all neighboring town?

75
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:02,173
Can't spearfish, just this once,
have a serial killer to call
our very own?

76
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,442
I gotta see these pictures.

77
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,444
They're like literally the only
thing that's not on the
Internet.

78
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,413
Who do I know who can
make that happen?

79
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:11,216
You read conversation-style
blogs written by people from
your hometown?

80
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:14,886
I'm inspired by any nut that
takes pictures of dead people
and posts them online.

81
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,455
I'm fucking inspired!
I'm-- I'm hard!

82
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,557
I'm gonna be fully erect
here in a minute.

83
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,292
Oh, for a change.
Hey! Hey!

84
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,895
That was the mushrooms,
we talked about that.

85
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,297
Was it?

86
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,633
This guy knows
I'm from spearfish.

87
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:35,874
He's doing this photography
thing with his victims as an
homage, as a nod, a nod to me...

88
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:41,045
Spearfish's most famous citizen
and only known living artist.

89
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,914
Frankly, I'm flattered.

90
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,283
Didn't it say that there
isn't a serial killer?

91
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,419
These guys are always inspired
by something, fucking copy cat.

92
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,388
What I need is a cigarette.

93
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,090
Chew the gum.
Fuck the gum.

94
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,125
The gum tastes like
garlic semen.

95
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,628
Yeah, I just feel bad
for the girls.

96
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,998
They're getting killed
and then mutilated...

97
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,400
And then put on display.

98
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,037
It's fucking awful.

99
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,974
Here we have a model who feels
something for another model...

100
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:13,678
Because she's dead and mutilated
and displayed like a piece
of meat.

101
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,346
This is news.
Shut up, asshole.

102
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,447
Huh?

103
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,683
I said, "shut--

104
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,551
don't smile.

105
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,587
How about that?
You like that?

106
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,156
Best picture of the day, easy.
What time is it?

107
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,658
It's uh, 6:00.

108
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,059
6:00 in the evening, fuck me.

109
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:30,595
Okay, you know what we gotta do?

110
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,431
We're gonna call those-- those
perfume campaign people. What
the fuck is that called?

111
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,199
The bay campaign.
The bay campaign.

112
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,168
The bay campaign, thank you,
the bay campaign.
Stoner.

113
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,570
Call the bay campaign people
and wake them the fuck up
and tell them...

114
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:43,241
That I finally figured it out,
and I know exactly what I'm
going to do for them.

115
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,009
I'm gonna steal this nut's idea.

116
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,145
I'm gonna hire models pretending
to be dead people.

117
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,713
Actually not that much
of a stretch.

118
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,548
And you think the bay people
are gonna go for that?

119
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,317
I told them not to hire me
in the first place...

120
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,118
But they insisted,
so this is what they get.

121
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,121
They get unidentifiable
dead models.

122
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,458
We'll use those kids
from the last shoot,
trip and what's her name?

123
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,460
What's her fucking name,
this one?

124
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,095
Uh, Victoria.

125
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,432
Victoria, trip and Victoria,
dead eyes on both of them.

126
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,534
And rose here.

127
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:10,969
Oh, yeah? Fuck me, huh?

128
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,971
Yeah.
Okay, only if you're lucky.

129
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:16,140
All right now, somebody please,
please, get me a fucking
cigarette...

130
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,177
Before I kill somebody and take
their fucking picture!

131
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,656
Well, here you go. Door-to-door
service and it's not even
bright out yet.

132
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,127
That's gotta be worth something.

133
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,997
I told you last night that
i didn't need you to drive me...

134
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,000
And I told you again
an hour ago.

135
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,235
Yeah, well, maybe you don't want
your picture in the newspaper.

136
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:49,540
The story goes somewhere,
but it's about time that my face
went fucking national.

137
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,246
Hey, come on.

138
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,181
Look, I'm trying here.

139
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
And who's that?

140
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,689
Oh, nothing, it's just Jill.

141
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,557
Jill, wh--

142
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,093
anyway, I gotta go. Thanks.

143
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:13,231
Maybe I'll see--

144
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,367
yeah, well, that went great.

145
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,846
Nice job with the minivan,
by the way, that's nice.

146
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,748
Yeah, sorry, they didn't
have any escalades left.

147
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,484
So, we're gonna be dead
in the pictures, right?

148
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,054
Well, I want to have my eyes
open. Can I have my eyes open?

149
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:05,523
Like, it would look so cool
if I was all like--

150
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,825
you know?

151
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,728
Okay, does my manager know
about this? Because I think
it's disgusting.

152
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,830
I think it's brilliant.

153
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,932
It's a commentary on our
fascination with death.

154
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:19,603
How we let ourselves-- we think
about death just as much as we
think about sex.

155
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,972
Well, if that's what it is,
then it's awesome.

156
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,675
I'll tell you what it is, kids.

157
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:28,913
It's that every fucker in the
country thinks they're a
photographer now, okay?

158
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,782
And everyone can share an image,
and it's awful.

159
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:36,020
It's awful, because it makes
everything just like watery
piss.

160
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:40,925
Then you have this guy who
creates an image that you
actually can't fuck with.

161
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:46,430
That you actually can't ignore,
and when that happens, I have
to ask myself...

162
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,133
"Peter hemmings, what is wrong
with this picture?

163
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:53,571
"Are you just going to sit there
and let this guy make you look
like a dummy...

164
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:58,609
"Or are you going to steal his
idea and make a bunch of money,
and then get high?"

165
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,445
And I think we all know the
answer to that, don't we, trip?

166
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:02,847
Oh, hells yeah, man!

167
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,416
If I catch any of you
instagramming...

168
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:08,552
Or whatever the fuck it's called
on this trip, you're all fired.

169
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,388
I couldn't be more serious.

170
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,089
Yeah, he's not kidding.

171
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:15,626
Let's have a party tonight.

172
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,161
Yeah, man!

173
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:20,164
Just a little get together,
you know, invite some locals...

174
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:24,635
Barbeque some shit, some ribs,
sprinkle a little peyote
on there.

175
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:27,905
Just a little get together,
just to celebrate our arrival.

176
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,574
Cool, we'll just have to stop
in town, grab some stuff.

177
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,910
My house has definitely
got nothing.

178
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,179
Hey, how much longer?

179
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:37,448
I have no fucking idea.

180
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,484
It's been so long, I don't even
recognize these trees.

181
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:41,952
Hey... check it out.

182
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:46,023
Jesus.

183
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:51,595
10,494... I've had anal sex
with more people than that.

184
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,670
Get the fuck off me!

185
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,906
Jesus, I'm driving.

186
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:04,909
Keep fucking driving, then.

187
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,233
Yeah, it still smells
like a wet sponge.

188
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:31,035
Oh--

189
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,604
I think this was where one
of the pictures were found.

190
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:38,075
Note to Chris, call the cops
and make an appointment for me
to see those pictures.

191
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,176
An appointment?

192
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:41,078
Note to Chris #2...

193
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,747
Get me a carton of cigarettes,
a whole pallet.

194
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,216
I've gotta piss.

195
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:46,517
That's pretty.

196
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,219
I want to photograph this truck.

197
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:50,855
Look at the color,
it's blood red.

198
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:54,024
It's so spot-on that it becomes
a complete cliché...

199
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:57,495
And it's such a cliché that it
comes right back around to being
perfect for me.

200
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,864
Whoa, that's heavy, man.

201
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:02,566
Get it for me, Chris...
Pretty please?

202
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,902
Get this truck for me.
Okay, I'll leave a note.

203
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:06,904
Capital idea.

204
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:09,206
Ladies, why don't you just sort
of come over here and stand...

205
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,942
Kind of lean maybe, on the--
on the hood.

206
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:14,078
Ready?
I don't know if we should
be leaning on the truck, guys.

207
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,747
Chris, unclench, unclench.
I know it's not--

208
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,084
I love it.

209
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,151
Here.

210
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:16,674
Okay, the only thing you
really need to know about me...

211
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:19,343
Is that Tequila makes me
want to fight...

212
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:22,780
And cheap wine makes me
want to fuck.

213
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:27,685
I'm sure the lives of many brave
young men were lost...

214
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:30,955
In the refinement of that
elegant theorem.

215
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,624
I love you.
Oh.

216
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,705
Find everything you were
looking for today?

217
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:50,808
Uh, yeah, yeah, we did.
Thank you.

218
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:07,825
You remember all the numbers...
For the codes and stuff?

219
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:11,362
Oh, yeah, the scanner's been
broken long enough, so...
Kind of have to.

220
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:12,896
Oh, yeah--

221
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:15,399
makes it really hard to fall
asleep sometimes.

222
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,001
Can't really stop it.

223
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:20,070
Yeah, I actually just read
in the new yorker...

224
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,272
It's called the Tetris effect.

225
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:25,275
It's when you do something over
and over again, it kind of gets
stuck in there.

226
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,144
You can't shut it off, you know?

227
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,948
Hm, you know, I had a real
Tetris problem in the 7th grade.

228
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,283
It was really, really bad.

229
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,253
Yeah, I did-- I did, too,
actually.

230
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,289
I think everyone did,
it's kind of-- it's a good game.

231
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,091
It's... Tetris.

232
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,763
So, are you guys
from Minneapolis?

233
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:48,732
Uh, no, la, actually,
Los Angeles.

234
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,701
What happened?
Did your plane crash?

235
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:52,403
Yeah, we were gonna resort
to cannibalism...

236
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:56,073
And then we found this place,
so we didn't have to do that.

237
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:58,876
No, we're here
for a photo shoot.

238
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,944
It's actually an ad campaign.
It's--

239
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:04,281
Peter hemmings is shooting it.
I'm sure you've heard of him.

240
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,949
I haven't.

241
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,285
I'm surprised. I thought
everyone from here knew him.

242
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,087
He's also from here.

243
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:14,391
Is it that man over there
staring at me? Is that him?

244
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:17,261
Yeah.

245
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:18,462
It's very much my boss.

246
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,064
How's it going?
Good, fine.

247
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,699
Yeah?
Yeah.

248
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,741
Hello.

249
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:33,444
I was pretending
not to see you there.

250
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:37,181
We're just sort of doing
an exposé on the local scene
down here.

251
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:42,152
You know, sort of kicking
around some rocks and seeing
what scatters.

252
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:46,090
Exposé is a French word
for naked, by the way.

253
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:51,195
It's okay, I get it.

254
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:53,831
Just because you're from here
doesn't mean that you're
a local.

255
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:58,902
Tell her I want to take her
picture, Chris.

256
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:03,207
Actually, tell her that we're
having people over at this house
that we're staying at.

257
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:06,176
And tell her everyone knows it
is the cabin on the lake road.

258
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:09,947
But tell her it's actually more
like a house. You'll make it
sound cute.

259
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,081
Okay.

260
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,784
Tell her she can bring whoever.

261
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:17,421
She'll understand that you mean
her boyfriend, just so it seems
like you're cool with that.

262
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,290
Yeah, I'll tell her
all those things, yeah.

263
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:23,761
Tell her she's beautiful.
Give her a card.

264
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,300
Okay, well--

265
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:33,971
you obviously heard the man,
uh--

266
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:36,974
yeah, I did.

267
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:40,844
So anything else today?
No, that will do it, thank you.

268
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:44,915
All right, that brings
your total to $328 and 71 cents.

269
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,383
Put it on there, please.

270
00:29:50,356 --> 00:29:53,390
Are you guys seriously
gonna drink all this?

271
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,259
Hell's yeah, man.

272
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,240
There's my kitty.

273
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,114
Hello?

274
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,091
Here, kitty, kit--

275
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:47,230
that's not very nice.

276
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:54,538
I see why you're Colleen's
friend, you're very pretty.

277
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,473
And I brought you a gift.

278
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:07,718
No!

279
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,195
It's okay.

280
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,333
Got dinner!

281
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,576
It's okay... ssh.

282
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,481
Mm.

283
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:40,050
Smells delicious.

284
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:50,794
Eat up, pussy.

285
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:58,268
That's not a very good kitty...
Is it?

286
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:06,276
It's okay.

287
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:07,778
Come on, it's--

288
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,716
come on.

289
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:16,720
Look what else I got.

290
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:27,364
Now I bet you were always
the girl that never took a bad
picture, huh?

291
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,754
Yeah, I bet that was you.

292
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,295
Should we call someone?

293
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,330
Do you want your phone?
You can call someone.

294
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,101
Who do we have here?

295
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,469
Colleen.

296
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:08,538
She's probably busy at work.

297
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,343
There's Kelly, there's... mom.

298
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:17,747
I'll let you call mom.
Mom's always know what to do.

299
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:22,352
You call mom and all this
will be over, yeah?

300
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,522
All right, let's call mommy.

301
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,126
Here you go.

302
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,661
Go on, take it.

303
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:34,564
<i> Hello, you've reached</i>
<i> maryanne o'meara...</i>

304
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,867
<i> Please leave a message</i>
<i> after the beep.</i>

305
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:39,436
Mom, come get me out!

306
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,739
Mom! Mom!

307
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:08,291
<i> Jill</i> <i> hey, it's Jill, still stuck</i> <i> in hell.
You know what to do.</i>

308
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:12,829
Hey, it's me. I just wanted to
call and see where you are.

309
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,966
I don't think I missed
a call from you today...

310
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:19,869
But... blah-- anyway,
call me back.

311
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:20,463
This is like the
playboy mansion.

312
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:24,801
Well, that's what happens
when you cast in a grocery store
in fucking south Dakota.

313
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:30,573
And there were obviously
no dudes at the store.

314
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,842
All girls?

315
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:35,345
You couldn't have one sausage
for momma?

316
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:37,347
Are you gonna take pictures
of all these girls?

317
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,348
Unfortunately.

318
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,916
They're terrible.

319
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:41,985
I understand.

320
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:45,021
Why couldn't the killer have
just killed one of them?

321
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,828
I'd fucking best let Johnny
fuck that snake.

322
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,863
If it was necessary, why not?

323
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,598
What the fuck
is he talking about?
You know, bring it on.

324
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,967
Yeah, I know, dickhead,
squeeze and wad and shit.

325
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:01,738
But if you think about it,
it's like they don't even
have any fucking arms!

326
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,007
The sad part
is he's gonna get laid.

327
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,809
I hope so.

328
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:10,947
What's up?

329
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,628
Great.

330
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:05,101
Okay, come here.
Here you go.

331
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:08,705
Just stand right there, and you
come and stand right here.

332
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:10,807
You-- no, no, you.

333
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,012
Okay.

334
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:23,153
I'm just waiting, um, you know,
for that moment...

335
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:27,123
Where things go from being
completely fucking awful,
like now...

336
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,492
To coming back around
to being really good.

337
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,628
So it shouldn't be
that much longer.

338
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,805
And one, two... look at me.

339
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:45,008
Very good, get closer.

340
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,677
Jesus, are you guys
in junior high?

341
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:51,781
What am I doing here?

342
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:58,655
Get closer to each other,
come on.

343
00:40:58,657 --> 00:41:00,156
Closer, closer, closer, closer.

344
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:02,225
Get inside of each other,
go ahead.

345
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:04,160
Fucking yeah, yeah.

346
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,130
Great.

347
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:26,583
My god, okay.
Switch passing thumbs.

348
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:34,591
If it's any more local girls,
just tell them we're sold out.

349
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,629
You guys want some chips?

350
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:43,600
Hey, models don't eat... ever.

351
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,003
That was so mean, do it again.

352
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:49,706
Hi.
Hey.

353
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:52,609
Wow, you actually made it, um--

354
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:55,745
yeah, is-- did I show up
too late?

355
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:58,281
No, no, not at all,
it's awesome that you came.

356
00:41:58,283 --> 00:41:59,782
Come in.

357
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,687
I'm sorry I'm late.

358
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:08,658
I was supposed to meet
a friend here and I guess
she's still at work.

359
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,027
No, that's fine.
Here, come on, we're in here.

360
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,896
This is so much better
when you look away.

361
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:14,063
I mean it.

362
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:30,246
Petty resentments
of the local girl.

363
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:35,251
Oh, wow, it looks so appealing,
all the drinks that no one's
bothered to consume yet.

364
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,953
Yeah.

365
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:39,556
Actually... there might be
something to it.

366
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,624
What are you talking about?

367
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:45,828
Yeah, I don't know, I don't even
know what I'm really doing here.

368
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,198
Hey, pretty lady.

369
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:02,278
I'm so sorry, should I perhaps
ask for permission...

370
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,247
To take your photograph?

371
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:08,585
Permission is such a shit word,
there's nothing sexy about it.

372
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:10,887
You know, in my line of work,
we don't ask for permission.

373
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:13,089
Nobody talks to each other
about permission.

374
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,059
What we talk about is release,
that's what we give each other.

375
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:18,328
Colleen... Peter.

376
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,196
Yeah, I remember.

377
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:21,898
Whoa! Okay, all right.

378
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,634
Didn't that feel so much better?
Okay, there you go.

379
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:26,936
It's the release, isn't it?

380
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,005
It just feels like you can get
all of that tightness...

381
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:31,040
That's inside of you
and just let it go.

382
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:33,142
Whoa.
Oh, whoa?

383
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:35,244
Yeah, whoa, I don't really
like my photo being taken.

384
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:38,047
Wh-- wh-- I don't like my photo
being taken? Why not?

385
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:41,718
What if I wanted to capture a
photograph of you?

386
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,386
You're being incredibly selfish,
don't you think?

387
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:46,055
I think you should just
give her a second.

388
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:48,791
I'm so sorry, you're right.
I should at least wait until you
have a drink inside of you...

389
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:49,993
Shouldn't I?
Yes.

390
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:52,028
Okay, please stop.

391
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,796
And if you touch the head
like that, you're just gonna
make it come.

392
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,898
Come on, baby, just release!

393
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,867
Just back the fuck up!
Oh!

394
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:00,336
What the fuck, bitch?
No, no, no, no.

395
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,972
Easy for a second... you okay?

396
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:08,878
Colleen, wait up!

397
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:18,254
Hey, Colleen!

398
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,991
Are you okay?

399
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,827
Yeah, it takes a whole lot more
than that to make me not okay.

400
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,330
Yeah, um, Peter, he's--
he's kind of a--

401
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,032
yeah, I know he is.
Yeah.

402
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:31,868
Well, if you come back in,
I'll-- I could talk to him.

403
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,303
Yeah, I have work tomorrow and i
don't know where my friend is...

404
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:35,838
Who was supposed to meet me
here, so--

405
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,274
okay, well, I'm sorry.

406
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:41,144
You're sorry? For what?

407
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:46,749
Um, I'm sorry--
I'm sorry for Peter.

408
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:49,919
It's kind of my job
to be sorry for him.

409
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:52,822
Well, he's Peter hemmings
or whoever...

410
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:57,460
So I'm sure he doesn't travel
anywhere without his trusty
team of apologists.

411
00:44:57,462 --> 00:45:00,096
Right.
Yeah, I know, not your fault.

412
00:45:00,098 --> 00:45:04,033
Yeah, um, you get service
out here?

413
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,835
No, I don't.

414
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:07,837
Yeah, shit, me neither,
fucking at&t.

415
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,406
Hey, uh, I hate to tell
you this..

416
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:15,278
But what you did in there
is just gonna-- it's just gonna
make him like you more.

417
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,947
Yeah, but it was
totally worth it.

418
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:20,183
Yeah.

419
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:09,332
Are you cold?
Mm... yeah, a little.

420
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:14,904
Hey, uh, excuse me, can we get
one of those cot blanket things?

421
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:19,275
Having seen some movies,
I'm pretty sure the guy
didn't leave any fingerprints...

422
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:23,146
Unless he wanted you to find
them, in which case it becomes
this whole labyrinth-themed...

423
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:25,948
Thing and I'm really not sure
you're ready for that, officer.

424
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,117
Well, we have to do everybody...

425
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,920
Just in case, just so we can
tell theirs from yours.

426
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:34,824
Oh, yeah, I get it. I mean, you
know, you might want to just
check her prints...

427
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:37,493
Since she's the one
who touches her own car.

428
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:39,295
Oh, we already have hers
in the file.

429
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:42,064
You know, from when she found
the other photos?

430
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:47,470
She found the other pictures
that the guy left.

431
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:51,140
Of course!
Hey, it's cool, man.

432
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:54,010
I'm not gonna throw you
under the bus, deputy.

433
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:56,445
I understand that you're
upset. I can see that.

434
00:46:56,447 --> 00:47:00,216
But from where I'm looking
at things, nothing happened.

435
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:02,018
And you're okay.

436
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,086
Somebody followed me here...

437
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:06,856
So he could put that picture
in a place where I would be
the one to find it.

438
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:09,192
And we are gonna look into that.

439
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:12,829
I know this is scary,
and we're doing the best
we can to figure this out.

440
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:16,999
And until that happens, I'll
have Daniels escort you home
and follow you in his cruiser.

441
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,368
Don't even bother.

442
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,273
Colleen, hey!

443
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:25,875
Are you sure you're gonna
be all right?

444
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:28,311
Haven't you heard?
I'll be fine.

445
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,464
Oh, shit.

446
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:49,358
You know, I called you
a bunch of times.

447
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,394
You guys have fun, you and Jill?

448
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:53,629
I'm tired, okay?

449
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:55,932
You're all tired out,
because it's special shit
all of a sudden?

450
00:48:55,934 --> 00:49:00,069
Pretty townie chick,
out and about.

451
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:01,938
I don't want to do this tonight.

452
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:06,642
Yeah, what, 'cause you already
did some of that la fag?

453
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:07,710
What?

454
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:09,712
What?

455
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:11,147
What are you gonna
make him your star?

456
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:13,549
Wait, did you talk
to Jill tonight?

457
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:17,186
Jill? No, why the fuck would
i want to talk to Jill, what,
so she can lie to me, too?

458
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:19,422
How did you know where I was?

459
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:22,591
How do I know that you
fucking lied to me?
And went solo to a party?

460
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,160
What the fuck is wrong with you?

461
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:26,362
Did you follow me?
What are you talking about?

462
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:28,698
Did you put those pictures in
places where I could find them?

463
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,101
Pictures? Is that what
you're going on about again,
those fucking pictures?

464
00:49:32,103 --> 00:49:35,137
Yes! The one at the store,
and the library, and tonight!
Did you?

465
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,205
Don't be fucking stupid.

466
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,207
How did you know where I was?

467
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:41,310
Colleen?
Just say it was you, so i
can do something about it!

468
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,013
Beth randle fucking texted me
when you got there, all right?

469
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:46,349
What is wrong with you?
Just--

470
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:52,088
you know, you think everything's
about you, don't you?

471
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,156
But it's not.

472
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:58,661
See, I see you, Colleen.

473
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:02,131
No, you don't.
Now I need you to leave.

474
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:36,098
What the fuck?

475
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:48,677
Finally.

476
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,267
Ben?

477
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:57,646
You forgot your wallet, asshole.

478
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:19,562
Ah, smells like you're smoking.

479
00:53:19,564 --> 00:53:22,665
We've moved past that, Chris.

480
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:26,235
We've fucking moved on
to bigger things.

481
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:30,906
This girl has found all
of the photographs so far.

482
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:34,944
As far as I can tell, any time
this guy wants somebody to find
the photos, she does.

483
00:53:34,946 --> 00:53:37,613
Coincidence? I don't think so.

484
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:39,315
Yeah, well that seems
pretty obvious, yeah?

485
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:42,284
So why her?
I mean, if I'm the cops...

486
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:43,786
That's what I'm doing, right?

487
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:45,654
Yeah, I don't think that
they're doing anything.

488
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:48,390
It's that whole Dr. Lecter
thing, and what do we covet?

489
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,593
We covet what we see every day.

490
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:53,662
Yeah, well, she's the check-out
girl. Everyone sees her
every day.

491
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:56,865
But somebody sees her
differently than everybody else.

492
00:53:56,867 --> 00:54:00,636
To somebody... she's a star.

493
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:03,839
If I'm the police,
that's what I'm doing.

494
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:06,008
But fuck the police!
I'm not the police!

495
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:08,244
I'm a fucking artist!

496
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:12,281
And it's a very fine line
that separates me from our
sick-fuck friend.

497
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:14,817
He probably has a PC.

498
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:23,959
Maybe I'm the one
who's becoming obsolete.

499
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:29,732
Maybe I'm the PC
in this relationship.

500
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:34,536
Maybe this guy... is a Mac.

501
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,906
I don't want any other girls,
i want this girl.

502
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:39,475
I don't want anyone else.

503
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:42,711
For what?
For the big campaign, just her.

504
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:44,713
Well, what about the whole
"dead models" thing?

505
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,649
It's been done. We take Colleen
out of this shithole...

506
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:49,051
And shoot her at the studio
in la, that's it.

507
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:52,921
Why the fuck are we here?
Use rose or Vic, why does it
absolutely have to be Colleen?

508
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:55,557
So that he can't have her.

509
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:01,530
Nobody makes me feel obsolete.
Nobody makes me feel like
a fucking Dell computer...

510
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:02,965
And gets away with it.

511
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:08,937
I want this girl.

512
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:12,808
And by the way, you do, too.

513
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,010
So get in line.

514
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:19,381
<i>It's just something</i>
<i>I have to do.</i>

515
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:24,887
I can't stay in this town,
it's a lot of stuff.

516
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:27,523
Well, you certainly were
a bright spot.

517
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:29,792
Not here long enough for us
to get to know you, Colleen...

518
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:32,961
But a bright spot all the same,
everybody sure likes you a lot.

519
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:36,332
You know where you're goin'?

520
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:38,901
Not like I haven't figured
it out before.

521
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:42,504
All right, your total
will be $14.93.

522
00:55:57,455 --> 00:55:59,621
How's it going, Colleen?

523
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:02,658
Oh, good, you know, slow.

524
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,626
It's tom.

525
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:07,796
Yeah, I know, sorry, I can't
seem to really wake up today.

526
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:10,032
Long night?

527
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:13,035
No, not really.

528
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:16,004
Oh, thank you, let me help you
there with that.

529
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:19,775
Thank you. Have a nice day!

530
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:22,644
Got any big plans
for the weekend?

531
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:25,481
Uh, probably, I'll just sleep.

532
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:27,149
That's not much fun.

533
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:29,585
Yeah, you're right about that.

534
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:34,089
Prettiest girl in town--
just goin' through a day
until it's all over?

535
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:36,859
It seems like a terrible waste,
if you want to ask me.

536
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:41,897
Hey, it's none of my business.

537
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,433
You know, I'm not really
supposed to say this...

538
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:46,869
But you can buy a whole case
of these things at big lots.

539
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:49,671
Costs about half as much.

540
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:55,511
You know, the truth is I'm not
sure my cat's gonna live much
longer, so I'd hate to waste it.

541
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:59,081
Oh, I'm really sorry
to hear that.

542
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:03,552
Anything else today?

543
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:05,087
No, that's it for me.

544
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:08,056
All right, your total
will be $1.09.

545
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:13,195
Cool... and let me
give you a penny.

546
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:18,000
There you go.
I'll be seeing you next time,
Colleen.

547
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:22,704
Hey.
Hey.

548
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:25,541
Ah, you think that we
could talk for a second?

549
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:47,963
You know, she sometimes does
her hair up like that?

550
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:51,166
It drives me fucking crazy.

551
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:02,744
Do you really think
this is a good idea?

552
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:06,014
No, we can leave her
here to die--

553
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:10,219
hey, so, Chris here thinks
that I should apologize...

554
00:58:10,221 --> 00:58:12,588
For taking your picture...

555
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:15,824
Or something, I don't--
i was only pretending
to pay attention.

556
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,526
Why?

557
00:58:17,528 --> 00:58:19,661
Because even when
I'm a complete shit...

558
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:22,231
I am still a much better option.

559
00:58:22,233 --> 00:58:24,933
You stay here and god
only knows how many times...

560
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:29,004
That guy tries to show you
his nasty, nasty pictures.

561
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,573
That's the best case scenario.

562
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:33,175
The worst case scenario...

563
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:38,013
Is that you end up<i> in</i> one
of those nasty, nasty pictures.

564
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:41,083
Or you come out to la with me...

565
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:44,753
And make dirty pictures
for me for a little
walking-around money.

566
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:48,156
You don't have to sleep with me.
You can if you want to, but it's
not a requirement.

567
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:50,025
I don't give a shit. You can
stay in my guest house.

568
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,793
I've never even seen
inside the place.

569
00:58:51,795 --> 00:58:53,629
It's actually-- it's pretty
nice in there.

570
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:54,897
Well, yeah, shit!

571
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:57,099
Look, I'm just trying to help
you, okay?

572
00:58:57,101 --> 00:59:00,836
It's not like the guy is going
to follow you back to la,
all right?

573
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:03,972
That would be like a shark
eating a bunch of people...

574
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:07,676
And then getting on a plane,
and getting off at the other end
of the country...

575
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:09,978
And then eating more people.

576
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,915
I mean, serial killers don't
board airplanes, they don't
go on trips.

577
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:14,149
Serial killers don't
have wallets.

578
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:16,552
No one's saying that there's--

579
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:18,053
that there's what, a serial
killer? What should I call
this person?

580
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,223
A man with a plan?
A very dedicated individual?

581
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:22,591
Why me?

582
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:25,294
Does it matter?
Yes, it does!

583
00:59:25,296 --> 00:59:28,764
Will somebody please explain
to me why it's such a goddamn
chore to be chosen?

584
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:32,067
You think this is some sort
of joke, don't you?

585
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,803
It's not so great to be noticed,
you know?

586
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:37,072
It's one thing to be picked out
by some fancy photographer...

587
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,241
But what if it's just some
random stranger...

588
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:41,009
Some guy on the street?

589
00:59:41,011 --> 00:59:43,679
That sort of thing
doesn't end very well.

590
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:49,017
I heard...
But you know, this--

591
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:51,753
this doesn't end very well,
either.

592
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,856
You still haven't answered
my question.

593
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,595
I chose you...

594
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:03,198
Because I haven't had
a fresh idea...

595
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,734
In a long, long time.

596
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:09,805
Because I feel old... and tired.

597
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:15,010
And you are neither.

598
01:00:15,012 --> 01:00:21,016
Honestly, I've never heard him
say anything like that, ever.

599
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,620
Fine.

600
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:29,658
When?
When? Tonight, now.

601
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,194
Tonight we have a slumber party.

602
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:35,097
A safety-in-numbers
slumber party.

603
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:40,168
And tomorrow, we get on the
first flight we can back to la.

604
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:46,708
I mean, you weren't really
planning on living here,
were you?

605
01:00:50,714 --> 01:00:53,181
Someone has to come with me
to my place, so I can get
some stuff.

606
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:55,784
Chris volunteers his services.

607
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:57,319
Yeah.

608
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:00,222
Watch out for Chris here.

609
01:01:00,224 --> 01:01:03,091
Scientology turned him straight.

610
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:10,899
So I'm just-- I'm curious...

611
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:13,235
What made you say "yes"
back there?

612
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:17,139
'Cause I'm pretty sure
i can handle myself.

613
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:24,880
Okay, good, he's not here.
Who?

614
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:27,916
Um, my boyfriend.

615
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:30,786
Oh... cool, yeah.

616
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:35,290
My ex-boyfriend.

617
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:39,094
Okay, cool.

618
01:01:39,096 --> 01:01:43,098
Hey, can you do me a big favor?
If you see a black truck,
just make sure you honk twice.

619
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,968
A black truck? Am I on like
the lookout here, or I mean,
is it--

620
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,705
really? Yeah.
Is he big?

621
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:52,774
Yeah, he's pretty big, but don't
worry, he's a fucking pussy.

622
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:56,111
Anyway, I'll just be
two seconds.
All right, I'll just--

623
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:57,713
don't worry.

624
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:01,717
I'll just hang out here.

625
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:06,788
A black truck... shit.

626
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:26,434
How's Colleen?

627
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:29,204
You know, you could have
treated her like a star.

628
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:32,174
Fuck you!

629
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:38,547
The thing is, I can't really
understand what you're saying.

630
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:41,149
Your mouth just sounds
like a dirty cunt.

631
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:44,586
Should we ask Gerry what he
thinks about you?

632
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:46,988
Pussy!

633
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:03,071
Do you like what you see,
faggot?

634
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:04,472
I'll fucking kill you.

635
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:11,913
No... I don't think you will.

636
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:22,157
In an hour, your body is gonna
be in two separate trash bags.

637
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,563
You should have treated
her better.

638
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:32,434
Fuck you.

639
01:04:58,028 --> 01:05:00,161
What?

640
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:04,399
I don't know, you,
you're angrily packing...

641
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,969
Like the girl in a movie
who is angrily packing...

642
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:09,671
Because she's leaving the guy.

643
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:13,575
But in reality, we all
leaving at the same time...

644
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:18,947
And we're all going to the same
place, and I think that's
incredibly funny.

645
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,954
What's wrong?

646
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:27,555
You know exactly what's wrong.

647
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,624
Okay, remind me.

648
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:34,062
You like that white trash bitch
better than you like me...

649
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:38,166
And it is fucking dumb.

650
01:05:38,168 --> 01:05:40,068
Colleen?
Yeah.

651
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,970
I haven't even tried her, yet.

652
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:43,972
Jesus fucking Christ, Peter!

653
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:47,709
Can't you be serious with me
for one goddamn second?

654
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:50,278
One!

655
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,579
Hey, come here.
No.

656
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:53,415
Come here, eh!
No, fuck you.

657
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:56,284
Come on, come here!
I'm sorry, okay? Come here.

658
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,553
Come sit with me.
Come here.

659
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,422
Come on.

660
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:01,723
Where are you gonna go?
You're not gonna go anywhere.

661
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:05,193
Come here. There you go!
Come on.

662
01:06:07,597 --> 01:06:10,165
Don't fucking patronize me.

663
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:11,967
You know what that word means,
sweetie?

664
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:14,703
Fuckin--
come here.

665
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,439
There you go.

666
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:19,674
I hate you sometimes.

667
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:24,112
I hate you so much
some times, too.

668
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:26,581
I'm sorry, okay,
I'm sorry, you're right.

669
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:29,250
I do like her more than you.

670
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:31,252
Motherfucker!

671
01:06:34,257 --> 01:06:35,590
Ow!
Huh?

672
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:37,325
I sat on something hard,
hang on.

673
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:38,593
Do you need me to get up?
No, no, no, stay right there.

674
01:06:38,595 --> 01:06:40,628
Okay.
Ow, what is this?

675
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:43,999
Oh, look...

676
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:48,536
It's a very, very,
cheap bottle of wine.

677
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:52,540
And how the fuck
did that get there?

678
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:58,646
A little birdie told me that
when you drink cheap wine...

679
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:02,550
It makes you want to fuck.

680
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,619
See?
Mm.

681
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:08,490
When you talk, I listen.

682
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:18,066
Aren't you so fucking sweet.

683
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:07,215
Whoa! This place is really nice.

684
01:08:07,217 --> 01:08:09,651
Yeah, yeah, I found it online.

685
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:14,155
It's just a rental, but yeah,
it's definitely really nice.

686
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:21,529
You know, I'm just gonna--
I'm gonna sleep on the couch
downstairs.

687
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:23,798
It's-- it's okay,
it's just for tonight.

688
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,167
No, it's-- it's fine.

689
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:29,637
Uh, yeah, yeah, totally, um--

690
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:32,507
let me just get this crap
out of the way.

691
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:34,142
All right.

692
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:37,378
Hey.
Hello.

693
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,480
Yeah.

694
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,587
Yeah... almost.
Are you okay?

695
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:47,222
There, could you just
roll some more?

696
01:08:47,224 --> 01:08:49,324
Where? This-- this way?
Yeah.

697
01:08:49,326 --> 01:08:51,693
Mm-hm.
All right?

698
01:08:51,695 --> 01:08:55,296
Good now.
Okay, then good, yeah?

699
01:08:56,766 --> 01:09:01,269
Yeah, oh yeah, baby,
just like that!

700
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:03,505
Jesus, I look pissed.

701
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:06,174
Well, weren't you pissed?

702
01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:09,210
Yes... I guess the camera
never lies.

703
01:09:09,212 --> 01:09:11,279
Yeah, actually it always lies.

704
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:14,282
Once you take a photo
of something, it's no longer
the truth...

705
01:09:14,284 --> 01:09:15,783
It's just kind of like
a version of the truth...

706
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:18,186
Which is basically
like saying it's a lie.

707
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:23,458
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

708
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,193
Did it work?
No.

709
01:09:25,195 --> 01:09:26,361
Okay.

710
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:27,929
So, you like what you see?

711
01:09:27,931 --> 01:09:29,264
Oh, you look amazing.

712
01:09:29,266 --> 01:09:32,567
Mm, oh... I know.

713
01:09:33,737 --> 01:09:37,372
So don't ask me to--
mm.

714
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:40,675
I shouldn't even be showing you
these. Peter never lets anyone
see an unedited batch...

715
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,677
Especially not the model.

716
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,246
Is that what I am now?

717
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:48,383
Uh, well, if you're gonna
get paid to have Peter hemmings
take your photo...

718
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:50,518
Then yeah, people are gonna
start to call you that.

719
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,353
It could be worse.

720
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:55,590
Okay, I guess I just don't like
the idea of living off of my--

721
01:09:55,592 --> 01:09:57,425
your looks?
Yeah.

722
01:09:57,427 --> 01:10:02,497
I guess that any girl who thinks
it's enough to be pretty is--

723
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:05,200
yeah, I don't know
what you would call that.

724
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:07,936
I'm pretty sure it's called
a model.

725
01:10:07,938 --> 01:10:09,237
I think.
Yeah.

726
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:10,672
Yeah.
A model, Jesus--

727
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:14,409
well, what else do you want
to do?

728
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:18,213
Nothing, never mind.

729
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:21,382
That's a whole different
conversation for some
other time.

730
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,887
So, am I gonna get to talk
to you another time?

731
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:28,756
I got time.

732
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:33,528
Whoa! Who's-- who's Kelly?

733
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:36,864
Uh, Kelly's a--
she's just a friend.

734
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:41,903
She must be a really good
friend, she has her own
album thing.

735
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:44,772
Uh, yeah, she does, doesn't she?

736
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:49,510
Um, last time I checked,
she changed her relationship
status, so--

737
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:53,281
okay, I get it,
that makes it official.

738
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:55,383
I'm single now.

739
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:59,954
Oh, yeah! Fuck me!
Fuck me like a puppy!

740
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:03,424
Oh! Mm! Yes, yes!

741
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:07,929
Deeper, harder, harder!

742
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:10,431
They uh--
uh--

743
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:13,334
yeah, I'm gonna shut the door.
I don't think we should
listen to that.

744
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:15,870
It's fine, we're both adults,
right?

745
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:21,809
Yeah, yeah, totally, um--

746
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:23,444
I'm still gonna shut it, though.

747
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:41,329
That's the spirit!
Fuckin' dumb-dumbs.

748
01:11:46,036 --> 01:11:49,671
Did she just say,
"fuck me like a walrus?"

749
01:11:49,673 --> 01:11:52,707
I knew that girl had
body issues.

750
01:11:52,709 --> 01:11:54,742
You want some?

751
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:57,912
No, it's the fucking local shit,
it's horrible.

752
01:11:57,914 --> 01:11:59,681
Whatever.

753
01:12:02,752 --> 01:12:04,786
Let's go drown in the hot tub.

754
01:12:06,356 --> 01:12:08,022
Right now?
Yeah.

755
01:12:11,061 --> 01:12:14,762
No! Do not bring
your fucking camera!

756
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:26,574
Hey, hey? What are you doing?

757
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:29,744
Uh--
no, come on, it's hot tub time.

758
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:31,412
All right. Yeah.
Okay?

759
01:12:31,414 --> 01:12:33,081
It's the hot tub time.

760
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:47,762
You sound like a duck
who got run over.

761
01:12:47,764 --> 01:12:51,999
Actually you sound like a
grandfather clock jerking off.

762
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:55,002
Oh, well, you look like a
grandfather when you jerk off.

763
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:22,163
Fucking perfect.

764
01:13:28,772 --> 01:13:30,638
Yeah.

765
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,174
Wait, don't you need
to use a flash?

766
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:36,544
Hey, I'm the professional,
all right?

767
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:38,913
Okay... right.

768
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,716
The fucking flash here.

769
01:13:41,718 --> 01:13:45,420
Did it go off?

770
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:50,958
Turn around
a little bit. Oh, yeah.

771
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:07,708
Yeah, stay like that.
Come on, show me your pussy.

772
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:10,044
Okay, can you stop?

773
01:14:12,182 --> 01:14:13,848
One more.

774
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:30,932
What are you doing?

775
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:43,611
Peter!

776
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:47,882
Where are you?

777
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:55,857
Are you coming in?

778
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:01,062
Hey! There you are.

779
01:15:03,132 --> 01:15:04,765
Hey.

780
01:15:05,902 --> 01:15:07,902
Where'd you-- hey!

781
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:10,938
Jesus, man!

782
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,674
Peter! Knock it off!
Hey!

783
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:18,579
You're hurting my eyes, Peter.
Jesus!

784
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:23,818
I just wanted to spend one
night, one night like
a regular couple.

785
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:27,722
Peter!

786
01:15:31,294 --> 01:15:32,660
Peter?

787
01:16:05,662 --> 01:16:08,663
Don't even tell me
you have service, because
I'll lose my shit.

788
01:16:08,665 --> 01:16:11,098
No, I have nothing,
but I have to make a call.

789
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:14,769
Okay, there's a landline in the
kitchen, if it doesn't work.

790
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:17,138
Thanks.

791
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,973
Yeah.

792
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:41,829
<i> Hey, it's Jill, still stuck</i>
<i> in hell, you know what to do.</i>

793
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:44,632
Hey, it's me!

794
01:16:44,634 --> 01:16:47,668
Again, I don't know where you
are, or if you're okay...

795
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:52,974
Or maybe just in one of your
funks, but I wanted to--

796
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:57,178
I don't know how to say this,
but, um, I wanted to talk...

797
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:00,247
Because well, it's too long
to leave on a message...

798
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:07,121
But I was thinking of taking
off... leaving town.

799
01:17:09,192 --> 01:17:15,329
Anyway, uh, text me, call me...

800
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:18,132
Um, and don't be weird.

801
01:17:19,836 --> 01:17:22,236
Okay, bye.

802
01:17:27,377 --> 01:17:30,778
Yeah, baby!
All night long, huh?

803
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:32,947
One minute at a time.

804
01:17:32,949 --> 01:17:35,783
You need any more? I got more.

805
01:17:35,785 --> 01:17:37,818
Just give me five minutes.

806
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:38,953
That's doubtful.

807
01:17:38,955 --> 01:17:43,157
Okay? Just five minutes.
Yeah.

808
01:17:58,107 --> 01:18:00,074
You asshole.

809
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:10,384
<i> So, you like what you see?</i>

810
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:13,287
<i> You look amazing.</i>

811
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:15,056
<i> Oh, I know.</i>

812
01:18:15,058 --> 01:18:16,957
<i> So don't ask me that?</i>

813
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:32,840
<i> Yeah, yeah.</i>

814
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:09,376
<i> Hate me! Oh, fuck!</i>

815
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:15,082
<i> Come on, come on!</i>
<i> Oh, yeah! Yes!</i>

816
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:58,092
One is-- no, no, you can't
fucking play that.

817
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:02,863
Hey.

818
01:20:02,865 --> 01:20:06,300
Yeah, I don't-- I don't know.
It's-- I don't--

819
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:10,571
okay, so I know this might sound
lame, but I think I might
go to bed.

820
01:20:10,573 --> 01:20:12,173
Is that lame?

821
01:20:12,175 --> 01:20:13,908
No, no, it's not lame at all.

822
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:15,476
I mean, you can stay up
or whatever.

823
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:18,913
Yeah, is it cool, will the
computer screen keep you up?

824
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:21,382
No, not at all, it's cool.

825
01:20:21,384 --> 01:20:24,418
I can go downst-- I don't mind,
i can finish up and--

826
01:20:25,521 --> 01:20:27,488
yeah, I'm gonna go downstairs.

827
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:31,192
Oh, okay, you don't have to,
i can just turn over
to the other side.

828
01:20:31,194 --> 01:20:33,127
It's fine, I'll just um--
are you sure?

829
01:20:33,129 --> 01:20:36,564
Yeah, yeah, so you can just
chill and get some sleep.

830
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:40,568
And it's totally fine, um--
sleep well.

831
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:43,504
Thanks for showing me
those pictures.

832
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:47,074
Yeah, of course,
they're great pictures.

833
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:48,909
All right, you sure
you're gonna be cool?

834
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:51,078
Yeah.

835
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:54,415
All right, let me know
if you need anything,
I'll be down there.

836
01:20:56,052 --> 01:20:58,586
Goodnight.
All right, goodnight.

837
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,373
Hey, Peter!

838
01:21:20,576 --> 01:21:23,077
Peter!

839
01:22:18,968 --> 01:22:20,434
Rose!

840
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:27,441
Rose! Hey!

841
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:34,548
Rose!

842
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:36,317
What the fuck?

843
01:22:52,168 --> 01:22:53,467
Agh!

844
01:23:01,544 --> 01:23:04,044
Peter!

845
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,430
Colleen!

846
01:24:08,344 --> 01:24:11,045
Peter!

847
01:24:17,286 --> 01:24:18,719
Trip?

848
01:24:27,496 --> 01:24:29,463
Guys!

849
01:24:30,533 --> 01:24:32,766
This isn't funny!

850
01:24:32,768 --> 01:24:35,169
Not yet, Colleen.

851
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,353
- Fuck.
- Victoria?

852
01:25:40,903 --> 01:25:43,704
You weren't really thinking
about leaving, were you?

853
01:25:48,277 --> 01:25:50,544
Nobody ever leaves.

854
01:26:32,955 --> 01:26:37,591
This is your big moment.

855
01:29:36,438 --> 01:29:38,004
Oh.

856
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:45,412
It's okay.
Colleen, it's okay.

857
01:29:45,414 --> 01:29:49,116
Colleen, Colleen, it's okay.
Colleen?

858
01:29:49,118 --> 01:29:51,985
It's me... it's tom.

859
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,901
Colleen?

860
01:30:09,872 --> 01:30:11,805
Colleen?

861
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:14,975
Colleen, can you look at me?

862
01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:27,654
Wow, you look real good,
Colleen.

863
01:30:30,993 --> 01:30:35,095
We want to try one,
but with your-- your hair up.

864
01:30:45,974 --> 01:30:49,910
No! Don't kill me, please!

865
01:30:49,912 --> 01:30:53,480
No! Agh! No!
