00:01:36,374 --> 00:01:39,705
- You don't remember me, do you?
- Fuck you! Fuck...

3
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:17,139
Jose, she's here.

4
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,706
Did she find it?

5
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,856
Don't wave.

6
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:22,589
All right.

7
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:52,521
<i>Mom, hurry up.</i>

8
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,454
Mom!

9
00:05:57,787 --> 00:06:00,618
- Riley!
- She's back.

10
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,020
- Riley!
- Just keep going.

11
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:05,185
I know
you can hear me.

12
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:07,854
Honestly, I don't know
what you were thinking.

13
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,918
Sorry, Peg.
I said I was sorry.

14
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,751
This parking lot is
where we set up.

15
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:17,184
Everybody knows that,
from here to the Pottery Barn.

16
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:19,385
We have earned this spot
because we sell

17
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:22,018
more Firefly Christmas
baked cookies than anyone.

18
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,586
Maybe if you actually showed up to a Den
Mother meeting, you'd know these...

19
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:27,418
Well, not all of us can sit around
in our perfect little houses

20
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,918
south of the Boulevard,
Peg.

21
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Some of us have to work.

22
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,418
I will be lodging
a formal grievance

23
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,854
- at the next Den Mother meeting.
- Okay, you do that.

24
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:43,785
I don't think you're
Firefly Troop material.

25
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:44,787
Neither one of you.

26
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:46,753
Come on, Penelope.

27
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,854
What an asshole.

28
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:58,852
- Don't say that.
- Well, she is.

29
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,920
Well, maybe so.
But still...

30
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:03,853
You should've punched
her lights out.

31
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,750
Punched
her lights out, huh?

32
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:11,851
You can't go around punching
people who are jerks.

33
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:14,418
Then you're just as
bad as they are.

34
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,054
Mom, I know you took
the morning off work.

35
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:20,253
Thanks, for trying
to help me.

36
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:24,286
Do you know
how amazing you are?

37
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:29,951
Happy birthday,
get in the car.

38
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:31,353
Run, run, run.
Go, go, go.

39
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,919
Listen, I wouldn't ask...

40
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:37,353
When do you think?

41
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,252
Next month.

42
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:42,686
Right. Yeah, thanks.

43
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,283
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, squirt.

44
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,584
- Oh, how are you?
- Hey.

45
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:08,951
- I'm good.
- Good.

46
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:11,050
- I should be home by 4:30.
- Okay.

47
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:12,884
Someone's gonna have a birthday party.

48
00:08:12,886 --> 00:08:14,716
The other kids
will be there by 4:00.

49
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:16,352
Can you handle 30
minutes on your own?

50
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:18,250
How many other kids?

51
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:20,117
All my friends, Daddy.

52
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:23,951
Chris North, everything in your life
has prepared you for this moment.

53
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:25,584
Oh, hey, I'm late. Love you.

54
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:26,749
Love you, bye.

55
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:28,683
- Love you.
- Bye, guys. Bye!

56
00:08:28,685 --> 00:08:30,385
Come here,
birthday girl. Oh!

57
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,383
Oh, hi, Mr. Watson.
I'm late. Sorry.

58
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:37,749
Well, we'll talk about it later. I
gotta do some Christmas shopping.

59
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,083
- Okay.
- And I need you to close today.

60
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:41,850
- Oh, today is actually...
- Dee Dee called in sick.

61
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:43,383
So you're closing.

62
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:45,082
- It's my daughter's birthday...
- You asked for extra hours.

63
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:47,519
I'm giving them to you.
You're closing.

64
00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:55,916
Are you sure, Mickey?
Are you really sure?

65
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:58,017
- 'Cause, don't put me in a situation...
- I got kids too, man.

66
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:04,584
Ten minutes, our lives change.
Our kids' lives change.

67
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,383
Nobody knows, nobody will know,
all you gotta do is drive.

68
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:08,883
I'll take care
of everything else.

69
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:10,519
I don't know, Mickey.
I don't know.

70
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:15,716
You wanna get Riley a house, right?
Good school for Carly.

71
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:18,118
This greasy hand shit, it's
not gonna get you there, man.

72
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:19,751
This will.

73
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:33,751
Hi!

74
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,082
I'm here.

75
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:37,751
Happy birth...

76
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:41,918
Where's everybody?

77
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,084
Nobody came.

78
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:47,885
Nobody came?

79
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:58,583
<i>Riley, Peg.</i>

80
00:09:58,585 --> 00:10:00,349
<i>Let's forget
that little snafu</i>

81
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:02,449
<i>in the parking lot
ever happened.</i>

82
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,882
<i>We're having a little
holiday get-together today,</i>

83
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:06,748
<i>Penelope invited
the whole class.</i>

84
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,048
<i>I think Carly's invite must
have gotten lost in the mail.</i>

85
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,081
<i>Feel free to stop by. If you're
not doing anything else.</i>

86
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:17,282
<i>I'm sure you remember the address.
South of the Boulevard.</i>

87
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,516
<i>Hope to see you guys.</i>

88
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,349
Told you.

89
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:23,382
You should've punched
her lights out.

90
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,518
You know what,
buddy?

91
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:40,083
We don't need them
anyway.

92
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,583
It's your birthday.

93
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:44,048
My birthday sucks!

94
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,549
Carly, language.

95
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:46,684
It does.

96
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,517
We're gonna go out
for pizza.

97
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:56,115
Um, we are, just the three of us.
It'll be fun.

98
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:58,748
And then we're gonna go... we're
gonna go to the Christmas carnival.

99
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,948
- Yeah!
- Oh! Yes, the Christmas carnival.

100
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,714
And when we get there,
we are gonna ride every ride,

101
00:11:04,716 --> 00:11:06,381
and play every game.

102
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:09,582
We'll do all the virus and germ infested... Whatever.

103
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:11,747
But I'm good with that, it's your birthday.

104
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:13,614
- And then...
- Ice cream?

105
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:15,348
- Ice cream.
- Ice cream. Yes!

106
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,948
Heck, yes. Ice cream, yes,
as much as you want.

107
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,714
All right, we're gonna have
a big night. Go get a jacket.

108
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:22,683
- Let's go, go, go.
- Yeah! I'll be ready in a second.

109
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,281
I'm sorry, I just...

110
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:31,450
Hey, honey...

111
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:34,283
it's not always
gonna be like this.

112
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:35,882
You promise?

113
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,283
Yeah. I promise.

114
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:40,915
Come here.

115
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,114
<i>This is Mickey. I'm not here
right now, please leave a message.</i>

116
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:53,550
Mickey, hey, it's Chris.

117
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,082
I'm out.

118
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,716
I'm not risking it.

119
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:01,582
It's not worth it, man.

120
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:04,382
All right, listen, I'm sorry. Uh,
give me a call when you get this.

121
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:08,380
- Where's your dad?
- He's out here.

122
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:09,382
Oh, good.

123
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:12,947
Carnival! Yay!

124
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:13,949
All right.

125
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:15,683
Here we go.

126
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:19,683
Carnival.
I'm so excited.

127
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,080
<i>♪ Jingle all the way</i>

128
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:26,114
<i>♪ Oh what fun
it is to ride... ♪</i>

129
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:28,349
It's me. Is the boss around?

130
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,015
I found the other one.

131
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,615
Seriously,
you trying to rip me off?

132
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,216
Did you really think you were
gonna get away with it, Mickey?

133
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:43,746
Hey, boss, it's for you.

134
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:44,748
It's Cortez.

135
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:50,948
I have to take
this phone call.

136
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:53,249
I hope you don't mind,
Mickey.

137
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:57,247
Talk to me.
What you got?

138
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:59,583
<i>I'm tailing the other guy.
What do you want me to do?</i>

139
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:01,182
Smoke him.

140
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,682
Make an example.

141
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:05,848
A loud one.

142
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:12,014
Mickey,

143
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:15,248
is this what you wanted?

144
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:17,745
Huh?

145
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:19,583
Is this gonna make
all your problems go away?

146
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:24,948
Feels good, huh?

147
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:29,248
Have some folding cash
on you.

148
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:31,549
Right?

149
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:33,747
Right?

150
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:35,881
Fucking <i>puto.</i>

151
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:45,246
Yay! I'm the king!

152
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:51,914
Give me that one.

153
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:56,914
High five!

154
00:13:58,614 --> 00:14:01,446
I kept my eyes open
almost the whole... Oh!

155
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,246
Oh, I hope
I look smart.

156
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:05,381
- Aw. Not so much.
- Look at me.

157
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:08,446
You're a booger.

158
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,913
- Pretty charming.
- Oh, ice cream!

159
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:12,014
Let's get ice cream.

160
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:26,011
- Come on.
- We're coming, we're coming.

161
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:27,112
Hey,
what'll it be?

162
00:14:27,114 --> 00:14:29,945
Uh, two of your finest
Rocky Roads, and...

163
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:31,744
Yes, and whatever
the little lady...

164
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,245
Peppermint.
Double scoop.

165
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,612
And a peppermint
double scoop.

166
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:35,878
- All right.
- It's her birthday.

167
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,448
- Happy birthday to you.
- Thank you.

168
00:14:59,713 --> 00:15:02,112
- ...with the...
- Yeah, I agree.

169
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:04,078
Goodness,
look at that.

170
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,114
Can I try that?

171
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:07,514
Do you like it?

172
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:11,280
- Birthday, kiddo.
- Bye, sweetie pie.

173
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:19,579
- I'll grab a napkin.
- Okay.

174
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:20,679
Okay.

175
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:24,178
- Do you mind?
- Yeah, you got it.

176
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,514
- Thank you. Have a good night.
- Bye-bye.

177
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:33,777
- I know. Every day!
- We're gonna have your birthday every day.

178
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,280
Hey, make sure we can
get it in the car.

179
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:23,778
Ready?

180
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,045
Three, two...

181
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:31,742
Adult female, 35 years old.
Gunshot wound to the head.

182
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:33,945
Severe cerebral hemorrhaging,
vitals holding.

183
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:35,744
Closing up.

184
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:38,545
We're good.

185
00:17:42,212 --> 00:17:43,212
Can I take a look?

186
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:03,176
It's messed up,
I get it.

187
00:18:03,178 --> 00:18:05,043
But you need to get
your game face on.

188
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:06,578
We got a job here,
all right?

189
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:12,045
Shit ain't easy
when it's a kid.

190
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:14,677
It's not
supposed to be easy.

191
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,677
That's the difference
between us and them.

192
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:39,775
You were
supposed to call me the moment she woke up.

193
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:41,942
You don't wake up
from a medically-induced coma

194
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:43,343
like flipping on
a light switch.

195
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:44,908
The gunshot may have
missed her brain,

196
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,741
- but the cerebral swelling...
- But she's gonna be all right?

197
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:53,375
"All right,"
is out of my hands.

198
00:18:53,377 --> 00:18:55,741
When her memory returned
she...

199
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,610
We had to restrain her
and she had to be sedated.

200
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:00,910
Mrs. North.

201
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:05,042
- My name is Detective Stan Carmichael...
- Detective.

202
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,677
I've been waiting
to speak to you for a long time.

203
00:19:11,177 --> 00:19:13,575
I'm very sorry for your loss.

204
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:17,575
Forgive me for jumping in so abruptly,
but we have three suspects in custody,

205
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:19,508
who we otherwise will have
to release tomorrow.

206
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,275
Detective, this is
really not the time.

207
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:23,777
I... I can talk.

208
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:32,010
We think that what happened
may be linked to your husband.

209
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:35,008
There were rumors
he was involved

210
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,841
in a plan to rob
a drug dealer

211
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,541
named Diego Garcia.

212
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:40,242
He wouldn't have to...
He wouldn't do that.

213
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:42,342
No, yes,
you're absolutely right.

214
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:44,441
We recovered a voicemail
on his friend's telephone,

215
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:46,577
your husband did refuse
to go along with it, but,

216
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:48,907
word had already gotten out.

217
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:51,077
And got back to Garcia.

218
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:55,907
Now, an informant has given
us a very credible lead,

219
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:58,441
but no witnesses
are willing to step up.

220
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:00,843
We know everything,
but can't prove anything.

221
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:06,341
Detective.

222
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:07,543
I think that's enough now.

223
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,676
You get some rest,
Mrs. North, I'll come back.

224
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:15,443
But I, uh...

225
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:18,876
thought you might
wanna have this.

226
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:50,843
I saw them.

227
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,574
<i>All right, bring 'em out.</i>

228
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:55,708
Let's go.
Get in there.

229
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:12,775
Um...

230
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:15,042
It's number five.

231
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,875
Number five,
step forward.

232
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:23,576
Take 'em out.
Next group.

233
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:35,241
Number three.

234
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,008
Number three,
step forward.

235
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,708
That's him.

236
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:50,741
Four.

237
00:21:55,508 --> 00:21:56,508
Hmm.

238
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:00,408
Are you sure?

239
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:08,741
Yes, I'm sure.

240
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,541
Hey, thanks.

241
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:27,374
What's the matter,
you not hungry?

242
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:32,208
Tell me what that is.

243
00:22:34,075 --> 00:22:36,905
That would be
a detective badge.

244
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:40,674
That would be all they found on the
last cop who went after Diego Garcia.

245
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:45,573
It was in his locker,
hanging in his locker here,

246
00:22:45,575 --> 00:22:48,208
inside
Metro Homicide Headquarters.

247
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:51,241
Garcia has people
on the inside?

248
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:58,238
Garcia has a nickname,
<i>La Guillotine.</i>

249
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,041
There's a reason
for that shit, Stan.

250
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,406
Chris North didn't even
rob Garcia.

251
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:09,506
He just considered it, and he's on the
wrong side of the grass with his kid.

252
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:12,573
Whatever happens with
this case, let it happen.

253
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:14,039
Don't be stupid.

254
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,240
You'll only get dead
and it won't change anything.

255
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
Hello?

256
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:13,838
- Oh, Mrs. North.
- Who are you?

257
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,371
I hope you don't mind
I let myself in.

258
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:19,340
Um, I'm...
I'm a friend.

259
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,906
Uh, do you
wanna have a seat?

260
00:24:22,507 --> 00:24:23,606
What do you want?

261
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:27,904
Eviction notice.

262
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:32,038
I can only imagine how
awful all of this has been for you.

263
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,737
I mean, how does one even begin to
recover from something like that?

264
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,204
Why are you here?

265
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:40,206
I just, uh... I just wanna
give you a bit of advice.

266
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:48,170
The road to recovery
has to begin somewhere.

267
00:24:48,172 --> 00:24:54,439
The recognition that um...
as gut-wrenching as it is,

268
00:24:56,106 --> 00:25:00,840
in the end, nothing's gonna
bring your family back.

269
00:25:03,072 --> 00:25:07,239
I know, and that's the regrettable,
yet unavoidable truth.

270
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:13,670
Eventually, maybe
not right away,

271
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:16,439
but eventually it'll be
time for you to move on.

272
00:25:17,605 --> 00:25:21,339
New place, new clothes,
new memories.

273
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:29,872
A new life.

274
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,171
What is this?

275
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:49,336
Lorazepam. Lithium. Risperidone?
That's an antipsychotic.

276
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:50,338
Hey!

277
00:25:53,905 --> 00:25:55,504
I think it's time
for you to leave.

278
00:25:55,506 --> 00:25:57,436
Maybe you've made
a mistake.

279
00:25:57,438 --> 00:25:59,736
Your memory is
a little hazy.

280
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:01,336
I'm just
putting it out there.

281
00:26:01,338 --> 00:26:03,436
Maybe you didn't see things

282
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,705
the way you thought
you saw them.

283
00:26:05,071 --> 00:26:06,071
Hmm?

284
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:09,939
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!

285
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:11,939
Get out!

286
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:16,238
You think that
you're gonna have justice?

287
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:19,238
Make them all pay?

288
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:22,770
They won't.

289
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:23,905
Get the fuck out!

290
00:26:36,838 --> 00:26:41,002
Is there anything else you would
like to ask the witness, Mr. Henderson?

291
00:26:41,004 --> 00:26:42,836
One last question,
Your Honor.

292
00:26:42,838 --> 00:26:45,336
Mrs. North,
just to clarify one point.

293
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,871
Did you see them
get out of the car?

294
00:26:47,871 --> 00:26:49,037
- No.
- Hmm.

295
00:26:50,271 --> 00:26:51,871
Did the car ever stop moving?

296
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:54,935
No.

297
00:26:54,937 --> 00:26:58,104
And yet you identified my clients
as the alleged shooters?

298
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:01,570
- They did it.
- Objection, Your Honor.

299
00:27:01,572 --> 00:27:02,735
Calls for legal conclusion.

300
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:04,735
Sustained.

301
00:27:04,737 --> 00:27:06,901
- Mrs. North, we're interested in facts. Not opinions.
- He just asked me a question

302
00:27:06,903 --> 00:27:08,102
- and I just answered.
- It's okay.

303
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:11,001
You identified
my clients, correct?

304
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:13,235
- Yes, I did. They did it...
- Okay. Okay.

305
00:27:13,237 --> 00:27:18,104
And are you currently on any
antipsychotic medications?

306
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,935
What?

307
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:23,435
- Lorazepam. Lithium. Risperidone?
- Wait.

308
00:27:23,437 --> 00:27:25,202
- Is there anything else we should know about?
- But that's not...

309
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:27,669
- Wait, that's not accurate.
- You identified not one, but three men

310
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:30,402
in a moving vehicle
at night from 30 feet.

311
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:31,901
- After a month in a coma...
- I saw them.

312
00:27:31,903 --> 00:27:33,702
- and a mental breakdown...
- It's not something you forget.

313
00:27:33,704 --> 00:27:35,836
And under the influence of antidepressant
and antipsychotic medications.

314
00:27:35,838 --> 00:27:37,535
Excuse me,
he's not listening to me!

315
00:27:37,537 --> 00:27:40,370
Is it possible that your recollection
isn't what you thought it was?

316
00:27:42,437 --> 00:27:43,504
No.

317
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,335
No further questions,
Your Honor.

318
00:27:49,337 --> 00:27:51,502
Wait, but you're not hearing me.
Can you help me out?

319
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:54,001
You're the district attorney.
Can't you do anything?

320
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:55,734
I didn't even
take those pills...

321
00:27:55,736 --> 00:27:58,435
It is the opinion of this court
that in this preliminary hearing,

322
00:27:58,437 --> 00:28:00,268
the evidence is insufficient

323
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,701
for a juror
to reasonably conclude

324
00:28:02,703 --> 00:28:05,900
that the State has met
its burden of proof.

325
00:28:05,902 --> 00:28:09,237
I see no reason to hold
the defendants over for trial.

326
00:28:20,337 --> 00:28:23,034
Wait a minute.
This can't be over.

327
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:25,834
- These men killed my family.
- Mrs. North, you're excused.

328
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:27,402
No, they killed my family!

329
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:29,402
- This guy showed up in my house.
- You are excused, Mrs. North.

330
00:28:29,404 --> 00:28:31,101
No, I am not finished!

331
00:28:31,103 --> 00:28:33,234
- You are excused, Mrs... Mrs. North.
- He offered me money!

332
00:28:33,236 --> 00:28:35,734
- No, no, no! I am not done!
- Mrs. North, you're excused!

333
00:28:35,736 --> 00:28:38,036
- They are killers! They're fucking killers!
- Mrs. North. Bailiffs!

334
00:28:40,336 --> 00:28:43,167
Get away from me!
I'm gonna kill them.

335
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,536
Bailiffs,
remove this woman.

336
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:03,169
Mrs. North, I'm remanding you to a
mental health treatment program.

337
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:05,234
Next case.

338
00:29:15,602 --> 00:29:17,934
Why is she bleeding?
What happened?

339
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:20,069
She wouldn't stop banging
her head into the bars.

340
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:25,866
- She's all yours now.
- All right.

341
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:28,700
Mrs. North? Riley,
it's Detective Stan Carmichael.

342
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:29,766
Do you hear me?

343
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,600
Hey, guys,
come on, come on.

344
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:33,600
She saw her family get murdered and
the guys who did it just walked.

345
00:29:33,602 --> 00:29:34,868
How about you lighten up?

346
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:39,236
Clear?
One, two, three.

347
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:45,901
- Where is she going?
- County General, psych hold.

348
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:48,401
That place is a nightmare.

349
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:51,401
County General, psych hold.

350
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:53,035
That place is a nightmare.

351
00:29:54,935 --> 00:29:56,835
Hang on. Let me make a call.

352
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:03,102
Hey!

353
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:07,035
- You all right?
- Yeah.

354
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:10,068
Sorry.

355
00:30:40,368 --> 00:30:41,402
Well, you called it.

356
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:47,433
She'll turn up.

357
00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:49,235
One way or another,
they always do.

358
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:15,700
Carmichael, 3-8-7-7,
Gang Homicide.

359
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:32,365
Don't you look especially
pretty this morning.

360
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:34,032
Thanks for showing up.

361
00:31:34,034 --> 00:31:36,000
I've always been a firm
believer in beauty sleep.

362
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:39,201
Pro tip.

363
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:43,201
Wait until you're dead
before you embalm yourself.

364
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:49,201
Well,

365
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:51,666
that's new.

366
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:26,332
<i>♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells
jingle all the way ♪</i>

367
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:29,699
<i>♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh ♪</i>

368
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:33,766
<i>♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way... ♪</i>

369
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,231
- Good morning, Lisa. You got a minute?
- What?

370
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:40,198
Somebody drove a truck
into a gun store

371
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,399
out in San Bernardino
a couple of nights ago.

372
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:44,365
The place was
a class-three dealer

373
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,864
and military-grade stuff.

374
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:48,730
ATF called us after reviewing
the security footage.

375
00:32:48,732 --> 00:32:51,931
Uh, it was a woman. They got a
partial frame of the suspect's face.

376
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:54,198
Give it to
the DHS Fusion Center.

377
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,532
Let them run it through
their facial recognition system.

378
00:32:56,534 --> 00:32:58,997
I did. Got a possible match
from customs

379
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:01,231
on a stowaway incident,
container ship,

380
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:03,831
at the Port of LA
three months ago.

381
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,233
Uh, your name popped up
on the case file, so I...

382
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:12,866
Inman.

383
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:18,031
Inman.

384
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,899
Are you maybe thinking
what I'm thinking?

385
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:38,765
Carmichael.

386
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:41,932
Who?

387
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:44,532
Yeah, sure.

388
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,663
The FBI wants to talk to us.

389
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:48,698
Feds?

390
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:15,563
Did you guys
run out of terrorists?

391
00:35:15,565 --> 00:35:18,162
How come the feds care about
a squirrelly soccer mom?

392
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:19,929
Didn't she smack you in
the head five years ago?

393
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:22,330
Smacking dumbasses
ain't a federal offense.

394
00:35:22,332 --> 00:35:23,397
Ha-ha.

395
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:25,429
Bank robbery is.

396
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:27,029
The night Riley North
got away from you,

397
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:29,995
she stole $55,000 from the
bank where she was employed.

398
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:33,362
Are we talking about the same Riley North?
Bank robbery?

399
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,929
Mm-hmm. She just disappeared,
completely off the grid,

400
00:35:36,931 --> 00:35:39,096
as if she just ceased to be.

401
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:41,162
You're shitting me.
She wasn't the type.

402
00:35:41,164 --> 00:35:42,728
I agree.

403
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,762
A woman with no priors, even if
her family is brutally murdered

404
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:48,098
doesn't just up and take
50 large and then take off.

405
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,064
Got my attention.

406
00:35:55,397 --> 00:35:58,596
How many times did you
betray your oath, Your Honor?

407
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:04,528
I think that you're so goddamn
corrupt, I don't even stand out.

408
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,596
Well...

409
00:36:09,497 --> 00:36:12,329
So, here's the deal.

410
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:15,497
If you can tell me my name,
I'll let you live.

411
00:36:17,198 --> 00:36:19,262
I mean, you'll eat out of a
tube the rest of your life,

412
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:21,594
but you'll live.

413
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,596
You ready?

414
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:29,198
Do you remember my name?

415
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:36,994
Interpol tagged her
four months later.

416
00:36:36,996 --> 00:36:39,894
Used her real name in a
hospital in Hong Kong.

417
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:42,328
Showed up with
a dislocated shoulder,

418
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,528
facial fracture,
ruptured spleen.

419
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,361
- Car wreck?
- Don't know.

420
00:36:46,363 --> 00:36:48,261
She left before we could
have her apprehended.

421
00:36:48,263 --> 00:36:49,694
She vanished.

422
00:36:49,696 --> 00:36:51,761
Every now and then, a lead
trickles in from somewhere.

423
00:36:51,763 --> 00:36:54,428
Some we can almost
substantiate, some we can't.

424
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,528
She's a shit magnet. Why
are you wasting our time?

425
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,729
Then we found this
on YouTube.

426
00:37:07,163 --> 00:37:10,327
Wait, that's...
that's Riley North?

427
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,195
Herself,
in Europe last year,

428
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,861
under one of the four identities
we've tracked so far.

429
00:37:14,863 --> 00:37:17,028
She got really, really good
at staying off the radar.

430
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,061
So she spends the last five years
bouncing around the world,

431
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:23,761
learning how to
get into trouble. And?

432
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:25,494
We don't exactly know
what she was doing.

433
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:27,195
What we do know,
is that she arrived in L.A.

434
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:28,396
three months ago.

435
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:34,061
Security cameras got this during a
gun shop burglary a few days ago.

436
00:37:34,063 --> 00:37:36,095
She only took military grade.

437
00:37:36,097 --> 00:37:40,228
Automatic rifles, high-capacity
shotguns, specific ammunition.

438
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,496
She knew exactly
what she was looking for.

439
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:45,028
She's back.

440
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,927
And today, you found the three guys
that allegedly killed her family.

441
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:50,063
Strung up, execution style.

442
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:54,095
Do you know what
the date is today?

443
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:55,760
- Come again?
- The date.

444
00:37:55,762 --> 00:37:56,927
What's today's date?

445
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:58,329
It's December 21st.

446
00:37:59,728 --> 00:38:01,695
Five-year anniversary
of her family's murder.

447
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:11,693
This stuff wrapped around you
is det cord, explosive rope.

448
00:38:11,695 --> 00:38:13,259
You can cut through anything
with this.

449
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:16,261
Cut through trees,
cut through concrete...

450
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,228
Corrupt judges.

451
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:35,895
Watching someone
take everything from you.

452
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:39,662
All you have,

453
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,495
all you're ever gonna have,

454
00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:45,495
just gone.

455
00:38:47,162 --> 00:38:48,196
Hurts, doesn't it?

456
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,860
And knowing that it's all over,

457
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:56,328
and there is nothing
you can do about it.

458
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:04,892
You didn't serve justice,
Your Honor. I will.

459
00:39:49,861 --> 00:39:52,061
Carmichael. Hm-hmm.

460
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:54,427
What?

461
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:56,861
Okay.

462
00:39:58,061 --> 00:39:59,061
Thanks.

463
00:40:00,227 --> 00:40:02,258
Steven Goldman
and Robert Henderson,

464
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,892
the DA and attorney
at that hearing,

465
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:06,093
- five years ago?
- Yeah.

466
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:08,093
Goldman was found face down
in his swimming pool

467
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:10,192
and Henderson's house
burned down with him in it,

468
00:40:10,194 --> 00:40:11,593
last night, both of them.

469
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,093
And that's not all.

470
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:15,859
LAPD bomb squad
is currently onsite

471
00:40:15,861 --> 00:40:17,758
at the residence
of one James Stevens,

472
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,525
criminal court judge,
recently retired.

473
00:40:20,527 --> 00:40:23,358
Some sort of explosion
at his house.

474
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,593
There's barely enough left of
him to fill an evidence bag.

475
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,158
Don't think I need
to tell you who he was.

476
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,327
We gotta go wide with this.
APB, the media, the whole deal.

477
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:50,693
That looks good. Stack it up.

478
00:41:04,726 --> 00:41:05,991
We need
to talk to you.

479
00:41:05,993 --> 00:41:07,427
- We have a problem.
- What?

480
00:41:11,726 --> 00:41:12,760
Just a minute.

481
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:16,159
Our informant called.

482
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,025
She got a judge
and, uh...

483
00:41:19,027 --> 00:41:20,691
And a lawyer
we paid off.

484
00:41:20,693 --> 00:41:22,491
Smoked some of
our homies, too.

485
00:41:22,493 --> 00:41:24,093
The ones we sent
to take out her husband.

486
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:26,357
When the fuck was this?

487
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,091
Like, five years ago.

488
00:41:28,093 --> 00:41:29,093
Is there
a problem?

489
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:31,426
No, just uh...

490
00:41:33,393 --> 00:41:35,257
Go and get Jessica
out of the car,

491
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,893
bring her in
with a couple of drinks.

492
00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:39,326
And that thing?

493
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,424
Put a paycheck
on her head,

494
00:41:44,426 --> 00:41:45,493
call it a day.

495
00:41:52,892 --> 00:41:54,690
Some personnel stuff.

496
00:41:54,692 --> 00:41:55,859
You know how it goes.

497
00:41:56,826 --> 00:41:57,890
Got ten more tons...

498
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:59,757
Your bullshit
ain't why I'm here.

499
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:02,059
You know, you shouldn't
play games with the cartel.

500
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,259
I came to deliver a message
from my father.

501
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,090
It's just a misunderstanding.

502
00:42:18,092 --> 00:42:19,659
One shipment goes missing,

503
00:42:20,725 --> 00:42:22,058
maybe it's a mistake.

504
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:23,926
But two?

505
00:42:25,058 --> 00:42:26,824
In a week?

506
00:42:26,826 --> 00:42:28,690
You think I tried
to steal from you?

507
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:30,560
That I lasted this long
by being stupid?

508
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:35,524
Everybody wants to be
a big dog.

509
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:37,690
Little dogs
trying to eat my food.

510
00:42:37,692 --> 00:42:38,725
That's all it is.

511
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:42,826
Hey, baby.

512
00:43:00,158 --> 00:43:01,258
Get the fuck outta here.

513
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:08,492
There's something
you need to remember.

514
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:17,323
You are still
a little dog.

515
00:43:17,325 --> 00:43:19,658
Don't let our business
be interfered with again.

516
00:43:57,724 --> 00:43:58,724
Who's that for?

517
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:01,724
It's for you.

518
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,057
Thanks.

519
00:44:07,324 --> 00:44:08,324
Is he okay?

520
00:44:09,257 --> 00:44:11,389
He drinks.

521
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,888
I have to take care
of him sometimes.

522
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,924
<i>Stop requested.

523
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:24,590
Dad. Come on.

524
00:44:26,558 --> 00:44:27,558
Bye.

525
00:44:28,657 --> 00:44:30,690
I told you
not to speak to strangers.

526
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:33,688
Hey.

527
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,157
Where'd you get
that shitty toy?

528
00:44:37,224 --> 00:44:38,856
Sit. Sit.

529
00:44:48,224 --> 00:44:49,422
Give me your wallet.

530
00:44:49,424 --> 00:44:50,424
Oh, okay.

531
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:52,522
Okay.

532
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:54,056
I'm gonna need you
to stand still, please.

533
00:44:58,757 --> 00:45:01,088
All right.
What do we have here?

534
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,156
Bryan Hartley,
1214 Harlow Street.

535
00:45:04,491 --> 00:45:05,690
Open your mouth, Bryan.

536
00:45:08,856 --> 00:45:11,021
This is one of those
life-altering moments.

537
00:45:11,023 --> 00:45:12,655
Do I have your attention?

538
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:16,221
I want you to take your boy
Christmas shopping.

539
00:45:16,223 --> 00:45:19,388
I want you to give him
the time of his life.

540
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,323
I want you to grow up and
be the father he deserves.

541
00:45:22,223 --> 00:45:23,421
Do you understand me?

542
00:45:23,423 --> 00:45:25,054
I understand.

543
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,688
- Say it again.
- I understand.

544
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,388
- Do you swear?
- I swear.

545
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,021
1214 Harlow.

546
00:45:30,023 --> 00:45:31,590
I will never forget you,
Bryan.

547
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:33,256
Are we clear?

548
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,188
- Yeah?
- Yes, ma'am.

549
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,223
What are you still
doing here?

550
00:45:41,723 --> 00:45:44,054
Come on.

551
00:45:44,056 --> 00:45:47,021
You ever sell him anything else and I
will blow you and this place to bits.

552
00:45:47,023 --> 00:45:48,421
- Do you understand?
- Mm-hmm.

553
00:45:48,423 --> 00:45:49,887
- Do you have a car?
- Yeah.

554
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:50,889
Give me the keys.

555
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:53,756
Consider it a rental.

556
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:57,053
Hey.

557
00:46:57,055 --> 00:46:58,554
You're in the wrong place.

558
00:46:58,556 --> 00:47:00,020
Oh, actually I'm not.

559
00:47:00,022 --> 00:47:01,155
Get the fuck out of here.

560
00:47:34,189 --> 00:47:36,320
- What's up, man?
- What's going on?

561
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:38,255
Listen, I'm about to get
this money, homes.

562
00:47:59,854 --> 00:48:02,319
<i>...in this normally
quiet upscale neighborhood.</i>

563
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:04,019
<i>Maureen, can you tell us more?</i>

564
00:48:04,021 --> 00:48:06,152
<i>What do we know about
the suspected bomber?</i>

565
00:48:06,154 --> 00:48:09,186
<i>North is suspected to
have been behind today's bombing</i>

566
00:48:09,188 --> 00:48:12,152
<i>and of possibly killing
up to five others.</i>

567
00:48:12,154 --> 00:48:15,718
<i>Authorities believe her to be
armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

568
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,521
<i>If you see her, please contact the
police at the number on the screen.</i>

569
00:48:39,354 --> 00:48:41,585
<i>...so called
"sweet killer."</i>

570
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:44,219
<i>What could be expected
for her next move?</i>

571
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,686
<i>What will the law enforcement
agencies respond with?</i>

572
00:48:54,321 --> 00:48:55,321
What the fuck?

573
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,352
Come on. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

574
00:49:01,354 --> 00:49:02,354
Come on!

575
00:49:09,986 --> 00:49:11,519
Oh, shit.

576
00:50:59,086 --> 00:51:00,386
- Hi.
- Oh, God.

577
00:51:01,252 --> 00:51:03,084
I have questions for you.

578
00:51:03,086 --> 00:51:04,186
You're not busy, are you?

579
00:51:04,518 --> 00:51:06,551
No.

580
00:51:06,553 --> 00:51:09,483
<i>A fire has partially
destroyed this downtown pinata store,</i>

581
00:51:09,485 --> 00:51:12,550
Crazy.
Crazy, crazy.

582
00:51:12,552 --> 00:51:15,550
She's fucking crazy, man.

583
00:51:15,552 --> 00:51:17,750
You already said that,
Marvin.

584
00:51:17,752 --> 00:51:19,417
Yeah, well,
I'm saying it again.

585
00:51:19,419 --> 00:51:21,483
So, you decided
to tell her everything.

586
00:51:21,485 --> 00:51:23,817
The whole damn operation.

587
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:27,550
Yeah, but you guys would have
done the same thing. It's...

588
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:30,086
I'm so impressed by how
fucking stupid you are.

589
00:51:30,985 --> 00:51:32,582
How much
did she take?

590
00:51:32,584 --> 00:51:35,584
She... Well, she
didn't take anything. She...

591
00:51:36,851 --> 00:51:38,851
She burned all the money.

592
00:51:45,086 --> 00:51:47,550
It's the last fucking shit
that I need right now.

593
00:51:47,552 --> 00:51:49,184
Boss, I'm so sorry.

594
00:51:49,186 --> 00:51:50,582
You know that
I would never...

595
00:51:50,584 --> 00:51:51,916
It's just these were
some extenuating...

596
00:51:51,918 --> 00:51:53,219
Shut the fuck up!

597
00:51:56,552 --> 00:51:59,916
Trust me, we will
have a short...

598
00:51:59,918 --> 00:52:02,518
a very short conversation
about this in a minute.

599
00:52:06,884 --> 00:52:08,682
Double security.

600
00:52:08,684 --> 00:52:11,018
Put that bitch
in a box before sunset.

601
00:52:12,518 --> 00:52:14,151
Before she
gets us all killed.

602
00:52:15,918 --> 00:52:17,316
<i>Thank you, Joanna.</i>

603
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:18,916
<i>Today, Los Angeles
has witnessed</i>

604
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:21,149
<i>a disturbing series
of violent events</i>

605
00:52:21,151 --> 00:52:24,216
<i>which some are speculating
are part of a pattern,</i>

606
00:52:24,218 --> 00:52:27,083
<i>possibly even the work
of a single suspect.</i>

607
00:52:27,085 --> 00:52:29,849
<i>According to sources at the
Los Angeles Police Department,</i>

608
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:32,349
<i>everything seems to lead
to the same name,</i>

609
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:33,649
<i>Riley North.</i>

610
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,316
<i>So, who is Riley North?</i>

611
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:38,916
<i>Looking to social media,
theories abound.</i>

612
00:52:38,918 --> 00:52:40,316
<i>One possible link,</i>

613
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:41,882
<i>Riley North's husband
and daughter</i>

614
00:52:41,884 --> 00:52:44,916
<i>were gunned down in a drive-by
shooting, five years ago.</i>

615
00:52:44,918 --> 00:52:49,083
<i>There is a storm of online
speculation about a connection.</i>

616
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:52,216
Folks, I'm gonna need
you behind the tape, thank you.

617
00:52:52,218 --> 00:52:54,083
Thirty-four, Asian, male.

618
00:52:54,085 --> 00:52:56,581
- Yeah, yo. Check it out.
- Roughly...

619
00:52:56,583 --> 00:53:00,415
Well, I got a dozen witnesses who
suddenly went blind and didn't see shit.

620
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:02,348
So we got that
going for us.

621
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:04,748
What the hell are the Koreans
doing, slumming it with Garcia?

622
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,316
Money laundering.

623
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:08,681
Garcia's using their infrastructure
to launder his cash.

624
00:53:08,683 --> 00:53:10,348
These fuckers ain't
gonna be happy.

625
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,650
It's gonna get a whole lot worse
if we don't get ahead of this.

626
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:17,981
We got every black
and white in this city looking,

627
00:53:17,983 --> 00:53:20,348
every camera. Her face
is all over the news.

628
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:22,148
Well, she knows
what she's doing.

629
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:25,148
It's turning into a typical
social media shit storm.

630
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:26,883
Garcia's gonna love
all this attention.

631
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,750
Hey, man.

632
00:53:32,317 --> 00:53:35,017
There's, uh, something I
want you to take a look at.

633
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:36,551
Over here.

634
00:53:37,917 --> 00:53:39,484
Stand back, thank you.

635
00:53:41,817 --> 00:53:44,347
Well, this is
a hard sell.

636
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:46,648
You honestly think that
Riley North did this?

637
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,549
Well, your Fed girlfriend
thinks so.

638
00:53:48,551 --> 00:53:51,248
- My what?
- Stan, my man,

639
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:54,215
you gotta focus on the task at hand.
It's embarrassing.

640
00:53:54,217 --> 00:53:56,681
The only interest I have in
Agent Inman is professional.

641
00:53:56,683 --> 00:53:58,414
- If you say so.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

642
00:53:58,416 --> 00:54:00,981
All right, I'll hit up Gang Narcotics
and see if they have any intel

643
00:54:00,983 --> 00:54:02,681
on suspected
Garcia locations.

644
00:54:02,683 --> 00:54:04,647
Get a list,
set up some Code 5s,

645
00:54:04,649 --> 00:54:06,184
do surveillance
and see if she shows.

646
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,514
You be careful who you ask
those kind of questions to.

647
00:54:10,516 --> 00:54:13,148
- Fuck's sake. Here we go again.
- Oh, hey.

648
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:16,248
It only takes a few guys
in the right places.

649
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,816
Watch your ass
is all I'm saying.

650
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:20,647
And you say hi
to Bigfoot for me.

651
00:54:20,649 --> 00:54:22,215
What, lover's quarrel?

652
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,314
What about Bigfoot?

653
00:54:24,316 --> 00:54:28,381
Yeah, we were debating who gets to
be impressed by your FBI prowess.

654
00:54:28,383 --> 00:54:29,383
I won.

655
00:54:30,483 --> 00:54:32,481
So what are you thinking?

656
00:54:32,483 --> 00:54:35,047
Riley North arrived in LA
almost three months ago.

657
00:54:35,049 --> 00:54:36,816
Aren't you guys a little curious
where she's been hanging out?

658
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,715
You have a crime analysis
department, right?

659
00:54:41,016 --> 00:54:42,816
Yeah, come with me,
I'll take you there.

660
00:55:05,216 --> 00:55:08,016
Cartel up our ass.
And now the Korean Mob?

661
00:55:08,882 --> 00:55:10,183
What's she gonna hit next?

662
00:55:12,348 --> 00:55:14,747
Bet Marvin told her
about the lab.

663
00:55:14,749 --> 00:55:16,647
- That would be my bet.
- Fine.

664
00:55:16,649 --> 00:55:19,183
Then we send everybody there and
just kill her when she shows up.

665
00:55:27,215 --> 00:55:28,215
Boss.

666
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:34,248
How'd she know
about Marvin?

667
00:55:38,315 --> 00:55:40,248
The one guy who happened
to know everything.

668
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,515
And she doesn't kill him.

669
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:47,215
How did she know?

670
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:50,646
She must have been watching us.

671
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:51,712
Oh, you think?

672
00:55:53,315 --> 00:55:55,083
Those missing shipments,
it was her.

673
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:57,881
She's been stirring shit up,

674
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:01,246
finding out the moving pieces.

675
00:56:01,248 --> 00:56:03,482
Bitch has been
fucking with us for weeks.

676
00:56:04,815 --> 00:56:06,380
If that's the case,

677
00:56:06,382 --> 00:56:09,313
then maybe she's expecting us
to send everybody to the lab.

678
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:11,547
That dance is over.

679
00:56:11,549 --> 00:56:13,979
Bitch wanna have
the motherfucking lab,

680
00:56:13,981 --> 00:56:15,581
I will give her
the motherfucking lab.

681
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,845
The system tracks reported
crime in real time.

682
00:57:17,847 --> 00:57:19,912
From that data, we determine
where to send our resources.

683
00:57:19,914 --> 00:57:21,247
Stop problems from spreading.

684
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:23,045
Any anomalies?

685
00:57:23,047 --> 00:57:25,312
Areas of higher violent crime
than expected?

686
00:57:25,314 --> 00:57:26,845
Besides tonight?

687
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:29,711
Going back a few weeks, are
there any areas that stand out?

688
00:57:29,713 --> 00:57:31,912
This can't predict
where she'll turn up next.

689
00:57:31,914 --> 00:57:33,745
It might tell me
where she's been.

690
00:57:33,747 --> 00:57:36,245
Everywhere she goes, people get dead.
She has to be living somewhere.

691
00:57:36,247 --> 00:57:38,211
Maybe I can locate
where she's been staying,

692
00:57:38,213 --> 00:57:39,880
her base of operations.
Find her that way.

693
00:57:50,414 --> 00:57:52,045
Nothing.

694
00:57:52,047 --> 00:57:55,012
No sector or neighborhood
stands out.

695
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:57,180
No abnormal spike
in crimes anywhere.

696
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,046
It was a good idea.
I was impressed.

697
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,511
Really.

698
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,311
Oh, you wanna see something
really interesting?

699
00:58:05,313 --> 00:58:07,980
I was looking at this
before you got here.

700
00:58:09,513 --> 00:58:12,711
Social media is lit up
with support for her.

701
00:58:12,713 --> 00:58:14,845
She's a multiple
homicide suspect.

702
00:58:14,847 --> 00:58:16,978
Well, not to them she's not.

703
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,213
Now that people know what she's been
through, they're rooting for her.

704
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:20,746
Look.

705
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,078
Zoom in.
There. What's that?

706
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,710
Skid Row?

707
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,511
Why does it look
safer than Bel-Air?

708
00:58:29,513 --> 00:58:31,811
Hmm. That's odd.

709
00:58:31,813 --> 00:58:33,677
Has it
always been like that?

710
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:34,746
You keep the data,
right?

711
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:37,746
Can you
give me a minute?

712
00:59:23,547 --> 00:59:25,010
What's going on?

713
00:59:25,012 --> 00:59:26,012
You see anything?

714
00:59:28,012 --> 00:59:29,045
I don't see nothing.

715
00:59:45,145 --> 00:59:46,745
<i>She's in.
Hit the remote.</i>

716
01:00:13,546 --> 01:00:15,076
Uh... Okay,

717
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:18,011
so the crime pattern started
changing about three months ago.

718
01:00:20,645 --> 01:00:22,312
Oh, shit. What's that?

719
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:27,975
Multiple reports
of an explosion.

720
01:00:27,977 --> 01:00:30,310
Fire. Industrial warehouse,
downtown...

721
01:00:30,312 --> 01:00:32,377
You stay here.
I'll catch up with you.

722
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,510
- Catch up? Where are you going?
- I got a hunch.

723
01:00:34,512 --> 01:00:36,676
But we didn't talk about
a hunch.

724
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:39,810
What?

725
01:00:39,812 --> 01:00:41,242
Radios are lighting up.

726
01:00:41,244 --> 01:00:43,544
- <i>What happened?</i>
- Downtown warehouse just exploded.

727
01:00:43,546 --> 01:00:44,643
<i>Is it her again?</i>

728
01:00:44,645 --> 01:00:46,242
I'll check it out.

729
01:00:46,244 --> 01:00:48,409
Was it on the list of Garcia
locations you got from Narco?

730
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,975
- I don't know.
- <i>What the heck does that mean?</i>

731
01:00:49,977 --> 01:00:51,242
<i>Did you get a list or not?</i>

732
01:00:51,244 --> 01:00:53,909
It... I haven't heard back
from them yet, okay?

733
01:00:53,911 --> 01:00:55,743
But I'm on it.

734
01:00:55,745 --> 01:00:58,376
They're probably just busy,
there's a lot going on right now.

735
01:00:58,378 --> 01:01:01,076
Yeah, right. By the way,
Bigfoot says hi.

736
01:01:01,078 --> 01:01:03,875
Oh, come on, Moises, it doesn't
mean anything. They're just...

737
01:01:27,411 --> 01:01:28,511
Hey, are you okay?

738
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:30,874
Hi.

739
01:01:30,876 --> 01:01:32,076
Hey!
Hey, what the...

740
01:01:32,078 --> 01:01:34,675
Hey! Hey!
Get out of my car!

741
01:01:34,677 --> 01:01:36,309
Wait, come on!

742
01:01:36,311 --> 01:01:37,509
Give me my car back!

743
01:02:11,843 --> 01:02:12,843
It's them.

744
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:14,410
They got her.

745
01:02:19,976 --> 01:02:21,075
What's the word?

746
01:02:21,077 --> 01:02:23,075
Hey, boss,
we smoked her ass.

747
01:02:23,077 --> 01:02:24,475
<i>Are you sure?</i>

748
01:02:24,477 --> 01:02:26,175
She was up in there
when it went up.

749
01:02:26,177 --> 01:02:28,041
There's no way she's
living through that shit.

750
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:29,143
Trust me, she's gone.

751
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:40,041
You fools are moving up
in the world.

752
01:02:40,043 --> 01:02:41,510
<i>Be calling some shots
pretty soon.</i>

753
01:02:42,243 --> 01:02:43,341
Thank you, boss.

754
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:44,643
<i>Now get your ass back here.</i>

755
01:02:53,842 --> 01:02:55,143
We'll be calling
some shots!

756
01:02:55,842 --> 01:02:56,909
Whoo!

757
01:03:15,676 --> 01:03:16,676
Mm.

758
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:25,909
That's a cop.

759
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:28,207
How do you know?

760
01:03:28,209 --> 01:03:30,176
Who else would be dumb enough
to bring a new car here?

761
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:39,042
Hi.

762
01:03:40,842 --> 01:03:42,242
Can I talk to you guys
for a second?

763
01:03:46,142 --> 01:03:47,142
You lost?

764
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:50,909
I'm looking for someone.

765
01:03:52,675 --> 01:03:54,640
Looking for someone.

766
01:03:54,642 --> 01:03:56,575
No one's
looking for nobodies.

767
01:03:57,842 --> 01:03:59,675
Isn't it dangerous
at night for the kids?

768
01:04:01,975 --> 01:04:03,340
Not anymore.

769
01:04:03,342 --> 01:04:04,342
Why's that?

770
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,575
'Cause we got an angel now.

771
01:04:39,974 --> 01:04:41,507
Is that car following us?

772
01:04:41,509 --> 01:04:42,972
What are you talking about?

773
01:04:48,641 --> 01:04:50,206
I told you to lay off
that shit, man.

774
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:51,741
- You're getting paranoid.
- Shut the fuck up.

775
01:04:55,241 --> 01:04:56,507
Shit.

776
01:04:56,509 --> 01:04:58,039
What the fuck's up
with that guy?

777
01:04:58,041 --> 01:04:59,041
Oh, no.

778
01:05:22,807 --> 01:05:23,807
Ah, yeah.

779
01:05:26,807 --> 01:05:28,805
Boss,
check it out.

780
01:05:28,807 --> 01:05:31,805
<i>What makes you think
Riley North did this too?</i>

781
01:05:31,807 --> 01:05:34,905
<i>'Cause I saw her jack this
dude's car and just take off.</i>

782
01:05:34,907 --> 01:05:36,208
<i>And she was pissed.</i>

783
01:05:37,673 --> 01:05:40,738
<i>Social media continues
to explode with debate</i>

784
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:44,574
<i>about female vigilante, Riley
North, still on the loose.</i>

785
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:58,673
It's them. Open it.

786
01:06:56,407 --> 01:06:57,407
Kill the lights.

787
01:06:58,540 --> 01:06:59,540
Stay with the boss.

788
01:08:02,073 --> 01:08:05,171
Don't, please. Please, don't.

789
01:08:05,173 --> 01:08:06,738
I'm not here
to hurt you. Shh.

790
01:08:13,373 --> 01:08:15,173
- He...
- Go.

791
01:09:12,571 --> 01:09:13,570
Fuck.

792
01:09:23,471 --> 01:09:25,404
Don't fucking move!

793
01:09:29,338 --> 01:09:30,836
Who the fuck are you?

794
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:31,871
What do you want?

795
01:09:32,504 --> 01:09:33,504
What do I want?

796
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:36,804
I want justice.

797
01:09:37,404 --> 01:09:38,404
Papa?

798
01:09:48,038 --> 01:09:49,570
Come here, baby.
Let's go!

799
01:09:53,138 --> 01:09:54,138
Boss?

800
01:10:01,205 --> 01:10:02,205
Boss?

801
01:10:03,804 --> 01:10:05,069
Boss?

802
01:10:05,071 --> 01:10:07,369
Where is she? Where is she?

803
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:10,802
It's okay, baby.
It's okay. It's okay.

804
01:10:10,804 --> 01:10:12,668
<i>Jefe,</i> we gotta go.
We gotta go now!

805
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:13,735
We gotta go now!

806
01:11:06,403 --> 01:11:07,700
Riley?

807
01:11:09,636 --> 01:11:10,969
Good evening, Peg.

808
01:11:57,203 --> 01:11:58,867
I remembered the address.

809
01:11:58,869 --> 01:12:01,367
Sorry, we missed
the party last time.

810
01:12:01,369 --> 01:12:04,300
Riley,
you're fucking crazy.

811
01:12:04,302 --> 01:12:06,469
Everything they said
about you is true.

812
01:12:09,302 --> 01:12:10,335
You know,

813
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:13,134
I couldn't help but notice,

814
01:12:13,136 --> 01:12:16,235
you're not wearing a ring
on that finger anymore.

815
01:12:17,869 --> 01:12:19,668
He left you, didn't he?

816
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:23,333
For someone younger,
prettier.

817
01:12:23,335 --> 01:12:24,903
Go fuck yourself.

818
01:12:28,835 --> 01:12:29,835
Oops.

819
01:12:31,969 --> 01:12:33,003
Yes, he...

820
01:12:34,036 --> 01:12:35,968
He left, okay?
You're right, I...

821
01:12:37,036 --> 01:12:38,300
Please.

822
01:12:38,302 --> 01:12:40,500
This is... This is
not gonna bring her back.

823
01:12:40,502 --> 01:12:42,467
I... I'm very sorry
that Carly and...

824
01:12:42,469 --> 01:12:43,800
Don't say my daughter's name.

825
01:12:43,802 --> 01:12:45,469
Okay.
I won't. I...

826
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:49,966
You're gonna get
locked away.

827
01:12:49,968 --> 01:12:51,833
You're gonna go to jail
for a very long time.

828
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:53,534
They...
They will catch you.

829
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:56,135
This is not... You don't
wanna be doing this.

830
01:12:59,868 --> 01:13:02,067
- Thank you.
- I'm going to

831
01:13:02,069 --> 01:13:04,201
burn your house down now,
Peg,

832
01:13:05,201 --> 01:13:06,469
with you inside of it.

833
01:13:07,234 --> 01:13:08,334
Oh, good.

834
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,500
Riley.

835
01:13:10,502 --> 01:13:12,633
Riley! Get back here, Riley!

836
01:13:12,635 --> 01:13:14,833
- No!
- Stop squealing, Peg.

837
01:13:14,835 --> 01:13:16,399
- I'm just kidding.
- Riley!

838
01:13:16,401 --> 01:13:17,666
No!

839
01:13:17,668 --> 01:13:18,668
No!

840
01:13:19,002 --> 01:13:20,132
Riley!

841
01:13:39,334 --> 01:13:40,565
Moises.

842
01:13:40,567 --> 01:13:42,234
- Got that info you wanted.
- Shoot.

843
01:13:44,035 --> 01:13:48,033
All right, this place is owned by
an overseas company out of Belize.

844
01:13:48,035 --> 01:13:49,399
So, any number
of assholes can be...

845
01:13:49,401 --> 01:13:50,832
This is Diego Garcia's house.

846
01:13:50,834 --> 01:13:52,033
Hey, I'm just saying.

847
01:13:52,035 --> 01:13:53,466
Hey, you seen Carmichael
anywhere?

848
01:13:53,468 --> 01:13:55,499
I can't get him
on the phone.

849
01:13:55,501 --> 01:13:56,867
Ain't my turn
to watch that baby.

850
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:00,166
Hey, asshole.

851
01:14:00,168 --> 01:14:01,533
If you see him,
tell him to call me.

852
01:14:01,535 --> 01:14:03,499
- Getting a little worried about him.
- Roger that.

853
01:14:03,501 --> 01:14:04,535
Hey, Barker.

854
01:14:05,001 --> 01:14:06,366
Barker.

855
01:14:06,368 --> 01:14:08,299
What the fuck's going on
in Narcotics?

856
01:14:08,301 --> 01:14:10,533
Carmichael's been trying to get
a list of Garcia locations

857
01:14:10,535 --> 01:14:12,332
from you guys
and he gets blown off?

858
01:14:12,334 --> 01:14:14,533
You got somebody trying to
protect that motherfucker?

859
01:14:14,535 --> 01:14:16,466
- Hold on, Moises...
- No, no. Don't "Moises" me.

860
01:14:16,468 --> 01:14:18,734
I've been trying to call
Carmichael all goddamn night.

861
01:14:20,401 --> 01:14:21,698
- What?
- Yeah.

862
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,665
Calls, texts, emails.

863
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:25,698
Even went by his desk twice.

864
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:28,799
We've been trying to coordinate
with him since this thing started.

865
01:14:28,801 --> 01:14:30,200
Who told you
we didn't call him back?

866
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:33,535
He did.

867
01:14:47,667 --> 01:14:49,465
I think
there's another cop.

868
01:14:49,467 --> 01:14:51,965
Where's your backup?
What took you so long?

869
01:14:51,967 --> 01:14:53,965
Sorry, they're
a little behind.

870
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:54,967
What do you got?

871
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,867
I snooped around
a little.

872
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,500
Look what I found.

873
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:02,365
Damn.

874
01:15:02,367 --> 01:15:03,999
The van wasn't even locked.

875
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:06,165
You'd have to be insane to leave
a vehicle in this neighborhood.

876
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:08,532
But unlocked, with an
arsenal in the back?

877
01:15:08,534 --> 01:15:10,001
People are too afraid
to steal from her.

878
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:13,167
I don't think it's fear,
Stan.

879
01:15:17,001 --> 01:15:19,165
It's not some software glitch
that makes this area low crime.

880
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,465
It is low crime
because of her.

881
01:15:21,467 --> 01:15:23,532
So how do you wanna play it?

882
01:15:23,534 --> 01:15:26,331
Set up surveillance, apprehend
her when she returns.

883
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:28,532
- We can take her alive.
- Alive?

884
01:15:28,534 --> 01:15:31,564
She's obviously been watching
Garcia's operation for weeks.

885
01:15:31,566 --> 01:15:33,064
God only knows
what she's figured out.

886
01:15:33,066 --> 01:15:35,864
We get her to talk, we take
down him, his suppliers,

887
01:15:35,866 --> 01:15:37,200
everything and everybody.

888
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:39,398
If the rumors are true,

889
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,831
Garcia has someone tipping
him from the inside.

890
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,798
And she's gotten closer
than we ever will.

891
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,130
I'm gonna head back
to the office,

892
01:15:45,132 --> 01:15:47,130
I'll coordinate
the inter-agency, FBI,

893
01:15:47,132 --> 01:15:50,164
DEA, LAPD,
and Internal Affairs.

894
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:52,564
Hey, Inman, I have to
tell you something.

895
01:15:52,566 --> 01:15:54,900
- Yeah, what?
- I'm sorry.

896
01:16:24,698 --> 01:16:26,130
I know where to find her.

897
01:16:26,132 --> 01:16:27,364
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

898
01:16:27,366 --> 01:16:28,797
You gather your crew.

899
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,499
Tell those fuckers it's
time to earn their money.

900
01:16:32,665 --> 01:16:34,730
I don't care if we have
to burn the city down.

901
01:16:34,732 --> 01:16:36,900
But this shit ends tonight.
Understood?

902
01:17:12,732 --> 01:17:15,163
Let's get
these motherfuckers.

903
01:17:15,165 --> 01:17:16,563
I got someone
in the 911 center.

904
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:18,830
Any calls from this area
will route through him.

905
01:17:18,832 --> 01:17:20,031
We gotta to do this fast.

906
01:17:22,398 --> 01:17:24,129
Is this smart?

907
01:17:24,131 --> 01:17:26,131
We're announcing ourselves. I
don't know that she's here yet.

908
01:17:26,665 --> 01:17:28,029
If she's here,

909
01:17:28,031 --> 01:17:29,031
we'll find her.

910
01:17:29,998 --> 01:17:30,998
All right, let's go.

911
01:17:39,964 --> 01:17:40,998
- Hey!
- Get up!

912
01:17:43,365 --> 01:17:44,365
Get out of here.

913
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:53,131
Check over there.

914
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:47,297
Mom.

915
01:18:51,963 --> 01:18:53,662
Mom.

916
01:18:53,664 --> 01:18:55,495
You have to wake up, now.

917
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:09,062
We got something here.

918
01:19:09,064 --> 01:19:10,828
<i>Warehouse,
west of the alley.</i>

919
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:11,997
Whoa, whoa, come on.

920
01:19:49,397 --> 01:19:51,129
<i>Talk to me, guys,
what's going on?</i>

921
01:19:53,896 --> 01:19:54,996
<i>Did you find her?</i>

922
01:19:56,129 --> 01:19:57,796
<i>Maybe. Going in now.</i>

923
01:20:18,229 --> 01:20:19,229
Holy shit.

924
01:20:20,296 --> 01:20:21,296
Man down.

925
01:20:54,861 --> 01:20:56,961
<i>Cortez, we heard gunshots.
Did you get her?</i>

926
01:20:58,063 --> 01:20:59,063
<i>Cortez.</i>

927
01:21:09,728 --> 01:21:11,227
Listen to me.

928
01:21:11,229 --> 01:21:12,826
<i>Get outta here.</i>

929
01:21:12,828 --> 01:21:14,959
<i>Leave these people alone.</i>

930
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:18,160
<i>Just give me Garcia and go.</i>

931
01:21:18,162 --> 01:21:20,560
Or so help me God,
I will kill every

932
01:21:20,562 --> 01:21:22,126
<i>single one of you.</i>

933
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:23,293
<i>Your choice.</i>

934
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:24,328
She's bluffing!

935
01:21:32,496 --> 01:21:34,195
I can hear the pain
in your voice.

936
01:21:35,828 --> 01:21:36,828
<i>You're hurting.</i>

937
01:21:37,795 --> 01:21:39,028
<i>You're hurting bad.</i>

938
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:42,360
<i>Out-manned, out-gunned.</i>

939
01:21:42,362 --> 01:21:44,128
How you really think
this is gonna go?

940
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:51,859
I'm gonna shoot you
in your fucking face.

941
01:21:51,861 --> 01:21:53,995
<i>And then I'll pretty much
figure it out from there.</i>

942
01:21:54,561 --> 01:21:55,660
I'll see you soon.

943
01:22:10,627 --> 01:22:12,295
<i>You've
reached Special Agent Lisa Inman.</i>

944
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,128
- She's not answering me, either.
- Shit.

945
01:22:15,827 --> 01:22:17,293
We gotta find her.

946
01:22:17,295 --> 01:22:19,691
See if we can get a location
on Inman's cell phone.

947
01:22:19,693 --> 01:22:22,792
- Find out where it last pinged a tower.
- Yeah, already ahead of you.

948
01:22:22,794 --> 01:22:24,295
Hi, this is
Special Agent Li.

949
01:22:25,128 --> 01:22:26,725
I need
a cell phone location.

950
01:22:26,727 --> 01:22:28,460
- This is Barker, Narcotics.
- Special Agent Lisa Inman.

951
01:22:28,462 --> 01:22:30,658
I need a stingray van
immediately, Los Angeles area.

952
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:34,193
- 323 555-9357.
- What? Yeah, yeah, right now.

953
01:23:05,194 --> 01:23:06,992
Where's the remote?

954
01:23:06,994 --> 01:23:08,292
Where's the remote for the TV?

955
01:23:08,294 --> 01:23:09,361
- Where's the remote?
- Here.

956
01:23:11,994 --> 01:23:13,658
- <i>...prove it to you right now.</i>
- Moises, we got the van.

957
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:14,727
<i>Look.</i>

958
01:23:16,559 --> 01:23:17,690
Okay.

959
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:18,792
You see,

960
01:23:18,794 --> 01:23:21,059
<i>that guy is a dirty cop.</i>

961
01:23:21,061 --> 01:23:22,127
Motherfucker.

962
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,292
<i>That scumbag right there,</i>

963
01:23:25,294 --> 01:23:26,892
<i>that is Diego Garcia.</i>

964
01:23:26,894 --> 01:23:29,394
He is the man who killed
my entire family.

965
01:23:33,227 --> 01:23:35,292
<i>If you have a news crew,
come on down,</i>

966
01:23:35,294 --> 01:23:37,159
<i>and if you have a cell phone</i>

967
01:23:37,161 --> 01:23:39,059
<i>and you wanna come and
take videos, come on down.</i>

968
01:23:39,061 --> 01:23:40,626
<i>And if you are the LAPD,</i>

969
01:23:42,361 --> 01:23:44,125
<i>this is where the party is.</i>

970
01:23:44,127 --> 01:23:46,657
<i>I'm not going anywhere.
Come and get me.</i>

971
01:23:46,659 --> 01:23:48,359
<i>I'm Riley North.
I'm in Skid Row,</i>

972
01:23:48,361 --> 01:23:50,891
<i>I'm on the corner
of Olympic and San Julian.</i>

973
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:52,325
- We got a location!
- <i>Riley?</i>

974
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:53,659
Let's go! Let's go!

975
01:23:54,793 --> 01:23:56,394
Let me go! No!

976
01:23:57,993 --> 01:23:59,359
- Stop.
- Hey.

977
01:23:59,361 --> 01:24:01,461
Come on, man.
He's just a kid.

978
01:24:03,626 --> 01:24:05,826
You're in this.
You've always been in this.

979
01:24:06,461 --> 01:24:07,461
You want out,

980
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:08,959
just nod.

981
01:24:11,559 --> 01:24:13,692
No, you're right. I'm in.

982
01:24:17,993 --> 01:24:19,391
Maria!

983
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:21,626
Hey,
soon-to-be dead bitch,

984
01:24:22,126 --> 01:24:23,724
<i>you hear me?</i>

985
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:25,891
I've got someone here
I want you to meet.

986
01:24:25,893 --> 01:24:27,060
Say your name, sweetheart.

987
01:24:29,859 --> 01:24:31,324
Tell her your name.

988
01:24:31,326 --> 01:24:33,659
My name is Maria.

989
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:36,690
<i>Maria, here,</i>

990
01:24:36,692 --> 01:24:39,524
she's about to die
because of you.

991
01:24:39,526 --> 01:24:43,391
Damn. You just don't seem to have
any luck with little girls, do you?

992
01:24:50,492 --> 01:24:51,558
No! Stop!

993
01:25:22,776 --> 01:25:23,700
I'm gonna count to five.

994
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,268
Then I'm gonna blow
her fucking head off.

995
01:25:29,034 --> 01:25:30,034
One...

996
01:25:31,034 --> 01:25:32,034
No!

997
01:25:33,101 --> 01:25:34,101
Two...

998
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:39,065
Maria.

999
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:40,100
Three...

1000
01:25:43,567 --> 01:25:44,567
<i>Four...</i>

1001
01:25:45,301 --> 01:25:46,733
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1002
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,764
SWAT team is
ten minutes behind us.

1003
01:25:49,766 --> 01:25:51,134
Forget it.
We're not waiting.

1004
01:26:06,534 --> 01:26:08,232
Drop the gun!

1005
01:26:26,967 --> 01:26:28,365
Are you okay?

1006
01:26:28,367 --> 01:26:29,731
I knew you'd save me.

1007
01:26:29,733 --> 01:26:30,898
I knew it.

1008
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,398
You were right.

1009
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,533
Here I am.

1010
01:26:34,933 --> 01:26:35,933
Let her go.

1011
01:26:46,533 --> 01:26:48,265
You have to go now,
Maria.

1012
01:26:48,267 --> 01:26:49,564
You have to come
with me.

1013
01:26:49,566 --> 01:26:50,930
- I can't. I wish I could.
- No!

1014
01:26:50,932 --> 01:26:53,298
- Get her outta here. Come on.
- Just go. Get safe.

1015
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:54,930
No! Please!

1016
01:26:54,932 --> 01:26:57,531
No! No, get off me!
Please!

1017
01:26:57,533 --> 01:26:58,600
Get off me!

1018
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,400
No!

1019
01:27:00,899 --> 01:27:02,600
Stop. Stop.

1020
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:12,533
Are you scared of me?

1021
01:27:24,233 --> 01:27:27,032
Is this where you have one
of your flunkies shoot me?

1022
01:27:27,866 --> 01:27:29,197
Coward.

1023
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:31,297
You don't wanna get
your hand dirty, huh?

1024
01:27:34,032 --> 01:27:35,032
Get her up.

1025
01:27:44,432 --> 01:27:46,131
- I'm waiting.
- We gotta get outta here.

1026
01:27:46,133 --> 01:27:47,563
She's toying with you.
Stalling.

1027
01:27:47,565 --> 01:27:49,231
- Just get it over with.
- Shut the fuck up!

1028
01:27:49,233 --> 01:27:50,532
Let me have a little fun here.

1029
01:27:54,465 --> 01:27:55,532
No!

1030
01:28:00,099 --> 01:28:01,798
You hit like a girl.

1031
01:28:06,798 --> 01:28:07,798
Oh, Jesus.

1032
01:28:08,932 --> 01:28:11,565
You see that?
She ain't toying with shit.

1033
01:28:17,099 --> 01:28:19,963
I must say that
I'm a bit disappointed.

1034
01:28:19,965 --> 01:28:21,929
I thought you were
gonna put on a real fight.

1035
01:28:21,931 --> 01:28:23,031
Make it fun for me.

1036
01:28:26,098 --> 01:28:27,233
You wanna hear a secret?

1037
01:28:31,565 --> 01:28:33,297
You should've
listened to Carmichael.

1038
01:28:38,764 --> 01:28:41,297
<i>LAPD.
Stay where you are.</i>

1039
01:28:41,299 --> 01:28:42,764
<i>Drop your weapons.</i>

1040
01:28:44,731 --> 01:28:45,731
Police!

1041
01:28:49,465 --> 01:28:50,465
Police!

1042
01:28:52,232 --> 01:28:53,530
Police!

1043
01:28:53,532 --> 01:28:54,731
- You sold me, <i>puto.</i>
- No!

1044
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:06,896
Uh, you guys can't
go through here. Stay back.

1045
01:29:06,898 --> 01:29:07,898
Yo, hey!

1046
01:29:12,898 --> 01:29:13,898
Move! Move!

1047
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:38,264
Out of my fucking way!

1048
01:29:54,897 --> 01:29:56,628
Riley North!

1049
01:29:56,630 --> 01:29:59,062
Step back! We got him.

1050
01:29:59,064 --> 01:30:00,962
We'll take care of it.

1051
01:30:00,964 --> 01:30:02,862
Like you did last time?

1052
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:04,695
No, he ain't getting away.

1053
01:30:04,697 --> 01:30:06,296
Just drop the gun.

1054
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:11,429
Riley!

1055
01:30:11,431 --> 01:30:12,564
On the ground!

1056
01:30:13,663 --> 01:30:16,064
Don't do it.
I'm begging you.

1057
01:30:19,363 --> 01:30:21,129
Please, Riley.

1058
01:30:21,131 --> 01:30:22,795
You're a crazy ass.

1059
01:30:22,797 --> 01:30:25,964
You'll spend more time
in prison than me.

1060
01:30:28,396 --> 01:30:30,097
We're not going to prison.

1061
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:37,629
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1062
01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:39,530
Fuck!

1063
01:30:54,196 --> 01:30:55,296
Where the hell is she?

1064
01:31:06,796 --> 01:31:09,597
Airship, Airship, what do you see?
You got eyes on anything?

1065
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:13,729
<i>Negative. Negative.
We lost visual.</i>

1066
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:17,927
Total clusterfuck.

1067
01:31:17,929 --> 01:31:20,027
She could be anywhere.

1068
01:31:20,029 --> 01:31:21,896
We're setting a perimeter
ten blocks out, but...

1069
01:31:22,363 --> 01:31:23,528
Who knows?

1070
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:25,029
Don't bother.
I know where she's going.

1071
01:32:14,596 --> 01:32:15,862
I've missed you.

1072
01:32:16,929 --> 01:32:18,462
I've missed you so much.

1073
01:32:19,395 --> 01:32:20,963
I miss you so much.

1074
01:32:32,362 --> 01:32:33,362
Riley.

1075
01:32:35,129 --> 01:32:36,362
My husband.

1076
01:32:36,928 --> 01:32:38,062
My daughter.

1077
01:32:40,795 --> 01:32:42,262
They're waiting for me.

1078
01:32:43,628 --> 01:32:45,126
Please, just let me die.

1079
01:32:45,128 --> 01:32:46,362
I can't do that.

1080
01:32:49,529 --> 01:32:51,462
This isn't where
the story ends.

1081
01:32:54,562 --> 01:32:55,895
It is for me.

1082
01:33:08,128 --> 01:33:10,028
Need an RA! Now!

1083
01:33:26,795 --> 01:33:29,692
<i>Thank you.
So is Riley North a vigilante,</i>

1084
01:33:29,694 --> 01:33:33,059
<i>folk hero, common criminal,
or all of the above?</i>

1085
01:33:33,061 --> 01:33:37,593
<i>Public opinion seems largely in support
of her, but the law may not agree.</i>

1086
01:33:37,595 --> 01:33:40,960
<i>The LAPD's stance was clarified
just an hour ago</i>

1087
01:33:40,962 --> 01:33:43,126
<i>by Chief Matthew Rogers.</i>

1088
01:33:43,128 --> 01:33:46,725
<i>The Los Angeles Police
Department's position is clear.</i>

1089
01:33:46,727 --> 01:33:49,426
<i>Riley North will answer
for her actions.</i>

1090
01:33:49,428 --> 01:33:52,526
<i>And she will stand trial
for multiple counts of homicide.</i>

1091
01:33:52,528 --> 01:33:53,927
<i>Questions?</i>

1092
01:33:57,927 --> 01:34:01,226
How you doing? Detective Beltran.
I'll take over for a bit.

1093
01:34:01,228 --> 01:34:02,627
Why don't you grab
yourself a cup of coffee?

1094
01:34:03,093 --> 01:34:04,127
Okay.

1095
01:34:15,394 --> 01:34:16,394
Hi, Riley.

1096
01:34:19,595 --> 01:34:20,595
Remember me?

1097
01:34:23,794 --> 01:34:24,794
How you feeling?

1098
01:34:29,026 --> 01:34:31,927
You killed a lot of
very bad people.

1099
01:34:33,127 --> 01:34:36,460
You took down
a massive drug operation.

1100
01:34:38,227 --> 01:34:41,024
Exposed dirty bastards,

1101
01:34:41,026 --> 01:34:42,427
in my own department.

1102
01:34:45,527 --> 01:34:49,127
There's not a cop I know
that...

1103
01:34:50,594 --> 01:34:51,594
Well,

1104
01:34:53,861 --> 01:34:57,894
let's just say, some of us wish
things didn't have to be this way.

1105
01:35:06,926 --> 01:35:07,925
Well...

1106
01:35:12,959 --> 01:35:14,127
Hope you get better soon.

1107
01:35:34,094 --> 01:35:39,094
