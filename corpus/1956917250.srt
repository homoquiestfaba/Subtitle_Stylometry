1
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,171
Mommy's coming.

2
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:33,384
What did I tell you about
dressing like a girl.

3
00:00:33,385 --> 00:00:34,761
Get that dress off right now.

4
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:36,296
Right now.

5
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:38,251
Get it off.

6
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,940
Get it off.

7
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,073
It's for your own good.

8
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:45,256
No, my God.

9
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:46,312
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,236
This is for your own good.

11
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:52,744
Get dressed.

12
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:54,039
And get the hell outside.

13
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,928
What have you done?

14
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:51,979
What have you done to yourself?

15
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:48,647
Do you have a question?

16
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:50,759
I want to paint some clouds on it.

17
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,095
Sorry, I, I need to read your lips?

18
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:57,990
Oh, I want to paint some clouds on this,
but I'm not sure how.

19
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:02,504
Okay, get a small amount of
white on the end of your brush.

20
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:04,999
Yeah, and you use circular strokes.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,504
Like that?

22
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:07,815
It's perfect.

23
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:09,480
Looks great.

24
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,718
Your sister Michelle's here?

25
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,678
Oh.

26
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:17,222
Hi.

27
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:18,440
They cancelled drama club.

28
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:19,944
So I thought I'd ride home with you.

29
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:21,126
Okay.

30
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:23,079
I still need to do the last speech,

31
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,493
probably another 15 minutes.

32
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:28,071
Alright,
I'll be outside working on my French.

33
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:31,430
Only 962 more days until we move to Paris.

34
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:33,639
Uh, uh, 965.

35
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,174
We're going to your graduation ceremony.

36
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:36,134
If we must.

37
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:38,281
Um huh.

38
00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:47,751
Everybody, put down your brushes,

39
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:49,543
if you'd stop painting and look up here.

40
00:03:49,544 --> 00:03:51,335
Good job.

41
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:53,383
Okay, before we start cleaning up.

42
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:56,071
I want to say a few more words
about overcoming adversity.

43
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:57,511
Okay?

44
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:58,790
Now when we came in this morning,

45
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,199
how many of you thought that your paintings

46
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,760
would turn out half as good as they did?

47
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,510
Anybody?

48
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,239
Okay, but they're really great.

49
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,583
<i>They're beautiful.</i>

50
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:11,975
<i>That's because you all
believed in yourself.</i>

51
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:14,663
You broke down the challenge
into manageable steps

52
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:16,230
and gave it your best effort.

53
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:19,654
You turned a problem into a masterpiece.

54
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:24,647
And these steps can really be
used to overcome any obstacle.

55
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:26,310
That's the most important message here guys

56
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:28,775
is you can achieve anything.

57
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,421
Please.

58
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:09,765
Oh God.

59
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:11,334
No, please.

60
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:52,169
<i>962 more days till we move to Paris.</i>

61
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:12,870
<i>So, how are you doing?</i>

62
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:14,468
How's school going?

63
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:17,318
I got an A minus on the first physics test,

64
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,006
but I'm not really worried
cause we get to drop a score.

65
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:21,670
Drop that one.

66
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:22,630
Yeah. It's very bad.

67
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,750
It is. Bad grade.

68
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:27,621
compared to last years.

69
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:29,318
<i>You smarty pants.</i>

70
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:41,252
<i>Mrs. Pierson called me about the bullying.</i>

71
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:42,790
She says a click of girls
have been calling you names

72
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,838
and tripping you in the halls?

73
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:48,998
Everyone at school calls me the fetus,

74
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:52,101
it's like they don't want
anything to do with me.

75
00:06:52,102 --> 00:06:54,692
And I was so excited about
skipping seventh and eighth

76
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:56,680
and going straight to high school,

77
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,389
<i>but now I think it was the biggest mistake</i>

78
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,312
<i>I've ever made.</i>

79
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:25,605
I know how cruel high school girls can be,
okay?

80
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:26,693
But you can't let them get to you.

81
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:28,901
You are amazing.

82
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:31,525
So smart and funny and kind.

83
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:34,437
I'd trade all of that just to have boobs.

84
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:37,637
<i>Baby, those girls aren't like you.</i>

85
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:38,757
<i>okay?</i>

86
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,357
<i>All they care about are their clicks</i>

87
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:42,789
<i>and their boyfriends and their popularity.</i>

88
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,285
<i>And pretty soon, you're gonna blossom</i>

89
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:48,136
<i>into the most beautiful girl in school.</i>

90
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:00,520
<i>I got you something.</i>

91
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:07,237
Big sister promise: by
the time you graduate,

92
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:14,375
I will have saved enough money
to move us both to Paris.

93
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:16,933
Are you serious?

94
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:17,893
Yes, we will get an apartment

95
00:08:17,894 --> 00:08:19,300
<i>and you will go to school</i>

96
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:21,157
<i>and I'll wait tables
and while all those other girls</i>

97
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:23,556
<i>are reminiscing about
pep rallies and keggers,</i>

98
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:27,045
<i>you and I will be busy
exploring the city of light.</i>

99
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:30,217
<i>Oh my God, thank you so much Lily.</i>

100
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:34,340
<i>Okay, but there's one more thing.</i>

101
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:35,876
Um huh.

102
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:38,596
If you ever find yourself in a situation

103
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:42,372
with those girls or a boy, or anyone,

104
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:47,397
and you feel like things are
spiraling out of control,

105
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:52,583
you do whatever it takes
to defend yourself.

106
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,973
You understand me?

107
00:08:55,974 --> 00:08:57,827
Yes.

108
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,173
Okay.

109
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:03,075
I got you through foster care,

110
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,092
we'll get you through high school.

111
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:07,062
Okay. Just keep your nose in those books

112
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:09,796
<i>and you learn as much French as you can.</i>

113
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:11,332
<i>Okay.</i>

114
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,387
<i>You promise me?</i>

115
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:14,499
<i>Yes, I promise.</i>

116
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,712
<i>Pinkie promise.</i>

117
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,315
<i>Mommy said that a lot.</i>

118
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:23,461
<i>I don't remember.</i>

119
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,122
<i>After losing Michelle I
spiraled deeper into the abyss</i>

120
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:20,871
<i>than I ever have been before.</i>

121
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:24,643
At least after losing my hearing

122
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:25,957
I had my mom to comfort me

123
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:29,539
and baby Michelle to distract me.

124
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,914
Then after my mom passed,
Michelle and I had each other.

125
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:37,059
I was focused on guiding her
through foster care,

126
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,738
and getting ready to legally adopt her.

127
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:43,815
But when Michelle died,

128
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:50,915
I, I never felt so alone,

129
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,094
<i>so utterly lacking direction.</i>

130
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:56,354
When I ran out of savings

131
00:11:56,355 --> 00:11:58,659
it was the best thing
that could have happened.

132
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,026
Forced me to face the world again

133
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:03,075
and to find a new path for my life.

134
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:05,539
Well, I so glad you've
chosen Cassadaga University

135
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,387
to be the compass for that new path.

136
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:10,723
We're all excited to have the daughter

137
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:13,283
of such a highly regarded alumni.

138
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:15,363
<i>And if you're half as talented as your mom,</i>

139
00:12:15,364 --> 00:12:17,477
<i>you'll make the university proud.</i>

140
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:23,106
I just, I really want to thank you again,

141
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:26,914
and not just for the scholarship
and a place to live,

142
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:29,635
but I know you had to pull some strings

143
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:31,811
<i>to get some admissions requirements waived</i>

144
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:33,890
<i>and I really appreciate it.</i>

145
00:12:33,891 --> 00:12:35,491
No, that's nonsense.

146
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:37,858
You're a first choice applicant.

147
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:40,034
And with what you've accomplished,

148
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:42,627
the obstacles you've overcome,

149
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,506
<i>I have no doubt that you
are the ideal recipient</i>

150
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:47,650
<i>for the merit award.</i>

151
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:49,315
Thank you for saying that.

152
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:52,227
Now, let's take a tour of the house,

153
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:54,883
and then I'll show you where
you're going to stay.

154
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:56,037
Okay, please.

155
00:12:57,955 --> 00:13:01,026
<i>We are a bit particular
when it comes to our privacy,</i>

156
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:03,714
<i>so I hope you'll use your discretion</i>

157
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:05,953
<i>when you invite guests over.</i>

158
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:06,818
I will.

159
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:07,874
And I know you may have noticed

160
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,145
that there are a few areas that are locked.

161
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:12,866
And I did that for your convenience,

162
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:16,161
because I want you to have
total access to the house

163
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:20,674
without worrying about what
may or may not be off limits.

164
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,459
Okay, no problem.

165
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,835
I love the trees here.

166
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,466
<i>They're live oaks.</i>

167
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:27,555
<i>Is that moss hanging off?</i>

168
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,954
Yeah, beautiful.

169
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:37,763
That's my grandson, Thomas.

170
00:13:37,764 --> 00:13:40,866
He keeps to himself on the upper floor.

171
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:43,969
<i>You'll hardly know he's here.</i>

172
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,554
So the old house is mostly unfurnished,

173
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:49,761
but your bedroom is cozy.

174
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,234
It gets wonderful light.

175
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:53,186
You have all the solitude you need

176
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,265
to concentrate on your painting.

177
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:57,027
Yeah, it's amazing.

178
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:59,873
Uh, I've never seen anything like it.

179
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:01,346
I know it's eccentric,

180
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:03,426
but I just couldn't bring
myself to tear it down

181
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:07,170
when we moved into the new house.

182
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:10,177
There's 100 years of history in that house

183
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:15,489
and four generations of my
family that called it home.

184
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,314
Well, here are the keys.

185
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,194
<i>So go and get settled in.</i>

186
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:21,985
<i>If you need a hand, just let me know</i>

187
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,426
<i>and I'll send Thomas.</i>

188
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:26,404
Okay, great, thank you.

189
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:43,008
Hey munch get off the ground.

190
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:44,256
Sorry I'm late,

191
00:16:44,257 --> 00:16:47,841
I had a cardiac arrest
at the end of my shift.

192
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:48,960
It's okay, daddy.

193
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:49,921
Yeah?

194
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:50,912
Saving people's lives

195
00:16:50,913 --> 00:16:52,449
is the most important job in the world.

196
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,761
No it's not.

197
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,904
Being your dad is the most
important job in the world.

198
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:57,345
Saving lives is a distant second,

199
00:16:57,346 --> 00:16:58,433
remember that, alright.

200
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,488
What'd I just say?

201
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:01,952
Saving lives is a distant second.

202
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:03,009
<i>Yes ma'am.</i>

203
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,161
<i>And when she was 14,</i>

204
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:06,432
<i>she got menintitus and went deaf.</i>

205
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:07,841
<i>Menintitus.</i>

206
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:08,928
<i>I never heard of Menintitus,</i>

207
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:10,528
<i>you sure it's not Meningitis?</i>

208
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,727
Meningitis, yeah,

209
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:16,576
and she knows how to speak
French and English,

210
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,431
Sign Language. Wow.

211
00:17:18,432 --> 00:17:20,255
And her mom was in the Symphony

212
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:22,304
and she taught her how to play the cello.

213
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,191
She's a pretty good art teacher too, huh?

214
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:25,344
Maybe we should think about

215
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,624
getting you some private lessons?

216
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,287
Really, can I please?

217
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:29,632
It's cool with me,
if it's cool with your mom.

218
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,393
There she is.

219
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:33,535
Hailey, watch for the cars.

220
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:35,430
Come on.

221
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,983
Guess what? What?

222
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:44,415
My dad said I can take painting lessons.

223
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,280
Did you see that car coming?

224
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:48,159
You gotta watch for cars girl.

225
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,311
Hi.

226
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:51,201
Hi. I'm Lily Murrow,

227
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:53,663
I taught the art seminar
for your daughter's class today.

228
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:54,593
I'm Mike.

229
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:55,583
Her dad.

230
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:56,576
Nice to meet you.

231
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:57,503
Your daughter's great in class,

232
00:17:57,504 --> 00:17:59,840
very polite, very attentive.

233
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:02,463
Yeah, she really seems to enjoy it,

234
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:05,439
I've never seen her so excited
about anything, really.

235
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,032
Well, she's got the eye, great instincts.

236
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:10,176
Here, let me give you some information

237
00:18:10,177 --> 00:18:12,707
and you and your wife can look it over.

238
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,919
I'm divorced actually.

239
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,728
Oh, well, do you want to set
something up right now then?

240
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:24,672
Yeah, you know,
I'm in the middle of a custody thing,

241
00:18:24,673 --> 00:18:26,623
so I don't, I only get her sporadically,

242
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:29,535
but I do know that I have her on Saturday

243
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:31,584
<i>if that's not too hard on your social life?</i>

244
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:33,664
I just moved here a couple days ago

245
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:37,152
so I don't really have
a social life right now.

246
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:39,648
Uh, Saturday?

247
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:40,960
Saturday at two?

248
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:43,200
Yeah, two o'clock, yeah?

249
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:44,160
Two o'clock. Yeah.

250
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:45,184
Sounds good.

251
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:47,552
Um, great, I'll see you then.

252
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:50,208
Bye. Bye.

253
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,168
Let's go.

254
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:52,607
You like my teacher.

255
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:53,536
She's pretty.

256
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:55,300
<i>You like my teacher.</i>

257
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:17,064
Why did you let me die?

258
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:43,711
Hi.

259
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:47,039
Oh, I'm so sorry to bother you
so early on a Saturday morning.

260
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,191
No, it's okay.

261
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:50,206
I have a friend coming
over to pick up a book

262
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:52,224
and Thomas isn't answering his phone

263
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,471
so I thought you wouldn't mind

264
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:56,447
running upstairs for me and grabbing it?

265
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:58,477
Oh yeah, of course, no problem.

266
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:15,714
<i>Get away from me now.</i>

267
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:20,320
<i>Touch me.</i>

268
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:21,961
<i>Ahhhh.</i>

269
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,711
<i>I love your use of color and composition.</i>

270
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,111
<i>I think the yellows are
blended really well.</i>

271
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:01,278
We need to work on the depth.

272
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,415
Here, let me show you something.

273
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,694
When you're painting the vase,

274
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:08,799
if you make arching strokes like this,

275
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,710
It'll give it a more
three dimensional appearance.

276
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:13,187
Want to try?

277
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:19,102
<i>Nice job, that's perfect.</i>

278
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:20,803
<i>Just like that.</i>

279
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,656
You're my favorite teacher Ms. Murrow.

280
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:29,182
That's sweet.

281
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:31,072
I like you too.

282
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,914
<i>Yeah.</i>

283
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,791
Mom, me, Michelle.

284
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,839
Very pretty.

285
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,446
Thank you.

286
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,270
Um, this is the last picture of her

287
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,598
<i>before she found out about the cancer.</i>

288
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,061
<i>We were celebrating her offer</i>

289
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:03,422
<i>to return to the orchestra to Paris.</i>

290
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,373
You?

291
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:07,390
<i>Dad?</i>

292
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:08,766
Dad, father?

293
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:12,541
No, he's just a friend from the orchestra.

294
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,660
I don't have any pictures of my father.

295
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:19,455
<i>I love this one.</i>

296
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,709
<i>This is Michelle in her
first dance in Middle School.</i>

297
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,215
Great job today.

298
00:22:25,216 --> 00:22:26,527
Next time we're gonna paint
something in the garden.

299
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:27,901
Okay?

300
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:29,597
Give me a hug.

301
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,254
Go wait in the car.

302
00:22:32,255 --> 00:22:34,531
Go wait in the car, come on.

303
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:42,302
Um, a few of us EMTs we,
we get together on Sundays and we

304
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:46,110
Um, if you don't look at me,
I can't read your lips.

305
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:47,070
Right.

306
00:22:49,246 --> 00:22:50,973
You want to go out with me tomorrow,

307
00:22:50,974 --> 00:22:53,245
maybe get a drink and some food?

308
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,941
Make some friends?

309
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:57,086
Yeah, I'd like that.

310
00:22:57,087 --> 00:22:58,013
Yeah?

311
00:22:58,014 --> 00:22:58,974
Great.

312
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:00,253
Seven o'clock.

313
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,374
<i>Yeah, that's fine.</i>

314
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,702
Okay, so I'll see you then.

315
00:23:04,703 --> 00:23:06,144
Okay.

316
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,710
<i>Oh come on, don't be such a poor sport.</i>

317
00:23:43,711 --> 00:23:45,916
<i>Just admit it already,</i>

318
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:47,805
<i>you chose a stupid internship</i>

319
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:49,694
and it's a complete waste of your time.

320
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:50,685
The only waste of my time

321
00:23:50,686 --> 00:23:52,732
is trying to have a conversation with you.

322
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,685
Ohhhh.

323
00:23:54,686 --> 00:23:56,253
Pitcher of Miller Light please.

324
00:23:56,254 --> 00:23:57,340
What are you guys fighting about this time.

325
00:23:57,341 --> 00:23:59,452
These guys, they're always

326
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:00,764
<i>Did you hear about this.</i>

327
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:01,724
Okay?

328
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:04,156
She has taken a paranormal,

329
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:06,877
psychology internship, okay?

330
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,734
The whole night she's been
trying to convince me

331
00:24:08,735 --> 00:24:11,388
that those crystal ball gazing crack pots

332
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:15,580
are actually the gate keepers of truth.

333
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,437
That is not at all what I've been saying.

334
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:18,652
Oh really?

335
00:24:18,653 --> 00:24:22,941
The point I was making
is the phenomena exists.

336
00:24:22,942 --> 00:24:24,125
Sure.

337
00:24:24,126 --> 00:24:26,204
99.9 percent of so-called psychics

338
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:27,869
are easily exposed as frauds,

339
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,221
but the remaining one tenth of one percent,

340
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:37,277
those people have inexplicable
abilities that will astound you.

341
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:39,870
Where'd you get those statistics?

342
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:41,116
Don't let her fool you okay.

343
00:24:41,117 --> 00:24:45,437
She butters up her bull shit
with ten dollar words.

344
00:24:45,438 --> 00:24:46,461
It ain't gonna work.

345
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:48,668
Then why has every administration

346
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:50,749
since Eisenhower kept psychics on retainer,

347
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,925
spent hundreds of millions of dollars

348
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:55,324
trying to militarize their abilities.

349
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:57,758
<i>Your boy Regan, spent more money</i>

350
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,820
on psychic research than all
the other presidents combined.

351
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:03,005
Prove it.

352
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:05,276
Prove it, tonight.

353
00:25:05,277 --> 00:25:06,269
Okay.

354
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,604
Break out your little psychic rolodex

355
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:11,293
and you find me the most inexplicable

356
00:25:11,294 --> 00:25:14,268
of all your supposed psychics.

357
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:15,261
Huh?

358
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:16,444
Ya'll, ya'll want to do this.

359
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:17,809
Who wants to talk to Elvis?

360
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:32,893
Sorry, bingo ended 30 minutes ago.

361
00:25:32,894 --> 00:25:34,653
<i>Actually, we're looking for Susan Baker,</i>

362
00:25:34,654 --> 00:25:35,772
<i>I was told she lived here.</i>

363
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:37,245
Again, sorry.

364
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,717
Susan doesn't do public readings.

365
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:39,996
She knows me.

366
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,245
My name is Sharice Henderson.

367
00:25:41,246 --> 00:25:42,779
I was a research assistant on a parapsy

368
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,692
Unless you have an appointment
I can't help you.

369
00:25:45,693 --> 00:25:46,652
<i>How is Emmanuel,</i>

370
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:50,748
has he had any luck in finding
the genetic component yet?

371
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,572
<i>He's got some leads.</i>

372
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:54,237
<i>What?</i>

373
00:25:54,238 --> 00:25:55,901
<i>You know him?</i>

374
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:58,843
Susan and I participated in the study.

375
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:03,388
Oh, so any chance we could get
a sitting with her tonight?

376
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:05,149
I'll tell you what?

377
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,261
I could make it happen
for a 500 dollar donation.

378
00:26:07,262 --> 00:26:09,149
What?

379
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,772
Connecting as deeply as Susan does

380
00:26:11,773 --> 00:26:14,141
requires days to recover from.

381
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:15,931
People come from all over the world paying

382
00:26:15,932 --> 00:26:21,052
two, three thousand dollars
just to sit in a room with her.

383
00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:23,419
Thanks anyway.

384
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,866
Um, I'll pay.

385
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:31,579
I mean, assuming that it will
work for someone who's deaf.

386
00:26:35,388 --> 00:26:37,052
Oh, it will work Missy,

387
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,875
you don't need your ears to hear a spirit

388
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:44,196
any more than you need eyes to see one.

389
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:54,748
Place your fingers on the phonograph arm

390
00:26:54,749 --> 00:26:56,870
as you would with a Ouija board planchette.

391
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:06,588
Your sister will communicate
to you through this device.

392
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:11,644
We will hear the recording,
but you will hear her voice.

393
00:27:11,645 --> 00:27:12,604
What is her name?

394
00:27:13,372 --> 00:27:15,163
<i>Michelle Murrow.</i>

395
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:17,403
And your parents?

396
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:18,970
<i>Our mother's name was Collette.</i>

397
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:30,172
I invite the spirit of Michelle Murrow,

398
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:33,836
sister of Lily, daughter of Collette.

399
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:55,387
I invite the spirit of Michelle Murrow,

400
00:27:55,388 --> 00:27:59,932
sister of Lily, daughter of Collette.

401
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,591
<i>Lily.</i>

402
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:19,483
Was that her? Was that her voice?

403
00:28:19,484 --> 00:28:22,364
Michelle is with us now.

404
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,063
You may speak to her directly.

405
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,475
Michelle, can you hear me?

406
00:28:28,476 --> 00:28:30,205
<i>I can hear and see you.</i>

407
00:28:37,597 --> 00:28:38,844
Where are you?

408
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:40,891
Who's with you?

409
00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:43,199
<i>I'm with mom now.</i>

410
00:28:46,076 --> 00:28:48,092
Michelle, I want to tell you..

411
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,708
<i>Where's the tower necklace Lily,</i>

412
00:28:50,235 --> 00:28:53,211
<i>you should wear it to remember me?</i>

413
00:28:53,212 --> 00:28:54,828
It's back at home, I can find it.

414
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,075
Michelle, can you hear me?

415
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:07,291
<i>Lily.</i>

416
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:08,379
<i>Lily.</i>

417
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,932
A different presence is with us now.

418
00:29:18,075 --> 00:29:20,027
<i>You must go.</i>

419
00:29:20,028 --> 00:29:21,290
<i>You are not welcome here.</i>

420
00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:23,738
<i>Leave us ghost.</i>

421
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:27,771
We intend to speak only to
the spirit of Michelle Murrow.

422
00:29:27,772 --> 00:29:29,978
<i>Leave us ghost, you are not welcome here.</i>

423
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:31,483
<i>Leave us.</i>

424
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,667
<i>Lily.</i>

425
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:46,714
<i>Lily.</i>

426
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:47,580
You okay?

427
00:29:47,772 --> 00:29:49,914
What happened?

428
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:51,195
You fell out of your chair.

429
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:52,794
Will you take me home?

430
00:29:52,795 --> 00:29:53,915
Yeah, of course.

431
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:56,220
Come on.

432
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,034
Please, wait a minute.

433
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:00,859
A ghost has manifested itself to her

434
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,267
and she's going to need guidance.

435
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:03,290
For what, 500 bucks more,

436
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:05,738
fuck you dude, I'm out of here.

437
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:21,785
You okay?

438
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,387
I'm fine.

439
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,347
I'm fine.

440
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:26,523
Okay.

441
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:27,449
You sure?

442
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,881
Yep.

443
00:30:29,882 --> 00:30:32,409
I'll see you later?

444
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,442
Yes ma'am.

445
00:33:27,577 --> 00:33:28,505
Hello.

446
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,976
<i>Mommy, I miss you.</i>

447
00:33:29,977 --> 00:33:30,905
Mommy misses you too.

448
00:33:30,906 --> 00:33:32,314
<i>Eww.</i>

449
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:34,169
<i>I'll be home soon and we can
watch cartoons okay?</i>

450
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,546
<i>Cartoons.</i>

451
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,368
<i>Okay mommy, see you soon.</i>

452
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:39,928
Okay, put your daddy on the phone.

453
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:40,888
<i>Daddy.</i>

454
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,257
<i>Gabby?</i>

455
00:33:43,258 --> 00:33:45,945
Listen, I was gonna stop by
the grocery store after my run,

456
00:33:45,946 --> 00:33:46,904
do you need anything?

457
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:47,832
<i>I'm good.</i>

458
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,144
Okay, alright.

459
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:50,297
I'll be home in about an hour.

460
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:52,216
<i>I'll be here.</i> Okay, I love you.

461
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:53,688
<i>Love you too.</i> Bye.

462
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:56,443
<i>Very pretty Gabriella.</i>

463
00:33:58,361 --> 00:34:01,753
<i>I bet all the other girls are envious.</i>

464
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:03,384
<i>That's not me.</i>

465
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:04,761
<i>Hey, I'm over here,</i>

466
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:07,032
<i>I've been watching you for weeks now.</i>

467
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:08,347
<i>Not now.</i>

468
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:12,637
<i>In the tress.</i>

469
00:34:49,402 --> 00:34:50,680
<i>Morning.</i>

470
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:52,475
<i>Morning.</i>

471
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:56,377
You don't mind do you?

472
00:34:56,569 --> 00:34:59,265
It helps with my glaucoma.

473
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,912
It doesn't hurt my arthritis either.

474
00:35:09,913 --> 00:35:11,224
Want some?

475
00:35:11,225 --> 00:35:12,184
Sure.

476
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:21,688
Thank you.

477
00:35:25,977 --> 00:35:28,023
Have you ever visited
the spiritualist community

478
00:35:28,024 --> 00:35:29,911
on the edge of town?

479
00:35:29,912 --> 00:35:31,416
<i>Well, I've been there,</i>

480
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:36,024
but I've never participated in a séance.

481
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:37,176
Is that because you've
never felt inclined to,

482
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:40,953
or because you don't believe in them?

483
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:43,416
I think there are places in the world

484
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:46,231
that amplify certain realities

485
00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:49,944
like mountains and revelations

486
00:35:49,945 --> 00:35:53,179
or Bermuda Triangle and chaos.

487
00:35:55,097 --> 00:35:57,178
I think Cassadaga's one of those places.

488
00:35:59,096 --> 00:36:02,039
So I wouldn't go there looking for answers.

489
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,416
<i>I think I, I would try to
find clarity through my work.</i>

490
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:11,864
Pain and suffering are tools
at an artist's disposal,

491
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:15,004
just as much as canvas and paint.

492
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,904
So, maybe it's time you start painting

493
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:25,821
what you feel instead
of painting not to feel.

494
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:33,143
And don't tell Thomas you saw me smoking,
okay?

495
00:36:33,144 --> 00:36:34,584
Oh.

496
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:36,414
He's paranoid about those things.

497
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,606
<i>It is said that art is man's way</i>

498
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:49,335
<i>of expressing himself by
showing us how he sees things.</i>

499
00:36:49,336 --> 00:36:52,983
<i>Sometimes he shows us instead how he feels.</i>

500
00:36:52,984 --> 00:36:54,903
<i>What's in his heart,</i>

501
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:57,847
<i>what may be in the darkest places,</i>

502
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,462
<i>which brings us to Caravaggio.</i>

503
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:03,926
<i>His theatrical use of contrast</i>

504
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:07,158
<i>had a profound influence
on the emerging Baroque style</i>

505
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,494
<i>of the time and in particular of this work,</i>

506
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:10,840
<i>titled sleeping cupid,</i>

507
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,264
Caravaggio employs his signature
style of lighting,

508
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,470
of stark contrast between the light

509
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:19,511
<i>and the dark with almost
no intermediate value.</i>

510
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:23,672
<i>Commissioned in 1608
for Frau Francesco Delata,</i>

511
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:26,583
<i>the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta,</i>

512
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:31,382
<i>the subject is a sleeping cupid
lying alongside his arrows.</i>

513
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:34,428
<i>Background shadows are profoundly</i>

514
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,295
<i>Yes, Lily.</i>

515
00:38:14,296 --> 00:38:15,479
<i>Lily.</i>

516
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,590
<i>Lily, are you alright?</i>

517
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:18,744
<i>Lily.</i>

518
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:45,333
Hi.

519
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:47,478
<i>Your professor called me,
told me what happened.</i>

520
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:49,302
<i>How you holding up?</i>

521
00:38:49,303 --> 00:38:51,286
I'm sorry about that.

522
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,262
<i>He insisted I call somebody,
and I didn't have anybody else.</i>

523
00:38:54,263 --> 00:38:55,989
No problem. I got it.

524
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,334
I just finished my shift.

525
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,573
I was on my way home.

526
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:03,317
Hey,
you probably think I'm a huge nut job now.

527
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:04,533
Of course not.

528
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:05,493
Of course not.

529
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:08,247
But I did buy you something online.

530
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:13,751
Sort of a con man instruction manual.

531
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,766
You know, details all the things
needed to create the illusion

532
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,621
of contacting the dead,

533
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,541
you know, thumping tables, gusts of wind,

534
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:22,517
wayward spirits, cutting the séance short.

535
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:23,642
It's all in there.

536
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,997
There is more going
on there than you saw Mike.

537
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:34,102
I heard her.

538
00:39:34,103 --> 00:39:36,534
I mean, not, not with my ears, in my mind.

539
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:39,382
I saw things too, I'm still seeing things.

540
00:39:39,383 --> 00:39:41,526
Look, let me take you
to my doctor, alright?

541
00:39:41,527 --> 00:39:43,850
I have,
I have Hailey for a couple hours today.

542
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:45,847
I promised her I'd get her a pumpkin.

543
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:47,574
There's an awesome
pumpkin patch down the road,

544
00:39:47,575 --> 00:39:49,622
let's go have some fun.

545
00:39:49,623 --> 00:39:50,582
Alright?

546
00:39:50,774 --> 00:39:52,215
I don't want to intrude on your time.

547
00:39:52,216 --> 00:39:53,750
You're not gonna intrude on us,
she loves you.

548
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:54,869
Come on.

549
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,957
Come on, you gotta get out of your head.

550
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:56,950
Come on, yeah?

551
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:57,910
Yeah. Yeah. To fun.

552
00:39:58,583 --> 00:39:59,701
To fun.

553
00:39:59,702 --> 00:40:01,355
We're having fun.

554
00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:24,118
Yeah, that one.

555
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,302
<i>It's my mom's place.</i>

556
00:40:25,303 --> 00:40:26,869
My, my lawyer suggested
that I move back here

557
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,862
for a little while, you know,

558
00:40:27,863 --> 00:40:29,110
just to give Hailey some normal hours

559
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:30,101
while I'm working night shifts.

560
00:40:30,102 --> 00:40:31,670
<i>Yeah.</i>

561
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:32,822
<i>Makes sense to be surrounded by yourself</i>

562
00:40:32,823 --> 00:40:35,316
<i>with female hair cuts as a child.</i>

563
00:40:35,317 --> 00:40:36,533
I'm gonna go upstairs,
grab some things real quick,

564
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,525
you want something to drink?

565
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:38,485
- I'm good.
- No. No.

566
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,117
Alright. Thank you.

567
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:43,477
<i>It had bruises on the side,
but besides that, perfect.</i>

568
00:40:43,478 --> 00:40:46,518
<i>It looks perfect and sometimes
that stuff makes it even better.</i>

569
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:47,925
<i>Yep.</i>

570
00:40:47,926 --> 00:40:50,102
<i>I'm going to carve it
into a jack o lantern.</i>

571
00:40:50,103 --> 00:40:51,701
<i>What kind of jack o lantern?</i>

572
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:53,621
<i>Well, he's gonna have two eyes,</i>

573
00:40:53,622 --> 00:40:56,596
<i>triangular nose, and a mouth</i>

574
00:40:56,597 --> 00:40:58,485
<i>and I think I'm gonna
add some teeth to his mouth.</i>

575
00:40:58,486 --> 00:41:00,437
<i>Are you hungry after working?</i>

576
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,901
<i>So my dad taught me the game when I was,</i>

577
00:41:02,902 --> 00:41:05,333
I don't know, five, maybe six.

578
00:41:05,334 --> 00:41:07,221
He was a tough guy.

579
00:41:07,222 --> 00:41:08,820
He had a hard life, you know,

580
00:41:08,821 --> 00:41:11,190
he worked two maybe three jobs, sometimes.

581
00:41:11,191 --> 00:41:12,886
But it didn't matter.

582
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,244
Every time he was in those
stands watching me play ball.

583
00:41:16,245 --> 00:41:19,284
He was nothing but smiles.

584
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:21,753
How did you get the nickname Locomotive?

585
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:28,244
It's actually Loco motive,
like crazy train, you know.

586
00:41:28,245 --> 00:41:31,445
It was the high school state championships.

587
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:35,029
I was this really skinny
little sophomore kid, right?

588
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,869
Trying to stretch a triple into a homerun.

589
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,981
Ball gets to the catcher first.

590
00:41:40,982 --> 00:41:43,414
He's this big old beefy
Southern Boy, right?

591
00:41:43,415 --> 00:41:45,300
I'm like screw it, I'm gonna go for it.

592
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:48,917
I throw down my shoulder,
boom, plow right into him.

593
00:41:48,918 --> 00:41:50,902
Knocks me out cold.

594
00:41:50,903 --> 00:41:53,845
So, one of my teammates
starts calling me locomotive

595
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:55,860
and it just, you know, it stuck.

596
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:57,880
Stupid name.

597
00:41:59,798 --> 00:42:05,172
That's kind of,
kind of who I am though, I guess.

598
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:06,517
Yeah.

599
00:42:06,518 --> 00:42:10,996
I have, I have this tendency
to just throw on these blinders

600
00:42:10,997 --> 00:42:16,598
and focus on achieving
one goal at all costs.

601
00:42:17,557 --> 00:42:19,252
Doesn't fucking matter.

602
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:21,496
I'm gonna get it, you know.

603
00:42:23,414 --> 00:42:25,748
That's what happened with my family.

604
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:29,013
I was so determined to make the majors,

605
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:30,453
you know, go all the way.

606
00:42:30,454 --> 00:42:31,639
Be a big star.

607
00:42:33,557 --> 00:42:35,513
I put everything else on hold.

608
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:43,412
I know, it's crazy, I,
I wake up one morning

609
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:46,228
and, I'm in my mid twenties,

610
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:49,908
I'm divorced,

611
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:51,626
my wife has custody of my daughter,

612
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:56,500
you know, that's when I,

613
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:57,525
that's when I realized it's time

614
00:42:57,526 --> 00:43:00,501
to step off the crazy train, you know?

615
00:43:00,502 --> 00:43:04,917
So I moved back here, got this EMT gig,

616
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:09,205
and jump started the process

617
00:43:09,206 --> 00:43:12,563
of getting Hailey back in my life.

618
00:43:12,564 --> 00:43:13,751
Hmmm.

619
00:43:15,669 --> 00:43:18,005
I'm sorry.

620
00:43:18,006 --> 00:43:19,957
What?

621
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:23,027
Here I am, I'm fucking going
on and on about Hailey again.

622
00:43:23,028 --> 00:43:24,532
No.

623
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:26,419
I promise you,
that's not the only thing I talk about.

624
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,436
I like it.

625
00:43:28,437 --> 00:43:30,486
It's endearing.

626
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:33,365
Shows you're, you're a really good father.

627
00:43:33,366 --> 00:43:35,955
I can see that.

628
00:43:35,956 --> 00:43:37,399
Trying.

629
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:42,050
Trying my hardest, you know.

630
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:16,241
God.

631
00:47:16,242 --> 00:47:18,390
Oh my God.

632
00:47:23,315 --> 00:47:24,851
Oh my God.

633
00:47:24,852 --> 00:47:26,739
What are you doing.

634
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,177
What are you doing?

635
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,522
What are you doing?

636
00:47:29,523 --> 00:47:31,378
Ow.

637
00:47:31,379 --> 00:47:33,012
You're sick.

638
00:47:47,347 --> 00:47:50,010
Shhhhh.

639
00:47:57,682 --> 00:48:00,902
What have you done to yourself?

640
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:58,865
Good morning.

641
00:48:58,866 --> 00:48:59,857
Morning.

642
00:48:59,858 --> 00:49:03,057
Some tea?

643
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:05,107
How you feeling?

644
00:49:06,066 --> 00:49:07,600
Better.

645
00:49:07,601 --> 00:49:09,425
Safe.

646
00:49:09,426 --> 00:49:10,932
Good.

647
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:17,905
All you needed was some rest,
and a little distraction.

648
00:49:17,906 --> 00:49:19,858
Is that what you call that?

649
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:21,077
A little distraction.

650
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:26,738
Hey, I had an amazing time,

651
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:30,992
and you are, never mind.

652
00:49:30,993 --> 00:49:32,082
What?

653
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:34,321
What?

654
00:49:34,322 --> 00:49:35,569
I gotta go.

655
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:36,881
I gotta go.

656
00:49:36,882 --> 00:49:40,017
I have my, my first custody hearing

657
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:42,609
with the judge today.

658
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:46,193
But, I do have a couple
hours before I go to work,

659
00:49:46,194 --> 00:49:48,081
if you don't mind me coming back.

660
00:49:48,082 --> 00:49:49,040
Hm uh.

661
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:50,577
Yeah. Yes.

662
00:49:50,578 --> 00:49:52,050
Yes.

663
00:49:52,051 --> 00:49:53,137
I'd like that.

664
00:49:53,138 --> 00:49:55,216
Okay.

665
00:49:55,217 --> 00:49:56,276
Alright.

666
00:49:58,194 --> 00:49:59,989
Get some rest, yeah?

667
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,977
Get lots of rest.

668
00:50:04,978 --> 00:50:06,289
<i>Alright, I'll see you in a few hours.</i>

669
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,670
Okay.

670
00:51:27,986 --> 00:51:28,945
Oh.

671
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,704
Oh, hey.

672
00:51:30,705 --> 00:51:32,207
Sorry.

673
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:33,168
I didn't.

674
00:51:33,169 --> 00:51:34,127
Oh.

675
00:51:34,128 --> 00:51:35,217
I didn't mean to startle you,

676
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:38,575
well, I just, I honked when I drove up,

677
00:51:38,576 --> 00:51:39,920
but I guess you didn't hear me.

678
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:41,585
Oh, I'm deaf.

679
00:51:41,586 --> 00:51:43,471
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

680
00:51:43,472 --> 00:51:44,432
It's okay.

681
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:45,777
I read lips.

682
00:51:45,778 --> 00:51:47,727
Well, Christian Burton.

683
00:51:47,728 --> 00:51:51,824
I'm the, I'm the contractor that built
the green house for Mrs. Andersen.

684
00:51:51,825 --> 00:51:54,928
I was just,
just here checking her for storm damage.

685
00:51:54,929 --> 00:51:57,839
<i>So you, you a relative, or what?</i>

686
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,120
I'm sorry.

687
00:51:59,121 --> 00:52:00,529
I'm Lily.

688
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,549
I'm a student staying at the guest house.

689
00:52:03,986 --> 00:52:06,128
So they're giving the promise award again,
huh?

690
00:52:06,129 --> 00:52:07,409
Yeah, the merit award.

691
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:09,104
<i>Yeah, it used to be
called the promise award,</i>

692
00:52:09,105 --> 00:52:12,337
<i>but then, anyway, um,
can you tell Mrs. Andersen</i>

693
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,920
<i>that I, I inspected the green
house as best I could.</i>

694
00:52:15,921 --> 00:52:18,255
<i>She wants me to come back
and check the locked areas,</i>

695
00:52:18,256 --> 00:52:19,311
<i>just give me a call.</i>

696
00:52:19,312 --> 00:52:20,272
Yeah, okay.

697
00:52:20,273 --> 00:52:22,193
<i>Okay.</i>

698
00:52:55,728 --> 00:52:56,793
Oh my God.

699
00:54:09,007 --> 00:54:10,962
Hey.

700
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,214
Hey.

701
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:17,199
I saw the milk.

702
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,535
It was just milk.

703
00:54:19,536 --> 00:54:20,718
No, no it wasn't.

704
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:22,575
It wasn't just milk.

705
00:54:22,576 --> 00:54:24,495
Okay, so what?

706
00:54:24,496 --> 00:54:27,663
You walked to the refrigerator,
and there she was.

707
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,040
Yeah.

708
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:30,063
Yeah.

709
00:54:30,064 --> 00:54:31,726
Come on Lily, are you,

710
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,710
are you sure that you didn't
just fucking dream this,

711
00:54:33,711 --> 00:54:35,183
that you fell off the counter.

712
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:36,367
You, you hurt yourself?

713
00:54:36,368 --> 00:54:37,583
How could a fall from
the counter do this to me?

714
00:54:37,584 --> 00:54:39,955
I don't know.

715
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:45,071
Hey.

716
00:54:45,072 --> 00:54:46,542
Hey.

717
00:54:46,543 --> 00:54:48,879
You know that this mediation process

718
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,735
is part of the custody battle, right?

719
00:54:50,736 --> 00:54:52,302
Right?

720
00:54:52,303 --> 00:54:54,479
It's not a path,
it's not a means of reconciliation.

721
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,567
It's nothing like that.

722
00:54:55,568 --> 00:54:56,879
You think that I'm making this up?

723
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,903
No.

724
00:54:57,904 --> 00:54:58,990
You think that I'm just doing this to

725
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:00,111
I don't fucking know.

726
00:55:00,112 --> 00:55:01,231
Look, I don't know.

727
00:55:01,232 --> 00:55:02,382
Alright.
But if you rule out the supernatural,

728
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:05,007
it's kind of fucking hard to believe.

729
00:55:05,008 --> 00:55:07,439
Mike, this is real. Okay?

730
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,671
This is the girl I have seen
getting inside of my head.

731
00:55:10,672 --> 00:55:11,599
Okay?

732
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,071
She used to live in this house.

733
00:55:13,072 --> 00:55:14,735
She used to sleep in that bed.

734
00:55:14,736 --> 00:55:15,695
And now she's.

735
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:19,886
Hey.

736
00:55:19,887 --> 00:55:21,231
Are you okay?

737
00:55:21,232 --> 00:55:22,638
Here, here.

738
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:24,243
Oh my God.

739
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,241
I told you.

740
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:32,655
Oh my God.

741
00:55:39,504 --> 00:55:43,118
<i>Yeah, the girl from the séance.</i>

742
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,806
I know it seems self inflicted,
that's what I thought.

743
00:55:45,807 --> 00:55:47,182
But you know what?

744
00:55:47,183 --> 00:55:48,525
I just saw this girl hack up

745
00:55:48,526 --> 00:55:50,094
a handful of bloody fucking maggots,

746
00:55:50,095 --> 00:55:52,751
now if that's not real, what is?

747
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:55,054
So you gonna help me or what?

748
00:55:55,055 --> 00:55:56,014
Thank you.

749
00:55:57,903 --> 00:55:59,150
Alright.

750
00:55:59,151 --> 00:56:00,400
It's set, Theresa's gonna cover my shift.

751
00:56:00,592 --> 00:56:02,382
My buddy Todd said that you can
use his place in Daytona,

752
00:56:02,383 --> 00:56:03,789
it's just temporary till we can figure out

753
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:04,782
some better arrangements,

754
00:56:04,783 --> 00:56:06,126
but it's better than this shit, alright?

755
00:56:06,127 --> 00:56:07,598
Uh huh.

756
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,555
We're gonna figure this out.

757
00:57:03,903 --> 00:57:05,518
We're closed, come back tomorrow.

758
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:08,429
We need to talk to Susan.

759
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:09,774
Remember we had a séance
the other day alright,

760
00:57:09,775 --> 00:57:11,088
it went sideways. I recall.

761
00:57:11,279 --> 00:57:13,229
And I also recall offering you guidance,

762
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,350
guidance which you declined.

763
00:57:14,415 --> 00:57:15,566
We're not declining it now.

764
00:57:15,567 --> 00:57:17,358
Nevertheless,
Susan is retired for the evening

765
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,478
come back in the morning

766
00:57:18,479 --> 00:57:19,437
and we'll discuss her availability.

767
00:57:19,438 --> 00:57:20,846
Listen to me you mother fucker.

768
00:57:20,847 --> 00:57:21,838
<i>We need help.</i>

769
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,149
Alright.

770
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,941
This girl's getting fucking attacked here,

771
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,574
and we're not gonna leave until somebody

772
00:57:26,575 --> 00:57:28,526
undoes whatever the fuck
it is they did to her,

773
00:57:28,527 --> 00:57:30,479
you got that?

774
00:57:31,438 --> 00:57:33,934
Just step away from Mr. Banks,

775
00:57:33,935 --> 00:57:36,695
huh,
or I'll use this blade and drag you away.

776
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,953
<i>Heath, let him go.</i>

777
00:57:41,871 --> 00:57:43,888
I'm still in my chair.

778
00:57:46,766 --> 00:57:48,690
I want to help.

779
00:57:52,527 --> 00:57:54,989
Once a vengeful ghost connects to you,

780
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,164
it will not relent until you do

781
00:57:57,165 --> 00:57:59,918
whatever it is it wants from you.

782
00:57:59,919 --> 00:58:02,893
The attack in the car,

783
00:58:02,894 --> 00:58:05,901
that was her way of
keeping you from leaving.

784
00:58:05,902 --> 00:58:09,517
<i>And if you tried it again,
you get the same result.</i>

785
00:58:09,518 --> 00:58:12,846
<i>Whatever it is she wants you to do,</i>

786
00:58:12,847 --> 00:58:15,052
it is right here in Cassadaga.

787
00:58:15,053 --> 00:58:15,885
Well, then we should contact her again

788
00:58:15,886 --> 00:58:17,869
and ask her what she wants.

789
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,373
The only thing another séance will do

790
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:21,164
is bring about another attack.

791
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,596
Ghosts are not the beings of free will

792
00:58:23,597 --> 00:58:25,325
the way spirits are.

793
00:58:25,326 --> 00:58:28,686
The consequences of refusing to cross over

794
00:58:28,687 --> 00:58:31,788
is entrapped in one tragic moment.

795
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:34,252
<i>All other memory is lost.</i>

796
00:58:34,253 --> 00:58:36,076
<i>Ghosts cannot read, they cannot write,</i>

797
00:58:36,077 --> 00:58:37,996
<i>they cannot speak.</i>

798
00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:42,348
Those images are our
only means of communication.

799
00:58:42,349 --> 00:58:44,237
They're carefully chosen fragments

800
00:58:44,238 --> 00:58:46,156
of her final memories meant to lead you

801
00:58:46,477 --> 00:58:49,612
to do whatever she wants you to do.

802
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:51,181
They don't mean anything.

803
00:58:51,182 --> 00:58:53,165
These are just random unconnected images.

804
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:55,244
They mean something.

805
00:58:55,245 --> 00:58:56,941
Somehow, some way,

806
00:58:56,942 --> 00:59:00,079
those images tell you everything
that you need to know.

807
00:59:08,813 --> 00:59:11,053
<i>Gotta get low.</i>

808
00:59:11,054 --> 00:59:13,103
<i>Get low.</i>

809
00:59:14,062 --> 00:59:16,621
They come under man.

810
00:59:16,622 --> 00:59:18,988
If it isn't the loco Motive himself.

811
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:19,980
What's up man?

812
00:59:19,981 --> 00:59:20,909
How you doing Mike?

813
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,796
Not too bad, how you doing?

814
00:59:22,797 --> 00:59:23,758
Doing good man.

815
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:32,813
What's up man,
I see you not wearing your cleats.

816
00:59:32,814 --> 00:59:35,596
So I'm assuming you're not
here to join the police team.

817
00:59:35,597 --> 00:59:38,156
No sir.

818
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,404
Just got a couple questions for you man,

819
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:41,740
regarding that, that Eastman case.

820
00:59:41,741 --> 00:59:43,277
Remember that girl that went
missing a couple years ago?

821
00:59:43,278 --> 00:59:45,197
Yeah, what about it?

822
00:59:45,198 --> 00:59:47,822
What are the chances I can
get my hands on that file?

823
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:50,349
Hi. Hi.

824
00:59:50,413 --> 00:59:51,917
How's it coming?

825
00:59:51,918 --> 00:59:53,553
It's getting there.

826
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,836
Are you finding anything?

827
00:59:57,837 --> 00:59:59,788
A pattern or something?

828
00:59:59,789 --> 01:00:01,997
No, not yet.

829
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:03,244
<i>Tell you what.</i>

830
01:00:03,245 --> 01:00:04,491
You want that file,

831
01:00:04,492 --> 01:00:06,829
see if you still got it, let's go.

832
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,621
See if I still got it, alright.

833
01:00:08,622 --> 01:00:09,612
Here we go.

834
01:00:09,613 --> 01:00:12,365
Let's do this.

835
01:00:12,366 --> 01:00:14,765
Wooo.

836
01:00:14,766 --> 01:00:16,524
You said that Thomas is taking Mrs.
Andersen

837
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:18,348
<i>to a doctor's appointment tomorrow, right?</i>

838
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:20,107
<i>How long they usually gone for?</i>

839
01:00:20,108 --> 01:00:22,987
About an hour, sometimes less, why?

840
01:00:22,988 --> 01:00:24,812
Doesn't give us much time, come here.

841
01:00:24,813 --> 01:00:25,740
Officer Hall.

842
01:00:25,741 --> 01:00:27,404
What's up man? How are you?

843
01:00:27,405 --> 01:00:28,525
You come across some new information,

844
01:00:28,526 --> 01:00:29,485
come to me first.

845
01:00:31,726 --> 01:00:34,251
Her IM records indicate that
she finished a conversation

846
01:00:34,252 --> 01:00:37,356
with her friend around 7:15
so she could go on this job

847
01:00:37,357 --> 01:00:39,948
<i>with the dog right?</i>

848
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:42,061
<i>She would do three trips
around the work out station</i>

849
01:00:42,062 --> 01:00:43,659
<i>and she would job back home.</i>

850
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,091
<i>They ever suspect that family
she was living with?</i>

851
01:00:46,092 --> 01:00:48,652
<i>Sure, I mean, standard procedure
makes them persons of interest.</i>

852
01:00:48,653 --> 01:00:52,043
<i>But, as expected,
they pressured their connections</i>

853
01:00:52,044 --> 01:00:53,644
<i>to expedite the investigation.</i>

854
01:00:53,645 --> 01:00:55,787
Connections, to who?

855
01:00:55,788 --> 01:00:57,163
He watched her.

856
01:00:57,164 --> 01:00:59,148
He watched her from those woods.

857
01:00:59,149 --> 01:01:01,228
<i>He trailed her once or twice,</i>

858
01:01:01,229 --> 01:01:03,854
<i>and then he just waited
for that perfect opportunity.</i>

859
01:01:05,997 --> 01:01:09,420
Hey, Jennifer, how's it going?

860
01:01:11,244 --> 01:01:13,132
Without a body, without a motive,

861
01:01:13,133 --> 01:01:14,252
there's nothing to contradict

862
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:17,324
a voluntary disappearance classification.

863
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:19,213
Alright, it's what I'm saying.

864
01:01:19,214 --> 01:01:20,717
So you give me a couple of days?

865
01:01:20,909 --> 01:01:22,411
Yeah.

866
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:23,691
They say that lock picking takes time,

867
01:01:23,692 --> 01:01:26,060
or skill, not both.

868
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:27,915
So we're gonna sit here

869
01:01:27,916 --> 01:01:30,036
and we're gonna do it till we get it right.

870
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,992
Fuck.

871
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:50,188
Okay.

872
01:03:54,188 --> 01:03:56,257
<i>You want me to pick, that's what I picked.</i>

873
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:11,050
<i>Oh my God.</i>

874
01:04:11,051 --> 01:04:13,931
<i>Am I in a mental institution or something?</i>

875
01:04:17,388 --> 01:04:19,340
Shit.

876
01:04:23,532 --> 01:04:26,830
<i>Let's just have bread and water.</i>

877
01:05:33,004 --> 01:05:34,988
<i>What happened?</i>

878
01:05:35,947 --> 01:05:37,389
Must have thrown a breaker.

879
01:05:40,266 --> 01:05:42,363
I'll take a look.

880
01:06:30,314 --> 01:06:32,557
There they are.

881
01:06:35,434 --> 01:06:37,769
<i>What a fucking pervert.</i>

882
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:38,729
There's more.

883
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:49,963
<i>He has her doing everything.</i>

884
01:06:51,881 --> 01:06:53,677
Oh my.

885
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,246
Fuck me.

886
01:07:02,123 --> 01:07:04,394
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

887
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,218
<i>No, I know. I'm on my way.</i>

888
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:07,978
No, I got a last minute dementia patient

889
01:07:07,979 --> 01:07:10,473
in my shift it took forever to wrap up.

890
01:07:10,474 --> 01:07:11,433
I know that Janel.

891
01:07:11,434 --> 01:07:12,744
I'm 15 minutes out. Alright.

892
01:07:12,745 --> 01:07:14,505
I'll apologize to the teacher
when I get there.

893
01:07:14,506 --> 01:07:17,769
I'm gonna be there. Alright.

894
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:19,145
Fucking Christ.

895
01:07:19,146 --> 01:07:20,169
Hey. I gotta get out of here.

896
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,897
Um, I have a parent teacher meeting

897
01:07:21,898 --> 01:07:23,272
that I completely fucking forgot about.

898
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:24,553
Okay. Alright.

899
01:07:24,554 --> 01:07:25,545
You alright?

900
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:27,562
<i>Yeah.</i>

901
01:08:36,233 --> 01:08:38,984
<i>What's next?</i>

902
01:08:38,985 --> 01:08:41,288
<i>What did I tell you about dressing up?</i>

903
01:08:41,289 --> 01:08:42,856
<i>What did I tell you about dressing,</i>

904
01:08:42,857 --> 01:08:44,904
<i>what did I tell you about dressing up?</i>

905
01:08:44,905 --> 01:08:46,728
What did I tell you about dressing up?

906
01:08:46,729 --> 01:08:48,585
What did I tell you about dressing up?

907
01:08:48,777 --> 01:08:52,873
Please, kill me.

908
01:08:52,874 --> 01:08:54,601
Please.

909
01:08:54,602 --> 01:08:56,653
Please.

910
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:04,009
Please kill me.

911
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:27,272
You're the prettiest girl in town.

912
01:09:27,273 --> 01:09:30,151
You're the prettiest girl in town.

913
01:09:30,152 --> 01:09:33,672
You're the prettiest girl in town.

914
01:10:12,072 --> 01:10:15,016
<i>Watch your finger.</i>

915
01:10:15,017 --> 01:10:17,032
<i>Always cut away from yourself.</i>

916
01:10:17,033 --> 01:10:18,215
<i>This way?</i>

917
01:10:18,216 --> 01:10:20,872
<i>Oh, watch my finger.</i>

918
01:10:20,873 --> 01:10:22,119
<i>There you go.</i>

919
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,079
<i>Boom.</i>

920
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,168
<i>Yum.</i>

921
01:10:24,169 --> 01:10:26,183
That's gross.

922
01:10:26,184 --> 01:10:28,457
Lily?

923
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:32,264
You want to see Bruce?

924
01:10:32,265 --> 01:10:35,910
I have an idea,
why don't you go in and show Mamaw first?

925
01:10:35,911 --> 01:10:37,544
She should really be the
first one to see it.

926
01:10:37,545 --> 01:10:39,112
Don't you think?

927
01:10:39,113 --> 01:10:40,232
Yeah.

928
01:10:40,233 --> 01:10:41,192
Okay.

929
01:10:51,721 --> 01:10:54,088
Sorry.

930
01:10:54,089 --> 01:10:57,671
Look, it's been four years.

931
01:10:57,672 --> 01:10:59,527
He's dropped his guard.

932
01:10:59,528 --> 01:11:01,098
He has to have.

933
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:05,767
He's left himself exposed.

934
01:11:05,768 --> 01:11:10,088
Someplace that he goes to,
somewhere in that house,

935
01:11:10,089 --> 01:11:11,016
that's the next piece of information

936
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:14,503
we need to find this body.

937
01:11:14,504 --> 01:11:16,264
Oh.

938
01:11:16,265 --> 01:11:18,506
After all your hard work, are you okay?

939
01:11:30,736 --> 01:11:32,553
Get her away, don't let her see this.

940
01:11:32,745 --> 01:11:35,535
Aw, come on.

941
01:11:42,249 --> 01:11:43,818
Don't move.

942
01:11:45,736 --> 01:11:48,071
Lily, open the door.

943
01:11:48,072 --> 01:11:49,768
Please go, please leave me alone.

944
01:11:49,769 --> 01:11:50,791
Please.

945
01:11:50,792 --> 01:11:52,008
Lily.

946
01:12:12,743 --> 01:12:13,702
Lily.

947
01:12:27,655 --> 01:12:29,670
Come here.

948
01:12:29,671 --> 01:12:31,815
Come here.

949
01:13:10,696 --> 01:13:12,618
Come in.

950
01:13:16,455 --> 01:13:19,021
I just want to talk to you for a minute.

951
01:13:24,593 --> 01:13:26,310
My ex-wife filed an emergency order

952
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:29,574
with the family court today.

953
01:13:29,575 --> 01:13:31,045
She claims that my relationship with you

954
01:13:31,046 --> 01:13:32,748
is detrimental to Hailey's safety.

955
01:13:36,584 --> 01:13:39,559
<i>She says that she has an expert witness</i>

956
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,894
who's willing to testify that your episodes

957
01:13:41,895 --> 01:13:43,525
were nothing but a violent
form of schizophrenia.

958
01:13:43,526 --> 01:13:45,189
You know that's not true.

959
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:46,854
You know that's not true at all.

960
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:49,702
My lawyer thinks that
I shouldn't see you anymore.

961
01:13:49,703 --> 01:13:50,713
Your lawyer, or you?

962
01:13:53,063 --> 01:13:54,217
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

963
01:13:55,857 --> 01:13:57,221
Well, we can figure it out.

964
01:13:57,222 --> 01:13:58,470
Hailey has to be my number one priority,

965
01:13:58,471 --> 01:13:59,462
I'm so sorry.

966
01:13:59,463 --> 01:14:00,805
I, I know.

967
01:14:00,806 --> 01:14:01,917
I don't have a choice.

968
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,702
You, Mike.

969
01:14:05,703 --> 01:14:09,765
Just, we can, we can work,
we can figure something out.

970
01:14:09,766 --> 01:14:11,209
I need you.

971
01:14:43,782 --> 01:14:45,926
Why?

972
01:14:45,927 --> 01:14:48,485
Why me?

973
01:14:48,486 --> 01:14:49,637
Why the fuck me.

974
01:14:49,638 --> 01:14:52,293
Leave me the fuck alone.

975
01:14:52,294 --> 01:14:55,110
Why are you doing this to me?

976
01:14:56,069 --> 01:14:58,128
Leave me the fuck alone.

977
01:16:43,622 --> 01:16:46,075
Come on.

978
01:17:08,133 --> 01:17:09,892
No.

979
01:17:09,893 --> 01:17:12,485
Oh no.

980
01:17:12,486 --> 01:17:14,670
No, no, no, no.

981
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:39,593
I found you.

982
01:19:46,725 --> 01:19:48,271
Good boy.

983
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:02,595
<i>You have a beautiful figure.</i>

984
01:20:02,596 --> 01:20:03,778
Did you say something?

985
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:05,542
<i>That's not me. I'm over here.</i>

986
01:20:08,419 --> 01:20:09,763
Hey, shhh.

987
01:20:09,764 --> 01:20:12,135
What's a matter?

988
01:20:47,619 --> 01:20:49,891
You are such a pretty girl.

989
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:51,845
You are such a pretty girl.

990
01:21:18,595 --> 01:21:21,575
<i>Oh God, oh God, oh God.</i>

991
01:21:24,109 --> 01:21:25,825
God please help me, please help me.

992
01:21:25,826 --> 01:21:28,547
Please help me.

993
01:21:28,548 --> 01:21:30,596
Please help me.

994
01:21:36,835 --> 01:21:39,971
God's not here.

995
01:21:39,972 --> 01:21:42,146
God is not here.

996
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:44,867
God is not here.

997
01:22:28,355 --> 01:22:30,722
What the fuck are you doing in here?

998
01:22:30,723 --> 01:22:32,449
I know what you've done.

999
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:33,730
I've already called the police.

1000
01:22:33,731 --> 01:22:35,842
<i>Why would you do something like that?</i>

1001
01:22:35,843 --> 01:22:37,762
This is none of your concern, okay?

1002
01:22:37,763 --> 01:22:40,865
What I did, I did for my fucking grandma.

1003
01:22:40,866 --> 01:22:41,859
Okay?

1004
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:43,713
Why don't you just,

1005
01:22:43,714 --> 01:22:45,570
just forget what you saw here,

1006
01:22:45,571 --> 01:22:48,353
and let me dispose of this
before the cops arrive.

1007
01:22:48,354 --> 01:22:49,635
Sorry, I can't let you do that.

1008
01:22:49,827 --> 01:22:52,225
Be reasonable.

1009
01:22:52,226 --> 01:22:53,186
Oh God.

1010
01:22:53,187 --> 01:22:55,393
You ungrateful bitch.

1011
01:22:55,394 --> 01:22:59,010
My family reached out to you
and took care of you,

1012
01:22:59,011 --> 01:23:02,145
and this is how you show your appreciation,

1013
01:23:02,146 --> 01:23:05,665
by violating our trust and betraying us.

1014
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:07,432
<i>Hands in the air.</i>

1015
01:23:12,227 --> 01:23:16,075
Now get off the girl, nice and easy.

1016
01:23:23,747 --> 01:23:26,305
You okay?

1017
01:23:26,306 --> 01:23:27,652
Yeah.

1018
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:31,464
The body's down there.

1019
01:23:37,218 --> 01:23:40,065
Here's some cash for clothing and food,

1020
01:23:40,066 --> 01:23:41,281
in a case like this it could be days,

1021
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:42,689
maybe even weeks before you'll be approved

1022
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:45,121
to get back at the house
to collect your things.

1023
01:23:45,122 --> 01:23:47,009
So I'm gonna pick you up tomorrow,

1024
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:48,386
take you down to the station,

1025
01:23:48,387 --> 01:23:50,944
we'll get your full statement.

1026
01:23:50,945 --> 01:23:52,289
In the meantime, if you need anything,

1027
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:54,176
I mean anything at all.

1028
01:23:54,177 --> 01:23:56,129
Don't hesitate to call.

1029
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:57,601
Okay.

1030
01:23:57,602 --> 01:24:00,097
Get some sleep, you deserve it.

1031
01:24:00,098 --> 01:24:01,763
Thanks.

1032
01:24:35,329 --> 01:24:37,696
What do you want from me?

1033
01:24:37,697 --> 01:24:40,064
I have done everything.

1034
01:24:40,065 --> 01:24:42,311
Leave me alone.

1035
01:24:46,947 --> 01:24:48,865
Just a few yards from where I stand lie

1036
01:24:48,866 --> 01:24:51,106
the gory remains of Jennifer Eastman,

1037
01:24:51,107 --> 01:24:54,561
<i>a Cassadaga resident who
went missing four years ago.</i>

1038
01:24:54,562 --> 01:24:56,353
<i>Her body was discovered in a hidden,</i>

1039
01:24:56,354 --> 01:24:59,424
<i>underground workshop where
her limbs had been dismembered</i>

1040
01:24:59,425 --> 01:25:03,296
<i>and then reattached to form
a gruesome human marionette.</i>

1041
01:25:03,297 --> 01:25:04,576
The primary suspect,

1042
01:25:04,577 --> 01:25:07,233
a man now dubbed as Gepetto
by the national media

1043
01:25:07,234 --> 01:25:08,929
is none other than Thomas Andersen,

1044
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:09,888
heir to the

1045
01:25:09,889 --> 01:25:10,945
The pulleys and the metal used

1046
01:25:10,946 --> 01:25:12,161
for the joints to hold them together

1047
01:25:12,162 --> 01:25:15,137
were widely available
in any local hardware store,

1048
01:25:15,138 --> 01:25:17,376
but the rope has an
industrial coating on it,

1049
01:25:17,377 --> 01:25:18,944
it makes it resistant to rotten mildew,

1050
01:25:18,945 --> 01:25:21,024
specifically designed for foresters.

1051
01:25:21,025 --> 01:25:23,456
So I'm guessing the stores
around here don't sell it.

1052
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:25,088
Nope, only online.

1053
01:25:25,089 --> 01:25:27,969
Well check the stores around
their vacation properties.

1054
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:30,432
Anything within 100 miles.

1055
01:25:30,433 --> 01:25:32,512
Now what's the status
of the Greenhouse blueprints?

1056
01:25:32,513 --> 01:25:33,920
I made a call to city planning this morning

1057
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:34,913
just waiting to hear back.

1058
01:25:34,914 --> 01:25:36,160
Good work.

1059
01:25:36,161 --> 01:25:37,409
Let me know when you hear something.

1060
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:39,744
Alright, will do.

1061
01:25:39,745 --> 01:25:40,928
<i>Ready to go?</i>

1062
01:25:40,929 --> 01:25:42,535
Yeah.

1063
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:48,511
You okay?

1064
01:25:48,512 --> 01:25:50,656
You up for this?

1065
01:25:50,657 --> 01:25:51,969
What'd you find in the house?

1066
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:54,527
Behind all the padlocked
closets and drawers?

1067
01:25:54,528 --> 01:25:56,608
<i>Valuables, drug paraphernalia.</i>

1068
01:25:56,609 --> 01:25:58,880
<i>Some pornography in the upstairs trunks.</i>

1069
01:25:58,881 --> 01:26:00,799
And what's Thomas saying?

1070
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,177
Standard response,

1071
01:26:02,178 --> 01:26:04,193
denies everything but the marijuana corp.

1072
01:26:04,194 --> 01:26:06,369
Claims he didn't know about the dungeon.

1073
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:08,671
Says that during the bulk
of the greenhouse construction

1074
01:26:08,672 --> 01:26:10,641
he and his grandmother were on vacation.

1075
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:15,103
<i>Yo, what do you got for me?</i>

1076
01:26:15,104 --> 01:26:16,703
<i>Huh.</i>

1077
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:18,687
<i>Maybe he still has the original.</i>

1078
01:26:18,688 --> 01:26:20,405
<i>Can you give me his office address?</i>

1079
01:26:22,146 --> 01:26:25,343
<i>What about the other permits on file,
anything recent?</i>

1080
01:26:25,344 --> 01:26:28,127
<i>Yeah, give me that address.</i>

1081
01:26:28,128 --> 01:26:30,623
<i>I'll swing by and see
if he's still on the job.</i>

1082
01:26:30,624 --> 01:26:33,056
<i>We need to make a quick stop.</i>

1083
01:26:33,057 --> 01:26:34,258
Okay.

1084
01:26:51,521 --> 01:26:53,151
You know what?

1085
01:26:53,152 --> 01:26:55,648
We're still at least 30 minutes out

1086
01:26:55,649 --> 01:26:58,080
if you wanted to crawl into
the back and catch some zs,

1087
01:26:58,081 --> 01:27:00,160
I got some blankets in the truck.

1088
01:27:00,161 --> 01:27:01,221
Yeah, that'd be nice.

1089
01:27:20,321 --> 01:27:21,855
Here you go.

1090
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,135
Thanks.

1091
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,576
Sleep tight sweetheart,

1092
01:27:24,577 --> 01:27:26,080
I'll wake you when we get to the station.

1093
01:27:26,081 --> 01:27:27,563
Okay.

1094
01:27:41,633 --> 01:27:44,415
Excuse me.

1095
01:27:44,416 --> 01:27:46,661
Excuse me.

1096
01:27:51,457 --> 01:27:54,400
Aw, sorry, the Matteson's aren't here.

1097
01:27:54,401 --> 01:27:56,288
They should be back later this evening.

1098
01:27:56,289 --> 01:27:58,784
Actually I was hoping I could
have a moment with you?

1099
01:27:58,785 --> 01:28:00,352
<i>Are you Christian Burton?</i>

1100
01:28:00,353 --> 01:28:04,320
Yeah, is there, is there a problem?

1101
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:05,631
Nah, nothing like that.

1102
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:08,255
I just had a few questions
about the Andersen estate?

1103
01:28:08,256 --> 01:28:09,856
You built the greenhouse
for them a while back, right?

1104
01:28:09,857 --> 01:28:10,816
I did yeah.

1105
01:28:10,817 --> 01:28:14,048
I guess that was four years ago.

1106
01:28:14,049 --> 01:28:16,192
Did you hear the news at all today?

1107
01:28:16,193 --> 01:28:18,175
No, why?

1108
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,230
<i>Well, it turns out that Thomas</i>

1109
01:28:19,231 --> 01:28:20,831
<i>used the greenhouse you built for them</i>

1110
01:28:20,832 --> 01:28:22,047
<i>to store some remains</i>

1111
01:28:22,048 --> 01:28:24,354
<i>of a very unfortunate young lady.</i>

1112
01:28:27,231 --> 01:28:29,439
Um, I'm sorry to hear that.

1113
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,839
My sympathies to the family.

1114
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,016
Yeah, but I just had a few questions

1115
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:36,895
about the cellar built into the foundation.

1116
01:28:36,896 --> 01:28:40,032
What, the mushroom house.

1117
01:28:40,033 --> 01:28:41,055
Is that what that's for?

1118
01:28:41,056 --> 01:28:42,014
Growing mushrooms.

1119
01:28:42,015 --> 01:28:43,487
Well, it's not for everyone,

1120
01:28:43,488 --> 01:28:46,656
but, for some gardeners
mircroculture's part

1121
01:28:46,657 --> 01:28:48,672
of the experience yeah.

1122
01:28:48,673 --> 01:28:50,687
So I'm assuming this mushroom house

1123
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,775
is on the blueprints you submitted

1124
01:28:51,776 --> 01:28:53,599
and Thomas signed off on them.

1125
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,167
Of course.

1126
01:28:55,168 --> 01:28:56,960
Would you happen to have
a copy of the original.

1127
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:58,558
The city seems to have lost their copy.

1128
01:28:58,559 --> 01:29:00,062
<i>That would be an extremely
beneficial piece of evidence.</i>

1129
01:29:00,063 --> 01:29:03,039
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure I got them.

1130
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,438
It might take me a couple
of days to get them.

1131
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:06,679
I mean, that was four years ago

1132
01:29:06,752 --> 01:29:09,278
and I'll probably have
to dig them out of storage.

1133
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:12,446
That's fine, do you have a card,
something with your info.

1134
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:13,567
<i>City doesn't have anything.</i>

1135
01:29:13,568 --> 01:29:15,394
Here.

1136
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:19,711
Thanks.

1137
01:29:19,712 --> 01:29:22,366
I'll be in touch.

1138
01:29:22,367 --> 01:29:24,071
<i>Anything to help.</i>

1139
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,863
You said you built that greenhouse

1140
01:29:32,864 --> 01:29:35,359
four years ago, right?

1141
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,343
What time of the year was that?

1142
01:29:37,344 --> 01:29:40,447
Early September, late October.

1143
01:29:40,448 --> 01:29:41,503
That's around the time
that girl went missing,

1144
01:29:41,504 --> 01:29:42,910
Jennifer Easton.

1145
01:29:42,911 --> 01:29:45,022
I don't recall seeing your name
on any police report.

1146
01:29:45,023 --> 01:29:46,398
Anyone ever ask you to give a statement?

1147
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:47,614
No.

1148
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:50,462
Do you mind coming down
to the station with me,

1149
01:29:50,463 --> 01:29:53,022
making a full report?

1150
01:29:53,023 --> 01:29:54,366
<i>What have you done?</i>

1151
01:29:54,367 --> 01:29:55,664
Go back to the car.

1152
01:30:11,967 --> 01:30:14,782
Wake up.

1153
01:30:14,783 --> 01:30:16,591
Wake up.

1154
01:30:32,895 --> 01:30:36,574
No, no, no, oh my God, no.

1155
01:30:36,575 --> 01:30:38,623
Oh my God.

1156
01:30:38,624 --> 01:30:40,349
<i>Oh my God.</i>

1157
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:41,310
No.

1158
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:42,750
No, no, please.

1159
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:44,318
Let me out.

1160
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:46,206
Fucking shit, no.

1161
01:30:46,207 --> 01:30:48,637
<i>Please.</i>

1162
01:30:48,638 --> 01:30:51,550
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

1163
01:30:51,551 --> 01:30:53,505
<i>Let me.</i>

1164
01:30:55,423 --> 01:30:57,438
<i>Please.</i>

1165
01:30:57,439 --> 01:30:58,365
Don't, don't touch me.

1166
01:30:58,366 --> 01:31:00,702
Don't.

1167
01:31:00,703 --> 01:31:03,166
Please, please don't.

1168
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:04,382
Please don't.

1169
01:31:04,383 --> 01:31:05,407
don't, don't, don't.

1170
01:31:05,408 --> 01:31:06,333
Please don't.

1171
01:31:06,334 --> 01:31:09,234
Please.

1172
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:26,051
Oh, no. No. Oh my God.

1173
01:33:26,462 --> 01:33:28,732
No. No.

1174
01:33:28,733 --> 01:33:30,204
No. No.

1175
01:33:30,205 --> 01:33:31,389
No. No.

1176
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:34,272
No.

1177
01:33:36,765 --> 01:33:37,980
This is for your own good.

1178
01:33:37,981 --> 01:33:39,388
This is for your own good.

1179
01:33:39,389 --> 01:33:41,316
This is for your own good.

1180
01:33:48,029 --> 01:33:51,549
I can't hear you.

1181
01:34:02,525 --> 01:34:04,956
Stop.

1182
01:34:04,957 --> 01:34:06,206
Oh God.

1183
01:34:50,781 --> 01:34:52,027
Oh my God.

1184
01:34:52,028 --> 01:34:54,781
Oh God.

1185
01:35:47,517 --> 01:35:49,371
Fuck you.

1186
01:35:49,372 --> 01:35:51,710
Fuck you.

1187
01:37:33,341 --> 01:37:35,931
Ahh.

1188
01:37:35,932 --> 01:37:37,626
Ahhh.

1189
01:37:37,627 --> 01:37:39,866
Ahh.

1190
01:37:39,867 --> 01:37:42,618
<i>You have a beautiful figure.</i>

1191
01:37:42,619 --> 01:37:43,899
<i>That's not me.</i>

1192
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,306
<i>I'm over here.</i>

1193
01:37:45,307 --> 01:37:47,337
<i>And your dog.</i>

1194
01:38:32,411 --> 01:38:35,610
<i>Everyone at school calls me the fetus,</i>

1195
01:38:35,611 --> 01:38:38,970
<i>it's like they don't want
anything to do with me.</i>

1196
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:41,371
<i>And I was so excited about
skipping seventh and eighth</i>

1197
01:38:41,372 --> 01:38:42,842
<i>and going straight to high school,</i>

1198
01:38:42,843 --> 01:38:48,484
<i>but, now I think it was the
biggest mistake I've ever made.</i>

1199
01:38:56,156 --> 01:38:59,289
Baby soon, you're gonna become

1200
01:38:59,290 --> 01:39:02,937
the most beautiful girl in school.

1201
01:39:02,938 --> 01:39:04,328
Really?

1202
01:39:16,795 --> 01:39:19,135
I got you something.

1203
01:39:23,931 --> 01:39:25,243
Thank you.

1204
01:39:25,244 --> 01:39:27,258
You're welcome.

1205
01:39:27,259 --> 01:39:29,724
By the time that you graduate,

1206
01:39:31,642 --> 01:39:36,601
I will have saved up enough
money to move us both to Paris.

1207
01:39:36,602 --> 01:39:39,070
Are you serious?

1208
01:39:42,906 --> 01:39:44,985
Yeah.

1209
01:39:44,986 --> 01:39:47,931
Thank you Lily.

1210
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:51,465
You're the best mom
a little sister could ever want.

1211
01:40:03,738 --> 01:40:06,334
I'm so sorry.

1212
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:13,850
I'm so sorry for what
happened to you that day.

1213
01:40:13,851 --> 01:40:15,578
It was my fault.

1214
01:40:15,579 --> 01:40:18,393
It was my stupid idea to move to Paris.

1215
01:40:18,394 --> 01:40:21,050
It's not your fault.

1216
01:40:21,051 --> 01:40:22,809
I was excited to go.

1217
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:25,565
I wanted to go.

1218
01:40:27,483 --> 01:40:30,878
I cherished every moment
I ever spent with you Lily.

1219
01:40:33,755 --> 01:40:37,053
You made me happy every day of my life.

1220
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:42,938
I love you.

1221
01:40:42,939 --> 01:40:44,352
And I'll always love you.

1222
01:40:51,066 --> 01:40:52,442
Don't go.

1223
01:40:52,443 --> 01:40:54,541
Please don't go.
