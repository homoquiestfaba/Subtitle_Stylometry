1
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:30,497
<i>Eve?</i>

2
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:31,464
Is it weird watching
a nuclear explosion

3
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,467
right after we've had sex?

4
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,470
That's just what life is now.

5
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,843
Yeah.

6
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:48,182
It could happen to us
any time, now.

7
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,234
<i>This is Brooklyn internet radio.</i>

8
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,037
<i>Rainy skies this morning</i>

9
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,906

10

<i>Next up is international news.</i>

11
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:58,853
<i>Because of escalating tension</i>

12
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,453
<i>between the United States and...</i>

13
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:02,422
<i>and between...</i>

14
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,725
<i>and the United States...</i>

15
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,794
<i>the United States Army
has been deployed.</i>

16
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,965
<i>Top story this morning,
the President announced</i>

17
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,566
<i>the roll out of his plan</i>

18
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,402
<i>which has been approved
by Congress.</i>

19
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:21,441
<i>Residents of major cities

20
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,610
<i>their escape plans...</i>

21
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:26,347
<i>both have dramatically increased</i>

22
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,516
<i>their manufacture
of nuclear weapons.</i>

23
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:36,857
<i>Both countries are threatening
to use nuclear weapons...</i>

24
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,660
<i>The White House warns
it could come at any time,</i>

25
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:42,263
<i>nuclear, nuclear weapons,</i>

26
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,832
<i>the President urges citizens
to remain calm.</i>

27
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,305
<i>Local governments
have provided guidelines</i>

28
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,873
<i>on how many people
are to practice</i>

29
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,875
<i>their escape plans.</i>

30
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:57,278
<i>People will practice in turns...</i>

31
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,478
<i>practice escaping...</i>

32
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,181
<i>escape.</i>

33
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,706
So, this is Poughkeepsie.

34
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:52,046
It feels weird to be here.

35
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,618
Well, the government
suggested it.

36
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,522
Since when does the government
give good advice?

37
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,360
We're actually practicing
what to do

38
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:07,928
if a nuclear bomb goes off.

39
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,231
With what's going on
in the world,

40
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,799
it could happen any day.

41
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:17,037
We're practicing how to evacuate
out of New York City.

42
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:25,312
Well, so far, so good.

43
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:49,970
Hey, Mr. Pooch!

44
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,805
Mr. Pooch.

45
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:59,514
Well, this is Kevin
and Sue's weekend house.

46
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,620
It's nice of them
to leave us a gun.

47
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,051
So, there is life
outside New York.

48
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,226
You should know...

49
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,430
I'm pregnant.

50
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,672
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

51
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:12,507
Just one sip. One sip.

52
00:16:12,574 --> 00:16:14,041
You've already had some.

53
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,814
Hey! Hey!

54
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,730
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

55
00:16:42,704 --> 00:16:44,706
- I put on our song.
- I noticed.

56
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,241
It's cheesy,

57
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,410
but it's nice.

58
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,484
I want to have a child with you.

59
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,526
Now? With all this?

60
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:09,096
Don't be practical.

61
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:11,599
One of us has to be.

62
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:14,434
Love doesn't have to make sense.

63
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:08,590
Hey, buddy.

64
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,091
How's my little man?

65
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:15,964
I love you too, son.

66
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,568
Could you put your mom
on the line?

67
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:25,006
Hey, Beth. Are you both okay?

68
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,241
Beth?

69
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,110
Beth?

70
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,315
We lost the connection.

71
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:02,510
You don't look like a guy
who would pray.

72
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:06,948
You really believe in religion?

73
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,517
As much as I believe
in anything.

74
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:24,297
What were you praying for?

75
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:28,335
I was praying
that God's will be done.

76
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:34,842
Well, let's hope
<i>she</i> has good judgment...

77
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:36,678
- Hmm.
- And it's going to fix

78
00:19:36,744 --> 00:19:39,914
this international crisis.

79
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:47,187
Do you think Chris likes me?

80
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:49,857
What?

81
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,760
I know it's crazy to worry

82
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,395
about whether
a six-year-old boy likes you.

83
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,413
Chris?

84
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:15,883
Chris!

85
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,120
- <i>Charles!</i>
- Chris!

86
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,055
It's a dream!

87
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:24,291
Chris is okay.

88
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:31,364
He was in front of me...

89
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:36,037
and he couldn't breathe.

90
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,912
And he died in front of me.

91
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:52,086
What if I can't save my own son?

92
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:23,077
How was your walk?

93
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:25,246
It was okay.

94
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,516
It's seven o'clock
in the morning.

95
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:31,418
So what?

96
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,521
We're on vacation.

97
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:34,889
Is that what this is?

98
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,226
You know, we're just lucky
that they're out of town

99
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:40,261
and we just have
to watch the dog.

100
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:43,363
- I'll make us some breakfast.
- I'm not hungry.

101
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,699
I'm worried about you.

102
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:50,605
If I want to drink any crap

103
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:52,874
first thing in the morning,
I'm gonna do it.

104
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:56,110
I'm not one of those boys
you used to date

105
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,444
who you couldn't trust.

106
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:01,782
I'm here and they're not.

107
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:20,234
I know you're worried
about Chris.

108
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:25,072
It sucks that Beth took him
to visit his grandparents now.

109
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,877
I called again, there are
no plane tickets to California.

110
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:32,479
All the airlines are grounded.

111
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,715
Maybe we should drive?

112
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:38,386
Which would take five days.

113
00:23:40,855 --> 00:23:42,422
The news is clear.

114
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:49,297
Multiple nuclear missiles
might hit Los Angeles today...

115
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:54,835
Today.

116
00:23:58,172 --> 00:23:59,907
Who are you angry at, Charles?

117
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:05,780
You don't even know
who you're angry at.

118
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:33,274
<i>This report just in...</i>

119
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,543
<i>The governor of Virginia
has been shot.</i>

120
00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:39,447
<i>No news yet
on if she is still alive.</i>

121
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:42,783
<i>This just in
after a mass shooting</i>

122
00:24:42,817 --> 00:24:44,852
<i>just outside Washington D.C.</i>

123
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,081
I never call myself an artist.

124
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:52,119
<i>I call myself a painter.</i>

125
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:01,295
But, whatever you call it,

126
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,632
it's a way of seeing the world.

127
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,406
Someone might focus on making
as much money as possible,

128
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:14,241
which is okay,

129
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,812
but my work is different.

130
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:21,482
It helps me process life.

131
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:46,774
So, today,
I paint a nuclear explosion.

132
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:51,312
<i>It's a rehearsal for what
may happen later today.</i>

133
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:57,485
<i>It's part of my series
about the End of Days,</i>

134
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,421
which I hope doesn't happen.

135
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:09,430
<i>But I imagine the unimaginable.</i>

136
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:36,223
I keep trying to call him.

137
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,562
The calls won't go through.

138
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,498
All the lines are jammed.

139
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:49,069
And your parents?

140
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,139
I'm just glad I spoke
to them last week.

141
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,013
The Russian troops
have marched into the city.

142
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:44,952
<i>"These are the words of Christ</i>

143
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:48,922
<i>and they teach us
how far we must imitate</i>

144
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:50,791
<i>his life and character.</i>

145
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:55,796
<i>If we seek illumination
from all blindness of heart,</i>

146
00:29:56,631 --> 00:30:00,000
let it be our most
earnest study, therefore,

147
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:04,506
to dwell upon the life
of Jesus Christ."

148
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:14,114
So, um, you just try to be
as much like Jesus as you can.

149
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:20,689
Even though you know
you're going to mess up a lot.

150
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:07,020
Beth has it figured out,

151
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:11,058
a fancy apartment,
fancy job, a son.

152
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:23,805
I'm just a painter...
with a day job,

153
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:28,543
doing administrative work
four days a week.

154
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:33,347
Does it kill my soul?

155
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:35,950
No.

156
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:38,987
<i>You</i> actually make a living
writing your novels

157
00:33:39,888 --> 00:33:42,524
about people
struggling to be moral

158
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,224
in an amoral world.

159
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:50,865
Well, I think my readers know...

160
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:56,169
that I'm a man
who knows about fear.

161
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:04,044
The fear of... of when you die,

162
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:08,382
nobody will give a shit.

163
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,220
That your life has no meaning

164
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,027
because you didn't earn
millions of dollars...

165
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:25,900
or set the world on fire.

166
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,709
You just had a life.

167
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:47,622
They didn't bomb
Los Angeles today.

168
00:34:57,832 --> 00:34:59,968
So, I... I guess it's a good day.

169
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:25,412
Sorry that took so long.

170
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,049
I must have missed breakfast.

171
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:33,621
Eve?

172
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:38,258
The Russians
have taken over the city.

173
00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:40,393
Tbilisi.

174
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:43,463
They've cut off
all the phone service

175
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:44,665
to the West.

176
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:52,607
My parents are liberal,
intellectuals, artists.

177
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:56,511
They'll be among the first
they'll imprison.

178
00:38:03,316 --> 00:38:05,853
I don't know how to wait
for bombs to come.

179
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,629
Did you get food?

180
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:17,865
There's hardly any.

181
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:20,868
Did you get gas?

182
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:25,139
There's nothing.

183
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:29,177
We have to be
really careful where we drive.

184
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:35,283
What has happened to the world?

185
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:39,153
I'm just trying to live
my little life,

186
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,155
but how can I do that
when I don't know

187
00:38:41,222 --> 00:38:43,057
if I'll ever see
my parents again?

188
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:47,562
And you don't know
if you will see your son.

189
00:38:57,104 --> 00:38:59,173
Where is your God now, Charles?

190
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:25,893
Eve?

191
00:40:28,596 --> 00:40:29,730
Eve!

192
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:32,934
Eve!

193
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:35,803
Eve!

194
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:43,945
Eve!

195
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,581
Eve?

196
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,788
I lost the baby.

197
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:38,299
Life can be over so quickly.

198
00:43:09,824 --> 00:43:11,892
<i>More rioting broke out today</i>

199
00:43:11,926 --> 00:43:14,895
<i>in Washington where protests
turned violent.</i>

200
00:43:16,363 --> 00:43:18,567
<i>Up to two dozen
people were killed,</i>

201
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:21,969
<i>several hundred were wounded...</i>

202
00:43:23,671 --> 00:43:25,139
<i>It's just been announced...</i>

203
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,809
<i>the mayor of Washington
has been shot.</i>

204
00:44:04,078 --> 00:44:06,947
<i>People are
kneeling down and joining hands,</i>

205
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:08,849
<i>they're praying...</i>

206
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:10,684
Turn it off.

207
00:44:28,603 --> 00:44:30,137
I wanna go to church.

208
00:45:13,814 --> 00:45:16,250
<i>Attention!
This is an emergency alert.</i>

209
00:45:16,283 --> 00:45:17,885
<i>This is an alert</i>

210
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:19,787
<i>of the Emergency
Broadcast System.</i>

211
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:22,990
<i>The Air Force has been deployed</i>

212
00:45:23,023 --> 00:45:25,059
<i>over the State Capital
in Albany.</i>

213
00:45:26,595 --> 00:45:28,896
<i>The Air Force has been deployed
over West Point.</i>

214
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:33,367
<i>The Air Force has been deployed
over the nuclear power plant</i>

215
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,536
<i>in Westchester.</i>

216
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:37,738
<i>The area
is at the highest alert.</i>

217
00:45:40,808 --> 00:45:43,377
<i>Nuclear bombs
are expected to be dropped</i>

218
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,279
<i>throughout
the Hudson Valley region.</i>

219
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:11,058
It's hard to imagine
anything bad happening

220
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:12,727
in such a beautiful place.

221
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:22,035
The news reports
said that there will be

222
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:26,808
a massive attack
today or tomorrow.

223
00:48:43,525 --> 00:48:46,126
Maybe it's better
to decide for ourselves

224
00:48:47,027 --> 00:48:50,464
rather than wait for the
Russians to decide our fate.

225
00:48:59,641 --> 00:49:01,843
Maybe we can make
a different choice.

226
00:49:21,161 --> 00:49:23,665
<i>Outside Poughkeepsie,
a short drive away,</i>

227
00:49:24,398 --> 00:49:25,800
<i>are the Catskill Mountains.</i>

228
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:31,171
<i>The Hudson River School
painted these mountains</i>

229
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:32,540
<i>in the 19th century.</i>

230
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:37,277
<i>It portraits
a Romantic landscape</i>

231
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:41,448
<i>where men and nature
coexist peacefully.</i>

232
00:49:44,586 --> 00:49:46,955
<i>New Yorkers have come here
to escape the city</i>

233
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:48,188
<i>for many decades.</i>

234
00:49:49,557 --> 00:49:51,559
<i>Maybe that's what
we're doing too.</i>

235
00:49:53,895 --> 00:49:56,063
<i>The artists believed that beauty</i>

236
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:58,733
<i>was a manifestation of God.</i>

237
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:08,208
I have a dream.

238
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,314
What is it?

239
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:17,317
That we do this forever.

240
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:54,414
Where are you taking me?

241
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:55,617
Dancing.

242
00:56:32,126 --> 00:56:33,426
We're still alive.

243
00:56:35,997 --> 00:56:38,465
You haven't eaten
my breakfast yet.

244
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:20,001
Stay indoors!

245
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:22,502
Go into the cellar,
this is not a drill!

246
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:25,039
Listen to the radio for orders!

247
00:58:26,073 --> 00:58:28,709
Go, go, go!

248
00:58:29,443 --> 00:58:30,878
Come on!

249
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:04,745
What's wrong?

250
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:07,381
We lost power.

251
00:59:07,448 --> 00:59:09,083
Where are you going?

252
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,352
To get more candles
and flashlights.

253
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:30,704
Charles!

254
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:31,939
Charles!

255
01:00:07,675 --> 01:00:11,078
<i>Mommy? Mommy?</i>

256
01:00:15,116 --> 01:00:17,519
<i>Go underground if you can.</i>

257
01:00:17,552 --> 01:00:20,921
<i>Go to your basements,
bring food and water...</i>

258
01:00:29,997 --> 01:00:33,267
<i>We've been informed
that you must cover all doors.</i>

259
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,275
<i>We've been informed...</i>

260
01:00:47,715 --> 01:00:49,717
<i>We've been informed...</i>

261
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:01,896
<i>Cover all doors and windows
with heavy plastic.</i>

262
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:04,698
<i>You must remain there
for several hours to avoid</i>

263
01:01:04,732 --> 01:01:07,334
<i>the worst of nuclear fallout
and radiation.</i>

264
01:01:07,368 --> 01:01:08,869
<i>Radiation.</i>

265
01:01:08,903 --> 01:01:10,471
<i>Radiation.</i>

266
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,195
Bring the light!

267
01:01:51,212 --> 01:01:53,180
<i>The president is begging</i>

268
01:01:53,214 --> 01:01:54,748
<i>the country to remain calm.</i>

269
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:13,743
<i>This is the time to remember</i>

270
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:14,935
<i>what's most important.</i>

271
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:18,573
<i>To hold our loved ones close,</i>

272
01:02:19,773 --> 01:02:22,943
<i>tell your family you love them.</i>

273
01:03:44,024 --> 01:03:45,359
Are you afraid to die?

274
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:55,135
No, but I've been
afraid to live.

275
01:04:00,908 --> 01:04:02,242
Maybe we won't die.

276
01:04:04,244 --> 01:04:07,515
I have to believe
that no matter what happens

277
01:04:07,582 --> 01:04:12,219
in this insane world,
that it's God's will.

278
01:04:15,557 --> 01:04:17,525
I wish I had your faith.

279
01:04:19,927 --> 01:04:21,328
You can have it.

280
01:04:26,768 --> 01:04:28,435
Isn't it too late?

281
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,779
<i>A nuclear bomb</i>

282
01:05:44,813 --> 01:05:46,581
<i>has been dropped on West Point.</i>

283
01:05:50,017 --> 01:05:52,186
<i>A nuclear bomb has been dropped</i>

284
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:54,188
<i>on the nuclear power plant
in Westchester.</i>

285
01:06:00,795 --> 01:06:02,873
<i>A nuclear bomb has been dropped</i>

286
01:06:02,897 --> 01:06:05,365
<i>on the State Capital on Albany.</i>

287
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:09,102
Eve?
