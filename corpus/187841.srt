00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:06,546
BRIDGET: It all began
on New Year's Day...

2
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,845
in my thirty-second year
of being single.

3
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,518
Once again,
I found myself on my own...

4
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:17,785
and going to my mother's
annual turkey curry buffet.

5
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,393
Every year,
she tries to fix me up...

6
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:21,759
with some bushy-haired,
middle-aged bore...

7
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:25,026
and I feared this year
would be no exception.

8
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:26,896
There you are, dumpling.

9
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:28,560
BRIDGET: My mum...

10
00:01:28,602 --> 00:01:30,001
a strange creature
from the time...

11
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:31,367
when pickles on toothpicks...

12
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:32,895
were still the height
of sophistication.

13
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,566
Doilies, Pam?
Hello, Bridget.

14
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:36,735
Third drawer from the top, Una.

15
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:38,745
Under the mini gherkins.

16
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:42,977
By the way, the Darcys are here.
They brought Mark with them.

17
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:44,574
BRIDGET: Ah, here we go.

18
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:46,017
You remember Mark.

19
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:47,713
You used to play
in his paddling pool.

20
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,589
He's a barrister.
Very well off.

21
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:51,648
No, I don't remember.

22
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,591
He's divorced, apparently.

23
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:56,095
His wife was Japanese.
Very cruel race.

24
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:57,790
Now, what are you
going to put on?

25
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:58,957
This.

26
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:00,899
MUM: Oh, don’t be silly,
Bridget.

27
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:02,060
You'll never get a boyfriend...

28
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:04,070
if you look like you've
wandered out of Auschwitz.

29
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,093
Now, run upstairs.

30
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,107
I've laid out something
lovely on your bed.

31
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:10,201
Tsk. [Sighs]

32
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,176
ANDY WILLIAMS SINGING:
You're just too good to be true

33
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:16,614
Can’t take my eyes off of you

34
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,019
BRIDGET: Great.
I was wearing a carpet.

35
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:22,885
UNCLE GEOFFREY: There she is.

36
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:26,882
[Singing]
My little Bridget

37
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:29,418
Hi, Uncle Geoffrey. Ha ha.

38
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:30,760
- Hmm. Had a drink?
- No.

39
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:32,059
No? Come on, then.

40
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:33,793
BRIDGET:
Actually, not my uncle.

41
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,597
Someone who insists
I call him uncle...

42
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:36,966
while he gropes my ass...

43
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:40,097
and asks me the question
dreaded by all Singletons.

44
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,166
UNCLE GEOFFREY:
So... how's your love life?

45
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,440
Super. Thanks, Uncle G.

46
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,481
Still no fellow, then, eh?
I don't know.

47
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,972
You career girls.
Can't put it off forever.

48
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,916
UNA: Tick-tock, tick-tock.

49
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:54,477
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, darling.

50
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:56,079
How's it going?

51
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:57,714
Torture.

52
00:02:57,757 --> 00:03:00,658
DAD: Your mother’s trying to
fix you up with some divorcee.

53
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:02,093
Uhh.

54
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:05,188
Human-rights barrister. Pretty nasty beast, apparently.

55
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:08,668
BRIDGET: Hoo. Ding-dong.

56
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:11,535
Maybe this time
Mum had got it right.

57
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:14,904
Come on. Why don’t we see
if Mark fancies a gherkin?

58
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,932
[Whispering] Good luck.

59
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,500
Mark?

60
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:21,241
BRIDGET: Maybe this was
the mysterious Mr. Right...

61
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:24,079
l’d been waiting
my whole life to meet.

62
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:27,177
You remember Bridget.

63
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,983
BRIDGET: Maybe not.

64
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:30,785
She's used to
run around your lawn...

65
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,985
with no clothes on, remember?

66
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:35,085
Uh, no, not as such.

67
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:37,990
Come and look
at your gravy, Pam.

68
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:39,896
I think it's going
to need sieving.

69
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,127
Of course it doesn't
need sieving.

70
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,930
Just stir it, Una.

71
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:46,171
Yes, of course.
I'll be right there.

72
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:49,175
Sorry. Lumpy gravy calls.

73
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,677
ANDY WILLIAMS SINGING:
Let me love you

[Sighs]

75
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:56,148
- So... ha.
- So.

76
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:59,310
You staying at your parents'
for New Year?

77
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,884
- Yes.
- Mmm.

78
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:02,320
- You?
- Oh, no, no, no.

79
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,513
I was in London
at a party last night...

80
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:06,856
so I'm afraid
I'm a bit hung over.

81
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:08,827
Wish I could be lying
with my head in the toilet...

82
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,329
Like all normal people.

83
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,293
[Chuckles, sighs]

84
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:15,028
New Year's resolution...
drink less.

85
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:18,037
Oh, and quit smoking.
Mmm. Ha.

86
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:20,733
- Oh.
- Oh. Ha.

87
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:23,174
And keep New Year's resolutions.

88
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:27,914
Oh. And, uh...

89
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:30,883
stop talking total nonsense
to strangers.

90
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,219
In fact, stop talking,
full stop.

91
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:36,814
Yes, well,
perhaps it's time to eat.

92
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:37,788
Mmm.

93
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:39,655
ANDY WILLIAMS SINGING:
I need you, baby

94
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:40,625
MRS. DARCY: Apparently...

95
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:42,721
she lives just 'roundthe corner from you.

96
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:45,322
Mother, I do not need
a blind date.

97
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:47,993
Particularly not with some
verbally incontinent spinster...

98
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,797
who smokes like a chimney,
drinks like a fish...

99
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:51,895
and dresses like her mother.

100
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:56,269
Yummy.

101
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,174
Turkey curry.

102
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:00,076
My favourite.

103
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:02,946
BRIDGET: And that was it.
Right there.

104
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,918
Right there.
That was the moment.

105
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:11,318
I suddenly realized that unless
some thing changed soon...

106
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:14,020
I was going to live a life
where my major relationship...

107
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,925
was with a bottle of wine...

108
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:19,125
and I'd finally die
fat and alone...

109
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:22,965
and be found three weeks later,
half-eaten by wild dogs.

110
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:25,631
Or I was about to
turn into Glenn Close...

111
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:27,105
in "Fatal Attraction."

All by myself

115
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:44,313
Anymore

JAMIEO'NEAL SINGING:
When I was young

118
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:20,157
I never needed anyone

119
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:26,457
And making' love
was just for fun

120
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:31,327
Those days are gone

121
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,704
All by myself

00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:44,474

00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:57,962
Ohh

Oh-oh-oh

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,771
All by myself

129
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:19,979
Don't wanna live...

130
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,044
BRIDGET: And so I made
a major decision.

131
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:23,487
I had to make sure
That next year...

132
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:26,788
I wouldn't end up shit-faced
and listening to sad FM...

133
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:29,260
easy-listening
for the over-thirties.

134
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:32,230
I decided to take
control of my life...

135
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:33,755
and start a diary...

136
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,462
to tell the truth
about Bridget Jones...

137
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:37,868
the whole truth.

138
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:41,399
Resolution number one...
ohh...

139
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:43,243
obviously will lose
twenty pounds.

140
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:44,141
Number two...

141
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:46,737
always put last night's panties
in the laundry basket.

142
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,145
Equally important...

143
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:50,809
will find nice sensible
boyfriend to go out with...

144
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,875
and not continue to form
romantic attachments...

145
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,409
to any of the following...

146
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:56,820
alcoholics, workaholics,
commitment-phobics...

147
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:58,187
peeping toms, megalomaniacs...

148
00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:00,124
emotional fuckwits,
or perverts.

149
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,856
And especially
will not fantasize...

150
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:07,424
about a particular person
who embodies all these things.

ARETHA FRANKLIN SINGING:
What you want

152
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,863
Baby, I got

153
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:14,567
What you need

154
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:16,173
Do you know I got it?

just happens to be my boss...

Editor-in-Chief,
Daniel Cleaver.

157
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:23,783
And for various
slightly unfair reasons...

158
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:26,013
relating to this year's
Christmas party...

159
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:29,920
I suspect he does not
fantasize about me.

BRIDGET, DRUNK, SINGING:
Oh

161
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:36,255
Can't live

162
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:39,959
If living is without you

163
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:44,561
I can't live

164
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:46,231
Can't give anymore

165
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:48,797
BRIDGET: Or maybe I'm wrong.

166
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:49,968
Huh?

Happy New Year, Mr. Fitzherbert.

Tits Pervert, more like.

172
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,825
Daniel's boss who stares
freely at my breasts...

173
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:11,626
with no idea who I am
or what I do.

174
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:13,992
Morning. I need that
"Kafka's Motorbike" release...

175
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,193
by 11:00.

176
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:17,863
BRIDGET: Perpetual...
slightly senior...

177
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:19,929
and therefore thinks
she's in charge of me.

178
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:21,133

00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:13,576
Yes. Yes, it was me.

357
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:15,842
Yes. Nine years ago.

358
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:17,781
No current plans
to record anything else.

359
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:19,045
Thank you so much.

360
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:20,882
Oh, it's just that, ahem...

361
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,117
your... your chair
is on my wife's coat.

362
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:25,756
[Laughter]

363
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,588
Your... your chair on the...

364
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,617
Of course it is.
Of course it is.

365
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,322
MAN: Thank you so much.
Thank you.

366
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:33,730
BRIDGET: Hmm. Major dilemma.

367
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,529
If actually do,
by some terrible chance...

368
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:37,058
end up in flagrante...

369
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:40,595
surely these would be most
attractive at crucial moment.

370
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:42,800
However, chances of
reaching crucial moment...

371
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:45,344
greatly increase
by wearing these.

372
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:47,471
Scary stomach-holding-in
panties.

00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:53,644

["Peter Gunn" continues playing]

00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:10,659
BRIDGET:
Ladies and gentlemen...

376
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:13,501
welcome to the launch
of "Kafka's Motorbike"...

377
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:14,904
"The Greatest Book
of Our Time"...

378
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,738
and here to introduce it
is Mr. Tiits Pervert.

379
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:20,746
Ooh, Fitzherbert,
Fitzherbert, Fitzherbert.

380
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:25,850
OK, circulate,
oozing intelligence.

381
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:29,184
Ignore Daniel, and be fabulous
with everyone else.

382
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:33,154
I am the intellectual equal
of everyone else here.

383
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:34,489
Ooh.

384
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:36,722
It's like a whole theory
of short fiction...

385
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:38,525
and of the novella, you know?

386
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:39,758
And, of course, the problem...

387
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:41,562
with Martin's definition
of the novella...

388
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,999
is that it really
only applies to him.

389
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:45,905
[Laughter]

390
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:47,964
MAN: That doesn't
sound like Martin.

391
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:50,202
Not.
[Laughter]

392
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:52,604
RUSHDIE: I could be wrong.
What do you think?

393
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:57,048
Uh... do you know...

BRIDGET: Stay calm.
Can't get any worse.

397
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:11,857
What are you doing here?

398
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:15,094
I've been asking myself
the same question.

399
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,159
I came with a colleague.

400
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:18,602
So how are you?

401
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:20,571
Well, apart from being
very disappointed...

402
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:23,666
not to see my favourite
reindeer jumper again...

403
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,006
I'm well.

404
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:26,807
Anyone going to introduce me?

405
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:30,179
BRIDGET: Ah, introduce people
with thoughtful details.

406
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:31,911
Perpetua. Ha.

407
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:33,748
This is Mark Darcy.

408
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:35,879
Mark's a prematurely
middle-aged prick...

409
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:37,684
with a cruel-raced ex-wife.

410
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:39,088
Perpetua's a fat-ass old bag...

411
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:41,024
who spends her time
bossing me around.

412
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:44,592
BRIDGET: Maybe not.

413
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,927
Anyone going to introduce me?

414
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:48,501
BRIDGET: Ah, Perpetua.

Uh, this is Mark Darcy.

Mark's a top barrister.

Oh, he comes from
Garth and Underwood.

418
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,808
Perpetua is one
of my work colleagues.

419
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:59,504
Why, Mark, I know you
by reputation, of course.

420
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,104
Ah, Natasha.

421
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:05,776
MARK: This is Bridget Jones.
Bridget, this is Natasha.

422
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:09,083
Natasha is a top attorney
and specializes in family law.

Bridget works in publishing...

424
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:12,957
and used to play naked
in my paddling pool.

425
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:16,727
- How odd.
- Ha ha.

426
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:18,662
Perpetua,
how's the house hunt going?

427
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:20,255
Disaster.

428
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,563
I oughtn't go into it with you.

429
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:26,560
By the by, that man is gorgeous.

430
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:28,004
Ah, yes, Mark.

431
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,304
Just give me time.
Give me time.

I think I'm gonna have to
take you out to dinner now...

00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:25,043
So how do you feel about
this whole situation...

501
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:26,915
in Chechnya?
Isn’t it a nightmare?

502
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:28,351
I couldn't give a fuck, Jones.

503
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:32,255
Now, look, how do you
know Arsey Darcy?

504
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,226
Apparently, I used
to run 'round naked...

505
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,727
in his paddling pool.

506
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:38,992
I bet you did, you dirty bitch.

507
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:41,124
What about you?

508
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,793
Same. Yeah.

509
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:47,468
No, no, I was best man
at his wedding.

510
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,201
Um, knew him from Cambridge.

511
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:50,469
He was a mate.

512
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:52,477
And then what?

513
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:55,908
And then, uh... nothing.

514
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:58,473
You don't need to protect him.
He's no friend of mine.

515
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:01,042
Well, um, then...

516
00:24:01,086 --> 00:24:03,247
many years later...

517
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:06,815
I made the somewhat
catastrophic mistake...

518
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:11,228
of introducing him
to my fiancée.

519
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,127
And, um...

520
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:22,773
I couldn't say, in all honesty,
I've ever quite forgiven him.

521
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:25,208
God, so...

522
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:28,236
he's a nasty bastard.

523
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,043
And a dull bastard.

524
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:32,277
Yes. Yes,
I think that's fair.

525
00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:35,254
Anyway, fuck him. Listen,
don't let him ruin our evening.

526
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:36,983
Why don't you have
some more wine...

527
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:38,922
and tell me more about
practicing French-kissing...

528
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:40,083
with the other girls
at school...

529
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,217
because that's
a very good story.

530
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,956
- It wasn't French-kissing.
- Don't care. Make it up.

531
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:45,931
That's an order, Jones.

532
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:48,559
DANIEL: So, um, how about
a drink at my place?

533
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:51,065

no funny business...

00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:53,071

535
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,800
No, no, no.

536
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:57,934
I should get a taxi.

537
00:24:57,976 --> 00:25:01,139
But thank you
for the lovely dinner.

538
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:06,376
It's a pleasure, Jones.

540
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,449

541
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:17,462
Oh

Ooh

543
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:24,892
You're alone

544
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:26,962
All the time

545
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:30,270
Does it ever puzzle you

546
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:34,006
Have you asked why you seem

547
00:25:36,415 --> 00:25:38,542
And out again

548
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:42,384
Do you really ever love

549
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,082
Or just pretend

550
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:45,589
Oh, baby

551
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:48,593
Why fool yourself?

552
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:52,290
Don't be afraid
to help yourself

DANIEL: Now these are very
silly little boots, Jones.

554
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:58,895
And this is a very
silly little dress.

555
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:00,564
And, um...

556
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:03,175
these are, uh...

557
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:06,008

absolutely enormous panties.

558
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:07,636
Jesus. Fuck.

559
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:09,837
No, no, don't apologize.
I like them.

560
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:12,442
Hello, Mummy.

561
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:15,647
ROSEYSINGING: Love

562
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:17,185
I'm sorry, I have to have
another look.

563
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:19,019
- They're too good to be true.
- No.

564
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:20,192
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

565
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:21,557
I'm wearing something
quite similar myself.

566
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:25,188
- Here, I'll show you.
- No. No.

This time decide

568
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:30,301
That you will open up

569
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:32,871
Let it in

570
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:35,669
There's no shame
in sharin' love

571
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:39,435
You feel within

572
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:42,174
So jump right in

573
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:44,944
Head over heels

574
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:47,008
And fall right in

575
00:26:47,085 --> 00:26:48,313
Ha. Huh.

576
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:49,581
That was fantastic.

577
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:51,612
Ohh. Mmm.

578
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:53,225
Ay, ay.

579
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:55,022
BRIDGET: Ohh. Daniel.

580
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,186
Yeah?

581
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:58,696
What happens at the office?

582
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:00,694
Oh. Well,
I'm glad you asked that.

583
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:03,527
You see,
it's a publishing house.

584
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:05,570
So that means that people
write things for us...

585
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,197
and then we print out
all the pages...

586
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,466
and fasten them together...

587
00:27:08,507 --> 00:27:10,407
and make them into what
we call a book, Jones.

588
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:14,936
No, do you think
people will notice?

589
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,174
Notice what?

590
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:19,342
Us. Working together,
sleeping together.

591
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:20,544
Hang on a minute, Jones.

592
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:23,918
Just slow down.
It started on Tuesday...

593
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:25,514
and now it's Thursday.

594
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:27,548
It's not exactly...

595
00:27:27,592 --> 00:27:30,390
um, a long-term relationship,
is it?

596
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:34,024

between her thighs.

604
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:52,378
Mum. Hi.

605
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,510
BRIDGET: It's the truth
universally acknowledged...

606
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:58,216
that the moment one area
of your life starts going OK...

607
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:02,317
another part of it falls
spectacularly to pieces.

608
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:04,488
PAMELA: Ah, anyone else want
to have it off?

609
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,394
Haha. Don't be shy, madame.

610

French. Have it oeuf. Ha ha!
With the wisecrack egg peeler.

611
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:16,273
Now, nice firm grip.

612
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:20,409
Put it in the hole. And...

613
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:22,970
up, down, up, down.

614
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:25,006
And off it comes in your hand.

615
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:30,755
Oh! Mind the over-spray.
Sorry.

616
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:34,357
Darling, if I came in
with my knickers on my head...

617
00:28:34,393 --> 00:28:35,792
he wouldn't notice.

618
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:38,326
I spent thirty-five years
cleaning his house...

619
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:40,593
washing his clothes,
bringing up his children.

620
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:42,793
I'm your child, too.

621
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:44,298
To be honest, darling,
having children...

622
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:46,133
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

623
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,639
Given my chance again,
I'm not sure I'd have any.

624
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:51,039
MUM: And now it's
the winter of my life...

625
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:53,340
and I haven't actually
got anything of my own.

626
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:57,075
I've got no power,
no real career...

627
00:28:57,115 --> 00:28:59,379
no... no sex life.

628
00:28:59,418 --> 00:29:01,215
I've got no life at all.

629

I'm like the grasshopper
who sang all summer.

630
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:05,050
I'm like Germaine sodding Geer.

632
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,187
Well, anyway, I'm not having it.
And I've been talent spotted.

633
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:13,026
Julian thinks
I've got great potential.

634
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:14,327
Who's Julian?

635
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:16,266

As a demonstrator
on his cable show.

You know, his assistant.

640
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:26,607
Apparently, it's the highest-
Rated show on the channel.

641
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,044
Well, apart from the one...

00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:12,388
is this absolutely stunning...

and earring set.

Just over a centimetre...

two pairs in lapis lazuli...

could be a golden opportunity.

If you spent the entire party
flirting with other women...

673

00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:20,412
lies in the deposition
they made on August30.

711
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:21,845
BRIDGET: Season of mist...

712
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,745
and...

713
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:25,579
mellow fruitlessness.

714
00:33:25,617 --> 00:33:27,448
Oh, fuck me, I love Keats.

715
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:28,918
Have you heard this one?

716
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:31,012
"There was a young woman
from Ealing...

717
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:33,957
"who had a peculiar feeling.

718
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:36,790
"She lay on her back
and opened her crack...

719
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,557
"and pissed
all over the ceiling."

720
00:33:38,596 --> 00:33:39,722
[Bang]
Oh, bollocks.

721
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:41,732
BRIDGET: What've you done?

722
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,667
- I'm boarding you, Bridge.
- Don't you dare!

723
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:47,536
- I'm king of the world!
- No!

724
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:49,802
Fuck me. Uhh!

725
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:51,433
BRIDGET: Aah!

726
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:54,309
[Bridget laughs]

727
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:56,007
DANIEL: Oh, piss and bollocks.

728
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:57,810
You stupid ass.

729
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:00,340
[Laughing]

730
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:02,080
Bollocks.

731
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,644
All right.

732
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:05,657
Aah! No!

733
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:07,124
So childish.

734
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:09,350
BRIDGET: Aah! No!

735
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:10,827
Yes.

736
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:13,023
DANIEL:
Hey, Darce, come on in!

737
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:14,929
The water's lovely!

738
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:16,593
Come on, you're working
too hard, mate.

739
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:17,794
Ha ha!

740
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:22,340
- Daniel.
- Yes, Bridget?

741
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,864
That thing you just did
is actually illegal...

742
00:34:23,908 --> 00:34:25,068
in several countries.

743
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,975
Well, that is, of course,
the major reason...

744
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:29,138
I'm so thrilled to be
living in Britain today.

745
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:31,542
Yes. I can't understand...

746
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,608
why the Prime Minister
doesn't mention it more...

747
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:34,913
in his speeches.

748
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:36,887
You should write
to him about it.

749
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:38,149
BRIDGET: I intend to.

750
00:34:41,526 --> 00:34:43,653
Daniel.

751
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:44,787
DANIEL: Bridget.

752
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:47,957
- Do you love me?
- Shut up, or I'll do it again.

753
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:51,659
Do you love me?

754
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:53,364
Right. You asked for it.

755
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:56,670
DANIEL: And over we go.

756
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:58,073
I'm going to give you
something to bite on.

757
00:34:58,109 --> 00:34:59,736
Here.

758
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:02,178
OK? Pop this in your mouth,
darling.

759
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,507
[Bridget laughs]

760
00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:05,675
You're begging for it.

761
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:06,911
[Bridget laughs]

762
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:08,646
BRIDGET: Stop it.

763
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:10,654
[Laughs]

764
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:13,122
No, no.

765
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:22,025
Hmm.

766
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:27,504
I got to go back to town.
A meeting's come up.

767
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:28,972
On a Sunday?

768
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:30,474
DANIEL: No. The meeting's
first thing tomorrow.

769
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:32,476
I've got to work
on some figures.

770
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:37,413
We could just pop
into the party for a minute.

771
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:38,973
DANIEL: Bridget,
I'm really sorry.

772
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:42,578
I just can't do it.
I've got to head back.

773
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,087
Listen, Daniel...

774
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:47,558
if you've changed your mind,
you could just say so...

775
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:49,924
because, honestly, I don't see
what could be so important.

776
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:52,225
No, well, you wouldn't,
would you?

777
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,091
Because you don't have
the faintest bloody idea...

778
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:57,431
of just how much trouble
the company's in.

779
00:35:57,469 --> 00:35:58,902
You swan in
in your short skirt...

780
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:00,837
and your sexy
see-through blouse...

781
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:02,567
and fanny around
with press releases.

782
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:04,006
You know, this is
the Americans flying in...

783
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:05,737
because they're thinking
of shutting us down...

784
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:07,108
for fuck's sake.

785
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:11,743
Sorry.

786
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:15,583
I'm sorry, Bridge.
I know I'm being a prat.

787
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:25,486
Look, I'm going
to arrange a lovely car...

788
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,191
to come and pick you up
and take you back...

789
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:28,824
to London after the party, OK?

790
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:30,960
If you have to travel alone,
travel in style.

791
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:33,027
Hmm.

792
00:36:33,071 --> 00:36:35,062
And, um...

793
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:36,971
I also think
it's very important...

794
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:40,205
that you win
this costume competition.

795
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:43,074
Good.

796
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:44,672
Good start.

797
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:49,178
Now, then, Miss Jones,
where does this go?

798
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:55,493
BRIDGET:
Oh, well, here we go.

799
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:57,017
Trying hard
to fight off a vision...

800
00:36:57,061 --> 00:37:00,258
of Mum and Auntie Una
in fishnet tights.

801
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:03,825
Seems unnatural, wrong even,
for60-year-olds to dress up...

802
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:06,701
as prostitutes and priests
on a Sunday afternoon.

803
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:08,797
[People chattering]

804
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,171
[Laughter]

805
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,869
JULIELONDONSINGING:
Fly me to the moon

806
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,901
BRIDGET: Oh, holy Jesus.

807
00:37:15,313 --> 00:37:16,974
Bridget.

808
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:19,279
Where are all the other
tarts and vicars?

809
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:20,818
UNA: Oh, dear.
Didn't Geoffrey call you?

810
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:22,809
Didn't you telephone
Colin and Bridget?

811
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:24,719
How's my little Bridget?

812
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:25,882
GEOFFREY: Bop, bop.

813
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:27,289
Oh.

814
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:28,622
Geoffrey.

815
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,651
So, where's this chap
of yours, then, eh?

816
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:32,253
Ah, yes, well,
he had to work, so...

817
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:34,288
Ha! A likely tale.

818
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:36,124
Off they run. Whee!

819
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,930
[Laughs weakly]

820
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:39,732
JULIELONDONSINGING:
You are all I long for

821
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:43,002
Bizarre what some men
find attractive.

822
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,134
Oh, God.

823
00:37:45,176 --> 00:37:47,667
MUM: Darling!
Geoffrey!

824
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:49,270
What on earth are you wearing?

825
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:51,282
You look like
a common prostitute.

826
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,147
Yes, well, that was,
actually, the point.

827
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:54,344
Say hi to Julian.

828
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:56,577
Hello, Julian.

829
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:57,815
My dear...

830
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,914
you and your mother
could be sisters.

831
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:03,284
JULIAN:
And what a lovely bracelet.

832
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:05,057
It's what I call
an all-arounder...

833
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:08,065
the sort of thing one can wear
with anything to any occasion.

834
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,828
Oh.

835
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:11,698
Have you spoken to my dad?

836
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:14,330
Yes. He's behaving
most bizarrely.

837
00:38:14,372 --> 00:38:15,896
I think he was actually
trying to flirt...

838
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,340
with Penny Husbands-Bosworth,
poor thing.

839
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:19,809
She was very frightened.

840
00:38:19,844 --> 00:38:21,709
She's only just had
her ovaries done.

841
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:28,183
I don't know what
you ever saw in him.

842
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:30,278
Shh. Bad man.
[Both laugh]

843
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:36,787
[Breathes deeply]

844
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:37,954
[Footsteps]

845
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:39,793
Heh heh.

846
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:41,822
Didn't tell you, either.

847
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:44,733
[Laughs]

848
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:46,999
No. I didn't spend as much
as Bernard, thank God.

849
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:53,069
BRIDGET: Oh.

850
00:38:54,278 --> 00:38:55,711
I'm sorry, Dad.

851
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:57,840
The way she looked at me.

852
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,918
Well, she loves you, really.

853
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:03,079
You love each other.

854
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:04,418
This is only a temporary glitch.

855
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:06,290
Is it?

856
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,622
I don't know.

857
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,651
DAD: I don't know.

858
00:39:13,965 --> 00:39:15,933
UNA: Ah, Bridget, there you are.

859
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:17,229
Don't worry.
You're not the only one.

860
00:39:17,268 --> 00:39:19,862
This is Penny. Geoffrey didn't
get in touch with her, either.

861
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:21,098
I'm sorry?

862
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:22,970
I was just saying Geoffrey
didn't contact you, either...

863
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:24,406
to tell you that
the Tarts and Vicars concept...

864
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:25,870
had gone out of the window.

865
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,810
Oh, yes, he did.

866
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:29,039
Oh, right.

867
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,775
Lovely dress.

868
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:32,339
Very exotic.

869
00:39:35,953 --> 00:39:37,784
What a shame you couldn't
bring your boyfriend, Bridget.

870
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:39,153
What's his name?
David? Darren?

871
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,680
MARK: Daniel Cleaver.

872
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:42,454
Oh. Is he a friend
of yours, Mark?

873
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,888
Absolutely not.

874
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:46,294
I hope he's good enough
for our little Bridget.

875
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,356
I think I can say with
total confidence absolutely not.

876
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,300
Well, I'm sure he'd say
the same about you...

877
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:53,030
given your past behaviour.

878
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:54,436
Sorry?

879
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:56,064
I think you know what I mean.

880
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:57,267
Mark.

881
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:13,320
BRIDGET: Hmm.
Looks like Auntie Shirley...

882
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:16,155
didn't get the message, either.

883
00:40:18,763 --> 00:40:20,754
[Doorbell rings]

884
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:25,495
Hi.

885
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:29,969
I really, really wanted
to see a friendly face.

886
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:31,736
Oh, now, listen,
I'll tell you what.

887
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:34,712
I have an idea.
Let me finish this...

No, no, I'm sorry...

902
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:18,856

a hell of a lot of work done.

903
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,858
Just give me one more hour, OK?

904

Fine. That's fine.

when I said that I loved you?

908
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,464
Mm-hmm.

909
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:35,062
I didn't mean it.

910
00:41:35,106 --> 00:41:36,095
I was being ironic.

it's got to be
something extraordinary...

Just a little bit

1070
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,438
I get tired

1071
00:50:38,482 --> 00:50:40,074
But keep on tryin'

1072

OK, everybody,
it is bonfire night...

1077
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:51,954
and we are on fire.

1078
00:50:51,995 --> 00:50:53,895
RICHARD: We have live
fire station feeds...

1079
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:58,425
from Newcastle, Swansea,
Sheffield, and Lewisham...

1080
00:50:58,469 --> 00:51:00,130
just poised for tragedy.

1081
00:51:00,337 --> 00:51:02,532
Bridget Jones, where are you?

1082
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:05,635
I'm here, Richard.

1083
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:07,803
Put on some more makeup.
I want you on-camera.

1084
00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:08,971
But...

1085
00:51:09,012 --> 00:51:10,981
RICHARD:
I'm thinking... miniskirt.

1086
00:51:10,981 --> 00:51:12,608
I'm thinking fireman's helmet.

1087
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:14,480
I want you pointing a hose.

1088
00:51:14,518 --> 00:51:15,853
I want you
sliding down the pole...

1089
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:17,377
and then go straight
into the interview.

1090
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:19,685
Great.

1091
00:51:19,723 --> 00:51:21,452
I'll do it.

1092
00:51:23,694 --> 00:51:25,127
No problem. Fine. Right.

00:51:25,162 --> 00:51:26,697
So, you drop into shot...

1094
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:27,857

NEVILLE: Oh, no.
We're going to Newcastle first.

Stop!

1100
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:38,872
Climb back up.

1101

1102
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:41,839

the fuck is going on?

1105
00:51:46,683 --> 00:51:47,911
She's supposed to be
Sliding down the pole...

1106
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:50,112
- not climbing up it.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1107
00:51:50,154 --> 00:51:51,644
Oh, OK.

1108
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:54,850
- Oh!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

1109
00:51:54,892 --> 00:51:57,417
Uhh! Uhh!

1110
00:51:57,461 --> 00:51:58,485
OK, we're out of time.
We're out of time.

1111
00:51:58,529 --> 00:51:59,930
RICHARD: Just wind 'er up.

1112
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:03,195
Well, that seems to be
about all we've got time for...

1113
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,061
down here in Lewisham.

1114
00:52:05,102 --> 00:52:08,902
Uh, Chief Officer Bevan,
Thank you very much.

1115
00:52:08,939 --> 00:52:10,736
Excellent fire station.

BRIDGET: Whoo!

1119
00:52:16,747 --> 00:52:18,612
Whoo!

oh, God.

1127
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:34,190
I'm having dinner
with Magda and Jeremy.

1128
00:52:34,231 --> 00:52:37,100
The only thing worse
than a smug married couple...

1129
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:40,035
lots of smug married couples.

1130
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,664
Right, everyone.
This is Bridget.

1131
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:45,668

This is Natasha Glenville
and Mark Darcy.

1140
00:52:59,656 --> 00:53:00,782
Hi, there.

1141
00:53:00,824 --> 00:53:02,189
Hello.

1142
00:53:02,226 --> 00:53:04,194
Not in your bunny girl
Out fit today?

1143
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:05,593
BRIDGET: No.

1144
00:53:05,629 --> 00:53:10,267
We bunnies only wear our tails
on very special occasions.

1145
00:53:10,267 --> 00:53:12,599
- Sit yourself down.
- Right.

1146
00:53:15,706 --> 00:53:18,766
Hey, Bridge,
how's your love life?

1147

in the office ink.

1152
00:53:29,186 --> 00:53:30,676

COSMO: You really
Ought to hurry up...

1154
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:34,583
and get spruggedup,
you know, old girl?

Time's a-running out.
Tick-tock.

1156
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:40,152
Yes, yes.

1157
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:42,631
Uh, tell me, is it
one in four marriages...

1158
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,634
that ends in divorce now
or one in three?

1159
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:45,965
One in three.

1160
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,267
COSMO: Seriously, though.

1161

in their thirties...

fine physical specimens...

1163
00:53:54,144 --> 00:53:57,272
but they just can't seem
to hold down a chap.

00:53:57,314... > 00:53:58,781
WONEY: Yes. Why is it...

1164
00:53:58,815 --> 00:54:00,783
there are so many unmarried
women in their thirties...

1165
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:01,943
these days, Bridget?

Oh, I don't know.

Suppose it doesn't help
that underneath our clothes...

1170
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:15,823
our entire bodies
are covered in scales.

your Lewis hamfire report,
by the way.

1174
00:54:33,884 --> 00:54:35,351
Thank you.

1175
00:54:38,922 --> 00:54:40,981
I just...

1176
00:54:41,024 --> 00:54:42,651
yeah, well.

1177
00:54:44,194 --> 00:54:45,627
So.

1178
00:54:46,697 --> 00:54:47,959
It didn't work out
with Daniel Cleaver?

1179
00:54:47,998 --> 00:54:50,159
No, it didn't.

1180
00:54:51,702 --> 00:54:52,964
I'm delighted to hear it.

1181

Look, are you and Cosmo
in this together?

1182
00:54:57,774 --> 00:54:59,332
I mean, you seem
to go out of your way...

1183
00:54:59,376 --> 00:55:01,640
to try to make me feel
like a complete idiot...

1184
00:55:01,678 --> 00:55:06,581
every time I see you,
and you really needn't bother.

1185
00:55:06,617 --> 00:55:10,951
I already feel like an idiot
most of the time anyway...

Look, um...

1191
00:55:21,732 --> 00:55:24,724
I'm sorry if I've been...

1192
00:55:24,768 --> 00:55:25,996
What?

1193
00:55:26,036 --> 00:55:29,938
I don't think
you're an idiot at all.

1194
00:55:29,973 --> 00:55:33,966
I mean, there are elements
of the ridiculous about you.

1195
00:55:34,011 --> 00:55:36,279
Your mother's
pretty interesting.

1196
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:37,610
And you really are...

1197
00:55:37,648 --> 00:55:39,639
an appallingly bad
public speaker.

1198
00:55:39,683 --> 00:55:41,947
And you tend to let
whatever's in your head...

1199
00:55:41,985 --> 00:55:43,247
come out of your mouth...

1200
00:55:43,286 --> 00:55:46,653
without much consideration
of the consequences.

1201
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:49,989
I realize that when I met you
At the turkey curry buffet...

1202
00:55:50,027 --> 00:55:54,896
that I was unforgivably rude
and wearing a reindeer jumper...

1203
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:57,161
that my mother had
given me the day before.

1204
00:55:58,402 --> 00:56:00,427
But the thing is, um...

1205
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:05,165
what I'm trying to say
very inarticulately is...

1206
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:08,270
that, um...

1207
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:10,006
in fact...

1208
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:13,278
perhaps, despite appearances...

1209
00:56:13,316 --> 00:56:16,046
I like you very much.

1210
00:56:16,086 --> 00:56:19,317
Ah. Apart from the smoking
and the drinking...

1211
00:56:19,356 --> 00:56:22,189
and the vulgar mother
and the verbal diarrhea.

1212
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:26,161
No. I like you very much...
just as you are.

1213
00:56:27,864 --> 00:56:31,459
Mark, we really are making
progress on the case in here.

the most brilliant idea.

Right.

1217

from an extradition order...

It's like you said.

1589
01:13:30,886 --> 01:13:34,322
I'm still looking
for something...

1590
01:13:34,356 --> 01:13:36,449

well, close up,
he was almost purple.

1615
01:15:12,454 --> 01:15:16,049
You were such
a lovely normal colour.

1616
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:19,959
He had a filthy temper.

1617

the jewellery is fabulous...

1618

and really very
reasonably priced and...

1619
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:29,528
I thought I might ask if...

1620
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:33,531
we could have another go.

1621

I mean, obviously,
with some effort on your part...

to me.

what I'm like sometimes.

It doesn't help
that you and Bridget...

a bad time of year for him.

so strangely around him...

quite rightly.

of your sideburns.

01:32:20,415 --> 01:32:23,976
ROBBIE WILLIAMS SINGING:
Have you met Miss Jones?

1943
01:32:24,018 --> 01:32:27,579
Someone said as we shook hands

1944
01:32:27,622 --> 01:32:31,490
She was just Miss Jones

1945
01:32:31,526 --> 01:32:34,256
To me

1946
01:32:36,064 --> 01:32:39,056
And now I've met Miss Jones

1947
01:32:40,335 --> 01:32:43,065
And we'll keep on meeting

1948
01:32:43,104 --> 01:32:46,073
Till we're done

1949
01:32:46,107 --> 01:32:48,473
Miss Jones and I

1950
01:32:50,945 --> 01:32:52,276
Whoa, fellas

1951
01:33:21,142 --> 01:33:23,269
And all at once

1952
01:33:23,344 --> 01:33:25,175
I lost my breath

1953
01:33:25,213 --> 01:33:27,238
And all at once

1954
01:33:27,282 --> 01:33:29,250
Was scared to death

1955
01:33:29,284 --> 01:33:31,047
And all at once

1956
01:33:31,085 --> 01:33:34,179
I owned the earth

1957
01:33:34,222 --> 01:33:36,383
And sky

1958
01:33:38,493 --> 01:33:42,554
Now l’ve met Miss Jones

1959
01:33:42,597 --> 01:33:45,691
And we'll keep on meeting

1960
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:48,892
Till we're done

1961
01:33:48,937 --> 01:33:51,337
Miss Jones and I

1962
01:33:52,941 --> 01:33:55,273
Miss Jones and I

1963
01:33:56,711 --> 01:34:04,447
Miss Jones and I

1964
01:34:08,222 --> 01:34:09,951
How!

1965
01:34:09,991 --> 01:34:13,392
SHELBY LYNNE SINGING: I didn't
mean to hurt your feelings

1966
01:34:13,428 --> 01:34:15,658
It was so careless of me

1967
01:34:17,632 --> 01:34:20,965
I guess I've gone and done it

1968
01:34:21,002 --> 01:34:23,232
It's just a matter of time

1969
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:26,402
Nothing I can do

1970
01:34:26,441 --> 01:34:28,671
But tell you l’m sorry

1971
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:35,741
And that's the hardest part
of all

1972
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:43,482
'Cause your love's
the killin' kind

1973
01:34:43,524 --> 01:34:51,488
Your love's the killin' kind

1974
01:34:51,532 --> 01:34:53,659
Yeah

1975
01:34:53,701 --> 01:34:56,261
I'd rather walk on glass

1976
01:34:56,304 --> 01:35:01,469
Than see teardrops in your eyes

1977
01:35:01,509 --> 01:35:03,773
And l’d fall to pieces

1978
01:35:03,978 --> 01:35:05,673
Just to hold you

1979
01:35:05,713 --> 01:35:08,341
The best thing in my life

1980
01:35:08,383 --> 01:35:12,513
And it's just luck
I get to love you

1981
01:35:12,553 --> 01:35:16,216
You're the one thing
that's right

1982
01:35:16,257 --> 01:35:20,216
You're the light
in my hell's darkness

1983
01:35:20,261 --> 01:35:27,724
'Cause your love's
the killin' kind

1984
01:35:27,769 --> 01:35:35,642
Your love's the killin' kind

1985
01:35:35,676 --> 01:35:37,371
Oh, yeah

1986
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:41,205
I just might cry now

1987
01:35:41,249 --> 01:35:42,716
Lie

1988
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:45,014
Lay down and die now

1989
01:35:46,487 --> 01:35:48,682
You've done it to me

1990
01:35:50,191 --> 01:35:54,560
You're puttin' me under

1991
01:35:54,595 --> 01:35:57,086
I close my eyes at night

1992
01:35:57,131 --> 01:35:59,333
Sittin' under sky

1993
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:02,496
I love you and all is pleasures

1994
01:36:02,537 --> 01:36:04,334
Baby, feels so right

1995
01:36:04,372 --> 01:36:09,332
My arms won't be
of any use at all

1996
01:36:09,377 --> 01:36:13,711
If I can't hold you

1997
01:36:13,748 --> 01:36:21,450
'Cause your love's
the killin' kind

1998
01:36:21,489 --> 01:36:25,448
Your love's the killin' kind

1999
01:36:25,493 --> 01:36:27,461
[New song begins]

2000
01:36:33,868 --> 01:36:37,599
ROBBIE WILLIAMS:
Not of this earth

2001
01:36:39,407 --> 01:36:42,740
You've changed places
with the sun

2002
01:36:45,379 --> 01:36:48,177
I know that you're the one

2003
01:36:50,585 --> 01:36:53,247
I love what we've become

2004
01:36:55,556 --> 01:36:59,686
Not of this earth

2005
01:37:01,162 --> 01:37:04,393
Not surprised we're unashamed

2006
01:37:06,434 --> 01:37:09,597
She's gonna have
to change her name

2007
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:14,665
Then we'll know
they'll be the same

2008
01:37:17,178 --> 01:37:21,581
She's not of this earth

2009
01:37:21,616 --> 01:37:27,316
And I believe
we've seen the worst

2010
01:37:27,355 --> 01:37:31,223
If I ever leave this world

2011
01:37:32,727 --> 01:37:34,786
You will have a song to sing

2012
01:37:34,829 --> 01:37:38,356
So you know what you're worth

2013
01:37:48,242 --> 01:37:52,178
Not of this earth
