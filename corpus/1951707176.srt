00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,600
Don't worry, it's a pack of wolves.
Come on, we're almost rid of it.

3
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,400
- Caleb, it's after me!
- Grab on!

4
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,040
Run! Run!

5
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,480
No, Benjamin, we have to finish this.

6
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,400
Come on, help me bury it.

7
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,200
What if someone digs it up?

8
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,200
May God have mercy on his soul.

9
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,560
- Hi, Alan.
- Hi, Miss Magruder.

10
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,560
- Afternoon, Alan.
- Hey, Frank.

11
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,400
- All yours, Alan.
- Thanks, Bill.

12
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,800
Get him!

13
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,200
Prepare to die, Parrish!

14
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,280
Parrish, what's the rush?

15
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,600
He's going to the factory!

16
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,600
Go on, Parrish! Run to Daddy.

17
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,320
We'll be waiting.

18
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,680
Hi, Carl.

19
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,440
Hey, Alan, my man. I gotta
show you something. Come here.

20
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,760
I've been working on this all year.

21
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,280
I got an appointment
with your father...

22
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,960
...to show him this.
Go ahead, take it.

23
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,840
What do you think?
Think he'll like it?

24
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,800
What is it?

25
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,160
What is it? This is the future.

26
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,080
If Wilt Chamberlain will wear them...

27
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,560
...there'll be a pair of those
in every closet in America.

28
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,120
That will be the height of fashion.

29
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,680
What's wrong?

30
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,800
- Nothing.
- Alan!

31
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,240
What are you doing? This factory
isn't a playground. It's dangerous.

32
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,160
Can I have a ride home?

33
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,400
Is Billy Jessup picking on you again?

34
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,840
Son, you're gonna have
to face him sooner or later.

35
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,640
If you're afraid of something,
you've got to stand and face it.

36
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,680
Now, run on, son.

37
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,560
You know better than
to let the boy play here.

38
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,480
Sorry, sir.

39
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,200
- What was it you wanted to show me?
- Just a minute, sir.

40
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,680
What the devil...?

41
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Who did this?

42
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,320
Well?

43
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,000
I did, sir.

44
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,680
Being a Parrish doesn't mean
you can hang around with my girl.

45
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,440
We're just friends.

46
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,160
Not anymore.

47
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,200
Get him!

48
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,960
I've got his bike!

49
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,400
Jerks!

50
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Neat.

51
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,360
Alan?

52
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Are you home?

53
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,000
Alan, not again. Come on.

54
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,160
Hard work, determination,
cheerful outlook...

55
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,920
...attributes that exemplify
Brantford spirit...

56
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,560
...since our forefathers
first settled this town.

57
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,680
Despite the harshness of our native
clime and granite of our soil...

58
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,680
...we have...

59
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,480
- Prospered.
- I knew it all this morning.

60
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,520
You'll know it all tonight.

61
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,160
- Right. Let's go.
- Sam, we have to talk to Alan.

62
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,680
Well, we're on our way.

63
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,920
I told your father what you told me,
that it wasn't just Billy Jessup.

64
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,360
- Lf I'd known that, I wouldn't have...
- It's okay, Dad.

65
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,920
But I'm proud of you. You faced them,
even though you were outnumbered.

66
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,880
Since you took it like a man,
your mother and I have decided...

67
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,800
...that you're ready to go
to The Cliffside School for Boys.

68
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,080
Congratulations, sweetheart.

69
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,000
You don't want me living here anymore?

70
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,840
It's always been the plan
that you go to Cliffside.

71
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,120
I mean, Parrishes have been going
to Cliffside ever since the 1700s.

72
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,120
Even your Uncle Skylar went there.

73
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,920
Look at this. Parrish Hall?

74
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,080
It's the main dormitory.

75
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,880
This is great. Kids are on my case
here because I'm a Parrish.

76
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,480
Just wait till I'm living
in a building named after me.

77
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,760
It was named after my father.

78
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,120
Good. Why don't you live in it?

79
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,960
I did. I wouldn't be who I am
if it weren't for my years there.

80
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,360
Maybe I don't want to be who you are.

81
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Maybe I don't even want
to be a Parrish.

82
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,440
You won't be.
Not till you start acting like one.

83
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,800
- Sam...
- Get your coat.

84
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,760
I guess I'm not ready
for Cliffside, then.

85
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,520
We're taking you there next Sunday.
I don't want to hear another word!

86
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,000
You won't!
I'm never talking to you again!

87
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,760
- Sam...
- Don't.

88
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,080
- Sam.
- What?

89
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,040
Nothing.

90
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,440
Why are you here?

91
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,960
I brought your bike.

92
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,280
You didn't have to. I was going
to Billy's to get it myself.

93
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,960
I told Billy to stop picking on you.

94
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,240
You wasted your breath.
We'll talk about it some other time.

95
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,200
What was that?

96
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,760
You heard it too?

97
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,160
Of course I heard it.

98
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,440
Come on, I found this really
weird game in the factory.

99
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,600
A game?

100
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,920
"Jumanji.

101
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,360
A game for those who seek to find
a way to leave their world behind.

102
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,040
You roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles gets another turn.

103
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,520
The first to reach the end wins."
You want to play?

104
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,120
I quit playing board games
five years ago.

105
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,000
Sarah!

106
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,560
It's gotta be magnetized or something.

107
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,280
Alan, look.

108
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,400
"At night they fly,
you better run.

109
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,000
These winged things are not much fun."

110
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,360
What was that?

111
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,880
I don't know.

112
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,560
- Put it away, Alan.
- Okay.

113
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,480
Oh, no.

114
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,760
The game thinks I rolled.

115
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,680
What do you mean, "the game thinks"?

116
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,440
"In the jungle you must wait...

117
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,800
...until the dice read five or eight."

118
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,040
In the jungle you must wait?
What does that mean?

119
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,240
A bed and breakfast is just
what this town needs.

120
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,400
It was pretty hard to pass up.
Especially full of furniture.

121
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,040
I keep forgetting
how big this place is.

122
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,680
Judy, Peter, come look at this.

123
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,480
I'm gonna put a reception area
right over here.

124
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,200
And a bar over here in the parlour.

125
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,360
That sounds lovely.

126
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,800
I'm sure you and your kids
will be very happy here.

127
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,720
Actually, they're my late brother's.

128
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,080
He and his wife passed away
just last winter.

129
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,720
Is this something, or what?

130
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,920
It sure is.

131
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,400
What do you think?
Is it big enough for you?

132
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,600
Peter hasn't spoken a word
since it happened.

133
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,160
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.
How terribly awful.

134
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,440
It's okay.

135
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,840
We barely even knew our parents.
They were always away.

136
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,160
Skiing in St. Moritz,
gambling in Monte Carlo...

137
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,680
...safariing in darkest Africa.

138
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,080
We didn't even know
if they loved us.

139
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,160
But when the sheik's yacht went down...

140
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,960
...they managed to write
a beautiful goodbye note...

141
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,680
...that was found floating in
a champagne bottle amongst the debris.

142
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,440
Excuse me.

143
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,240
They were very devoted parents.
It was a car crash in Canada.

144
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,880
- You'll send me the escrow papers?
- First thing tomorrow.

145
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,720
I'll have to get
a locksmith for this one.

146
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,200
Peter, pick up your toys, please.

147
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,080
Peter, take this suitcase
up to the attic.

148
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,000
Then we can all have ice cream.
And bourbon.

149
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,120
What? What is it?

150
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,080
I'm going to Motel 6.

151
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,600
Oh, for heaven's sake.

152
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,200
I don't see any guano.

153
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,960
He said it looked like that.

154
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,440
That's an African bat. Some kid said
she saw some back in the '60s...

155
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,440
...but we don't get bats
like that in New England.

156
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,840
That's what he saw.

157
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,440
Well, whatever it was, it's gone now.

158
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,720
Bats aren't what I'd worry about
in this house, anyways.

159
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,400
What would you worry about?

160
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
Well, personally...

161
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,200
...I wouldn't want to live
where someone was murdered.

162
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,120
- Murdered?
- Yep.

163
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,880
Little Alan Parrish.
I say his father did it.

164
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,040
There's 1001 places he could've
hid the body in this house.

165
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,080
Especially if he chopped it up first.

166
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,960
Hey up there!

167
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,600
You don't want to be late
for your first day of school.

168
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,520
- Not a bat in sight, ma'am.
- Hear that?

169
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,800
There's nothing to be afraid of
in this house.

170
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,720
I can't believe I have to see
your principal after your first day.

171
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,960
What am I gonna do?

172
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,440
Let's try to relax and finish dinner.
Talk about something else.

173
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
We know why you got the house cheap.

174
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,960
Twenty-six years ago, a kid
named Alan Parrish lived here.

175
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,640
One day he just disappeared.

176
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,240
His parents chopped him up
and hid him in the walls.

177
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,520
That's it. I'm sick and tired
of your lies. You're grounded.

178
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,840
Fine, there's nowhere to go
in this stupid town anyway.

179
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,200
Just for your information,
that wasn't a lie.

180
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,440
Did you hear anything?

181
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,880
Do you miss Mom and Dad?

182
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,560
No.

183
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,440
Liar.

184
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,440
Cut that out,
or they'll send you to a shrink.

185
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,440
Where are they gonna send you
if you don't start talking?

186
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,760
If I get held up
at the permit office, I'll call.

187
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,800
The school bus will be here
any minute.

188
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,360
You guys still have your keys?

189
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,840
You guys listening to me?

190
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,600
Hello?

191
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,040
What?

192
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,840
Maybe I should wait
till the bus comes.

193
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,160
Did your parents
used to put you on the bus?

194
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,720
No.

195
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Are you sure?

196
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,680
I could drop you off.

197
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,920
No, don't worry about us.
The bus will be here any minute.

198
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,000
Okay. Please be good today.

199
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,320
You do hear it.

200
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,600
Hear what?

201
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,000
Where is it coming from?

202
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,800
Let's bring it over here.

203
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,920
Weird. They're stuck.

204
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,240
"Jumanji, a game for those who seek
to leave their worlds behind.

205
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,880
Roll the dice to move.
Doubles get another turn.

206
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,600
The first player
to reach the end wins."

207
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,440
It's gotta be microchips
or something.

208
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,000
You go first.

209
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,560
Six.

210
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,120
"A tiny bite can make you itch,
make you sneeze, make you twitch."

211
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,800
Don't!

212
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,720
"This will not be an easy mission.
Monkeys slow the expedition."

213
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,240
What is that?

214
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,960
I bet those monkeys came from the game.

215
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,400
The mosquitoes too.

216
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,800
I didn't see this part.

217
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,600
"Adventurers, beware."

218
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,320
"Adventurers, beware. Do not begin
unless you intend to finish.

219
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,200
The consequences of the game vanish
when a player has reached Jumanji...

220
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,120
...and called out its name."

221
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
- The monkeys are gone.
- Good.

222
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,440
- Put it away.
- Wait!

223
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,040
If we finish the game,
it'll all go away.

224
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,320
Let's do it
or Aunt Nora'll pitch a fit.

225
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:00,200
We should get through it quickly.
I mean, there's no skill involved.

226
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
No, you rolled doubles.

227
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,720
You get another turn. Roll!

228
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,560
Five.

229
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,280
"His fangs are sharp.
He likes your taste.

230
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,960
Your party better move posthaste."

231
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,720
I don't like the sound of that.

232
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,520
Someone's in here.

233
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,160
It's not real, Peter.
It's a hallucination.

234
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Run, Peter!

235
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,040
I'm back.

236
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,800
My bike.

237
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,720
Somebody roll a five or an eight?

238
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,600
He did.

239
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,400
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

240
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,880
Sorry if I scared you.
Sorry if I scared you.

241
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,520
I'm back!

242
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,520
Mom! Dad!

243
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,160
I'm home!

244
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,880
I'm back!

245
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,920
It's me!
It's me, Alan, Mom and Dad!

246
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,640
I'm home! I'm back!

247
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,240
Are you my little sister?

248
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,760
No, I'm Judy and he's Peter.

249
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,240
Where's Mom? Is Dad at the factory?

250
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,120
Are you...

251
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,080
...Alan Parrish?

252
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,520
Yeah. Who are you?

253
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,040
We live here now.

254
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,480
Where's my mom and dad?

255
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,960
We don't know.

256
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,320
This house has been empty for years.

257
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,200
Everyone thought you were dead.

258
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,240
Sorry.

259
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,240
- Give me that description again.
-Red fur and tails.

260
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:05,600
Get down off of my car, please,
and get up on the sidewalk.

261
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,080
- What year is it?
- It was brand-new.

262
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:15,120
- No. What year is it?
- 1995, remember?

263
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,400
You got some I.D.? Let me guess,
it's in your other Tarzan outfit.

264
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,200
- 26 years.
- Are you from around here?

265
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,520
I was. But I've been in Jumanji.

266
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,800
Indonesia.
He was in the Peace Corps.

267
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,320
- Carl Bentley, the sole man.
- Is this man related to you?

268
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,720
- Yes, he's our uncle.
- Does he always dress like that?

269
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,360
Yeah, he's a vegetarian.

270
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,800
Get out of there!

271
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,280
Monkeys. Monkeys.

272
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,000
Is he all right upstairs?

273
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,680
He suffered a head injury
a few months ago.

274
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,520
Don't you move!

275
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,040
- Stop!
- Don't move, don't move.

276
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,960
Wait! Where are you going?

277
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,480
To find my parents!

278
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,400
Come on.

279
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,400
Wait!

280
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,680
My dad used to make shoes here.

281
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,800
They were the best shoes
in New England.

282
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,960
Sorry.

283
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,400
Easy, girl.

284
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,560
Do you know what happened
to the shoe factory?

285
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,240
Yeah, it folded up.
Like everything else in this town.

286
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,920
It's pretty cold out there.
How about some coffee?

287
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,480
Why would they close Parrish Shoes?

288
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,960
When his kid ran away, Sam put
everything he had into finding him.

289
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,960
His time, his money...

290
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,960
Everything.

291
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,360
After a while,
he stopped coming to work.

292
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,320
He just quit caring.

293
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,800
I don't think anybody loved his boy
more than Sam did.

294
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,600
Here.

295
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,200
You're gonna freeze out there.

296
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,440
Thank you.
Are the Parrishes still around?

297
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,560
- I see them now and then.
- Yeah?

298
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,840
They're over on Adams Street.

299
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,840
Our parents are dead too.

300
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,240
They were in the Middle East
negotiating peace when...

301
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,840
Our dad was in advertising.

302
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,880
I bet you miss him, huh?

303
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,920
Me too.

304
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,440
There he goes again.

305
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,960
I know you're upset,
but we should finish the game.

306
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,320
We? Why do you need me?

307
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,320
Just in case any other
scary stuff comes out.

308
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,000
Plus there's a lion in my aunt's room.

309
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,320
Do I look like a Ringling Brother?

310
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
She'll be home soon.

311
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,640
Won't she be surprised?
I hope she's not allergic to cats.

312
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,320
Larry, we need the wheels.
Give me a hand.

313
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,440
- Did we hit her hard?
- No, it looks like another weird bite.

314
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,360
- Yeah, it's another one.
- That's over 50. What's going on?

315
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,280
Easy now, easy.

316
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,400
- Isn't that Mrs. Thomas?
- Who's that?

317
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,480
- The realtor.
- Quiet.

318
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,320
Listen.

319
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,720
You hear that?

320
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,920
Hear what?

321
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,200
Get in the car.

322
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,000
Okay, think.
What came out of the game before me?

323
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,080
There was a lion,
a bunch of monkeys and...

324
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,600
That!

325
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,280
It's okay, it's okay.
It's just a bug. We're safe in here.

326
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,560
We're fine.

327
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,760
If we stay low,
he can't get through there too far.

328
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,160
Don't you worry. We're fine.

329
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,160
He can't get through the glass.

330
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,240
We're safe.

331
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,600
Do you know how to drive?

332
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,760
No? That's no problem.

333
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,800
My dad used to let me back
the car down the driveway.

334
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,520
Once.

335
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,880
So, what's the big deal?

336
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,400
Here we go!

337
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,080
Alan, the top!

338
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Piece of cake.

339
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,440
Alan.

340
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,640
Keep that thing away from me!

341
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,200
When are you gonna help us play?
Our aunt will be home soon.

342
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,400
Good. You can inform her that
she's the ex-owner of this house.

343
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,640
I hope you realize with my parents
gone, this home belongs to me.

344
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,000
Oh, thank you.

345
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,840
No more banana leaves.

346
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,360
What do you think those monkeys
will do to the ecosystem?

347
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Just sit right back
And you'll hear a tale

348
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,200
A tale of a fateful trip

349
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,280
That started out in this tropic port
Aboard this tiny ship

350
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,360
The mate was a mighty sailing man
The skipper brave and sure

351
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:36,440
Five passengers set sail that day
For a three-hour tour

352
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,920
What happened to you?
Did you shave with a piece of glass?

353
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,800
What happened to you?
Did the Clampetts have a yard sale?

354
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,680
I've never shaved before.

355
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,400
Where are you going?

356
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,760
How about Peter and I play,
and you just sort of watch?

357
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,320
Thanks, I've seen it.

358
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,320
If you won't help us,
what are you gonna do?

359
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,720
I don't know.
Pretty much take up where I left off.

360
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,360
I wonder if Mrs. Niedermeyer's
still teaching sixth grade.

361
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,560
Come on, he's not gonna help us.
He's afraid.

362
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,840
What did you say?

363
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,920
You're afraid.
It's okay to be afraid.

364
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,640
Let's set it up in the living room.

365
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,800
You have no idea
what you're getting yourself into.

366
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,000
Whatever it is, we can handle it.
We don't need your help.

367
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,120
I don't think so.

368
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,320
You think monkeys, mosquitoes
and lions are bad?

369
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,080
That's just the beginning.

370
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,760
I've seen things you've only
seen in your nightmares.

371
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,080
Things you can't even imagine.

372
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,800
Things you can't even see.

373
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,760
There are things that
hunt you in the night.

374
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,200
Then something screams.
Then you hear them eating.

375
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,200
And you hope to God
that you're not dessert.

376
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,200
Afraid?

377
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,360
You don't even know what afraid is.

378
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,800
You will not last
five minutes without me.

379
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,040
So, you're gonna help us?

380
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,440
I'll watch...

381
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,640
...but I'm not afraid.

382
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,360
Peter, that was very cool.

383
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:05,200
It's reverse psychology.
Dad used to pull it on me all the time.

384
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,920
Ready?

385
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,000
Alan, ready?

386
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,440
There is no "ready".

387
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,320
I'll try it again.

388
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,400
Alan, it's not working.

389
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,360
It's not your turn.

390
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,960
I rolled first. Then Peter twice
because he got doubles.

391
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,400
Now it's my turn.

392
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,760
No, look.
Two of the pieces are yours, right?

393
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,880
Who's the other pieces?

394
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,640
The elephant was mine.

395
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,840
You're playing the game
I started in 1969.

396
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,440
I'm gonna have to play.

397
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,680
It's not my turn.

398
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,040
Whose turn is it?

399
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,240
Sarah Whittle.

400
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,880
This is where she used to live.

401
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:40,040
This place gives me the creeps.

402
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,840
We used to play on this porch.

403
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,920
She doesn't live here.

404
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,600
She probably married Billy Jessup.

405
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,280
- Come on.
- Let's at least ask.

406
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,360
- Maybe she'll know where Sarah went.
- She'll know. She's a psychic.

407
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,440
Good point.

408
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,600
I remember the porch
being a lot bigger.

409
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,280
- Can you help us?
- Do you have an appointment?

410
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,320
- No, we're trying to find someone.
- Madam Serena can't see anyone now.

411
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,040
Maybe you can help us.

412
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,480
What is it?

413
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,160
We're looking for someone
who used to live here.

414
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,400
No, I've lived here my whole life.

415
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,360
Then you must know Sarah Whittle.

416
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,840
What do you want
with Sarah Whittle?

417
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,840
Sarah?

418
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,400
I don't go by that name anymore.

419
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,960
Sarah Whittle?

420
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,240
What do you want?

421
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:01,440
Twenty-six years ago, you played a game
with a little boy down the street.

422
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,880
A game with drums.

423
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,520
How do you know that?

424
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,640
I was that little boy, Sarah.

425
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,840
Alan?

426
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,840
You killed her.

427
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,000
Leave a message
and the doctor will call you back...

428
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,080
... at his earliest convenience.

429
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,520
Dr. Boorstein, it's Sarah Whittle.
Please call me as soon as you can.

430
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,360
I think I need
to have my dosage checked.

431
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,080
That event we've been discussing,
the one that didn't really happen?

432
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:50,120
I'm having an episode here with
the boy who didn't really disappear.

433
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,000
I'm sitting in his living room,
drinking lemonade.

434
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,240
If you could call me, I'd really
be interested in your interpretation.

435
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,960
- He'll call me back.
- While we're waiting...

436
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,240
- God! No, no, no!
- Sarah.

437
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,880
I've spent 2000 hours in therapy
convincing myself that didn't exist.

438
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,400
What happened to you was so awful.
I made it up.

439
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,760
It was awful. It was awful.

440
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,200
It really was.

441
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,600
But it was real.

442
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,760
No, it wasn't real. Your father
murdered you and chopped you up.

443
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,120
Sarah, come on!

444
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,880
My dad did that?

445
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,760
My father could barely hug me...

446
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,280
...let alone cut me into little pieces.

447
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,120
Twenty-six years ago,
we started playing a little game.

448
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,560
And now...

449
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,080
...we're all gonna sit down
and we're gonna finish it.

450
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,920
And guess what?

451
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,040
It's your turn.

452
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,400
Play the game.

453
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,560
- Oh, no, no.
- Fine.

454
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,600
Just give me the dice and you can
go home. You don't have to play.

455
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,720
Thank you, Alan.

456
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,400
Oh, my God! How could you do that?

457
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,360
It's the law of the jungle.
You'll get used to it.

458
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,360
When I think of the energy I spent
visualizing you as a radiant spirit...

459
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,680
Go on, read it.

460
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,680
"They grow much faster than bamboo.

461
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,960
Take care or they'll come after you."

462
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,560
Oh, great!

463
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,000
Oh, God.
Tell me this isn't happening.

464
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,920
It is. Stay away from the walls.
Don't touch anything.

465
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,440
No quick movements.

466
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,880
- They're beautiful.
- Yeah, they're beautiful.

467
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,040
Don't touch the purple ones.
They shoot poisonous barbs.

468
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,400
And definitely stay away from
the pods. The big yellow ones.

469
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,400
What big yellow ones?

470
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,560
I got you! Get his arms!

471
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,240
Get it off me! Get it off me!

472
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,560
Oh, my God!

473
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,840
Hang on.

474
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,120
Got him? I'll be right back.

475
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,080
Sorry, Angus.

476
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,240
Harvest time!

477
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,440
Are you okay?

478
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,320
Oh, my God!

479
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,880
My car. Oh, my car.

480
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,800
I can't believe this.
Start, start, please. Yes!

481
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,160
-Carl? Come in, Carl.
- Carl here.

482
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,760
Where have you been?
We've got an animal control situation.

483
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,880
Get Stan and Willy on it.

484
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,840
I've gotta check out a suspicious
character at the Parrish place.

485
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,000
I should've been a fireman.

486
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,040
Sarah!

487
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,960
Get your hands off me!

488
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,760
- The game is not over yet.
- It is for me.

489
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,840
You are not in the jungle anymore.

490
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,240
Stop this! You don't
treat people like this.

491
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,240
Anybody up for iced tea?
I'm gonna make some tea.

492
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,880
Please, last time I played
this game it ruined my life.

493
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,800
It ruined your life?

494
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:29,160
"In the jungle you must wait
till the dice read five or eight."

495
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,760
I was a little girl, Alan.

496
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,600
You disappeared.

497
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:40,120
And a bunch of bats surrounded me
and chased me down the street.

498
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,320
I was afraid.

499
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,840
I'm sorry, Alan.

500
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,080
No one believed me. I was alone.

501
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:53,400
So was I, for 26 years, Sarah.

502
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,280
Me too.

503
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,360
It's okay, Sarah.
We're scared too.

504
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,160
But if we finish the game,
it'll all go away.

505
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,880
What if I get stuck in the game?

506
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,080
You won't.

507
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,360
Because I won't stop playing.

508
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,840
And neither will I.

509
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,240
I won't either.

510
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,920
Come on, Sarah.

511
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,840
Please?

512
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,760
I knew this was gonna be a bad day.

513
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,520
Come on, we'll be fine.

514
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,120
We just have to keep our heads.

515
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,720
And roll with the punches.

516
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,760
"A hunter from the darkest wild...

517
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,720
...makes you feel just like a child."

518
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,000
What is it?

519
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,840
Van Pelt.

520
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:27,000
You miserable coward!
Come back and face me like a man.

521
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,280
Not good enough, Sonny Jim.

522
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,240
Coming, ready or not.

523
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,080
Hey, you!

524
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,920
Drop your gun
and get your hands in the air!

525
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,240
Man, I don't believe this!

526
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,480
Even if Alan gets out
of this situation...

527
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,200
...it'll happen over and over again.

528
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,680
When you carry repressed anger,
it attracts a lot of negative energy.

529
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,640
Things happen, like ending up
in the jungle. That was no accident.

530
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,000
There are no accidents.

531
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,080
Whose turn is it?

532
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,720
- It's my turn.
- Really? Great.

533
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,520
You might've told us
there was a man who hunts people.

534
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,400
I didn't know.
It's just a roll of the dice.

535
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,640
Is he the reason
you didn't want to play?

536
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,000
You didn't want to play, either?

537
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:16,320
Mr. We-started-26-years-ago-
and-now-we-gotta-finish-it?

538
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,960
What's with this guy?

539
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,360
He's a hunter. He kills things.
Right now, he wants to kill me.

540
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,920
- Why you?
- Why me?

541
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,760
I don't know. You'd think
it'd be a waste of his time.

542
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,720
Maybe I'd look good on his wall.

543
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,400
It's your turn.

544
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,440
Have you ever talked with him
about your differences?

545
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,600
- Are you crazy? The man has a gun...
- Don't ever call me crazy. Ever.

546
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:45,080
Everyone's called me crazy ever since
I said you were sucked into a game.

547
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,880
Maybe I should roll.

548
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:47,920
Yeah.

549
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,360
I was the girl who saw you murdered.
Did anyone come to my birthday party?

550
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,360
Hello, I'm rolling now.

551
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,640
Billy who?

552
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,760
Are you an owl? Come on, Madam
Serena, dig into your consciousness.

553
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,960
Here, just roll.

554
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,960
Find the memory of your old boyfriend.

555
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,280
- The kid who'd steal your bicycle?
- The kid who took you to the movies.

556
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,600
"Don't be fooled, it isn't thunder.
Staying put would be a blunder."

557
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,320
- You're immature.
- You are!

558
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,720
I know you are, but what am I?

559
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,880
Do you feel that?

560
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,120
Run!

561
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,360
It's a stampede!

562
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,640
The game!

563
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,760
Don't look back!

564
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,480
Not the game!

565
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,840
Why didn't you grab the game, Peter?

566
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,600
Ignore him. He's a Libra.

567
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,360
- Where are you going?
- He'll head for water!

568
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,440
It's Aunt Nora.
Where have you been?

569
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,840
I'm sorry, dear.
You have the wrong number.

570
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,840
Wait for me!

571
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,200
- What can I do for you?
- I'll have a gross of these.

572
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,480
They stopped making these in 1903.

573
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,080
Damn. Then I shall need
a replacement weapon.

574
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,880
There's a waiting period.

575
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:25,640
And you'll have to fill out these.

576
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,680
Or I could fill these out.

577
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,640
Louise.

578
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,720
Now, anyone asks,
you didn't get this here.

579
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,760
You're not a postal worker, are you?

580
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,280
Alan!

581
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,320
Quiet.

582
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,120
Peter!

583
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,000
Peter, are you okay?

584
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,520
I can't believe you did that.
That was so cool.

585
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,720
- You gave me chills.
- It was great.

586
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:41,040
Nice work. Come on,
give me the game. Let's go.

587
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,600
Oh, no.

588
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,840
Act natural.

589
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,880
Hide the game.

590
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,600
Every time there's trouble,
I run into you.

591
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,760
I don't know
what you're talking about.

592
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,040
- I'm taking you in.
- I'm not going anywhere.

593
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,520
Just a second.
You can't take him, he's...

594
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,640
- Her fiancé.
- You said he's your uncle.

595
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,840
It's all right. I'll be back soon.

596
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,960
Blast!

597
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,400
You said you'd never
abandon your friends.

598
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,080
- We'll finish the game later.
- Later?

599
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,800
Van Pelt. Van Pelt.

600
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:54,160
I suggest you all go home now.

601
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,400
Now how are we supposed
to finish the game?

602
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,200
We can't.
We can't finish it without him.

603
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,960
Judy!

604
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,880
What?

605
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,160
What happened?

606
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,480
I thought I could end the game.
I was only 10 spaces away.

607
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,000
"A law of Jumanji
hadn't been broken...

608
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,400
...you will slip back
more than your token."

609
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,040
You tried to cheat?

610
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,200
No, I tried to drop the dice
so they landed on 12.

611
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,960
Okay, honey.
Well, that would be cheating.

612
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,200
Peter, your hands!
Look at your hands!

613
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:01,200
Come in, this is Willy.
They cleaned out Larry's Hardware.

614
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,040
I can't stop them.
Get the National Guard down here.

615
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,760
What is this about?
I know you know.

616
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,360
Yes, I do. But you wouldn't
believe me even if I told you, Carl.

617
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,720
Wait a minute.
How do you know my name is Carl?

618
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,680
I know a lot more than that.

619
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,520
You used to work at Parrish Shoes.

620
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,960
They used to call you "Sole Man".

621
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,280
Sole Man, that's right.
I was in there too...

622
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,400
...till old man Parrish fired me.

623
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,520
- He fired you?
- Yeah, man.

624
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,960
And I had something that could've
turned this whole town around.

625
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,600
- Your shoes.
- Right.

626
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,360
Listen, Carl?

627
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,320
I know it doesn't mean much
after 26 years...

628
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,160
...but I'm sorry.

629
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,560
I'm sorry.

630
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,920
Sorry for what?

631
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,800
It's me. Alan.

632
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,560
Thank you.

633
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,400
What's going on?

634
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:01,800
Well, apparently
there's a sale, honey.

635
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,720
You saw three monkeys
on a motorcycle, didn't you?

636
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:11,040
- Yes.
- Good girl.

637
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,960
Maybe we can bail him out
with a cheque.

638
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,520
Thank you.

639
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,960
Tell that snivelling coward
if he wants...

640
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,160
Get out of my way!

641
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:21,040
Give me that, boy!

642
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,400
Help me!

643
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,320
Get me out of here!

644
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:30,280
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God, Peter.

645
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,640
All right.

646
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,880
There it is.

647
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,880
Wait here.

648
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,160
Gotcha, girlie.

649
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,040
When Alan hears of your predicament,
he'll come.

650
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:19,200
He doesn't know I'm here.
It won't work. Your plan's ruined.

651
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:23,200
- Move and I'll blow your brains out!
- Okay.

652
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,800
Call the cops!

653
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,280
- That should do the trick.
- Oh, yeah.

654
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,480
Price check!

655
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:41,320
If you let me go,
I can stop all this.

656
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,800
It's like "The Twilight Zone",
but it's true.

657
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,360
Please, you gotta help me on this.

658
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,720
I know I'm gonna regret this.

659
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,320
Just hold still.

660
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,800
There, I let you go.

661
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,280
Now what are we gonna do?

662
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,080
- You're staying here.
- My keys!

663
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,680
It's for your own good.

664
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,800
- My handcuff keys!
- I have to do this!

665
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,920
- Alan!
- You'll thank me someday.

666
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,280
Carl, code red.

667
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,560
Hostage situation at Sir Sav-a-lot.
A woman and two children.

668
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,080
It sounds like the armed perpetrator
in the pith helmet.

669
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,360
Carl? Come in, Carl.

670
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,280
- Lorraine?
- What's Sir Sav-a-lot?

671
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,200
- It's a discount store.
- Move over.

672
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,720
- Wait. Gently, gently.
- All right, all right.

673
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,680
Don't worry,
I've done this before.

674
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,480
Once.

675
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,000
Where's Sir Sav-a-lot?

676
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,960
- Monroe and Elm.
- The Episcopal church.

677
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,400
Not anymore.
Now it's a Speedy Burger.

678
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,160
At least it was. I don't know
what's left. People are going loopy.

679
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,080
Judy!

680
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,120
Uh-oh. We got company.

681
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,400
It's all right. He'll back us up.

682
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,960
- Here's the game.
- Get out of here.

683
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,840
Rats!

684
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:41,280
- Turn the siren off. Right there!
- Okay, I got it.

685
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,800
Stop cringing,
I could have shot you at any moment.

686
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,160
Why didn't you?

687
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,800
You didn't roll the dice, Alan did.

688
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,080
There it is, there it is.
Hit the brakes!

689
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,280
Hit the brakes!

690
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,560
Hit the brakes!

691
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,560
He'll be here.

692
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,440
Sarah!

693
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,360
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

694
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,480
- Where's Peter?
- I'm here.

695
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,520
Oh, great.

696
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:43,440
So remember, circumstances are
never, ever out of your control.

697
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,400
End of tape three.

698
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,880
Update on the extraordinary events
in Brantford, New Hampshire.

699
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,760
98 people have been hospitalized
with symptoms...

700
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,440
... ranging from inexplicable fevers
and rashes to seizures.

701
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,280
Local resources are strained
to the breaking point.

702
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:05,920
And state officials are now asking
those with such symptoms to dial 911.

703
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,280
I got it.

704
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,440
Alan, talk to him, please?

705
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,800
What? We don't have time
for this, okay?

706
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,560
I know, but he's a kid
and he was trying to help.

707
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,560
- All right, come on.
- Thank you.

708
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,920
Judy, come on.

709
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,600
I warned you about this, Peter.

710
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,560
No, you wanted to play the game.

711
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:17,160
What, are you crying?
You don't cry, you keep your chin up.

712
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,040
Come on, keep your chin up.

713
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,640
Crying never helped
anybody do anything.

714
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:28,360
If you have a problem,
you face it like a man.

715
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,080
I'm sorry. Twenty-six years
buried in the deepest jungle...

716
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,120
...and I still became my father.

717
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,600
It's okay. Come here, I'm sorry.
Hey, it's all right.

718
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,840
It's all right to be afraid.

719
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,440
It's not that.

720
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,680
What is it?

721
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,640
Okay.

722
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,680
Ready?

723
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:15,560
Don't worry, we'll have you back
to your old self in no time flat.

724
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:20,640
Because we'll go in here together,
sit down and finish that game.

725
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,120
No matter...

726
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,880
...what.

727
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,080
Suddenly, I feel right at home.

728
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,840
Lorraine, this is Carl.

729
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:16,680
I'm heading over to the Parrish place.
Give me some backup.

730
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,880
Lorraine?

731
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,640
Wait! Wait!

732
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,120
Now what?

733
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,640
Stop!

734
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,080
Wait! Stop!

735
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,160
Is there a problem?

736
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,720
- Can I have a ride home?
- Where do you live?

737
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,440
Jefferson Street.
The old Parrish place.

738
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,160
Do you have children?
A boy and a girl?

739
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,480
What happened?

740
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,520
Get in.
I'll explain it all on the way.

741
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,640
Fine! Take it!

742
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,680
We gotta get to that house.

743
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,440
- Shouldn't we play someplace else?
- No.

744
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:30,840
I grew up in this.
It's out there that scares me.

745
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:36,480
- Okay, it's my turn.
- Sarah, if you roll a 12, you win.

746
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:41,000
Okay, ready? Here I go.

747
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,520
It's okay.

748
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:50,160
"Every month at the quarter moon,
there'll be a monsoon...

749
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,720
...in your lagoon." Monsoon.

750
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,640
At least we're inside.

751
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,680
Yeah, right.

752
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,840
Well, a little rain
never hurt anybody.

753
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,200
But a lot can kill you.

754
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,920
Come on!

755
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,680
This way!

756
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,520
- What do we do now?
- We get to higher ground.

757
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:42,280
Come on! Stay together!

758
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,320
You okay?

759
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,160
- Alan?
- What?

760
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,160
What is that?

761
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,680
Swim! Swim! Look out!

762
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:15,080
Swim! Go! Move!

763
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,280
Keep going!

764
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,720
Stay on the table!

765
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,080
Feet out of the water!

766
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:29,680
On the chandelier!

767
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,760
Come on, Sarah.

768
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:55,120
Hang on, Sarah!

769
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,800
Are you okay?

770
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,600
Judy? Peter!

771
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,200
Step back and let me
handle this, please.

772
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:32,720
It's nothing.
They probably left the TV on too loud.

773
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:40,320
I always wanted to do this.
Could you step back, please?

774
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,520
Give me your hand!

775
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,280
- Grab my hand!
- I got it.

776
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,240
Take the game.

777
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,880
- You okay?
- Yeah.

778
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,680
Alan, you wrestled
an alligator for me.

779
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,360
It was a crocodile.

780
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,240
Alligators don't have
that fringe on their hind leg.

781
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,320
Come on.

782
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:02,280
My mistake.

783
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:23,080
Come on.

784
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,240
Okay, it's my turn.

785
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,320
I've got it!

786
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,880
Colonel Mustard in the library
with the wrench.

787
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,560
Clue.

788
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,400
"Beware the ground on which you stand.

789
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:56,760
The floor is quicker than the sand."

790
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,760
- Help me.
- Stay calm.

791
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,440
Don't struggle. Stay calm.

792
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,880
I'm calm.

793
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,760
- Grab on!
- Pull!

794
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,480
I got it. Pull!

795
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,240
Stay calm!

796
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,440
Come on!

797
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,680
Oh, good!

798
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,360
I got you...

799
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,240
Stop giving me things
that come apart!

800
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,600
"There is a lesson..."

801
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,640
All right.

802
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,320
"There is lesson you will learn."

803
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,040
I got you.

804
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:48,080
"Sometimes you must go back a turn."

805
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:53,880
- Did I hurt you?
- No.

806
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,280
Thank you, Judy. Thank you.
That was very quick thinking.

807
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,960
Sarah and I would like
to get out of the floor.

808
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,200
It's your turn, Peter.

809
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,280
Okay.

810
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,240
I thought I'd lost you again.

811
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:17,000
Thanks for sticking around this time.

812
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,600
"Need a hand? Why, you just wait.

813
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:28,480
We'll help you out.
We each have eight."

814
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,400
What's that? What is it?

815
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:41,120
- Nothing.
- You don't go "Ah!" for nothing.

816
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:46,400
Peter, my dad kept an axe
in the woodshed. Go get it!

817
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:50,480
Hurry! Go, go, go!

818
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,000
Judy?

819
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,720
Peter?

820
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:59,280
Aunt Nora, it's me. Peter.

821
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,800
Sorry. I can't talk right now.
I'll explain later.

822
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,360
- Sarah.
- What?

823
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,040
It's your turn.
You can finish if you roll 7.

824
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,800
- I can't roll.
- Put the dice in your mouth.

825
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:18,360
Bring the game. Hurry!

826
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:24,120
Judy!

827
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:31,920
Are you okay?

828
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:35,280
I'm fine. Help them.

829
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:41,080
Come on, Judy.

830
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,680
Give me the dice.

831
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,680
"You're almost there
with much at stake.

832
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,280
But now the ground begins to quake."

833
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,560
I wish Mom and Dad were here.

834
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,480
So do I.

835
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,560
Her only chance is
if we finish the game!

836
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,400
It's your turn!

837
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,440
Oh, my God!

838
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,400
Get the game!

839
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,360
I won't let you go!

840
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,720
Don't move.

841
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:22,680
Stand up.

842
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:29,240
What's in your hand?

843
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,760
Drop it.

844
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,040
End of the line, Sonny Jim.

845
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:47,200
Game's up. Start running.

846
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,480
No.

847
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,840
Aren't you afraid?

848
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,120
I'm terrified.

849
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,640
But my father told me...

850
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,760
...you should always face
what you're afraid of.

851
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,040
Good lad.
You're finally acting like a man.

852
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:13,040
Any last words?

853
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,480
Jumanji.

854
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:28,760
It's Jumanji.

855
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,880
No, Alan, no!

856
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,960
I forgot my speech notes.

857
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:05,400
Dad, I'm so glad you're back.

858
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,960
I've only been gone 5 minutes.

859
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:13,040
It seems like a lot longer to me.

860
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:17,760
I thought you were never
going to talk to me again.

861
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:25,480
Whatever I said, Dad, I'm sorry.

862
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:30,800
Look, Alan, I was angry.

863
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:35,120
I'm sorry too, son.

864
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:43,520
Look, you don't have to go
to Cliffside if you don't want to.

865
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,760
Let's talk it over tomorrow.
Man-to-man.

866
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,800
How about father to son?

867
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,720
Great.

868
01:29:56,840 --> 01:30:01,480
I've gotta get going.
I'm the guest of honour.

869
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,880
Dad?

870
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:11,760
Back in 196...
I mean, today in the factory...

871
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,840
...it wasn't Carl Bentley's fault.

872
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:17,880
I put the shoe on the conveyer belt.

873
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,800
I'm glad you told me, son.

874
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,320
Thanks.

875
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,600
Bye, Dad.

876
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,520
Goodbye.

877
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,600
- Holy smokes! Judy and Peter!
- Alan.

878
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,040
They're not there.

879
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,640
It's 1969.

880
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,680
They don't even exist yet.

881
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,600
I'm forgetting what
it's like to be a grownup.

882
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:24,640
That's okay, as long as
we don't forget each other.

883
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,680
Or Judy and Peter.

884
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:31,160
There's something
I've been wanting to do.

885
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:36,080
I better do it before
I feel too much like a kid.

886
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:58,400
They probably don't teach driver
training in the sixth grade, huh?

887
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,720
Merry Christmas.

888
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,880
Do you want any cookies?

889
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,800
Dad, the new cross-trainer's
doing fabulous.

890
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,800
No, it's not a bra, it's a shoe.

891
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,000
Honey, they're here.

892
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:31,640
Dad, I gotta run.
We'll pick you up tomorrow, okay?

893
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,800
You'll be the best Christmas gift
of all. Bye-bye!

894
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:39,080
They're here? Come on, let's go.

895
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,520
Pardon me.

896
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,600
Jim! Glad you could make it.

897
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,600
- Thanks. This is my wife, Martha.
- Hi. This is Sarah.

898
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:49,680
- Hi, Sarah.
- Where are the kids?

899
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,440
Oh, my God, there they are.

900
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:55,120
How'd you know?

901
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,640
A guess, of course.
They're your kids.

902
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,040
Right, these are our children.

903
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,800
Judy and Peter. Say hi
to Mr. And Mrs. Parrish.

904
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,200
Nice to meet you.

905
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,160
Nice to meet you.

906
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:11,280
You're just like we remembered you.

907
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:16,040
I feel like we know
so much about them.

908
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:20,280
- You've told Alan about them.
- And I told her.

909
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,960
- I'll get the presents.
- Sure, honey.

910
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,640
Well, we love children.

911
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,360
Merry Christmas.

912
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,640
When can you start?

913
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:35,880
We were going to take a skiing holiday
up in the Canadian Rockies.

914
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:38,920
No!

915
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:40,800
Sorry.

916
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,840
We just...

917
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:47,040
Need you to get that marketing
done on the new line.

918
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,600
No problem.
I could start next week.

919
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:54,520
Great. Let me introduce you
to the folks you'll be working with.

920
01:33:54,760 --> 01:34:00,880
Come on in. Our house was your house.
Is. Anytime you'd like.
