1
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:06,686
Do you have any idea
how many civil codes you just broke?

2
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,785
You know, you and l
are gonna have some problems

3
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:13,060
if you plan on loafing around again all summer
like you did last year.

4
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,567
You follow me?

5
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,897
You understand?

6
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,870
Yes, sir.

7
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,872
You know,
when I was your age,

8
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,272
I worked two jobs
in the summertime.

9
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,278
I cut grass, and I worked
in a movie theater at night.

10
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,112
What the hell is your problem?

11
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,447
I don't have a lawnmower.

12
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,086
Well, you know,
that's a good point.

13
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,183
But it doesn't give you
any excuse to break the law.

14
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,627
This is your last warning.

15
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,663
You understand?

16
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,164
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,824
All right.

18
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,036
Hey, how fast?

19
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,128
35.

20
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:01,271
Kevin, aren't you
forgetting something?

21
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,285
All right.

22
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,119
What's he doing back in here?

23
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,628
Listen, we've got
some very good news.

24
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,829
Sam's cousin in California
runs an orange grove,

25
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,201
and they're looking for some help.

26
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,436
That's perfect! Sam needs a job.

27
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,306
Little smart ass.

28
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,811
The job is not for him.

29
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,848
We've already
made arrangements.

30
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,783
Mom, I'm not spending my whole summer
picking oranges

31
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,787
while he sits around.

32
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,115
Sam's gonna move back in.

33
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,888
Thought it would
make things easier.

34
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,358
Easier if I wasn't here.

35
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,987
You call me when you get there?

36
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,496
Hey! Come on, come on.
End of the line, pal.

37
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,867
Come on.

38
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,599
Hey.

39
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,759
I'm Kevin.

40
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,202
I'm Kevin.

41
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,260
Kevin?

42
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,218
Got a lot of deliveries to make.

43
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,724
Let's go.

44
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,118
What is this place?

45
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,553
Make it quick.
We got four more stops.

46
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,956
Hey, hey, hey! Hurry up!

47
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,664
Hey! Got hot stuff coming through,

48
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,174
coming through, coming through,
coming through, coming through.

49
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,835
Hey, just put it in the corner, man.

50
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,519
Dude! Come on!

51
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:22,519
What?

52
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,714
Just give me another chance!

53
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,484
I gave you a chance.
You blew it.

54
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,525
I'll try harder.

55
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,753
Take your crap
and get down the road.

56
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,659
You are stupid. You are slow.

57
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,290
We spend half our time
waiting for you to do the work

58
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,799
and the other half
fixing your mistakes.

59
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,768
You want to dick around all day,
do it on your own time.

60
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,805
What are you looking at?

61
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,239
You gonna stand around all day?
Bring that crate inside.

62
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,973
What?

63
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,139
Punk.

64
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:08,899
Hold it.

65
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:09,935
What?

66
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,266
Stop the truck.
Yeah. Stop the truck.

67
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,600
You gotta take a leak?

68
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,004
No.

69
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,844
We don't have time for screwing around.
Get back in the truck.

70
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,382
Sorry, dude.

71
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,849
What am I gonna tell the boss?

72
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,250
Uh, tell him...

73
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,015
Tell him whatever you want.

74
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,523
Hey. Excuse me.

75
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,717
What?

76
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,885
That kid left this.

77
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,486
Yeah. Set it on the table.

78
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,131
Is there something else?

79
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,864
No.

80
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,000
Look, I was just wondering if--

81
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,202
Spit it out, junior.

82
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,869
In case you haven't noticed, we're busy.

83
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:27,970
I don't got all day.

84
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,981
I was just thinking
I could use a job,

85
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,347
and from the looks of it,
you're short-handed.

86
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,151
You want to wash the dishes?

87
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,780
Yeah.

88
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,882
I don't think so.

89
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,859
The last thing I need
is another punk kid

90
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,053
messing around
in my kitchen.

91
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,893
As you can see,
I got plenty of those.

92
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,694
I'm a hard worker.

93
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,362
Yeah? Weren't you stacking oranges
1 0 minutes ago?

94
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,461
Yeah.

95
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,903
You quit?

96
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:54,962
Yeah.

97
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,940
Just like that?

98
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,476
Yeah.

99
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,977
So let me get this straight.

100
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,444
You want me to hire you,

101
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,982
knowing that you just walked off
your last job with no notice,

102
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,710
you want to come here
and wash dishes,

103
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,015
and you've never
washed a dish before.

104
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,679
Yeah.

105
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,086
I don't think so.

106
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,126
I don't know what to tell you. Sorry.

107
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,270
Hey!

108
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,640
All right, but if you screw up,

109
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,942
you're out on your ass, you got it?

110
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,143
Wear these unless you
want to get blisters.

111
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,479
Come on, while there's still some daylight.

112
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,413
Let's hit it.

113
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,321
Dustpan behind you, man.

114
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,422
What's your name?

115
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,588
Kevin.

116
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,928
Kevin. Lock up when
you're finished, right?

117
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,763
Uh, sure.

118
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,827
Good. I'm J. D. This is Cooper.

119
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,668
Don't let the tattoos fool you.

120
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,901
He went to an all-Catholic boys' school.

121
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,602
This here is Martinez.

122
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,872
Don't bother talking to him.

123
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:14,913
He doesn't speak any English.

124
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,174
Waste of your time.

125
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,813
Get a bunk with us.
Cabin number 8.

126
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,184
We'd love to help you clean up,

127
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,950
but we've got a date
with the street course.

128
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,958
So what are the rules
about skating?

129
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,618
Only when your work
is finished.

130
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:32,095
By the looks of this, you'll be done sometime
around Christmas.

131
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,868
Oh, a couple of things. 1--

132
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,132
Tony gets pissed
when you don't finish your work.

133
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,537
'Cause Tony don't skate. 2--

134
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,738
Don't piss off Tony.

135
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,780
Uh, look, rumor has it
he has a bit of a short fuse.

136
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,907
He was a Hell's Angel.

137
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:52,916
Right.

138
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,748
He almost killed a guy.

139
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,311
Beat him to death
for 10 bucks.

140
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,482
He stabbed him...
12 times?

141
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,219
No, no, no. This is
what really happened.

142
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,784
He burnt the guy's house down
while he was still in it.

143
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,660
Then, when he went to prison,
Tony got stabbed 12 times.

144
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,791
Whoa! Well, maybe you're right.

145
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,164
I know.

146
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,465
So, hey, by the way,

147
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,766
what'd the last kid do to get fired?

148
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,101
Broke some dishes.

149
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,251
Oh! Ow! What time is it?

150
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,753
- Almost 6.
- You better hurry up.

151
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,757
Tony hates people being late almost as much
as he hates being called Tony.

152
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,190
Why didn't you wake me?

153
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,455
We wanted to,
but Martinez said to let you sleep.

154
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,996
Hit the showers.
They're across the way.

155
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,194
You'll be fine.
See you at the office.

156
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,702
Hey, he hates
being called Tony?

157
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,237
Yeah. That's another thing.

158
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,172
You should always
address him with respect.

159
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,833
What do I call him?

160
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,310
Chief Tony.
He's a quarter Cherokee.

161
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,539
- Really?
- Yeah.

162
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,875
Go! He'll get pissed. Go!

163
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,540
Hey, that's messed up.

164
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,548
- What?
- Nothing.

165
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,517
No. Nothing. Go.

166
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,615
Not funny.

167
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,935
Not funny!

168
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,604
Not funny at all!

169
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,145
You must be new here.
Welcome.

170
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,440
Thanks. I'm late.

171
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,446
All right. See you around.

172
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,447
Yeah.

173
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,483
You're unraveling.

174
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,482
Bye!

175
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,757
Can I have my clothes
back, please?

176
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,626
Seriously, this is so not cool.

177
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,597
Hey, you better hurry.

178
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,429
He'll be back here
any monute.

179
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,593
Check your forehead.

180
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,601
- Huh?
- Look.

181
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,366
Let's go!
I'm gonna need those dishes!

182
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,079
Hey, come on.
Breakfast rush starts in an hour.

183
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,445
You gonna wear a shirt today?

184
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,780
Uh, yes, sir, Chief Tony.

185
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,581
What'd you call me?

186
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,849
Yes, sir.

187
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,448
The name's Tony. Let's go!

188
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,728
That's not funny.

189
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,959
Nice save.

190
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,967
Thanks, man, thanks.

191
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,468
Can I get my clothes back?

192
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,504
Sure, but one thing. Here. Check this out.

193
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,267
I need you to taste this.

194
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,308
Too much roughage in that.

195
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,384
Can I have your attention, please?

196
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,883
Can I have your
attention, please?

197
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,792
Now, before I cut you loose today,

198
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,328
I'd like to address the problem

199
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,058
concerning the recent rash
of curfew violations.

200
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:38,262
All campers are to be in their bunks--
their own bunks--

201
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,396
by 1 0 p. m. No exceptions.

202
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:41,700
Wilson.

203
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,866
I'm looking at you.

204
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,171
Also, to the individual
or individuals

205
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,273
responsible for abducting
the ducks from the pond

206
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,942
and putting them in the girls' toilets,

207
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,417
you are to cease and desist immediately.

208
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,825
The last thing we need
is another animal rights violation.

209
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,454
And, for those of you
who don't know,

210
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,624
we recently lost a beloved member of our staff,

211
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,467
so if I could ask you
to observe a moment of silence

212
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,369
for Nurse Betty Kaplan.

213
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,067
About time.

214
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,473
Thank you.

215
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,807
And now, on a happier note,

216
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,871
I will introduce the newest
member of our staff,

217
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,110
Nurse Hatcher.

218
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,404
Okay.

219
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,310
Eyes front, gentlemen.

220
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,973
It's not polite to stare.

221
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,813
Any questions?

222
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,512
Is she single?

223
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,686
Finally, I would
like to announce

224
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,193
that our annual field trip this year

225
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,356
will be to Magic Mountain
on July 24th.

226
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,663
And remember, safety first.

227
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,867
Nurse Hatcher.

228
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:27,143
Hey, man, that's Brad Malone.

229
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,375
He's one of the best amateur skaters
in the whole country.

230
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,280
Yeah, but he's also a bitch.

231
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,148
You're just jealous.

232
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,948
Yeah. Whatever you say, man.

233
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,989
I'm telling you,
the dude's a punk.

234
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,546
Go ahead and
introduce yourself.

235
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,149
Maybe he'll let you
polish his helmet.

236
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,127
Oh, okay.

237
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,461
Whatever.

238
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,268
Hey, you're Brad Malone, right?

239
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,860
Yeah.

240
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,270
Hey, man, I saw you skate
at Burnside last year.

241
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,139
You want my autograph
or something?

242
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,670
No. I just came to meet you.

243
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:04,977
You're new here, right?

244
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,415
Yeah.

245
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,476
Couldn't pay me enough
to work in the kitchen.

246
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,145
It's not so bad.

247
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,521
Is it true what they say about Tony?
Was he a hitman for the FBl?

248
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:14,581
I don't know.

249
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,559
No, man. He didn't
work for the Feds.

250
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,095
He did time in a federal prison.

251
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,289
He used to work in the kitchen.

252
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,332
That's how he
learned how to cook.

253
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,062
I wish I could sit
around and chat all day,

254
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,161
but I got some other
kids waiting for me.

255
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,034
You mind taking that for me?

256
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,574
Come on, guys.

257
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,450
So, he's such
a cool guy, isn't he?

258
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,383
Oh, man!

259
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,886
You havin' fun?

260
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,047
God!

261
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:46,681
Hey, guys, enough
of the lip flap here.

262
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,623
Get that stuff in the kitchen and get it done.

263
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,731
You all right?

264
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:02,831
I think so.

265
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,206
Yeah? All right.

266
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,973
Let me see.
Can you stand up?

267
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,143
You need some elbow pads, too.

268
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,013
You're gonna
have one down there.

269
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,814
Let's go see the nurse,
get you fixed up.

270
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,691
That was a pretty sticky rail.

271
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,660
Now, what you gotta do
on something like that

272
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,788
is stay centered over the board,
keep your knees bent a little bit.

273
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,594
Next time, I'll bet you nail it.

274
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,635
Aren't you Tony from the kitchen?

275
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:31,726
Yep.

276
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,395
Aren't you
supposed to be mean?

277
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,769
I am.

278
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:42,311
Now, what seems
to be the problem?

279
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,938
Well, he's got a scrape.
Looks pretty bad.

280
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,539
I hope you got a sharp knife.

281
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,608
This thing may have
to come off at the knee.

282
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,621
Thank you, doctor.

283
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,487
Why don't you come with me?

284
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,268
You finished?

285
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,636
Almost.

286
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:11,840
Hey, where is everyone?

287
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,605
Probably getting a quick
session before dinner.

288
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,645
You coming?

289
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:15,645
Sure.

290
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,681
Let's get out of here.

291
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,272
Be there in a minute.

292
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,816
Hey, where the hell you going?

293
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,485
To get a quick session in.

294
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:33,292
I thought I made it clear:
no skating till the dishes are done.

295
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,957
My work is done.

296
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,627
Look, you got time to skate,
you got time to work.

297
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,701
It's not mine.

298
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:52,740
Hey, the car out back,
make it shine.

299
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,917
You want me to wash your car?

300
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,216
Yeah.

301
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,224
Sweet ride, man.

302
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,028
It's the boss'.

303
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,330
Ah, Fort Knox.
Is Tony around?

304
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,837
I don't know, man.
I guess he's around here somewhere.

305
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,102
Well, if you see him,
tell him Andy said hello.

306
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,769
Have a good one.

307
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,211
Fort Knox. Sweet car.

308
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,976
Hey, where you been?
You missed it.

309
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,410
Missed what?

310
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,276
Andy Mac killing the vert ramp.

311
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,316
You should have seen him, man.
He was sick.

312
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,450
Yeah, man, I would have been there, but, uh...

313
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,081
Don't worry about it.

314
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,351
What?

315
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,188
What's on your face, huh?

316
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,227
Where?

317
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,955
Under your nose.
What's on your face?

318
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,223
Where?

319
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,755
I don't know, man. That looks like a buttstache.

320
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,028
What do you think,
Martinez?

321
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:25,569
That look like
a buttstache to you?

322
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,705
What's a buttstache?

323
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:34,675
Oh! Dude!

324
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,839
Hey, man, my bad.

325
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,680
Hey, what the hell
are you doing, huh?

326
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,277
Ain't you got
some dishes to wash?

327
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,049
Man, I'm sorry. Dude, it was an accident.

328
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,613
What are you skating
here for, anyway?

329
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,158
Hey, he said he was sorry, man.

330
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,386
Why don't you let it go?

331
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,825
What are you gonna
do about it, punk?

332
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,226
Yeah. What are you gonna
do about it, punk?

333
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,991
How about I take your boyfriend's
skateboard here

334
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,589
and beat your ass with it?

335
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,499
You girls done?
You finished?

336
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,536
Yeah, we're done.

337
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,536
Let's go.

338
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,436
Come on.

339
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:36,735
Come on. Let's go.

340
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,855
Her name's Cassidy.

341
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,950
Yeah. We met. Sort of.

342
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:59,428
She's hot. You should go talk to her.

343
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,089
You don't think
she has a boyfriend?

344
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,157
She's been single for as long
as I've known her.

345
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,293
If I wasn't so faithful
to my girl in Texas

346
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,031
and another girl in Colorado, l'd--

347
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,299
Yeah, whatever.

348
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,568
Dude, if you don't, I will.

349
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,574
Yeah.

350
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,372
You think I should?

351
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,469
What have you got to lose?

352
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:16,639
Yeah.

353
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,778
There's your cue.

354
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:27,613
Help her!

355
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:30,058
Right. Right.

356
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,330
Hey, you think
we should tell him?

357
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,366
What for?

358
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,266
Oh, my God.

359
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,667
Need some help?

360
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:43,173
Yeah. Thanks.

361
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,204
I didn't recognize you
with clothes on.

362
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:52,806
Yeah, they got a rule
about nudity here.

363
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,318
Too bad. I miss the whole,
like, toilet paper look.

364
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,944
It was good.

365
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:01,117
It was good, but it's
kind of out of season.

366
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,318
You got a name?

367
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,293
Kevin.

368
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:08,128
Well, Kevin, I gotta take this up to the store.

369
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,461
Want to give me a hand?

370
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,660
Of course.

371
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,226
Okay. Close up the trunk.

372
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:14,601
Yeah.

373
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,366
Go in, Kevin!
You can do it!

374
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,707
We have faith in you!

375
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,110
Go!

376
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,273
Come on, man!

377
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,444
All right. Let's go.

378
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,645
All right.

379
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,552
Sweet ride.

380
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,648
Thanks.

381
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,886
I've got some real, like, bad-ass rims on her.

382
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,359
Yeah. Let's go
catch some air.

383
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,395
Ready?

384
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:39,555
Yeah.

385
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,958
Thanks for the help.

386
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,001
No problem.

387
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,365
I'm Cassidy, by the way.

388
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,564
I didn't tell you that before.

389
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,937
I knew that already.

390
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,000
You did? Okay.

391
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,444
So, uh, how do you like it here?

392
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,540
I'm getting used to it. Yeah.

393
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,676
Some of the counselors
are a little cold.

394
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,484
Yeah. Some of the counselors
are egomaniacs.

395
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,649
What about the dishdogz?

396
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:11,161
Interesting. Exhausting.

397
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,322
Yeah. They're definitely
a colorful group.

398
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,558
Yeah.

399
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,801
Yeah. Actually,
I've been so busy,

400
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,396
I haven't even really had a chance
to take a look at the place.

401
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:25,533
Really? Well, I'm gonna take you
to a cool little spot up here.

402
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:34,840
This is pretty cool.

403
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,251
I know. You can see
the whole camp.

404
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,949
Yeah. It's great.

405
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,882
You think it's true
what they say about Tony?

406
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,054
I don't know. I mean, which one?

407
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,462
The one that he was a former drug dealer
for the Grateful Dead,

408
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,001
or that he spent time
in prison for murder,

409
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,866
or--my favorite one--

410
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,837
that he wrestled bears in Alaska?

411
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,202
So, I don't know.

412
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,970
I haven't heard those.

413
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:02,979
Yeah. I have a feeling
he likes to hear those rumors grow.

414
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,811
Yeah. He's a hard guy
to get to know.

415
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,916
So what about you?

416
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,082
I'm from a small town
in New Mexico.

417
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,990
You probably never heard of it.

418
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,654
I don't know. You?

419
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,563
Up the road a ways in Los Angeles.

420
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,327
I'm going to school in the fall.

421
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,595
What about you?

422
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,966
Any plans after camp?

423
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,062
School?

424
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,540
No, not really. I mean, I just--

425
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,873
I'd stay here
as long as they'd let me.

426
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,413
I'd be a counselor. You know...

427
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,880
I don't know.

428
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,042
I used to want to be a pro skater.

429
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,449
Yeah.

430
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,183
But I don't know.
Something will come up sooner or later.

431
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,248
Yeah. It'll just find you.

432
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,021
Yeah.

433
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,428
C., did lover boy pop up yet?

434
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,527
No. I haven't seen him
since he took off with Cassidy.

435
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,129
I hope Tony doesn't
freak on him, man.

436
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,197
Okay. All right.

437
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,804
I must say it was a pleasure
doing your job for you, lady.

438
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,142
Well, thank you.

439
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,715
So... I'll see you around?

440
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,378
Absolutely.

441
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,785
All right.

442
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:21,518
Cassidy, what are you doing?

443
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:22,820
Are you following me?

444
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,124
Don't tell me you're hanging out with this guy.

445
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,494
Whoa. Is everything all right?

446
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,363
Mind your own business,
dish boy.

447
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,300
Hey, Malone, look.

448
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,203
Can you just leave?
Okay? What do you want?

449
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,264
I thought we had something.

450
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,865
We did have something,

451
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,275
until I found out you had something
with Julie Blackwell,

452
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:44,280
Liz Hanson, Cindy Markel--
you want me to go on?

453
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,906
I did that for us.

454
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,178
You told me I needed to be sure
you were the one.

455
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,015
I had to test the waters.

456
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,079
Nice try.

457
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,919
Just give me another chance.

458
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,551
No way. Stop.

459
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,365
Okay. If that's
the way you want it.

460
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,361
I'll see you around.

461
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,902
All right.

462
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,175
Whoa. That guy's got a problem.

463
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,440
Sorry.

464
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,708
Go to work.
I'll see you later.

465
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,149
- Thanks.
- Bye.

466
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,878
What's up?

467
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,512
How was your date?

468
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,750
That wasn't cool.

469
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:29,224
What's wrong? You didn't hook up with her?
What happened?

470
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,851
No. You guys set me up.

471
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,056
Would we do
a thing like that?

472
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,033
Yeah. You knew Cassidy and Malone
had a thing.

473
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,568
Listen. Screw that guy.

474
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,070
He's a dog in the bad sense of the word.

475
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,107
Yeah, but I'm not trying to start--

476
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,801
Don't worry about it.
You're a dishdog now.

477
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,071
Hey, hey. What are you guys doing
standing around?

478
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,134
Where's your apron?

479
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,339
Oh, you know what?
I forgot mine.

480
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,075
Kevin lent me his.

481
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,243
Uh-huh. What about the dishes? They done?

482
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,484
- Floor mopped?
- You could eat off of it.

483
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,319
All right. Let's go eat.

484
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:07,691
What's he saying?

485
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,596
We got your back. Let's go eat.

486
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:00,910
We're not home now,
so please leave us a message.

487
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,583
Hey, Mom, it's me.

488
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,960
I guess you're sleeping
or something.

489
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,998
Just wanted to let you know
that I got a new job.

490
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,200
I'm not working
at the orange grove anymore.

491
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:27,802
Everything's fine. I'm fine.

492
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,815
So...

493
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:35,409
So I guess I'll just
try you again later.

494
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,665
Hey, is that Ryan Sheckler?

495
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,797
No, no way that's--

496
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:56,862
What do you know?

497
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,135
Come on, that's Ryan Sheckler.

498
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,975
Listen, Sheckles and l
go way back. It's not him.

499
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,537
How could you go way back?
The kid's only 1 4.

500
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,277
Listen, he's much taller
in person. Watch.

501
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,546
He is in person, you idiot.

502
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,609
What's up, guys?

503
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,212
- Hey!
- What's up?

504
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,224
You guys know where
the skate park's at?

505
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,452
Down that way.

506
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:16,550
Awesome.

507
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,152
Hey, hold up. You're
Ryan Sheckler, right?

508
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,197
Yeah, man.

509
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:21,231
Yeah, dude.

510
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,891
What's you guys' names?

511
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:23,934
Kevin.

512
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,332
Cooper.

513
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,531
- Martinez.
- Hey. J. D. How's it going?

514
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,801
So, nice to meet you guys.

515
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,137
Awesome. I'll see
you guys around.

516
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,403
- Yeah, definitely.
- Cool.

517
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,842
All right. Later.

518
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,842
Okay, everyone. Your attention.

519
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,385
First off, to the
responsible parties

520
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,320
who have abducted my bunk
and placed it in a tree,

521
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,916
I would ask for its swift return,
no questions asked.

522
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,520
And as for those photographs that have been
circulating around camp,

523
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:56,327
I can assure you, they have been
doctored and are completely fake.

524
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,992
I have never owned a donkey,

525
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:02,005
nor would I condone
any such interspecies activity.

526
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,540
Now, with that out of the way,

527
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,735
Nurse Hatcher has been treating
a rash of sunburns lately.

528
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,403
Not that we are in
any way responsible.

529
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,003
Clearly an act of God.

530
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,209
Nonetheless, we would recommend
a liberal dose of sunscreen

531
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,650
applied to the face,
arms, and legs.

532
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,711
I will now turn the floor
over to Nurse Hatcher,

533
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:18,755
who will demonstrate.

534
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,654
Nurse Hatcher, please.

535
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,085
Move it or lose it!

536
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,926
As you guys can see...

537
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:31,365
application is extremely important.

538
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:44,310
Be sure and cover
all exposed areas.

539
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:49,449
Okay. I think we get the point, Nurse Hatcher.

540
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,488
Thank you.

541
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,998
Just a quick reminder
that our annual field trip is Saturday.

542
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,901
And we have a special surprise
for you after your meal.

543
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,064
Ryan Sheckler is with us today,

544
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,803
and he will be doing a demonstration
on the street course.

545
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:16,970
Nurse Hatcher.

546
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,413
Sometimes you gotta let 'em go.

547
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,610
Dude, what do you
know about girls?

548
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:22,913
Hey, I've been in love.

549
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,081
- Girls in magazines don't count.
- Oh.

550
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,852
Dude, you gotta get over her.

551
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,119
You're depressing me.

552
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,127
Check it out.
Let me tell you a joke.

553
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,287
Your jokes are lame.

554
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,661
Dude, I'm trying to cheer you up.

555
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,701
So this horse walks into a bar,

556
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,534
and the bartender says,
"Why the long face?" And the--

557
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:45,063
Briggs, seriously, that joke sucks.

558
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,131
I don't get it.

559
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,905
It's a horse. His face is long.

560
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,639
No, no, I get that part,

561
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,840
but what kind of bar
allows horses?

562
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,117
Dude, that was my food!

563
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,193
Oh, yeah!

564
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,387
Get him!

565
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,863
Food fight!

566
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,507
Hostile bogey. Do we have--

567
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,602
Do we have permission
to engage the enemy? Do we have--

568
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,275
We are taking fire.
Do we have permission to exchange fire?

569
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,342
Do we have permission
to engage the enemy?

570
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,853
Sir, are you listening?

571
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,583
We're going down!

572
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,289
This is disgusting.

573
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,163
Man, I hope I see Malone outside.

574
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,760
Looks to me like you guys
got some work to do.

575
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,930
- What about the demo?
- What about it?

576
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:59,100
You know the rules. Nobody goes anywhere
till this place is cleaned up.

577
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,076
That's bullshit.
We all know who did this.

578
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,874
Why don't we let them clean it up?

579
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,472
Hey, Kevin, you and Malone
got some little rivalry

580
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,346
going over your girlfriend,
that's your guys' problem.

581
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,114
He does not work for me.
You do. Grab a mop.

582
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,745
Martinez, venga aqui.

583
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,088
Oh, God, that was fun!

584
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:24,595
Boys, somebody want to
tell me what's so amusing?

585
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:28,229
Nothing. Just happy
to be here. That's all.

586
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,038
Oh. I just told them
a joke, that's all.

587
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,272
Well, let's hear it, Palmer.

588
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,713
Uh...uh...okay.

589
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,647
Well, let me see
if I can remember it.

590
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,949
Oh. So this horse
walks into a bar.

591
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:45,716
And then the bartender's like,

592
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,814
"Hey, dude, why are you so sad?"

593
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:53,189
And the horse is like,
"It's all good."

594
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:57,063
And the bartender's like,
"Hey, get out of my bar."

595
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,438
Guess you had to be there.

596
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:11,708
Have Nurse Hatcher check Palmer
for possible concussion.

597
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,826
All right, $2.00.

598
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,727
All right. There's $2.00.

599
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,265
Thank you.

600
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,096
I'm gonna be in town
for a few days,

601
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,760
and what do you say
we hang out?

602
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,996
How old are you?

603
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:37,006
I'm gonna be 18
in about four years,

604
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,167
but, you know,
we can still hang out.

605
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,733
Look, I'm really flattered,

606
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,073
but your mother is--

607
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,239
Definitely do not have to bring
the mother into this.

608
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:47,977
No. Honey, your mother
is calling you.

609
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,213
- Oh.
- Ryan, let's go.

610
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,346
- They're waiting for you.
- Thanks.

611
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,691
That was awesome. I can't
believe you did--How'd you--

612
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:27,612
So, who's first?

613
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:31,017
Me!

614
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:04,044
We're not home now,
so please leave us a message.

615
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,957
How long you been
standing there?

616
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,690
A little while.

617
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,766
You look busy. I didn't want to disturb you.

618
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:54,360
Well, you did, so...

619
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:58,204
I just wanted to tell you
that I organized the walk-in.

620
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,766
Okay.

621
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,740
Is there something else
I can do for you?

622
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,009
No.

623
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,784
You know, you're freaking me out a little bit.

624
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,657
Sorry. I'll leave you alone.

625
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,892
Uh, where do you live?

626
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,491
Nearby.

627
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:29,197
You married?

628
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:35,274
Yeah. I just was interested
in what you do when you're not here.

629
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:38,712
Is it just me, or are you extra curious today?

630
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,982
You're right.
It's none of my business.

631
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,190
Uh, where are you from
originally?

632
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,187
Vermont.

633
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,106
Hi.

634
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,012
I'm impressed.

635
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,108
You're not so bad yourself.

636
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,846
Yeah. I had my eyes closed.

637
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,013
And I was skating switch.

638
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,556
No, you weren't.

639
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,888
Shut up.

640
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,192
So, dishdogz
teaching you the ropes?

641
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,129
Yeah, pretty much.

642
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,190
What about Tony?

643
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,031
What about Malone?

644
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:49,210
Sorry. I just hope I'm not messing anything up
between you and him.

645
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:52,771
You're not. There's nothing
between me and him.

646
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,214
Are you sure?

647
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:59,722
Okay, okay. I just hate being the bad guy.

648
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,315
Well, you're not the bad guy.

649
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,553
And I hate to say it,
I have to go.

650
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:07,426
I have a lot of stuff
I have to take care of.

651
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:10,728
Yeah. I've got a lot of stuff
I gotta take care of, too.

652
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,462
No, you don't.

653
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:15,300
No, I don't.

654
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,332
Thanks.

655
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,377
What's that for?

656
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,345
Skating's always better
with somebody else.

657
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,904
Yeah, it is.

658
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,325
Mind if I join you?

659
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:37,917
You scared me
to death, man.

660
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:39,962
What are you doing out here?
You following me?

661
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:44,990
No. Hey, for someone who doesn't skate,
you do pretty well.

662
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,865
I have my moments.

663
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,768
Who's Freddy Knox?

664
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,330
I never heard of him.

665
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:52,636
Really?

666
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,370
That's what I said.

667
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:58,005
Look, you want to skate
or ask me a bunch of questions?

668
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:04,218
Try to keep up.

669
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,335
Dude, did you see that?

670
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:02,810
Yeah. Yeah. What should I do?
Alert the media?

671
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,746
Oh, come on.
That was, like, 6 feet!

672
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:07,976
You know what?
Some of the best skaters I know

673
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:10,519
couldn't land that trick
if their life depended on it.

674
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:13,147
But they could take something, you know,
as simple as a Smith grind

675
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,885
and make it look
like a thing of beauty.

676
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,859
Dude, you couldn't
even land that.

677
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,919
I'm telling you, it's never about the tricks.

678
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:22,692
It's about individual expression.

679
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,064
You know, how do you skate
when nobody's looking?

680
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:28,332
That defines your style,
and that is what makes a great skateboarder:

681
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,635
style, nothing else.

682
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,265
Style.

683
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,244
What is this, movie night?

684
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:43,047
Shut up. I'm trying to teach you
something here.

685
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,643
I mean, look at this.

686
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,120
See, these guys
are the real pioneers.

687
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,451
They started out on the water.

688
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:51,654
It's like a quarter pipe
in constant motion.

689
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,457
I mean, it's not real
flashy or anything.

690
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:57,990
Everybody's cool, but they've got
their own individual expression.

691
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,969
I mean, I'm not gonna do much surfing
out here in the desert.

692
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,471
No, but it's all--look, it's fluid, liquid.

693
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,008
Apply that same logic
to the wheels

694
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,636
and just let it roll.

695
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:12,014
Hey.

696
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:14,973
You look tired.

697
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:17,519
Yeah, I'm toast.

698
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,454
Where you been?
I haven't seen you for a while.

699
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:21,990
Been real busy.

700
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,057
We should hook up soon.

701
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,496
Okay.

702
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:32,831
I'm gonna watch a movie later.

703
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:34,164
Do you want to come?

704
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:37,866
Oh, actually, I'd love to,

705
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,774
but I gotta hit the sack
early tonight.

706
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,036
Okay.

707
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,207
Suit yourself.

708
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,018
Okay.

709
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,754
See you.

710
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:02,520
This reminds me of a night a long time ago,

711
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,124
me and my buddies busted
into the Del Mar Skate Ranch.

712
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:08,261
Couldn't even see
what we were skating.

713
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,041
Go for it. Just trust your instincts.

714
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:19,308
I could trust my instincts
better if I could see.

715
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:22,249
The bowl hasn't
changed any, all right?

716
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,378
Stop whining and jump in there.

717
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,046
Come on.

718
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:29,859
You're nuts.

719
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:31,894
I'm nuts?

720
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:34,862
You're the one that's
skating in the dark.

721
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:51,945
Well, it ain't much,
but I call it home.

722
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,642
You want a beer?

723
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,446
Yeah. I'll have a beer.

724
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,986
Yeah. Dream on.

725
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,623
What?

726
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,562
Nothing, man.
I just, uh...

727
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,532
I wanted to thank you, you know, for, like--

728
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,125
- Oh!
- skating with me.

729
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,137
Hey, man, listen,
no need to thank me.

730
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,730
I kind of forgot what it was like,
just skating with friends.

731
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:20,401
Friends, huh?

732
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:23,071
Friends like, uh,
Freddy Knox?

733
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,879
Freddy Knox.

734
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:31,253
You want to know
about Freddy Knox?

735
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,720
Yeah.

736
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,050
Not much to tell.

737
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,561
Just a simple kid
from the Midwest.

738
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,961
Paper route, the whole deal.

739
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,958
Kind of a loner.

740
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:48,834
The rest of the kids were learning
to play Little League, play piano.

741
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:54,172
I just skated day and night,
and it was great.

742
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,712
Out in California, skateboarding was exploding.

743
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,715
I mean, kids my age,
they were cashing in.

744
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:04,117
I just... I don't know.

745
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,347
What?

746
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,982
Figured I had my home town
conquered, you know.

747
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:09,251
I'd take off.

748
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,589
You want to be a farmer,
you go to lowa.

749
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,822
Me, I wanted to be
a skateboarder.

750
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:19,665
So I went to California
and never went home.

751
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:22,102
I took my chances.

752
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,766
I mean, you gotta remember,
skateboarding back then

753
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,308
was just a West Coast sport.

754
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:27,934
I didn't figure
I'd have much chance

755
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,411
against all the guys
I'd heard about.

756
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,940
Yeah, some of those first contests,
they were pretty rough.

757
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:37,213
Slowly, l, I don't know,

758
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,686
got a little more confidence,

759
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,450
got better,

760
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,684
and then something happened.

761
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,522
I just started winning.

762
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:47,119
People just started
throwing money at me.

763
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:50,564
I mean, I bought a house.
I bought that car.

764
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,830
Dude, I had my own line
of skateboards

765
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,894
before I was even
old enough to vote.

766
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,304
I thought it would never end.

767
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:01,901
Then the money
began to disappear.

768
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,639
I don't know.

769
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,408
I made some bad choices.

770
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,645
Did my time, though.

771
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:11,915
Figured I'd leave
Freddy Knox behind.

772
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,650
You know, change my name,
start a new life.

773
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:16,783
Dude, you were a legend.

774
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,294
I mean, it was guys like you

775
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:20,954
that made skateboarding
what it is today.

776
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,931
I perpetuated everything
that's wrong with this sport today.

777
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,594
I sacrificed the sport that I love

778
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,637
for a taste of money and fame.

779
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:30,400
I learned to cook.

780
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:32,464
No complaints.

781
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,509
So how does the story end?

782
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,508
Look.

783
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:43,018
If I could just get one kid to skate

784
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,919
because he loves it,
you know?

785
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:49,481
It's what's in his heart,
like me when I was a kid,

786
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:52,153
that's a legacy I could live with.

787
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:54,025
Here's to your legacy.

788
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,120
This is the spot.

789
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:25,118
I don't think we're
supposed to be here.

790
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,320
We could get arrested.

791
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,864
Shot, more likely.

792
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,830
Maybe we should go.

793
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:36,235
Maybe not. You know what? That's the
problem with your whole generation.

794
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,035
You guys got no sense
of adventure.

795
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:40,132
Come here. Look at this.

796
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,142
Well, what do you think?

797
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:47,114
Whoa!

798
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:49,651
Yeah? Well, one more step
and I'll blow your brains out.

799
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,584
Easy, kemosabe.
How you doing?

800
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:52,882
You guys are
running a little late.

801
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:55,288
Yeah. I always forget
where this place is at.

802
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:56,655
Who's the rookie?

803
00:59:56,726 --> 01:00:00,253
It's Kevin.
Kevin, this is my old friend Tony Alva.

804
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,025
Well, you got
the power pool, man.

805
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,963
Skate at your own
risk, all right?

806
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,364
You heard the man.

807
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,383
You got it.

808
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,847
Hey, man, not bad for a rookie.

809
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:34,219
He's got a little something.

810
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,121
Yeah. I think you
need to hang out

811
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,523
with the old school crew, man,

812
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:40,323
because, you know,
style is everything.

813
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,296
What did I tell you?

814
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,939
Still got it. Look out.

815
01:01:56,979 --> 01:02:00,471
Yo! Hey, where you been?

816
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:04,919
Ah! You really
want to know?

817
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:07,888
I've been skating in an abandoned pool with
Tony Alva.

818
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,157
That's funny.

819
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,625
Now get serious and tell us

820
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,059
where you been
hiding lately, man.

821
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:15,120
Cassidy's bunk, perhaps?

822
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,223
Good start. Now go on.

823
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,564
Man, you wouldn't believe me if I told you.

824
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:23,799
I knew it.
Dit-dit-dit-dit.

825
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:26,603
Okay, okay!

826
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,166
Okay, so we'll see you
in a few days.

827
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,645
Now, you have my cell number
and my pager number.

828
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:35,206
And, oh! My mother's phone number
is in my office,

829
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,751
just in case of emergencies.

830
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:37,843
- Yeah.
- We all set?

831
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,581
I got it.

832
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,253
Attention, staff and counselors.

833
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,729
The buses have
left the premises.

834
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:50,265
Please...

835
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,267
disregard all rules of conduct

836
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:54,428
and concern
for your own safety!

837
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:55,732
Have fun!

838
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,642
Beautiful day, huh, Palmer?

839
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:54,459
All right, boys. You'll know our prey
by this rare marking.

840
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:59,590
He's out there somewhere.

841
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,569
Let's go get him.

842
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,751
Sit down, sit down.

843
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,423
How are you doing?

844
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:33,294
- Dude!
- Hey!

845
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,030
- What's up, dawg?
- You gettin' a tan?

846
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,537
Yeah. Trying.

847
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:38,733
Yeah, man.

848
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:39,866
Where you been?

849
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:41,534
Oh, man, I've been busy.

850
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:45,377
In fact, what are you
doing tonight?

851
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,848
Something with you.

852
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,513
Shut up.

853
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:55,853
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the lovebirds.

854
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,893
Yes. If it isn't the lovebirds.

855
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,552
Lovebirds!

856
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,756
Okay.

857
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:04,129
Just came by
to wish you luck today.

858
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,827
You're gonna be
at the road burn, right?

859
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,268
Yeah.

860
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:10,430
I'll be looking for you.

861
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:11,438
Yeah. Don't forget your helmet.

862
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,642
Yeah. You want a bun
for your wiener?

863
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,078
Oh, man.

864
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:19,079
Jesus.

865
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:21,582
Hey, what's a road burn?

866
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:23,482
You'll see.

867
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,170
Hey, you have any thoughts?

868
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:22,972
Yeah: don't die.

869
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:25,036
Okay, guys, the rules are simple.

870
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:27,548
First one down wins.

871
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:32,053
That's it. Play fair,
and I'll see you at the bottom.

872
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:33,952
Hey, what's that
on your face?

873
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:35,820
What? What is it?

874
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:38,086
It looks like a buttstache.

875
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,092
- 3...
- What's a buttstache?

876
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,425
2... 1!

877
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,521
Go!

878
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:55,164
Back! Get back.

879
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,305
Hey!

880
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:20,394
I broke that arm once...
three fingers,

881
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:22,488
front tooth, jaw,

882
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:26,023
and a dislocated shoulder...
twice.

883
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,468
Arm twice, right foot once,

884
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,971
jaw once, left foot twice,

885
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,702
collarbone once,
dislocated hip,

886
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,574
hyperextended knee...twice.

887
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:48,522
Whoa! You broke your penis?

888
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:55,726
What's the prognosis here?

889
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:58,562
Well, I wouldn't do any cartwheels
for a couple of weeks.

890
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,864
Thank you.

891
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:02,563
You're welcome.

892
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,198
Good. Let's roll. Come on.

893
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:07,071
Thank you.

894
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,474
Whoa.

895
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:22,090
I, uh... hi. I'm--

896
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,991
Hi, Tony. I'm Tara.

897
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,496
It's nice to meet you.

898
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:33,933
Okay.

899
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:39,497
Yeah. Um...

900
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,270
Time to make the doughnuts.

901
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:47,108
Relax, man. He'll get
what's comin' to him.

902
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:52,147
Hey, where are you guys going?

903
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:53,984
Gonna go break
Malone's face.

904
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:59,017
No. You know what?
I don't think you want to be doing that.

905
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:01,221
You telling me I shouldn't
stand up for myself?

906
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:04,198
No. I'm telling you
that eventually Malone is gonna get his.

907
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:05,597
Just hang back.

908
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,568
I mean, how am l
supposed to work now?

909
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:09,934
I don't know.
What, we got two weeks of camp left?

910
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:11,529
We'll figure something out.

911
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:14,098
I can't skate.
What am I even doing here?

912
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:17,373
Kevin, you're better than Malone
is any day of the week.

913
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:20,813
You don't gotta
prove that to anybody.

914
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,852
So I should just
sit back and do nothing?

915
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,779
Take a swim.

916
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:32,452
Cool off, man,
come on. Come on.

917
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,018
Take a swim?

918
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:12,656
Welcome back!

919
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,259
Can't keep a good
dog down, huh?

920
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:15,268
That's right.

921
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:16,269
Good thing you're right-handed.

922
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,437
So give us the details.
Did you close the deal?

923
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:20,770
Close the deal?

924
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,368
Give the kid a break.
He doesn't kiss and tell.

925
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,709
Not to mention Cassidy
is a respectable girl...

926
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,840
with amazing breasts.

927
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,013
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

928
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:32,348
I totally spaced on our date.

929
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:33,513
You forgot your date.

930
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:35,022
Dawg, you're screwed!

931
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:37,622
What do I do?

932
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:40,184
You're gonna have to
make it up to her.

933
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:41,490
Get down.

934
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:44,464
Make it up to her?

935
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:53,364
Kevin.

936
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:57,274
So cute!

937
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:58,643
Thank you.

938
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:04,949
You look amazing.

939
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,385
Thank you.

940
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,685
I'm impressed.

941
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:12,422
I have to warn you.

942
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,325
If I start nodding off,

943
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:15,863
it's not because of you.

944
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:17,922
- It's because of the painkillers.
- Okay.

945
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:21,935
Your waiter will be
right with you.

946
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,403
Thank you.

947
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:29,239
Heh!

948
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,316
Good evening.
Welcome to Chez Tony.

949
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,215
I am Tony.

950
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:39,151
I have prepared for you this evening my
specialty:

951
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,155
a pasta primavera
in a white wine sauce.

952
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:42,656
I'm sure you'll like it
very much.

953
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,659
Would you like a salad
or anything to start?

954
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:47,491
Sounds great. Thank you.

955
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:51,926
Madame.

956
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,024
Thanks.

957
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:54,626
Sir.

958
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:55,635
Enjoy.

959
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,331
Not to be outdone, I took the liberty

960
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:59,874
of providing for your listening pleasure
the house entertainment.

961
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:02,911
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Juan Martinez Experience.

962
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,290
Tonight was really special.

963
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:27,392
Thank you.

964
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,562
Yeah.

965
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:33,130
Believe it or not,
it was my first date.

966
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,906
I know.

967
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:39,971
No. It was mine, too.

968
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:41,037
Really?

969
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:42,140
Yeah.

970
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,879
That's cute!

971
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:48,480
Well, I guess
I will talk to you...

972
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,430
tomorrow.

973
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,404
Okay.

974
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,498
Bye. See you later.

975
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:08,008
Bye.

976
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:23,351
What is this?

977
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,791
"Dishdogz."

978
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:35,632
Keep what legacy alive?

979
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,382
Hey.

980
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:52,253
Hey, what's up?

981
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,913
Tough luck out there.

982
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,082
I guess you were just
out of your league.

983
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:59,423
I'll tell you what,
why don't we just bury the hatchet?

984
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:03,261
I could sign your cast. Maybe it'll be
worth something someday.

985
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:12,296
Settle down, people.
Please, can I have your attention?

986
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:14,399
Just a few announcements.

987
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:17,206
Well, it's been another great year
here at Point X.

988
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:19,406
No lawsuits, no deaths--

989
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,108
well, except for Nurse Kaplan,

990
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,946
which was through
no fault of her own.

991
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,851
And I hope to see all of you here again next
year.

992
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:29,322
Now, before I let you go out
and enjoy your final day with us,

993
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:32,224
I'd like to thank
the staff and counselors

994
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:38,062
for once again making this
the greatest camp in the world.

995
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:41,000
Also, I'd like to recognize a group of people

996
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:44,630
who do a very difficult job
and go largely unrecognized.

997
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:47,106
Tony, the kitchen crew,

998
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,972
come out here, you guys.

999
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:57,081
Guys, we had a pretty
good summer, you know?

1000
01:15:57,152 --> 01:16:00,121
I hope you guys liked the food.

1001
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:01,678
So that's what they call it.

1002
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,590
We enjoyed serving you.

1003
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,493
Most of you, anyway.

1004
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:11,021
Not you so much.
You think you're cool.

1005
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:13,260
You think you know
a couple of hot tricks.

1006
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:15,633
That makes you the world's
greatest skater, huh?

1007
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,729
You got no style.

1008
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:19,933
Dude, he's calling you out.

1009
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:21,976
What do you know
about style, old man?

1010
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:24,137
Hey, you better
show him some respect.

1011
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,804
Or what?

1012
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:31,217
To the bowl. To the bowl.

1013
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:34,517
It sounds like you guys are going to the bowl.

1014
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:38,151
Him? You want me
to go up against Kevin?

1015
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:40,694
Well, that would be too easy.

1016
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:45,096
Settle down, people.
We don't have liability for this kind of stuff.

1017
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:46,634
No, no, no, Miles.

1018
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:49,398
I think everybody would like to see this,
am I right?

1019
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:52,235
Yeah!

1020
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:54,605
To the bowl! To the bowl!

1021
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,871
To the bowl! To the bowl!

1022
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,412
Just tell me when.

1023
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,947
How about now?

1024
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:02,245
All right. Let's go.

1025
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:05,150
To the bowl! To the bowl!

1026
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,172
Hey, hey, what's going on?

1027
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:31,542
I think Kevin and Malone are gonna
have a gunfight at the bowl or something.

1028
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:33,240
What?

1029
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:50,554
Man, I don't know.
I'm not so sure about this.

1030
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:51,894
You're better than he is.

1031
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:53,798
You'll kick his ass or I will.

1032
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:55,302
And I'll jump in.

1033
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,463
Kevin, you're gonna
shred his ass, okay?

1034
01:17:57,539 --> 01:17:59,530
Just don't show any fear, okay?

1035
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,576
I've seen you skate, man,
and you're better than him.

1036
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:04,305
- Dude!
- You speak English?

1037
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:06,176
Yeah. When did that happen?

1038
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:08,682
I was born in ldaho.

1039
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,184
- ldaho's not in Mexico.
- What?

1040
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:13,346
I was born--

1041
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:14,582
But why?

1042
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:15,884
Because you never asked me.

1043
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:17,049
What?

1044
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:19,252
Listen, dawg. Take in
the back door boys.

1045
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:21,921
We gonna stand here all day,
or are we gonna skate?

1046
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:24,431
Call it in the air.

1047
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:26,899
Heads.

1048
01:18:26,968 --> 01:18:28,731
You first.

1049
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:31,303
- Get him.
- Go, Kevin, go.

1050
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:21,444
- You the man!
- Whoa!

1051
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:24,349
- Oh, no way!
- Go!

1052
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:35,751
Hey, Mom.

1053
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:37,917
Yeah, I'm fine.

1054
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:43,488
No. I just wanted to let you know
that I'm gonna be home soon.

1055
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:47,695
Yeah. Yeah, it was good.

1056
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:52,502
Okay. Well, I love you.

1057
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,565
See you soon.

1058
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:56,601
Bye.

1059
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:09,556
Thanks.

1060
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:12,624
I hate this part.

1061
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:16,696
I do.

1062
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:20,861
How about... I'll see you
in a couple weeks.

1063
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,460
Okay.

1064
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:33,303
Bye.

1065
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:20,923
Hey.

1066
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:24,659
So I didn't think we could do it,

1067
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,394
but we beat him.

1068
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:27,696
Ha! You beat him.

1069
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:29,532
But don't let it go to your head,

1070
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:31,970
or I'll come back and kick your butt
personally, you got it?

1071
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,371
Yeah.

1072
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:36,569
I do want you to remember
the things we talked about, though.

1073
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:38,612
You know, about being
your own man,

1074
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,511
having a little style.

1075
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:43,974
I'm my own man.

1076
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:46,111
Right.

1077
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:49,156
All right, Tony. See ya.

1078
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:51,283
Kevin.

1079
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,486
Well, it's been good
having you here,

1080
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:55,722
and I wanted to offer
you a position

1081
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:57,162
as camp counselor next year.

1082
01:23:57,232 --> 01:23:58,824
That is, if you're interested.

1083
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:02,836
Oh! Camp counselor.
I'm flattered.

1084
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:05,236
I don't know what to tell you.

1085
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:07,900
Well, I guess this is it.

1086
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:12,079
See you next year?

1087
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:13,614
I hope so.

1088
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:15,512
Well, you better,
'cause we sure as hell

1089
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,574
don't want to train
some other fool.

1090
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:19,017
All right, we're even now.

1091
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:20,418
You coming with us?

1092
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:22,046
No, man. I'm cool.

1093
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:23,590
All right. Well, you take care.

1094
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:27,253
Let me get my keys.

1095
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:28,386
Here.

1096
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:34,300
See you next year.

1097
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:35,393
Yeah. See you guys.

1098
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:38,303
Why are they dressed
in paper diapers?

1099
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:40,341
I don't want to know.

1100
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:42,103
So what do you say?

1101
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:45,271
You know what?

1102
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:48,440
If I'm gonna come back,
and it's gonna be all the same,

1103
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:51,041
I think I'd rather be a dishdog.

1104
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:54,213
Okay. For what it's worth,

1105
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:56,223
I'm glad you smoked
Malone's ass.

1106
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:58,350
I never liked that little prick.

1107
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:04,028
Oh, man.

1108
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,431
I gotta get out of here.

1109
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:19,706
You ready?

1110
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:21,043
Yeah.
