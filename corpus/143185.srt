1
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,712
I missed you.

2
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,759
Door shut.

3
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,672
Fix your collar.

4
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,510
- What do we got here?
- Looks like a shooting.

5
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,999
- Inside?
- Yeah.

6
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,158
- Is this clear all up through here?
- Yeah, it's clean.

7
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,473
- Who is the first officer?
- Pinola, sir. He's inside.

8
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,598
Central took a call from a neighbour,
wouldn't give a name...

9
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,877
...at 8:23, that there was a rape
and a robbery going on here.

10
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,076
- What time is it, Dickey?
- 9:01.

11
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,991
Get this gentleman's name, would you?
How are you doing?

12
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,394
- Pinola, how are you doing?
- Good.

13
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,397
Who's smoking in here?

14
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,668
Come on.

15
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,953
Tom, you done with the photos?

16
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,870
Yes, sir.

17
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,918
Did you get close on the blood
and the butts in the ashtray?

18
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,831
- Yes, sir.
- Great. Thanks.

19
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,912
Give me some gloves, please.

20
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,719
Here you go, sir.

21
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,879
No lividity.

22
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,557
She hasn't been gone long.

23
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,876
Go on, Dickey. Take a look at her.

24
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,471
You may forget the woman you were with
last night, but you won't forget her.

25
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,796
Pinola, she was dead when you came in?

26
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,429
Yes, sir. I couldn't find a pulse in her, sir.

27
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,839
What time was that?

28
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,433
About 8:40.

29
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
- 8:42 exactly.
- We got any witnesses?

30
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,953
- No.
- No defence cuts. Fingernails are clean.

31
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,469
Why don't you check the windows
and the doors?

32
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,519
Boy, whoever did this
fucked up all over the place.

33
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,636
This is the <i>Gong Show</i> of murder.

34
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,319
What's her name?

35
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,791
- Felicity Turner.
- Married?

36
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,237
Yes, has a daughter, too.
She doesn't know. She's out with friends.

37
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,438
Lamar says maybe rape and robbery.

38
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,195
Is that what you say, Dickey-boy?

39
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,915
That's right.

40
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,710
She's wearing a gold watch, Lamar.

41
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,278
Robbers don't leave gold watches behind,
do they?

42
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,518
See that hole in the head?

43
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,716
You know what that is?
A hard contact wound.

44
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,429
You must be angry enough to press
the gun smack against the head to do that.

45
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,670
His Unhappiness shot her in the bathroom.

46
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,671
First in the head, then in the chest.

47
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,639
He left her lying in there,
and left the bullet in the bathroom wall.

48
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,999
Then he sat around a bit thinking about
what he had done, sweating up his socks.

49
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,156
Maybe he had a cigarette or two.

50
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,315
He started getting the idea
his life was over.

51
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,473
So he drags her out the bathroom into the
kitchen trying to make it look like a rape.

52
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,714
Then he calls the police.
He hadn't fucked up enough...

53
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,395
...so he goes back in the bathroom,
begins to clean the blood off the wall.

54
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,479
Never heard of a rapist or robber
who does your apartment afterwards.

55
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,353
You won't find any signs of forced entry
because it wasn't a rape or robbery.

56
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,033
It was her old man.

57
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,669
You find him...

58
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,792
...you find the gun that put the bullet
in the bathroom wall.

59
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,989
There's no reason
he would have thrown it away.

60
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,429
He's done everything else wrong.

61
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,597
Are you ready for me to take her?

62
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,113
She's all yours.

63
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,315
Deceased is black female...

64
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,196
...approximately 35 years of age.

65
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,110
You don't much like it here,
do you, Lamar?

66
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,994
I'm fine.

67
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,271
He likes it. He just doesn't know why.

68
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,395
What do you mean?

69
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,630
It makes you feel alive
to see somebody dead.

70
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,199
Lamar here.

71
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,475
What's up?

72
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,028
Her husband was just picked up
at the bus station...

73
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,352
...with a.32 calibre in his BVD's,
and they're taking him to the office.

74
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,910
- Looks like a.32 to me.
- Yep.

75
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,156
Kill someone in Brayton,
Kyle Bodine is going to get you.

76
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,237
I don't think it takes any brains.

77
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,955
Murderers are dumb shits.
They always screw it up sooner or later.

78
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,316
Lamar, you shouldn't be doing this.

79
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,154
This is nothing that a man like you
should be spending his life at.

80
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,834
- I don't see her.
- Who?

81
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,512
My dancing lady.

82
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,998
Maybe she's here, maybe not,
but if I see her, I'm going to fall in love.

83
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,239
I can just feel it.

84
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,913
- What did you forget?
- My wallet. I left it in the car.

85
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,797
I'll be back in a minute.

86
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,755
Hello.

87
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,629
Mind some company?

88
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,031
Am I safe talking to you?

89
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,119
I don't know. We live in dangerous times.

90
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,676
And we meet in dangerous places.

91
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,156
I've had too much to drink in this one.

92
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,675
I know another one.

93
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,109
No. There is something about tonight
that wants a place like this.

94
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,993
It's where you end a holiday.

95
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,640
- You've been on a holiday?
- Sort of.

96
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,036
I don't much like holidays.

97
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,675
Poor baby.

98
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,472
Are you an orphan?

99
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,636
Yeah. I'm an orphan of destiny.

100
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,551
I see life in all its dirty details.

101
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,313
- You know how it is.
- Sure I know how it is.

102
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,431
- You had a hard day.
- You could say that.

103
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,511
And you'd like to relieve the stress.

104
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,432
Sounds like a good idea to me.

105
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,236
Only maybe you are confusing me
with another kind of woman.

106
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,199
No, I'm not confusing anything.

107
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,632
Maybe it's just me.

108
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,356
- I have to go.
- Wait. I thought we were doing good here.

109
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,396
- We were. Now I have to leave.
- Don't go, please.

110
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,751
- Let me start all over again.
- You started just fine.

111
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,513
In fact, you just about
swept me off my feet.

112
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,990
- I did?
- I said "just about."

113
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,116
I really do have to go. I'm expected.

114
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,434
So why are you here?

115
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,149
I thought I'd meet somebody interesting.
And I have.

116
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,948
- So there's no sweeping you off your feet?
- No.

117
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,230
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

118
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,796
But I can't help admiring real effort.

119
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,119
Here she is.

120
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,873
Thanks a lot.

121
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,394
Rachel?

122
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,597
Rachel, what are you doing out here?

123
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,670
Just getting some fresh air.

124
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,431
You're out here drinking.

125
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,759
It don't look good, you being out here
drinking so the damn neighbours can see.

126
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,193
They're all asleep.

127
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,633
Where were you?

128
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,357
Playing cards. I told you.

129
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,074
I forgot.

130
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,432
You always forget.

131
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,390
I don't want you out here
drinking anymore.

132
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,834
Rachel?

133
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,278
That's your name, isn't it? Rachel Munro.

134
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,876
- Do I know you?
- We met last night.

135
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,313
Last night?

136
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,230
I'm sorry. I didn't recognise you.
I don't have my contacts.

137
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,628
Kyle Bodine.

138
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,954
Rachel.

139
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,913
You already know.

140
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,989
How'd you find me?

141
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,515
It wasn't hard.

142
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,637
I wanted to apologise
if I said anything stupid.

143
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,039
No, you didn't.

144
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,997
I just had to leave early.
I had a little too much to drink is all.

145
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,873
I don't do that very much.

146
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,598
It was a holiday you told me.

147
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,194
- Did I?
- Yeah.

148
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,350
- What else did I tell you?
- Not a lot.

149
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,832
You're lying, aren't you?

150
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,670
I'd like to see you sometime.

151
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,388
That's not possible.

152
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,153
- Anything is possible.
- Not that. I'm sorry.

153
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,037
Maybe I'll call you anyway.

154
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,957
I'll call the police.

155
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,835
Call me.

156
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,319
How much is that one?

157
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,434
This one?

158
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,749
What do you want
with a big nine millimetre?

159
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,955
How much is it?

160
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,999
$600.

161
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,440
And I'll throw in a couple of clips.

162
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,392
What did you do today?

163
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,592
Put in some new flowers.

164
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,671
The azaleas are coming in.

165
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,116
I saw them. They look real nice.

166
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,714
You guys hungry?

167
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,158
You sure as hell look hungry.

168
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,719
Here you go.

169
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,310
Did she forget to feed you again?

170
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,950
- Something wrong, honey?
- What do you mean?

171
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,396
Well, you're acting like
you're keeping something from me.

172
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,912
Well, how am I acting?

173
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,440
Like I'm having a wild sexual affair?

174
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,716
Are you?

175
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,110
No.

176
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,909
Are you?

177
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,352
Why do you say that?

178
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,399
Excuse me.

179
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,674
Sit down, goddamn it. I'm talking to you.

180
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,349
Shit.

181
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,437
Homicide. Dickey.

182
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,353
Mr. Kyle Bodine.

183
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,791
Who should I say is calling?

184
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,509
Hold on.

185
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,471
It's for you. She's got no name.

186
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,469
Hello.

187
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,189
How are you doing?

188
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,831
Sure. Where?

189
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,709
Yeah, what time?

190
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,438
All right. I'll see you then.

191
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,430
'Bye.

192
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,079
You're not married, right?

193
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,635
No.

194
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,394
How come?

195
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,999
I don't know.

196
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,552
Married to your work?

197
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,154
You don't look like a real detective.

198
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,829
You're supposed to wear white socks,
aren't you?

199
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,512
What colour are your socks?

200
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,235
Blue...

201
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,909
...and black.

202
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,713
- You're very colourful.
- It's what detectives wear.

203
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,552
- Do you carry a gun?
- Yes, I do.

204
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,436
Where?

205
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,153
May I see it?

206
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,396
What are you going to do, shoot the chef?

207
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,518
- What kind is it?
- It's a.38, two-inch, snub-nose...

208
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,118
...because of the short barrel.

209
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,077
You never shot anyone, have you?

210
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,193
Not really.

211
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,556
I bet you wouldn't tell me if you had.

212
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,039
Thank you.

213
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,597
- 'Bye, honey.
- 'Bye.

214
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,398
- You take care, now.
- You, too.

215
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,479
I'll call you.

216
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,278
Watch your dress.

217
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,789
Thanks.

218
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,559
You want to go out?

219
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,272
Look at that moon.

220
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,314
My grandmother used to call that
a "china moon"...

221
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,396
...like a big old plate of china.

222
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,315
She said people would get affected
by that...

223
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,711
...that they'd do strange things.

224
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,438
Do you believe that?

225
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,233
I don't know.
Are you going to do something strange?

226
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,710
I do feel like it sometimes.

227
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,232
You're so beautiful.

228
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,512
What do you do out here?

229
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,036
Drink beer, row around the lake,
just get kind of stupid.

230
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,392
Go skinny-dipping.

231
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,755
The water is so nice and warm.

232
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,152
You ought to jump in.

233
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,435
It's okay?

234
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,748
Yeah, sure.

235
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,109
Go ahead.

236
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,873
It's wonderful.

237
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,594
Are you coming in?

238
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,276
Put your arms around me.

239
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,913
Kiss me.

240
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,432
Why did you cry?

241
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,709
Tell me.

242
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,877
It's your tenderness.

243
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,236
I haven't had much of that.

244
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,713
How bad is it?

245
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,313
I don't want to talk about him,
not when I'm with you.

246
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,279
Wait a minute.

247
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,153
What's going on?

248
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,793
Talk to me.

249
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,556
- Just talk to me.
- I can't.

250
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,115
Okay.

251
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,752
All right. You don't have to.
It's all right. Come on.

252
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,679
Mr. Bodine.

253
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,519
Speak, Dickey-boy.

254
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,350
So, what do you do for boredom?

255
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,793
I never had the problem.

256
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,515
Bullshit. You've got the most boring life
a man ever lived.

257
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,750
You'll grow into it. Trust me.

258
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,679
Three-pointer.

259
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,829
See that?

260
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,069
Call the Pistons.

261
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,834
- Sign the kid for $5 million.
- It could happen.

262
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,719
Yeah, and I'll still be pulling down
$26,500 a year.

263
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,949
And worth every goddamn cent, right?

264
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,549
Right.

265
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,792
What colour was his T-shirt?

266
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,672
- Who?
- The kid who made the basket.

267
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,909
White.

268
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,194
- How the hell would I know?
- You wouldn't, you've got no eye for detail.

269
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,435
Well, I think I do when it's important.

270
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,795
It's always important. Everything you see.

271
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,916
Everything minute of the day.

272
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,072
But you don't see nothing
because you're bored.

273
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,191
Lamar, the kid wasn't wearing a shirt.

274
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,950
You're an okay cop, but these
are keeping you from being a good cop.

275
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,030
Then why did you partner with me?
I mean, you had a choice.

276
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,675
I keep hoping
you might surprise me some day.

277
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,711
Well, one day I might.

278
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,992
Don't strain yourself.

279
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,549
I might be incapable of surprise.

280
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,117
It could be in this lifetime
I'm all surprised out.

281
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,115
Hi.

282
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,074
Kyle.

283
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,991
I waited for you all day.

284
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,710
- Did you miss me?
- Yes.

285
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,630
- So, how is she?
- Who?

286
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,552
Your Cinderella.

287
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,913
Come on. I tell you everything
and what do you tell me?

288
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,309
Who's dead and who's done it.

289
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,800
You don't want to tell me about it, do you?

290
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,394
How come?

291
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,513
You think I'm going to
take her away from you?

292
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,149
All right. Good shot.

293
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,238
- Is she putting out for you?
- I got nothing going on.

294
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,991
Fuck you.

295
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,752
- Are you going to get upset?
- Perhaps.

296
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,758
Please don't, Lamar.

297
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,752
We have to talk.

298
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,315
Listen, I want to forget this.

299
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,954
What do you mean?

300
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,353
Take me for a ride?

301
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,708
In this?

302
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,119
How well can you swim?

303
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,997
How soon they forget.

304
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,872
I will never forget.

305
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,111
You want to go inside?

306
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,272
I envy you, Kyle.

307
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,554
You're so comfortable in yourself.

308
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,598
I wish I could be you.

309
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,193
What's wrong?

310
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,914
I'm in a trap. I can't get out of it.

311
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,159
Divorce him.

312
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,633
I love you.

313
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,917
I know I can't give you what he can.

314
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,395
- That's not it.
- Whatever I got, it's yours.

315
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,913
Whatever you want, I'll get.

316
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,958
- Whatever you need, I'll do.
- Kyle, stop, please.

317
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,798
You got to decide.

318
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,236
You either stand up to him and leave him...

319
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,073
...or you stay with him
and you try to work it out.

320
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,199
Rachel, my God.

321
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,551
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

322
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,711
I wanted to surprise you.

323
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,433
Mr. Munro, you have a call, sir.
He won't give his name, says it's personal.

324
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,359
Rupert Munro.

325
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,597
Who the fuck is this?

326
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,953
What don't make much sense to me
is why two smart guys like us...

327
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,469
...chose this poor-ass police life.

328
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,670
I had a reason for doing it.

329
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,433
It'll come to me.

330
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,310
<i>Any unit that is 10-8, can you take an 877,</i>
<i>domestic in progress, 201 Cypress.</i>

331
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,837
CID 159. We're close.
We'll respond to 201 Cypress.

332
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,194
<i>Roger 159.</i>

333
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,078
Since when are we doing
domestic violence?

334
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,238
CID 159. We're 1097, code 4.

335
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,639
We'll handle it.

336
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,597
<i>C/D 159. 10-4.</i>

337
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,350
Police.

338
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,596
- Everything's fine.
- Sir, you live here?

339
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,159
Nothing happened really.

340
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,793
- Do you live here?
- Yes, I do.

341
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,154
What's your name?

342
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,637
My name is Rupert Munro.
I'm with the Munro American Bank.

343
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,029
- Yes, I know who you are.
- Where's your wife?

344
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,235
She's inside.

345
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,514
She's fine.

346
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,875
This is nothing. It's embarrassing, is all.

347
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,633
We'll speak with one of you inside
and the other outside.

348
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,915
- What's going on?
- We're going to look inside.

349
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,594
Nothing happened. This is stupid.

350
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,869
Mr. Munro, why don't you
come over here and have a seat?

351
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,429
Sit down.

352
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,633
Mrs. Munro?

353
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,394
Rachel?

354
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,354
Oh, baby.

355
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,829
- Kyle?
- Are you all right?

356
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,957
He got a call. He's been seeing someone.

357
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,033
Are you all right, ma'am?

358
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,470
Do you want us to arrest your husband?

359
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,518
Lamar, I'll take care of this.
Get back outside with Munro.

360
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,069
Okay.

361
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,470
You want us to take him in?

362
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,518
What good would it do?

363
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,317
He'd be out tomorrow, wouldn't he?

364
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,949
Probably.

365
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,992
Nice house, Mr. Munro.

366
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,834
How much you pay for a place like this?

367
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,436
None of your goddamn business.

368
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,110
Your wife doesn't want
to have you arrested.

369
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,351
It was just a little spat.
You don't get arrested for a spat.

370
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,913
Don't touch her again.

371
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,355
- Who are you talking to?
- You, fuck.

372
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,351
Got a smart mouth, little man.

373
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,237
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

374
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,958
Why didn't you tell me?

375
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,437
Rachel, you don't have to put up with him.

376
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,117
Divorce the son of a bitch.

377
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,713
Get rid of him.

378
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,314
Yes, you're right. I want to get rid of him.

379
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,951
I've dreamed it hundred times.

380
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,630
Every night. All night long.

381
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,033
I bought a gun.

382
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,748
Where is it?

383
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,993
I want it. Where is it?

384
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,719
- I could fly to Miami.
- What are you talking about?

385
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,270
- I wait a day, drive back at night, and do it.
- What's happening to you?

386
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,000
- Just sit down for a second.
- No, I'm okay.

387
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,951
Come on, just sit down.

388
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,954
- No.
- What?

389
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,349
Don't.

390
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,079
Let me go.

391
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,274
Come here. Open the door.

392
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,279
Mrs. Munro, you're in 330
and you have a letter.

393
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,831
- Your bags'll be right up. Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.

394
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,197
Kyle, where were you?

395
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,757
- What do you mean?
- We were to be in court this morning.

396
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,596
Nobody can get a hold of you
and the lawyer is screaming for dismissal.

397
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,511
What's going on with you?

398
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,552
I'll be right out.

399
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,354
Hello, Kyle.

400
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,000
- How are you?
- Not too bad. How about yourself?

401
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,399
Good to see you.

402
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,438
- I need you to make a call for me.
- Sure. Anything you want.

403
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,478
- I want you to call the police.
- I thought you was the police.

404
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,879
Pack of smokes.

405
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,232
<i>BPD 197, 877, domestic in progress.</i>

406
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,193
<i>201 Cypress. BPD 184, 1099.</i>

407
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,712
- 201 Cypress. That's Munro's place.
- Yeah.

408
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,553
CID 159, we were there before, 201
Cypress.

409
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,830
<i>BPD 197 and 184, 1022.</i>
<i>C/D 159, / show you hand/ing.</i>

410
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,596
What do you want?

411
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,433
A neighbour reported
a woman here calling out for help.

412
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,077
Not here.

413
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,516
Maybe I could speak with your wife.

414
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,873
She's in Miami.

415
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,039
Thank you, sir.

416
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,915
Kyle.

417
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,751
I was looking all over for you.

418
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,752
I had to get away.

419
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,038
I was crazed that night.
I just needed some time.

420
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,078
I called you and called you,
but you didn't answer.

421
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,233
I rented a car so I could come back tonight.

422
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,356
I don't care about him anymore.

423
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,831
I have to be with you, Kyle.

424
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,109
Don't ever leave me like that again.

425
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,159
I'm sorry.

426
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,353
Can we go away?

427
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,710
Yeah.

428
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,828
You mean it?

429
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,433
Let's go today.

430
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,718
I love you.

431
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,276
- You want me to come in with you?
- No, if he comes in you can't be there.

432
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,476
- How much time do you need?
- Fifteen minutes.

433
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,437
All right. I'll wait in the street.

434
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,148
Rupert?

435
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,239
Are you coming or going?

436
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,351
Now, just hold on there a minute.

437
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,396
I'm leaving.

438
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,153
Now, give me the bag,
and we'll talk about this.

439
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,116
No.

440
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,838
Give me the bag.

441
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,748
What we got in here?
Everything but the kitchen sink, my God.

442
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,596
I'm calling the police.

443
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,359
Don't you touch me.

444
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,036
We'll talk about it in the morning.

445
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,273
I just want my conjugal rights.

446
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,473
- Let me go!
- You're not going anywhere.

447
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,556
- Where did you get that?
- Get away.

448
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,389
Rachel, give me the gun.

449
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,709
Get away.

450
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,350
- Rachel.
- Get away!

451
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,555
Rachel?

452
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,114
Oh, Jesus.

453
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,874
What happened?

454
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,236
He threw me against the wall.

455
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,598
He wouldn't let me go.

456
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,950
I thought he was going to kill me.

457
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,310
I've got to call the police.
It's justifiable homicide.

458
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,279
- You can't.
- Lf I don't call the police, it's a murder.

459
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,271
It's an unregistered gun.

460
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,238
I didn't check out of the hotel.
They'll say I came back here to kill him.

461
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,119
Did you?

462
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,749
No.

463
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,196
You've got to help me, Kyle, please.

464
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,993
If you ever loved me, trust me now.
Put down the phone, please.

465
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,349
I'll go to prison. Help me.

466
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,712
You said you'd protect me. Do it now.
Don't call them.

467
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,869
Please.

468
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,638
Put down the phone.

469
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,235
Okay.

470
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,919
A nine millimetre.

471
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,518
- How many times did you shoot him?
- Twice.

472
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,039
- Where were you, and where was he?
- I was here. He was over there.

473
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,676
Give me a change of clothes,
and I need some rope.

474
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,079
Some rope and some sacks.

475
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,597
Go back to the car.
Get the sacks and the rope.

476
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,439
Be right back.

477
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,836
If they begin to suspect us,
they're going to say all kinds of things...

478
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,911
...to try to turn us against each other.

479
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,272
They'll try to make us betray each other,
and you can't believe them.

480
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,111
- Just tell me what to do.
- You go straight to the hotel.

481
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,397
Don't let anybody see you go in,
and don't call me.

482
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,355
- Here you are, ma'am.
- Thank you.

483
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,950
- Hello.
- <i>Ky/e, / know you said not to ca//.</i>

484
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,109
Hold on.

485
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,508
- Are you all right?
- I can't go back there.

486
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,395
<i>You have to.</i>

487
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,639
Call his office.

488
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,349
Wait a day. Then call the police.

489
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,676
<i>Rache/, you can't ca// me here again.</i>
<i>You understand?</i>

490
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,869
Okay.

491
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,030
<i>/'// ca// you when / can.</i>

492
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,435
- How come you're so quiet about this girl?
- What do you want to know?

493
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,796
- She's got long fingernails?
- Not particularly, no.

494
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,830
How come you're all cut up?

495
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,709
Hi, June, I'd like to speak to Rupert, please.

496
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,237
He hasn't come in yet, Mrs. Munro.
We're trying to locate him right now.

497
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,870
- Would you have him call me when you do?
- <i>Yes, / wi//.</i>

498
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,188
Thank you.

499
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,200
Kyle, remember the bank, Munro?

500
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,598
- We're out at his house?
- Yeah.

501
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:04,116
His little wife just reported him
missing in action.

502
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,154
Thanks.

503
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,508
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

504
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,318
The day after you were here.

505
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,549
Thursday last?

506
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,870
Yes, it's the day I went to Miami.

507
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,150
And you came back yesterday?

508
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,678
Did you call your husband
while you were in Miami?

509
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,749
No.

510
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,638
Do you know if he was in any danger,
if there was anyone...

511
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,870
...that might wish to harm him?
- No.

512
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,878
- Has he done this before?
- Has he done what?

513
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,389
- Travelled unexpectedly?
- No.

514
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,908
You mind if we take a look
around the house?

515
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,274
Go ahead.

516
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,629
Thank you.

517
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,469
Was your husband here alone
while you were away?

518
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,629
Yes.

519
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,315
Did you notice anything funny
about the house when you came back?

520
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,475
No.

521
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,910
No open doors or windows?

522
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,109
No.

523
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,991
- How long has that been broken?
- A couple of weeks.

524
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,110
They're easy enough to fix, you know.

525
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,713
How'd it break?

526
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,078
Closing it, I think.

527
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,518
What kind of car was your husband driving,
ma'am?

528
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,079
Black Buick.

529
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,511
- You want to canvas?
- Yeah.

530
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,433
Let's take a look at the rest
of the house first.

531
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,110
- Did you see how nervous she was?
- Was she?

532
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,670
She was so tight you could have bounced
a golf ball off of her.

533
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,479
The window was jammed. It didn't move.

534
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,275
Yeah, so?

535
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,839
She was lying.

536
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,953
You think she was lying
about the rest of it?

537
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,473
I don't know.

538
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,515
- What's up?
- It's his car.

539
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,199
It's clean.

540
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,913
- How long's it been here?
- We don't know.

541
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,431
Light bulb here is busted.

542
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,996
Someone knew what they were doing.

543
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,392
They'll want to see you again.

544
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,596
- Why?
- They found his car.

545
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,990
- They're going to ask you some questions.
- I'm scared.

546
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,469
It's going to be okay.
You just got to stick with your story.

547
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,792
She's a cuckoo bird.

548
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,953
She's had psychiatric care
for four years off and on.

549
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,476
She tried to commit suicide
with a mouth full of valiums...

550
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,353
...and she's filed for divorce two times.

551
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,319
Munro's car was wiped clean.
No fingerprints.

552
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,236
If this was murder,
someone knew what they were doing.

553
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,871
It wasn't no cuckoo bird.

554
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,519
Good work.

555
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,238
Will you please state your name
and present address?

556
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,035
Mrs. Rachel Munro.
I live at 201 Cypress Avenue.

557
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,753
The evening we were called
to your residence, July 17...

558
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,592
...did your husband strike you?

559
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,874
I guess he did.

560
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,029
Why?

561
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,313
I don't know.

562
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,871
We have arguments sometimes.

563
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:46,438
- What was the argument on that night?
- You don't have to answer that.

564
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:51,508
My husband was accusing me
of having an extramarital affair.

565
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,068
Had you?

566
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,473
Mr. Dickey, my client is here
to make a statement...

567
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,836
...regarding where she was at the time,
not her sexual druthers.

568
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:04,390
- How many times did he strike you?
- It wasn't much of anything.

569
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,753
In Detective Bodine's report,
it states there are clear signs...

570
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,239
...of physical abuse.

571
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,514
A slap.

572
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,558
What happened after Detective Dickey
and I left your home?

573
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,189
I slept on the side porch,
and in the morning I called a taxi.

574
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,558
It took me to the airport,
and I took a 10:00 flight to Miami.

575
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,311
You were there Thursday through Sunday,
returning Monday morning.

576
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,469
Yes.

577
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,594
Did you call your husband from the hotel?

578
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,189
No.

579
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,233
I wanted to be alone.

580
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,630
- Did you call anyone else?
- No.

581
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,914
- You returned Monday the 22nd, right?
- Right.

582
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,558
- What time did you arrive?
- About 11:00.

583
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:52,154
- Did you call anyone when you got home?
- Yes.

584
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,355
Who did you call?

585
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,874
- The first person?
- Yeah.

586
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,275
I phoned my husband's office.

587
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,758
I spoke to his secretary.

588
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,398
Who else did you call?

589
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,549
No one.

590
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,315
I thought if your husband was the first,
there would have been someone else.

591
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,551
There was no one else.

592
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,236
Saturday night before your husband
was first missed...

593
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,998
...a neighbour noticed your houselights
were on until 3:00 in the morning.

594
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,958
- Could someone have been there?
- I don't know.

595
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,672
Mrs. Munro, we're going to want
to take another look at the house.

596
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,878
- Are they inside?
- Yeah.

597
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,999
Maybe they'll find him under the bed.

598
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,833
- Where was she?
- She was in Miami at the Registry Hotel.

599
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,114
Checked in Thursday last,
checked out Monday morning.

600
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,988
Now, Saturday night at 9:37,
she called her husband here...

601
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,910
...and got him just before he went out.

602
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,959
At 11:41 p.m., she called him again
at the Brayton Country Club.

603
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,235
She said she didn't call anyone
from the hotel.

604
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,072
Yeah, that's what she said.

605
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,789
Sunday...

606
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:26,478
...at 10:00 a.m., she had brunch poolside.
Stayed there all day.

607
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:30,070
They got her signature and everything.
What do you think?

608
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,788
I don't know.

609
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,518
She was in Miami.

610
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,717
Maybe she got one of her lover-boys
to kill him.

611
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,552
Maybe. Maybe you're guessing.

612
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,595
No, I'm not.

613
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,949
Hell, everybody knows.
She's going to get a load of dough.

614
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,113
Don't it bother you
how come she's so nervous?

615
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,952
You think she's nervous?

616
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,678
Who do you think she is?

617
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,991
She's got a reputation all over town
for having her way with men.

618
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,674
- Is that so?
- I've heard stories here.

619
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,557
What kind of stories?

620
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,070
She used to entertain men
when her husband was away.

621
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,475
- Who told you that?
- Come on, Kyle.

622
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,278
What do you think is going on here?

623
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,477
There was nothing in the car,
not a fingerprint.

624
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,438
Rupert Munro was a big guy.

625
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,875
So wherever he went,
somebody carried him.

626
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,350
You know she got one of her lover-boys
to come over here and kill him.

627
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,273
- Where would they put the body?
- You tell me.

628
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,354
It was raining so hard that night.

629
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,277
No one is going to dig a hole
in the mud and rain.

630
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,473
- Hello, sugar.
- Hi.

631
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:43,110
- Thanks a lot. How's it going inside?
- We haven't found anything yet.

632
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,519
All right.

633
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,793
Here she comes.

634
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,116
I brought you some lemonade.
It's fresh. I made it this morning.

635
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,395
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

636
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,038
- Who was in your hotel room in Miami?
- <i>What?</i>

637
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,313
- Who called Munro from your room?
- <i>/ don't know what you're ta/king about.</i>

638
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,833
You know.

639
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,956
You put someone there.
You came to kill him.

640
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,029
<i>/ didn't.</i>

641
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,998
- Tell me the truth, goddamn it.
- <i>P/ease, / am.</i>

642
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,913
<i>Nobody was there.</i>

643
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,313
Somebody's lying.

644
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,791
This doesn't make any sense.

645
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,709
Kyle.

646
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,673
Just got a call.

647
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,236
Someone saw a car last week
parked out by Camelia Lake at night.

648
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,875
Shiny black car.

649
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,871
- Who made the call?
- Anonymous.

650
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,113
<i>Find anything?</i>

651
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,879
Can't see anything.

652
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,550
<i>We got nothing. We're coming in.</i>

653
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,517
Maybe we'll have to come back.

654
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,875
- Do you think it's here?
- I don't know.

655
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,319
I need a hand.

656
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,595
So that's it.

657
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:16,070
<i>Wait. / think we got something.</i>

658
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,990
<i>Oh, Jesus, / think we got him.</i>

659
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,632
I think it's him.

660
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,149
You got yourself a big old murder, Kyle.

661
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:11,719
From the patent decomposition of the body
and water temperature of 72 degrees...

662
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:16,317
...it is estimated the deceased has been
in the water for a period of seven days.

663
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,389
Last Saturday.

664
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:21,029
Body evidence is two gunshot wounds,
medium thoracic perforating...

665
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,830
...the lower third of the sternum.
Evidence of slight powder flaking.

666
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,193
No evidence of exit wound.
Second wound is above the right eye.

667
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,798
Patent evidence
of powder and gas scorching.

668
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,556
Exit wound lateral to second vertebra.

669
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,630
You're going to get a bullet.

670
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,355
A bit smashed up, but a bullet.

671
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,073
May I?

672
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,315
Let me see.

673
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,633
Looks like a.38.

674
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,360
Yeah, maybe nine millimetre.
Practically the same.

675
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,839
Let's measure it.

676
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,437
Lee, can I have the calliper?

677
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,233
Thanks.

678
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,274
.38.

679
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,713
Something wrong?

680
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,119
What's wrong?

681
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,790
Nothing. It's a.38.

682
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,915
- Here's a surprise for you.
- What?

683
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,195
- There's water in the lungs.
- So?

684
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,828
Two gunshots wounds in him,
and he was alive at the bottom the lake.

685
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,599
Cause of death: Asphyxiation by drowning.

686
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,674
Kyle.

687
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,596
Look what's stuck in the heel of his shoe.

688
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,318
- What is it?
- Glass.

689
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:34,068
I can't be sure yet, but this looks like
the original Victorian glass.

690
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,232
I think it's the same kind
you found on Munro's shoe.

691
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,629
- This is where it happened.
- Maybe.

692
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,029
Her lover-boy or someone came in.

693
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,873
There was a struggle.

694
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,520
The victim was hit in the head
and shot twice.

695
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,875
Thinking he killed him,
he took him to the lake...

696
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,712
...and dropped the car.

697
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,633
We have no fingerprints in the whole place.
He knew what he was doing.

698
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,791
He wiped the place clean.

699
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,435
I think he ran the damn humidifier
to melt down the prints.

700
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,032
We'll find a print somewhere.

701
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,714
We should. We know he was here.

702
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,590
Kyle, we found something.

703
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,516
My, my. Look what we got here.

704
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,793
Dig it out.

705
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,429
Well, Kyle, you were right.

706
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,836
Sooner or later, they all fuck up.

707
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,194
Look at that.

708
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,598
A perfect.38. Look at them riflings.

709
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,839
It will be easy to match this to a gun.

710
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,477
All we need now is the gun.

711
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,716
Who was with you in Miami?

712
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,233
I was alone.

713
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,954
You been sleeping with anyone
other than me?

714
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,029
No.

715
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,718
Why are you asking me this?

716
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,514
I have been hearing things about you.

717
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,391
Don't let them do this, Kyle.

718
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,679
You said that they would try to change
your mind, and now they're doing it.

719
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,155
Where's the gun?

720
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,629
- What gun?
- The gun you shot him with.

721
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,951
- You threw it away at the truck stop.
- That was a nine millimetre.

722
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,314
I know.

723
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,714
What are you saying?

724
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,110
The bullet they took out of your husband's
body was shot from a.38.

725
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,431
The bullet they took out of the wall today
was a.38.

726
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,796
But I shot him with a nine millimetre.
You saw it.

727
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,037
This is the bullet that was taken out
of the wall at Munro's house.

728
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,396
This is the bullet that was taken out
of Munro's body.

729
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,832
The riflings match perfectly.
They were both fired from the same gun.

730
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:12,153
What are the pits on the bullets
that came out of Munro?

731
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,673
I don't know.

732
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,709
Sand will pit a bullet like that, won't it?

733
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:21,669
The human body, as wonderful as it is,
contains one and half percent calcium...

734
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,118
...one percent potassium,
65 percent water, and after 5:00...

735
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:29,357
...somewhat all percentage of alcohol.
But no sand.

736
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,993
- Thank you very much for your help.
- Anytime.

737
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,315
Kyle.

738
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,357
The captain wants to talk to you.

739
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,318
- What about?
- Something about the Munro case.

740
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,309
Kyle, now were you seeing her?

741
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,989
No.

742
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,714
You never went to see her alone
in her house?

743
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,188
No, sir.

744
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,596
You all were called out there, weren't you?

745
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,035
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, a couple of times.

746
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:41,514
Her husband filed a complaint with us.
He said you used abusive language.

747
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,918
Did you say that?

748
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,952
He didn't say nothing, Captain.

749
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,513
The guy was a jerk.

750
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,433
This is a lie.

751
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,790
- What was this, domestic violence call?
- Yes, sir.

752
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,231
You took a special interest in this one,
didn't you?

753
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,993
No, not really.

754
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:09,475
Where were you a week ago
Saturday night, Kyle?

755
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,279
I was at home.

756
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:20,596
- Munro was shot with a.38, wasn't he?
- According to the autopsy report, yeah.

757
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:24,755
- You carry a.38 special, don't you, Kyle?
- You know I do.

758
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,233
May I see it?

759
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,635
- You fire this recently?
- Yes, I have.

760
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,598
We recovered a bullet
from that bedroom wall.

761
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,390
The rifling marks are clean.

762
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,678
It won't be too hard to tell
if it came from your gun.

763
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:57,151
I'm putting you on administrative leave
until such time as we know that.

764
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,595
'Morning.

765
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,074
Sorry, Kyle.
You're going to have to come with us.

766
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,310
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

767
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,988
You're the one who gave him
the wrong gun.

768
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,673
- What are you talking about?
- Wrong serial number.

769
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,833
You didn't give him your gun.
The captain wants to see you again.

770
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,231
I'll be right with you.

771
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,112
I got to tell you, Kyle.

772
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:22,671
A lot of people are upset and can't believe
you've done something like this.

773
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,593
- Did you see her socially at any time?
- No.

774
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:41,075
The night you met her, the bartender
showed you a credit card receipt...

775
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,479
...with her name on it.

776
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,075
- Did you call her or contact her in any way?
- No.

777
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,590
She wasn't calling you here at the office?

778
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,715
No.

779
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,428
Who was?

780
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,120
I don't know what calls
you're talking about.

781
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,239
What are you protecting her for, Kyle?

782
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:04,714
Where's this service revolver signed out
by you, serial number 0876B?

783
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,190
I told you. I don't know.

784
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,868
- Someone took yours, Kyle?
- Maybe.

785
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,671
- Who would that have been?
- I don't know.

786
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:19,877
- You never went to her house to see her?
- No.

787
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,672
Smarten up, Kyle.

788
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,639
You're going to fry for this
and she is going to walk.

789
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:29,030
That must've been what she had in mind
all along. Don't you think?

790
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:33,159
We find your gun or any evidence
that puts you there and you're gone.

791
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,874
Unless of course, you want to help us.

792
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:41,749
Kyle.

793
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,752
She's going to walk.

794
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,758
She'll be real rich.

795
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,189
She's going to get $12 million.

796
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,231
The state attorney will cut a deal with you.

797
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,114
You could be out in a couple of years.

798
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,789
Is that you?

799
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,678
- You got my money, Lamar?
- You got the ticket?

800
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,513
Let me see it.

801
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,468
You'll get the rest when I get mine.

802
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,596
How much did you pay Dickey
to follow your husband?

803
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,439
What is he to you?

804
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,232
Rachel, start talking.

805
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,398
Rupert was going to leave me
with nothing.

806
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,315
Lamar told me how to do it all.

807
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,913
How to do what?

808
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,757
Set up Rupert's death...

809
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,552
...where to meet you, the gun, Miami.

810
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,073
Everything.

811
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,551
- So we were just a lie?
- No.

812
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,879
It changed, Kyle.

813
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,837
It changed after I met you.

814
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,475
I came back from Miami to be with you.

815
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:35,077
You didn't even check out of the hotel.
You came back to kill him.

816
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,037
No. We were going away.

817
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,517
- Who made the phone calls from the room?
- Lamar put somebody there.

818
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,875
- Who made the phone calls?
- I don't know.

819
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,030
I just want to know the truth. Tell me!

820
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,235
I am.

821
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,193
Don't look at me like that, Kyle, please.

822
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,953
- I'm not a stranger to you.
- Yes, you are.

823
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,714
Don't say that.

824
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,915
- I love you.
- I don't want to hear it.

825
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,116
- My life was over till I met you.
- Stop it!

826
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,349
- I love you.
- Stop it!

827
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,475
I love you!

828
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,836
Then why didn't you tell me?
If you love me, why didn't you tell me?

829
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,037
- I would've lost you for good.
- I don't want to hear more lies.

830
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,109
No more lying.

831
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,668
You were just fucking me, weren't you?

832
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,798
I was loving you, and you were fucking me.

833
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,871
You should have told me
from the beginning.

834
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,791
Why didn't you just tell me?

835
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,112
I tried to get out of it.

836
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,592
Please believe me.

837
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,273
Call Lamar.

838
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:49,238
Tell him you want to see him
at JJ's tonight.

839
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,473
Hello, Dickey-boy.

840
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,389
Kyle.

841
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:38,111
- You're a big disappointment to me.
- There was nothing I could do for you.

842
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,159
Maybe not.

843
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:47,153
You know, you figured this one
like you knew it all along.

844
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:53,430
Yeah. I went to school on you, Kyle.

845
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:54,795
You sure did.

846
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,110
I listened to everything you told me.

847
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,558
I knew you did it.

848
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,394
You made too many mistakes, Lamar.

849
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,756
What are you talking about?

850
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,352
You took this, didn't you?

851
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,878
I don't see my name on it.

852
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,349
You see the compass on your dash?

853
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,995
How did you know
about the $12 million trust?

854
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,753
- Did she tell you?
- Why would she do that?

855
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,195
Maybe you were going to help her
kill her husband.

856
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,236
I didn't. You did.

857
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,837
Well, you're going to jail with me anyway
because of this.

858
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,239
You see...

859
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,592
...it's all pitted from sand...

860
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,112
...just like the bullet
they took out of Munro.

861
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,158
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You switched my gun, didn't you? My.38.

862
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,800
You shot it in the sand,
and then you got the bullet...

863
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,115
...in the autopsy room
when nobody was looking.

864
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:08,352
You switched it with the nine millimetre
slug they pulled out of Munro's chest.

865
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,158
No one is going to believe that.

866
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:16,279
You fired my.38 into the wall at Munro's
house, so the slug from the wall...

867
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:20,194
...and the slug from the body match.
And they're both from my gun.

868
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,793
You got a desperate imagination, my man.

869
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,950
How did you know where the body was?

870
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,752
Did she tell you?

871
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:37,115
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

872
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:42,636
All you got to do is get the mileage
from the car...

873
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,879
...and you know how far away the lake is.

874
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,548
- Get up, you son of a bitch.
- Don't fuck yourself up worse, Kyle.

875
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,918
Let's go.

876
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,713
Sit down.

877
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,717
I told him everything, Lamar.

878
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,033
Where's my gun?

879
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:21,758
I don't have it, Kyle.

880
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,437
Give me the goddamn gun.

881
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,314
It's in my car.

882
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:46,072
If you've cooked up something, Lamar,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

883
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:52,033
Let's go outside. Get up. Let's go.
Wait for me, Rachel.

884
01:28:58,760 --> 01:28:59,636
Move.

885
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,950
- Are you going to shoot me?
- Lf I have to.

886
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,792
Well, you won't have to.

887
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,395
- How much were you in for?
- A lot.

888
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,358
The lady was desperate.

889
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,592
Then she wanted to call it off,
but the money smelled too good.

890
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,036
Why me?
Why not some fucking bozo off the street?

891
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,953
- Why'd you set up your own partner?
- It had to be you.

892
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,031
You would've cracked the case
and busted me.

893
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,639
You got that right.

894
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,950
But you know what?
You were never the fall guy.

895
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:25,029
You were my insurance.

896
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,795
Fuck you, Dickey-boy. You screwed up.
First the pictures, then my.38.

897
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,553
You kept it too long. Open it up.

898
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:36,953
Come on.

899
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:40,715
Where is it?

900
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,756
Under the driver's seat.

901
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,515
- It's not too late, Kyle.
- Shut up.

902
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,953
Toss the gun in the lake.
You can forget it ever happened.

903
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,268
Shut up.

904
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:01,353
- Police! Stop right there!
- He's got a gun!

905
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,389
Kyle!

906
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:23,355
Kyle?

907
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,194
Stay with me.

908
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,833
Stay with me.

909
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,598
I was never...

910
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,918
...going to leave you.

911
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,629
No.

912
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:45,909
No!

913
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:16,994
Rachel.

914
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,108
Kyle was right.

915
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,553
Sooner or later, they all fuck up.
