1
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,149
Look at the view right here.

2
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:51,450
Are you seeing this?

3
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:52,651
Are you looking?

4
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:53,819
Are you looking at your phone,

5
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,055
or are you looking
at the outside?

6
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,498
Why don't you take
a look out the window,

7
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,566
I want you to take
an eye photo.

8
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,234
An eye photo? Okay.

9
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,536
You know how to do that, right,

10
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:11,537
you just use your eyes.

11
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,205
Blink?

12
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,740
They're right up there,
right in front of your face,

13
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:15,774
you can't miss them.

14
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,775
You're ridiculous.

15
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:25,784
My goodness, I love it up here.

16
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,286
Right?

17
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,555
You know you do.

18
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,366
My gosh, this was
a fantastic idea.

19
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,235
Whose idea was this
to come camping?

20
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,770
Lane, was that you?

21
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,172
Yours, it was yours,
you're the genius.

22
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,241
Was that me,
it's a good idea, probably me.

23
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,477
You are a nerd.

24
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,404
Are you seeing all this?

25
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,639
Do you need to trade spots
with your mom?

26
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,840
Well, she looks like

27
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,208
she's really enjoying
this view.

28
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,444
Maybe we better give her
a moment.

29
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:29,148
All right, Laney, what big party are
you missing out on this weekend?

30
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,349
I mean, it's not a big deal,

31
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,384
it's just
the battle of the bands.

32
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,067
Something that I've been waiting for
probably for the entire summer.

33
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,191
Trick question, sorry, honey.

34
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,626
Thought you would've seen
that coming.

35
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:41,827
When you're with the ones
you love,

36
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,362
you're never missing out
because you're...

37
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,930
exactly where
you're supposed to be

38
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:48,233
with the ones
you're supposed to be with?

39
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,835
How did you know
I was gonna say that?

40
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,170
Okay, dad, I get it.

41
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,204
What am I think now?

42
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,740
A cheeseburger, wrong.

43
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:58,510
Okay,
but are we supposed to listen

44
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,913
to smooth jazz the entire time?

45
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:02,848
Here, I'll turn it off.

46
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,883
Oh, it's only stuck,
I'm turning up.

47
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,518
Stop it.

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,655
I can't, I'm filling numb
with joy and jazz.

49
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:10,856
Yeah? Joy and jazz?

50
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,224
It's happening to you,
isn't it?

51
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,392
Even your mom is taken to it.

52
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:15,827
It's taking her
to a happy place.

53
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,613
My dad always was quite
the believer,

54
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,915
and he wasn't afraid
to let people know.

55
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,317
Don't get me wrong,

56
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,618
he wasn't in your face about it

57
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,986
like those crazies
with the homemade signs,

58
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,555
but some other people
could tell.

59
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,723
They sensed a strength in him

60
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,892
that they couldn't
put a finger on.

61
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,694
Friends that were struggling
or questioning

62
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,963
were just drawn to him.

63
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,864
He didn't take them
to church, though.

64
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,901
He'd take them camping.

65
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,669
He believed that there was
no crisis of faith

66
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,506
that couldn't be cured
by a week up in god's country.

67
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:04,409
He did his best to make me
a believer, too.

68
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,877
It's not like
I'm a militant atheist

69
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,746
or that I hate nature
or anything,

70
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,448
but spending
every first weekend

71
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,749
of every month in the woods

72
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,418
with my parents
wasn't exactly my idea

73
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,620
of living the teenage dream.

74
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:15,687
Honey,
I can't keep up with you,

75
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,688
you're going too fast.

76
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,856
Oh, sorry,

77
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,625
forget about the fun size legs.

78
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,960
How about a toddler pace?
Does that work for you?

79
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,763
Never heard you complain
about my legs before.

80
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,031
Mom.

81
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,899
Stop.

82
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,568
I have to be on a boat today,
I don't wanna be sick.

83
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,736
Sorry, honey,
we should save that

84
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,638
kind of talk for the love tent.

85
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,873
Dad, you guys are being
so gross right now.

86
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:39,878
Oh, so would you prefer
love shack?

87
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,383
Think she likes that.

88
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,951
- Whoop.
- Dad.

89
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,352
I need to finish that.

90
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,921
I'm sure it won't hurt
to keep...

91
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:53,058
Tyson in suspense.

92
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,894
You know the rules, Laney,
out here we unplug.

93
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,629
Recharge.

94
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,665
Whatever.

95
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,300
Can't believe you still wear
a Fanny pack.

96
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:02,534
It's actually
really embarrassing.

97
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,403
What are you talking about?

98
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:07,439
These are cool again, all the
hippers are wearing them.

99
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,676
They're called hipsters,
dad, and I promise

100
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:11,977
you are not one of them.

101
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,747
So, is Tyson a hipster?

102
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,717
I don't wanna talk about
this anymore.

103
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,652
Okay.

104
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,356
I'm not gonna always be here
to do this for you.

105
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:27,359
You'll do it on your own
one day.

106
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,794
Not today.

107
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,430
All right.

108
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,467
We are free.

109
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,702
We are free.

110
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:39,371
Free from the shackles
of society.

111
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,761
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

112
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,396
Okay, we're over it.

113
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:05,931
Whoa.

114
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,400
This is boat safety
rule number one, okay,

115
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,402
don't ever do this...

116
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,037
With a boat full of people,
all right?

117
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,129
He was right.

118
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,130
Nothing I could've been doing

119
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,498
was ever as important

120
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,767
as that time we spent together.

121
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,070
If only
I could've learned that lesson

122
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,838
a bit sooner.

123
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,786
We had seven months
from when they found the tumor

124
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,487
until we had to say goodbye.

125
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:03,822
The most beautiful

126
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,525
and yet most painful months
of my life.

127
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,627
Nothing can prepare you
for that.

128
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,195
There's no way to know
how or what

129
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,764
you're supposed to do or feel.

130
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,666
You're just lost.

131
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,935
But throughout all the pain
and the confusion,

132
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,136
he never wavered.

133
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,938
He never doubted his faith.

134
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,908
He left this world confident
that his cancer, his death,

135
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,710
was all a part
of a bigger plan.

136
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,146
I wish I could say the same.

137
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,917
I want to thank everyone

138
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,019
for coming
to our rehearsal dinner.

139
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,620
If you're still hungry,
grab seconds.

140
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,823
Harold's paying for it.

141
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:41,126
Tristan Samuelson
was your typical mormon guy.

142
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,662
Whatever that meant.

143
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:46,031
I'll never forget the moment

144
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,967
that this amazing woman
was catapulted into my life.

145
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,502
She met him in a support group

146
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,770
for people
who had lost a spouse

147
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,105
to cancer.

148
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,576
She was supposed to get help,
not get married.

149
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,678
So that I could see
this incredible person

150
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,246
right in front of me.

151
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:05,183
The woman I want to have
by my side from here on out.

152
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,985
Starting tomorrow
at 1:00 pm sharp.

153
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,188
That doesn't mean 1:15, Gary.
We will start without you.

154
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,723
So, with that,

155
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,692
let's raise
our champagne glasses,

156
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,060
or our sparkling water glasses

157
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,895
if you're with
the Samuelson clan.

158
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,731
All I could think about
was how my dad would feel

159
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,767
knowing how fast
she was just moving on.

160
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,686
You shouldn't be drinking that.

161
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,523
Champagne has up to
a 20% alcohol level.

162
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,824
Well, I'm not mormon, so...

163
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,058
Doesn't matter
what religion you are,

164
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,760
you're only 16.

165
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,562
Underage drinking
is a misdemeanor

166
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,597
punishable with fines
up to $1,000

167
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,865
and six months imprisonment.

168
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,034
And who says I'm not 21?

169
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,769
My uncle.

170
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,271
Who's your uncle?

171
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:03,808
The really smiley guy
who's about to marry your mom.

172
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,244
So, what did my uncle Tristan
tell you about me?

173
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:09,281
He actually didn't mention you.

174
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,917
But don't feel bad, I've only
known him for like two months.

175
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,218
Actually been seven months,

176
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,786
two weeks,
and just over four days,

177
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,155
but I appreciate the hyperbole.

178
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,992
You seem to know a lot
about me.

179
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,661
What's your story?

180
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,262
I'm Phoebe Valentine
and this is my dog, roxie.

181
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,597
I didn't know
you could bring a dog

182
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,798
to a rehearsal dinner.

183
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,133
Oh, Roxie's a service animal,

184
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,201
so she's allowed anywhere.

185
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,904
Aren't you, roxie? Yes you are.

186
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,674
She's so tiny, what kind of
service could she possibly do?

187
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,075
I have something
called anxiety,

188
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,777
have you heard of it?

189
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,278
Yeah, I have.

190
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,846
It's a very general term,

191
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,682
but I have lots
of different manifestations

192
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,183
of anxiety,

193
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,352
so it makes it easier
to keep under one umbrella.

194
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,588
You can just take her
wherever you want to?

195
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,855
Yup.

196
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:51,923
That's awesome.

197
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,224
Has its peaks and valleys.

198
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,327
I mean,
the entire seventh grade

199
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,729
thinks I'm crazy,
but I get to bring my dog

200
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,766
to social studies,
so what are you gonna do?

201
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,869
You know, I don't blame you
for hiding out in here.

202
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,237
These people give me
anxiety too.

203
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:09,007
Oh, no, I love
all these people actually.

204
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,376
I came in here in case
there's an earthquake.

205
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:12,844
You're kidding, right?

206
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,012
I wish I was,
but there's been a spike

207
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,213
in tectonic activity lately

208
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,381
and I doubt a building this old

209
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,983
has been retrofit
to seismic code.

210
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,284
If the big one hits,

211
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,685
this closet
is the safest place to be

212
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,053
in the entire building.

213
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,822
Everyone else will be crushed
like grapes.

214
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,323
Good to know.

215
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,726
Phoebe, can you come
and join us?

216
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,328
Oh, hi, I didn't know
you were in here.

217
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,732
Oh, hi, mom, this is Lane,
my new cousin, kinda.

218
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,333
Well, almost
my new kinda cousin

219
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,268
after tomorrow.

220
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,804
I'm Holly,
Tristan is my brother.

221
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,805
Hi.

222
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,273
Your mom is so amazing,

223
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,309
we've been dying
to get to know you, too.

224
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,910
Thank you.

225
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,079
Phoebe, can you come
and get some dessert

226
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,414
'cause we're gonna go
pretty soon.

227
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,249
I doubt I could enjoy dessert

228
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,684
knowing the ceiling
could cave in on us

229
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:53,918
at any moment.

230
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,420
Mmmm, it's Crème Brûlée.

231
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,255
I'll risk it.

232
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,229
Thanks for being
so sweet to her

233
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,764
and talking to her and...

234
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,165
she did all the talking.

235
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,933
Well I hope
you can get used to it

236
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,368
because there's gonna be
a lot of it

237
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,736
for the next three weeks.

238
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,772
What do you mean?

239
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,785
It's two o'clock
in the morning, Lane.

240
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,086
If you're gonna blow off
your curfew

241
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,889
you could at least tell me
where you were.

242
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,058
- I forgot.
- You forgot?

243
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,126
Kinda like how you
forgot to tell me

244
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,429
you were gonna ship me off with a
bunch of strangers for three weeks.

245
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,130
We meant to tell you
about it sooner,

246
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,699
but things just got crazy

247
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,900
and we just
finalized everything

248
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,102
with Holly today.

249
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,805
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,740
We thought it would be
a great opportunity

251
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,943
to get to know your new cuz.

252
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,112
She's not my cuz.

253
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,880
And I'm not spending
my whole summer

254
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,749
with these people
that I don't even know

255
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:01,986
while you two go cruise
the mediterranean for forever.

256
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,388
It's 21 days, Lane.

257
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,923
Twenty-three including travel.

258
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:08,293
Who cares?
It's still freakin' forever.

259
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:11,396
I mean, who goes on a cruise
for that long, anyway?

260
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,899
We got a killer group on
for it.

261
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,334
We know it's a long timeline.

262
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,802
That's why we thought
it would be safer

263
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,003
if someone was
watching out for you.

264
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,972
Mom, this is insane.

265
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,941
I'm 16 years old,
I don't need a babysitter.

266
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,044
Can I just stay here
and take care of myself?

267
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,345
Please?

268
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,047
Maybe she's right, babe.
Maybe we just...

269
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:32,117
sweetie, your mother and I
don't feel comfortable

270
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,352
with you being here
without supervision.

271
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,121
Well maybe I don't
"feel comfortable"

272
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:39,023
with you marrying my mom.

273
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,894
Look...

274
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,400
I know this is hard for you.

275
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,935
We're all just trying
to figure it out.

276
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,004
But I think with Patience,

277
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:56,207
and if we focus
on the good in each other,

278
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,776
over time, I think

279
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,778
we'll be able
to build something together,

280
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,979
something new.

281
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,281
Stop trying to fix everything.

282
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,883
Okay?

283
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:08,920
My dad is gone
and you will never fix that.

284
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,221
I think I should go.

285
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,023
Please stay.

286
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,992
I think it's best that I leave.

287
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,393
See you tomorrow?

288
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,532
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,143
Mom.

290
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,310
So, did I ruin everything?

291
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,145
I don't know.

292
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,347
He hasn't text me back yet.

293
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,188
He said he loves me

294
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,058
and he's sorry
for overstepping his bounds.

295
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,293
Are you sure he didn't say
he hates my bratty guts?

296
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:25,997
He's not allowed.
I birthed those bratty guts.

297
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,903
Are you gonna be okay
with this?

298
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,004
Yeah.

299
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,239
I mean, it's only three weeks

300
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:38,109
and I'm gonna have the car,
right?

301
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:42,080
Well, yeah,
but I mean with tomorrow.

302
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,115
The wedding entrusted in me.

303
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,422
Honestly, I don't know, mom.

304
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,491
It's been really hard.

305
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:57,161
I know it has, sweetie.

306
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:01,099
Do you think you could
just give it your very best?

307
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,034
I promise I'll try.

308
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,673
Can I sleep in here tonight?

309
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,008
Duh.

310
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,412
I said I would try.

311
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,347
What did that mean?

312
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,016
Try to replace the memories
of my father

313
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,318
with something new?

314
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,153
Try to not imagine every day

315
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:25,924
what life would be like
if he was still here?

316
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,227
But I knew I had to.

317
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:30,628
For her at least.

318
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,205
Here they come.

319
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,411
I didn't cry
like I thought I would

320
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,712
at the wedding.

321
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,280
Something gave me
the strength to deal

322
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,449
with all the fear I had
surrounding that day.

323
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,185
I could by my mom's smile
that she was truly happy

324
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,387
and it felt good.

325
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,022
I was actually feeling okay,

326
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,258
like somehow I could find
the strength to deal

327
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,527
with all this.

328
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,596
And then she left.

329
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,666
And I pretty much lost it.

330
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,140
Suddenly it was real.

331
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,576
In my head it finally clicked.

332
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,345
My mom was gone,

333
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,146
taken away
by a cheesy mormon dude

334
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,514
with perfect teeth,

335
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,617
and I was left at the mercy
of strangers.

336
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,328
I wanted to run away,

337
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,564
but my legs
wouldn't listen to me.

338
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:42,066
Everything was disconnected.

339
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,435
All I could do was sob
like a newborn.

340
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,306
And like a newborn,

341
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,509
I literally cried myself
to sleep.

342
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,144
But the last thought
that went through

343
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:56,781
my mind before I faded away
was one of hope.

344
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,150
The hope that somehow, someway,

345
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,651
this was all a horrible dream

346
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,521
and it would all go away
in the morning when I woke up.

347
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,432
I had no such luck.

348
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,235
Here it is.

349
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,137
There's a table of contents
in the front.

350
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,439
It's annotated
and there are footnotes.

351
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,341
I know you've only been
my counselor for a week,

352
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,243
but I feel like
I can trust you implicitly,

353
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,278
so don't pull any punches.

354
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,213
I have no ego attached to this,

355
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,516
so whatever you say,
I will not be offended.

356
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:32,717
Does anything jump out

357
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,218
that doesn't
quite work logistically

358
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,254
or otherwise?

359
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,756
What about doctrinally,
does everything seem sound?

360
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,392
I'm sure it all checks out.

361
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,728
It's really good, Carrie, it...

362
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,363
It's almost too good.

363
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,198
I know, right?

364
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,567
Oh, I'm so glad you think so.

365
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,402
This is gonna be
the most uplifting camp

366
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,703
these girls have ever been to

367
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,505
thanks to this dynamic duo
right here.

368
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,307
More like you
and sister Rockwell,

369
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,809
I'm just happy to help.

370
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,445
Did you guys work out
your little disagreement?

371
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,747
Oh yes, Nedra and I
had an amazing talk

372
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,382
and we really feel like
this plan

373
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,784
realizes all of her goals
as the camp director

374
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,353
as well as ours
as a young woman's presidency.

375
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,622
We really came together
on this year's trial of faith.

376
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,724
I think it's gonna be
our best one yet.

377
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,839
Good morning,
well, afternoon technically.

378
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,642
It's 12:34.
You slept just over 14 hours.

379
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,247
You're suffering from
mild-to-moderate dehydration.

380
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,716
You lost a lot of fluid
last night.

381
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,819
Here, I brought a backup.

382
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,388
Thanks, but can I
actually just get

383
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,691
some cereal right now,
I'm kinda starving.

384
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,459
Okay.

385
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,262
Hi, I'm Carrie Carrington,
I don't believe we've met.

386
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,498
Oh, this is

387
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,133
my brother's stepdaughter,
Lane.

388
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,434
She's staying with us
for a few weeks.

389
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,803
Oh, will you be
joining us for camp?

390
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,238
Oh, no,
she's staying here with Ben.

391
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,472
Oh, you don't wanna stay here

392
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,141
with boring old Ben,
come with us.

393
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,575
The mountains are so beautiful
this time of year,

394
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,244
the weather's perfect.

395
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,312
I mean, wouldn't you
rather come along?

396
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,614
Um, I...

397
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:13,417
think she'd rather
have some cereal.

398
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,685
Of course.

399
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:17,922
But if you change your mind,

400
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:21,359
the offer's still on the table.

401
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,162
You didn't tell me you had
a non-member staying with you.

402
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,763
How exciting.

403
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,733
Did I make her feel
welcome enough?

404
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,568
Sister Carrington's
really nice,

405
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,371
but she can be
a little intense.

406
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,739
Is she like a nun or something?

407
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,474
Oh, no, we call everyone

408
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,809
brother or sister
in our church.

409
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,412
I think that's why
some people think we're amish.

410
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:42,480
They do?

411
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,916
They think a lot of things.

412
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,784
We have got to get her to come,

413
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,352
I'll take care
of all the paperwork.

414
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,687
It'll be no big deal.
I can do it.

415
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,656
Carrie,
I'm not gonna push this.

416
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:52,757
She's been through
a lot lately,

417
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,926
and I don't wanna force her

418
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,761
into a high-pressure situation
like this.

419
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,763
More like highly uplifting
and highly entertaining.

420
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:01,899
Camp could be exactly what
she needs.

421
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,669
So, what's that camp thing
she was talking about?

422
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,971
Once every year,
all the girls from our church

423
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,974
get together and go camping
for a week.

424
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,443
They plan it
for like a year in advance.

425
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,779
This is the first year
I'm old enough to go.

426
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:15,947
You excited?

427
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:19,383
Okay, all right, I trust you.

428
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,385
But it'd be so great
for the trial of faith

429
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,954
this year
if we had even numbers.

430
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,355
Oh, and then we could do

431
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,856
the parable of the ten virgins.

432
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,892
Even if she does come,
we still wouldn't have enough.

433
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:28,926
What do you mean?

434
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,828
- I'm not going.
- Why not?

435
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,831
Let me see,
bears, cougars, coyotes,

436
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,267
forest fires,
moose, yeah, moose.

437
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:38,836
Poison Ivy,
poison oak, poisonous snakes,

438
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,339
wolves,
wolverines for starters.

439
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,440
She's your daughter,

440
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:43,741
you have to put your foot down.

441
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,009
It's not that simple.

442
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,377
Until she's 18,
it's very simple.

443
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,778
Mainly just because

444
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,881
I don't really fit in
with the other girls.

445
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,850
They don't talk to me
like you do.

446
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,318
How do I talk to you?

447
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,519
Just normal,

448
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,555
like you're
actually interested.

449
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,523
None of them really like me.

450
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,793
I'm the youngest one,
the only beehive.

451
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:03,928
Beehive?

452
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,363
Oh, we call all

453
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:08,399
the first-year campers
beehives.

454
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,734
Why do they call them beehives?

455
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:12,570
Why don't they just
call them bees?

456
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:15,506
I've been saying that
for years.

457
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,674
Can I talk to her?

458
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:17,975
Maybe if it comes
from her leader

459
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,344
and not her mom.
Yeah, but I don't think

460
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,847
it's gonna make any difference.
Okay, Phoebe, sweetheart.

461
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,318
Lane, could you please
excuse us for a second?

462
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,886
Yeah.

463
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,488
Thank you.

464
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,526
Phoebe, what's this
I hear about you

465
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,695
not coming to camp?

466
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,864
The girls need you,
you're the only beehive.

467
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,566
Your mom needs your help,
I need your sweet spirit.

468
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:46,637
We're gonna have so much fun,
you have to come.

469
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,072
Of course I would love
for you to come, sweetie,

470
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,875
but I want it to be
your choice.

471
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,743
But it won't be
the same without you.

472
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:53,878
Come on, just give it a shot.

473
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,446
Just for me?

474
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:02,720
What if I come
to the bee's nest with you?

475
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:06,590
I mean, what if I come
be a bee in the hive...

476
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,993
what if I come
to camp with you?

477
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,562
Will that change your mind?

478
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:13,898
I'm gonna start packing.

479
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,567
Looks like my work here
is done.

480
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:17,902
I will see you both
bright and early

481
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,437
Tuesday morning, okay?

482
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,939
You are gonna get along
with the girls so well.

483
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,708
Oh, and I can't wait for you
to meet my Bree.

484
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,509
Okay, toodle-loo.

485
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,480
You really
don't have to do this.

486
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,115
It's okay. I want to.

487
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:32,416
I mean, it might be good for me

488
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:33,951
to get up in the mountains.

489
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,353
Thank you.

490
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,587
I just hope I'm not messing up

491
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,022
like, the mormon vibe
or whatever.

492
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,024
No, not at all.

493
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:44,595
I'm not gonna be totally
weirded out by anything, am I?

494
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,555
This was it.

495
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,823
I was done for.

496
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,125
They were bringing me
to a compound

497
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:16,427
to be married off
and hidden forever.

498
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:17,428
I was sure of it.

499
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,796
The most diabolical part

500
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,133
was somehow they made it
my decision to go.

501
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:23,868
Bring it home.

502
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,972
How did they do it?

503
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:30,941
Carrie Carrington,
the mastermind, that's how.

504
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,743
You can't tell me
that's her real name.

505
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,044
Sounded like the leader
of the care bears

506
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:37,815
or the alter ego
of a Christian superhero.

507
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,184
Turned out her superpower
was endless amounts of energy

508
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,819
without a single cup of coffee.

509
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,687
What are
the young woman's values?

510
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,857
Faith, divine nature,
individual worth,

511
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,959
knowledge,
choice and accountability,

512
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:51,862
good work,
integrity, and virtue.

513
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,533
All right, girls,
I love the mountains.

514
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:57,134
Let's really belt it out
for the first years.

515
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:58,602
Okay.

516
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,004
Bree was the spawn of Carrie.

517
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:02,006
Equal in enthusiasm and energy.

518
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:04,575
She was the president
of the girls her age

519
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,210
and she wouldn't go
five minutes

520
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,745
without reminding me.

521
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:10,147
She was usually flanked
by her Bestie Paige,

522
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,049
one of those genetic
lottery winners.

523
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,452
The kind who would school you
in lacrosse on purpose,

524
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:17,855
and then steal your boyfriend
in ap chem on accident.

525
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,658
Then there's Charlotte.

526
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,026
We all know girls
who are boy crazy,

527
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:24,528
but when it comes to guys,

528
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,465
this one was criminally insane.

529
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,966
Okay!

530
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,935
Boring.

531
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:33,671
Let's do mormon boy.

532
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,077
If there's one thing mormons

533
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,546
love more than making up
ridiculous songs,

534
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:45,749
it's making up
ridiculous names.

535
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,651
Hence the Anderson sisters.

536
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,221
Mykelle, myleka, and Makenna.

537
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:51,856
It's like their parents
were playing scrabble

538
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:53,624
and had to use
the same seven letters

539
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,226
to make seven different names.

540
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:58,662
Yup, there were four other
m-initialed Anderson siblings

541
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,898
I hadn't met.
I know a mormon boy-

542
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,167
mindy was your typical
attention hog.

543
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,102
The girl's constantly
doing accents

544
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:08,839
and impressions,
and she wasn't bad either.

545
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,975
I guess when you live in
a community of conformity,

546
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:14,612
you have to find creative ways
to express yourself.

547
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:17,214
Good for her.

548
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,652
Hannah's parents
said she had to go

549
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,988
to camp or she couldn't
get her driver's license,

550
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,923
so she decided to bite
the bullet and bring

551
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:28,025
her brooding angst
along with her.

552
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,094
She claimed to only listen
to obscure bands

553
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,630
or rock legends,
but I definitely saw

554
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:34,298
some 1d on her playlist.

555
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,138
But I didn't blame her.

556
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,642
Even one direction is better
than those camp songs.

557
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,265
Wake up.

558
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,700
Last chance
to use the bathroom.

559
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:12,169
Next time
it'll be in the toolies.

560
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,638
Is this where we're meeting
Nedra and the bishop?

561
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,908
Yup, and you are on box duty.

562
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,145
Great.

563
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,847
Okay, ladies, we are entering
the unplugged portion

564
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:24,915
of the journey.

565
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,117
Kindly place all cell phones,

566
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,821
iPods, iPads,
androids, etcetera,

567
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,089
in the box.

568
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,858
I'm just gonna send
one last text.

569
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,094
Aw, Jared,
tell your jv football team

570
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,330
I'm gonna miss them so much,
send.

571
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:41,699
The beauty of mass text.

572
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,934
Is that everything, Hannah?

573
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,772
Any more?

574
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,810
That's it, I promise.

575
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,244
I guarantee the Internet
will still be here

576
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,013
when you get back.

577
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,152
You okay?

578
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,254
Hope our craziness
isn't too much for you.

579
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,856
I'm fine.

580
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,057
Good.

581
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,361
I kept saying I was fine.

582
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,196
I wasn't fine.

583
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:14,832
If the drive up here
was this bizarre,

584
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,800
how much stranger could it get?

585
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,683
Here comes leather and chains.

586
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,055
Sister Rockwell, bishop Rudd,

587
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,891
I didn't know you two
were coming up together.

588
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,394
Oh, actually,
I blew a radiator belt

589
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:45,396
up around Jacob's bend
and luckily

590
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:47,731
sister Rockwell saw me
with the hood up

591
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,400
and offered to give me a lift.

592
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:50,802
Would've beat you here,
but bishop

593
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:52,369
had to stop
and toss his cookies

594
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,204
at mile marker 18.

595
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:57,107
Guess he had trouble
with the curves.

596
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,877
Hey, I want you both to meet
my step-niece Lane.

597
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:01,011
She was nice enough to come up

598
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,346
with Phoebe for the week.

599
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,314
Lane, it's nice to meet you.

600
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,315
You, too.

601
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,984
Soldier.

602
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,319
Hi.

603
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,754
Glad to have you in the ranks.

604
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:13,223
That's a fine-looking
Fanny pack.

605
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,758
Mark of a real camper.

606
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,727
Too bad
you're not one of my yds,

607
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,096
probably know more than
most of these divas.

608
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,831
Be kind, sister Rockwell.

609
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,466
I am being kind.

610
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:24,101
They want to be divas,

611
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,769
that's all the rage these days.

612
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:28,405
Just like that bay-ons lady.

613
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,074
What are yds?

614
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:33,143
Youth camp leaders.
Bree and Paige this year.

615
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,912
Good luck.

616
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,947
Hello, my little divas.

617
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:40,751
- Hey, sister Rockwell.
- Hey, sister Rockwell.

618
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:42,319
Glad you could make it,
Phoebe-ster.

619
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:45,756
I was worried you were
gonna go awol on us.

620
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,791
You don't have
that little rat of a dog

621
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,393
with you, I hope.

622
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,028
That thing is cute,
but it sure hasn't earned

623
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,465
the rank of a real dog
if you ask me.

624
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:55,899
Well, lookie here,

625
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,167
if it isn't the famed bike gang

626
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,168
heck's angels.

627
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:01,805
Glad you made it in one piece.

628
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:03,006
Are you kidding?

629
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,509
This is the safest thing
on the road.

630
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:07,177
I wouldn't trade it
for any of those

631
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,946
four-wheel sardine cans.

632
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,147
Speaking of which,

633
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,215
you wouldn't happen
to have room

634
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,382
for one more

635
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:13,917
in this sardine can, would you?

636
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,520
No, sorry bishop,
no room at the inn.

637
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,255
We are having quite
the sing-a-long in here

638
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,390
and it is the party wagon,
so I am sure

639
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,892
that nobody wants
to give up a seat.

640
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,994
I'll do it. I'll trade you.

641
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,229
You sure?

642
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:26,997
I'm not sure
that sister Rockwell

643
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,800
feels comfortable riding
with a minor, sorry.

644
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:31,935
As long as she wears a helmet.

645
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,838
- Saddle up.
- Um...

646
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,273
It's okay.

647
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,841
Bishop,
why don't you ride up front

648
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:39,009
and I'll sit
in the back with Phoebe.

649
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,344
No complaints here.

650
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:43,046
All right,
next stop spring lake.

651
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,350
It's real nice of you
to help Phoebe,

652
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:47,885
but you don't have to do this.

653
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:49,453
Last chance.

654
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,255
Give the word
and I'll turn this hog

655
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,957
around and I'll take you
back to town.

656
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,960
I already came this far.

657
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,562
I might as well
just give it a shot.

658
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,297
Oorah.

659
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,865
Now, listen up,

660
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,066
you're very close
to the ground,

661
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,269
so you're gonna feel
the vibrations.

662
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:09,339
Don't be embarrassed if you
let out a few air biscuits.

663
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,975
It's natural, let it happen.

664
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,477
Now, hold on tight

665
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,913
and lean with the curves, baby.

666
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,481
Our dear heavenly father,
we are

667
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,418
so thankful to be here
at girl's camp.

668
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,086
We are thankful that we arrived

669
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:59,089
safely and we are
so thankful for

670
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:01,124
this beautiful campsite.

671
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,961
Please bless us
that we will be safe

672
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:06,964
and keep our hearts open.

673
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:08,632
Bless us to have
a spiritual experience

674
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:12,069
and to grow closer
as young women.

675
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:17,341
And let us be able to enjoy
the beauty that surrounds us.

676
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:18,942
We are so thankful
for our leaders

677
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:22,045
and their time
and dedication and preparation

678
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,947
that they have put
into making this

679
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,383
such a special experience
for us.

680
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,618
And we ask these things

681
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,053
in the name
of Jesus Christ, amen.

682
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,237
All right,
you beautiful pipsqueaks,

683
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,472
listen up.

684
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:50,307
If you were expecting
this year to be

685
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:54,411
a relaxing week of Kumbaya,
you can forget it.

686
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,446
Sister sergeant major
Nedra Rockwell

687
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,448
doesn't believe in easy.

688
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,019
This is girl's camp,
not club med.

689
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,187
Now, don't worry,
there'll be plenty of time

690
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:07,925
for the touchy feely stuff,
and that's important.

691
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,426
Sister Carrington
has prepared quite

692
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,695
the spiritual journey
for y'all,

693
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:15,165
but as far as the wilderness
survival portion goes,

694
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,367
you're in my world.

695
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:20,137
Now,
we've prepared three tents,

696
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:22,105
one for the beehives,

697
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,441
the Maya maids,
and the laurels.

698
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,043
You're to assemble
your tents in

699
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:29,613
your respective ranks
and return and report.

700
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,648
You can solicit help
from the other groups

701
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,419
if needed,
but no adults, capiche?

702
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:36,586
Capiche.

703
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,988
Now, before I turn you loose,

704
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,356
I'm going to turn the time over

705
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:43,160
to sister Carrington
for some foofy stuff.

706
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,428
Thank you, sister Rockwell.

707
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,996
Thank you, sister Rockwell.

708
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:49,366
I have something special
for you,

709
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:55,439
but if you want it, you're going
to have to really dig deep.

710
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,509
Well, go on.

711
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,713
Okay.

712
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:04,514
Come on, girls.

713
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,556
How far down did you put it?

714
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,758
Only one way to find out.

715
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,293
Okay, come on.

716
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,668
What do you think it is?

717
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,536
I hope it's lunch,
I'm starving.

718
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,472
How can you be starving,
we literally just ate.

719
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,207
I don't know, maybe I
have a higher metabolism.

720
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:31,508
What's that supposed to mean?

721
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,544
Ladies, please,
we're almost there.

722
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,680
Maybe it's a dead,
decaying body.

723
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:40,150
Like of some old prospector
named Wally Pickleshoes

724
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:43,020
who died while searching
for the motherload.

725
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:45,188
It's not a dead body.

726
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,591
Just a little bit deeper.

727
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,396
Dig it, dig it up, dig it up.

728
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:54,798
Okay.

729
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,733
What could it be?

730
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,069
Open it, open it.

731
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:05,175
There's one for each of you.

732
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,677
These are your golden rules
for camp this year.

733
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,678
Each day's theme and schedule

734
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,580
is outlined is great detail.

735
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,783
I've also included the entire
camp manual as well as all

736
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:14,584
of your
certification requirements.

737
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:16,386
Everything you need
to complete this journey.

738
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,687
Well, what are all these pages

739
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,122
stuck together in the back?

740
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:21,058
Thank you for asking,
Charlotte.

741
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,325
The sealed portion
of the tablets

742
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:24,628
is for your own
personal journaling.

743
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,129
Simply remove
the thick rubber bands

744
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:27,631
at each end and it will reveal

745
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:30,667
blank pages that you can use
to record your thoughts

746
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:34,204
and feelings and experiences
while here at camp.

747
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,139
Okay, bishop,
is there anything that

748
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:37,774
you'd like to add
before we kick

749
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,077
this camp into full gear?

750
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,246
Sure.

751
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,148
Girls,
these sisters have dedicated

752
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,084
countless hours
to making sure that

753
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,418
you have a good time up here
and that

754
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,754
you really feel the spirit.

755
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,789
You're in good hands.

756
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:55,292
I'm gonna make myself
pretty scarce around here.

757
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:57,327
I got my pup tent,
I got the hunger games

758
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,296
on audiobook,
so I can finally find out

759
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:00,597
what all the buzz is about.

760
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,265
So, I'll be around
if you need me,

761
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,867
but this week
is really about you,

762
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:07,170
so have a good time.

763
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:08,772
Thank you, bishop.

764
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,508
Ew.

765
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,809
How old are these teepees?

766
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,177
Sister Rockwell said
she used them

767
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,645
at her girl's camp.

768
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:18,315
More like Custer's last stand.

769
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:19,382
Why couldn't we stay somewhere

770
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,518
with cabins like last year?

771
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,787
The instructions are so old
you can't even read them.

772
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,222
Who cares about
the instructions,

773
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:27,390
okay, we'll figure it out.

774
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:30,227
Besides, if we hurry, we can get in
some lake time before dinner, so...

775
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,329
Okay, let's do this.

776
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,202
Yeah, that.

777
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,749
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

778
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,484
They've never done this before.

779
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,386
They'll never learn
if we baby them.

780
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:57,721
Yeah, but...

781
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,356
Carrie, we agreed
to do this Nedra's way,

782
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,291
let's just see how they do.

783
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,463
Yeah. And just grab, like...

784
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:11,268
We have to be precise
in what to.

785
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,837
I think this goes
to the bottom of that.

786
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,539
Well that doesn't
seem like that to me.

787
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,274
It looks like a top piece.

788
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,315
Hmm. Home sweet home.

789
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:26,683
Is anyone else disturbed

790
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,386
by the plethora
of leftover poles and fabric?

791
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,388
I'm sure it's just extra.

792
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:31,555
Yeah, like we could build

793
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,557
a whole extra teepee with them.

794
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,293
Do you guys need any help?

795
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:38,628
Oh, no, I think we're fine.

796
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,630
Do you need help
with the rain cap, though?

797
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,332
I can help you guys,
it's kinda tricky.

798
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,434
Oh, no, it's okay,
it, like, never rains up here,

799
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:45,702
so we should be fine.

800
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,470
It's probably better if...

801
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:48,905
you know what,
we'll be by the lake.

802
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:51,675
Come meet us
when you're ready, bye.

803
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:52,876
Ooh, I call first canoe.

804
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,678
I call second with Bree.

805
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,346
Wait, Paige and Bree,
wait for me.

806
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:57,681
First canoe sounds fun.

807
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,816
Whoop-de-freakin'-do.

808
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,384
You can go with them
if you want to,

809
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,286
I can probably
just handle this by myself.

810
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:04,721
Are you kidding,
I wanna see what

811
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,290
this actually is supposed
to look like.

812
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,559
Okay, help me
with the canvas then.

813
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,627
Cool.

814
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:13,697
Hannah, myleka.

815
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:14,931
Girls, no. No, stop.

816
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,248
Life's about taking risks,
girls.

817
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,415
You're only living once.

818
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,255
Sit down in the canoe.

819
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,690
You sit down in the canoe.

820
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,459
What are you doing?

821
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:44,661
Oh, I like to put the tarp
on the inside of the tent.

822
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:45,795
It's a little trick
my dad taught me,

823
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:46,997
it'll keep us dry.

824
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:48,498
The other girls didn't do it.

825
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,499
I know.

826
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:51,701
Why don't you go grab the bags,

827
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:52,769
I'm gonna finish this up.

828
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,404
Oh, sure.

829
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,721
Don't tell anyone.
I snuck her on the ark.

830
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,790
Dogs aren't allowed here,
what are you doing?

831
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,659
Roxie's a service animal,
she's allowed anywhere.

832
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,994
No, it could be
really dangerous for her,

833
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,362
there's a lot of wild animals
out here,

834
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:20,964
what if she gets out?

835
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,932
I'm so sorry, I didn't know.
Don't tell anyone, please?

836
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:26,002
It's okay,
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

837
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:27,637
She's here now,
we're gonna just

838
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,072
have to deal with it.

839
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,807
Keep her in the tent
as much as we can,

840
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,610
only let her out
when we have to, okay?

841
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:34,878
If she barks, it's over.

842
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,579
She does not bark, like, ever.

843
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,014
Let's hope so.

844
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,916
Camp invitational.

845
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:42,752
Okay, put her in the carrier.

846
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,521
This will be
our little secret, okay?

847
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:45,855
Okay.

848
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,824
You don't ever
even complete all the things

849
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:48,992
that you need to complete,

850
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,527
so you don't even
get the charms.

851
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:52,028
That doesn't matter.

852
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,532
It Doe... it matters
if you wanna look like this.

853
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:59,102
Repent, yee, repent, yee.

854
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:01,538
The flood is coming.

855
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,774
God is watching you.

856
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,609
Repent.

857
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,847
And behold,
the people were filled

858
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,683
with wickedness
and mocked his teachings.

859
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,786
And the lord saw
that the people

860
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:18,388
would not listen to Noah,

861
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,658
so he told Noah
that they must be destroyed.

862
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,462
But the lord found favor
with Noah

863
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:28,865
and told him to build an ark.

864
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,500
And in order
to preserve the beauty

865
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:31,968
and nature of the earth,

866
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,070
the lord commanded Noah
to bring in animals

867
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:36,840
of every kind into the boat.

868
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:41,811
And every kind onto the boat,

869
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:45,515
and they all came together
in the ark as one family.

870
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,453
Now remember this
as you face this

871
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:51,821
year's trial of faith.

872
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:53,790
Which we are totally gonna pass

873
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:57,594
with perfection this year,
right girls?

874
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,562
It's like the main activity
of camp.

875
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,765
I've never done one,
but imagine

876
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,768
a Sunday school lesson taught
by Indiana Jones.

877
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,669
Each of you
are as unique and beautiful

878
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:08,471
as the many animals on the ark,

879
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:09,906
so we've put you into twos

880
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,841
and you're going to choose
a spirit animal

881
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:14,043
and then discuss why
you chose that animal.

882
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:15,979
We've provided
some craft materials for you,

883
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:18,848
just some basic paints
and construction paper,

884
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,117
nothing special,
so let's get to work.

885
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,485
Can't we both win?

886
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:23,987
Just pick, fang or horns?

887
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,989
Fangs.

888
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:27,824
Something that's,
like, admired.

889
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:30,560
Yeah, like,
the most important animal.

890
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:32,829
And, like,
maybe, like, cute hair.

891
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:34,964
No, leave it,.

892
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,933
Everyone's being so boring.

893
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,868
We've gotta come up
with something more original.

894
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,837
Yeah,
animals were so last year.

895
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:42,605
- Mindy.
- Sorry.

896
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,742
- Be careful.
- It's washable.

897
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,911
- Don't move.
- It's cold.

898
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:49,446
You don't wanna look like
a raccoon.

899
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:50,780
Fine.

900
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,482
We should do something
endangered like

901
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:56,619
narwhals, beluga whales,
condors, what do you think?

902
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,854
It's up to you, I don't...

903
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:01,825
- rawr.
- Rawr.

904
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:03,526
All right, so we chose lions

905
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,762
because they're super fast,
they're really strong,

906
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:07,063
and they just protect
everybody else.

907
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,499
Not like
we're rulers over you, well,

908
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,034
oh, I mean, we kinda are,

909
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:13,069
but not in like
a dictator-type way,

910
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:16,206
just more of a natural leader and
protector-type way, you know?

911
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:17,507
Yeah, for sure.

912
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:19,142
So, I wanted to be lone wolf

913
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,677
because they do
whatever they want

914
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,545
and they're not afraid
of anything,

915
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:24,247
but mykelle
just loves bunny rabbits

916
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:27,484
or whatever, so we chose...

917
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:29,686
Jackrabbits!

918
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:33,490
Because they love to run free

919
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,825
and they're also funny
and clever

920
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,961
and they have big families.

921
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:42,031
Just like me.
Hannah made this have fangs.

922
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,771
We are the rock giants.

923
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,975
You know, from the gnome movie
which, like, nobody saw?

924
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:54,644
Well, anyway, we thought
they were totally sweet

925
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,913
and we, like, really wish that
they had survived the flood.

926
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:58,248
And even though my parents say

927
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,149
the movie is sacrilegious,
I don't care

928
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,685
because Shem,
and Ham, and Japheth

929
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,988
were so hot in it,
like, I was tots

930
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,857
jealous of Hermione.

931
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,630
We chose dogs
because they're loving,

932
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:14,731
loyal,
and they can sense danger

933
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:16,032
and warn others.

934
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,800
But also because
they're super cute,

935
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,569
but our dad won't let us
have one.

936
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,807
We chose an endangered species,

937
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,876
galapagos giant tortoises.

938
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,645
We chose them
because they're wise,

939
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:29,913
they live to a very old age,

940
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:31,848
and even though
it may take them awhile,

941
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,583
they always get
where they wanna go.

942
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:34,985
And no matter how far
they travel,

943
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:37,020
they're never far from home.

944
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,023
All right,
what do you say we sing

945
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:42,125
one more song
before we hit the hay, okay?

946
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:10,820
Good night ladies, let us know

947
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:13,089
if you need anything.

948
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,159
All right,
we start at like, 7:00 A.M.

949
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:17,594
Mykelle, mykelle,

950
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,596
I mean,
just a little bit longer.

951
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,764
So, would you rather
marry a man

952
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,833
that you know was
a serial killer,

953
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,969
kills every day, but he's
still, like, a good guy,

954
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:27,337
like you love him,

955
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:29,772
or would you rather marry a man

956
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:33,176
that all he ever says
is mahna mahna?

957
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:34,844
You ever heard about
mantis shrimp?

958
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:36,312
Nope.

959
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:39,983
So, they're like
these shrimp that

960
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:41,884
live way, way down
at the bottom of the ocean

961
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:43,753
like, thousands of feet under...

962
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:44,482
mm-hmm.

963
00:43:44,508 --> 00:43:47,390
...And they can get up
to like, a foot long.

964
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:49,192
The glacier's so cool
because it was

965
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:50,827
like this big block of ice
and it's with

966
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,261
the mountain
and you have to hike

967
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,097
up pretty far up,
but once you get up there...

968
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:55,999
how far?

969
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:57,100
I think it's like five miles.

970
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:58,635
Okay, but, like,

971
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:00,036
if I asked him what
he wanted for breakfast

972
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:02,972
in the morning,
would he say mahna mahna?

973
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,173
Yeah.

974
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,217
Trust me on this.

975
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,156
Hannah, do you want mykelle to brush
your hair, you have a little...

976
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,058
no, I don't brush my hair.

977
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,693
Oh.

978
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:24,927
- Do you wanna put roxie away?
- Okay.

979
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:26,429
I'll get the light.

980
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,034
All right, girls.

981
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:33,036
Good night, love you all.

982
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:35,104
He always says mahna mahna.

983
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,273
Like mahna mahna?

984
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:40,843
Mahna... you gotta choose.

985
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:41,978
Okay, I choose
the serial killer.

986
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,346
Good choice.

987
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,887
If Aspen gets hurt,
like, it shoots out

988
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:54,223
12 different aspens
from its roots.

989
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:56,192
And they just keep growing
and if they get hurt,

990
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:59,962
they shoot out, like,
ten or 12 more

991
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:01,898
and so they're, like,
the largest living organisms

992
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,766
on the earth
and the largest one

993
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:07,170
is 106 acres down in Utah.
Mmhmm.

994
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:11,274
And it's the biggest thing,
like, living thing on earth.

995
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:13,476
Ever?

996
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,778
Yeah.

997
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,047
- Hmm.
- Oh, oh. Did you know that if you chop off

998
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,116
the top of a pineapple,
like, the leaf part,

999
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:22,118
and you plant it, then it grows

1000
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,454
another pineapple on top of it.

1001
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:26,422
Mmmm.

1002
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:28,091
Yeah.

1003
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,106
Is that rain?

1004
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:46,109
"It, like,
never rains up here."

1005
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,110
Remember?

1006
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:53,883
It'll probably just blow over.

1007
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:01,858
We did the tarp trick,
we should be fine.

1008
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,861
You think the others are okay?

1009
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:07,296
Is the teepee leaking?

1010
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:10,066
Probably because
we didn't put the rain cap on.

1011
00:46:10,068 --> 00:46:12,335
Look how much rain comes in
when I push in the sides!

1012
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:14,170
Stop pushing
the sides, mykelle.

1013
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:16,239
We are gonna die!

1014
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:18,107
We're gonna be
struck by lightning

1015
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,443
and we are gonna die!

1016
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:23,246
Forget about lightning,
we're gonna drown!

1017
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:25,181
This is the end!

1018
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:28,084
Come on, it can't be that bad.

1019
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:30,019
Sister Rockwell!

1020
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,195
Katniss drew back her bow,

1021
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:41,531
swiftly and mercilessly,
sending an arrow

1022
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:43,166
deep into the heart...

1023
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,816
please!

1024
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,586
No, no, no.
They're gonna see roxie.

1025
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:05,888
We have to let them in.

1026
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:18,267
Oh, my gosh,
thank you guys so much.

1027
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,436
You saved our lives.

1028
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,908
You think the laurels are okay?

1029
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,524
Guys.

1030
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,430
In here!

1031
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,480
Mykelle!

1032
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:39,916
Close it, close it!

1033
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,484
Oh, my gosh.

1034
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:47,390
Guys, can you keep a secret?

1035
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,260
Ow.

1036
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,428
I've always heard the saying

1037
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,964
no good deed goes unpunished.

1038
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:01,070
This was the first time I really
understood what it meant.

1039
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:09,111
I only logged a total
of about 45 minutes of sleep

1040
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,379
that night.

1041
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:13,149
Stop moving.

1042
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:15,318
But at least we were dry.

1043
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,659
Thanks for the tip, dad.

1044
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:27,964
Thanks a lot.

1045
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,983
Well, lookie here.

1046
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:50,720
A little nest of estrogen.
What happened to my teepees?

1047
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:52,655
Sister Rockwell,
we tried to wake you.

1048
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:55,224
The storm was crazy.

1049
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:58,094
It just collapsed
both of our teepees.

1050
00:49:58,096 --> 00:50:00,162
That's odd, this teepee seemed

1051
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:05,134
to endure the very same storm and
it's still standing like the alamo.

1052
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:07,737
Well, maybe we missed
a few steps in the setup.

1053
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:10,072
Lane and Phoebe
seemed to figure it out.

1054
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:12,708
Even used the Campbell
interlining technique.

1055
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,577
What's wrong?

1056
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:17,079
Too proud to take a hint
from the first years?

1057
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:19,348
All right, sister Rockwell,
let's just calm down, okay,

1058
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,783
'cause I'm sure
that the girls didn't mean...

1059
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:22,118
calm down?

1060
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,652
You're not the one whose gear

1061
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:27,056
is spread all over
god's fine creation.

1062
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,762
Okie dokie.

1063
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:35,264
I need to give myself
a little bit of time-out.

1064
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:36,265
Is everything okay?

1065
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,267
Tiptop.

1066
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,770
Just need to cool the engine.

1067
00:50:40,772 --> 00:50:44,607
I have a system and it works.

1068
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:47,143
Girls, why don't
we go get some breakfast

1069
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:50,546
and we'll give
sister Rockwell some space.

1070
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,049
Sorry for losing my cool.

1071
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:56,052
After all, it's just equipment.

1072
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:58,220
Just heirloom teepees

1073
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,756
from my first year
at girl's camp.

1074
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,058
Well, do you want us
to help you?

1075
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,393
No need.

1076
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,162
You girls have a big hike
ahead of you,

1077
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:08,564
you better fuel up.

1078
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,766
You sure
you don't want any help?

1079
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:13,536
I'm fine. It's my fault.

1080
00:51:13,538 --> 00:51:17,073
I should have helped them
in the first place.

1081
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:18,808
But you'll have to go
on the hike without me.

1082
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,543
This will take
the better part of the day

1083
00:51:20,545 --> 00:51:22,445
to dry everything out.

1084
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:24,847
Our yds have it covered.

1085
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:27,283
I hope that works out for you.

1086
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,097
Six miles?

1087
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,401
My certification says
I only need to do five.

1088
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:47,636
Well, then I guess
you gotta go that extra mile.

1089
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:49,205
Lucky us.

1090
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:50,773
Hey, don't blame me,
it was your ycl's idea.

1091
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,842
They seemed to think
you were up for the challenge.

1092
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:54,276
That's before we had
to pack ten girls

1093
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:55,878
into one tent during a monsoon.

1094
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,514
Yeah, while our leaders
ignored our cries for help.

1095
00:51:58,516 --> 00:52:00,649
We agreed to forgive
each other, all right?

1096
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:03,352
We were all partly responsible
for what happened last night.

1097
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:04,620
- Except for me and Lane.
- Phoebe.

1098
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,155
It's true,
we're the only ones that

1099
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:07,389
took the time to do
our tents correctly.

1100
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:09,658
That's enough, Phoebe.

1101
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,328
I don't want to ruin it,

1102
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,697
but I do have
a special surprise

1103
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:16,332
for you at the top of the hike.

1104
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:18,167
If it's the feeling
of satisfaction

1105
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:22,338
and accomplishment,
I'm not interested.

1106
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,740
You'll have to see.

1107
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:40,156
Outta here, you horse fly.

1108
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:41,590
Find a horse, why don't you?

1109
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:44,527
I think he already has.

1110
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:45,828
You little brat.

1111
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,530
What is the deal, ladies?

1112
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:52,201
All right guys,
come on, circle up.

1113
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:54,170
We have been here
less than 24 hours

1114
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:56,238
and you're already
at each other's throats.

1115
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,474
Have you forgotten
why we're here?

1116
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:00,509
I think we need
an appreciation break.

1117
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,612
That's right, spread out,
30 minutes solo time.

1118
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:05,748
You can relax,
journal, whatever,

1119
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,483
but I just want you
to enjoy yourselves

1120
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:11,187
and appreciate
the beauty surrounding you.

1121
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,546
Is this our special reward?

1122
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,281
Oh, ladies, hi,
hope you're enjoying

1123
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:40,983
your hike this fine morning.

1124
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,654
Looks like you survived
the storm.

1125
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,825
Yeah, we got a big soggy,
but we're fine.

1126
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:50,993
Good to know.

1127
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:52,695
You know, we have a station

1128
00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:54,797
just two miles up this path
if you need anything.

1129
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:56,498
I do need to warn you,
there have been

1130
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,402
some reports of bears around,
so just be careful.

1131
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,305
- Of course.
- And if you do come across a black bear,

1132
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:05,507
do not play dead
'cause it will eat you.

1133
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:06,508
That's crazy.

1134
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,710
Wait, what do you do?

1135
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:08,744
With a black bear you actually

1136
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,379
stand your ground,

1137
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:12,448
make yourself look bigger
and make loud noise.

1138
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,449
What about grizzlies?

1139
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:14,683
With grizzlies

1140
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,452
you actually
do wanna play dead.

1141
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:18,020
You're gonna wanna cuddle up
in fetal position,

1142
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:20,489
hold your neck like this.

1143
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,691
It does take guts, but it's
the best chance you got.

1144
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:24,293
As long as you keep
your food tied up

1145
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:26,662
or in a vehicle, you should be fine.
Yeah.

1146
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:37,273
Well we will be
heading on our way

1147
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:40,342
and leave you ladies on yours.

1148
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:41,844
Yes, on our way.

1149
00:54:41,846 --> 00:54:42,845
Bye.

1150
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:45,014
- Bye.
- - Bye.

1151
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:48,050
See ya.

1152
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:49,852
- You guys are ridiculous.
- Phoebe.

1153
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:51,620
Especially you, mom.

1154
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,389
I'm telling dad you have
a crush on the park ranger.

1155
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:54,757
I was being polite.

1156
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:56,659
Let's go already.

1157
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:59,428
They were like Greek gods.

1158
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:02,031
Can I journal about them
for 30 minutes?

1159
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,533
Was I really flirting?

1160
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:06,302
No, please,
you were only being polite.

1161
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:07,736
Right.

1162
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,574
I've been to spring lake
at least a dozen times,

1163
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:17,579
but I have never seen a hot
forest ranger, let alone two.

1164
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:19,381
They usually have
disgusting mustaches

1165
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:22,651
and are really nerdy,
but these guys?

1166
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,320
Wow.

1167
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:25,921
Maybe all the praying
and spiritual devotionals

1168
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:28,390
were paying off.

1169
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:30,893
They sure give us
a little pep in our step.

1170
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:34,330
We could've hiked twice as far
as we planned to that day.

1171
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,834
Come to think of it,
I think we did.

1172
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:45,007
Okay, that's really weird.

1173
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:47,643
Does this log
look familiar to anyone?

1174
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:48,644
Don't be silly, it's a log.

1175
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:50,579
They all look the same.

1176
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:51,680
You know,
I'm sure it's just right

1177
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:52,848
up around this bend.

1178
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,617
Yeah, let's keep going,
come on.

1179
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:57,886
All right, come on,
let's do it.

1180
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:04,560
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay, come on.

1181
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:20,409
Okay.

1182
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,648
All right, that's definitely
the same tree.

1183
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,417
Oh, my gosh, I told you

1184
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:29,685
we've just been going
around in circles.

1185
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:31,687
No, that's impossible, Hannah,

1186
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:34,990
okay, I mean, it's, the glacier
should be right there.

1187
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:36,959
Maybe it melted.

1188
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:38,694
We could always go back
and ask the rangers.

1189
00:56:38,696 --> 00:56:40,829
I give up, okay,
this map is so stupid.

1190
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:43,966
We've been hiking for hours, we haven't
gotten anywhere, I'm going back.

1191
00:56:43,968 --> 00:56:46,034
Oh, no you're not,
I have a special surprise

1192
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:47,669
for everybody when we reach
the top, remember?

1193
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:49,471
We don't care about
the surprise, mom.

1194
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:51,073
Well, then you better
start caring, all right,

1195
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,708
'cause I didn't lug
this all the way

1196
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,610
up the mountain for nothing,
so you turn

1197
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:56,178
your spoiled little butt around

1198
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,480
and start looking
for the glacier.

1199
00:56:58,482 --> 00:56:59,748
What's wrong, Makenna?

1200
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,917
We don't say
b-u-t-t in our family.

1201
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,585
Well, we do in mine.

1202
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,988
Okay, let's just take a look
at the map again.

1203
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,756
Be my guest.

1204
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,000
Look, I think you
just had the map

1205
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:20,969
oriented wrong
'cause that way's north

1206
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:22,838
and so the glacier
must be that way.

1207
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,773
Okay, well then
where's the trail?

1208
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,041
It can be really tricky
to find,

1209
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,876
but I'm sure
if we go that direction

1210
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,512
we'll find a trail marker.

1211
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:32,047
Come on.

1212
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,988
See? Trail marker.

1213
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:43,826
Huzzah. Great work, Lane.

1214
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:46,929
Your last name
isn't grylls per chance?

1215
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:49,598
She's our secret weapon.

1216
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:30,906
Don't just rush off,
I have a surprise, remember?

1217
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:39,815
I'm not stupid, you know.

1218
00:58:39,817 --> 00:58:41,950
I never said you were.

1219
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:43,285
I get it, you're new,

1220
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:44,820
you know, you wanna try
and impress people,

1221
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:46,622
but you don't have
to make other people

1222
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:48,790
look dumb in the process.

1223
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:51,894
I'm not trying
to impress anyone.

1224
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:53,662
It kinda seems like you are.

1225
00:58:53,664 --> 00:58:55,998
I mean, just be yourself,
you know?

1226
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,767
People like you better
that way.

1227
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,302
I'm just saying.

1228
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,806
For the record, if you've heard

1229
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:07,209
that mormon girls
are perfect little angels

1230
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,646
that are never catty
or manipulative,

1231
00:59:10,648 --> 00:59:12,247
you're dead wrong.

1232
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:14,182
I'm just saying.

1233
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,622
How dare she claim
I was making her look stupid.

1234
00:59:20,624 --> 00:59:21,890
She was doing
a fine job of that

1235
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,191
on her own.

1236
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:24,927
I shouldn't have let it
get to me so bad,

1237
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:30,065
but hey,
I'm no perfect angel myself.

1238
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,806
I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to hit you

1239
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:39,341
in the face,
I was just messing around.

1240
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:40,809
I'm sure it was
just an accident.

1241
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:42,177
Of course it was an accident,

1242
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:43,845
that's what happens
when you horse around

1243
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:45,847
like the boy scouts,
and that goes for everyone.

1244
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,849
Okay, just take this tissue
and hold it

1245
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:49,718
to your nose
until the bleeding stops,

1246
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,919
all right?

1247
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,254
Maybe I can lighten the mood

1248
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:55,958
with what I have in my pack.

1249
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:01,897
Find a clean patch of snow
and fill up these cups.

1250
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:04,866
Because...

1251
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:07,202
It's time...

1252
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:08,904
For...

1253
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:10,005
Snow cones!

1254
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:15,944
I cannot believe you carried

1255
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,946
those all the way up here.

1256
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:20,716
Good thing I did, we need a morale
boost bad, myself included.

1257
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:21,817
Plus up here,

1258
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:24,886
a little sugar goes a long way.

1259
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:25,887
Oh, I got four more flavors.

1260
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:27,122
What?

1261
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,057
Wait 'till you taste
pina colada.

1262
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:30,926
So good.

1263
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,678
We have a lot of flavors
to choose from.

1264
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,947
Pina colada.

1265
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:54,683
- Cheers.
- - All right, here.

1266
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:55,884
I don't know if I want

1267
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:58,720
tiger's blood or Bree's blood.

1268
01:00:58,722 --> 01:00:59,721
Hilarious, mindy.

1269
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:01,023
Disgusting.

1270
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:03,158
Exactly what
I was going for, thanks.

1271
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,761
Hey, girls, what do we say
to sister Carrington?

1272
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:08,330
Thank you, sister Carrington.

1273
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:10,999
You're welcome, but as you eat

1274
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:13,869
I want you
to think of something.

1275
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:16,371
How did I come to share
this delicious treat?

1276
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,840
Well, it took
a little planning,

1277
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,442
sacrifice, creativity,

1278
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:22,210
and a little help
from mother nature,

1279
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:26,715
but in the end,
oh how sweet the reward.

1280
01:01:26,717 --> 01:01:29,951
Now, look at the bottom
of your cups.

1281
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:32,287
Don't show anyone,
but if you remove the tape

1282
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:36,124
it will reveal the name
of your secret sister.

1283
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,161
We're in the middle of nowhere,

1284
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:41,063
how are we supposed
to buy each other gifts?

1285
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:45,033
You can't, no one's buying
secret sister gifts this year.

1286
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,702
You're gonna have to
use a little planning,

1287
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,370
creativity, sacrifice,

1288
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,305
a little help
from mother nature.

1289
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:52,140
Find it, make it,
write it, whatever,

1290
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:55,010
but it has to come from you
and it should mean something.

1291
01:01:56,847 --> 01:01:59,414
- Mom.
- I didn't say it would be easy.

1292
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:02,050
I only said it
would be worth it.

1293
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,318
I still don't know if Carrie

1294
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,986
assigned Bree
as my secret sister

1295
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:08,056
on purpose or if it was
just bad Karma

1296
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,092
for busting her nose
with an ice ball.

1297
01:02:10,094 --> 01:02:11,193
But either way,

1298
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:13,361
I wasn't looking forward to it.

1299
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:15,063
That was no secret.

1300
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:24,372
Welcome home, weary travelers.

1301
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:25,941
I was starting
to worry about ya,

1302
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:28,009
I almost sent up smoke signals.

1303
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:29,377
Got the tents all dried
and you'll find

1304
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,813
your clothes on the line.

1305
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:36,752
Sort them out yourselves,
I'm not your mother.

1306
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:38,820
You're turning in already,
what's the deal?

1307
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:41,356
We're just gonna take,
like, a tiny nap, okay?

1308
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:45,127
Who takes a nap at 6:00 P.M.?

1309
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:47,395
It's been a long day.

1310
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,466
I don't remember naptime
in the golden schedule.

1311
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:53,068
It's okay, let 'em rest a bit,

1312
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,803
I'll just shuffle some things
around later.

1313
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:56,271
As long as you're okay with it,

1314
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,106
but they still have
their dinner duties tonight.

1315
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,474
I'll wake 'em up in a bit.

1316
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:00,842
In that case, I'm gonna go take

1317
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:02,044
hammock duty for a little bit.

1318
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:03,512
Jealous.

1319
01:03:03,514 --> 01:03:05,514
You know, come to think of it,
I'm just gonna lay

1320
01:03:05,516 --> 01:03:08,450
the seat back in the Van and just
rest my eyes for a little bit.

1321
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,085
Fine.

1322
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:11,853
More time for whittling.

1323
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,125
What's wrong,
you're not sleepy?

1324
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:20,395
I can't sleep
when it's light out.

1325
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:23,064
You got a knife?

1326
01:03:23,066 --> 01:03:24,232
You'd think
after all these years

1327
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:26,101
I'd be a better whittler.

1328
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:31,339
I think that's
the best looking carved mule

1329
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:32,507
I've seen.

1330
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:34,209
Trust me, I've seen a lot.

1331
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:35,343
I'm just messing around.

1332
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:37,078
Messing around?

1333
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,047
Please, 64 years
and I've never seen

1334
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:42,050
anyone your age
whittle like that.

1335
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:43,585
What are you working on?

1336
01:03:43,587 --> 01:03:46,121
This is a faith key.

1337
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:47,989
I make it for all the girls.

1338
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,324
This one's for you.

1339
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,560
Or it will be
when I'm finished with it.

1340
01:03:51,562 --> 01:03:53,361
What's a faith key?

1341
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:55,197
It's a little something
to remind you

1342
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:58,500
that faith is the key
to solve any problem.

1343
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:02,103
Big or small,
it all starts with faith.

1344
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:03,538
Can't solve everything.

1345
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,373
Sure it can, just not always

1346
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,410
exactly in the way
you want it to.

1347
01:04:08,412 --> 01:04:11,079
You sound like my dad.

1348
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:14,549
He was a good man, wasn't he?

1349
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:16,284
How do you know?

1350
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:19,187
Holly thought we should
be aware of the situation.

1351
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:22,090
Great, so now everyone knows?

1352
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:25,393
Just Carrie and I
and Phoebe of course.

1353
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:27,395
Are you upset that she told us?

1354
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:30,232
I just don't see how
it's anybody's business.

1355
01:04:30,234 --> 01:04:31,867
She wanted us to know so that

1356
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,134
we could be more caring,

1357
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:35,604
more sensitive
to how you're feeling.

1358
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:38,106
Why would you guys care?

1359
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:39,407
I'm not even part
of your church.

1360
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,209
We don't care.

1361
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:43,912
We don't care
that you're not a member.

1362
01:04:43,914 --> 01:04:46,214
If you're with us,
you're family,

1363
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:50,919
and we'll try
to treat you as such.

1364
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:53,255
Do you know where this is from?

1365
01:04:53,257 --> 01:04:55,323
- No.
- Vietnam.

1366
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:57,292
I got it
on my second tour there.

1367
01:04:57,294 --> 01:05:00,028
Most people don't know that

1368
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,063
there were women
on the front lines,

1369
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:03,965
but we were there.

1370
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:06,101
Most of us were nurses.

1371
01:05:06,103 --> 01:05:08,036
We were...

1372
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:12,440
So close to the fighting
that when

1373
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:14,175
the battle ended
they'd bring us

1374
01:05:14,177 --> 01:05:15,577
all of the wounded no matter

1375
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:18,580
what side they were on.

1376
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:20,315
One of the questions
we were asked

1377
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:23,251
was well
what did you do when...

1378
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,420
You had a Vietcong soldier.

1379
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:31,092
I'd say same thing
we did with one of our own.

1380
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:35,030
That was given to me
by a Vietcong soldier

1381
01:05:35,032 --> 01:05:38,433
who was on the wrong end
of a grenade.

1382
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:41,703
They brought him to us
in pieces,

1383
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:46,508
but the good lord helped us
put him back together.

1384
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,543
I'll never forget
the look of gratitude

1385
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:52,180
in his eyes
when he gave it to me.

1386
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:56,651
This reminds me that god
doesn't care about sides.

1387
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:59,220
We're all his children.

1388
01:05:59,222 --> 01:06:03,325
We should treat each other
as brothers and sisters.

1389
01:06:03,327 --> 01:06:06,161
So, I guess
that means I shouldn't have

1390
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:09,464
chucked a snowball
at Bree's face today.

1391
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:13,268
- On purpose?
- No, I...

1392
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,570
Kind of.

1393
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:17,439
Bet it was a sight.

1394
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:19,341
Blood just went...

1395
01:06:19,343 --> 01:06:23,078
Dang, I missed all the drama.

1396
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,280
Well I don't know how
you can make that right,

1397
01:06:25,282 --> 01:06:28,283
but I have an idea
where you can start.

1398
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:31,519
Now, according
to the golden doohickey,

1399
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:34,589
Bree is supposed to be
on dinner duty tonight.

1400
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:36,524
Maybe you could switch.

1401
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:38,226
I don't know.

1402
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:39,394
She's already accused me

1403
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:41,329
of trying
to impressed everybody.

1404
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:42,731
That'll probably
just make it worse.

1405
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:46,034
She's a 17-year-old girl,
so no promises,

1406
01:06:46,036 --> 01:06:49,170
but my guess is she'll be
too hungry to complain.

1407
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:58,646
I hope they like it.
It's a family recipe.

1408
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:01,149
Well if it tastes half
as good as it smells,

1409
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:04,085
you'll be camp queen
by sundown.

1410
01:07:04,087 --> 01:07:05,553
Is that a real thing?

1411
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:08,123
No, and don't mention it
to sister Carrington,

1412
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:11,259
she has enough ideas.

1413
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:14,162
Now, for the moment of truth.

1414
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:21,703
Please tell me
this isn't a dream.

1415
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,805
Just like clockwork.

1416
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:35,083
Oof.

1417
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,821
Wake up. I think we overslept.

1418
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,394
Oh, boy,
looks like I got a visit

1419
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:47,662
from the snooze fairy.

1420
01:07:47,664 --> 01:07:49,798
Oh, will you look at that,

1421
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,666
everything's set up.

1422
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:55,470
- Can I have some?
- Yeah, sure.

1423
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,379
Oh, this is delicious.

1424
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:06,081
Oh, I'm so proud of my Bree

1425
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,483
for sticking to the schedule
without me reminding.

1426
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:09,684
Where is she,
I wanna kiss the cook.

1427
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:12,687
Sorry, sorry, sorry, so sorry.

1428
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:16,157
I don't know what happened,
I'll start cooking right away.

1429
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,294
I guess we're not
following the schedule?

1430
01:08:19,296 --> 01:08:21,296
You guys were asleep
and I thought

1431
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:22,831
I could just
switch your nights.

1432
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,599
You could've woken me up
and asked.

1433
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:25,834
It's okay, just take her night.

1434
01:08:25,836 --> 01:08:26,868
It's not okay, it was my night,

1435
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,403
I was supposed to do it.

1436
01:08:28,405 --> 01:08:29,871
Bree, honey,
why don't you come and get

1437
01:08:29,873 --> 01:08:31,506
some food, I think you
might be a little hungry.

1438
01:08:31,508 --> 01:08:34,409
I'm not hungry, mom.

1439
01:08:34,411 --> 01:08:36,544
I just, I don't understand

1440
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,346
why nobody cares
about following

1441
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:39,781
the golden rules.

1442
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:42,450
I mean,
we have a schedule and people

1443
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,185
are just doing
other people's jobs

1444
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:45,420
and everything, it's just...

1445
01:08:45,422 --> 01:08:46,888
She's right, we shouldn't break

1446
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:49,457
the golden rules
by helping people out.

1447
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:50,758
Whatever, mindy,
you know what I mean.

1448
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,128
I'm just, I'm just trying to be

1449
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,696
the best ycl that I can be

1450
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:58,900
and apparently
I'm like the worst one ever.

1451
01:08:58,902 --> 01:09:00,401
Bree, don't say that.

1452
01:09:00,403 --> 01:09:02,871
No, you're not, Bree.

1453
01:09:02,873 --> 01:09:04,772
I was only kidding, it was a...

1454
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:06,641
Bree, honey.

1455
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:10,211
What did I tell you?

1456
01:09:10,213 --> 01:09:13,414
I made no promises,
but it ain't over yet.

1457
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:16,251
Here's your olive branch,
my dear.

1458
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,493
I was gonna make
chicken parm...

1459
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,232
I just prepared for it.

1460
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,607
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1461
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:40,875
I know I should've asked you,

1462
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:42,510
I just felt really bad
about earlier

1463
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:45,513
and I wanted to let you sleep.

1464
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:55,256
Anyway, I hope you like it.

1465
01:09:55,258 --> 01:10:00,428
It's a family recipe, and if
anything, it fills a hole.

1466
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,963
Thanks.

1467
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:04,299
You're welcome.

1468
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:08,836
There's a story in the Bible

1469
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:10,572
where esau trades
his entire birthright

1470
01:10:10,574 --> 01:10:13,541
to his brother Jacob
for a bowl of soup.

1471
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:16,711
My dad swore it must have
been bread bowl chili.

1472
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:17,812
Done right,
it's the single most

1473
01:10:17,814 --> 01:10:19,681
satisfying meal on the planet.

1474
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:20,949
Oh, my gosh, it's so good.

1475
01:10:20,951 --> 01:10:22,350
I know, right?

1476
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:23,384
It's like there are little bits

1477
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:25,887
of Harry styles in there.

1478
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:27,322
That is disgusting.

1479
01:10:27,324 --> 01:10:28,756
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

1480
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:30,325
Seriously?

1481
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:34,295
He claimed that wars have been

1482
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:35,497
fought and peace has been made

1483
01:10:35,498 --> 01:10:37,565
over our family recipe.

1484
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:44,472
Good thing, too.
'Cause I needed a win.

1485
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,275
Thanks dad.

1486
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:49,644
For real this time.

1487
01:10:49,646 --> 01:10:50,845
One more time.

1488
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:51,980
One more time.

1489
01:10:51,982 --> 01:10:54,415
Jesus style.

1490
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:34,922
Roxie, shh, shh,
be quiet, be quiet.

1491
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,303
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1492
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:53,341
I don't know what you got going on
over there, but I don't like it.

1493
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,910
See ya, roxie.

1494
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:57,512
Oh, no.

1495
01:11:57,514 --> 01:11:58,846
Come on, fess up.

1496
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:01,382
Last chance, here I come.

1497
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:05,953
What's going on here, ladies?

1498
01:12:05,955 --> 01:12:07,388
Phoebe, honey,

1499
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:09,090
do you have something
to tell us?

1500
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:14,429
Sorry to scare you,
it was just me and myleka.

1501
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:16,464
May I ask why
you're barking like a dog

1502
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:17,765
in the middle of the night?

1503
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:19,667
We couldn't sleep,
so we all decided

1504
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,035
we would try to make the noises

1505
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:22,470
of our spirit animals.

1506
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:23,805
You all decided this?

1507
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:29,644
Yeah, we thought that it would
help us reconnect with each other.

1508
01:12:35,752 --> 01:12:37,418
I don't hear any tortoises.

1509
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,787
Um, tortoises
are completely silent,

1510
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:41,589
they only make noises
when they're mating.

1511
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:43,791
Okay, I've heard enough.

1512
01:12:43,793 --> 01:12:45,059
I know you guys are bonding

1513
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:48,062
in some strange girly way,

1514
01:12:48,064 --> 01:12:49,931
and I think that's great,

1515
01:12:49,933 --> 01:12:54,736
but could you please
just save it until sun up?

1516
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:58,806
- Sure, yeah, totally.
- Wonderful.

1517
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:00,842
I'll see you in the morning.

1518
01:13:00,844 --> 01:13:03,444
I am really proud of you girls.

1519
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:05,413
Makenna and myleka,
wow, you guys

1520
01:13:05,415 --> 01:13:07,715
freaked me out,
you sounded just like roxie.

1521
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:08,983
That's crazy.

1522
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:09,984
Good night.

1523
01:13:09,986 --> 01:13:13,654
- Good night.
- Night.

1524
01:13:13,656 --> 01:13:15,089
Good night.

1525
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,094
I thought you said
they didn't like you.

1526
01:13:20,096 --> 01:13:22,530
I'm as surprised as you are.

1527
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,674
Are you kidding me?

1528
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:09,110
What's wrong, we're just
being our spirit animals.

1529
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:11,979
Spirit animals? Really, mom?

1530
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:12,980
What kind of animal was that?

1531
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:14,215
That's my cougar.

1532
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:15,950
It sounded more like
an angry gerbil.

1533
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:17,919
Well this gerbil wants you guys

1534
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:21,155
to wake up, it's the long-awaited
day, the trial of faith.

1535
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:22,523
Hurry, up and at 'em, girls.

1536
01:14:22,525 --> 01:14:25,159
- Come on.
- I'm up. Let's do this.

1537
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:26,661
I have never lost
the trial of faith

1538
01:14:26,663 --> 01:14:29,730
and I'm not about
to do it now, so get up.

1539
01:14:29,732 --> 01:14:32,967
Bree, wait, don't we have
a service project first?

1540
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:38,573
She's right, and I have
a doozy lined up for you.

1541
01:14:38,575 --> 01:14:40,575
Can we please just sleep
for half an hour

1542
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:43,177
or longer, it is so early.

1543
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:45,980
No, the rangers are coming
in a half hour,

1544
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,815
if you want to have food
in your belly

1545
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:51,486
before we leave,
you better get going.

1546
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:24,819
I don't know what
all the fuss is about.

1547
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:26,521
They're just gonna get
dirty anyway.

1548
01:15:26,523 --> 01:15:28,723
Oh, it's just nice
to look presentable, you know?

1549
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:30,291
Yeah,
for your ranger boyfriends,

1550
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:31,993
- mom.
- Phoebe.

1551
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,863
Oh, there you are, bishop.

1552
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:36,964
I was getting worried
about you.

1553
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:38,699
Sorry, sorry.

1554
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:41,235
I just finished book two.
So addicting, right?

1555
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:43,304
That katniss is so resilient.

1556
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:45,306
Here are the coordinates
to the ark,

1557
01:15:45,308 --> 01:15:47,942
follow
the instructions precisely.

1558
01:15:47,944 --> 01:15:50,211
This is kinda the capstone
of the entire theme,

1559
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:52,146
so we have to get everything
just right.

1560
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:53,948
- I won't let you down.
- Okay, we should be there

1561
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,716
sometime this evening.

1562
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:56,984
Thank you so much.

1563
01:15:56,986 --> 01:15:58,319
Sure.

1564
01:15:58,321 --> 01:16:02,056
All right, let's move, come on.

1565
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:09,724
Well, well, well, may I say you

1566
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:11,025
ladies look lovely
this morning.

1567
01:17:11,027 --> 01:17:13,327
You really do,
and I'm sorry we're late.

1568
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:14,795
That's on us, ranger hobie here

1569
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,631
thought he saw
a yellow-billed cuckoo

1570
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:18,899
on the way up here, so we had
to stop and investigate.

1571
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:22,703
Turns out I'm the cuckoo. It was just
a mockingbird up to his old tricks.

1572
01:17:22,705 --> 01:17:24,305
- Yeah.
- I'm not surprised, yellow-billed cuckoos

1573
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:25,873
are rarely found this far west.

1574
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:29,377
Wow, lookie here,
not only is she cute,

1575
01:17:29,379 --> 01:17:31,012
but she's got a brain
in her head.

1576
01:17:31,014 --> 01:17:32,146
Hopefully
she's got some muscles

1577
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,648
on the ol' armskis

1578
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:35,716
'cause we got a lot
of fences to mend.

1579
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:38,686
Will ranger Craig
or ranger Jeff be joining us?

1580
01:17:38,688 --> 01:17:41,422
No, sorry,
you're stuck with us,

1581
01:17:41,424 --> 01:17:44,091
but word on the trail is
we're pretty cool, too.

1582
01:17:44,093 --> 01:17:45,326
Where did they go?

1583
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:46,827
They got sent
on a special mission.

1584
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,162
- Yeah.
- Really?

1585
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,697
During the flash flood
a bevy of otter pups

1586
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:52,333
got separated from mama otter.

1587
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,735
So, they're out there
just working around the clock

1588
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:56,103
trying to get
that family reunited.

1589
01:17:56,105 --> 01:17:57,204
Do they need any help?

1590
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:59,006
I don't think they do.

1591
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:02,043
But good news,
we need a lot of help.

1592
01:18:02,045 --> 01:18:05,446
So, what do you say
we all get this party started?

1593
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:06,681
Break it down.

1594
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:07,682
Where do we start?

1595
01:18:07,684 --> 01:18:08,916
Glad you asked.

1596
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:10,985
We're gonna take
all the decayed logs,

1597
01:18:10,987 --> 01:18:13,988
pop 'em off this fence and load
them up over by the truck.

1598
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:15,956
Once that's done-serino,
we're gonna put

1599
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,024
the new ones

1600
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,427
on where
the old ones once were.

1601
01:18:19,429 --> 01:18:20,995
Yup, just...

1602
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:22,363
We got a lot of
work after that too,

1603
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:24,999
it's gonna be lots
of work all day 'round.

1604
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:26,167
I'm totally
telling dad that you

1605
01:18:26,169 --> 01:18:27,702
have a crush on a park ranger.

1606
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:30,738
Please stop talking.

1607
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:09,276
It's probably better

1608
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:11,145
we didn't see ranger Craig
and Jeff again.

1609
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:12,913
They probably
wouldn't have lived up

1610
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:16,784
to the images of perfection
we'd created in our minds.

1611
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:22,123
The new guys were nice and really
helpful, mustaches and all.

1612
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:23,324
It didn't take long
for Charlotte

1613
01:19:23,326 --> 01:19:25,793
to find them cute in a way.

1614
01:19:25,795 --> 01:19:29,296
They were still boys after all.

1615
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:31,866
There was something special
about that morning

1616
01:19:31,868 --> 01:19:34,401
that had nothing
to do with the rangers.

1617
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:35,970
It was the first time
that everyone

1618
01:19:35,972 --> 01:19:40,040
was together
and everyone was having fun.

1619
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:41,842
It was hard work, but we built

1620
01:19:41,844 --> 01:19:44,345
something awesome together.

1621
01:19:44,347 --> 01:19:48,082
Best of all,
there was no drama.

1622
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:53,921
Until we got back to camp.

1623
01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:55,122
We gotta hurry up,

1624
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,892
'cause I need a snack.

1625
01:19:57,894 --> 01:20:00,060
I know, I'm hungry too.

1626
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,507
Is this a prank?

1627
01:20:13,509 --> 01:20:16,343
No, it was a bear.

1628
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:18,913
A bear?

1629
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:21,248
We have to go tell
the leaders, come on.

1630
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:26,120
Roxie.

1631
01:20:26,122 --> 01:20:29,590
Roxie.

1632
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:36,363
Roxie.

1633
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:41,202
Roxie!

1634
01:20:41,204 --> 01:20:43,838
Roxie!

1635
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,906
Roxie!

1636
01:20:45,908 --> 01:20:47,441
What happened to it?

1637
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:49,176
Oh, my god.

1638
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:55,149
Stay together,
the bear still may be near.

1639
01:20:55,151 --> 01:20:57,551
Is everyone here?

1640
01:20:57,553 --> 01:20:59,119
Where's Phoebe?

1641
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:00,888
She was just here,
she was just with us.

1642
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:01,889
Phoebe!

1643
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:02,957
Phoebe!

1644
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:13,968
Roxie's gone.

1645
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:16,003
We left roxie at home.

1646
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:17,404
Phoebe snuck her on the ark.

1647
01:21:17,406 --> 01:21:18,873
We've been hiding her,
I'm so sorry,

1648
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:19,940
I should have told you.

1649
01:21:19,942 --> 01:21:20,941
We have to go after her.

1650
01:21:20,943 --> 01:21:23,010
Holly, wait!

1651
01:21:23,012 --> 01:21:25,880
You stay here
and you stay together!

1652
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:26,981
Holly, wait.

1653
01:21:26,983 --> 01:21:29,917
Let's say a prayer, come on.

1654
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:31,585
Dear heavenly father,
please bless

1655
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:33,454
that we'll be able
to find Phoebe.

1656
01:21:33,456 --> 01:21:34,889
Roxie!

1657
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:36,891
Please protect her
from the bear.

1658
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:38,959
Please keep roxie safe. Roxie!

1659
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:40,161
We ask these things in the name

1660
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:41,896
of Jesus Christ, amen.

1661
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:43,898
Amen.

1662
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,599
- She went this way.
- How do you know?

1663
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:46,901
The tracks go
in this direction,

1664
01:21:46,903 --> 01:21:48,335
they went the wrong way.

1665
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:50,170
Wait, we're supposed
to stay here.

1666
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:52,239
We have to go after her.

1667
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,374
I'm going with her.

1668
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:54,675
Bree?

1669
01:21:54,677 --> 01:21:56,176
Roxie!

1670
01:21:56,178 --> 01:21:58,045
Come here, girl!

1671
01:21:58,047 --> 01:21:59,680
Roxie!

1672
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:01,215
Phoebe?

1673
01:22:01,217 --> 01:22:03,450
Phoebe.

1674
01:22:03,452 --> 01:22:05,920
Phoebe.

1675
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:07,655
Phoebe?

1676
01:22:07,657 --> 01:22:09,456
Roxie!

1677
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:12,092
Roxie, come on, girl!

1678
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:15,963
Roxie?

1679
01:22:15,965 --> 01:22:18,332
Phoebe?

1680
01:22:18,334 --> 01:22:20,467
Lane?

1681
01:22:20,469 --> 01:22:23,971
Roxie, roxie!

1682
01:22:23,973 --> 01:22:25,339
R...

1683
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:33,948
roxie.

1684
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:44,091
Oh, please, no.

1685
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:46,393
Phoebe.

1686
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:50,564
Roxie.

1687
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:54,368
Lane.

1688
01:22:56,604 --> 01:22:58,372
I'm so sorry.

1689
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:02,009
I'm so sorry.

1690
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:03,610
Phoebe.

1691
01:23:03,612 --> 01:23:07,982
Phoebe, oh,
we were so worried about you.

1692
01:23:07,984 --> 01:23:11,085
I'm so glad you're okay,
let's get you back to camp.

1693
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:15,055
Come on, let's get you back.

1694
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:16,123
Oh.

1695
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:20,227
Everything's gonna be okay,
I promise,

1696
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:21,362
okay, it's going to be
all right.

1697
01:23:21,364 --> 01:23:22,997
It's going to be okay.

1698
01:23:22,999 --> 01:23:25,065
Stop telling her
everything's gonna be okay.

1699
01:23:25,067 --> 01:23:27,234
Her dog is dead,
that's not okay.

1700
01:23:27,236 --> 01:23:29,436
Maybe she's still alive.
Let's just say a prayer...

1701
01:23:29,438 --> 01:23:32,473
you already said a prayer
and it didn't work.

1702
01:23:32,475 --> 01:23:33,474
Okay?

1703
01:23:33,476 --> 01:23:34,742
Just leave us alone

1704
01:23:34,744 --> 01:23:36,510
and let us deal with this
right now.

1705
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,412
Praying is not gonna help.

1706
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:45,552
Look, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you,

1707
01:23:45,554 --> 01:23:47,388
I just...

1708
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:55,629
What do we do? What do we do?

1709
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:56,697
Phoebe, that's a grizzly bear,

1710
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,132
not a black bear, right?

1711
01:23:58,134 --> 01:23:59,566
It's a grizzly bear,
I'm pretty sure.

1712
01:23:59,568 --> 01:24:01,668
What can we do?
Do you remember what to do?

1713
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,137
Play dead and cover your neck.

1714
01:24:03,139 --> 01:24:04,138
Okay, I think she's right.

1715
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,139
Wait, are you sure?

1716
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:07,074
Get down.

1717
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:52,152
For some people,
praying comes naturally.

1718
01:24:52,154 --> 01:24:53,754
For others,
they have to be sniffed

1719
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:55,355
by an 800-pound
grizzly bear before

1720
01:24:55,357 --> 01:24:57,758
they realize its importance.

1721
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,098
We probably sat there
in the fetal position

1722
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,566
for a good 30 minutes
before we dare

1723
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:08,869
look up and see
if the bear had really gone.

1724
01:25:08,871 --> 01:25:12,139
A good part of me
didn't wanna move at all.

1725
01:25:12,141 --> 01:25:13,540
I knew the moment we did

1726
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:15,375
Phoebe would have
to be reminded of her pain

1727
01:25:15,377 --> 01:25:19,246
and I couldn't stand
to see her that way.

1728
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,417
Well, it looks like
Cain's about six miles east

1729
01:25:23,419 --> 01:25:25,352
- by now.
- How can you be sure?

1730
01:25:25,354 --> 01:25:27,588
Well, we tag all the bears
for research purposes

1731
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:30,290
and when we need to find them
we turn on the ol' GPS.

1732
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:31,291
Boop.

1733
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:32,626
We'll keep an eye on him.

1734
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:34,294
You guys should be okay
to stay here

1735
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:36,530
as long as
you keep your food tied up.

1736
01:25:36,532 --> 01:25:39,299
And if you have any candy,
you "must-stash" it away.

1737
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:40,667
Mustache,
that's how I remember.

1738
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:42,336
That's very nice of you sir,

1739
01:25:42,338 --> 01:25:45,439
but I think it would better
if we packed out early.

1740
01:25:45,441 --> 01:25:47,341
Okay, well let us know
if we can do anything for you,

1741
01:25:47,343 --> 01:25:49,910
we're here for you
and mother nature.

1742
01:25:49,912 --> 01:25:52,179
- Thank you.
- All right, thanks.

1743
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:04,458
You heard it, ladies.

1744
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:07,294
Tear it down,
or what's left of it.

1745
01:26:07,296 --> 01:26:08,629
Wait.

1746
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:09,830
This is all my fault,

1747
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:10,931
I'm the one
that left the syrup out

1748
01:26:10,933 --> 01:26:12,633
like an idiot.

1749
01:26:12,635 --> 01:26:14,668
Don't punish the girls
because of my carelessness.

1750
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:18,205
No, it's my fault, he probably
smelled dog food, too.

1751
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:21,275
Phoebe didn't know any better.

1752
01:26:21,277 --> 01:26:23,277
There's no need
to play the blame game.

1753
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:26,246
We're a team, a unit.

1754
01:26:26,248 --> 01:26:29,883
We're all responsible
for our failure here.

1755
01:26:29,885 --> 01:26:32,352
Come on,
we're burning daylight.

1756
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:35,656
All right, I'll call the bishop
and tell him to head down.

1757
01:26:35,658 --> 01:26:37,191
Okay, just hold on.

1758
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:39,326
I have been reciting
the young woman's values

1759
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:40,627
my whole life
and I don't remember

1760
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:42,262
quitting be one of them.

1761
01:26:42,264 --> 01:26:44,431
Do you remember the one
that's integrity?

1762
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:47,234
Or how about choice
and accountability?

1763
01:26:47,236 --> 01:26:48,435
Yeah, that's just it.

1764
01:26:48,437 --> 01:26:50,204
I mean,
how can we be accountable

1765
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:52,639
if we just give up?

1766
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:54,441
Look, I know that we messed up.

1767
01:26:54,443 --> 01:26:55,742
We lied about roxie,

1768
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,910
we haven't been
treating each other

1769
01:26:56,912 --> 01:26:57,978
the way that we should,

1770
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,813
but how
can we make things right

1771
01:26:59,815 --> 01:27:01,949
if we just go home?

1772
01:27:01,951 --> 01:27:03,750
We have so many more
amazing things

1773
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:04,851
that we need to do here

1774
01:27:04,853 --> 01:27:06,753
and I don't know
about you guys,

1775
01:27:06,755 --> 01:27:10,257
but I desperately need
a trial of faith right now.

1776
01:27:10,259 --> 01:27:13,260
So, please just forgive us
for messing up

1777
01:27:13,262 --> 01:27:15,796
and give us a chance
to make it right.

1778
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:21,368
Well, girls,
your president has spoken.

1779
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:24,004
Is that what you want?
Another chance?

1780
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,476
How about you, Phoebe-ster?

1781
01:27:29,478 --> 01:27:31,545
I wanna go home.

1782
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:37,918
She's hurt enough, girls.
Let's go.

1783
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:58,472
I know exactly
how you feel right now.

1784
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:03,944
Your stomach's
all clenched and...

1785
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:06,947
Your head feels like it
will never stop pounding.

1786
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:11,285
Your heart...

1787
01:28:11,287 --> 01:28:12,986
Feels like it's just gone.

1788
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:18,659
It's the scariest feeling
in the whole entire world.

1789
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:22,896
And you feel like
it's never ever gonna go away.

1790
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,333
And in a way
it wouldn't feel right

1791
01:28:26,335 --> 01:28:27,734
if it did.

1792
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:34,341
But I promise you that roxie

1793
01:28:34,343 --> 01:28:37,577
doesn't want you
to feel this way.

1794
01:28:37,579 --> 01:28:41,648
If she were here right now,
she'd run right up to you,

1795
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:46,987
she'd lick your face, and
she'd tell you she loves you.

1796
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:50,357
Tell you it's okay for you
to try and be happy again.

1797
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:55,562
She'd want you to look around
at all these people

1798
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:57,964
who love you.

1799
01:28:57,966 --> 01:28:59,433
And who are here for you

1800
01:28:59,435 --> 01:29:01,935
and who wanna help you
through this.

1801
01:29:03,738 --> 01:29:06,540
If you wanna go home, we'll go.

1802
01:29:06,542 --> 01:29:10,977
Okay? Just say the word
and we're outta here.

1803
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:13,747
But if you wanna try and stay

1804
01:29:13,749 --> 01:29:17,050
and fight through this
together?

1805
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:21,822
We are all here for you.

1806
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:25,492
What do you say?

1807
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,797
I want to try.

1808
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:33,734
For roxie.

1809
01:29:41,075 --> 01:29:42,809
You all set for this?

1810
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:46,413
Finalized everything
with the bishop this morning.

1811
01:29:46,415 --> 01:29:49,583
Okay, you asked for it.

1812
01:29:49,585 --> 01:29:51,151
Time for the trial of faith.

1813
01:29:53,789 --> 01:29:57,057
If you can complete the trial
as a group

1814
01:29:57,059 --> 01:29:59,693
before sundown,
then you've earned the right

1815
01:29:59,695 --> 01:30:00,994
to stay, if not,

1816
01:30:00,996 --> 01:30:03,864
then it's sayonara,
sweethearts.

1817
01:30:03,866 --> 01:30:04,865
Is that fair?

1818
01:30:04,867 --> 01:30:06,666
Yeah.

1819
01:30:06,668 --> 01:30:07,734
Oorah.

1820
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:10,170
Oorah.

1821
01:30:10,172 --> 01:30:11,938
This year's trial of faith

1822
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,875
is a quest to reach Noah's ark.

1823
01:30:14,877 --> 01:30:16,910
Will you be fit
to enter the ark,

1824
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:20,647
or will you be washed away?

1825
01:30:20,649 --> 01:30:23,016
You must complete
this task together

1826
01:30:23,018 --> 01:30:25,452
using only
the supplies provided

1827
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:27,020
in the backpack
in front of you,

1828
01:30:27,022 --> 01:30:28,955
the holy Bible,
and your knowledge

1829
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:32,092
of the golden rulebooks.

1830
01:30:32,094 --> 01:30:36,997
Prepare to be tried both
spiritually and temporally.

1831
01:30:36,999 --> 01:30:38,632
Mom, we love you,
but can we just

1832
01:30:38,634 --> 01:30:40,000
please have
the first instruction?

1833
01:30:40,002 --> 01:30:41,935
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

1834
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:49,910
And behold,
as the daughters of Noah

1835
01:30:49,912 --> 01:30:51,711
did journey to the ark,

1836
01:30:51,713 --> 01:30:53,647
they were struck with a plague.

1837
01:30:53,649 --> 01:30:56,516
The first trial
and already a plague, come on.

1838
01:30:56,518 --> 01:30:59,052
Behold, even their
leaders Bree and Paige

1839
01:30:59,054 --> 01:31:01,621
became ill with fever.

1840
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:05,892
No.

1841
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:08,495
Phoebe was struck lame.

1842
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:12,599
And Lane fell to the earth
as if she were dead.

1843
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:13,934
Ugh, I wanted that one.

1844
01:31:13,936 --> 01:31:15,235
Those who were spared did say

1845
01:31:15,237 --> 01:31:17,471
unto one another
let us bring them

1846
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:18,972
to the fount of pure water

1847
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:21,241
that they may drink
and be cleansed.

1848
01:31:21,243 --> 01:31:22,242
The spring?

1849
01:31:22,244 --> 01:31:24,077
Dibs on Phoebe.

1850
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:26,580
Mykelle. Just breathe.

1851
01:31:26,582 --> 01:31:28,615
You're good.

1852
01:31:28,617 --> 01:31:30,116
Faster.

1853
01:31:31,252 --> 01:31:33,687
Charlotte.

1854
01:31:37,558 --> 01:31:38,758
Pretty quick start.

1855
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,760
And a first aid certification.

1856
01:31:40,762 --> 01:31:42,596
Pound it.

1857
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:46,733
- Let's not do that again.
- No.

1858
01:31:46,735 --> 01:31:49,703
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- I'm hurrying.

1859
01:31:49,705 --> 01:31:52,172
I can go a little faster,
faster.

1860
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:58,044
One, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two.

1861
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:00,647
Guys, come on.

1862
01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:02,682
Hurry up, we're almost there.

1863
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:05,218
Easy for you to say,
you're not carrying a moose.

1864
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:06,553
Hey.

1865
01:32:06,555 --> 01:32:09,022
Oh, uh, a very cute moose.

1866
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:11,057
Mykelle, mindy,
just go on without us,

1867
01:32:11,059 --> 01:32:12,759
go get the next clue, okay?

1868
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:14,027
Yes, Bree.

1869
01:32:14,029 --> 01:32:15,762
Fast, fast,
right around the bend.

1870
01:32:15,764 --> 01:32:17,230
Go, go.

1871
01:32:17,232 --> 01:32:20,033
We got once chance
to make this right.

1872
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:24,137
Oh, my gosh, so much pressure.

1873
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:45,892
Why do you need that?

1874
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:47,761
Trust me.

1875
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:16,289
Bible time.

1876
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:20,327
Come on, come on, we gotta go,
gotta go, gotta go.

1877
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:22,062
She's gonna be
so happy we found this.

1878
01:33:22,064 --> 01:33:24,164
Mindy, you're going so fast.

1879
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:27,000
Depart ye, depart ye,
go ye out from fence,

1880
01:33:27,002 --> 01:33:28,868
touch no unclean thing.

1881
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:30,704
Go ye out of the midst of her.

1882
01:33:30,706 --> 01:33:34,140
Be ye clean that bear
the vessel of the lord.

1883
01:33:34,142 --> 01:33:35,742
What does that mean?

1884
01:33:35,744 --> 01:33:37,744
It's Isaiah,
no one knows what that means.

1885
01:33:37,746 --> 01:33:39,613
Vessel of the lord.

1886
01:33:39,615 --> 01:33:42,115
Like his blood vessels?

1887
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:44,918
The vase, that's the vessel,
it must be dirty.

1888
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:48,788
We have to purify the vase.

1889
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:51,024
We need a fire.

1890
01:33:51,026 --> 01:33:53,093
Okay, those of you
who have use of their legs

1891
01:33:53,095 --> 01:33:57,063
grab wood, twigs,
and pine needles.

1892
01:33:57,065 --> 01:34:00,133
Also, we're gonna need eight to
ten stones for a fire circle.

1893
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:03,003
No, Lane, you can't help until

1894
01:34:03,005 --> 01:34:04,037
we cure your plague.

1895
01:34:04,039 --> 01:34:06,139
- Remember?
- Right, sorry.

1896
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,941
Hey guys, I don't see
any matches in here,

1897
01:34:07,943 --> 01:34:10,076
but I did find this really cool

1898
01:34:10,078 --> 01:34:13,947
monocle and ol' timer mustache.

1899
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:17,884
Bigger, hurry, bigger.

1900
01:34:24,091 --> 01:34:26,660
We've made a huge mistake.

1901
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:30,430
Don't watch it, Makenna!

1902
01:34:30,432 --> 01:34:33,066
Keep your eyes shut.

1903
01:34:35,269 --> 01:34:37,337
- Hurry.
- I had to cool it

1904
01:34:37,339 --> 01:34:39,739
so it wouldn't
burn your face, Bree.

1905
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:44,411
Come on, come on, come on.

1906
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:50,050
- Nice to be alive again.
- Good to have you back.

1907
01:34:50,052 --> 01:34:51,985
So what now,
where's the next clue?

1908
01:34:51,987 --> 01:34:53,119
Was there another clue
back there?

1909
01:34:53,121 --> 01:34:54,688
No, Bree.

1910
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:57,357
Well, maybe the trial's over
and we just won.

1911
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:00,026
Hey, cheers, we did it.

1912
01:35:00,961 --> 01:35:02,696
What's that?

1913
01:35:04,165 --> 01:35:06,332
More Isaiah, great.

1914
01:35:06,334 --> 01:35:07,901
Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah.

1915
01:35:07,903 --> 01:35:10,236
Isaiah 30:14.

1916
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:14,174
Okay, it will break in pieces

1917
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:16,976
like pottery, shattered so
mercilessly that among its pieces

1918
01:35:16,978 --> 01:35:19,212
not a fragment will be
found for taking coals

1919
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:21,314
from a hearth or scooping
water out of a cistern.

1920
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:26,352
Oh, come on, that one was

1921
01:35:26,354 --> 01:35:29,956
pretty straightforward
actually.

1922
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:31,257
Guys, look!

1923
01:35:35,963 --> 01:35:39,365
All right, girls,
keep your bibles handy.

1924
01:35:39,367 --> 01:35:41,367
This is the marker,
we start from here.

1925
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:45,238
Okay, first direction,
northeast 49 degrees.

1926
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,240
Okay, how many pieces?

1927
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:48,875
The number of days
the flood lasted

1928
01:35:48,877 --> 01:35:51,144
times the days
it took to create the earth

1929
01:35:51,146 --> 01:35:54,848
divided by the width
of the ark in cubits.

1930
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:57,283
- 230.
- That was fast, are you sure?

1931
01:35:57,285 --> 01:35:59,152
Yeah, 40 times 7 is 280,

1932
01:35:59,154 --> 01:36:02,222
minus 50 cubits wide
is, like, 230.

1933
01:36:02,224 --> 01:36:03,857
Good job, Charlotte.

1934
01:36:03,859 --> 01:36:06,159
What can I say?
The guys like smart chicks.

1935
01:36:06,161 --> 01:36:09,963
Not to be painfully ironic,
but it's actually 190.

1936
01:36:09,965 --> 01:36:11,164
Uh, Phoebe,
I just did the math.

1937
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:13,233
God created earth in six days,

1938
01:36:13,235 --> 01:36:17,504
he rested on the seventh one, so 6
times 40 is 240 minus 50 is 190.

1939
01:36:17,506 --> 01:36:19,072
Technically, she's right.

1940
01:36:19,074 --> 01:36:21,074
You were almost there, though.

1941
01:36:21,076 --> 01:36:24,043
It's okay, guys like
almost smart girls too.

1942
01:36:25,246 --> 01:36:26,813
You ready?

1943
01:36:26,815 --> 01:36:31,251
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1944
01:36:31,253 --> 01:36:35,388
186, 187, 188, 189, 190.

1945
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:37,924
Nice marker, mom.

1946
01:36:37,926 --> 01:36:40,393
Okay, second direction.

1947
01:36:40,395 --> 01:36:43,096
290 degrees northwest.

1948
01:36:43,098 --> 01:36:44,464
Okay, how many paces?

1949
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:46,566
The length of the ark in cubits

1950
01:36:46,568 --> 01:36:48,935
plus Noah's age
at the time of the flood

1951
01:36:48,937 --> 01:36:52,105
divided by Goliath's height
in feet.

1952
01:36:52,107 --> 01:36:54,174
Easy, 100 give or take.

1953
01:36:54,176 --> 01:36:57,310
300 cubits long
plus 600 is 900.

1954
01:36:57,312 --> 01:36:59,045
Goliath was roughly
nine feet tall,

1955
01:36:59,047 --> 01:37:01,080
so it's not exact,
but it's about 100.

1956
01:37:01,082 --> 01:37:02,415
Where did you get nine feet?

1957
01:37:02,417 --> 01:37:04,818
Mine says he was six cubits
and a span.

1958
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:07,020
Exactly,
a cubit's 450 millimeters

1959
01:37:07,022 --> 01:37:08,922
or 18 inches
and so that would be

1960
01:37:08,924 --> 01:37:12,091
3.2 meters or 91/2 feet tall.

1961
01:37:12,093 --> 01:37:14,928
A span's like this big.

1962
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:16,262
Guys,
there are common conversions,

1963
01:37:16,264 --> 01:37:17,864
everyone should know them.

1964
01:37:17,866 --> 01:37:20,466
I think you're actually
smarter than siri.

1965
01:37:20,468 --> 01:37:21,901
Come on, guys,
let's keep moving.

1966
01:37:21,903 --> 01:37:24,370
All right,
one, two, three, four,

1967
01:37:24,372 --> 01:37:28,074
five, six, seven, eight...

1968
01:37:28,076 --> 01:37:29,909
Guys? Look at the sun.

1969
01:37:29,911 --> 01:37:31,444
We're running out of time,
we have to hurry.

1970
01:37:31,446 --> 01:37:33,046
I know, I know,
this is the last one.

1971
01:37:33,048 --> 01:37:34,314
Number of days the flood water

1972
01:37:34,316 --> 01:37:36,583
prevailed on the land
times how high

1973
01:37:36,585 --> 01:37:39,385
the water rose in cubits
divided by

1974
01:37:39,387 --> 01:37:41,487
the number of lepers
that did not return

1975
01:37:41,489 --> 01:37:43,189
to thank Jesus.

1976
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:46,593
Plus the number of sheep
the good Shepherd left behind

1977
01:37:46,595 --> 01:37:49,362
when he went to find the one,
minus the one

1978
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:52,298
he went to save,
times the number of cattle

1979
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,967
in pharaoh's dream,

1980
01:37:53,969 --> 01:37:55,535
minus the age of methuselah
when Noah was born.

1981
01:37:55,537 --> 01:37:56,603
Come on, Phoebe!

1982
01:37:56,605 --> 01:37:58,171
Guys, I'm not gonna do it,

1983
01:37:58,173 --> 01:37:59,505
I'm not gonna be able
to finish this one.

1984
01:37:59,507 --> 01:38:01,241
No, no, Phoebe,
you can't give up now.

1985
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:04,143
No!

1986
01:38:04,145 --> 01:38:06,613
I refuse to even think
another second about it.

1987
01:38:06,615 --> 01:38:08,948
Why, Phoebe?

1988
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:10,516
'Cause I see the ark.

1989
01:38:33,107 --> 01:38:35,975
Oh, my gosh, okay,
there has to be a way in.

1990
01:38:35,977 --> 01:38:37,944
Is there a note or something?

1991
01:38:37,946 --> 01:38:40,013
Girls, look to the sides.

1992
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:47,654
Is there anything left
in the backpack we can use?

1993
01:38:47,656 --> 01:38:50,924
Just the stuff we already used.

1994
01:38:50,926 --> 01:38:53,993
Oh, and this stupid faith key that
sister Rockwell's always making us.

1995
01:38:53,995 --> 01:38:56,663
Oh, my gosh, you guys, we have to
find a way, okay, we're so close.

1996
01:38:56,665 --> 01:38:58,598
I know how we're gonna get in.

1997
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,300
- How?
- Faith.

1998
01:39:00,302 --> 01:39:02,001
It's the key.

1999
01:39:02,003 --> 01:39:03,202
Okay, are you just
making fun of us,

2000
01:39:03,204 --> 01:39:04,304
like, I honestly can't tell.

2001
01:39:04,306 --> 01:39:05,471
No, literally, the faith key,

2002
01:39:05,473 --> 01:39:06,472
that's how we get into the ark.

2003
01:39:06,474 --> 01:39:07,640
Look for a keyhole.

2004
01:39:07,642 --> 01:39:08,942
We already looked everywhere,

2005
01:39:08,944 --> 01:39:10,410
we're not gonna find anything.

2006
01:39:10,412 --> 01:39:13,112
Look harder, Hannah,
okay, we have to find it.

2007
01:39:14,682 --> 01:39:18,351
Keyhole, keyhole,
keyhole, keyhole.

2008
01:39:21,722 --> 01:39:23,156
I see it.

2009
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:27,493
Hold this, hold this.

2010
01:39:34,134 --> 01:39:35,668
Give me the key.

2011
01:39:42,276 --> 01:39:45,311
Enter, my little animals.

2012
01:39:48,249 --> 01:39:49,716
You did it, Lane.

2013
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:54,587
Duck you heads.

2014
01:39:54,589 --> 01:39:56,456
It was the key.

2015
01:39:58,258 --> 01:40:00,093
You did it.

2016
01:40:00,095 --> 01:40:03,029
You survived the flood.

2017
01:40:03,031 --> 01:40:04,597
What flood?

2018
01:40:08,102 --> 01:40:09,502
Whoa!

2019
01:40:13,407 --> 01:40:16,042
I think that's as far
as she's gonna go.

2020
01:40:16,044 --> 01:40:17,310
It's just not as epic

2021
01:40:17,312 --> 01:40:19,145
as I pictured in my mind,
you know?

2022
01:40:21,149 --> 01:40:23,649
Still wish you were
on that boat with them?

2023
01:40:23,651 --> 01:40:25,151
You know, it's funny,

2024
01:40:25,153 --> 01:40:27,754
I spent countless months
building that ark

2025
01:40:27,756 --> 01:40:30,356
and trying
to make everything perfect

2026
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:32,658
and worrying that it wasn't
all gonna come together,

2027
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:35,461
and then something
magical happens like this,

2028
01:40:35,463 --> 01:40:38,164
you know,
that they all come together.

2029
01:40:38,166 --> 01:40:40,266
And it just...

2030
01:40:40,268 --> 01:40:43,102
It helps me realize that...

2031
01:40:43,104 --> 01:40:45,738
It wasn't about me
or the binder or the ark

2032
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:49,108
or any of that,
it's just all about them.

2033
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:51,277
So, as much
as I'd love to be on that

2034
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:53,279
boat right now,
I'm okay just cheering

2035
01:40:53,281 --> 01:40:55,415
them on from the sidelines,
you know?

2036
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:01,521
At least we tried.

2037
01:41:01,523 --> 01:41:04,791
All right, ladies,
let's take this party up top.

2038
01:41:10,397 --> 01:41:12,665
This is tots beautiful.

2039
01:41:16,203 --> 01:41:19,072
Great job, ladies.

2040
01:41:19,074 --> 01:41:21,240
- Good job.
- We're so proud!

2041
01:41:21,242 --> 01:41:23,676
- We love you.
- I love you.

2042
01:41:23,678 --> 01:41:25,611
It was a really good try.

2043
01:41:25,613 --> 01:41:26,846
I'm proud of y'all.

2044
01:41:26,848 --> 01:41:28,614
No place I'd rather be
than on this ark

2045
01:41:28,616 --> 01:41:31,584
with all my little animals.

2046
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:36,689
I wish roxie was here.

2047
01:41:36,691 --> 01:41:39,592
I'm sorry, sweetie.

2048
01:41:39,594 --> 01:41:42,295
She was a great dog.

2049
01:41:42,297 --> 01:41:44,297
I know I teased you
about her size,

2050
01:41:44,299 --> 01:41:47,567
but she was as brave
as could be.

2051
01:41:47,569 --> 01:41:50,803
I bet she gave that bear
a run for his money.

2052
01:41:50,805 --> 01:41:53,206
Phoebe, even though she's gone,

2053
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:55,808
she'll always be with you.

2054
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:58,177
I feel like
she might be here right now.

2055
01:41:58,179 --> 01:42:01,114
Watching us.

2056
01:42:01,116 --> 01:42:03,116
She is here.

2057
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:05,284
Do you feel her, too?

2058
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:07,353
No, she's actually right there.

2059
01:42:07,355 --> 01:42:09,322
Hey, you missing somebody?

2060
01:42:09,324 --> 01:42:11,190
Roxie, is she okay?

2061
01:42:11,192 --> 01:42:12,792
Roxie.

2062
01:42:12,794 --> 01:42:14,427
She was pretty scared
when she found me,

2063
01:42:14,429 --> 01:42:17,330
but she's in one piece.

2064
01:42:19,167 --> 01:42:20,800
If someone had told me
a week before

2065
01:42:20,802 --> 01:42:22,468
that I'd soon be
floating in a lake

2066
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,670
on Noah's ark,
I'd have told them

2067
01:42:24,672 --> 01:42:27,907
they could jump in
that proverbial lake.

2068
01:42:27,909 --> 01:42:30,243
But when it was real
and happening,

2069
01:42:30,245 --> 01:42:33,646
I didn't wish I was
anywhere else.

2070
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:36,282
Because in that moment,
I was exactly

2071
01:42:36,284 --> 01:42:37,917
where I was supposed to be

2072
01:42:37,919 --> 01:42:40,686
with the ones
I was supposed to be with.

2073
01:42:40,688 --> 01:42:42,855
- Uh-oh.
- Woo.

2074
01:42:42,857 --> 01:42:44,357
We spent the rest of camp

2075
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:47,260
strictly according
to the golden rulebook.

2076
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:50,663
We sharpened our camp skills,

2077
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:54,167
as best as we could at least.

2078
01:42:54,169 --> 01:42:56,202
Passed off
all our certifications.

2079
01:42:56,204 --> 01:42:59,172
I think this one's okay.

2080
01:42:59,174 --> 01:43:02,208
Without major incident.

2081
01:43:04,244 --> 01:43:07,246
Yeah, definitely not poisonous.

2082
01:43:10,484 --> 01:43:12,785
Appreciated a lot of nature.

2083
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:18,424
Maybe too much nature.

2084
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:23,229
And had plenty of devotionals.

2085
01:43:23,231 --> 01:43:24,564
The parable of the ten virgins

2086
01:43:24,566 --> 01:43:26,599
has great meaning in our day.

2087
01:43:26,601 --> 01:43:28,434
Five of your lanterns have oil

2088
01:43:28,436 --> 01:43:30,369
and five do not.

2089
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:33,372
With only minimal distraction.

2090
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:40,279
Mine has oil.

2091
01:43:40,281 --> 01:43:42,748
I even found some time
to do some journaling,

2092
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:46,752
but you already knew that,
huh, dad?

2093
01:43:47,988 --> 01:43:50,590
Aww, did you
wrap this yourself?

2094
01:43:50,592 --> 01:43:53,793
- So cute. -
- And even though I was stressed about it,

2095
01:43:53,795 --> 01:43:55,861
Bree really liked
her secret sister present

2096
01:43:55,863 --> 01:43:57,463
I made.

2097
01:43:58,465 --> 01:44:00,499
Thank you.

2098
01:44:00,501 --> 01:44:01,734
You're so sweet.

2099
01:44:01,736 --> 01:44:03,502
My gift wasn't too bad either.

2100
01:44:03,504 --> 01:44:05,004
Tada.

2101
01:44:05,006 --> 01:44:07,640
Led zeppelin was too long, so.
Thank you.

2102
01:44:10,644 --> 01:44:11,978
The last night
they did something

2103
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:13,946
they call a testimony meeting.

2104
01:44:13,948 --> 01:44:15,448
It sounds like
something lawyers

2105
01:44:15,450 --> 01:44:18,251
would do before a trial,
but it's not.

2106
01:44:18,253 --> 01:44:20,386
Basically anyone
who wants to can get up

2107
01:44:20,388 --> 01:44:25,491
and share their thoughts or
feelings about life, god, or...

2108
01:44:25,493 --> 01:44:26,759
Whatever they wanted, really.

2109
01:44:26,761 --> 01:44:28,995
This is my last summer here.

2110
01:44:28,997 --> 01:44:30,830
You didn't have to go
if you didn't want to.

2111
01:44:30,832 --> 01:44:31,998
Only if you felt like it.

2112
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,767
To witness this kind of love.

2113
01:44:34,769 --> 01:44:37,370
It was nice to hear
their different perspectives.

2114
01:44:38,706 --> 01:44:41,907
When I could understand them.

2115
01:44:41,909 --> 01:44:43,976
They were sweet,
but for the most part

2116
01:44:43,978 --> 01:44:45,311
it didn't have
the same effect on me

2117
01:44:45,313 --> 01:44:47,346
like it did the others.

2118
01:44:47,348 --> 01:44:50,449
Until Phoebe had to open
her big mouth.

2119
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:54,820
You all know that
I'm a pretty scared person.

2120
01:44:54,822 --> 01:44:58,057
I relate with over 60%
of the phobias on Wikipedia.

2121
01:44:58,059 --> 01:45:00,026
When I'm scared,
only a few things

2122
01:45:00,028 --> 01:45:01,394
can actually calm me down.

2123
01:45:01,396 --> 01:45:06,065
Like my dad, my mom, and roxie.

2124
01:45:06,067 --> 01:45:11,003
I know Roxie's just a dog,
but she's my best friend.

2125
01:45:11,005 --> 01:45:12,538
When I lost her,
I was as scared

2126
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:16,409
and sad as I've ever been.

2127
01:45:16,411 --> 01:45:18,010
Then, when I saw her again,

2128
01:45:18,012 --> 01:45:22,014
I was so happy, so grateful,

2129
01:45:22,016 --> 01:45:24,917
that I forgot how much it hurt

2130
01:45:24,919 --> 01:45:28,387
to lose her in the first place.

2131
01:45:28,389 --> 01:45:31,757
I'm pretty sure
that's how heaven's gonna be.

2132
01:45:31,759 --> 01:45:36,896
Lane, if it hurt this bad
to lose roxie,

2133
01:45:36,898 --> 01:45:42,034
it must have been a thousand times
worse when you lost your dad.

2134
01:45:42,036 --> 01:45:43,836
And I promise you

2135
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:47,640
that when you see him again
in heaven,

2136
01:45:47,642 --> 01:45:49,342
he will hold you in his arms

2137
01:45:49,344 --> 01:45:52,745
and all that pain and heartache

2138
01:45:52,747 --> 01:45:56,649
will be washed away
in an instant.

2139
01:45:56,651 --> 01:45:59,852
I think Jesus suffered
the worst heartache of all

2140
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:02,455
'cause he loved all of us
and wanted to make

2141
01:46:02,457 --> 01:46:06,092
a way for us to be
with the ones we love again.

2142
01:46:06,094 --> 01:46:11,797
I know in my heart
that god is real.

2143
01:46:11,799 --> 01:46:16,469
That we are his children
and he loves us.

2144
01:46:16,471 --> 01:46:17,970
I say this
in Jesus' name, amen.

2145
01:46:17,972 --> 01:46:20,106
Amen.

2146
01:46:20,108 --> 01:46:23,709
Thank you, girls,
for sharing your testimonies.

2147
01:46:23,711 --> 01:46:26,612
Well if everyone's gone
that wanted a chance to speak,

2148
01:46:26,614 --> 01:46:29,882
then we'll go ahead
and say the closing prayer.

2149
01:46:29,884 --> 01:46:32,151
Wait.

2150
01:46:32,153 --> 01:46:33,419
Can I say something?

2151
01:46:33,421 --> 01:46:34,854
Of course.

2152
01:46:40,494 --> 01:46:42,495
I just...

2153
01:46:42,497 --> 01:46:46,932
I want to thank you all for
allowing me to be apart of this.

2154
01:46:46,934 --> 01:46:48,167
I want to thank
sister Carrington

2155
01:46:48,169 --> 01:46:51,537
for pressuring me into it.

2156
01:46:51,539 --> 01:46:56,175
But seriously,
I really, really needed this.

2157
01:46:56,177 --> 01:47:00,980
I wanna thank sister Rockwell
for helping keep me here.

2158
01:47:00,982 --> 01:47:02,748
I was just about ready
to beg you

2159
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:04,850
to take me back home
that day in the sidecar,

2160
01:47:04,852 --> 01:47:07,486
but something about
her leather jacket

2161
01:47:07,488 --> 01:47:11,590
and her chaps told me
I should probably ride it out.

2162
01:47:12,793 --> 01:47:16,195
Holly, if your brother
has even half

2163
01:47:16,197 --> 01:47:20,833
of the sincerity
and kindness that you do,

2164
01:47:20,835 --> 01:47:24,470
my mom is a very,
very lucky lady.

2165
01:47:26,473 --> 01:47:29,775
Phoebe, you are so smart.

2166
01:47:29,777 --> 01:47:31,477
You've taught me
more random facts

2167
01:47:31,479 --> 01:47:33,546
than I can probably
ever remember in my lifetime,

2168
01:47:33,548 --> 01:47:37,116
but what you said just now...

2169
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:40,586
I will never ever forget.

2170
01:47:40,588 --> 01:47:43,756
I still don't know what
I believe in,

2171
01:47:43,758 --> 01:47:45,558
or if I'm even ready to try

2172
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,026
and figure all that out
for myself,

2173
01:47:47,028 --> 01:47:50,563
but I wanna thank you all
for bringing me closer

2174
01:47:50,565 --> 01:47:52,665
to a place where I can start.

2175
01:47:52,667 --> 01:47:55,935
If there is one thing
I know for sure,

2176
01:47:55,937 --> 01:47:59,004
it's that there's something
very, very special

2177
01:47:59,006 --> 01:48:00,873
about all of you.

2178
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:06,645
You're all really,
really good christians.

2179
01:48:06,647 --> 01:48:07,947
And the world is a better place

2180
01:48:07,949 --> 01:48:09,748
because of you.

2181
01:48:12,752 --> 01:48:13,819
Amen?

2182
01:48:13,821 --> 01:48:16,789
Amen.

2183
01:48:22,162 --> 01:48:24,530
Thank you, Lane.

2184
01:48:24,532 --> 01:48:26,632
Now, do I have any volunteers
for a closing prayer?

2185
01:48:26,634 --> 01:48:28,501
I'll say it.

2186
01:48:28,503 --> 01:48:29,668
Wait.

2187
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:31,170
I know I already went,

2188
01:48:31,172 --> 01:48:35,674
but I just have something else
that I need to say.

2189
01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:37,009
I feel like this past year

2190
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:39,745
we've really been struggling
as a group.

2191
01:48:39,747 --> 01:48:41,180
You know,
we've been clique-ish,

2192
01:48:41,182 --> 01:48:44,917
we have been fighting over
the stupidest things

2193
01:48:44,919 --> 01:48:50,155
and just have not been treating
each other the way we should.

2194
01:48:51,791 --> 01:48:55,027
And I feel like
that's mostly my fault.

2195
01:48:58,231 --> 01:49:01,767
Before I came to camp,
I said a prayer

2196
01:49:01,769 --> 01:49:05,538
and I asked heavenly father
to help me find the strength

2197
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:07,973
as Laurel president
to be the type of leader

2198
01:49:07,975 --> 01:49:11,777
that I needed to be to help us
come together as a group.

2199
01:49:11,779 --> 01:49:15,014
And I feel like the answer
to that prayer was you, Lane.

2200
01:49:15,016 --> 01:49:17,283
Your unselfish
and loving example

2201
01:49:17,285 --> 01:49:19,785
towards Phoebe
and your acceptance

2202
01:49:19,787 --> 01:49:23,188
of all of us showed me the type

2203
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:26,992
of young woman
that I want to be.

2204
01:49:26,994 --> 01:49:32,898
So, I appreciate you saying that we
all helped you, but the truth is...

2205
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:36,969
You helped us so much more.
So, thank you.

2206
01:49:37,938 --> 01:49:39,705
Come here.

2207
01:49:42,175 --> 01:49:43,943
Oorah.

2208
01:49:43,945 --> 01:49:45,945
Oorah.

2209
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:49,014
Okay, now
can we say the prayer?

2210
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:01,093
It wouldn't have been right

2211
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:02,328
to end camp without finishing

2212
01:50:02,330 --> 01:50:04,964
the last item
on the golden schedule.

2213
01:50:04,966 --> 01:50:07,032
The final talent show.

2214
01:50:07,034 --> 01:50:08,801
All right, listen up,
pipsqueaks.

2215
01:50:08,803 --> 01:50:10,903
Welcome to girl's camp.

2216
01:50:10,905 --> 01:50:12,905
It felt good to laugh
after crying so much.

2217
01:50:18,679 --> 01:50:20,346
I even prepared
a little something.

2218
01:50:20,348 --> 01:50:21,880
Instead of complaining about

2219
01:50:21,882 --> 01:50:24,216
how old and cheesy
your camp songs were,

2220
01:50:24,218 --> 01:50:28,954
I decided to write a new cheesy
song for you guys to learn.

2221
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:30,155
This is my first time
singing it

2222
01:50:30,157 --> 01:50:33,158
in front of anybody,
so be nice.

2223
01:52:23,037 --> 01:52:24,737
When camp was over,

2224
01:52:24,739 --> 01:52:27,740
I knew I wouldn't see
most of those girls anymore.

2225
01:52:27,742 --> 01:52:28,941
But that song would keep

2226
01:52:28,943 --> 01:52:32,144
their faces in my mind forever.

2227
01:52:50,064 --> 01:52:53,065
When I got home,
mom asked me how it went.

2228
01:52:53,067 --> 01:52:55,100
It was hard to explain.

2229
01:52:55,102 --> 01:52:56,535
It wasn't at all what
I expected,

2230
01:52:56,537 --> 01:52:59,371
but it was exactly what
I expected.

2231
01:52:59,373 --> 01:53:02,241
It wasn't scary,
but somehow it was terrifying.

2232
01:53:02,243 --> 01:53:03,442
It wasn't that fun,

2233
01:53:03,444 --> 01:53:06,378
but looking back
it was a blast.

2234
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:12,217
It was what it was and if you weren't
there you just couldn't know.

2235
01:53:12,219 --> 01:53:14,052
No matter what
happens in my life,

2236
01:53:14,054 --> 01:53:16,455
I will look back
and be proud to say

2237
01:53:16,457 --> 01:53:19,792
that once I was a beehive.
