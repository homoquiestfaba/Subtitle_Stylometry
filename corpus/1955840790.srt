12
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,825
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

13
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,592
Yes.

14
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,461
He's on edge.

15
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:13,096
You seem on edge, Nick.

16
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:14,798
Let's just let this
whole affair be simple.

17
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,334
"Affair"? What a horrible
choice of words.

18
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:22,572
Okay, Gwen, just please,
don't gang up on me, okay?

19
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:24,308
- Are we doing that?
- Yes.

20
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,675
Yes, you both are.

21
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:27,177
Apologize, sister.

22
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:29,078
You apologize, sister.

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,383
Okay, I would love a situation
without torment or turmoil and

24
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:34,817
I feel that's within reach.

25
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,621
How many assistants
does this make, Nick?

26
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:40,657
One per semester.
Summers without. Uh...

27
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:43,560
I may be off, but I believe
Naomi will be my sixth.

28
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:45,729
- Eighth.
- Eighth?

29
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:47,665
You're forgetting what's-her-name
and that one guy.

30
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,965
Well, there were two guys.

31
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,601
Two guys. Six ladies.

32
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,436
Do women make better
archivists, I wonder?

33
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:56,873
Yeah, there is a certain
meticulous quality to the work that...

34
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,109
Yes, I believe women tend
to excel at it more naturally.

35
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:02,846
I prefer to employ women
to assist me in my work.

36
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:05,082
You work in documents.

37
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:08,417
"Materials." You know
the word is "materials."

38
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,120
The "materials
of your father."

39
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:13,358
You asked me to archive
the materials of your father.

40
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:20,330
If you want your father's materials to
be appraised by the end of the year,

41
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,965
you're gonna have to accept that
I need a second pair of hands.

42
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,243
- Hey.
- Hi.

43
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:34,313
Hi, come on in.

44
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:38,215
Uh...

45
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:41,786
Alyssa, Gwendolyn,
this is Naomi.

46
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,120
That's my wife, Alyssa,
and her sister, Gwen.

47
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,955
They're Timothy's daughters.

48
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:47,824
Oh. I'm sorry, come on in.

49
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:49,262
Thank you, I will.

50
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:58,770
- Talk soon.
- Soon, soon.

51
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,718
I can help.

52
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,753
No need.

53
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:21,024
Nice time?

54
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:22,591
Yeah.

55
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:24,430
Yes, thanks. Did you?

56
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,796
Yeah, it was nice.

57
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:27,799
Very nice.

58
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:33,603
Are you still okay to go out
with Gwen early next week?

59
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:35,774
I'm sure
that'll be just fine.

60
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:47,819
What did you think
of Naomi?

61
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,122
She seemed great.

62
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,593
- Is that all?
- Uh-huh.

63
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:58,962
I mean, I think it's great that
you're working with students

64
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:00,332
on your work again.

65
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:06,505
You just said "great" twice and
"work" twice in the same sentence.

66
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,140
Is there something wrong
with the way I speak?

67
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:13,245
There's not.

68
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:19,082
You have this all sorted.

69
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:22,454
Excuse me, I'm not feeling my best.
I'm gonna lie down.

70
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:03,192
Where does Naomi stay
while she's here?

71
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:05,195
What? Um...

72
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:06,829
I don't know. Um...

73
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:09,233
Somewhere nearby,
I suppose.

74
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:12,702
In our neighborhood?

75
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:15,038
I don't know. I put her in
touch with Jack and Dorothy

76
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,207
since they're spending
Jack's sabbatical traveling.

77
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,176
You knew that, right?

78
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:22,211
That she's staying
down the street?

79
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:25,481
No, that Jack and Dorothy
are traveling.

80
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:27,918
I don't really know them.

81
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,820
Yeah, you do,
we see them all the time.

82
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,923
They're your friends.
I don't know them.

83
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,425
We've been to their house.
They've been here.

84
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:37,894
We eat together.

85
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:39,432
All right, fine.

86
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,709
Do I need to be worried
about Naomi?

87
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,044
Can you stop?

88
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,505
Does it
bother you at all?

89
00:07:23,507 --> 00:07:27,043
No. No, actually, the
pursuit of solitude and isolation

90
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:30,447
is what initially drew me
to archiving and appraising.

91
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,949
The hassles come

92
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,584
from when people don't know
exactly what it is I do.

93
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:37,988
Like Gwen,
my sister-in-law,

94
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,755
kind of reminds me,
you know,

95
00:07:39,757 --> 00:07:43,026
what the time in this room
is all about, you know.

96
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:46,396
See, there's always a Gwen.

97
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:51,468
What I mean is there's always a
widow or a daughter or a son, or...

98
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,736
Um... Well...

99
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:58,207
Well, I'm just very eager to learn
from somebody with so much experience.

100
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:02,245
There's not really that much of
this kind of thing in Australia.

101
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:06,015
- Oh. Why do you think that is?
- Um...

102
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:09,485
I don't know.
Lack of sentiment, maybe.

103
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:11,387
Stunted relationship
with the past?

104
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:15,224
I feel like people mostly just throw
stuff away and forget about it.

105
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:16,726
Hmm.

106
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,461
Interesting.

107
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:21,831
Yeah, but, um, I am excited.
I am really excited

108
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,769
to see what you have to show
me over the next few months.

109
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,170
Okay.

110
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:28,437
Okay.

111
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,373
Well,

112
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,276
I like to begin

113
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,710
- with memos and correspondence.
- Mmm-hmm.

114
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:39,049
It's a voluminous part of the process,
so I just get it out of the way.

115
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,184
I like, uh... So, okay.

116
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:44,020
- So we start with these...
- Mmm-hmm.

117
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,789
...and then

118
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,959
that goes in here, and this, and
these become the chronology.

119
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:52,363
And we're definitely going
to need that throughout.

120
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,834
All right, great. Okay.

121
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:03,373
I really liked meeting Alyssa
and Gwen the other night.

122
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,975
I hope that we can do
that kind of thing again.

123
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:07,710
Yeah, sure.

124
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:10,580
Does Gwen have kids?

125
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:13,717
Uh, no. Timothy, I think,
was secretly disappointed

126
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,618
he didn't
have grandchildren.

127
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,820
I mean, he never
told them that, but...

128
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:21,358
Obviously, they both have
their own opinion about it.

129
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,292
I guess the bloodline's dead.

130
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:25,295
Yeah, you could say that.

131
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:28,464
It's far more exciting than
what we're talking about.

132
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:31,300
Well, they both seem like
really interesting women, so

133
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:33,306
I'd like to get
to know them.

134
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,401
Sorry this place
doesn't have that much.

135
00:10:05,403 --> 00:10:07,903
It's just my place,
right here.

136
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:10,406
You know, I never really thought
about where to bring somebody

137
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:14,042
'cause they usually use this time
to, you know, meet friends or

138
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:15,612
generally get away
from me.

139
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,513
Mmm. Well,

140
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:20,583
seeing as I don't really know anybody
here, I hope you don't mind.

141
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:23,219
No, I just feel bad, it's
just not an exciting spot.

142
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,720
It's exciting to me.

143
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:27,123
I'll think of somewhere else
for us that's close by.

144
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,127
No, no, because
you like routine.

145
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,395
I can tell.

146
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,796
Repetition, you point
to that a lot.

147
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:35,831
I suppose it's true.

148
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,468
I mean, the work is pretty
similar, day to day.

149
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,802
Does that not
get to you at all?

150
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:42,070
Oh, no,
it's quite the opposite.

151
00:10:42,072 --> 00:10:44,340
It's thrilling.

152
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:48,511
It would have to be, you know,
for me to be down there,

153
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:53,150
you know, that in the end, that
it all fits inside a room.

154
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,354
And I can
internalize it and...

155
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:59,022
It's just always
appealed to me.

156
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:00,991
I don't know,
I guess I moved around a lot.

157
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,761
I was never in the same
place for very long.

158
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,762
And my parents
moved a lot, too,

159
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:10,166
so I just never really felt like
I got the chance to accumulate

160
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:13,502
the kind of stuff that these
sort of people have, you know?

161
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:16,672
So being close to it kind of
feels like, I don't know,

162
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:19,277
kind of like a fantasy
or something, you know.

163
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:23,646
I'm worried
that when I'm gone

164
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:27,987
I won't really leave much stuff
behind to be taken care of, you know.

165
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:31,389
Well, then
what's the end game?

166
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:34,925
Well, um...

167
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:38,026
I know that I'm good
at what I do and

168
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:41,830
you know, I understand the work,
as you probably feel as well.

169
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:44,033
I would like to write

170
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:47,002
nonfiction accounts
of ordinary people.

171
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:50,039
You know, dramatize them in a
way that makes them compelling.

172
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,142
Maybe see if I can get
them turned into films.

173
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:56,878
People never make films about ordinary
people who don't really do anything.

174
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,080
They're out there.

175
00:11:58,082 --> 00:11:59,882
I can take you to some.

176
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:02,053
Sure. That'd be great.

177
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,033
- How's the day going?
- Hmm.

178
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,233
Are you staying?

179
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,234
I think I have to.

180
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:21,170
Otherwise, it's just
dragging on.

181
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:22,738
Are you leaving?

182
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,675
Uh, hoping to. Sam wanted
to get together. So...

183
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:29,313
Oh. You'll meet up with her, then
I'll just see you at home whenever.

184
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,680
Yeah. Sure.

185
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:32,715
I should go finish
before I lose the thread.

186
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:35,318
- Tell Sam I said hi.
- Mmm. I will.

187
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,522
Oh. Sorry. Before I forget, I was
going to mention this before.

188
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,190
My mom called. One of her oldest
friends from college's kid

189
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:42,725
just moved here
and doesn't know anybody.

190
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:44,627
She asked me
to hang out with 'em.

191
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:47,430
Okay, you said you still had
work to get done, right?

192
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:49,532
I know. I feel bad because I'm
probably gonna have to cancel on her.

193
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,004
It's a her.
Sorry if that was unclear.

194
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:56,138
So are you working,

195
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,874
or are you going out,
just not going out with me?

196
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:00,743
That's the thing.
I'm not sure yet.

197
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:02,310
Either way,
it'll be pointless.

198
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:03,881
I met the girl once when she
was something like five.

199
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,882
I'm sure she sucks now.

200
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:08,419
What am I supposed to do,
say no to my mom?

201
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:10,686
You could try.

202
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:11,787
No.

203
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:13,291
Tell Sam I said hi.

204
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:21,097
I'm fine.
I'm just fine.

205
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:22,199
Just babysitter stuff.

206
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,465
Let's talk about it.

207
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,733
No, it's not really
doctor-patient stuff,

208
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:27,036
it's just
logistical hassles

209
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:31,773
that I've been dealing with since I
went back to work, which I, um...

210
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,545
I don't know if I should have
done that for another few months.

211
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:36,914
Mmm. There we go.

212
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,248
No, it's not
like that, it's just...

213
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,785
I guess it's about finding
balance in the home.

214
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:45,188
Does that make sense?

215
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,590
It's just now we've got
this little lumpen creature

216
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:50,695
throwing off the balance,
you know?

217
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,265
What else?

218
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:59,301
Everything's fine. I mean, it's
the same as last I saw you...

219
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,008
I was gonna ask...

220
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,643
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.
- Oh.

221
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:09,679
- What were you going to say?
- Oh, um...

222
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:13,281
I was gonna say I know I paid
for my lunch today,

223
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:17,487
but I was wondering if you could maybe
pay for it from this point forward,

224
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,523
- or maybe provide a stipend...
- I'm sorry, I should've paid today.

225
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:24,093
- I'll reimburse you.
- No, please, no, today is fine.

226
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:28,498
It's just, you know, normally I wouldn't
even go to lunch, just to save money.

227
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,099
- I got it.
- Great, thank you.

228
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:31,069
Sure.

229
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:35,839
Um...

230
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,642
Sorry, you're actually
not doing this right.

231
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:41,344
These haven't
been scanned yet

232
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:43,813
and so you can't do it properly
once they're in the plastic.

233
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,681
Oh, okay. Sorry.

234
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:47,050
No, I'm sorry, I just...

235
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,685
Learning curve.

236
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,520
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

237
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,291
Oh. All right.

238
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,266
Is it nice to, uh,

239
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:06,268
to live so close
to where you work?

240
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,440
Some people would find it stifling or,
you know, contained, but I love it.

241
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:15,281
It's thrilling. For my whole
life to exist in one small zone?

242
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:17,180
It's great.

243
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,283
Oh, so,

244
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,917
do you like the place?

245
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,419
Yeah, it's really,
really great.

246
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:26,022
Thank you so much
for helping me set it up.

247
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:28,360
And, um, for paying
the difference.

248
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:30,993
- Of course.
- Cool!

249
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:32,929
Well, I had
a great day today

250
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:36,565
and look forward
to more tomorrow.

251
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:37,568
See ya.

252
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:39,471
Yeah.

253
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:01,257
I got you this.

254
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:03,158
I hope you don't
have one already.

255
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,097
I don't, but I'd been thinking about
getting one for a little while.

256
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:15,341
So what are we talking, like
nightmare or just a Tuesday?

257
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:20,443
She's great.
She's great.

258
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:22,145
She's great.

259
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,782
She...

260
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:29,419
I'd rather... She's a great person
to work for, for me to be...

261
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,055
For me to be working for

262
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,422
right now.

263
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:37,829
My goal is to discern
what I'm getting into

264
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:42,968
before I get into it.

265
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:46,570
Sister date.

266
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,407
Ideal.

267
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,200
You only visited once?

268
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:20,469
Maybe twice.

269
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:22,471
How do you even
remember that?

270
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:24,306
I can barely remember that and
I'm five years older than you.

271
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:27,943
Well, I remember that because
you and your friends were

272
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:30,680
the greatest boys
I'd ever laid eyes on.

273
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,649
American boys
are such a novelty.

274
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,717
I couldn't wait to get home and
tell my friends about you.

275
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,119
I'm sure the story
was thoroughly exciting

276
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,819
and retold many a time
over the years.

277
00:17:37,821 --> 00:17:39,189
It was, actually.

278
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,190
My American stories
were very popular.

279
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:44,393
It was Grand Canyon,
Disneyland, and you.

280
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:45,795
Wow.

281
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:48,064
Me and the Grand Canyon.
I'm flattered.

282
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,766
And what was the sport
that you played again?

283
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:52,567
- Lacrosse.
- Lacrosse, that's it!

284
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:55,004
You and your jock friends.

285
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:57,172
Cutest boys I'd ever seen

286
00:17:57,174 --> 00:17:59,109
in America.

287
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,611
Key distinction, "In America."
You had better ones at home.

288
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:05,248
Yeah, but, you know, they wanted
to play AFL and not lacrosse.

289
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,548
Hmm.

290
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,053
My mum is going to be really
happy that we found one another.

291
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,055
Mine, too. Mine, too.

292
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:15,892
You didn't have to do it within, what,
three days of getting here, though.

293
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,427
Well, what else
was I gonna do?

294
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,131
Yeah, sure, okay.

295
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,865
What, um...
What does your wife do?

296
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:26,902
Uh, a few years ago,
I started a sound studio.

297
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:31,373
We mix, record,
engineer, everything.

298
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,176
And we hired a young,

299
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,844
efficient girl to come
in and run the place,

300
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,278
so later I married her.

301
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,082
That's the long version.

302
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,351
So you work together, then?

303
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:45,086
Yeah. Well, we spend a lot
of time around one another.

304
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:46,956
Well, you're her boss.

305
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,423
<i>Who's the Boss?</i>

306
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:51,126
Do you have that show?
Hell of a program.

307
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:53,028
No. I've never seen that show.

308
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,463
We had very limited

309
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:55,866
telly options
when I was growing up.

310
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:57,432
"Telly"?

311
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:59,936
Oh, fuck, we're gonna need
a translator.

312
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,639
Is anybody here a translator?

313
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,141
I bet they don't hear that call
to duty as often as doctors do.

314
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:07,009
Is there a translator in the premises?

315
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,312
I got a girl here and she is
trying to tell me something.

316
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,148
I don't understand
what it is.

317
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,151
So, how many times
am I gonna be able

318
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:20,256
to milk the mother's favors before
you stop hanging out with me

319
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:23,426
by virtue of guilt
and obligation?

320
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,895
Two more, but one of them can be me
introducing you to other people.

321
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:28,998
Some of the other guys from
work, if you're interested.

322
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,633
I don't know where your
head's at during this trip.

323
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:34,639
Oh, my head is interested
during this trip.

324
00:19:36,273 --> 00:19:38,209
I'll keep that one in mind.

325
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:18,514
You're back late.

326
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:21,718
Yeah, Sam had this big
saga playing out with her boss.

327
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,121
Who doesn't?

328
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:30,860
- Did you finish the mix?
- I did.

329
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,795
They're gonna come
get it tomorrow.

330
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:35,231
How was, um,
what's-her-face?

331
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,365
Naomi? She's cool.
I don't know.

332
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:39,568
What do you say to someone you
haven't seen since you were 15

333
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,073
and had no idea even existed
until a week ago?

334
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,373
So what did you say?

335
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,376
- Hmm?
- What did you guys talk about?

336
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:49,578
Boring stuff. I was only
there for a little.

337
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,748
It took me a while
to finish things up anyway.

338
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,716
She's fine. She's young.

339
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:56,384
I don't really know how to talk
to people younger than me.

340
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:58,854
Except for you.

341
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:03,625
I don't know if three years is
really a valid age distinction.

342
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:06,528
What have you been up to
since you got back?

343
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,565
Drinking some beer,
listening to some records.

344
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,936
Also I called my mom,
got credit for my good deed.

345
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,071
What a good, good guy you are.

346
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:18,641
That's what I'm always saying,
but nobody ever listens to me.

347
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:21,012
I listen. I believe you.

348
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,919
Thanks for
meeting me here.

349
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,523
Field trip a-okay.

350
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:08,257
Oh, hey, man.

351
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:10,625
How long ago did you
start working on this?

352
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:12,694
Three years.
It's a long time coming.

353
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:14,930
Wow. Yeah.
Oh, this is Naomi.

354
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:17,365
She's working with me on my
dead father-in-law's shit.

355
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:22,638
This is Mike. He put the whole
donation to this place together.

356
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,940
So the work we're about to
see, the guy, the filmmaker,

357
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:27,543
before he was a filmmaker,

358
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:30,179
he had some photograph published
in Timothy's magazine,

359
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:32,581
so that's why
we're here.

360
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,552
Cool.

361
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,121
Cool.

362
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,491
- I see no happiness in them.
- Huh.

363
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:53,930
I don't give a shit what Aly says to me.
I'll never not suspect that she's lying.

364
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,899
She's always been a liar.
She was a liar

365
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:59,701
even when she was young.

366
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:01,938
Are you telling me
you can't tell

367
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,141
that Nick's
a deeply unhappy man?

368
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:08,576
I'm not sure. I don't
really know him that well.

369
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:10,779
This is why I thought it would
be best for us to talk.

370
00:24:10,781 --> 00:24:13,815
I don't want him poisoning
your mind thoroughly.

371
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:15,084
I don't think
he's doing that.

372
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,986
In a manner of speaking.

373
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:21,090
The normal existence of him
and my sister

374
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,926
makes me lose my appetite.

375
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:26,161
You're lucky I was able to keep
it under control the other night

376
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:29,701
or I would have been sick
right there at the table.

377
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:32,168
I love Alyssa.

378
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,170
But I told her 10 years ago
that I thought

379
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:36,940
getting married was foolish

380
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:40,945
and though
I guess Nick is fine,

381
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:48,049
I'll never not suspect that she
was reacting to our father.

382
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:52,488
I'm sorry. I didn't bring you over here
to unload and then interrogate you.

383
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,590
No. No, it's great.

384
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:57,092
I think Nick wanted
to eat lunch alone anyway.

385
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:58,794
Oh, of course he did.

386
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:00,595
What a loser he can be.

387
00:25:00,597 --> 00:25:02,264
Oh, it's all right.
I kind of like him.

388
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:04,100
Give it time.

389
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,370
You'll see soon enough, if you
haven't already, that he's weak.

390
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,371
It's okay.
Most people are.

391
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:11,142
Especially men.

392
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,044
My husband was weak.

393
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,179
Got rid of him.

394
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,447
You never wanted to remarry?

395
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:20,215
Please.

396
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:23,018
I think my father
wanted an heir.

397
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:28,658
Probably that's what pushed Aly into Nick.
Or Nick into Aly, more accurately.

398
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,526
But what do I know?

399
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:35,029
I just didn't want a
god-awful, stifling home life.

400
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:37,165
Yeah.

401
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:40,603
Yeah, I think I feel
drawn towards...

402
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:44,305
- I don't wanna say "not settling down."
- Exactly. Exactly.

403
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:46,709
You get it.

404
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,344
It's just hearing you,
call it what you will,

405
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:52,480
but a young,
beautiful woman

406
00:25:52,482 --> 00:25:54,653
who understands

407
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,853
that the option is there
to just say "fuck it"

408
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:00,855
actually gives me hope
for the future.

409
00:26:00,857 --> 00:26:02,891
Be your own woman.

410
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:05,827
Don't let anybody talk you out of it.
Let me talk you into it.

411
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:07,796
That sounds great.

412
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:10,266
Aly chose a lifestyle.

413
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:15,203
I devoted my life to continuing
our father's work and legacy.

414
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:18,642
You tell me which
is the more admirable

415
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,312
choice.

416
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,680
I just felt that
she suppressed

417
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:26,615
the woman
she was meant to be

418
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:29,584
in order to be the woman
she wanted to be.

419
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:32,455
- Does that make sense?
- Mmm-hmm.

420
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:36,758
A woman devoted to work and
a strong sense of ambition

421
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,063
and a healthy sexual appetite
isn't something to be ashamed of.

422
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:43,399
You're on
the right track.

423
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:47,603
If it wasn't obvious from the way Nick
was staring at you all through dinner,

424
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,872
I would have figured it out the
minute you opened your mouth.

425
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,206
Good on you.

426
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,508
I don't think
he was staring at me.

427
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,411
Oh, yes, he was.

428
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,747
Nick's been a bad boy
in the past,

429
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,615
not recently,
that I know of.

430
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:03,251
Though I don't think Aly's
been completely honest

431
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:05,086
with me about that anymore.

432
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,622
It's ancient history.

433
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:10,926
But it took them years
to find a path back to being

434
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,197
normalish.

435
00:27:13,397 --> 00:27:15,296
How long are you here for?

436
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:18,167
Um, just a few months.

437
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,569
Promise me you'll make
the most of it.

438
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:22,770
Make the most of it how?

439
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:23,940
How old are you?

440
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,641
Twenty-five.

441
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:29,713
Twenty-five-year-old
piece of gold.

442
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:35,950
Fuck your way through
this city like I did.

443
00:27:35,952 --> 00:27:40,823
Then you won't have to deal with
the shame of living in it forever.

444
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,659
Everybody thinks it's
so easy to be all alone

445
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:46,428
and young and beautiful.

446
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,532
I was.

447
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:50,132
Like you.

448
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:53,101
Maybe even more so.

449
00:27:53,103 --> 00:27:54,305
No offense meant.

450
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,863
It's just...

451
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:27,038
You really
don't get lonely?

452
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:30,338
I... I don't get lonely?

453
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,977
Yeah. I mean not like in life.
Like here, at work.

454
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,048
Do you get lonely
in here?

455
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:39,384
No. I...

456
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,818
When I meet somebody,
you know,

457
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,823
when they or their family
brings me in to begin the work,

458
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:49,392
I am the grim reaper.

459
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,459
Do you understand?

460
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:53,362
I'm the last new person

461
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:57,165
someone forms a meaningful
relationship with before they die.

462
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:00,838
That's if, obviously, they
bring me in before they die.

463
00:29:02,172 --> 00:29:04,006
In any event, it's...

464
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:07,375
It's the children that
make my life miserable.

465
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:10,711
You understand? Like
Gwen, my sister-in-law.

466
00:29:10,713 --> 00:29:13,849
She verges on this.
She's...

467
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:16,719
She's duplicitous.
She's a liar.

468
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,787
And I don't believe anything
that comes out of her mouth.

469
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:20,892
Huh.

470
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:25,693
What did you think of her?

471
00:29:25,695 --> 00:29:29,931
Well, I don't know. I don't know.
I just met her that one time.

472
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:31,632
Yeah, well,

473
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:34,103
she's a real nuisance
to myself and Alyssa.

474
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,738
Actually, we've been
longing for a day

475
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,941
where she's less of a presence
in our lives. It's like...

476
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:42,111
She carries on this
judgment of Timothy that

477
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,078
Alyssa's been trying
to get away from for years

478
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,151
and now it just like carries
on in this new face.

479
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,086
Never mind.

480
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:55,891
It doesn't matter because
I have no opinion on it.

481
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:57,926
No, not at all.

482
00:29:57,928 --> 00:29:59,564
Yeah, um...

483
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,134
- Let me get back to work.
- Mmm-hmm.

484
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:09,072
These are...

485
00:30:42,105 --> 00:30:44,039
- Don't do that.
- Easy, man.

486
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:46,208
I thought you heard me
coming in.

487
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,010
Hello. I didn't know anyone
was going to be here.

488
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:51,947
Yeah, Greg, this is Naomi. She
just started working with me.

489
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:53,347
Nice to meet you.

490
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:55,917
- That is a beautiful accent.
- Thanks.

491
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,586
Let me guess
where it's from.

492
00:30:58,588 --> 00:30:59,787
New Zealand?

493
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:02,024
- Uh, Australia, actually.
- Argh.

494
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,994
I've never been. I'm thinking of going.
Should I go?

495
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,928
Yeah, sure,
if you want to.

496
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,197
How's the surfing? We've always
wanted to learn to surf.

497
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,833
Um...

498
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,601
I don't know,
it's not really my thing.

499
00:31:12,603 --> 00:31:14,969
But I hear it's lovely,
apparently.

500
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:17,672
Greg, what are you
doing here?

501
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:19,674
Ah, just passing by.

502
00:31:19,676 --> 00:31:21,543
Everything's all set
for tonight.

503
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:22,614
What's tonight?

504
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:24,645
Oh...

505
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:26,248
Today's my birthday.

506
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,915
What? Happy birthday.

507
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,718
Yeah, it's not a big deal.

508
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,886
Oh, he's wrong.
It's a huge deal.

509
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:34,757
We're throwing
a little celebration.

510
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:39,661
- You're invited.
- No, she's not invited, Greg.

511
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:42,363
I thought you said it was a
night with the fellas tonight?

512
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:45,167
Yeah, and what better way of
celebrating with the fellas

513
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,102
than having
a beautiful woman?

514
00:31:47,104 --> 00:31:49,939
- Even the Rat Pack had Shirley MacLaine.
- Don't say "Rat Pack."

515
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,908
I just, I don't understand
why you're here.

516
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,009
I can see you're not excited
about tonight.

517
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:57,078
No, I'm excited about tonight. I'm
just, obviously, I'm working...

518
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,546
Try to do something nice
for your buddy...

519
00:31:58,548 --> 00:32:01,019
Don't be a sissy, man, okay?
Just... We're at work!

520
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:05,723
Bye.

521
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:16,664
I'm sorry. My friends just can
be kind of irritating sometimes.

522
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,267
No, he seemed great.

523
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,436
Yeah, well...

524
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,738
You haven't been in New York long
enough if you think Greg is great.

525
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,373
He's your friend,
though, right?

526
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:28,309
Yeah, he's my friend.

527
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:33,081
I'm sorry. I'm not doing a good job
explaining what's going on right now.

528
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:34,650
No, no.
I think I understand.

529
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:37,188
This is your space.

530
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:39,324
Exactly.

531
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,422
Yeah.

532
00:32:41,424 --> 00:32:44,558
So, um, will Gwen
and Alyssa go tonight?

533
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,764
No, no, no,
it's a night with the fellas.

534
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:52,234
It's just gonna be a bunch of dads.
It's not going to be exciting.

535
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,937
Greg is the only one who
expects it or wants it to be.

536
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,371
Hmm.

537
00:32:56,373 --> 00:32:58,643
Why don't you
and Alyssa have kids?

538
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:02,311
Sorry.

539
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,612
That's not an appropriate question.
It's none of my business.

540
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,581
It's a common question.

541
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:09,418
And once you turn 40, you'll
get asked it every few weeks.

542
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,751
I mean, unless
you have kids already

543
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:13,490
and then they'll ask you
some other question.

544
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:16,694
Look, I'm sorry, if...

545
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,928
If you want to come tonight,
of course you can come.

546
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,564
It just really is
just gonna be a bunch of dads

547
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:25,468
and a couple of assholes in
the form of Greg and myself.

548
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,836
Well, I don't know
about that but, um,

549
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:30,939
I mean, if I'm going to be
the only...

550
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:33,275
Like if Alyssa's
not even coming,

551
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:36,413
then I don't think it would be
very decent of me to show up.

552
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:55,029
Do you know if Sam sent
him anything for his birthday?

553
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:57,932
He said he didn't want
to do anything.

554
00:33:57,934 --> 00:34:00,768
Now somehow he has this
night out with the guys?

555
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,805
I wasn't invited.

556
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:08,142
We'll do something later
over the weekend, maybe.

557
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:11,646
We've never really been into
that kind of thing anyway.

558
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:13,849
Ten years ago, we would have
forced some sort of effort.

559
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,318
A weekend trip?

560
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,389
I don't quite recall
when we stopped bothering.

561
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,360
Funny, it just happens.

562
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,863
How are things going
with Nick and Dad's stuff?

563
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:30,902
He doesn't talk about it?

564
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:33,637
Good.

565
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:35,938
I guess.

566
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,374
But you know, I thought we
should have hired someone else.

567
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:42,744
I just... I mean it would have
been cleaner outside the family.

568
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:44,449
But he's doing fine.

569
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,420
He must talk
about it sometimes.

570
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,722
Everything's moving.

571
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:58,061
He's had offers for a job
or two once this wraps.

572
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,731
I think we decided not to

573
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:06,068
blabber on over

574
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:11,440
endless nonsense regarding what
is, might, or could be going on.

575
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:16,744
You lose the ability to feign interest
in those things after a decade or so.

576
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:18,280
I think I appreciate
his restraint.

577
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,784
I hope he does mine.

578
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,990
Happy birthday to Nick.

579
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:33,561
There are
irrelevant tasks

580
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:36,097
and I'm okay with a mild
amount of tedious tasks,

581
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,934
but birthday shopping
for in-laws

582
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,135
should cross the line,
right?

583
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:43,473
I wouldn't know.
Maybe, yes?

584
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,742
I should give notice.

585
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,646
I will give notice.

586
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:52,113
Cut-your-losses situation.

587
00:35:52,115 --> 00:35:54,650
I should cut my losses.

588
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:59,490
I wanted to be upward. Instead I
am a glorified personal assistant.

589
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:03,992
I look at women like her,

590
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:07,929
we do, our age does,
and what should we see?

591
00:36:07,931 --> 00:36:11,300
Aspirational ideals.

592
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,604
Examples of a lifestyle that

593
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,637
you believe in.

594
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,009
So she is

595
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,175
unmarried.

596
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:21,275
That's great, right?

597
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:22,679
And you

598
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,445
are married.

599
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:27,851
Also great, right?

600
00:36:29,152 --> 00:36:32,420
I don't want to feel
adrift in some

601
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:34,789
nebulous middle ground.

602
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:36,557
Where am I?

603
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,429
Okay? So...

604
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:40,898
Where am I?

605
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:42,833
Not

606
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:47,938
early-30s, not 40s, just

607
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,878
wasteland in the middle.

608
00:36:57,813 --> 00:37:00,951
Heavy-handed and dramatic,
minus five points.

609
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:07,054
What a delight it must be to
function as my sole outlet

610
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:09,858
for a never-ending barrage
of introspective blather

611
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,726
regarding the choices
that I've made.

612
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:14,764
I didn't know I had a choice.
Do I have a choice?

613
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:22,773
I should go.

614
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:25,340
When is Buddy coming back?

615
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:27,508
Stay. He's gonna
be gone a little while.

616
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,309
Where is he?

617
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:31,079
Um...

618
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:34,081
A friend
of a friend's birthday?

619
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,717
I don't know.
He was scant on the details.

620
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,456
You sure he's not out
with what's-her-face?

621
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:44,358
Why would you say that?

622
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,095
All right, so I show up
at the kid's office here.

623
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:49,764
First of all, he reacts
like an asshole.

624
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:52,400
Second of all, he's acting like
I'm interrupting his nap time.

625
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:55,103
- I did not reach like an asshole.
- "React." "React."

626
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:56,771
Does anybody like
being startled at work?

627
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:58,238
I have headphones on!

628
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,075
So he is employing now
this very beautiful,

629
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:03,445
young, ripe, delicious...

630
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,579
This is a human being
we are talking about, okay?

631
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:07,115
Whatever.
Where is she from again?

632
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:09,050
- She's from Australia.
- She's this Australian girl.

633
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:10,851
So he has this little
Australian girl,

634
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:12,387
she looks like
a trapped princess,

635
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:14,423
and he looks like
a fucking ogre!

636
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,525
That's an absurd exaggeration
of what was going on.

637
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:18,959
Look, I got her number
all figured out.

638
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:20,961
- Yo, Jessie, shots.
- She's the young type.

639
00:38:20,963 --> 00:38:24,599
She's the poisonous girl who exudes
sweetness, but she's dangerous.

640
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:26,400
She's like a fang
dripping with honey.

641
00:38:26,402 --> 00:38:29,204
She's the death trap
to losers.

642
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,572
- Like us.
- Dude, speak for yourself.

643
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,307
You can lie to yourself
all you want.

644
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,608
You put this girl in a room
with any man

645
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,110
only one thing
that's gonna happen.

646
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:39,648
Yeah, work, research
and a proper database.

647
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,682
And we're building
a chronology for...

648
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:42,916
Wrong again!

649
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:45,253
- Here we go.
- I hate them.

650
00:38:45,255 --> 00:38:46,820
Dude, you gotta see
my new piece.

651
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:48,690
She's got the most
luscious cooter.

652
00:38:48,692 --> 00:38:50,825
And Nick, of course,

653
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:55,597
has never lost a battle of the
wills in circumstances like these.

654
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,800
Treacherous,
marriage-destroying...

655
00:38:59,802 --> 00:39:01,936
- Happy birthday, Nicky boy.
- Yes, we get it.

656
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:04,338
You guys are lousy friends and
this is not a fun birthday.

657
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,508
- That's not fair.
- Oh, shit, that's Buddy!

658
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,543
Dude, I invited a couple dudes over here.
Hope that's okay.

659
00:39:08,545 --> 00:39:11,311
Buddy, get in here, you!

660
00:39:11,313 --> 00:39:12,813
So these are the guys.

661
00:39:12,815 --> 00:39:14,416
- You got Jake here...
- I'm Buddy.

662
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:15,918
Nicky boy,
turn around.

663
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,019
This is my friend, Buddy.
Buddy, Nick. Nick, Buddy.

664
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:19,521
- Buddy?
- It's short for "Arthur."

665
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,856
- Like the movie.
- How does that work?

666
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,356
It doesn't.
It's just always been.

667
00:39:26,762 --> 00:39:28,195
Let me catch you up here.

668
00:39:28,197 --> 00:39:31,365
Nick here has employed
this really beautiful girl.

669
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:35,672
And they work side by side
in a very tiny office. Phew.

670
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:38,840
Any fun?

671
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:41,175
A situation
not to be trusted.

672
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:43,077
Well, I did that once
and I married her.

673
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,579
See? Buddy gets it!

674
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:46,847
I'm not marrying her.
I'm already married.

675
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:49,316
- It's different, I'm sure.
- It's very different.

676
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:51,418
What a power addiction
it is, though. I get it.

677
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,588
Like because you wield
some authority

678
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,389
and you could hire them,

679
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:56,358
you could force them to be
around you all the time.

680
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,092
That's not
why I hired her.

681
00:39:58,094 --> 00:40:00,162
- What's her name?
- I hired her sight unseen, okay?

682
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,162
She sent in her CV and she
was the most qualified...

683
00:40:02,164 --> 00:40:05,233
Gimme a break! You hire
a 25-year-old foreign girl.

684
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:07,202
- Of course she's the most qualified!
- She's foreign?

685
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:08,670
Yeah, you knew exactly
what you were doing.

686
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,572
- Call her.
- No.

687
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,474
- No.
- Call her. Call her.

688
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:13,641
Stop giving me
a shoulder rub...

689
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:15,010
Karen, tell him
to call her, please.

690
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,144
...and stop talking
about calling her.

691
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:17,979
- Look...
- I ask for nothing.

692
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,981
- Please.
- I'm not calling her! No.

693
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:22,316
All I want is a call.
Do I ask for anything?

694
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:25,019
- I ask for so little.
- Greg loves to talk on the phone.

695
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:26,420
Just a little talk
on the phone.

696
00:40:26,422 --> 00:40:27,588
Come on, Buddy, tell him.

697
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,923
Don't look at me.
I'm a married man.

698
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:30,391
Yeah, me too.

699
00:40:30,393 --> 00:40:32,427
Oh, come on, Buddy,
you've been a bad boy!

700
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:33,827
The past is the past.

701
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:35,362
The past is the past.

702
00:40:35,364 --> 00:40:36,597
Bad Buddy.

703
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,566
Are you serious?

704
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:40,367
Am I the only guy here that
could still fuck a 20-year-old?

705
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:42,103
Those days
are behind me.

706
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:43,804
Yeah, and me as well.

707
00:40:43,806 --> 00:40:45,975
- The past is the past.
- Yes, thank you.

708
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:49,776
It's a rotten sign
of maturity right here.

709
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:51,481
Happy birthday, Nick.

710
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:45,135
<i>Hello?</i>

711
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:47,538
Uh, it's Nick here.

712
00:41:48,538 --> 00:41:50,804
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

713
00:41:50,806 --> 00:41:53,141
Today's my birthday.

714
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,813
Come down and wish me
a happy birthday.

715
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:16,366
- Hi.
- Hi.

716
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:18,633
Um...

717
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:20,001
Can I come in?

718
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:22,573
- Let me in.
- Yeah. All right, sure.

719
00:42:35,818 --> 00:42:37,253
One second.

720
00:42:43,492 --> 00:42:45,360
Today's my birthday.

721
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:46,628
Yeah, I know.

722
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,631
Um...

723
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:54,668
You know, actually, I don't really
think that you should be here.

724
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,604
That's silly.

725
00:42:56,606 --> 00:42:58,673
You just made
the decision to let me in

726
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:00,575
- a minute ago.
- I did.

727
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:04,381
Yeah, but I've changed my mind,
and I think you should go.

728
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:12,052
Um, because, you know, we still
have weeks of work to do together

729
00:43:12,054 --> 00:43:14,521
and I feel kind of...

730
00:43:14,523 --> 00:43:16,426
And I mean, you live...

731
00:43:18,027 --> 00:43:19,360
Um...

732
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:22,697
You live, like,
just around the corner

733
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:24,902
with your wife, as you know.

734
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,202
Yeah.

735
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,336
I mean,

736
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:31,273
what if that
was all different?

737
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,708
You know,
I could fire you.

738
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,376
- We'd just be people.
- Yeah.

739
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:37,177
You could fire me. Um...

740
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:41,749
But then I would lose my visa
and I would have to go home.

741
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:43,050
That's not good.

742
00:43:43,052 --> 00:43:44,584
Can't have that, so

743
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:46,119
you're unfired.

744
00:43:46,121 --> 00:43:47,390
Great.

745
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:54,364
You know, this is just really not a
path that I want to go down again.

746
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,635
Naomi, it's not a...

747
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:00,300
Naomi.

748
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:02,637
<i>♪ Naomi</i>

749
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,807
<i>♪ You came and you gave
without taking</i>

750
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:11,246
<i>♪ But I sent you away, Naomi</i>

751
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:15,583
<i>♪ You kissed me
and stopped me from shaking</i>

752
00:44:15,585 --> 00:44:18,787
<i>♪ And I need you today,
Naomi ♪</i>

753
00:44:22,057 --> 00:44:23,494
This is silly.

754
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:44,412
So Greg
brought some people.

755
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:48,816
A couple of guys I don't know, but
it was definitely no big deal.

756
00:44:48,818 --> 00:44:52,088
No one's gonna tell
any stories about tonight.

757
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,559
That's nice.

758
00:45:00,295 --> 00:45:01,564
Okay.

759
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,312
Sorry I'm late.

760
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,746
I did a little drinking
last night.

761
00:47:32,748 --> 00:47:34,815
Everything's slow today,

762
00:47:34,817 --> 00:47:37,818
including my acceptance of
sudden surprise invitations.

763
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,487
My boss is hungover
as well.

764
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:42,155
Hungover boss,
very pathetic.

765
00:47:42,157 --> 00:47:43,490
How old is this guy?

766
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:44,925
Early 40s.

767
00:47:44,927 --> 00:47:46,793
Hell, no.

768
00:47:46,795 --> 00:47:49,831
That is a sad age to still
be incapable of moderation.

769
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:53,434
Oh, really, you've licked that
problem already, have you?

770
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:55,537
There's a phrase you don't
hear very much anymore.

771
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,671
Yes, I have licked
that problem.

772
00:47:57,673 --> 00:48:00,907
I may be slow,
but I'm functional today.

773
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:02,809
It is Wednesday
after all, right?

774
00:48:02,811 --> 00:48:07,382
Well, thank you for showing
up, whatever the reasons.

775
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:11,151
It's not like I have many other
people clamoring for my company.

776
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:13,354
I wouldn't say
I'm clamoring.

777
00:48:13,356 --> 00:48:14,791
Clam... Clamoring.

778
00:48:17,492 --> 00:48:19,128
Does your wife clamor?

779
00:48:21,597 --> 00:48:23,200
- She does not clamor.
- Mmm.

780
00:48:26,936 --> 00:48:30,440
If you guys work together, how did you...
How did you slip away?

781
00:48:31,373 --> 00:48:33,007
Who says I slipped away?

782
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,242
Well, where does she think
you're eating lunch?

783
00:48:35,244 --> 00:48:39,713
I mean, I assume you guys usually try
to make an effort to eat together.

784
00:48:39,715 --> 00:48:42,816
Mmm-hmm. We do, but,

785
00:48:42,818 --> 00:48:45,220
I am supposed to meet somebody
in the area later.

786
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,420
Got it.

787
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:47,921
So, maybe I got
a little loose

788
00:48:47,923 --> 00:48:49,257
- with the times.
- Mmm-hmm.

789
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,992
- Is that a crime?
- No.

790
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,260
You gonna put me
under citizen's arrest?

791
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,362
No, no.

792
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,597
Um, I am getting together
later with some guys

793
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:58,032
if you'd like to come.

794
00:48:58,034 --> 00:48:59,900
I don't know how much else
you have going on yet.

795
00:48:59,902 --> 00:49:03,306
Nothing. Not very much
of anything.

796
00:49:04,072 --> 00:49:05,472
Maybe.

797
00:49:05,474 --> 00:49:08,344
- Just guys?
- It's hard to say. Probably.

798
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,416
- Well, I'll think about it.
- Okay.

799
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:26,854
Sorry. Thing ran long.

800
00:50:26,856 --> 00:50:28,356
- Hi. I'm Buddy.
- Kevin.

801
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,789
Have you met Jess?

802
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,793
We had the chance to talk
for about half an hour

803
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,628
until our meeting began
and you finally showed up.

804
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,362
As I said,
the thing ran long.

805
00:50:35,364 --> 00:50:37,298
What "thing"?

806
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,934
The thing, the lunch thing with the
guy that I was telling you about.

807
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,869
What can we do
for you, Kevin?

808
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:44,771
Uh, Kevin is going to make
a record here.

809
00:50:44,773 --> 00:50:47,340
That's wonderful. When?
How big are you guys?

810
00:50:47,342 --> 00:50:49,144
I mean how many are you,
not how famous are you.

811
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,711
Although maybe
that matters, too.

812
00:50:50,713 --> 00:50:52,981
We actually worked it all out.
And, um...

813
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,383
Well, Kevin was
just about to leave.

814
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,853
But we're done, and I
handled it on my own.

815
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,119
Oh, of course you did.

816
00:51:00,121 --> 00:51:02,856
Well, great to meet you,
Kevin, and

817
00:51:02,858 --> 00:51:05,562
can't wait to start work.
See you around.

818
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:40,860
I'm really sorry
about the short notice.

819
00:51:40,862 --> 00:51:43,396
I'm just not feeling well
at all today.

820
00:51:43,398 --> 00:51:44,731
Oh, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

821
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:45,999
I'll comp you next week.

822
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:47,668
End of this week.

823
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,670
End of this week, right. I don't
know where my head is at.

824
00:51:50,672 --> 00:51:54,208
It's really not a big deal.
Stop apologizing.

825
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,376
It's going around, a bug in the family.
My husband has it,

826
00:51:56,378 --> 00:51:58,010
my sister has it,
now I have it.

827
00:51:58,012 --> 00:52:00,046
It's really okay.

828
00:52:00,048 --> 00:52:01,349
I know it's unprofessional. I
shouldn't be going on like this.

829
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,086
I'm sorry. I apologize.

830
00:52:37,086 --> 00:52:38,855
<i>So what's the fear?</i>

831
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,592
<i>I want to see</i>

832
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:49,764
<i>contrasts between myself
and somebody</i>

833
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,932
<i>fifteen years my senior</i>

834
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:56,338
<i>and there are shockingly few.</i>

835
00:52:58,173 --> 00:53:02,776
I spend all day interloping

836
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:07,016
with this family, and with your
family, and when I get home

837
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:10,987
all I can ask myself is,

838
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:14,191
"What's the holdup?"

839
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,496
It's a familiar feeling,
sadly.

840
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,563
Why don't I have
that which makes

841
00:53:23,565 --> 00:53:26,700
somebody else as

842
00:53:26,702 --> 00:53:29,739
happy and fulfilled
as can be?

843
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:36,209
All of Buddy's friends
are married.

844
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:38,679
None of mine are.
Including you.

845
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:39,880
Downgraded from sister.

846
00:53:39,882 --> 00:53:42,016
My point is
you aren't in some

847
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:44,985
isolated state
of arrested maturity.

848
00:53:44,987 --> 00:53:47,954
Just because you spend
most of your time

849
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:50,391
with a woman in her 40s

850
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,360
doesn't mean
that you are, too.

851
00:53:53,362 --> 00:53:55,530
Let me give you
an example.

852
00:53:55,532 --> 00:54:01,068
So Bud's hung around with this
daughter of his mom's friend.

853
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:04,671
It's a highly tenuous
connection, right?

854
00:54:04,673 --> 00:54:07,509
They met once, 20 years ago.

855
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:11,179
And this girl, he says,

856
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,246
younger than you,

857
00:54:13,248 --> 00:54:15,749
is totally alone.

858
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:17,517
She's here
for several months

859
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:22,088
and she has no meaningful
relationships at all.

860
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:26,829
But see, I look at that
as a freeing situation.

861
00:54:28,731 --> 00:54:29,733
Young.

862
00:54:30,365 --> 00:54:31,634
Travel.

863
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:36,272
You see a version
of that as desperate.

864
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,476
Alone.

865
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,677
Subjectivity.

866
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:45,481
The grass might be greener.

867
00:54:46,382 --> 00:54:48,081
The grass is dead

868
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:50,719
and covered with salt.

869
00:54:51,753 --> 00:54:53,989
Okay. Um...

870
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,856
Well,

871
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:57,925
worst-case scenario,

872
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,626
five years. Go.

873
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,606
It's nothing. I don't have one.

874
00:55:12,474 --> 00:55:14,978
I shouldn't have
kept you so late.

875
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:42,028
We need to tighten
the noose on Nick.

876
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:43,530
Don't you think he should
be more productive

877
00:56:43,532 --> 00:56:44,699
now that we hired
an assistant?

878
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,066
He should be more productive.

879
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:47,700
Have you tried calling him?

880
00:56:47,702 --> 00:56:49,235
Try calling him again.

881
00:56:49,237 --> 00:56:52,305
First, nobody picked up,
and when I called back,

882
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:54,008
his assistant picked up, she
said he was running behind.

883
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,976
She didn't say why.

884
00:56:55,978 --> 00:56:58,679
That seems
inexcusable to me.

885
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,148
Doesn't it? I mean,

886
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,648
it's not like his job
is so hard

887
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:06,052
or, God forbid, he has to
travel that far to do it.

888
00:57:06,054 --> 00:57:08,054
Do we have to hold his hand
through everything?

889
00:57:08,056 --> 00:57:09,091
Try calling him again.

890
00:57:28,443 --> 00:57:31,278
Oh, Nick? Hey, it's Sam.

891
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,780
I am good. How are you?

892
00:57:33,782 --> 00:57:35,316
Yeah. I'm just...

893
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:37,818
No, I'm just checking
to make sure you're in.

894
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:41,088
I think we wanted to stop by
today and check on things.

895
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,827
Is there a time
that would work best?

896
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:46,295
Yes, now,

897
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:49,496
now should work great.

898
00:57:49,498 --> 00:57:51,097
We'll be by shortly.

899
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:52,199
Okay.

900
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:54,401
Okay. Okay.

901
00:57:54,403 --> 00:57:57,474
I mean,
how hard can it be?

902
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,941
You have siblings,
right, Sam?

903
00:58:01,943 --> 00:58:04,644
I have a sister
and two brothers.

904
00:58:04,646 --> 00:58:07,648
Would you put up with any of
this bullshit on behalf of them,

905
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,883
or not them specifically,
but their spouses?

906
00:58:09,885 --> 00:58:11,150
Wait, are they married?

907
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:12,720
Yeah, everyone except
my youngest brother.

908
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,824
So you understand me,
right?

909
00:58:15,657 --> 00:58:17,124
I think so.

910
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:18,726
With me and my sister,
it's different...

911
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,894
Why do we have bonds
to siblings?

912
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:24,865
What does a brother or
sister-in-law mean to me anyway?

913
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:27,534
My father liked Nick.

914
00:58:27,536 --> 00:58:29,503
I think he would have
approved of my hiring him.

915
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:32,206
He always said he wanted him
to be involved in his

916
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:35,876
appraisals, what have you,
his materials,

917
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:39,278
but I think that's because he thought
he'd be around to do it with him.

918
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,882
I'm sure if he knew I had to
deal with it all by myself

919
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:45,720
he'd want me
to choose the person.

920
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:48,825
I'm sorry, did you... Did
you want to say something?

921
00:58:51,726 --> 00:58:53,161
No.

922
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:56,499
No, it's not important.

923
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:03,572
Nick.

924
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:06,440
I've been thinking.

925
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,775
July would've been
Dad's 85th birthday.

926
00:59:08,777 --> 00:59:11,845
I think that's a reasonable time
to have this all wrapped up, no?

927
00:59:11,847 --> 00:59:13,514
July?

928
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:17,117
- I'd said September...
- I know we said something else.

929
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,454
But to be clear, you want to
move on to other projects.

930
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:22,188
This isn't holding
your attention.

931
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:27,894
My only options as executor would
be to bring someone new in

932
00:59:27,896 --> 00:59:31,065
and start over, or just
encourage you to push through.

933
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:34,267
This is, after all,
why we hired her.

934
00:59:34,269 --> 00:59:38,873
Yeah, but I can't work miracles.
Naomi's a huge help

935
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:42,041
but we're talking
about a raise, obviously.

936
00:59:42,043 --> 00:59:44,610
- A raise?
- Yeah, a raise. I mean, we have...

937
00:59:44,612 --> 00:59:46,380
The sooner you finish,

938
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:49,282
the sooner you can move on
to other jobs.

939
00:59:49,284 --> 00:59:50,717
Work with Sam

940
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:52,284
if you want to.

941
00:59:52,286 --> 00:59:56,155
I can loan her as needed
to help expedite things.

942
00:59:56,157 --> 00:59:59,925
How about taking it
for a spin right now?

943
00:59:59,927 --> 01:00:02,195
I have a thing,

944
01:00:02,197 --> 01:00:06,235
but, Sam, you don't need to be there,
so maybe just stay here and, uh...

945
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:09,936
And get a feel for things.

946
01:00:09,938 --> 01:00:13,039
Nick, two beautiful ladies,
enough motivation

947
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:16,709
for you to quit being a wimp
and power through?

948
01:00:16,711 --> 01:00:18,278
I don't know
if I can...

949
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,280
You'll be fine.

950
01:00:20,282 --> 01:00:22,782
Make Sam feel welcome
and part of the team.

951
01:00:22,784 --> 01:00:23,786
And, Nick...

952
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,086
I don't know what to say.

953
01:00:31,393 --> 01:00:33,726
Widows and daughters.
What did I tell you?

954
01:00:33,728 --> 01:00:35,561
I don't know if I really want
to get involved.

955
01:00:35,563 --> 01:00:37,563
Oh, don't worry about her.

956
01:00:37,565 --> 01:00:41,635
I can't imagine
dealing with Gwen full-time.

957
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:42,836
How long you been working
with her?

958
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:44,606
Almost two years.

959
01:00:46,641 --> 01:00:48,710
This poor child.

960
01:00:52,847 --> 01:00:55,449
- What does she say about me?
- Maybe we should get to work.

961
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:57,450
No, we will. Forget her.

962
01:00:57,452 --> 01:01:00,052
Yeah, I don't know,
just this gossip,

963
01:01:00,054 --> 01:01:03,090
you know? Talking about someone
as soon as they leave the room

964
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:04,391
kind of makes me feel ill.

965
01:01:04,393 --> 01:01:05,659
I don't really go for it,
either.

966
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:08,929
This is unheard of.

967
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:11,932
Two ladies refuse to gossip with
a man in the prime of his life

968
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:14,437
waiting for
the inside scoop?

969
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:19,440
Two years, huh? That's...

970
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,175
You must hold the record.

971
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,010
You took over
for Deidre, right?

972
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,612
I think her name
was Amanda.

973
01:01:25,614 --> 01:01:27,815
Right, Amanda.

974
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,550
I forgot about her.

975
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:32,686
The turnover in that job
is unfathomable.

976
01:01:32,688 --> 01:01:34,887
- Why does she need an assistant anyway?
- Why do you?

977
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:36,523
No offense.

978
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:39,095
No, none taken, until you
said "no offense."

979
01:01:40,494 --> 01:01:42,695
All right. If I left,

980
01:01:42,697 --> 01:01:45,965
I'm sure you guys
could figure it out.

981
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:48,834
I don't think so. I'm not... I
don't really know exactly...

982
01:01:48,836 --> 01:01:51,137
I don't think I have much
left in me today

983
01:01:51,139 --> 01:01:53,639
so, I'm gonna call
an audible

984
01:01:53,641 --> 01:01:56,577
and I'll just let you bring
Sam up to speed. Okay?

985
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,479
- Great.
- So, could you...

986
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,280
Oh, yeah.

987
01:02:00,282 --> 01:02:02,184
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

988
01:02:04,152 --> 01:02:05,554
Bye.

989
01:02:13,528 --> 01:02:14,831
Okay.

990
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:35,250
<i>I don't know, reading,
exploring, going for walks.</i>

991
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:38,987
<i>So, nothing really. Um...</i>

992
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:43,523
<i>It's kind of lonely,</i>

993
01:02:43,525 --> 01:02:48,427
<i>but I think maybe that's really
good for me right now. Um...</i>

994
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:51,063
<i>I just came out of
a really intense relationship</i>

995
01:02:51,065 --> 01:02:53,601
<i>and I kind of needed a break.</i>

996
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,036
<i>I wanted some time just to</i>

997
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,905
<i>be by myself, you know.</i>

998
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:02,610
<i>I never traveled or anything
when I was at uni and...</i>

999
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,778
<i>You know, I just...</i>

1000
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:08,949
<i>How do I say...
It sounds kind of silly.</i>

1001
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:15,188
<i>I wanted to see how much
and how quickly I could grow</i>

1002
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:17,391
<i>as a person, I suppose.</i>

1003
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:18,461
<i>Um...</i>

1004
01:03:19,728 --> 01:03:22,262
I feel like
the most difficult part

1005
01:03:22,264 --> 01:03:26,766
about being as transient as
I have been for a while is

1006
01:03:26,768 --> 01:03:31,237
just how vulnerable I am
to infatuation, you know?

1007
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:34,307
I go to a new place,
and I want to move there

1008
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:37,443
and then I meet somebody
and I fall in love with him,

1009
01:03:37,445 --> 01:03:40,514
and, you know, I want to be
with him all the time, and...

1010
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,115
Then a week passes

1011
01:03:42,117 --> 01:03:45,751
and then two weeks pass,
and then

1012
01:03:45,753 --> 01:03:48,324
I just want to leave,
you know.

1013
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:53,327
Are you there yet, now?

1014
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,762
"There yet, now."

1015
01:03:55,764 --> 01:03:57,863
No, I'm not.

1016
01:03:57,865 --> 01:04:00,534
I mean, if only,
you know,

1017
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,969
because this is all so boring.

1018
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:05,940
There's not really anything
to fixate on, you know.

1019
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:09,108
And I say that
as a very positive thing.

1020
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,177
This family
is fucked up.

1021
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:13,914
Take it from me,
do not fixate.

1022
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,450
Yeah, I don't know.

1023
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:19,853
I kind of like Nick.
I know he's a bit sad.

1024
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:23,090
I really like Gwen.

1025
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:25,592
Get to know them better.

1026
01:04:25,594 --> 01:04:28,262
Let the luster fade.

1027
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:31,197
Well, we're sitting
in a basement office

1028
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:33,333
surrounded by piles
of documents.

1029
01:04:33,335 --> 01:04:36,438
I'm not really sure
to which luster you refer.

1030
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,077
It's hard to

1031
01:04:42,744 --> 01:04:46,146
articulate this
competitive nonsense,

1032
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:48,481
the

1033
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:54,019
unwilling resentment we apparently
feel without warning, for our family.

1034
01:04:54,021 --> 01:04:56,523
You see it between Gwen
and Alyssa.

1035
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,557
It's the same

1036
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,659
for me and my sister.

1037
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:01,797
Love,

1038
01:05:02,998 --> 01:05:04,664
jealousy

1039
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:06,699
and deficiency,

1040
01:05:06,701 --> 01:05:10,403
all wrapped up in
a genetically-bonded inability

1041
01:05:10,405 --> 01:05:13,005
to ever express the concurrent

1042
01:05:13,007 --> 01:05:15,575
- depth of these feelings.
- Hmm.

1043
01:05:15,577 --> 01:05:19,845
What a mess a dynamic
like this can be.

1044
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:21,815
Between strangers, you, me,
Nick, Gwen, or whatever,

1045
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:24,583
it should be cleaner.
Maybe it is.

1046
01:05:24,585 --> 01:05:26,021
My problem

1047
01:05:27,222 --> 01:05:28,457
is that

1048
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:34,594
personal dynamics
ebb and flow.

1049
01:05:34,596 --> 01:05:39,432
Most of them have an endpoint that
we are never not moving towards, but

1050
01:05:39,434 --> 01:05:41,735
- it's not so with family.
- Hmm.

1051
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,771
There is no destination and

1052
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:48,176
no hope for a clean getaway.

1053
01:05:50,478 --> 01:05:56,383
You aspire for your time here to
end well, to leave head held high,

1054
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:59,119
a trail of positivity
behind you.

1055
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,822
I'll leave Gwen someday
and hope for the same.

1056
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,224
Out on a high note.

1057
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,295
A perfect final moment.

1058
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:13,970
Family doesn't afford that endless
optimism for a happy ending.

1059
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,405
I had to get
out of the house.

1060
01:06:19,407 --> 01:06:21,575
I know it's short notice,
possibly weird,

1061
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:23,145
I hope that you don't
read anything into it.

1062
01:06:24,646 --> 01:06:26,045
If you couldn't make it,

1063
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:27,646
I'd probably just be
sitting here alone anyway.

1064
01:06:27,648 --> 01:06:29,550
No offense.

1065
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:31,651
Why does everybody keep
saying that to me today?

1066
01:06:31,653 --> 01:06:32,885
Saying what?

1067
01:06:32,887 --> 01:06:34,954
Do I seem
extra offended today?

1068
01:06:34,956 --> 01:06:37,389
You must be finding yourself
in apologetic company.

1069
01:06:37,391 --> 01:06:38,891
Well, don't apologize.

1070
01:06:38,893 --> 01:06:40,128
Sorry.

1071
01:06:40,795 --> 01:06:43,028
My mum was

1072
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:46,266
very happy about the fact that
we caught up the first time.

1073
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:49,635
I think it maybe makes her
feel like I'm less far away

1074
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:51,871
or something,
like she has some slight

1075
01:06:51,873 --> 01:06:54,542
ancient connection
to your family.

1076
01:06:55,376 --> 01:06:57,010
I don't know.

1077
01:06:57,012 --> 01:06:59,679
It'll make her day
when I call her tomorrow,

1078
01:06:59,681 --> 01:07:01,349
which it already is
in Melbourne.

1079
01:07:03,684 --> 01:07:06,087
So where's
the wife tonight?

1080
01:07:07,121 --> 01:07:08,723
With the sister.

1081
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,157
That guy over by the bar
is checking you out.

1082
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:13,827
Don't look.

1083
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:16,463
Give it a second,
then a quick glance.

1084
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,298
Are you ready?
One, two, three,

1085
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,302
now look.

1086
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:24,304
What should I do?

1087
01:07:27,442 --> 01:07:28,744
I'll play wingman.

1088
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,644
- Let's get you laid.
- Oh, goodness.

1089
01:07:32,646 --> 01:07:35,483
I didn't know we were allowed to
talk to each other like that.

1090
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:39,885
Hey, man.

1091
01:07:39,887 --> 01:07:42,155
- What's your name?
- Uh, Peter.

1092
01:07:42,157 --> 01:07:46,827
Peter, this is sister-in-law,
Naomi, visiting from Australia.

1093
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,595
G'day, Naomi.

1094
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:49,929
G'day, Peter.

1095
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:41,781
It's just about lunchtime
in Australia right now so

1096
01:08:41,783 --> 01:08:45,552
I will call my mum
as soon as I get home

1097
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:49,254
and let her know that I saw you
again and she will be thrilled.

1098
01:08:49,256 --> 01:08:50,757
Positively thrilled.

1099
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:51,793
That's great.

1100
01:08:54,796 --> 01:08:56,998
I love the way
it smells here.

1101
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:04,803
I've never really experienced
springtime like this.

1102
01:09:04,805 --> 01:09:08,508
You know, in Australia,
the trees bloom in September.

1103
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:11,046
- Hmm.
- It's the other way around.

1104
01:09:14,115 --> 01:09:17,586
I've fallen in love on so
many nights like tonight.

1105
01:09:22,289 --> 01:09:23,924
Um...

1106
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:27,293
I need to get home.
And so do you.

1107
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:28,463
Okay.

1108
01:10:23,685 --> 01:10:25,550
Actually, everything
at work is great.

1109
01:10:25,552 --> 01:10:27,786
Clients, problems, money...

1110
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:30,156
You're forgetting
I can read your mind.

1111
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:31,326
Cut the shit.

1112
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:35,195
It's nothing, there's nothing.

1113
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:39,833
If we're not going to talk about
anything, why'd you ask to come over?

1114
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,169
I just wanted to be
in your house, I think,

1115
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:45,074
someplace devoted
to one person's life.

1116
01:10:48,176 --> 01:10:51,343
I remember feeling so sad,

1117
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:56,349
so sad that Dad had to
live alone after Mom died.

1118
01:10:56,351 --> 01:10:58,351
It would have been ridiculous
for him to live any other way.

1119
01:10:58,353 --> 01:11:00,519
He wasn't going to have roommates and
we weren't going to live with him.

1120
01:11:00,521 --> 01:11:03,022
He was capable
and independent.

1121
01:11:03,024 --> 01:11:07,027
Every time I saw him, I knew that he was
going back to that big, empty house

1122
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:09,595
and be bouncing around in
there completely by himself

1123
01:11:09,597 --> 01:11:11,399
and it destroyed me.

1124
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:18,437
He never showed
any signs of

1125
01:11:18,439 --> 01:11:21,710
ever feeling anything
but fully satisfied.

1126
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:26,914
He was a truly content
and happy man.

1127
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:32,952
Maybe it's just that Mom seemed
to leave no void, is my issue.

1128
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:38,424
Either way, I come over
here and I admire you.

1129
01:11:38,426 --> 01:11:43,728
Excuse me if half of my old
problems have transferred onto you.

1130
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:47,400
The last few years with Mom
felt that way.

1131
01:11:47,402 --> 01:11:50,972
Seeing them out
at a dinner or

1132
01:11:52,073 --> 01:11:53,973
an event,

1133
01:11:53,975 --> 01:11:56,679
knowing that they were sleeping
in separate rooms by then.

1134
01:11:57,779 --> 01:11:59,344
They put on that performance,

1135
01:11:59,346 --> 01:12:02,348
not just in public, for us,
as though we were the public

1136
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:06,253
knowing that they'd come
through the door at night

1137
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:09,589
and then they probably wouldn't speak
to each other again until morning.

1138
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:10,793
That

1139
01:12:11,525 --> 01:12:14,363
crushed me. So,

1140
01:12:15,463 --> 01:12:17,095
I felt relief

1141
01:12:17,097 --> 01:12:22,035
in the worst possible way,
when Mom died.

1142
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:26,639
That was devastating in its own way,
but hopefully you understand my point.

1143
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:31,313
It was a relief not to see him living
that isolated existence anymore.

1144
01:12:33,648 --> 01:12:37,853
Now he's just a mountain of boxes
in the basement with Nick.

1145
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:41,189
And he's down there with him.

1146
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:45,592
You know, these feelings
are fleeting.

1147
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:47,663
It's all gonna be forgotten.

1148
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:53,598
Papers, documents, archives,
that's Dad now. And Mom.

1149
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,869
Nick's been showing me
how much Mom is in there.

1150
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,137
It's not just his work.

1151
01:12:58,139 --> 01:13:00,839
It's our mutual life.

1152
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:03,242
It's kind of sweet, actually.

1153
01:13:03,244 --> 01:13:06,979
Of course it refutes your opinion. I
probably won't show you any of it.

1154
01:13:06,981 --> 01:13:08,513
Please don't,
in that case.

1155
01:13:08,515 --> 01:13:12,084
What do you think he does
down there all day?

1156
01:13:12,086 --> 01:13:16,089
Obviously, I know what he does.
The work gets done.

1157
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,156
But I can't seem to shake...

1158
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:20,492
I can't seem to shake it,
though, that

1159
01:13:20,494 --> 01:13:22,327
the two of them,

1160
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:24,330
five feet apart.

1161
01:13:24,332 --> 01:13:27,435
- Nine hours a day.
- Naomi's not the problem.

1162
01:13:29,136 --> 01:13:30,635
Is there a problem?

1163
01:13:30,637 --> 01:13:32,705
If there is a problem,
she isn't the problem.

1164
01:13:32,707 --> 01:13:35,473
She has a good head
on her shoulders.

1165
01:13:35,475 --> 01:13:39,711
How do you know that about her?
You met her once for two hours.

1166
01:13:39,713 --> 01:13:43,851
In two minutes, I could tell.
The other 1:58 confirmed it.

1167
01:13:46,854 --> 01:13:50,156
I can come so close
to believing you, but...

1168
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:52,528
He hurt me in the past and...

1169
01:13:55,095 --> 01:13:58,964
There's no way I can ever give him
the benefit of the doubt ever again.

1170
01:13:58,966 --> 01:14:00,866
I wish he would earn it back,
you know?

1171
01:14:00,868 --> 01:14:04,603
After years of penance, being
a strong, great partner.

1172
01:14:04,605 --> 01:14:05,937
But he hasn't.
I don't know why.

1173
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:08,575
He's a completely
different man now.

1174
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:12,378
He accepts what his life is.

1175
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:15,481
Do you believe he's in a head
space to jeopardize things?

1176
01:14:15,483 --> 01:14:16,782
I never believed it.

1177
01:14:16,784 --> 01:14:20,152
Even when I found out,
I didn't believe it.

1178
01:14:20,154 --> 01:14:23,990
Do you have any evidence that this is
anything more than a nagging hunch?

1179
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:25,223
No, there's nothing.

1180
01:14:25,225 --> 01:14:27,559
I know it's stupid.

1181
01:14:27,561 --> 01:14:29,965
You'd tell me
if there was, right?

1182
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:36,235
Would you tell me if you thought
Naomi was untrustworthy?

1183
01:14:36,237 --> 01:14:41,741
I'd tell you anything, if you asked me.
Would you do the same?

1184
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:45,447
If you asked me what was
going on, I would tell you.

1185
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,146
Hi.

1186
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:22,417
Uh, do you mind
if I go to lunch?

1187
01:15:23,618 --> 01:15:24,753
Why would I?

1188
01:15:28,722 --> 01:15:30,626
Hey, I'm Peter.

1189
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,535
It's not the kids' fault.

1190
01:15:42,537 --> 01:15:44,769
It's just the winter had so
much travel throughout it,

1191
01:15:44,771 --> 01:15:48,309
the time at home just became
sort of this war zone.

1192
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:52,312
It's a matter of balance,
really...

1193
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:54,013
The importance
being placed on that time

1194
01:15:54,015 --> 01:15:55,781
was just so disproportionate

1195
01:15:55,783 --> 01:15:58,351
to the actual
experience of it.

1196
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:01,486
It weighed too heavily
against itself.

1197
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:08,193
...because of all these unspoken
issues that I blamed on work

1198
01:16:08,195 --> 01:16:10,696
and Mel blamed on me.

1199
01:16:10,698 --> 01:16:14,200
And it was really only when
things settled down

1200
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:17,870
that we were able to talk about
it in any reasonable way.

1201
01:16:17,872 --> 01:16:20,371
Well, that makes sense.

1202
01:16:20,373 --> 01:16:25,044
The thing that balances it out, though,
ends up being all about the kids.

1203
01:16:25,046 --> 01:16:27,880
We can only put
our own bullshit aside

1204
01:16:27,882 --> 01:16:31,217
and consider
a reasonable resolution

1205
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:34,189
when what's on the table
is them.

1206
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:38,794
Having that as an anchor
is valuable.

1207
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:22,327
Ever since Naomi started,
I've been feeling nothing but rotten.

1208
01:18:22,329 --> 01:18:27,335
There's no reason to think about
that situation in those, or any terms.

1209
01:18:29,302 --> 01:18:30,471
Hmm.

1210
01:18:32,372 --> 01:18:34,674
You'd tell me
if there was, right?

1211
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:38,680
I mean, you'd say what the thing
was if there was a thing?

1212
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:40,315
I would.

1213
01:18:41,882 --> 01:18:44,616
You haven't been
all that sharp, either.

1214
01:18:44,618 --> 01:18:46,518
Is she not working out?

1215
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,756
She's fine.

1216
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:52,994
Then what is it?

1217
01:18:55,729 --> 01:18:58,032
It's nothing.
I don't know.

1218
01:18:59,466 --> 01:19:01,666
Is this really
something so serious

1219
01:19:01,668 --> 01:19:04,736
or is it just misdirected
from somewhere else?

1220
01:19:04,738 --> 01:19:08,576
I just wanted to mention a feeling.
I wasn't sure why it's so strong.

1221
01:19:10,444 --> 01:19:13,178
I've come to know that
this is what I want.

1222
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:16,848
I don't want anyone else
to be a part of it.

1223
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:20,488
It's important to me and I don't
want anything else to change it.

1224
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:33,432
I'm really glad that you were
able to sneak away again.

1225
01:19:33,434 --> 01:19:36,201
What did you say?

1226
01:19:36,203 --> 01:19:38,736
I said I'm glad that you were
able to get away and see me.

1227
01:19:38,738 --> 01:19:41,072
That's not what you said.
You said "sneak."

1228
01:19:41,074 --> 01:19:43,144
I don't want
to be a sneak.

1229
01:19:44,779 --> 01:19:47,479
Well, is this going
to be an issue or

1230
01:19:47,481 --> 01:19:50,916
can we just relax
and spend time together?

1231
01:19:50,918 --> 01:19:53,952
I think it's time for you
to not contact me.

1232
01:19:53,954 --> 01:19:57,826
It's peculiar and confusing
and also inappropriate.

1233
01:19:58,658 --> 01:19:59,991
How so, and why?

1234
01:19:59,993 --> 01:20:01,427
Where's what's-his-face?

1235
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,593
He took me to lunch.

1236
01:20:02,595 --> 01:20:04,162
Where do I fit in?

1237
01:20:04,164 --> 01:20:06,232
I wanted somebody to
take me out for a cocktail.

1238
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:07,202
If you say so.

1239
01:20:09,136 --> 01:20:11,704
Is this all I get?

1240
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:14,272
To be your evening's entertainment?
I have a wife for that, already.

1241
01:20:14,274 --> 01:20:16,476
But I thought you liked
catching up with me.

1242
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:17,876
Yes, and we've caught up

1243
01:20:17,878 --> 01:20:21,647
and there's nowhere else
to catch now but down.

1244
01:20:21,649 --> 01:20:24,085
You're very cute
when you're angry.

1245
01:20:28,588 --> 01:20:33,925
I'm really glad that we got
to connect for my time here.

1246
01:20:33,927 --> 01:20:35,494
Just trying to do
the right thing.

1247
01:20:35,496 --> 01:20:37,729
By what standards?

1248
01:20:37,731 --> 01:20:39,432
This is a situation
in which

1249
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:43,501
I no longer know how to
make myself comfortable.

1250
01:20:43,503 --> 01:20:46,406
Well, I want to spend
time with you.

1251
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:49,308
I don't see what's so wrong
with that.

1252
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:53,178
And I don't know
anybody else here.

1253
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:57,616
A lot of guys would love
to hear me say that to them.

1254
01:20:57,618 --> 01:20:59,254
I'm not a lot of guys.

1255
01:21:02,256 --> 01:21:04,058
I want you to stay.

1256
01:21:06,961 --> 01:21:08,327
I'm sorry.

1257
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:11,233
I have to walk away.
I hope you understand why.

1258
01:21:31,752 --> 01:21:33,218
You okay?

1259
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:34,355
Yeah.

1260
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:39,858
I missed you.

1261
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:42,930
I'm sorry it took me
so long to come back.

1262
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:22,928
Obviously you know your way around to
take care of things when I'm gone.

1263
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:25,097
At this point, I do.

1264
01:23:25,099 --> 01:23:27,499
So, there's nothing more
to show you.

1265
01:23:27,501 --> 01:23:29,434
You've had two years
to learn it.

1266
01:23:29,436 --> 01:23:33,539
Five more minutes isn't
gonna make a difference.

1267
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:37,808
I wish you'd come with me.
That'd be fun, wouldn't it?

1268
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:40,148
Though, I guess that defeats
the purpose of travel.

1269
01:23:44,018 --> 01:23:47,318
For me, anyway,
travel alone is one thing,

1270
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,354
travel with somebody else
is different.

1271
01:23:49,356 --> 01:23:52,226
But also the next few months
are meant to

1272
01:23:53,627 --> 01:23:56,161
clear my head.

1273
01:23:56,163 --> 01:23:59,565
For whatever reason, with you
around that doesn't work.

1274
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:03,238
Not you, specifically.
Just anyone.

1275
01:24:06,173 --> 01:24:09,208
For someone
with no substantial roots,

1276
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:13,678
it would seem I'm free
to do whatever I want.

1277
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:17,085
You have your sister.
I suppose I have mine, too.

1278
01:24:18,519 --> 01:24:20,088
Bet they're alike,

1279
01:24:21,488 --> 01:24:23,555
our sisters.

1280
01:24:23,557 --> 01:24:26,458
They have to make decisions based
on two people instead of one.

1281
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:29,831
What a drag that must be.

1282
01:24:34,368 --> 01:24:37,169
It's unlikely,
though, that

1283
01:24:37,171 --> 01:24:40,305
either of us would feel
the same sense

1284
01:24:40,307 --> 01:24:42,676
of gratification
that they do.

1285
01:24:45,412 --> 01:24:48,981
I wonder if when she's
your age, or I am,

1286
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:55,987
we'll find ourselves looking forwards
or backwards at the decisions

1287
01:24:55,989 --> 01:24:58,592
the other one
or the other made and

1288
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,795
thinking,

1289
01:25:02,529 --> 01:25:06,300
for one day, we would
want to switch places.

1290
01:25:08,435 --> 01:25:10,704
It's unlikely,
but you never know.

1291
01:25:16,877 --> 01:25:19,380
I'm gonna go
wait for my car.

1292
01:25:21,849 --> 01:25:23,915
I wonder if the next time
we see each other

1293
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:25,584
one or the other
will have met someone

1294
01:25:25,586 --> 01:25:28,085
who makes us feel or

1295
01:25:28,087 --> 01:25:33,094
desire something we don't
currently feel or desire.

1296
01:25:35,462 --> 01:25:36,497
Desire.

1297
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,969
That's a novel concept.

1298
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:08,494
I need to give the key back to
you before I leave tomorrow.

1299
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:11,296
I think they just said to leave
them under the mat before you go.

1300
01:26:11,298 --> 01:26:12,830
No, I meant the office keys.

1301
01:26:12,832 --> 01:26:15,369
Oh, yeah, I'll take those.

1302
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:20,871
I'm applying for this
work-study program in Sydney

1303
01:26:20,873 --> 01:26:22,340
and I was wondering
if maybe you could write

1304
01:26:22,342 --> 01:26:24,179
a letter of recommendation
for me.

1305
01:26:24,845 --> 01:26:26,344
Yeah.

1306
01:26:26,346 --> 01:26:29,581
- Sure.
- Great. Thank you.

1307
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:31,152
I, um...

1308
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:37,522
I hope that I've been helpful
to you over the last few months

1309
01:26:37,524 --> 01:26:41,593
and that Timothy's materials
are in a better shape now

1310
01:26:41,595 --> 01:26:43,298
than they would have been
without me here.

1311
01:26:44,631 --> 01:26:46,333
I believe they are.

1312
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:49,134
Good.

1313
01:26:49,136 --> 01:26:53,472
And I wanted to thank you for
introducing me to your family and

1314
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:55,508
inviting me into your home.

1315
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:59,311
I don't think many people would
blend work and family like that

1316
01:26:59,313 --> 01:27:01,849
and I think it was
very classy of you.

1317
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:06,386
Um...

1318
01:27:07,186 --> 01:27:08,787
And...

1319
01:27:08,789 --> 01:27:11,990
I hope that we can
stay in touch.

1320
01:27:11,992 --> 01:27:14,058
You know,

1321
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:17,329
if I... If I come back here, maybe
when I'm done with my studies,

1322
01:27:17,331 --> 01:27:20,101
we could perhaps
work together again.

1323
01:27:22,703 --> 01:27:23,705
Yeah, sure.

1324
01:27:24,338 --> 01:27:25,405
Great.

1325
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,352
<i>It's okay,
she's gone anyway.</i>

1326
01:27:41,354 --> 01:27:43,955
I'm without assistant.

1327
01:27:43,957 --> 01:27:46,058
I thought she left
last week.

1328
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,395
No, today.

1329
01:27:48,462 --> 01:27:50,331
You stopped
mentioning her.

1330
01:27:51,765 --> 01:27:55,768
What's to say?
She was a boring person.

1331
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:57,803
I know Gwen wanted
to spend some time with her.

1332
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:00,775
I wonder if that
ever ended up happening.

1333
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:03,107
Um...

1334
01:28:03,109 --> 01:28:05,544
She started seeing
some guy.

1335
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:07,812
He came to pick her up
for lunch.

1336
01:28:07,814 --> 01:28:10,918
Anyway, he stopped coming
like a week or so ago.

1337
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,451
Anyway.

1338
01:28:13,453 --> 01:28:16,888
I don't know what happened
with that, she...

1339
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:21,058
She got sloppy, and the
work suffered, so that's...

1340
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:22,262
That's that.

1341
01:28:25,164 --> 01:28:26,801
Everything okay?

1342
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:32,407
I don't know.

1343
01:28:35,408 --> 01:28:39,111
Finishing a job can't help
but make me feel miserable

1344
01:28:39,113 --> 01:28:41,946
about the state
of my own work.

1345
01:28:41,948 --> 01:28:45,550
It's dead and irrelevant.

1346
01:28:45,552 --> 01:28:47,018
I don't know.

1347
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:49,323
Lifetime after lifetime...

1348
01:28:51,591 --> 01:28:54,226
Catalogued,
packed with gloves,

1349
01:28:54,228 --> 01:28:56,130
packed up, shipped away.

1350
01:28:59,565 --> 01:29:01,301
Is that all there is?

1351
01:29:01,528 --> 01:29:06,528
