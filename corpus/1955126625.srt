1
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:27,486
我所爱的李慕白已经死去18年了
It has been 18 years since the death of my beloved Li Mu Bai.

2
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,367
那段时间里     侠义之士
In that time,the followers of the Iron Way

3
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:36,495
变得越来越少
have become few and far between.

4
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:44,044
武林中人不断争权夺利
Warring clans now vie for power over the Martial World.

5
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:51,719
我却希望能被武林所遗忘
It is into this world that I hope to slip unnoticed...

6
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,348
就像一个被遗忘的鬼魂一样
like a forgotten ghost

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,307
Name：Personnel are rubbish

7
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,307
据说一位学者的声名
It is said that a scholar's name will last

8
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,310
在他死后会持续5年
for five years beyond his passing...

9
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:46,315
一位剑客的名字会被铭记20年
and a swordsman will be remembered for 20 years.

10
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,404
这似乎意味着赞美...
This is meant as praise...

11
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:58,118
但我相信这是一种祸害
but I believe it to be a curse.

12
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,163
这是谁?
Well, what have we here?

13
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:50,124
这个女人说她想加入本派
This girl claims she wants to join our ranks.

14
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,085
守卫在山门前发现了她
The guards found her at the temple gate.

15
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,265
你为何而来？
What brings you here?

16
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,143
我找西莲派的戴阎王
I seek Hades Dai of the West Lotus.

17
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:12,021
一个可以一统武林的高人
A man great enough to rule the Martial World.

18
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,607
现在你已经看到他了     你有什么要说的？
And now you have found him. What would you ask of me?

19
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,730
让她走
Let her go!

20
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,858
直到值得被我杀死
Let her grow into someone worth killing.

21
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,546
魏方
Wei-Fang.

22
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,395
现身！
Show yourself!

23
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:40,901
你是谁
Who are you?

24
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,402
问她
Ask her.

25
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,529
魏方
Wei-Fang

26
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,543
你是谁？
Who are you?

27
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:03,507
带我去见戴阎王     我会给他一个预料之外的惊喜
Bring me to Lord Dai and I will give him a prize greater than the one he sought.

28
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,644
主子     俞师傅已经到了
Master Yu has arrived, sir.

29
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,230
秀莲
Xiu Lien.

30
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,648
你算是悲痛日子里的一点安慰
You brighten a sad day.

31
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,819
你以前住的客房我特意留了下来
I've ensured your old quarters were kept for you.

32
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,196
我知道你一定会来
I knew you would come.

33
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,391
你不是唯一知道的人
You were not the only one. 

34
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:53,240
我在路上被袭击了
I was attacked along the way.

35
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:55,744
先父辞世后       武林中已有数十个剑客被杀
Two dozen swordsmen slain since my father passed.

36
00:08:55,827 --> 00:09:00,958
即便是像你这样的高手    戴阎王也毫无所忌
Hades Dai knows no fear to attack a warrior as great as you.

37
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,251
你于危险之中我也很难过
I'm sorry you were put at risk.

38
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:06,671
分担贝勒府的悲痛      我也是理所应当
It is my duty to be here,to share your family's loss.

39
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,299
共承悲痛
Our loss.

40
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,302
我父亲总是待你像家人一样
My father always regarded you as family.

41
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,722
它没有被藏起来
It is not kept hidden.

42
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:19,143
在家父最后的一年里    想把它放到一个看得到的地方
In his last year,my father wanted it where he could see it.

43
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,938
会让他想起了更多难忘的日子
It reminded him of more noble days.

44
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,927
它有着这么多不幸的事
It bears so many sorrows.

45
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,099
最难忘的是
One above all.

46
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,977
李慕白
Li Mu Bai.

47
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,771
我曾是他的学生    那时你们都在这儿
I was his student when you were both here.

48
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:09,067
他的死触动了我们所有人
His death touched us all.

49
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,323
我父亲    他以为你们会共结连理
My father, he thought you would wed.

50
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,536
我们不会
We could not.

51
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,120
我和另一个人已有婚约
I was promised to another.

52
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,835
它应该被藏起来
It should be locked away.

53
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,256
铁贝勒已经死了
A great lord has died,

54
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,758
你想利用这段混乱的时间
and you seek to use this time of chaos

55
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:37,262
成为武林至尊
to emerge as the one true leader of the Martial World.

56
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,265
你能看透我的心思？
Do you read my mind?

56
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,265
我能看到你的野心
No. Your ambition.

57
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,602
那把刀很好
This sword is great,

58
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,646
但还有一把更好的
but there is one greater.

59
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,315
青冥宝剑
The Green Destiny.

60
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,282
青冥宝剑已经消失了很多年了
The Green Destiny was lost long years ago.

61
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:00,536
并没有消失     是被藏了起来
Not lost. Hidden.

62
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,121
就在铁贝勒府
Kept by the House of Te.

63
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:06,166
我该在贝勒府掀起一场血雨腥风吗？
Am I to storm the home of the Emperor's brother?

64
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,797
只需要让一个人去即可
Send instead a single drop of rain.

65
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,926
他
The boy...

66
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,054
他失败了一次     刚刚爬回家
who crawled home from failure?

67
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,057
那不是魏方一个人的错
The fault is not Wei-Fang's alone.

68
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,476
他武艺尚浅
His training is not complete.

69
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,313
让他去做这件事无异于自杀
To send him on this mission alone would be suicide.

70
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,222
也许我可以
Perhaps I can-

70
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,732
是他带我来见你
He brought me to you.

70
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,568
让他去
Send the boy.

71
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,945
他和剑的命运是束缚在一起的
He and the sword are bound by fate.

72
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,115
我已经看到了
I have seen it.

73
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,755
那位年轻的小姐是谁
Who is that young lady?

74
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,051
我想是位官员的女儿
I believe the daughter of an official.

75
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:43,221
有很多人前来吊丧
Many have come to pay their respects.

76
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,602
贼！  家里进贼了！
Thief! Thief in the house!

77
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,659
这人是谁？
Who is this man?

78
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,786
我听到些动静
I heard a disturbance.

79
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,872
他试图偷剑
He was trying to steal the sword.

80
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,623
我试图偷...?
I was trying to steal--?

81
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,585
抓住他了
We caught the thief.

82
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,295
他不止是贼
He is more than a thief.

83
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,549
它是西莲派的      是他袭击了我的马车
He is West Lotus.He attacked my carriage.

84
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,639
把他带到衙门
Take him to the Marshal. 

84
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:12,639
不     把他关在这里
No. Keep him here. 

85
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:16,560
戴阎王不会随便指派个人来
Hades Dai would not assign this mission lightly.

86
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,480
如果这个人对他有价值      对我们也一样
If the boy has value to him,he may yet have value to us.

87
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,483
好吧
Very well.

88
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,777
把他关在院子里
Confine him and secure the compound.

89
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,342
会对这个男的做什么？
What will happen to him? The boy?

90
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,802
你是谁？
Who are you?

91
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:52,679
我叫雪瓶
I am called Snow Vase.

92
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,099
我来祭奠铁贝勒
I came to pay my respects to Sir Te.

93
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,268
你很关心这个贼？
And your concern for the thief?

94
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,272
只是对奇怪的事有些好奇
You mistake curiosity for concern.

95
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,866
这把剑像他们说的那般厉害吗？
Is it as powerful as they say?

96
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,329
在正确的人手里是
In the right hand.

97
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,406
教教我
Teach me.

98
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,366
你学的够好了
You have been well taught already.

99
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,663
我想学更多武艺
I want to learn more.

100
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,792
像你这般
I want to walk the path you followed.

101
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:13,760
我会照顾你一辈子
I will serve you for life.

102
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,223
我不需要丫环      雪瓶
I don't need a servant, Snow Vase.

103
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:23,061
我一向独来独往      并且很快会回到这种生活
My life is solitude,and I return to it shortly.

104
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:26,105
如果你想寻求一位师父的话      请到别处
If you seek a teacher,you must look elsewhere.


105
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,753
这么冷的一夜      都不能让你松口？
Did a night in the cold loosen your tongue?

106
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,797
把笼子打开      我会把你的牙打掉
Open this cage and I'll loosen your teeth.

107
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,635
够了
That's enough!

108
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,518
你叫什么名字
What is your name? 

108
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,518
魏方
Wei-Fang.  

109
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,190
戴阎王想要那把剑？
So, Hades Dai wants the sword？

110
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,030
现在让我带这把剑走      你们还有一条活路
Let me leave with the sword now and you'll be spared.

111
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,532
否则    血染贝勒府
Otherwise, this house will swim with blood.

112
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,828
必须给皇上送个口信
Word must be sent to the Emperor.

113
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,288
京城以南恐有争斗
There is war in the south.

114
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:28,167
我不能以江湖纷争打扰他
I cannot trouble him with these underworld affairs.

115
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,670
皇上也从不听信我们父子的只言片语
The Emperor doesn't heed my words as he did my father's.

116
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,548
剑必须马上转移走
The sword must be removed from here at once.

117
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,133
它在这里很安全    秀莲
It is safest here, Xiu Lien.

118
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,261
如果西莲派要夺走它      放在哪里都不安全
Nothing is safe if West Lotus claims that sword.

119
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,472
剑必须被带到武当派藏于山中
It must be taken to Wudang Temple,high up in the mountains.

120
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,142
不   我曾对先父起誓
No. I made an oath to my father

121
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,687
将青冥宝剑守护在贝勒府
that I would guard and protect the Green Destiny within these walls.

122
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:50,065
铁贝勒在天之灵会明白的
Sir Te would understand.

123
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:54,318
你作为一家之主      众人尊敬
You've earned your place in this house and much respect beyond.

124
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,613
只有你这么说    秀莲
Only from you, Xiu Lien.

125
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,448
一直没变
It was always that way.

126
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,283
你先听我说
Then listen to me now.

127
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:04,788
假如戴阎王真的来了      他只会鸡犬不留
If Hades Dai comes here,he'll leave nothing standing.

128
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:08,249
没有人会活下去      我们没有别的选择
No one alive.We have no choice.

129
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:14,338
我对我父亲的誓言      是我受人尊敬的根本
The promise that I made my father is all I have to earn honor in this house.

130
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,926
这才是我余生最重要的     秀莲
It is worth my life, Xiu Lien.

131
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,097
我们必须让客人离开
We must ask the guests to leave.

132
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:28,436
你会留在这里吗？     你与我父亲总是互帮互助
Will you stay? You always came to my father's aid and he to yours.

133
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,355
你会帮我吗？
Will you help?

134
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,360
只要需要      我会一直留在这里
I will stay as long as I am needed.

135
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,405
我会恳请客人离开
I will bid the guests to leave.

136
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,866
留下那个喊贼的女人
Keep the girl who caught the thief.

137
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,285
她让我教他武艺
She has asked me to teach her...

138
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,872
但是我怀疑她另有所想
but I suspect she can teach us.

139
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,001
我们也需要更多的兵器
We will need more arms.

140
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,294
我会补充护卫
I will hire extra guards.

141
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,923
我们需要的不是简单的护卫
We need those who will do more than guard.

142
00:20:57,007 --> 00:21:01,469
而是一些侠义之士
There are warriors who once stood against this type of injustice.

143
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,266
肝胆相照
True followers will still answer the call.

144
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,478
侠义不只是道听途说...
The Iron Way is not legend...

145
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,355
远远不是
not yet.

146
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,900
我告诉你      我很讲信用
I'm telling you, I'm good for it.

147
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,027
你根本就是言而无信
You are good for nothing.

148
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,201
我们就是告示上要找的人
We're good for your warrant.

149
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:53,123
我有29个弟兄      每个人头20两纹银
I have 30 swords at 20 ounces of silver a head.

150
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,707
那是...
That's...

151
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:59,045
600两纹银...     可惜了
six hundred ounces of silver... wasted.

152
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:03,633
铁贝勒文武双全      受人敬仰
Sir Te was honored by masters of pen and sword alike.

153
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:08,471
如果他的家人需要      侠肝义胆之士都会相应其号召
If his house has need, men of the Iron Way should heed for the honor of his cause,

154
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,723
不取分毫
not promise of riches.

155
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,725
这位朋友说得好
My friend is right.

156
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:16,104
这告示不是给你看的
This warrant is not for you.

157
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,524
如果我说是哪？
And if I say it is?

158
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,927
想想再说
Think about it.

159
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,348
别急于说出口
They're not that fast.

160
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:56,435
大言不惭...     就凭你
Big words for a little man...all alone.

161
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,520
他可不是一个人
He's not alone.

162
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,024
我和他一起的
I stand with him.

163
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:05,028
山东飞刀    愿听差遣
Flying Blade of Shantung,at your service.

164
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,697
我也一样
As am I.

165
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,327
浙江 - 陈一雷 
Thunder Fist Chan, famed in Zhejiang.

166
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,996
还有我
And I,

167
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:19,125
福州 - 史银镖
Silver Dart Shi.Famed in Fuzhou.

168
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:26,924
还有我    马贵      四海为家
And I, Turtle Ma.Famed in... this tavern.

169
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,980
你是谁
Who are you?

170
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:31,568
我被叫作独狼
I'm known as Silent Wolf.

171
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,364
看来桌子都要重做了
We'll have to rebuild all the tables!

172
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,200
是谁威胁着铁贝勒府
Who threatens the House of Te?

173
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,369
西莲派
West Lotus.

174
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,746
我需要一些侠客守护贝勒府
I need swords to protect its walls.

175
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,456
现在至少四个人了
Now you have four more.

176
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,918
算上我一个
To add to your army. 

177
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:48,918
你需要多少个人
How many, in your army? 

178
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,001
五个人
Five. 

179
00:27:50,261 --> 00:27:51,040
五百人
Hundred?

180
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:52,463
五个人
Five. 

181
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:59,596
不断跑动可以一敌百
Well, better five that can fight than 500 that can run.

182
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,014
我想喝一杯
I need a drink.

183
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:11,190
不要钱    也别再回来了
On the house. Never come back.


184
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,075
我现在开始教你
Let the training begin.

185
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:14,420
不要只用眼看      也要用心听
Do not just watch with your eyes,listen with your mind.

186
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,216
再试一次
Again.

187
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,015
再试一次
Again.

188
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,478
你对那个人很好奇
Your curiosity with the boy...

189
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,480
我不是好奇
I'm not curious.

190
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,732
难道是我看错了？
Then what do I now mistake for curiosity?

191
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,151
无可救药！
Hopeless!

192
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,402
多管闲事
Irritation.

193
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:40,822
必须在这练武吗？
Must we train here?

194
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,822
是
Yes.

195
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,575
一股脑儿可学不到真本事
True skill is not a blazing flame.

196
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,930
再试一次
Again.

197
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:08,849
过于努力了！
Too much blazing flame!

198
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,809
与你无关
This does not concern you!

199
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,570
即便你毁上千根木棍  上千把剑
A thousand broken sticks and swords

200
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,989
只要你不平心静气      什么也学不会
won't teach as much as the one that bends to your will.

201
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,498
无论怎样做都可以       只要碰得到我
Touch me, however you can.

202
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:32,798
对我也行
Or me!

203
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:35,125
别理他       来吧。
Ignore him. Strike me.

204
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,175
招式路数太明显了
The predictable attack has a predictable outcome.

205
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,512
再来
Again.

206
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,523
一直练习
Keep practicing.

207
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,401
要变幻莫测
Be unpredictable.

208
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:07,533
轻功
Light Body Skill.

209
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,118
你从哪学的
Where did you learn that?

210
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,246
我师傅教我的
My teacher. She taught me.

211
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:15,874
看起来你师傅是一个女人
So, your teacher was a woman.

212
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,421
她叫什么名字
What is her name?

213
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,800
你不会知道她的
You would not know it.

214
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,886
为什么你不跟她学的时间长一点
And why do you no longer study with her?

215
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,278
她死了
She died.

216
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,196
很多年了
Years ago.

217
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:49,700
我明白了
I see.

218
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,874
我会勤加练习
I will practice.

219
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,001
你不会白教的
Your patience will be rewarded.


220
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:18,896
也许你应该换一个大点的孔
Perhaps you need a bigger hole.

221
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,693
比如你那张一直张开的嘴
Like your mouth, which is always open.

222
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,194
倒是值得一试
I could try that.

223
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,529
也可以
You could try...

224
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,698
你也可以放我走
Or you could let me go.

225
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,161
放你走？   让你可以偷一次？
Let you go? So you can thieve again?

226
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:37,956
带着剑给那个大恶人戴阎王
Bring your spoils to that monster Hades Dai?

227
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,376
戴掌门是个十分厉害的人
Lord Dai is a great warrior.

228
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,838
在他的统领下      武林将会风平浪静
Under his hand,the Martial World will be peaceful.

229
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:47,090
你师傅是个杀人犯
Your master is a murderer.

230
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,488
啊，陈一雷
Ah, Thunder Fist Chan.

231
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:15,327
五两银子典当你的兵器对你来说       一定是件悲惨的事
Things must be quite dire for you to pledge your sword for five measly taels of silver.

232
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,705
这年头没镖压了吗？
No gold convoys going out this season?

233
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,583
我那是在保护我的兵器不被抢走
I was protecting that convoy from raiders,

234
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,668
尤其是你这种受雇的人
raiders that you hired out to.

235
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:29,174
那些来自浙江的拳手       总是找合适他们的理由
How these southern boxers from Zhejiang retell history when it suits them.

236
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,093
你在嘲笑浙江人吗？
You mock Zhejiang, do you?

237
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:34,221
别介意     我们都是为一件事聚才一起
Easy, boys.We have all been hired for the same cause.

239
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,433
但是有人确切的知道是什么吗？
But does anyone know what that is exactly?

240
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,519
因为我们都能喝吗？
All the wine we can drink?

241
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:42,479
我不敢苟同
I didn't hear that part, Ma.

242
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,315
算是原因之一
It was implied.

243
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,579
我听到些风言风语
I heard whispers that it's kept there.

244
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,497
铁贝勒府
In the House of Te.

245
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,417
青冥宝剑一直在那
The Green Destiny.

246
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,797
剑的铸造
The blade was forged

247
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,133
可以追溯到先秦
Forged with a technique that dates back to the Qin era.

248
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,302
锻造的方法没有传下来   (指吴国的揉剑法)
A technique lost to history.

249
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:18,790
由一种特殊材料锻造   (先秦的时候，有大马士革钢这种说法？)
A blade that could carve through Damascus steel.

250
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:23,729
最后手持这把剑的人在一场决斗中被击败了
Nobody who was wielding the blade was ever defeated in a duel or battle.

251
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,901
独狼       这是真的吗？
Silent Wolf, is this true?

252
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,694
我们是去守剑的吗？
Are we being hired to guard a sword?

253
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,950
我很好奇他怎么起了这么一个名字
I wonder how he got his name.

254
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,028
恭迎各位到来
I bid you welcome.

255
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,186
失陪了
Excuse me.

256
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,800
解释一下    一个人是怎样起死回生的
Explain how a man returns from the dead.

257
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,596
我们订婚了
We were to wed.

258
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,891
我也为你感到哀痛
I mourned for you.

259
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,189
秀莲
Xiu Lian

260
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:34,234
你不要说那个名字
That name is not yours to speak.

261
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,785

我在那场决斗之前心已经死了    很早以前
I was dead before that duel，Long before

262
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:50,167
我这么做是为了你和李慕白
I did it for you and Li Mu Bai.

263
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:57,549
我知道你爱的是他    不是我
I knew you loved him, not me.

264
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,645
我和戴阎王在灵鹫峰的决斗
When Hades Dai and I fought on Vulture's Peak...

265
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,234
是我唯一能看到的出路
...I took the only path I could see.

266
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:36,088
戴阎王以为我死了
Hades Dai left me for dead.

267
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,516
而我留在山上
I made my way to the mountains,

268
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,060
选择独自隐居
and chose a life of solitude.

269
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:57,109
在哪之前...     我发现慕白和我追求的...
Up there... I found what Mu Bai and I had strived for...

270
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,112
我无法面对...
detachment...

271
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,740
后来我想开了
enlightenment.

272
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:17,087
我离开     是因为我知道只要我还活着
I stayed away because I knew that as long as I was alive,

273
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:19,215
慕白是不会向你求婚的
Mu Bai would not ask you to marry him.

275
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,675
即便你死了
Nor in your death.

276
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,095
他也没有这么做
Such was his honor.

277
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:26,972
你装死什么意义也没有
You feigned your death for nothing.

278
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,809
不是装死
It wasn't feigned.

279
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,106
我切身感受到了
It was deeply felt.

280
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,485
那只是你一厢情愿      你让我们所有人都相信了
That was your choice,and you made it for all of us.

281
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:49,036
在你死后我已经心境平和了     以后也是
I have made peace with your passing, and so it will remain.

282
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:55,125
你留在这里       是因为需要你
You are needed and you're here.

283
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:58,378
你的本领和胆识还没有被忘记
Your skill and courage are not forgotten.

284
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,299
再无其他
All else is.

285
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:23,528
你是谁
And you are?

286
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,572
雪瓶
Snow Vase.

287
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,284
俞秀莲的徒弟
Student of Master Yu Shu Lien.

288
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:34,081
我还不知道她还有一个徒弟
I have not known her to take a student.

289
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,291
现在你知道了
So you know her well.

290
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,833
嗯
Well enough.

291
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,210
怎么了？
How?

292
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,966
这儿不是多说的地方
This is not the place for story.

293
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,598
那以后再说
Another time, then.

294
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,145
你师傅...
Your teacher...

295
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,606
她怎么样？
is she content?

296
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,150
她很伤心
She's in mourning.

297
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,693
我知道
Of course.

298
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,488
不只是因为铁贝勒
I do not speak just of Sir Te.

299
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:52,117
你动作真轻
You move as quietly as ever.

300
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,372
再轻你也听到了
Not so quiet that you will not hear.

301
00:40:58,498 --> 00:40:59,791
你收了一个徒弟
You have taken a student.

302
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,793
是
Yes.

303
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:07,590
她和笼子里那个人       有些莫名的联系
They are connected somehow,she and that boy.

304
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:14,514
那个人走入歧途       但我能感到一颗单纯的心
He roars, but I feel a gentle soul may sleep within.

305
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,577
你的徒弟那？
And your student? 

305
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,019
我不太确定
I am not certain. 

306
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,937
我从她眼神里看到了一丝阴暗
I see darkness in her eyes.

307
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,691
对她可能是一个凶兆
She could be an even greater threat.

308
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,484
对我也是
To us...

309
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,654
这些守卫顶得住吗？
or those we guard against?

310
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,240
事后才能知道
Time will tell.

311
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,831
雪瓶的师傅可能是寒梅  (玉娇龙)
Her teacher may have been Han Mei,

312
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:43,001
背离武当的那个女侠
the renegade swordswoman from Willow Valley.

313
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:46,088
她已经死去很多年了
She's gone many years.

314
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:49,674
那她教雪瓶的时候一定很年轻
So she taught Snow Vase quite young.

315
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:51,760
太桀骜不驯
Too young.

316
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,565
雪瓶小姐？
Miss Snow Vase?

317
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:48,827
来和我们喝一杯
Raise a cup with us. 

317
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:50,527
来吧
Yes, come in. 

318
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:53,863
来吧,雪瓶？
Come on, Snow？

319
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:05,583
敬铁贝勒
Mm-hm. To Sir Te and to his House.

320
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:14,468
他们说一个能够拿起酒杯的女人     才是男人想要的女人
They say a woman who can hold her wine is a woman a man will want to hold.

321
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:15,712
谁说的？
Who says that? 

321
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:17,012
我说的
I do. 

322
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,063
我们喝酒是为了记起一些事
We drink to remember,

323
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:30,526
但是你们喝酒是为了忘记一些事
but it seems you drink to forget.

324
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,866
何从谈起？
How do you take the measure of a man?

325
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,451
你是从哪看出来的？
Which part of a man？

326
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,329
举手投足间
Ma, behave.

327
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:44,581
当我没问
I said nothing.

328
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,416
酒后胡言
The wine was asking.

329
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,377
那就别问
Ask your heart.

330
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,130
你说得对
I do. My head answers.

331
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:56,009
这会有惨烈的一仗
The greatest battle of them all.

332
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,345
你也不是独自一个人
And you are hardly the only who fights it here.

334
00:43:59,388 --> 00:44:00,638
独狼在哪？
Where is Silent Wolf?

335
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:03,016
他和陈一雷在一起
He guards with Thunder Fist.

336
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,604
我想打听下     俞师傅     她有什么嗜好
So Master Yu, what is she like?

337
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:12,442
静下心来
Pierce its heart.

338
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:16,405
武艺的要诀是
True skill is a key in the moon.

339
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:19,699
耳听八方
Listen... with your nose.

340
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:24,287
眼观六路
A predictable attack has a predictable

341
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,562
你让我教你
You asked to be taught.

342
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,855
你就必须要明白        你要学的还有很多
And clearly,there is much you need to learn.

343
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:52,482
师傅        要做多久
How long, teacher?

344
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:06,079
这根木棍的影子从这到那
Until the shadow moves from here to there.

345
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,958
两次
Twice.

346
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:36,776
你学的很快
You learn quickly.

347
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:39,946
很好  
That's good.

348
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:58,298
雪瓶        你对她了解多少
Snow Vase. How do you know her?

349
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,675
一点也不了解
I do not.

350
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,843
那她对你感兴趣
Then her interest in you?

351
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:19,569
你师傅说你对我有些兴趣        真的吗？
Your master believes you have interest in me. True?

352
00:46:21,738 --> 00:46:25,367
说句话      我很无聊
Talk to me. I am bored.

353
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:27,200
孤独
Lonely.  

354
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,495
与我无关
Neither is my problem.  

355
00:46:28,578 --> 00:46:30,289
如果有关那？
But what if you are their solution?

356
00:46:30,578 --> 00:46:31,289
别说了
Stop talking.

357
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:35,835
如果你笑一个        我保证不再多说一句
A single smile and you have my word. I will fall silent.

358
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:38,796
你已经多说了一句        你怎么闭嘴？
How can you fall silent and yet give a word?

359
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,675
你为什么总是这么冰冷        没有一点笑容？
How can you hold so much wine and not smile?

360
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:27,429
这是红沙帮的地盘
This is territory allied to the Red Desert clan.

361
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,431
我们已经断了他们的后路
We have cut off their supply.

362
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:32,058
明晚
Come the New Moon,

363
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:35,645
西莲派会占据整个地盘
West Lotus will own this entire territory.

364
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:39,065
但也只不过是在灵宝
But this is merely Lingbao.

365
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:41,735
不是北京的贝勒府
Not Peking.

366
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:46,197
我会派一部分人去北京
Mantis will go where an army cannot.

367
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:52,078
而你们聚集在黄河边准备迎战
While you soldiers will gather at the Twin Rivers and prepare for war

368
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,914
面对武林中的所有对手
against all rival clans in the Martial World.

369
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,585
魏方没有做到的我会做到
I will succeed where Wei-Fang did not.

370
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,846
现在你看到了什么        先知？
What do you see now, prophet?

371
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,142
什么也没有
I see nothing,

370
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,519
但是我听到了一些
but I hear word.

372
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:21,274
就像你听到的        魏方会偷剑成功？
Just as you heard word that Wei-Fang would succeed in his raid?

373
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,276
再说错一次
Give another false prophecy,

374
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,904
你不仅会没有眼睛        舌头也会没有
you'll not only have no eyes, you'll have no tongue.

375
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:32,910
但那时你就不会知道贝勒府的贵客是谁了
But then you wouldn't know of the honored guest who now resides at the House of Te

376
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:38,750
一个死里逃生的人
One thought long dead has returned.

377
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:44,380
一雷守住南院
Thunder Fist will guard the south gate.

378
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:47,133
马贵        我们这很容易受到攻击
Turtle Ma,we are vulnerable here.

379
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,794
有人来了
Guard!

380
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:16,282
他们来救我了
They've come for me.

381
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,034
我才能救你
I've come for you.

382
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:22,288
他们只会鸡犬不留
They leave destruction,death in their wake.

383
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,666
你还和他们一起吗？
Do you still stand with them?

384
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:31,380
你还和他们一起吗？
Do you still stand with them?

385
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:00,660
小心背后
Look out.

386
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:08,793
剑在哪？
Where's the sword?

387
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:10,545
他不知道
He does not know.

388
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,596
剑在东院
The sword is in the east courtyard.

389
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,474
一旦我拿到了剑       第一个要死的就是你
Once I hold the blade, you will be the first to fall.

390
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:40,783
你找不到的
You will not find it there,

391
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:43,160
剑在我这
nor take it from here.

392
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,542
俞师傅
Master Yu!

393
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:54,213
放他走
Let him go.

394
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,472
放开他
Release him.

395
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:06,935
把剑给我        否则就是他死
Give it to me now or he dies!

396
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:09,311
贝勒府也会没落
The House of Te will fall.

397
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:12,732
侠义之道也会随之没落
As will the followers of the Iron Way.

398
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:13,983
你是谁？
Who are you?

399
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:18,613
我父母被你手里的这把剑所杀
My parents were slain by the sword you hold.

400
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:23,993
每一个夜晚        我都能听到他们在地府叮嘱我
On clear nights, I still hear them calling to me from the other world.

401
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,122
只有一句话
One word...


402
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,331
报仇
vengeance.

403
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:52,772
为了那么一点小钱送死        多可怜啊！
Such a pity to die for a fee！

404
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,404
不是为了钱       是侠义
Not for gold, it's for the Iron Way.

405
00:54:05,994 --> 00:54:10,999
我弟弟就是因此而死        一点也不值得
My brother died for the Iron Way.It was worthless.

406
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:13,960
你应该找个好点的理由
You should have found yourself a better cause,

407
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:15,419
或者像我一样
as I did.

408
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,299
史银镖！     滚开！
Shi! No! Get away from her!

409
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:13,144
马贵...
Turtle Ma...

410
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:27,533
史银镖
Silver Dart Shi.Famed in Fuzhou.

412
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:34,290
还有铁贝子    (贝勒的儿子叫贝子)
And now I mourn the death of Sir Te Zhao,

413
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:37,919
你我情同手足
the son of the man who was like a father to me.

414
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,521
所有这些都是因为一把剑
All this for a sword.

415
00:55:57,605 --> 00:56:00,482
侠义、胆识、名望
Code, duty, honor.

416
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:05,529
他们都是因此而死
Excuses for bloodshed,all of them.

417
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:11,493
这就是我为什么看淡名利
That is why I left it behind.

418
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:15,539
心如止水
I was content.

419
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:17,041
置身其外了
Above it all.

420
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:21,796
现在我要做我该做的
And now a kite laments its return.

421
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,931
带着这把剑离开
I will take the sword and leave.

422
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:37,812
不       他们耳目众多
No. They watch the roads.

423
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,188
在这够安全了
It is safer here.

424
00:56:39,272 --> 00:56:41,649
我不这么想
But I do not feel it.

425
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:45,320
到处都弥漫着仇恨
Not when vengeance chokes the air.

426
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,042
你救了我一命
You saved my life.

427
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:02,003
我知道
I spoke before I thought.

428
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,713
你很善良
Your words came from the heart.

429
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:29,364
你母亲
Your mother...

430
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:31,991
告诉我你知道的
tell me of her.

431
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:35,000
为什么？
Why? 

432
00:57:35,111 --> 00:57:36,704
她是什么样的人
What was she like?

433
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:40,916
我没有母亲
I have no mother.

434
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:44,795
我被西莲派的铁乌鸦抚养长大
I was raised by Iron Crow of West Lotus.

435
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:48,132
他竭尽所能的教我
He taught me everything I know,

436
00:57:48,216 --> 00:57:50,301
就像你师傅教你一样
as your teacher taught you.

437
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,767
你学的很快
You learn fast.

438
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,478
很有天分
Knowledge is in your blood.

439
00:58:02,355 --> 00:58:03,647
继续练
Again.

440
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,984
他让我感到亲情
He gave me a sense of purpose.

441
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,841
你母亲是凉州方知府的小妾
Your mother was a concubine.

442
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:34,095
这你一定知道
Or so you've been told.

443
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:36,888
你怎么知道
How do you

443
00:58:37,038 --> 00:58:38,140
我知道你的过去
I know your past.  

444
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:40,809
谁告诉你这些的
Who told you this?

445
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,359
一位赫赫有名的女侠
A swordswoman of great renown.

446
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:51,946
你真正的母亲叫做寒梅    (玉娇龙)
Your real mother was known as Han Mei.

447
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:11,299
一个受过难以估量痛苦的女人。
A woman who had felt and brought immeasurable pain.

448
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:15,428
她怀着的你
In her womb, she carried you,

449
00:59:15,511 --> 00:59:19,307
是她所爱的男人的最后一晚留下来的
the legacy from her last night with the man she loved.

450
00:59:25,438 --> 00:59:28,483
她怀的是一个男孩
Great is the joy of a child,

451
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,986
并且有一个胎记
greater still, the value of a boy.

452
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,370
当她睡下的时候
While she slept,

453
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:45,624
前几天客栈里一个生了一个女儿的小妾
a concubine who had given birth to a daughter there days before...

454
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:50,379
把你换成了那个女孩...
switched her worthless girl for you...

455
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:57,761
如果她生出一个男孩的话       就能取悦他的丈夫
hoping it would please her master if she presented him with a son.

456
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:06,103
当寒梅发现的时候已经晚了
When Han Mei realized what had been done...

457
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:09,731
她本来打算抛弃这个女孩
she meant to abandon the girl.

458
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:14,695
但是于心不忍
But her heart refused.

459
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:36,800
她尝试着忘记你
She tried to wash from her skin he blood she had shed.

460
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:42,723
但是你母亲无法摆脱这份骨肉之痛
But your mother could not be rid of the pain she had caused in her life.

461
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:53,150
她视我如己出
She raised me as her own.

462
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:56,653
授我侠义之道
Trained me in the Iron Way.

463
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:08,707
那女人...     我母亲
The woman... My mother...

464
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,711
有找过我吗？
Did she look for me?

465
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:17,592
她每时每刻都在找你
Every minute of every day she searched.

467
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:34,983
她打听到那个小妾为了保命       把你给了西莲派
She learned the concubine had given you to West Lotus to save her own life.

468
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:40,322
为了找回你她挑战戴阎王
She challenged Hades Dai for your freedom.

469
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:33,917
她画下了你的胎记叮嘱我找到你
She showed me your birth markand said, "You must find him.

470
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:38,130
如果你是一个好人       就共扶侠义
If he is a good man, stand beside him.

471
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:42,635
如果你是个坏人
If he has become a poison dragon...

472
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,346
就杀了你
kill him."

473
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,935
你母亲
Your mother,

474
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:53,688
我师傅
my teacher...

475
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,025
因找你而死
died trying to find you.

476
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:08,536
这就是你我的故事
That is our story, yours and mine.

477
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:16,793
等等
Wait.

478
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:19,421
回来
Come back!

479
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,097
这是为了史银镖
This is for Shi!

480
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:30,807
这是为了马贵
And this is for Ma!

481
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:32,100
停手
Stop!

482
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:34,688
他是西莲派的人
He is one of them! 

482
01:03:34,827 --> 01:03:35,688
她说得对
She's right!  

483
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:39,024
这不是我们做事的方式
This is not our way.

484
01:03:49,744 --> 01:03:52,954
如果你要争斗       就应该公平一些
If you're going to fight, fight like men.

485
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,765
够了
Enough!

486
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,563
有人把你教的很好
Someone taught you well.

487
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,607
还不够好
Not well enough.

488
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,205
师傅？
Teacher?

489
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:18,332
进来
Come in.

490
01:05:27,508 --> 01:05:29,009
你要走了
You're leaving.

491
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:31,679
剑不能留在这儿
The sword cannot be kept here.

492
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:35,223
你要把它带到哪？
Where are you taking it?

493
01:05:35,307 --> 01:05:39,269
我不会告诉你的       太多人想得到它了
I would not burden you with that knowledge. Too many will hunt it.

494
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:41,515
我能和你一起走吗？
Can I go with you? 

494
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,815
不行
No. 

495
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:45,901
我必须孤身一人
I must make this journey alone.

496
01:05:46,485 --> 01:05:48,320
独狼那？
What about Silent Wolf?

497
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:50,906
跟你一起走吗？
Will he go?

498
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:52,032
他为什么要跟我一起走
Why should he?

499
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,826
我以为你们要一起走
I see the way you are together.

500
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:56,787
你不再信任他了吗？
Is it that you don't trust him anymore?

501
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:00,582
你说信任？
You speak of trust?

502
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,669
你的师傅是寒梅
You, whose teacher who was Han Mei.

503
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:08,298
你一直都知道？
You always knew?

504
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:11,844
她在武当学的轻功
She learned her skills at Wudang.

505
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:18,308
然后用它偷学武术背离武当
Then chose to use them for her own gain as an outlaw on the run.

506
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:22,354
你以为我看不到你在步她的后尘吗？
You think I wouldn't see her shadow on your sword?

507
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:25,524
我想把你从她的命运中拉出来
I wanted to save you from her fate.

508
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:28,193
你对她一无所知
You know nothing of her fate.

509
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:31,947
她死于那个屠夫戴阎王之手
Her life was lost to that butcher, Hades Dai.

510
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:35,992
我想学艺用着把剑为她报仇
I sought the sword and your teachings to avenge her.

511
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:38,537
雪瓶     你心中太多的仇恨
Do not carry vengeance in your heart, Snow

512
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,248
你让我忘掉过去
You tell me to let go of my past.

513
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:46,879
独狼一直在你身边       你也同样什么都没做
Silent Wolf waits for you and yet you do nothing.

514
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,800
你也没什么勇气面对
So much for your legendary courage.

515
01:06:51,884 --> 01:06:53,468
我的人生不会再变了
My path is set.

516
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:55,178
你还年轻
You are still young.

517
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:56,889
你可以
Yours is not.

518
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:00,893
我知道我该做什么
I know what I must do.

519
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:30,213
史银镖
Silver Dart Shi.

520
01:07:30,297 --> 01:07:32,841
她比我们更有勇气
She had more courage than any one of us.

521
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:41,475
马贵
Turtle Ma.

522
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:45,729
我从没想到我会这么说       我会想你的 
I never thought I'd be saying this, but I'm going to miss him.

523
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:51,026
多倒一点
Pour him a double.

524
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,415
你知道吗       在四川截镖的时候
You know, at the Battle of Sichuan,

525
01:08:05,499 --> 01:08:08,251
我也袭击过
I did hire out to those raiders.

526
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:11,129
但是我做的是劫富济贫
But only because I thought that they were doing the right thing.

527
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:13,507
我明白
I know that.

528
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:17,928
我心里清楚
Always did.

529
01:08:18,012 --> 01:08:21,389
而你是押镖的
And you hired out to that gold convoy for the same reason.

530
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:24,559
侠义之道
The Iron Way...

531
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,896
我们一直因它而活
some of us never stop living by it.

532
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:30,816
甚至也会因它而死
Even if it meant dying by it.

533
01:08:32,943 --> 01:08:36,321
我来这是为了祭奠铁贝勒
I came here to pay my respects to Sir Te.

534
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:45,205
而现在...
And now...

535
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:48,000
也为他儿子感到哀痛
I mourn for his son.

536
01:08:50,669 --> 01:08:54,965
今夜...       我要带剑离开
Tonight... I leave with the sword.

537
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:00,345
独狼那？
And Silent Wolf?

538
01:09:02,014 --> 01:09:03,390
你会告诉他吗？
Will you speak with him?

539
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:08,812
我会守住这把剑的
I'll guard the sword.

540
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:26,204
你背叛了戴阎王
You betrayed Hades Dai, boy.

541
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:29,083
她值得你这么做吗？
Is she worth your life?

542
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,710
你的师傅吗
And that of your teacher?

543
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:36,924
把剑带给戴阎王，否则你师傅铁乌鸦死路一条
Bring Hades Dai the sword or your Master, Iron Crow, dies.

544
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:41,970
现在他已经去找你了，把剑带回来
Even now, he rides to meet you and secure the sword.

545
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:11,249
我一定要带着剑走       你知道的
I cannot leave without the sword.You know this.

546
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,694
如果带剑走的话       你会被杀死的
You will be killed if you take it. 

546
01:10:12,732 --> 01:10:13,794
如果我不带剑走的话也会被杀死
- I will be killed if I don't. 

547
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:15,921
那就走的远远的
Then go!

548
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:19,299
离西莲派越远越好
Far from here,far from West Lotus Temple.

549
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,970
我遵守了对你母亲承诺
I fulfilled my promise to your mother.

550
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:26,723
现在你一定要答应我不再回来
Now you must promise me to never return.

551
01:10:28,809 --> 01:10:30,560
好
I promise.

552
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,565
我看丢他了
I never saw him.

553
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:25,157
一个人打了我       然后我就没知觉了
Felt a hand on my arm,then I could not move.

554
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,083
发生了什么事
What happened? 

554
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,283
剑丢了
The sword. 

555
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:28,994
那人偷走了它
The boy escaped and stole it.

556
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:15,832
你的命在你手中       别再走了
You hold your life in your hand. Think of that.

557
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:18,793
不止我一个人的命
It is not my life I hold this for.

558
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:24,062
走     活着把剑带走
Go! Take the sword and save yourself.

559
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:28,608
用你的命保住这把剑
Protect the sword with your life!

560
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:39,786
师傅！
Teacher!

561
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:40,870
走
Go!

562
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,049
撑住
Be still. 

562
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:35,049
我很好
I am all right. 

563
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:37,344
我先把血止住
Let me stop the bleeding.

564
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:43,933
秀莲
Xiu Lien...

565
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,645
我又一次失信了
I have failed you again.

566
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:57,613
你已经做了很多了       现在该我做出选择了
You made your choice all those years ago.Now I will make my choice.

567
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:07,832
来匡扶侠义之道       尽管会因其而死
To live the Iron Way,may be to die for it.

568
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:13,171
我会与你奋战到底
I would rather face an army by your side...

569
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:17,258
共赴黄泉
than to live another day without you.

570
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:49,434
你的预言是对的
Your prophecy is proven.

571
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,730
你师傅会为你感到骄傲
Your teacher would be proud.

572
01:18:59,277 --> 01:19:01,488
我母亲也是
And my mother as well.

573
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:42,088
一个曾经被我杀死的人竟然回来挑战我？
How does a man I once killed return to challenge me?

574
01:22:19,602 --> 01:22:22,730
和我一起在黑暗里吧       秀莲
Come with me into the dark,Xiu Lien.

575
01:23:02,729 --> 01:23:05,773
我们会送你归西
We will have our vengeance on you.

576
01:23:05,857 --> 01:23:11,487
去见你爱的李慕白
Now you will join your beloved, Li Mu Bai.

577
01:26:49,622 --> 01:26:51,999
我们尚未握着这把剑
We don't hold this sword.

578
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:56,087
这把剑却已握着我们
This sword holds us.

579
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:28,869
我不能失去你
No. I can't lose you.

580
01:27:28,953 --> 01:27:29,996
不
No.

581
01:27:32,165 --> 01:27:33,749
你不要死
You must fight.

582
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:39,505
活下去
Stay with us.

583
01:27:47,972 --> 01:27:50,599
这就是所说的       一位女侠的名号
It is said that a swordsman's name

584
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:54,353
可以影响其后20年

585
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:58,024

我们把剑带到了武当山       那里会是安全的地方
We take the sword to Wudang Mountain where it will be safe.

600
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:13,182
侠义       胆识       名望...
