1
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,136
Yeah, that's the
 show that like up close, huh?

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:14,848
Pleased to see no one likes to go.

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,852
This nigga used to be
 just like me, a regular cat.

4
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,396
He was one of the most respected
 dogs in the hood.

5
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,152
What was the fucking door mate to be

6
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:31,740
the name of the game is the show,
 but no, pick it up .

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,535
A natural born killer
 walked up in the middle of the rim.

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:40,707
Wow. It was it was every young girl's
 dream to have any girl he wanted.

9
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,126
And that was the life.

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,878
And I had to had it go.

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,213
They go in the car will be twenty one.

12
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,925
And as you can see.

13
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,511
So did he. Now, this is my homie shot.

14
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,264
He has been my boy since the third grade.

15
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,142
And he talked me into coming at night

16
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,562
after Asato Girls
 who I didn't regret it one bit.

17
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:10,487
Well, not yet. I'm Dre in the regular cat

18
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,783
now in order for me and Shonn
 to have that life in Columbus, Ohio.

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,911
We had to go through one man
 to beat his name.

20
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,331
Is it you want to?

21
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,085
Now he'd like to be called Zacharie,

22
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:30,006
the most respected and dangerous
 snake in the hood. Yeah.

23
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,427
Hold on for a second.

24
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,137
Oh, that's that's Kenny Clarke.

25
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:40,016
Now, his family had LucT and
 he gave Zach money not to kick his ass.

26
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,727
Unfortunately, it didn't do no good

27
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,857
for us to hang out

28
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,068
with all the pretty girls. Oh, hell no.

29
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,655
Get the school out of here.

30
00:01:55,573 --> 00:02:01,204
Well, I think it's all about
 jokes and Shipherd.

31
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,974
You got to handle this like I care.

32
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:25,562
And we've got to do
 to get up in this game. What

33
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,189
else do you think is that simple?

34
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,025
Could you just walks into my crib?

35
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,610
You want a game?

36
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,822
Nah, don't work like that.

37
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,159
So what do we got to do to be a

38
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,995
do our thing, son?

39
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,706
In the meantime, what has fun?

40
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:54,340
I think we saw real niggas
 don't get to like check

41
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,469
gets its own crack,
 but niggas with skullcaps, we watch it.

42
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,599
We don't want to do Matt and girls
 like last month when he saw up.

43
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,647
Gets it right. So can we push?

44
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,696
It's always it's that whether you work,
 it will make get the door, you say,

45
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,533
when they lock and load the funny
 out of a certain your name on safe place.

46
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,370
Great, great. Oh, you're welcome.

47
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,080
That rookie, I teach
 you the ropes some day.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,000
How you doing, a young boy?

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,001
Yeah, I'll stay out of trouble.

50
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,003
Math, out of trouble
 and do me a favor, man.

51
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,838
And I'm sure your mom appreciated.

52
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,716
Get yourself Adobe, boy.

53
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,810
Check it out, boy.

54
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:04,619
Sometimes 20 boys is going first.

55
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:10,541
I'll go, nah, I want you boy to go.

56
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,465
What we got to do this, huh?

57
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,509
I mean, what the fuck you get this
 nigga from, man?

58
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:23,638
Look, being a part of my clique entitles
 you to some motherfucking privileges.

59
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,015
I don't trust you.

60
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,433
Whatever, man, I.

61
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,812
But all I'm saying is, man,
 are you trying to kill nobody, man?

62
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,856
Stop acting like a bitch.
 The gun ain't even low.

63
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,484
Think I killed your stupid
 ass. A loaded gun.

64
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,154
Put it like this.

65
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,408
Who's going to be respected in school?

66
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,077
Mick is going to be scared, y'all and dumb

67
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,706
bitches out, bitches all on your dick.

68
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,050
I take your pathetic
 ass over a year ago, candidate

69
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,638
business school. Oh, boy.

70
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,570
And give up the car, motherfucker.

71
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,279
Oh, come on, man.

72
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,407
Two hours after car after car.
 Man, just don't get up.

73
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,533
Get up, go to some.

74
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:31,956
Don't shoot traffic because you got. Fabo.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
(Gunshot noises)

76
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,975
I can't wait for back up.

77
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,909
Oppositely the city's the

78
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,079
and I'm a collector now.

79
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:27,053
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

80
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:54,622
This columnist for the Wall.

81
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:14,308
Oh. Your show, what did I just do
 when you hear that man?

82
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,686
You fucking hear that.
 That's the police cover for us, man.

83
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,271
You know what I mean?

84
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,814
To do that, let's you know,
 I mean, to do that,

85
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,316
man, look, if you look me,
 you have to reach for that.

86
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,652
I mean, to do that.
 What's I supposed to do?

87
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,904
Many came right at me.
 Would you calm down?

88
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,698
Calm down. Yeah, man.

89
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:34,745
We did it with the fucking game
 couple talking about man

90
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,834
after today, nobody had ever

91
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:44,172
heard was XXXI You think I give a fuck
 about what Zach said? Huh?

92
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,966
What are we going to do about this shit?

93
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,512
We ain't going to do shit.

94
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,683
What's up, Zach?

95
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,020
I've always I could follow did job know,
 no, man, we wouldn't do that to you.

96
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,358
Good, good. So I feel
 I feel good. I spoke to.

97
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,030
Is he dead? I don't know.

98
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,824
Pertly. Don't care.
 I'm ready to pull the trigger again.

99
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,245
That opportunity
 you had that opportunity. But show boy.

100
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,665
Oh, I see that. What's up, Kelly?

101
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,460
You told me that gun, one loaded man.

102
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,255
Yeah, I no, he was kind of scared you
 of saying I shot somebody.

103
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:31,511
I shot a man. Now the fuck who you shot.

104
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,556
Oh, so what? People die every day.

105
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,976
It's a dog eat dog world.

106
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:45,566
You know what? The both of you are sick

107
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,028
and would tell you, like
 the song parts of this. Wait a minute.

108
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,365
What a fool would you not
 want a part of now?

109
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,575
The fuck off, Brooke.

110
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,494
It's too late. Yeah, I know.

111
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,247
Tchi, you are already a Potter killer.

112
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,334
Do you try to sing?

113
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,463
You try to say, I can't get out of.

114
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,259
So you fill in a bit sensitive, Bindman,

115
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,304
all at a massive conference.

116
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,057
Do you want me to give you
 a fucking hug and top?

117
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,603
Let me reiterate, I don't give a fuck

118
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,107
who you shot, who you kill. I don't care.

119
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,527
If you want to go

120
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,736
there, go to donate.

121
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,947
But just remember.

122
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,576
Use a chilidog. Secular.

123
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,543
Yo dre dry, you coming back?

124
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,087
You coming back?

125
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:52,466
Oh, I start, so what am I going to do
 but get the fuck out of you.

126
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,636
So it's an all out manhunt
 for the suspects

127
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:59,640
who allegedly carjacked and murdered
 40 year old Columbus native Harold Barnes.

128
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,518
Columbus police officer
 Bob Taylor was also shot.

129
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,437
He's in stable condition.

130
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,857
If anyone has any information
 leading to the capture of these suspects,

131
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,234
please contact the Columbus
 Police Department.

132
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,614
If convicted, the perpetrators could face
 life in prison or the death penalty.

133
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:19,869
In other news today, the city of Columbus
 announced a crackdown on gun licensing,

134
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,872
citing the increasingly.

135
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,990
Consent is at the core of modern

136
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,161
definition of the
 derivative can be approached.

137
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,458
One, Jim mentioned this
 a little bit earlier,

138
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,670
and the other one is rate of change,

139
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,798
the story there was made

140
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,677
between mathematicians, blacks,

141
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:26,894
blacks and whites beating down.

142
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,775
Historically, there was maybe stone.

143
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:45,496
Let's get the fuck off the car. Fuck off.

144
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:12,041
It's going to bite me. Oh, really?

145
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,628
Good morning, ma'am.

146
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,422
Well, good morning, Dr. Carter.

147
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,175
I got to tell you something.

148
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,010
No, I got to tell you something else.

149
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,055
I really, really got
 to get this off my chest. Bam.

150
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,099
Check that out, baby.
 I said you'll take us to success.

151
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,812
You have been accepted to Georgetown
 and Ohio State University.

152
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,731
You're going to college, baby.

153
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:16,188
All the noise. Oh, OK.

154
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:22,194
Mm hmm. You are going to be the best
 looking most upon then.

155
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:22,903
Thank you, ma'am.

156
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,697
You will want to see.

157
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,824
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes.

158
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,576
You got to pay for the back.
 I show you the front for free.

159
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,705
You going to hurt him, baby?

160
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,923
Let's get rebounds.

161
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,140
Don't kill like I'm

162
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,934
sure like a family man. Hey, Mr.

163
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,395
Adobe, with your wife.

164
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,526
You will never get away with. I'll to.

165
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,088
You said I was told coming up in Moscow.

166
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,632
So you're still banging on the stuff
 that happened last year?

167
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,592
Yeah, man, I am.

168
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,804
It's OverDog is over and done with Sean.

169
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,889
I took somebody's father,

170
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,643
somebody's husband. OK, yes.

171
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,561
We got away with it.

172
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,813
But what about that man?

173
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,232
I mean, I can't help in my mind, man.

174
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:09,695
But to think about the family dog,

175
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,532
you are really Tribbett.

176
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,286
Look at it this way.

177
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:23,042
Remember when she goes
 mom and dad, his fat ass insurance policy?

178
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:27,212
A little mixed Puerto Rican ass
 is run around in the beds. He came up.

179
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,508
Hmm. When you start a school.

180
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,307
I don't know if I'm going to.

181
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,436
What and I may be in jail, duh.

182
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,108
What the hell are you talking about, Sean?

183
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,487
I'm thinking about turn himself in.

184
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,577
What makes you think I'm playing?

185
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,831
You know, you better be your ass.

186
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,043
That's the guy that's
 still up there myself.

187
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,129
Are you OK? Yeah.

188
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,382
You know what? You're supposed
 to be smoking in my house, man. Get out.

189
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,386
You wouldn't believe it. Hello, Mr.

190
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,931
Bar at home, Sheriff.

191
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,198
Hello, Mr. Barnes.

192
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,451
Junior, senior, senior. He's at work.

193
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,703
I took a message from.

194
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,400
Hey, mama. I don't mean to disturb you,

195
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,361
but I was walking by and I noticed
 that you needed to leave, right?

196
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,073
Oh, I'm sorry. We'll take care.

197
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,201
Well, when you say we do
 you mean you and your husband?

198
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,705
No, my daughter. He's deceased.

199
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,790
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

200
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,168
Please, son of a bitch
 just wouldn't listen.

201
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,421
We mean he smoked a pack of cigarets
 every two hours.

202
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,214
A pack here, a pack there.

203
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,216
Eventually I packed his ass in a coffin.

204
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,385
Oh, well, I got to go.

205
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,054
Well, you know, maybe
 I will let you write the leaves.

206
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,683
You know what? I just remembered
 that my rake is broken.

207
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,185
I got one you can use.

208
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,752
Oh, oh, oh, Liberal Party rule.

209
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:47,371
Oh, shit. Six. To.

210
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,175
Hello? Yeah. Hello, is Mr. Basel.

211
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,552
No, this is Mrs.

212
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,429
Barnes. Can I help you?

213
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,349
No, no. Actually, I need to speak to Mr.

214
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,977
Barnes because I was return
 a phone call yesterday.

215
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,065
There must be a mistake.

216
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,110
My husband passed a year ago.

217
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,450
I'm sorry to hear that.

218
00:21:25,701 --> 00:22:51,078
The problem. Girl, are you.

219
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,915
You know, I tell you later.

220
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:01,046
Oh, we might be getting out of here.

221
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,674
Oh, I don't make that.

222
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:10,055
It comes when you want to take, you know,
 you could go, OK.

223
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,266
I feel a bit thin there as well.

224
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,687
Drinks in three.

225
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,150
Want you, baby daddy, how

226
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,570
are you going to be OK?

227
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,988
I'm fine. Go on, girl.

228
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:38,208
OK, bye. Here you go,

229
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,921
bye, girl. OK, gang.

230
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,565
Yeah, you don't fix the trees.

231
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,524
Oh, shit, you too young?

232
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,358
No, no, no, no way.

233
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:42,772
No age limit on money. Cool. For us.

234
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,863
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

235
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,908
Listen, I don't want to I don't want to
 have sex, I just wanted to talk to you.

236
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,536
That's all your time.

237
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:01,541
OK, how are you?

238
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,794
You come here often
 and twenty five minutes.

239
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,466
All right. What's your name?

240
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:15,722
Not important. You are you married.

241
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,517
This is a freaking interview.

242
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,115
How old are you?

243
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,871
I'm 25. Please. All right.

244
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,792
I'm 18. Oh, God.

245
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,294
Same age as my daughter.

246
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:50,674
You have a daughter. I wasn't a.

247
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:56,763
Her name is hard to pronounce,
 I spell it for you and a Y dbg.

248
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,768
You know why the P.

249
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,315
None of your damn business, fool.

250
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,196
OK. All right. You got me,

251
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,365
you got me. That was good.

252
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,504
What are you doing here?

253
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,512
What do you think?

254
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,473
I think you don't want to be here
 any more than I do.

255
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,113
Go home, baby. Listen,

256
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,157
wait a minute, I just wanted to.

257
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,747
I just need to talk to you for a minute.

258
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,058
Oh, boy, got herself a real winner.

259
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,607
Love this. Yeah, me, too. And.

260
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,279
Take the damn head off.

261
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,659
What can you call in?

262
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,828
Oh, thanks for the ride.

263
00:27:43,828 --> 00:28:00,011
Yeah. Got a game. Yo.

264
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,764
Hey, how are you doing?

265
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,225
Uh, listen, I was walking by your house
 and I noticed that

266
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,019
your lawn needs some professional rock.

267
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,397
I'll go get my mom. No, I we like.

268
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,902
You talk to your boy,
 you need to learn how to drive

269
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:19,489
you damn near ran
 you over heels in a hurry, hurry.

270
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,283
No, no, no. You need
 to check his ass up on that.

271
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,412
You don't even understand.

272
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,123
I understand what I saw.

273
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,001
I got to go inside.

274
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,879
Now, wait a sec. Yeah.

275
00:28:34,879 --> 00:29:01,322
You ain't even get your name. Oh. Oh.

276
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:50,955
That makes me smell so much.

277
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,802
Missed the sweet tooth,
 I really don't know about you

278
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,639
last time I heard you went to jump
 in the shoes that you back on the streets

279
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:11,476
out to the same bank, you got punched
 in the face by the man who found the plate

280
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,939
because you broke in this car
 and stole all these tapes that 20 days

281
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,025
you should come for breaking your parole
 when get out. Five o'clock.

282
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,653
She stopped talking.
 I was waiting on the phone.

283
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,488
Yo, man, pick it up, man.

284
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,783
Milward, you follow me? Oh, good job.

285
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,035
You too young to be hard, man.

286
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:34,165
Are you too old to be acting
 like a plumber back to the Persian Gulf?

287
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,043
Oh, man, if you pick the perfect,

288
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,587
next time you touch me,
 I'll look your ass and I'm telling you.

289
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,217
Oh, it's funny, Niz.

290
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:44,926
I'm sorry, Doug.

291
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,220
It ain't funny, is Alame. No disrespect.

292
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,639
I know. I know, man.

293
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,392
Two weeks later, Sanshin.

294
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,769
Now there you go.

295
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,481
It's a nice person, you person.

296
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,995
Sidney Lumet, why? Why?

297
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,206
Because I want to know that's
 why when I tell you

298
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,542
so get lost. Your age big.

299
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,589
Yeah. Yeah. Yuck,

300
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,757
yuck, yuck, yuck.

301
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,724
You'll be mad to make some quick changes.

302
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,310
Robots really help.

303
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,896
See, I told you need one.

304
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,607
Well, yeah, I think his ass is ready
 to roll with it.

305
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:45,028
So let's do it. So, fellas,
 I mean, what do you want, man?

306
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,614
And I want you to quit
 hanging out with these fools

307
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,657
and I'm not going to talk about it.

308
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:53,119
Well, Hirko, for me and you, too, I mean.

309
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,662
Well, you get all this money from.

310
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,122
Don't worry about it.

311
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,874
We're for it. You don't work.

312
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,168
You sell drugs. And I know
 you sell drugs, man.

313
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,962
I don't want my man involved in that.
 And you ain't my daddy, nigga.

314
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,673
You're right. You're right.

315
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,133
I ain't your daddy.

316
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,844
But I know your mom and your sister, too.

317
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,972
And I know you ain't gonna make it.

318
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,016
Can I talk to you like that?

319
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:21,230
I got to go. Tony,

320
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,944
what you think you'll be mad

321
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,781
Silversun for that nigga,
 how do you hate me?

322
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,870
Oh, man, you ever fronted me in front of
 my friends like that again, nigga.

323
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,914
The knuckleheads ain't your friends, man.

324
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,124
How do you know my family?

325
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,295
All right. I was bluffing
 about the fat lady.

326
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,881
But listen to me.

327
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,384
Oh, you don't want to get involved
 with what they doing?

328
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,134
I mean, don't tell me what.

329
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,053
I won't let you quit, man.

330
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,930
Were you was running back dead.

331
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,891
You should be playing
 sports me when I'm playing those sports

332
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,521
just like no. All right.

333
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:06,484
Lighten up because I'm on your side,
 brother, and whatever.

334
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,574
You play video games. What?

335
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,618
I said, do you play video games?

336
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,913
The best nigga you ain't never played me.

337
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,916
Quit talking and put your money
 where your mouth is.

338
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,919
And let's do this. Come on.

339
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,967
Oh, oh, oh, Liberal Party room.

340
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,596
Little where we got him.

341
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,433
Yeah, like I said, the best nigger.

342
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,185
Oh, get up, get up. Yeah, there you go.

343
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:46,482
Double or nothing, you know, man,
 I ain't never lost this game until now.

344
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,194
Look, I'm on my side. Yeah, yeah.

345
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,072
Tell you what, I think what happened
 was the former Comptroller

346
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:56,451
of America would make up my name,
 make excuses, bromate excuse.

347
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:01,247
I play your year, but I, you know,
 change those rules through the government.

348
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,832
Funny. Real good.

349
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,001
I tell you, don't call me no more.

350
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,586
I mail the check on Monday night.

351
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,379
If you didn't get it, it's not my fault.

352
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,051
Mama, did you really send them that?

353
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,636
I just said, shit,

354
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,930
let me start dinner.

355
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,187
That would be your mommy temple.

356
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:35,406
But I hope this thing will move.

357
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,908
Where is your mother?

358
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,078
I'll be right back, OK.

359
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,081
Marcus, go it in.

360
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,418
And before you cut me off again,
 I want to know what

361
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,754
the other night was about.
 I don't know what you mean.

362
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,465
You call me at the blue talking about
 you want to come walk with me?

363
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,259
I owe you an explanation. Little.

364
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,137
Well, excuse me, queen bee.
 I didn't mean to get in your business.

365
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,557
You do? Because you know, Lizzie. I know.

366
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,937
But I will tell you this,

367
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,856
you have a beautiful little girl in there,
 and you need to find something else

368
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,359
to do with your life
 besides putting your ass on the line

369
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,485
every night like you do it.

370
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,154
I had my reasons.

371
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:18,699
Well, Thelma, we all have our reasons.

372
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,328
I'm going to tell you something

373
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,706
I have not told anybody.

374
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,333
Pam, where you are?

375
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,085
I've been there.

376
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,465
I walked those same streets.

377
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:38,344
You're walking. I was lucky enough
 to get out the life in one piece.

378
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,846
A lot of my friends weren't.

379
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,265
And that's before AIDS
 and all that other shit.

380
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,683
Well, sit down. I'm not stupid.

381
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,977
I'm a how to protect myself.

382
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,646
Against lunatics.

383
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,817
Baby, get out before it's too late.

384
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,865
I'm too small to play, man.

385
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,451
And besides, I'm like none of them
 basketball nerds. Oh, yeah.

386
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,496
But look it out. And Iverson,
 man, he sure quit.

387
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,583
You can be just like him, man. You play.

388
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,002
Nah, man, I didn't play ball.

389
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:11,961
I regret it, though.

390
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,839
I do. Because, you know,
 I think I could at home

391
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,801
play anything like you played them days
 where you made the right choice

392
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,889
instead of and you know,
 you don't want to tell you, man, you

393
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,934
made a good move,
 man, walking away from new cast.

394
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,021
Because like I say, man,
 you don't want to get involved with that.

395
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,608
You know, I just wanted to make
 some quick money in and out.

396
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,735
Nobody had to know about.

397
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,945
Whatever you do in the dark,

398
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:42,325
it's always going to come to the light
 as to the vicious cycle of life.

399
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,327
I don't understand.

400
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,080
Well, let's say you sell drugs.

401
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,457
You don't get caught.

402
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,125
Playing his elbow.

403
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,380
Something, she was a nice day.

404
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:02,094
I like that. Perhaps caters to me.

405
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,058
I promised them I'd never take it off.

406
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:14,190
What is your password? He's dead.

407
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,031
So vacuum cleaners.

408
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:29,205
Yeah. You him now.

409
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,378
I mean. We are against.

410
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:44,679
Yeah. My pops is dead to me. For.

411
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,809
I guess as some we got to come.

412
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,815
I got to go there.

413
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,625
Off the record, I can say

414
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,503
I got a tip, but, you know, bribes
 every time I speak.

415
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:22,967
I'm about to throw simply, you know,
 what have you had have been running past

416
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:27,471
what they were calling for
 an even playing a war man like.

417
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,266
I've got talent and I make
 you show me some.

418
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,644
I know you got some men
 don't even play sports.

419
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,771
No, warmack. And I'm tired.

420
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,690
I know you type. But you know what?

421
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,442
We got to do one more to do one more.

422
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,527
Down, down, down on Valmont.

423
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,071
Come on, baby. Let's get on the plane.

424
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,950
Wake up. This is my man.

425
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,203
For me, it's we just know.

426
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,290
I'm forty two. All right.

427
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,541
I know you want the ring.

428
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:59,879
How can I be too young and beat it
 if you don't want to believe me?

429
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:06,510
There's no way you
 could catch like to make sure

430
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:29,992
say slim, but. What? The.

431
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,537
I think we've been spending
 too much time together, but

432
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,623
I'll see when you bring me home from work.

433
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,086
So why don't you ever hook me up?

434
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,964
Hook you up how you know, like sex.

435
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,135
Like Give me head, cause that's lefty.

436
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,515
Have you ever done it before? No.

437
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,102
So, you know, it's nasty.

438
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,899
Well, just to let you know, OK,

439
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,235
the popular girls
 are really filling me now.

440
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:09,907
I mean, what you expect new Covid rich
 family just got accepted to Mooresboro.

441
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,203
Not bad for a 17 year old.

442
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,707
That's set up to take control

443
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:22,128
of this relationship from here on out.

444
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,713
Now make it hard.

445
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,217
Look, I could get a
 pretty girl took me up.

446
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,344
I have to take any
 more of this shit from you,

447
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,640
Stephanie. I'm talking to you.

448
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:39,145
Don't walk away from me
 when I'm talking to you.

449
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,648
I'm Kenny Clarke. I hate you.

450
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:47,736
See what you made me do? Yo, I saw it.

451
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:56,078
Stop getting to know my mama.

452
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,458
Too bad girl. Get your ass out of here.

453
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,669
Let me see your raps.

454
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:13,804
Look out. Get to.

455
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:24,899
Can't just put this on the back,
 you just hold it there.

456
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,195
Who are you? Somebody
 just saved your life?

457
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,780
No, he ruined my relationship.

458
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,782
Forget that nerd.

459
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,993
God gave me this to swallow.

460
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,662
Give it here. Give it here.
 Put some ice in it.

461
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:39,288
How are you? Well.

462
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:56,055
You don't remember me, do you?

463
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:02,311
I stopped by the house a few days ago
 to rake the leaves. You remember?

464
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,690
We're not allowed to have strangers
 in the house when my mother's not here.

465
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,775
He stands, Stephanie.

466
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,321
No, he's not. This
 is my house, too. Hey, whoa.

467
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:17,576
I don't want any trouble, OK,
 so I just bounce you out.

468
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,996
Yeah, I get what you. You

469
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,626
trust me, I know that for. Much to Gervin.

470
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,146
What about it? So,

471
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,900
you know, we rabinoff

472
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,198
make it quick. Hi.

473
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,157
Let me get straight to the point.

474
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:01,996
I remember back when we was talking shop

475
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,165
for your podcast.

476
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,377
I got some business
 to take care of real quick.

477
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,463
I'll be right back. We're ready.

478
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,215
Megan, you've got to go outside.

479
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,884
It was cold outside.

480
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,805
Fuck, boy right there. I'll be back

481
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:30,691
with. I, me, me understand why he is
 in with this prophecy.

482
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,444
A born leader from
 the trauma of Jamie Foxx.

483
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,656
I never gave up walking up a whale,

484
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:41,994
never met in New York
 and never came out with the best of me.

485
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,247
I'll be a cheater to the Japanese
 because I'm a writer,

486
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:56,717
a muck around. Where are you going?

487
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,556
Detroit motherfuckers
 thought they can conquer us. Not here.

488
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,559
So what was wrong with you?

489
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,728
Get your fucking hands off
 of what's wrong.

490
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,855
I tell you. No more join.

491
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,273
What do you mean?

492
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,193
No, to kill a man? And so are you.

493
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,030
And in 10 seconds,

494
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,575
you ask to be a dead man.

495
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,411
Ten, nine. Put it down.

496
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:28,916
Let them do a shot,
 ain't gonna sit here for eight seven.

497
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,084
I got it under control.

498
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:34,338
Mention it in the first fucking place,
 Zengel say no. Oh, I know.

499
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:40,219
Six. By phone? Put it down,
 shut the fuck up, shop.

500
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:50,479
Three, two, one. The.

501
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,781
Johanns got some balls,
 but you're still a sucker.

502
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:07,413
I'm not sorry they got to finish
 with this little spousal argument and you

503
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:12,000
got to spells. It has got Böge,

504
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,088
you know, it suck.

505
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,006
Sorry about that, Doug.

506
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,634
But you know, what do I talk to
 you about? Right.

507
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,054
It's like a whirlwind.

508
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,535
So what you're doing is

509
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,037
I'm the one who Cudjoe, what?

510
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,916
Look, I need to explain to you
 what happened. Manukau, come in.

511
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,753
Look, me, you know what I mean?

512
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,087
What is what are you going, man?

513
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,465
No, no, no, wait.
 I just need to talk to you for a minute.

514
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,926
I got to tell you this man.
 Why can't you tell me here?

515
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,388
Listen to me. All right.
 I mean, you don't know.

516
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,723
I mean, come on, man.

517
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:11,393
You make me miss my favorite TV show.

00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:37,252

519
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:54,686
Bad dream, huh? Oh, baby,

00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,855

Look, man, I'm where I want to be.

00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:03,737
Now leave me alone.

00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,786

00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,329
It's teachers conference day.

528
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,205
Don't lie to me.

529
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,375
You want to bet? I don't want to bet you.

530
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:20,546
If you win, I'll let
 you have my Wartman radio. But if I win.

531
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,552
Oh, one, oh, very funny.

532
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:30,639
You know, you know, use a food, that's
 what you are, but you know what I'm mean.

533
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,226
Take your stupid bet because I know you
 like was no better school.

534
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,602
Far, far, far too.

535
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,813
One went to see mom.

536
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:40,899
How are you doing?

537
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:44,361

538
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,117

00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,661
Thank you. Now, the full.

00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,751
And front of. Lucky what?

541
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,463
Someone says no one knows

542
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,217
where all the towels he ripped my shirt,
 my it just got me the shirt.

543
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,052
He ripped his shirt.

544
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,222
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

545
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,975
Actually, why is your sister
 raking the leaves, man?

546
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,020
There is one to keep our model that crazy.

547
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,022
This call will come.

548
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,857
So you got your sister.

549
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,233
What do you mean to call?

550
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,694
Do you news? Are you.

551
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:31,575
Hey, you. You need me help. No, thank you.

552
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,578
Give me a raise.

553
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,497
You made a rake, not a rake leaves

554
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,918
or take me but an hour to do all this.

555
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,252
Would you do me a favor?

556
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,923
Would you bring me
 a partner like 30 minutes, please?

557
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,721
I don't like your friend.

558
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,973
You don't like you either.

559
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,617
Thank you, ma'am. Appreciate it.

560
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:12,259
Oh. Oh, God, it's so bad.

561
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,970
And I was hoping maybe I could walk.

562
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:20,017
Oh, no, no, no, I never fall in love
 because that's a no no.

563
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,021
I mean. And she then switched again.

564
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:27,107
Oh, me, we I have to

565
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,527

566
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,322
I know. I fucked around
 and did a lot of cool smas do the same

567
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:38,243
with mistakes going through a little bit
 every bit as seen research.

568
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,329
Looking good, looking good.
 So let's fuck tonight, girl.

569
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,041
I want to make you laugh
 and I have to do something.

570
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,710
I want to keep a world
 of different things.

571
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,630
And you just seem to know
 I want to get your sex.

572
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,926
Yes, you'll get it soon. And attached to

574
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:09,274
So come on. A small girl, Roxane.

575
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,943
Was that right? Hey, what's happening?

576
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:17,115
Look, Shawn, I need to talk to you alone.

577
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,244
I don't keep secrets from my girl, man.

578
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:26,374
What's up, baby talk?

579
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,295
It's like I was telling you earlier
 and I thought I was joking, man.

580
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,840
But I'm turning myself in a shot.

581
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,718
Still go on. Believe you,

582
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:41,014
believe it or not. Oh, man.

583
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,683
Oh, no, no, no. OK,

584
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,937
I'll play along with you for now.

585
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,606
Be safe. Is this you are serious.

586
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,609
Do you realize I can get in trouble
 for this shit, too?

587
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,111
That's what I'm telling you now, man.

588
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,153
Get out of town, man.

589
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,614
Lay low or some damn. Can we smoke now?

590
00:51:58,698 --> 00:51:59,991
Shut the fuck up.

591
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,576
Fuck you, nigga.

592
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,536
I'm telling you,

593
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:06,164
this girl was speak straight
 from the bottom to the top of the list.

594
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,791
What the shit, man?

595
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,335
Hey, man. You probably would have
 been better off not even telling me that

596
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,671
I'm changing my sheets.

597
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,131
And Zakin don't like it. Even

598
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,759
when I listen, I
 got to do what I had to do.

599
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,596
All right. We're going to make

600
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:30,856
sure you wake up and so do we.

601
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:43,785
At that moment, I
 lost my best friend for good.

602
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,246
I didn't know who he was anymore.

603
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,416
And to tell you the truth,
 I don't think he knew even.

604
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,550
What the fuck you gonna let him
 get away with that shit?

605
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,594
Shut the fuck up.

606
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,720
We don't know. Shit.

607
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,015
Leave me this open mic and let them know.

608
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:09,060
Hit with Roll-Up.

609
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:24,034
The reason I'm going to say.

610
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,496
I'm going to say.

611
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,922
And I doubt I'm losing my mind.

612
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:41,343
Have you tried to make your right
 in front of my eyes, tear me down?

613
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:47,766
I don't know that I'm lieto
 I'm a psychopathic killing the victim.

614
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,267
He put on a toilet.

615
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:52,812
He had a. I could feel the
 devil taking over my soul.

616
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:58,693
And then I started thinking about
 the past, about how many steps on the.

617
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:05,283
Exactly, welcome pointed to the tactic
 to deprive the poor to back up

618
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:09,204
what it was up to Pakistan

619
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,332
to see now what the fuck are you playing?

620
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,793
My name is Zacharie.

621
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,920
They say with Sankari.

622
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,383
OK, James, got you on the way to talk.

623
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,344
You know, my man's right
 to do just my nurse

624
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,763
some nagging thought
 to cause us some problems.

625
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,932
What kind of problems?

626
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,767
No, I flew with Jack last year.

627
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,144
I remember that flew hijacked last year.

628
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,855
He feels guilty now

629
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:39,109
when to turn himself in to the police.

630
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,865
That's the shit I'm talking about.

631
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,368
You better check your boy. I do.

632
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,830
I know, I know. I'm shaking,

633
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,543
letting fucked up my daddy was not.

634
00:54:57,043 --> 00:55:01,131
But this is getting things up
 that come to this point and it will be

635
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,050
gone. And I told you, you

636
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,678
should let me smoke
 and take a long time ago.

637
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,930
Shut up. Little the fuck.

638
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,974
Did you come to get sober?

639
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,518
Knocked up, though.

640
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:49,846
They took. Well, so does I mean,
 I was just on my way out there, man.

641
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,433
I'm a fucking zappacosta.

642
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,685
Baret zappacosta, huh?

643
00:55:56,247 --> 00:55:58,000
You ain't got no enough fags.

644
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:00,670
(Gunshot noises)

645
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,861
And we got to love for you.

646
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,894
By Kenny Clarke.

647
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,854
Don't you even think about it?

648
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,023
Are you do it? Getting rid of Kenny.

649
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,691
Oh, well, we get the point.

650
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,944
Kenny is out of your life forever.

651
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:49,406
Don't burn down my damn house.

652
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,785
Oh, you have on your contact list.

653
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,412
My glasses are broken.

654
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:59,082
Oh, don't you look beautiful, H.V.

655
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,543
look, are you study?

656
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:05,171
He's been doing all types of crazy things
 since Dwight came along.

657
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,715
Oh, who's this? I keep my man on track.

658
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,552
Ain't nobody keeping me on that
 kind of track. Who are you?

659
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,721
Oh, he was yelling at you, Mama Messara.

660
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,141
Shut up, both of you. Shut up.

661
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,393
You giving me a headache?

662
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,313
Don't leave me here where I have to go.

663
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,023
You work too much, Ma.

664
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:27,735
Oh, you make mommy mad
 if you don't stop messing with me.

665
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,530
My wife says that is right. I do.

666
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,199
OK, listen, we're going
 to get over this hump very soon.

667
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,576
I'm going to be late.

668
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:39,539
I think I'm on the love you. That fight.

669
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,599
Who is it? It's me. Good.

670
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,069
Hey, is is HB asleep yet?

671
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,571
Yeah, it's 11 o'clock.

672
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,991
Oh, man, I'm sorry,
 I didn't even know what time it was.

673
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,912
I just I'm so I've been going through
 a whole lot with my boys and stuff.

674
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,293
Your glasses, because I

675
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:28,296
don't fill in this hole,
 no glasses look like they're broken.

676
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,756
They'll be fixed tomorrow.

677
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,634
Well, you know, speaking of
 tomorrow, you got any plans?

678
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,641
Well, I suppose.

679
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:43,603
Oh, yeah, you sound real busy, Stephanie.

680
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,565
It's all right, you can smile.

681
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,067
Well, listen, check this out.

682
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,986
I got to go to Ohio State
 and I was one if you want to roll with me.

683
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,574
Look, I'm not going to take
 no for an answer.

684
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,451
Well, why are you going there?

685
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,871
Well, see, I supposed to
 start this fall and

686
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,833
you know, some stuff came up,
 but I got to just have a few loose ends.

687
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,462
Well, what came up?

688
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,798
You know, you ask a lot of questions.

689
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,050
Listen, I will pick you up
 tomorrow afternoon.

690
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,345
We'll be back tomorrow evening. All right.

691
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:32,193
With that, could you grab some de de?

692
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,827
The story to be told is really,

693
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,121
you know, they have

694
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,666
about a hundred times. Yeah.

695
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,167
You know, I figured you wouldn't.

696
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,838
But Castleman know,
 you go like check that out. Oh.

697
00:59:56,134 --> 01:00:01,431
O oh, b. We can't

698
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,141
write that today.

699
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,938
Value for the land is.

700
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:16,821
What? What? I ain't going anywhere
 till I find out something.

701
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:21,492
Why are you so quiet?

702
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,913
You graduated last spring. Right

703
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,874
now, you can go to college

704
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,044
and I don't know,
 I haven't really thought about it yet.

705
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,631
OK, let's say let's think about it now.

706
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,841
You could go to college. OK.

707
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,177
You can imagine anything you wanted to.

708
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:42,597
What would it be? I don't know.

709
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,600
What do you like to do?

710
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,812
Nothing really. OK.

711
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,565
What's your favorite subject?

712
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:56,027
I don't know. You don't know.

713
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:20,134
All right. Hey, are you ready?

714
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,846
Some finish. English.

715
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,059
You mean that's my favorite subject?

716
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:34,148
Oh, right, right,
 right, right. Oh, English.

717
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,985
That's a good measure, right? Yeah.

718
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:40,321
Really? Oh, yeah.

719
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:42,573
See, Stephanie, do you get
 the English major?

720
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,325
You can do all kinds of stuff.

721
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:47,704
You can you can become a writer,
 become a journalist.

722
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,706
You know, you can even go to law school.

723
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,959
You ever thought about the.

724
01:01:56,462 --> 01:02:00,758
Money's been so tight, you know, my mother
 can't really afford this right now.

725
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:26,200
Oh. Stephanie, can I ask you a question?

726
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,663
You feel about what
 your mother does for a living.

727
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:33,583
What do you mean?

728
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,627
But, you know, I mean, does
 it does it bother you

729
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,465
while it being a waitress
 and tell her bother me?

730
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,968
Wait a minute. Is that what
 your mother does?

731
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,637
Yeah. So what do you think she did?

732
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,931
No, I you know, I didn't know.

733
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,225
But what I thought she.

734
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,061
You know what is not important
 and what does that even if

735
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,940
she's actually looking for a better job?

736
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:02,153
A. Since my dad died,

737
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,531
she had to start from scratch.

738
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:10,411
I mean, we almost lost
 everything. What she doing

739
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,665
nothing. My father was the type
 who believe that

740
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:18,044
a man was supposed to work
 and provide for his family

741
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:21,005
and it was a woman's job
 to stay home and raise a kid.

742
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,342
So do you believe.

743
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:31,599
I don't know what I believe in. Stack.

744
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:37,230
You know, I think that
 you really like a smart person.

745
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:39,440
No, I'm not. I'm sure I knew that
 when I first met you.

746
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,527
And I believe that your father would have

747
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:45,530
wanted you to make something of your life.

748
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,615
So you make him proud.

749
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:51,619
Make him proud of the daughter
 that he raised. All right.

750
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:58,543
Come on. You hungry?

751
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,588
I'm hungry, I eat out.

752
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:23,568
They didn't use umbrellas.

753
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:36,080
W o o o o o. Oh, yeah. Oh, boy.

754
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,041
Aw, Stephanie, thanks so much for coming.

755
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:43,546
You're welcome. You have fun.

756
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,215
Good, good. Because,
 you know, I didn't want you to be bored.

757
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,094
Hey, Stephanie, why are you so sure?

758
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:52,847
Let's see that desk.

759
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,057
What you should do that more often.

760
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,518
It is too late because I already saw it.

761
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,815
Oh, man. Well, look, I better I better
 get out of here, so give me a hug.

762
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:12,408
So thanks again.

763
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,124
Hey, baby, I've been looking
 for you all day.

764
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,460
Hey, man, didn't
 I tell you? Don't come around anymore.

765
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:25,463
Come on, man. This isn't between me,
 but I can make it.

766
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,924
Yeah, honey, you should not be here.

767
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,010
And I love you. And I want you back.

768
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,974
Well, wait a minute,
 I think I need to let you answer.

769
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,360
So let me say that I have.

770
01:05:55,743 --> 01:06:21,102
Stephanie? Can we get the word

771
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,397
out for cough drops

772
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:29,276
the drop? Motherfucker.

773
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:39,578
So is it true, is that I don't know
 what you're talking about, man.

774
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:41,497
I don't know what you're talking about.

775
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,583
I only know what you've got me here, man.

776
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:54,010
Oh. Eat your ass up

777
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,391
to pull the motherfucking bitch,
 move on me, drink.

778
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:03,477
What are you going to deport me?

779
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:07,815
Look to me. I was just
 kidding, man. All right.

780
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,152
Get the fuck out of here, man.

781
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,778
What do you think?

782
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,239
I'm a joke or something.

783
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:27,209
Look, if you lied to me.

784
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:36,886
Come back. And I'm a Q. Chose.

785
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,954
He's trying to use it to make you special.

786
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,917
Honey, is that you?

787
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:11,045
Come on, baby, I want you
 to meet somebody.

788
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,255
At Anderson. And this is my son, Andre.

789
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:15,466
I don't drink. Hey,
 how you doing, Miss Anderson?

790
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:17,802
We were just finishing up
 dinner here. Are you hungry?

791
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:21,555
I'm going to fix
 you up like. No, I'm OK. OK.

792
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:26,811
Well, by the way, as head of personnel
 at the heart of plant, he does the hiring.

793
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:30,439
So if you're looking
 for that part time job,

794
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,650
come on, tell me.

795
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:35,736
Would you like some more wine? Sure.

796
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:38,823
I'll be right back. Wow.

797
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:45,371
I think your mother is trying
 to get you a job,

798
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:47,706
Yahaya, right now.

799
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:50,626
As a matter of fact, we are interested.

800
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,212
Give me a call. Okay.

801
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,633
Do you have both men and women?

802
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,970
Yeah. Yeah. We need to talk.

803
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,806
Mama, fix me a plate.

804
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,683
It's funny. You will be a man.

805
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:08,144
I got two French mothers
 looking for a job. She said.

806
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:14,733
Oh, where you play?

807
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:15,526
Talk to the coach.

808
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:18,487
He said it was all good.
 What position to guard?

809
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,697
I don't know. Oversimple.

810
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:22,616
Oh, eight feet as small boy. Covid,

811
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,247
where do you know how much you me a fart.

812
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,040
I'm just proud of you, man.

813
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,001
I listen to things. You go.

814
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,336
You remember, though,
 your education comes first.

815
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,213
You don't have to show some intensity.

816
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:38,382
You hear me? You don't think
 I'm on crack out there?

817
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:40,551
That's a bad comparison, man.

818
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,136
That's a real bad Kompass.

819
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:46,515
It does come out to be,
 I don't know, a minute, Stephanie.

820
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:51,520
Yeah. People wait for you
 all go up in the river less than a minute.

821
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:56,525
All right. Hey. I'm proud of you, man.

822
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:10,623
All right. Hello.

823
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:14,376
OK, I'll be down in a minute. Oh, OK.

824
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:38,567
Nancy? Hey, hey.

825
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:40,778
Is your mother home?

826
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,030
No, she's working. Oh, OK.

827
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:47,910
Well, I just wanted to drop by
 and give you that we got a friend

828
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,204
who works at the Honda plant
 and they're gonna be hiring.

829
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:54,333
So tell your mother to call him
 at Anderson. Who's he?

830
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,377
It's just a friend of family.

831
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:02,925
OK. Oh, but I had
 some stuff I wanted to show you.

832
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,637
Can I come by later? Come on, man.

833
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:14,687
Yeah, I guess I'm OK.

834
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,398
You know, all of

835
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,025
HP knows, right?

836
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:23,237
Yeah, yeah, HP, no, I won't go.

837
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:37,001
The Olympic Games won't go.

838
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:43,132
I bet you guys will get aspirin's.

839
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,302
You will find that

840
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:49,305
you will feel Zacharie

841
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:54,476
Salana paying money to do some fun

842
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,522
and a nice for you.

843
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,651
I'ma need you to follow Gazzaniga.

844
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:09,325
Oh, Dre. Dre. Right. Why?

845
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:12,453
Because I'll say so.

846
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,621
I get the fuck up and get up out of here.

847
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:22,129
They give me my my
 fuck away quest as well.

848
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:34,141
And at this one,
 I'm eligible for financial aid.

849
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:37,936
But this one has a great creative
 writing program.

850
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:40,064
But then this one is closer to home.

851
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,565
So I'll be able to take care of my mom.

852
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:47,321
I'm not talking too much you no.

853
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:50,574
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

854
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:54,036
I haven't had much motivation
 to do anything since I left high school.

855
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:56,830
Till now. Yes. Now

856
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:04,004
I believe in hard work.

857
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:07,800
I just think that, you know,
 I need the opportunity to prove myself.

858
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:15,099
Well, I look forward to seeing you
 tomorrow at nine a.m.. Thanks.

859
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:22,147
OK, I think I could get
 used to working on cars.

860
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,108
You got the job.

861
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,151
Have an interview tomorrow at 9:00 a.m..

862
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:29,405
Congratulations to you.

863
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,825
So what am I going to meet this trade?

864
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:36,662
Well, I'm cooking dinner on Friday.

865
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:40,541
Excuse me, the last person you did that
 for was your father.

866
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,627
He must be special.

867
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:50,259
His mom to give me

868
01:13:50,259 --> 01:14:01,520
that. Fingers ready.

869
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:13,824
But my choices are Ohio State,

870
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:18,245
Cleveland State or UCLA,
 whichever one has the best

871
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:21,999
English literature program in the South
 Ohio State. Yeah.

872
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:25,294
So Buckeye momma,
 you know, he got accepted there

873
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,503
and isn't even going.

874
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:28,839
He's not a true Buckeye.

875
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:32,926
Why not? Well, I just you know,
 I take care of some stuff.

876
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,428
Oh, sounds important.

877
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:39,600
Oh, you know, as I say, you I got a buddy
 and he's getting ready.

878
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,726
Some video games, man.

879
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,395
I'm much. Don't worry about that. Okay.

880
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:48,525
I'll make a deal with you for every, say,
 five points. Did you score?

881
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:49,776
I get you a game.

882
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:51,945
Guess you're not getting any shot up.

883
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,615
The man. All right.
 We'll pick him up after the game.

884
01:14:55,115 --> 01:14:58,243
Are you sure we haven't met before.

885
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:00,162
Where does your mother work?

886
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,289
Oh, actually, my mother.

887
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:05,667
She works for an insurance company.
 Yeah, she's an executive assistant.

888
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,586
And you know, you want to play the guy?

889
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:10,088
No, he did not come here for that.

890
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:14,510
Later, I'll play later.

891
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,262
What church do you go to?

892
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:18,931
I go to Bethlehem.

893
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:25,687
So what do you look so familiar, mama?

894
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:27,439
It's really not that serious.

895
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,566
Oh, I'm sorry. You're right. You're right.

896
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,319
I guess I should help you with the dishes.

897
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:40,244
Hmm. You know what?

898
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:44,081
We have met before.

899
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:49,878
We was at a motel a while ago.

900
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,552
No, no, listen, don't worry, OK?

901
01:15:56,552 --> 01:16:00,514
Because I haven't told
 anybody and I won't.

902
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,777
What's going on?

903
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,406
Oh, nothing, nothing.

904
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,366
Your mother just wanted to

905
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,577
to make sure that was legit.

906
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:28,792
Well, is. We'll see.

907
01:16:44,224 --> 01:16:46,184
So what do you think?

908
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:53,108
No. Why not? The country

909
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:55,986
is the best thing
 that's ever happened to me before.

910
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,990
We didn't like them.

911
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:02,576
I got caught him all night.

912
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,580
Well, that was what Connie
 Mack hated myself.

913
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:12,169
And Joy is the complete opposite
 of what he's h.b.

914
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:16,089
The boy is studying law
 and he joined the basketball team.

915
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:19,301
And that's all because the trade.

916
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:22,387
How did he know I needed a job?

917
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:31,313
I told. No, you can't beat me.

918
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:37,944
So whatever, we can do some job tomorrow
 night, I, I be there tomorrow night.

919
01:17:38,111 --> 01:17:39,196
Don't forget about the bed.

920
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:42,324
I'm not going. You don't
 forget about the bed. I know.

921
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:47,162
Stephanie, could
 you excuse us for a minute, please?

922
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:55,712
Yeah. No, it's not that

923
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:59,132
I have to justify
 what happened that night.

924
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,844
This is. I understand, you know,

925
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:05,222
sometimes people make mistakes
 that they're sorry for.

926
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:07,015
I didn't make a mistake.

927
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:08,433
Listen, you know what?

928
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:11,103
I don't even know who that lady was in.

929
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:13,480
I mean, she had red hair.

930
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:17,442
I believe your hair is black.

931
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,660
Well, Lizzie Mizzy worth logit.

932
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:36,878
Yeah. Do I say I will? Thank you. OK.

933
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:44,302
Oh, I see. Well, think.

934
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:54,855
My mother's going to work later.

935
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:05,657
I'll call you. Yeah.

936
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,885
I drove around most at night
 thinking about the food.

937
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:29,139
Should I take responsibility
 for my actions like I set out to do,

938
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:32,976
or should I just walk away
 as if nothing happened and go to college?

939
01:20:41,461 --> 01:21:02,065
Hello. So. She be mad

940
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:04,943
if I went to the same colleges.

941
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:09,531
Not if you walk me to class.

942
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:12,784
I think your books.

943
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,891
We're not playing

944
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:41,354
Obama's team is it's a while
 before we got real on this.

945
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:43,690
Talk to me, Bill.

946
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,110
He's been kicking it
 with some girl named Stephanie Long.

947
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:50,071
The hell is that?

948
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:53,074
You know, it's the daughter of the man
 who share some thoughts.

949
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:58,705
Now, why the fuck would he be
 hanging around her? Hmm.

950
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:04,085
My guess who's going to confess to them
 first, then go to the public

951
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:09,049
school system. Blew his fucking head off
 when I had the chance.

952
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:13,011
Do you remember Kenny Clarke?

953
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:17,557
Yeah. I like Las Vegas making around
 a bath house the other night.

954
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,852
Hilman Stephany's the day.

955
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:22,896
I bet mad as hell. I mean, I'm

956
01:22:23,855 --> 01:22:24,814
probably willing to do

957
01:22:24,814 --> 01:22:29,444
anything for revenge. Perfect.

958
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:41,706
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

959
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:44,876
I thought that you was going
 to enforce a blood

960
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:46,878
supplement where he was taking too long.

961
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:49,255
I'm sorry. This is H.B.

962
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,174
Hey, it's been nice to meet you, baby.

963
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:54,594
Now, whether my son learned to play
 like that skills or not.

964
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:57,347
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

965
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:59,474
Now, what you have to have from I gave to.

966
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:01,977
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

967
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,396
What can I leave with him
 so I can pick up these games?

968
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:06,773
Did you go with his mother first?

969
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:08,692
I was fine. I have to make a quick stop.

970
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,527
I can grab it and use the car.

971
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:13,655
OK, I. It's very nice meeting you.

972
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:17,951
OK, except for. Stephanie?

973
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:41,975
Damn punk rock. Yo, yo, what's up, Zach?

974
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:45,895
I found Bitch at the Park
 Project is the main

975
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:48,982
thing on my head. Thanks, Mo.

976
01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:53,403
So you want me to stay?

977
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:55,530
Now, common link.

978
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,991
All right, baby, I cannot.

979
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,722
Scarface, he knows.

980
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:32,067
Ready to do this? Just from that.

981
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,820
You took your bra.

982
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:39,908
Factor, I think, come on, fucking.

983
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:44,496
You let him get away with that.

984
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:48,625
You motherfucker, sir.

985
01:24:49,667 --> 01:25:04,724
I'm ready, Doc. Flatback motherfucker.

986
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:08,269
Yeah, you like that.

987
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:14,067
Come up with nice guys.

988
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,448
But also sex and drugs

989
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:28,081
throughout the eight. Owning a scrap.

990
01:25:57,735 --> 01:26:00,947
Oh, don't you go with.

991
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,324
Oh, I know she's done.

992
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:20,550
No, and I'm not. Golf.

993
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:41,613
I can't believe it, man. I'm a murderer.

994
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:46,451
Feels good, don't it?

995
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:51,414
Yeah. Hey, what happened?

996
01:26:51,414 --> 01:26:54,542
You found the wrong car. Well,
 I promise to God.

997
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:55,835
And I thought of my own car.

998
01:26:55,835 --> 01:27:00,506
But she was the lady in there
 that was drys my mother.

999
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:04,427
Where are you going?

1000
01:27:04,427 --> 01:27:07,639
And I was a little boy
 in the backseat, too. Oh, boo.

1001
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:12,310
Yo, where your punk ass going?

1002
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,357
I can't live with what I've done, man.

1003
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:24,030
Just deal with. Yeah.

1004
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:04,362
I want 10 seconds.

1005
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,781
You wouldn't be surprised.

1006
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:08,825
It's not killer.

1007
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,493
Take off your coat.

1008
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:15,498
Stark count as my mother,
 you shot 10 drums.

1009
01:28:15,748 --> 01:28:18,001
You ain't count to at six.

1010
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:20,336
I don't hear you, son, to fuck up.

1011
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:24,215
Oh, so you too emotional,
 nigga. I told you to

1012
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:29,971
get the fuck off me. Look. Good.

1013
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:37,812
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,

1014
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:44,777
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

1015
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:57,498
You do got some balls,

1016
01:28:57,498 --> 01:29:00,543
but you still bitch to do it.

1017
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:02,670
I'm afraid to death.

1018
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,798
Do it right. Do it.

1019
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:21,481
That's right, you punk ass motherfucker,
 just like I thought you scared.

1020
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:26,027
We killed your mama
 and we come and kill your daddy gas, too.

1021
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,779
Nah, man up before we get to.

1022
01:30:20,873 --> 01:30:24,836
911 OPERATOR What is your emergency?

1023
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:57,034
Steph? Oh, I am so sorry.

1024
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:01,164
Are you OK? Yeah.

1025
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:02,540
Did they catch him?

1026
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:05,626
Oh, listen, I got to tell you guys.

1027
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:08,004
What is it, baby?

1028
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:12,967
The police will be here any minute

1029
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:16,179
for word for me.

1030
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:22,768
Let's listen. A year ago,

1031
01:31:23,519 --> 01:31:27,482
I got involved with some guys,
 and before I knew it,

1032
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:30,234
I had killed a man.

1033
01:31:30,526 --> 01:31:32,945
I don't think that was my. I don't know.

1034
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:35,364
I don't want to have anything
 to do with that.

1035
01:31:35,364 --> 01:31:37,867
No, listen. No, because there's more. OK,

1036
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:41,370
we don't need to hear anymore.
 No. Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

1037
01:31:41,537 --> 01:31:45,625
Before you hear this from anybody else,
 it's none of our business. Yes, it is.

1038
01:31:49,128 --> 01:31:54,800
Because, Stephanie. The coach of.

1039
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:02,350
And I'm so sorry.

1040
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,393
Is that true, Jane Symfony?

1041
01:32:04,393 --> 01:32:07,730
It was an accident,
 it was a complete accident. Tell you.

1042
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,941
Tell me it was an accident.

1043
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:12,568
It was a stupid, stupid game.

1044
01:32:12,568 --> 01:32:14,820
I did not. I swear to God,
 I didn't mean to do it.

1045
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:18,115
I didn't know that the government
 was going to get out of my house.

1046
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:20,034
I didn't know I could get out.

1047
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:22,119
I don't want to get them out of my

1048
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:27,375
sight. And you say
 the right to an attorney

1049
01:32:27,833 --> 01:32:30,920
and an attorney, one will be appointed
 by the state of Ohio.

1050
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:34,173
Of course, then these rights,
 if they've been read to you

1051
01:32:34,173 --> 01:32:36,467
and I go, are my.

1052
01:32:39,178 --> 01:32:40,346
How could you do this to me,

1053
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:43,891
try and figure out how could you do that?

1054
01:32:45,434 --> 01:32:53,150
I hate to tell you what that Salomé.

1055
01:32:53,859 --> 01:33:04,036
I trusted you. But.

1056
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:30,688
L. I joke. Joe? I mean, really?

1057
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:02,053
I like what I've been seeing out there.

1058
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:04,597
You guys want to get your act together.

1059
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:06,641
And I also heard
 you guys been cutting classes.

1060
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:10,353
You'll be sending the best as we can,
 if I find out that's true.

1061
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,231
Education because first Amarcord.

1062
01:34:15,566 --> 01:34:18,235
So let's go out, have a good practice
 so we could go to Saffi

1063
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:19,820
and kick some ass. Jay.

1064
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:29,622
So you've got this stretch of.

1065
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:31,332
Get some letters.

1066
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:35,086
Getting on an airplane
 or something like that.

1067
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:38,005
All right, let's go

1068
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:40,800
I want to see some intensity out there,
 that's the only way we're going to win.

1069
01:35:24,176 --> 01:35:25,428
We said we'll make it.

1070
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:26,595
Don't get tonight,

1071
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:31,183
Jack gets its own crack,
 but negatives with skullcaps, we punch it,

1072
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:35,312
we don't hit the mat and goes back
 last month when he thought his exact.

1073
01:35:36,772 --> 01:35:39,316
Don't get to like check gets it, though.

1074
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:42,319
My name is. So can we push?

1075
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:49,493
That you back here,
 well, me get you to talk to you, Shane,

1076
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:52,204
when they lock and load this funny
 out of a certain unity,

1077
01:35:52,204 --> 01:35:55,124
must shake things up,
 so be entertained by my brain.

1078
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:57,877
Fucking study on trying
 to hit the block with some chain

1079
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,755
would have opened up
 in my pocket with Dr Bang.

1080
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:04,383
I keep a clock up in my pocket
 in the socks to change careers.

1081
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:05,301
It doesn't stop them.

1082
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:09,305
Frames Covid miscellaneous
 quips, embracement, pocket change.

1083
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:12,391
You want more? Oh well, I think
 he was a soldier.

1084
01:36:12,516 --> 01:36:15,186
I had to lie for Bizo Range Rover.

1085
01:36:15,352 --> 01:36:17,980
You risk your fucking patissier
 like they shit up.

1086
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:20,733
But we don't need go.
 We just fix like this shit up.

1087
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:23,152
So when everybody fall we just don't know.

1088
01:36:23,152 --> 01:36:25,154
Get up, take a border shirt.

1089
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:28,407
Miniskirt says zip up.
 It seems like a setup now.

1090
01:36:28,407 --> 01:36:32,036
You really know like exactly
 if you got some shit it didn't get him off

1091
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:36,123
the real jack don't just like check
 gets its own crowd.

1092
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:39,418
What is the score.
 Can we put on shit we wiederholt.

1093
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:44,465
Is it that we simply

1094
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:51,722
don't get satellite
 check gets its. Getting.

1095
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:08,531
To do list is. Do.

1096
01:37:13,452 --> 01:37:17,748
Well, you know, you're just dozing, mom.

1097
01:37:17,998 --> 01:37:22,920
So you want to be Adobe,
 do I sit by a gun, just a bitch ass out

1098
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:26,924
attack on Twitter,
 luthe hot, ready to flip script.

1099
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:28,551
That's a really bad call.

1100
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:32,638
And you slipped some like six out of three
 shots of training for that.

1101
01:37:33,305 --> 01:37:34,974
And all you make is not with money.

1102
01:37:34,974 --> 01:37:39,144
Talks your message straight
 to Lebanese honeys, a house party.

1103
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:41,230
Now pass me to put it together.

1104
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:45,192
We're getting Ravu
 just a black man with no future plans.

1105
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,237
Not knowing just where you're due to stand
 on. Boom, boom, boom.

1106
01:37:48,237 --> 01:37:50,865
On your black ass.

1107
01:37:50,906 --> 01:37:55,202
You better look both ways back up
 and think that if you step back from the

1108
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:56,745
past, Black Diamond was dead.

1109
01:37:58,414 --> 01:38:01,166
So you think that's it? Yes, it is.

1110
01:38:01,166 --> 01:38:06,171
Silom to while they were doing
 it is too late to make the time.

1111
01:38:07,423 --> 01:38:17,641
Too late for you to. That. Gay.

1112
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:24,607
It is too late. I is too late to you.

1113
01:38:25,816 --> 01:38:28,736
Yeah. Oh, Jack is.

1114
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:30,946
Come on. I got to go.

1115
01:38:30,946 --> 01:38:33,532
He sat in the back of a pickup truck.

1116
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:36,535
How many minutes left? It's up
 to his fucking balls.

1117
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:38,579
Ready to die, John Wayne.

1118
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:41,874
However you want tasted the pussy,
 but you smell like

1119
01:38:42,416 --> 01:38:45,252
it cannot be the last shit you ever see.

1120
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:46,837
And I'll be damned

1121
01:38:46,837 --> 01:38:51,216
if you ever get the best of me
 with my nynex berretta bitch, please.

1122
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:54,219
Going out like that,
 you already buried three.

1123
01:38:54,219 --> 01:38:57,556
Ain't no turning back
 to see the evil in my eyes

1124
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,808
and now I'm about to take the snake for a.

1125
01:39:00,684 --> 01:39:03,312
It's do it sounds like a lady vampire

1126
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:06,190
sucking dick is going
 to take its fucking empire.

1127
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:37,262
Susan? Six June, July. She.
