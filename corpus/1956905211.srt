It's almost a pity.

1430
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:32,045
We even considered whether or
not you could somehow stay

1431
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:35,315
as an occasional stand-in.

1432
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:36,618
Yes.

1433
01:23:36,651 --> 01:23:41,623
She's grown a bit worn,
rather damaged.

1434
01:23:41,656 --> 01:23:43,056
We thought about it,
Ellen and I.

1435
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:44,692
We really did.

1436
01:23:44,726 --> 01:23:49,463

an impression on us both.

Yes, we discussed it,

1439
01:23:54,636 --> 01:23:59,439
but in the end, we decided
best stick with what you know.

1440
01:24:03,811 --> 01:24:07,649
Just a few minutes more,

After she was taken,
Ellen was inconsolable.

1454

She needed another another child
to fill the void.

1455
01:25:33,768 --> 01:25:38,271
We tried a number,
quite a number of girls,

1456

but none of them
were quite right enough.

A bit late, isn't it?

Oh, no. Three new bushes.
They make such delicious jam.
