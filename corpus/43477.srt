1
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,955
This is the Earth at a time
when the dinosaurs roamed...

2
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,514
a lush and fertile planet.

3
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,393
A piece of rock just six miles wide
changed all that.

4
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,909
lt hit with the force
of 10,000 nuclear weapons.

5
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,117
A trillion tons of dirt and rock
hurtled into the atmosphere...

6
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,993
creating a suffocating
blanket of dust...

7
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,429
the sun was powerless
to penetrate...

8
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,790
for a thousand years.

9
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,557
lt happened before.

10
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,597
lt will happen again.

11
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,232
lt's just a question of when.

12
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,628
Engineering director-- Engineering--

13
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,798
- Say again, Rudy.
- Houston, affirmative.

14
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,755
l'm gonna try again.

15
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,395
This time why don't we put in a hold
at nine. Cancel the pending resume.

16
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,040
Almost got it.

17
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,435
- Dennis, l'm almost there.
- Houston, Pete's looking real strong.

18
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,836
Okay, Pete. We got that coupling
on the board here now.

19
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,037
We'll give you the go-ahead
from down here when it's in alignment.

20
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,793
Sounds good.
Give me ten seconds.

21
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,791
His heart rate's racing.

22
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,836
- Hey, Pete. lt's Truman.
- Hey.

23
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,911
- How you doing up there, Hoss?
- Pretty good.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,468
Now, listen, Pete.
We got an eye on your meds here.

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,313
l'll give you a buffalo nickel
if you'll calm down just a little bit.

26
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,113
- Can you do that for me?
- Whatever you say.

27
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,630
Okay, uh, now we got plenty of time,
buddy, so don't you worry.

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,837
- Atlantis--
- Okay. Looking good here.

29
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,837
- He's got it.
- He'll be all right.
- Go ahead, Atlantis.

30
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,713
Roger that, Houston.
Suggest we start reeling Pete in.

31
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,117
- The system's down.
- No.

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,117
- What the hell is that?
- My Lord.

33
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,788
We're down.

34
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,673
Houston!

35
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,435
- We've lost all contact.
- What happened?

36
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,000
Stewart, play that tape back!

37
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,559
Houston!

38
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,152
Multiple bogeys! Multiple bogeys!

39
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,074
Sector five, niner. l have three.
Now five. Unidentified tracts.

40
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,998
- My screen's full.
- Multiple tracts headed towards
the Atlantic seaboard.

41
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,271
This could be
a surprise missile attack.

42
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,352
Mr President, the shuttle Atlantis
just exploded in space.

43
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,277
Okay, l want three groups!

44
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,595
One: internal malfunction.

45
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,148
Get the log tape. Start working back.
Maybe it's a glitch.

46
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,439
Two: l want NORAD Space Command and the
50th Tactical comparing all the space
junk you track in every orbit.

47
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,590
l want you to check, recheck
and then do it all over again.

48
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,553
Number three: wild cards,
anything and everything.

49
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,636
All right? Now, big Ross,
l want you to get on the telephone.

50
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,314
- Wake up 11,000 people.
- Right.
- Walt, get 'em going.

51
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,277
- Let's go!
- Karl!

52
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,397
Karl! Karl!

53
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,440
Karl! Your Stouffer's pot pie's
been on the table almost ten hours.

54
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,915
- l want a divorce.
- Dottie, l'm on to something big here.

55
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,112
l-l don't know what this is, but it
looks like something's burning up there.

56
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,028
Go get my phone book, will you?
Get my phone book. Get those names
of those guys from NASA.

57
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,711
Excuse me! Am l wearing a sign
that says, ''Karl's slave''?

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,316
Go get my goddam phone book!
Get the book!

59
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,158
Get the book!
Get the book!

60
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,269
Space Command is reporting negative.
That is zero global launches.

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,511
- lt might just be pieces of
the shuttle breaking up as it comes in.
- Yeah, it might be Santa Claus.

62
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,757
Until we get definitive, reliable
alternative confirmation, General...

63
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,791
we go to defcon three.

64
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,389
l'm getting ready for the big time

65
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,837
Someday you're gonna say
l'm big time too

66
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,359
Hey, little man! Little Richard!

67
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,752
Me and you, man!
We going to the top, baby! Big time!

68
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,314
Yo, man, l ain't gonna be ridin'
this bike the rest of my life!

69
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,149
You know what l'm sayin'?
l'm gettin' a motorcycle, baby.
We gonna travel in style.

70
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,430
l'm getting ready for the big time

71
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,915
Someday you're gonna say
l'm big time

72
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,715
Watch where you're goin'. l bet you,
none of y'all stop for brothers.

73
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,918
Slow down, Little Richard.
You've been ridin' all morning, man.
You gotta take a dump?

74
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,159
- We interrupt our regularly
scheduled programme to bring you
this special report.
- Hey, man, what happened?

75
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,439
The shuttle Atlantis exploded in space
at 3:47 a.m., Eastern Standard Time.

76
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,154
This morning
NASA officials are denying--

77
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,396
Hey! Hey, get! Get!

78
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,118
- That's my Godzilla. Come on, now.
- Yo, fool!

79
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,113
-Don't be kickin' Little Richard.
What the hell your problem?
-Now that dog's eating my Godzilla, man.

80
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,839
- And what's a little runt like you
gonna do about it?
- Get him, Richard. Sic him.

81
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,357
lf l wasn't a Christian,
l'd be throwin' your fat,
pineapple-eatin' ass through the window.

82
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,153
- Why we not going, huh?
- Well, y-y-you know why?
'Cause this is New York City.

83
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,511
Anything could have happened.
Look at that. Uh, let's see.
lt could have been a terrorist bomb.

84
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,916
lt could have been
a dead body somebody shot, stabbed.
And it's Friday. Payday too.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,231
- Somebody probably jumped,
didn't get their pay cheque. Yes.
- l want to go shopping.

86
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,275
Me too, but we ain't goin' nowhere
'cause this is a traffic jam.

87
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,635
- Little Richard.
- Hurry! Right over there!
- Go!

88
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,756
Yo, Little Richard!

89
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,671
Hang on, Little Richard!
l'm comin'!

90
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,959
Don't you worry about it.
l'm gonna get you outta there!

91
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,510
You okay, buddy?
Don't worry about it. Hang in there.

92
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,915
Somebody dial 911!

93
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,917
My screen's full!
They're all over the place!

94
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,350
Bogeys are breachin'
the atmosphere from Finland down
the North American seaboard.

95
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,393
Whoa!

96
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,192
Look at that!

97
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,194
Oh, we at war!

98
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,514
Saddam Hussein is bombin' us!

99
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,557
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

100
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,669
Get out of here!

101
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,836
Oh, my God!

102
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,556
Let's stay focused.
We need to map the trajectory now.

103
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,232
- That could take a week.
- Just find it, okay?

104
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,716
- l want to know if the worst is over
or if it's on its way.
- We've got General Kimsey on the line.

105
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,277
We've got hits from Finland to South
Carolina. We know they're not missiles.
Now what the hell is it?

106
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,636
lt's a meteor shower.
That's what took out the shuttle.

107
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,314
- He's waiting for you.
- What's the death toll?

108
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,795
l've got the President
on Air Force One demanding answers.

109
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,199
ls it over?

110
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,711
General, we've got 11,000 people at NASA
trying to figure that out right now.
When we know, you'll know.

111
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,554
Okay, Karl, listen.
l want you to take your time.
Yes, sir. You are definitely the first.

112
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,549
Okay, first coordinate.
One-two-three-nine. 1239, right?

113
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,597
- FBl locked his location.
- Saw an explosion in space.

114
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,194
- Okay.
- The last one--

115
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,154
- Now, listen, Karl, this is top secret.
- Sir, l'm retired Navy.
l know all about classified.

116
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,596
But one more thing. The person
that finds her gets to name her, right?

117
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,759
- Yes, that's right. That's right.
- l want to name her Dottie,
after my wife.

118
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,829
- She's a vicious, life-suckin' bitch
from which there's no escape.
- That's-- That's sweet, Karl.

119
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,077
S.D.l., this is Flight Director.
l want to get that Hubble movin',
and l want it now.

120
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,873
Roger that.
We're movin' the Hubble!

121
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,348
- lt's enormous.
- This is the anomaly at 1643.

122
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,673
Here is the anomaly at 1658.

123
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,116
And here is the anomaly at 1700.

124
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,595
Enough with this
''anomaly'' horseshit!

125
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,956
- What is this thing?
- lt's an asteroid, sir.

126
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,793
How big are we talking?

127
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,757
Sir, our best estimate
is 97.6 billion--

128
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,559
- lt's the size of Texas, Mr President.
- Y-Y-Yes, sir.

129
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,875
Dan, we didn't
see this thing coming?

130
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,195
Well, our object collision
budget's a million dollars.

131
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,356
That allows us to track
about three percent of the sky.

132
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,637
- And begging your pardon, sir,
but it's a big-ass sky.
- And the ones this morning?

133
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,115
Uh, those are nothing.
Uh, they're the size of basketballs...

134
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,031
and, uh, Volkswagens,
things like that.

135
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,720
ls this going to hit us?

136
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,475
- We're efforting that as we speak, sir.
- What kind of damage are we--

137
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,272
Damage?

138
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,356
Total, sir.

139
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,914
lt's what we call a global killer.

140
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,996
The end of mankind.

141
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,997
Doesn't matter where it hits.

142
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,315
Nothing would survive,
not even bacteria.

143
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,319
My God. What do we do?

144
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,832
We have 18 days
before it hits Earth.

145
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,713
- Have mercy.
- Rise and shine!

146
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,672
Stop the drilling!
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!

147
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,228
- Fore!
- Stop the drilling!

148
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,157
Stop the drilling!
Stop the drilling!

149
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,038
- Hey!
- Hey, that was close!

150
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,036
l gave you 50,000 a year in donations!
What do you think they're
so mad about, Chick?

151
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,913
Well, l think they feel that
drilling for oil is an evil thing.

152
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,793
Do you know how much diesel
that clunker boat pumps out in an hour?

153
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,155
You know, l just found out
something interesting.

154
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,273
- Number two chewed 180 feet last night.
- Who do we have to thank for this?

155
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,073
Well, l'll give you two guesses,
but you're only gonna need one.

156
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,236
Goddam it, A.J.!

157
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,271
A.J.!

158
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,592
A.J.!
A.J., you in here?

159
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,075
Oh, that's just perfect.
ln bed. Get up!

160
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,079
- Uh, hey, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah, l was lookin' for ya.

161
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,957
You're pissed.
Okay, l can see that.

162
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,591
No. You know what, A.J.?
l'm not pissed. You've seen me pissed.
This is way, way beyond pissed, though.

163
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,195
- You know l shut down number two
last night, right?
- Yeah, man, l had a hunch on that.

164
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,915
Dude, let me tell you somethin'.
Someday, many years from now,
when you're all growed up...

165
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,238
and you got your own
oil company and $8 million
of your own money on the contract...

166
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,796
you can do whatever comes
into that little A.J.-idiotin' mind
of yours you want...

167
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,316
but as long as it says
''Harry Stamper Oil'' on the rig
you will not disobey my rules.

168
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,356
- You got that?
- Yeah, l do got it.

169
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,597
- Right now, l need to hear
five words from you.
- Uh--

170
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,678
- l'll never do that again.
- Never do that again.

171
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,069
l'm a fool. That was idiotic.
l-l mean, that was stupid.

172
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,156
l'm an idiot. l know what name's
on the sign. l'm not-- l can't--

173
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,714
- What's going on here?
- What's going on? Well, l-l mean, l--

174
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,554
- l screwed up. l'm a little edgy.
- How long you worked for me?
- Five wonderful years.

175
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,552
ln five years, you have never
apologized to me this quickly.

176
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,030
- Something's going on here.
l'm gonna find out what it is.
- No, no, no. Well--

177
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,597
l-l'm turning over a new leaf.
l'm trying to learn from the man.
What would Harry do?

178
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,910
l'm at a loss for words.

179
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,599
- Okay, l can explain this.
- You can explain that?

180
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,514
- l can.
- l would really like an explanation.
You just stay right here.

181
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,349
- Grace?
- Hi, Harry.

182
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,074
l have asked you repeatedly
to call me Dad.

183
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,673
- Sorry, Harry.
- Get up and get your clothes on.

184
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,760
You just stay right there.
l'll be right back.

185
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,957
Here's what we're gonna do.
l want every strategy we've got
on near-Earth object collision, okay?

186
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,631
Any ideas, any programs,
anything you sketched
on a pizza box or a cocktail napkin.

187
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,799
For 30 years, they questioned
the need for NASA. Today
we're gonna give them the answer.

188
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,234
You know about this, Rockhound?
You knew.

189
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,271
No, l-l had no idea.

190
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,274
Where's Harry?

191
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,994
Harry! All right! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
l understand, okay?

192
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,509
You're mad.
Who-Who wouldn't be mad?

193
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,160
- But he's gonna shoot you.
- Nah. No, he's not. Oh, shit.

194
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,478
- Harry!
- What's wrong with you?

195
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,596
Make your peace with God, A.J.

196
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,434
- This guy's got a gun, man!
He's shooting at me!
- Harry, this is not funny!

197
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,672
- Harry, listen to me!
We can talk this over!
- So is this a, uh, serious thing?

198
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,995
- Yeah, pretty serious.
- Bear, man!
- What's up?

199
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,680
He's shooting at me. Uh, you see Harry
comin', crack him with that wrench!

200
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,832
You told A.J.'s dad just before he died
that you would take care of the boy.

201
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,916
Now, l'm not sure that shootin' him
is takin' care of him.

202
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,077
- Why don't you put the gun down, boss?
- You don't want none of this, Bear.
Get out of my way.

203
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,111
Just trying to give my man
a head start, that's all.

204
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,273
Not to mention the fact that l
don't think you wanna kill the best man
on your crew before we strike oil.

205
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,273
Ah, Chick, l ain't gonna kill him.
Just gonna take a foot off.
A man can work with one foot.

206
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,238
You remember old Frank Marx
who worked with one hand all them years?

207
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,194
- Yeah, but he wasn't very good.
- Harry, put the gun down!
You're acting insane!

208
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,595
Now honey, go get some clothes on
and get out of the way.

209
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,599
- You can't control my life.
- Fine. Clothes. Now!

210
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,917
All right, stop, all right? lt was funny
for a minute, it's not funny any more.

211
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,794
- Harry, this is illegal, man.
- l'm temporarily insane, Rock.
lt's all right.

212
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,278
- Do l look like l'm crazy to you?
- Well--

213
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,436
Harry, hey, just cool down.

214
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,478
- What are you-- Okay, stop.
- All right. All right, Harry.

215
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,716
All right. Now, listen, man to man.

216
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,519
l'm serious. l love her.

217
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,392
Way wrong answer.

218
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,799
- Whoa, whoa, Harry. lt's gettin' real.
- Harry! Come on, Harry!

219
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,514
- Stop him!
- You shot him!

220
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,272
Bullet never got close.
Just a ricochet.

221
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,755
You know, it's all funny
till somebody gets shot in the leg.

222
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,429
Hey, pucker up!
We got clients incoming!

223
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,832
Uh, b-back in, uh, 1974...

224
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,270
w-we first got the-the idea,
the possibility that a, that a meteor
or an asteroid--

225
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,029
l need somebody who's had a little less
caffeine this morning. Doc, translate.

226
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,709
Our first feasibility plan was to use
a spread-focus laser generator...

227
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,671
to heat the object
to the point of fracture.

228
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,950
That's like shooting a B.B. gun
at a freight train, Doc.

229
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,877
Uh, some of us have got this idea.

230
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,356
We want to land a craft,
deploy solar sails.

231
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,278
You'll have a great big canopy.
Solar winds will be caught...

232
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,597
by these mylar sails.

233
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,631
- Okay.
- Come on, guys.

234
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,309
We gotta come up with something
realistic here. We got 18 days.

235
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,915
That's 431 hours,
15 minutes and 18 seconds.

236
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,554
Time's a luxury we don't have.
What?

237
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,836
Listen, Harry. A.J. is my choice--
my choice and not yours.

238
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,635
He's the only one in your age bracket,
Grace. lt's not a choice,
it's a lack of options.

239
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,430
l don't know what in the world makes
you think that you have the right
to tell me what to do any more, Harry.

240
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,676
l suppose being your father
doesn't count, huh?

241
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,671
- Not really.
- Since when?

242
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,758
Since l reached the age of 10
and became older than you, Harry.

243
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,558
Since Mom split.
Why don't you take your pick?

244
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,232
Look, l understand that you are
handicapped by a natural immaturity
and l forgive you.

245
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,954
l may be an immature father, okay?
But l'm still your employer.

246
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,117
And as your boss l want you
on that crew boat tonight
and back in the office by Monday.

247
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,198
- You got that?
- Okay. l quit.

248
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,313
Grace, you can't quit now.
l need you to keep on workin'.

249
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,190
- Hi, Harry!
- What are you smilin' about?

250
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,149
l've been seein' A.J.
for more than five months, Harry.

251
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,554
You little hypocrite. l ever held you
back once from doin' anything?

252
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,393
What about having a life, Harry?
The first time l got my period...

253
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,636
Rockhound had to take me
into Taipei for Tampax...

254
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,830
and then he had to show me
how to use 'em, Harry.

255
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,910
l ju-- No, l-l told her how to use it.
l didn't show her, Harry.

256
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,670
l was playing
with titanium depth gauges when
l should've been playing with dolls.

257
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,759
l mean, l learned about the birds and
the bees from Freddie Noonan's tattoos.

258
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,553
Look, l was raised
on roughnecks by you...

259
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,114
and now you get all shocked and shaken
when l fall in love with one.

260
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,550
- So who is the hypocrite here,
Harry, huh? Who?
- Look at those nice pipes up there.

261
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,639
- Listen to me, Grace. l want you--
- No, you listen to me, Harry.
l grew up.

262
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,354
With the proximity of the asteroid...

263
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,034
and no prep time,
none of our primary plans can work.

264
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,272
Why don't we just send up 150 nuclear
warheads and blast that rock apart?

265
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,676
- Terrible idea.
- Was l talkin' to you?

266
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,669
This is Dr Ronald Quincy from research,
pretty much the smartest man on the
planet. You might want to listen to him.

267
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,390
General, if you consider your target--
her composition, her dimensions...

268
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,557
her sheer velocity, you could fire
every nuke you've got at her...

269
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,677
and she'll just smile at you
and keep on coming.

270
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,995
You should know that the president's
scientific advisors...

271
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,511
are suggesting that a nuclear blast
could change this asteroid's trajectory.

272
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,155
l know the president's chief scientific
advisor. We were at M.l.T. together.

273
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,192
And in a situation like this, you--
you really don't want...

274
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,398
to take the advice of a man
who got a C-minus in astrophysics.

275
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,355
The president's advisors are,
um, wrong. l'm right.

276
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,471
Hitting the rock from the outside
won't do the job.

277
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,876
lmagine a firecracker
in the palm of your hand.

278
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,635
You set it off.
What happens? Burn your hand, right?

279
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,230
You close your fist around
the same firecracker and set it off--

280
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,720
Your wife's gonna be opening your
ketchup bottles the rest of your life.

281
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,836
Are you suggesting
we blow this thing up from the inside?

282
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,639
- That's exactly what l'm saying.
- How?

283
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,389
We drill. We bring in the world's
best deep-core driller.

284
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,869
Harry, get up here!
We're takin' a hit!

285
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,911
- Get A.J. up here! Whoa!
- Come on!

286
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,030
Send another pipe on down!
Right now! Full pipe!

287
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,229
- lt's a gas pocket.
- l told you. Am l lucky
or am l just a genius?

288
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,238
l shut it down for a reason, you
jackass! The relief valve's fried open.

289
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,272
Shut off the number two valve!
Grace, get the clients outta here now!

290
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,868
Chick, get 'em outta here!
Get 'em off the rig now!

291
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,277
Get the hell down!
This thing is gonna blow!

292
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,478
Get out! Chick, get out now!

293
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,797
Get down!

294
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,838
Three dozen research calls and every
time the same man is recommended.

295
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,076
He's worked on every terrain
this planet can offer.

296
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,236
Whenever they said it couldn't be
drilled, this guy drilled it.

297
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,909
- Everybody all right?
- We struck oil, baby!

298
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,350
Somebody could've got killed out here
today. You want that on your conscience?

299
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,797
High thumb. You are man, Harry.

300
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,474
Thumbs high.

301
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,037
You're fired.

302
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,669
Who's Harry Stamper?

303
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,268
Yeah, l'm Harry Stamper.
What's all this about?

304
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,875
Mr Stamper, l'm General Montgomery,
commander of the Pacific air forces.

305
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,116
l've been sent here
by the secretary of defence...

306
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,471
on direct orders from the president
of the United States.

307
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,830
lt's a matter of urgent
national security.

308
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,316
l need you to get on that chopper
right now, no questions asked.

309
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,517
- Crazy Willie put you up to this?
- Afraid l don't know Crazy Willie.

310
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,592
Sir, l'm dead serious about this.

311
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,632
- Harry.
- What?

312
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,915
Man, l swear to God,
she never told me her age.

313
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,759
lt's all right.
Relax. lt's about me.

314
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,870
Oh. Forget it.

315
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,275
All right, General.
l'll go with ya.

316
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,472
On one condition--
we have to take my daughter along.

317
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,431
- What did l do?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you guys
takin' her? Wait a minute.

318
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,915
- Sir, stay right here.
- Well--

319
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,349
Chick! Get him paid,
get him off the rig!

320
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,318
- Mr Stamper?
- Yeah, l'm Harry Stamper.

321
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,115
How ya doin'? Miss Stamper.
l'm Dan Truman, executive director here.

322
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,674
- Now listen, on behalf of all of us,
l'd really like to apologize--
- Apologize.

323
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,950
l don't know if we can take
any more apologies, Mr Truman.

324
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,878
We've been apologized to
for the last 18 and a half hours.

325
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,195
So if you don't mind,
how 'bout if we just get on with it...

326
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,914
and you tell us why we're here
at the NASA space centre?

327
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,471
- We should probably talk alone.
- Mr Truman, l don't keep any secrets
from my daughter, Grace.

328
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,034
So whether you tell her now or
l tell her later she's gonna find out...

329
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,390
one way or the other,
so why don't we just get on with it?

330
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,638
So when the rogue comet hit the asteroid
belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.

331
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,280
For the next 15 days
the Earth's in a shooting gallery.

332
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,279
Even if the asteroid itself hits
the water, it's still hitting land.

333
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,916
lt'll flash-boil millions
of gallons of sea water and slam
into the ocean bedrock.

334
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,555
Now, if it's a Pacific Ocean impact--
which we think it will be--

335
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,912
it'll create a tidal wave three miles
high, travel at 1,000 miles an hour...

336
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,316
covering California
and washing up in Denver.

337
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,671
Japan's gone. Australia's wiped out.

338
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,598
Half the world's population'll be
incinerated by the heat blast...

339
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,513
and the rest'll freeze to death
from nuclear winter.

340
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,431
That's unbelievable.

341
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,360
Well, actually,
this is as real as it gets.

342
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,513
Well, it's coming, right now--

343
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,558
right for us--
at 22,000 miles an hour.

344
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,393
Not a soul on Earth can hide from it.

345
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,596
l take it you're not
alerting everyone like this.

346
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,678
Nobody knows.
That's the way it stays.

347
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,314
For the next ten days, there are
only nine telescopes in the world...

348
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,914
that can spot the asteroid,
and we control eight of 'em.

349
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,873
The president's classified
this information top secret.

350
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,639
lf news like this got out,
there'd be an overnight breakdown...

351
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,589
of basic social services worldwide--
rioting, mass religious hysteria.

352
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,240
Total chaos. You can imagine.

353
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,318
Basically the worst parts
of the Bible.

354
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,037
Six billion people on the planet--

355
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,116
why'd you guys call me?

356
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,471
- We need you to prep the team
we're sending up.
- Up?

357
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,956
We'll send 'em to the asteroid,
they'll land, they'll drill a hole,
they'll drop some nukes...

358
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,838
take off and detonate
if we can fix this equipment problem.

359
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,471
Now, the, uh, drilling unit's
a prototype we've been building
for the Mars project.

360
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,996
You, uh--
you might recognize the rig.

361
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,635
Yeah, well, l guess l should
recognize it. lt's my design.

362
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,510
What'd you do?
Steal a key to the patent office?

363
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,438
- Yeah, basically.
- Let me get this straight.

364
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,638
l got pulled off an oil rig,
flown halfway around the world
because you stole my drill design...

365
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,190
couldn't read the plans right
and did a piss-poor job
of putting it together, is that it?

366
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,039
- Well, technically,
patents don't apply to outer space.
- Just shut up, Quincy.

367
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,396
lt's not going to Mars any more.
lt's going to try to save this planet.

368
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,471
And we need to know
what's wrong with it pretty quick.

369
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,471
You said we did a bad job
of putting it together?

370
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,831
No, l said you did a piss-poor job
of putting it together.

371
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,996
First of all, you got
the flow system all reversed.

372
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,278
Let me guess: you've been tearin' up
rotors and you can't figure out why.

373
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,148
- Yeah, that's right, actually.
- Well, that's because your cams
are all wrong, Mr Wizard.

374
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,994
- Who's been operating this thing?
- Right there.

375
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,117
W-We've actually-- we've had them
training for eight months solid now.

376
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,913
- Eight whole months?
- Well, pretty much, yeah.

377
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,316
- Well, gee whiz.
- Well, this is the team
that has to do the job up there.

378
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,351
We need you to train 'em down here.

379
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,431
Well, Mr Stamper, what do you think?

380
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,154
You know, drilling's a science.
lt's an art.

381
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,390
l'm a third-generation driller,
doin' it all my life...

382
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,954
and l still haven't got it
all figured out.

383
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,356
l assume you sent for me because
somebody told you l was the best.

384
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,914
Well, l'm only the best
because l work with the best.

385
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,555
You don't trust the men you're
working with, you're as good as dead.

386
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,716
Now, you want to send
these boys into space, fine.

387
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,796
l'm sure they'll make
good astronauts.

388
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,388
But they don't know jack
about drillin'.

389
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,040
- What's your contingency plan?
- Contingency plan?

390
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,799
Your backup plan. You gotta have
some kind of backup plan, right?

391
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,798
- No, we don't have a backup plan.
This is it.
- And this is the best that you could--

392
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,390
that the-the government,
the U.S. government can come up with?

393
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,631
l mean, y-you're NASA, for cryin'
out loud. You put a man on the moon.

394
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,877
You're geniuses! Y-You're the guys
that think this shit up.

395
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,309
l'm sure you got a team of men
sittin' around somewhere right now...

396
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,670
just thinkin' shit up
and somebody backin' them up.

397
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,394
You tellin' me you don't have
a backup plan, that these
eight Boy Scouts right here...

398
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,273
that is the world's hope,
that's what you're tellin' me?

399
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,437
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jesus. Damn it.

400
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,910
We're a little short on time here.
Will you help us?

401
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,993
- All they gotta do is drill?
- That's it.

402
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,509
No spacewalkin',
no crazy astronaut stuff?

403
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,273
Just drill.

404
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,755
How many men were you plannin'
on takin' up there?

405
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,751
We're sendin' up
two shuttles, two teams.

406
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,996
lf l do this,
l'm gonna wanna take my own men.

407
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,111
You got it.

408
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,073
So you're saying you'll help us?

409
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,952
Yes, sir.

410
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,076
Thanks.

411
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,633
l just don't trust anybody else
to do it, that's all.

412
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,474
No, Mrs Curlene,
it's Harry Stamper.

413
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,189
lf you see Bear, you tell him
Harry's lookin' for him.

414
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,756
Those guys get off this rig,
they scatter. J. Otis Curlene Bear--

415
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,668
probably the only black man
on a big hog in Kadoka, South Dakota.

416
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,149
Come and get Papa Bear!

417
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,272
- Uh, Max.
- You got a weight limit on the shuttle?

418
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,350
- Max.
- Hey, Mama.

419
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,672
- Oh, that's so sweet, Maxie.
- Hey, did ya get me one of them
yellow jelly bear claws l like?

420
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,791
Maxie, are you in trouble
with the law again?

421
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,592
- No, Mama.
- Maxie.

422
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,517
l swear, Mama, l'm--

423
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,910
- You know l want Rockhound.
- We call him Hound because...

424
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,309
well, um, he's horny.

425
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,517
Well, you might want to start
with every bar in New Orleans.

426
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,438
That is a big, shiny mount,
isn't it?

427
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,715
- How long you been married?
- For two weeks.

428
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,030
- See this diamond?
- Yeah?

429
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,833
- lt's not a diamond.
Would you like another drink?
- Yeah.

430
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,434
- Sir, FBl.
- She's so cute.

431
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,596
- No, thanks.
- We have a national security matter.

432
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,557
- Good for you.
- Let's go.

433
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,791
- Now.
- How old are you?

434
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,151
Oscar Choice-- spacey
but absolutely brilliant geologist.

435
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,840
He owns a horse ranch
outside of El Paso.

436
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,151
What the--

437
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,120
Mr Chick Chapel, at the craps table,
Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas, Nevada.

438
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,913
Yes! About time.

439
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,309
Charles Chapel, game's over.

440
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,797
Who's gonna run the other rig?

441
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,876
How 'bout Benny? He's good.

442
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,798
The only one knows
how to run it as well as l do is A.J.

443
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,195
l thought you said
you couldn't trust him.

444
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,709
l thought you said l could.

445
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,394
Yep, you are on your way, A.J.

446
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,910
Well, you know, bein' in business
for yourself has its advantages--

447
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,998
make my own hours,
nobody shoots me in the leg.

448
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,558
You don't got
a gun on ya now, do ya? Oh, good.

449
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,071
'Cause l kinda wanted to get back
to this whole thing
about you askin' me for help.

450
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,990
Does that mean that there's actually
a job that Mr All-Go-No-Quit-Big-Nuts...

451
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,157
Harry Stamper can't handle by himself...

452
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,674
and needs my expert advice?

453
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,360
- Somethin' like that, yeah.
- Well, no, no, no.

454
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,914
l mean, is it-it something like that,
or is it that?

455
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,714
You know,
you and me got a real problem.

456
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,752
You know, Harry,
there are only, uh...

457
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,792
five words l wanna hear
from you right now.

458
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,112
And those words are: ''You know, A.J.,
l really look up to you.

459
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,674
''You've been a hero of mine
for a long time, and...

460
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,031
l'm very impressed with your work;
l'm emotionally closed off.''

461
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,111
That's like--
that's like 11 words or somethin'.

462
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,035
You know what? How about just,
''A.J., l'm sorry, and-- and l love ya.''

463
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,475
You know, A.J.,
there's not a job on the planet...

464
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,596
that l want you
to work with me on.

465
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,477
l mean that.

466
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,679
So what are you doin' here?
Harry, what's the job?

467
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,076
- Big Daddy!
- What's up, baby?

468
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,156
Yeah, big Bear.
What's up? What's up?

469
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,077
What's up, Harry?
Did NASA find oil on Uranus, man?

470
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,196
None of you have to go.
We can all just sit here on Earth...

471
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,910
wait for this big rock to crash into it,
kill everything and everybody we know.

472
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,639
The United States government
just asked us to save the world.

473
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,435
- Anybody wanna say no?
- Twenty years--

474
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,599
haven't turned ya down once,
not about to start now.

475
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,958
- l'm there.
- Guess l can't let you
go up there alone.

476
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,752
l'm with you.

477
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,553
l mean, this is--
this is historic.

478
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,757
Guys, this is
like deep blue hero stuff.

479
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,072
- Of course l'm in.
- While l don't share his enthusiasm...

480
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,153
you know me-- beam me up, Scotty.

481
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,953
- You all right, Max?
- l-l don't-- l-l don't--

482
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,630
Whatever you think.

483
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,116
- What about you?
- l'm in.

484
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,031
All right, then.

485
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,835
We go.

486
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,117
l don't mean to be the materialistic
weasel of this group, but...

487
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,356
you think we'll get
hazard pay out of this?

488
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,869
lf you're trying to make me feel better
about this scenario, give it up.

489
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,748
To tell you the truth, l'm kind of
encouraged. This guy Chick here was
an Air Force commando for six years.

490
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,270
We got robbery, assault,
arrest, resisting arrest.

491
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,551
We got a collection agent
for the mob. Two of these guys
have done serious time.

492
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,835
-Look, they're the best at what they do.
-So am l.

493
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,751
And l'm not
so optimistic.

494
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,798
We spend $250 billion
a year on defence.

495
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,354
And here we are. The fate
of the planet is in the hands...

496
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,954
of a bunch of retards l wouldn't
trust with a potato gun.

497
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,317
- So what's the verdict?
- They'll do it.

498
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,955
- They've made a few requests though.
- Such as?

499
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,471
Just a few things here, uh--

500
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,832
Nothing really big, just--
Well, as an example--

501
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,313
Uh, Oscar here's got some
outstanding parking tickets.
Wants 'em wiped off his record.

502
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,830
- Fifty-six tickets in seven states.
- l'll tell him, Oscar. l got it.

503
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,753
- Okay.
- Uh, Noonan's got two women friends...

504
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,838
that he'd like to see made
American citizens, no questions asked.

505
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,238
Max would like you to bring back
eight track tapes.

506
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,148
Not sure if that's gonna work,
but let's see what else.

507
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,149
Chick wants a full week's Emperor's
Package at Caesar's Palace, um--

508
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,873
Hey, you guys wouldn't
be able to tell us who
actually killed Kennedy, would ya?

509
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,071
Uh, Bear would like to stay
at the...

510
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,311
White Horse, the--

511
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,829
White House.
White House.

512
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,795
White House. Yeah, he'd like
to stay in the Lincoln Bedroom
of the White House for the summer.

513
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,156
- Stuff like that.
- Sure, l think we can, uh...

514
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,670
take care of some of that.

515
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,591
Harry!

516
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,077
Yeah, one more thing. Um--

517
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,317
None of them wanna
pay taxes again.

518
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,719
Ever.

519
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,599
Who's that for?
Mr Ed?

520
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,349
You stick that in me, l'm gonna
stab you in the heart with it.
You ever see Pulp Fiction?

521
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,076
Oh, say can you see

522
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,720
We're losin' him,
we're losin' him. Clear! Kaboom!

523
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,633
- Freddie, you all right?
- Does this look okay to you?

524
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,753
- Does this look okay?
- lt's not all bad. lt's kinda tingly.

525
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,189
Mr Chapel, you're next!

526
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,073
Oh, gee, lady,
l just came here to drill.

527
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,997
Oh, so did l.

528
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,231
Your triglycerides
are way high...

529
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,959
and your bad cholesterol
is shockingly bad.

530
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,072
- Tell ya to lay off
those pork rinds, Pooh Bear.
- Yeah, pork rind this.

531
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,431
Pork rinds this!
Yeah!

532
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,357
Take it off, baby!

533
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,274
Well, at least
they're in good spirits.

534
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,955
Piece of cake.
Look, you wanna compare brain pans?

535
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,713
l won the Westinghouse Prize
when l was 12. Big deal.

536
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,628
Published at 19. So what? l got
a double doctorate from M.l.T. at 22.

537
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,951
Chemistry and geology.
l taught at Princeton for 2 1/2 years.

538
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,119
You know, l think this might be
the most uncomfortable room
l've ever been in in my life.

539
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,118
Why do l do this? Because the money's
good, the scenery changes...

540
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,515
and they let me use
explosives, okay?

541
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,234
Okay, you wanna be
all psychological with me, that's fine.

542
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,396
l'll tell you one thing
that really drives me nuts...

543
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,234
is people who think that Jethro Tull
is just a person in the band.

544
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,151
Who is Jethro Tull?

545
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,313
My favourite dish is haggis--
heart, lungs, liver.

546
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,030
You shove that all in a sheep's stomach,
then you boil it.
That'll put some hair on your ass.

547
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,391
l am not crazy. l'm just
a little emotional right now, okay?

548
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,080
You all throwin' all this stuff
at me, man. Look-- get-- l mean--

549
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,555
After this is over, could l, like,
get a hug from you or somethin'?

550
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,791
Okay, Cyclops lady's
startin' to bug me.

551
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,713
- Can you handle it?
- l mean, l can handle what l'm,
you know, l'm gonna do.

552
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,637
l can handle that, but l don't know
if l can handle this room.

553
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,557
Woman with large breasts.

554
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,038
- Woman with medium breasts.
- Here's Harry givin' me a hard time.

555
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,469
And, uh, this is Harry tellin' me
it's not good enough.

556
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,950
And, uh, this is Harry tellin' me
l can't marry his daughter.
Thanks a lot. l appreciate it.

557
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,753
Just let it out.

558
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,230
l suffered a major head injury
when l was in high school.

559
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,515
This one looks like you...
with breasts.

560
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,636
Yeah, l can handle it.
Yeah, l can handle it.

561
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,999
A home run! The Cubs win
the World Series!

562
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,831
Fail. Fail.
Depressively fail.

563
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,872
One toxicology analysis
revealed ketamine.

564
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,709
- That is a very powerful sedative.
- Sedatives are used
all the time, Doctor.

565
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,717
Well, this one's used on horses.

566
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,157
Some of these guys
are pretty big.

567
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,549
lt would normally take 18 months
to psychologically prepare...

568
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,029
prescreen viable subjects
for space travel.

569
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,188
- We have seen evidence of a wide
variety of territorial aggression.
- Can they physically survive the trip?

570
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,115
- That's all l need to know here, okay?
- Personally, l don't know how
they survived the tests.

571
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,837
Talk about the wrong stuff.

572
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,910
Good morning.
l'm Colonel Willie Sharp.

573
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,634
ln addition to flying one of
the X-71 teams to that rock...

574
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,719
my job is to train you how to deal
with the mental and physical
rigors of working in space...

575
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,236
so you don't freak out
on the asteroid.

576
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,636
United States astronauts
train for years.

577
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,557
You have 12 days.

578
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,910
Do we have any intelligent questions
before we get started?

579
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,673
- What's an X-71?
- You're the first civilians
to ever see her.

580
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,031
We call 'em the X-71s.

581
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,594
lt's a top secret joint venture
with the Air Force.

582
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,558
She and her sister ship at Vandenberg
are leaving tomorrow
for launch prep in Florida...

583
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,193
but l thought
you oughta take a look.

584
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,232
The two shuttles going up are
the Freedom and the lndependence.

585
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,551
Her titanium alloy impenetrable skin
covers the toughest, meanest...

586
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,558
most sophisticated space vehicle
man has ever made.

587
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,989
Okay, Air Force Colonel Davis,
NASA pilot Tucker...

588
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,917
will command the shuttle
lndependence.

589
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,510
Air Force Colonel Sharp,
NASA pilot Watts, shuttle Freedom.

590
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,718
Munitions specialist Gruber and Halsey
will supervise the nuclear ordnance.

591
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,957
Anyway, uh, l just thought, uh--

592
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,116
thought you guys should meet.

593
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,389
Gentlemen, welcome to our weightless
environmental training facility.

594
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,313
So we're going swimming on this
asteroid? ls that what this is for?

595
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,194
Here at downtown NASA,
we call this the ''Monster Armadillo.''

596
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,518
Gonna be retrofitted
with your drilling arm. She'll turn
800 turbo horses in near zero gravity.

597
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,428
Mind if we take a look at her now?
All these rubber hoses gotta go, Max.
Count 'em up.

598
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,472
Make sure it's
short-throw shiftin'.

599
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,996
Quincy!
Somebody tell me what this is.

600
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,999
Plastic ice cream scoop?
What'd that cost? About $400?

601
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,790
This is about the sorriest group
of people l've seen in all
my entire military career.

602
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,758
Your space flight's gonna be
a brutal assault on your senses.

603
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,998
l'm here to give you a taste
of that. NASA's got some of
the finest pilots in the world.

604
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,038
They're gonna be suckin' your eyes
into the back of your heads.

605
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,874
Go easy on me, okay?
lt's my first time.

606
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,758
l just wanna seriously say
l have a small fear of flying.

607
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,677
l'm gonna twist ya.

608
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,195
- And l'm gonna flip ya.
- What's the matter with you?

609
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,875
Frap your body
till your bones hurt.

610
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,838
When you squeal, l'm just
gonna go faster and harder.

611
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,430
No, take me down!

612
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,120
- How's the rest of the crew?
- Well, uh--

613
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,668
Sorry about the rib chunks
all over your dashboard.

614
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,189
Don't forget:
We gotta X-ray all these--

615
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,471
- lf you had to say, who would you say?
- l don't know, Oscar.
Who do you think you are?

616
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,870
- Han Solo.
- No. lf anybody's anybody, l'm Han.

617
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,797
And you're--
you're Chewbacca.

618
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,593
Chewie? Have you even
seen Star Wars?

619
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,075
All right, men, let's go.
Step it up.

620
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,679
Neil Armstrong, 1969,
bouncing on the moon.

621
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,797
He's bouncing because there's
less gravity up there than on Earth.

622
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,390
This will be similar
to the asteroid, so watch it.

623
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,914
Something gets launched off
that asteroid with enough force...

624
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,270
it's gonna keep on going
right into outer space.

625
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,915
What is the deal?
ls it just me, or is Watts really hot?

626
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,831
Yeah.

627
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,595
So we have these new generation suits
with directional accelerant thrusters.

628
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,517
- You won't bounce like Neil Armstrong.
- Yeah, think so?

629
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,198
- Bear!
- Yes?

630
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,232
- Do we have a problem?
- No.

631
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,154
'Cause l'm trying to describe
to you how these D.A.T.s
keep your ass on the ground...

632
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,396
so that if l were to kick you
in the balls...

633
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,114
and you don't know how to work them,
what happens to you?

634
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,629
- l float away.
- Yeah.

635
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,479
And, uh, when do we
start training for that?

636
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,875
Gentlemen, l'll give you 30 seconds
to put your helmets on...

637
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,155
then the oxygen will be sucked
out of this vacuum...

638
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,510
and you will know what it's like
to be in space.

639
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,158
Go!

640
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,477
Depressed in 30 seconds.

641
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,556
Main valves have been activated.

642
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,837
Vacuum P.S.l.s are open.

643
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,277
Okay, gentlemen,
so here's the flight plan.

644
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,994
Now, let's keep the laughter to
a minimum. l know this is not to scale.

645
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,989
Both shuttles will take off
Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.

646
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,917
Now, 67 minutes later...

647
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,192
you're gonna dock with the Russian space
station to meet cosmonaut Andropov...

648
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,198
who will refuel the shuttles
with liquid O2.

649
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,748
That's your fuel.
Then you'll release...

650
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,519
and take a 60-hour trip
toward the moon.

651
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,269
Now, we only have one shot
of landing on this rock...

652
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,989
and that's precisely when
the asteroid passes by the moon.

653
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,873
You'll then use lunar gravity
and burn your thrusters...

654
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,231
slingshotting you
around the moon...

655
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,635
coming up behind the asteroid.

656
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,837
- You'll be upward of 11 Gs.
- Yeah, l remember this one.

657
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,191
lt's where the, uh, the coyote
sat his ass down in a slingshot...

658
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,111
then he strapped himself
to an Acme rocket.

659
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,998
- ls-ls that what we're doin' here?
- Rockhound.

660
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,873
- No, no, really, because it didn't
work out too well for the coyote, Harry.
- Hey, Rock.

661
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,192
- Remember that one?
- Well, actually, we have a lot better
rockets than the coyote.

662
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,959
Now, when you've finished
your Road Runner thrust move...

663
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,709
you'll be moving
at 22,500 miles per hour.

664
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,434
Coming around behind the asteroid,
where we're hoping...

665
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,790
that the tail debris'll be
cleared by the moon's gravity.

666
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,990
And you'll land right here.
That's it.

667
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,238
We got separate landing sites
for each team. Softest parts
of the rock as we can figure.

668
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,955
At NASA, we don't take chances.
We double up on everything.

669
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,600
First team
that hits 800 feet wins.

670
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,554
Now this rock is big, it's dense, it's
got some gravity. You can walk around.

671
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,029
But use your thrusters
so you can work easier.

672
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,119
Okay, Mr Truman, let's say that
we actually do land on this.

673
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,191
What's it gonna be like
up there?

674
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,392
Two hundred degrees in the sunlight.
Minus 200 in the shade.

675
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,110
Canyons of razor-sharp rock.
Unpredictable gravitational conditions.

676
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,277
Unexpected eruptions.
Things like that.

677
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,517
Okay, so the scariest
environment imaginable. Thanks.

678
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,517
That's all you gotta say:
scariest environment imaginable.

679
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,036
Okay, so you drill,
you drop the nuke, and you leave.

680
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,716
Now, here's the key:
You're gonna remote detonate the bomb...

681
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,992
before the asteroid
passes this plane-- Zero Barrier.

682
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,715
You do that, and the remaining
pieces of rock...

683
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,912
should be deflected enough
to pass right by us.

684
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,429
Now, if the bomb explodes
after Zero Barrier--

685
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,195
game's over.

686
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,589
Paul, this is Houston.
Fire your rockets.

687
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,116
- Okay, your rockets are maximum.
Beautiful boost.
- Oscar!

688
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,395
Hey, Harry. Hey, how's it goin'?

689
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,159
- Have you seen Grace?
-Yeah, she's over in the hangar
with A.J.

690
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,272
Harry, wait a second. Did you say Grace?
Okay, l thought you said Bear.

691
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,277
Will you marry me?

692
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,477
Grace is old enough
to vote, Harry.

693
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,433
She's old enough to have a drink or
get married if she wants, get a divorce.

694
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,512
Let me tell you something, fellas. When
l get back, when we get this job done...

695
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,437
l will deal with this
in my own way.

696
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,596
Come on, Harry. lt's not like
l'm rootin' for A.J. here.

697
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,875
- l'm just sayin',
Grace is not a little girl any more.
- Hey, Rock, you know, wait a minute.

698
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,356
Let me get a pencil and
a piece of paper. l wanna jot down
all your pearls of wisdom here.

699
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,750
Get serious, Harry. Come on. While we're
off trottin' the globe, hunting mud...

700
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,474
Gracie grew up to become
a full-blown hottie, you know?

701
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,949
- Harry, she is fully hot. She is--
- She's a babe.

702
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,516
Max, Max, okay. You're talkin'
about my little girl, all right?

703
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,795
l think l know
who and what she is, okay?

704
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,589
Okay, but Harry, all we're sayin' is,
we're talkin' about a kid who's
comin' into her own right now.

705
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,151
And she's gettin' curious about her body
and she's exploring her sexuality.
And you know what?

706
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,350
- Oscar.
- That's a natural thing.

707
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,870
You are about five minutes older than
Grace is. Why should l listen to you?

708
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,879
And l know what it feels like to have
your hormones pullin' you in just, you
know, a thousand different directions.

709
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,430
- You don't know which end is up.
- Yo, Harry, no disrespect, man,
but we all helped to raise her.

710
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,712
- So, in part, we all feel
like a bunch of daddies here.
- That's true.

711
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,510
l'll be damned if l worked all
these years so my little girl
can marry a roughneck.

712
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,989
She's better than that.

713
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,315
Better than all of us.

714
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,269
Harry, just sit back, relax.
l'm gonna put on a little
free Armadillo driving clinic for ya.

715
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

716
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,158
Two shuttle teams. A.J.'ll be
running the drill team with Oscar,
Bear and Noonan on the lndependence.

717
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,391
l'll run the drill team on Freedom
with Chick, Rockhound and Max.

718
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,040
Once we land, we'll have
eight hours to get the job done.

719
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,039
ln order to split this rock
on the fault line,
we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.

720
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,312
Let's get our game faces on.
Now it's time for underwater simulation.

721
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,471
Come on, lndependence. Keep it up.
Let's go. We're the younger team here.

722
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,637
We're the varsity team.
Take it to 11,000.

723
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,513
Okay, gentlemen, we're gonna
trick 'em up. My computer
will simulate a gas pocket...

724
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,838
at 625 feet and then
hard iron ferrite at 635.

725
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,555
l'm gonna draw up some more O2 in.
We're takin' her up.

726
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,240
- l'm givin' it more torque right now.
- All right, lookin' good, Bear.

727
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,788
Clamp it down. Watch your time,
lndependence team.

728
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,876
Thanks, Harry. Would you mind
lettin' me run my own team?

729
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,996
You're gonna blow the tranny, A.J.
Slow it down, baby.

730
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,429
Take it easy, Bear.
Just relax. She can handle it.

731
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,509
A.J., you're at 600 feet.
Your pipe is long.
Let's back the R.P.M.s down to 8,000.

732
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,359
- We don't have time for 8,000!
- A.J., take it back down.

733
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,630
You're gonna snap the pipe.
l don't wanna blow this transmission.

734
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,751
- Damn it, 11,000.
- Slow it down, A.J.

735
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,872
Bear, come on.
Get on our team for a little bit.

736
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,390
- Whoa, space cowboy.
- Harry, are you listenin' to this?
- Yeah, l'm listenin', Bear.

737
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,556
Harry? You don't work for Harry
any more, okay?

738
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,353
Out there you gotta listen to me.
When we're on that rock,
you gotta do what l say.

739
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,392
Now send more to the turbine.
l'm throttling up to 11,000.

740
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,954
A.J., back it off.
You're gonna blow the transmission.

741
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,833
Hey, Harry, would you let me
run my team, please?

742
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,309
-R.P.M.s are at red line.
-Bear, goddam it, l know what l'm doing.

743
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,908
Come on. She can handle this.
She'll be fine. Trust me.

744
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,037
- A.J., back the R--
- Transmission overload.
- Number one transmission is down.

745
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,914
Oh, son of a--
The computer's wrong, and you know that.

746
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,191
- We did the right thing.
- We're gonna restart the simulation.

747
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,158
lf you wanna replace a member
of the crew, now is the time.

748
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,272
l'll take care of this.
Get him out of the tank, Chick.

749
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,713
- You wanna go home?
ls that it? You wanna be fired?
- No, l don't.

750
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,910
- My crew was doing the right thing.
- Your crew?

751
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,639
- Yeah.
- Your crew just blew
the transmission, A.J.!

752
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,713
Listen, that NASA computer is just
playin' it safe. The machine you built,
the rig, could do it.

753
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,876
Shut up. Just shut up!
Shut your mouth!

754
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,794
Those men in that room
have zero tolerance
for showin' off, hot doggin'...

755
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,708
goin' by your gut instinct or
you tryin' to be a hero, you got that?

756
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,035
- Say the words, A.J.!
- l got it!

757
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,993
- l want my men to have
tomorrow night off.
- What do you mean ''off''?

758
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,755
l mean, off. Out of here. For at least
ten hours. Then we'll go to Kennedy.

759
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,078
Well, there's no possible way we can
do that, Harry. There's a potentially
huge security risk. What if they talk?

760
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,112
- What if they get hurt?
- What if they're too burned out
to do the right thing?

761
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,595
What if they get up there,
and they forget what
they're fighting for?

762
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,148
You see what's goin' on up there.
These boys are ready to snap.

763
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,356
They didn't ask to be here.
They got pulled off the street.

764
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,908
For all we know, tomorrow night could be
the last night they ever see Earth.

765
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,116
l don't think it's too much to ask to
let 'em spend it with their families.

766
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,595
- Well, listen, there's
no possible way we can do that.
- You got family, Colonel?

767
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,350
- Two girls.
- Wouldn't you like to spend tomorrow
night with your little girls?

768
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,954
l'm not askin' ya.
l'm tellin' ya.

769
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,355
Make this happen.

770
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,710
This is a pretty big loan.
Why don't you count the cash?

771
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,631
Nah, this looks like
100 grand to me.

772
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,156
l'm givin' you this at 60 percent.
l hope you know what you're doin'...

773
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,396
because l'll bust your head
with a sledgehammer.

774
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,994
- You'll get your money back.
- You don't look too healthy.

775
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,475
You're not gonna die on me,
are ya?

776
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,519
Let's just say,
no more than you are. Thanks, Vic.

777
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,635
Don't wanna close my eyes

778
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,274
l don't wanna fall asleep

779
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,316
'Cause l'd miss you, baby

780
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,228
- And l don't wanna miss a thing
- You know what l was thinkin'?
- What?

781
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,715
l-l really don't think that the
animal cracker qualifies as a cracker.

782
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,434
- Why?
- Well, 'cause it's sweet,
which to me suggests cookie.

783
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,553
And, you know, putting cheese
on something is sort of
the defining characteristic...

784
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,870
of what makes a cracker
a cracker.

785
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,797
l don't know why
l thought of that. l just--

786
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,354
Baby, you have
such sweet pillow talk.

787
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,632
l got a little animal cracker, Discovery
Channel thing happenin' right here.

788
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,435
Watch the gazelle
as he grazes through the open plains.

789
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,949
Now look
as the cheetah approaches.

790
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,674
Watch
as he stalks his prey.

791
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,439
Now, the gazelle's
a little spooked...

792
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,036
and he could head north
to the ample sustenance...

793
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,833
provided by
the mountainous peaks above.

794
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,471
He could go south.

795
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,748
The gazelle now faces man's
most perilous question:

796
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,957
north, or...

797
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,150
south?

798
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,313
Way down under.

799
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,717
Tune in next week.

800
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,079
Baby...

801
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,355
do you think it's possible
that anyone else in the world...

802
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,150
is doing this very same thing
at this very same moment?

803
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,390
l hope so.

804
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,114
Otherwise, what the hell
are we tryin' to save?

805
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,911
Don't wanna close my eyes

806
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,397
l don't wanna fall asleep
'cause l'd miss you, baby

807
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,990
And l don't wanna miss a thing

808
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,550
Hey.

809
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,751
- What are you doing here?
- l was just passin' by on the, uh--

810
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,836
l came--

811
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,879
- Who's he?
- That man's a salesman.

812
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,036
Would you go inside?

813
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,949
Thank you.

814
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,635
He got big.

815
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,758
You can't come around like this.

816
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,270
The court says you can't.
lt confuses him.

817
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,033
No, l know. l just--

818
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,312
l wanted to say
that l'm sorry...

819
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,149
about everything, and...

820
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,430
l got somethin' comin' up.

821
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,872
lt's something kinda big.
You just might be proud of me.

822
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,958
Would you do somethin' for me?
Would you just give him this?

823
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,914
You don't have to-- You don't have to
tell him who it's from. Just--

824
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,995
Everybody talkin' about
what it is, what it ain't

825
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,071
Kiss on the devil
and you piss off a saint

826
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,760
But it can't be love
if you don't have to crawl

827
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,832
You say you don't need nothin'
but you got to have it all

828
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,350
- Come back here!
- Hey, Noonan, you need ten grand?

829
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,635
- Yeah.
- We gotta put
these girls through college.

830
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,514
- l love this astronaut stuff.
- All right!
- Good work if you can get it.

831
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,074
Yeah, l'm just in town doin'
a little astronaut training.

832
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,714
Ooh! Astronauta.

833
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,115
Ah, si.
l'm a mission specialist.

834
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,516
- Yes, and what's that mean?
- l don't know.

835
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,316
Hey! Who the hell
do you think you guys are?

836
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,752
- You're hoggin' all the action.
- Hey, pinhead. Why don't you
go find your own party?

837
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,111
- Why don't you spread the wealth, pal?
- Here. Why don't you go
buy yourself a neck?

838
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,800
Hey, Mr Clean!

839
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,470
- Man! Call NASA!
- Get over there.

840
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,312
- They'll confirm it! We're astronauts!
- Yeah, yeah.

841
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,630
- Yeah, we're astronauts.
- Yeah, we're all astronauts.

842
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,149
You are so messing with national
security right now, man.

843
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,912
- Turn around.
- You are fired tomorrow morning.

844
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,679
l'm telling ya.
l'll get the ClA and the FBl.

845
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,639
- You'll be working security at Toys
'R' Us. Oh, oh, baby. No, no. No, no!
- Bye-bye, little astronaut.

846
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,199
- Oh, it's time to go now.
- Oh, don't leave, baby. No, no.

847
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,470
- You see, l'm goin' into space,
and l'm not comin' back.
- No, no, no.

848
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,514
-lt's coming in at 30,000 miles an hour!
-Give me a projected impact.

849
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,591
- East Asia, 11 minutes.
- We're gonna have to warn--

850
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,148
Warn who?
The entire South Pacific?

851
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,949
So the whole world knows.

852
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,711
Tell me you've never let
anybody down before.

853
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,837
l never quit yet.
How's that?

854
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,872
l guess that'll have to do.

855
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,275
You know somethin'?

856
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,709
l still remember the first,
middle and last name...

857
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,270
of every guy that qualified
for the astronaut programme
the first year l was here.

858
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:37,273
Thanks. l went
into the engineering programme.

859
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,035
Kinda had to.
But, boy, l wanted to go up there.

860
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,436
l wanted to be one of those guys
with a mission patch on my arm.

861
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,436
l tell you, l'd be on that shuttle
with you, Harry, if l could.

862
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,314
You don't want to be up in that shuttle
any more than l do.

863
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,598
Well, good luck in Florida tomorrow.

864
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,599
The death of 50,000 people in Shanghai
yesterday has rattled the na--

865
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,717
A French satellite has tracked
an object in space--

866
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,314
Sources are estimating
that the tidal wave was five--

867
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,237
This is CNN, live in Florida.

868
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,557
We have just learned that NASA
is on a full-scale military alert.

869
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,114
They're calling this
a global killer.

870
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,350
The government has been
very tight-lipped throughout this--

871
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,391
The Pentagon is getting involved
at this point with some kind...

872
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,790
of a project involving NASA
and perhaps a shuttle mission--

873
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,189
Senior Pentagon officials
refused comment...

874
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,518
adding fuel to the speculation that
there could be a very serious problem.

875
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,315
We have a special team of astronauts
that arrived in Florida this evening.

876
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,277
NASA's in emergency launch
preparation...

877
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,597
in cooperation with Russian, Japanese
and French space agencies...

878
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,478
on the most massive
joint space venture in history.

879
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,394
Gracie?

880
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,111
Got your note.

881
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,117
- What are you doing out here, honey?
- Um, just thinkin'.

882
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,118
- Yeah.
- l, um, want to apologize to you for--

883
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,237
Oh, no, Grace. Stop.
You don't have to apologize at all. l--

884
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,588
l sh--

885
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,275
l shouldn't have dragged you around
on all those oil rigs. l just--

886
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,915
l don't think that l did
the right thing with you.

887
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,194
- You're wrong.
- You see--

888
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,350
l love my life.

889
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,550
l love everything
about my life...

890
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,433
and l don't blame you
for my mother leaving.

891
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,272
She left us both.

892
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,955
And-And l love you.

893
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,277
And don't talk
like you're not comin' back.

894
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,116
Promise me that you'll come back.

895
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,319
- Okay.
- Say, ''l promise.''

896
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,512
l promise, Grace.

897
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,954
lt's gonna be all right, Grace.

898
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,755
lf it's not too much trouble, can you
please bring my fiance home with you?

899
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,518
Oh, Jesus.

900
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,873
The president will be
addressing the nation...

901
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,911
and all of you personally
within the hour.

902
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,155
Astronauts.

903
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,191
l'll see you
in a couple days, honey.

904
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,475
All my bags are packed

905
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,358
l'm ready to go

906
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,672
l'm standing here
outside your door

907
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,558
l hate to wake you up

908
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,995
To say goodbye

909
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:29,272
So kiss me and smile for me

910
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,193
Let me know you'll wait for me

911
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,871
Hold me like
you'll never let me go

912
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,037
'Cause l'm leavin'

913
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,469
On a jet plane

914
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,750
Don't know
when l'll be back again

915
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,197
Leavin' on a jet plane

916
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,551
l don't know
when l'll be back again

917
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,070
- Leavin' on a jet plane
- Leavin' on a jet plane

918
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,431
l don't know
when l'll be back again

919
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:04,475
- Leavin' on a jet plane
- So, Truman, this is who you found
to save the planet.

920
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,755
- Don't know when l'll be back again
- Frost, you good to go?

921
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,758
-Mm-hmm. One-One sec.
-Leavin' on a jet plane
-That boy don't take anything seriously.

922
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,355
- Yeah. Reminds me of
a guy l used to know.
- Don't know when l'll be back again

923
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,916
Leavin' on a jet plane

924
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,639
- l don't know when l'll be back again
- l'm marrying you.

925
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:23,759
- Bet your ass you are.
- Leavin' on a jet plane

926
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,440
l don't know
when l'll be back again

927
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,835
l address you tonight...

928
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,872
not as the president
of the United States...

929
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,868
not as the leader of a country...

930
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,396
but as a citizen of humanity.

931
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,675
We are faced with the very gravest
of challenges.

932
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:05,516
The Bible calls this day Armageddon,
the end of all things.

933
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,918
And yet,
for the first time...

934
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,511
in the history of the planet,
a species has the technology...

935
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,950
to prevent its own extinction.

936
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,868
All of you praying with us
need to know...

937
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,039
that everything that can be done
to prevent this disaster...

938
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,554
is being called into service.

939
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,350
The human thirst for excellence...

940
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,788
and knowledge...

941
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,993
every step
up the ladder of science...

942
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,993
every adventurous
reach into space...

943
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:50,993
all of our combined
modern technologies and imaginations...

944
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,834
even the wars that we've fought,
have provided us the tools...

945
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,229
to wage this terrible battle.

946
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,915
Through all the chaos
that is our history...

947
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,878
through all of the wrongs
and the discord...

948
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,752
through all of the pain
and suffering...

949
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,396
through all of our times
there is one thing...

950
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,074
- that has nourished our souls...
- Mom, that salesman's on TV.

951
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,754
and elevated our species
above its origins...

952
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,030
and that is our courage.

953
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:21,237
The dreams of an entire planet
are focused tonight...

954
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,710
on those 14 brave souls...

955
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,910
travelling into the heavens.

956
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,271
That man's not a salesman.
That's your daddy.

957
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,712
And may we all, citizens the world over,
see these events through.

958
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,310
Godspeed and good luck to you.

959
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,999
Freedom crew.
lndependence crew.

960
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,831
- How you feelin'?
- Uh, good, you know.

961
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,953
l mean, considering l've never been this
scared in my entire life. l-- You know--

962
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,669
Listen, once you get up there,
you're gonna be on your own.

963
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,631
lf anything should happen,
l just wanted--

964
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,116
l know, Harry. l'll, uh,
try not to disappoint you.

965
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,428
Take care of yourself, kid.

966
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,029
Freedom's on the bridge.

967
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:27,716
Attention in the firing room.
The oxidizer loading is complete.

968
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:31,071
- lndependence on the bridge.
- Attention all personnel.

969
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,998
We are T minus two hours
to the programme goal.

970
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,511
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah, Rock?

971
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,757
You know, we're sittin' on four million
pounds of fuel, one nuclear weapon...

972
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,713
and a thing that has
270,000 moving parts...

973
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,956
built by the lowest bidder.

974
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,198
- Makes you feel good, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

975
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,628
- How ya doin', Oscar?
- Great.

976
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,955
- Yeah?
- l got that excited, scared feelin'--

977
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,032
like 98% excited, 2% scared.

978
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,954
Maybe it's more. lt could be 2-- lt
could be 98% percent scared, 2% excited.

979
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:16,552
But that's what makes it
so intense, is it's so confused.
l can't really figure it out.

980
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,955
Will you make mine really tight,
'cause l don't want to fall out.

981
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,277
- Yes, sir.
- l mean, almost to the point
of cutting off circulation.

982
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,756
- Ow.
- lt must be a comfort to know...

983
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:29,316
that if the space programme
goes under you can always get a job
at Helga's House of Pain, huh?

984
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,637
- All right. Flight directors on
with the go/no-go for launch.
- Retro.

990
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,399
lndependence and Freedom,
this is Kennedy firing room.
We're T minus one minute.

991
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,155
All crew members,
close and lock your visors.

992
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,716
lndependence, this is launch control.
Be advised, we're in a smooth count.

993
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,712
T minus 31. You're go
for auto-sequence start.

994
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,673
B.L.T.s, perform
your A.D.U. pre-start.

995
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:08,476
Okay, gentlemen, you're our warriors
up there. God be with you.

996
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,991
- You're already heroes.
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
- F.T.D., we're clear to launch.

997
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,395
We're T minus 20 seconds.

998
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,633

01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,593
four, three, two, one.

1000
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,910
We have main engine start.

1001
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,589
- We have booster ignition.
- We're going.

1002
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,870
And liftoff.

1003
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,157
Freedom, this is flight deck.

1004
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,037
Roger, Freedom.
You're looking good.

1005
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:06,196
- We have go for lndependence.
- Three, two, one.

1006
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:10,398
-lndependence, we have booster ignition.
-We have liftoff.

1007
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,829
We are cooking, Houston.

1008
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,829
Houston, the tower is clear.
They're all yours.

1009
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,238
- Heads up, everybody. They're ours now.
- All engines are go.

1010
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,432
Keep a sharp eye out on both of 'em.

1011
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,435
Start roll manoeuvre.

1012
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:06,231
- Two good roll programs.
- One down.
- lndependence, we have a max cue.

Roger, Control.
We are a max cue.

1014
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,475
S.R.B. sep--

1015
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,671
- We are single-engine, press, demi-go.
- Copy, press, demi-go.

1016
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,830
Houston, this is a kick-ass ride!

1017
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,350
Freedom, this is Houston.
Main engine cut out on schedule. Out.

1018
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,316
Freedom, stats are good.

1019
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,592
- lndependence,
telemetry is up and running--
- Oh, my God!

1020
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,195
This is space! 'Course, we're just
in the beginning part of space.

1021
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,675
We-We haven't even gotten
to outer space yet.

1022
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,957
Roger, Houston.
We have a visual on the Russian
space station. lnitiating retro burn.

1023
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,950
Gentlemen, remember the Russian space
station has been up there for 11 years.

1024
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,036
Most of us
don't have cars that old.

1025
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:11,113
Now, the cosmonaut on board has been
on that tin can for 18 months, alone.

1026
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,269
So don't be surprised
if he's a little off.

1027
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:20,751
- lndependence, we're gonna put you--
- All right, crew.
Let's exit these flight suits.

1028
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:26,637
Hello. This is Russian
space station. Can you hear me?

1029
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,917
We copy, Russian space station.
This is Houston.

1030
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,350
l'm ready to fire
my thrusters any time.

1031
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,756
- Stand by.
- Okay. l'm not going anywhere.

1032
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,877
We have a go.
lnitiate gravitational spin.

1033
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,352
You are maxed at 40% spin.

1034
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,433
Okay, Houston.

1035
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,758
l can feel l'm having gravity.

1036
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,633
All right, gentlemen.
We're gonna dock in a minute.

1037
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,838
Now, the Russian space station has
fired her rockets to simulate gravity
and let us work faster.

1038
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,030
But it's gonna make you queasy,
so prepare yourself.

1039
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:11,352
Well, it's about time.
l haven't thrown up in about an hour.

1040
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,478
lnitiating first phase
of docking procedure.

1041
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,512
- Switching to manual.
- Manual override.

1042
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,351
One foot per second.
Let's take this slow and
do it right, folks. Twenty feet.

1043
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,394
Ten feet. Looking good on radar.

1044
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,789
Five feet.

1045
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,230
Locks are engaged.
Fuel teams, let's go.

1046
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,551
Freedom, telemetry is looking good.

1047
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,872
- We have soft dock.
- Fuel teams, prepare to unload.

1048
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,157
All right, gentlemen, watch your heads.
Let's go, lndependence.

1049
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,358
Colonel.

1050
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,150
Where is he? Anybody home?

1051
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,834
Welcome, everybody!

1052
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,479
l am not gas station.
This is sophisticated laboratory.

1053
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,309
l'm in charge.
So do not be touching anything.

1054
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,715
l need one-- l need you.

1055
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,633
- Go with him.
- l need you. Hurry up.
Hurry up. Come on. Come on.

1056
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:42,197
lt's very important you watch the
fuel gauge, okay? Put on cold suit.

1057
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,272
- Countdown clock will hold at--
- Copy that, Houston.
Prepping for fuel transfer.

1058
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,999
Countdown clock will hold
at T minus 20 minutes and--

1059
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,789
- Fuel pod is down there.
- lt's down here, huh? Great.

1060
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,758
Let's go. Move it on.
Here we go. We go. We go.

1061
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,400
Bring it down. Bring it down.

1062
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,919
Okay, let's connect
these fuel lines.

1063
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,591
Freedom on the left,
lndependence on the right.

1064
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:12,154
All right. We're goin' left here.

1065
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,758
To the right is fuel gauge.
You watch the fuel gauge. 150, okay.

1066
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:22,994
160, okay. 200, bad disaster
for space station.

1067
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:28,108
So if you watch 200,
you can call for Lev, on,
and you see here number one, on.

1068
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,839
You ask for Lev. And you pull
this down, all the way down.

1069
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:35,675
- What's Lev?
- l am Lev Andropov,
colonel of Russian space agency.

1070
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,309
ln Russia l'm a very big man.

1071
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,039
- We're ready to transfer.
- l'm coming. No problem.

1072
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,951
You. You. You there!

1073
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,754
- Hard locked.
- Ready for transfusion!

1074
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,951
Fuel is pumping.

1075
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,598
Hey, Lev, the, uh, the-the pressure's
climbing. ls there a problem here?

1076
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,830
Houston, we're on
fuel transference.

1077
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,993
Don't touch my uncle. You know?
He's a genius of my family.

1078
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,759
Lev! Can anybody hear me?
Guys? Hello, guys.

1079
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,348
He used to work
for a big bomb factory.

1080
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:26,319
He used to make the tip of the bomb,
the thing that finds, uh...

1081
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,908
New York or Washington, you know?

1082
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,310
- Ooh.
- Check your hoses.
We got some thermal variation.

1083
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:35,796
Stamper, let's look at the couplings
back on the shuttle.

1084
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:40,078
Okay. Shut down. Uh--

1085
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,592
- Guys!
- Hold on a second.
- What's that noise?

1086
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,393
Oh, no! God!

1087
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:00,469
- What is it?
- Leak! Leak! Leak!

1088
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:06,359
Get your men
back to the shuttle! Go!

1089
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,557
Go on! Hurry up!
Get out of there!

1090
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,676
Now there's really sparks!

1091
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,639
- Pull lever!
- This is the lever!

1092
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:19,349
- Colonel, we must get him out of there!
- A.J., come on out!

1093
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,075
Hurry! Hurry!

1094
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,270
Emergency! Break away!

1095
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,153
We got a fire
in the fuel pod!

1096
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,394
- Come on!
- Come on! Get in here!
A.J.'s stuck in the fuel pod!

1097
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,989
- We're losing it!
- Come on out of there!

1098
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,194
Control, this is lndependence.
l am seeing vibration--

1099
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,473
- Malloy, talk to me!
- Not good. We got sparks
and fire in the fuel pod.

1100
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,434
- lndependence, blow those locks
and get outta there now!
- Dump the hoses now! We're going!

1101
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:09,439
- What happened?
Let me shut off the O2 feed!
- Harry, it's burnin' up!

1102
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,798
Damn! Max, Rock, get in here! Get down
there and crack these pipes over here!

1103
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,754
- Harry, no! lt's burnin' up!
- We're goin' back for the other team!

1104
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,150
Switch on the personnel locators.

1105
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,157
Trackin' A.J. He's climbin'.

1106
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,515
- No!
- Go! Go!

1107
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:29,918
lt's too late! Get back to the shuttle!
This thing's gonna blow!

1108
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,598
No!

1109
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:36,794
Colonel, we gotta move now!
Come on! You're gonna die!

1110
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,514
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
We got a man in there!
- Open that door and we'll all die!

1111
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,234
- Fuel leak!
- Get out of there!

1112
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,508
Evac now! Let's go! Let's go!

1113
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,995
Come on back!
No, wait! The door is broken!

1114
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,193
- No!
- They got the fire
sealed in the fuel pod.

1115
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,311
- They locked it down.
- Tracking 'em back to the shuttle.

1116
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,477
They've still got two men
trapped in there!

1117
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,832
Keep running! The shuttle's another
75 feet! Where's the rest of the team?

1118
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,157
- Let's get out of here! The pod--
- Wait, wait, wait! Where's A.J.?
- A.J.'s gone!

1119
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:14,229
- We're not leavin' without A.J.!
- He's gone! lt's too late!

1120
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,788
Come on!
This way is our only chance!

1121
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,235
So it's minus 100!

1122
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,397
Very cold. Hold breath,
or lung freezes!

1123
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,594
Get back to the shuttle!
And lock that door!

1124
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:35,633
- Come on!
- Hurry, A.J.!
- Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

1125
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:38,598
- l tried! l tried. But A.J.--
- lt's on fire! lt's on fire, Harry!

1126
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,154
- lt's them or all of us!
- lt's on fire!

1127
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,794
- Full thrust.
- We're gonna get hit.

1128
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:03,552
Lev! Lev, the door's gonna blow!

1129
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,591
No!

1130
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:12,235
We're going! lt's gonna blow!

1131
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,989
- A.J.'s still in there!
- Blow the locks. No, the bolts!

1132
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:20,272
- We've gotta blow--
- l think we're almost there!

1133
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,113
Flight, lndependence
does not have A.J. They're gonna
close the door without him.

1134
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,272
- Tracking. They're 75 feet
from the shuttle.
- Just tell them to air lock
the door and go!

1135
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,755
- Dog the hatch now!
- Close it!

1136
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,951
Ho--

1137
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,511
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Colonel! That thing's
comin' right for us! We got to move!

1138
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,232
Hurry up!
There's the shuttle door!

1139
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,676
Fire's coming at us!
Close the door now!

1140
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,870
Go! Go! Go!

1141
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,992
Freedom, the lndependence crew
is on board and accounted for.

1142
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:14,079
- We're even heavy one cosmonaut.
- They got 90% of their fuel.

1143
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:19,515
-Pretty intense, huh?
-That's why l told you, ''Touch nothing.''

1144
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,471
But you're bunch of cowboys.

1145
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,114
So while the consciousness
of the planet is unified...

1146
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,954
focused on the NASA mission taking place
right now in the vast ocean of space...

1147
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,634
we're now in the final hours
of the mission...

1148
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,877
as the Freedom and lndependence
prepare to slingshot around the moon.

1149
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:51,478
Morning, guys. lt's time to suit up,
l guess. Uh, we got a big day.

1150
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:55,189
- Eighteen seconds to radio interrupt.
- Booster sequence confirmed.

1151
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,238
This is Houston.
Roger that, Freedom. We copy.

1152
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:02,677
- Shuttles are ready
for the burn around the moon.
- Radio contact terminated. We're out.

1153
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,237
Nine and a half Gs for 11 minutes.
l'd start praying about right now.

1154
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:17,199
So this is the part where we're supposed
to just hold on real tight and, uh,
hope we don't die.

1155
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:20,790
- Stand by for lunar roll.
- High inclination. Lunar orbit.

1156
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,468
You boys got those wills
filled out correctly?

1157
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:44,037
All right, men, this is what
we trained for. Now just suck it up!

1158
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,435
On the mark. Five, four...

1159
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,028
three, two, one.

1160
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,953
- ls this supposed to be like this?
- Don't worry. This is normal.

1161
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,356
- How would you know?
- 14,000 miles an hour.

1162
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,074
- Four Gs.
- How long does this last?

1163
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,031
Six Gs.

1164
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,952
- 15,000.
- Really heavy, man!
- This isn't normal.

1165
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,072
- What do you mean, ''this isn't normal''?
- This is way worse!

1166
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,357
- Eight Gs. Hang tight!
- l'm not gonna make it!

1167
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,994
Oh, we're gonna die!

1168
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,270
Twelve minutes.
Flight, we still got nothin' here.

1169
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,031
This is too fast!

1170
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,310
Ten Gs!

1171
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:52,475
We're maxed at 22,500!

1172
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,356
We have acquisition of signal
from lndependence and Freedom.

1173
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,278
We're in, guys.
All right. Welcome back, team.

1174
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,550
We have visual
of the target, Houston.

1175
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,510
You see that?

1176
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,670
Wow.

1177
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,916
- Come in, lndependence.
- Houston, you gotta see this
to believe it.

1178
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,276
Okay, team, let's take 'em in. Okay,
Quincy, how much tail debris do we have?

1179
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,436
Freedom, turn on your FOD radar.

1180
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,988
FOD radar on.

1181
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:47,556
Everybody, hang on. This could get
a little rough. Engaging evasive radar.

1182
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,277
Hold on!

1183
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,232
Goddam! We got debris!

1184
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,997
We're dumping auxiliary boosters.

1185
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,788
- Houston, do you read me?
- We got debris!

1186
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,313
- We're goin' in!
- We're comin' in hot!

1187
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,959
lndependence, try to maintain
your present heading.
You've got a target L.Z.

1188
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:43,032
- There's too much debris!
We gotta peel off!
- Negative!

1189
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,431
We're hit!

1190
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,313
- Mayday, mayday!
- l've lost main thrusters.
Get 'em back up!

1191
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,670
Mayday, Houston, mayday!
We've lost R.C.S. thrusters!

1192
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,475
Mayday, Freedom, mayday! We are
out of control! We are going down!

1193
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,994
Do you read me?
Freedom, we are going down!

1194
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,670
We're gonna hit!

1195
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:30,071
Everybody, go to your own life support!
Lock yourself in the cargo bay!

1196
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:36,795
We are going down! Houston! Houston,
we are going down! We have lost control!

1197
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,950
l can't get it on!

1198
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,517
- Good luck, Freedom.
- Oh, my God, this is it.

1199
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,190
No! No!

1200
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:03,475
Pull it! Pull it! Go!

1201
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,472
Sharp, what the hell is that?
ls that the lndependence?

1202
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,556
Houston, lndependence is a dead stick.
They're not gonna make it.

1203
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,349
Houston, lndependence has gone down.

1204
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,189
When l touch this baby down,
full reverse thrust.

1205
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,232
- Fires on your right, Sharp!
- Reversing the thrusters!

1206
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,754
Hang tight! Hang tight!

1207
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:24,193
- Houston, we overshot our landing field
We overshot our landing field.
- Oh, no!

1208
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,875
God!

1209
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:04,149
lnitiate system light system check. Make
sure we can still get off this rock.

1210
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:07,716
Our electrical system is screwed.
l'm going to back-up. Fuel seals check.

1211
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,674
- Engine seals check.
Pressure seals check.
- Oh, God. Oh!

1212
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,871
Anyone hurt?

1213
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:22,838
Where's-- Where's the other shuttle?
What happened to the other shuttle?

1214
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,912
- lndependence is off the grid.
- ''Off the grid''?

1215
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,356
What are you, a freakin' cyborg?
What does that mean?

1216
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:33,155
Hey, you saw it yourself, right?
They're gone.

1217
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,115
Come in, Freedom. This is
CAPCOM Houston. Freedom, come in.

1218
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,915
This is CAPCOM Houston.
Come in, Freedom.

1219
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,838
- God!
- Let's just ask God
to take care of our friends.

1220
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,870
May they rest in peace.

1221
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,755
Amen.

1222
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,799
We got eight hours.

1223
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,117
Let's get this job done
and go home.

1224
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:09,233
Nothin'. Come on, Watts,
Sharp, somebody.

1225
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:12,039
This is CAPCOM Houston.

1226
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:17,678
Come in, Freedom. Freedom, come in.
This is CAPCOM Houston.

1227
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,995
- Maybe you shouldn't be here.
- Come in, Freedom.

1228
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:24,033
- l don't have anywhere else to go.
- Freedom, come in.
This is CAPCOM Houston.

1229
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,793
All right, let's get the tools unpacked
and fire up the Armadillo.

1230
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,872
- We're not getting a damn thing
on the inertial nav system.
- l know where we are.

1231
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,878
Please step away.
Radio signal's dead.

1232
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,754
l'm flipping the backup generator.
Radio signal's gonna be cut in half
till we get main power back.

1233
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,159
We're in segment 202, lateral grid 9,
site 15H-32, give or take a few yards.

1234
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,397
Captain America here
blew the landing by 26 miles.

1235
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:51,559
- How the hell do you know that?
- Because l'm a genius.

1236
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:55,116
The gauges will not read.
They're all peaked, like we're
plugged into some magnetic field.

1237
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,913
- Well, who on this spaceship
wants to know why?
- By all means.

1238
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,878
The reason we were shooting for grid 8
was because thermographics indicated...

1239
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,150
that grid 9
was compressed iron ferrite.

1240
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:07,273
Which means you landed us
on a goddam iron plate.

1241
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,918
All right. Well, you heard the man.
Let's wheel out the remote satellite
link. We need that radio.

1242
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,918
Oh, God, please tell me
we still got one of 'em.

1243
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,068
lndependence has flat-lined.

1244
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,151
Oscar! Oscar!

1245
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:10,155
Oh, God!

1246
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,557
Hello! Anyone!

1247
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:19,031
ls anyone else alive?
Somebody help me!

1248
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,428
A.J.!

1249
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:26,632
- Where are you?
- l'm here.

1250
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:35,112
Lev, there's no one else.
There's no one else.

1251
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:38,994
- l know.
- Oh, man.

1252
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,913
- Bear, where are you?
- A.J.! A.J.!

1253
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:46,392
l'm in the shuttle, man.

1254
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,556
Are you all right?

1255
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,875
l'm so glad to see you, man.

1256
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,072
l never thought l'd be so happy
to see your ugly face.

1257
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:57,750
- Houston, do you read? This is Freedom.
- Check your thrusters.

1258
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:01,953
- Houston, do you copy?
- ls everyone good to go?

1259
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,357
Wow.

1260
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:26,270
Down here! ln the valley!

1261
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,960
This place is like
Dr Seuss's worst nightmare.

1262
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:33,790
Let's get the remote satellite.
We'll get better reception up there.

1263
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,550
Bring Max down.
Watch yourself through here, Max.
There's a couple big fissures.

1264
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:41,274
To the left!
Bring it to the left!

1265
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:51,038
Rockhound, you come on down here
and take some readings
down in the flat spot.

1266
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,837
lron ferrite.

1267
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:01,558
- l have fire.
- Watts, l'm comin' back. Stand by.

1268
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:05,428
- Mostly iron, Rockhound.
- God, l hate knowing everything.

1269
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:08,358
We couldn't have picked
a worse spot to drill.

1270
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:12,393
Well, l can pretty much guarantee
it's not gonna be thicker than 50 feet.

1271
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,193
- How do you figure that?
- 'Cause if it is, we're screwed.

1272
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:19,948
- Max, you good?
- Yeah. Just makin' hole.

1273
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:23,077
- Turn it around.
- Friggin' outer space.

1274
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,315
lt's good.

1275
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,270
All right. We're in.
Bring another light.
We're cuttin' through pretty good.

1276
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,636
There's some stuff in here
l ain't never seen.

1277
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,156
All right, let's punch it down!

1278
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:47,078
- Hey, Harry, did you see that?
- Yeah, Max, l see it. l see it.
What is it?

1279
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,397
- We lost the bite in the bit.
- All right. Back it off. Back it off.

1280
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,990
- Goddam it!
- Sounds like we twisted a shank.
Back it out of there, Max.

1281
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,997
Good. Good. Hold 'er there.

1282
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,873
Wow, this is
a goddam Greek tragedy.

1283
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,873
- We've all seen
broken drill heads before.
- Not after ten feet.

1284
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,793
- l never seen one.
- Well, now you've seen one.

1285
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,195
- What do you want?
- Unpack the Judge.

1286
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,109
Bear, Lev.

1287
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,636
We're only three
astronauts left now.

1288
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,309
We're not astronauts.
We're oil drillers.
We're not even supposed to be here.

1289
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,755
What? You're not astronaut?

1290
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,075
l'm getting us outta here. Get in.

1291
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:32,118
- Why?
- Just get in the Armadillo.
l have an idea.

1292
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:36,398
Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?
Houston, do you copy?
Freedom shuttle has--

1293
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,949
We're gettin' some scattered video feeds
here so we're gonna have to lead over.

1294
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,600
Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?

1295
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,871
- Thank God we have you, Freedom.
- Freedom, this is Houston. Go ahead.
- Don't lose 'em, Malloy.

1296
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,231
Sir, we're getting something. Houston,
this is Freedom. We have landed safely.

1297
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,557
- We are at site coordinates
approximately 15H-32--
- Where are they?

1298
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:56,473
- Okay, l want to know everything
we can about that location.
- Got it.
- Get it before we lose 'em.

1299
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:59,996
- We're also having electric
and antenna difficulties.
- Walter, get Mechanical on that.

1300
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:03,715
- But we have commenced drilling.
- Stevens, we're losin' him.
Bring it up on four.

1301
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:07,435
- Come on.
- On four.
- Shuttle flight capability
not yet known.

1302
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,755
- Bump the signal.
- Bumping.
- Houston. Houston.

1303
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,229
We lost 'em. Get 'em back.
Gruber, we need that hook-up.

1304
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:17,558
l'll show you how we do things
where l come from.

1305
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,358
Hold on!

1306
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,231
Seat it.

1307
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,515
All right, get ready.
Max, thread it.

1308
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:44,118
Guys, the clock is tickin'.
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

1309
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,475
All right! Good!
Crank it loose!

1310
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:49,398
Keep it at 25. Let's kick
a little asteroid butt!

1311
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,870
All right, Chick. Give me
more torque on the turbine, huh?

1312
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,036
- Max, l need some more power down here!
- All right, boss.

1313
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,192
-Throw it forward, then drop the hammer.
-Let's drill through this turd.

1314
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,919
Come on, boys. We gotta hop.
We're fallin' behind.

1315
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,833
Dig, dig, dig.
Chew this iron bitch up.

1316
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,397
- Chick, the tranny is stuck.
- Harry!

1317
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,392
- What is it?
- Chick, come on! Help!

1318
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,311
- Release the clutch!
- Pull it up!

1319
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:18,358
Okay. Well, this thing's
not movin'.

1320
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,954
No, no, no!
Shut it down! Shut it--

1321
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,036
This is not workin' out, Harry.

1322
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:35,194
- Oh, are you all right?
- Oh, blew the tranny. Blew the tranny.

1323
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,959
Come on, God.

1324
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,629
Just a little help.
That's all l'm askin'.

1325
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,957
l think we're close enough.
He might've heard ya.

1326
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,833
Here's the bad news.
Before the asteroid passed the moon...

1327
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:52,997
her rotation was stable
at 32 degrees on an X axis.

1328
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:57,113
But now look at this.
The lunar gravity's put her in a spin.

1329
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:00,510
She's tumbling on all three axes.
This wasn't expected, sir.

1330
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,995
- What does this do for communications?
- Not good.

1331
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:07,232
We'll have definite contact with the
shuttle for only seven more minutes.
After that, it's radio darkness.

1332
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:12,309
- For how long?
- And after seven minutes,
we may never hear from them again.

1333
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:16,149
But we're trying to bounce a signal off
a Russian military satellite,
reestablish contact that way.

1334
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:20,438
lf we lose the shuttle com,
when do we lose the ability
to remote detonate that nuke?

1335
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,988
The weapon remote receives
a signal from a Milstar satellite.

1336
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,116
Higher orbit,
more powerful transmitter.

1337
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:29,233
lf we've got the shuttle
for seven minutes, we can remote
detonate for an additional five.

1338
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,471
What he's trying to say, General,
is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time
you may lose the ability...

1339
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,994
to detonate the nuke permanently.

1340
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,957
l've got to inform
the president.

1341
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:42,115
Just want to make sure you know
we're stuck on an asteroid.
Do you know what you're doing now?

1342
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:45,915
No, no. You know what? l have no idea
what l'm doing. l have no idea.

1343
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:48,315
This button-- l don't know
what that does, okay?

1344
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:53,594
All l know is that we just crashed
back there, l lost two of my friends,
we're 25 miles from Harry's shuttle.

1345
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:56,114
We don't know if he's alive.
We don't know if he can fly.

1346
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:00,432
All l know is there's a beep on this
thing and l'm trying to get us there.

1347
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:10,357
Let's get it unpacked.

1348
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:13,955
- What's up?
- We're drilling through some kind
of metal l've never seen before.

1349
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,992
lt's fried two of our drill bits,
and now we blew our first transmission.

1350
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,918
- So how deep are we?
- We could use your help
with the transmission, Colonel.

1351
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:24,352
l have an assessment report due now.
We're supposed to be at 200 feet.
So how deep are we?

1352
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:28,029
Not as deep as we'll be when
you quit askin' me all these questions
and help us load this transmission on.

1353
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:31,357
- What is our current depth?
- Our current depth
is not important, Colonel.

1354
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:36,793
l'll decide what's important.
We've got 800 feet to drill. You've had
two and a half hours. Where are we?

1355
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:44,478
We're at 57 feet. Now,
if you're not too busy, maybe you can
give us a hand with this transmission.

1356
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:49,594
Colonel Sharp! Get this wrapped up.
l'll be right back. Colonel Sharp!

1357
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,831
All right. l'm coming through.
We have contact. Over.

1358
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:57,795
- That's as clear as it's gonna get.
- Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?

1359
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,879
Working at a remote satellite link
at this moment. Transmission change.

1360
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:04,474
- Colonel!
- Twenty minutes.
Puts drilling final at ten hours.

1361
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:08,195
Please advise. That's four hours past
the zero barrier. Please advise.

1362
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,073
What the hell is this?
''Zero depth''?

1363
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,668
And where'd this come from?
Who are you talkin' to? ls that Truman?

1364
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:18,032
Let me have that phone.
Gimme the phone. Truman! Look,
this is what happens when you drill.

1365
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:23,592
We cannot use your ''U.S. Air Force
Personnel Only'' drill time card.
Who wrote this thing, by the way?

1366
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:27,076
- We're losing coms again.
- Look-- ls he getting this? Does he
hear me or-- What's wrong with this?

1367
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,031
- The com's down.
- What do you mean, ''the com's down''?

1368
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:33,756
- What do l mean? l mean we've
lost communication to mission control.
- Fine. Let's go back to the cargo bay
and get the transmission--

1369
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,759
Hey, Harry, guess what.
You had your shot. You didn't do it.
You understand me? You can't--

1370
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:42,476
Why don't you stay here and take you
and take your little drill card--
Write a report, why don't ya?

1371
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:47,310
That'll be a-- My men and l
will go and get this hole dug!

1372
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:51,029
You and your men are the biggest
mistake in the history of NASA.

1373
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:56,153
- We've lost communication.
- Oh, God.

1374
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:01,718
We're not lookin'
too good right now.

1375
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:05,588
No shit.
We gotta get that radio back up.

1376
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:10,718
Mr President,
it's time to make a decision.

1377
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,032
We can remote detonate the bomb
for only another five minutes.

1378
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:20,628
Yes? Kimsey here.
Yes, Mr President.

1379
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:23,274
Yes, we saw that too, sir.

1380
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:26,278
But maybe we should wait
until they--

1381
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:36,955
Dan, get them out of there.
Evac right now.

1382
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,032
- What's goin' on here?
- l've been ordered
to override the system.

1383
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:46,955
Well, what is this?

1384
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,474
Secondary protocol.

1385
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:02,030
But they haven't drilled
the damn hole yet!

1386
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:09,114
The president's advisors feel that
the drilling isn't working. And we've
lost radio contact, maybe for good.

1387
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:12,476
We've only got a few minutes
left of guaranteed ability
to remote detonate that nuke.

1388
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,915
lf we don't do it now we could lose
control, and we may never get it back.

1389
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,759
Well, you tell the president that
he better fire his so-called advisors.

1390
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:21,350
And if you detonate
that nuke on the surface,
we waste a perfectly good bomb...

1391
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:24,278
and we have one chance
to save this planet!

1392
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,636
l need that radio.

1393
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:38,792
-Gruber, give me everything you got now!
-Roger that.

1394
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:45,636
Yes, Mr President,
l understand that completely,
but my point is very, very simple.

1395
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:48,513
And l think you need to trust me on
this because l know something about it.

1396
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:51,154
l guarantee you, if you do this,
you kill us all.

1397
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,830
Yes, sir.

1398
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,190
General, he wants you.

1399
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,512
This is Kimsey. Yes, sir.

1400
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,551
l understand.

1401
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:12,354
The orders are
to remote detonate in 30 seconds.

1402
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,914
You have not told them yet!

1403
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,349
That is my father up there!

1404
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:20,631
- This is one order you shouldn't
follow, and you fucking know it!
- No! Don't touch me!

1405
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,354
Let her go. Let her go!

1406
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,120
Your key, sir.

1407
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,439
God be with them.

1408
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,472
Slow it down.

1409
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,197
Harry...

1410
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:48,029
the clock on that nine-foot
nuclear weapon is ticking.

1411
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:53,631
Oh, my God! Sharp!
Get back here now!

1412
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,796
Watts, get the shuttle
ready to evac now!

1413
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:58,633
- lt just came on all by itself.
What-- What the hell's happening?
- Secondary protocol.

1414
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:01,274
- What's that? What?
- Wait a minute.
- Secondary protocol.
- What does that mean?

1415
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,669
- What the hell's secondary protocol?
- They're detonating this thing
from Earth.

1416
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,637
- What do you mean, detonating? We
haven't even drilled the hole yet!
- We'll drop it in the hole.

1417
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,230
- What're you talkin' about?
- The hole? Whoa, whoa!
- Get your helmets on now!
- Oh, no, no. How-How you turn it off?

1418
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:13,279
- Colonel Sharp,
l got two men out on that rock!
- l got a man out there too.
We gotta evac now!

1419
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:16,636
- Max, Rockhound, get back
to the shuttle, double-time!
- They could be on their way here.

1420
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:20,679
They're not on their way here.
They would've talked to us by now.
We would've seen them.

1421
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,792
- Watts, air lock the cockpit now!
- l copy you.

1422
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:28,476
- Max, Rockhound!
- Hey, wait a minute!
How do you turn this thing off?
- Max, Rockhound--

1423
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,391
- Harry, do you copy?
- Somethin's wrong.

1424
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:35,110
- Yeah, it's all wrong, man.
We shouldn't even be up here.
- l know. Let's go back to the ship!

1425
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:40,678
- l'm not leavin' without my men, Sharp.
- We've got two and a half minutes to
drop it and get off this rock.

1426
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,155
lf they're not back by the time
we finish, we leave without 'em.

1427
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,549
Okay, let's simplify this.
Let's just turn the bomb off right now.

1428
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:48,200
lf we don't put this bomb down in
a hole 800 feet onto a fault line...

1429
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,550
all you're gonna have
is a real expensive fireworks show.

1430
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:53,074
This is turnin' into
a surrealistic nightmare here.

1431
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:55,469
Watsler, are you listening?
lt's Truman.

1432
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:59,348
Okay, listen to me carefully.
l want you to kill it. Kill the uplink.

1433
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,597
- Give us the time, Sharp.
Shut this bomb down now!
- lt's not my call.

1434
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:16,558
- Then whose call is it?
- Who made it?
- An order to detonate can only
come from the president.

1435
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:18,750
- The president's not here!
You've gotta give us more time!
- Let's just turn it off now.

1436
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,713
- l'm telling you
to shut this bomb down now!
- And l'm telling you it's not my call!

1437
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:25,156
- Well, guess what.
l just made the call for you.
- Harry!

1438
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:30,118
Don't. You could set it off.

1439
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:33,710
Oh, man. What're you doin'
with a gun in space?

1440
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:41,236
Come on. Come on. We gotta stop that
bomb right now. Kill the uplink.

1441
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:46,394
- This thing is gonna blow.
We gotta get it off the ship.
- Easy.

1442
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:51,634
- Stand down, Sergeant.
- Shut this bomb down and let us
finish our job the right way.

1443
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:54,280
l'm under orders to protect
a surface detonation.

1444
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:59,030
l'm gonna give you three seconds
to shut this bomb down,
and then l'm gonna make you shoot me.

1445
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,953
Hurry, Watsler.
For Christ's sake, hurry.

1446
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,351
What happened?

1447
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:15,238
Sir, the override--
lt's been overridden.

1448
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:19,353
l've bought us a couple
of minutes, so get that radio
workin', okay? Hurry, hurry!

1449
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:25,597
Bring me all the way up here just to
blow me and my friends up? ls that it?

1450
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,517
- Listen--
- Shut up!

1451
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,149
Shut up, Colonel.
l'm talking now.

1452
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:35,518
lt could start again.
lt might've been a warning.

1453
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:38,598
- Uh-oh.
- That's why you are gonna
dismantle this bomb.

1454
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:41,473
All right. What'd we miss?

1455
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,876
- Do it again.
- Go.

1456
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:53,398
Keep tryin'.

1457
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:59,276
Sir, l need you to cease and desist.
l need your terminal now.

1458
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,197
- Oh, they're reactivating the bomb.
- Comin' back on-line, sir.

1459
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,993
Oh, geez. Here we go again.

1460
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:11,237
What're you doin' up here? And why
did you even bother to make the trip?

1461
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,113
To do the right thing,
to see that it's done.

1462
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:24,359
For God's sakes,
think about what you're doin'.

1463
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,790
Why are you listenin' to someone
that's 100,000 miles away?

1464
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:31,350
We're here.
Nobody down there can help us.

1465
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:34,910
So if we don't get this job done,
then everybody's gone.

1466
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,474
One minute.

1467
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,194
l've been drillin' holes
in the Earth for 30 years.

1468
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:44,871
And l have never, never missed
a depth that l have aimed for.

1469
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,037
And by God, l am not gonna miss
this one. l will make 800 feet.

1470
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:51,152
42 seconds.

1471
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:54,232
But l can't do it alone, Colonel.
l need your help.

1472
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,596
You swear on your daughter's life,
on my family's...

1473
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:00,194
that you can hit that mark?

1474
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:04,233
l will make 800 feet.
l swear to God, l will.

1475
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:07,193
Then let's turn this bomb off.

1476
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:21,675
Steady. Steady.
Take it back. That's what you'll
have to do. Get 'em off backwards.

1477
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:24,712
- Rainbow track? Under--
Under one? Under-- Okay.
- All of 'em. All of 'em. All of 'em!

1478
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:28,435
- Okay. Okay. Are we free of static?
- Oh, do a good job. Do a good job.

1479
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:32,149
- Steady. Steady.
- Good job. All right.
All right. All right.
- Go! Go! Go!

1480
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:36,159
Red wire ''A.'' Ready? And-- Now.
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

1481
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:41,234
- Negative ''B.'' Ready, and now.
- Do a good job. Do a good job.

1482
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,550
- Track flipped. Hots in.
- lt better be. Go.

1483
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:45,398
Red or blue?

1484
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,991
Wait--

1485
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,669
Blue.

1486
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:00,996
- Good job!
- You got it.

1487
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:06,831
Oh, God, it sucks up here.

1488
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:11,072
- Sir, the clock has stopped
at three seconds.
- What?

1489
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,316
Have we lost
complete radio contact?

1490
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:16,836
l got some magic happening.
We're bouncing off Russian and French
satellites. lt may have a faint signal.

1491
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:19,599
Houston? Houston, do you copy?

1492
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:23,310
Go ahead, Freedom.

1493
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,398
Houston, you have a problem--
Problem.

1494
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:30,268
See, l promised my little girl
that l'd be comin' home.

1495
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:32,999
Now, l don't know what you
people are doin' down there...

1496
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:35,833
but we got a hole
to dig up here.

1497
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,639
Go, go, go, go! Come on.
We got work to do.

1498
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:41,797
Okay, guys. All go, no quit.
How ya doin' down there? Good?

1499
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,673
Okay, got the tranny.
We're back in business.

1500
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:48,036
Hey, you guys should take a break
and come up and see this.

1501
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:52,353
Wow. Got a great view
of the Earth from here.

1502
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:54,590
Too bad we'll never
set foot on her again.

1503
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,796
- Lev, do you see anything?
- No.

1504
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,757
Well, keep goin'.
l'm not givin' up.

1505
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,956
Hold up here, Bear.

1506
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:04,116
- Oh, boy.
- This is great.

1507
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:06,959
We just happen to run into
the Grand Canyon on the asteroid?

1508
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:10,231
l told you, you took
a wrong way, a wrong road.

1509
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:13,437
What-- What road? Do you see
any roads around here?

1510
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:17,433
You know what? l do not have
much pleasure being near God's ear.

1511
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,988
But you think this is
looking good, or what?

1512
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:24,358
Lev, why don't you just do humanity
a favour and just shut the hell up?

1513
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,915
Have you ever heard
of Evel Knievel?

1514
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,270
No, l never saw Star Wars.

1515
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,635
All right.
Doin' a good job.

1516
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,069
- Give me a depth reading, Max.
- We're 150 feet, Harry.

1517
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:52,829
Ride 'em, cowboy!
Yippee-kai-yo, kai-yay!

1518
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:56,959
Get off the nuclear warhead.

1519
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,951
l was doin' that guy
from that movie, you know...

1520
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:02,038
Slim Pickens, where he rides it
all the way in-- the nuclear warhead.

1521
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,833
- Now.
- Oh, you didn't see that one, huh?

1522
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:07,713
We got 700 feet of hole
to dig, Rockhound.

1523
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:11,634
All right. Just-- Just wanted to feel
the power between my legs, brother.

1524
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:15,070
Hey, Sharp.

1525
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:18,232
No nukes! No nukes!
No nukes!

1526
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,231
You got any more bullets
in that gun, Sharp?

1527
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:23,079
What did Watts tell you, Bear?
lf she kicked you in the balls,
you'd keep floating.

1528
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:25,589
Yeah.

1529
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:30,315
We turn the thrusters off, we jump
this thing, we float right over it.

1530
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:32,992
Go over it again, Lev.

1531
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:36,396
Throw the jet thrusters off
exactly when we jump.

1532
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:40,035
- Okay.
- And then we're gonna put them on,
and we gonna go down nice and slow.

1533
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:43,391
- That's it. That's it, baby. That's it.
- ls this gonna work?

1534
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:47,519
- l don't know.
- Lev, you know what, just lie to me.

1535
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:51,115
Let's say 50-50--
No. More like, uh--

1536
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:53,276
like 70-30 or 80-20.

1537
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:58,753
But you know what? lf it works, the two
of you gonna be heroes, just like me.

1538
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:01,479
Screw it. We're jumpin'
over this canyon.

1539
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:08,631
Just for the record,
this is a very bad idea!

1540
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:15,639
- Wait for the edge now.
Wait till we get there. Wait--
- l'm waiting.

1541
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:18,558
- Here we come. Now, not till we do it.
- Three...

1542
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:20,949
- two, one!
- Here we go!

1543
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,116
Off!

1544
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:33,034
- Yes!
- lt's working!
- lt's working!

1545
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:36,232
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah!

1546
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:41,354
- l'm a genius! Wait a minute.
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1547
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:45,951
- We got some rocks!
- Go left! Go left!
- Lev! Lev, l can't do anything!

1548
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,799
Turn!

1549
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:57,953
Oh, okay, okay, we're
floating into outer space.

1550
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,230
- Check main switch.
- Uh, this could be
a little bit of a problem.

1551
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,670
- Thrusters on now!
- All right, turn 'em on.

1552
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:11,720
- What's wrong?
- l-l don't know. The-The thrusters
not working. l hate this machine!

1553
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:14,109
- l thought you had this planned!
What're we supposed to do?
- Be quiet! l must think!

1554
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:17,152
- l'm stepping outside.
- You're-You're going outside?

1555
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:22,593
l am the only certified astronaut,
and l'm saving your American ass!

1556
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,512
Yes. You'll listen
to him. Right.

1557
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:37,149
Hurry up, Lev, because we're
about a mile off the asteroid!

1558
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:40,357
Just a second.
The fuel line is iced up.

1559
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:44,678
- Yeah, l think maybe workin' now.
- No, Lev, it's not working!

1560
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:47,513
l'm sorry, A.J.
l was way off the odds.

1561
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:51,991
- We're gettin' higher, man.
- Look out! The rocks! Rocks are coming!

1562
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,551
Hold on!

1563
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,635
- Pull the thrusters!
- Lev, look out!

1564
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:16,636
- We lost Lev.
- A.J.!

1565
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:18,790
A.J., the thrusters!

1566
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,476
Let's get Lev back!

1567
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:34,909
Lev, hold on!
We're comin' in!

1568
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:54,719
Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord.
Thank You. Thank You,
thank You, thank You.

1569
01:50:57,240 --> 01:51:02,155
- Lev!
- Now l'm really a Russian hero!

1570
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:05,397
- l told you!
- l know!
- l knew this would work!

1571
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:08,796
-Good odds, you know?
-Come on, Lev. Get in here. We gotta go.

1572
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,870
Rockhound, keep
on that transmission.

1573
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,072
- Tranny looks good, Harry.
- All right. Take it outta there.

1574
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:22,709
Lock it down, Chick.

1575
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:25,274
Nice.

1576
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,914
How come we didn't get
any training on this thing?

1577
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:32,670
Whoa. Very cool. l could take out
this asteroid single-handedly.

1578
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:34,955
Okay, boys, give it a rest.
l'll take it from here.

1579
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:38,640
- Whoa!
- What the hell is that?

1580
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:42,309
-lt's Rockhound.
-Whoa. This is so much fun, it's freaky.

1581
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:46,276
Rockhound!

1582
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:48,396
Whoa, watch your heads.
Sorry, Harry.

1583
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:53,519
- Outta my way, boys!
- Rockhound!

1584
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:56,029
Meet your maker, asteroid!

1585
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:03,869
- What the hell's the matter
with you, Rockhound? Goddam!
- This is insane.

1586
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:07,316
- Have you lost your mind?
- He's got space dementia.

1587
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,510
Harry, you ought to
watch your man.

1588
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:16,909
Max, downshift slowly
and put it in reverse.
We gotta get that pipe outta there.

1589
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,110
Uh-oh.

1590
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:24,279
- What's happening?
- The ground's cracking!
- Earthquake!

1591
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:34,271
Quick, shut it off!

1592
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:38,797
- Shut it off! Shut it off now!
- We're gonna have a blowout!

1593
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:42,799
- We hit a gas pocket!
- We got pressure out the ass!

1594
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:47,155
Max, get your helmet on!
Max, it's gonna blow!

1595
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:50,238
- Oh, Jesus, l'm cooking!
- Max, get outta there!

1596
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:52,920
This is it!

1597
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,951
Harry!

1598
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,471
l'm bailing!

1599
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,953
Max!

1600
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:08,434
- Goodbye, Max.
- Max!

1601
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:11,438
- Take care, buddy.
- Armadillo's off the scope.

1602
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:13,551
- l think we've had a blowout.
- No sign of the Armadillo.

1603
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:15,750
Somebody punch up the Armadillo.

1604
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:46,269
Get ahold of Truman.

1605
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:50,319
Prepare the world
for bad news.

1606
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,391
We're getting sketchy information
that the mission has suffered
massive failure.

1607
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:05,274
And what we're trying to do
right now is to confirm that
and find out exactly what that means.

1608
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:08,198
Repeat: We're getting leaks
from several NASA officials...

1609
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:13,195
some rushing home
to be with their families,
that the drilling was unsuccessful.

1610
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:24,754
This could very well be
our final hour.

1611
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:30,357
We're gonna go
off the air now.

1612
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:33,233
Good luck
and God bless.

1613
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:38,392
- We've got incoming.
- l got tracks.

1614
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:42,433
NORAD's tracking four small
incoming over Europe. They think
one's about to hit near Paris.

1615
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:11,714
- Reports are coming in--
- Martial law has been implemented
in 42 countries.

1616
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:14,109
Once the asteroid hits
zero barrier...

1617
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:18,352
it will take about three hours
and 57 minutes to impact Earth.

1618
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,993
Well, l guess we do it
the president's way. l'll order an evac.
You can remote detonate.

1619
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:29,157
- You still don't think
this'll work, do you?
- Well, what l think is irrelevant.

1620
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:32,073
- We need to do it now.
- Fine.

1621
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:34,151
- Can they still take off?
- We hope so.

1622
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:36,236
You are the one
that pulled them into this!

1623
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:40,114
That is my family up there,
so l don't wanna hear, ''We hope so''!

1624
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:48,914
Guess what, guys?
lt's time to embrace the horror.

1625
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:52,510
Look. We got front-row tickets
to the end of the Earth.

1626
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:17,270
- Yeah! Way to go, baby!
- Harry!

1627
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:26,275
- Yeah!
- Yo, Harry! What's up, baby?

1628
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:29,193
Hey, get that bomb outta there!
We got a hole to make!

1629
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,636
Houston, you're not
gonna believe this...

1630
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:35,228
but the other Armadillo
has arrived.

1631
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:38,551
All right, people, listen up.
Settle down and focus.

1632
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:41,990
- Mechanical, get on-line.
- P.P.O., gimme a set-up.
- Your boyfriend's back.

1633
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,795
- Yo, Harry!
- You're awesome, baby!

1634
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:48,872
Hey, Harry.
You miss me?

1635
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,390
A.J., l got
just five words for ya.

1636
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:55,671
- Damn glad to see ya, boy!
- That's six words.

1637
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:59,110
- Chick, walk 'em down.
- So where's this hole you need dug?

1638
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:01,430
Houston, drilling has recommenced.

1639
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:06,918
- Do you think they can drill
250 feet in an hour?
- They better.

1640
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,514
Bring that piece on in, Bear.

1641
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:11,790
Tractor pull.

1642
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:15,435
- l'm comin' down!
- We got 250 feet to go.

1643
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:18,472
lt's our last transmission,
last drill head.

1644
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:22,434
Punch it through.
First gear. We got contact.

1645
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:25,990
Drive it on down, A.J.

1646
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:28,918
- l got this, man. Let's go!
- Lev, the right engine hub.

1647
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:33,192
- Houston, l'm getting no response
from the preflight sequence.
- Come on now. This is not--

1648
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:37,632
Hey. Hey, come here. Can you get me
outta here, please, Lev? Thank you.

1649
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:41,837
- Ow! Jesus! Hey!
- Wait. Uh, shh, shh.

1650
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:44,229
- Lev, the right engine--
- Okay.
- Lemme outta here, will ya?

1651
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:47,193
Just tryin' to have
some fun before l die!

1652
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:50,756
- How deep are we?
- Seven seventy.

1653
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:57,871
- Whoa, they got problems.
- The gauges are spiking.

1654
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,956
Methane! Shut it down!
Back it down!

1655
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:03,914
l can't pull back now. The bit'll
get lodged. We don't have enough time!

1656
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:07,635
Whoa, whoa, whoa! lt's gonna blow!
lt's how we lost Max!

1657
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:11,389
l know what l'm talkin' about.
We can punch through this.
We can knock this outta the park.

1658
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:13,914
- This is our last transmission, A.J.
- Goddam it!

1659
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:18,158
lf you're ever gonna trust me, ever,
once in your life, trust me now!

1660
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:22,392
- Harry, it's gonna blow!
- Harry, l know what l'm doin'.
You just gotta trust me.

1661
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:26,516
Make the call.

1662
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:30,794
All right. Hold on.
l'm pushin' through her.

1663
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:38,794
l'm pushin' through her!

1664
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:41,718
- What's your depth?
- Seven seventy-five. Seven eighty.

1665
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:45,196
Take it up, baby! Ram it home!

1666
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:49,154
- Drive on down, A.J.!
- Seven eighty-five. Come on. Come on.

1667
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:52,152
- Come on, A.J.!
- Punch it!
- Ninety-one. Come on.

1668
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:55,272
Seven ninety-two.
Seven ninety-five!

1669
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:57,868
Drive it down, A.J.!

1670
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,389
Seven ninety-seven!
Ninety-nine!

1671
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:03,597
- Breakthrough!
- Eight hundred! 802, Harry!

1672
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:07,269
- Yeah!
- We did it!
- Harry, we did it!

1673
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:08,879
- Yes!
- We did it!

1674
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:12,913
- Yeah! Kid, way to go!
- l knew it, baby!

1675
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:16,749
- lt's not over till we get
the bomb down that hole.
- Watts, they've got 38 minutes.

1676
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:41,231
- Harry, you've gotta give me that hole.
- l'm gonna need two more minutes.
l got a bent pipe jammed in the hole.

1677
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:44,955
We gotta cut it out before we can
send that bomb down. A.J.!

1678
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:47,753
- She good to go?
- Yeah, l'm all set.
- All right.

1679
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:56,034
- All right.
- A.J., come on! Make it fast!

1680
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:59,271
l'm goin' as fast as l can!
There's a lot of gas pressure!

1681
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:08,791
- You feel that?
- Harry, you gotta give me that hole.
The bomb is almost ready.

1682
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:12,595
- Pull that pipe out!
- Harry, l'm almost through!
Give me 15 more seconds!

1683
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:20,840
Well, this is somethin' new.

1684
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:26,668
- l don't think this thing likes us.
- That's 'cause it knows
we're here to kill it.

1685
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:34,314
Hey, what's goin' on
up there?

1686
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:41,868
- A.J.!
- What the hell was that?

1687
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,912
- A.J.!
- Goddam it, l'm finished!

1688
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:49,034
- A.J., you all right?
- Oh, lot of gas pressure in here, man!

1689
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:51,793
- Get me out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hydrogen pocket!

1690
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:11,516
Harry! Pull me in!

1691
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:18,036
A.J., hang on!

1692
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:25,120
Secure the bomb!

1693
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:27,879
Sharp, heads up!

1694
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:29,951
Gruber! Get outta there now!

1695
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:33,192
Oh, no.

1696
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:42,797
Oh, God, no!

1697
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:50,428
Look out!

1698
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:56,236
Help! Oh, no!

1699
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:05,715
Do you believe
that just happened?

1700
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,960
- Sharp, you all right?
- l'm okay.

1701
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:13,110
- Bear?
- Yeah. l'm here, Harry.

1702
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:15,595
- A.J.?
- Yeah, l'm okay.

1703
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:20,071
We lost Gruber.

1704
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:25,199
- Gruber's dead.
- Let's get that bomb ready and go home.

1705
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:35,110
Oh, my God.

1706
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:39,313
- ls there a problem, Colonel?
- The timer, the remote,
the whole thing's dead.

1707
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:41,396
What, the bomb is dead?

1708
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:45,877
No, the trigger's dead. lt must've
gotten damaged during the rock storm.

1709
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:50,354
So how do we detonate it?

1710
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:03,756
We have 18 minutes to zero barrier.
We got some bad news.

1711
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:06,872
The remote detonator on the bomb
has been damaged.

1712
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,719
That means that somebody's
gonna have to stay behind.

1713
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:14,435
lt takes two people
to fly this thing.

1714
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:19,275
Either we all stay and die,
or you guys draw straws.

1715
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:22,909
l say we all stay and die.
But that's me.

1716
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:27,316
l'll draw. Let's draw.

1717
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:30,668
Nobody's gonna draw straws.

1718
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:33,394
- l'll stay and take care of it.
- Well, l can't live
with that sort of thing.

1719
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,397
- Nobody asked you if you could
live with it, all right?
- Bullshit!

1720
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:37,994
No way l will let you
volunteer for this...

1721
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:41,629
so l can go back to my home country
like the man who didn't volunteer.

1722
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:43,551
No way!

1723
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:47,758
Hey, man, let's draw, and let's see
who's gonna stay up here and dance.

1724
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:50,519
Guys, l-l-l know you guys
think l'm crazy right now...

1725
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:54,235
but l would really like
this responsibility.

1726
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:56,920
All right. All right.

1727
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:59,110
- l can do it.
- Let's just draw straws and
get it over with. Come on.

1728
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:01,031
l ain't drawin'
against you, Harry.

1729
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:05,352
Well, l'm gonna draw against you, Chick,
so you better just go ahead and do it.

1730
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:07,596
Just gimme this thing.

1731
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:16,554
ls this good or bad?

1732
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:24,995
Oh, man.

1733
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:27,719
Well, we all gotta die, right?

1734
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:33,793
l'm the guy who gets
to do it saving the world.

1735
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:37,156
So, uh, let's go. We-We got
about ten minutes, right?

1736
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:40,837
You plug this into the port.

1737
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:45,311
Lift, press, hold. That's it.

1738
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:49,313
Lift, press, hold. Shouldn't be
too tough. Even l can't screw this up.

1739
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:51,914
l'll take him down.

1740
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:30,156
Do me a favour, will ya?
Just tell Grace that, uh--

1741
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:32,874
that l'll always be
with her, okay?

1742
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,831
Can you do that?

1743
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:40,396
Yeah. Okay, kid.

1744
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:48,191
Give this to Truman.

1745
02:05:48,280 --> 02:05:52,239
Make sure Truman gets that.
Get in there.

1746
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:59,110
lt's my turn now.

1747
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:02,555
Harry! Harry!

1748
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:06,036
You can't do this to me!

1749
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:08,037
lt's my job!

1750
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:12,079
You go take care of my little girl now.
That's your job.

1751
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:18,032
Always thought of you
as a son. Always.

1752
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:23,639
But l'd be damn proud
to have you marry Grace.

1753
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:26,274
- Harry.
- You take care of yourself.

1754
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:28,271
- Harry, no!
- l love you, pal.

1755
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:31,153
Harry, l love you!
Don't, Harry! Wait a minute!

1756
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:33,669
- My son.
- No, don't do this, Harry!

1757
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:36,234
You don't do this! Harry!

1758
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:46,430
What happened?

1759
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:49,034
That crazy,
stubborn son of a--

1760
02:06:55,120 --> 02:06:58,556
Well, this was
a real good idea.

1761
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:01,990
All right, let's go, Sharp.
Let's get our team outta here.

1762
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:11,430
Come on! Let's get ready
to initiate thrusters! Let's go!

1763
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:14,028
- l mean it, guys!
- Get the O2 masks.

1764
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:16,720
- Are they free? Are they free?
- B.P.U., set.

1765
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:20,196
l cannot believe this is going down
like this. You all right?

1766
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:23,636
- O2 vents locked, pressure loaded.
- Engine board is green.

1767
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:28,679
T minus three minutes
and counting.

1768
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:31,274
Houston, do you copy?
This is Harry Stamper.

1769
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:34,909
lt's down there.

1770
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:40,750
- Electrical systems primed.
- B.P.U. is set. Oxidizers are loading.

1771
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:45,032
Houston, we're outta here
in T minus three minutes.

1772
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:47,230
Daddy?

1773
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:50,278
Hi, Gracie. Hi, honey.

1774
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:53,670
Grace, l know l promised you
l was comin' home.

1775
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:57,031
l don't under-- understand.

1776
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:01,517
Looks like l'm gonna have to
break that promise.

1777
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:07,673
l, um--
l lied to you too...

1778
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:10,360
when l told you that
l didn't want to be like you.

1779
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:14,191
Because l am like you.

1780
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:19,758
And everything good that l have
inside of me, l have from you.

1781
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:22,354
l love you so much, Daddy.

1782
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:25,119
l'm so proud of you.

1783
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:27,356
l'm so scared.

1784
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:29,516
l'm so scared.

1785
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:34,435
l know it, baby, but there won't be
anything to be scared of soon.

1786
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:42,159
Gracie, l want you to know
that A.J. saved us. He did.

1787
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:45,476
l want you to tell Chick...

1788
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:49,314
that l couldn't have done it
without him, none of it.

1789
02:08:50,840 --> 02:08:52,831
l want you
to take care of A.J.

1790
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:00,119
l wish l could be there
to walk you down the aisle.

1791
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:05,151
But l'll--

1792
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:10,791
l'll look in on you from
time to time, okay, honey?

1793
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:16,237
- l love you, Grace.
- l love you too.

1794
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:18,959
- l gotta go now, honey.
- Daddy, no.

1795
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:23,590
No, no, Dad, no!

1796
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:32,350
O.M.S. pod pre-start.
O2 vents locked, pressure loaded.

1797
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:36,716
What the hell's goin' on up there?
Why haven't you guys left yet?

1798
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:39,439
We're going, Harry.
Houston.

1799
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:41,994
- We got O.M.S. pod pre-start.
- Pod pre-start confirmed.

1800
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:48,757
- What's the problem?
- l don't know.
- What's wrong?
- Fix it now!

1801
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:51,871
No time, no time!

1802
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:53,837
- What?
- What's that?

1803
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:59,590
- Where you goin'?
- Oh, come on.
We're stayin', we're goin'.

1804
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:01,511
We're stayin', we're goin'.
Make up your minds.

1805
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:05,479
Damn it, Sharp! Get out of here now.
You got less than three minutes.

1806
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:12,428
- Come on, Watts. Come on, come on.
- Blow the bomb, Harry. We're with you.

1807
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:15,870
- Uh, it's stuck. Yes?
- Come on! Back off!
You don't know the components!

1808
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:20,715
Components, American components,
Russian components. All made in Taiwan!

1809
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:23,109
We're gettin' tight
for ignition, Freedom.

1810
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:28,270
- Houston, we've got no fire.
- What does that mean?

1811
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:31,915
- lt means we got a busted ship.
- A busted ship?
And l'm strapped in here?

1812
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:34,031
l had a great spot
picked out there.

1813
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:37,516
Freedom, you fire that engine.
lf there's not a way, you find
a way. The clock's tickin'.

1814
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:39,909
Let's go! Let's fire
that engine, Freedom!

1815
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:44,830
You got less than a minute.
Don't think l won't blow this thing.

1816
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:47,434
Sharp, get out of here.
lt's gettin' bad down here.

1817
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:49,511
l know how to fix it.
Please, move.

1818
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:51,756
l-l have to take you away
if you don't move.

1819
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:54,633
Watts, you gotta get that shuttle
started. You gotta fire it up now!

1820
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:56,836
Damn it, Sharp.
Get off this rock!

1821
02:10:56,920 --> 02:11:00,230
l'm telling you, please, move!
This is how we fix problem...

1822
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:03,397
in the Russian space station.

1823
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:06,916
Because l don't want
to stay here any more.

1824
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:12,434
Yeah! Finally!
We can go home!

1825
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:14,790
- She's coming back. She's coming back.
- We're hot!

1826
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:17,599
Watts, let's go, let's go!

1827
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:20,757
Rain all you want,
you son of a bitch.

1828
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:23,872
Let's go! We don't have time!
Hurry, hurry. We got no time!

1829
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:27,589
lnitiate thrusters on my mark!
Two, one-- Mark!

1830
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:38,916
- Come on. Get some altitude.
Let's go, let's go.
- Yes, come on!

1831
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:42,436
Freedom has max thrust!

1832
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:51,394
Thank you, Harry.

1833
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,991
Shuttle's out of range.
Still no detonation.

1834
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:10,352
Something's not right.
Too much time has gone by.

1835
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:14,150
Zero barrier's about to be breached.
One minute.

1836
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:16,708
Harry, come on.
Press that button.

1837
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:20,833
- We're goin' back and do it ourselves.
- Just don't. Wait one minute.

1838
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:27,799
- Dan, we're about
to cross the threshold.
- Come on, Harry. Press the button.

1839
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:32,550
Colonel, l'm askin' you.
Just one more minute!

1840
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:41,199
Press the button, Stamper.

1841
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:46,194
Come on.

1842
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:49,830
Harry'll do it. l know it.

1843
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:54,040
He doesn't know how to fail.

1844
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:01,472
We win, Gracie!

1845
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:05,150
Press it!

1846
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:38,951
We have detonation.
Confirming detonation.

1847
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:58,149
The two halves are gonna miss us
by 400 miles...

1848
02:13:58,240 --> 02:14:01,516
and most of the small particles
have been vaporized.

1849
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:14,198
- Houston, we're comin' home.
- We copy that, Freedom.

1850
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:17,869
Yo, Harry. You the man.

1851
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:12,390
Kennedy, we see you.
And you never looked so good.

1852
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:17,878
l never told anybody
this before, but l hate flyin',
so it'd be an awful shame to die now.

1853
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:22,039
That's easy for you to say. l owe
100 grand to a bad-ass loan shark...

1854
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:24,674
which l spent on a stripper
named Molly Mounds.

1855
02:15:24,760 --> 02:15:27,752
- Boy, that's bad.
- Kennedy, we are 100%.

1856
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:30,308
Flap suspension control on full.

1857
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:44,749
Welcome home, astronauts.

1858
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:54,436
Hey, guys, remember:
We're-- We're heroes now.

1859
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:56,829
So that incident with me
and the gun on the asteroid--

1860
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:59,275
Let's keep that under wraps,
all right?

1861
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:02,757
Miss Stamper?

1862
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:07,390
Colonel Willie Sharp,
United States Air Force, ma'am.

1863
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:10,199
Requesting permission to shake
the hand of the daughter...

1864
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:12,231
of the bravest man
l've ever met.

1865
02:17:18,560 --> 02:17:20,391
Hello.

1866
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:22,954
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, you're my hero.

1867
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:26,595
Oh, baby, l wanna have babies
with you.

1868
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:30,271
Welcome back, cowboy.

1869
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:36,199
Uh, Harry wanted you
to have this.

1870
02:17:42,480 --> 02:17:44,357
He did, huh?

1871
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:03,315
l could stay awake

1872
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:08,434
Just to hear you breathin'

1873
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:12,155
Watch you smile while you are sleepin'

1874
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:16,558
While you're far away and dreamin'

1875
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:20,519
l just wanna stay with you

1876
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:23,194
ln this moment forever

1877
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:26,039
Forever and ever

1878
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:29,675
l don't wanna close my eyes

1879
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:32,234
l don't wanna fall asleep

1880
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:34,271
'Cause l'd miss you, baby

1881
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:37,352
And l don't wanna miss a thing

1882
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:41,228
'Cause even when l dream of you

1883
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:43,920
The sweetest dream would never do

1884
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,831
l'd still miss you, baby

1885
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:48,639
And l don't wanna miss a thing

1886
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:52,673
And l don't wanna miss one smile

1887
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:56,594
And l don't wanna miss one kiss

1888
02:18:56,720 --> 02:18:59,917
Well, l just wanna be
with you right here

1889
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,913
With you just like this

1890

Well, l just wanna hold you close

1891
02:19:08,120 --> 02:19:12,159
Feel your heart so close to mine

1892
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:15,636
And just stay here in this moment

1893
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:20,197
For all the rest of time

1894
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:22,396
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1895
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:25,318
Yeah

1896
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:28,870
Don't wanna close my eyes

1897
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:31,269
l don't wanna fall asleep

1898
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:33,356
'Cause l'd miss you, baby

1899
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:36,398
And l don't wanna miss a thing

1900
02:19:36,480 --> 02:19:40,155
'Cause even when l dream of you

1901
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:42,669
The sweetest dream would never do

Yeah, l don't wanna miss a thing

1907
02:22:56,480 --> 02:23:01,156
All my bags are packed

1908
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:04,915

l hate to wake you up to say goodbye

1910

But the dawn is breakin'
lt's early morn

1911
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:19,435
The taxi's waitin'
He's blowin' his horn

1912
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:22,717
Already l'm so lonesome

1913
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:24,796
l could die

1914
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:30,917
So kiss me and smile for me

1915
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:34,515
Tell me that you'll wait for me

1916
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:39,919
Hold me like you'll never let me go

1917
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:45,671
'Cause l'm leaving on a jet plane

1918
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:49,998
l don't know when l'll be back again

1919

Leaving on a jet plane

1922
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:07,675
Leaving on a jet plane

1923
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:11,509
Leaving on a jet plane

1924
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:14,837
Leaving on a jet plane
