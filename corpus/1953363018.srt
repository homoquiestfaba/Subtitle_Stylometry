1
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:23,397
<i>The last aircraft of the first batch</i>
<i>taking off to carry British paratroops.</i>

2
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,698
<i>Allied bombings composing</i>
<i>an estimated 1 million men...</i>

3
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,736
Sniper! Everyone take cover!

4
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,239
Get on the ground.

5
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,825
Stay low, guys.

6
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,869
Rizzo, get over there now!

7
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,289
- Now, now, now.
- Nate, cover him!

8
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,846
I don't see him. Where is he?

9
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,561
Somebody put some fire on this guy!

10
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,870
Nate, take cover!

11
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,582
Yes, sir.

12
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,593
Rizzo, fall back. Grab the guns.

13
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,651
Gentle on the trigger.

14
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,736
Don't pull...

15
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,655
...just squeeze.

16
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,654
- Come on, you guys, haul it, move it out.
- We're moving out in 0800.

17
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,034
Butler, you're up.

18
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,619
Move it out!

19
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,957
Lance. Lance, you're up.

20
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,294
- Were you scared?
- Of what?

21
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,547
- Oh, I don't know, a bullet to the head?
- Pack it up!

22
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,507
Didn't really think about it.

23
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,551
I was afraid I'd miss the shot.

24
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,136
What kind of shit is that?

25
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,390
You didn't really think about it.
Not for one second?

26
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,309
Nope.

27
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,186
Ignorance is bliss.

28
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,523
It was a hell of a shot.

29
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,735
First group, time to eat.

30
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,404
You think God's on our side?

31
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,198
- Hey, Rizzo?
- Yeah?

32
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,660
- Is God on our side?
- Is the Pope Catholic, sir?

33
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,412
Yes.

34
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,790
And as far as I know,
bears do shit in the woods.

35
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,087
Well, what if I'm not a believer?

36
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,173
Well, then you're fucked.

37
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,178
- Ain't that right, Johnny?
- Right as rain, sir.

38
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,436
Oh, jeez.

39
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,772
It's Lieutenant Conti.

40
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,784
Over here. Come on, let's get it up!

41
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,454
Haul that pack over here.

42
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,624
- Damn it.
- Sergeant Matheson.

43
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,835
How are my boys
from Second Infantry doing?

44
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,881
We secured section nine,
put down the last of the German 155.

45
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,133
Sitting down and giving the grunts...

46
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,803
- ...some down time.
- How'd the Krauts treat you?

47
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,514
- Have to use your knuckles?
- They never go easy.

48
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,723
It's a tough war.

49
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,893
- That's why we got you on the ground.
- Thank you, sir.

50
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,979
I got a cakewalk for you this time.
You ready for it?

51
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,815
Christmas hams.

52
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,484
I need you to deliver them
to the forward OP.

53
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,112
Getting killed on a non-combat mission
is bad.

54
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,531
You're a good soldier,
but this war's over.

55
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,575
I mean, look around.
We took this country weeks ago.

56
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,578
I've put you and your men
on some shitty assignments.

57
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,290
This one is a cheeseburger
with a cherry cola and a side of fries.

58
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,169
I lost a man to sniper fire
just this morning. They're out there.

59
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,921
Yeah, know what's out there?

60
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:07,175
Fourteen-year-old boys
with broken rifles. No ammo, no food.

61
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,136
You sure about that?

62
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,180
Dump half the food here,
other half to the forward OP.

63
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,850
- Do it with a smile on your face.
- Yes, sir.

64
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,146
- Oh, and by the way...
- Move it, move it!

65
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,022
...Army beat Navy 23-7.

66
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:25,026
I always said those midshipmen
were a little soft in the middle.

67
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,988
- Get to work.
- You gotta move it now!

68
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,829
Chambliss. You like Christmas hams?

69
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,039
You betcha, sarge.

70
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:42,377
I take mine with potatoes,
cabbage and a shot of Irish whisky.

71
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,881
Today's your lucky day. Walk with me.

72
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:54,556
We gotta escort a bunch of overcooked
pigs all the way to forward OP.

73
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,558
Can I bring some friends?

74
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,977
It's all hands on deck.

75
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,856
Okay, we're moving out.

76
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,649
Get your gear, let's go.

77
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,908
- Hustle up!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

78
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,913
- That's Ransom.
- Who?

79
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,915
Lieutenant Ransom.

80
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,085
- Coat says he's a cook.
- Yeah, exactly.

81
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,963
That guy commanded
a whole company on D-day.

82
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:31,092
He took his unit through
Omaha Beach and survived.

83
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:36,473
Supposed to have a cake assignment
after that, but on his next mission out...

84
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:41,019
...he lost almost every man
under his watch in half an hour.

85
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,687
It was 15 minutes, actually.

86
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,610
So they took my rank,
busted me down to a cook.

87
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,779
Are you a good cook?

88
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,281
I'm a very good cook.

89
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,617
- Nate Burrows.
- Hey.

90
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,120
- This loudmouth is Duncan Chambliss.
- We got mouths to feed.

91
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:03,208
Chambliss, you're on the truck.
Rizzo, Burrows, Ransom, Miller...

92
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,126
...you're in this truck.

93
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,963
Burrows, give me a minute.

94
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,465
Help me with these sandbags.

95
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,926
- Sir?
- Heard you took out a sniper today.

96
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,387
Dumb luck, I guess.

97
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,557
- Was it?
- Shot at some toy ducks at the state fair.

98
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,017
From over a hundred yards
in a dense forest?

99
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,854
I don't know much about yards.
I'm used to measuring in acres.

100
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,650
Must have won a lot of pink teddy bears
for your girl back home.

101
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,653
- I don't have a girl.
- Everybody's got a girl.

102
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,030
Girls, sir. Plural.

103
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:38,493
- Two of them waiting for me back home.
- Regular Casanova.

104
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,998
- Don't know which flower to pick, huh?
- Something like that.

105
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,959
You got some moxie, don't you?

106
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,962
Can't say, sir.
Don't exactly know what moxie is.

107
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,507
Balls.

108
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,428
- Last time I checked, I have two of them.
- Are they big?

109
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,014
Big enough.

110
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,310
You're my new sniper. Load up.

111
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,601
What you got there?

112
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,898
- Nothing.
- Really? Looks like something.

113
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,653
- You been back to Division CP?
- I came from there.

114
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,907
- They're saying the war's practically over.
- Is that what they're saying?

115
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,826
- That's what I heard.
- You're a replacement, huh?

116
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,497
- I've been here for three weeks.
- Three weeks and already a sniper.

117
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:10,752
Put some gold bars on that shoulder.
Three fucking weeks. Shit.

118
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,380
Yeah, well, how long you been a cook?

119
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,424
- Three fucking weeks.
- Tastes like it too.

120
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,210
- Get off the truck.
- Move out.

121
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,296
- Come on, move, move, move!
- Down, down, find cover!

122
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,090
Get down over there!

123
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,592
- Come on, come on, move!
- Take cover.

124
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,636
Hit that snowbank. Go, go, go!

125
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,806
- Move, move!
- Incoming fire.

126
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,434
Medic!

127
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,820
Go, go, go!

128
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,490
- Rizzo!
- Put some fire on it.

129
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,659
Waiting for my shot, sir.

130
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,848
- Like ducks at the arcade.
- Now, move it. Let's get out of here.

131
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,852
Move, move, move.

132
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,703
Gather weapons and ammo.

133
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,756
Duncan?

134
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,134
Come on, Duncan.

135
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,053
Help!

136
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,973
- Hey. Hey.
- Duncan. Duncan, stay with me!

137
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,892
- Come on, let's go.
- Grab an arm.

138
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,562
- He's gone. He's gone.
- He's not gone. Grab an arm.

139
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,900
Let's get the hell out of here!
We have to go after that mortar team.

140
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,028
Come on.

141
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,906
Come on, come on.
Move, move, move.

142
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,378
- Come on, guys!
- Medic.

143
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,713
- It's too late. He's gone.
- He's not gone!

144
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,342
- Yes, he is.
- Come on! We have work to do.

145
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,129
- You got a shot?
- Too many trees.

146
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,590
Ransom, follow me.

147
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,975
Messerschmitts.

148
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,353
Hold your formation. Stay covered.

149
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:46,694
Okay, we gotta head south, get back
to HQ. Burrows, you're on point.

150
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,783
Osbourne, Davis, Wells, move across
the clearing, cover the left flank.

151
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,535
We'll take the right
and we'll meet at the bottom.

152
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,204
Stay low, eyes peeled.

153
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,414
- Move out.
- You heard him. Stay low.

154
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,041
Yes, sir.

155
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,168
Keep your eye on that ridge.

156
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,212
Formation, guys.

157
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,006
Be smart. Be smart.

158
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,178
Smith, behind me.

159
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,905
Come on, let's go. Hurry up.

160
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,459
- Take cover!
- Go, go, go!

161
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,753
- Move, move, move!
- Get down! Get down!

162
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,089
Move it! Get down!

163
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,437
Hold your fire.

164
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,993
We got our noses in the shit now!

165
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,870
No shit!

166
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,338
That road leads to Battalion HQ!

167
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,673
Let that thing go,
they get steamrolled.

168
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,759
Hey, what about the stovepipe?

169
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,264
- Burrows!
- Burrows!

170
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,519
- What you got, sir?
- Launcher!

171
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,188
- Osbourne's got it.
- Osbourne's dead.

172
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,359
I got it.

173
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,319
Cover me.

174
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,459
Shit.

175
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,820
Hey, cover me.

176
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,572
Covering fire!

177
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,162
Shit.

178
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,915
Can you hit the ammo compartment
on the left side, above the tracks?

179
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,125
- I can.
- You can?

180
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,043
- Yeah.
- Get on my ass. Let's go.

181
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,253
Let's go.

182
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,931
Set.

183
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,272
You got a lucky horseshoe
up your ass, kid. You do.

184
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,030
Jesus, that's a column of tanks.

185
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,991
That's too much firepower.
Move out now.

186
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,952
Go, go, go!

187
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,628
Get in these foxholes!

188
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,136
- Come on.
- Incoming!

189
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,473
Get down, get down, get down!
Get in here!

190
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,600
So much for a simple food run.

191
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,937
We gotta get out of here,
get back to camp.

192
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,647
Let's go.

193
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,353
Got anything, Burrows?

194
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,272
Nothing but static, sir.

195
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,857
- Lewis, maps.
- Yes, sir.

196
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,026
I need some help over here.

197
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,198
What the hell is a column of tanks
doing out here?

198
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,536
I don't know, but we gotta get out from
behind enemy lines, back to CP, pronto.

199
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,580
We're just west of the string of hills.

200
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,500
We engaged those tanks
in that clearing right there.

201
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,212
That road runs east to west,
means we were going south.

202
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,880
Southeast.

203
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,301
That puts us behind
the entire German Seventh Army.

204
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,897
What the hell was that?

205
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,693
Let's go to the sound of thunder.
Germans ain't fighting themselves.

206
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,445
Join up with another outfit.

207
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,864
Have a German mechanised column
overrun us?

208
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,701
- Yeah, let's get out of here.
- Burrows, lead the way.

209
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,490
If I am to believe these readings...

210
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,159
...this was a failure.

211
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,708
All this work and promise
has led to this...

212
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,422
The blast should be
several square miles.

213
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,387
Sorry, Herr Kommandant.

214
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,722
It appears the trigger malfunctioned.

215
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,308
The trigger malfunctioned?

216
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,827
"Sorry" is a weak word.

217
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,373
There is no room for weakness.

218
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,543
The Führer expects success.

219
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,130
The question is,
can you fix the trigger?

220
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,349
Then fix it.

221
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,602
Let's end this war.

222
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:11,258
- Looks like it was firebombed.
- Air Corp's grounded because of the fog.

223
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,762
- Well, mortar fire didn't do this.
- Then what the hell did?

224
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,023
Burrows, over here.

225
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,373
What's your unit?

226
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,375
OSS.

227
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,169
What happened here?

228
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,797
Take this to the train.

229
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,134
Train? What train?

230
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:21,180
Stuttgart. Tonight.

231
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:26,226
You have to be there. That's an order.

232
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,776
If you fail, what happened here
will happen again.

233
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:40,157
To us, New York, Washington.

234
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,660
You have to carry out this mission.

235
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,329
Your country is counting on you.

236
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,915
Kestrel.

237
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,084
Find...

238
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,087
Find... Find...

239
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,974
- Blitzkrieg on American soil?
- That's what it sounds like.

240
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,269
This was a test site for a new weapon.

241
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:13,774
- Orders were to observe but not interfere.
- To make sure the weapon worked.

242
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,569
Supposed to deliver papers
to a contact on a train to Stuttgart.

243
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,572
- Kestrel.
- It doesn't say.

244
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,992
- We have to get to that rendezvous.
- What?

245
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,869
No, we don't.

246
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,289
We need to get these back to
Intelligence, let them manage it.

247
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,209
We're not the right men for this job.

248
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,045
We're the only men that are here.

249
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,463
And that'll have to do.

250
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,884
Map shows a train depot a few miles
from here, with a route to Stuttgart.

251
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,262
- What if I said no?
- Not an option.

252
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,888
We gotta get to that train.

253
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,308
- It's a suicide mission.
- Don't worry, I'll mark your grave.

254
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:51,145
Yeah? Well, I'll piss on yours.
You got a deal.

255
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,230
Yeah, sticks and stones.

256
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,003
Ransom.

257
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,172
What do you think of him?

258
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:24,344
Lieutenant Ransom is career military.

259
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,891
So was his father and his father's father.

260
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,977
A lot of soldiers
never really respect their COs.

261
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,981
His men were glad they had him.

262
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:42,237
You gotta be under fire with somebody,
he's the guy you want in your foxhole.

263
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,782
So, what happened to him?

264
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,660
It's not my story to tell.

265
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,546
Ransom?

266
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,217
He was behind us.
See where he went?

267
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:07,179
- Nope.
- Find him, Burrows. Make it fast.

268
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,139
Ransom.

269
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,988
Cover.

270
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,545
Take your positions...

271
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,256
...we must secure this road.

272
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,442
Let's get the hell out of here. Let's go!

273
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,195
Over there!

274
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,658
- You're not a German.
- Neither are you.

275
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,702
Soviet?

276
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,624
I thought you were soldiers
from the village. Nazis.

277
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,253
- No, no, no. He's not a German.
- Move out. All of you.

278
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,339
That way will lead back to them.
Where are you headed?

279
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,925
- Train depot.
- It's this way. Come!

280
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,815
This is it.

281
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,114
- Okay, who are you?
- Pozarsky, lvan lvanovich.

282
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,116
I'm a sergeant in the Red Army.

283
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,453
You wanna tag along,
you gotta follow my orders. You got it?

284
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,163
Of course.

285
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,209
- Go.
- Stay low, hug the walls.

286
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,271
We need to find train number seven.

287
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,774
That's the train to Stuttgart
and Haigerloch.

288
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,983
What do you know?

289
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:34,362
I was imprisoned at the labour camps
there, before they brought me here.

290
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,364
It's two tracks over.

291
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,867
Quiet.

292
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,890
They must be here someplace.

293
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,102
Let's spread out and find them.

294
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,845
Search the train cars!

295
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,888
Do it now!

296
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,434
We found one! We found one!

297
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,777
OSS.

298
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,241
- He's our contact.
- And we led the Krauts right to him.

299
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,951
Way to go.

300
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,665
Is there others like you?

301
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,715
Where are they?

302
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,636
What's your mission?

303
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,225
Wanna play, huh?

304
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,773
Again. What's your mission?

305
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,652
Look...

306
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,739
...my orders are to kill you.

307
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:27,077
I don't like these orders
but my oath requires allegiance...

308
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:34,042
...so give me what I want
and I can spare your life as an exception.

309
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,753
What do you think?

310
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,181
Pity.

311
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,069
An order is an order.

312
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:10,453
Sergeant, if that was our contact, he was
supposed to get on that train to Stuttgart...

313
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,081
...which means
we have to get on that train.

314
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,801
Damn it.

315
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,810
Move, move, move. Get to that train.

316
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,779
This is it, train number seven.

317
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,906
- It's locked.
- Where's Matheson?

318
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,492
- I don't know.
- I'm going back for him.

319
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,110
Matheson. Let's go!

320
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,171
We've got to go!

321
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,560
It's now or never, fellas.

322
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,396
- You're in command.
- Sergeant?

323
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:45,191
You're the only man I trust.
Make sure they do the right thing.

324
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,694
- I can't, sir.
- You can and you will. Now go.

325
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,988
- Get on the train.
- I'm not leaving you.

326
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,197
Yes, you are.

327
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,538
I'll find my way home.

328
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,207
You do the same. Go, guys.

329
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,716
Do it!

330
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,509
Let's go!

331
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,892
Get on the train.

332
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,811
The hunt continues in Stuttgart.

333
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,940
We will be ready for them.

334
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,868
Did you hear that?

335
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,544
- You're good?
- Yeah.

336
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:32,382
Never thought I'd see the day when
Yanks fell out of the sky to save my ass.

337
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,758
- Willoughby.
- Hi.

338
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,051
British Air Force.

339
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,055
- Hey.
- So, what are we doing?

340
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,100
What do you mean?

341
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:46,980
We're gonna get out of here, kick Nazi ass
and have a few beers in England on me.

342
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,774
That's great. That's great. Okay.

343
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:53,987
Look, Matheson left you in charge.
Okay, young man?

344
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,864
Telling me this fella's
in charge of this operation?

345
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:01,661
- I've got underwear older than him.
- That's great, but could you back off?

346
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:06,374
Please.

347
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:15,049
Now, look, we're pissing distance
from the French border.

348
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,218
We gotta give these prisoners
a chance.

349
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,513
Free these prisoners,
this train won't make it to Stuttgart.

350
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,517
Are you fellas serious?
I mean, what are you doing here?

351
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:28,187
I know you're chinstrapped, kid,
but you got to pull it together.

352
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:31,816
We're the boots on the ground.
Okay, we lose good men every day...

353
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:35,862
...but we just keep marching
until they tell us to stop.

354
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:40,199
Now, you make a decision right now
and you stick to it.

355
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,409
What are we doing?

356
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,328
<i>Sergeant!</i>

357
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:46,164
You're the only man I trust
to get the job done.

358
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,374
Make sure they do the right thing.

359
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,793
<i>I'll find my way home.</i>

360
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,712
I'm sorry, no.

361
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,632
You telling me you're not here
to get us out of here?

362
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,762
Our mission's in Stuttgart,
and that's where we're going.

363
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,515
Okay. You heard him.

364
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,899
I should have known. Fucking Yanks.

365
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,745
How many dead?

366
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,749
There were 50 of us
from the factory in Stuttgart.

367
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,293
As far as I know,
I'm the only one to escape.

368
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,672
And now I'm headed
back to that shithole.

369
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,967
As far as Hitler's concerned,
there are no laws in war.

370
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,262
During times of war, laws fall silent.

371
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:48,226
The old Polack trying
to recite Shakespeare to a Brit.

372
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,103
You believe this?

373
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,606
- It's Cicero.
- Yeah, but Shakespeare said it first.

374
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,858
- Yeah, and better.
- Thank you.

375
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,610
He didn't say it at all.

376
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,114
Hey, what were they making
at that factory?

377
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,701
Bombs. Big bombs.
I don't know what kind.

378
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:08,788
The kind that burned up that village.
The kind they wanna use on Manhattan.

379
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,834
The bomb in the village was massive.

380
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,628
Took every man we had
to drag it to the test site.

381
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:20,341
I escaped the explosion
and I heard it was failure.

382
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:25,513
If that was a failure,
I'd hate to see what success looks like.

383
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,225
The plan is simple.
We ride the train into Stuttgart.

384
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,478
We meet up with somebody
called Kestrel at the opera house.

385
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,981
Give him the message,
retrieve our objective.

386
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,609
- The schematics for the bomb.
- We get it by any means necessary.

387
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:43,114
- Destroying the factory on the way out.
- You know, simple concerns me.

388
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,699
Why?

389
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,286
Yeah, grab a seat.

390
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,165
- The way I see it, there's a big problem.
- What's that?

391
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,584
How you gonna get out?

392
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:58,171
You're gonna be in a Nazi town
with 70 million Krauts around you.

393
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,547
Well, that part's easy.

394
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:04,177
The OSS will have a truck waiting,
an escape route plan to get us to safety.

395
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,596
All right.

396
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,682
Okay.

397
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,101
Just Soviet prisoners
are at that factory?

398
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:16,439
No. American, British, Canadian...

399
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,192
...like guinea pigs in a lab.

400
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,612
Sounds like you boys
need another set of hands.

401
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,615
You wanna throw in on this?

402
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,244
Screw it. I've got nothing else to do.

403
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,705
Let's go and start a fight, boys.

404
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,566
When are you gonna be finished
with it?

405
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,693
When I'm dead, I guess.

406
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,585
Hey.

407
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,342
Fifty-six.

408
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:36,269
Fifty-six mothers without their sons.

409
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:43,192
That's how many boys I have lost
under my command.

410
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,946
How many have you saved?

411
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,117
Can't really know that, now, can you?

412
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,129
A night just like this.

413
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:08,092
The day before,
I buried three good men...

414
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,679
...securing a bridge at Saint-Lô.

415
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,265
The company regrouped.

416
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,809
I was ordered to overrun
a machine gun nest...

417
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:22,148
...but got pinned down trying
by an entrenched enemy.

418
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,444
I ordered an artillery strike...

419
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:32,575
...just as a platoon of Army Rangers
was flanking our objective.

420
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,414
Direct hit.

421
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,919
The whole platoon...

422
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,756
...taken out.

423
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,010
Tough going.

424
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,936
You know, they say a bullet never lies.

425
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:03,648
If that's true,
why hasn't one found me yet?

426
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,655
You must have a lucky horseshoe
stuck up your ass.

427
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,210
Get some shut-eye, okay, kid?

428
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,754
They're gonna be waiting for us.

429
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,513
What's happening?

430
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,015
The train stopped.

431
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,516
We're in Stuttgart.

432
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,185
- How can you tell?
- Trust me.

433
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,771
There's no mistaking the stench.

434
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,149
Nate. Up.

435
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,944
Okay, on three. One, two, three, up.

436
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,565
German soldiers going car to car
killing everyone.

437
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,777
- I need a gun.
- What about me?

438
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,571
I want it back.

439
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,449
Form a line, weapons check.

440
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,910
When the door opens, fire at will.

441
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,454
Get down. Get down.

442
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,668
- What? What?
- Don't miss, kid.

443
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:58,132
Get down. Take cover!

444
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,510
Cover and fire!

445
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,931
Put your grenades in here.

446
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,646
Go!

447
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,607
Fall back!

448
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,656
Move out. Go!

449
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,926
- We need to get to the opera house.
- The opera house is in the centre of town.

450
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,553
We can't walk there like this,
carrying rifles.

451
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,306
He's right.
We need to get rid of these uniforms.

452
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,851
We need to get past that squad
without starting World War III.

453
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,812
Give me your blade.

454
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:39,108
I'm not in uniform. I fit in the best.

455
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,193
- Yeah.
- I take them out.

456
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,695
Still got my sidearm?

457
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,910
Searchlight.

458
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,219
You have cigarette? I need.

459
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,391
What are you gonna do,
smoke them to death or stab them?

460
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,184
Both.

461
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:18,772
There's four armed men out there.
Not two, four.

462
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,066
The odds are about even.

463
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,943
See you.

464
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:28,449
- He's got some balls, this Polack.
- A small brain but big balls.

465
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,024
I'm sorry I'm late.

466
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,205
Got a light?

467
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:13,971
Hey, kid. Do you really got two girls
waiting for you back home? Really?

468
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,975
How do you manage two?
I got enough problems with one wife.

469
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,726
Yeah, sometimes it's not easy.

470
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,228
Yeah, I bet.

471
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,230
Valentine's Day.

472
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:27,526
- Hard to manage, huh?
- Valentine's Day is overrated, son.

473
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,279
By the time you send them
red roses, chocolates...

474
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:34,366
...took them out for a candlelight dinner,
take a man's weeks' pay.

475
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:40,247
And as for that little fellow
with the bow and arrow, Cupid...

476
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,250
...I heard he bats both ways.

477
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,587
Like the Polack.

478
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,966
Hey.

479
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,801
What happened to your leg?

480
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,553
It's nothing.

481
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,890
- That don't look like nothing.
- When'd you get it?

482
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,934
Mortar fire, when Chambliss got hit.

483
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,145
Hey, the Polack's back.

484
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,150
It wasn't even fair fight.

485
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,943
But I found us uniforms.

486
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:26,376
- Armed?
- Sidearms, holstered, rifles down.

487
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:27,586
Drunk on beer.

488
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:30,088
I'll go first.

489
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,548
Pub fights are my forte.

490
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:34,426
- You be my guest.
- I'll take the three on the right.

491
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,929
- Covering the left.
- No. Sit this one out.

492
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:40,474
- It's gonna be close work. We got this.
- I won't need it.

493
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,100
Ready?

494
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,841
Hey! Get out of here.
Come on. Move. Move!

495
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,557
I guess you didn't need it.

496
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,600
Nope.

497
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,144
Watch and learn, son.

498
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,605
You might just make Valentine's Day.

499
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,150
You look hungry.

500
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,612
Please sit.

501
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,198
- I feed you.
- Pozarsky, get in here.

502
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,449
Get the uniforms.

503
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,535
Make some fish and chips.

504
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:47,249
So, what's your wife like?

505
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,084
All right.

506
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,545
My high-school sweetheart.

507
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,755
Pretty when she wants to be.

508
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,508
Got one of them big, toothy smiles.

509
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,010
Gives me hope, you know?

510
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:03,015
Kind of thick through the middle since we
had a little girl, but I'm no prize bull, huh?

511
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,225
And she puts up with me.

512
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,854
That makes her the bravest woman
in the world.

513
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,689
Or the craziest.

514
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,317
Maybe a little of both.

515
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,943
Yeah.

516
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,030
So tell me about your old man.

517
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,324
What's he like?

518
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,745
That's his Purple Heart you carry around
in your pocket, isn't it?

519
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:29,583
Saint-Mihiel, France,
September 16th of 1918.

520
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,336
He died covering a front
of Pont-à-Mousson.

521
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,756
Is that why you push so hard?

522
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,299
Is it?

523
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,259
I never knew him.

524
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,724
Well, when we're done here...

525
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,144
...you should pay him a visit.

526
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,571
I've never been to the opera before.

527
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,491
No? It's wunderbar.

528
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,497
Hey, be careful.

529
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,870
Your ticket, please.

530
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,769
Thank you for my coat.

531
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,520
I've been expecting you.

532
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:58,106
Kestrel?

533
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,985
Follow me.

534
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:12,078
We have a message.

535
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,955
It's encoded.

536
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,082
Not here.

537
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,252
"We"?

538
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:23,840
I only agreed to get one person
into the laboratory.

539
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,550
There are four of us.

540
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:28,553
We're not OSS, we're infantry.

541
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:34,017
Do you understand that they
will do far worse than kill me...

542
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,686
...for even talking with you?

543
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,688
We won't let that happen.

544
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,904
We'll be safe here for the night.

545
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:49,491
Blueprints for the train factory
are on the desk.

546
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:53,161
I've marked all the information
that should serve your purposes.

547
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,081
Okay.

548
01:03:56,374 --> 01:04:00,126
So how'd you pull this together?

549
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,504
The local resistance.

550
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,050
Not all Germans support Hitler's Reich.

551
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,929
Most of us know we've already lost.

552
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:14,891
Every day we keep fighting,
it's just more lives senselessly lost.

553
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,977
More to rebuild.

554
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,438
Dr. Gruenewald will have
his materials ready.

555
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:23,400
- Wait a minute. Who's this Gruenewald?
- Your mission.

556
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:27,779
My agreement with the Americans
was for his extraction and mine.

557
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:30,699
But the bomb, that was our mission.

558
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,076
Gruenewald is the atomic bomb.

559
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:36,955
- The atomic bomb?
- Yes.

560
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:40,000
The first prototype was a failure...

561
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:43,753
...but Dr. Gruenewald corrected
his trigger design this morning.

562
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:48,300
The Waffen-SS will take possession
of the second bomb tomorrow for the test.

563
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:52,512
If it works,
they will have no further need of him.

564
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,763
So they'll kill him?

565
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,850
Yes.

566
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,477
He's been a prisoner at the factory
for months.

567
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,689
His research is the only thing
that's kept him alive.

568
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,858
What about the other prisoners?

569
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,818
We'll only have one truck waiting.

570
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:10,947
Once you get him past the guards,
we won't have room for anybody else.

571
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:14,826
Don't worry, kid.
I'll take care of the prisoners.

572
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,672
How did you end up in this war?

573
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:32,385
Something I had to do.

574
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,721
Hard way to make a living.

575
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:41,061
Yeah, I could've chose
Armoured or Airborne...

576
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:43,813
...but I grew up in the country.

577
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:47,525
I guess that makes me
a boots-on-the-ground kind of guy.

578
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,326
You said you have a message for me.

579
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:10,340
Well, what does it say?

580
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:13,093
I don't carry my cipher
in my first-aid kit.

581
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,516
Who is he to you, Gruenewald?

582
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,228
I'm his assistant.

583
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:26,856
- You're taking a huge risk for him.
- So are you.

584
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,943
It's the right thing to do.

585
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,321
Yes, it is.

586
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:39,828
There, almost new.

587
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,247
Thank you.

588
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:02,434
This house is disgusting.

589
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,936
It's nicer than any house
I've ever lived in.

590
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:07,939
It reeks of excess.

591
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,525
Oh, you're a communist, I forgot.

592
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:24,205
How many Germans starve
while others live like this?

593
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:27,584
You don't seem to be minding
the excess now, you big Polack.

594
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,714
This is special occasion for me.

595
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:38,053
- How would you like to join me in cigar?
- I wouldn't.

596
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:40,388
Suit yourself.

597
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:45,852
I trust we have plans
for getting inside this train factory.

598
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,271
We do. Young Kestrel came through.

599
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:49,773
It's all right here.

600
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,238
Good.

601
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:03,865
Where are you going?

602
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,660
This is not a fight you want, Nate.

603
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:10,121
Go back to sleep.

604
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,749
I'm a terrible sleeper.

605
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:16,419
Always something to worry about.
Someone to worry about.

606
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:20,381
Not another step.

607
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,469
I will kill you.

608
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,305
What are you?

609
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:32,227
When this is all over...

610
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:35,772
...would you hand Gruenewald
over to the Soviet Union?

611
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:41,444
We were a poor people once...

612
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:43,947
...but never again.

613
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:49,911
This bomb is power...

614
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,746
...and prosperity.

615
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,082
It will make the world listen.

616
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,959
It'll make the world hate.

617
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:02,799
You think we can always
do the right thing.

618
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:08,096
That morals need never
be compromised.

619
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:12,058
That is the thinking of a child.

620
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,644
You were working us the whole time.

621
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,521
We were just another job to you.

622
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,190
Not another step.

623
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,445
We're not so different.

624
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:30,451
I, like you, am doing this
for my country.

625
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,268
I just decoded the message.

626
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:59,897
The bomb is scheduled for a test drop
today before the Allies bomb the factory.

627
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:04,569
We cannot let this happen. We need
to disable it and extract Dr. Gruenewald.

628
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:07,155
- The blueprints are gone.
- Pozarsky took them.

629
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,781
What?

630
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:11,951
- Oh, he's after Gruenewald.
- We have to get to him first.

631
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:24,422
American and English bomber wings
are already on their way.

632
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,842
We can't catch a break, huh?

633
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,510
Come on.

634
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:44,544
Where's Gruenewald's lab?

635
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:47,505
Past the prisoners,
final door we come to.

636
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:50,383
I'll free the prisoners.

637
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:02,687
Good luck.

638
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:34,177
Dr. Gruenewald, our visitors.

639
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:35,761
Yes, yes, this way.

640
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:43,186
The Americans call it the calutron,
but it's...

641
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:45,771
It's a particle accelerator.

642
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:51,444
Separates out uranium 235 and 238,
good uranium from bad uranium.

643
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:52,695
It's very expensive.

644
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:54,947
Follow me.

645
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,669
Stinking Nazis.

646
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:00,555
- What about the bomb?
- What about it?

647
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,474
What if it's in the factory
when the B-17s get here?

648
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:06,018
No way to predict.

649
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:08,854
Where is it?

650
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:10,982
Right next door.

651
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:12,817
- Can you disable it?
- Yes.

652
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,528
It's gone.

653
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:19,073
They've already taken it.

654
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,784
I'm sure they're loading it for transport.

655
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:30,876
Let's go!

656
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:34,839
Come on, let's go. Move it!

657
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,591
Let's get out of here.

658
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,522
Doc, doc, doc, come on.

659
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:14,754
Five o'clock, cover.

660
01:17:14,963 --> 01:18:02,343
Move!

661
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:35,126
Last chance, Nate.
Tell me about them two girls back home.

662
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:40,381
I got a mother and an older sister
waiting for me.

663
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:45,302
- That's it?
- That's it.

664
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:47,763
You played that one out.
You had me going.

665
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:03,612
I'm all out, kid.

666
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:12,621
Come on!

667
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:15,791
Put your weapon down!

668
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:18,627
Do it now.

669
01:19:22,215 --> 01:19:26,802
Hey, kid. I'm sorry I couldn't
get you back home to them.

670
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:28,554
I really am.

671
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,015
Hold your fire.

672
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:36,270
I've been expecting you.

673
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,024
Put your weapons down.

674
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:09,303
Line them up here.

675
01:20:23,276 --> 01:20:29,198
You came here to steal from the Führer
and the people of Germany.

676
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:34,829
Not just our weapons,
but our finest mind.

677
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:43,587
- Now, who do you think you are?
- We're nobodies.

678
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,720
You're right.

679
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,098
I know. I'm an American.

680
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,812
And I'm not a fool.

681
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:03,190
The war was lost
when you took Cherbourg.

682
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:08,904
Now what's left is making you pay
for every village...

683
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:14,869
...every bridge,
every inch you advance.

684
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:18,914
And we need assets
to negotiate our future.

685
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:24,378
Herr Gruenewald.

686
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:33,679
What you've done is unacceptable.

687
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:38,517
I need to punish you for your betrayal.

688
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:45,190
And I can think
of so many inventive ways.

689
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:50,863
But the fact is, the Reich
still requires your services.

690
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:16,889
It does not, however,
need your daughter.

691
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:21,435
No. Please.

692
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,228
Please.

693
01:22:31,696 --> 01:22:33,364
No!

694
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,555
No, damn you.

695
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,620
Drop it.

696
01:23:22,622 --> 01:23:24,540
- I saved you.
- Drop it.

697
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,754
Take Gruenewald.

698
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:33,173
I take his papers.

699
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:34,883
We all walk away.

700
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:44,351
Gotta go! Scout planes,
bombers are on their way!

701
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:47,312
Go. Let's go.

702
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,023
Move out. Let's go, go, go!

703
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:51,775
- So long, Polack.
- Hey!

704
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:54,653
Willoughby, let's go!

705
01:23:55,697 --> 01:24:00,117
Command, this is Bravo-One-Seven.
Time to target, two minutes. Over.

706
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:03,662
<i>Copy, Bravo-One-Seven.</i>
<i>Prepare for bombing raid.</i>

707
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:06,498
Roger, Command.
Course heading, 147 degrees.

708
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:16,508
Get the radio, Kestrel!
We need to get the flyboys in here.

709
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:24,516
Get that map.
We'll need to get an exact location.

710
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:37,154
The nearest safe zone is France.
Strasbourg, 100 kilometres.

711
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:38,614
Nate.

712
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:41,158
Thank you.

713
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:43,702
It isn't over yet. Disable the bomb.

714
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:45,162
Working on it.

715
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:56,131
We got company!

716
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,892
Hold on tight, baby!

717
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,686
This will be one hell of a bumpy ride!

718
01:25:33,586 --> 01:25:35,879
Bravo-One-Seven,
tighten up that formation.

719
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:38,173
We're taking heavy flack fire.

720
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,994
Target acquired. Weapons armed.

721
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:14,293
Machine gun, watch out.

722
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:21,925
Take this fucker out.

723
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,063
Bravo-One-Seven, bombs away.

724
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:46,116
- You got that location for me?
- Yes. It's ready.

725
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:50,829
This is Alpha-Charley-Seven.

726
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:58,754
Kill zone is foxtrot quadrant
six-two-white-delta-three.

727
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:03,008
The target is a black Nazi jeep
with a machine-gun mount.

728
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,510
Tell the boys to come in low
from the north.

729
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,888
Copy that, we're on our way.

730
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:09,473
Happy hunting.

731
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:22,069
How you doing, doc?

732
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:23,779
Almost there.

733
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,114
Bogey on your right!

734
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:32,537
It's disabled.

735
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:34,915
Come on.

736
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:37,251
Come on, you Nazi bastards!

737
01:27:58,523 --> 01:27:59,690
Great job, boys!

738
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:02,901
Smoked them.
We'll see you on the flip side.

739
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,195
Roger that. Just doing our job.

740
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,367
Ransom?

741
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:12,953
I'm fine.

742
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:29,905
Nathaniel Burrows, welcome back.

743
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:39,748
There you go.

744
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:44,878
My name is Lieutenant Conti...

745
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:50,300
...and I have with me a letter
from our division commander.

746
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:55,055
It's of highest importance.

747
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:59,309
"No words could express
how grateful we are...

748
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:03,855
...for what you and your squad were able
to accomplish, given the circumstances.

749
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:08,235
Today, we are truly
in the company of heroes."

750
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:15,033
Now, the device
that you brought back...

751
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,911
...that was the very definition
of priceless.

752
01:30:18,996 --> 01:30:20,705
And I promise you this:

753
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:25,419
History will prove that it was worth
every life lost in its pursuit.

754
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:33,927
Now, that being said...

755
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:39,099
...none of what you did, or saw,
or learned...

756
01:30:39,308 --> 01:30:43,186
...from the morning of the German
bombardment to your return to this CP...

757
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:45,272
...ever happened.

758
01:30:46,065 --> 01:30:50,694
There'll be no medals,
no commendations, no promotions.

759
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,071
You can't tell your family.

760
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,949
Hell, you can't even tell your preacher.

761
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:58,201
None of this happened.

762
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:00,579
Do you understand?

763
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:06,418
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

764
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:09,546
Now on a personal note...

765
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:12,591
...I had the distinct honour...

766
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,052
...to serve with your father in France
under General Pershing.

767
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:20,390
He was a hell of a man.

768
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:25,395
So I've heard.

769
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,443
Can I go home, sir?

770
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:34,029
I'll make sure
you're on the next truck out.

771
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:41,328
Thanks for your service, son.

772
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:49,252
Your father would be very proud of you.

773
01:32:44,684 --> 01:32:47,310
So tell me about these two girls
back home.

774
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:58,488
Keep it going, bro.

775
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:13,211
Well, me old Yankee Doodle...

776
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:15,589
...as a great man once said...

777
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:17,799
...all good things come to an end.

778
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:42,699
I knew that kid
would make Valentine's Day.
