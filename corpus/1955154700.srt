INTERN
- MUNDO FASHION -

2
00:00:57,355 --> 00:00:59,050
Is that Nina Zamoi?

3
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,485
I can't believe that the editor of
"Vogue" is going to parade...

4
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:03,957
- her bony at the Skirt party!
- Dare she!

5
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:17,498
- Fag!
- Asshole!

6
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:38,585
So I don't care about
a neurotical, I mean...

7
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:42,563
he got me to stop eating sushi for
about 20 min. But then I said...

8
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:45,099
seize the damn!
I'm not gonna be sway

9
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:49,535
I mean... it's not that I'm dying
to tear it out but...

10
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:53,438
honestly, what's the worst
thing that can happen?

11
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:56,478
I get a tapeworm and I eat
what I like, and still...

12
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:59,344
Iose 20 pouds? I'd rather be
like Karen Carpenter...

13
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:02,611
on the top of the world,
looking down on creation.

14
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:05,146
Wouldn't that be dreaming?

15
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:08,687
But enough about "moi". What did
you say your name was again?

16
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:11,418
- Jocelyn.
- And you work at...

17
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:15,965
- Skirt Magazine.
- Roxanne Rochet, I love her like a sister!

18
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:19,564
- What do you do there?
- You know... this and that.

19
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:23,730
Details, darling!
Are you a writer, a stylist?

20
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:27,504
- I'm a "head pian".
- Excuse me?

21
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,647
- The resident xerox core.
- And what is this?

22
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:32,812
I'm an intern.

23
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:35,382
She's an intern

24
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:39,953
She's an intern

25
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:42,591
A pathetic, nulling
intern

26
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,989
Slaved little
intern

27
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,289
Fax this
Xerox that

28
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:49,592
Slaved little
intern

29
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:52,302
Get me coffee
Kiss my ass

30
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:56,903
Sometimes she may get the blues
But everyone would spin and lose

31
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,066
You may think life isn't fair

32
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:01,905
But everybody's got
to start somewhere

33
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,672
Slaved little
intern

34
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:08,711
Fax this
Xerox that

35
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:11,251
Slaved little
intern

36
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:13,947
Get me coffee
Kiss my ass

37
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:18,494
If the paginator loses the notes
Your duty then should be harpon

38
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:21,164
Vegetables, cocktails
cappucino skin

39
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:23,391
That's the way it goes
in the mags

40
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:25,536
Honey, it sleeps on twirls

41
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:35,669
Get me coffee
Kiss my ass

42
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,046
Capuccino skin
Kiss my ass

43
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:49,215
Sometimes she may get the blues
But everyone would spin and lose

44
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:51,824
You may think life just isn't fair

45
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:54,793
But everybody's got
to start somewhere

46
00:03:56,901 --> 00:03:59,199
Slaved little
intern

47
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,904
Fax this
Xerox that

48
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,668
Slaved little

49
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:07,004
Get me coffee
Kiss my ass

50
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:13,616
She's an intern

51
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,582
She's an intern

52
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:22,225
The pathetic

53
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:25,763
Nulling intern

54
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:39,275
I am Jocelyn Bennett, and we are at
the Skirt Magazine headquarters...

55
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:42,037
i.e., where fashion trends
are invented.

56
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:44,237
How about how you got here.

57
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:47,816
Well, I think I took my school
model a little bit too serious.

58
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,579
When I was taught not to be
served but to serve...

59
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:53,724
I think they had God's
delivery in mind...

60
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:57,119
and not fashion magazines. I could
be in the staff of "Glamour"...

61
00:04:57,328 --> 00:04:59,353
but I'd rather be
an intern at Skirt.

62
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,328
I like to think of myself as a
missionary to salvage the tacky.

63
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:05,830
This is our Associate Greeter,
a.k. A, receptionist.

64
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:07,803
Hey, Deborah.

65
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:10,800
Deborah Duchet is the Gatekeeper,
the "Saint Peter" of Skirt...

66
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:13,772
She separates the men from the
boys. Let's watch her in action.

67
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:16,138
What the hell are all these
cameras doing here?

68
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:19,145
I'm doing a tour for channel 13
that nobody else wanted to get.

69
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:22,178
- Hello, Skirt.
- Isn't she a genius?

70
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,751
Let's move on.

71
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:26,081
That's Roxanne Rochet,
our Fashion Director...

72
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,655
let's follow her.

73
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,793
Don't you just love
her Chanel?

74
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,989
This is her first day back
since the accident.

75
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:35,497
Her breast implant exploded
on a Concorde.

76
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,097
The show must go on. Messages?
Get Tokio on line 1.

77
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:42,306
Get my boots back to Christine,
because they need new legs.

78
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,599
Give me an overwrap.
Did you call Garin?

79
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:46,437
What's going on with
John Bartlett photo shoot?

80
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:48,670
Get me an overwrap,
I want an...

81
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:51,872
Himalaian rejuvenation lime
and berry acid peel.

82
00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:55,850
And get me some Valium,
I'm suffering from such jet lag.

83
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:58,317
Where is Cecilia Soleil?

84
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:00,955
She's on maternity leave
this month.

85
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:02,626
This month?

86
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:05,523
It only takes one day to bung with a baby.

87
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:09,159
- Yes, Roxanne?
- Capuccino.

88
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,096
Right away, Roxanne.

89
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:13,336
Okay, let's move on.

90
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:18,899
This is the Editor Large.

91
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,907
This is the Editor Super Large...

92
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:23,579
and this is the Editor
Slender Regular.

93
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:25,544
Actually, I'm not sure
what they do.

94
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,150
They just sort of gormegan
from sale to sale.

95
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:31,745
- Excuse me, Antoinette?
- Bob.

96
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:34,657
No. I'm Jocelyn.

97
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:39,024
- No, you need a bob.
- Everybody, there's been a tragedy.

98
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:42,690
Chi Chi Chemise's fainted.

99
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,302
- Messages?
- No, let's go take at that.

100
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:54,477
- "C'est quis pas"?
- Perspective, Vogue just came out.

101
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:57,409
There's an article on it just like
we'll have on our next issue.

102
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,482
- Of course there's been a leak.
- Another leak?

103
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:02,209
Can you believe it? It's the third
issue in a row this's happened.

104
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:05,321
That is no coincidence.
There must be Yuri.

105
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:06,990
- What's a "Yuri"?
- A spy, you idiot...

106
00:07:07,158 --> 00:07:10,719
like Mata Hari, James Bond...
When was the last time she ate?

107
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:13,530
She had an apple 2 days ago,
she should be fine.

108
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:15,598
Just the trauma from the article?

109
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,698
Maybe we should take her
shoes off or something.

110
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:24,438
Oh, my God!

111
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:27,410
- Where are my shoes?
- Here.

112
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:30,810
We should get out of here.

113
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,248
Many years of pointing, you know...

114
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:35,977
ballet.

115
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:41,948
- Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!
- Don't worry, Jocelyn.

116
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:45,626
How do you know my name?

117
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,027
I don't know.

118
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:52,102
This is Paul Rochester,
Deputy Art Director.

119
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:54,061
Hello.

120
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:57,401
Have a nice tour.

121
00:07:57,775 --> 00:07:59,174
Thanks.

122
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,104
Well... you go...
you go that way.

123
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:07,710
- Where to now?
- The Beauty Department.

124
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,453
- What, what is it?
- Whore!

125
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:12,856
- Who?
- Whore is here.

126
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:16,516
- Roxane Rochett?
- Not that whore, the nail enamel!

127
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:19,761
- Whore!
- What does it mean?

128
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:22,562
It means fuck me,
but respect me.

129
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,258
Worship my body, but the
upkeep is going to be costly.

130
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:27,971
Stripe me, spurn me,
treat me as your Spaniel.

131
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:30,663
I'm your dog and I'm
gonna break the leash on you!

132
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:33,174
- Calm down, Cornelia! Arf! Arf!
- I'm sorry!

133
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:36,005
Just transports me to a dirty
corner of 42nd street.

134
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:38,375
- Breathlessly.
- That's naughty!

135
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:41,584
- I adore the shade!
- Who the fuck are you?

136
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:44,152
Why do we care what you think?
What are you, an intern?

137
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:45,652
Yes.

138
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:47,847
What about that last intern?

139
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:50,027
She had those bug eyes, looked
like Courtney Cox on chemo.

140
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:57,594
Let me give you two pieces of
advice: Always wear black and...

141
00:08:57,835 --> 00:09:00,861
you never finish shitting
until you piss again.

142
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:03,029
Remember that and
you'll be fine here.

143
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:06,039
- Thank you, I'll keep it in mind.
- I'm just busting your balls!

144
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,837
- Come on!
- You can laugh!

145
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:10,013
- I like her vibe, though! - Nice vibe.

146
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:13,173
Good vibe! Come visit me
in my office and...

147
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:15,410
We'll chat sometime.
A little less rouge.

148
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:17,350
Are we working or
are we chatting?

149
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:18,852
Pardon me?

150
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:21,024
Yeah! Obviously you!
Who else would I be talking to?

151
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:24,358
- Rocky, the camera man?
- Director "odd" Photography.

152
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:27,257
Oh, great!
Come here now! Chop-chop!

153
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:30,889
You remember when I asked you
to do a special project for me?

154
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:33,036
- Did you see it...
- Yeah, I saw it!

155
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,229
I found it. You'd better look
your intern ass I found it!

156
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:39,241
And I found something along
with it too: Errors, major ones.

157
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:41,536
Errors that we cannot
afford to make.

158
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:43,145
- Like what?
- Honey...

159
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:45,282
we are not at "Harper's Bazaar".

160
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:48,076
The big boss down the hall
would not be thrilled.

161
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,717
She'd be very glad that
I had a spare moment...

162
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:52,981
to oversee this...
this "work".

163
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:55,455
I delegated this project to you
because I thought you could...

164
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:57,617
handle it, unfortunately,
I've learned you can't.

165
00:09:57,795 --> 00:10:00,992
Re-typing my rolodeck was just
that difficult task for you, huh?

166
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:05,196
For example:
Lann Wayner's card.

167
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,602
Why is there only
one "n"on lann?

168
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,672
Did you know he added
an extra "n" years ago?

169
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:16,006
Andy Warhol's card, did you even
think to verify this number?

170
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
- No, because he's dead.
- Excuses!

171
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:21,776
You just don't get it, do you?
Dead or alive, I still...

172
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:23,852
need their phone
numbers.

173
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:27,818
This is for your own benefit,
not mine, okay?

174
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:30,287
No bad blood?

175
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:32,422
It's curse!

176
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:37,226
Dolly! You're back from the
couture show! How is Lacroix?

177
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:39,960
That is Dolly Bellows,
she's an institution.

178
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:42,435
- Give me a tissue.
- That man is a genius!

179
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,609
The word genius is
really in overuse

180
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,940
Lacroix transcends the
English language. My God!

181
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:53,705
How could they think threatical
vehicles as words can express...

182
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:57,648
what Lacroix is all about?
Don't they get it?

183
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:00,085
Don't they understand?
He's not about a dictionary...

184
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:04,557
he's about spirit!
Oh, God!

185
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:08,090
Spirit, spirit, spirit!
Any messages?

186
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:12,100
A fax is coming in.

187
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,697
From Europe!

188
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:17,271
Paris studios.
Carl Lagerfeld to...

189
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:20,375
the Editor in Chief.

190
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:26,375
I have a fax for the
Editor in Chief.

191
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,384
The Editor in Chief is
waiting for it.

192
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:30,413
You can go in.

193
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:39,452
I'm sorry to interrupt,
I have a fax for you.

194
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:46,828
Okay. Thanks.

195
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:51,068
The work is piling up, and
I really should be getting to it.

196
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:54,143
I have to retype a roll of decks,
get tea, pick up a huge garment...

197
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:56,813
bag, anyway, the xerox
machine awaits me.

198
00:11:56,981 --> 00:12:00,439
So, now you know the people
on staff aren't really snobs.

199
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:03,879
They're just better than
everybody else is. Is it enough?

200
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:07,182
- That was great, thank you
. - Let me know when it's on.

201
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:09,849
I can watch in my time
off on Channel 13.

202
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:11,790
Thanks a lot, kiddo.
Hang in there.

203
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:14,021
It seems like a pretty
tough place to work.

204
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:17,293
Hey, Paul.

205
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:19,698
These are the photos for
the acessory page.

206
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,338
She's gonna come here and show
you exactly how she wants them.

207
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,008
Why won't these people
let me do my job?

208
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:27,004
I know!

209
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:34,510
What's that stuff you're
always playingwith?

210
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:36,277
"Silly Putty"!

211
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:37,921
It calms me down.

212
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:41,783
'Hobos on a Grassy Knoll"?
I love them.

213
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:44,450
- They're the best band!
- You know "Hobos on a Grassy Knoll"!

214
00:12:44,628 --> 00:12:47,563
Totally! "The Americans"
is my favorite song!

215
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:49,426
That's impossible, no one
in the States knows them.

216
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,261
I saw them when they went
to London last March...

217
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,130
- in Cambridge.
- That's insane! I was there!

218
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:56,068
Get out of here! You were there?
That's crazy!

219
00:12:56,273 --> 00:12:59,333
I worship this poster.
Where did you get it?

220
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:04,444
- Well, I designed that, actually.
- Do you know them?

221
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:07,215
Bob Green and I went to
Eton together.

222
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:10,946
Paul, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

223
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,952
Everywhere except
my office, I guess.

224
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:14,920
I heard you were in the shitter.

225
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,458
Roxanne needs you to discuss the
concept for the cover shoot...

226
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:19,459
Pardon me, Jocelyn.

227
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:26,502
Hey, cut it out. You can't
go through his drawers.

228
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:28,969
- Does he not smoke? What is this?
- The 21st century, no smoking...

229
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:32,040
in office buildings, go out on the
street with the rest of the junkies.

230
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:33,505
Spank me again!

231
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:35,736
I think there's a part-time
position opening at the vault.

232
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:37,538
Let's look in here.

233
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:39,648
Maybe we'll find
some naughty toys.

234
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,784
He doesn't exactly seem like
the kiddie-porn type.

235
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:45,752
He's such a sweetie, gorgeous!
I wished he was into sausages...

236
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:49,891
I think I'll never be graced
by his sweet ass.

237
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:53,621
- You mean Paul's no gay?
- Your "gaydar" is failing.

238
00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:55,798
Paul is as straight as
Mark Jacob's pleat.

239
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,398
- Interesting!
- Every fashion magazine...

240
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:00,332
needs their token
hetero male.

241
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:02,096
It's like reverse feminine
action.

242
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:04,798
Fuck! I gotta dash.
I'm off that Palm press.

243
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:14,343
I think Judaism beats
Buddhism...

244
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:16,577
in the next century. I really do.
And I've got the jump-start.

245
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,981
- I'm taking kabala classes.
- I'm sure I've seen sketches of a...

246
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:21,987
- Moses collection come cross my desk.
- Wait a minute, haven't you seen...

247
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,252
- at Skirt magazine?
- Please, darling!

248
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:27,656
Are they finally eclipsing Vogue
in fashion for advance?

249
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:31,993
Skirt will only race clean when
it shows the bat about one ways.

250
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:36,400
It's true! They totally missed
the ball on those princess skirts.

251
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:39,107
That's because Roxanne
Rochett is Coco.

252
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,904
No! She's only addicted
to painkillers.

253
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:43,943
Remember her breast
exploded?

254
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:49,214
You know? I do think they're
the most creative.

255
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,945
Who else would've paid me to
scout that active volcano and...

256
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:55,623
- and keep the diary of it?
- And that burger salt layer...

257
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,385
- was genius!
- True.

258
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,893
Gwyneth, you like them because
you have been in every issue...

259
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:02,931
- for the past three years.
- Excuse me!

260
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,658
I like them because
they're innovators.

261
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:08,703
- You'd better watch your back, Jack!
- I'm not worried...

262
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:11,031
I've got someone on the inside.

263
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:15,636
- You crocodile! - You know me, girl!

264
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:20,306
As you all know, our Editor
Chief's husband is suffering...

265
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:22,918
from testicular cancer.

266
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:28,317
Once again, Skirt Magazine will host
this year's carnival and ball...

267
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:31,586
"Save our balls" ball.

268
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:34,931
We'll have booze there and
I need all of you to sign up.

269
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:37,260
The clipboard will now circulate.

270
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:41,595
We have some very serious
issues to get down to.

271
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,708
As you know, Vogue
magazine ran...

272
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:46,842
a canteen chic feature,
and that means...

273
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:52,443
we still have an info trader
in the midst of our operation.

274
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:56,445
It was dreadful enough when they
copied that year moth explosions...

275
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:59,588
on terrific towing spreads
but now this?

276
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:01,825
I abhor Nina Zamoi.

277
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:04,986
I abhor that whore.

278
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:08,690
I wish the most evil thing in the
world would happen to her.

279
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:10,595
I wish that...

280
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:13,695
an anti-fur activist marched
into the "Four Seasons"...

281
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:16,201
and dropped a bloody dead
raccoon carcass...

282
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,432
onto her freezing salad,
Spiring the balzabic and blood...

283
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:21,474
all over her Valentino
contourship...

284
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,546
- Easy.
- Okay, sit down.

285
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:27,777
We are not in this battle alone,
I've enlisted the aid...

286
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:30,180
of a very valued ally.

287
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:32,350
Deep Throat?

288
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:37,690
He was instrumental in cracking the
case of the missing Manolo Blahnik.

289
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:41,054
Roxette, do you really think
we need the Deep Throat?

290
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:43,699
Why can't we just find the
Yuri within ourselves?

291
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:48,102
Call me silly, but I have
a hunch it might be...

292
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:50,465
- Pierre Larroux.
- Nonsense!

293
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:54,241
Pierre may be an obsequious,
ass-licking meretricious...

294
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:56,308
sick offend, but Yuri he's not.

295
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,981
He's off to a secret shoot...

296
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,648
for Vogue.

297
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:03,981
- What?
- Lies!

298
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,052
He'd better not be.

299
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:08,621
Ok, now let's move on.
Cornelia?

300
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,223
Chi Chi, any trend report
from the front?

301
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:18,300
I heard from the chef at "Daveé",
who heard from his boyfriend...

302
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:20,937
who works backstage at Galliano,
with Orlando Pitta...

303
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:24,106
whose blow drier system just
came from the Gautier show...

304
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:27,504
that his next collection
will be revolutionary.

305
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:30,642
The girls will come out
on the catwalk...

306
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:33,576
in wheelchairs.

307
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:38,221
Wheelchair chic?

308
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:40,446
- Genius!
- Inspirational.

309
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,885
I think Da Vinci did sketches
of wheelchair prototypes.

310
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:47,124
- We can use those for the layout.
- I have goose bumps.

311
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:56,432
Nine pages!

312
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:02,577
Jocelyn, I see you put your name
down for the...

313
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,681
"make your own video" booth.
Do you know?

314
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:08,215
I think I'm gonna join you
on that one.

315
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,783
Paul, Jocelyn, why don't you guys
run over to Gustav's studio now...

316
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:13,445
and I'll be there in a few minutes
All right? Just sit tight.

317
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:15,148
Great!

318
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:34,542
Hi, this is Luke Perry telling you
to buckle up...

319
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:36,975
cause anything worse than
slamming into the windshield...

320
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:39,809
is getting a whip of Jason
Priestley's breath in the morning.

321
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:45,514
Who's bad enough that every taxi
in New York reaps...

322
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,657
but now he's in the terciary level
celebrity though...

323
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,021
pouring us not to plunge
through the windshield.

324
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:52,159
It's an interesting way to
attempt to comeback.

325
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:54,023
It's gotta be a bummer to
be all famous...

326
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:56,132
be on the cover of Tiger B
for one decade...

327
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,530
and be virtually anonymous
the next.

328
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:00,566
I'd rather never be famous,
thank you.

329
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:04,400
I totally agree, but actually I
think it would be a bad attitude...

330
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,669
to cover a great cult or kitsch
project and disappear...

331
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:10,279
like Suburbia or somewhere
in the pan-States.

332
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:13,644
It's true. But I guess it's too
easy to get sucked in.

333
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:18,851
What the fuck is a white and
black cow doing here?

334
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:21,989
I asked specifically for an
all-black cow!

335
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:25,557
We were expecting this.
Uh! I hate cows!

336
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:28,531
Where is everybody? We're
completely understaffed.

337
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,699
Thank God!

338
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:34,833
You look stunning, darling.

339
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:37,267
These people are driving me crazy!

340
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:41,036
- The tone art has made me!
- What did he do?

341
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:44,714
He filed my second nail toe
too much, now it looks weird.

342
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:49,681
- It looks perfect, darling.
- The level of my eyes is...

343
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,721
garish blurred Mahogany rouge,
totally clashes with the rouge...

344
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:56,889
concolor lipstick. You know how
my cosmetic company hates it...

345
00:19:57,094 --> 00:20:00,689
when the lip line is darker than the
lipstick, it's totally distracting.

346
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:03,432
- He can't understand what I say!
- Darling...

347
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,864
it's a cover shoot, you don't
have to say anything.

348
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:08,394
Don't speak. No more.

349
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,037
Whatever. Do you want to see
what they want me to wear?

350
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:17,736
I'll let you tie my bikini strings.

351
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,485
Excuse me, you're not supposed
to touch that!

352
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:25,815
- I beg your pardon?
- No, I'm just kidding.

353
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:27,388
You are Jocelyn, right?

354
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:31,789
Alex? We met at the Couture
Birthday Fashion shoot.

355
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:36,263
- Oh, yeah! How are you?
- I can't believe these people, man!

356
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,333
They are nuts! What's up with the
tooled on that broad, you know?

357
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:41,902
We're doing fashion here,
not high art.

358
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:44,264
I guess she just takes
pride in her work.

359
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:47,634
I need you to fill the water bottles
to spray on Resin.

360
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,436
- What? - Pierre insists...

361
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:51,671
on the misty look, I need you to
put this Evian into the bottles...

362
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:53,975
and practice spraying, now.

363
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:56,142
- Yeah, I'll help you.
- That's what he said.

364
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:58,251
- He said to paint the cow...
- You!

365
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:03,853
You are the sprinkler?
Fantastique!

366
00:21:05,996 --> 00:21:07,759
A vision!

367
00:21:09,232 --> 00:21:13,862
Gentle worrying eels just
outside Dublin...

368
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:21,438
Meteorology: 66 degrees, a crispy
October haze on a gray day...

369
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:27,279
the charcoal clouds, they
come, yet, back home...

370
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,854
I'm ready now!

371
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:35,482
Okay, okay! Let's get
this party started now!

372
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:39,693
I'm not painting that cow!
I don't care!

373
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:44,266
I told you on the phone I
wanted an all-black cow...

374
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:47,367
and you and your make-up people
are gonna paint the goddamn cow...

375
00:21:47,604 --> 00:21:52,371
all black. You have to
do what I told you...

376
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:01,741
That was a long day,
wasn't it?

377
00:22:01,952 --> 00:22:04,079
I can't believe we've been working
for 8 hours.

378
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:07,087
They could fly to Moscow without
they mingle ice with ice flake.

379
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:13,722
You know, Jocelyn, I gotta tell you
one thing, I think you are...

380
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:16,124
the best sprinkler
I've ever seen.

381
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:18,859
Indeed, indeed.

382
00:22:19,102 --> 00:22:20,694
Marvelous!

383
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:24,599
I got a new calling. Mom
and dad are gonna love this one!

384
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:28,436
Dad, I gotta follow my heart!

385
00:22:28,712 --> 00:22:32,842
- Okay, my U$20.000 degree...
- This is me.

386
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:38,279
I created the haze of Dublin in
a Greenwich Village studio.

387
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:41,924
You want my vision?
You want my vision?

388
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:45,986
Where is Kathy Bates
when we need her?

389
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:49,893
- "I'll never let go, Jack."
- Send the life-boat...

390
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:52,562
Paul, let's go.

391
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:54,570
I was just knocking around
with Jocelyn.

392
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:58,169
This is Jocelyn, your spritzer,
you met her.

393
00:22:58,341 --> 00:22:59,899
Hi!

394
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,908
I'm gonna be late for Patrick
Tomarce's book party.

395
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:07,749
I gotta split.

396
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:09,545
Are you all right with your...

397
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,243
- what is that?
- Ribbon?

398
00:23:11,421 --> 00:23:13,184
Yeah, ribbon rapping?

399
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:17,184
- Jocelyn, I can help you.
- Thanks, Alex.

400
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:22,062
Well, I'll see you at
the Carnival tomorrow.

401
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:25,292
Don't touch me,
you're all wet!

402
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:32,235
Jocelyn, I think we could get a cup
of coffee after or something?

403
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:35,310
- Sure!
- Clean-up time, Jocelyn.

404
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:44,077
Jocelyn, how are you doing?
Where have you been?

405
00:23:44,187 --> 00:23:46,815
Hi, Nate, I need to pick up
Sebastian's packages.

406
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:49,182
Really? What are his packages:
Big or small?

407
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:51,724
It's his luggage from the trip
to St. Bart.

408
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:53,793
It's that stuff back there.

409
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:57,026
It's too big for you, Jocelyn.
We'll take it up.

410
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,100
- Thanks.
- While you're here...

411
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:01,396
- do you think you can help us out?
- Sure. What is it?

412
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:03,935
We found this package outside
our door this morning...

413
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:06,473
But it didn't have no telephone
extention or return number.

414
00:24:06,643 --> 00:24:08,975
So we took it to the 4th,
Time Square, but...

415
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,079
- That's Conde Nest.
- Yeah.

416
00:24:11,281 --> 00:24:13,511
It was addressed to an Andre
Leon Talley, but...

417
00:24:13,717 --> 00:24:16,584
Andre Leon Talley?
Let me see this.

418
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:20,421
I don't even know where it came
from, what can I do with it?

419
00:24:20,757 --> 00:24:22,884
I'll take it. Thanks!

420
00:24:25,061 --> 00:24:27,996
Slow down, punter foot.
This isn't Sports Ilustrated.

421
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:29,655
Look what I just found
in the messenger center.

422
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:31,595
- Where did you get this?
- In the messenger center.

423
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:34,269
- Somebody was trying to send it...
- I've been looking all over for these.

424
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:36,803
- I know, that's why...
- This is very serious, Jocelyn!

425
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:40,242
I don't understand. Why you
have these layouts...

426
00:24:40,443 --> 00:24:43,378
and why you're "messengering"
them to someone.

427
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:46,047
I wasn't the messenger,
I was asked to return it.

428
00:24:46,216 --> 00:24:48,241
- Someone left it there.
- Someone?

429
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:52,747
Maybe that someone is you.
And maybe you were planning...

430
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:56,255
on sneaking them back into my
drawer before you were discovered.

431
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,791
- Sebastian, I'm not the Yuri.
- Interesting!

432
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:01,859
You're very defensive.

433
00:25:02,098 --> 00:25:04,532
- I can't believe this!
- But I'll believe it...

434
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,066
until you come up
with another Yuri.

435
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,600
I'll keep my eye on you.

436
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:12,872
Watch your back...

437
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,700
jag.

438
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:42,564
Over here...

439
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:43,994
- Over here.
- Where?

440
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:48,468
Over here. I told you to
never contact me again.

441
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:50,367
It's an emergency.

442
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,074
You helped me with Manolo's
and I really need your help now...

443
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,733
This is different.

444
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:56,776
This goes deeper.

445
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,110
- How deep?
- Fucking motherfucker...

446
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:04,445
cock-sucker, fuck...
sorry.

447
00:27:04,688 --> 00:27:07,384
- It's my Tourett syndrome again.
- I know. I'm used to it.

448
00:27:07,524 --> 00:27:08,923
- Now listen.
- Red fuck!

449
00:27:09,092 --> 00:27:10,491
We need help.

450
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:13,060
Somebody has been stealing our
story ideas and trading them...

451
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:16,858
- to Nian Zamoi, at Vogue.
- I know all about it, pussy.

452
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,998
- Do you know who it is?
- We're not gonna do it that way.

453
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,738
First, you're going to tell
me what you know and I'm gonna

454
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:26,137
- tell you if you're right.
- I have a sneaking suspicion...

455
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:29,174
it could be Pierre Larroux,
our make-up artist.

456
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:31,610
Look deeper.
Look closer.

457
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:33,676
Follow the fashion!

458
00:27:34,718 --> 00:27:36,117
What do you mean?

459
00:27:36,886 --> 00:27:38,877
They are brilliant!
Did you design them?

460
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:41,319
No. I have to give credit
where credit's due.

461
00:27:41,491 --> 00:27:43,959
- Sebastian designed them.
- Yes, darling, you do know...

462
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:48,062
that I have a better grasp
on the subject than he.

463
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:51,689
It's time to pile into the town
cars and you can check the list...

464
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:54,768
for what booths you're assigned to,
and the times. And remember...

465
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,371
when you're not in the booths,
you're still representing Skirt.

466
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:02,741
I wish I could always have a cock
this big this close to my face.

467
00:28:02,946 --> 00:28:04,436
- You are disgusting!
- Actually...

468
00:28:04,647 --> 00:28:06,512
my room service boy in Paris...

469
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:08,877
wasn't so different from the
dimensions on this shirt

470
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,883
You should see him serve
more than a petit dejanuai.

471
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:13,949
You chaseabout! What did you have
on your customs card...

472
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,125
when you came back:
Business or pleasure?

473
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,851
Honey, no matter how many times you
have your croissant buttered over...

474
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,860
- there, it's still work.
- All right. Time to move out.

475
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:26,068
If you need to reach me,
you can call my beeper.

476
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:28,466
It's 197-UP-SKIRT.

477
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:42,545
The most important thing
to do right now...

478
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,449
This is absolute disgrace!

479
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:53,489
I can't believe we're
all the way downtown...

480
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:56,188
volunteer for this damn
charity carnival.

481
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,368
It's pathetic! You don't see anyone
at Vogue having to do this.

482
00:28:59,736 --> 00:29:02,204
I'm the Hair Editor.
I don't crawl around...

483
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:04,669
on the ground picking up dart
in the name of expertise.

484
00:29:04,874 --> 00:29:07,365
It's a fairly unusual
charity.

485
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,769
Although balls are important.

486
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,272
- Antoniette, how's you husband?
- You're married?

487
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:16,746
- Absolutely!
- And does he still live in Spain?

488
00:29:16,953 --> 00:29:19,683
Yes, the Atlantic is a fabulous
thing for our relatonship.

489
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,381
How often do you see
each other?

490
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:24,320
At holidays!

491
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:30,999
You were a great director
in that video.

492
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:33,032
Maybe you don't screw this.

493
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:36,036
Actually I was going to be a
photographer, but the only people

494
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:39,764
who would hire me is sleazy balls
in those tabloid photo agencies.

495
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:41,967
What did you have to do?
Stalk people?

496
00:29:42,145 --> 00:29:43,737
Exactly what I did.

497
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:45,642
Casually I needed to follow
Carol O'Connor...

498
00:29:45,815 --> 00:29:47,874
with the sun acid by the
roof in the quarter.

499
00:29:48,084 --> 00:29:50,143
- That's sick!
- Yeah, beyond.

500
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:52,844
I had this severe moral thing
when I was crop star...

501
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:55,115
with my first thirty pound
laker.

502
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:57,122
I backed up after that.

503
00:29:57,494 --> 00:30:00,895
- So, how did you end up at Skirt?
- I just love Skirt.

504
00:30:01,097 --> 00:30:02,860
They have the best photography
of any magazines, really...

505
00:30:03,032 --> 00:30:05,830
the most innovative, stylish,
artistic shoots around.

506
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:10,297
How did you end up
in magazines?

507
00:30:14,878 --> 00:30:17,005
I had an excentric uncle...

508
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,909
who was my idol when
I was growing up...

509
00:30:19,182 --> 00:30:22,379
he was a sort of black sheep,
hip, rebel type.

510
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:27,954
While my parents are always trying
to drag me off to polo, blablabla...

511
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:31,455
he was always abducting me
and taking me...

512
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:34,825
- on the most amazing adventures.
- Sounds like a cool uncle.

513
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:36,725
Yeah, he was.

514
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,935
He was pretty much my savior
when I was a child.

515
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:44,137
My parents had a messy split,
and he saw me through that.

516
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:47,769
He knew I liked to paint
and he always encouraged.

517
00:30:48,945 --> 00:30:51,209
So why don't you
paint full time?

518
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:53,841
That's what I'm trying to do...

519
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:58,086
but I like graphic design and
it helps pay the bills.

520
00:30:58,321 --> 00:31:01,017
So I made a routine out of that.

521
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:05,987
Furthermore, I don't think anybody
would like to buy my paintings.

522
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:08,221
Except maybe a pizza parlor.

523
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:10,922
I'm sure people would buy
your paintings.

524
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:14,102
I have to get out of here!
I'm being harrassed!

525
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:17,373
These little beasts keep
snugging me...

526
00:31:17,574 --> 00:31:19,565
begging for an autograph...

527
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:21,903
- annoying me!
- They are children.

528
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:24,113
And I'm not the fucking
Pied Piper.

529
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:27,306
I don't want them
following me. Shoo!

530
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:31,146
- Get away! Go!
- Calm down. I'm gonna be...

531
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:33,686
half an hour more
at this. Then we take...

532
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,415
- a nice walk.
- I hate walking.

533
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,752
Besides, my driver's around
the corner.

534
00:31:38,962 --> 00:31:40,896
I have to go meet Simas
Gort Morgan...

535
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,961
and he's going to introduce me
to Milo Norbuck...

536
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,828
who's gonna be in the new CK
campaign with me.

537
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:48,594
I can. Should I come with you?

538
00:31:49,572 --> 00:31:51,767
- It's business.
- It's business, right.

539
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:55,943
Page me tomorrow and maybe
we'll have dinner, okay?

540
00:31:56,412 --> 00:31:59,973
Page?

541
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,089
You know, Jocelyn, I have
been inside all day...

542
00:32:07,256 --> 00:32:09,952
and I would like to take
a nice walk.

543
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:13,387
- Would you like to join me?
- Sure, I'd love to.

544
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,831
Darling, change of plans.

545
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:26,066
I have to meet Norbuck,
at the Mercer, at 2AM...

546
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:29,210
let's have some dinner at Raul's.

547
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:38,414
- I'll take you next time, okay?
- Sure, no problem.

548
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:39,948
Okay.

549
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:49,154
Antoniette, can I borrow
your intern?

550
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:50,730
The Doyle Gallery
just called and...

551
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:53,265
they desperately need this gown.
It's the dress Kim Basinger orderly...

552
00:32:53,469 --> 00:32:56,063
asked, the one with only one sleeve,
the one for the celebrity couture...

553
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:58,036
auction, immediately.

554
00:32:58,274 --> 00:33:00,242
You can finish this when you
get back. Hurry up!

555
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,935
- You heard her.
- For God's sake, watch your back.

556
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:06,046
There are spies everywhere.
Trust no one.

557
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:09,616
- Guard that with your soul, darling.
- I shall.

558
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:11,884
I owe you lunch. November,
December or something...

559
00:33:12,088 --> 00:33:14,613
- our girls will figure it out.
- Take yourself way back.

560
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:28,364
Look who is here,
Miss Sunshine.

561
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:31,569
- Hello, Jocelyn.
- Hi.

562
00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:33,504
How is everything at the
mental ward downtown?

563
00:33:33,676 --> 00:33:35,735
You know, reigns, but always
a learning experience.

564
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:37,537
You're a tripper!

565
00:33:37,714 --> 00:33:39,739
That is lot 163.

566
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:42,180
Jocelyn, where have you been?

567
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:44,751
Kim Basinger needed to go up on
that wall hours ago.

568
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:47,851
She's the cornerstone of this
entire operation. What could've...

569
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:51,482
- possibly hold you up?
- Well, I guess you haven't heard?

570
00:33:52,061 --> 00:33:54,154
- Heard what?
- Oh, nothing.

571
00:33:54,363 --> 00:33:56,991
Just the revolutionary new
nail color from Mac.

572
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:59,293
Everyone's freaking out.
Chi Chi fainted.

573
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:02,328
You should've said that
right away.

574
00:34:02,805 --> 00:34:05,137
I'm gonna have to have
someone messenger me some.

575
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,912
- Where did you learn that from?
- You know...

576
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:15,482
- tricks and betrayals.
- But it can be tricky sometimes...

577
00:34:15,685 --> 00:34:18,415
- to take yourself at him.
- I'll try not to.

578
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:20,212
You've been upstairs?

579
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:24,485
If you get the chance, there's a
fantastic photo exibition...

580
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:28,424
up there, it is brilliant
I think you'll really love it.

581
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,360
Reminded me of you.

582
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,850
I've wrapped it up downstairs.

583
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:27,346
Maybe we can...

584
00:35:27,757 --> 00:35:29,884
Maybe we can take that
walk afterall.

585
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:33,251
Sounds great.

586
00:36:21,143 --> 00:36:22,701
Aren't they amazing?

587
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,380
Aren't they the best French
fries you've ever tasted?

588
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:27,606
I'd give them a silver medal.

589
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,777
Silver medal?

590
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:33,850
- What are you, a German judge?
- No, but I've had better.

591
00:36:35,524 --> 00:36:39,290
- We're gonna do a taste test.
- Fine, if you go by the Printer's.

592
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:43,161
- Where is this place?
- In Bruges, in Flanders...

593
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:45,792
- it's probable in Belgium.
- Yes, I know.

594
00:36:46,736 --> 00:36:49,671
I see someone with you or with a
bunch of girl friends.

595
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:52,466
- I went by myself.
- Did you?

596
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:56,640
- How many countries did you visit?
- I traveled the world.

597
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:59,143
I graduated early and got
a grant from my college...

598
00:36:59,348 --> 00:37:00,781
to do a photo essay...

599
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:02,882
as part of my thesis
and that was incredible!

600
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:05,451
That is amazing. I can't believe
you did all that by yourself.

601
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:07,280
I'm so impressed!

602
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:09,022
So...

603
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:10,817
were you scared?

604
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:12,927
They tried to stripsearch
me in Indonesia.

605
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:15,393
I got a little heat from my
bubblelicious probe but in...

606
00:37:15,598 --> 00:37:17,589
other letters, smooth sailing.

607
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,597
And did you make...

608
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:22,201
Did you make any
disposable friends?

609
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:27,004
A couple, but no crazy night
with Ethan Hawke in Vienna...

610
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,311
but I still have this Moroccan
family who writes to me.

611
00:37:30,513 --> 00:37:33,812
- I have the best pictures of them.
- Really? Then I'd love to see them.

612
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:35,648
Really?

613
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:37,843
- You would?
- You are so observing...

614
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,853
I bet you'd make a
great photographer.

615
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:50,990
Home sweet home.

616
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,693
I really had a great time,
Jocelyn.

617
00:37:53,903 --> 00:37:56,838
Anytime Resin is indisposed,
I'll be your walking partner.

618
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:04,578
Tomorrow will be a rough day,
I've been assigned to...

619
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,146
Skirt's security task force to
find the Yuri.

620
00:38:07,316 --> 00:38:10,217
- Sounds very gums.
- It really bothers me.

621
00:38:10,386 --> 00:38:12,115
All this fashion espionage.

622
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:14,186
Someone just takes
our hard work...

623
00:38:14,323 --> 00:38:16,848
and hand it over to Vogue.
It really pisses me off!

624
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:19,755
I'm going to make it my
mission to aprehend Yuri.

625
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:23,194
If anyone can do that,
you can.

626
00:38:23,566 --> 00:38:25,727
A spy's work is never done.

627
00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:29,230
Right, I really enjoyed that walk.

628
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:32,569
Good night, Jocelyn.

629
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,837
Sweet dreams.

630
00:39:27,296 --> 00:39:30,060
- I'm sorry, Jocelyn.
- No big deal.

631
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:36,594
Quick, quick, quick!

632
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:40,142
I need my comb!

633
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:48,008
Fabulous, fabulous!
That, wonderful.

634
00:39:48,317 --> 00:39:50,785
This is the best session!

635
00:39:50,986 --> 00:39:53,477
Come on, ladies!
Embrace the water!

636
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:56,850
Embrace it!
Make love to it!

637
00:39:57,093 --> 00:40:00,221
Let the water wash away
your sins, ladies!

638
00:40:01,297 --> 00:40:03,094
It takes a lot more
than this rain...

639
00:40:03,265 --> 00:40:05,233
to wash away their sins.

640
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:08,062
Be sexy in the rain!

641
00:40:08,404 --> 00:40:10,497
Thank God!
Aleluia! Aleluia!

642
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:14,941
You know what we need?

643
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:17,237
- The lightning machine.
- Lightning!

644
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:19,608
Lightning machine?
Let's get out of here.

645
00:40:19,815 --> 00:40:24,479
Maybe we should stick around,
get lost then start to move faster!

646
00:40:33,496 --> 00:40:36,158
I'm freezing. Call me a cube.

647
00:40:36,398 --> 00:40:38,423
This is unbeareable, cube.

648
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:40,959
I can't believe they're
making rain...

649
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:43,731
for the photo shoot with,
water from the Hudson river!

650
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:46,033
They're crazy! We're all gonna
get typhoid-d!

651
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:49,041
Listen, we gotta take off
these clothes.

652
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:51,303
We don't wanna get pneumonia.

653
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,415
Do you think they'd mind if I wore
something from the wardrobe?

654
00:40:54,617 --> 00:40:56,050
No! Go for it.

655
00:41:12,768 --> 00:41:14,736
It's too jay.

656
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:19,170
These things are supposed to
be worn, not framed.

657
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,707
- I'm swimming in it!
- Hang on. Where's your head?

658
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:23,569
Hang on.

659
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,539
That's it, that's it.
There you go.

660
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:31,451
What's that?

661
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:37,087
Hang on! Excuse me, you've
got a tag here.

662
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:44,832
I can't get it.

663
00:41:46,035 --> 00:41:49,471
Where the fuck is my
eyelash collar?

664
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:53,340
I get so mad. These
stupid people...

665
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:02,141
Here it is!

666
00:42:07,323 --> 00:42:11,191
We're gonna do it this time!
We're gonna...

667
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:14,087
I think maybe we should
get back out there.

668
00:42:15,064 --> 00:42:19,558
We've got some time left.
They won't be finished for a while.

669
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:21,929
I'm gonna sew you out.

670
00:42:25,908 --> 00:42:28,502
It's hideous out there.
I can't take it anymore.

671
00:42:28,744 --> 00:42:30,644
I just walked off.

672
00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:38,144
I don't feel well, Paul.

673
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:42,649
I just wanna go home
and cuddle off with you.

674
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,923
Okay, I'II...

675
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:50,623
- I'm gonna get your car.
- You're so sweet to me.

676
00:43:17,326 --> 00:43:20,261
- I had a great time the other day.
- Me too!

677
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:22,420
I loved working with you
at the shoot.

678
00:43:22,665 --> 00:43:24,929
And I think we make great
walking partners

679
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:27,762
- We should consider the marathon.
- Listen, Jocelyn...

680
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:32,102
I think you are amazing...

681
00:43:32,941 --> 00:43:35,034
and I loved...

682
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,110
that walk with you as well...

683
00:43:37,346 --> 00:43:40,611
and I loved hanging out
with you on the shoot...

684
00:43:41,383 --> 00:43:44,375
and God only knows I'm always
so happy when I see your face...

685
00:43:47,856 --> 00:43:50,723
I think we make great friends...

686
00:43:51,927 --> 00:43:53,292
But...

687
00:43:54,863 --> 00:43:58,196
Resin is a little pissed off because
that I see so much of you...

688
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,265
and I realized that...

689
00:44:00,669 --> 00:44:02,933
I just hope I wasn't giving
you the wrong idea.

690
00:44:03,138 --> 00:44:06,107
No. How could I forget
that you're going out...

691
00:44:06,275 --> 00:44:08,140
with the "cover girl"?
Everyone else is orgasmic...

692
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:10,709
that you're going out with her.

693
00:44:11,513 --> 00:44:15,745
- Good, because I just wanted to...
- Don't worry about it, Paul.

694
00:44:15,984 --> 00:44:19,511
- It's good to keep things open.
- That's what I...

695
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:45,473
Here. There are many more where
these came from.

696
00:44:59,528 --> 00:45:02,554
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was just wrapping this up...

697
00:45:02,765 --> 00:45:05,757
so I can go to Carl's photo
book party.

698
00:45:07,002 --> 00:45:09,732
I'll send Carls your best,
because you're not going.

699
00:45:10,072 --> 00:45:12,472
You have a very important
project to do.

700
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:14,972
Have you noticed people's
desks lately?

701
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,940
Atrocities!
I haven't seen so many colors...

702
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:20,638
since Todd Oldham's
debut collection.

703
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:23,042
It's all about black.

704
00:45:23,252 --> 00:45:25,914
What it this bullshit, anyway?

705
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:28,722
This is not Lucky Charm cereal.

706
00:45:28,924 --> 00:45:30,755
This is not "Oz".

707
00:45:30,993 --> 00:45:33,223
This is not "Skills".

708
00:45:33,562 --> 00:45:35,962
I want you to replace
each and every one...

709
00:45:36,131 --> 00:45:39,692
of these hideous five-a-dime
acessories immediately.

710
00:45:39,935 --> 00:45:42,665
Everybody's desks should be in
ship-shape by tomorrow morning.

711
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:49,070
Philip's just messengered over his
new line of desk acessories.

712
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:55,214
From now on, everything
should be black.

713
00:45:56,218 --> 00:45:58,243
Those bitches...

714
00:45:59,254 --> 00:46:01,916
they all said:
"Brown is the new black".

715
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:04,451
I got news for you, baby:

716
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,127
Black...

717
00:46:06,295 --> 00:46:08,763
could kick brown's ass.

718
00:46:25,481 --> 00:46:27,711
Jocelyn, what are you doing
working so late?

719
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:30,146
I'm making the bulletin boards
clash-proof.

720
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,787
God forbid we have a stray
yellow damn tag!

721
00:46:33,288 --> 00:46:36,155
- I'm so sorry!
- You missed a great party!

722
00:46:36,425 --> 00:46:39,883
Everybody was there. I could
have stayed all night...

723
00:46:40,028 --> 00:46:41,825
But Paul forgot his stupid disk
and we had to come...

724
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:45,466
- all the way back uptown.
- Bummer.

725
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:50,564
We won't keep you from
your work...

726
00:46:50,973 --> 00:46:53,464
I'm sure it's very important.

727
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:56,903
Come on, Paul, I wanna go home.

728
00:46:57,145 --> 00:46:59,272
Jocelyn, don't work
too late, will you?

729
00:47:23,105 --> 00:47:25,039
You are pathetic!

730
00:47:25,307 --> 00:47:27,036
What a disgrace!

731
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:31,143
- You're fired.
- You are over!

732
00:47:40,689 --> 00:47:43,920
What are you doing? You are
stupid, you're a bad person!

733
00:47:44,493 --> 00:47:46,222
You fool.

734
00:47:46,962 --> 00:47:52,298
You ashamed Skirt and you're never
ever gonna work here again.

735
00:47:56,605 --> 00:47:57,970
You!

736
00:48:01,243 --> 00:48:04,041
A new fuse!
Look at you!

737
00:48:04,246 --> 00:48:06,806
You're fabulous!
You're incredible!

738
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:10,184
The eyes, the hair, the smile!
That's it:

739
00:48:10,419 --> 00:48:12,319
The new muse!

740
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:19,193
I know her
wicked ways

741
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:23,791
The parts
you never see

742
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:30,304
Our supergirl
You are our supemodel.

743
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:34,908
Although you have
a reputation

744
00:48:35,277 --> 00:48:37,745
Can I afford

745
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,608
To abandon
my station

746
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:44,910
Mine is not the only heart
you harbor

747
00:48:45,087 --> 00:48:49,490
And I love America

748
00:48:50,492 --> 00:48:53,825
God!
Can she be cruel...

749
00:48:57,432 --> 00:48:58,956
Hi, Joce!

750
00:49:00,102 --> 00:49:02,195
What's wrong?

751
00:49:05,974 --> 00:49:08,169
I just had the worst day!

752
00:49:08,377 --> 00:49:10,675
I don't know how much more
of this crap I can take.

753
00:49:10,846 --> 00:49:13,872
I've been there for hours,
re-acessorizing the bulletin boards.

754
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:16,374
How is the hottie?

755
00:49:17,152 --> 00:49:19,848
So completely taken.

756
00:49:20,355 --> 00:49:23,324
It's hopeless, Josie.
It's completely hopeless.

757
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:25,991
I'm beginning to think
I'll never get on staff...

758
00:49:26,161 --> 00:49:28,686
and my summer money
is running low.

759
00:49:29,564 --> 00:49:32,158
Look on the bright side:

760
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:34,961
You are the star of
public television.

761
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,299
They are running your
office tour again...

762
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:40,669
for the fifth time this week.
They must have it on a loop.

763
00:49:41,743 --> 00:49:44,109
- Come here.
- I'm horrified!

764
00:49:47,115 --> 00:49:49,276
Hey did you see that?

765
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:52,478
She was coming out of
the fax room.

766
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:53,950
So?

767
00:49:54,189 --> 00:49:56,885
She never sends her own faxes.

768
00:49:57,192 --> 00:50:00,923
What's the big deal? Maybe she had
something to do in the fax room.

769
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:03,662
So what I'm thinking.

770
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:06,624
I'm loving this tone.

771
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:08,961
Tone for a just, isn't it genious?

772
00:50:09,204 --> 00:50:10,728
It's good she does LOB ingenious...

773
00:50:10,972 --> 00:50:12,837
I'll have her messenger over
some for me.

774
00:50:13,075 --> 00:50:17,273
Vuitton Gellys is planning a hostile
takeover of Fava.

775
00:50:17,512 --> 00:50:19,912
Vuitton Gellys. I loved it.

776
00:50:20,115 --> 00:50:22,015
Did you see Fendi broche bag?

777
00:50:22,217 --> 00:50:25,015
- I've got to have it!
- It's gonna be a success.

778
00:50:25,187 --> 00:50:26,620
I'll make 4 pages on it.

779
00:50:26,788 --> 00:50:29,814
What's that deal with that Vogue
stealing on your stories?

780
00:50:30,025 --> 00:50:31,925
I heard there was a curry.

781
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,288
It's Yuri, dummy, we're
talking Russians, not Indians.

782
00:50:35,497 --> 00:50:38,432
It's not me. I won't work for
Vogue anymore.

783
00:50:38,667 --> 00:50:41,329
They didn't airbrush me properly.

784
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:43,961
- The designers are butchers.
- Butchers?

785
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:47,768
Now I have my own private
airbrusher over here at Skirt.

786
00:50:48,009 --> 00:50:49,943
Paul is such a sweetie!

787
00:50:50,112 --> 00:50:54,276
- The duke with the Macintosh.
- I love working with royalty.

788
00:50:54,483 --> 00:50:57,179
I love sleeping with royalty.

789
00:50:57,385 --> 00:50:59,353
Who are you, the fourth Mallard sister?

790
00:50:59,621 --> 00:51:02,021
Not quite, Olivier.
I don't do exiles.

791
00:51:02,324 --> 00:51:05,589
I like my men underfed and overbred.

792
00:51:05,694 --> 00:51:07,662
Can you give me a tiara?

793
00:51:08,396 --> 00:51:10,489
Anyway, this one has
got polo fields...

794
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:13,066
and the largest private estate
in all of England.

795
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:14,929
Whores!
All of you.

796
00:51:26,982 --> 00:51:28,506
Hey, man!

797
00:51:28,717 --> 00:51:30,810
Do you know where
Jocelyn is?

798
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:33,750
French fries, yeah!

799
00:51:37,425 --> 00:51:39,120
- See'ya, Alex.
- Peace.

800
00:51:42,164 --> 00:51:45,565
Alex, what are you doing here?
So nice to see you!

801
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:49,965
I was dropping off some contact
sheets and I figured I'd stop by...

802
00:51:50,205 --> 00:51:52,139
and say "hi". How are you doing?
Holding up?

803
00:51:52,307 --> 00:51:54,605
Barely. I just about to transfer...

804
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,801
the Western shoot all day.
Yee-haw!

805
00:51:57,145 --> 00:52:00,376
- Do you wanna get some coffee?
- I can sneak out of here for...

806
00:52:00,649 --> 00:52:02,844
five minutes before I have to
get back to this closet.

807
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:05,383
- Cool.
- Let me just get my coat.

808
00:52:16,198 --> 00:52:18,996
Jocelyn, I'm sorry you had to work
late. Hang in there! Paul.

809
00:52:26,474 --> 00:52:31,377
John, Simmon, How sweetie!
Hello there!

810
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:35,239
- How art thou?
- Good, what about the Yuri?

811
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:36,711
- Brutal! - Brutal...

812
00:52:36,885 --> 00:52:39,353
I can't even think about it
before breakfast.

813
00:52:40,288 --> 00:52:42,381
- Jocelyn, you missed it!
- What?

814
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:45,082
Raw brilliance!
Helmets...

815
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,455
- helmets.
- Helmut Lang?

816
00:52:47,629 --> 00:52:50,223
Safety is chic.
Living is chic.

817
00:52:50,465 --> 00:52:53,263
Helmut Lang.
Helmets...

818
00:52:53,468 --> 00:52:56,198
for motorcycles, mopeds,
vespas and scooters, even.

819
00:52:57,038 --> 00:53:00,098
To die for!
Fooffy, green tea.

820
00:53:00,475 --> 00:53:03,103
We gotta make sure this trend
catches on. We gotta make sure...

821
00:53:03,311 --> 00:53:05,438
this trend is covered with
pages in the magazine.

822
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,743
- Roxanne doesn't understand this.
- It's gonna be an outrage.

823
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,113
By this time next year, We'll
have every single woman...

824
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,221
wearing helmets.
Helmets on Wall Street...

825
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,721
helmets in the opera...

826
00:53:16,892 --> 00:53:18,860
women in maternity wards
with helmets.

827
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:21,620
No more will lesbians have
a lock on helmets.

828
00:53:22,197 --> 00:53:24,427
I'll see that personally.

829
00:53:27,702 --> 00:53:29,693
It's great. Great.

830
00:53:30,538 --> 00:53:33,701
Everybody is gonna run out
and spend 4 grand for a helmet.

831
00:53:33,909 --> 00:53:35,774
It's insane, these people wouldn't
care about safety if a top...

832
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:39,641
- designer didn't tell them to.
- How do you deal?

833
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:42,479
A sense of humor is
essential for this job.

834
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:04,898
- Richard, how are you doing?
- Kenneth!

835
00:54:05,073 --> 00:54:08,270
Great shoot.
Hi, Cornelia, great to see you.

836
00:54:10,111 --> 00:54:13,137
- Did you just see that?
- Statement.

837
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:16,248
Statement? Kenneth Cole
just cut me dead.

838
00:54:16,484 --> 00:54:18,952
Obviously he didn't appreciate
our dominatrix baby shoot.

839
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,558
Where were we... US$ 25.000,
I repeat, is not enough...

840
00:54:24,726 --> 00:54:28,526
to do a piece. It's an insult
to the designer, it's an...

841
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:32,791
insult to the make-up artist, it's
an insult to the photographer...

842
00:54:32,968 --> 00:54:35,436
- and it's an insult to me.
- Don't hurt her.

843
00:54:35,603 --> 00:54:38,163
Raymond Meyer said Skirt
isn't wort his time...

844
00:54:38,373 --> 00:54:40,341
if we can't put out the dough
to hang the Henry Winston...

845
00:54:40,475 --> 00:54:42,340
on the gargoyles of the
Chrysler Building.

846
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:44,603
I agree with Raymond.

847
00:54:44,779 --> 00:54:46,440
- Can you blame him for saying that?
- No.

848
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:48,208
We can't spend that much money,
not on this day...

849
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:50,077
not with this technology.

850
00:54:50,251 --> 00:54:52,947
I can just superimpose them and
I Photoshop them on my Mac...

851
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:55,885
But you'd be cheating yourself
and the reader.

852
00:54:56,257 --> 00:54:57,952
I don't think the reader is
really gonna know.

853
00:54:58,159 --> 00:54:59,524
The reader knows.
How do I know?

854
00:54:59,728 --> 00:55:01,889
Because I knew! Look, I
was raised in the trailer part...

855
00:55:02,097 --> 00:55:04,156
- that won't leave this table.
- Oh, God!

856
00:55:04,399 --> 00:55:06,094
But the point is:
I looked foward to...

857
00:55:06,267 --> 00:55:08,827
getting my monthly Skirt.
I dropped off right on the trail...

858
00:55:09,037 --> 00:55:11,562
to get me just a dollop
of gloss and glamour.

859
00:55:11,773 --> 00:55:13,741
I needed that, so did other
millions of teenage girls...

860
00:55:14,009 --> 00:55:16,307
ass-wash clad,
coming off the arcade.

861
00:55:16,478 --> 00:55:19,709
We needed that. We wanted
hope and fantasy.

862
00:55:19,948 --> 00:55:23,816
- And we want our gargoyles real.
- Yes, we want real gargoyles...

863
00:55:24,052 --> 00:55:26,350
Do you understand us?
Real gargoyles!

864
00:55:27,922 --> 00:55:30,254
There's my sweetie.
Hey, sweetie...

865
00:55:30,392 --> 00:55:32,189
sit you cute butt down here.

866
00:55:32,394 --> 00:55:33,861
She's great!

867
00:55:34,095 --> 00:55:35,756
Am I interrupting something?

868
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,091
We are entrenched in
this serious debate...

869
00:55:38,266 --> 00:55:40,496
about the importance of
investing in beauty.

870
00:55:40,668 --> 00:55:42,727
- Have you any thoughts?
- They want to sacrifice...

871
00:55:42,937 --> 00:55:45,405
their soul for some change.

872
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,538
Do you want to decide between
the budget and truth?

873
00:55:48,877 --> 00:55:52,574
What they're saying is if there
should be caps on our shoots.

874
00:55:55,283 --> 00:55:57,877
Well, I don't think that
the sky should be the limit.

875
00:55:58,086 --> 00:56:00,054
But I do think that...

876
00:56:00,955 --> 00:56:04,083
magazines offer an escape
in innovation and...

877
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:06,560
I hope to always hope to find
fantasy and novelty...

878
00:56:06,728 --> 00:56:09,288
- on the pages of Skirt.
- Thank you, just as I thought.

879
00:56:09,564 --> 00:56:11,828
Thank you, but fantasy doesn't
come cheap, sweetheart.

880
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:13,967
Please, I don't wanna
hear the "c" word.

881
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:17,930
- Hello, darlings.
- Don't you dare throw that away.

882
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:20,539
Don't you know people
are starving at Vogue?

883
00:56:21,142 --> 00:56:22,734
- Take it.
- Jocelyn, did you finish testing...

884
00:56:22,911 --> 00:56:25,243
all of the mousse in the closet?

885
00:56:25,747 --> 00:56:28,477
I was almost done, I just
wanted to grab a bite.

886
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:32,244
Charmingly naive, but don't you
think problems are so important...

887
00:56:32,454 --> 00:56:34,354
that you shouldn't take
time for lunch? Besides...

888
00:56:34,522 --> 00:56:36,854
if you haven't noticed,
these are all editors.

889
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:40,995
Take it easy, Antoniette.

890
00:56:41,196 --> 00:56:44,256
Be nice to her She's the best
intern you've ever had.

891
00:56:47,135 --> 00:56:48,727
Over here!

892
00:56:50,338 --> 00:56:53,205
I'm so glad you got my signal.
I really need your help.

893
00:56:53,408 --> 00:56:55,376
You blew it.
They got you again.

894
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,669
Cock-sucking,
hussie, cocks'n pants...

895
00:56:57,879 --> 00:57:00,939
I know, but I need your help. Is
there gonna be another leak?

896
00:57:01,116 --> 00:57:05,348
- And if so, what's story?
- Think deeper, think FDR.

897
00:57:05,653 --> 00:57:08,451
East River Drive,
traffic jams...

898
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:11,258
- squeegee boys.
- Think deeper...

899
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:14,824
- think tacky blond bombshell.
- Sharon Stone.

900
00:57:15,029 --> 00:57:17,395
No! You fucking roadkill.
Who...

901
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,363
who kept wide eyes...

902
00:57:20,535 --> 00:57:22,662
when she jaws?

903
00:57:27,842 --> 00:57:28,968
What?

904
00:57:30,044 --> 00:57:33,445
We're on a deadline and there's a
shortage of interns. Bullshit.

905
00:57:33,781 --> 00:57:37,148
I have appointments and I need
someone to carry my Polaroid.

906
00:57:37,418 --> 00:57:39,909
- But we need her, darling.
- Get Foofy.

907
00:57:40,288 --> 00:57:42,552
- I don't know where Foofy is.
- Filing cards for upcoming shoots.

908
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:47,193
You know we only use 5 models
anyway. Are you an idiot? No!

909
00:57:47,395 --> 00:57:48,919
So don't act like one.

910
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:54,331
So here is the trick for
getting free stuff:

911
00:57:54,536 --> 00:57:58,097
You call Louis Vuitton,
call in 4 bags and send back 3.

912
00:57:58,273 --> 00:57:59,900
The next day, call in 2 and
send back 1...

913
00:58:00,108 --> 00:58:02,975
Then call in 5 and send back 4.
When they ask you to cough up...

914
00:58:03,111 --> 00:58:06,512
this luggage you delay and tell
them it's on a shoot in Barbados.

915
00:58:06,915 --> 00:58:09,884
Until you find somebody over
there quit, which is weekly.

916
00:58:10,084 --> 00:58:13,144
And say you just sent it back
to Sheila and fake surprise...

917
00:58:13,388 --> 00:58:15,379
when they say she
left the company.

918
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:17,524
- No way.
- Lf they keep questioning you...

919
00:58:17,725 --> 00:58:22,526
tell them you messengered it over
to Vogue. An editor requested it.

920
00:58:22,964 --> 00:58:26,422
- That's hilarious!
- Works every time. Hello, Louis V.

921
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,538
This soup is delicious.

922
00:58:30,772 --> 00:58:33,969
It beats throwing an
acceptable layout away.

923
00:58:34,175 --> 00:58:37,770
It's such a chaos over there.
This whole Yuri hassle journey...

924
00:58:37,946 --> 00:58:40,847
is insane. I've had enough of
the Cold War when we did...

925
00:58:41,015 --> 00:58:43,108
the "Doctor Jivago" shoot.

926
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:45,783
You got the chicken, too?
So good.

927
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:48,286
But I got the pieard.

928
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:50,615
I don't like playing with bones.

929
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:53,117
I'd bite my tongue on that one.

930
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:56,989
You are so great, Richard.
I'm so glad you work at Skirt.

931
00:58:57,565 --> 00:58:59,965
Some of the people there
are so snobby.

932
00:59:00,535 --> 00:59:04,369
The irony is they were all from
trailer parks and they're all on the mate.

933
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:08,406
I was on the fashion closet and I
heard Olivier and Resin talking...

934
00:59:08,643 --> 00:59:11,908
- what is it with Paul?
- The duke?

935
00:59:13,948 --> 00:59:17,213
What the hell is that?
Is he royalty or something?

936
00:59:17,418 --> 00:59:20,478
Prince Chuck is his cousin or
something. You'd never know, huh?

937
00:59:20,922 --> 00:59:22,913
Why do you think Resin
is going out with him?

938
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:25,685
Do you think she'd be attracted to
some guy in the art department?

939
00:59:26,261 --> 00:59:28,252
But he's really cute...

940
00:59:28,529 --> 00:59:30,121
and funny...

941
00:59:30,298 --> 00:59:31,890
and smart...

942
00:59:35,169 --> 00:59:38,605
Is it an arrow in your ass
from Cupid Squivert?

943
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:43,032
- Yeah.
- But it's hopeless.

944
00:59:43,311 --> 00:59:45,438
Why do you say that?
Things could work out.

945
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:48,947
- You never know a man's heart.
- Yes, I do.

946
00:59:49,183 --> 00:59:51,845
He already told me. He thinks of
me as a "great friend".

947
00:59:52,186 --> 00:59:53,744
The kiss of death!

948
00:59:54,188 --> 00:59:56,019
But then on the other day
he bought me fries.

949
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:58,215
He did? That's a sign.

950
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,923
He's so thoughtful!
I'm smitten.

951
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:06,561
I can tell!
You look green!

952
01:00:06,701 --> 01:00:08,726
Is that your heart broken
to cut chips?

953
01:00:10,271 --> 01:00:12,239
Somebody gets a Pepto!

954
01:00:14,242 --> 01:00:18,702
Spritzer girl?
Where is the art department?

955
01:00:18,913 --> 01:00:21,677
Things should be clearly
marked in these offices.

956
01:00:21,883 --> 01:00:26,047
- It's down there.
- I'm supposed to meet Sebastian.

957
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:30,623
We're going to discuss strategies
for covering up heroine tracks.

958
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:32,892
It's so, so sad!

959
01:00:34,128 --> 01:00:37,859
I know. It's terrible that these
girls do that to themselves.

960
01:00:38,132 --> 01:00:41,659
It causes so much extra work
for us, matching skin tones...

961
01:00:41,836 --> 01:00:43,736
blending palletes.

962
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,103
For arms can be quite
difficult for artists.

963
01:00:49,444 --> 01:00:51,378
I can imagine, good luck!

964
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:58,911
My God, you're sick!

965
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:02,922
I think I got a full
poisoning atrophy.

966
01:01:03,091 --> 01:01:04,752
I'm so sorry.

967
01:01:10,932 --> 01:01:13,833
I'm horrified! I didn't want you
to see me like this.

968
01:01:14,001 --> 01:01:16,060
Don't worry, it happens to everyone.

969
01:01:17,638 --> 01:01:19,469
I'll get some water.

970
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:27,614
Honey, are you all right?
You got it all dripping!

971
01:01:29,117 --> 01:01:33,178
I just chugged in front of Paul.
I'm gonna kill myself.

972
01:01:33,354 --> 01:01:35,219
Don't worry, you'll
lose weight.

973
01:01:35,757 --> 01:01:38,988
Here he comes Remember: Binding
over boyfriend is key.

974
01:01:39,594 --> 01:01:42,324
- Here's some water.
- Great, she'll need some.

975
01:01:42,563 --> 01:01:44,554
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

976
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,869
I have some mints.
I'll leave them here.

977
01:01:53,841 --> 01:01:55,900
I'm okay, I just...

978
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:59,341
- I gotta get back to work.
- No, you go home.

979
01:01:59,847 --> 01:02:01,747
I'll put you in a cab.

980
01:02:07,722 --> 01:02:09,189
Here you go.

981
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:12,692
- She's sick, buddy. Come on!
- What the hell are you doing?

982
01:02:12,894 --> 01:02:15,556
Listen. Go home, cuddle up and
get some rest.

983
01:02:15,763 --> 01:02:18,391
Youve gotta take better care.
You're working too hard.

984
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:21,193
- Come on.
- Thank you so much, Paul.

985
01:02:21,402 --> 01:02:24,371
See you on Monday on Romeo
and Juliette, okay?

986
01:02:25,072 --> 01:02:27,040
Slamming into the windshield
won't win you any...

987
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:29,676
model contract.
This is Resin...

988
01:02:29,877 --> 01:02:33,335
telling you to buckle up because
safety is so in fashion...

989
01:02:35,983 --> 01:02:37,450
What?

990
01:02:38,419 --> 01:02:41,582
I can see the dresses have
arrived for Juliette...

991
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:45,552
beautiful, sensuous, feminine.

992
01:02:46,594 --> 01:02:48,994
Thanks, Dianne,
you are a goddess.

993
01:02:49,263 --> 01:02:54,257
Remember, child: Life is love
and love is life.

994
01:02:57,305 --> 01:03:00,968
Whining, yet charming.
New York subway in the summer.

995
01:03:01,776 --> 01:03:05,542
Meteorology: 112 degrees.

996
01:03:05,913 --> 01:03:07,403
Mood:

997
01:03:07,682 --> 01:03:12,449
- Hassled, hot, hostile, relaxed.
- You're histerical.

998
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,754
I'm used to hanging out with
these people too long.

999
01:03:14,922 --> 01:03:16,219
- It catches on.
- Totally.

1000
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,824
I like to stay away from the
fashion car when I'm not working.

1001
01:03:18,993 --> 01:03:21,484
But it's so incestuous, everybody
is doing everybody else.

1002
01:03:21,629 --> 01:03:23,927
They feel like they don't get to
miss out or something like that.

1003
01:03:24,165 --> 01:03:26,690
- It's pathetic.
- Listen, I gotta get back to work...

1004
01:03:26,868 --> 01:03:30,929
before I get fired, but maybe we
could grab a drink after?

1005
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:34,240
I'd love to, but unfortunately
my day doesn't end here.

1006
01:03:34,442 --> 01:03:36,307
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Great.

1007
01:03:36,577 --> 01:03:39,341
There's this cool band named
Nimbus, playing at the Rebard's...

1008
01:03:39,514 --> 01:03:42,540
it's like some disco, some funk,
interested?

1009
01:03:44,118 --> 01:03:46,678
- Sounds fabulous, I'd love to.
- Cool.

1010
01:03:47,088 --> 01:03:52,253
And definitely bring that
silly putty. I'm all over that.

1011
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:59,424
- Time to take your places!
- I'm not ready yet.

1012
01:03:59,634 --> 01:04:01,499
I'm still in make up.

1013
01:04:01,669 --> 01:04:03,830
See, Chi Chi? I told you.
I don't work like this.

1014
01:04:04,138 --> 01:04:08,234
- Supermodels.
- I know. Attendance!

1015
01:04:09,977 --> 01:04:13,879
I needs standants,
standants, you...

1016
01:04:14,715 --> 01:04:17,411
- spritzer girl.
- Did I hear my name?

1017
01:04:18,886 --> 01:04:21,684
Go stand at the top of the balcony.
I need another.

1018
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:25,954
- I'll do it.
- Go climb at the terrace...

1019
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,651
and stand on the other side
of the balcony rail.

1020
01:04:29,897 --> 01:04:34,698
Pierre, mon cher,
we need a vision.

1021
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:46,407
The year, 1323,
no... 1324.

1022
01:04:47,648 --> 01:04:53,780
The setting: A stony alcove
in the alps of the Capuleto...

1023
01:04:53,955 --> 01:04:57,686
hanging from the rocky, gelid
cliffs of Stratfordshire.

1024
01:04:58,659 --> 01:05:04,655
Meteorology: 50 degrees, with a
post perceptive chilling the air.

1025
01:05:06,934 --> 01:05:12,463
The tempest has fled to bomir
pastures, but its icy kiss lingers.

1026
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:15,769
The mood:

1027
01:05:16,544 --> 01:05:19,012
Unbridled passion...

1028
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,614
a passion that unravels
nature's tiring volcanoes...

1029
01:05:23,851 --> 01:05:28,550
and rumbling earthquakes.
This deeds are acts of gods...

1030
01:05:29,523 --> 01:05:32,890
so is this union.

1031
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:41,600
You need to show Romeo
and Juliette how to pose.

1032
01:05:41,802 --> 01:05:44,134
And you can bet your
sweet ass I will.

1033
01:05:44,772 --> 01:05:48,936
Romeu: You've just been
running in from Mars...

1034
01:05:49,143 --> 01:05:53,204
you're hot and sweaty, but you're
taking some danger.

1035
01:05:53,314 --> 01:05:56,408
Juliette is looking hot, you know
what I'm trying to mean?

1036
01:05:56,584 --> 01:05:59,451
I want the body language to be
a lot more charged, okay?

1037
01:05:59,687 --> 01:06:02,349
So move a lot tight
closer together.

1038
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:06,822
Look into your Juliette's eyes
and..."Oh! Romeo, Romeo"...

1039
01:06:07,128 --> 01:06:10,586
"where art thou", boy.
Come on, open your heart...

1040
01:06:10,831 --> 01:06:13,322
and show some love, some affection
for her. And Juliette...

1041
01:06:13,668 --> 01:06:17,502
you love this man!
Oh! Yes!

1042
01:06:17,672 --> 01:06:20,835
You know he's your knight in
shiny armor. I like that!

1043
01:06:21,008 --> 01:06:23,636
Hold that, I'm gonna take
some Polaroid photos.

1044
01:06:23,911 --> 01:06:28,348
Alex, move your ass. Move your ass.
Out, please. Move!

1045
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:30,176
I like that!

1046
01:06:31,152 --> 01:06:37,284
I love that! Romeo e Juliette!
Romeo loves his Juliette.

1047
01:07:18,199 --> 01:07:20,497
Wait! What the hell
is going on here?

1048
01:07:20,701 --> 01:07:25,229
Resin, you'd better watch out!
We got good models over here.

1049
01:07:25,806 --> 01:07:29,469
I'm not worried about her
taking my job.

1050
01:07:30,044 --> 01:07:32,444
She couldn't even fit into
the samples.

1051
01:07:45,726 --> 01:07:47,921
Your hair looks like
a sheep dog...

1052
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:51,122
and Juliette croaks anyway.

1053
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:57,262
You thought there was something
going on when you saw that big...

1054
01:07:57,538 --> 01:08:01,304
drop of sweat in his hand
like Mission Impossible.

1055
01:08:02,977 --> 01:08:05,571
And Harnesee seemed so hot.

1056
01:08:06,147 --> 01:08:09,344
This is a bit bigger than
breaking into"Quantico".

1057
01:08:09,617 --> 01:08:13,917
- You got the story from Skirt?
- And hot full details!

1058
01:08:14,121 --> 01:08:17,181
Vogue is in Fort Knox!
Nina will be euphoric.

1059
01:08:25,432 --> 01:08:27,798
Man, this neighborhood is dead.

1060
01:08:28,869 --> 01:08:31,360
Soho used to be fly...

1061
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:35,097
but now it's all just sell-out,
sell-out. Sell-out.

1062
01:08:36,076 --> 01:08:40,570
Then Tribeka was the e-hood,
but now it's gone to yuppies...

1063
01:08:40,781 --> 01:08:44,717
with their editting facilities,
waiting 45 minutes in line...

1064
01:08:44,919 --> 01:08:47,183
for lunch at Bubbie's.

1065
01:08:51,192 --> 01:08:56,630
See, it's all about the alphabet
city in the Y2K!

1066
01:08:57,531 --> 01:09:00,125
Paul, what are you doing here?
You remember Alex?

1067
01:09:00,401 --> 01:09:03,893
- I need to talk to you.
- Is something wrong?

1068
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:09,039
I need some liquids.
What's your poison, Joce?

1069
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:11,938
- I'm okay.
- Jocelyn, listen.

1070
01:09:12,379 --> 01:09:14,244
- What's wrong?
- What?

1071
01:09:14,448 --> 01:09:18,145
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

1072
01:09:18,352 --> 01:09:19,876
Hanging out with that...

1073
01:09:20,254 --> 01:09:22,586
grunge poser.
He's beneath you!

1074
01:09:22,723 --> 01:09:25,021
- Why do you care who I hang out with?
- He's beneath you.

1075
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:27,523
Let's not get started people
hanging out with people...

1076
01:09:27,728 --> 01:09:29,525
who is beneath them.

1077
01:09:30,931 --> 01:09:32,990
Are you talking about
my cover girl?

1078
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:35,567
My sexy, gorgeous cover girl?
Just look at her!

1079
01:09:35,736 --> 01:09:38,830
Everyone else wants to sleep
with her or bathe her.

1080
01:09:42,109 --> 01:09:45,306
- Everyone except me.
- And what is that about you?

1081
01:09:46,513 --> 01:09:49,243
How you can see through her?

1082
01:09:51,619 --> 01:09:55,555
- Hey, man you like this music?
- Yeah, I think that's great choose.

1083
01:09:55,856 --> 01:09:58,290
Terrific choose, man! Yeah!

1084
01:09:58,792 --> 01:10:01,056
Take it easy!

1085
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:06,090
You should go for Resin.

1086
01:10:06,233 --> 01:10:08,098
She's looking for you.

1087
01:10:30,925 --> 01:10:33,519
- So, Resin was coming...
- Oh, hi!

1088
01:10:36,897 --> 01:10:39,832
I assume this is finally
my iced cappucino.

1089
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,261
- Yes. And your change.
- Thank you.

1090
01:10:50,444 --> 01:10:52,878
Geez! You really sucked
that puppy back.

1091
01:10:54,315 --> 01:10:56,408
Are you sure this was
skimmed milk?

1092
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:59,279
No, they ran out, so
they used 2 percent.

1093
01:11:03,023 --> 01:11:05,753
- Oh, my God!
- Okay. Come on!

1094
01:11:05,993 --> 01:11:07,620
Oh, my God!

1095
01:11:09,763 --> 01:11:13,631
Come on, baby. Do it.
Do what you have to.

1096
01:11:14,702 --> 01:11:17,102
Okay. Here, sweetie.

1097
01:11:18,305 --> 01:11:22,264
My God! How dare you? I
specifically asked for skimmed...

1098
01:11:22,476 --> 01:11:25,070
and you bring me this fatty,
moogeous cow loyd?

1099
01:11:25,245 --> 01:11:28,510
I'm sorry, I'm so, so sorry,
it's just you're so thin!

1100
01:11:28,682 --> 01:11:30,809
Don't patronize me!

1101
01:11:31,185 --> 01:11:33,619
Get this out of here.
Clean it up now.

1102
01:11:33,821 --> 01:11:35,516
Did you get my husband
on the phone?

1103
01:11:35,756 --> 01:11:37,223
The hotel said he checked out.

1104
01:11:37,424 --> 01:11:38,982
Can't you do anything right?
Call again!

1105
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:41,593
- I tried three times.
- Did you ask for the right name?

1106
01:11:41,762 --> 01:11:43,696
It's. De la Paix, I'm sure
you got it wrong.

1107
01:11:43,897 --> 01:11:45,762
De La Paix
It's not that hard.

1108
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,797
I'm certain that I said it right.

1109
01:11:52,573 --> 01:11:55,736
The hotel specifically said
that Mr. And Mrs. De la Paix...

1110
01:11:55,909 --> 01:11:57,843
checked out.

1111
01:12:11,592 --> 01:12:14,789
Jocelyn, I'm so terribly sorry
for the way I behaved.

1112
01:12:14,995 --> 01:12:17,828
I'm off to London for a week.
It's my father's birthday.

1113
01:12:18,032 --> 01:12:21,798
I'll see you at the Return Bash.
Take care. Paul.

1114
01:12:27,841 --> 01:12:29,274
Thank you, Lester.

1115
01:12:38,185 --> 01:12:42,121
J, London's great, but I'm missing
the New York skyline.

1116
01:12:42,322 --> 01:12:44,051
I hope you're well.
Paul.

1117
01:12:45,993 --> 01:12:48,928
Fax this to Galliano's buttmaker's
boyfriend stylist...

1118
01:12:49,129 --> 01:12:50,528
in Monaco.

1119
01:13:00,774 --> 01:13:03,265
You freak!

1120
01:16:05,459 --> 01:16:07,825
- What are those for?
- We're doing a strain...

1121
01:16:07,995 --> 01:16:11,487
on say gal shalls and
Roxanne gave it 6 pages.

1122
01:16:56,543 --> 01:16:57,805
Come in.

1123
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,814
- I have to talk to you.
- You want another raise?

1124
01:17:03,016 --> 01:17:05,075
I don't get paid, I'm an intern.

1125
01:17:08,121 --> 01:17:10,021
I think I might know
who the Yuri is.

1126
01:17:13,694 --> 01:17:16,720
Let's continue with the
pedicure later.

1127
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,968
Privacy.

1128
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:24,728
Let's talk.

1129
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:33,135
Delicious!

1130
01:17:34,948 --> 01:17:36,575
Good morning!

1131
01:17:37,484 --> 01:17:39,281
Good morning, boys!

1132
01:17:41,521 --> 01:17:44,922
Good morning, good morning,
good morning.

1133
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:50,029
Wow, are we silent!

1134
01:17:57,037 --> 01:17:59,267
- Did somebody die here?
- Yeah.

1135
01:18:05,379 --> 01:18:07,108
Every dog has his day...

1136
01:18:12,886 --> 01:18:16,344
It's obvious that, the way you two
are dressed, you're not here...

1137
01:18:16,556 --> 01:18:19,184
- to talk to me about fashion.
- I'm afraid we're not.

1138
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:23,989
Lieutenant Pathmark, you're under
arrest for the insider trading...

1139
01:18:24,197 --> 01:18:26,529
code 327B, for industrial
espionage.

1140
01:18:27,267 --> 01:18:29,428
I always knew you were
the Yuri.

1141
01:18:29,669 --> 01:18:31,830
You have the right to
remain silent...

1142
01:18:32,906 --> 01:18:38,435
Yes, I did it. I wanted to make sure
these were cross-the-board trends.

1143
01:18:39,045 --> 01:18:42,139
I wanted to make sure if they were
pre-featured, they would come.

1144
01:18:42,382 --> 01:18:44,373
But you want to know
why I did it?

1145
01:18:44,618 --> 01:18:46,643
Because I love fashion.

1146
01:18:47,254 --> 01:18:49,222
Fashion is my life,
or at least...

1147
01:18:49,389 --> 01:18:51,152
a good portion of my day.

1148
01:18:51,324 --> 01:18:54,851
My dream is that every man,
woman and child in America...

1149
01:18:55,162 --> 01:18:57,130
will learn to spell
"Ferragamo" and...

1150
01:18:57,297 --> 01:19:00,323
the 5-year-olds would learn to play
hopscotch on simplicity patterns...

1151
01:19:00,567 --> 01:19:04,367
that words like poliester, leisure
suit and house dress...

1152
01:19:04,704 --> 01:19:07,298
were stricken from
our vocabularies.

1153
01:19:07,774 --> 01:19:11,733
If that's my crime, I'm proud
that I did it.

1154
01:19:12,045 --> 01:19:14,275
And if I have to go to jail...

1155
01:19:14,514 --> 01:19:16,141
so be it.

1156
01:19:16,316 --> 01:19:18,443
As long as I can take
my wardrobe with me.

1157
01:19:20,253 --> 01:19:21,880
Officer...

1158
01:19:24,858 --> 01:19:26,450
go cuff me.

1159
01:19:26,693 --> 01:19:28,957
Your trend-making days are over.

1160
01:19:30,263 --> 01:19:32,561
You can share your precious
fashion advice...

1161
01:19:32,799 --> 01:19:35,290
with the bitches in the slammer.

1162
01:19:35,569 --> 01:19:38,231
I can't wait to tell the girls
in my cell block...

1163
01:19:38,405 --> 01:19:41,169
"Yes! You can make stripes
with floral!"

1164
01:19:41,374 --> 01:19:43,308
They'll be so happy!

1165
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:54,252
People, people!
I have something to say.

1166
01:19:56,456 --> 01:19:59,914
This has been a monumental day,
marking the end...

1167
01:20:00,227 --> 01:20:03,060
of a bitter and tragic era
that cast upon...

1168
01:20:03,263 --> 01:20:05,424
our very headquarters.

1169
01:20:05,866 --> 01:20:08,596
The Yuri has been aprehended!

1170
01:20:08,802 --> 01:20:11,930
And it's thanks to a brilliant
counter-espionage...

1171
01:20:12,172 --> 01:20:16,040
by a very industrious,
pro-active intern.

1172
01:20:16,776 --> 01:20:20,143
So let's raise our booth recall
to Jocelyn.

1173
01:20:20,347 --> 01:20:22,247
- To Jocelyn!
- To Jocelyn!

1174
01:20:22,449 --> 01:20:24,644
- Bravo! Good eye!
- Good girl!

1175
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:29,120
And I have more good news:

1176
01:20:29,489 --> 01:20:31,753
Jocelyn is my meeting assistant...

1177
01:20:31,992 --> 01:20:34,256
she's on staff...

1178
01:20:34,594 --> 01:20:37,995
- and she's our newest little Skirt.
- Congratulations!

1179
01:20:38,198 --> 01:20:39,927
Good luck, sweetheart.

1180
01:20:40,767 --> 01:20:43,327
We were just messengered
the photos from the shooting...

1181
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:46,801
including the Polaroids of you
and Paul, they are adorable!

1182
01:20:57,217 --> 01:21:00,015
I'm just dissapointed that
Paul missed my cue.

1183
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,049
I gotta get the guy out
of my head.

1184
01:21:02,222 --> 01:21:05,123
- I need some mental floss.
- Sweetie, take a thought shower.

1185
01:21:05,325 --> 01:21:07,486
The important is that Editor Chief
knows your triumph...

1186
01:21:07,694 --> 01:21:10,322
- and put you on staff.
- I guess...

1187
01:21:10,497 --> 01:21:13,057
You're going with me to pick up
stationery from the colleaguer.

1188
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:15,393
I've got to get this down to the
messenger center by 6.

1189
01:21:15,569 --> 01:21:18,094
I'm totally going. I'll just do a
quick e-mail and we're off.

1190
01:21:18,338 --> 01:21:19,498
We'll go to "II Cantenore" and...

1191
01:21:19,706 --> 01:21:22,698
and celebrate the end of your life
as an intern slash slave.

1192
01:21:40,493 --> 01:21:42,518
Hold on, I got another
call waiting...

1193
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:50,926
- Cornelia, have you seen Jocelyn?
- Who is Jocelyn?

1194
01:21:56,543 --> 01:21:57,475
Pink!

1195
01:21:58,278 --> 01:22:02,271
The beauty is that he got a bony
campaign with Calvin Klein...

1196
01:22:02,949 --> 01:22:07,409
- She was swallowing everything...
- I'm sorry, have you seen Jocelyn?

1197
01:22:08,154 --> 01:22:10,418
- The intern? Absolutely not!
- Thank you.

1198
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:14,889
Jocelyn, I hear you got to do
the Las Vegas shoot...

1199
01:22:15,061 --> 01:22:18,121
com Roxanne. Am I green
or what?

1200
01:22:18,365 --> 01:22:20,595
Oh, yeah! I'm so excited.

1201
01:22:20,967 --> 01:22:24,061
I see Resin found herself
a new boyfriend.

1202
01:22:25,705 --> 01:22:27,536
Get a room!

1203
01:22:28,441 --> 01:22:30,500
- What about Paul?
- He's over Sabrina's heels.

1204
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:32,678
She swings like Tarzan,
through the vine.

1205
01:22:32,912 --> 01:22:35,176
I don't think that Paul chews that.

1206
01:22:36,149 --> 01:22:38,276
Can you believe Antoniette?

1207
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:41,914
Watching her in predator
mode is better than...

1208
01:22:42,122 --> 01:22:44,818
Shark week on the
Discovery Channel.

1209
01:22:44,991 --> 01:22:47,186
- Hello, whores!
- There is special China Chow...

1210
01:22:47,394 --> 01:22:50,420
He' s probably giving some hints on
how to remain in the spotlight...

1211
01:22:50,664 --> 01:22:52,996
without actually doing anything.

1212
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:56,033
- I gotta take notes.
- I think I'll follow you.

1213
01:22:56,936 --> 01:22:58,904
How are you doing, sweetie?

1214
01:22:59,205 --> 01:23:00,763
I don't know.

1215
01:23:01,307 --> 01:23:03,502
Kind of tired, I don't
feel so well.

1216
01:23:03,643 --> 01:23:05,702
I think I'll just go home and
get some sleep.

1217
01:23:05,945 --> 01:23:08,470
Have a drink of bourbon
it hits the head for 15 hours.

1218
01:23:08,682 --> 01:23:11,310
You'll be a million times better.
I'll walk you to the door.

1219
01:23:14,821 --> 01:23:18,484
I told her: You can have your Gucci
socks you can have your fancy title...

1220
01:23:18,725 --> 01:23:22,388
but really you're nothing but a
short fat Jackie O' wannabe...

1221
01:23:22,595 --> 01:23:24,460
with hideous feet.

1222
01:23:24,964 --> 01:23:26,864
There's good news and
there's bad news.

1223
01:23:27,033 --> 01:23:29,524
The good news is they gave
her a nice title...

1224
01:23:29,736 --> 01:23:32,864
Director of Special Projects.
The bad news is...

1225
01:23:33,139 --> 01:23:37,200
- there are no special projects.
- Excuse me, I have to...

1226
01:23:37,377 --> 01:23:40,369
Where are you going?
Let's go get a drink.

1227
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:42,980
No, Antoniette, not tonight.

1228
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:56,590
No hard feelings, right?

1229
01:23:57,864 --> 01:24:01,300
No, of course not. Look!
You make a perfect couple.

1230
01:24:01,668 --> 01:24:04,694
I can only imagine all those
philosofical conversations...

1231
01:24:04,904 --> 01:24:07,338
you would enjoy
for years to come.

1232
01:24:10,143 --> 01:24:12,907
Richard, please tell me
you've seen Jocelyn!

1233
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:15,206
She just left, right behind
the Editor Chief.

1234
01:24:15,448 --> 01:24:17,211
- She's in Françoise.
- Right! Good!

1235
01:24:24,524 --> 01:24:26,924
Why did you leave? I haven't
seen all night.

1236
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,720
Well, I wasn't having very
much fun, I guess.

1237
01:24:31,765 --> 01:24:34,131
- Why?
- I realized that...

1238
01:24:34,334 --> 01:24:36,097
It doesn't matter.

1239
01:24:36,336 --> 01:24:39,567
Resin and I have split up
I didn't love her.

1240
01:24:40,406 --> 01:24:43,068
And I noticed another blonde
has gone in her place.

1241
01:24:43,409 --> 01:24:46,242
Antoniette? Are you insane?
She's a nightmare.

1242
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:48,811
She means nothing to me.
I'm standing here with you...

1243
01:24:48,982 --> 01:24:51,041
leaving those
phoneys behind me...

1244
01:24:51,284 --> 01:24:53,115
cause I'm crazy about you.

1245
01:24:54,521 --> 01:24:55,988
- You are?
- Yes

1246
01:24:58,324 --> 01:25:00,451
But I could never be
like them.

1247
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:03,720
You don't have to be. You and I
both know how absurd it is.

1248
01:25:04,564 --> 01:25:08,193
You don't understand I love the
fact you're not obsessed with it.

1249
01:25:08,635 --> 01:25:11,604
I'm not into that bullshit, I don't
know what I was thinking before

1250
01:25:12,505 --> 01:25:15,269
All that glamour fades fast...

1251
01:25:15,441 --> 01:25:17,500
and when it's gone,
there is nothing.

1252
01:25:18,611 --> 01:25:22,479
I've seen who you've been with.
How could I compete with Resin.

1253
01:25:22,749 --> 01:25:25,115
- She is gorgeous!
- She is not gorgeous!

1254
01:25:26,019 --> 01:25:29,113
I've been so stupid.
She doesn't like French fries.

1255
01:25:29,289 --> 01:25:31,814
She doesn't play with that
silly putty all day long...

1256
01:25:32,058 --> 01:25:34,686
she doesn't make me laugh
and you know?

1257
01:25:34,928 --> 01:25:37,396
She would never be clever
enough to find Yuri.

1258
01:25:38,431 --> 01:25:41,093
- How do you know about that?
- Richard e-mailed me...

1259
01:25:41,334 --> 01:25:43,325
the whole story.
Listen...

1260
01:25:43,703 --> 01:25:45,364
- Listen to me.
- I...

1261
01:25:45,705 --> 01:25:47,036
- Listen to me, please.
- No, it's ok.

1262
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,765
Jocelyn, listen, you are...

1263
01:25:49,976 --> 01:25:52,308
an updated version of the
Crocked Express...

1264
01:25:52,579 --> 01:25:55,241
you are the short line
of the DMD...

1265
01:25:55,481 --> 01:25:58,075
you are a walk around
New York in the fall...

1266
01:25:58,318 --> 01:26:03,779
You are funny and fun
and exciting and kind...

1267
01:26:05,425 --> 01:26:09,759
and beautiful. And when I went
to England I missed you.

1268
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:12,664
I missed you.

1269
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:16,726
I missed you so much!

1270
01:26:29,849 --> 01:26:35,446
Jocelyn, you have the
whole world inside you.

1271
01:27:08,755 --> 01:27:10,848
Hi, this is Jocelyn Bennet,
photo editor of Skirt magazine.

1272
01:27:11,024 --> 01:27:12,958
There are lots of beautiful
things to see in NY...

1273
01:27:13,092 --> 01:27:15,856
but your view can be ruined. If
you struck the head of your cab.

1274
01:27:16,029 --> 01:27:17,997
So buckle up!

1275
01:27:18,097 --> 01:27:19,587
There are lots of amazing things
that will happen in your life...

1276
01:27:19,799 --> 01:27:21,699
and you won't wanna miss.

1277
01:27:22,268 --> 01:27:24,361
And this is the kitchen.

1278
01:27:24,971 --> 01:27:26,768
Here is our water supply.

1279
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,667
Most of our editors have
a preference like...

1280
01:27:28,841 --> 01:27:31,036
Chi Chi Chemise is
into Velvet...

1281
01:27:31,277 --> 01:27:34,303
Cornelia Crisp gets so upset
if there is no more "Pelegrino".

1282
01:27:36,249 --> 01:27:38,183
Here is the design studio...

1283
01:27:39,085 --> 01:27:41,553
That is Jocelyn Bennett,
the senior photo editor...

1284
01:27:41,788 --> 01:27:43,255
She is so nice!

1285
01:27:43,456 --> 01:27:44,946
Hey, Charlotte.

1286
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:54,256
That was Paul, he used to work
here, now he is a famous artist.

1287
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,968
He shows in Soho and stuff.
So ripe!

1288
01:27:57,203 --> 01:27:59,467
He and Jocelyn are getting
married next month.

1289
01:27:59,672 --> 01:28:01,833
Yoji Yamamoto is
doing her dress.

1290
01:28:02,141 --> 01:28:04,166
They are so cool!
I love them!

1291
01:28:12,618 --> 01:28:14,643
Oh! Get a room!

1292
01:28:16,322 --> 01:28:18,620
Can I ask you something?
What's with the angry?

1293
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:25,720
I'm angry too!

1294
