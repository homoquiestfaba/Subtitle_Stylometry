1
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:56,682
THE DEAL

2
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:15,451
Honey... I need your help...

3
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:23,501
Honey. Help me, please.

4
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,463
Help me, please.

5
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:31,467
No. Baby! Baby.

6
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,469
It's okay. It's okay.

7
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:34,970
Here, I'll take you to a hospital.

8
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,515
It's okay. Here.

9
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:40,017
Come on, baby. There. Get in.

10
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,522
I'm here, baby. It's okay.

11
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,552
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

12
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:18,556
It's okay. Look, it's the police.

13
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,015
Don't worry,

14
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,018
everything's gonna be okay.
Officer!

15
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:31,026
So, you're saying
it was a break-in?

16
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,319
Yes, right.

17
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,322
Can I go with her, please?

18
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,075
Sure, after a few more questions.

19
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,744
You said they broke in
in the afternoon.

20
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,330
Yes. No. First, a girl came by.

21
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,000
Curly blond hair,
she was wearing a jacket,

22
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,043
and said that she was
in a car accident,

23
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,044
and that there was no signal.

24
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,630
There was signal at our house,
so she came in, ate something,

25
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,257
and we waited for her mother
to pick her up.

26
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:54,550
Her mother.

27
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,552
Yes, at least that's what she said.

28
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:59,096
But one thing led to another--

29
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,351
I'm sorry, what do you mean
one thing lead to another?

30
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,566
Can I go with my wife now?

31
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,652
Yo! The car's documents.

32
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,862
Last name?

33
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,572
Riscal. Mr. Riscal.

34
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:17,573
Riscal.

35
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,116
-Where are you taking her?
-Don't worry.

36
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,576
She will be okay.

37
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,244
She's okay. She's stable.

38
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,579
We will keep you informed,

39
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:27,082
but you need to come
to the police station.

40
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,083
Who? Me?

41
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,627
Please.

42
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,087
Please.

43
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,633
Come with us.

44
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,101
24 HOURS EARLIER

45
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,646
<i>No, I want her out.</i>

46
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,106
She can't have a say.

47
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,108
<i>Okay, anything else?</i>

48
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,277
I want to be the majority shareholder.

49
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,155
I want full control over the Board.

50
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,115
And most importantly,

51
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,117
I want her to be forced to attend

52
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,619
whenever I call her.

53
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,080
I want her to look me in the eye
when I have something to say.

54
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,581
That's going to be challenging.

55
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,124
<i>I don't give a fuck.</i>

56
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,335
<i>You're my lawyer</i>
and these are my terms.

57
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,087
If that's what you want--

58
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,297
<i>Can she decline?</i>

59
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:19,468
Borja, you two spent a decade
building the company.

60
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,637
She should have considered
that before... Fuck it.

61
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,555
<i>Borja, listen. Cat is very smart.</i>

62
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,849
Since she came to the firm
with her father

63
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,643
<i>and stayed with us in the office,</i>

64
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,061
<i>she never said a word,</i>

65
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,146
but I'm sure she perfectly understood

66
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,650
every time we talked about
mergers and acquisitions.

67
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,777
<i>Her father never hid</i>
anything from her.

68
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,154
On the contrary,
he wanted her to be prepared

69
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,656
for the future.

70
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:41,657
I know.

71
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,328
So while I review these bylaws,

72
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,123
you try to work it out calmly.

73
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:53,168
Dammit. Seven years thrown away.

74
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,379
<i>We will use that in our lawsuit.</i>

75
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:59,425
<i>Look, if she declines our offer,</i>
we will file for divorce.

76
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,554
We will allege breach of trust
and betrayal of vows,

77
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,181
<i>saying that it all occurred</i>
behind your back

78
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:10,394
while you worked relentlessly
trying to establish the company.

79
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:12,354
There's no way a judge
won't find an aggravating factor

80
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:16,233
when the relationship between you
is also proven.

81
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:21,697
We will threaten her with damaging
her reputation on social media

82
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:22,948
<i>and everywhere else.</i>

83
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,199
Will it work?

84
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,744
<i>Of course. I'm sure it will.</i>

85
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,205
I'm only worried about
the eighth clause of the deal.

86
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,709
It could backfire in trial, Borja.

87
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,712
It's unusual. It's... excessive.

88
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,214
We need something big

89
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,426
to make sense of your state of mind.

90
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,511
So, do you have any proof
or something?

91
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,264
Sure. Hold on.

92
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:52,770
I will send you some pictures.
Don't hang up.

93
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,780
They're on their way.

94
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,950
Yes, I see them.

95
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,244
Oh, shit.

96
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,455
You full-on caught her, man.

97
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,291
One more thing,
thank you for choosing me.

98
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,252
No. No, it's nothing.

99
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:21,799
Listen to me...
don't lose your head, alright?

100
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,760
<i>Don't get swept up by your emotions</i>
and end up doing something

101
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,929
<i>you might regret</i>
for the rest of your life.

102
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,265
No, I won't. I will call you
when everything is over.

103
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,310
Fine. Bye, man.

104
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,322
Do you know who she is?

105
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:55,124
Yes. She's my wife.

106
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,793
With someone I know.

107
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,295
We found these in your house,
along with--

108
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,589
-So?
-Let me finish.

109
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,842
Right. I'm sorry.

110
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,636
Did you file for divorce?

111
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,307
These pictures made you
take action?

112
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,309
I sent them to my lawyer
for advice.

113
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,312
Answer the question.

114
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,815
Not without my lawyer.

115
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,651
Tell me what happened last night.

116
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,822
Well--

117
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,824
Hey there.

118
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,325
<i>What's up, man?</i>

119
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,326
<i>You're on your way, right?</i>

120
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,371
Yeah, I just made a stop.
Do you need anything?

121
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,624
Not at all.
There's plenty of everything.

122
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,336
Are you okay?

123
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,548
Yes, of course. Why?

124
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,049
<i>I don't know.</i>
It's your anniversary, right?

125
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,843
I have nothing to do with it.

126
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,345
<i>You're my best pal, aren't you?</i>

127
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,348
I mean... this should be
between you two.

128
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,850
She's on a trip.

129
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,351
<i>On your anniversary?</i>

130
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,354
Yes. You know, duty calls.

131
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,315
-So, what did you get her?
-What?

132
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,859
For a present,
what did you get her?

133
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,862
Honestly, I didn't find
anything she would like.

134
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,865
But maybe you can help me
to find her something.

135
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:14,578
You know her almost
as well as I do. Huh?

136
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,412
Sure.

137
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,374
We will find something.
Don't you worry.

138
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,377
Okay. One more thing.

139
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,838
<i>I'm glad you're coming this weekend.</i>

140
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,383
We'll have a good time.
I needed a weekend with friends.

141
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,676
<i>You know.</i>

142
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,720
In the end, it's always
only you and me.

143
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,556
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

144
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,892
Good, drive safely.

145
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,418
You're here.

146
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,420
Sure, where else would I be?

147
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,964
Come here.

148
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,135
Oh! You cooked.

149
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,471
I did. Smell.

150
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,476
Look at this.

151
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,438
Tasty, right?

152
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,482
It's been a while since
you last cooked for me.

153
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,944
Can I take a shower before dinner?

154
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,989
Of course. Today's your day.

155
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:36,994
It's so good. Delicious.

156
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,963
Margaux '59.

157
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,466
Weren't we keeping it
for a special occasion?

158
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,969
We're always keeping things
for special occasions.

159
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:58,015
What better occasion than
celebrating our marriage?

160
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:06,148
Here. Also, you said you wanted
to explore the limits, right?

161
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:10,527
-Me?
-Yes. You.

162
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:21,538
To us. To you.

163
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,054
Let me taste it.

164
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,117
The doorbell.

165
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,129
Are you expecting anyone?

166
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:58,135
Could it be flowers
or an anniversary gift?

167
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,553
What are you doing here?

168
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,639
-Weren't you on a trip?
-A trip?

169
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,271
Marcos, it's nice to see you.

170
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,606
What a surprise, come in.
Come in.

171
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:17,112
-Honey!
-Marcos, you're here!

172
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,113
Please, come in.

173
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,115
Cat was about to take a shower.

174
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,116
Dinner is ready.

175
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,660
I opened a wonderful wine.
You will like it.

176
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,163
Terrific.

177
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,623
Help yourself. I'm coming.

178
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,127
Can you explain me
why you invited Marcos?

179
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,088
Well, I told you today
I was feeling spontaneous.

180
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,381
And you said you liked that.

181
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:41,178
Relax, we will have fun.
You'll see.

182
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,358
Dear Lord, you're a great cook, bud.

183
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,985
Fuck.

184
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,655
I think I overate.

185
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,450
I'm glad. Bud.

186
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,661
Actually, you've always
been a great cook.

187
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,206
I still don't know what the hell
I'm doing here, but--

188
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,209
After this, I won't complain, right?

189
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,669
To us, guys.

190
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,213
We're glad you're here.

191
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,381
Yes. That's true.

192
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:25,222
To my best, best, best,
best friend.

193
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,231
Seven years later, here we are.
The three of us.

194
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,234
It seems like it was yesterday,
the biggest drinking night ever.

195
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,738
And here we are. The three of us.

196
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,203
It was a lovely wedding.

197
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,207
I almost forgot.
There's one more thing.

198
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,209
I can't eat anything else.
Or I might throw up.

199
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,253
Trust me, you will love this.

200
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,758
Please, find a way to leave, okay?

201
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,219
I don't know what's going on,
but this is awkward,

202
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:07,264
so find an excuse to leave.

203
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,853
Let's see what the chef prepared.

204
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,730
Voilà!

205
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,233
-What's this?
-Dessert.

206
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:22,237
This is for you.
And this one is yours.

207
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,281
Enjoy, pal.

208
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,749
Non-disclosure agreement.
What is it for?

209
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,377
Are you creating a new company or--

210
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,257
This motherfucker is funny.

211
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,259
Always thinking of business, huh?

212
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,303
I don't understand
what the fuck is this.

213
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:51,808
It's something special.
To my most special persons.

214
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:56,271
No, it's not that. This has
nothing to do with business.

215
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,772
This is about us.

216
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:01,276
It is. But it's not.

217
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,819
But it is.

218
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,282
It's about you. About all of us.

219
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,284
And our business.

220
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,084
Well, I better get going, or--

221
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,296
-It's too late for that, you moron.
-Is it?

222
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,298
This is between you two,
I'm leaving.

223
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,345
This actually concerns you.

224
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,513
Stop pretending, I know it all.

225
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,266
I've seen your photographs,
everything.

226
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,310
How can you be so cynical?

227
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,853
Are you losing it or what?

228
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,814
-Cynical me?
-Yes, you.

229
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,817
What's this? The divorce papers?

230
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,987
No. No, no, it's--

231
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,823
It's a deal, he wants to buy me out.

232
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,367
What?

233
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,662
Let's call it a practical divorce.

234
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,288
As set forth herein,

235
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,333
I'll gain control
of your shares and the company.

236
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,962
And listen, I'm paying you
enough money so you can do

237
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,839
whatever you want,
wherever you want to do it.

238
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,342
That way, I can leave you behind,
and keep my company.

239
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,303
Down here, on Earth,
I will do that.

240
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,347
A campaign to rename the brand.

241
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,848
You will fade out gradually.

242
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,809
No complications, no drama,
nothing.

243
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,645
You two can stop hiding like rats.

244
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,356
And I can continue working
on the company I built.

245
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,857
That we both built.

246
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,193
Look, you lost
the right to say that

247
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,861
the moment you started
fucking with my best pal.

248
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,614
One thing has nothing to do
with the other.

249
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,033
You're playing the victim now?

250
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:35,370
I'm the victim here. Understood?

251
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,831
And let me tell you this,
be smart.

252
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,375
Any other man,
under these circumstances,

253
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,378
wouldn't even give you
half the money I'm offering.

254
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,839
-Don't play the fucking victim.
-Take it easy, okay?

255
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,382
-Shut up.
-I can't speak?

256
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,176
Then what the fuck am I doing here?
Huh? Tell me.

257
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,439
I want you two to look me in the eye.

258
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,609
After all of this, after so long,

259
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,070
and so much bullshit and lies,

260
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,698
I'm trying to be the bigger man.

261
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,159
Okay. I'll get going, or--

262
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,410
Are you leaving her alone?

263
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,537
You fucked her all this time,
and now you're leaving her?

264
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,958
I'm freaking out
about all of this too!

265
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,971
Was there someone else
when all of this happened?

266
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,433
Um... yes. Marcos, a friend.

267
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,477
Marcos, right.

268
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,647
Mr. Riscal, you better cooperate
and don't lie to me.

269
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,942
Listen, lady.
I'm telling the truth.

270
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:51,154
Your house was intact.
There were no sings of a break-in.

271
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,656
We only found
your wife's suitcase.

272
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,118
What about Marcos?

273
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,995
<i>What do you want me to tell you?</i>

274
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,999
-I did wrong.
-So wrong.

275
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,002
Look...

276
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,717
For some reason, at some point

277
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,471
in life you forgot about me,
you replaced me.

278
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,015
Do you realize that much?

279
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,478
Maybe you didn't notice,
but all the energy that we had,

280
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,731
all the energy between us,
you poured it all on our company.

281
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,693
You and I became nothing
but a business.

282
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,779
And you forgot about me.

283
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:37,534
You're a man of success.
You don't like failure.

284
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,037
That's why I never thought
this would happen.

285
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:45,041
I thought we could survive
this, do you hear me?

286
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,461
All of a sudden, those trips started.

287
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,505
What first were getaway trips,

288
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,674
suddenly became business trips.

289
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,551
Longer and longer and longer trips,

290
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,010
and we were so fucked up.

291
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,013
As fucked up as everybody else.

292
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,516
We became the common denominator.

293
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,018
All the lies and the betrayal,
and that sort of things,

294
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,522
and this fucking house where
I thought we would finally be alone,

295
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:11,025
just you and me,
and get back what we had,

296
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:15,071
but it turned out that I
was left all alone. Do you realize?

297
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:25,081
You're good, huh? No. I don't know
why but I don't believe you.

298
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:30,086
Oh. Right. Wait. Look at this.

299
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,593
No, no, wait. Look.

300
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,096
Okay, stop it now.

301
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,562
You will sign the papers, right?

302
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:51,107
Is that what you want?
Will that really make you happy?

303
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,068
I don't know what the fuck
is going to make me happy now.

304
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,529
But you leave me no choice.

305
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,114
Okay.

306
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,118
Are you sure?

307
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,130
Let's see.

308
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,139
I'm really sorry. Forgive me.

309
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,559
Well, I don't give a fuck now.

310
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:30,104
Make sure your boyfriend
signs the NDA

311
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:33,107
and we'll be done
with the negotiation.

312
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,609
You can take care of that.

313
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,611
You can tell him and say goodbye,

314
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,113
because I will keep seeing him.

315
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,451
I think you misread this.

316
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,165
The deal is invalid
if he doesn't sign.

317
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,168
So you better go and try
to convince him.

318
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,838
It won't be that difficult, huh?

319
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,674
One more thing.

320
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,135
Our lawyer...
isn't ours anymore.

321
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,179
He's my lawyer.

322
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,935
You know for who I'm really sorry?

323
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,146
Not me, I'm better than ever.

324
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:16,109
And I don't deserve that you say
for that bastard out there.

325
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,197
No. For me.
I'm sorry for me.

326
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,157
For both of us, actually.

327
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,703
Because... we lost everything
we were.

328
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,664
We got lost in this shit.

329
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:30,873
And yes, I got swept up.

330
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,669
You're really good.

331
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,713
Did you notice just now?

332
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,174
Hey, did you read
the last clause of the deal?

333
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,218
Take a look.

334
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,224
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

335
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,408
Hey girl.
Got available lots.

336
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,118
Do you want me to park it for you?

337
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:09,454
Is that the rate?

338
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,497
PUBLIC PARKING

339
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,709
For a beautiful woman like you,
it's free.

340
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,754
Oh, I see. That's cute.

341
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,424
Where are you from?

342
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:25,678
It's been a tough day, darling,
I'm not in the mood for this bullshit.

343
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,264
Hey! Whoa, whoa!

344
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:31,893
You're short-tempered, huh?
I see you.

345
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,771
Are you from Cuba?

346
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,234
I'm from wherever I want.

347
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,238
Should I call the cops or what?

348
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,283
That accent is turning me on,
to be honest.

349
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:57,752
Why don't you just... let me?

350
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,796
Let you what?

351
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,426
<i>You shitface!</i>

352
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,303
<i> How dare you</i>
do something like that?

353
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,764
<i>You know I trusted you.</i>

354
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:10,765
<i>How much is he paying you?</i>

355
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,767
<i>Look, Cat, first</i>
you need to calm down.

356
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:16,270
Shut up! You know I can
sue you for this, right?

357
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,481
You have to understand,
I'm only doing my job.

358
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,525
You know I'm very patient

359
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,777
to fuck someone's life
and I can sue you for this?

360
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:26,030
Right now, I'm stuck in the middle
of the separation of two persons

361
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,283
I'm truly and personally fond of.

362
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,786
I need you to understand
where I'm standing, that's all.

363
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,788
My father thought of you
as a friend.

364
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,249
I wish he was alive
to see you as the snake you are.

365
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,305
Here.

366
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,645
So, what were you thinking?

367
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,816
I mean, what's the logic

368
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,360
behind ending up fucking
my wife?

369
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,322
Did you forget
who brought you to Mexico?

370
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,868
Who paid for your house?
Who gave you everything?

371
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,370
How long have we known each other?
Is it ten years now?

372
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,831
Look at me.
Look at me, motherfucker.

373
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,876
Do you like her that much?

374
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:23,838
Dear Lord.

375
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,883
I've been laughing at you
for weeks.

376
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,358
Well, these things happen

377
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,027
when you try to have
an open relationship, right?

378
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,862
It's my turn.

379
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,364
So, I trust my wife,
I have an open relationship,

380
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,867
-and then you fuck her?
-Will you let me talk or what?

381
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:53,868
Not if you're going to lie.

382
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,870
I'm trying to explain it to you, dude.

383
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,872
Are you aware that you've been
lying to me for years?

384
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,916
That's it. Enough.

385
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,701
I told you I want to understand you.
Marcos, I'm serious.

386
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,703
I want to understand
what's on your mind

387
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,914
to want to fuck my wife.

388
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:43,209
I'm not like you, dude. In life.

389
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:45,753
Look, since I first met you
I've seen you get rich,

390
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,213
I've seen you succeed,

391
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:50,216
I've seen you buy
20 houses like this.

392
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:51,717
Being with every woman
you've desired

393
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,719
and fallen in love with them.

394
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,264
I don't know what the fuck you mean.
I just don't understand.

395
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,767
You even have a fucking river,
a forest, you got--

396
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,731
You know what's going on.

397
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,276
You know what you want.

398
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,237
You don't want to be
part of my life.

399
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,281
You want to live my life.

400
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,784
And there's no way, kid.

401
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:21,539
You really pushed yourselves
so the three of us would live a lie.

402
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,459
But I don't understand.
You didn't need anything.

403
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,254
I even asked you a million times
to be part of my business.

404
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:29,755
But you never wanted.

405
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,257
You've never wanted
any responsibilities.

406
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:34,260
Responsibilities?
What responsibilities do you have?

407
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,762
Me? That's my problem.

408
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,973
But I don't fuck no one's life
with them,

409
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,766
let alone the lives of those I love.

410
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,978
And listen closely,
when you want something

411
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,272
you need the balls

412
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:49,775
to grab them tightly
and make decisions.

413
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:53,779
Grow a pair, kid.
That's how I got all of this.

414
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:57,950
But no, not you...
you'd rather stay in the shadows.

415
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:03,080
Back there, in a corner,
waiting for the right time to...

416
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:06,792
fuck my wife. That's you, Marcos.

417
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,836
And one more thing.

418
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:13,799
I could have expected this from her.
But from my best friend?

419
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,343
From you?

420
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,847
You have no excuses. None.

421
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:24,310
You didn't even have the balls
to tell me.

422
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:25,311
Well, you're right.

423
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:28,314
It was never my plan
to tell you, or hurt you.

424
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,816
But leave her out of this,
she doesn't deserve it.

425
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,319
You abandoned her. What,
you don't remember that either?

426
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,529
I only want you to sign
those papers

427
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:36,822
and go to hell.

428
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:37,823
-Really?
-Yes.

429
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,868
Fantastic. We're leaving.

430
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,874
The agreement.

431
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,876
Thank you.

432
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,383
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

433
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,343
Do you mind?

434
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,845
If you breach your part
of the agreement,

435
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,098
it will lose validity.

436
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,643
And I assure you that in less
than 24 hours,

437
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,854
those pictures will be delivered
to all of the media.

438
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,356
You wouldn't dare, Borja.

439
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:17,363
You're nuts if you think
we're going to do that.

440
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,615
You're pissed? Fine,
I get it, you're pissed.

441
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,867
But what else do you want?

442
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,411
Leave.

443
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,373
Borja.

444
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:28,916
Okay, do it. I dare you.

445
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,668
But it will be the last thing
you do, bastard.

446
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,421
You're brave all of a sudden
in front of the lady--

447
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,924
Do it. Do it! And I'll send you
to prison for five years.

448
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,384
If you survive, of course.

449
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:40,928
Stop it. Stop it. Enough!

450
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,390
Listen.

451
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,392
Keep your end of the deal,

452
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:49,395
or I'll haunt you
with all my might.

453
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:49,895
Borja...

454
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,939
No, no. Please.

455
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,882
-Hi.
-Hey.

456
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,425
Listen, I need help.

457
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,928
I was in an car accident
and there's no signal.

458
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,930
I have to call my family
and tell them that I'm okay.

459
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:28,642
My car won't start and I don't know
what's wrong with my phone.

460
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,935
There's no signal, and--

461
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,062
I'm sorry,
but I'm having a bad day.

462
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,981
Welcome to the club.

463
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,942
Maybe I can lend you
my phone and you can try.

464
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,194
Please, come in.

465
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,988
Yes, thank you.

466
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,453
He won't stop
until he gets what he wants.

467
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:50,456
He's being a fucking douchebag.
That's what he is doing.

468
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:51,957
And I'm not playing along.

469
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,168
There's no other choice.

470
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,128
I barely recognize you, Cat.

471
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,963
We're in this together,
don't forget it.

472
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:58,964
Things turned out this way
because of both of us.

473
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,508
-You think I don't know?
-Shh.

474
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:03,135
I understand that,
but I won't play his game.

475
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,512
Shut up.

476
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,515
Let's go back in.

477
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:10,768
There must be another way.

478
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,479
-There's not.
-Didn't you read the fucking agreement?

479
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:15,731
Let's go,
we'll talk to our lawyers

480
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:16,857
and try to fix all of this.

481
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,817
Do you really think that
it can be fixed like that?

482
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:22,488
I don't know. But this is the worst
place to talk about it.

483
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,823
And it's hard to understand
how he can be so sick

484
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:25,491
to add that clause.

485
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:26,992
But what if the pictures
come to light?

486
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,495
-They won't.
-What if they do?

487
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:33,541
Yes, mom. Yes, yes. No.
I'm fine.

488
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:38,546
Okay. Good.
Yes, I'll wait here.

489
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,756
What's your address?

490
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,511
-65 Camino de la Arboleda.
-65 Camino de la Arboleda.

491
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,221
The agreement clearly stipulates

492
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:50,015
that if he breaches it,
he has to give up everything.

493
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,518
And to be honest,
I doubt he'd want to lose it all.

494
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,727
Let's find a way--

495
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,521
-To what, refute those pictures?
-Yeah.

496
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:58,524
He's filing for divorce,
and this shit will come out in court.

497
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:02,069
Look. Stop, stop it.
You're not alone, okay?

498
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:08,075
What is it? I know that face.

499
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,829
We have to do it.

500
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,333
Are you serious?

501
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,044
You're going to let him
humiliate you like that?

502
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,297
Yes, yes.

503
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:27,052
Okay. No, don't worry.
I'm fine. Really.

504
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,638
Yes, I got help. Yeah.

505
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,018
Yes.

506
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,771
Again, yes.

507
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:45,112
Yeah. I'm okay, seriously.
A man helped me.

508
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,293
WHERE ARE YOU?
I NEED YOUR HELP.

509
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,142
Wait, wait, wait.

510
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,603
Where's my phone?

511
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,104
I think it's in my pants.

512
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,608
-Need a hand?
-No, no. Don't move. Don't move.

513
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,276
Sure?

514
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,613
I'm not doing anything.

515
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:33,160
I said, don't... move.

516
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,677
It's ringing, it's ringing.
Move. Move, please.

517
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:01,647
Cotiti. I'm doing nothing.
Count on me.

518
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:02,648
Doing nothing?

519
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,650
I'm on my way, don't worry.

520
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,694
-Get out.
-Whoa! Hey.

521
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,666
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

522
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:24,712
I was trying to get signal.
But... no luck.

523
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,173
It's definitely dead. Oh well!

524
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,718
May it rest in peace.

525
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,179
You know, today is
one of those days

526
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,224
when I would've been better off
not getting out of bed.

527
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,727
I know what you mean.

528
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:47,192
Do you know any spots nearby
where I can wait or have a drink?

529
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,194
If you want,
I can take a look at your car.

530
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,363
I know a little about that.
I'm not an expert but...

531
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:53,699
-No. No, it's not necessary.
-I can help.

532
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:56,869
My mom is coming
and I don't want to bother.

533
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,246
-It's nothing. Seriously.
-No.

534
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:04,001
Don't. Um, sorry.
I'm sure you're a busy man.

535
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,212
Maybe I should wait outside.

536
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,714
It's no big deal.

537
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:12,259
I insist. I need the fresh air.
Come on.

538
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,280
Alright, I'll do it.

539
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,742
But I'm giving up
so much too, okay?

540
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:38,911
So, I want to make this
very clear.

541
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,288
You're above anything else.

542
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:44,750
It's a deal.
That's what they're made for.

543
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,752
Do you think this will end here?

544
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:49,296
No, of course not.
He won't let us live in peace.

545
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:50,964
But if I let him humiliate me
this way,

546
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,467
I will find a way
to defend myself.

547
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:57,304
Otherwise, I'm only going
to feel the burden of guilt.

548
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,311
Are you sure?

549
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:10,317
What choice do we have? Hm?

550
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:17,783
Whatever, no matter what we do,
he won't leave us alone.

551
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:19,326
Yeah.

552
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,330
We need to find the way
to get rid of him.

553
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:36,301
Weird. It's okay when you start it.
But then something goes wrong.

554
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,970
What can I do?

555
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:42,808
Nothing. It must be the engine
or the belt. Something like that.

556
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,853
I don't know anything about this.

557
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,648
It's not-- It's not a big deal.

558
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,608
Thank you.

559
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,860
I didn't do anything.

560
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,863
Well, at least you tried.

561
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,824
Did you call a tow truck?

562
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,827
Not yet. I want to wait
until they pick me up.

563
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:05,831
But don't worry.

564
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:07,833
I'll wait here.

565
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,835
Thank you for everything.

566
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:13,171
You can wait inside if you like.

567
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:16,383
My mom won't take long.

568
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,177
You gave her my address.

569
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,847
She will look for you there.
And we'll have to come to pick you up.

570
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:24,683
Oh, right.

571
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:28,854
You're absolutely right.
I'm a mess.

572
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:33,901
Um, would you tell her
I'm waiting here?

573
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,864
Or maybe... can I go with you?

574
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:41,867
Yes, of course. Let's go.

575
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,373
Borja!

576
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,876
-Where could he be?
-Catching some fresh air maybe.

577
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:54,379
-This is fucking crazy.
-It is. Think it through.

578
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,923
Yes.

579
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,884
We're going to say
that it was in self defense

580
00:36:58,926 --> 00:36:59,885
and they will believe us.

581
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:03,388
Desperate situations call
for desperate measures.

582
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,890
You're confident, right?

583
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:05,891
Who cares?

584
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:07,601
I do.

585
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,395
I need to feel that I'm not
doing this only for myself.

586
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:13,106
I told you, you're not alone, okay?

587
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,651
It's important to know
the next steps.

588
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:18,445
And having the same story.

589
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,740
The real question is, are you sure?

590
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,966
There it is.

591
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:44,471
-Oh, I forgot my stuff. One second.
-Sure. Don't worry.

592
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:00,237
Borja is calling.
What the fuck do I do?

593
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,989
Don't answer.

594
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,978
It's getting a little cold, huh?

595
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,022
Yes. You're right.

596
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,985
You really don't mind
that I wait in your house?

597
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:42,487
No. Not at all.

598
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,490
Trust me, I would tell you if I did.

599
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,534
Lately, I don't hold anything in.

600
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:51,496
That's great. Lately,
only few men are like that.

601
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:52,998
Sincere.

602
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,000
I'M IN

603
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,047
Okay.

604
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:04,009
Once we've done it, we need
his fingerprints on the gun.

605
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:04,551
Alright?

606
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,512
He found out about us,
made you sign the agreement,

607
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,556
and I refused to do
what he wanted, okay?

608
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,266
He tried to kick you out,

609
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:14,561
packed your things, and lost it.
Alright?

610
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:17,564
-Then I--
-You?

611
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,025
In self defense.

612
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,526
Let's see how everything
plays out this evening

613
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:22,527
and we will find
the right moment.

614
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,072
How are we going to do it?
Will you dare?

615
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:28,033
Listen, we will do
what he wants, okay?

616
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,326
We're going to have sex
in front of him

617
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,078
and do what's in the agreement.

618
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,831
Baby, he will go berserk.

619
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,542
Okay? I'm going to provoke him,
don't worry. Let's go.

620
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:41,588
Okay then... sign.

621
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,593
Go on. Sign it.

622
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,097
Dear Lord.

623
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:26,133
Fuck it.

624
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:30,595
Let's make clear that we did
everything he asked,

625
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:31,930
we even signed the agreement,

626
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,348
and yet, things got complicated,
okay?

627
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,099
Okay, calm down.

628
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:36,143
<i>A glass of wine?</i>

629
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,149
-Who's with him?
-I don't know.

630
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,110
-Um... sure.
-Yes?

631
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:47,612
Look who's here, the lovebirds.

632
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:51,158
I called you. I thought
you had fled or something.

633
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,162
Hi.

634
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,664
Nice to meet you.

635
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,625
And you are...

636
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,918
She's...

637
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,128
-Jennifer.
-Jennifer.

638
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,173
I'm Jennifer. I had a little
problem with my car and--

639
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,925
She had a little mishap
right outside, on the road.

640
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,136
And since we're
so welcoming lately

641
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:13,638
and let anyone in...

642
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,682
I told her to stay.

643
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:19,186
This is my faithful wife, Cat.

644
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,689
Are you okay?

645
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,484
Yes. Um... I'm fine.

646
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,697
But it's been a crazy day and--

647
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,699
-Borja.
-Borja.

648
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,661
She still doesn't know.
You don't know this,

649
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:40,165
but you're witness of one of the most
important evenings of our lives.

650
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:42,083
And we just met.

651
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,877
Amazing.

652
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,338
Let's go outside while you wait

653
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,173
and you make up your mind?

654
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,175
What was your name again?

655
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,177
-Marcos.
-Marcos.

656
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,720
It's a pleasure.

657
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,681
Um, he tried to help with my car.

658
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,725
It's okay, come with me.

659
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,232
This way.

660
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:39,015
It feels like I'm
interrupting something.

661
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,725
No, why?

662
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,269
I don't know.

663
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,231
It's okay, Jennifer.

664
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:48,733
Borja is a great host. Aren't you?

665
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:51,778
He arranged a wonderful evening.

666
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:55,448
Let's celebrate.
For the good times.

667
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,409
Just as you wanted.

668
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,744
Why the sudden change of heart?

669
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:02,289
Do you want to discuss this
in front of our guest?

670
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,751
How is your mother going
to call you when she arrives?

671
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:10,755
Oh, yes. Right.
I'm sorry, I'm exhausted.

672
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,591
Um, my phone is dead.

673
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,302
Right.

674
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,304
Excuse me.

675
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,313
So, what happened?

676
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,316
This is too much for me.

677
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:33,778
Excuse me, can I use your bathroom?

678
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,780
Sure. There's one upstairs.

679
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,824
Thank you.

680
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:44,789
Well. This calls a celebration.

681
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:48,460
-Do you feel better now?
-No, the usual.

682
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,795
But this will be a more
entertaining evening now.

683
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:53,298
This is too much
for me too, you know.

684
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,799
Right.

685
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,843
You'll bring her now?

686
00:43:57,344 --> 00:44:00,847
I'll bring some glasses.
I thought you wanted a toast.

687
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,932
Fuck.

688
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:49,956
Hey, kid.
Where exactly are you heading?

689
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:52,917
Valle de Bravo.

690
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,461
Documents.

691
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,720
Alfonso Fernandez Cuevas.

692
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,972
I'll be right back.

693
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,487
What are you doing?

694
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:34,250
You know that I like
to keep things tidy.

695
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,754
I want your new friend
out of here.

696
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:40,006
Now you're jealous?

697
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,510
It's a bit too late for that,
don't you think?

698
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:55,480
How do you want us to do it?

699
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:57,524
I don't understand, honey.

700
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:00,485
How, when, and where do you
want me to fuck your wife.

701
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:03,029
You've always been imaginative.

702
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,046
To you.

703
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:23,800
Go get her, or I will.

704
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:29,055
Relax, okay?

705
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:32,517
Given the circumstances,
it's better to let yourself go.

706
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,062
We need our plan to succeed.

707
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:43,361
Yeah, relax. We're all grown-ups.

708
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,030
Finally you say something logic.

709
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,782
You like this?

710
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:56,082
Stop. Not here.

711
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:05,091
Do you really want us to do this?

712
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:09,095
Tonight's going to be a great night.

713
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,558
The plate's clean.
Everything's okay.

714
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,227
Thank you, officer.
Can I go now?

715
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:21,107
-Alright. Drive safely.
-Thank you.

716
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,169
Fuck.

717
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,629
What?

718
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:26,631
I must confess
I wasn't expecting this.

719
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:28,675
I know you way less
than I thought.

720
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,635
I was alone for too long, maybe?

721
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:32,178
Come here.

722
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:37,975
Okay, stop.

723
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:41,187
Not here.

724
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:46,693
Are you coming?

725
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:50,697
Come on!

726
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:06,671
Mr. Riscal. Mr. Riscal!

727
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:11,843
Look, my wife was cheating on me
with mt best friend, and I--

728
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,678
I don't know why
I made that deal.

729
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,430
I guess I don't know
myself very well,

730
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:16,889
and I wasn't expecting
something like that.

731
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:20,184
-Like what?
-Like that, it got out of hand.

732
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,186
This is the thing,

733
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,355
your wife, despite being
out of danger now,

734
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:27,692
was admitted to the emergency room,
after she was shot on the leg.

735
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:31,696
We haven't talked to her,
but we talked to her lawyer, Alfred.

736
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:33,698
And he said
that you threatened her

737
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,700
with filing for the divorce.

738
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:37,243
She didn't take it well.

739
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:39,203
We also found an agreement

740
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:42,206
where you force her to give up
her shares of your company

741
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:45,209
and have intercourse
with Mr. Marcos Source

742
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,712
witnessed by you.

743
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:50,590
Specifically, on the eighth clause.

744
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,881
No... I can't.

745
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,883
Not like this.

746
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,390
Seriously, Borja?

747
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:09,854
There's a woman in my house and
I have no fucking idea of who she is.

748
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:12,899
Can we at least wait
until she's gone?

749
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:26,370
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What were you thinking?

750
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,497
-Shh. Calm down. It's okay.
-Are you crazy too?

751
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,041
Calm down.

752
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:33,920
Come here.

753
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:34,939
I didn't see you.

754
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:38,234
You were taking too long.
I was worried.

755
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,486
It's a girls thing.

756
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,491
Thank you.

757
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:30,953
This is fucking nuts.

758
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,508
Remember when we were stuck
in the middle of the desert?

759
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,509
I remember how we got there.

760
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:48,721
But I don't know
how we managed to get out.

761
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:50,014
You and Jennifer have no idea,

762
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:52,016
but this is a celebration.

763
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:54,060
What are you celebrating?

764
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:58,022
Freedom. Freedom.

765
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:00,524
You're having so much fun.

766
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,026
I feel liberated, I can't lie.

767
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:02,943
I'm free.

768
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:05,571
Have you guys known each other
for a long time?

769
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:09,033
Well, "known each other"...

770
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:10,534
You ought to be more specific.

771
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:11,535
For many years now.

772
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:12,578
It's been a while, yes.

773
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,830
Those are
the best friendships, right?

774
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,540
You have no idea.

775
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:17,541
Right?

776
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:20,044
Listen. Hey, hey.

777
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:21,587
Marcos!

778
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:25,591
Hey, relax! Cut it out.

779
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:29,095
Listen.

780
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:34,558
Didn't you say
there was no signal?

781
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:39,105
I'm just checking.
Hope is the last to die.

782
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,614
What do you do for a living?

783
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,287
I'm a Chief Financial Officer.

784
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,665
Chief Financial Officer?

785
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:06,632
Sorry but...
you don't look like one.

786
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:08,884
Well, I'm not working right now.

787
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,595
Neither am I.
They just fired me.

788
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,640
But you can't complain.
You live well.

789
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:17,101
I mean, not really.

790
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:19,145
All of this belongs
to my husband.

791
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:25,609
The fucking eighth clause!

792
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,611
Marcos, you've drunk enough.
Stop it.

793
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:31,157
Cheers.
What's the eighth clause?

794
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,617
You don't know what it is?
No?

795
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:37,121
I'll explain it to you.
I'll explain it to you.

796
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:38,622
Stop it, Marcos, you're too drunk.

797
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,125
Fuck, let me explain.
Let me explain.

798
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:42,626
Our good friend Borja--

799
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,628
Enough! You're saying too much.

800
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,839
What? You don't know
what I'm going to say.

801
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:48,174
He is Cat's husband.

802
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:50,634
Well, let's say future
ex husband, okay?

803
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:52,136
Oops.

804
00:57:52,178 --> 00:57:54,180
He's not sad, or destroyed,
hell no!

805
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,140
This is a modern man
from the 21st century.

806
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:57,141
With big balls, right?

807
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:59,351
He's always...
Always seeing the bright side

808
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,145
even in the worst of situations,
you know.

809
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:02,146
Will you shut up?

810
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:03,647
No, I won't. I'm not saying
anything wrong.

811
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,149
So let me say what I have to say.

812
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:07,151
Look, I'll give you some context.

813
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:09,153
He can't deal with failure, okay?

814
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:10,946
So he decided to turn his divorce

815
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,157
-into a competition.
-Stop it, Marcos, please.

816
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:14,909
-You shut up.
-Excuse me?

817
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,161
Careful how you talk to my wife!

818
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:19,163
I will explain the situation.
Listen to me.

819
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:22,166
He made up a deal.
A fucking agreement

820
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,667
where he snatches
everything from his wife.

821
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:24,668
-Marcos!
-What?

822
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,170
Enough! That's it.

823
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:27,671
-Marcos, please.
-No, let me--

824
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:29,673
So he looked into the shit.

825
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,675
That's what he was looking for.
Me.

826
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,178
-Marcos, stop.
-His fucking agreement says

827
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,889
that I have to fuck his wife
in front of him.

828
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:37,848
How about that!

829
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:40,184
Interesting.

830
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:40,726
Great.

831
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:42,186
Is it true or not, baby?

832
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:43,896
-Is it or is it not?
-Stop. Stop it, Marcos!

833
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:45,189
No, I won't stop.

834
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:48,359
You're a coward, dude.
You're a fucking coward.

835
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,694
Instead of facing it like a man
and have the balls--

836
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:51,695
Motherfucker!

837
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:53,239
-Ah!
-Marcos!

838
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,742
Son of a bitch.

839
00:58:57,243 --> 00:59:00,746
Shit. Where the fuck is it?
Where is it?

840
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,707
Hey! Hey! Enough!

841
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:06,877
Stop, that's it, I'm not
even bleeding, so stop it.

842
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:08,754
Let's call the police,
this is assault,

843
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,422
-it's in the agreement.
-We're not calling anybody.

844
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:12,716
You understand, right?
We have a fucking witness.

845
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:15,761
It's over, okay?

846
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:21,267
I'm so fed up with him.
I can't deal with this anymore.

847
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:26,772
Are you okay?

848
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,566
I don't know.

849
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:34,780
You still love him, huh?

850
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:37,783
Answer me, do you still love him?

851
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:39,743
Do you really want to go on
with this?

852
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:41,245
Of course, because this is
your fault,

853
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:42,288
do you get it or not?

854
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,290
This is all because of you.

855
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:02,826
They have jewels, watches.

856
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:05,871
I'm sure they have cash.

857
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,874
Shit.

858
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:15,839
If you do what I say,
no one will get hurt.

859
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:18,342
But if you try anything,
I'll shoot you, okay?

860
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:20,844
-Wait.
-Shut up.

861
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:22,846
From now on, only I will speak.

862
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:23,847
What do you want?

863
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,016
Play hide and seek.

864
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:28,394
Where's the safe box?

865
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:34,400
Tell me where's the safe box.

866
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:43,200
Don't move.

867
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:47,913
-Cotiti.
-Why are you taking so long, baby?

868
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,374
I'm outside the house,
I can see it from here. Calm down.

869
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:52,376
<i>Let me know when you're on</i>
the front door, okay?

870
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:53,877
-Listen.
-Shh.

871
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:55,546
What's that, you got caught?

872
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:58,382
Kind of.
But everything's under control

873
01:01:58,424 --> 01:02:00,426
Let me know, okay?

874
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,599
I'm sorry I hit you.

875
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,184
I shouldn't have. Are you okay?

876
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,396
Yes, I'm fine, don't worry.
It was my fault.

877
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,690
Alcohol and I
don't get along that well.

878
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,442
Where's Cat?

879
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:19,445
She was looking for you.

880
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:24,700
I want you to know that...
I didn't want this to happen.

881
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,452
Are you going to kill me?

882
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,413
Don't try to fool me.

883
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:31,623
I just texted my lawyer

884
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,417
telling him that my gun
is gone from the safe!

885
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:34,918
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

886
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,421
Only Cat and I know the code.

887
01:02:37,463 --> 01:02:38,922
But Cat is unpredictable.

888
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:40,924
You two are so fucked.
If anything happens to me--

889
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,926
Why were you looking
for the gun?

890
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,970
Are you planning to get rid of me?

891
01:02:47,473 --> 01:02:49,933
I don't know. You tell me.

892
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:52,728
Do it! Do it, fucker!
If you have the balls!

893
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,937
Do it, you coward!

894
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:54,938
Borja.

895
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:55,939
Listen.

896
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:58,942
Show me your hands and don't move
or I'll blow her brains.

897
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,195
Whoa, whoa! What's going on?

898
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,947
If you do exactly what I say,
this will be quick

899
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,449
and no one is going to get hurt.

900
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:07,451
There's CCTV all over the place,
you know that, right?

901
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:09,786
Seriously. Think twice.

902
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,498
Thank you, you're so kind.

903
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:13,290
Don't move, okay?

904
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:19,796
You, open the door!

905
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,508
Why aren't you moving?
Open the fucking door!

906
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:23,467
Okay, okay, calm down.

907
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:25,511
Move, fucker. Move.

908
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:28,472
Don't try anything stupid.
You know the consequences.

909
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:31,016
-Move!
-I'm on it.

910
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:41,527
Whoa! Easy. Follow my orders.

911
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:49,034
Turn around.

912
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,502
Look.

913
01:03:58,544 --> 01:04:00,504
You son of a bitch.

914
01:04:00,546 --> 01:04:03,549
Easy, okay? Easy.

915
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:08,053
Move.

916
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:12,015
What's up, people?

917
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:13,517
Good evening.

918
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:17,020
Let me introduce myself,
I am... your best friend.

919
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,773
Or your fucking worst nightmare.

920
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:22,067
It depends on how things go.

921
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:26,029
I'm here to fulfill
my necessities.

922
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:29,032
And in order to do that,
I need you to listen carefully

923
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:32,077
and do everything I ask.
Understood?

924
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,874
Understood?

925
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:40,085
Yes.

926
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:45,048
I can't hear you, motherfucker.

927
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:48,093
Yes, understood. Understood.

928
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:55,100
Fuck! Now we're talking.
The air feels different.

929
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:18,749
The safe box is downstairs.

930
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:21,585
Good. Tie them.

931
01:05:21,627 --> 01:05:22,878
I'll take care of the rest.

932
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:26,089
No, you do it. Go.

933
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:27,883
Do it, baby.

934
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:32,095
Listen, kids,
time to play a little game.

935
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:33,889
Put your backs together!

936
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:38,143
Okay. Done.
Calm down. Please.

937
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:46,610
They broke into my house
and shot my wife.

938
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:48,111
You two argued,

939
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,656
your wife wanted to leave
but you wouldn't let her,

940
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:52,616
and as it says here
in the statement,

941
01:05:52,658 --> 01:05:55,661
one thing led to another
and you shot her.

942
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:59,164
The gun has your fingerprints
and it's under your name.

943
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:04,169
Done.

944
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:09,466
Fuck.

945
01:06:10,676 --> 01:06:13,178
We meet many idiots
like yourselves.

946
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,807
My mom is here.

947
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:24,648
Hands.

948
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:26,650
Don't dare to touch me.

949
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:29,194
-Whoa.
-What did you tell him?

950
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:33,156
Shut your fucking mouth
or I'll do it for you, bitch.

951
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:34,866
Who's laughing now?

952
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:36,076
Fucking bitch.

953
01:06:38,412 --> 01:06:39,705
Whoa! Whoa! Fucker!

954
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:42,165
The fuck are you doing?

955
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:43,709
Give it to me!

956
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,879
-Hey!
-Next time it won't be her leg.

957
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,465
It's okay. It's okay.

958
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:51,675
Turn around!

959
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:54,386
-Ah, shit!
-Let me see.

960
01:06:54,428 --> 01:06:56,680
-Cotiti!
-Fuck them.

961
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:58,932
No, no, no!
What the fuck did you do?

962
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:00,183
-Well--
-What do I always tell you?

963
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,185
-I told them!
-Where's the CCTV?

964
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:03,228
Downstairs.

965
01:07:03,729 --> 01:07:05,230
Fuck.

966
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:09,192
Listen, I know what
you might be thinking,

967
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:11,695
but it's not true. Listen to me.

968
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:16,199
I was planning to fuck them hard.
It's true.

969
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:19,202
But I would never...
want to hurt them physically.

970
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:21,204
I'm not a murderer.

971
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:24,708
I'll say it again, your wife
was shot

972
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:26,501
with your gun.

973
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,584
They took the gun.

974
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:09,252
And set me up.

975
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:12,422
-They?
-Yes. They want to fuck me up.

976
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:14,800
Look, when your wife
is fully conscious

977
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,760
an agent will question her

978
01:08:16,802 --> 01:08:18,762
to confirm everything
you just said.

979
01:08:18,804 --> 01:08:22,015
To be honest, Mr. Riscal,
your wife is your best hope

980
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:24,768
to avoid being prosecuted
for attempted murder.

981
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:26,978
The CCTV! There's CCTV!

982
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,563
It must have been recorder,
you can verify there.

983
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:32,275
We did, and nothing was recorded
from the last 24 hours.

984
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:32,776
What?

985
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:35,779
I'm assuming that after asking
your wife and your best friend

986
01:08:35,821 --> 01:08:39,825
to have intercourse, you didn't
want any recordings, right?

987
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:47,207
Arrgh! It really hurts.

988
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,292
Give me your belt.

989
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:51,044
Cotiti, what the fuck is this?

990
01:08:51,086 --> 01:08:53,630
Baby, the belt.

991
01:08:57,092 --> 01:08:58,134
Raise your leg.

992
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:09,312
Can someone explain
what the fuck is going on?

993
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:12,357
Calm down, okay? We made a deal.

994
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:14,985
One moment.

995
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:20,365
Let's make a deal.

996
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:26,371
One more time.

997
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,333
The safe box code is...

998
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:34,337
the date of our wedding,
03/06/13.

999
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,840
Okay, what else?

1000
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:39,384
The security controls
are in the office.

1001
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:45,348
-The code is 8436... 19.
-36... 19. Great.

1002
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:48,852
You need to delete the last
24 hours and turn it off.

1003
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:50,395
Okay.

1004
01:09:56,902 --> 01:09:59,404
I need you to wake him up.

1005
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,907
Do it.

1006
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:29,935
Hi, baby.

1007
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,910
Bingo.

1008
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:28,493
<i>-Motherfucker! Hey!</i>
-Cat, Cat, Cat!

1009
01:11:33,999 --> 01:11:36,167
Fucking bitch.

1010
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:38,461
Fucking bitch.

1011
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:41,006
The gun was in the safe.

1012
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:44,509
Only she and I know the code.

1013
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,516
There it is.

1014
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:53,351
At the back.

1015
01:11:58,023 --> 01:11:59,524
Okay.

1016
01:12:01,026 --> 01:12:02,986
We will carry out
an investigation

1017
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:05,989
to confirm everything
you're saying.

1018
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:07,991
I want to speak with my wife.

1019
01:12:08,033 --> 01:12:10,535
In due time, Mr. Riscal.

1020
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,996
Can I make a call?

1021
01:12:13,038 --> 01:12:14,998
My advice is,
wait for your lawyer

1022
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,500
and he'll suggest what to do.

1023
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:19,544
Do you have a husband?

1024
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:22,047
Wife.

1025
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,265
3 DAYS LATER

1026
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:11,596
Get in.

1027
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,634
I talked to the police

1028
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:56,099
and told them that after dinner,

1029
01:13:56,141 --> 01:14:00,145
a pair of burglars broke in
and pointed at us.

1030
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:03,606
They shot me in the leg,
and when you tried to protect me,

1031
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:07,152
they beat you up,
and you fell unconscious.

1032
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:11,156
What about Marcos? Where is he?

1033
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,911
-We need to take you to a hospital.
-Don't worry.

1034
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,913
I'm okay.

1035
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:24,377
Listen. Remember when you said
that you'd do anything for me?

1036
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:27,672
Of course I remember!

1037
01:14:28,173 --> 01:14:30,633
That has nothing to do with this.
We need to call an ambulance.

1038
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:33,678
Relax. I'm fine.

1039
01:14:37,182 --> 01:14:38,975
I'm sorry.

1040
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:40,745
You have 24 hours to sign.
Read it thoroughly.

1041
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:42,747
Take your time.

1042
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:49,254
Oh, and your lawyer,
our lawyer...

1043
01:15:49,754 --> 01:15:52,257
is now my lawyer.

1044
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:58,221
This is a low blow, my father
thought of you as a friend.

1045
01:15:58,263 --> 01:16:01,557
I wish he was alive
to see you as the snake you are.

1046
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:46,311
<i>-Hello? This is a surprise.</i>
-I need you. Urgently.

1047
01:16:53,318 --> 01:16:54,986
Where are we going?

1048
01:16:55,028 --> 01:16:57,322
Home, honey.

1049
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,824
We're going home.

1050
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,028
Good morning.

1051
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:39,781
-Morning, sir.
-I don't want any calls, please.

1052
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:44,869
<i>It's been so long.</i>

1053
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:49,832
Fantastic. Just a couple details,
but everything's okay.

1054
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:53,086
<i>Love trumps again, right?</i>

1055
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:56,339
That's crazy. Thank you.

1056
01:17:56,381 --> 01:17:58,633
<i>You don't have to thank me.</i>

1057
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,301
You don't know what you
just avoided.

1058
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,844
<i>Yes. Yes, I know.</i>

1059
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:05,348
<i>That's why I sent you an envelope</i>
with the new deal

1060
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,642
<i>and a copy of the proof</i>

1061
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,644
<i>of what really happened</i>
that night.

1062
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,397
<i>You don't want</i>
the truth to be known, right?

1063
01:18:12,647 --> 01:18:14,399
<i>She would become</i>
a murder suspect.

1064
01:18:14,649 --> 01:18:18,861
-Hey, that wasn't the deal.
-<i>Why, did we sign an agreement?</i>

1065
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:20,363
<i>Call me back when you read it.</i>

1066
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:23,199
<i>And don't worry,</i>
if I fall, you all fall.
