1
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,598
Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?

2
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,333
It still runs.
- It's amazing.

3
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,296
Hey, Pete.

4
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,394
Hey, Pete.
- Hey, Pete.

5
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,263
Stenger.

6
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,890
Bring the Beamer?

7
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:07,092
You got the stew?
- Still Charlie Hustle, huh?

8
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,548
Whoa.
How's the air up there, Stretch?

9
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:14,219
Pete, I'm sorry. Meet a good friend of mine,
Paulie Janszen.

10
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,322
Nice to meet you, Mr. Rose.

11
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,489
Pete.

12
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,812
Come on, Pete. Stew's in here.
- Let's go, you guys.

13
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,956
Come on.
He likes you.

14
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,468
75K.

15
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,459
Hey, why did the blind man
stop skydiving?

16
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,460
It was scaring the hell out of his dog.

17
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,557
Now you own a piece of history.
That's the car I drove to the ballpark...

18
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,737
the night I knocked Cobb
out of the record books.

19
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,271
Don't need it no more.
I got the Corvette.

20
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,213
Hey. Saturday.
My place.

21
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,220
Game three.
- I'll be there.

22
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,344
You too, Stretch.

23
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,061
Paulie, you're in.

24
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,814
Go. Go.

25
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,916
No. No.

26
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,292
Go.

27
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,466
Go. Go.

28
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,703
No, I said, 'What's the damn over-under? '
Hey. Hey. Hey.

29
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,707
Hey, you guys, could you keep it down?
I can't hear myself think, for Chrissake.

30
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,666
Gio can't think.

31
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,794
Gio can't hear.
Go powder your nose if it's too noisy.

32
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,980
Thanks a lot.

33
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,841
What?
Somebody get him a pacifier.

34
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,634
Yeah.

35
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,454
Yeah.
Could you hold on a second?

36
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,122
I'll just be a sec.

37
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,264
Yeah, so it's a dime on UCLA,

38
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,456
and we'll give the 14-
Arizona will never cover that.

39
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,665
Right.

40
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,835
And a dime each
on Army and Penn State.

41
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,935
Yep.

42
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,177
Go, go, go, go, go.

43
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,279
Yes. Yes.

44
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,649
Half-time. Come on, Paulie.
Let me give you the five-cent tour.

45
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,150
This is the trophy room,

46
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,862
where I keep that kind of stuff
and some of my favorite moments.

47
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:23,033
Hey, that's the 1970 All-Star game.
- Winning run. Twelfth inning.

48
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,327
That catcher.
What was his name?

49
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:29,431
Ray Fosse.
- He was never the same again, huh?

50
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:33,210
I couldn't look my dad in the eye
if I didn't barrel through him that day.

51
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,547
My 44-game hitting streak.
And here's my dad.

52
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,966
Wow.
That's your father. Yeah.

53
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,956
They called him 'Old Swivelhips. '

54
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,222
Back in 1952, when I was 11,
the old man was 40 years old,

55
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:49,560
he kicked off, he ran downfield
and he got nailed with a great block.

56
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,746
Fractured his hip, but Harry Rose...

57
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,405
crawled after the ball carrier,
made a tackle.

58
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,262
That was the kinda guy he was.

59
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,385
Kinda guy he made me into.

60
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:10,456
So what do you do, Paul,
when you're not working out? Huh?

61
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:14,042
I used to work down
at the Queen City Barrel Company.

62
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:18,046
You know, if I hadn't made it as a ball
player, I'd have ended up digging ditches.

63
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,966
Don't be ashamed
to earn an honest living.

64
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:25,971
Paulie's got a couple of nice not-so-honest
sidelines, too. Don't you, Paulie?

65
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,475
Looks like he's smart enough
not to use his own product, unlike you.

66
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,660
We can't all be perfect.

67
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,856
I would have loved
to have bet on Harry Rose.

68
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,958
He was a sure thing.

69
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,153
And you're as close
as I ever came to both, Pete.

70
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,463
To a sure thing and a dad.

71
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,050
Gio, come on.
Pull yourself together.

72
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:52,039
Pete and me met 'cause I played catch
with Petey Jr. At spring training.

73
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,627
Nobody wanted to toss the ball
back and forth with the kid, right, Pete?

74
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,770
That's right.

75
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,039
My pal here's got a big heart, Paul.

76
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,651
Come on.

77
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,029
Get back to the games.

78
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,448
Yo, Pete. How you doing?
- Hey, Mikey.

79
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,414
Good to see you.

80
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:36,750
Paulie Janszen, Cincinnati,
Mike Bertolini from, uh...

81
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,377
Brooklyn.

82
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,379
How you doing, Paulie?
Call me Mikey, everybody does.

83
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,006
Nice to meet you, sir.
- I got everything all lined up.

84
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,884
The best signing spot in the joint.
We're gonna make a killing.

85
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,221
My stew, Mikey. It's up-front.
- Forget about it.

86
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,390
Hey, Pete, you hungry?
I got you a sandwich.

87
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,933
It's OK, I'll wait.

88
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,186
Good morning, Mr. Rose. It's a real honor.
- Make it Pete.

89
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,189
Hey, Pete, for later,
I know this great Italian restaurant.

90
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,199
They serve spaghetti?
- Maybe.

91
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,369
Thank you.
- There you go.

92
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,538
It was very nice to meet you, Pete.
I hope to see you later.

93
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,783
Hope to see you, too. Thanks.
- Bye.

94
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,087
I was at Shea
the day you flattened Bud Harrelson.

95
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,715
Huh?
- Holy smokes, what a mess.

96
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,718
You were one of them bozos up
in the bleachers throwing beer cans at me?

97
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,929
Nah, nah. I was a Reds fan,
even back then.

98
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:35,267
Screw the Mets. You could
have killed Harrelson for all I cared.

99
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,512
That's game-worn, right?
- Smell it.

100
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,402
So who do you like
in the Jets game, Pete?

101
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,362
Who do you think?
I'm surrounded by New Yorkers.

102
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,282
The Jets, plus three,
they can't lose.

103
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:54,953
Could you put, 'To your number-one pal
Frank? ' And sign that 'Charlie Hustle? '...

104
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,622
Sure.
- No, no, no, no. Hey, forget about it.

105
00:09:56,722 --> 00:10:00,459
It's $445 for the jersey and the autograph.
No extras.

106
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,420
What a pleasure this is.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

107
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,580
It means a lot to me and...
- Next.

108
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,818
They all love you.

109
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:14,573
Everybody loves a winner, Paulie.
Check out the Annie.

110
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,011
Hi, Pete.
I'm one of your biggest fans.

111
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,162
I can see that.

112
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,142
Oh.
Take care of him, will ya?

113
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,877
Here.
- Thanks.

114
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,122
Come on, give it to me.
Give it to me.

115
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,594
Pretty good, huh?
- I thought I heard you come in.

116
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,904
Hey.
- So, how did it go?

117
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,890
Had 'em lined up
for blocks outside.

118
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,102
We've been hanging around too much.
- Missed you.

119
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,271
This is my buddy Paul Janszen,
my lovely wife Carol.

120
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,815
Hi. It's nice to meet you.
- Same here. You guys must be starved.

121
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,859
Oh, we had some burgers...
- Is that perfume I smell?

122
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,989
...on the way to the airport. I told you
to stop wearing that smelly stuff, didn't I?

123
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:16,679
Here, honey. Buy yourself
something beautiful tomorrow.

124
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,863
Lucky me.
- I'll be up in a minute.

125
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:27,312
First time I saw Carol,
she was at a restaurant.

126
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:31,508
She was serving cocktails in,
you know, one of those miniskirts.

127
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,753
She had the nicest bottom I ever saw.

128
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,556
She seems really sweet.
- Thanks.

129
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:41,727
Behind every successful man,
there's a great woman, right?

130
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,020
Uh... Well,

131
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,135
I'd better be going.
I got a good woman waiting for me, too.

132
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,129
Thanks, Pete.

133
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:56,533
For everything.
Today was one of the best days of my life.

134
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,677
Really?
- Yeah.

135
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,579
Here.
- Oh, no...

136
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,765
You earned it.
My bodyguard.

137
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:08,126
We're gonna make a great team.
You and me.

138
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,190
Good night.

139
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,616
Look at those muscles.
Those eyes.

140
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:41,912
Paulie, my father always said, 'Those
are the greatest athletes in the world. '

141
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,081
They don't even
have to give interviews.

142
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,071
Listen to Paulie.
'No interviews. '

143
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,297
What the hell would people do
if they didn't gamble, huh?

144
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,522
Keep some of their money.

145
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,362
What?
What did I say?

146
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,267
Gambling's not about winning or losing.

147
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,369
Huh?
Right, Paulie?

148
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,689
It's about having the balls
to take a chance.

149
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,254
That's my degenerate gambler.

150
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,991
How much are we ponying up for
the Pik Six, huh? I'm in for 1500, baby.

151
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,576
I feel this one. I feel it.
- I got 250.

152
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,788
I'm gonna go five.
- You will?

153
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,332
All right, buddy boy.
- That's a lot of money.

154
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:31,436
How 'bout it, Gio?
Come on.

155
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,506
Roll the dice for a change.
Take a chance.

156
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,836
We hit six ponies in a row, it's huge.

157
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:42,806
Step it up, come on.
Step it up.

158
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,893
Why don't you get Paul to do it,
you're in such a hurry?

159
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:50,328
I'd be happy to...
- Sit, Paulie. You're my guest.

160
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:12,503
Hey, Pete. I'm having a little trouble with
the Beamer. It seems the engine's blown.

161
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:15,672
Really? Wow.
Someone must have driven it too hard.

162
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,883
Yeah.
That's what my mechanic told me.

163
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,594
Hm. You've got to watch it
with mechanics, though.

164
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,904
A lot of them are thieves.

165
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,898
The last race.
Our four horse is looking good.

166
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,527
Like money in the bank.
- So we want the four horse to win, right?

167
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,629
Exactly.
She's cute.

168
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,241
See the four horse wins, Katarina, that
means we won all six - that's the Pik Six.

169
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,076
We win all the dough.
- All right.

170
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,236
One minute to post time.

171
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,730
All right.
Here we go.

172
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,423
And they're off.
Breaking quickly from the gate...

173
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:00,526
I don't see it.
I don't see it.

174
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:04,096
Pink. In the back.
In the back. The four horse.

175
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,516
What color? What color?
What color? What color? What color?

176
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:11,145
We're gonna lose it.
- No, we're not gonna lose it.

177
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,189
He's gonna make it.
He's gonna make a kick.

178
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,650
I see the kicks here.
- He's got a good stride going on.

179
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,750
It hasn't happened yet.

180
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,864
The one in the last place.
- He's not even in the race.

181
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,407
You're being negative.
Don't be negative.

182
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,717
Here he comes.
- Come on.

183
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,953
Watch this.
He's gonna kick. He's gonna kick.

184
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,538
Come on. Step it up.
- Come on. Come on.

185
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:36,121
Here it comes.
Here it comes. Let's go.

186
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,758
Here he goes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

187
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,861
Come on.
Come on.

188
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,029
Go. Go.

189
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:56,589
...final surge. Oh, Really
on the outside, the four horse will take it.

190
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,457
Yes.

191
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,338
Yes.
- You did it, baby.

192
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,492
Here's the winner.
Number 4, Oh, Really.

193
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:12,117
They Come In Fives by Chill Factor,
owned by the Jenkell stable...

194
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,166
Hang on.

195
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:20,314
247,647 bucks.
What a score.

196
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,345
Hey.

197
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:29,760
No long face now, huh, Gio?

198
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:34,077
Hey, what do you say, buddy?
Go cash the ticket.

199
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:39,525
You need to show some honest income,
and the IRS ain't getting no more of mine.

200
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,529
I don't want no tax problems.
This will make me legit for the year.

201
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,864
See the favors
I do for you, Gio? Huh?

202
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,324
Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

203
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,510
No hard feelings.

204
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:56,126
Hey, look at Pete.
He turns water into wine.

205
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,858
That's what friends are for.

206
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,899
Woo.

207
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,118
That's it.
Easy.

208
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:28,098
You never been to spring training before?
- No. It's great.

209
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,217
It's great.

210
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,511
Huh.
Check out Pete.

211
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,602
Quicker feet.
Quicker feet.

212
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
There.

213
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,533
Oh. Yeah.

214
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:59,897
Eric Davis can play baseball, huh?
- That's for sure.

215
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,040
Way to go, Eric.

216
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,151
Hey.

217
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,527
Hey, hey.

218
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,630
Hiya, Pete.
- Paulie. Mike.

219
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:12,076
Francona's looking good.
- Everybody looks good in batting practice.

220
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:13,994
How come you never pitched before, Pete?

221
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,899
I was too busy getting base hits.

222
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,582
Way to swing the bat, David.

223
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:21,502
Davis stays healthy,
you guys are gonna look pretty tough.

224
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,212
What do you think the odds are
for the pennant?

225
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:27,341
Better than even money if we get past
Houston. Not getting any ideas, are you?

226
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,926
A little one.

227
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:32,805
Hey, you got jelly on your face.
- Hey, Pete. Can I have a second?

228
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,948
OK.
Yeah, Tony.

229
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:38,268
Buddy Bell's daughter's got a problem.
Something with her heart.

230
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:44,374
She's gonna need surgery.
He's pretty shook up by the whole thing.

231
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,544
Buddy.
Come here.

232
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,939
It's like a sauna today, huh?
- Yep.

233
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:56,161
So, Tony told me about your problem.
Let me tell you something.

234
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,790
You take care of your little girl. Third base
will be waiting for you when you get back.

235
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,835
It's a scary thing, Pete.
My heart's in my throat.

236
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,629
Got a good doctor?
- Supposed to be the best in the country.

237
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,756
OK.
Then everything's gonna be all right.

238
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:11,510
These guys today can perform miracles.
There's nothing they can't do, OK, Buddy?

239
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,345
Yeah.
- Everything's gonna be all right. All right?

240
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:16,390
Yeah.
- All right, kid? Get outta here.

241
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,267
Bring it out here
and let me have a look at it.

242
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,369
Pete.

243
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:23,622
Yeah.
- That guy's here again.

244
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,062
Says he's not leaving till he sees you.

245
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,352
Thanks.
- Way to go, Mario.

246
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,615
I don't understand, Pete.
Why's everything changed around here?

247
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:38,162
Nothing's changed, believe me.
It's just a lot of bullshit with the league.

248
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:41,665
They don't want any nonbaseball people
on the field, in the clubhouse.

249
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,543
All this time, it's never been a problem.
- Well, it is now.

250
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:48,589
What about Paulie?
Why is it OK for him all of a sudden?

251
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:53,010
Look, I'm working on this.
Just give it a little time.

252
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,556
Gio, come on. Have I ever let you down,
Gio? Have I ever let you down?

253
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,659
Have I ever let you down?

254
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:04,989
I miss you, man.
Just hanging out, the two of us.

255
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,669
Come on.
No, come on.

256
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:11,987
Sorry.

257
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,173
Hey.
Come on.

258
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,898
Hey, who's better than us, right?

259
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,971
Nobody.

260
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,145
I gotta...

261
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,960
I'll see you soon, man.
- Yeah. Go on.

262
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,281
There's nothing more beautiful.

263
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,784
A ballpark a couple of hours
before game time is close,

264
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,453
but you don't get
that earthy smell like this.

265
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:05,833
I think I'd come to the track
even if I couldn't bet the ponies.

266
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:10,098
You know, I never even
placed a bet before we met.

267
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,131
Really?
- Yeah.

268
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:16,427
How'd you manage that?
- It just never occurred to me.

269
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:20,055
I don't think it's never
not occurred to me.

270
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:24,977
It's like when you feel that solid crack,
and you know you got a stand-up double.

271
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:27,396
You're rounding first base
and you watch that outfielder.

272
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,939
Now it's all a matter of odds.

273
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,234
What are the chances he's gonna make
a perfect throw if you head for third base?

274
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:36,074
Is he even thinking third?
That's the gamble.

275
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:39,199
Can you stretch a stand-up double
into a triple?

276
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,385
Can you beat the odds?

277
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:46,039
It takes a special kind of person
to have that kind of confidence.

278
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:50,219
No. You just have to be willing
to be thrown out.

279
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:54,882
You could play it safe.
Stop at second base.

280
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:57,025
Most guys do.

281
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,263
You know, I don't think a lot of people
really know you, Pete.

282
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,015
What?

283
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:07,195
I don't think a lot of people...
- I heard you.

284
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:11,577
Hey. Here comes Ronnie.
Play it cool with this guy.

285
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,210
Hey, Ronnie.
- Who's this?

286
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:18,030
The guy I told you about. My buddy Paulie
from Cincinnati. He's good people.

287
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,133
Says who?
- Says me. Pete Rose.

288
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,536
I don't really like meeting new people.

289
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:28,415
But out of respect for Pete here
I'm gonna make an exception in your case.

290
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:32,170
Take a walk with me,
Paulie from Cincinnati.

291
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:47,976
You been a friend of Pete's long?
- Not really that long,

292
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:52,898
but we pretty much grew up in the same
area, so it's kinda like we go back...

293
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,317
What's that mean? 'Kinda like? '
- Uh...

294
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,612
Why you so nervous, Paul?
What? Am I terrifying?

295
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:02,877
I'm just not really sure
what we're talking about.

296
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,453
I'm a cautious man. I believe in looking
both ways before I cross the street.

297
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:09,498
You a gambling man, Paul?
- Now and then.

298
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:12,960
Pete's a gambling man.
Has a real passion for it.

299
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,379
Which, for a guy in his position,
is not necessarily a good thing.

300
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,757
That's where you would come in.
- I'm a little lost.

301
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:22,261
You're gonna phone Pete's picks into me.
I'm gonna relay that action to New York.

302
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:25,431
You see how it works now?
Everyone's clean, once removed.

303
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,933
L- I think I should talk to Pete about...

304
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:31,353
Pete already talked to me about it.
Now I'm talking to you.

305
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:36,128
You can't handle the weight,
we'll find someone who can.

306
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:39,878
I can handle it.

307
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:43,991
Monday after weekend's game
is settle-up time.

308
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,952
Pete gets a little forgetful.
lets things slide.

309
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:50,164
It is now part of your job
to make sure that don't happen.

310
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:52,307
Nice meeting you, Paul.

311
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:08,307
All right. I'll see you next week.
Thanks for coming.

312
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:11,602
Hey, it's Tommy Helms.
- Good game. Good game.

313
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:14,146
You happy, Tommy?
- Yeah, I'm happy. That's the way to do it.

314
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:18,581
Sorry about that.
- Bad break. It'll be all right.

315
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:23,489
My cut's 75 percent, right?
- Forget about it. This is like stealing.

316
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:26,479
Just ask Pete.
- OK, Mikey. Cool.

317
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:32,998
When we talk baseball Cincinnati,
there's only one team to talk about.

318
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:35,098
NBA.

319
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:37,878
Hey, Pete.
- Hey.

320
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:43,050
Can I have a second?
Got a kid needs some help on the infield.

321
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,040
Give us a minute, will you, Tommy?

322
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,074
Tommy.
You deal with it.

323
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:56,522
That's why I hired you.
You're the best. Only the best.

324
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:58,357
OK.
All right.

325
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:00,459
Hey, Doug.
- Tommy.

326
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,047
We need to talk, Pete.

327
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,133
In private.

328
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:10,592
Hey.

329
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:26,104
We got a problem.
- Not from where I'm standing.

330
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,221
I'm talking about the nonbaseball
personnel in the clubhouse.

331
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:31,723
You know it's against regulations.

332
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:34,852
You came down here to mess with me
over that rinky-dink rule?

333
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,937
The commissioner
doesn't see it that way.

334
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:40,274
Well then, have him call me
and we'll talk about it.

335
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:43,094
My friends ain't hurting nobody.

336
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:47,156
I don't make the rules,
but it's my job to enforce them,

337
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:52,035
and from here on out, you're gonna
stick to them like everyone else.

338
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,685
Get out of my office.
- What?

339
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:59,293
Get out... You heard me loud and clear.
We're done here.

340
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,628
This is going straight to Marge.
- Hey.

341
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,839
You think the owner of this damned team's
gonna side with you?

342
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,925
I put the asses on all those seats
every night. Not you.

343
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:10,220
Not some bozo in a monkey suit.
- Take a good look in the mirror, Rose.

344
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,599
You're just another 45-year-old has-been
managing a baseball team.

345
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:18,544
Nothing more or less.
- Hey, Doug. Let's leave. Come on.

346
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:30,282
The commissioner's a stickler
for the nonbaseball personnel rule.

347
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,743
You know that.
- I didn't appreciate being lectured.

348
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:35,579
Doug has a job to do,
and I'm the one who pays him to do it.

349
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,789
I'll stick by the rules, Marge.

350
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:39,708
I don't pay him to look the other way.
- No problem. OK.

351
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:42,294
We have a good team this year.
- Flattery, Marge, will get you everywhere.

352
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:45,794
But outside distractions, we don't need.

353
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:50,594
Now, I chose you to manage this team
because you're a winner.

354
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,096
I can say in all honesty...

355
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:55,849
that no single man has ever
meant as much to the city of Cincinnati.

356
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,976
And here I thought
I was gonna get chewed out.

357
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,626
I'm making a point here, Pete.

358
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:03,816
Can I count on you
to do the right thing?

359
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,735
Ms. Schott. That call...
- Yes. Yep.

360
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:09,321
I'll be right back.
- Margie, put it out of your mind.

361
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:11,281
Pete Rose won't let you
or the Reds down.

362
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:14,271
I'm as happy as hell to hear that.

363
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:40,951
Paulie.

364
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:44,289
Here.
You know.

365
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:53,340
Cleveland, plus nine.

366
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:56,593
Utah, minus five.

367
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,221
Boston, minus two.

368
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:02,224
LA, minus fifteen.

369
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:06,228
All right.
Yep.

370
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:09,606
Sacramento, minus five.

371
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,775
Uh-huh.

372
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,554
Let's go.
Come on on the inside, baby, let's go.

373
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:17,014
Come on, come on.

374
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,157
No. No. No.

375
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:22,953
Paul, no.
I gotta stop losing.

376
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,259
Hello.
This is Paul.

377
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,413
...needs at least a point.

378
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,582
...is not the man you want to shoot.

379
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:46,293
Gets the ball out off the hand. No.

380
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,538
They foul him with two seconds to go.

381
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:05,729
Hello.

382
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:09,858
If I don't get my money by week's
end, you're gonna have big problems.

383
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:10,943
Ron?

384
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,195
You're responsible,
not the other guy.

385
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:16,907
I break your friggin' legs,
no one will give a shit.

386
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:20,577
That's crazy.
- That's reality, jerk off.

387
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,347
Get my money.

388
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,939
Who was that?

389
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:35,065
Nobody.

390
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:39,556
Baby, who was that?
You're white as a sheet.

391
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:42,115
I'm fine. I'm fine.

392
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,563
Sure you know what you're doing?
- Yeah.

393
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,706
Go back to sleep.

394
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,369
Come on, let me give you
the five-cent tour. That's what Pete calls it.

395
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,497
Yeah, more like
the 50 million-dollar tour.

396
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:08,147
Not quite.
We're working on it.

397
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:12,045
Ron's not messing around, Pete.
He threatened me.

398
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:16,842
These guys are all the same. Bums.
A bunch of crybabies. Tell him to wait.

399
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:19,236
You tell him.

400
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:23,932
The whole idea of you being the
middleman is that I stay outside of the loop.

401
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:27,019
I thought you understood that.
- I do.

402
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,188
But you've put me
in a situation here, Pete.

403
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:33,442
I mean, I can't have people
calling my house in the middle of the night...

404
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:37,321
saying they're gonna hurt me
unless you make good.

405
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:41,033
It's betting, Pete. If you win, they pay.
If you lose, you pay.

406
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,869
You're explaining how it works to me?
- No. I...

407
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:46,080
You know what? To hell with it.
I'll find someone else.

408
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,332
I figured I could rely on you,
you were my friend, but I was wrong.

409
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,042
No, you're not wrong.
- I was wrong.

410
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:52,352
I'm your guy.

411
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:56,729
Just let me have a little something
to hold Ron off.

412
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:01,762
Guy's got a lot of balls
calling my pal up in the middle of the night.

413
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:04,556
Maybe I'll call him up.
Threaten to have his ass thrown in jail.

414
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:07,392
No. No.
He didn't mean anything by it.

415
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,978
I mean,
this'll put his mind right at ease.

416
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:13,732
These guys don't give a damn about me.
The cops, they all love Pete Rose.

417
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:16,693
It's scumbags like Ron Delaplane
they wanna throw in jail.

418
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:20,072
Now, he ought to keep that in mind
next time he wants to pick up a phone.

419
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:23,659
You know what? Forget I said it.
It's water under the bridge.

420
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,678
OK. So, um...

421
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:29,289
What's the line on the Celtics tonight?

422
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,416
Huh?

423
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:31,708
I'll find out.
- Good.

424
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:35,587
OK. Be quick about it. The game starts
at 7:30, and I want to get ten dimes on it.

425
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,662
Ten?
- Ten. What? I got a stutter?

426
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:43,262
Hey. How do you get a blonde
to laugh on a Wednesday?

427
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:45,864
Tell her a joke on Monday.

428
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:51,787
Hey. Get down on the Lakers,
too. That one's a lock.

429
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,817
They're all a lock until the game's over.
- Oh, Paul, come on.

430
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,986
You know I can't watch a game
unless I got something riding on it.

431
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:02,061
I ain't got no hobbies.
It's sports.

432
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,634
When I was a boy,
before I went to bed,

433
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,370
my old man made me take 100 swings
from the left, 100 from the right.

434
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,875
You know why? He knew if I didn't make it
in baseball, I wasn't going nowhere.

435
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:17,395
That's the way it's always been.
It's all or nothing.

436
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:21,358
We'll get 'em tonight, Pete.
- OK.

437
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:23,441
Thanks.

438
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:27,639
Right there, a fountain. With flowers.
- Oh, I want a fountain.

439
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,808
Katarina, honey, we have to go.

440
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,351
Oh. Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

441
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:34,730
Hi. Sorry, Carol. Nice to see you.
- Hi, Paulie. It's OK. Good to see you, too.

442
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,982
Uh... Thank you.
- All right.

443
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,860
Let's have lunch next week. Call me.
- OK. Bye.

444
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Bye.

445
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:51,722
There you go.

446
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:57,711
Your boss should only bet
on things he knows.

447
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:58,670
Huh?

448
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:02,716
I say something, you say 'huh? '
What are you? Deaf?

449
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:05,010
You want Pete to bet on baseball?

450
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,054
He don't manage
a hockey team, Einstein.

451
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,680
So what can I get ya?
- Coffee, black.

452
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,780
OK.

453
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:15,042
We'll have the rest next week.

454
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:22,277
Pete won't cross that line. It's something
he'd never do. Bet on his own sport.

455
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:26,712
You're so dumb,
you shouldn't be allowed to breathe.

456
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:30,997
You find that amusing?
- No, of course not.

457
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,579
Then why are you laughing, goof?

458
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,334
I guess it made me nervous,
you saying that.

459
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,560
Come here.
Come here.

460
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,924
Let me explain something to you, Paul.

461
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:48,095
You place bets with me for Pete.
I take that action, I lay it off in New York.

462
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:52,057
When Pete doesn't pay me, I gotta come
up with his losses outta my own pocket.

463
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:56,228
If I don't pay them, I'm outta business,
and that's the least of my problems.

464
00:33:56,328 --> 00:34:00,774
See how it works now?
How you factor into the equation?

465
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:02,735
Yeah. I've got it.
- Good.

466
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:06,029
Well then, you tell number 14
to get into lockstep with reality.

467
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,407
'Cause no one's gonna touch him
while he's wearing the uniform,

468
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:12,162
but once that day is done,
it's open season.

469
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:16,557
As for you, big guy,
it's always open.

470
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:20,544
There.

471
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:23,230
Now you can see.

472
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:46,278
You should see yourself.
- Huh?

473
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:48,378
What?

474
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:51,283
Have you ever even
thought about cooling it?

475
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:53,744
I'm on a...
Honey, I'm on a roll, you know?

476
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:58,082
I'll slow down a little. Don't worry.
- Pete, take it down a lot.

477
00:34:58,182 --> 00:35:01,085
And if I smell another Annie on you,
we'll meet up in divorce court.

478
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:05,130
OK, honey. I promise I will. Both. Here.
Go buy yourself something nice, OK?

479
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,258
Right, shopping.
Yeah, that solves everything.

480
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:10,469
We're going in circles, Pete.

481
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,864
Carol. Who am I hurting?
Tell me who.

482
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
Me.

483
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:19,728
Yourself.
Are you completely blind?

484
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:22,064
I like the action, Carol.
You knew that from the jump.

485
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:23,857
But this is different.
- Are we hurting for money?

486
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:25,984
No, but it's not about that.
- We have two beautiful homes,

487
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,278
a tennis court, horses.
- So what? I don't care.

488
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:32,658
I drive a Rolls-Royce. I earn this money
selling my stuff to my fans.

489
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:36,078
I wanna have a little fun with it,
what's wrong with it? What's the big deal?

490
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:38,163
Baby, what's the big deal?

491
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:41,166
You're gonna do
whatever you want anyway.

492
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,936
Hey, Carol.
Take it. Take it.

493
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:47,397
Come on, Carol.
For me.

494
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:50,175
I'm happy
when you spend money on yourself.

495
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:52,428
Better me than the bookies, huh?

496
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:54,221
Hey, look.

497
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:57,558
I ever dip into our savings
or sell something we need,

498
00:35:57,658 --> 00:35:59,518
you come down hard on me.
OK?

499
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:03,397
Until then it's just, you know, play money.
- Like Monopoly.

500
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:07,793
Yeah, that's right.
You know I love you, baby.

501
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:10,963
No one else means shit to me.

502
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:14,967
I guess I must love you.
- You guess?

503
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:20,193
You don't make it easy.
- What's easy that's worth anything?

504
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,697
We've got Kal Daniels leading off,
playing left.

505
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:39,593
Larkin, Parker,
Davis and Bell...

506
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:43,539
Sure you wanna do this?
- Just place the bets.

507
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:47,434
...and Diaz, Francona,
Oester and Browning.

508
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:50,003
I hope you know what you're doing.

509
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:52,103
Paul.

510
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:58,111
Come here.

511
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:02,808
I'm just betting on my own guys,
not against them. Where's the harm?

512
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:06,145
It's so against the rules, it's not funny.
- Oh, to hell with the rules.

513
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:08,730
I'm creating a sure-thing situation here.

514
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,900
I'm just gonna want them to win
even more. I'll manage even better.

515
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,947
Think about it. Come on, think about it.
- Guess I didn't look at it that way.

516
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:20,659
Yeah, this just proves
how much I believe in my team.

517
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:25,456
I'd be an idiot to bet against myself. Huh?
- I just don't want you to get hurt, that's all.

518
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:31,846
No one's gonna get hurt, Paulie. See?
No one's gonna know the wiser, right?

519
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:36,275
Come on.
I'm number 14, baby.

520
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:39,570
Who's better than us?
Huh?

521
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:41,864
Yeah.

522
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:44,837
Oh, you watch how we play tonight.

523
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:48,187
Watch how we play.
Like nine Pete Roses out there.

524
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:50,287
Nine Pete Roses.

525
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:01,492
Ball.

526
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:04,737
Come on, Tom.
Get over the damn plate.

527
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:22,554
Ball four.

528
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:25,240
Scott.
Get Murphy up.

529
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:28,268
You sure you wanna use him, Pete?
He threw awfully hard last night.

530
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:32,272
We're up by three. It would be a shame
to waste a guy if we really don't have to.

531
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:36,902
I'm not letting Browning blow this game.
- Well, what about Hume? He's rested.

532
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:40,072
I said Murphy.
Don't second-guess me, Scott. Come on.

533
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:43,657
It's my job to win games,
not to blow 'em.

534
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:47,234
The wreck
has also become home to...

535
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:54,586
...forever etched in the minds
of baseball fans as all-time greats.

536
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:58,257
Joining them in immortality
is the great Peter Edward Rose.

537
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:01,510
No one will ever forget Rose
running right through catcher Ray Fosse...

538
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,846
in 1970's midsummer classic.

539
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:07,141
It was only an All-Star exhibition,
but there was a winning run to be scored,

540
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:10,602
and Charlie Hustle didn't care
who or what was in his way.

541
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:14,773
Pete Rose only knew one way
to play the game - all-out, all the time.

542
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:18,836
Full measure for every one
of the 4,256 hits...

543
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:21,613
that assured his place
among baseball's best ever...

544
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:24,688
in the hallowed hallways of Coop...

545
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:30,906
Busy Friday here.
Couple of day games to tell you about.

546
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:35,669
Scoreboard's out, skip.
- What do you mean, 'out? '

547
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,713
It's broke.
They're working on it.

548
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:40,841
Something electrical, I guess.
I mean, after all, it's just a big TV.

549
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:43,469
It's no hassle to us.
It's more of a fan thing.

550
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,721
Well, I hope they don't take long
in getting it fixed.

551
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:47,821
Yeah.

552
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:59,209
Something else?
- Yeah.

553
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:07,743
How long we known each other, Pete?
Twenty, twenty-five years?

554
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:10,245
Give or take.
- Yeah. All that time.

555
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:15,459
We've seen a lot of players come and go,
huh? Some good, some not so good.

556
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,002
But what always broke my heart...

557
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:20,964
was when one of the real greats
did something - you know -...

558
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:25,986
got involved in something
that tarnished their reputation.

559
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:30,516
Are you fishing for something, Tom?
- Nah.

560
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,951
Tom. No.

561
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:42,194
I got nothing but respect for you, Pete.

562
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,922
Just wanted you to know that.

563
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:48,258
Tom.
- Yeah?

564
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:54,206
What do you say we go see
those big repairmen, get that TV fixed?

565
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:58,435
All right. Come on. Let's go.

566
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:16,368
Stee.

567
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:27,337
Let's go, Dave.

568
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:31,343
OK. OK.
Thank you.

569
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:47,482
Stee.

570
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:58,743
You're out.

571
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:20,250
No one's down here.
This guy's way left.

572
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:24,685
That's a foul.
- Foul. Going the other way.

573
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:28,801
Oh. Nice shot, nice shot.
Now you gotta get up.

574
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:32,988
Oh, damn.
Son of a...

575
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:39,369
How much this time?

576
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:44,499
I'm going to bed.

577
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:48,420
Hey, where you been, baby?
- Out.

578
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:53,258
Get 'em next time.

579
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:55,344
Why not?

580
00:43:57,221 --> 00:43:59,456
We're gonna go shopping.
You like shopping, right?

581
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:05,421
Come on, help me open the door.
There you go. We're gonna go shopping.

582
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:10,984
Yeah, Dada.
- Dada.

583
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:15,013
Hello.

584
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:18,684
Hey, what kind of a way is that to start off
a conversation? 'I want my money. '

585
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:23,021
It's Ronnie. Huh? Oh look.
No, no, no, no. You've got it all wrong here.

586
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:24,857
It's Paulie.

587
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:26,957
Yeah, Janszen.

588
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:29,653
He's been placing all kinds of crazy bets
all over town and laying them off on me.

589
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:31,739
I think he's got
a screw loose or something.

590
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,242
Oh, no. I wouldn't mess with him.
He's like 110 percent crazy, believe me.

591
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:40,264
I seen him almost kill a guy once.
Yeah... He hung up.

592
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:43,584
Do you know what you just did?
The position you just put me in?

593
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:45,461
He's scared shitless.
What are you worried about?

594
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:47,629
Jeez, Pete.
That guy's connected.

595
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:50,007
He's like in the Mafia or something.
- Mafia?

596
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:52,593
That's movie crap.
These bums are a bunch of pansies.

597
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:56,764
No. I've seen the look in Ronnie's eye,
you know? He means business.

598
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:59,683
What? Are you a pussy?
Are you a big pussy, Paulie?

599
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:02,077
All show and no go?

600
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,562
Hm?

601
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:05,814
Pete,
why are you talking to me like that?

602
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:09,401
I've been dealing with scum
like Ron Delaplane my whole life, all right?

603
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:12,529
It's his job to threaten me.
You know, say he'll cut me off.

604
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:15,115
But the thing is, what are these jerks
gonna do without guys like me?

605
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:18,660
I'm their bread and butter.
I'm the reason he's in business, see?

606
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,454
He's gonna get his money.
I just wanna make him sweat...

607
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:23,165
and make him
remember who's the boss.

608
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:25,265
See?

609
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:31,215
Come on, Paulie.
Who's better than us, huh?

610
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:33,734
Tell me who.

611
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:36,070
Yo, buddy.
I'm waiting here.

612
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,657
All right.

613
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:03,138
Safe.

614
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:50,252
He makes millions every year.
- Just for a few weeks. His money's tied up.

615
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:52,546
Carol's on him like a hawk.
- Oh, like she doesn't have reason to.

616
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:54,339
Why do you think
he blew off Gio, huh?

617
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:56,675
I told you I don't want you talking to him.
- Pete owes him a fortune.

618
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:58,177
Gio's a full-of-shit druggie.

619
00:46:58,277 --> 00:47:02,347
Maybe he got sick of being stepped on.
- He's my best friend in the world.

620
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:06,685
Maybe he'd had enough of Pete's lies.
- How could you even think he'd stiff me?

621
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:09,855
I don't have your faith in human nature.

622
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:12,357
Let's not talk about this ever again.

623
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:15,262
I hope we don't have a reason to.

624
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:26,747
The memorabilia biz
not so hot these days?

625
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:30,209
Just running a little short.
You know how it is.

626
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:32,044
Look,
you don't gotta play cute with me.

627
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:35,255
That jerk burned me for 75 Gs
on that piece-of-shit Beamer of his.

628
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:37,758
Frigging engine was scrap metal.

629
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:40,385
You really think Pete knew that?

630
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:43,555
I think number 14
looks out for number one, is what I think.

631
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:45,949
Well, don't we all?

632
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:49,927
What have you got here? 50?
- Yeah.

633
00:47:52,497 --> 00:47:56,360
Number 14's into everybody.
You know that, right?

634
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,712
Me, Gio, Mike.

635
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:03,242
The thing is, when you're Pete Rose,
you don't gotta pay schmucks like us back.

636
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:07,413
'Cause we're just mortals. And he's
the guy who broke Ty Cobb's record.

637
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:10,624
That's the difference right there,
Steng, see?

638
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:16,589
I don't consider myself a schmuck.
And Pete doesn't treat me like one.

639
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:23,195
Yeah, when I was a kid
I believed in fairy tales, too.

640
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:26,492
Did you ever settle up
with you know who?

641
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:29,567
No.
He still owes me about 12 grand.

642
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:33,492
So, how much did he pay you?
- Nothing.

643
00:49:33,557 --> 00:49:35,876
He signed a bunch of autographs for me,
you know, to sell.

644
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:40,798
Yeah. I'm getting the same thing.
But just until he gets the money.

645
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:43,175
Take it while you can.
It's better than catz.

646
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:44,009
What?

647
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:47,154
Catz. Nothing, nada, zip.

648
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:48,972
Uh, w-w...

649
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:52,518
What about the guys where you are? The
bookies. How much does he owe them?

650
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:56,230
Whoa, whoa. Don't talk like that
on the phone. I hate that.

651
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:00,901
All right, all right.
How much does he owe you? Owe them?

652
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:04,321
Between the two of us? Me and them,
about two, two-and-a-quarter.

653
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:07,032
What?
- I ain't repeating it, Paulie.

654
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:08,617
Jeez, Mikey.

655
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:10,953
We're forgetting them.
He's just gonna take care of me now.

656
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:12,746
What do you mean,
'you're forgetting them? '

657
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:14,581
We're forgetting them.
They don't get nothing.

658
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:18,710
No, Mikey, you can't do that.
You're gonna have people after him.

659
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:22,172
This is what he's gonna do.
I got no control, all right?

660
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:25,217
How does he not give a shit?
- What are they gonna do, Paulie?

661
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:28,220
Are they gonna whack number 14?
They've made enough off him already.

662
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:33,600
What am I gonna do, Mikey? I'm going
broke. I can't pay my rent with autographs.

663
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,853
Cut him off.
You got no choice.

664
00:50:35,953 --> 00:50:41,792
I just... I feel responsible for him.
I can't understand it.

665
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:46,488
That's the thing about our guy. He makes
you think the opposite of what you should.

666
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:49,074
It's a powerful thing,
being around someone so famous.

667
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:52,574
It's like sunlight.
You wanna stay in it.

668
00:51:14,575 --> 00:51:16,268
Hey.

669
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:20,522
Where the hell you been?
You're like the Phantom all of a sudden.

670
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:23,734
We have to talk, Pete.
- Hey, grab that hose for me, will ya?

671
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:26,195
Man, did I take a bath last night.
Those damn Pistons,

672
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:28,405
they should be lined up and shot.

673
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:32,259
We'll get it back.
We'll get it next time.

674
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:35,954
I don't think there's gonna be
a next time for me, Pete.

675
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:38,689
Turn the water on.
Not too hard.

676
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:42,961
You know, I've been giving something
a lot of thought.

677
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:46,356
If I had enough riding on a game,

678
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:50,819
I mean a really fat bet,
I'd think about throwing it.

679
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:55,557
I mean,
there's easy ways to do it, you know?

680
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:57,893
I could pinch hit a guy at the wrong time
or hit and run at the wrong time.

681
00:51:57,993 --> 00:52:00,437
Do you hear what you're saying?

682
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:04,316
I'm saying it's easy. That's exactly
what I'm saying. Nothing else.

683
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:07,403
Is this like another one
of Ron's great ideas?

684
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:12,263
It ain't an idea.
It's just a thought, Paulie, a thought.

685
00:52:13,592 --> 00:52:17,587
Pete, this is all getting
to be too much for me.

686
00:52:19,056 --> 00:52:22,116
I can't handle it.
The pressure of...

687
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:26,313
Look, nothing bothers you.

688
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:28,757
You know, I'm not like that.
- Oh, yeah?

689
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:31,677
So we're not buddies anymore?
Is that it?

690
00:52:31,777 --> 00:52:34,613
No.
No, of course not.

691
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:38,100
Pete, you know I'd do anything for you.
I'd go to the wall.

692
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,203
I just...
I need to get away from...

693
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:44,189
I need to get away
from the other stuff, you know?

694
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,375
The betting.

695
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:50,337
It's got me like I can't think straight.

696
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:57,911
I got you something.
You probably don't want it now.

697
00:52:58,011 --> 00:53:00,889
Look at the back.

698
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:09,465
Paulie, my number 1 fan and friend.
Pete Rose.

699
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:11,467
Take it back if you want.
Get something else.

700
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:15,647
The jeweler I got it from,
he's a friend of mine.

701
00:53:16,405 --> 00:53:18,740
I wouldn't.

702
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:22,628
I wouldn't trade it for my life.

703
00:53:23,662 --> 00:53:25,662
Thanks.

704
00:53:27,457 --> 00:53:30,736
Hey, you know what we need? We need
a night on the town, just you and me.

705
00:53:30,836 --> 00:53:36,241
And some fresh tail. What do you say
you come with me to LA this weekend?

706
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:37,910
I'm... I...

707
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,038
It sounds great, but Katarina and all...

708
00:53:41,138 --> 00:53:42,873
Oh, yeah.

709
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:47,019
OK, here.
Put it on. See if it fits.

710
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,213
You can see the moon
and all of its quarters.

711
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:51,924
This is the kind the astronauts wear,
this model.

712
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:55,469
Come on, buddy.
Katarina's gotta get used to it.

713
00:53:55,569 --> 00:53:57,596
You're on the road with me - Pete Rose.

714
00:53:57,696 --> 00:54:01,521
You don't hear Carol complaining,
now, do you?

715
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:06,438
Hey, baby. I got the Roller all shined
and polished for you. Where you going?

716
00:54:06,538 --> 00:54:08,232
Egypt.

717
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:11,084
Bring me back a mummy.

718
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:21,622
You don't think she heard?
- Nah, it's just her goofy sense of humor.

719
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,914
Come on.
Get the stick out of your ass.

720
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:26,792
All work and no play,
you know, whatever that is.

721
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:30,103
Who's better than us?
Tell me who.

722
00:54:30,145 --> 00:54:34,191
Nobody.
- That's right, pal. Nobody.

723
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:36,233
Nobody.

724
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:44,826
Thank you.

725
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:54,586
No.
- Yes. You better come here.

726
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:56,628
Gotcha.

727
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:05,414
Open the door.
- It's my wife.

728
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:08,517
I said open the door, Pete.

729
00:55:09,518 --> 00:55:11,378
Let me in right now.

730
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:14,481
Right now.
- Coming.

731
00:55:14,606 --> 00:55:17,676
Open the door.
I hear you in there. Let me in right now.

732
00:55:17,776 --> 00:55:21,363
OK.
- Open this damn door.

733
00:55:21,446 --> 00:55:25,267
Who is it? I'm coming.
- Open the damn door. Let me in.

734
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:27,394
Carol.
What are you doing in LA, huh?

735
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:30,539
Who is it, huh?
- Carol?

736
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:33,041
W- What are you looking for?

737
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:35,194
Who's next door?
- Paul. You know that.

738
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:37,462
Yeah, Paul?

739
00:55:42,968 --> 00:55:45,688
Katarina would love to see this.

740
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:48,932
Carol, please.

741
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:53,045
I don't wanna see him.
I don't wanna hear his voice on our phone...

742
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:56,715
or see him within a mile of a ballpark or
anywhere else you might be for that matter.

743
00:55:56,815 --> 00:56:00,969
That guy, he is bad news.
He's been nothing but since you met him.

744
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:05,682
This stuff, and this gambling,
it has taken us to a new level.

745
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:08,368
It is out of control, Pete.

746
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:12,497
I accepted it.
But not anymore. It is finished.

747
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:15,501
Finished.
As of right now.

748
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:18,670
I am your wife.
- I know.

749
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:21,089
You remember that.

750
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:29,264
Scott.
- Yeah.

751
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:34,545
If Power tanks again,
I'm sending him down.

752
00:56:34,645 --> 00:56:37,589
You want me to tell him that?
- If you think he'll pitch better, yes.

753
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:40,494
I wouldn't put money on this guy.

754
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,245
Hey, take that for me, will ya?

755
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:48,992
Pete Rose's office.

756
00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:51,311
Yeah, let me see if I can find him.

757
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:54,039
Paul Janszen.

758
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:58,944
He must have stepped out.
I'll let him know that you called.

759
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:01,547
Yeah. OK.

760
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:09,433
He says it's urgent
that you get back to him right away.

761
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:13,767
Pete.

762
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:18,130
Are you OK?

763
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:22,217
Be careful with the friends you pick, Scott.
They can cause you a lot of problems. OK?

764
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:24,736
Go play baseball.

765
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:27,281
Go play baseball, come on.

766
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:41,737
The number you have reached
is no longer in service...

767
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:43,989
and there is no new number
at this time.

768
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:46,216
This is a recording.

769
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,805
The number you have reached
is no longer in service...

770
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:10,259
FBI, Mr. Janszen.
Please open up.

771
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:24,117
Mr. Janszen,
we're not gonna ask nicely again.

772
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:29,635
Uh, just a second.

773
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:42,381
Mr. Paul Janszen?
- You're Mr. Janszen, right?

774
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:43,340
What's this about?

775
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,843
You're under arrest
for the trafficking of illegal substances.

776
00:58:45,943 --> 00:58:49,768
Step back
and put your hands behind your head.

777
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:56,395
You have the right to remain silent.

778
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:59,022
Anything you say
can be used against you in a court of law.

779
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:00,482
You have the right to an attorney.

780
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:03,444
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you by the court.

781
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:07,781
Do you understand your rights
as I have read them to you?

782
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:11,034
The most important thing
for you to keep in mind is this, Paul -...

783
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:13,637
be honest, be forthright.

784
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:17,416
Lying to us is only going to get you
deeper into what is already a bad situation.

785
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:21,587
Perjury, added to narcotics trafficking,
you don't need.

786
00:59:21,687 --> 00:59:25,440
I have no idea what you're talking about.

787
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:30,804
I mean, I've used steroids a few times
before, but, you know, who hasn't?

788
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:33,098
I haven't.
I doubt my partner has.

789
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:35,267
How 'bout your buddy Pete?

790
00:59:35,367 --> 00:59:37,352
Who?
- You know, Pete Rose.

791
00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:40,022
You two are, like, joined at the hip.

792
00:59:40,122 --> 00:59:43,609
I don't know anything about that.
- About what?

793
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:46,737
Whatever it is
you're trying to get me to say.

794
00:59:46,837 --> 00:59:49,239
About anything.
- I'm a little confused.

795
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:53,535
Are you trying to tell us Pete Rose
isn't involved in trafficking drugs with you?

796
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:56,580
What?
- And Don Stenger and Tommy Gioiosa?

797
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,918
Listen carefully, Paul.
You're with us or against us.

798
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:03,353
No in-between.

799
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:29,213
There's no more money.
I used what was left for bail.

800
01:00:29,254 --> 01:00:31,757
You're broke, Paul.

801
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:35,828
How you gonna defend yourself, huh?

802
01:00:35,928 --> 01:00:38,430
How you gonna hire a lawyer?

803
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:45,003
Pete will come through.
- He's the reason you're in this mess.

804
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:48,524
When are you gonna admit that?

805
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:52,361
He's not your friend, Paul,
he never was.

806
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:58,033
He doesn't have friends.
You know, he has people that he uses.

807
01:00:58,116 --> 01:01:00,327
It was more than that.

808
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:03,872
Then where is he now?

809
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:07,860
I mean,
why doesn't he return your phone calls?

810
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,361
Why doesn't he pay you back
your money?

811
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:13,298
I told you a thousand times -...

812
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:16,009
it's his wife.
It's Carol.

813
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:24,293
If you want to keep fooling yourself,
then that's your business.

814
01:01:24,393 --> 01:01:26,895
I don't want any part of it.

815
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:33,316
Katarina.

816
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:43,954
There you go.
- Yeah.

817
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:46,290
Perfect as always, Cathy.

818
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:49,193
So, why don't you call me when
you get tired of that husband of yours?

819
01:01:49,293 --> 01:01:50,903
Oh, I've been tired of him for ten years.

820
01:01:51,003 --> 01:01:55,338
That doesn't mean
I need another bastard in my life.

821
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:05,934
Hi, Pete.

822
01:02:08,437 --> 01:02:12,149
Hey, Paulie.
Where you been hiding yourself?

823
01:02:12,191 --> 01:02:14,943
Can we talk?
- Sure. Of course.

824
01:02:15,027 --> 01:02:20,115
But not right now.
I'm kinda in a rush. Got a game tonight.

825
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:24,269
I'm in a lot of trouble, Pete.
- Yeah? What kind of trouble?

826
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:27,773
I'm talking big trouble,
you know? Federal.

827
01:02:27,873 --> 01:02:30,709
It just happened.
I need a lawyer.

828
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:35,005
I need money, Pete.
I need the money you owe me.

829
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:39,885
Let's take this off the street.

830
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:51,422
Why'd you freeze me out like that?
Was it just the money?

831
01:02:51,522 --> 01:02:55,347
You know me -
I don't give a shit about money.

832
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:58,403
Maybe a little.

833
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:01,056
Women, Paulie, they're like elephants.
They never forget.

834
01:03:01,156 --> 01:03:03,976
Carol's had a bug up her ass about you
ever since I almost got caught...

835
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:05,894
testing the wrong oil.

836
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:08,981
She knows I fool around - hell, I've been on
the road half my life, what do you expect? -...

837
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:11,775
but every once in a while,
you know, she's got to put on a big show.

838
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:17,239
Shove it down my throat. She's Mrs.
Pete Rose, not some floozy I'm banging.

839
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:18,866
You just got caught in the middle,
that's all.

840
01:03:18,966 --> 01:03:21,618
I wish you would have
just been upfront with me all this time.

841
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:24,388
I have been.
Carol's my wife.

842
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:27,916
She's my wife. It's like they say -
a rock and a hard place.

843
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:32,796
OK, but I just really need the money,
though. Can I have the money?

844
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:36,592
How much you need?
- The full 30K. What you owe.

845
01:03:36,692 --> 01:03:39,497
Whoa.
That's a big number, Paulie.

846
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:40,804
You figure it different?

847
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:46,852
I'm just saying it's a whole lot of cash
to come up with, like, out of the blue.

848
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:51,190
I'm not going to jail, Pete. And I don't want
anybody else to go to jail, either.

849
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:53,584
OK.

850
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:56,503
Come on, stop dancing.
Say it.

851
01:03:57,713 --> 01:04:01,623
OK. If I don't have a good lawyer,
I'm screwed.

852
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:07,519
Now, I don't want to cooperate,
but if I have to, I will.

853
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:10,934
Don't worry.

854
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:17,841
Hey, go see Roger, my lawyer,
tomorrow afternoon. I'll set it up.

855
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:21,511
I'll make sure
he takes care of everything.

856
01:04:22,654 --> 01:04:29,029
I knew I could count on you, Pete.
- Come on. Whose better than us, right?

857
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:37,628
Thanks, buddy.

858
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:47,413
Pete contacted me about your problem.

859
01:04:47,513 --> 01:04:51,208
He's always been a loyal friend and,
to be quite honest, against my advice...

860
01:04:51,308 --> 01:04:53,460
he's decided to help you out.

861
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:58,273
Pete has a big heart, on and off the field.
Always has.

862
01:04:58,357 --> 01:05:01,176
I appreciate Pete's friendship,
but, uh,

863
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:05,055
in all honesty,
this is money he borrowed from me.

864
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:07,724
Excuse me for being so impertinent,
but why on earth...

865
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:12,479
would my client need to borrow money
from you or anyone else, for that matter?

866
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:19,124
I don't think we should get into that.
- Please, you've piqued my curiosity.

867
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:22,072
Your client
has a major gambling problem.

868
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:27,261
Is that so? And how do you come by
such intimate knowledge?

869
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:30,064
I'm the guy who placed his bets.

870
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:38,046
What's this?
- Pure generosity.

871
01:05:38,146 --> 01:05:40,549
My client has assured me
he doesn't owe you a penny,

872
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:44,729
but he's agreed to loan you
ten thousand dollars.

873
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:48,927
He's gonna loan me
ten thousand dollars?

874
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:52,661
That sick bastard owes me 30 grand.

875
01:05:53,245 --> 01:05:58,750
30 thousand dollars.
Do you understand me, you little prick?

876
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:02,354
Your client is a gambling degenerate.

877
01:06:02,421 --> 01:06:05,491
He bets on his own sport,
that's how sick he is.

878
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:08,141
Please, Mr. Janszen, sit down.

879
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:11,386
OK.

880
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:21,148
What happened?
What's wrong? Paul?

881
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:26,416
That son of a bitch
just made the biggest mistake of his life.

882
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:17,438
Pete.

883
01:07:17,538 --> 01:07:19,538
Carol.

884
01:07:27,506 --> 01:07:29,506
Pete.

885
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:14,078
You can't just waltz into people's houses
and take things.

886
01:08:14,178 --> 01:08:16,371
There's a law against that.
It's called 'breaking and entering. '

887
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:20,334
Like I said before, I used my key.
Pete gave it to me a long time ago.

888
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:22,294
So what's this?
- His betting sheets.

889
01:08:22,394 --> 01:08:26,465
We don't give a damn about gambling.
We told you that. This is about narcotics.

890
01:08:26,565 --> 01:08:29,635
The R stands for 'Reds. '
- He bet on his own team?

891
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:32,387
For years, and big.
'2' is for two grand.

892
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:34,765
Well, that's a major league
baseball problem, not yours.

893
01:08:34,865 --> 01:08:41,495
Your problems, Paul, are why we're here,
and what you should be worrying about.

894
01:08:59,598 --> 01:09:01,166
So?

895
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:02,960
So I wanted you to know...

896
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:07,965
that all that shit about me placing bets
in Pete's name was a lie.

897
01:09:08,065 --> 01:09:09,967
I mean, every bet was his.

898
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:12,957
My mother didn't raise any morons.

899
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:17,398
Did he ever make good?
- The bat. I got the bat.

900
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:19,726
The one he broke Cobb's record with.

901
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:22,187
I hate to tell you,
but there's a lot of them around.

902
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:28,318
The jerk I sold it to don't know that.
What's the point of this little get-together?

903
01:09:28,418 --> 01:09:33,688
I wanted to know if you'd be interested
in some other business.

904
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:38,136
Something very profitable.
- Get to the point.

905
01:09:39,805 --> 01:09:43,000
I got a source
get me all the steroids I want.

906
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,545
If the price is right,
I could be interested.

907
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:49,439
I was hoping you'd say that.

908
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,205
You like living, don't you, Paul?

909
01:10:11,128 --> 01:10:13,255
Look into my eyes.

910
01:10:17,176 --> 01:10:19,981
That's right.
There's nobody home.

911
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:26,685
Yeah, yeah.
OK. Bye.

912
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:41,433
Yeah, hello.
- Mikey. You there?

913
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:43,268
I ain't on the moon.

914
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:48,457
I just wanted to warn you.
Get ready to duck.

915
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:50,943
What the hell are you talking about?

916
01:10:51,043 --> 01:10:56,156
I always liked you, and that's
the only reason that I'm making this call.

917
01:10:56,256 --> 01:11:00,661
Just... Just trust me here.
The shit's gonna hit the fan.

918
01:11:00,761 --> 01:11:04,331
Hey, Paulie, I don't like this kinda talk.

919
01:11:05,682 --> 01:11:08,502
Consider yourself lucky we're having it.

920
01:11:08,602 --> 01:11:11,230
Paulie.
Paulie, listen to me...

921
01:11:34,837 --> 01:11:36,964
Wanna get that?

922
01:11:37,047 --> 01:11:39,047
Nope.

923
01:11:42,761 --> 01:11:46,586
Please leave
a message after the beep. Thanks.

924
01:11:46,682 --> 01:11:48,375
What the hell's going on, Paulie?

925
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:52,504
I just talked to Mike. What's all this'Get
ready to duck'crap you're talking about?

926
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:55,340
I really hope you're not doing
something you're gonna regret.

927
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,901
Call me back right away.

928
01:11:57,985 --> 01:12:00,320
He sounds panicked.

929
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:05,868
You OK?

930
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:07,951
Yeah.

931
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:11,248
It feels good -...

932
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:13,750
not fooling myself anymore.

933
01:12:23,427 --> 01:12:26,346
Is your name Paul Janszen?
- Yes.

934
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:29,249
Were you once employed
at the Queen City Barrel Company?

935
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:30,375
Yes.

936
01:12:30,475 --> 01:12:33,437
Are you still employed there?

937
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,172
No.

938
01:12:35,272 --> 01:12:37,508
Have you ever sold
or knowingly associated...

939
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:40,694
with people who sold illegal drugs?

940
01:12:44,406 --> 01:12:46,183
Yes.

941
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:50,078
Did you ever sell drugs to Pete Rose?

942
01:12:50,162 --> 01:12:52,206
No.

943
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:57,444
Did Pete Rose ever knowingly associate
with people who sold illegal drugs?

944
01:12:57,544 --> 01:12:59,279
Yes.

945
01:12:59,379 --> 01:13:04,076
Was Pete Rose aware
that you yourself had dealt illegal drugs?

946
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:05,702
Yes.

947
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:09,873
Did Pete Rose ever bet
on the Cincinnati Reds baseball team?

948
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:11,973
Yes.

949
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:18,220
Did you yourself place bets for Pete Rose
on major league baseball games?

950
01:13:21,026 --> 01:13:23,026
Yes.

951
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:36,400
Major League Baseball.
Mr. Ueberroth's office.

952
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,237
No, I'm sorry.
Mr. Ueberroth is in a meeting right now.

953
01:13:40,337 --> 01:13:42,197
OK. I will.

954
01:13:42,297 --> 01:13:44,297
Thank you. Bye.

955
01:13:52,474 --> 01:13:55,627
How long we supposed to wait, huh?
What's this? An audience with the Pope?

956
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:58,505
He's the damned baseball commissioner,
not the president.

957
01:13:58,605 --> 01:14:00,649
Pete, listen to me.

958
01:14:00,732 --> 01:14:04,636
The commissioner didn't call you up here
to waste your time. This is serious.

959
01:14:04,736 --> 01:14:08,532
Yeah.
I'm serious, too.

960
01:14:08,615 --> 01:14:10,267
Peter.
- Hello, Pete. How are you?

961
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:13,479
Nice bunch of pictures on the wall outside.
Why aren't I up there?

962
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:17,024
This is Ed Durso, our chief operating
officer and long time counsel.

963
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:18,192
You know Fay, of course.
- Hi.

964
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:19,777
And Bart Giamatti,
our commissioner elect.

965
01:14:19,877 --> 01:14:21,737
How are you?
- Congratulations. Better you than me.

966
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:23,322
I got my hands full
just running the team.

967
01:14:23,422 --> 01:14:24,907
Glad you could make it
on such short notice.

968
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:26,283
Well, I hate to leave my guys, but...

969
01:14:26,383 --> 01:14:28,202
Well, we appreciate it, Pete.
All of us.

970
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:33,290
This shouldn't take long.
- I got a short attention span, I hope not.

971
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,751
All right, Pete. What we need,
the reason we asked you in today...

972
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:38,337
concerns the allegations
about your gambling.

973
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:41,412
I'll lay five to one it's all bull.

974
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:48,388
Well, we heard that Sports Illustrated
is about to run a rather unflattering story.

975
01:14:48,488 --> 01:14:51,850
Which contains nothing
but utter false accusations.

976
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,852
I don't doubt it.
And one of the sources, Paul Janszen,

977
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:55,938
is rather disreputable,
to put it mildly.

978
01:14:56,038 --> 01:14:59,566
He's a flat-out liar.
- I don't doubt that's true.

979
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:03,779
Well, Pete, how would you describe
your relationship with Mr. Janszen?

980
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:09,076
Relationship? There was none. He was a...
How would you say? A gofer.

981
01:15:09,176 --> 01:15:11,203
He ran errands.
You know how it is with these guys -...

982
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:13,956
you're nice to 'em, then they start to
imagine they're your best friend and then...

983
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:17,167
You know: Don't get too close to the help.
- Exactly.

984
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:19,920
It was my big heart
landed me in the shitter.

985
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:24,508
So we can take it that the allegations
you bet on baseball are entirely false?

986
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:27,903
Commissioner, never.

987
01:15:27,986 --> 01:15:30,614
Not once in my life.

988
01:15:30,697 --> 01:15:32,824
I'd have to be insane.

989
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:38,814
I'd have to be the dumbest son of a bitch
in the whole world to do that.

990
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:44,361
Well, nothing could be more damaging
to the fabric of our national pastime...

991
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:46,461
than illicit gambling.

992
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:50,617
I agree with you 110 per cent, Bart, which
is why I don't bet on baseball, gentlemen,

993
01:15:50,717 --> 01:15:53,428
and I never will.

994
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:57,374
But you do go to the track quite often,
that's fair to say, isn't it?

995
01:15:57,474 --> 01:15:59,251
When I was about this big, Fay,

996
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:02,045
my dad used to take me to the track
for the sport of it.

997
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:04,355
He couldn't afford to bet.

998
01:16:04,356 --> 01:16:09,319
Now I take my son,
and one day my son will take his son.

999
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:11,996
And that doesn't mean it's bad.

1000
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:16,743
Guys, if it was bad,
I just wouldn't do it.

1001
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:24,193
Well, Pete,
we just thought it best to clear the air.

1002
01:16:24,293 --> 01:16:26,278
We'll call you
if we have any other questions.

1003
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:29,406
OK. We all got enough to do without
worrying about what some moron says.

1004
01:16:29,506 --> 01:16:30,491
Right, Peter?
- Right.

1005
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:34,011
OK. Thank you.
Bart. Fay, Ed.

1006
01:16:34,094 --> 01:16:38,415
Oh, don't forget about my picture, OK?
- Bye, gentlemen.

1007
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:40,584
So long, Pete.
- So, what do you think?

1008
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:43,295
Like he said, he'd have to be insane.
I believe him.

1009
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:45,547
I do, too, actually.
- I don't disagree.

1010
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:48,717
But as long as you have these accusations
with such gravity...

1011
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:51,320
Yeah.
That article.

1012
01:16:51,403 --> 01:16:53,722
It's gonna create a certain climate.
- Right.

1013
01:16:53,822 --> 01:16:56,683
Maybe it's time to bring in John Dowd.
- Do you think he's the right guy?

1014
01:16:56,783 --> 01:17:01,730
Well, he prosecuted the Mob for the
Justice Department. I think it's a good idea.

1015
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:04,316
Mr. Dowd. A pleasure to meet you, sir.
- And you.

1016
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:06,710
My associate.

1017
01:17:08,504 --> 01:17:12,116
Materials I've gathered
from Janszen on Rose.

1018
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:14,676
Checks signed by Rose.

1019
01:17:20,516 --> 01:17:23,236
Hello, Ron.
Thanks for coming in.

1020
01:17:32,778 --> 01:17:36,181
Pete, did anyone in association with you
bet on baseball...

1021
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:40,477
or talk about betting on baseball
between 1985 and 1987?

1022
01:17:40,577 --> 01:17:42,563
I don't know what you mean,
'talk about betting on baseball, '...

1023
01:17:42,663 --> 01:17:45,553
but no one bet baseball around me.

1024
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:49,194
Pete, you previously testified
that you did no gambling business...

1025
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:51,405
with anyone
other than Janszen at the track.

1026
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:54,883
That's correct.
- All right.

1027
01:17:54,925 --> 01:18:00,806
Pete, the Reds played Atlanta
on April 28, 1987. A 7:35 game.

1028
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:04,752
Phone records show Paul Janszen
called Ron Delaplane that same day...

1029
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:08,188
at 5:59, 6:16 and 6:43,

1030
01:18:08,272 --> 01:18:13,032
then called the Reds clubhouse
at 6:45 and again at 6:55.

1031
01:18:14,194 --> 01:18:16,780
He called five times?
Hm.

1032
01:18:16,864 --> 01:18:19,558
Do you know what that telephone traffic
is all about?

1033
01:18:19,658 --> 01:18:21,869
No. No idea.

1034
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:24,938
You're aware that Paul Janszen
has testified that he bet on baseball?

1035
01:18:25,038 --> 01:18:27,316
Bet on the Cincinnati Reds for you?

1036
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:30,402
I'm sure he probably did,
from reading the trouble he's in.

1037
01:18:30,502 --> 01:18:33,781
You know,
people have a tendency to say things...

1038
01:18:33,881 --> 01:18:36,200
when their ass is on the chopping block.

1039
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,619
Perhaps we should take a break.

1040
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,330
My client's been answering questions
for hours.

1041
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:44,850
I'm OK.
I'm fine.

1042
01:18:44,933 --> 01:18:47,377
I just want to get it over with.

1043
01:18:47,477 --> 01:18:50,923
Pete, what if I were to tell you that we have
physical evidence that directly links you...

1044
01:18:51,023 --> 01:18:53,258
to numerous wagers
placed over a period of months...

1045
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:56,261
on football, basketball,
hockey and baseball games?

1046
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:57,805
I...

1047
01:18:57,905 --> 01:18:59,515
I might have...

1048
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:02,768
I might have bet
the occasional football game,

1049
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:07,831
but never in my life
did I bet on baseball.

1050
01:19:08,207 --> 01:19:11,437
Never bet on baseball?
- Never. Ever.

1051
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:16,922
Not once.

1052
01:19:18,675 --> 01:19:22,621
Pete, we have phone records
of Paul Janszen, Mike Bertolini,

1053
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:25,666
calls placed from your home phone,
from the Reds' clubhouse,

1054
01:19:25,766 --> 01:19:28,752
betting slips with your handwriting on 'em,
numerous canceled checks.

1055
01:19:28,852 --> 01:19:31,657
I'm gonna say this one more time.

1056
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:40,864
I never bet on baseball...

1057
01:19:40,906 --> 01:19:43,367
in my whole life.

1058
01:19:43,408 --> 01:19:46,553
Not from the clubhouse,
from New York,

1059
01:19:46,578 --> 01:19:49,064
from New England,
from New Mexico.

1060
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:51,291
From nowhere.

1061
01:19:57,047 --> 01:19:59,491
If I'm guilty of anything
in this whole mess,

1062
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:06,265
it's from being
a horseshit selector of friends.

1063
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:24,030
It's all there.

1064
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:28,312
Is there any doubt in your mind
that Rose bet on baseball?

1065
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:31,123
None whatsoever.

1066
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:44,511
How'd it go?
- What are those?

1067
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:47,164
Flowers.
- Well, I know that much.

1068
01:20:47,264 --> 01:20:49,808
Azaleas.
Beautiful, huh?

1069
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:52,853
Strong and tenacious.

1070
01:20:52,936 --> 01:20:56,632
Roger's still in the dark.
You'd think after all these months,

1071
01:20:56,732 --> 01:20:59,301
Giamatti'd be just as anxious as me
to bury this whole mess.

1072
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:02,971
I mean, what are they waiting for, Carol,
huh? For me to become an old man?

1073
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:06,934
You are an old man.
- Watch out. I'll prove you wrong.

1074
01:21:07,034 --> 01:21:07,976
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1075
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:09,812
There's a reason
they call me Charlie Hustle, you know.

1076
01:21:09,912 --> 01:21:12,789
I heard a rumor about that once.

1077
01:21:16,126 --> 01:21:18,487
When this whole mess is over,

1078
01:21:18,587 --> 01:21:21,052
we should take a trip, honey.

1079
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,840
Europe, maybe.

1080
01:21:24,176 --> 01:21:27,704
How about Japan?
They like baseball in Japan.

1081
01:21:27,804 --> 01:21:32,768
Give them a chance
to meet a real baseball hero.

1082
01:21:47,074 --> 01:21:49,309
OK, Bart.
I got it. I understand.

1083
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:53,605
We're in sync.
I'll talk to Pete and we'll get back later.

1084
01:21:53,705 --> 01:21:56,083
Come on, already.
Come on.

1085
01:21:56,166 --> 01:22:00,963
OK. Listen carefully
because this is the best we can do.

1086
01:22:01,046 --> 01:22:04,116
According to the agreement,
you will be banned from baseball,

1087
01:22:04,216 --> 01:22:06,702
reviewable after one year.
Please, both of you, hear me out.

1088
01:22:06,802 --> 01:22:09,246
Yeah, OK. What about
the betting on baseball stuff? I mean...

1089
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:12,124
There'll be no finding.
- W-What's that mean?

1090
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:14,710
Giamatti said MLB
won't rule one way or another.

1091
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:17,254
It's a dead issue.
They won't bring it up.

1092
01:22:17,354 --> 01:22:21,216
The ban is for gambling on other sports,
not on baseball.

1093
01:22:21,316 --> 01:22:22,760
Over and out.
- Banned?

1094
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:26,555
Again, it's reviewable after one year.
Then Pete gets another shot.

1095
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:30,392
And the league can never say
you bet on baseball. Never.

1096
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:35,147
Pete, this has been
a complete public-relations nightmare.

1097
01:22:35,247 --> 01:22:38,484
You're not happy.
Believe me, Giamatti's not happy, either.

1098
01:22:38,584 --> 01:22:40,879
He wanted to make his case.

1099
01:22:40,919 --> 01:22:44,406
We've done everything.
Blocked 'em in court, subpoenaed them.

1100
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:49,181
Now this is their final offer.
We've run out of options.

1101
01:23:01,857 --> 01:23:06,486
The banishment for life
of Pete Rose from baseball...

1102
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:09,573
is the sad end of a sorry episode.

1103
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:14,728
One of the game's greatest players
has engaged in a variety of acts,

1104
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:16,980
which have stained the game,

1105
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:21,235
and he now must live
with the consequences of those acts.

1106
01:23:21,335 --> 01:23:23,862
He's gonna have to
face some consequences, too.

1107
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:26,465
No player or manager,

1108
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:31,261
no matter how exalted,
is above the game.

1109
01:23:31,345 --> 01:23:34,623
The integrity of baseball itself
is at stake.

1110
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:37,668
The matter of Mr. Rose is now closed.

1111
01:23:37,768 --> 01:23:39,378
Commissioner.

1112
01:23:39,478 --> 01:23:42,878
Did Pete Rose
bet on baseball?

1113
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:45,943
In my opinion - yes.

1114
01:23:46,944 --> 01:23:49,494
Pete Rose did bet on baseball.

1115
01:23:49,905 --> 01:23:51,990
What?
- That bastard.

1116
01:23:52,074 --> 01:23:54,143
He went against the agreement.

1117
01:23:54,243 --> 01:23:57,271
Theirs was no finding. No finding
as to whether he ever bet on baseball.

1118
01:23:57,371 --> 01:24:02,584
They screwed us.
- You know what, Rog? Screw 'em.

1119
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:05,941
I'll have the last word if it kills me.

1120
01:24:07,965 --> 01:24:10,467
I'll have the last word.

1121
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:33,849
Trust me on this.
I'll be out of baseball a very short time.

1122
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:35,949
Pete.
Over here.

1123
01:24:35,993 --> 01:24:39,396
Pete, were you surprised
by Commissioner Giamatti's statement?

1124
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:45,956
I was a little surprised by some of
those remarks. Some, I didn't understand.

1125
01:24:47,004 --> 01:24:49,573
What are you gonna do
with yourself, Pete?

1126
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:51,075
Nothing.

1127
01:24:51,175 --> 01:24:57,890
L'll have to do without baseball for
the first time since I was seven years old.

1128
01:24:58,056 --> 01:24:59,875
Pete.

1129
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:02,461
Hey, you know what they can't
take away from me?

1130
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:04,646
From the fans?

1131
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:09,468
The bits and pieces of myself
I left behind in all those ballparks...

1132
01:25:09,568 --> 01:25:13,071
for 27 years.
- Pete.

1133
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:17,810
They can't... They can't have that.
- Pete. Pete, over here.

1134
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:21,395
If the Commissioner... Pete?
- Pete. Pete.

1135
01:25:21,455 --> 01:25:23,107
Did you ever bet on baseball, Pete?

1136
01:25:23,207 --> 01:25:25,692
Well, regardless of what
the Commissioner said today,

1137
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:28,257
I never bet on baseball.
Um...

1138
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:39,956
That's all I can say.
- Pete.

1139
01:25:48,815 --> 01:25:51,135
Pete, hi.
- Just one more question.

1140
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:54,112
Over here.
Over here.

1141
01:25:58,617 --> 01:26:00,617
It's OK, Pete.

1142
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,205
There's a high drive, way back...

1143
01:27:21,283 --> 01:27:24,745
Pete Rose.
He's circling the bases.

1144
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,085
Holy cow.

1145
01:27:32,169 --> 01:27:35,005
What a thrill to watch him.

1146
01:27:35,088 --> 01:27:38,403
The crowd giving him
a standing ovation.

1147
01:28:06,411 --> 01:28:11,341
You have always denied,
publicly, that you bet on baseball.

1148
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:13,836
Did you bet on baseball?

1149
01:28:15,879 --> 01:28:19,633
Yes, I did. And that was my mistake.

1150
01:28:20,259 --> 01:28:23,136
Did you bet on your own team?

1151
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:25,220
Yes.
