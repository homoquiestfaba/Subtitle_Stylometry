1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,273
Folks said that he was a rounder,
a drunkard, a troubadour.

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,318
Some went so far as to claim
he was a murderer.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,790
To the boy,
he was nothing more than a ghost.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,996
Some unseen spectre
whose only proof of existence

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,992
was the damage he left in his wake.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,594
But the boy would not be able to deny
the phantom's existence

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,035
when it showed up in the flesh.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,873
After 40 years,
the old man was coming home.

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,963
BLOODWORTH

10
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,989
Wait's over, boy.

11
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,078
In order to... Manuscripts,
all submissions must be typed.

12
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,469
Brownie!

13
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,035
You better do something
about these dogs or I'm gonna...

14
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,751
Fleming!

15
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,749
Fleming Bloodworth.

16
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,753
You sure have grown
since I saw you last.

17
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,765
I was hoping
you'd come back to school this year.

18
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,789
Yeah, I was planning
on finishing up. I just got--

19
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,652
tied up in other things, you know?

20
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,872
Two months shy of graduation.

21
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,951
It's always a shame
when a young person quits.

22
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,120
So, what did you think
of that book I gave you?

23
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,395
It's a good one, I reckon.

24
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,072
I'll make sure to return it to you
if that's what worries you.

25
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,119
No, no, it was a gift.
There's some others you should read.

26
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,153
I think you'd enjoy.

27
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,433
Fleming, I'd like to help you.

28
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,396
I know something
about the situation you're in.

29
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,389
The what?

30
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,149
Your home life.

31
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,390
There ain't any goddamn thing wrong
with my home life.

32
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,911
When you get done
pushing around with that girl's toy,

33
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,671
put that on that engine.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,319
I've done took the tools back.

35
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,229
You know how he gets.

36
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,555
I don't give a shit how he gets.
You tell him we need 'em.

37
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,675
And he knows how I get.

38
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,113
I don't guess you've seen any
of your mama?

39
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,035
Nope.

40
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,037
-You got any clean shirts?
-There's that box under your bed.

41
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,113
We got any coffee?

42
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,869
Fleming?

43
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,354
Oh, Goddamnit!

44
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,435
Still batching, I see.

45
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,519
I wasn't expecting no company.

46
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,715
Come to see Boyd.

47
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,992
I had a sense you was around.

48
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,874
I've come about Pa.

49
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,034
-He's coming back here.
-What?

50
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,597
He's had a stroke of paralysis.
He ain't got nowhere else to go.

51
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,145
That must be a hell of a stroke
for him to come back here.

52
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,451
I was glad I read that letter
while Ma was asleep.

53
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,752
Brady, don't you think

54
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,580
that after 40 years
she might have noticed he's gone?

55
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,268
Says he's got to walk with a stick.

56
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,315
He thinks he's going to die
but he's not.

57
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,549
I read it out in the cards.

58
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,669
Jesus Christ!

59
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,228
The old man may die at some point,
but he ain't gonna die from the stroke.

60
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,554
You seem to like
the idea of him suffering, Brady.

61
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,996
You seem to be suffering
just a little bit yourself.

62
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,672
Bible says you reap what you sow.

63
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,079
The Bible also says

64
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,548
that fortune tellers and soothsayers
are an abomination before God.

65
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,471
But you probably just forgot that verse,
didn't you, Brady?

66
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,152
He sent me money to buy him a trailer.

67
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,159
Probably expected an open invitation

68
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,071
just to move right back in the house
with me and Mama.

69
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,434
If I remember right, Brady,

70
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,875
his name is still on the goddamn deed,
ain't it?

71
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,879
There's one more thing.

72
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,959
Warren called

73
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,429
about that boy's mama.

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,035
He called you?

75
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,715
You ain't got no phone.

76
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,155
-Said he seen her in Nashville.
-Bullshit!

77
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,875
She's never been to Nashville.

78
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,275
She wouldn't even know
how to find Warren's fucking place.

79
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,397
She didn't go to Warren's place.
He just spied her out on the sidewalk.

80
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,959
Just walking.

81
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,468
Oh, it was her all right.

82
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,754
Her and her new fella.

83
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,034
Could you get me another shot?

84
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,508
Hi.

85
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,433
-Are you Warren?
-Yes, I am.

86
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,112
Warren Bloodworth?

87
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,909
Have a seat.

88
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,679
Yes, sir.

89
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,036
-Would you like a drink?
-I think I will.

90
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,709
Warren, I'm Hazel and I'm a singer.

91
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,870
I wanna be a singer.

92
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,397
I am going to be a singer.
But I need a job

93
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,838
and I hear you could give me a job.

94
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,753
-I can give you a job.
-Oh, yeah? Let me see.

95
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,469
I'll take it.

96
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,796
-You're bad. Beg...
-Come on, just like that.

97
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,509
-Give me some of it. Oh, that's good.
-Do you like that? Do you like that?

98
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,397
Do you want more? Do you want...

99
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,871
Well, that is perfect.

100
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,153
-That pizza is so good.
-Yeah...

101
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,515
-Hey, Warren. It's Colt.
-Hey, hey.

102
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,511
Get your butt on down here.
This fella won't leave.

103
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,113
-What?
-Says he's your brother.

104
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,349
I'll just be a minute...

105
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,000
-You better get down here.
-Shit.

106
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,115
Hey?

107
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,835
Get out of here.

108
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,400
I have perfectly...

109
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,150
Hey! No, no, no.

110
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,955
I told him not to bother you,

111
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,635
but he's an asshole, so he bothered you.

112
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,958
Daddy's coming home.

113
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,591
I heard that.
I heard some other shit, too.

114
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,189
She ain't here.

115
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,993
You're saying my wife's not here?

116
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,149
I saw her walking.

117
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,114
She with a guy?

118
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,474
You know what it is? Twin, .50 calibre.

119
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,834
Right there, twin .50s.

120
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,634
My fort.

121
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,958
To defend myself
from your asshole bartender,

122
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,359
principally, that's why.

123
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,835
You got any place to stay?

124
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,276
Told asshole I'll just lay on over there
on that bandstand

125
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,759
and not to bother you.

126
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,638
Well, come on.

127
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,555
Hey.

128
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,832
-Come on.
-Fort.

129
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,399
Come on! Fort.

130
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,034
Sorry to hear about your dog.
I know how much you thought of Brownie.

131
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,871
I doubt that. They're just dogs to you.

132
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,876
When I seen
Brownie's guts twisted like that,

133
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,678
I felt something twist inside me.

134
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,948
Where's Boyd?

135
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,835
Figure him to be hungry, too,
what with all that rambling.

136
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,593
Brady told he was back.

137
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,636
-He's gone.
-What?

138
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,389
Again?

139
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,150
-Whereabouts this time?
-Nashville, I reckon.

140
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,032
Brady told about Warren calling.

141
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,471
Warren called? News to me.

142
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,638
You hear that? News to me.

143
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,710
I swear. The men in this family...

144
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,508
Harwood did it.

145
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,352
Reckon he thought
he's gonna teach me a lesson.

146
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,476
Well, we'll see about that.

147
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,269
Did you see him do it?

148
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,431
Don't need to see everything
to know it to be true.

149
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,556
You know what this is?

150
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,039
-A pill bottle?
-No, look closer.

151
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,749
Cigarette butt?

152
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,516
It's Harwood's cigarette butt.
It's got his essence on it.

153
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,879
And I am using this essence
to put a mighty hurt on Old Harwood.

154
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,637
His insides will petrify
and his stool will turn to concrete.

155
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,709
You watch.

156
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,274
Remind me never to leave anything
of mine lying around for you to find.

157
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,870
Look, I didn't come here
for no witchcraft lesson. I just...

158
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,518
I wanna know
if I could borrow them tools again.

159
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,196
I have told you,
if you don't get a new carburettor,

160
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,474
the motor won't even fire.

161
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,272
I got one. Daddy brought it in.

162
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,872
Bring them wrenches back
where you got them.

163
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,514
And don't get them rusted.

164
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,199
Hey. Hey, hey, Harwood! Harwood!
I need a stamp. Oversized.

165
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,315
In the glove box.

166
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,519
There must be something going around.

167
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,069
Yeah.

168
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,553
-Hey, that son of a bitch here?
-Dad ain't here.

169
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,309
Not your son of a bitch dad. My dad!

170
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,909
No.

171
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,634
Son of a bitch!
Drove all this way. Hazel!

172
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,754
Your daddy here? Boyd? Boyd here?

173
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,472
No. He's gone up to Nashville, I reckon.
Brady told about you calling about Mama.

174
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,629
You seen him?

175
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,153
No, I ain't.
Hey! You wanna go for a ride?

176
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,793
Come on. I got enough beer.

177
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,389
Who's that?

178
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,949
She's my accountant.

179
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,229
Your accountant?

180
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,957
Yeah, on the account that
she can suck a...through a...

181
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,756
She knocked out or passed out?

182
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,509
A little of both.

183
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,994
No, I don't got a driver's licence.

184
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,230
That's all right. I'll pay
for your fine, if you get caught.

185
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,355
You're not drunk, are you?

186
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,079
-No.
-All right. Good.

187
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,118
You provide the sobriety
and I'll provide the cash and the car.

188
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,273
Hold on to that. Put it in your pocket.

189
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,119
The last four days,
I've bought and paid for enough friends

190
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,872
to hold a Baptist foot washing.

191
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,354
Who the fuck are you?

192
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,952
-Thief! Get out!
-Hey!

193
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,599
-Whoa! Whoa...
-Get out...

194
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,672
-Hazel!
-But he's trying to steal your car.

195
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,034
No. No. Hazel.

196
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,190
That's my young nephew, Fleming.

197
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,633
Hazel, Fleming. Fleming, Hazel.

198
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,892
There you go. Here, have one of those.

199
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,153
I don't have anything
to wash it down with.

200
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,218
There you go.

201
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,909
Good.

202
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,875
She always like that?

203
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,309
No, just when she's awake.

204
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,156
Don't worry about Boyd.
He'll turn up one day,

205
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,754
when he's old, and broke
and ready to die. I'd piss on him.

206
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,472
Take my advice. Move on, like I did.

207
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,194
Where we at?

208
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,078
Piece of heaven, son.
Little piece of heaven.

209
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,239
-What about her?
-She'll be fine.

210
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,149
Hey!

211
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,313
Warren Bloodworth!

212
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,677
Oh, my God! This night's
just gotten a whole lot better.

213
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,638
Wow! You could have called.
Who's this fine looking young thing?

214
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,352
This here is my nephew Fleming.

215
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,549
Hi.

216
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,517
Hey, is your daughter around?

217
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,452
Yeah. She's floating
around here somewhere.

218
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,793
I'm gonna get you some wine.

219
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,079
Glasses are over here.

220
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,469
Let's see a hundred.

221
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,794
A hundred. Give me a hundred.

222
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,075
This is good wine.

223
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,631
I just love a man
who knows what he wants.

224
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,513
Lord, have mercy on our souls!

225
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,235
You sort of favour Warren.

226
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,795
Are you all kin?

227
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,679
He's my daddy's brother.

228
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,475
Why aren't you drunk?

229
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,834
I can't imagine Warren Bloodworth
with a sober relative.

230
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,872
I don't really drink that much.
I don't care for that feeling, you know.

231
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,829
It makes you

232
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,549
miss things.

233
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,953
You mean it dulls your senses?

234
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,240
Yeah. It dulls your senses.
Drinking does.

235
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,793
Why didn't you just say that then?

236
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,909
I don't know.

237
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,598
I think you've addled me, sort of.

238
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,149
You mean I've vamped you.

239
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,431
Like one of them old silent movie stars
with those long black eyelashes?

240
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,712
What do you think I am?
One of them high priced call girls?

241
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,675
No! Lord, no.

242
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,954
You think I'm a cheap call girl?

243
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,952
No, I don't think anything at all.
I was just... I was...

244
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,755
Warren! Warren! Warren!

245
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,233
Let's go for a walk. Come on.

246
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,239
-What's your name?
-Fleming Bloodworth.

247
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,931
-Yours?
-Raven.

248
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,153
Raven Lee Halfacre.

249
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,970
You know,

250
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,758
I said that you favoured Warren,
but now I ain't so sure.

251
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,873
You know how he's got
that smart ass look about him.

252
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,199
Yes, I do.

253
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,952
You don't really have that.

254
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,815
You look nice. Sweet.

255
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,917
You ain't the talker he is either.

256
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,959
He'd have a girl's blouse
talked off by now.

257
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,549
Thanks.

258
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,319
I don't mind buying it for you,
but why do you read stuff like that?

259
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,359
-You don't like to read?
-No, I read, just not stuff like that.

260
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,478
You don't like pretty girls
wearing pretty things?

261
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,359
I like pretty girls.

262
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,069
I just don't wanna waste
my reading time on them.

263
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,151
Not that I'm wasting my time with you.

264
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,552
-I mean...
-I think I know what you mean.

265
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,032
What's this magazine going to cost me?

266
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,470
Boys are always
expecting something in return.

267
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,315
What do you expect?

268
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,274
Nothing.
I don't expect nothing from you.

269
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,997
Just as long as you understand

270
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,390
that I ain't some watered down version
of my mama.

271
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,469
I ain't nothing like her.

272
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,157
I had to change my name from Evelyn.

273
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,312
I suspect before long
I'll be changing Halfacre, too.

274
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,992
Shit, you're planning
on getting married?

275
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,238
You don't have to get married
to change your name.

276
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,319
Anybody can.

277
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,796
Mama thinks that I'm pretty enough
to get into some kind of show business.

278
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,512
I think she sees me
as her best shot out of Tennessee.

279
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,639
She hates Tennessee.
Says it's full of hillbillies.

280
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,109
-Where's she from?
-Tennessee.

281
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,079
-Where are you from?
-Tennessee.

282
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,029
You don't really sound like it.

283
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,789
Really?

284
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,075
You don't either, much.

285
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,116
Well, I watch the television
and I practise.

286
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,872
Hollywood don't want no hillbillies.

287
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,911
So you can't sound like that.

288
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,109
How about you?

289
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,959
You practise on TV?

290
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,110
No. I don't really watch TV, much.

291
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,872
I just read.

292
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,669
But how in the world is reading
gonna make you sound smart?

293
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,079
I don't know.

294
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,629
Hey.

295
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,354
-Oh, no.
-What?

296
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,993
Move the fuck out of my house
when I tell you

297
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,115
to get the fuck out of my house!

298
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,033
You do not tell me what to do,
you goddamn whore!

299
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,792
-And you cheating bastard!
-Hey! Hey, hey!

300
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,638
What are you... Don't touch me!

301
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,119
-You bitch...
-Mama!

302
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,478
-Okay. You want...
-Fine.

303
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,676
You fucking bitch,
you fucking deserve that.

304
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,229
Where have you been?

305
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,395
-We just walked to town.
-What's on your face? Did he hit you?

306
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,469
-No.
-No! No!

307
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,754
-Mrs. Halfacre.
-No, Mama. You're seeing things.

308
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,235
Don't you talk to me, you little shit,
you little Bloodworth bastard!

309
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,675
I'm gonna walk out
of this room right now.

310
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,988
When I get back here,

311
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,072
I want that two-timing
motherfucker bastard

312
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,516
and his fucking girlfriend, cunt,
bitch out of my house

313
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,749
and I mean it!

314
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,389
I mean it.

315
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,355
Get him up. Hey.

316
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,634
Come on, we gotta go.

317
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,759
-Hey.
-Come on, Warren. Let's go, let's go.

318
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,439
I'm sorry you had to see that.

319
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,951
I can't imagine
what you think about me right now.

320
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,997
Well, why is that?
It's not you, it's her.

321
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,960
So you just don't need
to be apologising.

322
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,953
Thanks for the magazine.
You ever gonna make this way again?

323
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,032
I actually,
I don't really know where we are.

324
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,759
You're in Fulton. It's far away I guess.

325
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,269
Hey!

326
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,356
Well, do you want to
go out with me next weekend?

327
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,237
I'd love to. Yeah.

328
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,872
I'd like that.

329
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,794
-Well, what is there to do around here?
-We'll find something to do.

330
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,120
Hey, Warren! What? Give me those keys!

331
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,670
Mighty early for a young fella
like yourself to be drinking.

332
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,432
This hour is reserved for professionals.

333
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,598
You know anyone looking to hire?

334
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,478
Not rightly, but you might look on the
board over there, might be something.

335
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,257
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

336
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,176
I'd expect old Trigger Lipscomb
to walk in here

337
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,029
rather than you darkening my door.

338
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,258
Itchy, can you give me a ride up
to home?

339
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,469
I'll pay ya.

340
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,065
Fleming might be able to.
He's looking for work.

341
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,579
Boy, are you looking
to make some money?

342
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,642
Yes, sir. That I am.

343
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,757
Can you give me a ride?
I'll pay you 20 bucks.

344
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,875
Where to?

345
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,949
Grinders Creek.

346
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,519
Grinders Creek, for 20 bucks? Sure.

347
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,592
Just pull it around the back,
pick me up. Be quiet about it.

348
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,719
For 20 bucks, I can be real quiet.

349
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,433
I thought you were dead when they
delivered that old Gibson here.

350
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,351
I was dreading
putting on a suit for your funeral.

351
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,670
Itchy, I ain't got time
to explain everything now.

352
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,196
I gotcha. Your guitar's in the back.
Let's go get it.

353
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,029
Where's your toilets?

354
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,999
Hey, in there!

355
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,708
I say, hey in there.

356
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,718
Say, good buddy,
where's that old man at?

357
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,318
Ain't nobody in here but me.

358
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,956
That's, except you.
What old man are you talking about?

359
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,716
-Rutgers.
-I don't know nobody by that name.

360
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,230
He was wearing a grey fedora. He had
a walking stick carved like a snake.

361
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,153
He's an old man. He just...

362
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,790
He just walked through that door
a few minutes ago.

363
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,913
I never seen him.

364
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,797
He's got a son that's a retard.
Got kicked in the head by a mule?

365
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,478
Preaches to chickens.

366
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,391
Can't be too many people
that meets that description.

367
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,439
I don't know nobody like that.

368
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,840
Now, look, me and that old man, we...

369
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,511
We done some business
on the way down here.

370
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,909
I'm gonna buy
a herd of Black Angus from him.

371
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,399
I don't know what you're talking about.

372
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,031
I just watched him walk
through that door right there.

373
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,951
You were sitting in here
on this side of that door.

374
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,112
And now you're telling me
you never saw him.

375
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,636
Mister, I ain't got time to argue
with you. I got a business to run.

376
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,075
Yeah, well, how about I haul your ass
over that counter

377
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,559
and I just mop up the floor with it?

378
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,076
I'll give you two reasons why not.
One, two.

379
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,269
Now then,

380
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,355
you're in my place of business

381
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,398
and the law's gonna believe
that you came in here to rob me

382
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,833
and I didn't care to be robbed!

383
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,918
You people done fucked
with the wrong man.

384
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,189
I did not drive 400 miles out of my way

385
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,390
to deliver some old cripple
to some beer joint.

386
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,472
That son of a bitch owes me some cattle!

387
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,792
That might be true,
but I'm sick of listening to it.

388
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,117
You tell Rutgers

389
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,193
he's gonna regret this
for the rest of his days.

390
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,156
I will if I ever meet the man.
Now, you get the hell out of here.

391
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,029
Whereabouts?

392
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,115
Hell, anywhere along here will do.

393
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,829
Where are you headed?

394
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,069
My uncle's place.
I just got to drop off some wrenches.

395
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,954
Fleming, honey,
you want me to fix you some food?

396
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,519
No, thanks, I'm fine.

397
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,552
-Who you got in the car with you?
-Some old fellow needed a ride.

398
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,437
He's paying me,
though, so I better get on.

399
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,155
I was told Boyd had him a son.

400
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,829
You'd be him.

401
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,509
How'd you know that?

402
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,829
The name's Bloodworth.

403
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,989
E. F. Bloodworth.

404
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,597
You favour me somewhat,

405
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,237
at least back when I was a young man.

406
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,757
Well, hell, I know where you're going.

407
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,795
This water ain't fit for drinking.

408
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,838
She runs deep, but it ain't spring fed
or nothing like that.

409
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,345
Thought about digging you a well,

410
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,728
but that's a lot of digging to do
by yourself.

411
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,237
I ain't put off by hardship.
Live in a brush arbor if I have to.

412
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,630
Four thousand
sure don't buy what it used to.

413
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,032
Yeah, that's Brady's doing.

414
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,953
I told him it was crooked.

415
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,549
I put this up for shade though, and I
put you some privacy for your privy.

416
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,278
Brady just left a hole.

417
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,313
I didn't know how to level out your
house, though, especially with no help.

418
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,199
It's sturdy with this though.

419
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,549
I'm obliged.

420
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,234
I would have brought you some food
if I'd known you were coming.

421
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,596
If you get too hungry, just do like
I do and go back up and see Granny.

422
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,558
She'll fix you something.
She likes to feed people, so...

423
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,591
I expect I'd better be settled in here
before I go see your granny.

424
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,799
Warren and Boyd, they about?

425
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,156
No. Daddy's up at Nashville
looking for my mama.

426
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,390
Looking for your mama?
What, did he lose her?

427
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,354
Yeah, sort of.

428
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,510
Oh, no. No, no, no.
No, I don't need a hog. I need money.

429
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,398
Look, your ad didn't say anything
about any hog.

430
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,829
But I ain't got no money.

431
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,640
Hog, come on. Let's go. Come on.

432
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,313
Come on. Come on.

433
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,712
We're gonna make it. Just go on in.

434
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,875
You comfortable back there?

435
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,794
What the... Fuck me!

436
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,033
Anybody wanna buy a hog?

437
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,149
I almost gave up on you.

438
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,595
I was working. Making a living.

439
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,873
I brought these.

440
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,914
They're all on that reading list.

441
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,595
Did you get a chance to look over that
literature concerning the GED?

442
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,189
Some.

443
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,191
Well, they're going to be giving
that test at MTSU

444
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,753
coming up at the end of the semester.

445
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,233
That study guide is very helpful.

446
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,589
All right.

447
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,875
You can just leave them books
on the steps there.

448
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,389
Okay.

449
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,195
Much obliged.

450
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,989
-Where are you going, son?
-There's a coyote, Mama.

451
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,951
I just need to run it off
before it hurts something.

452
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,680
Are you crazy?
Don't you know enough to stay put?

453
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,713
I'm accustomed to putting myself
wherever I want to be.

454
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,553
I don't want you around Ma.

455
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,949
So you just head right back through
the woods, where you came from.

456
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,354
I ain't hurting nobody.

457
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,469
You think I aim to hurt her?

458
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,030
You did that a long time ago and
I ain't about to let you do it again.

459
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,799
She's old. Mind's getting feeble.

460
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,952
As far as I know, you've been forgot
and I aim to see that it stays that way.

461
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,793
Boy, you got me all wrong.
I don't wanna hurt nobody any more.

462
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,678
You get your sorry ass
back to that swamp where you belong.

463
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,352
I think you like the idea of me
cramped in that piece of tin.

464
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,036
Piece of tin I paid you $4,000 for,
mind you.

465
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,239
No lights, no water.

466
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,117
You wanted to make it hard on me.
Well, I got news for you.

467
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,998
Hard is what I'm used to.

468
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,756
When you let out of here 40 years ago,
you never looked back

469
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,239
because you didn't care.

470
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,117
You left us standing right there
on that porch

471
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,231
and you took your guitar with you.

472
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,198
Your new fancy guitar
that you had your name painted on.

473
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,793
Well, I had your name first!

474
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,995
I didn't take off.

475
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,550
I didn't pull a Boyd or a Warren.
I stayed where I belonged.

476
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,431
And I have had to sit here
and watch her wither away

477
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,953
all these years out of sorrow.

478
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,434
But you didn't see it.

479
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,593
No, you was off in Arkansas
or someplace plucking on your guitar.

480
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,748
I never felt I had to explain my actions
to any man.

481
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,789
But I'll tell you this,
you don't know the whole story,

482
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,995
not even half of it.

483
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,474
You stay away from here.

484
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,949
Because if you don't,
I will make it hard on you, old man.

485
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,355
Who's there?

486
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,795
Whisky wasn't my undoing.

487
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,872
It was music.

488
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,592
My bane and my salvation.

489
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,755
That's what Brady says. Warren, too.

490
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,517
Maybe them boys know me better
than I thought.

491
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,189
I used to be pretty good at this.

492
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,430
If I had a player,
I could show you how good I was.

493
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,632
Did you get a good piece off
of that hog?

494
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,679
Pretty good.

495
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,115
What put you in the working mood
all of a sudden?

496
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,077
I don't know, just trying
to pay my way is all, I guess.

497
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,996
I bet she's a pretty thing, ain't she?

498
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,190
I could tell you'd been love struck

499
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,273
the minute I laid eyes on you.

500
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,914
Yeah, well, I don't know
how love struck she still is.

501
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,235
I was supposed to take her out
last weekend and I didn't show up.

502
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,320
Had to finish painting
that goddamn house.

503
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,234
I'm taking her out this weekend.
Dinner, movie, whatever she wants.

504
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,471
And I don't care
what her mama has to say about me.

505
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,278
I felt that way about your granny, too.

506
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,035
Her daddy thought low of me.

507
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,319
Said I was a drunkard, a layabout,
patron of whores.

508
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,838
Of course, I was all those things,
but I didn't like him saying it.

509
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,154
Yeah.

510
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,354
Granny doesn't really talk
about you too much,

511
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,589
at least not to me.

512
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,869
I can't say I blame her.

513
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,791
Her daddy swore I was bad for her
and I did my best to prove he was wrong.

514
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,032
But I wasn't too successful at it.

515
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,235
Well, actually I do remember her saying
one thing about you which is,

516
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,233
you used to make your own whisky.

517
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,876
That's what they sent me to the pen for.

518
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,199
Well, she left that part out.

519
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,476
I only served a year or so.

520
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,869
Long enough for them to keep
a close eye on me after I got out.

521
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,191
Made it a little harder
for me to re-fire my still.

522
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,676
But you started up again
after you got out of the pen?

523
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,676
I always started up again.
I got shot at more than I was hit.

524
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,555
I guess that made me think
I was ahead of the game.

525
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,236
I could never quit while I was ahead.

526
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,713
What's her name?

527
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,395
Raven.

528
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,273
That's a good name.

529
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,478
I got a gal
Sweet as she can be

530
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,632
I got a gal
Sweet as she can be

531
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,112
Raven is her name

532
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,399
And she thinks the world of me

533
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,996
Sweet as she can be

534
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,715
I got a gal
Sweet as she can be

535
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,432
Raven is her name

536
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,233
And she thinks the world of me

537
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,672
You gotta start singing that song.

538
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,233
So, is it true you played
at the Grand Ole Opry?

539
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,313
Well, I played the Ryman once
back when the Opry was still there.

540
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,514
Just one show, opening for some boys
that had a song on the radio.

541
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,910
-Hell, you made records.
-One. I cut one.

542
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,799
They didn't play it much.

543
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,795
So I run up against this radio feller
once at one of my shows.

544
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,676
I found him insulting
and pulled a knife on him.

545
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,874
That kind of put the kibosh
on my radio play.

546
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,794
You going to a wedding or a funeral?

547
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,995
You cash a cheque?

548
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,718
Well, I think I can handle that.

549
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,792
-There you go.
-No, I don't take no handouts.

550
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,717
I don't recall ever paying you
for that taxi ride I bought from you.

551
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,399
You treat that little girl right.

552
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,595
Lord God.

553
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,032
Are you talking about me or the car?

554
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,509
If you're talking about the car,
don't worry about it.

555
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,158
I thought you forgot all about me.

556
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,518
-I can't go anywhere. Mama...
-Who's out there?

557
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,959
It's a salesman!

558
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,473
I didn't come all this way
just to get stood up.

559
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,198
Get your ass in here right now!

560
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,391
Go wait down the road a piece. Okay?

561
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,155
Mama!

562
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,829
Nice car.

563
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,834
What about your mama?

564
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,721
She got her prescription
filled this morning. 

565
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,509
She's out. Will be for a long time.

566
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,039
You smell nice.

567
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,797
Good enough to eat.

568
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,749
Hey!

569
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,355
What's gotten into you?

570
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,873
We're sitting right here
in the middle of the road.

571
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,190
What's gotten into you?
You're the one who started it all.

572
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,033
You're right. I'm sorry.

573
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,155
Sorry.

574
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,350
So, this is, a date sort of?

575
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,992
What do we do now?

576
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,269
-Have you done this before?
-No.

577
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,115
Here you go, Evelyn.

578
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,356
You know what they say
about a man with big feet?

579
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,429
What?

580
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,791
It's just a joke.

581
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,952
You know, I think I may have to
rethink my whole philosophy on life

582
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,109
after going out with you.

583
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,029
How do you mean?

584
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,638
Well, for one thing
you do what you say you're gonna do.

585
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,271
You said you was going to take me out
and you did.

586
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,032
I just about decided that men were
the worst kind of trash on the planet.

587
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,193
They use you and drop you
and slap you around.

588
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,909
Take your Uncle Warren.

589
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,309
You can take that type if you want.
That ain't my style.

590
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,798
If a guy like Warren were
to take me out,

591
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,974
which he wouldn't, he wouldn't
take a girl anywhere except to bed.

592
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,397
But if he drove a car
that smelled like yours

593
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,391
or run like that, which he wouldn't,

594
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,248
because a guy like that always has
to drive something new and fancy.

595
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,839
It wouldn't have bothered him
one bit, though.

596
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,673
A guy like that would be
just like "Tough shit".

597
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,199
Now I could tell that it bothered you.

598
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,792
I noticed.
You were embarrassed about it.

599
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,989
You're thoughtful.

600
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,749
Come on.

601
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,999
I ain't putting that back on.

602
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,832
It's my phone number in lipstick.

603
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,555
Hey. You want one of Mama's oxys?

604
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,757
If we just take half, it'll kind
of knock the edge off, you know?

605
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,710
No, thanks.
I'm pretty addled around you as it is.

606
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,876
Earlier tonight you said that

607
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,472
you weren't like the rest
of your family.

608
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,038
They can't be much worse than my mama.

609
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,246
In different ways they can.

610
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,709
What's your father like?

611
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,193
Damned if I know.
I don't think Mama did either.

612
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,315
Probably why she run off.

613
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,679
She must have been like my mama.

614
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,591
No, no, no, she wasn't like that at all.
She was, she was real quiet.

615
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,595
She always seemed kind of sad
like she wanted Daddy

616
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,750
or somebody to pull her out of it.

617
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,588
When I was a little girl,

618
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,389
I used to ask men around town
if they knew my daddy.

619
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,674
Most of what I heard wasn't good.

620
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,558
I guess he took a bunch of folks
for their money.

621
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,821
And he was just gone.

622
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,630
I wish I'd kept my mouth shut
and not asked.

623
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,567
I probably shouldn't even be
telling you this.

624
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,280
I should've just told you
he was a Baptist preacher

625
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,954
who got killed
on a mission or something.

626
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,076
I'm never much on preachers anyhow.

627
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,913
You've never done this before, have you?

628
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,548
No. No, I haven't.

629
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,870
It's okay. I'll show you.

630
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,593
Get the fuck out of my house!

631
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,831
-Mama!
-Hey! You sit your ass right back down!

632
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,955
-Don't! Mama!
-Sit down.

633
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,399
-Mrs. Halfacre, I'm sorry.
-Don't you "Mrs" me.

634
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,755
-Mama, stop it!
-You shut up!

635
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,029
You fucker,
you stay the fuck out of my house!

636
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,556
What is wrong with you?

637
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,834
I can't trust you.

638
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,952
Mama, he's not like all the other men.

639
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,156
What, like most men?
He's not like most men?

640
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,229
You don't even know him!

641
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,629
There ain't but one thing
that any of them wants

642
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,110
and once they get it,
they got no use for you, baby.

643
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,359
No, no, no.

644
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,510
-You know the rules.
-Those are your rules.

645
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,794
They're our rules.

646
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,677
You wear a condom,

647
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,478
you don't give any heart,

648
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,073
and no sleepovers.

649
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,598
-You don't even know him.
-Oh, baby.

650
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,876
-You a Bloodworth?
-Who's asking?

651
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,158
The name's Coble.
I'm looking for an E. F. Bloodworth.

652
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,308
Evening, Mr. Rutgers.

653
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,345
I take it you've been talking
to the big cattle man.

654
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,594
Mr. Coble was in my office ranting

655
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,852
and raving about you
owing him a herd of cattle.

656
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,476
I just wrote him off as a near lunatic.

657
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,033
The next thing I know

658
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:26,238
the county attorney
started asking questions about you.

659
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:29,457
Figured it was Coble who
got him stirred up.

660
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,529
I'm much obliged to you for telling me.

661
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,306
I don't suppose you
have any recollection

662
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:39,837
about Harold Lipscomb, do you?

663
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,829
Trigger Lipscomb?

664
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,159
Of course I remember him.
He put me in the pen.

665
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,591
You never saw him again
when you got out?

666
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,588
Not that I recall. Why?

667
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,351
Just wondering. County attorney.

668
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,149
It seemed Lipscomb just up
and disappeared all those years ago,

669
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,193
about the same time you did.

670
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,079
The report says that...

671
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,628
Well, you hear all kind
of rumours and stuff.

672
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,830
If you're gonna be chasing down everyone
who ever wanted Trigger Lipscomb dead,

673
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,353
you got a long road ahead of you.

674
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,718
Have a good day, Mr. Rutgers.

675
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,113
Brady thinks I'm crazy.

676
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,389
-Do you?
-No.

677
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,878
I'm hearing music, guitar.

678
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,555
Brady says it's all in my head.
What do you think?

679
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:57,156
I think if you
thought you heard guitar music,

680
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,959
then you heard guitar music.

681
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,113
It's E.F. I'm hearing.

682
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,872
I know those songs.
Ain't no mistaking it.

683
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,717
Do you know how it is I'm hearing E.F.?

684
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,718
Granddaddy bought a trailer

685
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,439
or at least he sent money
so that Brady could buy him one.

686
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,433
He had a stroke over in Carolina,
but he's okay now.

687
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,594
Where is his trailer?

688
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,638
Across that field over yonder?

689
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,653
That's where the music's coming from.

690
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,432
It's by that old pond.

691
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,127
At the dump?

692
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:38,589
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.

693
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,955
If he had a trailer, why wasn't it set
up here where there's power and water?

694
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,155
Brady.

695
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,680
If sense was gunpowder,
every one of you men together

696
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,558
wouldn't have enough to load
a round of birdshot.

697
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,793
Folks say I'm losing my mind.

698
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,110
Hey... Don't tell Brady that I told.

699
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,375
He'll try and put some sort
of curse on me.

700
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,519
You know about Harwood?

701
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,556
Harwood had stomach cancer.

702
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,835
Had it a year or so and never knew it.

703
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,592
Yeah, well, Brady put a curse on him.

704
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,852
Brady and his curses. I'll put a curse
on him if he ain't careful.

705
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,113
What's E.F. like these days?

706
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,279
He's pretty easy going.

707
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,599
Age must have slowed him down.

708
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,830
Easy going ain't how people seen him
when I known him.

709
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,151
You're here for the GED?

710
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,276
The name's Elbert Fleming Bloodworth II.

711
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,709
Can I help you?

712
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,309
I'm Warren.

713
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,669
Your son.

714
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,116
When I was a boy,
you said you'd take me fishing.

715
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,189
You never did.

716
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,189
Come on.

717
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,191
How you making it, Pa?

718
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,034
I'm making it, I reckon.

719
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,438
I better pass.

720
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,798
Been feeling kind of poorly
the last couple of days.

721
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,831
Well, I hope you don't mind
if I have a snort.

722
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,634
You're past the age
where what I think matters.

723
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,357
Itchy says

724
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,950
Boyd's boy Fleming
comes by and you visit with him.

725
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,389
Fleming's a good boy.

726
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,671
You got that right.

727
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,430
Yeah, most boys his age would be
out drinking beer and chasing tail.

728
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,158
Not him, though.

729
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:41,028
I doubt that boy could touch a titty
without falling in love.

730
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,555
He's got a good heart.

731
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,432
Yeah, odd though, isn't it?

732
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,556
It just don't fit in our fam-damn-ily.

733
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,508
Black sheep.

734
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,029
You ever see Brady?

735
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,549
No.

736
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,399
Look, he's just getting weirder.

737
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,711
He was odd turned
by the time he was a baby.

738
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,189
If you wanted to see him odd turned,

739
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,077
you should have stuck around
and seen him in high school.

740
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,791
Warren! This is not Miami!

741
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,388
Well, I guess I'm gonna go
where the palm trees grow.

742
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,833
We'll catch a fish when I get back.

743
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,392
-I don't want your money.
-I don't want it either.

744
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,636
-You be careful.
-Too late for that.

745
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,234
You and Warren
enjoy your little fishing excursion?

746
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,200
-How'd you know we were fishing?
-I know lots of things.

747
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,191
What I wanna know is why
you told all them lies on me.

748
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,553
I don't remember saying anything
about you, truth or lies.

749
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,834
That cattleman Coble,
he seems to remember word for word

750
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,480
about how crazy I am, retarded.

751
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,794
How I go about preaching to stumps,

752
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,836
baptising chickens, marrying cows.

753
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,434
-That.
-Yeah, that.

754
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,473
I always knew that
you was evil and worthless.

755
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,879
I should have counted on being betrayed.

756
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,359
It had nothing to do with you.

757
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,199
Needed a ride to Tennessee.

758
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,715
Coble don't find the humour in it.
Says you made him look like a fool.

759
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,438
Hell, I'll just pay his ride bill
and be done with it.

760
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,719
He's hired a lawyer,
gonna have you declared incompetent.

761
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,439
The court's gonna appoint somebody
to look after your business.

762
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,752
Well, you'd be a fine candidate
for that.

763
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,196
You couldn't look after the business
a sitting hen could accumulate.

764
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,276
Well, it don't matter.

765
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,069
It don't matter
because you are fixing to die.

766
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,790
And worse yet,
you are going straight to hell.

767
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,072
I guess God told you that, didn't he?

768
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,475
Yes, he did.

769
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,312
-You talk to God a lot?
-Yes, I do.

770
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,951
Well, then I guess he told you

771
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,735
if you don't get your ass
on down the road,

772
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,026
I'm gonna beat
the hell out of both of you.

773
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,633
Well, I don't care if she is at home.
I can't wait any longer.

774
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,397
I just... I can't see you right now.

775
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,516
You've made every excuse
for the past two months.

776
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,714
Raven...

777
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,999
I thought... I thought you cared for me.

778
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,919
I do, Fleming.

779
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,479
I just need time to think, okay?

780
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,312
Well, you better get your thinking done
with because I'm coming over.

781
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,914
Mama or no Mama.

782
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,863
Look, Mrs. Halfacre, I know you don't
care much about my family

783
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:49,992
and I understand that.

784
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,479
I understand that. I do but...

785
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,114
She ain't here.

786
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,239
Could you...

787
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,473
Could you go find her
and bring her home, please?

788
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,792
Storm's coming in.

789
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,596
-Bad one.
-Yeah?

790
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,351
You drive all this way
to give me a weather report?

791
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,319
Your mama told me to come get you.

792
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,432
What's the matter with her?
She's treating me like I'm human.

793
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,710
Desperately searching for a bridegroom.

794
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,875
What is she looking at?

795
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,149
She's just wondering.

796
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,348
Wondering what?

797
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,873
If you're the father.

798
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,518
So, what are you gonna do?

799
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:29,434
Mama had me when she was 17.
She made it. I will, too.

800
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,395
Whose is it?

801
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,798
It's not yours,
if that's what's bothering you.

802
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,709
It is a Bloodworth, though.

803
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,715
Warren.

804
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,109
Warren, you sick son of a bitch.

805
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,229
I'm gonna kill him.

806
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,635
He didn't force me...

807
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,914
I'm gonna... I'll fucking kill him.

808
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,269
I was willing.

809
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,551
It happened before I met you.

810
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,553
I was pregnant. I just didn't know it.

811
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,198
I gotta go.

812
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,113
It's about to be awful outside.

813
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,677
I bet Mama would let you stay
on the couch this time.

814
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,909
I can't.

815
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,838
I gotta get back.

816
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,756
The old man's
been feeling badly of late.

817
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,872
Will you call me when you get home?

818
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,555
Why?

819
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,110
Because I'm afraid
I may never see you again.

820
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,756
I don't... I don't have a phone.

821
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,913
You should get inside.

822
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,468
I don't suppose you
have any recollection

823
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,652
about Harold Lipscomb, do you?

824
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,715
It seemed Lipscomb just up and
disappeared about the same time you did.

825
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,480
You left us standing right there
on that porch.

826
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,196
You are going straight to hell.

827
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,475
I guess God told you that, didn't he?

828
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,597
Are you crazy?
Don't you know enough to stay put?

829
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,997
You get your sorry ass
back to that swamp where you belong.

830
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,959
Hey. Hey, come on.

831
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,076
Hey. You should come inside.

832
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,713
She's dead.

833
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,959
The accountant's fucking dead.

834
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,359
Oh, Lord.

835
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,509
It's an accident. It's an accident...

836
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,959
We got a problem.
Come on, we gotta get her out of here.

837
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,992
-There is no "We".
-We gotta get her out of here.

838
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,798
-There is no "We". There's only you.
-We gotta get her...

839
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,599
No, no, no. Keep your hands off me.
Get off me, you!

840
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:24,908
Get up!

841
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,912
Get the fuck out of my fucking life!

842
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,157
Get in that fucking car!
Get up! Get the fuck out of here!

843
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,232
And you stay away from Raven!

844
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,353
Sorry son of a bitch!
Get the fuck up! Go!

845
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,553
Go! Go!

846
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,113
Get the fuck out of here!

847
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,753
Hey, man.

848
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,318
Baby?

849
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,870
Did you forget your keys again
or did you just miss me?

850
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,079
Boyd.

851
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,434
Hey, Patricia.

852
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,476
Boyd, what have you done?

853
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,199
Oh, my God.

854
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:47,754
What have you done?
What have you done? What have you done?

855
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,637
Sorry, I'm bothering you.

856
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,949
I'm supposed to tell you that
your daddy... Your daddy's got cancer.

857
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,553
Oh, Boyd.

858
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,552
-Come here.
-Boyd.

859
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,555
No. Oh, my God.

860
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,999
No!

861
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,157
Granddaddy?

862
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,313
No, no.

863
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,430
-I'm gonna go get a doctor.
-No.

864
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,109
Help me.

865
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,069
Help me.

866
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,909
Please.

867
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,473
-No.
-Please. For me.

868
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,799
I can't...

869
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,509
Please.

870
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,109
For me.

871
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,194
Hey, buddy. Everything all right?

872
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,908
Oh, my God!

873
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,436
Beware of false prophets which
come to you in sheep's clothing,

874
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,829
but inwardly are ravening wolves.

875
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,598
Ye shall know them by their fruits.

876
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:57,593
Do men gather grapes of thorns
or figs of thistles?

877
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,194
Even so every good tree
bringeth forth good fruit.

878
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:03,113
But a corrupt tree bringeth
forth evil fruit.

879
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,477
A good tree cannot bring
forth evil fruit

880
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,835
neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit.

881
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,856
Every tree that bringeth
not forth good fruit

882
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,913
is hewn down and cast into the fire.

883
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,114
Back home.

884
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,672
Finally back home.

885
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,190
Our secrets are buried with us, E.F.

886
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,030
Our secrets are buried with us.

887
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:04,110
Fleming Bloodworth,
you've disgraced your whole family.

888
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,598
Not showing up
at your own granddaddy's funeral.

889
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,470
What's the matter with you?
You're sick or something?

890
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,075
What is...

891
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,029
This you?

892
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,517
Somebody's certainly
getting above their raising.

893
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,479
How's it feel to be a tool?

894
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,393
Tool to do my bidding.
How does that feel?

895
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,715
What?

896
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,321
There's more holes left
in that old bastard

897
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:10,096
than one metal pole was capable
of leaving.

898
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,374
I know the truth.

899
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,229
I did it.

900
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:23,271
And I did it using you as my tool.
You did my bidding.

901
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,671
-You're crazy.
-I divined it!

902
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,748
You can't be crazy and divine something.

903
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:37,597
I used your assets and I turned it
on you and used you as my tool...

904
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:42,111
Give me my book back!
Get the hell out of here!

905
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,192
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing that I told Warren.

906
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,510
It's that
I don't ever wanna see you again.

907
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,192
I'm done.

908
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,793
I don't wanna be
a member of this family no longer.

909
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,759
You don't wanna be a part
of this family?

910
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,870
There's something I can do about that.
I can help you.

911
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,502
I'll burn this whole mess down
with you in it.

912
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,179
And then we'll dig another hole
and stick you

913
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:06,839
in the ground next to that old bastard,

914
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:09,746
then you won't be a part of this family.

915
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,518
And that is what blood is worth!

916
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,650
You be sure
and have a good night's sleep.

917
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:47,869
Hey.

918
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,799
E.F.?

919
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,319
E.F., that you?

920
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,950
You're a good-looking man, E.F.

921
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,029
Good looking.

922
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:25,308
But if you go away again this time,
that's the end of it.

923
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,617
That old music's drove you crazy.

924
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,439
It's hurt me.

925
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,742
Worse yet, it's hurt them children.

926
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,735
Do you think children raise themselves,
do you?

927
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,726
No. No. I know they don't.

928
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,412
Them children need you, E.F.

929
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,794
They need you.

930
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,653
-Hear me?
-Yeah.

931
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,489
I know.

932
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,460
Most thought the old man had returned
to make peace with his family.

933
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,195
The boy knew different.

934
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,312
He knew the old man
had made peace with no one.

935
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,034
After a while it occurred to him

936
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,705
that the old man
was making peace with himself

937
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,326
and that had probably been a good part
of the problem all along.

938
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,952
Thank you, Fleming. Thank you very much.

939
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,789
Have a nice weekend, everybody.
See you on Monday.

940
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,839
E.F., look who it is.

941
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,150
-How's it going?
-Daddy!

942
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,595
Come on!

943
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,294
-Let's go! Let's go.
-Okay.

944
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,472
One, two, three, whoa...

945
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:22,170
