1
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:38,984
<i>My favorite children's book
is about a little prince...</i>

2
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:42,112
<i>who came to Earth from a distant asteroid.</i>

3
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:46,125
<i>He meets a pilot
whose plane has crashed in a desert.</i>

4
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:49,128
<i>The little prince teaches the pilot many things...</i>

5
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:51,528
<i>but mainly about love.</i>

6
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:54,567
<i>My father always told me
I was like the little prince.</i>

7
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:56,569
<i>But after I met Adam...</i>

8
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:59,629
<i>I realized I was the pilot all along.</i>

9
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:50,140
- Morning, Adam.
- Good morning, Kelli.

10
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:55,982
<i>- Good morning, Lulu.
- Good morning, Adam.</i>

11
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:00,986
I don't know what to say.

12
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:02,715
- Say anything.
- Okay.

13
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:05,883
Adam Raki is the cutest guy in the office.
How's that?

14
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,722
- That's fine.
- Morning, Adam.

15
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:10,786
<i>- Good morning, Mr. Klieber!
- Morning, Kelli.</i>

16
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:13,890
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Adam!

17
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,594
- How did she do that?
- What?

18
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:17,933
How did she know it was me
and then you talking?

19
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:19,733
Voice recognition.

20
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:24,505
I put in voice patterns from some people
and added SPLICE to the recognition system.

21
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:29,208
SPLICE stands for "Stereo-based Piece-wise
Linear Compensation for Environment."

22
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:31,614
- It's an algorithm that I placed–
- Adam. Adam.

23
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:33,619
Did Chatty Patty have SPLICE?

24
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:36,212
<i>Did Big Mouth Billy Bass have SPLICE?</i>

25
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:38,655
But you said I could make her sound like Kelli.

26
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:42,718
I said she could sound like Kelli.
I didn't say to give her free will.

27
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:45,458
She doesn't have free will.

28
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:50,196
<i>5,000 at a hundred dollars,
not five at a thousand dollars. Capisce?</i>

29
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:56,073
- Good-bye, Mr. Klieber.
- Good-bye, Adam.

30
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,350
<i>All of which gives us the rare opportunity...</i>

31
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:48,360
to explore the mysterious terrain...

32
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:51,727
that lies between fame and craft...

33
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:55,757
between the public persona
and the private, precious self.

34
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:59,203
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Actors Studio is proud to welcome...

35
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:01,206
an actress we admire...

36
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:03,139
Julia Roberts.

37
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,811
Perfect.

38
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:21,259
- Oh.
- Is this open?

39
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,564
I mean, to residents. Do you have a key?

40
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:27,896
Yes.

41
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:31,301
I just moved in. Beth Buchwald, 3A.

42
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:33,430
Adam. Second floor. Two.

43
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:37,208
You're not doing your laundry?

44
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:41,247
Oh. Yeah.

45
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:44,374
Looks like a bit of an emergency.

46
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:49,247
Would you mind letting me in?

47
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,781
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
- Thanks.

48
00:06:56,997 --> 00:07:00,091
I mean, I loved it. Downtown's my hood.

49
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:04,569
But this place is bigger
and it's right around the corner from Wildwood.

50
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:07,402
Can you see the sky from the third floor?

51
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:11,103
I guess I would if the windows
weren't covered in soot.

52
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:13,441
Some nerve, right...

53
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:16,778
calling a school in the middle of Manhattan
Wildwood?

54
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,944
It's just temporary, actually.

55
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,148
The job, not the name of the school.

56
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:26,158
I'm a writer. For children.
So it's a good experience.

57
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:30,829
What do you do?

58
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:33,024
I help make toys.

59
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,033
Oh, you're an elf?

60
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:37,729
No, I'm an electronic engineer.

61
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:41,865
Oh. You need a card for the wash.

62
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:44,274
No, I've got one.

63
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:48,280
Funny. I think I left mine upstairs in my packet.

64
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:50,282
Could I borrow yours for now?

65
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,341
Okay.

66
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,382
Oh. Right.

67
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,920
Thanks.

68
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,291
Good. Good work, Beth.

69
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,369
Hi, neighbor.

70
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:20,971
There are new images of Saturn
from the Cassini Project.

71
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:32,916
Oh.

72
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:34,688
God.

73
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:38,322
<i>I always wish I knew more about space.</i>

74
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,229
You did? Like what?

75
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:44,800
I don't know. You know, what's out there.

76
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,436
You have to narrow that down.

77
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:50,442
Yeah, I guess you're right.

78
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,944
Well, I have books, telescopes, star charts.

79
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:54,947
You could borrow some stuff.

80
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:59,008
We could go out,
look at the sky... t-tonight.

81
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:01,280
Maybe sometime. Sure.

82
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:03,947
Okay.

83
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,722
Well, I'll just be hauling these enormous
grocery bags upstairs now.

84
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:11,889
Okay.

85
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,557
Okay.

86
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,756
What are you doing?

87
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,597
Oh.

88
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,432
People watching.

89
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:54,769
Anyone in particular?

90
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:58,577
Just people.

91
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:08,645
Listen, I'm going out with some friends
tonight, later, if you want to come.

92
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:10,655
Oh.

93
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:14,090
<i>They're people,
so you might want to... watch them.</i>

94
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,321
Uh-huh.

95
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:18,626
But if not, you know, that's fine.

96
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:22,964
No, I want to go,
but, um, I– I don't think I can.

97
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:25,971
- Okay, if you're busy.
- No.

98
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,669
I mean, it's not a date. It's just a little
moving-in celebration, you know.

99
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:32,301
When?

100
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:34,812
8:00. 8:00-ish.

101
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,815
Uh-huh.

102
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:38,817
Look, there's no pressure.

103
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:42,218
I'll just knock on your door
on my way out, and if you can, you can.

104
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:45,120
<i>- Okay.
- Yeah?</i>

105
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:46,852
<i>- Yeah.
- Okay.</i>

106
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,706
Adam?

107
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,342
<i>Adam.</i>

108
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:22,044
<i>- See you later!
- Good night!</i>

109
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:31,820
I'm sorry I didn't come out with your friends.

110
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:33,798
No problem.

111
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:36,892
I get kind of overloaded.

112
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,538
I have something to show you.

113
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,368
Come in. Come in.

114
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:53,845
Oh, my!

115
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:00,452
<i>You said you want to know more about space.</i>

116
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:04,761
<i>Because it looks like this
people think of it as still...</i>

117
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:06,765
<i>even though we know its expanding.</i>

118
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,768
<i>All parts of the universe
are moving away from one another...</i>

119
00:13:09,836 --> 00:13:12,270
<i>most of them faster than the speed of light,
except for-</i>

120
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:15,273
I thought nothing went faster
than the speed of light.

121
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:19,334
<i>Right, right. Nothing goes
through space faster, but space itself g-</i>

122
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:22,813
<i>Do you know about the Big Bang?</i>

123
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:26,045
A little. In the beginning, God crea–

124
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:29,555
<i>The inflation theory says the Big Bang came
from as little as a 20-pound chunk of space...</i>

125
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:31,385
about 14 billion years ago...

126
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:35,393
<i>that expanded to the size of the universe
in 10 to the minus-39 seconds.</i>

127
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:37,588
Ten to the minus-39?

128
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:39,598
A decimal point, 39 zeros, and then a one.

129
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,829
That's the fraction of a second
in which the universe was formed.

130
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:45,370
<i>That's billions and billions of times
faster than light.</i>

131
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:49,033
Ooh, that's... fast.

132
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:52,037
Yeah.

133
00:13:57,317 --> 00:13:59,182
Wow!

134
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:03,211
These are all pictures of stars and galaxies
that have been traveling away from us...

135
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:06,986
for hundreds of millions or billions of years.

136
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,656
<i>But that's still nearby compared to
most of the universe that we'll never see.</i>

137
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:13,562
Never?

138
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:17,330
<i>Well, things that move apart faster than light
can't ever see one another...</i>

139
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,701
because the light from one
never catches up to the other.

140
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:21,706
<i>After the Big Bang...</i>

141
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:24,265
the expansion of the universe slowed down.

142
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:26,403
But then, after seven billion years...

143
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,709
<i>for some reason it speeded up again...</i>

144
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:31,113
<i>and it's been speeding up ever since.</i>

145
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:35,245
Someday everything you see here
will disappear forever.

146
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,623
<i>And eventually the night sky...</i>

147
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:41,353
will be almost completely dark.

148
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:49,226
That's kinda sad.

149
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:52,064
Sad?

150
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:53,571
Hmm.

151
00:14:57,844 --> 00:15:01,439
I have been talking too much, so–

152
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:04,005
No, it's... fascinating.

153
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,052
- But I talk too much when I get excited.
- No, really.

154
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,054
It's– It's amazing.

155
00:15:09,122 --> 00:15:12,057
Well, I could tell you quickly
about M-brane theory.

156
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,559
Oh, no, it's okay. Maybe next time.

157
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:16,618
Okay. It's very speculative.

158
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:19,827
Well, I should go.

159
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:25,036
Good night, Beth.

160
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:27,095
Good night.

161
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:33,676
Thanks. I love your planetarium.

162
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:36,044
Oh. You're welcome.

163
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,393
Oh, I could have waited, Daddy.

164
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:51,396
Not another day.
I wanted you out of that rat trap for five years.

165
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:54,922
- They were mice.
- But I was right, wasn't I? You love it.

166
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:58,198
It's okay. It's not like the Village.
I've only met one person so far.

167
00:15:58,271 --> 00:16:01,206
- It's new.
- He did have a planetarium
in his living room though.

168
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:03,139
You were in someone's living room.

169
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:05,143
He's cute. He lives in the building.

170
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,145
Whatever happened to Rich Lippmann?

171
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:08,840
Not going there.

172
00:16:08,915 --> 00:16:12,180
But what was the name of his company?
Founder's Fund?

173
00:16:13,186 --> 00:16:14,813
Okay. Okay.

174
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:17,287
So, your neighbor's an astronomer?

175
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:20,291
No, he's an electronic engineer,
whatever that means.

176
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:23,624
- But he hasn't even said hello to me
since the first time, so–
- So, he's an idiot.

177
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:25,391
No, it's me.

178
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:29,902
Didn't anyone tell you and Mom
that only children are emotional retards...

179
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:33,200
spoilt, too trusting and unequipped to cope?

180
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:35,206
What were you thinking?

181
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:37,265
That we had one perfect child.

182
00:16:40,947 --> 00:16:42,414
How's school?

183
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:44,575
We just started.

184
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,915
"The course of civilization is a race
between catastrophe and education."

185
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:50,547
- John F. Kennedy.
- I know.

186
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:52,591
Well, if you marry an investment banker...

187
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:54,592
you could do whatever you want.

188
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,390
Rich Lippmann is a dick, Daddy.
Can we leave it at that?

189
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,431
Don't say "dick" to your father.

190
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:03,060
No one's perfect, Bethy. That's all I'm saying.

191
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:08,234
<i>But their sensor systems have detected
an error in analyzing space radiation.</i>

192
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:11,435
Adam, I'm having lunch.

193
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:13,445
- Speak English.
- I'm sorry.

194
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:15,447
You see, the Star Tracker system is–

195
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:20,953
No. No more background radiation
black holes or Mars robots.

196
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,079
Lunchtime is for guy talk.

197
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:27,683
Two guys talking about women,
the weather and such. You got it?

198
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,889
- But the Star Tracker system–
- No.

199
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:40,262
Hmm.

200
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,273
A woman moved into 3A.

201
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:45,401
<i>All right. Now, that's lunch talk.</i>

202
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:47,912
So?

203
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,914
So, that's all.

204
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:53,349
Come on. A woman moved into 3A.

205
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:55,546
She looked–

206
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,555
She looked nice.

207
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:00,091
Good. Good!

208
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,328
- You gonna meet her?
- I did.

209
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:04,988
You did?

210
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:08,056
We did laundry. She came to my apartment.

211
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:11,069
- She did?
- Yeah, I told her something about space.

212
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:14,072
- Oh, Jesus. How'd she take it?
- She liked it.

213
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,573
She–

214
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,633
Well, bless my stars. You gonna see her again?

215
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:20,975
I see her almost every day.

216
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:22,981
You talk to her again?

217
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:25,449
No.

218
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,452
Adam.

219
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,454
You're the man.

220
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:32,616
You have to start the conversation.
Ask her out. Take her to dinner.

221
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:35,126
I can't do that. H-How–

222
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:38,696
Hmm.

223
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:41,494
This jackass locked himself out of his car.

224
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,865
Figures he can cuss me out on the phone.

225
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:47,428
Well, he ought to be chilled by now.

226
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:49,736
Harlan–

227
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:53,111
Follow through, young man.

228
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,170
Follow through.

229
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,678
<i>Are you and Mom still going to Barbados this year?</i>

230
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:03,847
- Well, we're still deciding.
- Oh. Really?

231
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:07,859
There's a little problem
that has to be dealt with.

232
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:10,020
- Between you and Mom?
- No, no.

233
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:12,724
- At the firm.
- Oh.

234
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,426
There was an indictment last March.

235
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:17,765
There was an indictment of the firm?

236
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:21,068
No, of me, personally, no less.

237
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,701
It's nothing.
Some junior G-man playing Clarence Darrow.

238
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:27,211
But there's a trial date now.January 19.

239
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,715
- A trial?
- Yeah, so we have to work
everything out before then.

240
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:33,081
But bullshit, if you'll excuse the expression...

241
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:35,086
expands to fill the allotted time...

242
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:37,088
so now Barbados is up in the air.

243
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:41,183
Daddy!

244
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,852
Don't worry.

245
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:45,362
But if you happen to come up
with the next Harry Potter...

246
00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:47,592
we may need it to pay the ganef lawyers.

247
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,158
<i>- Over Friday for dinner, right?
- Yeah.</i>

248
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:53,334
<i>- I love you, Daddy.
- Love ya!</i>

249
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:29,134
<i>Beth?</i>

250
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:38,710
<i>Beth?</i>

251
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:42,510
Adam!

252
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:46,524
I'm so sorry.
I just don't feel like any company tonight.

253
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:48,856
<i>Oh, that's okay.</i>

254
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:51,920
<i>Come out with me. I wanna show you something.</i>

255
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,062
<i>Beth?</i>

256
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,508
- Adam, the park's closed.
- J-Just a little bit further.

257
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:06,841
- I wanna go back! I'm not–
- Shh-shh-shh. Over here.

258
00:21:15,955 --> 00:21:18,583
- Adam, I–
- Shh-shh-shh!

259
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:48,946
Raccoon in Central Park?

260
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:08,837
That was so cool.

261
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:11,741
What are they doing here?

262
00:22:11,811 --> 00:22:14,041
Foraging.

263
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:17,048
- How did you know where they'd be?
- They live here.

264
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,051
I used to come and watch them a lot.

265
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,781
It's quiet.

266
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:32,160
They don't really belong here,
you know, but here they are.

267
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:36,224
They're coming back around in a little while.
You wanna wait?

268
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:39,064
Yeah, sure.

269
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,237
Oh. Mr. Klieber.

270
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:16,240
Yes. That's all right. I startled you.

271
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:18,606
Yes.

272
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:22,909
I just wanted to tell you what a good job
you've done for us the last year and a half.

273
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:25,177
Well, that's good.

274
00:23:25,251 --> 00:23:27,276
When your father explained your–

275
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:30,345
When he explained your... things...

276
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:34,492
well, I had my– my doubts,
but he was right.

277
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,428
A man of your background at the salary you're
getting has been a value to this company.

278
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:40,931
- Well, that's good.
- Yes.

279
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,800
But the world is changing.
You can't be the corner candy store anymore.

280
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,498
- You've got to compete.
- Candy store?

281
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:50,804
5,000 at a hundred, not five at a thousand.

282
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:53,606
Adam, I've got to let you go.

283
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,137
But I will write you a recommendation
that will knock your socks off.

284
00:23:57,216 --> 00:24:00,151
- L-Let me go?
- I'm truly sorry.

285
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:02,517
Yeah, but I– I don't wanna go.
I haven't finished.

286
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:04,988
I have a bid, Adam. It's done.

287
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:09,125
<i>- You found a better chip?
- Not better.</i>

288
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:10,889
Cheaper.

289
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:13,158
Look, go home.

290
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:15,257
Talk it over with your dad.

291
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:17,859
- I'm sure he'll find you another job.
- No, my dad–

292
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:20,997
Kelli has your severance.
It's been a pleasure working with you.

293
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:25,601
And I mean that sincerely. Good-bye, Adam.

294
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:29,305
<i>Good-bye, Mr. Klieber.</i>

295
00:24:35,955 --> 00:24:37,946
Adam, dude. Sorry about that, man.

296
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:41,356
Don't think about it, bro.
Something will come up, man. I promise.

297
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:48,990
I'm so sorry, Adam.

298
00:24:49,068 --> 00:24:50,797
<i>See you around, okay?</i>

299
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:10,711
Excuse me, sir. What are you doing there?

300
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:13,547
- I said, what you doin'?
- Watching the children.

301
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:16,315
Uh-huh. Let me have some I.D., sir.

302
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:18,754
I-I was looking at the children.

303
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:22,191
Sir, turn around.
Put your hands on the fence, please.

304
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:25,924
- Why–Why are you doing this?
- Lean forward, put your hands on the fence, please.

305
00:26:25,998 --> 00:26:27,795
Turn around!

306
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,300
Hands on the fence.

307
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:32,303
What–What are you doing?

308
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:35,306
I'm taking your wallet out of your back pocket
to check your identification, sir.

309
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:38,741
- 1 5-Adam to Central-K,
I need a name check. Adam Raki.
- Let's go.

310
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:42,508
- Is this the man you reported?
- I wasn't the one who saw him.

311
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:44,606
Where do you live, sir?

312
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:47,117
Please stay where you are.

313
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:50,280
Do you live or do you have business
in this neighborhood, sir?

314
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:52,653
Everything's fine. Go on back inside.

315
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:55,852
Beth!

316
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:58,328
- Are you the one who reported this?
- Adam.

317
00:26:58,397 --> 00:27:01,025
<i>- What's going on?
- You know this man?</i>

318
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,796
Yeah, he's my neighbor. What happened?

319
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:06,770
<i>I–
1 5-Adam. Raki- R-A-K-I. No hits.</i>

320
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:10,104
<i>- He's clean.
- All right. Sorry about that.</i>

321
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:12,666
<i>Can't be too careful with kids, right?</i>

322
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:14,735
You can go.

323
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:21,843
Adam!

324
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,975
<i>Adam?</i>

325
00:27:47,713 --> 00:27:50,511
Enough with the presents, okay?

326
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:53,312
Well, that was kind of awful, wasn't it?

327
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:58,516
I mean, God, you just stopped by
to watch the kids. I do that for a living.

328
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:08,894
- Police freak me out too. Okay?
- Do you wanna come in?

329
00:28:10,903 --> 00:28:12,564
Okay.

330
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:23,305
So, you live alone?

331
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:25,475
Yes.

332
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:28,577
I mean, it's– it's big for one person.

333
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:31,516
For the city.

334
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,683
Well, my father lived here too.

335
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,556
Oh! Where is he now?

336
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:37,561
- Queens.
- Queens.

337
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:39,756
He died six weeks ago.

338
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:42,925
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

339
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:46,562
My friend Harlan says Queens
is where everybody goes to die...

340
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:48,970
because they can't tell the difference.

341
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:52,977
That's–That's awful.

342
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:56,071
Harlan said it was a joke.

343
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:58,912
Oh, I meant about your father.

344
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:00,645
Uh–

345
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:06,221
- What about your mother?
- She died when I was eight.

346
00:29:09,328 --> 00:29:11,319
I'm so sorry.

347
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:18,225
I had a really nice time last night in the park.

348
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:22,230
Were you excited?

349
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:26,443
- What?
- Sexually, when we were in the park.

350
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:32,643
No, not exactly.

351
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:36,677
Well, I ask because I was,
and I wondered if you were too.

352
00:29:39,224 --> 00:29:42,159
Thank you so much for the glass of water.

353
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:45,822
I– I should– I should be going now.

354
00:29:45,897 --> 00:29:48,161
Because I said that thing
about being sexually excited?

355
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:50,258
No! No, no. I just–

356
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:52,269
Well– yeah.

357
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:54,430
Oh–

358
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:57,942
Sometimes it's hard for me to-

359
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:03,537
<i>I have this thing
that makes it hard to, um- to a-</i>

360
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:06,914
It's called Asperger's syndrome.

361
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:08,782
Oh.

362
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:18,389
One thing about it is not knowing
what people are thinking.

363
00:30:20,032 --> 00:30:21,966
<i>- Like right now.
- Oh. Right.</i>

364
00:30:22,034 --> 00:30:27,529
I guess I was wondering
what that feels like for you.

365
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:31,235
<i>It doesn't feel like anything. It just is.</i>

366
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,471
Okay.

367
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,873
My brain works differently from N.T.'s.

368
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:39,178
N.T.'s?

369
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:41,412
Neurotypicals.

370
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:43,420
Sometimes I can't understand them...

371
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:46,548
especially when they mean something different
from what they're actually saying.

372
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,490
You don't do that?

373
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,790
No, most Aspies are really honest.

374
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:53,592
Psychologists think
it's a lack of imagination.

375
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:56,031
But psychologists are mostly N.T.'s.

376
00:30:56,101 --> 00:31:00,435
Albert Einstein, Thomas Jefferson, Mozart,
they all had lots of imagination.

377
00:31:00,505 --> 00:31:02,871
They had Asperger's?

378
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:05,068
Probably.

379
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:09,246
When I was younger...

380
00:31:09,314 --> 00:31:12,249
I would have just thought
you were sexually excited because I was.

381
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:15,252
That's called mind blindness.

382
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,380
I had to learn to ask
what other people are thinking.

383
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:23,859
I understand.

384
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:26,261
It's okay.

385
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:28,697
Oh.

386
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:32,100
I re– I really should go.

387
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,865
Okay.

388
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:39,609
I'm really sorry about your father.

389
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:42,169
Oh.

390
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:44,374
Can I see you again?

391
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:49,312
Um, well, I'm– I'm right upstairs, so–

392
00:31:49,388 --> 00:31:52,016
Great. Okay. I'll see you.

393
00:31:57,462 --> 00:31:59,396
Hi.

394
00:32:06,872 --> 00:32:09,966
- Do you have a minute?
- Oh, hey, Beth. Sure. Come on in.

395
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,804
Thank you.

396
00:32:11,877 --> 00:32:15,369
Oh, you think it's a bad sign
when the description of a school...

397
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:17,574
bores its director?

398
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:20,049
Um–

399
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:23,053
What do you know about Asperger's syndrome?

400
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:25,055
Oh.

401
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:29,150
Well, it's a developmental disorder,
kind of a high-functioning autism.

402
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:31,787
What does that mean exactly?

403
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:34,798
Well, there's a broad range.
It could be hard to tell.

404
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:39,462
- It could be severe social interaction problems.
- Uh-huh.

405
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:42,632
Maybe I should get in on this,
interview the child and we can get some ser–

406
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:44,641
Oh, no, no. It's my neighbor.

407
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:46,643
He has it.

408
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:49,475
But he's really, really sweet...

409
00:32:49,548 --> 00:32:53,348
and kind of interesting.

410
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:56,785
Yeah, sometimes they can be quite brilliant.

411
00:32:56,855 --> 00:32:59,688
It is on the autism spectrum.

412
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:03,124
Oh, you know, actually I think I have a–

413
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:07,588
<i>This is a first-person account.
Pretending to be Normal.</i>

414
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:11,033
Oh, no, it's– it's not– it's not serious–

415
00:33:11,102 --> 00:33:12,899
- Hmm. Okay.
- Thank you.

416
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:14,734
Sure.

417
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:18,367
Oh, Beth? Would you
just take a look at this for me, please?

418
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:20,070
Sure.

419
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:24,582
So, you're saying, really,
that he's not prime relationship material.

420
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:27,743
- Right?
- Um–

421
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:29,684
Not really.

422
00:33:29,754 --> 00:33:32,245
- Well, well, it–
- No. That's okay.

423
00:33:35,594 --> 00:33:37,357
Thanks.

424
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:41,896
So, um, subtracting your father's liabilities–

425
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:45,801
uh, credit card debt,
funeral costs, fees, et cetera–

426
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:50,399
<i>from his assets reduces the, uh- the estate-</i>

427
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:52,670
roughly, $25,000.

428
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:56,271
And he bequeathed $5,000...

429
00:33:56,348 --> 00:33:59,078
<i>to the Kids at Risk Music Fund...</i>

430
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,914
<i>$ 10,000 to you, Mr. Keats.</i>

431
00:34:01,987 --> 00:34:03,420
Oh.

432
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:07,424
So, as his primary beneficiary, Adam–Adam?

433
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:09,722
You inherit the remainder.

434
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:12,888
<i>That would be the death benefit from Juilliard...</i>

435
00:34:12,964 --> 00:34:15,728
and the funds from the T.I.A.A. retirement plan.

436
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,931
<i>Also, there's approximately
$300,000 worth of equity in the apartment.</i>

437
00:34:21,006 --> 00:34:25,375
<i>- So, assuming you sell,
after closing fees and taxes, et cetera-
- Sell what?</i>

438
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:29,106
We presumed that you'd be moving
to a smaller place.

439
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,546
Move?

440
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:34,710
<i>Without your father's income,
the mortgage payments are-</i>

441
00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:36,481
I don't wanna move.

442
00:34:36,555 --> 00:34:38,113
Easy.

443
00:34:38,189 --> 00:34:41,625
Think of it as an opportunity.
You might wanna try a different city.

444
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:44,895
<i>Mr. Wardlow...</i>

445
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:48,626
Adam has never been out of the city
alone in his life.

446
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,827
Well closer to home then.

447
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:55,965
- With the income from your job–
- I don't have a job. I was fired from my job.

448
00:34:56,041 --> 00:35:00,774
<i>Oh. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. That makes
the equity in the apartment even more valuable.</i>

449
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:03,575
- Changes like this are hard.
- I won't sell my house.

450
00:35:03,648 --> 00:35:06,344
- Mr. Raki, I–
- Go away! You're hurting my ears!

451
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:09,819
- I'm not gonna sell my house.
I'm not selling my house!
- Calm down.

452
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:12,118
Cross your arms over your chest.

453
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:19,257
Mr. Wardlow, are we done?

454
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:22,198
There are papers to be signed.

455
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:25,100
- Can you send them?
- They need to be notar–

456
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:29,862
Yes. Yes. Yes. We, uh–We can do that.

457
00:35:29,941 --> 00:35:33,570
Come on, Adam, let's go.

458
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:36,273
I can't–

459
00:35:36,348 --> 00:35:38,612
I ca– I can't move.

460
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:40,378
All right.

461
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:42,113
Come on.

462
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:50,919
<i>You're not 10 years old anymore. You need a job.</i>

463
00:35:50,996 --> 00:35:53,965
- I got fired.
- So what?

464
00:35:54,032 --> 00:35:56,500
You know how many times I've been fired?

465
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:58,900
<i>When your dad and I came back from the service...</i>

466
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,905
<i>I might as well have had a three-day week.</i>

467
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:04,168
Day one, I hate the freakin' job.

468
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:06,437
Day two, I hate the freakin' boss.

469
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:09,446
Day three, I hit someone
and I gotta start all over.

470
00:36:09,514 --> 00:36:12,813
I didn't hit anyone. I never hit anyone.

471
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:18,122
<i>Adam, you're 29 years old.</i>

472
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:22,023
You can't pay your mortgage
without finding a job.

473
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:24,323
So what are you gonna do?

474
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:05,902
<i>Hey, Bethy-boo.
Just wanted to make sure you got home okay.</i>

475
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,666
<i>You home okay? Call us.</i>

476
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,174
<i>Beth. Are you there?</i>

477
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:14,678
<i>Look, maybe the whole point was for me
to find out what an amazing thing we have.</i>

478
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:17,146
<i>You're not really gonna throw this awa-</i>

479
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,327
A-Adam? Wha–

480
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:36,060
What?

481
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:40,094
Get in here!

482
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:57,311
Wh-What? What in the world
were you doing out there?

483
00:37:57,388 --> 00:37:59,322
You could have been killed.

484
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:02,757
- How were you gonna get down?
- Climb up.

485
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:06,558
- Climb?
- It's rated for 3,000 pounds.

486
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:09,998
You said you couldn't see out of your windows.

487
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,431
I'm sorry!

488
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:23,507
Why did you scream like that?

489
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:27,381
Because I walked into my apartment
and there was this strange man in my window.

490
00:38:27,452 --> 00:38:30,512
- It was me!
- But I didn't know that.

491
00:38:45,537 --> 00:38:48,028
Oh.

492
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:49,767
I guess not.

493
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:54,007
Thank you for trying to–

494
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:56,137
You're welcome.

495
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:58,444
Would you, um–

496
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:00,677
Would you like some tea?

497
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:03,878
Uh–

498
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:06,185
- Sure.
- Okay.

499
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:16,366
Harlan said I should send out application letters
and worry about the interviews later.

500
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:18,163
Interviews?

501
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:20,898
Interviews usually don't go very well.

502
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,467
<i>But you put in some applications?</i>

503
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:26,510
Eighty-seven.

504
00:39:26,578 --> 00:39:28,205
- Eighty-seven?
- Mm-hmm.

505
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:31,214
Applications and letters of inquiry.

506
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:34,251
- You applied for 87 jobs?
- Including the letters of inquiry.

507
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:36,879
<i>- Today?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

508
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,048
- Wow.
- "Wow"?

509
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:44,686
I mean, that's a lot.

510
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:46,855
Well, I don't wanna move.

511
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:50,032
Yeah.

512
00:39:53,104 --> 00:39:56,232
This is very good-smelling tea.

513
00:39:56,307 --> 00:40:00,903
English breakfast. My father calls it
coffee without the bad breath.

514
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:22,456
Maybe I should go.

515
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:25,161
I'm sorry. I'm just–

516
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:27,170
S-Sorry? You're s–

517
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:29,433
- I'm a little upset.
- Oh.

518
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:33,273
My father's an accountant...

519
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:36,336
and he's been accused
of doing something illegal.

520
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:38,143
Oh. Did he do it?

521
00:40:38,216 --> 00:40:40,150
No. No.

522
00:40:40,218 --> 00:40:45,884
But tonight he said it looks like
he will probably have to go on trial...

523
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:51,020
and I know that your father just passed away,
so I shouldn't even–

524
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:02,937
Um, I–

525
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:07,510
I can see that you're upset...

526
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:11,378
but I don't know what to do.

527
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:22,222
Could you give me a hug?

528
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:25,453
Yes.

529
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:29,990
Adam, I'd like you to give me a hug.

530
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:45,879
<i>"'But he's naked, 'cried a little boy.</i>

531
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,316
"All the people whispered among each other.
'He's naked!

532
00:41:48,386 --> 00:41:52,015
"There's a little boy
who says the king is naked!'

533
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,082
"The king shivered, for he was sure
that the boy was right, but he thought...

534
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:58,458
"'I must bear it until the procession is over.'

535
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:03,466
And he walked even more proudly
all the way back to the palace."

536
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:08,267
So, what do we think?

537
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:11,306
He was naked.

538
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:15,942
He ran around the whole town naked.

539
00:42:16,014 --> 00:42:19,541
Yes, okay, he was naked. Anything else?

540
00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:21,710
The little boy was bad.

541
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:24,016
Really? Why do you say that, Stephanie?

542
00:42:24,088 --> 00:42:26,022
<i>- Because he told.
- That's dumb!</i>

543
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,854
<i>- Bruce.
- But he was naked!</i>

544
00:42:28,926 --> 00:42:33,454
Don't you think the king
needed to know that he was naked?

545
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:35,795
Well, he didn't have to yell it out.

546
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:38,927
He could have just gone over to him
and whispered it in his ear.

547
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:42,996
<i>Everybody else was just lying
so nobody'd think they were stupid...</i>

548
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:46,100
and because they were afraid
of seeing the king's weenie.

549
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:50,409
- Weenie!
- Weenie!

550
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:52,415
I like the boy.

551
00:42:55,453 --> 00:42:57,387
I do too.

552
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:18,804
Maybe we should go.

553
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:20,468
Our table's next.

554
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,280
You can't eat macaroni and cheese every night.

555
00:43:26,884 --> 00:43:31,116
- Why not?
- Because it's a meager life. Lacks stimulation.

556
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:38,051
Thanks for coming. I-I know it's hard.

557
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:40,063
Okay.

558
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:56,336
This is better, right?

559
00:43:57,381 --> 00:43:59,975
Hello. I'm Rom with an "M."

560
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:04,283
I see you have drinks. Would you like
a wine list, or may I describe the specials?

561
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:07,051
It's all right. Um, we know what we'd like.

562
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,059
We'll take two tricolored salads...

563
00:44:09,127 --> 00:44:14,793
one grilled salmon on lentils
with roasted potatoes and a Penne Alfredo.

564
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,891
- And Ron?
- It's Rom.

565
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:21,166
Sorry. Rom. Could we get that all to go?

566
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:35,750
It's macaroni and cheese!

567
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,789
- When in Rom.
- What?

568
00:44:40,124 --> 00:44:43,184
How's the job hunt going?

569
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:45,525
A lot of them were already taken.

570
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:47,325
I'm still getting responses though.

571
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:50,333
I'm sure the right thing will come along.

572
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:52,835
How can you be sure of that?

573
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:55,896
<i>I mean, I hope the right thing comes along.</i>

574
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:04,881
My dad and I came out here
to watch Hale-Bopp for five nights in a row.

575
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:10,886
<i>Voyager 2 will pass within
4.3 light-years of Sirius, the dog star...</i>

576
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:13,287
in approximately 196,000 years.

577
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:15,450
I brought you something.

578
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,758
Oh. Are there supposed to be presents?

579
00:45:21,832 --> 00:45:25,962
No, no. It was just
a spur of the moment kind of thing.

580
00:45:34,645 --> 00:45:39,139
<i>"How to Find Work That Works
for People with Asper-"</i>

581
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:46,085
I thought it might be helpful.

582
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:50,450
Are you offended?

583
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:55,058
No.

584
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:58,568
'Cause I was just trying to help.

585
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:28,888
Thank you.

586
00:46:30,701 --> 00:46:32,692
You're welcome.

587
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:41,875
<i>Try to be careful.</i>

588
00:46:43,814 --> 00:46:47,875
I had my heart broken by a big jerk recently.

589
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:53,212
I need time to take things slowly.

590
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:56,416
What did he do?

591
00:46:58,262 --> 00:47:02,028
While we were together,
he slept with other women.

592
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,272
<i>Not together together,
but while we were in the relationship.</i>

593
00:47:14,378 --> 00:47:16,141
Oh.

594
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:24,151
So, I need to take things slowly.

595
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:28,091
- No sex.
- Right.

596
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:29,922
- Kissing.
- Yes.

597
00:47:29,994 --> 00:47:31,484
- Holding.
- Yes.

598
00:47:31,562 --> 00:47:33,189
And no sex.

599
00:47:33,264 --> 00:47:35,255
Is that all right?

600
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,031
Yes.

601
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:48,436
<i>It's only been a month!</i>

602
00:47:48,512 --> 00:47:52,642
How long it should be before you meet Adam
is not written in scripture, Daddy.

603
00:47:52,717 --> 00:47:54,878
You've just–You made that up.

604
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:01,354
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

605
00:48:04,028 --> 00:48:07,327
Has there been any more news
on the– on the court–

606
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,861
Okay.

607
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:13,460
Okay. Sure.

608
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:16,062
I will. I'll tell him.

609
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,200
Okay. I love you, Daddy. Bye.

610
00:48:20,745 --> 00:48:24,112
<i>You can stay for an hour.
You might even have fun.</i>

611
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:26,115
Well, I'd have fun at home.

612
00:48:26,183 --> 00:48:28,913
It's not the gates of hell, Adam.
It's my friends.

613
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:35,685
- You look great.
- You've gotta meet the baby.

614
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,753
Her name is Ling Yao,
which means beautiful jade treasure.

615
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,798
- That's beautiful.
- Don't you think?

616
00:48:41,866 --> 00:48:46,098
I mean, really, she is young enough.
We could call her anything.

617
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,104
- Her name is Ling Yao.
- That's what I said.

618
00:48:48,172 --> 00:48:50,800
<i>- Well, that's who she was when we got her.
- Oh, she's asleep.</i>

619
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:54,276
<i>- I know. Look at her.
- Yeah, she is.</i>

620
00:48:54,345 --> 00:48:56,279
We have a video, of course.

621
00:48:56,347 --> 00:48:58,474
Would you like to see the video?

622
00:48:58,549 --> 00:49:01,518
No, thank you. Where's the bathroom?

623
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:05,912
Down the hall, second right.

624
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:12,696
I'd love to see the video.

625
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:15,323
<i>- Oh, so now you're an expert.
- Oh, come on.</i>

626
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:18,061
Tory, you don't have to know a lot about Islam...

627
00:49:18,135 --> 00:49:22,595
to understand hunger or–
or anger or desperation. I mean–

628
00:49:22,673 --> 00:49:25,608
We don't understand who these people are,
how– how they think.

629
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:28,509
I don't understand people from New Jersey.

630
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:32,845
Look, either you believe that human beings
share some basic similarities...

631
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:35,044
or you just throw the towel in.

632
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,280
Buying a telescope is a complicated decision.

633
00:49:37,354 --> 00:49:40,482
<i>- You should focus on your interests.
- No pun intended.</i>

634
00:49:40,558 --> 00:49:43,686
- What?
- Focus?

635
00:49:43,761 --> 00:49:47,857
Right. A-Are you interested
in the solar system– moon, planets, et cetera?

636
00:49:47,932 --> 00:49:50,867
<i>Or deeper space-nebulae, star clusters, galaxies.</i>

637
00:49:50,935 --> 00:49:54,200
Then you want a much larger lens
with a Dobsonian mount.

638
00:49:54,271 --> 00:49:57,365
- The eight-bar refractors
go up to 180 millimeters.
- Hi, Adam.

639
00:49:57,441 --> 00:50:00,877
Hi. Michael's looking for a telescope
to buy for her cottage in Kerhonkson.

640
00:50:00,945 --> 00:50:03,140
For deep space in a static position...

641
00:50:03,214 --> 00:50:06,706
you could really think about
some bigger reflectors–

642
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:11,416
Have– Have you heard too much about telescopes?

643
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:13,423
No. No.

644
00:50:13,491 --> 00:50:16,927
It's just some of what you're saying
is going right over my head.

645
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:19,724
Oh. Okay. Well, I'll start over.

646
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:21,731
Three basic considerations.

647
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:25,166
- Kind of lens.
- Come say good-bye to Robin and Jen with me.

648
00:50:27,238 --> 00:50:29,365
All right.

649
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:33,635
- Thank you for the information.
- Oh, you're welcome.

650
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:36,009
- It's a very big decision.
- Nice to meet you, Michael.

651
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,014
And you.

652
00:50:41,285 --> 00:50:43,378
Wow.

653
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:45,953
<i>I remember the other kids...</i>

654
00:50:46,023 --> 00:50:49,356
<i>chattering away before school or...</i>

655
00:50:49,426 --> 00:50:51,724
at parties whispering to one another...

656
00:50:51,795 --> 00:50:55,526
and I'd always wonder
what they were talking about.

657
00:50:56,634 --> 00:50:59,296
Looked so easy.

658
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,463
One, then the other.

659
00:51:01,539 --> 00:51:03,530
Laugh, laugh, laugh.

660
00:51:03,607 --> 00:51:06,041
New topic. Start again.

661
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:11,640
I started outlining my new book.

662
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:15,048
- Really excited.
- Well, that's good.

663
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,610
You're going to be the first person I thank...

664
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:20,179
in my Newberry Award speech.

665
00:51:20,257 --> 00:51:22,248
It's an award for children's books.

666
00:51:22,326 --> 00:51:24,794
No, I know what a Newberry Award is.

667
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:29,262
Are you still gonna make them talk?

668
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:32,268
Mm-hmm. They're gonna be
a typical New York family...

669
00:51:32,336 --> 00:51:35,032
except they live in the park,
and they're raccoons.

670
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:42,101
Okay. Your turn.

671
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:50,886
I think the father is gonna be in advertising.

672
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:58,284
Instead of making stuff up...

673
00:51:58,362 --> 00:52:00,990
why couldn't you write about the real raccoons?

674
00:52:02,433 --> 00:52:05,561
Because it's a children's book,
not a nature book.

675
00:52:05,636 --> 00:52:08,366
Well, I'd probably like the nature book better.

676
00:52:10,207 --> 00:52:12,607
Yeah, you probably would.

677
00:52:22,853 --> 00:52:25,151
What? I didn't mean–

678
00:52:39,336 --> 00:52:41,327
This is what I meant.

679
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:53,149
Oh.

680
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:56,843
Um...

681
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,854
do you, um–

682
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:02,949
do you want sex?

683
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:06,028
I think I do.

684
00:53:14,104 --> 00:53:16,231
You said you needed time.

685
00:53:18,142 --> 00:53:21,578
Well, then take it very, very slowly.

686
00:54:27,144 --> 00:54:28,941
This isn't fair.

687
00:54:29,012 --> 00:54:31,412
<i>What's fair? It's a small manipulation.</i>

688
00:54:31,482 --> 00:54:33,473
- What, you aren't curious?
- Of course.

689
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:35,541
But if he isn't ready to meet us.

690
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:38,247
Yeah, well, sometimes
you gotta give "ready" a little push.

691
00:54:38,322 --> 00:54:40,517
- Beth?
- Honey!

692
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:44,493
Daddy! Mom! What?
You–What are you doing here?

693
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:46,791
- We're seeing the play.
- But I thought you–

694
00:54:46,864 --> 00:54:48,798
- What?
- Hi, honey.

695
00:54:48,866 --> 00:54:51,664
I thought we had your tickets.

696
00:54:51,735 --> 00:54:54,568
<i>No, we were going with the Pierces,
and they couldn't make it.</i>

697
00:54:54,638 --> 00:54:57,004
Come on! We're not ogres.
At least Becky isn't.

698
00:54:57,074 --> 00:54:59,338
- This is Beth's mother, Rebecca. I'm Marty.
- Oh.

699
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:01,400
- We've heard so much about you.
- Oh, you have?

700
00:55:01,478 --> 00:55:03,503
- Yeah.
- Lovely to meet you, Adam.

701
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,514
Oh, thank you.

702
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:08,983
- Me and my little girl, we are thick as thieves.
- Hi, Daddy.

703
00:55:09,052 --> 00:55:12,044
Hi, sweetie. I just couldn't wait any longer.

704
00:55:12,122 --> 00:55:14,056
We rarely go off-Broadway.

705
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:16,991
I didn't even know this theater still existed.

706
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:21,895
Oh, the Cherry Lane Theatre is the oldest
continuously running theater off-Broadway.

707
00:55:21,965 --> 00:55:25,731
Um– It was converted
from a box factory in 1924...

708
00:55:25,803 --> 00:55:27,998
and-and then in the '20s and '30s and '40s...

709
00:55:28,071 --> 00:55:31,097
it presented the work of writers
such as F. Scott Fitzgerald...

710
00:55:31,175 --> 00:55:33,268
John Dos Passos, Eugene O'Neill.

711
00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:36,176
I used to bone up on conversation topics, too,
when I had a date.

712
00:55:36,246 --> 00:55:38,180
- Marty!
- Ask Becky.

713
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:40,216
From 1951 to 1953, uh...

714
00:55:40,284 --> 00:55:42,844
Julian Beck and Judith Malina's
Living Theatre was based here.

715
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,856
Oh, oh! In 1952, Judith Malina chased
a fire marshal down the street...

716
00:55:46,924 --> 00:55:50,155
<i>with a spear from her production of Ubu Roi.</i>

717
00:55:50,227 --> 00:55:54,254
<i>Um, Endgame, by Samuel Beckett,
had its American premiere here in 1957...</i>

718
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:59,098
<i>followed by other new works such as Happy Days,
also by Beckett, in 1962...</i>

719
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:02,002
<i>Dutchman, in 1964, by LeRoiJones...</i>

720
00:56:02,072 --> 00:56:05,303
<i>The Happy journey to Trenton and Camden
by Thornton Wilder in 196–</i>

721
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:13,540
B-But that– that's enough
about the Cherry Lane Theatre.

722
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:15,949
Wh-What about the '7 0s?

723
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:20,046
<i>- Well, in 1971, Godspell opened and then in 197–
- Adam, Daddy's joking.</i>

724
00:56:20,123 --> 00:56:22,956
Oh. Oh.

725
00:56:23,026 --> 00:56:25,017
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

726
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:27,063
History is always very interesting.

727
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:30,099
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.
- Come on. In we go.</i>

728
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:32,101
Shall we?

729
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:46,240
<i>Oh, they're dying to go to trial
and get their pictures in the paper.</i>

730
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:48,307
<i>Well, it's-it's written all over them.</i>

731
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:51,411
<i>- What does Mr. Beranbaum say?
- He's a lawyer. He's paid to worry.</i>

732
00:56:51,488 --> 00:56:55,117
Bottom line, if the feds push this
all the way to trial, we settle.

733
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:58,161
- Right?
- He— He's sure they'll settle.

734
00:56:58,228 --> 00:56:59,991
<i>That's why you don't have to be there.</i>

735
00:57:00,063 --> 00:57:03,931
<i>- You said it would help if we showed our support.
- You had to tell her that.</i>

736
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:05,901
Your father's right. You have work.

737
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:09,496
<i>Mom, I'm covered at work.
I'm coming. I need to be there for you.</i>

738
00:57:09,573 --> 00:57:12,133
What are you accused of, Mr. Buchwald?

739
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:22,352
I'm accused of trying to help a friend.
That's what I'm accused of.

740
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:26,749
<i>- Beth's Uncle Eric-
- Eric Cooper.</i>

741
00:57:26,823 --> 00:57:29,519
- made his daughter, Jennifer,
C.F.O. of his company.
- But she's qualified, right?

742
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:31,720
- I mean, she went to Wharton.
- Yes. She's qualified.

743
00:57:31,795 --> 00:57:33,786
Uncle Eric's not really my uncle.

744
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:36,594
<i>He's an old friend of Daddy's,
and Jennifer is his daughter.</i>

745
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:39,101
She's young. She made a few mistakes.

746
00:57:39,169 --> 00:57:41,535
<i>I carried them over from one year to the next...</i>

747
00:57:41,605 --> 00:57:43,937
<i>made her look a little better,
even to her own father.</i>

748
00:57:44,007 --> 00:57:47,534
<i>It wasn't even a hard call to make,
but now they all think they've uncovered Enron.</i>

749
00:57:47,611 --> 00:57:50,580
- Could you go to jail?
- Adam!

750
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:54,083
No. I'm glad you asked.

751
00:57:54,151 --> 00:57:57,143
Bethy, I'm not going anywhere.

752
00:57:59,957 --> 00:58:02,619
Any more questions, Mr. Prosecutor?

753
00:58:02,693 --> 00:58:05,253
No.

754
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:08,560
See? He fits right in.

755
00:58:08,632 --> 00:58:11,465
<i>You put him on the spot,
confronted him, pushed him.</i>

756
00:58:11,535 --> 00:58:13,696
Well, I– I didn't understand what he was saying.

757
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:17,433
Maybe that's not his fault. Monday
he goes on trial, in case you didn't get that.

758
00:58:17,507 --> 00:58:19,532
You don't talk about going to jail!

759
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:22,271
- It seemed like the important thing.
- The important thing?

760
00:58:22,346 --> 00:58:24,337
All of a sudden you know what's important?

761
00:58:24,414 --> 00:58:26,712
You can't say two words
on how you feel about anything...

762
00:58:26,783 --> 00:58:28,774
but you know what's important to my family.

763
00:58:28,852 --> 00:58:31,878
- I-I do–
- You know, my father's not some criminal, okay?

764
00:58:31,955 --> 00:58:34,947
- Oh, okay.
- Just forget it!

765
00:58:35,025 --> 00:58:38,825
- Beth?
- I'm going home! And please don't follow me!

766
00:59:07,057 --> 00:59:08,991
May I come in?

767
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:14,587
I'm sorry.

768
00:59:14,664 --> 00:59:16,928
It's some chocolate.

769
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,468
I'm not Forrest Gump, you know.

770
00:59:20,537 --> 00:59:23,597
Of course not. I didn't me–

771
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:27,473
- Was that a joke? Are you joking?
- Well, I can joke.

772
00:59:28,545 --> 00:59:30,809
I'm sorry.

773
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:33,372
I–

774
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:37,045
I took it out on you.
I'm just–just scared for my father.

775
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:47,325
You can apologize too, you know.

776
00:59:47,397 --> 00:59:49,991
Well, you said it was your fault.

777
00:59:51,868 --> 00:59:53,733
I got an interview.

778
00:59:53,804 --> 00:59:55,931
You did?

779
00:59:56,006 --> 00:59:58,975
Halloran Industries, research and engineering...

780
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:01,476
for space communication and exploration.

781
01:00:01,545 --> 01:00:04,070
Adam, that's– that's perfect!

782
01:00:04,147 --> 01:00:07,173
Break out the chocolate.
Let's go get some champagne.

783
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,480
Well, no, it's just an interview.

784
01:00:09,553 --> 01:00:14,183
There's a saying in my family:
It's never too early to drink the champagne.

785
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,291
You'd be good at this job, right?

786
01:00:25,368 --> 01:00:27,928
So all you gotta do is let 'em know it.

787
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:29,938
That's all? That's impossible.

788
01:00:30,006 --> 01:00:31,769
When is it?

789
01:00:31,842 --> 01:00:34,675
It– February 3– 17 days.

790
01:00:34,744 --> 01:00:36,735
Right. So that's how long you got.

791
01:00:36,813 --> 01:00:40,544
You gotta learn it during the day,
and then I'll help you at night.

792
01:00:40,617 --> 01:00:42,551
They'll think I'm a freak.

793
01:00:43,653 --> 01:00:47,054
Fine. Whatever you say.

794
01:00:47,124 --> 01:00:49,115
Beth?

795
01:00:50,393 --> 01:00:52,327
Beth?

796
01:00:56,733 --> 01:00:59,133
Come on.

797
01:01:00,937 --> 01:01:02,871
Whoa!

798
01:01:09,746 --> 01:01:11,737
<i>In most interview situations...</i>

799
01:01:11,815 --> 01:01:14,477
<i>the greeting is done in the standing position.</i>

800
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:17,987
<i>Simple greeting. "Hello. Nice to meet you."</i>

801
01:01:18,054 --> 01:01:20,921
<i>Basic greeting. "Hello. My name is Jason.</i>

802
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:23,391
<i>Nice to meet you."</i>

803
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,553
<i>Mr. Buchwald, how do you plead?</i>

804
01:01:25,629 --> 01:01:27,563
Not guilty, Your Honor.

805
01:01:27,631 --> 01:01:29,565
<i>Involved greeting.</i>

806
01:01:29,633 --> 01:01:33,034
<i>"Hello. You must be Ms. Austen.
My name is Jason. Nice to meet you."</i>

807
01:01:33,103 --> 01:01:35,094
<i>Mr. Raki?</i>

808
01:01:39,075 --> 01:01:41,009
I'm Elizabeth Buchwald.

809
01:01:41,077 --> 01:01:44,012
I'll be interviewing you
for the job we discussed over the phone.

810
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,913
- Phone?
- Nice to meet you?

811
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:48,974
Oh, right, right.

812
01:01:50,687 --> 01:01:53,212
Eyes. Please, step into my office.

813
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:55,224
<i>Make it a goal of your interview...</i>

814
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:58,921
<i>to mention each of your strengths at least once.</i>

815
01:01:58,995 --> 01:02:02,089
The items listed as assets
are really expenses...

816
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:05,566
<i>covered up in order to increase
the earnings statement of the company.</i>

817
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:13,809
<i>Eye contact.</i>

818
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:16,710
<i>One way to get around
the poor eye contact dilemma...</i>

819
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:20,477
<i>is to have the candidate look
at the interviewer's forehead.</i>

820
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:23,644
<i>Practice is needed, however,
because it will still require an effort...</i>

821
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,280
<i>to remember to look at a forehead.</i>

822
01:02:33,797 --> 01:02:35,731
- Beth?
- No!

823
01:02:35,799 --> 01:02:37,767
Just once more, please.

824
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:41,861
Adam, can't you think about anyone but yourself,
even for a minute?

825
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:44,806
- I'm sorry.
- No.

826
01:02:44,874 --> 01:02:49,334
Okay.

827
01:02:49,412 --> 01:02:53,280
Tell me something about
your previous work experience, Mr. Raki.

828
01:02:55,085 --> 01:02:59,385
<i>At your last job, how much of the work
did you perform independently?</i>

829
01:02:59,456 --> 01:03:01,447
<i>How much as a team?</i>

830
01:03:01,524 --> 01:03:04,584
Now, you've testified that your relationship
with the Cooper family...

831
01:03:04,661 --> 01:03:06,856
is personal as well as professional,
isn't that right?

832
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:11,424
Yes. Eric Cooper and I
have been associated for over 30 years.

833
01:03:11,501 --> 01:03:14,493
He's become a close friend.
But that doesn't mean–

834
01:03:14,571 --> 01:03:16,505
Would you tell the court a little...

835
01:03:16,573 --> 01:03:19,667
about your relationship
with Jennifer Cooper?

836
01:03:20,844 --> 01:03:23,335
She's a wonderful young woman.

837
01:03:23,413 --> 01:03:26,678
I've known her her– her whole life.

838
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:31,187
<i>Isn't it true that you'd be eager to help
Jennifer with any problem she was having?</i>

839
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:33,654
<i>- Yes.
- Out of your affection for the family, of course.</i>

840
01:03:33,723 --> 01:03:35,520
Sure.

841
01:03:35,592 --> 01:03:38,925
Now, Mr. Buchwald,
would you feel compelled to help Jennifer...

842
01:03:38,995 --> 01:03:40,986
to preserve your own reputation?

843
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:43,726
No.

844
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,792
Did you have an affair with Ms. Cooper in 2001?

845
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:50,306
<i>- Objection, Your Honor.
- Mr. Buchwald opened the door, Your Honor.</i>

846
01:03:50,373 --> 01:03:53,137
I understand the evidence, counselor.
Overruled.

847
01:03:53,209 --> 01:03:55,143
Please answer the question.

848
01:03:58,081 --> 01:04:00,140
Yes. Briefly.

849
01:04:00,216 --> 01:04:03,379
<i>So, Jennifer had every reason to believe...</i>

850
01:04:03,453 --> 01:04:05,978
<i>that you would help her with this problem.</i>

851
01:04:06,056 --> 01:04:07,990
That had noth–

852
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:15,757
The one had nothing to do with the other.

853
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,834
<i>Nothing.</i>

854
01:06:32,068 --> 01:06:34,298
<i>All rise.</i>

855
01:06:41,744 --> 01:06:43,735
<i>Be seated.</i>

856
01:06:50,053 --> 01:06:52,317
<i>Mr. Raki.</i>

857
01:06:52,388 --> 01:06:55,687
Hello. You must be Doug Breindel. I'm Adam Raki.

858
01:06:55,758 --> 01:06:57,749
- Pleased to meet you.
- Come in.

859
01:07:14,244 --> 01:07:18,146
<i>Six inches by Sunday morning
before this storm moves its way through-</i>

860
01:07:18,214 --> 01:07:20,444
<i>So it is a major storm.</i>

861
01:07:21,951 --> 01:07:24,579
- Beth?
- Adam, is Beth there?

862
01:07:24,654 --> 01:07:26,588
No, she isn't.

863
01:07:26,656 --> 01:07:29,784
Marty pled guilty.

864
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:31,793
There's some discretion in sentencing.

865
01:07:31,861 --> 01:07:33,795
The–The hearing is tomorrow.

866
01:07:33,863 --> 01:07:37,128
We may have to make statements,
but she isn't answering her cell.

867
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,191
I called the school,
but they– she wasn't there.

868
01:07:39,269 --> 01:07:41,260
Do you know when she'll be home?

869
01:07:41,337 --> 01:07:44,272
No. I thought– I was waiting for–

870
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:48,401
Adam, please. Can you check her calendars,
see if there's anywhere I can reach her?

871
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:50,412
Okay.

872
01:07:58,354 --> 01:08:00,584
Never mind. Marty's coming. I have to go.

873
01:08:00,657 --> 01:08:03,490
They're–They're keeping him overnight.
Tell her to call me.

874
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,585
Tell her to call me right away.

875
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:21,343
Adam!

876
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:24,437
I've been thinking about you all afternoon.
How did it go?

877
01:08:26,249 --> 01:08:29,548
I forgot my phone. How did the interview go?

878
01:08:35,892 --> 01:08:38,656
Okay, you're right.

879
01:08:38,728 --> 01:08:42,528
- Right?
- My father and I arranged for us to meet.

880
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,465
You arranged?

881
01:08:45,535 --> 01:08:47,526
I knew they were gonna be at the theater.

882
01:08:47,604 --> 01:08:49,538
They really wanted to meet you.

883
01:08:49,606 --> 01:08:52,507
Now, will you please tell me what happened?

884
01:08:54,344 --> 01:08:56,278
You lied?

885
01:08:57,447 --> 01:08:59,381
Just a little.

886
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,150
Ha-ha-ha! Fooled you!

887
01:09:06,222 --> 01:09:10,682
Dumb Adam!
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb!

888
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,024
<i>Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb Adam!</i>

889
01:09:13,096 --> 01:09:16,532
Adam, I didn't– I– I'm sorry. I–

890
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,565
- Adam, please just calm down.
- No, I hate you!

891
01:09:19,636 --> 01:09:22,503
- No!
- I hate you! I hope your father goes to jail forever.

892
01:09:22,572 --> 01:09:26,372
- I hate you!
- What?

893
01:09:26,442 --> 01:09:28,535
<i>He's guilty! Your mother called.</i>

894
01:09:28,611 --> 01:09:31,671
And he's a liar like you,
and he's going to jail. I hate you!

895
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:38,179
You're a child, Adam.
Fuck Asperger's. You're a fucking child.

896
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:47,729
Liar!

897
01:10:01,944 --> 01:10:05,004
A long time ago, when I told Grandpa Morris...

898
01:10:05,081 --> 01:10:07,049
that I wanted to get married...

899
01:10:07,116 --> 01:10:10,449
he said Marty was great...

900
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,784
but that he was an angles guy.

901
01:10:12,855 --> 01:10:14,846
What does that mean?

902
01:10:14,924 --> 01:10:19,361
That he was a guy who plays the angles...

903
01:10:19,429 --> 01:10:22,421
in business, love.

904
01:10:22,498 --> 01:10:25,228
He even said...

905
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:27,963
he might wind up in jail someday.

906
01:10:29,272 --> 01:10:32,173
And I told him he didn't understand Marty...

907
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:35,836
and that even if he ended up in jail for life...

908
01:10:35,912 --> 01:10:38,506
I would never regret marrying him.

909
01:10:40,349 --> 01:10:43,250
And I don't.

910
01:10:48,324 --> 01:10:50,315
We have to help him now, Beth.

911
01:10:52,295 --> 01:10:55,958
Tell the judge who your father is in your life...

912
01:10:56,966 --> 01:10:58,900
who he's always been.

913
01:11:00,103 --> 01:11:02,037
Whatever...

914
01:11:04,107 --> 01:11:06,667
bad decisions he's made.

915
01:11:13,683 --> 01:11:15,947
Okay.

916
01:11:16,018 --> 01:11:18,851
Okay, Mom.

917
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:47,077
<i>Now, I read that planets
are lined up across the sky...</i>

918
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:51,484
like they haven't been in 30,000 years.

919
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:53,488
Uh-huh.

920
01:11:55,758 --> 01:11:58,124
You didn't get the job you were going for?

921
01:11:58,194 --> 01:12:00,059
No.

922
01:12:00,129 --> 01:12:02,563
That why you so down?

923
01:12:02,632 --> 01:12:05,260
<i>- Hell, I've lost more jobs than-
- No.</i>

924
01:12:05,334 --> 01:12:09,293
- Beth and I broke up.
- Oh.

925
01:12:09,372 --> 01:12:12,068
She lied. She lied, and I found out about it.

926
01:12:12,141 --> 01:12:14,473
I can't trust her anymore.

927
01:12:21,551 --> 01:12:23,542
These all seem fine.

928
01:12:25,454 --> 01:12:28,480
Now, before I went into the service...

929
01:12:28,558 --> 01:12:31,857
I met a girl who made me a promise.

930
01:12:31,928 --> 01:12:36,331
When I came back,
she was right there waiting for me.

931
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:39,630
But I found out
she hadn't quite kept her promise...

932
01:12:39,702 --> 01:12:43,399
so I put some things in a bag and I left.

933
01:12:43,472 --> 01:12:46,236
Never spoke to her again.

934
01:12:46,309 --> 01:12:49,278
Though sometimes the wanting to was–

935
01:12:49,345 --> 01:12:53,839
was like a live animal
clawing at my chest from the inside.

936
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:56,680
<i>Thirty-five years.</i>

937
01:12:56,752 --> 01:13:00,313
She's the only picture in my head...

938
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:03,825
can still stop me in broad daylight...

939
01:13:03,893 --> 01:13:08,262
and make me curse myself
for a stubborn old fool.

940
01:13:11,534 --> 01:13:14,901
It's not rocket science.

941
01:13:14,971 --> 01:13:18,873
I'm saying you need to talk to the girl
one more time, that's all.

942
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:21,705
No. I don't know.

943
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:26,142
Liars is all you're
gonna run across in this world.

944
01:13:26,215 --> 01:13:30,379
A man has got to learn the difference
between just plain liars...

945
01:13:30,453 --> 01:13:33,422
and liars worth lovin'.

946
01:13:33,489 --> 01:13:35,423
Hmm?

947
01:13:39,829 --> 01:13:41,888
Harlan? If you called that girl...

948
01:13:41,964 --> 01:13:44,899
couldn't you stop cursing yourself
for a stubborn old fool...

949
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:47,128
even if you still had to be old?

950
01:13:57,146 --> 01:13:59,080
Be seated.

951
01:14:01,751 --> 01:14:04,811
<i>This court sentences you
to a prison term of five years...</i>

952
01:14:04,887 --> 01:14:08,152
<i>24 months to be served
in a federal corrections institute...</i>

953
01:14:08,224 --> 01:14:12,183
followed by three years of mandatory probation.

954
01:14:12,261 --> 01:14:16,027
<i>As per your plea agreement,
you'll have one week to settle your affairs.</i>

955
01:14:16,098 --> 01:14:18,566
<i>Report to the Corrections Department...</i>

956
01:14:18,634 --> 01:14:21,603
<i>Monday, February 9, at 9:00 a.m.</i>

957
01:14:22,638 --> 01:14:25,163
<i>Adjourned.</i>

958
01:14:31,514 --> 01:14:34,506
You have one new message.

959
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:36,710
Adam, this is Rebecca.

960
01:14:36,786 --> 01:14:40,449
Marty was sentenced
to two years in prison today.

961
01:14:40,523 --> 01:14:44,186
<i>Of course we're all very upset, but Beth-</i>

962
01:14:45,227 --> 01:14:47,195
<i>Anyway, we're going home to Westchester-</i>

963
01:14:47,263 --> 01:14:49,288
<i>211 Richmond Road, Bedford Hills.</i>

964
01:14:49,365 --> 01:14:52,857
<i>You have the number.
I- I thought you should know where she is.</i>

965
01:14:52,935 --> 01:14:55,927
For months, all they wanted was
for me to give them Eric Cooper.

966
01:14:58,074 --> 01:15:01,566
<i>"Do not go about as a talebearer
amongst your people."</i>

967
01:15:01,644 --> 01:15:03,908
At least I don't have to pack, right, Becky?

968
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,914
We always pack too much.

969
01:15:05,982 --> 01:15:08,678
This time, just the toothbrush.

970
01:15:11,921 --> 01:15:13,855
Excuse me.

971
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:18,455
Let's talk for a minute.

972
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:43,180
Ah, Bethy. Bethy.

973
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,814
Your mother's gonna need your help.

974
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:49,824
Yeah, I know.

975
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:56,765
<i>There are things you do,
there are things you have to do...</i>

976
01:15:56,832 --> 01:15:59,892
<i>and... you make your choices.</i>

977
01:15:59,969 --> 01:16:02,233
<i>You live with them.</i>

978
01:16:02,304 --> 01:16:07,207
You and your mother will never want
for anything. I've made arrangements.

979
01:16:07,276 --> 01:16:09,801
In two years I'll be back home...

980
01:16:09,879 --> 01:16:11,813
and this will all be over.

981
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:15,407
One more thing, about Adam?

982
01:16:19,021 --> 01:16:20,955
He's not for you.

983
01:16:22,758 --> 01:16:26,455
<i>It's not his fault,
but he's-he's more like your child...</i>

984
01:16:26,529 --> 01:16:29,498
<i>than- than anything else.</i>

985
01:16:29,565 --> 01:16:33,501
<i>He'll never be the kind of man
that you can admire, that you can look up to.</i>

986
01:16:33,569 --> 01:16:36,561
<i>And it's not fair that he should hope
for something that's- that's-</i>

987
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:39,233
<i>that's... impossible.</i>

988
01:16:41,577 --> 01:16:45,377
People with Asperger's get married.

989
01:16:45,448 --> 01:16:48,008
- They have families.
- Married?

990
01:16:49,919 --> 01:16:52,888
He lives in another world.

991
01:16:52,955 --> 01:16:55,947
You don't need to make
that kind of compromise, Beth.

992
01:16:58,327 --> 01:17:01,728
Um–You know this is the best thing.

993
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,391
You do know that, Bethany.

994
01:19:00,115 --> 01:19:03,846
Beth?

995
01:19:03,919 --> 01:19:06,979
Beth Buchwald!

996
01:19:07,056 --> 01:19:10,423
<i>Beth?</i>

997
01:19:10,492 --> 01:19:13,586
Beth Buchwald!

998
01:19:13,662 --> 01:19:15,596
<i>- Beth Buchwald?
- Oh, God.</i>

999
01:19:20,035 --> 01:19:22,162
I'll get him.

1000
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:24,433
Beth?

1001
01:19:24,506 --> 01:19:27,475
<i>- Adam!
- Be–</i>

1002
01:19:38,754 --> 01:19:40,745
We–we have to talk again.

1003
01:19:42,424 --> 01:19:45,154
You scared me.
I thought you were gonna hit me.

1004
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:48,622
No, I would never, ever do that.

1005
01:19:51,934 --> 01:19:54,596
The job was gone.

1006
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:57,070
They hired someone for the job...

1007
01:19:57,139 --> 01:20:00,302
but they have another one in an observatory.

1008
01:20:00,376 --> 01:20:03,470
They said I was just what they needed.

1009
01:20:03,545 --> 01:20:06,981
It starts in April,
but it's in Flintridge, California.

1010
01:20:07,049 --> 01:20:09,643
I want you to come with me.

1011
01:20:09,718 --> 01:20:11,948
I could work, and you could write...

1012
01:20:12,021 --> 01:20:14,922
<i>and you wouldn't have to teach anymore.</i>

1013
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:17,322
Hello, Mr. Buchwald. I came– Oh.

1014
01:20:17,393 --> 01:20:19,657
I'm sorry you have to go to prison.

1015
01:20:19,728 --> 01:20:22,356
I came to ask Beth to come to California with me.

1016
01:20:22,431 --> 01:20:25,832
I'd be engineering microchips
for satellite guidance systems.

1017
01:20:25,901 --> 01:20:28,631
I have a job in Flintridge, California.

1018
01:20:28,704 --> 01:20:31,195
That's fine. Congratulations, Adam.

1019
01:20:31,273 --> 01:20:34,504
- But Beth won't be able to go with you.
- What?

1020
01:20:34,576 --> 01:20:37,272
- The family needs her. She's needed here.
- I need her.

1021
01:20:37,346 --> 01:20:39,337
I can't go without her.

1022
01:20:39,415 --> 01:20:42,407
- Well, I'm sorry, Adam, but she can't go.
- No.

1023
01:20:42,484 --> 01:20:44,418
- You can't do that.
- Bethy. Bethy.

1024
01:20:44,486 --> 01:20:46,249
- You can't speak for me.
- We agreed.

1025
01:20:46,322 --> 01:20:47,983
- You don't make my decisions!
- We agreed!

1026
01:20:48,057 --> 01:20:50,287
- We're standing in the middle of the st–
- I don't care!

1027
01:20:50,359 --> 01:20:52,919
- Calm down. Calm down!
- Your own choices– Liar! Cheater!

1028
01:20:52,995 --> 01:20:55,555
Nothing will ever be the same! Nothing!
I'm going now.

1029
01:20:55,631 --> 01:20:58,657
- And I don't care what you think!
- Don't go! You can't!

1030
01:20:58,734 --> 01:21:01,862
- Let go. Let go of me.
- Get off of me!

1031
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:03,734
<i>- Adam!
- Oh! God!</i>

1032
01:21:05,307 --> 01:21:07,241
<i>Adam!</i>

1033
01:21:10,512 --> 01:21:13,003
- But you're coming to California?
- No!

1034
01:21:13,082 --> 01:21:15,710
- I mean, home, to the city!
- You're not coming to California?

1035
01:21:15,784 --> 01:21:18,184
- Maybe! I don't know! I'll think about it!
- Oh, okay.

1036
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:21,518
<i>Mom! I'm gonna take the car.
I'll leave it at the station.
- Beth!</i>

1037
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:24,115
Come back here!

1038
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:12,196
It didn't go well?

1039
01:22:18,614 --> 01:22:20,605
What did he say?

1040
01:22:20,682 --> 01:22:22,673
He wouldn't even see me.

1041
01:22:23,786 --> 01:22:27,722
I waited in the visiting room for an hour.

1042
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:31,817
And finally a guard came and told me
that he wasn't coming out.

1043
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:35,656
Your mother said he wasn't ready.

1044
01:22:35,731 --> 01:22:38,996
<i>I thought if I actually went.</i>

1045
01:22:39,067 --> 01:22:42,525
I didn't think that he wouldn't even see me.

1046
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:47,233
- What are you gonna do?
- What do you mean?

1047
01:22:48,977 --> 01:22:53,346
We're going, right? We're getting on a plane
tomorrow and going to California.

1048
01:22:55,818 --> 01:22:57,945
You should pack. You haven't packed at all.

1049
01:22:59,021 --> 01:23:02,149
Can you give me a minute? Okay?

1050
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:08,462
Just leave me alone for a while.

1051
01:23:43,432 --> 01:23:48,495
<i>I'm not sure.
I mean, I should be sure, shouldn't I?</i>

1052
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:50,561
Do you know what you want?

1053
01:23:52,074 --> 01:23:55,976
We'll never have a moment
where we look into each other's eyes...

1054
01:23:56,044 --> 01:23:59,241
and know exactly...

1055
01:23:59,314 --> 01:24:01,805
what the other person's feeling.

1056
01:24:03,652 --> 01:24:06,086
The idea of that wouldn't even make sense to him.

1057
01:24:06,154 --> 01:24:08,714
He's never told me that he loves me.

1058
01:24:12,694 --> 01:24:15,424
I don't know what it would mean to him if he did.

1059
01:24:18,166 --> 01:24:21,624
Yes. Feeling loved is very important...

1060
01:24:21,703 --> 01:24:23,898
but...

1061
01:24:23,972 --> 01:24:26,736
loving, my precious girl–

1062
01:24:28,644 --> 01:24:30,771
that's the necessity.

1063
01:24:36,018 --> 01:24:38,452
Mom, I gotta go.
I'll– I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1064
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,080
Okay?

1065
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:45,483
I love you, Beth.

1066
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:51,631
<i>Adam?</i>

1067
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:54,430
Why do you want me
to go to California with you?

1068
01:24:54,503 --> 01:24:57,995
What? What do you mean?

1069
01:24:58,073 --> 01:25:00,803
Why do you want me to go?

1070
01:25:02,477 --> 01:25:04,604
Um–

1071
01:25:10,018 --> 01:25:12,509
You, um–

1072
01:25:12,588 --> 01:25:15,785
You a-are...

1073
01:25:15,857 --> 01:25:19,315
like a part of me.

1074
01:25:24,466 --> 01:25:26,400
Um...

1075
01:25:29,705 --> 01:25:32,333
and, um...

1076
01:25:34,109 --> 01:25:38,068
I n– I need you...

1077
01:25:38,146 --> 01:25:40,341
uh, to–

1078
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:44,785
to, uh...

1079
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:47,754
help find a place to live...

1080
01:25:47,823 --> 01:25:50,986
and to learn how to get to work and...

1081
01:25:51,059 --> 01:25:54,119
to understand what it means
when people say crazy stuff...

1082
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:57,256
and, um...

1083
01:25:57,332 --> 01:25:59,664
I couldn't go without you.

1084
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:12,813
I'm sorry.

1085
01:26:16,084 --> 01:26:18,018
I can't go.

1086
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:26,249
If you want me to go because...

1087
01:26:26,328 --> 01:26:28,558
you can't go without me, I–

1088
01:26:31,433 --> 01:26:34,027
I can't go.

1089
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:24,535
- You sure about this?
- I have to go.

1090
01:28:24,613 --> 01:28:27,013
I have to go alone.

1091
01:28:27,082 --> 01:28:29,846
Give me that.

1092
01:28:32,921 --> 01:28:35,719
Hey, I want you to know...

1093
01:28:35,791 --> 01:28:37,782
I made that call.

1094
01:28:42,931 --> 01:28:45,832
It took me a while to find her...

1095
01:28:47,636 --> 01:28:49,866
but we're–we're gonna meet up.

1096
01:28:52,374 --> 01:28:55,866
- The woman's even more stubborn than I am.
- Oh, yeah?

1097
01:28:58,313 --> 01:29:01,180
I'm just trying to say "thank you," damn it.

1098
01:29:03,351 --> 01:29:05,376
You're welcome, Harlan.

1099
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:37,441
<i>Actually,
the best image resolution is achieved...</i>

1100
01:29:37,519 --> 01:29:41,182
<i>by multiple smaller telescopes
called interferometers.</i>

1101
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:44,054
<i>Interferometers combine light waves...</i>

1102
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,389
collected from the same source.

1103
01:29:46,461 --> 01:29:50,625
Um, a star, for instance, and the–
the waves form an interference pattern...

1104
01:29:50,699 --> 01:29:53,896
as they add together, or cancel out,
add together, cancel out.

1105
01:29:53,969 --> 01:29:56,904
It's what we call constructive interference,
or destructive interference...

1106
01:29:56,972 --> 01:29:59,202
so that the light from two or more telescopes...

1107
01:29:59,274 --> 01:30:03,870
can produce a brighter image
than one alone.

1108
01:30:03,945 --> 01:30:05,879
Um–

1109
01:30:08,116 --> 01:30:13,748
But sometimes it's best
just to look up at the night sky.

1110
01:30:15,891 --> 01:30:18,655
Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Raki.

1111
01:30:18,727 --> 01:30:20,820
All right. We'll be heading out.

1112
01:30:20,896 --> 01:30:22,830
Watch your step.

1113
01:30:24,299 --> 01:30:27,291
Adam. The top one's for you.

1114
01:30:27,369 --> 01:30:29,303
Um–

1115
01:30:35,243 --> 01:30:37,507
Oh, Carol?

1116
01:30:37,579 --> 01:30:41,515
Um, would you like me to help you with those?

1117
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:43,517
Yeah.

1118
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:47,085
<i>Thank you.</i>

1119
01:30:55,664 --> 01:30:58,030
- Hey, man.
- Hello, Brian.

1120
01:30:58,099 --> 01:31:00,693
Oh, you still meeting up with everyone later?

1121
01:31:00,769 --> 01:31:02,703
Awesome.

1122
01:31:31,967 --> 01:31:35,334
<i>Dear Adam: Look how far we've come.</i>

1123
01:31:35,403 --> 01:31:37,337
<i>Love, Beth.</i>

1124
01:31:51,853 --> 01:31:54,321
<i>Adam, his mother and his father...</i>

1125
01:31:54,389 --> 01:31:56,380
<i>were a family of talking raccoons...</i>

1126
01:31:56,458 --> 01:31:59,586
<i>who lived in Central Park
in the middle of New York City.</i>

1127
01:31:59,661 --> 01:32:03,097
<i>They didn't really belong there,
but there they were.</i>
