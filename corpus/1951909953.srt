1
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,385
So that's, you know,
coming along.

2
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,487
I'm working with a vocal coach.

3
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,090
Strengthening the...

4
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:31,097
Lot of guys ignore the laugh
and that's about standards.

5
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:34,767
I mean.... If you want to get
into the evil league of evil,

6
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,302
you have to have a memorable laugh.

7
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,372
What? Did you think Bad Horse
didn't work on his weenie?

8
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,476
His terrible death weenie.

9
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,981
No response BTW from
the league yet.

10
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,684
But my application
is strong this year.

11
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,887
A letter of condamnation
from the deputy mayor.

12
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,457
That's gotta have
some weight so...

13
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,092
Fingers crossed!

14
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,095
E-mails!

15
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,169
Too-sly-for-you writes "hey,
genius!"

16
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,873
Whoa!
Sarcasm, that's original!

17
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,278
"Where are the gold bars you
were supposed to pull out

18
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,881
of that bank vault with
your transmatter ray?"

19
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,285
"Obviously it failed or it
would be in the papers."

20
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:29,188
Well, no, they're not gonna say
anything in the press but...

21
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,790
behold!

22
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,696
Transported from
there to here!

23
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:43,269
The molecules tend to
shift during the...

24
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,873
transmatter.... uh... events.

25
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:52,478
But they were
transported in bar form.

26
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,181
And they clearly were...

27
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,483
And by the way it's
not about making money,

28
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,185
it's about taking money.

29
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,588
Destroying the status quo

30
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,592
because the status is not quo.

31
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,195
The world is a mess
and I just...

32
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,363
need to rule it.

33
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,966
I'm gonna...

34
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,267
Smells like cuman.

35
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,773
So transmatter is 75%.

36
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:23,776
And more importantly the
freeze ray is almost up.

37
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,178
This is the one.

38
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,280
stops time.

39
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,782
Freeze ray. Tell your friends.

40
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:39,592
We have... Oh, here's one from
our good friend Johnny Snow.

41
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:46,098
"Dr. Horrible, I see you are once again
afraid to do battle with your nemesis.

42
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,970
I waited at Dully Park for
45 minutes." Okay, dude.

43
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,773
You're not ... my nemesis.

44
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,176
My nemesis...

45
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,778
... is Captain Hammer

46
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,582
Captain Hammer corporate tool.

47
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,385
He dislocated my shoulder.

48
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,789
Again. Last week.

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,192
Look, I'm just trying to
change the world, okay?

50
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,897
I don't have time for a grudge
match with every poser in a parka'.

51
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,601
Besides there's kids
in that park so...

52
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:27,073
Here's one
from dead-not-sleeping.

53
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:31,578
Long time watcher, first time writing.
Blah blah blah blah.

54
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,280
"You always say in your blog
that you will show her the way,

55
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,983
show her you're a true villain.
Who is her?

56
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:43,289
And does she even
know that you're...

57
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,067
Laundry day... See you there.

58
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,270
Under things... tumbelling.

59
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,875
Wanna say... "Love your hair"

60
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,078
Here I go... mumbling.

61
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:09,081
With my freeze
ray I will stop...

62
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,183
the world.

63
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:17,990
With my freeze ray I will find
the time to find the words to...

64
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,193
tell you how...

65
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,295
how you make... make me feel.

66
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,198
What's the phrase?

67
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,999
Like a fool.

68
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,568
Kinda sick.

69
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:29,969
Special needs.

70
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:35,674
Anyways... with my freeze
ray I will stop...

71
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,376
the pain.

72
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:44,583
It's not a death ray or an ice beam,
that's old Johnny Snow.

73
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,887
I just think that
you need time to know

74
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,190
that I'm the guy
to make it real.

75
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,594
The feelings you
don't dare to feel.

76
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,797
I'll bend the
world to our will.

77
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:04,870
And we'll make
time stand still.

78
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,680
That's the plan.

79
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,381
Rule the world.

80
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,785
You and me. Any day.

81
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,886
- Love your hair.
- What ?

82
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,389
No, I love the air.

83
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,094
Anyway, with my freeze
ray I will stop...

84
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,599
- Hey, doc.
- Moist, my heroe.

85
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,968
Moisture, buddy,
what's going on?

86
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,170
Life of crime. Got your mail.

87
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,377
Hey, didn't you go on
a date last night?

88
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,479
Conflict Diamond told me you were
doubling with Bait And Switch.

89
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,081
Yeah.

90
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:50,984
Yeah?

91
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:54,787
It was alright. I kinda thought I was
supposed to end up with Bait but...

92
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:55,788
I hear you.

93
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,791
I saw Penny today.

94
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,493
You talked to her?

95
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:01,293
So close.

96
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:07,399
Just a few weeks from a
real audible connection.

97
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,369
I'm gonna ask...

98
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,073
Oh my God!

99
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,274
Is that from the league?

100
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,376
It's from him,
that's his seal, isn't it?

101
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,779
The leader? Oh my God!

102
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,981
I got a letter from Bad Horse!

103
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,584
That's so hardcore.
Bad Horse is legend,

104
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,086
he rules the league with an iron hoof.
Are you sure you want.......

105
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,789
Bad Horse! Bad Horse! Bad Horse! Bad Horse!

106
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,190
He rides across the nation

107
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,792
the thorough bread of sin.

108
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,995
He got the application
that you just sent in.

109
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:39,265
It needs evaluation so
let the games begin.

110
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,666
A heinous crime to
show of course.

111
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,468
A murder would be
nice of course.

112
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,471
Bad Horse! Bad Horse! Bad Horse!

113
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,472
...he's bad!

114
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,874
The evil league of evil
is watching so beware!

115
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,776
The grade that you receive
will be your last, we swear.

116
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,580
so make the Bad Horse prideful
or he'll make you his mare.

117
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,082
You saddled up,
there's no recourse.

118
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,684
It high ho silver,
side that horse.

119
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,188
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding?

120
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,390
This is great!

121
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,292
I'm about to pull
a major heist!

122
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:09,062
You know, the Wonderflonium that
I need for the freeze ray?

123
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,496
It's being
transported tomorrow!

124
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:11,798
Armored car?

125
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,367
Courrier van. Candy for a baby.

126
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:18,471
Do you need anything
dampened or made soggy?

127
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:22,075
Thanks but...
the league is watching.

128
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,778
I gotta do this alone.

129
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,588
Will you lend a caring hand

130
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,692
to shelter those who need it?

131
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,194
You only have to
sign your name.

132
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,398
Don't even have to read it.

133
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,369
Would you help...
No? How about you?

134
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,683
- Will you lend a caring hand...
- Ah!

135
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:41,788
What?

136
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,790
I was wondering if
I could just...

137
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,493
Hey!

138
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,295
I know you.

139
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:50,997
Hello. You know me. Cool!

140
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,667
I mean...
yeah, you do. Do you?

141
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:55,968
From the laundromat.

142
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,271
Wednesdays and Saturdays except twice
last month you skipped a weekend.

143
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,174
Or... if that was you.
Could have been someone else.

144
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,876
I mean, I've seen you.

145
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,878
Billy is my name.

146
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,480
I'm Penny.

147
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,683
What are you doing?

148
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,385
Hmmm... texting.

149
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,487
very important
or I would stop.

150
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,888
What are you doing?

151
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,892
Actually, I'm out here volunteering
for the Caring Hands homeless shelter.

152
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,094
Can you spare a minute?

153
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,098
Hum...

154
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,500
Okay, go.

155
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,971
We're hoping to open a new
location soon. Expand our efforts.

156
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,573
There's this great
building nearby

157
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,676
that the city is just gonna demolish
and turn into a parking lot.

158
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,778
- But if we get enough signatures...
- Signatures?

159
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,981
Yeah.

160
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,083
I'm sorry. Go on.

161
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,385
I was saying...

162
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,587
Maybe we could get the city to
donate the building to our cause.

163
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,090
We would be able to
pry 250 new beds,

164
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,794
get people off the streets and
into job training so they could

165
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:59,098
buy rocket packs and go to
the Moon and become florists.

166
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,601
You're not really interested
in the homeless, are you?

167
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,572
No, I am.
But they're a symptom.

168
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,874
You're treating a symptom
and the disease rages on,

169
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:12,578
consumes the human race.
The fish rots from the head as they say.

170
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,680
So my thinking is why
not cut off the head.

171
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,082
Of the human race?

172
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,587
It's not a perfect metaphor

173
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,489
but I'm talking about an
overhaul of the system.

174
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,094
Putting the power
in different hands.

175
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,296
I'm all for that!

176
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,567
- This petition is about the building.
- I'd love to sign it.

177
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:35,868
Thank you!

178
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,175
Sorry, I come on strong.

179
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,576
But you signed!

180
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:47,881
I don't wanna turn my back on
a fellow laundering person.

181
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,583
Well, if we can't stick together,
I don't...

182
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,889
I'll probably see you there.

183
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,493
No, I will. I...

184
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,669
She talked to me.

185
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,774
Why did she talk to me now?

186
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,478
Maybe I should...

187
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:27,286
A man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.

188
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:34,894
Don't plan the plan if
you can't follow through.

189
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:41,868
All that matters is taking
matters into your own hands.

190
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:45,572
Soon I'll control everything.

191
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,173
Hey! Hey !

192
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,976
My wish is your command!

193
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,778
Stand back everyone!
Nothing here to see!

194
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,282
Just imminent danger and
in the middle of it: me!

195
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,886
Captain Hammer's here!
Hair bowing in the breeze!

196
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:03,489
The day needs my
saving expertise!

197
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:09,996
A man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.

198
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:17,670
'seems destiny ends
with me saving you.

199
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:24,777
The only doom that's glooming
is you loving me to tears.

200
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:29,982
I'll give you a sec.
to catch your breath.

201
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,688
You idiot!

202
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,091
Dr. Horrible, I should have
known you were behind this!

203
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,293
- You almost killed her!
- I remember it differently.

204
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,293
If she...

205
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,596
It's curtains for you,
Dr. Horrible.

206
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,399
Lacey gently wafting curtains.

207
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:51,571
Thank you, Hammer man,
I don't think I can

208
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,274
explain how important it was
that you stopped the van.

209
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:59,178
I'd be splattered,
I'd be crushed in the debris.

210
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,582
Thank you, sir, for saving me!

211
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:03,582
Don't worry about it!

212
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,987
A man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.

213
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:11,191
- You came from above.
- Are you kidding?

214
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:15,395
- 'seems destiny ends with me saving you
- What heist were you watching ?

215
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,398
Stop looking at her like that.

216
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,666
when... you're the best you can...

217
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,169
Did you notice that he
threw you in the garbage?

218
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,373
- My heart is beating...
- When ass needs kicking,

219
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,576
- some ticking bombs to defuse...
- I stopped the van!

220
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:34,680
- The remote control was in my hand!
- ... only doom that's glooming...

221
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,984
- ...is you/me loving me/you to tears.
-Whatever!

222
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:44,490
So please give me a sec.
to catch my breath.

223
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:47,494
Balls!

224
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:09,475
Any dope with half a brain

225
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:13,279
can see the human
kind has gone insane

226
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,683
to the point where I don't know
if I'll upset the status quo

227
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:21,087
if I throw poison
in the water main.

228
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:25,391
Listen close to
everybody's heart

229
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:29,094
and hear that breaking sound.

230
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:32,698
Hopes and dreams
are shattering apart

231
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,469
and crashing to the ground.

232
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:40,173
I can not believe my eyes

233
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:43,976
how the world is filled
with filth and lies.

234
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:50,283
But it's plain to see
evil inside of me...

235
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:57,590
is on the rise.

236
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:01,994
Look around

237
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:05,697
we're living with
the lost and found.

238
00:15:05,798 --> 00:15:09,468
Just when you feel
you've almost drown,

239
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:13,072
you find yourself
on solid ground.

240
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:17,777
And you believe there's
good in everybody's heart.

241
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:21,580
Keep it safe and sound.

242
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:25,284
With hope you can do your part

243
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:29,087
to turn a life around.

244
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:32,591
I can not believe my eyes.

245
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:36,395
Is the world finally
growing wise?

246
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:39,499
'Cause it seems to me

247
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:42,868
some kind of harmony

248
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:48,374
is on the rise.

249
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:54,580
P- Make it slow.
Dr- Any one with half a brain

250
00:15:54,614 --> 00:15:58,084
P- He looks at me and seems to know
Dr- Can stand you're fool like howling in pain

251
00:15:58,284 --> 00:16:01,987
P- the things that I'm afraid to show
Dr- as the dark is everywhere, and any..

252
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:05,591
P- and suddenly I feel this glow.
Dr- doesn't see that can not see
     and the dark is all that will remain...

253
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:10,496
P- And I believe there's good in everybody's heart.
Dr-               ......Listen close to everybody's heart.

254
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:14,399
P- And keep that safe and sound.
Dr- And hear that breaking sound

255
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:17,970
 P- With hope you can do your part
Dr- Hopes and dreams are shattering apart

256
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:21,574
P- and turn...  a life...   around.
Dr- and crashing to the ground.

257
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:25,177
I can not believe my eyes.

258
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,081
P- how the world is finally growing wise.
Dr- how the world is filled with filth and lies.

259
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:32,385
But it's plain to see

260
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:35,588
P- rapture inside of me
Dr- evil inside of me

261
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:41,994
is on the rise.

262
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:51,670
It is so dumb that we're been coming
here so long and never spoke.

263
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:55,574
I know, all those months doing
this stunningly boring choir.

264
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:58,176
I'm a fan of laundering.

265
00:16:58,378 --> 00:17:00,079
I love it!

266
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:01,880
To smell the fabric softener...

267
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:03,882
the warm clothes
in your hands...

268
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,084
So good!

269
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:06,786
Hey, this is weird.

270
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:10,289
I ordered one frozen yogurt
and they gave me two.

271
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,391
You don't happen to like frozen yogurt,
do you?

272
00:17:12,492 --> 00:17:13,493
I love it!

273
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,695
You're kidding!
What a crazy random happenstance.

274
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:17,396
- Here.
- Thank you.

275
00:17:24,604 --> 00:17:26,272
So how was your weekend?

276
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:29,475
Did you spend the whole time
hunting wild signatures?

277
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:32,678
Actually, I went on a date.

278
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,382
Get right out of town.
How was that?

279
00:17:36,783 --> 00:17:38,384
Unexpected.

280
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,387
He's a really
good-looking guy and

281
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:43,288
I thought he was
kinda cheesy at first.

282
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:44,490
Trust your instinct.

283
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,291
But he turned out to
be totally sweet.

284
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,695
Sometimes people are
layered like that.

285
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:51,797
There's something totally
different underneath

286
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:53,899
than what's on the surface.

287
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,169
And sometimes there's
a 3rd even deeper level

288
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,372
and that one is the same
as the top surface one.

289
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:04,276
- Huh ?
- Like with pie.

290
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:06,579
So are you gonna
see him again?

291
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,681
I think I will.

292
00:18:11,684 --> 00:18:12,985
- Billy?
- Yeah.

293
00:18:13,186 --> 00:18:14,887
You're driving this
spork in your leg.

294
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:18,791
So I am. Hilarious!

295
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:26,999
Alright, the wait is over.

296
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,569
This, my friends,
is my freeze ray

297
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:32,671
which with the addition of
the Wonderflonium I obtained

298
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:35,374
at my famously successful
heist last week.

299
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:38,577
I say successful in that
I achieved my objective.

300
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:40,379
It was less successful in that

301
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,983
I inadvertantly introduced my
archnemesis to the girl of my dreams.

302
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:45,984
And now he's taking
her out on dates

303
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:49,488
and they're probably going
to french kiss or something.

304
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,493
She called him "sweet".
How is he "sweet"?

305
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:58,297
Right! Freeze ray !

306
00:18:58,698 --> 00:19:03,469
So, as of tonight,
I am in the evil league of evil

307
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:06,272
if all goes according to plan,
which it will,

308
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:09,775
because I hold a PhD
in horribleness.

309
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:12,178
See you at the aftermath.
Peace!

310
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:14,780
But not literally.

311
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:20,887
Well... the freeze
ray needs work.

312
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:25,091
I also need to be a little bit more
careful about what I say on this blog.

313
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:29,595
Apparently the LAPD and Captain
Hammer are among our viewers.

314
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:33,599
They were waiting for me
at the Mayor's dedication

315
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,169
of the Superhero
Memorial Bridge.

316
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:40,372
The freeze ray takes a few
seconds to warm up and I wasn't...

317
00:19:41,874 --> 00:19:44,877
Captain Hammer threw
a car at my head.

318
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:48,981
Not to worry though
because I'm...

319
00:19:49,182 --> 00:19:50,683
One sec.

320
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:53,986
He saw the operation
you tried to pull today.

321
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:56,789
But your humiliation means
he still votes nay.

322
00:19:56,989 --> 00:20:00,692
And now assassination
is just the only way.

323
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:02,494
There will be blood,
it might be yours

324
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:04,797
so go kill someone.
Signed Bad Horse.

325
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:08,300
Kill someone?

326
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:09,668
Would you do it?

327
00:20:09,902 --> 00:20:11,570
To get into the evil
league of evil?

328
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:13,772
Look at me, man! I'm moist!

329
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:17,476
At my most badass, I make people feel
like they want to take a shower.

330
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,278
I'm not ELE material.

331
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:22,982
Killing is not elegant or creative.
It's not my style.

332
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:26,985
You got more than enough evil hours
to get into the henchman's union.

333
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,587
I'm not a henchman.

334
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:30,589
I'm Dr. Horrible.

335
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,592
I've got a PhD in horribleness.

336
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,395
Is that the new catchphrase?

337
00:20:36,596 --> 00:20:39,098
I deserve to get in.
You know I do.

338
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,200
But killing? Really?

339
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,370
Hourglass says she knows a kid in Iowa
who grows up to become president.

340
00:20:45,605 --> 00:20:47,373
That'd be big.

341
00:20:47,473 --> 00:20:49,975
I'm not gonna kill
a little kid.

342
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:52,678
- Smother an old lady?
- Do I even know you?

343
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:54,680
I just, you know,
really think I'm...

344
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:57,083
qualified for this job.

345
00:20:57,183 --> 00:20:59,385
And... I just can't get
my foot in the door.

346
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:00,786
I'm sure you will.

347
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:02,688
I wanna do great things,
you know.

348
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:06,392
I wanna be an achiever
like Bad Horse.

349
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:08,494
The 3rd bread of sin?

350
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:11,898
I meant Ghandi.

351
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:16,969
Well, I've been turned
down from plenty of jobs.

352
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:18,671
Even fired a few times.

353
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:20,773
I can't imagine
anybody firing you.

354
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:22,475
Neither could I.

355
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:25,177
Now I can visualize
it really well.

356
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:29,982
- But you know everything happens...
- Don't say for a reason.

357
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:34,687
No, I'm just saying that...
everything happens.

358
00:21:34,787 --> 00:21:36,488
Not to me.

359
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:44,897
Here's the story of a girl
who grew up lost and lonely.

360
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:48,067
Thinking love was fairy tale

361
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:53,372
and trouble was
made only for me.

362
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,875
Even in the darkness

363
00:21:57,176 --> 00:22:01,380
every color can be found.

364
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:05,885
And everyday your
rain brings water

365
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:11,891
flowing to things
growing in the ground.

366
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:16,395
Grief replaced with pity

367
00:22:16,396 --> 00:22:19,899
for a city barely copping.

368
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:23,568
Dreams are easy to achieve

369
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:28,174
if hope is all
I'm hoping to be.

370
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:36,282
Anytime you hurt there's
one who has it worse around.

371
00:22:36,883 --> 00:22:42,088
And every drop of rain
will keep you growing,

372
00:22:42,288 --> 00:22:47,593
feeds your soul
within the ground.

373
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:51,297
So keep your head
up Billy buddy.

374
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,569
It's like Captain Hammer
is always saying.

375
00:22:56,803 --> 00:22:57,970
Right!

376
00:22:58,404 --> 00:23:01,473
How are things with
Cheesy on the outside?

377
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:03,175
Good. They're good.

378
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:04,577
He's nice.

379
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:07,280
I'll be interested to know
what you think of him.

380
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:08,781
He said he might stop by.

381
00:23:09,082 --> 00:23:11,184
- Stop by here?
- Yeah.

382
00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:15,087
Oh, goodness!
Look at my wrist! I gotta go!

383
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:17,489
But what about your clothes?

384
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:21,093
I don't want these. See you!

385
00:23:21,294 --> 00:23:23,095
- Oh, pardon.
- Pardon!

386
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:25,698
Billy, this is Captain Hammer.

387
00:23:25,898 --> 00:23:28,567
Oh, Billy, the laundry buddy.
It's very nice to meet you.

388
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:30,269
We're meeting now
for the first time.

389
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:31,871
You look horrobly familiar.

390
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:33,472
One of those faces I guess.

391
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:35,174
Have I seen you at the gym?

392
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:36,475
At the gym, yeah.

393
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:39,478
I don't go to the gym,
I'm just naturally like this.

394
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:40,980
Oh, well.

395
00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:44,884
Who wants to know what the Mayor
is doing behind closed doors?

396
00:23:45,184 --> 00:23:50,289
He is signing over a certain
building to a Caring Hands group

397
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:52,090
as a new homeless shelter.

398
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:53,792
- Oh my God!
- Yep!

399
00:23:53,993 --> 00:23:55,794
Apparently the only
signature he needed

400
00:23:55,995 --> 00:23:57,896
was my fist.

401
00:23:58,498 --> 00:24:00,199
But with a pen in it.

402
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,967
That I was signing with.

403
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:03,870
I can't believe it.

404
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:06,873
- Congratulations.
- Thank you! Thank you!

405
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:09,776
Oh!

406
00:24:11,177 --> 00:24:13,379
Well, this is great.
I wish I could stay and chitchat.

407
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,582
It sure was nice to meet you...

408
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:17,983
Doctor.

409
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:21,987
You've got a little crush,
don't you doc?

410
00:24:22,088 --> 00:24:24,290
Well, that's gonna make
this hard to hear.

411
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,593
See, later I'm gonna take
little Penny back to my place.

412
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:29,895
Show her the command center.

413
00:24:29,996 --> 00:24:32,698
The Hammer-cycle.
Maybe even the Ham-jet.

414
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,667
You think she likes me now?

415
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:38,771
I'm gonna give Penny
the night of her life.

416
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:41,274
Just because you want her.

417
00:24:41,674 --> 00:24:43,275
And I get

418
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:45,177
what you want.

419
00:24:45,678 --> 00:24:49,682
See, Penny's giving it up.
She's giving it up hard.

420
00:24:50,283 --> 00:24:51,984
'Cause she's with
Captain Hammer.

421
00:24:52,385 --> 00:24:53,586
And these...

422
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:56,088
are not the hammer.

423
00:25:02,295 --> 00:25:04,597
The hammer is my penis.

424
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:22,181
This appeared as a moral dilemma
'cause at first it was weird

425
00:25:22,215 --> 00:25:25,284
though I swore to eliminate the worst
of the plague that devoured humanity

426
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:28,287
it's true I was vague on the
how so can it be that you

427
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:30,889
have shown me the light.

428
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,593
It's a brand new day
and the sun is high.

429
00:25:34,694 --> 00:25:38,497
All the birds are singing
that you're gonna die.

430
00:25:38,698 --> 00:25:42,868
How I hesitated
now I wonder why.

431
00:25:42,902 --> 00:25:45,571
It's a brand new day.

432
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:49,575
All the time that you beat
me unconscious I forget.

433
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:51,577
All the crimes incomplete,
listen, honestly I'll live.

434
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:53,779
Mr. Coup. Mr. right. Mr.
Know-it-all is through.

435
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:56,382
Now the future's so bright
and I owe it all to you.

436
00:25:56,582 --> 00:25:58,784
You've shown me the light.

437
00:25:58,885 --> 00:26:02,688
It's a brand new me.
I've got no remorse.

438
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:06,492
Now the water's rising
but I know the course.

439
00:26:06,492 --> 00:26:10,796
I'm gonna shock the world,
I'm gonna show Bad Horse.

440
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:13,199
It's a brand new day.

441
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:16,669
And Penny will see the evil me.

442
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:20,873
Not a joke, not a dork,
not a failure.

443
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:24,477
And she may cry but
her tears will dry

444
00:26:24,677 --> 00:26:31,183
when I hand her the keys
to a shiny new Australia.

445
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:34,987
It's a brand new day.
Yeah, the sun is high.

446
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:38,591
All the angels sing
because you're gonna die.

447
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:44,696
Go ahead and laugh.
Yeah, I'm a funny guy.

448
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:48,967
Tell everyone goodbye !

449
00:26:51,004 --> 00:26:53,473
It's a brand new day.

450
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:06,212
Looks like we're finding
out what a true hero is.

451
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:10,350
The Mayor himself will be on hand to
dedicate the new homeless shelter

452
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:13,153
and unveil the statue
of Captain Hammer.

453
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:15,922
It's a good day to be homeless.

454
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,624
It certainly is.

455
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,603
So they say Captain
Hammer's become a crusader,

456
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
political, he's cleaning
off the streets.

457
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,167
About time.

458
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:39,080
So they say that
it's real love.

459
00:27:39,247 --> 00:27:40,781
So romantic.

460
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:42,950
He signed this.

461
00:27:43,151 --> 00:27:45,720
So they say we'll have
blankets and beds

462
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:49,290
we can open by Monday
thanks to you.

463
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:50,925
Thanks to me.

464
00:27:51,992 --> 00:27:55,128
It's the perfect story.

465
00:27:55,495 --> 00:27:58,731
- So they say.
- A heroe leading the way.

466
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:01,802
Hammer's call to glory.

467
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:04,170
Let's all be our best.

468
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:06,039
Next up : who's gay?!

469
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:10,278
So they say he saved her life.

470
00:28:10,812 --> 00:28:13,314
They say she works
with the homeless

471
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:17,718
and doesn't even meet.
We have a problem with her.

472
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,753
This is his hair.

473
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:22,657
This is so nice.

474
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:26,060
I just might sleep at
the same girl twice.

475
00:28:26,194 --> 00:28:28,429
They say it's better
the 2nd time.

476
00:28:28,563 --> 00:28:31,532
They say you get to
do the weird stuff.

477
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:34,334
We do the weird stuff.

478
00:28:35,102 --> 00:28:37,971
This is perfect for me.

479
00:28:38,538 --> 00:28:41,941
So they say.
I guess he's pretty okay.

480
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:44,644
After years of storm,

481
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:49,949
they say that I've
finally found the way.

482
00:28:54,554 --> 00:28:56,222
He's still not picking up.

483
00:28:56,556 --> 00:28:59,692
There's no happy ending.

484
00:28:59,993 --> 00:29:01,494
So they say.

485
00:29:01,661 --> 00:29:03,362
Not for me anyway.

486
00:29:03,597 --> 00:29:06,333
Shoud I stop pretending?

487
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,439
Take the chance to
build a brand new day?

488
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:15,243
This is his dry-cleaning bill

489
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,512
for his sweater vest.

490
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:22,682
And in just a few minutes,

491
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:26,285
we'll unveil the statue
of the man himself.

492
00:29:27,954 --> 00:29:29,055
Thank you.

493
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:30,690
Thank you.

494
00:29:30,992 --> 00:29:32,259
Justice has a name.

495
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:34,962
And the name that it has,
besides justice,

496
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,231
is Captain Hammer.

497
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:38,833
Ladies and gentlemen,

498
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:40,702
your heroe.

499
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:51,045
Thank you.

500
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:53,782
Thank you, Mayor,
for those kind words.

501
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,585
I hate the homeless.

502
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,321
This problem that
plagues our city.

503
00:30:01,156 --> 00:30:03,158
Everyone should
have the basic...

504
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:06,961
You know what?
I don't need tiny cue cards.

505
00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:10,464
When I fell deeply in love

506
00:30:10,665 --> 00:30:14,435
with my serious long-term girlfriend
Penny. Wave your hand, Penny.

507
00:30:16,237 --> 00:30:19,206
There she is. Cute, huh?

508
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,877
Sort of a quiet nerdy thing.
Not my usual but nice.

509
00:30:24,045 --> 00:30:25,112
Anyway...

510
00:30:25,814 --> 00:30:31,853
She turned me on to this whole
homeless thing which is terrible.

511
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,701
And I realised

512
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,136
I'm not the only hero
in the room tonight.

513
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:40,527
I'm not the only
one who's fighting.

514
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,069
It may not feel too classy

515
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,401
begging just to eat.

516
00:30:46,568 --> 00:30:49,037
You know who does that?
Lassie.

517
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,605
And she always gets a treat.

518
00:30:51,906 --> 00:30:54,208
So you wonder what your part is

519
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:56,512
'cause you're homeless
and depressed.

520
00:30:56,978 --> 00:30:59,413
But home is where the heart is.

521
00:30:59,547 --> 00:31:04,184
So your real home's
in your chest.

522
00:31:05,086 --> 00:31:09,690
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.

523
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:14,729
Everyone's got villains
they must face.

524
00:31:15,397 --> 00:31:17,399
They're not as cool as mine

525
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:22,903
but folks you know it's
fine to know your place.

526
00:31:23,204 --> 00:31:28,075
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.

527
00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:33,181
In their own not
that heroic way.

528
00:31:33,481 --> 00:31:35,783
So I thank my
girlfriend, Penny.

529
00:31:36,084 --> 00:31:38,252
Yeah, we totally had sex.

530
00:31:38,753 --> 00:31:41,055
She showed me there's so many

531
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:43,858
different muscles I can flex.

532
00:31:43,992 --> 00:31:46,461
There's the deltoids
of compassion.

533
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:49,063
There's the abs of being kind.

534
00:31:49,264 --> 00:31:51,733
It's not enough
to bash in heads

535
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:56,871
you've got to bash in minds.

536
00:31:57,105 --> 00:32:01,676
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.

537
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:07,181
Everyone's got
something they can do.

538
00:32:07,615 --> 00:32:09,750
Get up, go out and fly

539
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:14,622
especially that guy,
he smells like pooh.

540
00:32:15,457 --> 00:32:19,794
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.

541
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:24,599
You and you and
mostly me and you.

542
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,802
I'm poverty's new sheriff

543
00:32:28,303 --> 00:32:30,905
and I'm bashing in the slums.

544
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:41,515
A hero doesn't care if you're a
bunch of scary alcoholics bums.

545
00:32:41,683 --> 00:32:42,884
Everybody !

546
00:32:43,084 --> 00:32:47,254
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.

547
00:32:48,056 --> 00:32:52,393
Everyone can blaze
a hero's drill.

548
00:32:53,328 --> 00:32:55,430
Don't worry if it's hard.

549
00:32:55,697 --> 00:33:00,835
If you're not a frigging
'tard you will prevail.

550
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:06,107
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.

551
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:10,077
Everyone's a hero in their...

552
00:33:20,321 --> 00:33:21,522
Look at these people.

553
00:33:21,656 --> 00:33:25,760
Amazing how sheep will
show up for the slaughter.

554
00:33:26,394 --> 00:33:31,832
No one condemming you, lined up
like lemmings you led to the water.

555
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:34,936
Why can't they see what I see? 

556
00:33:35,136 --> 00:33:38,172
Why can't they hear the lies?

557
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:43,177
Maybe the fee's too pricy
for them to realize,

558
00:33:43,344 --> 00:33:46,580
your disguise is slipping.

559
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:49,784
I think you're slipping.

560
00:33:51,052 --> 00:33:53,821
Now that your saviour
is still as the grave

561
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:56,724
you're beginning to fear me

562
00:33:57,058 --> 00:33:59,760
like cavemen fear thunder
I still have to wonder

563
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:02,529
can you really hear me?

564
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:08,803
I bring you pain,
the kind you can't suffer quietly.

565
00:34:09,237 --> 00:34:10,738
Fire up your brain,

566
00:34:10,905 --> 00:34:17,711
remind you inside your
rioting society is slipping.

567
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:22,216
Everything's slipping
away so...

568
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,252
go ahead, run away,
say it was horrible,

569
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,256
spread the word, tell your friends,
tell 'em the tale,

570
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:31,159
get a picture, do a blog.
Heroes are over with.

571
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,028
Look at him! Not a word!
Hammer me nail.

572
00:34:34,295 --> 00:34:36,964
Then I win,
then I get everything I ever...

573
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:39,800
All the cash,
all the fame and social change.

574
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:43,771
Anarchy... that I run.
It's Dr. Horrible's turn.

575
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,941
You people all have to learn.

576
00:34:47,142 --> 00:34:49,711
This world is going to burn.

577
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:55,416
Burn ! Yeah, it's 2 "r".
H-O-R-R... Burn!

578
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:03,858
No sign of Penny. Good, I would
give anything not to have her see.

579
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:08,126
It's gonna be bloody.
Head up, Billy buddy.

580
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,368
There's no time for mercy.

581
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:15,169
Here goes no mercy.

582
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:23,344
That's not a good sound.

583
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:37,659
WAY!!!

584
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,461
A death ray!

585
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:43,297
Looks like Dr.
Horrible's moving up!

586
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,700
Let's see if this one works
any better than your others.

587
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,600
Don't!

588
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,640
I don't have time
for your warnings.

589
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,600
You give my regards
to Saint Peter

590
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:54,375
or whoever has his
job but in hell.

591
00:36:06,654 --> 00:36:08,489
Oh, I'm in pain!

592
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,692
I think this is what
pain feels like.

593
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,530
Oh, mamma!
Someone make it stop!

594
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:17,932
Get out of my way!

595
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:19,967
I gotta get out.

596
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,418
Penny! Penny!

597
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:39,220
Penny!

598
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:42,389
Billy?

599
00:36:43,558 --> 00:36:44,458
Is that you?

600
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:47,395
Penny, hold on. Oh no.
No, no, no, no!

601
00:36:47,695 --> 00:36:49,563
- Are you alright?
- Hold on.

602
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:52,032
It's okay. It's okay.

603
00:36:55,437 --> 00:36:58,373
Captain Hammer will save us.

604
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:04,478
Penny!

605
00:37:06,448 --> 00:37:07,682
Penny...

606
00:37:17,192 --> 00:37:18,393
Dr. Horrible!

607
00:37:18,626 --> 00:37:20,260
Why did you kill her?
Dr. Horrible!

608
00:37:29,604 --> 00:37:32,640
Here lies everything,

609
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:39,080
the world I wanted at my feet.

610
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:42,817
My victory's complete.

611
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:47,155
So hail to the king.

612
00:37:52,827 --> 00:37:57,565
Arise and see.

613
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:03,304
So your world's benine.

614
00:38:03,538 --> 00:38:09,076
So you think
justice has a voice

615
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:13,147
and we all have a choice.

616
00:38:13,815 --> 00:38:18,219
Now your world is mine.

617
00:38:23,124 --> 00:38:28,329
And I am fine.

618
00:38:47,082 --> 00:38:51,086
...in my heart and it hurts...

619
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:34,229
Now the nightmare's real.

620
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:40,167
Now Dr. Horrible is here.

621
00:39:40,335 --> 00:39:44,339
To make you quake with fear.

622
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:49,043
To make the whole world kneel.

623
00:39:54,115 --> 00:39:57,818
And I won't feel...

624
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,321
a thing.
