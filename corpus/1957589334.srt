188
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,100
-I am serious.

189
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,966
Don't start without me.

190
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:04,900
-OK.

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,633
-[praying]

192
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:14,066
-Wait!

193
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,466
-Cover your head.

194
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,033
MITCH (OFFSCREEN): Hi, hi.

195
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,066
Sorry, I'm late.

196
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,200
I got here as fast as I could.

197
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,133
Did I miss the Ganesha ceremony?

198
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:55,866
-Pretty.

199
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:58,266
-Cute.

200
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,333
-Is that how they do it in India?

201
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,700
-Sure.

202
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,566
OK, just like that dry and then wipe it off.

203
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,766
-Cool.

204
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,066
-Dyke?

205
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,466
-Total dyke.

206
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,000
-Total big old dyke.

207
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,400
-Big old dyke.

208
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,066
-Forget it.

209
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,933
She's straight.

210
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:28,666
-How?

211
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:30,200
-Socks, man.

212
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,833
No self-respecting dyke would be caught in socks that thin.

213
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:34,566
-Oh, great, it's Janis.

214
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:35,966
-Hey, my creds.

215
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,133
-Still scoping, uh, straight girls?

216
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:39,000
-Hey, check them out.

217
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,366
Knee-high tube socks.

218
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,100
-Hey!

219
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,666
-Lisa around?

220
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,133
-No, she's late.

221
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:49,566
-Damn, I was just by the restaurant.

222
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:53,866
When are you going to learn to ride that thing, anyway?

223
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:54,833
-Dyke.

224
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:56,766
-Total dyke.

225
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:58,733
-What did you call her?

226
00:11:58,833 --> 00:11:59,366
-Dyke.

227
00:11:59,466 --> 00:11:59,933
-Dyke.

228
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:01,533
-That's great.

229
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:05,600
Why don't you just appropriate the culture of our oppressors?

230
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,366
-Issue dyke.

231
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:08,833
-Issue dyke.

232
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:09,600
-Hey, Lisa.

233
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,300
-Hey.

234
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,166
Mamacita.

235
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:13,933
-Hey, guess what?

236
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:14,833
Reena's going to be an aunt.

237
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,533
-Hey, Sarita's pregnant?

238
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:17,066
-She's already pregnant?

239
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,200
-No, no, no.

240
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,100
They're trying to get pregnant.

241
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,500
-What "they"?

242
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,666
What is this all "they're" trying to get pregnant,

243
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:22,666
because it's-- excuse me?

244
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:23,700
Hello?

245
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,366
-It's gender-inclusive, Janis.

246
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,400
-Include this.

247
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,533
-Look, their sex life is over now.

248
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:29,566
I mean, from here on in.

249
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,700
It's all about procreate.

250
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,066
-Ew, please, not in front of the baby dyke.

251
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,033
-That's it.

252
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,566
I'm out of here.

253
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,500
-Now you upset her.

254
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,133
-I'm sorry.

255
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:39,100
-Let's go get some.

256
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,866
-Why is she so sensitive?

257
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:40,433
-What about me?

258
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:41,233
Hey?

259
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,766
Where we going for dinner?

260
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,766
-I told Reena.

261
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:46,533
-Yeah?

262
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,766
Let me guess.

263
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,400
She was only less than supportive, which only makes

264
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,066
sense, because she has jealousy issues concerning me

265
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,366
stealing away her sister.

266
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:54,700
-No.

267
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,366
She's happy for us.

268
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:58,633
-Happy.

269
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:00,266
-She said that?

270
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:01,966
-Yeah.

271
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,000
-Really?

272
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,766
-Mitch, don't be so surprised.

273
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:05,633
-I don't care.

274
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:06,600
-Hey.

275
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,566
-Hey.

276
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,533
-Sorry, I'm late.

277
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:09,500
-It's OK.

278
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,066
-Hi.

279
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,400
-How you doing?

280
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:11,933
-Good.

281
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:12,833
How are you?

282
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,533
-Eh, still not pregnant.

283
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:15,100
-Oh yeah?

284
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,266
-No, not yet.

285
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:17,433
-What's the matter, Mitch?

286
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,400
Shooting blanks?

287
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,933
-I know you don't mean to hurt me.

288
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,766
-How do you know?

289
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:25,133
-Because you have abandonment issues concerning your father.

290
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:26,800
And it's just a tough act to cover your fear.

291
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,700
And I want you to know that if you ever want to talk, I'm

292
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,600
here for you, OK?

293
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,366
-Yeah, OK.

294
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:33,533
-Hello, beta.

295
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:34,333
Hello.

296
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:34,766
Hi.

297
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:35,933
Hello.

298
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,166
This is for the house.

299
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:41,100
And this is for the baby.

300
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,766
Mom, there is no baby.

301
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,166
I'm going to go and change.

302
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:52,433
This looks like a reproduction from the Moghul School, but

303
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,233
it's been covered over in brass.

304
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,633
Yeah, Mom had it brassed over to protect it.

305
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:58,833
From what?

306
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,600
-What?

307
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,900
-Honey, we've always used it for that.

308
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,233
-This is such a comfortable house.

309
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:14,566
You know, slowly, all my dreams are coming true.

310
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,433
-Mom, one of my photos might be on a magazine cover this

311
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:18,066
month.

312
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,000
-Hey, that's great.

313
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,633
Mom, isn't that great?

314
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,900
-Mmm.

315
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,366
Reena, you're not even in those pictures.

316
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:25,933
How can anyone know that it's my daughter's picture?

317
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,533
Besides what kind of field is it anyway?

318
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:29,633
No stability.

319
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:31,533
Jumping from one place to another place.

320
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:34,600
-Well, I don't think stability is Reena's first priority.

321
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,633
-Mmm.

322
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:37,466
Sariya, I am so proud of you.

323
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:40,133
This is delicious.

324
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:43,466
Reena, do you remember the time when you

325
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:44,700
tried to make sabji?

326
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,566
And you set off all the smoke alarms in the house.

327
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,800
[laughter]

328
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,033
-I can cook.

329
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,466
-Cookie dough triangles don't count.

330
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,433
-I don't understand what the problem is.

331
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:01,233
I love cooking.

332
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,200
You're the one that never lets me cook.

333
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,766
-No, I love the way you cook.

334
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,766
You're a great cook.

335
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,366
-You being sarcastic?

336
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:10,066
No!

337
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:10,966
I'm not being sarcastic.

338
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:12,900
I think you're awesome.

339
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,300
Look at me.

340
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,200
I'm serious though.

341
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,633
No, I like the way you cook.

342
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:22,366
I'm just helping, you know?

343
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,366
That is good.

344
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,600
You're doing-- julienne it, julienne.

345
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,233
Who's Julie?

346
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,000
-So, how was your mom last night?

347
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,400
-My family's so weird.

348
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,400
-Oh, step up.

349
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,900
I mean, you're no weirder than anybody else.

350
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,466
If you want weirdness--

351
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:38,600
-I know.

352
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,433
I've been eating there before you were born.

353
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:40,266
-Janis.

354
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:41,400
The hair, the hair's the dyke.

355
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,600
-Oh!

356
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,733
Did Martha Stewart throw up in here or what?

357
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,633
-Nice apron.

358
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:49,766
-Look.

359
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,500
I don't need this right now, OK?

360
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,566
-Hey, hey.

361
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:53,466
Don't get all "Basic Instinct" on me now.

362
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,066
-Basic what?

363
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,200
-Forget it.

364
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,900
It's a classic before your time.

365
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,666
-Let's eat.

366
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:01,433
I'm starving.

367
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:02,633
-I cooked dinner.

368
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:03,600
I spent all day cooking.

369
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,833
And you're getting pizza?

370
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:06,866
-Yeah, it's your day for dinner, Reena.

371
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,100
-She's not a dyke.

372
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,833

-Listen to me.

00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:53,800
You put it in, and you leave it for 24 hours, before you

00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,233
take it out.

477
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,333

Sarita, you have a condition in which your body fails to

500
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:08,166
-Sarita, it's unlikely you'll be able to get pregnant.

501
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:11,800
And if you do, unfortunately, you would probably miscarry.

503
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,666
DR. GRANT (OFFSCREEN): Well, in this situation, we would

00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:24,466
pursue other options.

506
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:26,833
DR. GRANT (OFFSCREEN): This is not the

00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,100
-Did Janis deliver my prints?

558
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,600
-God, I wonder why she'd think that.

559
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,800
-What do you mean?

560
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:42,933
Well, you know, it's just that you can be a little selfish

561
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:44,933
when it comes to your work.

562
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:47,766
-I'm selfish?

563
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:49,166
-Sometimes.

564
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:56,100
-It never occurred to me that I couldn't have children.

565
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,733
-I want to help.

566
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,733
-There's nothing you can do.

567
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,266
-There is something I can do.

568
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:07,966
I can have the baby for you.

569
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:09,800
-[laughs]

570
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,033
You want to have my baby?

571
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:14,533
What about being gay?

572
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:16,966
-What does that have to do with it?

573
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,633
-You mean you would sleep with Mitch?

574
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:22,933
-No, I could not deal with sleeping with Mitch.

575
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:25,900
-OK, so somehow, you get pregnant,

576
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,300
and then what happens?

577
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,266
-And then I have a baby, and then I give it to you.

578
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:35,833
-Have you even thought about this?

579
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:37,233
-Yeah.

580
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,466
-Are you crazy?

581
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:42,733
-No.

582
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,933
-You want to get pregnant, carry a child for nine months,

583
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:46,833
and give it to your sister.

584
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:47,633
What are you thinking?

585
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,033
You are so weird

586
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:50,933
-Hey, you said I was no weirder than anyone else.

587
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:52,133
-OK, well, you win.

588
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,166
You're weirder.

589
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:55,533
Reena, you're not rent-a-womb.

590
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:56,966
-Lisa, she's my sister.

591
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:58,633
-Oh, right, so you owe her 13 chromosomes?

592
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,733
-Hey you were just yelling at me about being selfish.

593
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,166
-Well, yeah.

594
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:04,700
I mean like don't drink the last sip of soda in the

595
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,733
fridge, replace the ice trays once in awhile, not have a

596
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:08,933
baby for your sister.

597
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,033
-Lisa, you know what?

598
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:11,500
She might not even say yes, OK?

599
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:20,000
-Did you get to that exhibit?

600
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,200
-No, Reena came over.

601
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,800
We just did the usual gardening stuff.

602
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,266
-She didn't actually get off her ass and help you, did she?

603
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:28,033
Or did you have to do everything?

604
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:29,566
-No, it's typical Reena.

605
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,333
She disappears to the store for an hour.

606
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:34,466
And then she comes back with some crazy idea about being a

607
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:35,666
surrogate mother.

608
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:41,633
Can you believe her?

609
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,833
She thought she could help by, you know, having

610
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:46,233
the baby for us.

611
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,800
-Well, what do you think?

612
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,066
Was she serious?

613
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,733
-Well, what difference does it make?

614
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,066
What are you thinking?

615
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:07,366
-I don't know.

616
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:12,166
Um, I mean it would be part of both of us,

617
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,733
genetically, I mean.

618
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:15,700
-But--

619
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,466
are you serious?

620
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:20,900
-Heh, all right, well, let's look at the advantages.

621
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,533
A, it would look like both of us.

622
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:24,833
And honey, it would be a beautiful baby.

623
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:27,566
And B, I mean, we wouldn't have to wait around for the

624
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:28,500
adoption agency.

625
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,166
-Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, Mitch.

626
00:32:30,266 --> 00:32:32,333
Do you hear yourself?

627
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:35,333
You're talking about Reena.

628
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:37,366
My flaky sister who thinks she's an artist.

629
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:39,700
-Well, honey, she's not going to be the mother.

630
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
You're going to be the mother.

631
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,166
And come on, sweetie.

632
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:43,566
I mean, she's sort of talented.

633
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,300
-So how was your date last night?

634
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,966
-Who?

635
00:32:58,066 --> 00:32:59,566
-No-Agency Melissa.

636
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:02,333
She's emotionally unavailable right now.

637
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:05,166
Anyway, she reminds me too much of my mother.

638
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:06,800
-Your mom's a dyke?

639
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,100
-My mom's a dyke.

640
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,700
-Hey, my mom's a dyke too.

641
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
-Your mom is not a dyke.

642
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,166
-So?

643
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,600
-Hey, my mom got this new haircut, a bi-level.

644
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,566
And she has this favorite jacket she wears every day.

645
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:19,866
Members Only.

646
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:21,466
-Big old dyke.

647
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,433
Ook.

648
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:26,066
-See I told you my mom was a dyke.

649
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,766
Oh, hey, Sarita.

650
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:31,466
How's it going?

651
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:32,800
OK.

652
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,000
-Now, you guys are all wimps.

653
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,066
Why don't you get real tattoos already?

654
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:37,533
-Lisa's got permanency issues.

655
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:40,866
-I know what you mean.

656
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:43,000
-She's really good, huh?

657
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,500
-They're really nice.

658
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:49,566
Reena, that's not how you draw an ohm.

659
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:50,533
-It is too.

660
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:51,666
-No, it's not.

661
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:53,066
Let me wipe?

662
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:03,000
-She's kind of better than you.

663
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,566
-No, she just wasn't drawing it right.

664
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,700
Um, can we talk privately for a minute?

665
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,100
-Yeah.

666
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,033
-What you're offering is big.

667
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,600
-So we're going to do it?

668
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,000
-No, Reena.

669
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,666
You know, you know, Mom would never go for this.

670
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:20,066
-Yes, she would.

671
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,500
-It'd be so complicated.

672
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,900
And I don't think I could handle it.

673
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,800
-Sarita, this can work, I promise.

674
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:42,133
How do we even know you can get pregnant?

675
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:44,800
-Well, everything came back normal.

676
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,533
Reena, if you decide to get pregnant, I can't foresee any

677
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:49,000
complications.

678
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,000
-Yes!

679
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,866
-Great.

680
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,166
That's great.

681
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:56,199
Of course, my lesbian sister can have a baby.

682
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,566
Mitch will be so happy.

683
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:00,966
Yeah.

684
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,400
-Why do you want this so bad?

685
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,466
-Come on, Lisa.

686
00:35:04,566 --> 00:35:07,700
She's my sister.

687
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,566
Ooh, hey check it out, Lisa.

688
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:14,433
If you hold your head right, you can block out New Jersey.

689
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:18,600
-Lisa, she's my family.

690
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,800
OK?

691
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,366
-[sigh]

692
00:35:24,466 --> 00:35:27,766
I guess nine months isn't that long.

693
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:29,033
[knocking]

694
00:35:29,133 --> 00:35:29,733
MITCH (INSIDE RESTROOM): Uh [clears throat]

695
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:30,733
yeah, um.

696
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,000
-Great.

697
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,733
Um, just one more time.

698
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:42,233
Give the cup and this cooler to the nurse when you finish.

699
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:47,900
Don't worry.

700
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,300
Take your time.

701
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:56,566
-We're ready to get started.

702
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,100
Are you both OK?

703
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:05,900
-Mm-hmm.

704
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,866
-Good.

705
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,166
OK, Reena, you ready?

706
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:12,466
Just relax, and think nice thoughts.

707
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,266
-[sigh]

708
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:47,600
REENA (OFFSCREEN): [clears throat]

709
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,500
-You move into a neighborhood, and they build a Kmart down

710
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,200
the block.

711
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,433
-I never even go there.

712
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,533
-Oh, please, you go there all the time.

713
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:24,600
-Yeah, like that 24-pack of toilet paper

714
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,566
came from the deli.

715
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:26,900
It came out of your ass.

716
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,600
-That's really witty, Janis.

717
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,900
-What's the difference between Bengali and Indian food?

718
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,133
-Um, Bengali food's from Bangladesh.

719
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:33,233
Let's go in here.

720
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,566
Come on.

721
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:37,400
Come on, Janis.

722
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,133
-Hey, look, it looks just like Reena's apartment.

723
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:40,100
-Oh, lay off, man.

724
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,066
I just moved in.

725
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,466
-You'll want it, Becca.

726
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:45,133
-Hey, I thought you lesbians liked to cohabitate.

727
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:46,233
-Uh, excuse me.

728
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,533
What do you mean, "you lesbians"?

729
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:48,733
-Oh, I'm bisexual.

730
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:52,433
-Hello.

731
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:53,400
-Oh, please.

732
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,233
That whole bi-phobia thing's so '95.

733
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,733
-Yeah.

734
00:37:58,833 --> 00:37:59,366
-Yeah!

735
00:37:59,466 --> 00:38:00,433
-Yeah.

736
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,533
[kissing sounds]

737
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:08,466
-Eh.

738
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:09,866
I'm sorry.

739
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:13,000
Those clinics.

740
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,466
Masturbating so everyone knows what you're

741
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:18,366
doing is not great.

742
00:38:18,466 --> 00:38:20,700
-Hey, I'm not asking you to masturbate.

743
00:38:23,366 --> 00:38:26,266
-You know, it's embarrassing.

744
00:38:26,366 --> 00:38:29,266
I mean, all those women in the waiting room, and they know

745
00:38:29,366 --> 00:38:30,600
what you're there for.

746
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,233
They see your cup.

747
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,033
-Mitch.

748
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:36,500
You're being so self-absorbed.

749
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,766
-It's for the baby.

750
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:39,033
I have to conserve.

751
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:40,900
-So you'd rather save it for the magazines.

752
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,833
-No!

753
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:42,833
No.

754
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:43,666
I'm saving it for the baby.

755
00:38:43,766 --> 00:38:44,833
And--

756
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:46,233
and you know I don't use magazines.

757
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:48,100
You know how I feel about what they do to women.

758
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,400
-OK, it says here to pee directly onto the stick.

759
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,433
So--

760
00:38:54,533 --> 00:39:00,900
-Oh, I think maybe I should be the one peeing on it.

761
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,300
-I'll be outside.

762
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:08,366
-Ma-ji, we want to tell you something.

763
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,733
-Sariya's pregnant.

764
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:14,900
I knew it.

765
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,766
I knew it just by looking at her.

766
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:17,900
Mothers know.

767
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,400
It's like we have a fifth sense.

768
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,433
-See, Mitch?

769
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:22,400
She already knows.

770
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,700
It's like a fifth sense and all.

771
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,100
-Sarita.

772
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,800
-Well, tell me.

773
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,966
What happened?

774
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:33,300
-I can't go back to that hospital.

775
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,466
-You've always felt fertile.

776
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:39,533
-You call Reena, and you tell her to stop this nonsense!

777
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:44,666
Oh God, I had to live to see this day.

778
00:39:44,766 --> 00:39:47,666
It's not natural.

779
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:49,066
-Maybe we could do it at home.

780
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:53,066
-No.

781
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:56,966
No.

782
00:39:57,066 --> 00:39:58,366
-OK.

783
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:02,633
Want to try?

784
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,600
-Reena!

785
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,566
Thi--

786
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:05,000
-OK.

787
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,333
-No way!

788
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,933
-Do I have to touch it?

789
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:14,233
-I ain't touching it.

790
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:17,200
-I'm sure they could be a lot more precise at the hospital.

791
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,366
-I don't think precision is an issue here.

792
00:40:22,466 --> 00:40:25,333
There's only one place for it to go.

793
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:29,300
-Reena and Lisa aren't exactly health care professionals.

794
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,233
-[laughs]

795
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,666
-I'm ready.

796
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:42,066
-Hold on.

797
00:40:54,366 --> 00:40:56,066
-Just stop watching me, OK?

798
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:57,766
You're making me very nervous.

799
00:40:57,866 --> 00:40:58,900
-Oh, OK.

800
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,200
I'll just close my eyes and spread.

801
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,766
-Reena, just-- just work with me, OK?

802
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:02,600
I mean--

803
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,233
shit.

804
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:04,000
-Lisa!

805
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,800
-Just one second.

806
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,400
-OK.

807
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,766
-Um, so at the hospital, they had this thing called sterile.

808
00:41:11,866 --> 00:41:13,933
-Come on, sweetie.

809
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:17,166
All that female energy in one room?

810
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,700
It's got to be good for the baby.

811
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:26,300
-Is this turning you on?

812
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,100
-What?

813
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,933
-Gross, Mitch!

814
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:29,166
That's my sister.

815
00:41:29,266 --> 00:41:30,733
-Come on, sweetie.

816
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,266
-Yeah, get off me.

817
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:34,633
I mean it, get off me!

818
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:36,666
-OK, got it.

819
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:38,000
-Don't come near me.

820
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,100
-What, should I rub it off with some alcohol?

821
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,000
LISA (OFFSCREEN): What?

822
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,933
What's wrong?

823
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:46,700
Christ, forget it.

824
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,666
[laughs]

825
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:57,000
-So, uh, how is "it" going?

826
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,866
-Uh, why does Becca know something and I don't?

827
00:41:59,966 --> 00:42:01,400
-Because I happen to be in the loop.

828
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,800
You got a problem with that or what?

829
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,600
-I'm getting pregnant for Sarita.

830
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,566
-Pregnant?

831
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:08,433
You and Mitch?

832
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:09,533
-No.

833
00:42:09,633 --> 00:42:11,666
Reena and Mitch's sperm.

834
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:14,200
-Yeah, just be glad that Lisa didn't make turkey tonight.

835
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,433
You know what I mean?

836
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,233
-See, I get the sperm from Mitch.

837
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,366
And then we insert it.

838
00:42:18,466 --> 00:42:20,533
-Uh, Mitch inserts what exactly?

839
00:42:20,633 --> 00:42:22,000
-Lisa inserts it.

840
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,166
-I'm sorry, Lisa.

841
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:26,966
-People do this all the time.

842
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:28,300
JANIS (OFFSCREEN): Not to Reena.

843
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,666
-Yeah, picture Reena with an ovulation kit.

844
00:42:30,766 --> 00:42:31,266
-Yeah!

845
00:42:31,366 --> 00:42:32,566
Reena.

846
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:34,533
You're just being used to perpetuate the heterosexual

847
00:42:34,633 --> 00:42:35,566
family model.

848
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:36,700
-Yeah.

849
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,566
Your body is a battlefield for birth control.

850
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:41,266
-Good, honey.

851
00:42:41,366 --> 00:42:43,533
-Guys, after she has the baby, all of our lives

852
00:42:43,633 --> 00:42:45,066
will go back to normal.

853
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:48,233
Uh, dessert anyone?

854
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,100
-Is she all right with all of this?

855
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,133
[pots clattering]

856
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:51,966
LISA (OFFSCREEN): God damn it.

857
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:52,733
Fuck!

858
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:53,833
-She'll be fine.

859
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,200
LISA (OFFSCREEN): Fuck!

860
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,100
-Reena, pick up some haldi.

861
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,333
-The yellow one?

862
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:11,733
-Yes, the yellow one is haldi.

863
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,933
Can you get some rice please.

864
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:23,333
A b- bag.

865
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,266
-Hey, mom.

866
00:43:32,366 --> 00:43:33,000
Look.

867
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,000
-What is this nonsense?

868
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,166
-Uh, come on, Mom.

869
00:43:36,266 --> 00:43:37,066
Aren't you even a little excited?

870
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:39,000
-This is not your baby.

871
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,266
This baby belongs to Sariya and Mitch.

872
00:43:41,366 --> 00:43:42,833
You shouldn't even talk about a baby

873
00:43:42,933 --> 00:43:44,233
until you have a husband.

874
00:43:51,966 --> 00:43:52,600
-[exhales]

875
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,633
Are you OK?

876
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:57,466
-Yeah.

877
00:43:57,566 --> 00:43:59,933
-Did it all go in?

878
00:44:00,033 --> 00:44:02,966
-I don't know.

879
00:44:03,066 --> 00:44:05,666
-Well, can't you feel it?

880
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:07,733
-Not really.

881
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:09,100
-Should I?

882
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,500
-I don't know.

883
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,333
-Honey?

884
00:44:19,433 --> 00:44:20,300
Honey?

885
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,866
-Hmm?

886
00:44:22,966 --> 00:44:31,333
-I read that, um, I read that if I have an orgasm, then, um,

887
00:44:31,433 --> 00:44:33,333
it would increase our chances.

888
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,000
-Uh, Reena, I can't--

889
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,466
-Well--

890
00:44:42,566 --> 00:44:45,233
just please?

891
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,833
-Reena, that stuff really smells.

892
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:50,033
-You could just try.

893
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:51,133
-Babe, I don't know how to do it.

894
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:52,833
I'm not going to try.

895
00:44:52,933 --> 00:44:54,466
-Come on.

896
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,900
You don't have to go down there.

897
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,300
Just try.

898
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:20,633
Honey?

899
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:21,600
-Yeah.

900
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,433
-Li.

901
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:23,433
-Yeah?

902
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:25,333
-This--

903
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:28,333
this isn't happening for me.

904
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:30,700
-Good, because it ain't happening for me either.

905
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,300
Phew.

906
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,833
God.

907
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:33,700
-I'm going to make a sandwich.

908
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Want a sandwich?

909
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,066
[phone ringing]

910
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:40,100
-Just let the ma get it.

911
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,200
-Yeah, we're here.

912
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,000
Hi.

913
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,500
Oh, you did.

914
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,933
Oh, that's great.

915
00:45:46,033 --> 00:45:47,333
Oh.

916
00:45:47,433 --> 00:45:50,700
Yes, so the motorcycle can be affecting this.

917
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,700
Thanks.

918
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,033
Yep.

919
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:53,800
[hangs up phone]

920
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,866
Well, that's it.

921
00:45:54,966 --> 00:45:56,066
I was right.

922
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,433
The motorcycle has to go.

923
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:00,533

-That makes no sense.

00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,933
MITCH (OFFSCREEN): Yes, it does.

-Well, my life is changed.

I planned it around a baby I can't have.

I just need to stop and think.

1000
00:49:26,933 --> 00:49:28,366
Maybe I wasn't meant to have a baby.

00:55:55,966 --> 00:55:57,233
bring nothing but trouble.

1107
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:59,100
-I can't believe you told her.

1108
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,266
-What was I supposed to do?

1109
00:56:00,366 --> 00:56:01,466
I'm pregnant now.

1110
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,033
-And you're going to keep the baby?

1111
00:56:03,133 --> 00:56:04,500
-It's my baby.

1112
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,666
-No, you deliberately chose a lifestyle that does not

1113
00:56:06,766 --> 00:56:07,666
include babies.

1114
00:56:07,766 --> 00:56:09,233
-It does too include babies.

1115
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,766
-How are you going to raise a baby without a father, huh?

1116
00:56:11,866 --> 00:56:13,700
-Mom, you did it.

1117
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,600
-But there is a father.

1118
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,800
-Dad was never around.

1119
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,166
-She's not talking about dad, stupid.

1120
00:56:18,266 --> 00:56:19,433
She's talking about Mitch.

1121
00:56:19,533 --> 00:56:21,600
-You should really stop calling me stupid.

1122
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,033
-Stop it, both of you.

1123
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:26,066
Sariya, you and your husband have a baby coming now.

1124
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:27,733
-Mom, Sarita doesn't even want it.

1125
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,966
-Excuse me.

1126
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:33,466
Excuse me.

1127
00:56:33,566 --> 00:56:35,033
Could you take our picture please?

1128
00:56:35,133 --> 00:56:36,433
-I'll do it.

1129
00:56:39,766 --> 00:56:42,900
Could you stand right there?

1130
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,766
OK, wait.

1131
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:45,566
Move that way a little.

1132
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:46,200
Great.

1133
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,466
Sorry, a little--

1134
00:56:47,566 --> 00:56:48,233
OK.

1135
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:48,866
SARITA (OFFSCREEN): Reena.

1136
00:56:48,966 --> 00:56:50,133
-Wait.

1137
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:52,600
-Take the damn picture, for Christ's sake!

1138
00:56:55,466 --> 00:56:56,566
-Artist, heh?

1139
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,900
-Beta, you should be making up and getting

1140
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,600
ready for the baby.

1141
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,066
-I'm not pushing my life aside because Reena's pregnant.

1142
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:11,100
-You are ruining your life.

1143
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:17,600
-We can make this work.

1144
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,800
Please.

1145
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,433
I--

1146
00:57:21,533 --> 00:57:23,066
I have to figure out what I want.

1147
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:26,700
I just need some space to think.

1148
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,100
I'm sorry.

1149
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,500
It's just too important.

1150
00:57:31,533 --> 00:57:33,666
-I can't believe Reena and I are the only ones who care

1151
00:57:33,766 --> 00:57:34,833
about this baby.

1152
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:36,566
-I also care about the baby.

1153
00:57:42,466 --> 00:57:43,966
-I know it's going to be difficult, but you know, I

1154
00:57:44,066 --> 00:57:45,733
don't know what else we can do.

1155
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,666
-[expostulates]

1156
00:57:47,766 --> 00:57:48,666
What about us?

1157
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:50,000
I thought we were a couple.

1158
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,166
-Yeah, some couple.

1159
00:57:51,266 --> 00:57:53,766
You haven't even unpacked yet.

1160
00:57:53,866 --> 00:57:56,133
-You have no idea what you're getting yourself into.

1161
00:57:56,233 --> 00:57:57,366
Have you looked into schools?

1162
00:57:57,466 --> 00:57:59,966
I mean, do you know how much a kid costs?

1163
00:58:00,066 --> 00:58:03,533
-Lisa, why don't you believe we can do this?

1164
00:58:03,633 --> 00:58:05,866
-Reena, nine months was one thing.

1165
00:58:05,966 --> 00:58:08,666
This is totally different.

1166
00:58:08,766 --> 00:58:09,800
-Yeah, it's jus--

1167
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,100
I knew I couldn't count on you.

1168
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,433
-That's so off.

1169
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:14,200
-Hey, what's up?

1170
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,200
-Hey, do you have your keys?

1171
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,533
-Where are yours?

1172
00:58:16,633 --> 00:58:17,600
We're locked out.

1173
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,633
Can I have your keys?

1174
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:21,266
-Here.

1175
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:22,400
-Thanks.

1176
00:58:25,766 --> 00:58:27,066
Reena.

1177
00:58:29,966 --> 00:58:31,066
-Is she OK or what?

1178
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:32,466
-Yeah, she'll be fine.

1179
00:58:38,366 --> 00:58:39,666
-Shit, Janis, I'm fucked.

1180
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:45,666
It's all fucked.

1181
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:52,233
-What, you mean that whole pseudo nuclear family, diaper

1182

changing, who's going to pick up the kid from school, we

1183
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,033
should get a dog because Heather has two mommies,

1184
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,766
lesbian parental lifestyle?

1185
00:58:58,866 --> 00:59:00,900
-Can we talk about something else?

1186
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,433
-Oh, sure.

1187
00:59:02,533 --> 00:59:03,633
-Good.

1188
00:59:06,733 --> 00:59:08,366
-How was your date?

1189
00:59:08,466 --> 00:59:09,066
-Ha.

1190
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,933
Who, Velveeta Lara?

1191
00:59:11,033 --> 00:59:12,333
The process queen of Brooklyn?

1192
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:18,033
She's emotionally unavailable right now.

1193
00:59:18,133 --> 00:59:20,866
Call me back later.

1194
00:59:20,966 --> 00:59:24,566
This is when I can't stand being a lesbian.

1195
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:26,200
I mean, all this bullshit.

1196
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,500
We were never like that.

1197
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,566
-No!

1198
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:29,733
We were young and-- and-- untainted, man.

1199
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,000
-Absolutely.

1200
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,566
-Yeah, that fucking emotional bullshit.

1201
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:34,466
-You slept with her?

1202
00:59:34,566 --> 00:59:35,300
-Yeah.

1203
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,733
-She was my first girlfriend!

1204
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:37,700
-So what?

1205
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,600
You slept with mine.

1206
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,700
-That's not the point.

1207
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,100
-Take a pill!

1208
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,300
-I can't fucking believe you did that.

1209
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,266
[laugh]

1210
00:59:52,566 --> 00:59:55,500
-But you know, at least the boundaries have been

1211
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,700
established.

1212
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,300

-But--

1216
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:38,000
-What?

1217
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:38,766
-I'm--

-That was nice.

-Janis, it's the last thing I need right now.

-Honey?

1222
01:00:57,333 --> 01:01:00,000
I'm going to go to my mom's for a while.

1223
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,733
I just need some time by myself.

1224
01:01:05,033 --> 01:01:07,533
Reena?

1225
01:01:07,633 --> 01:01:08,733
-I'll tell her.

1226
01:01:15,933 --> 01:01:18,633
-You're doing the right thing.

1227
01:01:18,733 --> 01:01:19,833
-Thanks, Tiffany.

-Your hair looks nice.

1231
01:01:45,766 --> 01:01:47,066
Uh, new color?

1232
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:52,333
-When are you going back home?

1233
01:01:52,433 --> 01:01:54,466
-I thought you said that I'd always have a home here.

1234
01:01:54,566 --> 01:01:56,433
-Well, don't be such a smart-ass.

1235
01:01:56,533 --> 01:01:58,366
Is something's going on with that Janis?

1236
01:01:58,466 --> 01:01:58,900
-No!

1237
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,866
Oh, please.

1238
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:00,600
Nothing.

1239
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,900
-Thank god.

1240
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,266
I mean, that one was a nut case, you know?

1241
01:02:03,366 --> 01:02:04,966
-I just need some time to think.

1242
01:02:05,066 --> 01:02:07,433
-What's to think about?

1243
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:10,833
Are you still in love with Reena?

The deed is done.

1247

If you love her, you'll stay.

1248
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,333
It's simple.

1249
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:17,900
-No, Ma.

1250
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,833
No moda fatto.

OK, it's a baby.

-Oh, no.

1254
01:02:22,733 --> 01:02:24,800
You're different.

1255
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,500
You leave your pregnant girlfriend.

-Ma!

1257
01:02:27,266 --> 01:02:28,300
It's not even mine!

01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,900
-Huh, that's what they all say.

1259
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,600
Isn't it good that you're so different?

01:03:33,933 --> 01:03:36,333
-Sorry I freaked out.

1261
01:03:36,433 --> 01:03:37,633
-Lisa, I just want you to--

1262
01:03:37,733 --> 01:03:38,833
-You know, Reena?

1263
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:43,600
It's not fair expecting me to be a parent.

1264
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:44,633
OK?

1265
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:45,833
It was never part of the plan.

1266
01:03:45,933 --> 01:03:47,066
And I don't know what you're doing.

1267
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:48,500
But I'm not going backwards.

1268
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,866
I can't.

1269
01:03:49,966 --> 01:03:51,633
-I don't think of it as backwards.

1270
01:03:51,733 --> 01:03:53,900
-Yeah, well, it is.

1271
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,033
Everyone I went to school with has 2.5 kids and a mortgage

1272
01:03:58,133 --> 01:03:59,833
and husbands that don't come home.

1273
01:03:59,933 --> 01:04:00,966
-You're not like that.

1274
01:04:01,066 --> 01:04:02,500
It's not going to be like that.

1275
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,233
-Reena, you don't know what it's like.

1276
01:04:07,866 --> 01:04:09,800
-Lisa, I'm having a baby.

1277
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,833
-Yeah, like you always wanted.

1278
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:14,766
-You know what?

1279
01:04:14,866 --> 01:04:16,166
At least I'm not afraid.

1280
01:04:19,633 --> 01:04:22,366
-Reena, who are you doing this for?

1281
01:04:22,466 --> 01:04:24,400
You're the one who's afraid, you know.

1282
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:57,633
-Hey, sis.

1283
01:04:57,733 --> 01:04:59,100
Lisa's not back yet, and I was wondering if you could just--

1284
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,866
-I'm really not interested.

1285

01:19:52,933 --> 01:19:54,833
You are like the brother.

1466
01:19:54,933 --> 01:19:56,966
-Sorry.

1467
01:19:57,066 --> 01:19:58,200
-This is a symbol of protection.

1468
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:01,366
You promise to protect your sister.

1469
01:20:01,466 --> 01:20:02,533
All right?

1470
01:20:02,633 --> 01:20:05,333
Now this is a ceremony to bless the new baby.

1471
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:07,800
I've done this twice for both of them.

1472
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:13,400
You--

1473
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,766
you are the--

1474
01:20:14,866 --> 01:20:16,866
like the husband.

1475
01:20:16,966 --> 01:20:20,100
You sit here.

1476
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,566
And Mitch--

1477
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,633
all right.

1478
01:20:26,733 --> 01:20:28,466
Open-- open this.

1479
01:20:28,566 --> 01:20:32,200
I will put these almonds in your lap.

1480
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,366
They are a-- a symbol of--

1481
01:20:35,466 --> 01:20:37,433

1482

1483
01:20:42,466 --> 01:20:44,866
Now, everybody.

1484
01:20:44,966 --> 01:20:46,633
What-- what to do.

1485
01:20:46,733 --> 01:20:47,833
Oh god.

[music playing]

1487
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,800
-Now one of the things we need to do today is to begin to

1488
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,800
work with the different kinds of body positions that women

1489
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:19,833
have historically worked with to birth their babies.

1490
01:21:19,933 --> 01:21:21,033
-Reena, don't sit like that.

1491
01:21:21,133 --> 01:21:22,300
You'll put pressure on the baby.

1492
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,033
It'll come out with a funny head.

1493
01:21:24,133 --> 01:21:25,166
-That's not true.

1494
01:21:25,266 --> 01:21:26,300
-It's just another old wives' tale.

1495
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,566
-Are you saying that I'm too old?

1496
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:28,233
-No, shh!

1497
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:28,733
Shh!

1498
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:29,633
-No, Mom.

1499
01:21:29,733 --> 01:21:30,666
No, you're not too old--

1500
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:31,566
Wait - we won't able to hear.

-All right!

1503

Forget it.

1504
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:34,600
Everybody just leave.

1505
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:35,500
You can't handle this.

1506
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,466
I'll find a new partner.

Go, go.

1508
01:21:37,466 --> 01:21:38,366
I mean it.

1509

Get out.

1510
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,500
Go.

1511
01:21:42,966 --> 01:21:45,500
-Too many cooks?

1512
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,700

-Thanks.

01:21:57,566 --> 01:21:59,766
-You think Reena's going to like this new dress, huh?

1516
01:21:59,866 --> 01:22:01,033
-Yeah, Mom.

1517
01:22:01,133 --> 01:22:02,233
She always likes the dresses you buy her.

1518
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:03,633
Haven't you noticed that over the years?

1519
01:22:03,733 --> 01:22:05,933
-You know, you should stop being so selfish, huh?

1520
01:22:06,033 --> 01:22:07,333
You're going to be a masi now.

1521
01:22:13,133 --> 01:22:15,633
-And the kinds of sounds that are useful are the

1522
01:22:15,733 --> 01:22:18,833
open-throated sounds, because the throat is very connected

1523
01:22:18,933 --> 01:22:20,266
to the vagina.

1524
01:22:20,366 --> 01:22:22,233
So when you're open in your throat, it's very likely

1525
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:23,700
you're going to be opening through your

1526
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,066
cervix and your vagina.

1527
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:26,800

-No, I don't want any drugs.

-Oh, constipation?

-No.

1557
01:23:09,133 --> 01:23:10,833
You get those pains in your ovaries.
