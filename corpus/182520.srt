11
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,053
That hostess keeps staring at you.

12
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:47,122
You think it's the first time ?
Every port I go, it's the same.

13
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,397
For a man, strength is everything !

14
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,596
Strength ?

15
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,863
If you've got any strength left,
put it into your work.

16
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:55,498
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,338
Grandma !

18
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,604
Is our cute little girl back ?

19
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,817
Stop feeding her !
We'll have nothing left.

20
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,889
Someone's fallen in !

21
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:18,522
Out of the way ! Who fell in ?

22
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,029
This is a disaster !

23
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,532
Why can't you be more careful ?

24
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,312
These goods cost more than any of you.

25
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,008
Subtract it from his salary.

26
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,348
If that's not enough,
you pay the rest.

27
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,252
... and keep them from misfortune.

28
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:49,159
Provide them with days of plenty,

29
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,529
give the farmers a good harvest,
protect the paper mill,

30
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,696
and give the fishermen a bountiful catch.

31
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:13,950
This cup will bring peace to the island.

32
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,725
Have you found the missing crewman ?

33
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,631
Ahem... not yet...

34
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:37,138
He may try to steal the secrets
of our paper manufacturing.

35
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,771
Find him for certain,
discover his objective,

36
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,339
and find out what
he has been doing all this time.

37
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,942
Blood rain has fallen !

38
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,692
You scoundrels !

39
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,463
- Why are you doing this again ?
- Take him away.

40
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,729
Father, please stop this !

41
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,772
The wrath of heaven is coming !

42
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,069
The commissioner is coming !

43
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,221
May the Great king of the sea...

44
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,021
bless us with fruitful years.

45
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,493
Here is the captain.

46
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,314
Spare me a little gratuity, will you ?

47
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,282
Are you drunk again ?

48
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,153
How many times has it been ?

49
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,715
Don't think we will keep
feeding you money forever.

50
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,384
Don't be unreasonable.

51
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:06,296
You know this small tongue of mine
can put you in great danger ?

52
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,699
For the occasional coin
I can be kept silent.

53
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:13,227
Don't be so stingy.

54
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,272
Come to the port after the shamanic ritual.

55
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,504
I live thanks to your generosity.

56
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,637
Is the game over yet ?

57
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,643
I'll bring some money later,
so deal first.

58
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:59,708
Hey everyone, we set sail at dawn,
so don't drink too much.

59
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:05,748
Hey, don't think you can sail off
so easily with my money.

60
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,522
Hey you, I'll find some way
to cover your pay, so brighten up.

61
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,532
Yes, captain.

62
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,363
The mood is dark enough already.

63
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:22,474
To cheer you up,
Let's go see the ritual...

64
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,908
Don't you know that outsiders
can't go near the ritual ?

65
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,411
Do you want to bring on misfortune ?

66
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,143
I'll be watching over you all night !

67
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,277
Won't you bring this man some food ?

68
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,184
I'm on my way.

69
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,620
What are you doing ?

70
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,949
The summerheat is at its peak.

71
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,820
Do not concern yourself.

72
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:17,860
It may be the last time for me.

73
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:21,594
I should at least offer my respects.

74
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:26,661
My lord, please don't say such things.

75
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,536
Please stay healthy,

76
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:33,670
and continue blessing us
with your benevolent rule.

77
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,512
Benevolent rule ?

78
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:41,713
Don't you know this village
has no ruler besides our king ?

79
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:46,383
Are you trying to make me
into a traitor ?

80
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,090
If you speak such
reckless words again...

81
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:53,154
I am filled with shame, my lord.

82
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:40,262
Have you been living comfortably
after tearing my body to shreds ?

83
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,899
Commissioner KANG !

84
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:52,780
Your blood shall soak the ground
and your flesh stripped to the bone !

85
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,123
Captain, something
terrible has happened !

86
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,128
Fire !

87
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,433
Put the fire out !

88
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,875
What is this ? Fire !

89
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:28,676
Fire !

90
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,848
Put the fire out ! Oh my God !

91
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,016
What happened ?

92
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,356
What were the guards doing ?

93
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,487
Just put out the fire !

94
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:44,058
Save the paper first !

95
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,536
Go and save the paper !

96
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:40,719
Day 1

97
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,886
It's just a small island,
but due to the paper mill,

98
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:49,423
it has become the
province's wealthiest area.

99
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,994
Most of the paper is sent
to the mainland or to China,

100
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:57,771
but twice a year it is paid
to the government as tribute.

101
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:02,473
The burned paper was of the highest
quality, destined for tribute.

102
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,895
Sir, we have almost arrived,
please try to bear it a bit longer.

103
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,122
You must have suffered
during this long journey.

104
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,093
I am JO Dal-ryong,
the man who wrote you.

105
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,925
This is the emissary,
came to investigate the case.

106
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,694
I am Officer LEE Won-kyu.
Is there another port on the island ?

107
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,736
No, this is the only one.

108
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,704
It may have been arson,
so no one should leave this island.

109
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,299
It is absolutely forbidden.

110
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:09,514
I trust you've been well,
and all is fine with the governor ?

111
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:14,042
You knew of the emissary's visit.
What kind of reception is this ?

112
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:17,213
Are you looking for a reprimand ?

113
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:22,317
It shames me to inform you,
but this morning...

114
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,394
The people cleaning up discovered it.

115
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:32,733
This is JANG Hak-soo,
one of the workers at the mill.

116
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,331
This is the son of
Lord KIM Chi-seong.

117
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,638
I am KIM In-kwon.

118
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,839
Is your father doing well ?

119
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,176
Yes, sir.

120
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,749
I met him when I worked
as a palace guard.

121
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,945
He was a man of honor.

122
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,149
There is little bleeding
around the wound.

123
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:58,129
And as there is no swelling, he must
have died before being impaled.

124
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:03,333
It seems that whoever committed
this act bore a deep grudge.

125
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,769
You scoundrel !
You set the fire on the ship, didn't you ?

126
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,433
Stop talking nonsense.

127
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:13,342
During the ritual
you were milling about the cargo ship !

128
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,811
Isn't that right ?

129
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,815
Aren't you the one who
poaches from the sesame field ?

130
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,407
What a fool.

131
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,353
You !

132
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,086
Losing the ship was bad enough,
now I'm accused of murder ?

133
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,598
It's not true, my lord !

134
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,259
What did you do last night ?

135
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:41,068
I was in low spirits,
so I drank with my crewmen all night.

136
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,608
I'm not lying, sir !

137
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,902
Is this true ?

138
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:46,876
Yes, sir.

139
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,779
After leaving the tavern,
the captain went to sleep.

140
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:53,409
At dawn... it was close to dawn.

141
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,985
From the corpse's rigid condition,

142
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:02,551
it seems JANG Hak-soo was killed
a couple hours past midnight.

143
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:07,463
If the sailor's words are true,
then he cannot be the criminal.

144
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,500
This is Doctor NAM.

145
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:19,374
This is Doo-ho, a paper mill dyer.
He will draw the autopsy illustration.

146
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,773
And those men... ?

147
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:27,886
- They will perform the autopsy.
- Let us begin.

148
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:44,068
20 centimeters long. .

149
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,661
20 centimeters.

150
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,600
Who is this man ?

151
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:58,379
His name is JANG Hak-soo,
a lazy man...

152
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,113
... who usually spent his time
drinking and gambling.

153
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:07,519
While the town held the ritual,
he was gambling as usual.

154
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:12,956
Did you make inquiries about
who saw him last ?

155
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:21,070
Yes, but it appears no one saw him
after his fight with the captain.

156
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:29,647
We couldn't find any further wounds
on the body.

157
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,913
Was he poisoned ?

158
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:37,012
Yes, sir. I also learned a local
medicine shop grows aconitum.

159
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:43,795
That is correct. It is effective
against neuralgia and chills.

160
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:48,492
The plant's root is very poisonous.
It is used to make poisoned arrows.

161
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,733
What were you doing after midnight ?

162
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,536
I was sleeping at home.

163
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,773
I heard you bought
some aconitum a few days ago.

164
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:05,442
Yes, I bought it for my neuralgia.

165
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,883
I heard you bought
at least a month's worth.

166
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,012
Then where is
the remaining medicine ?

167
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:15,993
You don't have any.
Because you poisoned JANG Hak-soo.

168
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:19,258
And you impaled the corpse
to hide the cause of death !

169
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,660
This isn't much,
but please eat your fill.

170
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,397
So he has fallen ill.

171
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,636
I hoped to greet him
after these many years.

172
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:38,513
Did he happen to remember my name ?

173
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,642
Yes.

174
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,220
You requested your
brother-in-law's promotion

175
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,483
when he was
in the State Archive...

176
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,857
It was nothing.

177
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:55,560
I just wanted to show my gratitude,
for looking after my brother-in-law.

178
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,502
I hope his condition improves soon.

179
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,972
I will let you know
when he feels better.

180
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:10,514
You have solved the incident
in a matter of days...

181
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,309
It was all thanks to the Emissary.

182
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,518
That's not true... I did nothing.

183
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:25,093
Did you know that he is
the son of Lord LEE Ji-sang ?

184
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,099
Like father, like son...

185
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,635
Is that so ?

186
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,605
I have the honor to meet his son.

187
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:41,305
Surely there is no one
who hasn't heard of his Lord.

188
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,116
Could you tell us
about your father ?

189
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,752
He was very strict with me.

190
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,919
Even though he spent
many days away from home,

191
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,398
I felt that not a day passed
without his reprimands.

192
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:07,302
So whenever he came home,
I tried to stay outside to avoid him.

193
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,436
What did you do so wrong,

194
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,845
for your father to scold you so often ?

195
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,746
It's not that.

196
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:22,617
Each time he came home,
he gave me a riddle.

197
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:28,058
They were difficult, but he scolded
me for being wrong or not answering.

198
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,651
So I couldn't help but
want to run away.

199
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,495
I'm sure he did so
to keep you studying.

200
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,303
Would you mind telling me
one of his riddles ?

201
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,208
Would you like to try
to solving one ?

202
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,417
One day, he gave me this...

203
00:20:56,188 --> 00:21:00,420
A 60 bo circle piece of land is
inscribed with a perfect pentagon.

204
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:04,826
A 3-square bo plot of land
yields 30 doi of barley.

205
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:10,357
Nine farmers give the landowner
80% of their barley harvest.

206
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,997
If, due to a drought, the yield
were reduced to 30%,

207
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,906
how much would
the land owner receive ?

208
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,276
That's quite a challenge.

209
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,984
It's 34 bags, isn't it ?

210
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:34,158
Using trigonometry and statistics,
we find that number,

211
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,218
but that's not the answer
my father wanted.

212
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,289
Then, did you find the answer ?

213
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,891
Yes, I did.

214
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:49,236
I can't come up with anything.

215
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:54,177
I hope you apply the same brilliance
to find who burned the cargo ship.

216
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,645
Day 2

217
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,256
Yes, sir.

218
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:10,819
You set the fire out of anger
at being beaten by Commissioner JO ?

219
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,160
No, my Lord. I was at the tavern...

220
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:18,760
This man was drinking at my tavern.
I was watching over him.

221
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,362
Did you serve him food at the inn ?

222
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,774
Yes, I served him food, then...

223
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,641
You spent the night
together with this man ?

224
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,771
Yes.

225
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,577
No, it wasn't like that...

226
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:36,654
At the start of the ritual,
JANG Hak-soo was at the harbour ?

227
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:42,024
Yes, lord. He was drunk and
wandering around the harbor.

228
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:47,990
When you discovered the burning ship,
did you see where the fire started ?

229
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,532
Maybe it was near here.

230
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,133
What color was the smoke ?

231
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,575
Blue !

232
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:06,811
Blue ?

233
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:10,981
Yes, it was a dim blue color.

234
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,183
You were drunk, weren't you ?

235
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:20,929
Yes, I was drinking,
and with the hostess, then...

236
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:44,719
Why is such a large paper mill
located on this remote island ?

237
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:50,160
This place has long been famous
for its sweet gum trees.

238
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:53,288
The water and sunlight are
ideally suited for paper making,

239
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,698
and furthermore I heard that
the mill's founder, KANG Seung-ryul,

240
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,328
wanted to keep
the methods of his craft secret.

241
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,586
Welcome, my Lord.

242
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,617
I will guide you.

243
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,363
Mulberry trees are mashed here,
and mixed with glues and dyes.

244
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:15,346
Then the pulp flows down this drain
and collects in that container.

245
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,439
You surely know how important
the paper tribute is.

246
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:23,113
If the tribute is late,
you will be severely punished.

247
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:27,648
I am pushing my workers
day and night to produce paper,

248
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,388
but it will still take
at least one month.

249
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,625
Who suffers most if the tribute is lost ?

250
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,395
The mill's owner will suffer the most.
His punishment will...

251
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,461
Did the murdered JANG Hak-soo
have a grudge against the owner ?

252
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,670
Not at all, my lord. The owner
never had a problem with anyone.

253
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:49,771
But Hak-soo held a grudge
against everyone else.

254
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:53,841
In my view, it seems
everyone is happy he is dead.

255
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,945
My lord, watch out !

256
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,489
My lord, are you hurt ?

257
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,799
My lord !

258
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:14,237
Quickly, get a doctor !

259
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:17,675
I am alright.

260
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,937
My deepest apologies.

261
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,744
Thank you.

262
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,238
My lord, the captain is here.

263
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,470
Let him in.

264
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:12,624
All the crew members say
they don't recognize these objects.

265
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,756
Do you know
where any of this came from ?

266
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:25,508
I'm not sure...
this isn't from the mast.

267
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:35,915
If they don't belong to the crew,
where did they come from ?

268
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,582
Has anything strange happened
recently among the crew ?

269
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:47,958
Three days before the fire,
a crewman named LEE went missing.

270
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,164
What kind of man is he ?

271
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:56,530
He spoke rarely, and kept to himself.
He didn't mix with the crew.

272
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,543
Was this his first time to the island ?

273
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:04,207
No, my lord.
Has it been three years ?

274
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:10,221
Every year he's volunteered
to come for the paper tribute.

275
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,656
The wound is deep,
so I applied medicine.

276
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,629
It should start to heal now.

277
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,575
Open the door.

278
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,449
Officer JANG !

279
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,459
I just heard about it in detail.

280
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,863
Did you get rid of Hak-soo
because of that ?

281
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,971
I was so worried that he would talk.

282
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,505
But why did you do it that way ?

283
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,013
Why did you impale him on a spear ?

284
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:14,642
I only poisoned his drink.
Why would I do something like that ?

285
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,683
You didn't do it ?

286
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:28,127
The voice of the shaman
was definitely Commissioner KANG's.

287
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,265
People even say
they saw blood rain.

288
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,394
Please get me off this island !
I can't bear it any longer.

289
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:45,338
Listen !
Tomorrow, you will be sent to prison.

290
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:52,583
I'll make a deal with
the prison guards, so keep quiet.

291
00:29:52,657 --> 00:30:02,089
Even if you suffer greatly,
trust me and don't say anything.

292
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,634
Understand ?

293
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,479
Help, help me !

294
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,481
Please help me !

295
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,996
Help, help me !

296
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:46,868
Forgive me !
Please forgive me !

297
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:45,226
Day 3

298
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,436
What is this ?

299
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,177
What kind of stench is this ?

300
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:11,979
My lord !

301
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,994
As if punishment for high treason,
one has been impaled on a spear,

302
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,396
and another boiled alive.

303
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,559
What are they trying to hide ?

304
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,105
I heard Officer JANG
dropped by last night.

305
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,539
Please, get me off of this island !

306
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:40,317
You must explain what is happening
before we send you anywhere !

307
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:50,751
- After HWANG Sa-young's execution...
- The catholic traitor ?

308
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:56,862
... five anonymous men informed on
Commissioner KANG.

309
00:33:56,934 --> 00:34:00,097
He was found guilty
of providing money to HWANG.

310
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:05,531
KANG was discovered
to be a Catholic,

311
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,771
and so to set an example to others,

312
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:13,913
the Inquisitor killed
one family member a day,

313
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,087
in five different ways.

314
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:22,184
What do you mean,
five different ways in five days ?

315
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,155
His young son
was impaled on a spear.

316
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,665
His daughter was boiled to death.

317
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,167
His wife was suffocated with paper,

318
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,430
and his old mother
got her head cracked.

319
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,275
And on the fifth day,

320
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:46,011
Commissioner KANG
had his limbs torn from his body.

321
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:52,217
Then someone is killing
the informants in the same manner ?

322
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,949
The informants were anonymous,
how did he know who they were ?

323
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,790
How should I know ?

324
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,762
Are you one of the informants ?

325
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,399
Then you must know
the remaining two informants.

326
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:14,102
We must solve the case
to send you to the mainland.

327
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,978
To solve it quickly,
we need to know what he wants.

328
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,415
How can you solve a murder
committed by a ghost ?

329
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,816
You're the one who killed
JANG Hak-soo.

330
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,754
I poisoned him,
but I did not impale him on a spear !

331
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,791
There must be a report
at the government office.

332
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:28,883
Take him away.

333
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,790
Yes, sir.

334
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:37,324
Protect me, please !
I may be next.

335
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:42,998
Put one officer on guard,
and have others lie in ambush.

336
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:47,101
If he's speaking the truth,
the murderer will come to him.

337
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:55,283
I looked in KANG's account book
at the paper mill,

338
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:59,881
and most of the towns people
were in debt to him.

339
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:06,624
But when he was charged with treason,
all had their debts forgiven.

340
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,464
After KANG died,

341
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,469
KIM Chi-seong, who owned 20%
of the mill, became owner.

342
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,061
Please look up there.

343
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,469
Catholic families have
talismans in their homes.

344
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:30,215
Before being punished,
Catholics may renounce their faith,

345
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:33,621
but for KANG not only
was that procedure omitted,

346
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,991
but he was executed on the island
without being sent to a court.

347
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,586
Perhaps his family...

348
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,064
So he was executed without reason ?

349
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:46,695
Perhaps the reason why
the informants were scared to appear

350
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,103
is because, for false accusations,

351
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,937
informants would be executed
by the same means as the accused.

352
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,499
Lieutenant LEE !

353
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:57,114
Now you are thinking dangerous thoughts.

354
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:00,708
To say that KANG's family
was falsely executed

355
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:06,280
is to imply the Inquisitor, acting
in the King's name, failed his duty.

356
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:10,953
Everything we know suggests
that KANG was not Catholic.

357
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:14,964
And someone who knows this
is taking revenge on the informants.

358
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,500
What are you talking about ?

359
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:24,669
What's the connection
between KANG and the arson ?

360
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,473
Do you mean that a traitor
has followers on the island ?

361
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,879
If the criminal is killing the informants,
three more remain.

362
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,349
So you posted that notice ?

363
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:38,377
People are reading it
and becoming even more worried.

364
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,856
Public sentiment is tossing
like the sea in a storm.

365
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,658
If we catch the criminal,
people will be put at ease.

366
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,093
I must meet your father.

367
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,896
He will know better than anyone
what happened then.

368
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:56,497
My father remains ill
from the shock of the arson.

369
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:59,737
Please wait until he has recovered.

370
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,404
Surely, we won't bother him
without any evidence.

371
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,144
As he is ill, we will wait for his recovery.

372
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,674
What is your reason
for staying in this place ?

373
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,583
Is it devotion to your dead master ?

374
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,918
If you are so devoted,
then why are you still alive ?

375
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:52,718
Your master died,
so why don't you follow him ?

376
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,724
Why do you live on with no regrets ?

377
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,467
That is not the case, my lord.

378
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,564
The cauldron where JANG died
was for mixing dye.

379
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,404
Was that your responsibility ?

380
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,137
Yes, my lord.

381
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,076
However I did not use it on that day.

382
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:14,015
- I will ask...
- When did you start serving KANG ?

383
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,181
I served him since I was 7 years old.

384
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:23,716
I was orphaned before coming
to the island, and he took me in.

385
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:29,059
I heard KANG taught you drawing.
Can you write as well ?

386
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,136
Only my name, with effort.

387
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,775
Is this Commissioner KANG ?

388
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,842
Yes.

389
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:44,380
Drawing or holding a portrait
of a convicted man is a crime,

390
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,211
are you aware of this ?

391
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:49,980
I didn't know that,
but they are like parents to me.

392
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,749
I will confiscate it.

393
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:06,994
By the way, do you think
the commissioner was guilty ?

394
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,210
I am asking you if the
commissioner was Catholic.

395
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,212
I don't know of such things.
