1
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:18,789
- Hey.
- Hey, there you are.

2
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,208
My favorite waitress.

3
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:22,877
Ah, you say that to every waitress.

4
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,712
Oh, no, no, no, you are.

5
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,798
Thanks.

6
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:32,720
Hey, you know, the last guy that paid me,
he paid me with a gram.

7
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:34,472
- A gram? Jesus...
- A gram.

8
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:35,638
This guy, he told me...

9
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:36,682
I know, right?

10
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:39,351
He told me that
he didn't carry money anymore

11
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:41,228
because money was old-fashioned.

12
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:43,415
- Really? Call me old-fashioned then.
- Old-fashioned.

13
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,732
Call me old-fashioned?

14
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:47,735
This guy says that...
He said that money was done.

15
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,119
- Yeah.
- And that what we needed was a new...

16
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,669
- Oh, fuck, what's that word?
- A new what?

17
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,534
Like a new...

18
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:59,830
- Like a, you know... come on.
- Oh, I know. No, I know what you mean.

19
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:02,291
- But you're so cute when you struggle.
- Come on.

20
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,086
What we need is a new currency.

21
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:06,962
- Right?
- Shit.

22
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:09,799
Yeah, that's what he said.
I liked that guy.

23
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:10,966
I bet you did.

24
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,346
- I can't have that.
- Not right now.

25
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:16,597
Maybe later.

26
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:19,725
I'll come find you later.
I'm gonna keep your 20.

27
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:21,185
Keep the 20, that's for you, doll.

28
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:24,396
Now I am gonna watch you wiggle away.

29
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,440
Wiggle away-

30
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,070
hey, keep your eyes off my girlfriend.

31
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,742
Hey, you believe I bowled a 240
in Monday's league?

32
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,870
<i>Bowling. Mi fa Cagare!</i>

33
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:41,455
Yeah.

34
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,792
You know, my people say
they can handle more.

35
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:50,214
That's just what my people like to hear.

36
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:53,008
How's 10 keys?

37
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:57,221
- It's not too heavy for me.
- Great.

38
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:05,187
Hey, let's get the fuck out of here.

39
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:08,232
Yeah. It stinks like something's burning.

40
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,484
Jesus.

41
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:12,736
- Jesus. God.
- What?

42
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:15,239
- What is it?
- No, no, it's all right.

43
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:16,758
- It's all right. I just...
- You're all right?

44
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:20,536
It's like indigestion, or my gallbladder,
or something. It's all right.

45
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:24,373
You think I wanna
count 40 grand in ones, Mangione?

46
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:27,168
What, do I look like a banker to you?
It's all there.

47
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:28,919
Man, I swear something is burning.

48
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:30,963
What the fuck?

49
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:33,132
- Shit. Come on.
- No, no, no.

50
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:36,760
- It's like my appendix burst or something...
- Fuck.

51
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:39,138
Let me get you out of here. Come on.

52
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:48,564
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the ground!

53
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:50,733
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the ground now!

54
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:52,234
Let's go! Now!

55
00:04:52,318 --> 00:04:54,111
Get your fucking hands off me!

56
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:55,946
Let's go, let's go.

57
00:04:56,614 --> 00:04:59,200
Hey, don't worry, Bob.
Our people will get us out of this.

58
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,120
Shut it. Shut it.

59
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:04,997
You okay? You all right?

60
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:06,665
Come on.

61
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:10,502
Holy shit.

62
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:13,756
Okay, let's go, let's go.

63
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:25,995
- Hey.
- Hey.

64
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,372
What are you doing up?

65
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:31,041
Couldn't sleep.

66
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,419
- You couldn't sleep?
- No.

67
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:39,591
- Did it go okay?
- Oh, yeah. Piece of cake.

68
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:49,727
So,

69
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,314
is Bob Mangione dead?

70
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:54,815
Oh...

71
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:57,735
He's dead, all right. Deep fried.

72
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,003
So, my niece and nephew,
are they good?

73
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:17,963
Look at them. They're good.

74
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:22,468
Yeah, yeah. That's good.
Because kids need a lot, you know.

75
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,053
Tell me about it.

76
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:28,015
So, Bobby, tell me.

77
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:29,933
What?

78
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:31,435
How much you get?

79
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:34,438
Come on.

80
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,941
Aunt Vicky, we have been through this.
I work for the government.

81
00:07:38,484 --> 00:07:40,069
You don't get a piece of the action?

82
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:41,820
No. A piece of the action?

83
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:44,573
- What, 10, 20%?
- No, not a dime.

84
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:48,619
Ah... and they call us criminals.

85
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:52,164
Eh. You should have stayed
with the accounting.

86
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:53,916
You could have cooked your uncle's books.

87
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,293
You could have owned this place by now.

88
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:59,671
Everyone needs a beachfront address.
I got six of them.

89
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:01,965
Yeah, well,
I just don't live in your world.

90
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:05,094
I'm afraid you do.

91
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:07,971
A little advice, Bobby?

92
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:11,475
Yeah, sure.

93
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:14,812
When your uncle Al died,

94
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,190
I didn't become a little old bag lady
in a bag dress.

95
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:21,819
No, no, no, I pulled myself up,

96
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:24,238
carried on in his name,

97
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:27,157
even when I didn't have enough
to buy a loaf of bread.

98
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:29,076
No one knew nothing.

99
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:33,247
I didn't have a pot to piss in,
but I had a caddy,

100
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,418
20 Chanel suits, diamonds up my throat,

101
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:39,837
and season tickets to the giants.

102
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:44,633
And nobody was giving me nothing.

103
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,969
- Nobody.
- Aunt Vicky, what do you want from me?

104
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:50,180
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

105
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,099
Please, dear.

106
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:55,644
Don't be Bobby loser.

107
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,149
Be Bobby somebody.

108
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:09,032
Listen up. It's bad out there,
so a couple of team changes.

109
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,535
Peters, you're with Sanchez.
Mazur, you're with Abreu.

110
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
What about cooky?

111
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,581
You'll still report to Steve,
but he'll ride the desk on this one.

112
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:16,707
Hit the lights.

113
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,168
Lights!

114
00:09:21,003 --> 00:09:24,798
When I say bad, I mean the county morgue had
to rent burger king's refrigerated trucks

115
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:27,885
to ice all the dead bodies
littering our sunny streets.

116
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,054
Score. Cartel 100, customs zero.

117
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,558
Meet with your connects,
talk to your informants, do your job.

118
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:37,186
All right, out, out, out. Everybody out.

119
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,479
<i>You understand me?</i>

120
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:40,772
<i>Before I go to jail,
I swear on my fucking kids,</i>

121
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:42,056
<i>I'm gonna put someone on Jeff.</i>

122
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:44,318
<i>You tell Jeff to meet me
at his father's development.</i>

123
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:45,694
<i>We'll go in the big pool.</i>

124
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:46,778
<i>And I'm gonna go in naked</i>

125
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:48,673
<i>so he doesn't have to worry
about me having a gun.</i>

126
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:50,657
<i>'Cause I 'm gonna bite
the motherfucker's cock off</i>

127
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:53,327
<i>- and I 'm gonna spit it in his wife's mouth.
</i>- Enough. Enough.

128
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,954
Bond denied. Take him away.

129
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,417
Hey, fuck you, buddy.

130
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:02,085
Huh?

131
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,089
Order. Take him away.

132
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:08,175
- Get the fuck off me.
- Mr. Myers...

133
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:09,736
I wonder what Sunday dinner
is like at his place.

134
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,971
Advise your client that if there's another
outburst like this, he's going to...

135
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:14,389
I need to tell you

136
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:17,809
because of your wound, you're eligible
for retirement with full benefits.

137
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,938
I'd hate to lose you, Bob.

138
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:27,277
<i>Once your children
walk out the door, they're on their own.</i>

139
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:29,321
<i>Woman". Say no...</i>

140
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:30,823
Uh-huh. Huh...

141
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:33,474
- Okay. Uh, colonel
mustard, in the library...

142
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,619
- He's always the guy.
- Do you want some reefer?

143
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,413
<i>- Four.
- It'll make you feel good.</i>

144
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:40,457
<i>No, no, no.</i>

145
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:48,882
Hello? Hello?

146
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:51,260
<i>Help your children to just say no.</i>

147
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:54,304
Hello? Anybody home?
I'm not a Jehovah's.

148
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:55,722
Hey, Mrs. Mazur, pardon.

149
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:57,867
- I'm sorry, but I'm with customs.
- Stay here. No, no, it's okay.

150
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:58,993
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

151
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:00,078
We're gonna have a little chat outside.

152
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:01,746
- Why don't you finish the game?
- Okay. It's kind of cold.

153
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,498
I'll be in in a minute.
It's all right. We're fine.

154
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:05,107
Carry on.
Andrea, take your time, okay.

155
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,460
- You know, we have a front door.
- Well, then answer it, bro.

156
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:09,462
Just because we don't answer,
doesn't mean you can just...

157
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:11,798
- I was knocking for 20 minutes.
- If I don't wanna answer my door.

158
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:13,693
I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry.
How about if we...

159
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:15,182
No, no. We're
not going inside.

160
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:16,326
What do you want?

161
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:17,828
Abreui well, hey.

162
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,165
- Tea, gentlemen?
- Ah. Bendita, it's so kind of you.

163
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,310
I don't get invited to
too many houses with a wife and tea.

164
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,335
You weren't invited.

165
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,647
More like coke, whores and Schlitz,
you know what I'm saying?

166
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:29,840
- Right.
- What is this, Darjeeling?

167
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:32,259
- I'll be in in a second. Thank you.
- Okay. Okay.

168
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,054
All right, bro, check it.

169
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:38,724
I got this money broker, Gonzalo Mora Jr.,

170
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:40,493
- who can connect us with some...
- Okay, let me guess,

171
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:42,161
you have a Colombian snitch
who gave you that name?

172
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:45,606
- They prefer to be called informants...
- I know what they prefer to be called.

173
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:46,982
How long have you known him?

174
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:49,085
- Long enough. What is this, 20 questions?
- Long enough.

175
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,528
- And how much is you offer?
- 250k. What do you care?

176
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:53,363
Is it coming out of your pocket?

177
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:55,616
$250,000 for...

178
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:58,118
Yeah, nobody said the war on drugs
was gonna be cheap, bro.

179
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,790
These people who sell information,
they walk on the dirty side of the street.

180
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:06,126
And then they cross over
to the side that's been swept.

181
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:10,172
But their shoes always stay muddy.

182
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:13,175
Is that Shakespeare?

183
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:17,804
Yeah. Shakespeare.

184
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:20,656
- All right. All right.
- You can see yourself out over the wall.

185
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:22,267
Okay. All right, be like that.

186
00:12:28,065 --> 00:12:29,399
Hey, Abreu.

187
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:32,778
You trust this guy?

188
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:36,073
As much as I trust you.

189
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:49,586
Come on, man.

190
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,547
Come on, pick up. Pick up.

191
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:03,058
Yeah.

192
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:11,400
Mmm. Mmm.

193
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,695
These fucking things are so fresh, man.

194
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,281
Hey, I got a bigger connect.

195
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:21,451
- These guys are the biggest of the big.
- Oh, yeah?

196
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,203
You need to trust me on that.

197
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:26,039
Trust you, man?
I pay you for information, not trust.

198
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:30,711
That's what I give you, man.
That ticket to the super bowl, papa.

199
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,420
Yeah, Steve, I've been thinking.

200
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:47,310
I think that
we've been doing this backwards.

201
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:52,733
We've been following the drugs
to get to the bad guys.

202
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:58,947
What if we chase the money
to get to the bad guys?

203
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,408
- The real power up at the top.
- Okay.

204
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:05,078
Only thing is,
I cannot work with emir Abreu.

205
00:14:05,162 --> 00:14:06,371
That dude is nuts.

206
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:08,331
- Well, can I be honest?
- Yeah.

207
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:11,668
You can't work without him.
He's your way in.

208
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:25,166
Come on, watch out,
you're stepping on all the bodies, man.

209
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:26,224
Mazu ri what?

210
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,440
You're stepping and it's disrespectful.
Hey, hey, look at this. Falconi.

211
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,147
Come on. It's the Italianist-sounding
name ever. Come on.

212
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,902
Look at the dates. You do the math.
I'd be <i>77</i> years old.

213
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:40,071
- That's about right. Leathery and Craggly.
- Let's go. Come on.

214
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:42,365
- Are you even looking?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm looking.

215
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:45,535
Here we go.

216
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:48,872
Bob Musella.

217
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:51,208
Dates are perfect.

218
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,877
Hey, what about this one?

219
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:55,337
Dominguez.

220
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,381
Emilio Dominguez.
Close enough to emir, I suppose.

221
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:01,218
- Yeah, it's kind of sexy.
- The dates work.

222
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,385
- Sexy?
- Yeah.

223
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:04,346
- Who the hell cares if it's sexy?
- I care.

224
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:06,723
It's my name.
I wanted to have a sexy name.

225
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:17,317
I have developed
what I like to call my masterpiece.

226
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,863
There's a built-in noise reduction system
to eliminate all undesirable sound.

227
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:26,284
Eagle wings up, record. Horizontal, off.

228
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:28,829
<i>He is a real entrepreneur.</i>

229
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:31,206
Aeronautics, finance.

230
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,542
Even has his own line of wholesale jewelry.

231
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,478
<i>- There he is.</i> Eric <i>Wellman.
- Got his hand in everything.</i>

232
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,004
How are you?
Good to see you. Emir Abreu.

233
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:39,232
- Hey, man.
- What's up, my man?

234
00:15:39,256 --> 00:15:41,049
I've set up phone lines on the switchboard.

235
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:43,718
- So, how did you two meet again?
- The IRS.

236
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:47,347
IRS. You two must have got all the pussy.
"This is an audit, drop the panties."

237
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,515
Don't encourage him.

238
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:51,476
You've got access to my secretaries,
free use of the conference room.

239
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:53,979
- Anything else, you only have to ask.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

240
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:57,107
Chacho, this is so much more like it. Nice.

241
00:15:57,274 --> 00:15:59,252
You should have seen the apartment
customs gave us.

242
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:01,903
Oh, my god. It was so filthy
even the rats ran from it, you know.

243
00:16:02,404 --> 00:16:03,488
Thank you, Eric.

244
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:20,297
Mmm!

245
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:28,513
Okay.

246
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:00,085
Welcome, everyone.

247
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:00,420
Welcome, everyone.

248
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:03,381
It's parents' night. This is second grade.

249
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:08,011
My lesson plan is a cooperative process
that I build with the parents.

250
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:10,764
And to have you here...

251
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,474
Oh, god, I'm sorry.

252
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:18,438
I have to get this.

253
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:19,522
Um...

254
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:21,983
- I apologize. I... should I...
- No, it's okay. Um...

255
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,486
- No, it's... it's okay.
- Okay, sorry.

256
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,321
Very sorry to interrupt.

257
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:28,823
- Oh, hi.
- I'm Andrea's father.

258
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:31,284
I hope she's doing well in school.
She loves it.

259
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:32,953
- Oh, great.
- But I do have to go.

260
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:34,680
- Um, do you need money for a cab?
- No, it's okay.

261
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:36,581
You're okay. Okay. Sorry.

262
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:39,209
- Thanks. Bye.
- No problem.

263
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:42,772
- Ah!
- Abreui eh.

264
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,961
Hey!

265
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:15,425
Shut the fuck up!

266
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:22,765
Eh...

267
00:21:55,673 --> 00:21:56,674
Hey.

268
00:21:57,133 --> 00:22:00,029
- What the hell happened back there?
- What were you so pissed off about, man?

269
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:02,406
- What am I pissed off about?
- Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, man.

270
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,491
I called your wife and told her
you were gonna be late for dinner

271
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:05,868
'cause you were locked in a closet,
you know.

272
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:08,019
Bob, we're all waiting
for you to come out the closet.

273
00:22:08,102 --> 00:22:09,103
You know that, right?

274
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:12,982
So, this is all just a joke to you?

275
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,752
Oh, come on, man. You need a beer.
You need to relax.

276
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:16,486
I don't want a beer, I want answers.

277
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,797
Bro, what do I have to do
to make you happy, man?

278
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:20,365
Just don't get me killed.

279
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,843
Oh, that's just... hold it, hold it.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

280
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:25,662
I gotta write that shit down.
That's fucking brilliant.

281
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,914
"Don't get Bob killed."

282
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:29,332
Cut the shit, will you?

283
00:22:29,874 --> 00:22:32,436
It's the little things that get you
whacked, do you understand that?

284
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,254
- I understand that.
- And that's why I plan.

285
00:22:34,337 --> 00:22:36,631
And so when your snitch pulls a gun on me,

286
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:39,318
- a gun that he's not supposed to have...
- Okay, man, I didn't know. I'm...

287
00:22:39,342 --> 00:22:40,468
I start to wonder,

288
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:43,763
"ls emir on my side? Ls he with me or not?"

289
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,908
Man, you never gotta question
if I'm on your side or not

290
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,517
'cause I'm always on your fucking side!

291
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,685
Do you have my back?

292
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,437
I got your back, man.
Do you have my fucking back?

293
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:55,650
Bob.

294
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:05,702
Thank you.

295
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,621
Bobby.

296
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:10,498
- You look good, Dom.
- Thank you.

297
00:23:11,874 --> 00:23:13,543
Sorry about the cuffs. Regulations.

298
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,004
What are you gonna do?
Don't worry about it.

299
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:20,758
You should put those on.
Could get a little messy.

300
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:22,552
You serious?

301
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:26,723
Fucking hell.

302
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,146
Get the fuck out of here. Bobby, come on.

303
00:23:34,564 --> 00:23:36,024
Fuck. What, no coffee?

304
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,735
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck you, Bobby.

305
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:40,587
You didn't forget?
What's the matter with you?

306
00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:41,779
Black coffee.

307
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,657
- Two sugars.
- Thank you, Bob.

308
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:46,993
Fuck.

309
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,829
Look, Dom.

310
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:54,417
I don't care who you work for right now.
I really don't. I'm not here for that.

311
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:58,296
- Right, so what do you want, Bob?
- When you cooperated before,

312
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:01,716
it led to drugs off the street,

313
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,303
and a lot of punks right here
in this shithole that you call your home.

314
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:07,764
- Sorry, Bobby, I can't rat.
- I'm not asking you to rat.

315
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,223
Can't do it.

316
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:13,019
I'm asking you to just act.

317
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:17,106
- Like fucking what?
- Like you.

318
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:20,943
Just be yourself. I need you.

319
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:31,454
You been sleeping
in your office again, counselor?

320
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:32,872
Why would I go home?

321
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:35,195
So many wonderful criminals and perverts
to hang outwith.

322
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:38,044
- You all set out here?
- Yeah.

323
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:39,962
Okay. Flip him or fuck him.

324
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:47,804
All right.

325
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:57,688
You have an impressive portfolio,
Mr. Musella.

326
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,357
Musella. Thank you.

327
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:04,779
I manage the financial affairs
of a group of Colombian businessmen.

328
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,699
They've accumulated wealth
in foreign accounts

329
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:11,828
and would like me to invest it for them
in Florida real estate.

330
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:15,081
- Is that feasible?
- It's not a problem.

331
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:18,268
You think you'll need to move money
the other way,

332
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,836
from the us out of the country?

333
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:24,674
That would be something
we might consider.

334
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:35,143
- Hey. How are you?
- What's up, man?

335
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,358
Mr. Dominguez?

336
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:45,486
- I'm Lee Palmer.
- That ready?

337
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,007
- I like the way you work, sir.
- Come on, let's get to it.

338
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:50,032
- Follow me.
- All right.

339
00:27:11,155 --> 00:27:12,323
Okay.

340
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:14,742
All right.
Now, I'm gonna feed the wire.

341
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:16,786
Yeah. Yeah, I got it, dad.

342
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,246
Mazu ri pull it.

343
00:27:18,788 --> 00:27:22,917
Now, you see that little tab of tape
on the end here?

344
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,877
- Yeah. Okay.
- You can come on down.

345
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:30,007
- There we go. Hey, look at that.
- Cool, dad.

346
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:32,677
What are you doing?

347
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:35,888
What am I doing?
Well, Scotty and I are hooking up a light.

348
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:40,560
So, when someone calls daddy's work line,
it flashes instead of rings.

349
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:43,928
Guys, go get ready for dinner.

350
00:27:44,105 --> 00:27:45,439
- Okay.
- Okay.

351
00:27:46,148 --> 00:27:47,858
- Wash your hands.
- Yeah, mom.

352
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,487
Hey.

353
00:27:57,535 --> 00:27:58,869
You okay?

354
00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:03,708
Promise me this is the last one.

355
00:28:07,461 --> 00:28:08,796
I promise.

356
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:11,382
Good.

357
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:16,554
Okay?

358
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:21,601
So, what's your UC?

359
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:28,024
- I launder money for the mob.
- Oh, that figures.

360
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,485
- Why?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.

361
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:35,531
- What? You're looking at my hair.
- No, it, it...

362
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:11,859
Gentlemen, I sincerely apologize.
Family business got in the way.

363
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:15,029
Señor Mora, Gonzalo. Bob Musella.

364
00:29:15,112 --> 00:29:17,657
Pleasure to meet you.
Please, let me make it up to you.

365
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:22,411
We are going to have a fantastic evening.

366
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:24,246
- I promise you that.
- Yeah.

367
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:28,000
Hey, Bobby, come here.

368
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:32,755
- You look fucking great, man.
- Yeah?

369
00:29:41,222 --> 00:29:44,100
My financial structure is already in place.

370
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:47,687
So, you invest with me
and a portion of your money stays put

371
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,441
while the majority of your cash
gets filtered through my businesses

372
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:55,277
so that you are able to do with it
what you please.

373
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:59,115
We don't park cash.
That isn't the way we do business.

374
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:04,537
Mr. Mora, with all due respect,
it's the way I do business.

375
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:07,581
Now, I've checked your transactions.

376
00:30:07,957 --> 00:30:11,836
Large sums to companies like
Southern air transport,

377
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:14,797
that raises the feds' antennae. You know...

378
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,053
Exactly. It looks like
one big money laundering machine.

379
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:23,013
And that's not what you want.
That's not bueno.

380
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:28,769
However, smaller sums with more
frequent deposits through my companies

381
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:32,022
fly right under the radar of the feds.
You know why?

382
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:35,443
Because all of my companies are legitimate.

383
00:30:35,693 --> 00:30:36,986
<i>Capisce?</i>

384
00:30:37,153 --> 00:30:39,822
I cannot allow my businesses

385
00:30:40,281 --> 00:30:43,659
and your money to be compromised.

386
00:30:46,203 --> 00:30:48,247
What you say is reasonable.

387
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:51,959
- We have to speak to our bosses.
- Of course.

388
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:55,212
Yeah, nothing more can happen
without their okay.

389
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:59,341
- I will set it up.
- Thank you. Thank you. That's all I ask.

390
00:30:59,884 --> 00:31:02,261
Okay, I promise. No more business.

391
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:05,347
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go. Just fun from now on.

392
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,517
And this is on me
because I'm ashamed I was late.

393
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,520
And you know,
I got a surprise for you tonight.

394
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,321
She's my present for you tonight, Mr. Bob.

395
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:48,390
Your friend paid me for
anything you desire.

396
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:10,579
You're beautiful.

397
00:32:11,622 --> 00:32:13,749
But I'm good. Okay?

398
00:32:27,972 --> 00:32:29,306
Mr. Bob?

399
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:34,311
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

400
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:35,437
Yeah, yeah.

401
00:32:35,646 --> 00:32:37,314
No, no, no. Stay, stay, stay.

402
00:32:40,568 --> 00:32:41,777
Yeah, well...

403
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:47,533
You don't know me very well, my friend,
but I'm engaged

404
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,453
to be married. You know, so...

405
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,456
So?

406
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,002
You know, I...

407
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:01,338
I shit the bed on the first marriage.

408
00:33:01,422 --> 00:33:02,464
<i>Does that... Comprende?</i>

409
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,049
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

410
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:06,733
And I don't wanna fuck this one up.
You know what I mean? So, I...

411
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:10,681
- Oh, yeah, go ahead, laugh. Go ahead.
- Okay.

412
00:33:10,764 --> 00:33:12,266
All right, all right.

413
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,609
A fiancée, Bob?

414
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:22,735
Huh?

415
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:25,195
Are you kidding me? A fucking fi-an-cée.

416
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:27,072
I'm a married man.

417
00:33:27,156 --> 00:33:28,616
Bob, you're undercover.

418
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:30,659
You gotta do
whatever the fuck you gotta do, man.

419
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:32,223
You should have fucked that stripper,

420
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:34,955
fucking do a line of coke,
anything to stay alive, man.

421
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,749
You got the best fucking job in the world.

422
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:38,792
I can't believe
I have to talk you into this shit.

423
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:41,211
Bob, I know these people, man.

424
00:33:41,295 --> 00:33:44,274
You gotta play with them, you gotta
drink with them, you gotta fuck with them.

425
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:45,758
That's the way you get their trust.

426
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:48,344
Hey, I'm alive, aren't I?

427
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:51,263
Oh, my god, you're a piece of work, Bob.

428
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:52,973
You're a fucking piece of work.

429
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:56,451
I mean, why are you even doing this, Bob?
Why do you even bother?

430
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:58,496
I mean, I heard about
the retirement they offered you.

431
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,066
You, the wife, and kids, you guys could be
playing cricket on a yacht, eating early...

432
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,818
Whatever it is that fucking white people do
when you retire.

433
00:34:05,194 --> 00:34:06,487
Why are you doing this?

434
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:10,532
Man, because I love this shit.
That's why, baby.

435
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:12,534
It's my fucking drug of choice.

436
00:34:13,202 --> 00:34:14,662
Let me tell you something, nobody,

437
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:17,790
nobody does it better than me.

438
00:34:17,873 --> 00:34:19,875
So, listen to me sometimes, will you?

439
00:35:36,744 --> 00:35:39,288
My friends, welcome to the United States.

440
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:42,624
- Mr. Bob.
- Gonzalo. Pleasure.

441
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,130
This man here is Javier Ospina.
He does laundry for Escobar.

442
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:50,466
Robert Musella. Pleasure to meet you, sir.

443
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:52,426
The pleasure's mine.

444
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:55,345
And you are?

445
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:58,140
She's with me.

446
00:35:59,016 --> 00:36:01,518
- She's with him? She's with him.
- She's with him, yeah.

447
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,927
How about that, huh?
Hey, I don't know if you know this,

448
00:36:03,979 --> 00:36:06,982
- but Bob owns all of Oceanbird airlines.
- Boss. You need to sign these.

449
00:36:07,608 --> 00:36:08,942
Thank you.

450
00:36:10,611 --> 00:36:12,189
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Dominic.

451
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:15,014
He's my cousin and also an
executive with Oceanbird.

452
00:36:15,157 --> 00:36:17,201
No, tell them the truth. I'm your asshole.

453
00:36:17,326 --> 00:36:19,596
Any time Bob's ass is in a hole,
mine better hop straight to it.

454
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,538
I'd do anything for my cousin. All right?

455
00:36:22,164 --> 00:36:24,583
All right, who's ready
to go to Jersey, right?

456
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:25,834
Let's go to Bob's mansion.

457
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:29,379
It's a nice little place, but, please...

458
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:40,849
- Well, welcome to my home.
- Thank you.

459
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:43,727
<i>Because of the family's business,</i>

460
00:36:43,977 --> 00:36:47,231
I have access to foreign banks,
including Panama,

461
00:36:47,314 --> 00:36:50,818
which has strict secrecy laws
that protects us all.

462
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:55,823
Your business will boom
if you work with me.

463
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,450
I'm sorry, Mr. Bob. But what is "boom"?

464
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:01,620
Boom... uh...

465
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:03,455
Grow.

466
00:37:03,747 --> 00:37:05,707
You gotta understand that Bob's a gardener,

467
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:10,129
and he sprinkles a little water on the
money, and all of a sudden it blooms.

468
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:12,381
What is "bloom"?

469
00:37:12,548 --> 00:37:13,841
Abreui bloom, it's...

470
00:37:14,174 --> 00:37:16,552
It's rooms and rooms full of cash, Chacho.

471
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,887
Rooms filled with cash.

472
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:21,640
- Si, something like that. Yeah. Yeah.
- Sounds good, man.

473
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:24,726
- May god bless you with that problem.
- Yeah, amen to that.

474
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:31,066
Well, my people in Colombia
have always been

475
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,902
very, very comfortable
with the Panamanian banks.

476
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:37,573
Noriega has handled
some of our most sensitive business.

477
00:37:37,906 --> 00:37:41,910
I promise you that I will make it
my business to enhance yours.

478
00:37:42,744 --> 00:37:47,875
And when I do, I need a promise from you
that you will make it your business

479
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:50,294
to let the right people know my name.

480
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:52,880
Money makes money.

481
00:37:53,422 --> 00:37:54,506
Here's to that.

482
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:59,136
Now, no one can put me in jail
because I make a bad loan.

483
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:01,555
However, if I'm dishing out cash

484
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:04,933
to a client like Southern air transport,
which has no cover,

485
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:08,729
and one of their planes goes down
with a load of powder,

486
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:11,106
I am fucked.

487
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:14,401
And so are you. And you, and you.

488
00:38:15,777 --> 00:38:20,782
So, I need a face-to-face with the man
who runs Southern air transport

489
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,118
so I can clean up this mess.

490
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:31,460
Mr. Bob,

491
00:38:32,294 --> 00:38:35,130
I think we should walk before we run.

492
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:40,052
Everything will happen in the right time.

493
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,477
Mr. Mora, are you okay?

494
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:51,605
Dom, can you help us out here?

495
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:54,042
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right.

496
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:55,734
Mazuri help him out here a little bit.

497
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:57,903
I told him not to drink.
He has sugar in his blood.

498
00:38:57,986 --> 00:38:59,866
- Get him a nice cold washcloth.
- Right. Right.

499
00:38:59,947 --> 00:39:01,347
- Help him out.
- Are you all right?

500
00:39:06,954 --> 00:39:08,973
- Oh, Mora Sr. All right?
- Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

501
00:39:08,997 --> 00:39:10,123
He'll be down in a minute.

502
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,587
Get your hands off me!

503
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:40,362
Gonzalo, I cannot live
with Ospina touching me.

504
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:44,199
- Touching you?
- Yeah. He grabbed me.

505
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:49,162
- You find that funny?
- He likes you.

506
00:39:50,163 --> 00:39:51,498
- That's...
- Wow. No, listen,

507
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:54,418
actually Ospina's nickname
is la Mina, you know.

508
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:58,463
It means two things in Spanish.
Gold mine or land mine.

509
00:39:58,588 --> 00:39:59,881
With him you never know.

510
00:40:00,382 --> 00:40:04,928
But, my friend, a condition of
doing business with us is doing Ospina.

511
00:40:10,058 --> 00:40:13,145
Are you saying that
you want me to fuck Ospina?

512
00:40:13,228 --> 00:40:15,439
- Or have Ospina fuck me?
- Yeah.

513
00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:18,859
- To make a deal? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

514
00:40:19,526 --> 00:40:22,070
- He's our family, you know...
- Fuck that! There's no deal.

515
00:40:22,946 --> 00:40:26,408
- Okay, no deal. Okay, okay. Let's go.
- I'm out. No deal. Sorry.

516
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:28,331
- He'll take you anywhere you wanna go.
- Okay.

517
00:40:30,245 --> 00:40:31,496
Oh, shit.

518
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,457
Got you, man.

519
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,292
You son of a bitch.

520
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:37,419
- You son of a bitch.
- He's fucking with you.

521
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,273
- He came on to me...
- Did you know about this?

522
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:42,424
He came on to me, too. Fucking Maricén.

523
00:40:42,924 --> 00:40:44,217
But the cartel loves him.

524
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:46,762
He is the favorite son, Mr. Bob.

525
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,932
So, even if you see him fucking a goat,
which you might,

526
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:55,896
you must say,
"that's a fucking nice-looking goat, man."

527
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,541
I will keep my hands off you,

528
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:21,338
if you keep your eyes on my bosses' money.

529
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:26,259
The Mora's have staked
more than their reputation,

530
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:27,761
they have staked their lives.

531
00:41:30,013 --> 00:41:32,015
And yours, I'm afraid.

532
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:51,827
Let me remind you of something, Bobby,
all right.

533
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:54,663
You're a fucking poser, and so are you.

534
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,957
And that faggot out there...

535
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:59,084
You fuck this up, he'll kill you,

536
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,937
he'll kill your fucking wife,
and your two kids.

537
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:03,356
And do the same to this asshole here,
and then he's gonna kill me.

538
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,381
You understand?

539
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:07,342
- You understand?
- Yeah.

540
00:42:09,302 --> 00:42:10,762
Jesus Christ.

541
00:42:13,849 --> 00:42:15,475
<i>I will keep my hands off you,</i>

542
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:19,354
<i>if you keep your eyes on my bosses' money.</i>

543
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:22,774
<i>The Mora's have staked
more than their reputation,</i>

544
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:24,860
<i>they have staked their lives.</i>

545
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,820
<i>And yours, I'm afraid.</i>

546
00:42:28,864 --> 00:42:30,739
Idea of the month goes to Mazur.
Operation c-chase. Capital "c" for cash.

547
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,202
Idea of the month goes to Mazur.
Operation c-chase. Capital "c" for cash.

548
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:38,373
Washington wants to make c-chase
the biggest bust in us customs history.

549
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,460
These guys need no introduction.

550
00:42:41,668 --> 00:42:44,588
Pablo Escobar
and his little bitch, don Chepe.

551
00:42:45,922 --> 00:42:48,467
His top finance guy, Rudy Armbrecht.

552
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:53,597
And his main distributor, Roberto Alcaino.
Aka the jeweler.

553
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,056
Let's stop this poison.

554
00:42:55,182 --> 00:42:57,017
All right. Out, out, out. Everybody out.

555
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:58,226
Oh, oh, wait.

556
00:42:58,685 --> 00:43:01,980
You're all on administratively
uncontrollable overtime, so I own you.

557
00:43:02,105 --> 00:43:03,106
Out.

558
00:43:05,275 --> 00:43:07,277
Mazur, not so fast.

559
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:11,448
What?

560
00:43:11,531 --> 00:43:13,259
You stuck your foot in your mouth
with the Mora's.

561
00:43:13,283 --> 00:43:14,326
Ertz, get in here.

562
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:18,371
So, meet your soon-to-be wife.
Kathy Ertz, Bob Mazur.

563
00:43:18,455 --> 00:43:20,123
I wish you many happy years.

564
00:43:20,457 --> 00:43:21,917
- Hi.
- Hello.

565
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,585
Nice to meet you.

566
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:26,630
Um, Tischler asked me
to give you my profile.

567
00:43:28,048 --> 00:43:30,759
- One page?
- I'm not too complicated.

568
00:43:35,722 --> 00:43:38,767
Damn, I need a fiancée. Oh, shit.

569
00:43:42,604 --> 00:43:44,022
Hey, Bonni.

570
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,025
Bonni, wait up.

571
00:43:47,108 --> 00:43:50,237
Look, I know I invented a fiancee,
but I work better alone.

572
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,120
You think I have women lining up
around the block wanting to marry you?

573
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,911
- How many undercovers has she done?
- She's a virgin.

574
00:43:57,994 --> 00:43:59,329
On, my god.

575
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:01,581
Look, she's just window dressing.

576
00:44:02,123 --> 00:44:05,585
So is this. Compliments of
your government's impound authority.

577
00:44:06,086 --> 00:44:08,255
- Mercedes?
- It's who you know, Mazur.

578
00:44:09,005 --> 00:44:10,715
Now go out
and get to know whoever it takes

579
00:44:10,799 --> 00:44:12,599
to make me look like I
rubbed the right dick.

580
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:15,095
It's a metaphor.

581
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:21,768
Yes?

582
00:44:22,018 --> 00:44:25,480
<i>Mr. muse/ia,
it's Akbar Bilgrami</i>

583
00:44:25,855 --> 00:44:29,317
at <i>the Panama branch
from BCCI bank on line three.</i>

584
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:31,194
Okay, thank you.

585
00:44:35,949 --> 00:44:38,118
- This is Robert Musella.
- Mr. Musella.

586
00:44:38,577 --> 00:44:41,413
Akbar Bilgrami, BCCI, Panama, here.

587
00:44:41,496 --> 00:44:43,623
I see your accounts are quite active.

588
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:48,753
<i>- Is that</i> a <i>problem?
- No, no, quite the opposite.</i>

589
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,590
But we do have a problem
with two of your checks.

590
00:44:51,673 --> 00:44:53,341
Now, on one,

591
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:55,635
the payee is blank.

592
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:58,638
And on the other the amounts are different.

593
00:44:58,722 --> 00:44:59,806
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

594
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:01,349
<i>I'm not at my desk at the moment,</i>

595
00:45:01,516 --> 00:45:03,018
sol... I can't...

596
00:45:03,143 --> 00:45:07,063
Sir, in the future
I will manage this personally.

597
00:45:07,647 --> 00:45:10,984
We do this for our customers
who handle special clients.

598
00:45:11,526 --> 00:45:12,819
<i>Do you understand?</i>

599
00:45:13,528 --> 00:45:14,988
Yes, I think I do.

600
00:45:15,196 --> 00:45:18,366
<i>At BCCI, we're a full-service bank.</i>

601
00:45:19,367 --> 00:45:22,996
Mr. Bilgrami, as long as I have you
on the phone, I wonder if you can help me.

602
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:27,459
<i>Is there anyone on your team
who can help me here, in the states?</i>

603
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:33,340
I'm afraid that if not, I might have
to keep the money flow to a minimum.

604
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:40,472
Well, I'm sure our Miami execs could
assist you. Would you like to meet them?

605
00:45:42,515 --> 00:45:46,186
Yes. Yes, I think that
might be very helpful.

606
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,772
Mr. Palmer will arrange it.

607
00:45:50,065 --> 00:45:53,443
Well, thank you very much.
You've been most kind. Goodbye.

608
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:02,994
<i>In the future
I will manage this personally.</i>

609
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:06,790
<i>We do this for our customers
who handle special clients.</i>

610
00:46:06,873 --> 00:46:08,208
<i>Do you understand?</i>

611
00:46:17,759 --> 00:46:19,487
It's so nice to have you in Miami,
Mr. Musella.

612
00:46:19,511 --> 00:46:20,512
Thanks.

613
00:46:20,595 --> 00:46:22,430
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

614
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:26,893
This is Mr. Awan,
president of our north American division.

615
00:46:26,976 --> 00:46:28,269
Hi, Bob Musella.

616
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:31,064
And Mr. Bilgrami,
who you've spoken with on the phone.

617
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:32,941
Head of our Latin American division.

618
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,152
We are a very important institution,
Mr. Musella,

619
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:38,279
in America and worldwide.

620
00:46:38,947 --> 00:46:40,865
We are owned
by middle eastern businessmen

621
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:42,951
with very strong ties to your government.

622
00:46:43,284 --> 00:46:44,744
Your money is safe with us.

623
00:46:45,453 --> 00:46:46,955
That's what I wanna hear

624
00:46:47,747 --> 00:46:50,875
because my clients are businessmen, too,
like yourselves,

625
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:53,712
only their business is selling cocaine.

626
00:47:00,176 --> 00:47:01,928
Could you excuse us for a moment, please?

627
00:47:02,512 --> 00:47:03,596
Of course.

628
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:05,909
Mr. Ian Howard
is one of our BCCI European executive.

629
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:09,078
Mr. Bilgrami and Mr. Awan
have taken good care of you?

630
00:48:10,205 --> 00:48:12,332
Yes, yes. Excellent.

631
00:48:12,499 --> 00:48:15,585
Good. Because BCCI is a reputable bank.

632
00:48:18,505 --> 00:48:20,548
Look, I assure you...

633
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:22,926
No, no. No assurances from you.
Only from us.

634
00:48:24,511 --> 00:48:25,970
Please, take a seat.

635
00:48:32,811 --> 00:48:36,815
We buy gold or diamonds,
keep them in our secure vaults

636
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:40,068
or we could send your money to Paris
or our headquarters in London,

637
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:42,195
other banks around the globe,

638
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,572
deposit it, wire transfer to Panama.

639
00:48:45,406 --> 00:48:49,577
We like to be nimble with our
clients' cash. How does that sound?

640
00:48:51,704 --> 00:48:53,623
Sounds like I came to the right bank.

641
00:49:59,898 --> 00:50:03,818
<i>Illegal cocaine is coming into our country
at alarming levels...</i>

642
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:05,570
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?

643
00:50:06,863 --> 00:50:08,656
- I'm being followed.
- What?

644
00:50:08,823 --> 00:50:11,326
- You got the plate?
- Yeah, I did.

645
00:50:11,451 --> 00:50:13,244
Here, here. I'll handle it.

646
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:18,207
- You all right?
- Fine.

647
00:50:19,792 --> 00:50:21,628
I'm fine. Let's do this.

648
00:50:21,711 --> 00:50:23,564
Okay, here we go.
Let's play this newlywed game.

649
00:50:23,588 --> 00:50:26,591
All right, Kathy, what do you know
about your handsome fiancé Bob?

650
00:50:26,674 --> 00:50:27,675
Favorite drink?

651
00:50:27,884 --> 00:50:31,262
- He's a whiskey kind of guy.
- And she's a Manhattan girl.

652
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,140
All right, that was too damn easy.
All right. Food she hates?

653
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:37,852
- Uh... yogurt.
- No. I love yogurt.

654
00:50:37,936 --> 00:50:40,438
- I thought you said you hated yogurt?
- I hate sour cream.

655
00:50:40,521 --> 00:50:42,607
- And mayonnaise.
- Sour cream and mayonnaise. Noted.

656
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,026
Perfect. You already sound like
a married couple.

657
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:47,862
- All right, favorite sport?
- Uh, she loves tennis.

658
00:50:47,946 --> 00:50:49,364
Football. The Bucs.

659
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:51,908
Season tickets on the 20-yard line.

660
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:54,202
Damn, woman, you're good.
Look at that memory.

661
00:50:54,369 --> 00:50:55,703
All right, how'd you meet?

662
00:50:56,037 --> 00:50:57,080
We were friends.

663
00:50:57,163 --> 00:50:59,248
I was trying to fix him up
with a friend of mine,

664
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:00,708
he was trying to do the same.

665
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:04,921
And then love struck and we were thinking,
"what are we doing?"

666
00:51:05,254 --> 00:51:06,673
And we cut out the middleman.

667
00:51:07,006 --> 00:51:08,967
Wait, that's how you met
your wife, isn't it?

668
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:11,886
It is. Stay close to the truth,
makes it easier to lie.

669
00:51:12,595 --> 00:51:14,931
- Strangest sexual position?
- Hmm. What?

670
00:51:15,014 --> 00:51:16,867
All right, I'll let you slide on that.
I'll let...

671
00:51:16,891 --> 00:51:18,851
Yeah, right, Bob,
how many times you been in love?

672
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:20,979
Just once.

673
00:51:23,398 --> 00:51:24,500
You never let me play with it.

674
00:51:24,524 --> 00:51:25,524
You always say that.

675
00:51:25,566 --> 00:51:27,169
- I'm always playing.
- But whenever I wanna play...

676
00:51:27,193 --> 00:51:28,403
Hey.

677
00:51:29,445 --> 00:51:31,072
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

678
00:51:35,743 --> 00:51:37,495
Hey.

679
00:51:37,578 --> 00:51:38,871
You look great.

680
00:51:44,752 --> 00:51:46,587
- Are you finished, ma'am?
- Yes, thank you.

681
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,008
- How did you like your swordfish?
- It was good.

682
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:51,092
Yeah?

683
00:51:52,427 --> 00:51:53,678
Thank you.

684
00:51:54,053 --> 00:51:56,848
Can you believe this,
put us way in the back here?

685
00:51:56,931 --> 00:52:00,035
I don't... they can't put us further back.
We're, like, in Alaska or something.

686
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:02,687
Bob, we didn't have a reservation.
It's fine.

687
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:03,855
It's not fine.

688
00:52:03,938 --> 00:52:06,691
There were three or four tables
that were empty on our way back here.

689
00:52:06,774 --> 00:52:07,775
Did you notice that?

690
00:52:07,942 --> 00:52:11,195
- It's fine. Really.
- It matters. It's a special occasion.

691
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:13,322
- I know.
- And I want it to be special, okay.

692
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:20,121
I'm just wondering
where my little Bobby the accountant went?

693
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:22,665
- Nowhere, I'm right here.
- Kinda liked him.

694
00:52:22,915 --> 00:52:26,210
Hey. Kinda like you.
You look beautiful tonight, by the way.

695
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:29,922
I have never seen you with a pocket scarf.

696
00:52:30,173 --> 00:52:31,799
- You like that?
- No, I hate it.

697
00:52:31,883 --> 00:52:34,260
- You hate it? It's a special occasion.
- Yeah.

698
00:52:34,343 --> 00:52:35,887
You're starting to look like them.

699
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:42,643
Mr. Bob, you are practically
in the fucking toilets.

700
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:45,188
- Tell them who you are.
- Tell me about it.

701
00:52:45,271 --> 00:52:47,315
I give the guy a 20, I
still end up back here.

702
00:52:47,648 --> 00:52:50,985
- Gonzalo, I'd like to introduce you to...
- She's your beautiful fiancée.

703
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:54,864
Well, no, actually,
this is my secretary, Evelyn.

704
00:52:55,531 --> 00:52:57,700
This is Gonzalo Mora Sr.

705
00:52:58,326 --> 00:53:01,245
She is the best secretary
I have ever had in my life.

706
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:03,664
She types faster than you fart, my friend.

707
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,833
Listen, why don't you join us? Join us.

708
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:09,003
Hey, pal.
Your best bottle of champagne, please.

709
00:53:09,087 --> 00:53:13,508
Here we go. Have a seat.
We are celebrating tonight.

710
00:53:13,674 --> 00:53:15,802
It is Evelyn's birthday.

711
00:53:15,885 --> 00:53:18,054
Speak of the devil, here it is.
Look at that.

712
00:53:18,137 --> 00:53:19,847
Look at the size of that fucking cake.

713
00:53:20,181 --> 00:53:21,766
Whoa, whoa. Hang on, hang on.

714
00:53:22,141 --> 00:53:24,852
- This says "happy anniversary."
- Yes, sir.

715
00:53:24,936 --> 00:53:28,189
- I ordered a birthday cake.
- No, sir, you said it was an anniversary.

716
00:53:28,314 --> 00:53:29,649
Whoa. Excuse me. What?

717
00:53:29,732 --> 00:53:31,612
Why would I say it's my...
I'm not even married.

718
00:53:31,692 --> 00:53:34,338
- Why would I order an anniversary cake?
- I thought it was an anniversary...

719
00:53:34,362 --> 00:53:36,864
Now you're fucking this up.
What are you, a moron or something?

720
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:39,367
- Bob, it's okay.
- It's not okay.

721
00:53:39,826 --> 00:53:41,577
We pay top dollar coming in here

722
00:53:41,869 --> 00:53:44,038
for good food and good service
and we got neither.

723
00:53:44,372 --> 00:53:48,543
Except I get this motherfucker
telling me that I'm a liar?

724
00:53:49,377 --> 00:53:51,980
- You calling me a liar again?
- No, sir, I'm not calling you a liar.

725
00:53:52,004 --> 00:53:53,107
- You're not calling me a liar?
- No.

726
00:53:53,131 --> 00:53:56,342
But you said that I told you
that I wanted an anniversary cake.

727
00:53:56,425 --> 00:53:57,426
Sir, I'm sorry.

728
00:53:57,593 --> 00:53:59,470
We have to understand something,
you and me.

729
00:53:59,554 --> 00:54:01,031
- You can read? All right.
- I can read, sir.

730
00:54:01,055 --> 00:54:05,476
When I look at this cake
it says to me, "happy anniversary."

731
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,644
What does it say to you?

732
00:54:08,271 --> 00:54:10,711
It says, "happy anniversary!"
"Happy anniversary," doesn't it?

733
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,401
- Stop!
- Get that fucking thing away from me!

734
00:54:14,068 --> 00:54:15,611
Jesus.

735
00:54:15,695 --> 00:54:17,196
What the hell's wrong with you?

736
00:54:33,796 --> 00:54:35,548
I'm sorry, Ev.

737
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:46,267
That was the most degrading, vicious,

738
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,978
disgusting thing I have ever seen you do.

739
00:54:49,061 --> 00:54:51,147
I know. I'm sorry.

740
00:54:54,442 --> 00:54:56,360
I never wanted you to see that.

741
00:55:08,456 --> 00:55:09,624
So, what's she like?

742
00:55:11,626 --> 00:55:12,877
Who?

743
00:55:15,296 --> 00:55:16,839
<i>“Who?“</i>

744
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:22,303
I hardly know her.

745
00:55:53,459 --> 00:55:56,712
<i>Bob, I checked out
that license plate you gave me.</i>

746
00:55:56,837 --> 00:55:59,048
<i>Luckily your stalker
and I got the same taste.</i>

747
00:55:59,173 --> 00:56:00,317
<i>Wait a minute? You found him?</i>

748
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:03,219
<i>Listen, emir, follow protocol, please.
No antics.</i>

749
00:56:03,302 --> 00:56:04,804
Just relax, all right.

750
00:56:05,012 --> 00:56:07,032
I got close enough to know that
he didn't smell like a perp.

751
00:56:07,056 --> 00:56:08,576
He had that familiar government scent.

752
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:13,312
- So, where are you from?
- Kansas.

753
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:41,444
Who the fuck
are you working for? Huh?

754
00:56:41,966 --> 00:56:43,509
Who do you work for, motherfucker?

755
00:56:46,887 --> 00:56:48,014
Shit.

756
00:56:50,016 --> 00:56:51,017
Oh, shit.

757
00:56:59,442 --> 00:57:02,403
Hey, that license number
you gave emir, I searched it.

758
00:57:02,903 --> 00:57:05,048
Took me a while
'cause the car's registered to a company

759
00:57:05,072 --> 00:57:06,449
with an address on a vacant lot.

760
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,245
The property records tie back to
what I've confirmed as a CIA front.

761
00:57:12,163 --> 00:57:14,832
- Emir was right. Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

762
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:17,084
Here, take the tapes.

763
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:21,714
Ospina authorized pickups
in Detroit, la, Houston and New York.

764
00:57:21,964 --> 00:57:23,591
- He bought in?
- Yeah, he bought in.

765
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:25,885
In a big way.

766
00:57:28,637 --> 00:57:30,139
You okay, Bob?

767
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:34,101
- You don't seem yourself.
- You wanna talk to the psychologist?

768
00:57:35,144 --> 00:57:37,146
- No, I'm fine.
- Just wanna make sure you're okay.

769
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:39,899
- What, I'm fine.
- Okay.

770
00:57:44,737 --> 00:57:46,423
Come on. Come on, baby.
Come on, number two.

771
00:57:46,447 --> 00:57:48,282
Come on, number two.
Come on, number two.

772
00:57:48,407 --> 00:57:50,785
Come on, baby. Come on.

773
00:57:51,118 --> 00:57:54,497
Come on, come on, run god damn it.
Run, run, run.

774
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:57,625
Come on, baby. Come on.
Come on, come on.

775
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:59,168
Come on, come on, come on.

776
00:58:00,086 --> 00:58:02,797
Yes, yes, yes. Come on, baby.

777
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:05,549
Ah, shit.

778
00:58:09,095 --> 00:58:12,014
Never trust an animal
without a jockey on its back.

779
00:58:12,098 --> 00:58:14,183
Who is there to fix the goddamn race?

780
00:58:15,518 --> 00:58:17,436
I've got a tip in the fifth.

781
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,522
You got a tip, huh? Who from, the mutt?

782
00:58:20,689 --> 00:58:21,857
No.

783
00:58:23,401 --> 00:58:24,777
Ospina.

784
00:58:27,238 --> 00:58:29,824
It's a nice-looking ring.
What's that, a Coca leaf?

785
00:58:31,492 --> 00:58:35,079
You know, most of the assholes I meet
think it's a maple leaf.

786
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:42,378
My paperwork for Southern air transport
has to be in place.

787
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:46,132
In order to do that we need to make it
look like I manage your money.

788
00:58:46,215 --> 00:58:48,884
Listen, friend, I never
fuck on the first date.

789
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:51,846
Evening, ladies.

790
00:58:53,013 --> 00:58:56,725
Walmart on every block.
Smack dab in milk and honey land.

791
00:58:58,227 --> 00:59:00,146
America the beautiful.

792
00:59:00,229 --> 00:59:03,691
Only we don't get to the see the filth
on the other side of the store.

793
00:59:04,483 --> 00:59:06,277
The sewage of civilization.

794
00:59:06,402 --> 00:59:10,114
Hell, man, if it wasn't for the churches,
this whole fucking place would just die.

795
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:14,285
You know, the good book?
It says, "don't steal, don't lie."

796
00:59:14,368 --> 00:59:16,036
Well, who's that written for?

797
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:20,666
You know, we pray for a good clean life,
a list of do's or don't's,

798
00:59:20,749 --> 00:59:23,002
and we act like animals. All of us.

799
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:27,631
And Nancy Reagan with her holier-than-thou
"just say no to drugs" bullshit.

800
00:59:27,715 --> 00:59:29,800
Ronny, you know,
he should've stayed the gipper.

801
00:59:29,884 --> 00:59:31,524
He's nothing but a two-faced drug pusher.

802
00:59:32,386 --> 00:59:35,097
Whatever happened to good old integrity?

803
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:40,478
Do you think that half homo Ospina
knows what's coming? Good luck.

804
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:44,732
You, me and every other prick
is sucking on the tit of that golden calf.

805
01:00:43,832 --> 01:00:46,186
<i>Now listen to me.
If one of those bullets was meant for you,</i>

806
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,854
<i>I wouldn't be talking to you now, would I?</i>

807
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:49,088
<i>Look, Dominic, I...</i>

808
01:00:49,171 --> 01:00:50,923
<i>- Who sent you, Ospina?
- No.</i>

809
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:53,884
<i>- Was it that fucking Mora kid?
- No, no, I went on my own.</i>

810
01:00:54,134 --> 01:00:57,346
<i>Jesus, Bob, you sprung me out
of jail to watch your back,</i>

811
01:00:57,429 --> 01:00:59,306
<i>and now look at you, you're waist-deep.</i>

812
01:01:00,432 --> 01:01:03,477
<i>- You having fun without me?
- No.</i>

813
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:06,748
<i>Now, listen to me,
they're fucking meeting tonight.</i>

814
01:01:06,772 --> 01:01:10,067
<i>- It never happened, do you hear me?
- Okay, it never happened.</i>

815
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:11,390
<i>Bobby, say it like you mean it.</i>

816
01:01:12,486 --> 01:01:17,408
I mean, that it never happened.

817
01:01:38,012 --> 01:01:42,016
<i>Do you think
that I'm doing</i> a <i>good job for you?</i>

818
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,767
<i>Excellent.</i>

819
01:01:46,061 --> 01:01:48,397
Then why don't you do right for me?

820
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:53,402
You know that I'm only protected
if more people buy in.

821
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:59,033
You promised to extend our network
if I delivered. And I have.

822
01:01:59,575 --> 01:02:00,826
Boss...

823
01:02:03,704 --> 01:02:07,124
If you can't convince your bosses
to meet with me,

824
01:02:09,168 --> 01:02:11,378
then our arrangement is over.

825
01:02:12,379 --> 01:02:16,091
Mr. Bob, the drug business
is a waiting game.

826
01:02:16,342 --> 01:02:17,551
I know.

827
01:02:18,177 --> 01:02:21,388
I've been trying
to teach this man some Patience.

828
01:02:21,555 --> 01:02:24,058
Your fiancée is a very wise woman.

829
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:27,561
And if I may be so bold,
incredibly ravishing.

830
01:02:28,687 --> 01:02:33,567
So, I think I will Grant you the meeting.

831
01:02:35,402 --> 01:02:38,113
We have reached
a point of no return, Mr. Bob.

832
01:02:39,448 --> 01:02:41,283
Have a great evening.

833
01:03:16,068 --> 01:03:18,070
Mr. Musella, it's time.

834
01:03:32,459 --> 01:03:33,919
Go forward.

835
01:03:42,761 --> 01:03:46,306
So, you are Robert Musella?

836
01:03:48,434 --> 01:03:49,601
Lam.

837
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:52,563
And you are?

838
01:03:53,439 --> 01:03:54,773
This way.

839
01:03:57,192 --> 01:03:58,694
<i>Go to Padrino.</i>

840
01:04:40,903 --> 01:04:43,030
- What is your name?
- Joshua baron.

841
01:05:30,744 --> 01:05:32,246
What is your name, sir?

842
01:05:35,874 --> 01:05:37,251
Your name?

843
01:05:38,085 --> 01:05:39,586
Robert Musella.

844
01:06:06,738 --> 01:06:09,533
Eshu Elegué is protecting you today.
You're good.

845
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,243
You are free to go.

846
01:06:11,326 --> 01:06:13,662
Get up. You can leave. Get up.

847
01:06:14,413 --> 01:06:15,581
Now.

848
01:06:29,469 --> 01:06:32,347
It was an audition. You got the part.

849
01:06:54,494 --> 01:06:56,496
Be ready in five minutes.

850
01:07:27,819 --> 01:07:29,154
I was...

851
01:07:34,868 --> 01:07:38,705
So, Mr. Musella, what can you do for me?

852
01:07:40,874 --> 01:07:42,518
So, how do you feel
about the stock market?

853
01:07:42,542 --> 01:07:44,753
No, no, too risky.

854
01:07:44,836 --> 01:07:46,421
It's like going to Vegas.

855
01:07:46,505 --> 01:07:49,383
We like to take, not to be taken.

856
01:07:49,466 --> 01:07:53,679
Well, if you place funds
that are earmarked for investments

857
01:07:53,762 --> 01:07:57,057
into one of my firms here in New York,

858
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:59,142
we can split the fees evenly.

859
01:07:59,226 --> 01:08:03,271
Or, you can simply put your money
into one of my mortgage accounts...

860
01:08:03,355 --> 01:08:04,523
Oh, hey, hey.

861
01:08:05,273 --> 01:08:09,528
See, that way, it'll look like a loan
and then you just use the loan proceeds.

862
01:08:09,611 --> 01:08:11,989
Now, there's a number of ways
that we can make this work.

863
01:08:12,072 --> 01:08:13,281
Wait till you meet her.

864
01:08:13,365 --> 01:08:14,825
Hello, sweetheart.

865
01:08:16,868 --> 01:08:18,829
Watch this, Bobby, and learn.

866
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:22,833
- Roberto Alcaino, this is my aunt Vicky.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

867
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:26,128
- Mr. Alcaino...
- Call me Roberto, please.

868
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:29,506
Well, I love being
on a first-name basis with a gentleman.

869
01:08:30,257 --> 01:08:31,341
Come on.

870
01:08:31,425 --> 01:08:35,012
I love this park. It's my playground.

871
01:08:35,095 --> 01:08:37,139
See those buildings over there?

872
01:08:37,222 --> 01:08:38,265
They're mine.

873
01:08:39,099 --> 01:08:41,977
The one on the right's a piece of shit,
but I can't flip it.

874
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,022
And the other one, Bobby and I just sold.
For how much, Bobby?

875
01:08:45,105 --> 01:08:47,190
Oh, my god.
We made a lot of money on that one.

876
01:08:47,274 --> 01:08:50,569
Actually a shitload of zeros
starting with the number 8.

877
01:08:50,652 --> 01:08:52,029
But I hate to brag.

878
01:08:54,156 --> 01:08:56,867
Oh, my nephew here
is in charge of the finances.

879
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:58,785
Yeah.
Bob has a real nose for business.

880
01:08:58,869 --> 01:09:00,120
And women.

881
01:09:00,203 --> 01:09:03,248
Well, thank you. I've always
had a thing for Latinos.

882
01:09:03,957 --> 01:09:06,043
So, you want an apartment?

883
01:09:06,126 --> 01:09:07,711
Ooh! Here comes the close.

884
01:09:07,794 --> 01:09:09,254
Well, I do have a place upstate,

885
01:09:09,337 --> 01:09:12,049
but my wife is thinking
about an apartment in New York.

886
01:09:12,132 --> 01:09:14,843
If you're interested,
I can set that up for you, no problem.

887
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:18,555
Okay, Kathy,
time to go, spend some money.

888
01:09:18,638 --> 01:09:19,639
- Hmm?
- Yes.

889
01:09:20,682 --> 01:09:24,811
It was so lovely to meet you
and I cannot wait to meet your wife.

890
01:09:24,978 --> 01:09:27,731
I mean it.
I wanna have dinner, the sooner the better.

891
01:09:27,814 --> 01:09:29,649
- I would like that.
- All right.

892
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:33,236
Listen, escort these
lovely ladies to the car, please.

893
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,030
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

894
01:09:35,113 --> 01:09:36,573
- Have a good time.
- All right.

895
01:09:36,656 --> 01:09:37,824
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

896
01:09:37,908 --> 01:09:39,951
- Bye.
- Are we gonna go to Neiman's?

897
01:09:41,453 --> 01:09:45,082
Your aunt reminds me of my Tia Inez,
a wild horse,

898
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:48,627
- a breath of fresh air in a cruel world.
- Hmm.

899
01:09:50,253 --> 01:09:52,672
And I thought she was one of a kind.

900
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:56,885
You know, I'm thinking about
financing and promoting a boxing match.

901
01:09:57,052 --> 01:09:58,053
Ooh!

902
01:09:58,887 --> 01:09:59,971
That's very risky business.

903
01:10:00,055 --> 01:10:02,182
Or maybe
a shipping company in Buenos Aires.

904
01:10:02,265 --> 01:10:04,851
Or a beach house.

905
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:07,145
Now that I can help you make happen.

906
01:10:09,022 --> 01:10:10,607
Are you and Kathy free tonight?

907
01:10:11,858 --> 01:10:14,152
Yeah, as far as I know,
we're free as birds.

908
01:10:20,659 --> 01:10:21,993
Cheers.

909
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:24,830
Can I ask you a question?

910
01:10:26,248 --> 01:10:28,333
Have you ever had your palm read?

911
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:37,759
Well, my wife Gloria believes in it,
but, sad to say, I am more of a skeptic.

912
01:10:37,843 --> 01:10:42,389
Well, my father was a diplomat,
so we traveled a lot,

913
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:45,183
and this one time in India,

914
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:49,563
a yogi came to visit us
and he taught me how to read the future.

915
01:10:50,063 --> 01:10:51,064
Oh...

916
01:10:51,898 --> 01:10:52,899
May I?

917
01:10:56,236 --> 01:10:57,237
Please.

918
01:11:00,907 --> 01:11:02,784
Mmm... oh, wow.

919
01:11:04,077 --> 01:11:05,287
Interesting.

920
01:11:12,711 --> 01:11:14,129
Is there a problem?

921
01:11:15,922 --> 01:11:20,468
No, I've just never seen quite
so many stars align at the fate line.

922
01:11:24,264 --> 01:11:27,058
- Okay.
- It's more than okay.

923
01:11:27,726 --> 01:11:31,104
It means destiny
has marked you for success.

924
01:11:34,441 --> 01:11:35,609
Well, I like that.

925
01:11:38,445 --> 01:11:40,447
- It's so beautiful.
- It is.

926
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:43,700
It is Roberto's favorite painting
in our New York home.

927
01:11:43,783 --> 01:11:45,243
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

928
01:11:45,327 --> 01:11:47,370
Kathy was an art major in college.

929
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:52,959
I remember Sotheby's was
selling this to a private collector.

930
01:11:54,127 --> 01:11:55,754
Is there anything I can do?

931
01:11:56,213 --> 01:11:59,049
My husband loves to be in charge,
even in the kitchen.

932
01:11:59,132 --> 01:12:00,842
Really? You hear that?

933
01:12:03,136 --> 01:12:04,429
I'm sleeping at Amy's.

934
01:12:04,512 --> 01:12:05,680
See you later.

935
01:12:07,307 --> 01:12:09,768
Not until you say hi, we have company.

936
01:12:09,851 --> 01:12:12,395
Kathy, Bob, this is our daughter Bianca.

937
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:13,873
- Hi, Bianca, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

938
01:12:13,897 --> 01:12:14,898
Hi.

939
01:12:35,293 --> 01:12:38,505
- But of course.
- How many languages does she speak?

940
01:12:41,174 --> 01:12:42,300
- Four.
- Four.

941
01:12:42,384 --> 01:12:45,345
Well, if you
count pig Latin as a language, but...

942
01:12:49,015 --> 01:12:50,475
Kathy, I wanna show you something.

943
01:12:54,229 --> 01:12:55,814
Your fiancée is remarkable.

944
01:12:55,897 --> 01:12:57,107
Yeah, she is.

945
01:12:58,316 --> 01:13:02,070
I got to tell you, I would have been a
chef, but America put me in this business.

946
01:13:02,737 --> 01:13:04,048
It's their fault I'm not wearing an apron,

947
01:13:04,072 --> 01:13:06,324
sweating my balls off
in some kitchen somewhere.

948
01:13:07,075 --> 01:13:09,869
But no demand, no supply.

949
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:12,872
And there are a lot of folks with noses.

950
01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:16,251
God gave us free will,
so who am I to stand in the way

951
01:13:16,334 --> 01:13:20,005
of someone who wants to indulge
in self-destructive behavior.

952
01:13:21,423 --> 01:13:23,258
- Salud.
- Oh, thank you.

953
01:13:23,341 --> 01:13:26,469
The politicians think it's a drug war,

954
01:13:26,553 --> 01:13:30,265
shoot them up, <i>dirty</i> Harry,
but I say it's a business like any other.

955
01:13:30,348 --> 01:13:33,226
Profits up, people come,
profits down, they leave,

956
01:13:33,351 --> 01:13:34,894
by any means necessary.

957
01:13:36,146 --> 01:13:39,858
The only difference is, in my business,

958
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:44,446
nothing good ever comes
in the absence of trust.

959
01:13:46,906 --> 01:13:48,742
Without it there is no loyalty.

960
01:13:49,409 --> 01:13:53,246
<i>And when there is no loyalty,
it never ends well.</i>

961
01:13:55,248 --> 01:13:58,585
It's actually amazing
how much these little things pick up, huh?

962
01:13:59,419 --> 01:14:00,503
Isn't it?

963
01:14:01,296 --> 01:14:05,425
Hey, I wanted to tell you,
you were pretty good today.

964
01:14:06,968 --> 01:14:08,053
Thanks.

965
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:11,264
Yeah, well, you're here because of me,

966
01:14:12,349 --> 01:14:14,976
and I feel responsible for your safety.

967
01:14:15,769 --> 01:14:16,936
I appreciate that.

968
01:14:18,271 --> 01:14:19,606
You don't have to worry about me.

969
01:14:22,567 --> 01:14:23,860
I'm a big girl.

970
01:14:28,323 --> 01:14:30,617
It's not about that, it's...

971
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:35,747
One wrong word, one slip and...

972
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:41,669
We have to be very careful.

973
01:14:48,134 --> 01:14:51,137
We got into the Alcaino house, though.

974
01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:52,305
That was all you.

975
01:14:53,431 --> 01:14:56,393
Studied the family,
found out about the aunt.

976
01:14:58,228 --> 01:14:59,813
Speaking of aunt...

977
01:15:02,982 --> 01:15:03,983
What was that?

978
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:06,319
I thought my aunt Vicky
was a little over the top.

979
01:15:07,278 --> 01:15:10,115
I mean, academy award performance.

980
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:11,950
"I love Latin men."

981
01:15:14,285 --> 01:15:16,454
The headpiece like this.

982
01:15:16,538 --> 01:15:18,832
- You sure about that?
- I don't know.

983
01:15:19,707 --> 01:15:21,918
Kathy, I really love your engagement ring.

984
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:23,378
It is so special to me.

985
01:15:23,461 --> 01:15:25,964
It's been in Bob's family
for over 100 years.

986
01:15:26,047 --> 01:15:27,048
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

987
01:15:28,216 --> 01:15:30,677
- Anyways, should we go?
- Yeah, let's do it.

988
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:31,761
Right.

989
01:15:31,845 --> 01:15:35,140
Bob, I'm taking Kathy to buy some flowers.

990
01:15:35,598 --> 01:15:37,350
Hey,
what's that flower you didn't like?

991
01:15:37,434 --> 01:15:40,854
Lilies, because they remind me
of my grandmother's...

992
01:15:40,937 --> 01:15:42,605
Grandmother's funeral, that's right.

993
01:15:42,689 --> 01:15:44,441
- No lilies then.
- Please.

994
01:15:45,191 --> 01:15:46,943
All right. See you later.

995
01:15:47,026 --> 01:15:49,612
- Bye, honey. All right, have a good time.
- Bye.

996
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,452
How lucky are we?

997
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:58,288
<i>He used to smuggle drugs.
Then he got caught</i>

998
01:15:58,371 --> 01:16:00,915
<i>and he became one of the government's
most valuable informants</i>

999
01:16:00,999 --> 01:16:02,876
<i>in the war against cocaine.</i>

1000
01:16:02,959 --> 01:16:06,379
<i>But Barry seal's enemies
caught up with him and killed him.</i>

1001
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:08,715
<i>Tonight, three men are in custody.</i>

1002
01:16:08,798 --> 01:16:10,049
<i>NBC's Brian Ross reports</i>

1003
01:16:10,133 --> 01:16:13,553
<i>that seal was about to
testify for the government once again.</i>

1004
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,555
<i>Authorities believe
machine-gun killing</i>

1005
01:16:15,638 --> 01:16:17,974
<i>of top drug informant Barry seal</i>

1006
01:16:18,057 --> 01:16:21,144
<i>was ordered by drug bosses
in Medellin, Colombia,</i>

1007
01:16:21,227 --> 01:16:23,146
<i>who sent five men to kill seal.</i>

1008
01:16:24,772 --> 01:16:26,900
You know, that son of a
bitch was my friend.

1009
01:16:28,401 --> 01:16:32,572
He prayed with me, he sat at my table
with my wife and ate my food.

1010
01:16:35,575 --> 01:16:37,577
I wasted my knives on the meat.

1011
01:16:39,787 --> 01:16:41,414
I gave him this ring.

1012
01:16:42,415 --> 01:16:43,917
Made only two of them.

1013
01:16:45,627 --> 01:16:49,047
You should have
ripped it off that motherfucker's finger.

1014
01:16:55,595 --> 01:16:59,390
Looks like I will have to be more careful
about who I give jewelry to.

1015
01:17:50,233 --> 01:17:54,153
I'm risking my life
for pennies, man. 250 won't cut it.

1016
01:17:54,779 --> 01:17:57,031
Come on, you knew that was the deal.
That's the Max.

1017
01:17:57,115 --> 01:17:59,158
You want more money,
get a fucking law degree.

1018
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,579
- No, no, man.
- No?

1019
01:18:02,662 --> 01:18:04,789
- It's not like that.
- So, what is it like?

1020
01:18:06,165 --> 01:18:07,917
You pay me or I rat.

1021
01:18:09,085 --> 01:18:13,214
I'll fucking tell them
you're a piece of shit...

1022
01:18:13,298 --> 01:18:16,718
I can't believe that Bob
warned me about you, you know that?

1023
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:19,521
I should've listened to him.
I'm such a fucking idiot, the fucking...

1024
01:18:21,681 --> 01:18:24,684
You shut your fucking mouth.
You fuck this up and I swear to god...

1025
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,103
What the fuck is going on?
You two coming in or what?

1026
01:18:27,186 --> 01:18:28,229
Yeah, yeah.

1027
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:35,194
Shut the fuck up and follow my lead.

1028
01:18:52,545 --> 01:18:54,589
- Who's your friend over here?
- He's family.

1029
01:18:54,881 --> 01:18:56,841
You got some ugly family, man.

1030
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:03,598
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with him.

1031
01:19:04,432 --> 01:19:06,577
- I got a problem with you, man.
- You don't got a problem.

1032
01:19:06,601 --> 01:19:08,912
- I got a problem with you.
- You don't have a problem with me, man.

1033
01:19:08,936 --> 01:19:10,021
You don't have a problem.

1034
01:19:10,104 --> 01:19:11,314
- No?
- No.

1035
01:19:11,397 --> 01:19:14,901
- It stinks in here like a fucking pig.
- Now you're talking shit.

1036
01:19:19,155 --> 01:19:21,467
What's this fucking shit you saying?
Nobody believes a word you're...

1037
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:22,533
This is a fucking cop!

1038
01:19:28,539 --> 01:19:30,500
This is a fucking cop, man.

1039
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:32,335
Shut up! Shut up!

1040
01:19:32,418 --> 01:19:34,063
Come on,
you don't believe this fucking asshole...

1041
01:19:34,087 --> 01:19:36,172
What's going on here now? Tell me.

1042
01:19:36,255 --> 01:19:37,495
He's fucking robbing from us...

1043
01:19:37,715 --> 01:19:40,593
- This is a fuckin' cop.
- I'm telling you.

1044
01:19:50,144 --> 01:19:51,771
I'm going to kill you, man.

1045
01:19:54,899 --> 01:19:57,860
- I'm gonna kill you, man. Fucking idiot.
- You're going to kill me?

1046
01:19:57,944 --> 01:20:01,197
Okay. Yeah? I don't have anything, man.

1047
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,800
- Come on, turn around...
- This is a fucking cop!

1048
01:20:02,824 --> 01:20:04,534
The money's right there. There you go.

1049
01:20:04,617 --> 01:20:06,536
I don't have anything.

1050
01:20:06,619 --> 01:20:07,620
- Whoa. Whoops.
- Fuck.

1051
01:20:07,704 --> 01:20:09,163
What is that? Green shit?

1052
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:15,545
This is your fucking money!

1053
01:20:16,629 --> 01:20:17,880
Fucking asshole!

1054
01:20:17,964 --> 01:20:20,550
I'm so scared of you
with your dick hanging out like that.

1055
01:20:21,509 --> 01:20:22,635
Bang!

1056
01:20:29,434 --> 01:20:30,893
I love you, man.

1057
01:20:35,481 --> 01:20:38,109
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me? Then fuck me. Oh, yeah.

1058
01:20:38,192 --> 01:20:40,653
- Fuck you.
- To fucking me.

1059
01:20:41,696 --> 01:20:43,990
You know, I really like you, man.

1060
01:20:44,073 --> 01:20:47,452
Because the only thing I care about
is money.

1061
01:20:56,919 --> 01:20:58,254
Oh, fuck.

1062
01:21:13,895 --> 01:21:16,814
<i>There's a cut
on the forehead of sugar baby Rojas...</i>

1063
01:21:16,898 --> 01:21:18,858
Move, move. Hit him, you son of a bitch.

1064
01:21:20,359 --> 01:21:22,528
- I told you, no?
- He looks good.

1065
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:37,919
Whoa, whoa.

1066
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:40,213
- See?
- He nailed him there. Wow!

1067
01:21:40,755 --> 01:21:42,298
<i>The champion got the worst of it.</i>

1068
01:21:50,139 --> 01:21:52,433
Dear father in heaven,

1069
01:21:52,517 --> 01:21:54,352
we were cursed tonight.

1070
01:21:55,478 --> 01:21:57,730
Colombia fell to Mexico,

1071
01:21:57,814 --> 01:22:02,109
but we are also blessed, dear god,
that you have brought into our lives,

1072
01:22:02,193 --> 01:22:03,736
Bob and his Kathy.

1073
01:22:05,571 --> 01:22:06,906
We love them.

1074
01:22:09,075 --> 01:22:10,368
Like family.

1075
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:17,124
I feel good tonight, Bob.

1076
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:22,129
Well, it is a good night, my friend.

1077
01:22:22,213 --> 01:22:27,009
All of my cash,
this economic renaissance, this new Miami.

1078
01:22:27,093 --> 01:22:29,679
The economy is addicted to drugs.

1079
01:22:29,762 --> 01:22:33,307
You know who's
the biggest money launderer in the us?

1080
01:22:33,391 --> 01:22:35,226
Well, I thought it was me.

1081
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:37,103
No?

1082
01:22:37,645 --> 01:22:39,021
No.

1083
01:22:39,105 --> 01:22:41,732
Your federal reserve bank.

1084
01:22:41,816 --> 01:22:43,901
It's called the anonymous window.

1085
01:22:43,985 --> 01:22:47,154
They accept pallet loads of cash
that used to be drug pesos,

1086
01:22:47,363 --> 01:22:50,992
hundreds of millions of dollars
from my country's central bank,

1087
01:22:51,242 --> 01:22:53,035
no questions asked.

1088
01:22:53,828 --> 01:22:56,414
If your government
didn't have my dirty money,

1089
01:22:56,914 --> 01:22:58,499
your economy would collapse.

1090
01:23:04,755 --> 01:23:07,967
You know, Bob, I think
I'm going to introduce you to Pablo.

1091
01:23:10,636 --> 01:23:13,723
But there's a little problem
I need you to fix first.

1092
01:23:14,807 --> 01:23:17,852
Alcaino says
don Chepe's $10 million is frozen,

1093
01:23:17,935 --> 01:23:19,854
which is actually Pablo Escobar's money.

1094
01:23:19,937 --> 01:23:23,941
And he doesn't give a rat's ass
that our government did it.

1095
01:23:24,025 --> 01:23:27,486
He wants his money and it's not
gonna be over until he gets it.

1096
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,780
There's a senate
investigation into Noriega.

1097
01:23:29,864 --> 01:23:31,991
You're not getting money
that went through Panama!

1098
01:23:32,074 --> 01:23:34,535
Frozen is frozen. Accept it.

1099
01:23:35,703 --> 01:23:37,747
Mark, it's fucking up our operation.

1100
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:39,248
We need you to fix this for us.

1101
01:23:39,332 --> 01:23:41,167
How am I gonna fix this?

1102
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,919
You want me to call senator Kerry?

1103
01:23:43,002 --> 01:23:44,921
"Hey, John,
could you drop your investigation

1104
01:23:45,004 --> 01:23:46,505
"that the president has sanctioned?

1105
01:23:46,589 --> 01:23:48,716
"'Cause, my friend Bob's
getting really upset?"

1106
01:23:48,799 --> 01:23:51,177
Reagan wants Noriega's ass.
Are you listening to me?

1107
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,887
Hey, hey. You know what Alcaino said?

1108
01:23:53,012 --> 01:23:55,973
"That's not an answer
that keeps you alive, my friend."

1109
01:23:56,307 --> 01:23:58,643
- Okay?
- Hey. What did you say that for?

1110
01:23:58,726 --> 01:24:00,412
No. Wait a second, hold on.
Did he threaten you?

1111
01:24:00,436 --> 01:24:02,063
- No.
- Did he put your neck in a noose?

1112
01:24:02,188 --> 01:24:03,356
Yeah, and he's squeezing.

1113
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:05,983
No, he didn't. Roberto didn't say that.
He wouldn't say that.

1114
01:24:06,067 --> 01:24:07,443
It's Escobar.

1115
01:24:07,693 --> 01:24:08,945
Wait a second.

1116
01:24:09,153 --> 01:24:14,200
Bob, are you in danger from Pablo Escobar
if his money doesn't come through?

1117
01:24:34,887 --> 01:24:35,888
Ev.

1118
01:24:36,847 --> 01:24:37,890
I'm home.

1119
01:24:39,058 --> 01:24:41,102
<i>Don Pablo is not happy.</i>

1120
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:45,064
<i>10 million of don Chepe's money,
which is Escobar's money,</i>

1121
01:24:45,314 --> 01:24:46,774
<i>is stuck in Panama.</i>

1122
01:24:50,903 --> 01:24:52,613
<i>It seems your president Reagan,</i>

1123
01:24:52,697 --> 01:24:55,199
<i>he's frozen all Panamanian accounts
in an effort...</i>

1124
01:25:01,747 --> 01:25:03,833
<i>That is not an answer that keeps you alive.</i>

1125
01:25:03,916 --> 01:25:05,001
Daddy?

1126
01:25:05,084 --> 01:25:06,645
<i>You should work this out
before don Pablo does.</i>

1127
01:25:06,669 --> 01:25:08,921
<i>- Something's dripping.
- If you know what I mean.</i>

1128
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:13,592
Did you cut yourself?

1129
01:25:15,886 --> 01:25:17,221
Come here. Come here.

1130
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:19,932
Daddy will take care of it.
No, it's all right.

1131
01:25:20,016 --> 01:25:21,892
- Come on, here we go.
- Are you okay, baby?

1132
01:25:21,976 --> 01:25:23,102
Are you hurt?

1133
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:25,730
- I don't see any...
- No, she's not cut.

1134
01:25:25,813 --> 01:25:28,482
Okay, all right. All right, it's okay.

1135
01:25:28,566 --> 01:25:30,234
It's all right. Here we go.

1136
01:25:30,776 --> 01:25:32,486
- No, she's okay.
- I don't see any cut.

1137
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:33,654
Are you all right?

1138
01:25:33,738 --> 01:25:35,740
Okay, that's good. Here we go.

1139
01:25:36,615 --> 01:25:37,616
What is that?

1140
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:38,760
- What is it?
- I'll take care of it.

1141
01:25:38,784 --> 01:25:40,804
- Are you okay, baby?
- Okay. It's all right. Shh, shh.

1142
01:25:40,828 --> 01:25:43,664
No, it's okay.
Just a misunderstanding, that's all.

1143
01:25:43,748 --> 01:25:44,749
It'll be all right.

1144
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,834
- You okay, sweetheart?
- Let's go get a band-aid.

1145
01:26:34,006 --> 01:26:36,133
These people are fucking nuts.

1146
01:26:36,217 --> 01:26:39,929
I know I sound like a broken record,
but I fucking heard it and I've seen it.

1147
01:26:40,012 --> 01:26:42,848
You think you understand.
You fucking don't.

1148
01:26:43,349 --> 01:26:46,268
These people
are not fucking cops, Bobby, all right?

1149
01:26:46,352 --> 01:26:49,688
They will make you die for days
and they've got fucking good at it.

1150
01:26:49,772 --> 01:26:51,875
You know what? They out off your fingers.
They out off your toes.

1151
01:26:51,899 --> 01:26:53,502
They inject you
with that fucking adrenalin shit

1152
01:26:53,526 --> 01:26:55,611
so you don't pass out before any of that.

1153
01:26:56,403 --> 01:26:59,115
Man, they cut open your fucking eyes
so you can't shut them,

1154
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:01,518
and then they're gonna
bring in your little fucking family.

1155
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,161
They'll cut your son's head off
with a cheese wire.

1156
01:27:04,245 --> 01:27:05,955
They'll do the same to your little girl.

1157
01:27:06,038 --> 01:27:08,141
And then, they'll out your wife's tits off
right in front of you

1158
01:27:08,165 --> 01:27:09,309
and they won't feel a fucking thing.

1159
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:12,545
Last but not least,
they're gonna cut your fucking head off

1160
01:27:12,628 --> 01:27:14,348
and send it
to your buddies down at customs.

1161
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:48,664
You could have retired, couldn't you?

1162
01:27:55,754 --> 01:27:57,381
<i>You made a choice.</i>

1163
01:28:02,261 --> 01:28:03,804
And this is mine.

1164
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:19,737
Now, I hope you don't mind,
but I got you something.

1165
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:23,407
I saw these and, of
course, I thought of you.

1166
01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:25,659
Roberto.

1167
01:28:29,246 --> 01:28:32,833
They are Japanese Akoya pearls,
prized for their elegance.

1168
01:28:32,917 --> 01:28:36,045
You don't find these in lagoons,
you have to dive deep to get them.

1169
01:28:36,128 --> 01:28:38,464
Oh, my god, they're gorgeous.

1170
01:28:38,547 --> 01:28:39,757
Let me help.

1171
01:28:50,059 --> 01:28:51,393
How do they look?

1172
01:28:52,895 --> 01:28:56,357
Like they've been stuck inside a shell
waiting to be around your neck.

1173
01:29:00,027 --> 01:29:01,946
Roberto, thank you so much.

1174
01:29:02,029 --> 01:29:03,155
Of course.

1175
01:29:04,073 --> 01:29:06,367
I gotta go look at it. Oh, my god.

1176
01:29:10,663 --> 01:29:13,082
Well, you certainly know
how to make women happy.

1177
01:29:13,165 --> 01:29:14,166
Thank you.

1178
01:29:16,126 --> 01:29:19,922
I don't wanna talk about business
on such a beautiful day,

1179
01:29:21,173 --> 01:29:22,883
but I must have that money.

1180
01:29:28,514 --> 01:29:31,016
Escobar sent me his calling card.

1181
01:29:32,351 --> 01:29:33,686
A bloody coffin.

1182
01:29:34,645 --> 01:29:38,941
I apologize for my
associate's indiscretion,

1183
01:29:39,024 --> 01:29:41,068
but as your friend,
I beg you to get him his money.

1184
01:29:41,151 --> 01:29:43,404
Without it, he is an animal.

1185
01:29:43,487 --> 01:29:47,574
And I'm asking you to tell don Chepe
to deliver a message to Escobar

1186
01:29:47,658 --> 01:29:50,202
that I do not do business under threat.

1187
01:29:50,286 --> 01:29:52,204
Well, at this point, unfortunately,

1188
01:29:52,288 --> 01:29:56,375
neither you nor I are in a position
to dictate terms to don Pablo.

1189
01:30:04,466 --> 01:30:05,592
Mazuri ah! Mr. Awan.

1190
01:30:06,051 --> 01:30:08,095
Thank you very much
for having me to your home.

1191
01:30:08,178 --> 01:30:09,555
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1192
01:30:10,431 --> 01:30:13,851
Well, it's a weekend,
I'll just get right to the point.

1193
01:30:16,186 --> 01:30:18,814
If you consider me
to be important to the bank,

1194
01:30:18,897 --> 01:30:22,818
then please find a way
to get my client's money out of Panama.

1195
01:30:22,901 --> 01:30:25,404
It's your government, not our bank.

1196
01:30:25,487 --> 01:30:26,488
We can do nothing.

1197
01:30:26,572 --> 01:30:30,784
Adjust your records to show
that my client's $10 million

1198
01:30:30,868 --> 01:30:35,664
was deposited into your bank
before the date of the freeze.

1199
01:30:38,292 --> 01:30:41,295
You're asking us to falsify our records?

1200
01:30:43,547 --> 01:30:47,426
Yes, that is exactly
what I'm asking you to do.

1201
01:30:58,896 --> 01:31:00,356
Consider it done.

1202
01:31:01,106 --> 01:31:05,402
In exchange for our efforts,
we need you to increase your deposits.

1203
01:31:05,486 --> 01:31:09,531
I will have Mr. Howard set up a meeting
with our European executive.

1204
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:12,993
Mr. Awan, I thank you.

1205
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:22,252
- Now, Mr. Bilgrami, as promised.
- Thank you.

1206
01:31:22,336 --> 01:31:24,296
May I have a look?

1207
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:26,131
I was admiring your briefcase.

1208
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,926
Of course.

1209
01:31:31,136 --> 01:31:32,429
Renwick.

1210
01:31:33,347 --> 01:31:34,348
Re nwick.

1211
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:37,893
I wouldn't mind one of these.

1212
01:31:37,976 --> 01:31:39,061
Is it expensive?

1213
01:31:40,312 --> 01:31:41,563
Priceless.

1214
01:31:53,951 --> 01:31:55,077
- Curtains up.
- Mmm-hmm.

1215
01:31:56,412 --> 01:31:59,957
Good to see you again, Mr. Howard.
I'd like to introduce my fiancée.

1216
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,167
Kathy Eriksson, Mr. Chinoy.

1217
01:32:02,251 --> 01:32:06,255
But I can assure you, Mr. Chinoy,
that my clients are all professional,

1218
01:32:06,338 --> 01:32:09,425
as professional as anyone that BCCI...

1219
01:32:09,967 --> 01:32:11,218
Do you like escargot?

1220
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:16,265
Of course, I can introduce you
to my friends whenever you want.

1221
01:32:16,348 --> 01:32:19,435
Mr. Chinoy,
that would be greatly appreciated.

1222
01:32:19,518 --> 01:32:22,396
Boys, enough of the working.

1223
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:25,107
Bob and I have an announcement to make.

1224
01:32:25,357 --> 01:32:27,943
We've decided on a date for our wedding.

1225
01:32:28,861 --> 01:32:29,862
October 3rd.

1226
01:32:29,945 --> 01:32:31,488
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

1227
01:32:31,572 --> 01:32:32,614
Surprise.

1228
01:32:32,698 --> 01:32:37,536
It would just mean so much to both of us
if you could join us on our special day.

1229
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:39,246
<i>Mazur'. Wonderful. Brilliant.</i>

1230
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,123
- Really?
- Yes.

1231
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:44,001
Really.

1232
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:46,712
I mean, now that's our answer, the wedding.

1233
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:48,839
It's in three weeks.
We got a lot of work to do.

1234
01:32:48,922 --> 01:32:52,718
I already confided in Gloria.
She's totally willing to help.

1235
01:32:52,801 --> 01:32:54,678
So, you thought of everything?

1236
01:32:56,555 --> 01:33:00,267
Mr. Chinoy, Rudy Armbrecht is
one of our most important clients.

1237
01:33:01,226 --> 01:33:02,895
Here, this will give you some background.

1238
01:33:02,978 --> 01:33:03,979
Armbrechti thank you.

1239
01:33:04,062 --> 01:33:06,982
Bob, you started the meeting without me.

1240
01:33:07,065 --> 01:33:10,402
No, no, no.
Mr. Chinoy, Mr. Javier Ospina.

1241
01:33:10,486 --> 01:33:11,820
Nice to meet you, sir.

1242
01:33:11,904 --> 01:33:13,906
My friend, what a great pleasure
to meet you.

1243
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:16,366
- I've heard beautiful things about you.
- Thank you.

1244
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:18,494
What they did not tell me was
how handsome you are.

1245
01:33:20,621 --> 01:33:22,998
Bob, I wanna
ask you something very quickly.

1246
01:33:23,081 --> 01:33:25,584
This guy is the creep we gave our money to?

1247
01:33:26,585 --> 01:33:28,587
Where do you think
this guy parked his camel?

1248
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:31,381
Okay, sit down. Yeah. Sit down.

1249
01:33:31,465 --> 01:33:33,842
Tell me I'm not telling the truth.
Am I right?

1250
01:33:33,926 --> 01:33:35,385
Have a seat. Have a seat.

1251
01:33:35,469 --> 01:33:39,556
We have 30 million
parked in Charleston, south Carolina.

1252
01:33:39,765 --> 01:33:42,768
The Bible belt? A good place to hide money.

1253
01:33:42,893 --> 01:33:44,603
It's where the baby Jesus hides.

1254
01:33:44,895 --> 01:33:48,607
He only comes out at night
so he can watch the money, protect it.

1255
01:33:48,774 --> 01:33:50,943
We could have 100 million more.

1256
01:33:51,235 --> 01:33:55,030
But such amounts need to be concealed
to everyone but a select few.

1257
01:33:55,113 --> 01:33:56,990
No problem, Mr. Musella.

1258
01:33:57,074 --> 01:34:00,869
BCCI has $25 billion in assets.

1259
01:34:00,953 --> 01:34:02,329
Armbrechti 25 billion?

1260
01:34:02,412 --> 01:34:03,622
Chinoyi 25 billion, yes.

1261
01:34:04,706 --> 01:34:08,710
Tell me, how would you
guarantee that the funds cannot be traced?

1262
01:34:08,794 --> 01:34:10,034
Chinoyi let me put it this way.

1263
01:34:11,421 --> 01:34:12,506
We have a protocol.

1264
01:34:14,132 --> 01:34:18,345
All we need from you is a signature.
And don't you worry about a thing.

1265
01:34:19,721 --> 01:34:21,765
Why, what's he gonna worry about?

1266
01:34:22,307 --> 01:34:27,062
Bankers, all they are
is crooked men with capes.

1267
01:34:27,145 --> 01:34:29,648
Only they have suits, like superman.

1268
01:34:29,731 --> 01:34:32,609
- Except, they're maybe like the joker.
- Go for a walk.

1269
01:34:32,693 --> 01:34:35,737
They are crooked thieves
with crooked cocks.

1270
01:34:35,821 --> 01:34:37,006
Why don't you go take a walk, huh?

1271
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:39,324
That's what they are.
Their penises are crooked.

1272
01:34:40,075 --> 01:34:42,911
I'm gonna come back to this table,
and when I come back,

1273
01:34:42,995 --> 01:34:44,413
I'm gonna be completely invisible.

1274
01:34:44,871 --> 01:34:46,164
- Ospina.
- That's enough.

1275
01:34:46,623 --> 01:34:48,000
You broke my heart, Bob.

1276
01:35:11,607 --> 01:35:13,358
- How are you, Ospina?
- What?

1277
01:35:14,359 --> 01:35:16,653
- I'm really good. How you doing?
- Yeah? Good.

1278
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,785
- Would you dance with me?
- She wants to dance with me.

1279
01:35:24,453 --> 01:35:25,454
<i>Amigo!</i>

1280
01:35:26,121 --> 01:35:28,321
Are you kidding me?
I'm gonna dance with you right away.

1281
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:43,972
<i>Oh, oui, monsieur!</i>

1282
01:36:04,534 --> 01:36:06,411
That Ospina's quite a character.

1283
01:36:06,495 --> 01:36:09,998
He can fuck whoever he wants,
as long as it's not me or my people.

1284
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:14,044
- Would you dance with me for a little bit?
- Okay. Oh.

1285
01:36:14,127 --> 01:36:15,207
- You all right?
- I'm good.

1286
01:36:15,253 --> 01:36:16,421
- You okay? Okay.
- I'm good.

1287
01:36:20,384 --> 01:36:22,219
Oh! Okay.

1288
01:36:31,311 --> 01:36:32,312
Oh!

1289
01:36:32,437 --> 01:36:36,483
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me,
it's my bedtime.

1290
01:36:36,775 --> 01:36:39,361
Mr. Bob, the night is still young.

1291
01:36:39,444 --> 01:36:43,156
Yes, it is, but not for a man
who trades money in 10 time zones.

1292
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:44,825
Good night, Gonzalo. Get some rest.

1293
01:36:44,991 --> 01:36:46,368
Mr. Armbrecht.

1294
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:48,704
Right. Okay.

1295
01:36:49,621 --> 01:36:50,747
Good night.

1296
01:36:54,751 --> 01:36:58,797
Excuse me. Ospina, I need to
steal away my future bride, my friend.

1297
01:37:00,132 --> 01:37:01,466
Have a good night.

1298
01:37:04,678 --> 01:37:08,265
I know. I know who the fuck you are, Bob.

1299
01:38:35,852 --> 01:38:37,395
What did Ospina do?

1300
01:38:42,692 --> 01:38:44,236
He embarrassed them.

1301
01:38:48,532 --> 01:38:51,052
I'm gonna sit in your fucking hotel
and then I'm gonna kill you.

1302
01:38:51,117 --> 01:38:52,470
I don't care if it offends people!

1303
01:38:52,494 --> 01:38:54,496
What? I'm gonna kill you, man! Fuck!

1304
01:38:54,579 --> 01:38:58,583
Hey, Mr. Bob.
We were going to have breakfast.

1305
01:38:58,667 --> 01:39:02,504
Well, I thought with
everything that happened last night...

1306
01:39:02,587 --> 01:39:03,964
Armbrechti a real tragedy.

1307
01:39:04,589 --> 01:39:05,841
Still have to eat.

1308
01:39:05,924 --> 01:39:08,093
- We have to get back for the wedding.
- Yeah.

1309
01:39:08,176 --> 01:39:10,512
- You have a date?
- Yes, October 3rd.

1310
01:39:10,595 --> 01:39:13,056
We really hope you can join us.
It would mean the world to us.

1311
01:39:13,139 --> 01:39:14,266
Mora Sr; We'll be there.

1312
01:39:15,767 --> 01:39:16,768
<i>Mijg!</i>

1313
01:39:17,185 --> 01:39:18,270
Nice to see you again.

1314
01:39:22,023 --> 01:39:24,776
I'm gonna deal with the luggage.

1315
01:39:26,111 --> 01:39:27,320
Excuse me.

1316
01:39:27,404 --> 01:39:29,865
Bob, this is Gerardo Moncada.

1317
01:39:31,283 --> 01:39:34,160
Don Chepe, it's a pleasure to meet you.

1318
01:39:34,953 --> 01:39:37,247
I hope that if
you're in Tampa on October 3rd,

1319
01:39:37,330 --> 01:39:39,457
you would do us the honor
of attending our wedding.

1320
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,711
I will if it can be arranged.

1321
01:39:43,295 --> 01:39:44,421
Thank you.

1322
01:39:51,595 --> 01:39:54,180
I like Paris. Alcaino said I would.

1323
01:39:55,348 --> 01:39:59,811
But more importantly, I like you.

1324
01:40:01,479 --> 01:40:04,816
We are authorizing the release
of 150 million to BCCI.

1325
01:40:13,491 --> 01:40:14,826
Thank you, Rudy.

1326
01:40:19,748 --> 01:40:22,375
- Who was that young guy?
- That was don Chepe.

1327
01:40:24,669 --> 01:40:26,588
More importantly, the other man,

1328
01:40:28,006 --> 01:40:29,382
is Pablo Escobar.

1329
01:40:31,259 --> 01:40:32,677
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1330
01:40:32,761 --> 01:40:33,762
I'm not.

1331
01:40:34,346 --> 01:40:35,597
Kathy, listen to me.

1332
01:40:37,015 --> 01:40:39,225
I'm not going back home with you right now.

1333
01:40:39,309 --> 01:40:41,394
I'm going to London to BCCI headquarters.

1334
01:40:41,478 --> 01:40:43,647
- Trust me on this, okay.
- Bob. Bob.

1335
01:40:47,233 --> 01:40:49,736
We're supposed to get married.
We need to end this.

1336
01:40:49,819 --> 01:40:52,822
I know, and we will.
But we can get these guys.

1337
01:40:52,906 --> 01:40:54,146
Come on, I'll put you in a cab.

1338
01:40:56,284 --> 01:40:57,369
Thank you.

1339
01:41:04,209 --> 01:41:05,251
Hi.

1340
01:41:06,503 --> 01:41:07,712
I'm Kathy.

1341
01:41:10,882 --> 01:41:12,300
I know who you are.

1342
01:41:27,941 --> 01:41:29,567
Are you sleeping with him?

1343
01:41:32,696 --> 01:41:34,572
You know the answer to your question.

1344
01:41:36,574 --> 01:41:38,284
If I did, I wouldn't ask.

1345
01:41:39,577 --> 01:41:42,831
Your name's Evelyn. He calls you Ev.

1346
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,711
You met in eighth grade, remained friends.

1347
01:41:48,670 --> 01:41:50,839
Married, had two children.

1348
01:41:53,258 --> 01:41:56,052
You don't like loud parties
or people who brag.

1349
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:00,181
But you do like pineapple and pizza.

1350
01:42:02,517 --> 01:42:05,562
You're a lucky woman.
And you don't have to worry.

1351
01:42:15,113 --> 01:42:17,615
The last time he wore it
was on our wedding day.

1352
01:42:18,074 --> 01:42:20,285
Well, hope it still fits.

1353
01:42:24,581 --> 01:42:25,790
Thank you.

1354
01:42:40,597 --> 01:42:41,598
<i>Merci.</i>

1355
01:42:57,906 --> 01:42:59,300
<i>Bunny. We have a highly reliable source</i>

1356
01:42:59,324 --> 01:43:01,244
<i>telling us about a huge shipment
arriving tonight</i>

1357
01:43:01,326 --> 01:43:02,827
in the port of Miami.

1358
01:43:02,911 --> 01:43:04,162
It could be your boys.

1359
01:43:04,245 --> 01:43:08,249
We are talking 2,500 pounds
of pure cocaine worth $23 million.

1360
01:43:08,333 --> 01:43:10,835
That's the largest seizure
ever in the southeast.

1361
01:43:10,919 --> 01:43:13,129
Bonni, listen, I need more time.

1362
01:43:13,213 --> 01:43:16,841
<i>A bust this size right now and all
these guys will be running for cover.</i>

1363
01:43:16,925 --> 01:43:19,094
We can get senior management at BCCI.

1364
01:43:19,177 --> 01:43:21,387
We can get
the founder and chairman, Abedi.

1365
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:22,806
<i>But I need more time.</i>

1366
01:43:22,889 --> 01:43:25,016
There is a beginning, middle
and end to everything.

1367
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:27,018
<i>- Bonni. Bonni...
- This is the end, Mazur.</i>

1368
01:43:58,591 --> 01:43:59,676
Hello?

1369
01:44:02,512 --> 01:44:05,640
<i>Abedy. We live each day in divinity.</i>

1370
01:44:07,058 --> 01:44:11,354
The power and the quality of divinity.

1371
01:44:16,901 --> 01:44:18,611
<i>It rains on us.</i>

1372
01:44:19,696 --> 01:44:21,865
<i>When we live in humility,</i>

1373
01:44:23,116 --> 01:44:25,952
god's Providence pours into us.

1374
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:28,580
<i>We are truly blessed.</i>

1375
01:44:32,417 --> 01:44:33,418
<i>All of us.</i>

1376
01:44:39,090 --> 01:44:40,425
<i>We live in majesty.</i>

1377
01:44:40,842 --> 01:44:42,510
Police, search warrant, open the door!

1378
01:44:45,096 --> 01:44:50,059
<i>Abedy. Each and every one of us
who work on such a glorious endeavor...</i>

1379
01:44:52,353 --> 01:44:53,646
Police! Get down!

1380
01:44:54,397 --> 01:44:55,440
Get down!

1381
01:44:55,523 --> 01:44:58,067
<i>Abedy. God pours his infinite benevolence</i>

1382
01:44:58,151 --> 01:45:01,487
<i>on bank of credit
and commerce international,</i>

1383
01:45:02,864 --> 01:45:07,702
because we have the humility to receive it.

1384
01:45:23,343 --> 01:45:24,427
Gloria.

1385
01:45:25,136 --> 01:45:26,137
- Hey.
- Bob.

1386
01:45:26,971 --> 01:45:29,474
Okay, it's all right.

1387
01:45:29,557 --> 01:45:31,643
Roberto told me
you are the only one I can trust.

1388
01:45:31,935 --> 01:45:34,938
You need to keep his operation alive
while he's underground.

1389
01:45:35,271 --> 01:45:36,731
Do you even know where he is?

1390
01:45:36,814 --> 01:45:37,814
He wouldn't tell me.

1391
01:45:37,857 --> 01:45:39,984
He just told me that
you would know what to do.

1392
01:45:40,777 --> 01:45:42,820
Okay, I can do it.

1393
01:45:48,826 --> 01:45:51,287
Can I have a knife or something to...

1394
01:45:52,163 --> 01:45:53,289
Thanks, Kathy.

1395
01:46:00,797 --> 01:46:03,925
There are 30 distributors
holding product and money.

1396
01:46:07,845 --> 01:46:10,056
To pick it up, you use codename Primo.

1397
01:46:11,099 --> 01:46:12,350
I'll do what I can.

1398
01:46:13,059 --> 01:46:14,435
Thank you.

1399
01:46:14,519 --> 01:46:16,771
I feel so terrible inside.

1400
01:46:18,022 --> 01:46:20,149
Gloria, I need to talk to you. Come here.

1401
01:46:23,987 --> 01:46:29,075
Listen, it's too crazy right now,
there's too much going on.

1402
01:46:29,158 --> 01:46:30,718
I think you should go back to Colombia.

1403
01:46:30,785 --> 01:46:33,454
I can't. This won't be enough.

1404
01:46:33,579 --> 01:46:35,498
Roberto needs the money for the lawyers.

1405
01:46:35,665 --> 01:46:38,376
- And the us will freeze all his accounts...
- I know. I know.

1406
01:46:38,543 --> 01:46:40,378
And try to destroy our businesses.

1407
01:46:40,461 --> 01:46:42,171
Gloria, please, listen to me.

1408
01:46:42,255 --> 01:46:44,132
It's too dangerous.

1409
01:46:44,215 --> 01:46:48,886
I know it's dangerous, but I have to do it
for Bianca and for her father.

1410
01:46:53,308 --> 01:46:55,143
Just give me a minute, please.

1411
01:47:11,826 --> 01:47:16,456
It's like you get close to people,
you know them.

1412
01:47:19,167 --> 01:47:23,254
Yeah, well, that's what happens
when you're doing your job.

1413
01:47:26,507 --> 01:47:28,343
I know you don't believe that.

1414
01:47:32,430 --> 01:47:35,683
It's not just a job. I
feel so terrible for her.

1415
01:47:35,767 --> 01:47:36,934
I know.

1416
01:47:40,730 --> 01:47:41,856
I know.

1417
01:47:47,570 --> 01:47:49,280
It's enough to make me cry.

1418
01:47:52,492 --> 01:47:55,787
Mazur, tux looks good.

1419
01:47:56,788 --> 01:47:58,164
Kiss the bride for me.

1420
01:47:59,707 --> 01:48:01,542
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.

1421
01:48:01,626 --> 01:48:03,169
<i>Bonny. Sherman, get over here.</i>

1422
01:48:03,252 --> 01:48:05,296
- She's a classic.
- Jesus.

1423
01:48:06,756 --> 01:48:08,508
Sorry I didn't tell you sooner, Bob.

1424
01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:10,885
Tell me sooner for what?

1425
01:48:10,968 --> 01:48:14,806
She sent me to Washington headquarters.
She set this up.

1426
01:48:16,307 --> 01:48:18,184
They're NBC.

1427
01:48:18,267 --> 01:48:19,477
The wedding photographers?

1428
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,160
Yeah, they got an exclusive on the bust.

1429
01:48:21,229 --> 01:48:22,230
Christ.

1430
01:48:22,313 --> 01:48:24,899
So, prison isn't enough.
She wants humiliation, too.

1431
01:48:24,982 --> 01:48:26,275
No, they want publicity.

1432
01:48:27,276 --> 01:48:28,587
She forced me to meet with the press

1433
01:48:28,611 --> 01:48:31,239
and now she's gunning for me
since I wouldn't give 'em your name.

1434
01:48:31,322 --> 01:48:32,448
Well, thank you.

1435
01:48:32,532 --> 01:48:34,158
Think DEA has any openings?

1436
01:48:34,992 --> 01:48:37,578
Hey, Bob, Bob,
can you help me with this goddamn thing?

1437
01:48:37,662 --> 01:48:39,973
- Here, here, here, here, you're messing it up.
- All right.

1438
01:48:39,997 --> 01:48:41,975
We only had one tie in Aguadilla,
so I never got a turn,

1439
01:48:41,999 --> 01:48:43,751
so never learned, you know.

1440
01:48:43,835 --> 01:48:46,355
I just hate wearing suits,
I always feel like I look like a waiter.

1441
01:48:46,379 --> 01:48:47,648
Yeah, well, run, get me a cup of coffee.

1442
01:48:47,672 --> 01:48:49,298
Yeah, I got your creamer right here.

1443
01:48:49,382 --> 01:48:55,179
Hey, other than when junior was born,
this is one of the best days of my life.

1444
01:48:56,222 --> 01:48:59,267
This is my brother-in-law, Steve.
This is Gonzalo.

1445
01:48:59,350 --> 01:49:00,518
Nice to meet you, Gonzalo.

1446
01:49:01,519 --> 01:49:03,119
- See you on the other side.
- All right.

1447
01:49:07,859 --> 01:49:08,860
Wow...

1448
01:49:12,864 --> 01:49:13,865
Hey, guys.

1449
01:49:15,324 --> 01:49:17,743
Do you think I'm gonna get fucked later?

1450
01:49:17,827 --> 01:49:20,371
You're gonna get fucked
like you never been fucked before.

1451
01:49:20,455 --> 01:49:21,456
Great.

1452
01:49:40,308 --> 01:49:41,309
Hey!

1453
01:49:44,729 --> 01:49:46,606
- So glad you're here.
- Good to see you.

1454
01:49:49,275 --> 01:49:50,568
- Hey.
- Yeah.

1455
01:49:51,402 --> 01:49:53,237
Musella, I think you wear red.

1456
01:49:53,821 --> 01:49:56,491
Tischler's orders.
Good guys are in white today.

1457
01:49:56,574 --> 01:49:59,202
Well, then shit,
I'm wearing the wrong color over here.

1458
01:49:59,285 --> 01:50:01,537
Just haven't had a chance
to show your true colors.

1459
01:50:01,621 --> 01:50:02,747
You're too kind.

1460
01:50:03,873 --> 01:50:05,666
I'll be glad when this shit is done, Bobby.

1461
01:50:06,876 --> 01:50:09,086
Yeah. One last hurdle, Dom.

1462
01:50:10,838 --> 01:50:12,089
Armbrecht's not here.

1463
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:13,841
Shit.

1464
01:50:14,967 --> 01:50:16,552
How you doing? You all right?

1465
01:50:16,928 --> 01:50:18,429
- Move it, piss ant.
- All right.

1466
01:50:49,627 --> 01:50:50,836
Get out of my face.

1467
01:51:09,063 --> 01:51:10,481
What are you doing here?

1468
01:51:10,565 --> 01:51:12,900
When the heat is on, you
get out of the fire.

1469
01:51:12,984 --> 01:51:15,861
Except, I'm a chef, I'm always in the fire.

1470
01:51:16,737 --> 01:51:19,490
Besides, you're not talking
to Roberto Alcaino.

1471
01:51:19,574 --> 01:51:21,492
I am now Fernando Alvarez.

1472
01:51:22,493 --> 01:51:24,287
Wanna see my Argentinian passport?

1473
01:51:27,999 --> 01:51:29,584
Roberto, I'm glad you're here.

1474
01:51:32,545 --> 01:51:36,007
But there is a part of me
that wishes you hadn't taken that risk.

1475
01:51:37,049 --> 01:51:40,678
Without family or friends,
what kind of world would this be?

1476
01:51:40,761 --> 01:51:42,513
There would be no reason to be alive.

1477
01:51:44,098 --> 01:51:45,099
Hmm?

1478
01:51:47,268 --> 01:51:48,644
It's a good day.

1479
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:34,482
Okay, here we go.

1480
01:52:42,573 --> 01:52:44,200
Where's Ertz? You got eyes on Ertz?

1481
01:52:44,283 --> 01:52:45,409
- Yeah, right here.
- Where?

1482
01:52:45,534 --> 01:52:46,535
Just there.

1483
01:53:17,108 --> 01:53:19,193
- Roberto.
- Surprise.

1484
01:53:23,531 --> 01:53:24,532
Please be seated.

1485
01:53:28,661 --> 01:53:30,830
Bob. Kathy.

1486
01:53:31,997 --> 01:53:34,375
I'd like you to turn around and take a look

1487
01:53:34,583 --> 01:53:37,962
at everyone that's gathered here today
to celebrate your love.

1488
01:53:58,023 --> 01:54:01,610
Does anyone here have any reason
why this couple should not be wed?

1489
01:54:01,694 --> 01:54:03,821
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

1490
01:54:05,698 --> 01:54:07,074
Here we go. Here we go.

1491
01:54:16,167 --> 01:54:18,252
These guys first! They're right here!
Get them!

1492
01:54:20,588 --> 01:54:21,839
Bob! Get down! Get down!

1493
01:54:29,013 --> 01:54:30,014
Don't move!

1494
01:55:10,387 --> 01:55:11,388
You traitors!

1495
01:55:12,389 --> 01:55:14,225
You will fucking regret this!

1496
01:55:14,558 --> 01:55:15,559
You hear me!

1497
01:55:16,018 --> 01:55:17,728
You'll live to regret this!

1498
01:55:27,112 --> 01:55:28,280
Take them away.

1499
01:55:30,241 --> 01:55:31,575
You will regret this.

1500
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:35,222
- Go on. Please, take 'em out.
- All right, get them out of here!

1501
01:55:35,246 --> 01:55:37,846
Clear it out! Clear it out!
Get all the cuffed people out of here!

1502
01:55:39,333 --> 01:55:41,919
<i>Well,
the drug dealers have said that,</i>

1503
01:55:42,002 --> 01:55:45,130
<i>your children are
the business of their future.</i>

1504
01:55:45,965 --> 01:55:47,842
<i>America needs to stop this scourge.</i>

1505
01:55:47,925 --> 01:55:50,135
<i>And these arrests
are a big step in that direction.</i>

1506
01:55:50,594 --> 01:55:53,305
<i>A beginning to an end of those who seek...</i>

1507
01:55:53,389 --> 01:55:55,516
- Bob.
- Hey.

1508
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:57,518
Armbrecht was taken down at the airport.

1509
01:55:57,601 --> 01:55:58,769
Al right. Thank you.

1510
01:55:59,562 --> 01:56:00,938
- Good job.
- You, too.

1511
01:56:03,566 --> 01:56:05,150
Ain't that some shit, Bob?

1512
01:56:05,234 --> 01:56:08,630
Tischler bails when the shit goes down, and
then she shows up to take the credit, huh?

1513
01:56:08,654 --> 01:56:11,115
- Are you surprised?
- A little.

1514
01:56:12,908 --> 01:56:14,118
You know, you were right.

1515
01:56:15,286 --> 01:56:16,579
Of course, I'm always right.

1516
01:56:17,121 --> 01:56:18,122
The informant.

1517
01:56:19,081 --> 01:56:21,333
Okay, all right, I'm 99% right.

1518
01:56:25,004 --> 01:56:26,630
I loved Bob Musella.

1519
01:56:28,299 --> 01:56:30,634
Me, too. Me, too.

1520
01:56:32,386 --> 01:56:33,387
Hey, Bob.

1521
01:56:35,139 --> 01:56:37,141
Not all your friends
went to jail today, all right?

1522
01:56:48,402 --> 01:56:49,695
- Hey.
- Hey.

1523
01:56:51,238 --> 01:56:55,159
So, customs is letting me keep the dress,
but not the pearls.

1524
01:56:55,910 --> 01:56:58,287
Too bad you got jilted, you look so hot.

1525
01:57:02,458 --> 01:57:05,210
Did you get him to talk?
I'm sorry. I'll catch you guys later.

1526
01:57:07,838 --> 01:57:09,048
You wanna help me?

1527
01:57:11,175 --> 01:57:12,176
Yeah.

1528
01:57:34,531 --> 01:57:37,451
Well, it's still a pretty good ending.

1529
01:57:39,536 --> 01:57:40,663
It was, wasn't it?

1530
01:58:00,349 --> 01:58:01,558
Go home, Bob.

1531
01:58:15,114 --> 01:58:16,240
You okay there?

1532
01:58:32,464 --> 01:58:33,882
Harley, you're up next.

1533
01:58:34,842 --> 01:58:36,218
Here, catch.

1534
01:58:44,143 --> 01:58:45,769
Evelyn; Hey.
Mazuri hi.
