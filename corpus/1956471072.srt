2
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,961
My name is Soyan
Schwartz, and I am

3
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:21,795
an Internet Activist.

4
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,767
I have infiltrated the
IT systems of numerous

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,304
government agencies
and corporations.

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,005
Over the years I have sought out

7
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,842
to expose classified
information.

8
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:36,943
Today I found
something that requires

9
00:00:36,976 --> 00:00:38,879
immediate disclosure.

10
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:43,117
Today many companies
are trying to rewrite

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,686
our history and alter
the truth, the truth,

12
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:47,487
the truth, the truth....

13
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:54,195
Well it looks like
another wet one, folks.

14
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:56,196
Get your umbrellas
and your booties

15
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,131
if you're going out.

16
00:00:57,163 --> 00:00:58,365
Possible thunderstorms...

17
00:00:58,398 --> 00:01:00,033
Three suspects now
wanted in the murder of

18
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:02,203
the Victoria girl found
last week in the river.

19
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:05,072
Though their website
has not gone offline

20
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:07,875
since last month's
attack, Angela King warned

21
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:10,644
of future reprisals
of the security firm

22
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:11,812
pursued independently.

23
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:13,881
Stock Market went
through the roof today.

24
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:15,950
No one seems to have
predicted this, so it's hard

25
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:17,151
to know where it's heading.

26
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:19,819
Noji shares plunged
after a cyber attack

27
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:21,289
shut down several networks in

28
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:23,824
Southeast Asia
yesterday afternoon.

29
00:01:23,857 --> 00:01:26,593
No one has claimed
responsibility for the attack,

30
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:29,229
but sources indicate the
virus may have originated

31
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,031
from servers in China.

32
00:01:31,065 --> 00:01:32,800
And in politics
today, the election

33
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,668
is proving to be a close race.

34
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:36,971
Now I don't mean to
sound cynical, but...

35
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:39,272
...were arrested
on suspicion of

36
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:41,075
the denial of the
service attack.

37
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:43,744
The hacking organization
Independent Leak,

38
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:45,079
denies any involvement.

39
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:46,813
...laughter makes you smile.

40
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:48,114
Well, guess what.

41
00:01:48,147 --> 00:01:50,450
It also raises the
levels of chemicals...

42
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:52,319
The UN and the Arab
League have declared

43
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:54,421
an Embargo against
the impressive regime.

44
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:57,325
Light and heavy arms continue
to flow into the region.

45
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:58,759
Traffic is backed up,
there's an accident

46
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:00,695
on the freeway that
hasn't been cleared yet.

47
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:02,229
And everyone is
stopping to look.

48
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:04,965
Internet Activist Angela
King is still at large,

49
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:06,533
though Interpol has
traced her movements

50
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:07,667
to South America.

51
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,935
Thanks for the news.

52
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,838
We've got a lot of great
music coming up for you

53
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,406
in just a few minutes.

54
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:17,412
(fast-paced music)

55
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:54,815
Here he is.

56
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,519
Over here, sit down.

57
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:05,726
I'm Lena Lebovitz.

58
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:08,362
This is my partner,
Russel Beleon.

59
00:03:08,394 --> 00:03:10,297
Our lawyer, Clift Brown.

60
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:20,440
We asked you in here
today, because recently

61
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:22,777
something very serious
happened at our company.

62
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,678
Most of our clients
sign on for our services

63
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:29,217
online, it's about 200 a day.

64
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,586
So you can imagine our
surprise Friday morning when

65
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:34,821
our server crashed
after millions

66
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:37,257
of new users registered.

67
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,727
We know it was a hack.

68
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:45,165
We lost a few big clients,
that's what happened.

69
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,503
All because a few kids
wanted to have some fun.

70
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:54,374
Good thing is, when
someone hacks a system,

71
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:58,545
there's always the
possibility of getting caught.

72
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:02,283
And you know how DA's
like to make an example

73
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:04,485
out of some stupid kid.

74
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:06,187
Especially if they
connect the bust

75
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:08,054
to National Security issues.

76
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:11,726
We did find a few IP
addresses and traced them.

77
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:15,462
Hopefully that's how
we'll get our guy.

78
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:23,271
We know.

79
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:26,174
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

80
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:32,947
We represent a lot of
high profile clients here.

81
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:35,917
They rely on us to
create new identities,

82
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:40,987
change facts, rewrite
history, so to speak.

83
00:04:42,855 --> 00:04:45,125
How would you like
to go to work for us?

84
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:49,063
You already know our system.

85
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:55,670
Great, I'll take that as a yes.

86
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:02,676
The arms trafficking
ring has been tied

87
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,677
to a consortium of
front companies,

88
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:07,381
owned by businessman
and entrepreneur,

89
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:08,848
Haans Vanderbilt.

90
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:10,718
A number of unarmed
civilians were made

91
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,786
to lay down on the road outside.

92
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:14,622
This is what followed.

93
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:18,392
(sounds of gunfire)

94
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:52,425
After issuing a comprehensive
report on violations

95
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,562
of the Embargo, Human
Search founder Alice Carson

96
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:57,797
may finally have
her day in court.

97
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:59,566
ICC judges rule
on Monday whether

98
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,102
the case may proceed.

99
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:22,456
(phone vibrating)

100
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:47,647
Here are a few
photos of the victims.

101
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:57,490
You can match them, online
photographs and videos,

102
00:06:58,391 --> 00:07:02,529
through what you call
facial recognition software?

103
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:08,701
We will then make
positive IDs and create

104
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:11,237
a master list of addresses and

105
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:14,175
group them into families.

106
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:19,814
How many people are there?

107
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:21,816
This will take weeks.

108
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:24,884
Here's a file with
names and addresses,

109
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:26,720
we don't have everything.

110
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:28,588
That's why I need you.

111
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:31,958
Who else has access to this?

112
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:33,793
No one, just you and me.

113
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:35,763
Why, is something wrong?

114
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:38,131
How do we make any
money with this?

115
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:40,900
I still have a
donor or two left,

116
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:43,636
but I'm takin' a lot of heat.

117
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,571
From who?

118
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:48,609
From people who know how to

119
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:50,477
pick the locks on my office.

120
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:07,828
(slow rock music)

121
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:00,314
Sorry.

122
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:05,052
I was setting up the
code for the firewall.

123
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:10,458
OK, shall we?

124
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,695
This is Teco, Fortune 500.

125
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:18,665
The CEO John Chester just
died at the age of 87,

126
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:21,901
his son James is set
to inherit his job.

127
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:25,105
His wife is the problem.

128
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:27,440
We discovered that in the
90's she made a number of

129
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:30,810
soft core films under
the name, Bella Blue.

130
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:34,014
Jump to 2000, fell
completely off the grid.

131
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:39,052
Got plastic surgery and
became Mrs. James Chester.

132
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:41,322
Does the husband know?

133
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,490
No, not fully.

134
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:46,160
Now they have three
children, host political

135
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:47,561
fundraisers and
sit on the board of

136
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:49,563
several major charities.

137
00:09:49,762 --> 00:09:53,166
So, who wants us to
clean up their past?

138
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:57,438
Teco, the Board of Directors
is naturally concerned.

139
00:09:58,103 --> 00:09:59,405
Let's see.

140
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:05,812
She's still got some fan pages.

141
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:10,083
Is that her?

142
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:12,486
(moaning)

143
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,321
Yes, that's her.

144
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:17,458
We're gonna need a good
back story for this one.

145
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:22,796
Let's kill her off.

146
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:25,800
What do you mean, kill her off?

147
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:28,968
Start a rumor online,
Bella Blue died

148
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:32,039
in a car crash,
suicide, whatever.

149
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:36,744
Plant some articles,
fabricate some photos,

150
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,047
and build a paper trail
for Mrs. Chester Jr.

151
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:43,918
What about everything in print?

152
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:47,286
The newspaper'll
pick it up and put it

153
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:48,487
on their website.

154
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:50,122
It'll go 'round and
'round from there.

155
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:57,131
OK, let's do it,
pull the trigger.

156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,001
The company has booked
you a hotel suite

157
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,971
so you can work at your leisure.

158
00:11:04,003 --> 00:11:06,105
I'll be by later
to check on things.

159
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:08,641
You have two weeks.

160
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,276
Good luck.

161
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:21,588
Kid does have imagination.

162
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:25,959
We'll see how he
swims with bigger fish.

163
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,062
Clift, you ready?

164
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:34,068
(rock music)

165
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,932
(distant sirens)

166
00:12:56,348 --> 00:13:00,920
(water running)

167
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:07,327
A number of unarmed
civilians were made

168
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:09,795
to lay down on the road outside.

169
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:11,231
This is what followed.

170
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:16,103
(gunfire and screams)

171
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:21,607
Arms dealer Vanderbilt
was arrested then released

172
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,410
after only a few hours.

173
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:24,811
He has been identified by the

174
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:27,713
International Criminal Court
as a person of interest

175
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:30,117
in violating the Embargo.

176
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,185
Over the last 20 years,
Vanderbilt has built

177
00:13:33,218 --> 00:13:36,589
one of the most powerful
arms fortunes in Europe,

178
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:39,258
and also may be responsible
for countless deaths

179
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,128
through illegal
weapons trafficking.

180
00:13:59,145 --> 00:14:01,648
Yeah, I heard the news.

181
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:03,816
Let's talk tomorrow.

182
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:18,464
(hitting punching bag)

183
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,069
I haven't finished.

184
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:58,071
He paid the bond and vanished.

185
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:02,443
Even if we kept our last
donor, I'd still lose the case.

186
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:05,378
They're too strong.

187
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,550
Don't worry you
can pay me later.

188
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,553
Loise, you don't understand.

189
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:15,021
No I don't.

190
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:20,059
(phone rings)

191
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,296
I'll call you, OK?

192
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,635
Yes.

193
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:31,972
I've been wanting to speak
with you for some time.

194
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:34,107
Well, I'd rather
meet you in person.

195
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,376
I'll text you the address
and I'll see ya then.

196
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:38,578
Yes, OK.

197
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:46,152
Hey, come on in.

198
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:55,661
You got your laptop with ya?

199
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:57,263
I wanna show you something.

200
00:15:57,296 --> 00:15:58,230
I had a conference call with

201
00:15:58,264 --> 00:16:00,467
some arms dealers yesterday.

202
00:16:00,766 --> 00:16:02,701
They sold their products
to the wrong side,

203
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:05,404
there was an Embargo,
now they're in trouble.

204
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:08,508
Those are the clients,
there's the front company.

205
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,376
there's the main company.

206
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:14,280
And this one here,
she's the liar.

207
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,415
She filed a complaint with

208
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:18,218
the International
Criminal Court.

209
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:22,389
I tried to sideline her,
but she is stubborn.

210
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:26,660
Anyway, I arranged a
meeting with her for

211
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,395
a job interview tomorrow.

212
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:32,399
Going to throw her
off trail very gently.

213
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,834
What do you want me to do?

214
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:36,736
Make up something good.

215
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:38,471
Tell them they were
there to hand out

216
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:42,107
food, medicine, the
usual, and we need to

217
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:45,312
erase that bank transfer
from the Cayman Islands.

218
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:47,280
I don't know how the hell
she figured that out,

219
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:49,216
but I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it.

220
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:50,783
Pull over here, please.

221
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,789
You think you can handle this?

222
00:16:58,091 --> 00:16:59,259
Good.

223
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:02,962
Just make 'em look
like the good guys.

224
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:05,799
I'll be back in a few minutes.

225
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,072
And there was another
drive by shooting

226
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,040
today downtown, it
appears to be...

227
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:16,909
Vanderbilt's
representatives stated that

228
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:19,445
the wholesaler sold
Ammonium nitrate solely

229
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,514
for agricultural purposes.

230
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:23,783
They declined to comment
on its use in a recent

231
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:25,184
bombing of the Embassy.

232
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:27,586
Vanderbilt's charity raised
over 100 million dollars

233
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,921
in its efforts to
combat the spread

234
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:30,823
of AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa.

235
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:32,959
...been appointed CEO of Teco,

236
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:36,328
North America's largest
food processing conserve.

237
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:39,966
Chester will be granted
two million shares of...

238
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:48,975
Hey.

239
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:02,922
What are you doing
here all the time?

240
00:18:02,954 --> 00:18:04,290
Near a cell.

241
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:07,093
Need a good wireless reception.

242
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:12,398
You work in high tech?

243
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:14,300
Not really.

244
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,503
I'm more interested in history.

245
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:18,238
What kinda history?

246
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:20,440
I don't know, people?

247
00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:24,645
I'm more interested
in technology.

248
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:27,446
You're a game tester?

249
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:29,750
I'm a player.

250
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:33,053
Look.

251
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:38,658
ICMP protocol 873DFS3.

252
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:43,829
Key log the pass code
from the database Cash.

253
00:18:43,863 --> 00:18:45,799
Bypass the honey pot.

254
00:18:49,368 --> 00:18:51,271
Check for Admins.

255
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:56,510
Done, I'm in.

256
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:58,944
Inside of what?

257
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:00,514
Bank of Kilnay.

258
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,281
What should I do?

259
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:05,952
I don't know, hack a real bank.

260
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:07,486
We Bonnie and Clyde?

261
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,821
We're not.

262
00:19:10,455 --> 00:19:12,626
You know why a computer's
so easy to hack?

263
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:16,496
They were never designed
for the Internet.

264
00:19:17,262 --> 00:19:19,098
It's their ultimate weakness.

265
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:22,802
I don't think people are
made for the Internet either.

266
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:27,107
Personally, I don't
trust computers.

267
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,641
But you have one.

268
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,712
Yeah, what choice do you have?

269
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:33,914
What do you choose?

270
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:41,320
No viruses, no batteries.

271
00:19:41,354 --> 00:19:44,991
Never crashes, very reliable.

272
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:48,328
I could store a thousand
of those on my keydrive.

273
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:50,997
Yeah, you're just
out of this world.

274
00:19:51,864 --> 00:19:53,767
I didn't mean to upset you.

275
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:55,801
Where are you going?

276
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,963
(knock at the door)

277
00:20:36,075 --> 00:20:39,513
Russel sent me over to
see how you settled in.

278
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,216
And I brought the
files you requested.

279
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,300
You know, I was against
hiring you at first.

280
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:05,604
But now I'm just as
impressed as Russel is.

281
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:11,744
Do you mind?

282
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:19,553
I can't stand those heels.

283
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:27,960
Would you?

284
00:21:46,412 --> 00:21:49,082
You don't have much
experience with women, do you.

285
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:56,322
It's OK.

286
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:03,762
Lean back.

287
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:07,466
It's OK.

288
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,848
Ya know,

289
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:31,057
I've been wondering
what turns you on.

290
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:37,597
Cyber sex?

291
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,176
Double jab to the
body, a couple short.

292
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,146
Oh, but that uppercut,
it lands hard

293
00:22:53,178 --> 00:22:54,546
to the side of the face.

294
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:56,648
Our challenger is
reeling, he's trying

295
00:22:56,682 --> 00:22:57,884
to find his footing.

296
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,851
Oh, their tied up in
the center of the ring.

297
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:01,921
Now there, there's a jab,
there's a combination.

298
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:04,089
A left and then the
right, oh and there's

299
00:23:04,123 --> 00:23:06,693
a hard uppercut,
hard to the jaw.

300
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:08,493
Our challenger is reeling.

301
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:10,363
Then he comes back
with a counter punch.

302
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:13,232
It's going left, to the right,
a hard one to the temple.

303
00:23:13,264 --> 00:23:14,934
Oh, that's gotta hurt, folks.

304
00:23:14,966 --> 00:23:17,136
We are getting our money's
worth, this fight is

305
00:23:17,168 --> 00:23:18,604
going down to the wire.

306
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:19,237
(dinging)

307
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:20,373
Hey sis.

308
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:22,274
How've you been?

309
00:23:22,974 --> 00:23:26,445
Fine, are you OK?

310
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:29,415
Just dealin' with my new flat.

311
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:31,785
Still in New York?

312
00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:35,088
Well, you know, it's been hard.

313
00:23:37,088 --> 00:23:38,390
You need money?

314
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:41,895
I wanna see you.

315
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:45,932
Why don't you ever call me?

316
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:50,469
I'll call you if
anything comes up, OK?

317
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:58,744
Oh, they're tied up in
the center of the ring.

318
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:09,789
(fast-paced music)

319
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,746
Do you normally have
meetings at your house?

320
00:24:33,713 --> 00:24:38,451
Normally, no, but
when it's confidential.

321
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:39,985
So let's get to it.

322
00:24:41,753 --> 00:24:42,855
You said we both have some

323
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:45,157
valuable information to share?

324
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:46,626
Did I say that?

325
00:24:47,193 --> 00:24:48,662
Well you called me 10 times,

326
00:24:49,595 --> 00:24:50,896
so I'd like to know.

327
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,299
OK, fair enough.

328
00:24:53,531 --> 00:24:56,202
I'm a head hunter, and
I'm looking to recruit

329
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:58,170
some one for our
high tech company.

330
00:24:58,203 --> 00:25:00,040
I don't work in
the high tech field.

331
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:02,875
Do you know anything
about hackers?

332
00:25:02,907 --> 00:25:05,844
Anything about criminal
investigations?

333
00:25:06,145 --> 00:25:09,081
I do know about criminals,
but only in relations

334
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:10,583
to Human Rights.

335
00:25:10,782 --> 00:25:12,751
That's why I
noticed your profile.

336
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:16,723
Do you know why Babylon fell?

337
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:19,358
Too much information.

338
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:21,627
Too many languages.

339
00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:24,196
A breakdown of communications,

340
00:25:25,063 --> 00:25:27,032
and that's where we are today.

341
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:30,969
What we don't need
is another Babylon.

342
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:33,138
That's why I think
it's important to apply

343
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:37,010
International Human Rights
Standards to the Internet.

344
00:25:38,877 --> 00:25:43,782
Seriously, I'm in bad shape.

345
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,790
I guess I came at
the right time then.

346
00:25:52,892 --> 00:25:56,996
Tell me, how much would
you like to earn per year?

347
00:25:58,062 --> 00:25:59,531
What do you mean?

348
00:26:00,132 --> 00:26:05,138
I mean, give me a number
if your dreams came true.

349
00:26:07,572 --> 00:26:09,742
If my dreams came true.

350
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:35,934
Sorry, I missed my bus.

351
00:26:41,072 --> 00:26:43,376
You like the water, do
you wanna take a dip?

352
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:46,445
I don't know how to swim.

353
00:26:46,878 --> 00:26:48,680
A computer hacker
that doesn't drive

354
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:50,817
and doesn't swim,
true modern man.

355
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,417
Come on, your parents
never taught you

356
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:53,620
how to swim?

357
00:26:55,253 --> 00:26:56,790
I never had parents.

358
00:27:01,594 --> 00:27:03,396
Do you have any
relatives at all?

359
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:09,202
Well look at the advantages,
you're a free man.

360
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:11,771
No roots, you can do
whatever the hell you like.

361
00:27:15,406 --> 00:27:17,409
What about you,
you got any family?

362
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,714
I do whatever the
hell I like as well.

363
00:27:24,683 --> 00:27:26,219
I wanna ask you something,
have you heard about

364
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:28,488
this hacking group
Independent Leak?

365
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:32,090
What you know about 'em?

366
00:27:33,524 --> 00:27:36,261
I know they're tough,
radical, they hack into

367
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:39,898
corporations,
banks, governments.

368
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:41,568
That means us too.

369
00:27:43,068 --> 00:27:44,703
They intend on
releasing millions of

370
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:47,072
classified emails that
we don't want going out.

371
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:49,576
We've gotta do whatever
it takes to stop them.

372
00:27:51,443 --> 00:27:53,045
I'll look into it.

373
00:27:53,078 --> 00:27:54,480
I've got a name for ya.

374
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:59,017
Angela King, apparently
the ring leader.

375
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,620
We don't have much
information on her.

376
00:28:01,654 --> 00:28:03,155
No fixed address.

377
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:05,790
Always on the move.

378
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:07,525
Sometimes we spot her
name on flight manifests,

379
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,295
but always a little too late.

380
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:11,631
Maybe she works
for the Chinese.

381
00:28:12,231 --> 00:28:15,099
No, no she's a freelancer.

382
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:19,638
How's our Firewall?

383
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:24,309
It's safe... now.

384
00:28:24,876 --> 00:28:26,078
Good.

385
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:31,917
Because we can't
take any chances.

386
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:36,755
Let's go inside, I wanna
give you somethin'.

387
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:43,997
You've got no excuse
to be late now.

388
00:28:45,196 --> 00:28:46,965
We're both on company time.

389
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:50,168
Thank you.

390
00:28:51,736 --> 00:28:53,105
How you gettin' home?

391
00:28:53,438 --> 00:28:55,607
I'll just catch the bus.

392
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:58,645
Here, take my car
that's in the drive.

393
00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:04,784
Let's just say, it's an
advance for this next job.

394
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:15,795
(car engine starts)

395
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:38,284
Hey, the door was open.

396
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:40,286
My door is always open.

397
00:29:41,587 --> 00:29:43,356
I brought your stuff back.

398
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:44,790
Look at you!

399
00:29:50,428 --> 00:29:54,533
Which is, oh, Life Against
Death, Norman O'Brown.

400
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,569
One of Jim Morrison's favorites.

401
00:30:04,076 --> 00:30:06,813
Nice to see how this
place never changes.

402
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:13,886
I haven't read this one, may I?

403
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:14,786
Uh huh.

404
00:30:25,731 --> 00:30:27,165
Coffee?

405
00:30:42,614 --> 00:30:45,050
You look worried,
what's going on?

406
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:49,789
Still no news about him?

407
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:51,924
No.

408
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:57,530
It's over.

409
00:30:57,729 --> 00:31:00,600
You know that's not the
case, it's part of you.

410
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:05,804
And there's always a
chance for good news.

411
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:09,541
I don't know.

412
00:31:13,678 --> 00:31:15,514
So, how 'bout you?

413
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:17,916
I'm putting finishing
touches on my book

414
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,519
about this hedge fund that
dabbled in the drug trade.

415
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:23,755
I'm gonna call it Powder
Brokers, or Wall of Powder,

416
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:25,324
I don't know, I
haven't decided yet.

417
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:27,559
Sounds like Pulitzer material.

418
00:31:27,592 --> 00:31:30,095
Oh, I'm not gettin' that.

419
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:35,734
You're my only friend.

420
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:37,936
Why don't you take a break?

421
00:31:38,203 --> 00:31:39,704
Get out outta town?

422
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:43,742
(phone vibrating)

423
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:48,080
I'll think about it, gotta run.

424
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:35,127
(commentating a boxing match)

425
00:32:39,764 --> 00:32:42,100
(door opens)

426
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:47,439
(commentating a boxing match)

427
00:32:50,943 --> 00:32:52,310
You texted me your
address, so I assumed

428
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:54,013
it was an invitation.

429
00:33:05,723 --> 00:33:06,893
Wait.

430
00:33:07,392 --> 00:33:11,764
(commentating a boxing match)

431
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:32,417
You don't drink?

432
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:51,369
I've never really met
a girl like you before.

433
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:54,339
Why are you telling me this?

434
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:00,579
I don't know,
you seem friendly.

435
00:34:00,945 --> 00:34:02,814
Don't try to label this.

436
00:34:02,848 --> 00:34:04,282
I'm not.

437
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,921
I like your company, but my
text wasn't a proposition.

438
00:34:11,656 --> 00:34:12,925
Sure.

439
00:34:17,062 --> 00:34:18,431
So you box?

440
00:34:19,564 --> 00:34:23,803
Yeah, wanna try?

441
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:26,671
No, I'm sure you're
too strong for me.

442
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:32,011
Do you play any video games?

443
00:34:33,077 --> 00:34:36,047
Not anymore, that's kid stuff.

444
00:34:40,017 --> 00:34:41,519
I'm playing all the time.

445
00:34:44,055 --> 00:34:46,224
I created a game that
combines virtual reality,

446
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:49,194
telepathy, and the real world.

447
00:34:51,062 --> 00:34:52,231
I'll show you.

448
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,867
Basically in any
room I can create

449
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,369
a chess board, 64 squares.

450
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:02,040
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,

451
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:05,343
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

452
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:06,812
Now match all the
objects up as if the game

453
00:35:06,845 --> 00:35:08,247
is already in motion.

454
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,084
So, the coffee maker could
be one of your knights.

455
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:16,856
And those glasses over
there could be your pawns.

456
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,357
Even your eye can
become a piece,

457
00:35:20,024 --> 00:35:21,793
rooks, bishops...

458
00:35:22,693 --> 00:35:26,364
...king, queen.

459
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:28,200
You follow me?

460
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:31,036
Not really.

461
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:32,271
Close your eyes.

462
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:40,578
All right, let's begin,
simply with a pawn.

463
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:44,050
I'd do E2, E4.

464
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,185
Now your turn.

465
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:51,390
Try N, G, A, F, six.

466
00:35:55,026 --> 00:35:55,961
Follow me?

467
00:35:58,129 --> 00:36:00,698
OK, this is my knight.

468
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:02,233
I'm gonna move it towards you.

469
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,136
I do N, G, A, F, six.

470
00:36:06,638 --> 00:36:08,874
No, no, no, no, don't do that.

471
00:36:08,906 --> 00:36:10,341
But I didn't do anything.

472
00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:14,579
It's telepathy, between
you and me, you feel it?

473
00:36:17,214 --> 00:36:20,553
Trust it, it's all there,
just let me guide you.

474
00:36:20,752 --> 00:36:24,990
Take my pawn, and I
move my pawn, D2, D3.

475
00:36:31,162 --> 00:36:31,963
Now.

476
00:36:32,464 --> 00:36:34,533
N, A4, C5.

477
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:35,768
Hey, how'd you do that?

478
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:36,969
Concentrate.

479
00:36:37,002 --> 00:36:40,839
All right, I do Q, D1, E2.

480
00:36:40,872 --> 00:36:41,807
What do you do?

481
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,374
Q, seven, E.

482
00:36:43,408 --> 00:36:44,610
Yes!

483
00:36:44,642 --> 00:36:49,414
(conversation muffled by music)

484
00:36:49,448 --> 00:36:51,683
OK, I can't focus anymore.

485
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:53,986
That's fine, you
really know how

486
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:55,687
to visualize the game!

487
00:36:59,857 --> 00:37:01,526
Yeah, it's like
with permutations

488
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,828
or identifying the password.

489
00:37:04,662 --> 00:37:08,199
Each move has a limited
number of combinations.

490
00:37:08,232 --> 00:37:09,401
I get that.

491
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:10,803
I'm impressed.

492
00:37:11,202 --> 00:37:12,338
Don't be.

493
00:37:26,051 --> 00:37:27,753
Do you mind if I crash here?

494
00:37:46,504 --> 00:37:50,809
(suspenseful music)

495
00:38:26,243 --> 00:38:30,950
(heavy breathing)

496
00:39:53,564 --> 00:39:55,099
I had a dream last night.

497
00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:58,503
Really.

498
00:40:00,037 --> 00:40:01,406
Yeah, you were in it.

499
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,842
No kidding.

500
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:12,184
I gotta go.

501
00:40:19,557 --> 00:40:21,093
When can I see you again?

502
00:40:33,138 --> 00:40:34,340
Thanks for-

503
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:36,341
-Thank you for what?

504
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,962
So how often do
they see each other?

505
00:40:58,129 --> 00:40:59,464
I don't know.

506
00:40:59,863 --> 00:41:01,232
I thought you kept tabs on him.

507
00:41:01,265 --> 00:41:02,200
I do.

508
00:41:04,903 --> 00:41:07,039
The kid is young and naive.

509
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:09,074
We took a huge risk with him.

510
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:12,111
So, what about this girl?

511
00:41:12,544 --> 00:41:13,946
She's young too.

512
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:19,651
I think she's a nobody,
but here's something

513
00:41:19,684 --> 00:41:24,689
you're not gonna like,
apparently she was working for

514
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:27,126
my new lawyer friend.

515
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:31,664
Really.

516
00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:34,599
I told ya you
weren't gonna like it.

517
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:39,471
And you think it's
just a coincidence that

518
00:41:39,504 --> 00:41:41,306
they happen to work
for each other?

519
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:44,843
Maybe she's spying on us.

520
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:46,178
I doubt it, Lena.

521
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:47,812
Listen, I'll figure it out.

522
00:41:47,845 --> 00:41:51,115
I'll contain the problem,
don't worry about it.

523
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:56,287
So what did your new
lawyer friend say about her?

524
00:41:57,555 --> 00:42:01,326
She said that the girl
wasn't a problem, but I had to

525
00:42:04,595 --> 00:42:06,130
dig a little deeper.

526
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,100
And?

527
00:42:10,868 --> 00:42:12,437
And I fucked her.

528
00:42:18,443 --> 00:42:19,845
You fucked the lawyer?

529
00:42:19,877 --> 00:42:21,479
Yes, I fucked the lawyer.

530
00:42:21,513 --> 00:42:23,449
It's just business, Lena.

531
00:42:25,048 --> 00:42:26,784
Are you proud of
yourself, Russ?

532
00:42:28,553 --> 00:42:30,288
I think she's in love with me.

533
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:32,223
There's nothing I
can do about it.

534
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:36,194
She wanted a job.

535
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:38,664
Maybe.

536
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:46,271
You know, you
believe in yourself

537
00:42:46,303 --> 00:42:47,805
a little bit too much, Russ.

538
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:53,812
And what's worse, you
believe your own lies.

539
00:42:56,548 --> 00:42:58,149
I guess that's how you made it.

540
00:43:07,158 --> 00:43:11,997
(jet engine)

541
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:15,734
Listen, we're working on it.

542
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:16,935
You're workin' on who.

543
00:43:16,968 --> 00:43:18,504
Angela King.

544
00:43:18,702 --> 00:43:21,405
None of us want
those email released.

545
00:43:21,606 --> 00:43:23,374
The kid found out
some information,

546
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:26,211
she's on a flight next week.

547
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,346
Take care of it.

548
00:43:29,747 --> 00:43:30,982
Good.

549
00:43:35,053 --> 00:43:36,455
(knock on the door)

550
00:43:37,988 --> 00:43:39,191
Hey.

551
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,926
I need a drink.

552
00:44:07,685 --> 00:44:10,589
How would you play your
game in this hotel suite?

553
00:44:13,024 --> 00:44:17,162
A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

554
00:44:17,194 --> 00:44:18,963
I thought you
weren't interested.

555
00:44:20,265 --> 00:44:21,633
I can win.

556
00:44:24,102 --> 00:44:28,874
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

557
00:44:28,906 --> 00:44:30,441
Whites or blacks, you choose.

558
00:44:32,776 --> 00:44:33,611
This one.

559
00:44:34,912 --> 00:44:36,080
You start.

560
00:44:37,848 --> 00:44:40,352
E2, E4.

561
00:44:40,551 --> 00:44:42,421
C7, C5.

562
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,089
N, G1, F3.

563
00:44:46,823 --> 00:44:48,426
Hold on, let me
show you something.

564
00:44:50,894 --> 00:44:52,296
What's that?

565
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,632
Just put it on.

566
00:44:54,231 --> 00:44:55,499
What is that?

567
00:45:04,975 --> 00:45:07,546
One, two, three.

568
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,714
You see something?

569
00:45:09,747 --> 00:45:11,515
It's beautiful!

570
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,419
It's a virtual reality program.

571
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:17,388
Here, go like that,
haven't actually done this

572
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:19,523
with two pairs of
glasses before.

573
00:45:20,024 --> 00:45:23,629
OK, same thing, concentrate.

574
00:45:24,028 --> 00:45:25,030
You with me?

575
00:45:25,263 --> 00:45:26,164
Yeah.

576
00:45:26,196 --> 00:45:28,633
N, B8, C6.

577
00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:31,303
N, B1, C3.

578
00:45:31,336 --> 00:45:33,238
N, G8, F6.

579
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:35,039
Q, D4, D8.

580
00:45:35,872 --> 00:45:37,441
Where's the king?

581
00:45:37,774 --> 00:45:39,843
K, E7, E6.

582
00:45:39,877 --> 00:45:41,713
E3, E2.

583
00:45:42,113 --> 00:45:47,118
B, F1, B5, as ordered my queen.

584
00:45:48,285 --> 00:45:49,354
Checkmate.

585
00:45:49,386 --> 00:45:50,856
Indeed.

586
00:45:51,722 --> 00:45:53,657
I think you lost intentionally.

587
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:55,160
Oh yeah?

588
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:04,502
What are we doing.

589
00:46:17,381 --> 00:46:19,283
Listen, we're working on it.

590
00:46:19,316 --> 00:46:20,517
You're working on who?

591
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:22,054
Angela King.

592
00:46:22,419 --> 00:46:24,722
None of us want those
emails released.

593
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:27,059
The kid found out
some information,

594
00:46:27,758 --> 00:46:29,693
she's on a flight next week.

595
00:46:29,727 --> 00:46:33,565
(noise of an airplane crashing)

596
00:46:39,303 --> 00:46:42,272
In just a second, it was
completely hidden in a

597
00:46:42,305 --> 00:46:44,675
cloud of a combination
of smoke and dust.

598
00:46:44,709 --> 00:46:46,877
The circumstances of
the crash have attracted

599
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:49,646
additional scrutiny, ever
since Internet Activist

600
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,384
Angela King was identified
as one of the passengers.

601
00:47:06,731 --> 00:47:08,533
Talked to Washington
this morning.

602
00:47:10,901 --> 00:47:12,937
Someone got Angela King.

603
00:47:15,073 --> 00:47:16,508
You know who got her?

604
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,111
Makes no difference,
she's out of the picture.

605
00:47:21,711 --> 00:47:23,948
Gotta be careful what's next.

606
00:47:25,015 --> 00:47:27,885
We have to anticipate
the other guy's move,

607
00:47:27,919 --> 00:47:29,988
kinda like a chess game.

608
00:47:30,655 --> 00:47:31,990
You play?

609
00:47:33,091 --> 00:47:34,092
No.

610
00:47:34,524 --> 00:47:35,894
Well, ya should.

611
00:47:36,093 --> 00:47:40,432
Business, politics, life,
it's all like chess.

612
00:47:40,664 --> 00:47:42,967
You have to always
be two steps ahead.

613
00:48:09,426 --> 00:48:11,695
She is perfect
for a screensaver.

614
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,437
Have you had any dreams lately?

615
00:48:22,939 --> 00:48:25,609
No, just that one time
I crashed at your place.

616
00:48:29,546 --> 00:48:32,083
You see that little
star over there?

617
00:48:33,517 --> 00:48:36,387
On that star are all
the people I love.

618
00:48:50,033 --> 00:48:53,305
Did you see this
one, it's moving.

619
00:48:54,671 --> 00:48:59,677
Yeah a satellite or plane.

620
00:49:07,218 --> 00:49:10,122
Do you think we're a
part of this universe?

621
00:49:15,258 --> 00:49:16,594
Not at all.

622
00:49:26,437 --> 00:49:30,909
(fast-paced rock music)

623
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,982
Who is that?

624
00:52:25,249 --> 00:52:26,384
Nothing.

625
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:27,719
Who is he?

626
00:52:29,053 --> 00:52:30,521
You're jealous?

627
00:52:30,553 --> 00:52:31,588
No.

628
00:52:36,727 --> 00:52:38,062
It's my brother.

629
00:52:43,234 --> 00:52:45,569
He vanished a long time ago.

630
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,138
What happened?

631
00:52:52,376 --> 00:52:56,814
I was at a fair with my
sister and my brother.

632
00:52:58,948 --> 00:53:01,720
Remember those
video game arcades?

633
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,656
I could spend hours
on those machines.

634
00:53:08,892 --> 00:53:13,830
Sometimes my brother
would wander the arcade

635
00:53:13,863 --> 00:53:17,468
while I played, as kids do.

636
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:19,470
How old would he be today?

637
00:53:23,406 --> 00:53:25,075
20-something.

638
00:53:30,214 --> 00:53:31,282
Suppose you've already checked

639
00:53:31,314 --> 00:53:34,084
the juvenile records database.

640
00:53:35,586 --> 00:53:37,354
It's gotta be in
there someplace.

641
00:53:43,894 --> 00:53:45,162
What's his name?

642
00:53:47,363 --> 00:53:48,699
Jeremy.

643
00:53:55,906 --> 00:53:57,342
Here's the website.

644
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:01,245
I can actually search for
you later, if you want.

645
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,416
I have to go.

646
00:54:49,894 --> 00:54:51,963
A number of unarmed
civilians were made

647
00:54:51,995 --> 00:54:53,997
to lay down on the road outside.

648
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:55,366
This is what followed.

649
00:54:55,399 --> 00:54:59,002
(screaming and gunfire)

650
00:54:59,035 --> 00:55:01,238
(picture-taking noises)

651
00:55:08,678 --> 00:55:10,747
You shouldn't
worry about Loise.

652
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:13,251
Well I am concerned.

653
00:55:14,218 --> 00:55:17,055
She's getting to him,
I'm losin' the boy.

654
00:55:22,892 --> 00:55:25,762
Take her out of this, not her.

655
00:55:31,435 --> 00:55:32,804
I don't get it.

656
00:55:34,338 --> 00:55:35,740
You know her, she
used to work for you.

657
00:55:35,772 --> 00:55:37,742
I mean, it's a little
close for comfort.

658
00:55:37,774 --> 00:55:39,242
What the fuck is
going on, are you her

659
00:55:39,276 --> 00:55:41,078
guardian angel or what?

660
00:55:41,678 --> 00:55:45,148
I'll take care of Loise,
don't worry 'bout her.

661
00:55:51,055 --> 00:55:53,825
That still leaves me
with a bigger issue,

662
00:55:56,593 --> 00:55:58,095
what to do with him.

663
00:56:01,097 --> 00:56:06,103
You'll take care of him,
he's your protege, not mine.

664
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:35,232
What's happening, you vanished.

665
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,707
How did my files end
up on your computer?

666
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,008
What are you talking about?

667
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,709
My files ass hole!

668
00:56:45,743 --> 00:56:47,612
I don't know what
you're talking about!

669
00:56:51,247 --> 00:56:52,416
(knife falls to ground)

670
00:56:57,553 --> 00:56:58,622
Who are you?

671
00:56:58,656 --> 00:57:00,558
Who the fuck are you!

672
00:57:01,325 --> 00:57:03,394
You wouldn't believe
me, even if I told you.

673
00:57:05,528 --> 00:57:06,863
I'm sorry.

674
00:57:07,698 --> 00:57:09,767
Get the fuck out of here.

675
00:57:49,339 --> 00:57:51,209
My name is Soyan Schwartz,

676
00:57:52,209 --> 00:57:54,646
and I am an Internet Activist.

677
00:57:56,747 --> 00:57:59,649
I have infiltrated the
IT systems of numerous

678
00:57:59,682 --> 00:58:02,452
government agencies
and corporations.

679
00:58:03,352 --> 00:58:05,488
Over the years, I have
sought out to expose

680
00:58:05,522 --> 00:58:07,425
classified information.

681
00:58:07,457 --> 00:58:08,858
Today I found
something that requires

682
00:58:08,892 --> 00:58:10,461
immediate disclosure.

683
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,696
Today many companies
are trying to rewrite

684
00:58:12,729 --> 00:58:15,032
our history and alter the truth.

685
00:58:15,566 --> 00:58:18,169
As Mau, Lennon, and
others used propaganda for

686
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:21,406
political purposes,
corporations now control...

687
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:24,142
(knock on the door)

688
00:58:29,146 --> 00:58:30,580
(another knock on the door)

689
00:58:49,867 --> 00:58:51,602
What's going on in here?

690
00:58:55,238 --> 00:58:59,510
There are three ways to
escape a bad situation.

691
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:07,184
You can attack your enemy
and fight back, you can

692
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:11,021
defend yourself and limit
the damages, or you can

693
00:59:11,053 --> 00:59:13,390
just kill yourself and
exit the game entirely.

694
00:59:16,026 --> 00:59:17,428
What are you doing?

695
00:59:26,035 --> 00:59:27,871
You're a sweet boy.

696
00:59:29,372 --> 00:59:32,542
Intelligent, even brilliant.

697
00:59:33,609 --> 00:59:35,312
But so naive.

698
00:59:36,213 --> 00:59:39,117
Who sent ya here, Russel?

699
00:59:39,615 --> 00:59:44,021
That girlfriend
of yours, Loise,

700
00:59:44,053 --> 00:59:45,955
has been hacking your computer.

701
00:59:45,988 --> 00:59:47,124
How do you know that?

702
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,992
We have sources.

703
00:59:49,026 --> 00:59:50,895
Who are you spying
on, her or me?

704
00:59:51,727 --> 00:59:55,098
I'm just trying to save
that nice ass of yours.

705
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,136
You've been played.

706
00:59:59,303 --> 01:00:03,007
She doesn't want you,
she wants your files.

707
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:04,274
I don't believe it.

708
01:00:04,307 --> 01:00:06,576
Well you better believe
it, because that is the

709
01:00:06,609 --> 01:00:09,546
only story that's gonna fly
with Russel and his clients.

710
01:00:09,946 --> 01:00:12,316
We still have a lot
of work to do, OK?

711
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,519
Stay away from her.

712
01:00:18,888 --> 01:00:20,357
You've been warned.

713
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,365
(door shuts)

714
01:00:44,347 --> 01:00:48,718
(symphonic music)

715
01:00:55,725 --> 01:01:00,731
Loise, Loise, Loise, answer me!

716
01:01:10,473 --> 01:01:15,111
(vomiting noises)

717
01:01:29,426 --> 01:01:31,395
What are you doing here?

718
01:01:31,428 --> 01:01:34,932
It's OK, it's OK, I'm
gonna get us outta here, OK?

719
01:01:36,934 --> 01:01:38,602
Go away!

720
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,376
You're gonna be OK.

721
01:03:00,383 --> 01:03:01,785
Where are we?

722
01:03:06,756 --> 01:03:08,291
Who are you?

723
01:03:10,026 --> 01:03:11,294
I don't know.

724
01:03:13,463 --> 01:03:17,734
Some time ago, I bonded
with the other hackers.

725
01:03:19,669 --> 01:03:23,040
I started an organization
called Independent Leak.

726
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:32,349
We hit banks, corporations,
police databases,

727
01:03:35,818 --> 01:03:38,421
insurance companies,
everything we could.

728
01:03:41,857 --> 01:03:45,662
Started as a game,
before it got big.

729
01:03:48,097 --> 01:03:52,368
We have millions of
emails and databases

730
01:03:52,401 --> 01:03:54,637
with secrets people
have to know.

731
01:03:55,805 --> 01:03:57,107
About what?

732
01:03:58,475 --> 01:04:00,544
Classified information.

733
01:04:03,814 --> 01:04:05,549
Independent Leak was founded

734
01:04:05,582 --> 01:04:08,252
by a woman, Angela King.

735
01:04:08,285 --> 01:04:10,087
She was killed, right?

736
01:04:10,854 --> 01:04:12,890
She was attracting
too much attention.

737
01:04:16,593 --> 01:04:18,796
Where did you
leave those emails?

738
01:04:19,296 --> 01:04:20,564
I have them.

739
01:04:22,731 --> 01:04:24,434
I have a copy at the hotel,

740
01:04:24,468 --> 01:04:26,370
and a backup somewhere
else, hidden.

741
01:04:29,906 --> 01:04:32,276
I'm gonna release those emails.

742
01:04:32,776 --> 01:04:34,111
I wanna get outta here.

743
01:04:37,214 --> 01:04:38,616
I'm with you.

744
01:04:40,316 --> 01:04:42,519
There's so much more
I wanna tell you.

745
01:05:24,426 --> 01:05:28,966
(mellow music)

746
01:06:40,769 --> 01:06:43,540
See you on the rooftop, 9 p.m.

747
01:07:20,443 --> 01:07:23,546
Look, you think I've
done something wrong, OK.

748
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,482
I may have crossed the line,

749
01:07:26,582 --> 01:07:28,385
I never gave up on the case.

750
01:07:28,718 --> 01:07:30,053
It's too late.

751
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,691
I gave you information
that put you at risk.

752
01:07:33,923 --> 01:07:38,928
See, I erased everything,
no more files, we're all set.

753
01:07:41,765 --> 01:07:43,667
I feel responsible for you.

754
01:07:45,267 --> 01:07:48,405
So if you're planning anything,
you should tell me about it.

755
01:07:48,437 --> 01:07:50,907
It's none of your
business anymore.

756
01:07:52,075 --> 01:07:56,146
It is my business, there
are people after Soyan.

757
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,516
And after you too.

758
01:08:00,917 --> 01:08:02,286
What do you mean?

759
01:08:04,754 --> 01:08:06,623
I know who they
are, and I know what

760
01:08:06,656 --> 01:08:10,427
they're capable of, I
continue the investigation.

761
01:08:11,327 --> 01:08:14,497
I saw pictures,
addresses, and files.

762
01:08:14,731 --> 01:08:18,401
I saw surveillance video
of you and Soyan together.

763
01:08:18,735 --> 01:08:20,371
I thought you should know.

764
01:08:20,704 --> 01:08:22,106
That's why I'm here.

765
01:08:22,538 --> 01:08:27,174
Don't worry about me, I'm off.

766
01:08:28,712 --> 01:08:33,249
(distant sirens)

767
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:35,386
(beeping of ATM buttons)

768
01:08:44,327 --> 01:08:48,065
(busy signal)

769
01:08:56,972 --> 01:09:01,444
(computer beeping)

770
01:09:20,797 --> 01:09:25,401
(helicopter flying overhead)

771
01:09:30,306 --> 01:09:31,742
How did you get in?

772
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:37,681
I pay for this room
and the room next door.

773
01:09:39,047 --> 01:09:40,582
Did you forget?

774
01:09:43,653 --> 01:09:45,388
You're my guest here.

775
01:09:48,725 --> 01:09:49,559
(phone beep)

776
01:09:49,592 --> 01:09:53,797
So, Angela King.

777
01:09:54,062 --> 01:09:57,066
(phone vibrating)

778
01:09:59,636 --> 01:10:00,704
Soyan?

779
01:10:00,736 --> 01:10:05,743
Like the king in a chess game.

780
01:10:08,011 --> 01:10:10,914
And Angela, like
an angel unseen.

781
01:10:12,015 --> 01:10:13,417
I can't hear you.

782
01:10:13,449 --> 01:10:18,354
Create your own avatar,
book hotel rooms and flights

783
01:10:18,387 --> 01:10:21,357
in her name and keep
us chasing someone who

784
01:10:21,391 --> 01:10:23,193
doesn't even exist.

785
01:10:23,892 --> 01:10:25,328
That was clever.

786
01:10:25,762 --> 01:10:27,664
Very clever, indeed.

787
01:10:28,765 --> 01:10:30,868
I underestimated you.

788
01:10:33,869 --> 01:10:37,440
Then, just as we were
about to close in,

789
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:43,046
you kill her off, online,
just like you did Bella Blue.

790
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,150
How'd you find out it was me?

791
01:10:51,587 --> 01:10:53,356
We're on company time.

792
01:11:03,699 --> 01:11:04,633
How much did they pay you

793
01:11:04,667 --> 01:11:06,403
to stop Independent Leak?

794
01:11:08,937 --> 01:11:12,342
How much information
do you have on us?

795
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:18,248
Enough, enough to show how you

796
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,149
manipulated the media.

797
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:23,954
So you left your IP
address intentionally.

798
01:11:24,686 --> 01:11:26,289
That was a red herring.

799
01:11:27,891 --> 01:11:30,461
Big companies often
hire their hackers.

800
01:11:31,293 --> 01:11:33,763
So you come in
like a Trojan horse.

801
01:11:34,931 --> 01:11:39,236
Makes me wonder, how
many more like you

802
01:11:39,269 --> 01:11:42,172
are gonna come out of the
belly of that wooden steed.

803
01:11:45,775 --> 01:11:47,144
More like an army.

804
01:11:48,144 --> 01:11:53,150
Small rooms, Internet cafes,

805
01:11:53,449 --> 01:11:56,753
anywhere there's a
wireless connection.

806
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:59,623
We're faceless.

807
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:04,660
But we have eyes, and
we see everything.

808
01:12:06,562 --> 01:12:08,265
You're gonna lose your queen.

809
01:12:16,105 --> 01:12:17,641
I don't think so.

810
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:22,312
Checkmate.

811
01:12:32,254 --> 01:12:36,959
(slow-paced music)

812
01:12:55,511 --> 01:12:57,548
It goes something like this.

813
01:13:00,717 --> 01:13:03,153
Promising young employee
of high tech company

814
01:13:03,186 --> 01:13:06,523
found dead in hotel
room by heart attack.

815
01:13:08,223 --> 01:13:10,593
It's got a nice ring
to it, don't you think?

816
01:13:12,361 --> 01:13:14,565
And when the authorities
contact me, I'll tell them

817
01:13:15,498 --> 01:13:17,467
how shocking it is.

818
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,171
Why, I just visited
him the night before.

819
01:13:21,204 --> 01:13:25,175
He seemed fine, and in
a short time, a very

820
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:30,213
short time, it won't matter
because you'll be forgotten.

821
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,783
Like everyone else.

822
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:52,202
D4, D8.

823
01:14:05,448 --> 01:14:09,586
(Loise crying)

824
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,575
(noise in the distance)

825
01:14:38,448 --> 01:14:39,915
(noise in the distance)

826
01:14:51,526 --> 01:14:55,097
(sirens)

827
01:15:12,013 --> 01:15:12,781
Where is he?

828
01:15:12,815 --> 01:15:14,051
Cleaning!

829
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:15,418
Where is he?

830
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:16,653
Excuse me?

831
01:15:16,686 --> 01:15:18,688
Did you see a young guy
who was staying here?

832
01:15:18,721 --> 01:15:20,257
He passed away.

833
01:15:21,423 --> 01:15:23,493
Heart attack, they said.

834
01:15:27,497 --> 01:15:29,298
They pick up the body.

835
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:45,649
(rock music)

836
01:16:58,421 --> 01:17:02,559
OK, A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

837
01:17:02,592 --> 01:17:06,196
Three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

838
01:17:06,229 --> 01:17:09,966
One, two, three, four, five.

839
01:17:12,467 --> 01:17:14,303
E4, D8

840
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:18,074
(footsteps)

841
01:17:19,074 --> 01:17:21,177
Where is it, fuck!

842
01:17:22,445 --> 01:17:23,980
Where is it.

843
01:17:33,388 --> 01:17:37,894
(techno music)

844
01:18:15,131 --> 01:18:18,935
(typing on a laptop)

845
01:19:17,726 --> 01:19:20,529
The Commission is set
to investigate the event

846
01:19:20,562 --> 01:19:21,931
that took place here.

847
01:19:21,963 --> 01:19:24,566
It was a long day with
the relatives of hundreds

848
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,035
of other, apparently
unarmed civilians,

849
01:19:27,069 --> 01:19:29,405
who were killed, still
waiting for an official

850
01:19:29,437 --> 01:19:31,240
explanation for their deaths.

851
01:19:36,678 --> 01:19:38,413
We need to disguise
the IP address

852
01:19:38,446 --> 01:19:39,982
before we upload it.

853
01:19:40,449 --> 01:19:41,685
Can you do that?

854
01:19:54,296 --> 01:19:55,664
Go ahead.

855
01:20:03,972 --> 01:20:06,743
Today the activist
organization Independent Link,

856
01:20:06,775 --> 01:20:08,443
released millions of emails

857
01:20:08,476 --> 01:20:11,513
from BL Reputation
Management, a secretive

858
01:20:11,547 --> 01:20:12,882
high tech company.

859
01:20:12,914 --> 01:20:14,816
Though it will take a
long time to fully assess

860
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:17,086
it's impact, the
data dump has already

861
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:20,189
shaken financial markets
and turned Congressional

862
01:20:20,221 --> 01:20:22,858
elections upside down.

863
01:20:22,891 --> 01:20:24,559
A Senate investigation is likely

864
01:20:24,592 --> 01:20:26,261
to be announced later today.

865
01:20:26,294 --> 01:20:29,665
This is it Russel,
I can't cover this.

866
01:20:33,769 --> 01:20:37,539
In a surprising turn of
events, the ICC has recharged

867
01:20:37,573 --> 01:20:40,543
Vanderbilt with
violating the Embargo.

868
01:20:40,575 --> 01:20:44,046
The suspect is currently
in custody, awaiting trial

869
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:47,115
based on evidence
supplied by Alice Carson,

870
01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:49,419
the founder of Human Search.

871
01:20:50,686 --> 01:20:52,688
Two days ago, Soyan
Schwartz, the leader of

872
01:20:52,721 --> 01:20:54,690
the Independent Leak,
was found dead in his

873
01:20:54,722 --> 01:20:56,926
hotel room after an
apparent heart attack.

874
01:20:57,293 --> 01:21:00,296
However, a secret video
recording now reveals that

875
01:21:00,329 --> 01:21:02,565
Mr. Schwartz may have been
murdered in an attempt

876
01:21:02,597 --> 01:21:05,301
to prevent his release
of the classified emails.

877
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:10,939
Today many companies
are trying to rewrite

878
01:21:10,972 --> 01:21:15,944
our history and alter the
truth, as Mau, Lennon,

879
01:21:15,977 --> 01:21:18,815
and others use propaganda
for political goals.

880
01:21:18,847 --> 01:21:20,515
Corporations now control images

881
01:21:20,548 --> 01:21:22,452
for commercial purposes.

882
01:21:23,218 --> 01:21:26,221
We are on the verge of
a new world, in which

883
01:21:26,254 --> 01:21:28,091
objective facts can be
altered in the name of

884
01:21:28,123 --> 01:21:30,193
public relations,
by companies who are

885
01:21:30,226 --> 01:21:31,828
larger than states.

886
01:21:32,227 --> 01:21:35,731
The media is the most
powerful entity in the world.

887
01:21:36,431 --> 01:21:38,800
They have the power to
make the guilty innocent

888
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:41,369
and the innocent
guilty, and that's power

889
01:21:41,403 --> 01:21:44,507
because they control
the minds of the masses.

890
01:21:47,275 --> 01:21:49,111
Those are the
words of Malcolm X.

891
01:21:51,379 --> 01:21:55,150
This is Soyan Schwartz, and
I wish you all good luck.

892
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:12,735
Loise, who'll take charge
of Independent Leak now?

893
01:22:21,342 --> 01:22:25,948
(soothing music)

894
01:23:20,936 --> 01:23:22,839
I'm gonna meet him tomorrow.

895
01:23:24,973 --> 01:23:26,441
I don't know what to say.

896
01:23:30,111 --> 01:23:32,315
You sure you don't
wanna come with me?

897
01:23:33,781 --> 01:23:37,587
No, I'd be too nervous.

898
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:40,289
I don't wanna scare him.

899
01:23:42,857 --> 01:23:43,859
You go.

900
01:23:43,891 --> 01:23:46,862
OK, I'll call you.

901
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:53,535
Loise, I knew you'd never
