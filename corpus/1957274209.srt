about being afraid?

192
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,054
That it's not real.

193
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:42,331
Give me that.

194
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:45,701
Sit down.

195
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:56,011
It's very real, son, fear.

196
00:14:57,545 --> 00:14:58,380
I've seen it.

197
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:03,084
It kills dreams. It kills hope.

198
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:06,021
And there's no running
from it. There's no hiding.

199
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:09,525
It's always going to be there.

200
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:15,029
But you always have a choice.

201
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,569
It's how you use that
fear that matters.

202
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:22,036
Don't let it control you.

203
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:26,942
If you do, it'll take
over, paralyzing you.

204
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:31,412
You never look scared.

205
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:33,649
I hide it better than most.

206
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:35,583
Why?

207
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:38,619
Because I need to be strong.

208
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:41,857
To lift up stuff?

209
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,725
Close.

210
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,633
[wind howling]

211
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:55,636
[Josh] Dad?

212
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,905
[Ethan] Yeah?

213
00:15:58,205 --> 00:15:59,407
I'm always scared.

214
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:03,145
[soft piano music]

215
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:07,549
Come here, son.

216
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:08,482
Wait.

217
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:09,483
No, it's okay, it's okay.

218
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:10,151
All right.

219
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:15,656
You feel that?

220
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,456
Yes.

221
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,160
This is where you are.

222
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:19,795
Dad, that's your heart.

223
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:21,163
I know, I know, listen.

224
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:23,631
You hear it?

225
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:26,602
This is where everyone is.

226
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:28,470
[Josh] Everyone?

227
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,137
Mm-hm.

228
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,806
Even Mia?

229
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,175
Of course.

230
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,208
And Mom too?

231
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:35,077
Yes.

232
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:37,713
And this is where we are.

233
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:44,552
So you see, whenever you're
afraid or alone or scared,

234
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,655
you never really are.

235
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:50,525
We're always right with you.

236
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:54,429
[soft piano music]

237
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,432
Always?

238
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:00,869
Always.

239
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:11,480
[balls striking]

240
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:12,580
Ooh, so close.

241
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:17,085
The night's young,
Mary. The night is young.

242
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:19,154
In other news,
the Halifax Energy

Processing Plant opened today.

244
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:24,558
However, the surrounding mountain
communities are concerned

245
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:28,128
with the toxic waste generated
and its environmental impact

246
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:30,665
on the area's water supply.

00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:33,501

250
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:47,148
Ooh, what happened?

251
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:48,683
What happened, distracted?

252
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:50,017
Hardly.

253
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,720
I'm gonna need more than
this if I'm to entertain

254
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:53,621
Grizzly Addams' approach
here in a second.

255
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,290
Oh yeah, he looks
like a hugger.

256
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:56,557
Uh-huh.

257
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,727
Hey, do you think they
make those vodka tonics?

258
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,296
Did they have it the
last time you asked?

259
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:02,097
[Mary] On your tab?

260
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:03,231
Fine.

261
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:07,202
[instrumental country music]

262
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:11,572
Hey, uh, excuse you.

263
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:14,609
Uh, look, asshole.

264
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:16,877
Are you done?

265
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:17,746
Are you?

266
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:22,283
As I recall, I placed this
exact quarter, right here,

267
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:24,251
reserving my spot to play next.

268
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:26,220
How do you know
that one's yours?

269
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:28,190
Lucky sevens.

270
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:30,591
Wow, okay.

271
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:32,694
Look, guy.

272
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:33,894
Ethan.

273
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:36,598
Ethan, my friend
and I are here

274
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,865
just trying to have some fun.

275
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:39,934
I'll prove that it's lucky.

276
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:41,302
How are you gonna do that?

277
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:45,205
Well, if I can guess
your name in three tr...

278
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,675
One try.

279
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:47,775
Mm-hm.

280
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:49,310
You have to go out with me.

281
00:18:50,877 --> 00:18:52,280
What do I get if you're wrong?

282
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:59,320
That's a lotta faith in a
shiny, tiny little thing.

283
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:00,789
Well I'll have you
know we've been known

284
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:02,623
to think very highly
of tiny things.

285
00:19:05,393 --> 00:19:06,728
What do you say?

286
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:09,097
Mm, okay.

287
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:13,234
All right, I'll be
needing this, and that hand.

288
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:15,270
Uh.

289
00:19:17,405 --> 00:19:18,240
Sh.

290
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:22,844
No, that's not it.

291
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:25,847
Hm.

292
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:31,185
Josephine.

293
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:33,188
You [laughs].

294
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:36,624
So why don't you go
ahead and put your number

295
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:38,158
on this and be
expecting my call?

296
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:39,027
Mm-hm.

297
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:41,128
How'd you know?

298
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:47,636
You have a tab open,
and I know the bartender.

299
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:53,675
See you soon, Joe.

300
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:58,146
Speaking of charming.

301
00:19:58,178 --> 00:19:59,313
You shut up.

302
00:19:59,347 --> 00:20:00,348
Oh my God.

303
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:03,385
So, how'd I do?

304
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:04,819
Very smooth actually.

305
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:06,320
Mm, kinda.

306
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:09,190
Kinda? Get over here,
what are you talking about?

307
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:10,892
That's some of my best
stuff, and the quarter bit,

308
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:12,226
gotta admit that was genius.

309
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,695
You two still play
this game from college.

310
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:16,264
You guys are gross.

311
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:17,799
It's good to
see you too, Mary.

312
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:19,266
Here, take that for me.

313
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,637
Please, because I gotta, come
on, Rico Suave, let's go.

314
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:25,040
Okay, I see how it is.

315
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,876
Wow.

316
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:30,678
Mm.

318
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:35,817
Charming.

319
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:36,684
- Mm.
- Oh.

320
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:38,419
Careful.

321
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:39,453
What?

322
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:40,954
That's how we got two.

323
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:42,724
I told you I'm feeling lucky.

324
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:45,193
You hear anything back
from the hospital?

325
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:50,464
No, no, I don't know if
they're still interviewing or

326
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:52,767
they made a decision or cut
the position, I don't know.

327
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,136
I just hate waiting.

328
00:20:57,137 --> 00:20:59,441
I don't what we're
gonna do, Ethan.

329
00:20:59,473 --> 00:21:01,742
It'll be fine.

330
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,211
We're gonna be fine.

331
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:04,378
We're all behind you, baby.

332
00:21:07,514 --> 00:21:09,117
Besides, I can hop
on one of those crews

333
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:11,485
they're putting
together up north.

334
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,787
Yeah, but it's so far out,

335
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:14,455
and then you're gone
a few days a week.

336
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:17,693
I can catch up on all those
books on tape you got me.

337
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:19,961
You haven't even started them.

338
00:21:19,993 --> 00:21:23,063
Honey, my life
is a page-turner.

339
00:21:23,097 --> 00:21:24,264
You are ridiculous.

00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:25,099

you blacked out.

Good idea.

360
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:16,877
How many rounds left?

361
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:18,880
Not enough. Rifle?

Same.

I can pull what's left in
the truck's tank for Mia.

00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,293
I'll melt some dust. We'll
have some fresh water.

366

A fire?

367
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:35,463
We'll control it.

368
00:23:36,163 --> 00:23:37,999
We'll keep it small and hidden.

Ethan?

373
00:23:57,318 --> 00:23:58,453
I can go on a run tonight,

374
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:00,888
and I can start to
replenish what we lost.

375
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:02,423
That should give us
at least a few days

376
00:24:02,455 --> 00:24:03,491
to figure things out.

377
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:08,029
We just gotta hold
out a little longer.

378
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:09,930
We don't have a few days.

379
00:24:11,598 --> 00:24:14,468
And if we siphon what's left
in the truck, then I...

380
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:20,608
Nobody's coming, Ethan.

381
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:23,011
They've given up.

382
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:29,184
What are you doing?

383
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,152
Pulling what's in
that tank for her.

384
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:33,954
We've already searched
and siphoned everything

385
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:35,657
within a 25-mile radius.

386
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,658
Then I'll go out further.

387
00:24:36,691 --> 00:24:38,927
What, further like that?

388
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,662
How much more are
you willing to lose?

389
00:24:43,263 --> 00:24:44,598
Ethan, there's a full
tank in the truck.

390
00:24:44,632 --> 00:24:46,501
There's half in our generator.

391
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:48,201
It'll give us a few
days to relocate.

392
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:49,036
Where?

393
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:50,271
The border.

394
00:24:50,303 --> 00:24:51,071
You know what they're
doing to people there,

395
00:24:51,105 --> 00:24:52,272
and now with, Mia...

396
00:24:52,306 --> 00:24:53,207
But once they see
what's happened.

397
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,409
They know what's happened.

398
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:55,209
Okay, well, where
are they, Ethan?

399
00:24:55,242 --> 00:24:56,144
They told us to wait.

400
00:24:56,176 --> 00:24:57,078
But where are they, Ethan?

401
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,312
They said they'd be here.

402
00:24:58,346 --> 00:24:59,113
Ethan, where are
they are? You said...

403
00:24:59,146 --> 00:25:03,952
I don't know, Joe!

404
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:09,290
I don't know, Joe.

405
00:25:09,322 --> 00:25:11,692
[wind howling]

406
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:23,671
[exhaling]

407
00:25:28,742 --> 00:25:31,378
[wind howling]

408
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:34,149
[hard breathing]

409
00:25:49,163 --> 00:25:52,500
[footsteps approaching]

410
00:25:56,803 --> 00:25:59,573
[hard breathing]

411
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:10,452
They said they'd come for us.

412
00:26:13,553 --> 00:26:14,388
Protect us.

413
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:18,325
[wind howling]

414
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:25,766
You were supposed
to protect us.

415
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:31,271
[soft dramatic music]

416
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:32,774
Do you remember the odds?

417
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:37,711
Curing the infection is a
case-by-case basis, Ethan.

418
00:26:37,744 --> 00:26:40,214
50-50, half.

419
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:43,718
Cure or kill, I remember.

420
00:26:46,753 --> 00:26:48,490
I'm not giving up, Joe.

421
00:26:53,293 --> 00:26:54,261
Do you trust me?

422
00:26:57,164 --> 00:26:57,831
Do you?

423
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:01,236
[soft dramatic music]

424
00:27:03,436 --> 00:27:05,773
[sniffling]

425
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:16,249
I can't anymore.

426
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:19,186
[soft piano music]

427
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:30,397
Can you do this?

428
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,834
[wind howling]

429
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:36,471
Hm?

430
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,242
[Josh] Stop!

431
00:27:43,243 --> 00:27:44,078
Oh God.

432
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,316
I heard yelling,
and I thought...

433
00:27:48,348 --> 00:27:50,184
It's okay, we were
were just talking.

434
00:27:50,216 --> 00:27:53,186
All right, we were just talking.

435
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,822
It's okay, honey.
Come here, come here.

436
00:27:54,855 --> 00:27:58,126
Are you, um, are you hungry?

437
00:27:58,158 --> 00:28:00,794
Well, I ate some beans.

438
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:03,163
And some peaches.

439
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:05,100
Sorry.

440
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:07,768
And we're almost outta water.

441
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,771
We should go on a run tonight.

442
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:12,906
Dad, I can sneak in anywhere.

443
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,443
No, no no, no no,
no more sneaking.

444
00:28:15,475 --> 00:28:16,810
Please?

445
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:18,146
Come on.

446
00:28:18,178 --> 00:28:18,745
[Joe] I think we should...

447
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,548
Of course, fine.

448
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,549
I'll get my pack.

449
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,625
Okay.

450
00:28:33,293 --> 00:28:34,561
Okay, Ethan.

451
00:28:34,595 --> 00:28:35,796
[gun firing]

452
00:28:35,828 --> 00:28:36,830
Ow!

453
00:28:36,864 --> 00:28:37,765
[groaning]

454
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:40,300
Josh! Get in the house!

455
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:43,871
[soft dramatic music]

456
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,540
Come on, come on.

457
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:48,275
Come on.

458
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:52,812
Oh my God, that hurts.

459
00:28:52,846 --> 00:28:54,415
Come on, come on.

460
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:56,651
Come on.

461
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,823
[gun firing twice]

462
00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:06,860
[gun firing]

463
00:29:06,894 --> 00:29:07,929
[Desiree] Keep walking.

464
00:29:09,495 --> 00:29:11,431
Come only, over here.

465
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:14,668
Mom, Dad!

466
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:15,970
Get inside!

467
00:29:16,002 --> 00:29:16,904
Is she okay?

468
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:18,473
Shut up, okay.

469
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:23,810
[Joe] Oh God.

470
00:29:23,844 --> 00:29:25,880
No get him up, get him up.

471
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:28,415
[guns firing]

472
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:42,562
It's okay.

473
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:44,732
[Ethan coughing]

474
00:29:44,764 --> 00:29:46,266
Ethan, look at me.

475
00:29:47,033 --> 00:29:48,735
Show me your eyes.

476
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,305
Show me your eyes!

477
00:29:51,338 --> 00:29:52,940
[gun firing]

478
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:54,642
I'm so sorry, Ethan.

479
00:29:55,742 --> 00:29:57,677
[guns firing]

480
00:29:57,711 --> 00:29:58,546
That's it.

481
00:30:00,614 --> 00:30:03,351
[dramatic music]

482
00:30:10,456 --> 00:30:12,325
[chamber spinning]

483
00:30:12,358 --> 00:30:12,960
Anything?

484
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,261
No.

485
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:14,928
You?

486
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,665
They're low.
They're holding out.

487
00:30:18,698 --> 00:30:19,533
They're out.

488
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:22,837
Be my guest.

489
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:27,340
Go left.

490
00:30:27,374 --> 00:30:28,843
And get him outta that thing.

491
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:30,712
You're with me.

492
00:30:32,078 --> 00:30:33,615
And what are we gonna do?

493
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:36,717
Going right through
the front door.

494
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:40,922
[soft dramatic music]

495
00:31:00,741 --> 00:31:03,310

[soft dramatic music]

498
00:32:29,996 --> 00:32:31,064
Son of a bitch.

[guns firing]

500
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:42,843
Careful.

501
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:44,444
Let him go, boy.

502
00:32:46,146 --> 00:32:48,115
Lotta friction you're making.

503
00:32:48,147 --> 00:32:50,650
I ain't gonna tell
you again. You drop him!

504
00:32:50,684 --> 00:32:54,422
Careful now, before
hell comes calling.

505
00:32:54,454 --> 00:32:58,992
Times like these, we need
to rely on one another.

506
00:32:59,026 --> 00:32:59,961
Oh, I see.

507
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:02,930
Well that's not very
neighborly of you.

508
00:33:04,231 --> 00:33:06,200
[soft dramatic music]

509
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:08,569
[hard breathing]

510
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:11,004
Say, what did you do
to that little one?

511
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:15,410
[soft dramatic music]

512
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:21,615

[gun striking]

519
00:33:58,585 --> 00:33:59,520
Grab the cords.

520
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,190
[coughing]

521
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,532
Playing possum, huh?

522
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,502
I love it. I fucking love it.

523
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:20,274
[coughing]

524
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:23,109
[wind howling]

525
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:35,689
Hi ya, Sonny.

526
00:34:35,722 --> 00:34:36,524
Josh?

527
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:39,527
Josh?

528
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:43,163
Come here.

529
00:34:43,196 --> 00:34:45,299
Come here, come here.
How's everything.

530
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:46,232
It's good.

531
00:34:46,265 --> 00:34:47,635
It's good? Everything okay?

532
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,636
Okay, I want you to wait
up there, all right?

533
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:50,570
Okay.

534
00:34:50,604 --> 00:34:51,672
I want you to wait up there.

535
00:34:51,705 --> 00:34:53,607
Wait upstairs.

536
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,742
Go on, go on.

537
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,880
[wind howling]

538
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,620

540
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,618
Let me see, let me see.

541
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:43,290
[grunting]

542
00:35:43,323 --> 00:35:44,925
We need to close this.

543
00:35:44,957 --> 00:35:46,359
They hit the kit.

544
00:35:46,392 --> 00:35:48,227
There's no needle or
thread. Everything's gone.

545
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,996
Okay, okay, we
cauterize it then.

546
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,832
All right, we can
stop the bleeding.

547
00:35:51,865 --> 00:35:53,267
No no no, that's
just gonna increase

548
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,669
my chance of infection.

549
00:35:56,169 --> 00:35:57,071
Okay.

550
00:35:57,104 --> 00:35:57,972
What a shame.

551
00:36:01,975 --> 00:36:04,645
Even comfort from the
cold's been taken from us.

552
00:36:10,383 --> 00:36:13,620
Insulation, smart.

553
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:17,390
[lighter clicking]

554
00:36:17,423 --> 00:36:21,794
Tell me, how do you
think we'll fare

555
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:23,296
through the thick of winter?

556
00:36:24,664 --> 00:36:25,298
Without fire.

557
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:29,669
What with these
sickos running around,

558
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:32,338
hunting off the heat.

559
00:36:32,372 --> 00:36:35,309
[lighter clicking]

560
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:37,011
Don't.

[lighter clicking]

562
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:46,921
I'll give you a choice.

563
00:36:49,423 --> 00:36:51,359
Finish us off with
that scattergun,

564
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:55,328
make a fire, tiny one, though.

565
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,799
Don't wanna excite the natives.

566
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:04,372
But that'll just postpone
your woman's demise.

567
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:07,341
She needs meds.

568
00:37:10,343 --> 00:37:13,379
Ironically, it would
seem, I too am in need

569
00:37:13,412 --> 00:37:17,318
of the healing powers you
both so desperately seek.

570
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,156
And wouldn't you just know it?

571
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:25,992
We happen to have a
fresh batch back at camp.

572
00:37:28,495 --> 00:37:29,997
So what are you gonna do, boy?

573
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,669
How many more
of you are there?

574
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:38,138
You know crowds
ain't safe no more.

575
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:41,075
You're looking at what's left.

576
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:44,243
And him?

577
00:37:44,276 --> 00:37:46,312
He's just being
punished, that's all.

578
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:48,783
Tough love.

579
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:53,453
Thanks to your woman's
handiwork here,

580
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:56,723
my brother and I
are a dying breed.

581
00:37:58,825 --> 00:38:01,062
You give me that lighter,
I close both of you up.

582
00:38:02,194 --> 00:38:03,263
Nah.

583
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:04,364
What?

584
00:38:04,397 --> 00:38:05,433
That don't work for me.

585
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:09,502
Then I take it from
you and watch you suffer.

586
00:38:09,535 --> 00:38:12,772
[chuckles] Life is suffering.

587
00:38:15,008 --> 00:38:16,444
Today's just another day.

588
00:38:17,477 --> 00:38:18,745
And like she said,

589
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:22,717
burning only opens us
up to all kindsa shit.

590
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:28,755
Besides [groans],
nothing vital's been hit.

591
00:38:29,488 --> 00:38:31,091
How you holding up, darling?

592
00:38:32,325 --> 00:38:36,030
[laughs] I see where
you keep the heat.

593
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:40,133
Where's your camp?

594
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:41,201
It ain't far.

595
00:38:41,234 --> 00:38:42,436
Draw me a map.

596
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:44,403
Ain't no map
gonna get you there.

597
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:45,405
We stay mobile.

598
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:47,240
What road then?

599
00:38:47,274 --> 00:38:49,443
Hell, barely
any roads anymore.

600
00:38:49,475 --> 00:38:50,877
Safe ones anyways.

601
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:55,049
What you need is someone
who knows the way.

602
00:38:56,383 --> 00:38:57,850
If you think I'm
dragging your sorry ass...

603
00:38:57,883 --> 00:39:00,553
[laughs] We both now you
ain't in no kinda shape

604
00:39:00,586 --> 00:39:02,922
to be doing that.

605
00:39:02,955 --> 00:39:05,191
[coughing]

606
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:09,863
But, I'm feeling kinda
charitable this evening.

607
00:39:11,198 --> 00:39:14,368
So I will provide
you with a guide.

608
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:18,004
We're new around these parts,

609
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:20,439
and as a proper
welcoming gesture,

610
00:39:20,472 --> 00:39:23,777
our little one-stop shop has
everything your hearts desire.

611
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:27,181
Where the fuck is it?

612
00:39:28,515 --> 00:39:29,917
Do it.

613
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,586
I'll do it. I swear to God.

614
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:33,854
I know.

615
00:39:34,553 --> 00:39:36,089
I can smell it on you.

616
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,492
You're gonna learn, boy.

617
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:40,493
Sooner or later.

618
00:39:42,896 --> 00:39:44,397
In this new world of ours,

619
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:49,537
need is power.

620
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:57,812
Don't think I can't see you
sizing me up over there, sister.

621
00:39:58,644 --> 00:40:01,848
[lighter clicking]

622
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:04,851
[soft dramatic music]

623
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:13,861
You motherfucker.

624
00:40:15,562 --> 00:40:17,598
[laughing]

625
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:19,966
Ethan.

626
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:23,603
[soft dramatic music]

627
00:40:23,636 --> 00:40:24,470
Fuck.

628
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:28,541
[soft dramatic music]

629
00:40:30,644 --> 00:40:33,513
[groaning]

630
00:40:33,546 --> 00:40:34,615
She's lying.

631
00:40:35,548 --> 00:40:36,883
What other options do we have?

632
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:38,018
We leave, right now.

633
00:40:39,252 --> 00:40:40,321
You'll die.

634
00:40:41,388 --> 00:40:42,223
Brother?

635
00:40:43,555 --> 00:40:44,591
Lincoln.

636
00:40:46,325 --> 00:40:50,563
You have been nominated to
guide this man back to our camp

637
00:40:51,397 --> 00:40:54,300
and provide him with any
medicine he so desires.

638
00:40:55,669 --> 00:40:59,540
Upon your return and
administering to our wounds,

639
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:02,376
we will all go our happy ways.

640
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,345
How'd that be?

641
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:11,018
Be happy to.

642
00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:15,189
[laughs] His mama
raised him right.

643
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:18,591
Gas.

644
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:20,660
[Desiree] What's that?

645
00:41:20,693 --> 00:41:22,695
We want the gas you stole.

646
00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:24,497
Stole [laughs]?

647
00:41:24,531 --> 00:41:26,700
That's mighty white of you.

648
00:41:26,732 --> 00:41:28,702
Accusing us of stealing.

649
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:31,671
Remind me how you came
about that anyway, huh?

650
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:33,973
We just want what's
ours, nothing more.

651
00:41:35,175 --> 00:41:37,343
Everybody wants more.

652
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,284
[grunting]

653
00:41:44,316 --> 00:41:47,487

654
00:41:54,127 --> 00:41:56,997
[lighter clicking]

655
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,401
I'd say we have
ourselves an arrangement.

656
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:05,972
Look at that. We're sharing.

657
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:09,276
[laughing]

658
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:11,011
Thanks for being home, neighbor.

659
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:15,281
[lighter clicking]

660

[monitor beeping]

661
00:42:26,026 --> 00:42:27,461
Now I'm freezing my ass off.

662
00:42:29,729 --> 00:42:30,664
All right, keep up.

663
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,703

[soft dramatic music]

668
00:43:17,343 --> 00:43:18,645
[Ethan] How much longer?

669
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:23,050
For you, not much.

670
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,752
You guys playing roulette?

671
00:43:27,086 --> 00:43:29,489
All cooped up in there
together like that.

672
00:43:31,758 --> 00:43:33,761
They can sniff that
shit out real quick.

673
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,595
Both of them.

674
00:43:37,597 --> 00:43:39,133
I don't blame you, though.

675
00:43:40,732 --> 00:43:42,336
Good-looking lady like that.

676
00:43:44,203 --> 00:43:46,305
Pretty head of golden hair, huh.

677
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,475
I'll bet you,

678
00:43:49,408 --> 00:43:52,046
once upon a time you
guys find a quiet space,

679
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,749
she'd wrap her legs around you.

680
00:43:57,216 --> 00:44:00,253
Make you feel like
a king, boy, shit.

681
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,627
Ain't nothing better than
that in the whole wide world.

682
00:44:08,595 --> 00:44:10,664
Except maybe eating peaches.

683
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:13,165
Do you like peaches?

684
00:44:13,198 --> 00:44:15,568
I love them. Love
me some peaches.

685
00:44:15,602 --> 00:44:16,770
They're just so sweet

686
00:44:17,636 --> 00:44:19,372
and so soft.

687
00:44:19,405 --> 00:44:20,807
Your fingers, they
get all sticky

688
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,477
when you're holding
onto them, you know.

689
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,479
You gotta lick them
to clean them off.

690
00:44:27,914 --> 00:44:29,816
Love me a sweet peach.

691
00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:32,819

[birds chirping]

693
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:50,604
Dad's gonna teach me
how to shoot on this trip.

694
00:44:50,636 --> 00:44:51,805
[Josh] Me too.

695
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:53,140
- Nu-uh.
- Uh-huh.

696
00:44:53,173 --> 00:44:53,807
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

697
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,242
Well I'm older, so.

698
00:44:55,274 --> 00:44:56,609
So?

699
00:44:56,642 --> 00:44:58,644
Hey, hey [laughs],
how about this?

700
00:44:58,678 --> 00:45:01,414
How about we have Mom
show us how it's done?

701
00:45:01,446 --> 00:45:02,314
Excuse me.

702
00:45:02,347 --> 00:45:03,816
- Yeah!
- Yes.

703
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,452
Okay, what did I say?

704
00:45:05,484 --> 00:45:06,886
They're not toys, we know.

705
00:45:08,187 --> 00:45:09,823
They're not toys.

706
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:11,158
So you're gonna show us?

707
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:12,225
Come on, please.

708
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:14,894
Hey.

[shutter clicking]

710
00:45:18,664 --> 00:45:21,434
All right, all right, all
right all right all right.

711
00:45:22,868 --> 00:45:24,870
[Josh] I can't
wait to use a gun.

712
00:45:24,903 --> 00:45:27,340
You're giving him a
gun? He can't shoot.

713
00:45:28,274 --> 00:45:29,643
[Joe] We'll talk about it.

714
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:32,945

00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:36,883
[Mia] Nice job.

717
00:45:36,915 --> 00:45:37,917
Thank you.

718
00:45:39,651 --> 00:45:40,920
- Ready?
- Yeah.

719
00:45:43,455 --> 00:45:44,290
Come on.

[gun clicking]

721
00:45:47,459 --> 00:45:48,260
Got it?

722
00:45:48,294 --> 00:45:49,328
Yeah.

723
00:45:49,361 --> 00:45:50,196
Okay.

724
00:45:52,397 --> 00:45:53,232
Like that.

725
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:56,502
Okay, just nice and steady.

726
00:45:57,636 --> 00:45:58,437
You gotta breathe.

727
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:59,405
Mom.

728
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:00,540
Okay, yeah.

729
00:46:03,575 --> 00:46:06,412

Nice shot, baby girl.

733
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,419
- Thank you, thank you.
- Very nice.

734
00:46:13,486 --> 00:46:15,422
[soft music]

735
00:46:15,455 --> 00:46:16,290
Your turn.

[soft piano music]

737
00:46:20,827 --> 00:46:22,930
You said you wanted to try it.

738
00:46:26,698 --> 00:46:27,867
Hey, you know,
I'm getting hungry.

739
00:46:27,899 --> 00:46:29,702
Who's hungry? You hungry?

740
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:30,537
I'm hungry.

741
00:46:30,569 --> 00:46:32,037
Yeah?

742
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:33,439
Oh, dead ass, tell me you brought
some of those little cheese things.

743
00:46:33,472 --> 00:46:34,373
Mouth.

744
00:46:34,406 --> 00:46:36,343
Sorry, but did you bring any?

745
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,276
[Ethan] I didn't
bring any, did you?

746
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:37,944
[Joe] I did not bring them.

747
00:46:37,977 --> 00:46:39,546
Didn't bring any.

748
00:46:39,578 --> 00:46:40,379
Mm.

749
00:46:40,412 --> 00:46:41,313
We did.

750
00:46:41,347 --> 00:46:42,348
Ah, ha ha, you're really lame.

751
00:46:42,381 --> 00:46:43,983
Come here, come on.

752
00:46:44,017 --> 00:46:45,518
Let's go, good job.

753
00:46:45,551 --> 00:46:47,988
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

754
00:46:48,021 --> 00:46:50,223
What's up? You
hungry, little man, hm?

755
00:46:51,957 --> 00:46:52,892
Yeah.

756
00:46:52,925 --> 00:46:55,528
[soft piano music]

757
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,265
Okay, all right,
let's go. Let's go eat.

758
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:01,434
[dramatic music]

759
00:47:01,466 --> 00:47:03,836
[gun firing]

760
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,305
You're too damn close.

761
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:05,973
Shut up.

762
00:47:11,977 --> 00:47:13,046
[gun firing]

763
00:47:13,078 --> 00:47:15,781
[gun clicking]

764
00:47:15,814 --> 00:47:18,985
[soft dramatic music]

765
00:47:31,497 --> 00:47:32,765
I ain't dying out here.

766
00:47:34,466 --> 00:47:36,336
[Ethan] Like you got a choice.

767
00:47:37,769 --> 00:47:40,373
[wind howling]

768
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,746
You shouldn't have come here.

769
00:47:48,381 --> 00:47:49,016
What?

770
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:57,357
You heard me.

771
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:58,392
Oh, I heard you.

772
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,861
What do you mean by that?

773
00:48:01,894 --> 00:48:03,062
You and the pieces
of shit you came here

774
00:48:03,095 --> 00:48:04,798
with shouldn't have come here.

775
00:48:07,133 --> 00:48:11,071
We're just trying to
survive, like everyone else.

776
00:48:11,104 --> 00:48:12,872
Moving from place to place.

777
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:15,641
Putting food in our bellies.

778
00:48:17,008 --> 00:48:19,011
Trying to see another sunrise.

779
00:48:22,848 --> 00:48:25,452
Are we really all that
different, you and me?

780
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:29,422
[scoffing]

781
00:48:29,455 --> 00:48:30,090
Yes.

782
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:34,060
No, we ain't.

783
00:48:37,696 --> 00:48:39,098
How many homes you pick through?

784
00:48:40,832 --> 00:48:44,037
Knowing whatever you
get, whatever you find,

785
00:48:46,037 --> 00:48:47,840
might help you see another day.

786
00:48:50,008 --> 00:48:51,644
How many mouths you robbed?

787
00:48:53,078 --> 00:48:56,515
Tomorrows you and
your family took away.

788
00:48:56,548 --> 00:48:58,751
We don't kill people.

789
00:48:58,785 --> 00:48:59,618
Oh no?

790
00:49:01,086 --> 00:49:03,422
Love the yard decorations.

791
00:49:03,455 --> 00:49:04,890
They had to be put down.

792
00:49:06,158 --> 00:49:07,461
You sound like them.

793
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,729
You come from the wall?

794
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:12,765
Fuck you. We
don't kill people.

795
00:49:13,832 --> 00:49:15,368
You shot that girl.

796
00:49:18,937 --> 00:49:21,640
We defend what's ours.

797
00:49:21,673 --> 00:49:24,143
Amen, baby girl, as do we.

798
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:28,915
Invading homes with assault
rifles, you call that defense?

799
00:49:28,948 --> 00:49:31,050
You don't carry when
you're ducking and dodging

800
00:49:31,082 --> 00:49:33,919
the fucking lunatics
this mess unleashed,

801
00:49:33,952 --> 00:49:36,622
or looking for that golden
goose they promised us?

802
00:49:36,656 --> 00:49:37,524
What?

803
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,127
[Avery coughing]

804
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,396
Help him.

805
00:49:46,131 --> 00:49:47,599
[Avery coughing]

806
00:49:47,633 --> 00:49:48,535
You are so.

807
00:49:53,238 --> 00:49:54,473
I wouldn't do that.

808
00:49:56,475 --> 00:49:58,510
[coughing]

809
00:49:58,544 --> 00:50:01,214
[shivering]

810
00:50:01,247 --> 00:50:04,618
[soft dramatic music]

811
00:50:10,823 --> 00:50:13,093
[grunting]

812
00:50:16,696 --> 00:50:17,564
[Avery] Thank you.

813
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,765
Who are you?

814
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:21,167
My name's Avery
Dennison. I'm a scout.

815
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,135
Scout my ass.

816
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:23,736
Quiet!

817
00:50:23,769 --> 00:50:24,671
You from the wall?

818
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,040
We were assessing
zones two through four.

819
00:50:28,073 --> 00:50:29,908
Assess is a fancy
word for targeting.

820
00:50:29,941 --> 00:50:31,210
I won't say it again!

821
00:50:36,182 --> 00:50:37,017
Go on.

822
00:50:40,019 --> 00:50:42,955
We determined the reach and
severity of the infection.

823
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,960
Families within the perimeter
were supposed to be given

824
00:50:46,993 --> 00:50:49,796
one countermeasure per
member of the household.

825
00:50:51,229 --> 00:50:53,265
But that was before we,

826
00:50:53,298 --> 00:50:56,135
we learned that containment
was no longer an option.

827
00:51:00,606 --> 00:51:05,245
Over 95% of the area's
water supply was affected.

828
00:51:05,278 --> 00:51:07,714
Anything that came
in contact with it,

829
00:51:07,747 --> 00:51:11,751
wildlife, livestock, it was
all deemed nonessential.

830
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:16,256
And the countermeasure?

831
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:17,991
The vaccine?

832
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:19,592
Desiree here, and
the outsiders living

833
00:51:19,624 --> 00:51:22,160
off the land were the
first to receive it.

834
00:51:22,193 --> 00:51:23,595
When the pathogen mutated,

835
00:51:23,629 --> 00:51:26,165
the company decided
on another option.

836
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,138
An evacuation?

837
00:51:35,274 --> 00:51:36,109
Speak!

838
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,546
Once the countermeasure's
effectiveness

839
00:51:39,578 --> 00:51:43,149
dropped to 50%, cure or
kill, people panicked,

840
00:51:43,182 --> 00:51:44,950
bleeding into the countryside.

841
00:51:44,984 --> 00:51:46,586
That's when zones were chosen.

842
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:49,254
We needed more time to
study the infection.

843
00:51:49,287 --> 00:51:50,823
Snake oil, darling.

844
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:55,160
Carrots dangling to keep us
here while their wall went up.

845
00:51:55,193 --> 00:51:56,128
[Avery] No.

846
00:51:56,162 --> 00:51:57,964
You said zones are chosen.

847
00:51:57,997 --> 00:51:59,832
Chosen for what?
And don't lie to me.

848
00:51:59,865 --> 00:52:01,301
Measures needed to
cleanse the remaining

849
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:03,069
traces of the outbreak.

850
00:52:03,102 --> 00:52:07,339
Then, mask it with an
event, a natural disaster.

851
00:52:07,372 --> 00:52:09,274
Sell it to the public.

852
00:52:09,307 --> 00:52:12,344
[soft dramatic music]

853
00:52:12,377 --> 00:52:13,613
An accident.

854
00:52:14,946 --> 00:52:19,251
We fight over scraps.
They pick up what's left.

855
00:52:19,285 --> 00:52:20,185
Cover it up.

856
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,988
She's lying. My team
was never a party to...

857
00:52:22,021 --> 00:52:23,923
How are they choosing them?

858
00:52:23,955 --> 00:52:25,158
Choosing what?

859
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:28,194
The zones, where are
they starting from.

860
00:52:28,227 --> 00:52:29,828
We were not told where.

861
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:31,897
Think. Where would you start?

862
00:52:33,164 --> 00:52:34,633
[stuttering]

863
00:52:34,667 --> 00:52:37,604
That's not a place. Where?

864
00:52:37,636 --> 00:52:39,372
South, south.

865
00:52:39,405 --> 00:52:40,807
Bigger populations.

866
00:52:40,839 --> 00:52:43,309
It's warmer. It
attracts the infected.

867
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:44,843
They're drawn to the heat.

868
00:52:44,877 --> 00:52:46,245
The farther north you
go, into the cold,

869
00:52:46,278 --> 00:52:47,946
everything's harder to track.

870
00:52:47,979 --> 00:52:50,783
That's why you're here,
right, high heating?

871
00:52:52,084 --> 00:52:53,019
Wrong.

872
00:52:53,051 --> 00:52:56,155
[soft dramatic music]

873
00:52:56,187 --> 00:52:57,323
Surviving.

874
00:52:57,356 --> 00:53:00,327
[soft dramatic music]

875
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,905
We had friends there.
All those people.

876
00:53:14,939 --> 00:53:17,142
Families, you're telling
me all that's gone?

877
00:53:18,243 --> 00:53:21,347
Yes.

878
00:53:21,379 --> 00:53:22,648
They hoped they could stop it.

879
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:24,917
Hope, that shit's dangerous.

880
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:27,953
But so are caged animals.

881
00:53:30,089 --> 00:53:32,325
Especially ones that
have nothing to lose.

882
00:53:37,463 --> 00:53:39,765
Humane options
were administered

883
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:44,203
in select communities
with higher headcounts.

884
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:48,742
[soft dramatic music]

885
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:02,355
[Joe] I couldn't do it.

886
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:07,126
End all of those lives.

887
00:54:10,863 --> 00:54:13,031
Don't sell yourself
short, beautiful.

888
00:54:13,064 --> 00:54:14,233
Sure you could.

889
00:54:16,502 --> 00:54:19,406
Everybody just
needs a little push.

890
00:54:20,272 --> 00:54:22,040
[groaning]

891
00:54:22,073 --> 00:54:23,943
Stop it, let him go.

892
00:54:23,975 --> 00:54:26,211
[groaning]

893
00:54:29,013 --> 00:54:31,216
No one knows what
they're capable of

894
00:54:32,417 --> 00:54:34,486
until they're at the edge.

895
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:37,456
[groaning]

896
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:38,725
Starving.

897
00:54:39,524 --> 00:54:40,727
Dying.

898
00:54:42,026 --> 00:54:43,229
Outta options.

899
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:46,332
[Avery groaning]

900
00:54:46,365 --> 00:54:47,367
Changes you.

901
00:54:48,533 --> 00:54:50,169
Changes everything.

902
00:54:50,202 --> 00:54:51,136
Bullshit, let him go.

903
00:54:51,169 --> 00:54:52,071
Everyone!

904
00:54:53,405 --> 00:54:55,307
That's when it
comes outta hiding.

905
00:54:57,542 --> 00:54:58,477
When your time comes,

906
00:54:59,845 --> 00:55:00,946
wonder what you'll be.

907
00:55:03,414 --> 00:55:05,751
Wolf? Sheep?

908
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:09,723
Either way,

909
00:55:12,423 --> 00:55:15,160
packs always fight over scraps.

910
00:55:15,193 --> 00:55:17,229
[Avery groaning]

911
00:55:17,263 --> 00:55:19,999
Sometimes, flocks
need to be thinned.

912
00:55:23,435 --> 00:55:26,072
[bones breaking]

913
00:55:26,104 --> 00:55:29,274
[soft dramatic music]

914
00:55:45,423 --> 00:55:47,459
[Ethan coughing]

915
00:55:47,493 --> 00:55:48,328
Sh.

916
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:52,397
[Ethan coughing]

917
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:53,832
Quiet, shut the fuck up.

918
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:57,803
[gun firing twice]

919
00:55:57,836 --> 00:56:00,438
[Ethan coughing]

920
00:56:00,472 --> 00:56:03,843
[soft dramatic music]

921
00:56:20,892 --> 00:56:23,862
[hard breathing]

922
00:56:26,598 --> 00:56:29,968
[soft dramatic music]

923
00:56:51,423 --> 00:56:52,258
Aw fuck.

924
00:56:53,524 --> 00:56:56,896
[soft dramatic music]

925
00:57:37,169 --> 00:57:39,439
[grunting]

926
00:57:40,606 --> 00:57:43,475
[hard breathing]

927
00:57:43,508 --> 00:57:46,879
[soft dramatic music]

928
00:57:56,388 --> 00:57:57,590
Hey.

929
00:57:57,622 --> 00:57:59,658
[laughing]

930
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:05,964
Oh, I bet that hurt like
a motherfucker, didn't it?

931
00:58:05,997 --> 00:58:10,368
And there you go,
with that shit again.

932
00:58:10,401 --> 00:58:11,604
I told you, man.

933
00:58:11,636 --> 00:58:13,673
[coughing]

934
00:58:15,307 --> 00:58:19,178
You keep that up, you're
gonna get us both killed.

935
00:58:21,046 --> 00:58:22,381
[Ethan] All right,
so the warmest plates.

936
00:58:22,414 --> 00:58:23,249
Yes, thank you.

937
00:58:24,149 --> 00:58:24,951
You're welcome.

938
00:58:24,984 --> 00:58:26,552
Oh, you're so good.

939
00:58:29,421 --> 00:58:30,957
I wanna see.

940
00:58:32,758 --> 00:58:34,460
Why don't you put that away?

941
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:44,102
We should move up here.

942
00:58:47,606 --> 00:58:49,542
What? We should.

943
00:58:49,575 --> 00:58:51,676
Dad, you wouldn't have
to be gone so much.

944
00:58:51,709 --> 00:58:54,280
And, Mom, you could teach
me more wilderness stuff.

945
00:58:56,015 --> 00:58:57,317
It's called survival, honey.

946
00:58:58,684 --> 00:59:00,685
All right, well, I think
we should go to bed.

947
00:59:00,718 --> 00:59:03,289
We got a big day tomorrow here.

948
00:59:03,321 --> 00:59:04,122
Okay.

949
00:59:05,089 --> 00:59:07,424
Let me help you with that.

950
00:59:18,703 --> 00:59:19,972
Oh, hey there.

951
00:59:20,671 --> 00:59:21,707
What are you doing?

952
00:59:22,707 --> 00:59:23,709
[Ethan] Get in here.

953
00:59:23,742 --> 00:59:24,577
Oh, God.

954
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,046
Mm-hm.

955
00:59:41,093 --> 00:59:42,428
You are amazing.

956
00:59:44,729 --> 00:59:45,731
Hm?

957
00:59:45,763 --> 00:59:46,564
Hm?

958
00:59:46,597 --> 00:59:49,067
[laughing]

959
00:59:54,238 --> 00:59:56,041
Tell me a story.

960
00:59:56,075 --> 00:59:56,675
A story?

961
00:59:56,707 --> 00:59:58,176
Mm-hm.

962
00:59:58,209 --> 00:59:59,011
Okay.

963
01:00:00,812 --> 01:00:02,381
There's a small log cabin

964
01:00:04,749 --> 01:00:07,185
with a chimney, by a lake.

965
01:00:10,488 --> 01:00:11,790
Is there a fire?

966
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,526
Oh, there's a fire, baby.

967
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,095
Oh, no.

968
01:00:16,127 --> 01:00:16,729
No?

969
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:18,696
No, not yet.

970
01:00:18,729 --> 01:00:21,466
Okay, I'm gonna get
through the story quick.

971
01:00:21,499 --> 01:00:22,700
[laughing]

972
01:00:22,734 --> 01:00:23,569
Okay, continue.

973
01:00:25,636 --> 01:00:29,475
There's a small log cabin,
with a chimney, by a lake.

974
01:00:32,711 --> 01:00:35,515
Where the water catches
the sky like a mirror.

975
01:00:37,548 --> 01:00:40,118
It's tucked away by green pines,

976
01:00:41,553 --> 01:00:45,825
and on the porch a man and
a woman sit, holding hands.

977
01:00:49,794 --> 01:00:51,497
Watching the sun disappear.

978
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,201
Together.

979
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,106
Together?

980
01:01:00,138 --> 01:01:02,841
[soft piano music]

981
01:01:11,617 --> 01:01:13,819

[Lincoln muttering]

985
01:01:30,868 --> 01:01:32,238
Don't do this.

986
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,705
[Lincoln] Why?

987
01:01:33,738 --> 01:01:35,540
We have to go back.

988
01:01:35,573 --> 01:01:37,342
They need that medicine.
We need to go back.

989
01:01:37,376 --> 01:01:38,377
Your sister, she needs it.

990
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:39,245
Needs!

991
01:01:42,781 --> 01:01:43,849
You sound like her now.

992
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:46,751
Need need need, need
need, need need.

993
01:01:46,785 --> 01:01:48,888
You shut the fuck up.

994
01:01:52,591 --> 01:01:54,460
She's playing those
goddam mind games.

995
01:01:58,964 --> 01:02:00,833
I wanna show you something.

996
01:02:00,865 --> 01:02:01,800
You see this?

997
01:02:03,468 --> 01:02:05,404
You know what that is?

998
01:02:05,437 --> 01:02:07,140
You have any idea what that is?

999
01:02:09,941 --> 01:02:13,211
That is all that I need.

1000
01:02:14,845 --> 01:02:15,814
That is power.

1001
01:02:17,649 --> 01:02:18,484
Yeah.

1002
01:02:19,484 --> 01:02:20,620
But it's Desiree's.

1003
01:02:21,553 --> 01:02:23,355
It's from before.

1004
01:02:23,388 --> 01:02:25,357
I can't open it.

1005
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:29,194
It's her little,
uh, little secret.

1006
01:02:32,531 --> 01:02:36,936
But you know them, from
outside the wall, they are some

1007
01:02:36,968 --> 01:02:39,938
tricky sons of
bitches, you know.

1008
01:02:41,973 --> 01:02:45,877
I mean, it's their shit
that gets in the water,

1009
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:49,347
you know, starts
fucking everybody up.

1010
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:52,952
And these poor people, they
start losing their goddam minds,

1011
01:02:52,984 --> 01:02:55,954
and then they tell us, they
tell us, oh yeah, you know,

1012
01:02:55,988 --> 01:02:57,924
hey, hey, there's a cure.

1013
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:04,763
And then they cut
us off with the wall

1014
01:03:04,796 --> 01:03:09,234
and they kill anybody that
tries to get the word out.

1015
01:03:10,334 --> 01:03:11,970
They said that they
were gonna help us.

1016
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:15,874
They said that they were gonna
help anybody that needed it.

1017
01:03:15,906 --> 01:03:19,278
[soft dramatic music]

1018
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:25,650
[laughing]

1019
01:03:26,818 --> 01:03:28,321
They helped us, all right.

1020
01:03:34,026 --> 01:03:38,664
It was the only meat that we
knew that wasn't infected,

1021
01:03:38,696 --> 01:03:42,434
being Halifax employees.

1022
01:03:42,466 --> 01:03:44,269
You know, outsiders
from the wall,

1023
01:03:44,303 --> 01:03:48,040
so we just helped
ourselves to them,

1024
01:03:48,073 --> 01:03:51,978
over and over

1025
01:03:54,412 --> 01:03:56,514
and over again.

1026
01:04:00,051 --> 01:04:01,287
Shit.

1027
01:04:04,055 --> 01:04:05,323
That bitch was right.

1028
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:07,693
That need shit.

1029
01:04:10,961 --> 01:04:12,964
It is powerful.

1030
01:04:12,997 --> 01:04:14,800
[punches striking]

1031
01:04:14,832 --> 01:04:17,035

1032
01:04:17,068 --> 01:04:18,703
There you are.

1033
01:04:18,736 --> 01:04:19,972
A fighter, I like that.

1034
01:04:20,939 --> 01:04:22,441
Yeah, I like that.

1035
01:04:24,343 --> 01:04:25,877
Hey, hey hey.

1036
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,979
Tell me, tell me tell me.

1037
01:04:29,714 --> 01:04:32,550
What would you do for that?

1038
01:04:32,584 --> 01:04:34,053
What would you give?

1039
01:04:34,086 --> 01:04:37,455
[soft dramatic music]

1040
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:41,993
Anything.

1041
01:04:44,396 --> 01:04:46,598
And what about that
pretty little lady

1042
01:04:46,631 --> 01:04:49,368
of yours, that sweet peach, huh?

1043
01:04:49,401 --> 01:04:52,571
What do you think
that she would give?

1044
01:04:53,738 --> 01:04:57,943
Oh man, I bet she'd
be real grateful, huh?

1045
01:05:01,446 --> 01:05:03,082
Quiet now, quiet.

1046
01:05:03,115 --> 01:05:06,084

You tired of wearing
that sheep's wool

1053
01:06:30,468 --> 01:06:31,970
in this little flock of yours?

1054
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,578
You done hiding?

1055
01:06:42,247 --> 01:06:43,082
Hm.

1056
01:06:44,548 --> 01:06:45,184
What?

1057
01:06:47,685 --> 01:06:48,553
How many?

1058
01:06:51,022 --> 01:06:51,891
How many what?

1059
01:06:57,162 --> 01:06:58,997
Men do you have
waiting for him?

1060
01:07:01,265 --> 01:07:04,068
Because if it were me,
I'd have left everyone

1061
01:07:04,102 --> 01:07:05,805
on guard until I returned.

1062
01:07:06,937 --> 01:07:07,772
Waiting.

[Desiree imitating wolf]

1064
01:07:18,216 --> 01:07:22,121
My husband isn't coming
back, and until someone

01:07:22,988 --> 01:07:24,756
or something does,

1066
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:29,728
it's just you and me.

1067
01:07:31,129 --> 01:07:35,901
So, go ahead, keep preaching
your self-righteousness,

1068
01:07:37,202 --> 01:07:40,171
your delusional justifications,
because the only one

1069
01:07:40,205 --> 01:07:42,675
hiding here, is you.

1070
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:47,746

are, a fucking pussy.

as hell ain't fine.

daughter anymore.

I could help her.

1117
01:10:38,717 --> 01:10:40,786
Why'd you shoot that girl?

1118
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:42,154
They came into our home.

1119
01:10:42,186 --> 01:10:43,421
[Desiree] They didn't
know anyone was here.

1120
01:10:43,454 --> 01:10:44,855
They were carrying weapons.

1121
01:10:44,888 --> 01:10:46,324
Protection!

1122
01:10:46,356 --> 01:10:48,894
She was carrying protection,
no different than you and me,

1123
01:10:48,927 --> 01:10:50,462
no different than anybody else.

1124
01:10:50,494 --> 01:10:51,363
You expect me to believe that?

1125
01:10:51,395 --> 01:10:54,031
I don't give two
shits what you believe.

1126
01:10:54,065 --> 01:10:57,035
I'm telling you,
she didn't know!

1127
01:10:57,068 --> 01:10:58,904
So you came back
to slaughter us?

1128
01:10:59,904 --> 01:11:02,374
[Mia gasping]

1129
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,209
Don't worry.

1130
01:11:05,243 --> 01:11:08,713
That's what I tell her,
same as they told us.

1131
01:11:10,448 --> 01:11:13,985
When the water turned,
animals, people,

1132
01:11:15,486 --> 01:11:18,923
kept saying, don't worry,
baby, it's gonna be okay.

1133
01:11:20,492 --> 01:11:23,028
But I knew, I knew I was lying.

1134
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:27,066
I just needed to make her feel,

1135
01:11:28,365 --> 01:11:29,167
to make her feel...

1136
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,034
Safe.

1137
01:11:32,503 --> 01:11:33,771
You ever done that?

1138
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,141
Every day.

1139
01:11:37,408 --> 01:11:38,444
Told you.

1140
01:11:40,544 --> 01:11:42,480
We ain't that different.

1141
01:11:42,513 --> 01:11:45,217
[Mia gasping]

1142
01:11:47,284 --> 01:11:50,221
You know, it's fitting, really.

1143
01:11:50,254 --> 01:11:51,422
You took my baby away,

1144
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:56,428
now you'll watch me take
what's left of yours.

1145
01:11:56,461 --> 01:11:57,762
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

1146
01:12:02,499 --> 01:12:07,506
I was just trying to
protect my family, my home.

1147
01:12:11,275 --> 01:12:13,043
I'll tell you what.

1148
01:12:13,077 --> 01:12:14,980
I'll give you a
choice, like your man.

1149
01:12:16,146 --> 01:12:17,783
Slide that piece over,
I walk out that door

1150
01:12:17,815 --> 01:12:19,517
and we never see
one another again.

1151
01:12:21,985 --> 01:12:23,055
Are you a killer?

1152
01:12:24,922 --> 01:12:27,024
And you and I can walk
outta here however we like,

1153
01:12:27,057 --> 01:12:29,794
kicking and screaming,
it don't matter.

1154
01:12:31,495 --> 01:12:33,798
How do I know
you'll keep your word?

1155
01:12:38,436 --> 01:12:39,505
This new world of ours?

1156
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:43,842
You don't.

1157
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:47,512
[hard breathing]

1158
01:12:51,615 --> 01:12:52,517
Come on out!

1159
01:12:54,485 --> 01:12:56,522
You crazy sons of
bitches [fires gun].

1166
01:13:35,525 --> 01:13:36,627
Josh, what are you doing?

1167
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,096
I watched you
through the window.

1168
01:13:38,128 --> 01:13:39,029
We told you to stay.

1169
01:13:39,062 --> 01:13:40,865
Your mom and Mia, they need you.

1170
01:13:40,899 --> 01:13:41,767
I know.

1171
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,633
I was supposed to
watch over Mia and Mom,

1172
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:44,569
but you looked so...

1173
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:46,503
I don't care how
I looked, dammit.

1174
01:13:46,537 --> 01:13:47,539
You looked scared!

1175
01:13:51,441 --> 01:13:52,910
Just help me.

1176
01:13:56,647 --> 01:13:58,417
Thank you, thank you.

1177
01:14:06,223 --> 01:14:07,458
Oh, no no no.

1178
01:14:07,492 --> 01:14:08,627
No no no.

1179
01:14:08,659 --> 01:14:11,562
[soft dramatic music]

1180
01:14:11,596 --> 01:14:12,664
Turn around.

1181
01:14:12,696 --> 01:14:14,065
Where's the rifle?

1182
01:14:14,097 --> 01:14:15,533
I left it in the truck.

1183
01:14:15,565 --> 01:14:17,903
All right, I need
you to get this

1184
01:14:17,936 --> 01:14:20,405
to your mom and your
sister, all right?

1185
01:14:20,437 --> 01:14:21,239
I wanna stay with you.

1186
01:14:21,271 --> 01:14:23,274
No, no, listen to me.

1187
01:14:23,307 --> 01:14:24,542
I want you to get
out of here now.

1188
01:14:24,574 --> 01:14:25,910
But I, I...

1189
01:14:25,944 --> 01:14:27,544
[door creaking]

1190
01:14:27,578 --> 01:14:28,614
Hide.

Oh, what have you, uh, turned
into a beautiful butterfly?

1194
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:49,234
And I see that you
have taken a liking

1195
01:14:49,266 --> 01:14:52,037
to my, uh, my dinner set.

1196

[soft dramatic music]

1197
01:14:58,609 --> 01:15:01,680

You know, I could tell
that was your boy.

1220

You know why? Because all
that pussy smells the same.

1221

Come here.

You did good.

You did real good.

1233
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:37,334
You didn't hesitate.

1234

Let's go.

1235
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,675
Okay, let's go.

1236

Let's go.

1237

I thought you were stronger.

1242
01:18:14,605 --> 01:18:15,740
You ain't done hiding.

Keeping them medicated,
hoping and praying.

1252
01:18:54,678 --> 01:18:55,913
Instead of doing what's right,

1253
01:18:55,946 --> 01:18:58,516
what you shoulda done all along.

[Joe] She's gone.

1314
01:25:04,114 --> 01:25:07,051

Why don't you go,
and can you put that

1319
01:25:20,931 --> 01:25:21,632
in the truck for me, please?

1320

I can't.

1340
01:26:50,053 --> 01:26:51,355
I can't go, Joe.

1341
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:57,160
You're not showing
signs of any symptoms.

1342
01:26:57,194 --> 01:26:59,129
We don't even know
if you're infected.

1343
01:26:59,163 --> 01:27:00,364
I mean, you've
been through hell.

1344
01:27:00,396 --> 01:27:03,333
I know, and I would
do it all again for us.

No, Ethan, listen.

You were right.

1351
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:24,888
See, I have enough now,
and I can keep you under.

1352
01:27:24,922 --> 01:27:28,092
So I'll go out and I'll
look because you found this.

1353
01:27:28,124 --> 01:27:30,927
No, look, the rest is
for you and the kids, okay?

1354
01:27:30,961 --> 01:27:32,363
You are such a
stubborn son of a bitch?

1355
01:27:32,395 --> 01:27:34,865
Nobody's coming, Joe!

1356
01:27:36,432 --> 01:27:37,401
I saw them.

1357
01:27:39,203 --> 01:27:40,104
Nobody's coming.

1358
01:27:43,172 --> 01:27:46,710
You were right. I
should have listened.

1359
01:27:46,744 --> 01:27:47,879
I'm sorry, I...

1360
01:27:49,846 --> 01:27:51,114
I just wanted to protect us.

1361
01:27:51,147 --> 01:27:54,718
I thought, I thought
I could protect us.

1362
01:27:56,854 --> 01:27:57,821
I'm sorry.

For bringing our son home.

1366
01:28:22,779 --> 01:28:24,948
I should be thanking him.

Thanks.

1371
01:29:39,522 --> 01:29:41,892
Listen, I gotta go on a run.

1372
01:29:42,892 --> 01:29:44,127
Can I come?

1373
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:45,029
Not this time.

1374
01:29:47,864 --> 01:29:49,599
But while I'm gone, I
need you to look after

1375
01:29:49,632 --> 01:29:51,535

1376

Can you do that?

There's a small cabin
with a chimney, by a lake.

And the water reflects
the sky like a mirror.

keep it tucked away.

And on the porch, there
sat a man and a woman.

1389
01:31:27,596 --> 01:31:30,533
And they're holding
hands and looking out,

disappear, together.
