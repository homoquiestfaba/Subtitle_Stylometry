00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,476
If you have something
better to do,

551
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,430
then by all means.

552
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,410
That was my sister.

553
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,930
She got out of rehab for the
fourth time a few months ago,

554
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,770
so it's important to pick up
the phone.

555
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,680
Oh, right.

556
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:01,170
Uh, so for our project we are
supposed to combine styles.

557
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,500
Excuse me?

558
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,440
What? I gotta see what
I'm dealing with here.

559
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:13,360
Uh, your character is...
Some sort of rodent?

560
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,510
That's Mavis.

561
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,940
She's a teenage honey badger.

562
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,850
She's sort of a loner
and doesn't look like much,

563
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,130
but she uses being
underestimated to her advantage.

564
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,870
World's most fearless creature.
You know?

565
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,210
Honey badgers?

566
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,970
Honey badger don't care.

567
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,950
King cobra?

568
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,880
Boom! Just a snack.

569
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,460
Beehive, no problem.

570
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,620
You know, she has
super thick skin,

571
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,810
so stings, bites,
Internet trolls,

572
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,150
everything just rolls
right off her.

573
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,300
So you're saying I shouldn't
mess with Mavis.

574
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,730
It's not advisable.

575
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,280
Got it.

576
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,330
So I take it you're applying
for the big fellowship.

577
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,650
Yeah. Aren't you?

578
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,386
I think I'm just going to take
some courses at the city college

579
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,480
when I graduate.

580
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,910
My grades outside of art class

581
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,170
aren't exactly going to wow
any admission boards,

582
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,910
fellowship or not.

583
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,170
That may not be true.

584
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,490
[Phone beeps]

585
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,080
[Groans]

586
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,750
Okay, so anyway, what
should we do for the project?

587
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,070
Well, I work large scale
and you work small, so...

588
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,146
Meet somewhere in the middle?

589
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,190
Say like a 4 x 5 canvas?

590
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,000
Okay yeah.

591
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,600
So let's sketch out some ideas
and meet back to hammer 'em out.

592
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,360
Sure. Whatever.

593
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,156
Mr. Arnet loves to assign
these partner projects

594
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,360
but they're always
such a waste of time.

595
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,110
Well, the key is having
a good attitude.

596
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,850
Right.

597
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,020
So it's dylan_collins45.

598
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,870
[Laughs]

599
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,950
Thirst trap.

600
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,020
This is a real person?

601
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,100
I know.

602
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,030
And he's like, actually nice.

603
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,710
He has this sort of
earth-shattering dimple.

604
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,030
Oh.

605
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,960
He's definitely got
his angles down.

606
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Is that a bad thing?

607
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,060
No, not necessarily.

608
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,800
He just looks a little...
Curated.

609
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,560
But I definitely would.

610
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,380
Oh, you're so bad.

611
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,790
Someone has to be.

612
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,400
Sorry babe, I gotta run.

613
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,810
Okay, no worries.

614
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,530
- Bye.
- Bye.

615
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,270
Hey there salty sandwiches.

616
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,920
Hey.

617
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,440
How's the PTSD?

618
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,270
I'm managing.

619
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,600
Hmm.

620
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,920
What's that?

621
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,156
Are you part of the art program?

622
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,090
Yeah. I mean technically.

623
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,590
That's really cool.

624
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,996
You know you don't have
to be shy about it.

625
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,100
You have a thing.

626
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,600
Not many people do, trust me.

627
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,360
Yeah. I, I guess so.

628
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,656
Do you want to come sit with us?

629
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,290
Yeah.

630
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,620
Yeah sure. Yeah.

631
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,870
Hannah, this is Blake and Rose.

632
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,790
Hi Hannah.

633
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,630
Hi there.

634
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,350
So where'd you guys meet?

635
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,630
Chess club?

636
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,610
You doing that again?

637
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,540
Uh...

638
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,780
Oh, a 4.0 isn't good enough.

639
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,426
He's forever puffing up
that college rezzie.

640
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,030
It's not going to puff itself.

641
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,290
Nah, Hannah's new to Lakewood.

642
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,550
We met in "the shit".

643
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,550
Lockdown drill.

644
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,200
Ah, classic.

645
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,390
Last quarter we had a drill
where there was actually

646
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,276
a dude in black roaming
the halls with a fake rifle.

647
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,580
Some parents were pretty miffed.

648
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,210
Yeah but some weren't.

649
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,630
Isn't that the real headline?

650
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,470
Yeah.

651
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,560
Crazy.

652
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,820
So where are you from?

653
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,660
Maryland.

654
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,990
Oh.

655
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,050
Must've been hard to move
to a new school

656
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,140
in the middle of the year.

657
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,570
Yeah, it's been different.

658
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,740
Brothers and sisters?

659
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,410
No. It's just me and my mom.

660
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm an only child too.

661
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,560
Why don't you let the girl
eat her lunch, Rose?

662
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,990
So. What are you doing
after school?

663
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,670
No big plans.

664
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,510
You didn't invite her
to the Plaza?

665
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,920
I was going to.

666
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,180
Or you know, just ask if
you wanted to hang solo.

667
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,000
Lame. That's no fun.

668
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,410
We can all hang out together.

669
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,760
Yeah. Yeah.

670
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,500
That, that sounds cool.

671
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,600
Great. Then it's decided.

672
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,530
Okay, my turn.

673
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,510
This one's on me.

674
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,700
So dom and lobster.

675
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,260
Exactly.

676
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,736
Can I get you guys started
with some drinks?

677
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,280
Yeah um, could we get
some waters?

678
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,940
And I'll have a chardonnay.

679
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,540
I'll have to see some ID please.

680
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,710
Here you go.

681
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,860
What's your birthday?

682
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,800
December 2nd 1998.

683
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,720
Is there a problem?

684
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,110
I come here all the time.

685
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,130
Why don't you go ahead
and send over your manger?

686
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,950
French or Californian?

687

You tell 'em babe.

692
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,240
That was seriously ballsy.

693
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,320
Yeah.

694
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,820
Mmm.

695
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:02,820
Thank you.

696
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,580
I'll be back with some waters.

697
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,740
Thank you.

698
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,570
You don't even want it?

699
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,590
I just wanted to get away
with it.

700
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,000
You are so crazy.

701
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,070
That's why you love me.

702
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,650
Mm-hmm.

703
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,670
Speaking of love, which ones
do you like better?

704
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,890
These?

705
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,670
Ooh.

706
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,966
- Cute, mm-hmm.
- Those are them.

707
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,270
And then we've got these.

708
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,280
Ooh.

709
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,110
Okay, they both look
really good on you.

710
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,090
Perfect.

711
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,690
Then these are yours.

712
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,840
No, I can't let
you give me those.

713
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,950
Why?

714
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,510
They'd be a great shape
on your face.

715
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,246
And my mom doesn't even look at
the credit card bill.

716
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,680
It's nothing really.

717
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,460
Thanks, they're just,
they're not really me.

Sorry, it's my mom.

721
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,300
I have to go.

722
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,690
Seriously?

723
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,016
Well, I should hit
the books anyway.

724
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,800
Chem test tomorrow.

725
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,880
Hmm.

726
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,096
If he brings home an a minus,

727
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,266
parents might put him up
for adoption.

728
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,140
They might.

730
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,810
Good news bad news,

00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,460
it doesn't matter if we keep
destroying the planet.

918
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,120
and I could paint the thought,

919
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,686
but it's also supposed
to be multimedia

920
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,050

What if we have your character
just like, holding it.

922
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,480
And inside the frame we have
her thinking the thought.

923
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,820
The thought inside the frame?

924
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,060
What is she thinking about?

925
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,150
Herself.

927
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,320
She could be taking a selfie.

928
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,400
So... inside the picture there's
a picture of her thinking

929
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,900
about taking a picture
of herself.

930
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,546

in a way
