1
00:00:01,841 --> 00:00:05,174
(enigmatic synth music)

2
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:17,024
(calming music)

3
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:26,627
- Come on, mom, hurry up.
- I'm coming!

4
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,127
- I'm gonna win.
- You are not.

5
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:35,614
(calming music)

6
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:25,817
- Carol Sanders falling behind.

7
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:43,301
- Morning.

8
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:44,134
- Morning.

9
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:01,425
(Wendy giggles)

10
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:11,928
- Who got surprised?

11
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,037
- She beat me by a step.

12
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:15,160
- It could be by 10.

13
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,640
- Yours are on deck.

14
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,473
- Oh good.

15
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:18,570
Clowns will come within 10 seconds.

16
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,710
I gotta hurry, I got
the club luncheon today.

17
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,780
- Oh, uh Raulston called.

18
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:25,283
- Really?

19
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:27,913
- Hm-mm, looks like we got the account.

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,420
Guaranteed three flights
a week Los Angeles.

21
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,487
- You're kidding.

22
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,040
- No, no I'm going down
there today, firm it up.

23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,170
- That's great dad.

24
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,523
- You worked hard for
this, you deserve it.

25
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,411
- Yes I do.

26
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,161
- (laughs) stop.

27
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:50,349
- Frank, Frank!

28
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,293
Hurry up, you're gonna be late for work.

29
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,690
Your eggs are gonna get cold.

30
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,140
- Sorry mom, just not hungry.

31
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,400
- You've got to eat something.

32
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,420
- Just not hungry, I'm not hungry.

33
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,543
- Well, what (indistinct) I've just made?

34
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,673
- See you later.

35
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,960
- Honey, have you seen my log book?

36
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,123
- [Carol] Yeah, by the phone.

37
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,133
- Tied around my neck.

38
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,003
So what's it today, falafel 4:40.

39
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,420
- Do you want to never rescue
the (indistinct) do you?

40
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,710
- Well, actually I do and
it's an old family recipe

41
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,553
- Where's Jill?

42
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,543
- Three guesses

43
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,720
- Great, she'll be late for school again.

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,400
- I'll go get her.

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,233
- Okay.

46
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,310
- Jill, you have to wake up.

47
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,109
Come on Jill, you have to get up.

48
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,526
- Leave me alone.

49
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,440
No Wendy, you can't borrow it.

50
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,390
- But I was just looking at it.

51
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,473
- It's not you, it won't even fit.

52
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:25,493
Give it.

53
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:26,727
Boy, is it not you.

54
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:28,440
- But I just want to look at it.

55
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,064
Come on.
- Would you get out.

56
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:30,897
- Just let me see it.

57
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:32,700
- Wendy, stop it, this
is my leather jacket.

58
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,260
- [Wendy] Come on, just let me--

59
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,093
- [Jill] You're always messing with things

60
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:36,140
you shouldn't even mess with.

61
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,250
Let go, Wendy.

62
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,523
Let go.

63
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:40,370
- Come on, enough.

64
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,873
Get ready for school,
Jill eat your breakfast.

65
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,873
- Mom, I don't eat breakfast.

66
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,970
You know, fighting with me is one thing

67
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,660
but that kid's crazy about you.

68
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,020
- She's in the dweeb stage mom,

69
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,110
I'll bond with her later okay.

70
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,800
- I don't have time for your attitude.

71
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,140
Just get in there eat what's on the table

72
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,040
and get to school.

73
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,893
- Oh, God.

74
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:12,758
(exciting music)

75
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,747
- Hi Mr. Warden.

76
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:41,068
- Hi.

77
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:44,071
- Oh, Western Juniper's huh.

78
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:44,904
- Correct.

79
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,630
I'm impressed.

80
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,463
- Thanks.

81
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,943
- Come on let's go, we're gonna be late.

82
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:59,380
- Natalie just called, she
can't work the luncheon.

83
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,040
I gotta pick up Wendy at school at five.

85
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,962
She's working on a science project.

86
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:05,795
- I can't do it.

87
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:06,628
- Bill, please.

88
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:09,630
- I won't be back from
Los Angeles till seven.

89
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,463
Get your other one, she'll be done--

90
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:13,290
- Jill, I can't even get
her to school on time.

91
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,153
It's not funny.

92
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,090
What, I...

93
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,843
- You love me.

94
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:18,770
- Yeah, I love you.

95
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,820
Okay look fine, I'll
just finish everything.

96
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,220
That's all, I'll just do it.

97
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,076
(slow piano music)

98
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:07,020
- What kind of researcher?

99
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,700
- A medical researcher.

100
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,230
I'm thinking of Stanford.

101
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,920
- Well, you're certainly good
enough in math and science.

102
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,530
But I worry about what it's going to cost

103
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,530
when you're ready to go.

104
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,860
Oh you're so good in math and science,

105
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,920
you'll probably get a scholarship.

106
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,493
- Well, my mom and dad have
been saving since I was born.

107
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,110
- Do you need something?

108
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,560
- No, just surprised anybody else

109
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,910
was putting an overtime
around here besides me.

110
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:47,250
- Great, okay let's start
arranging these by the flowers.

111
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,003
And alternate them, all right.

112
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,359
Thanks so much for coming.

113
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:54,873
I've been lost without you today.

114
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:01,449
(people chattering in the background)

115
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,340
Hi, Jill Sanders please, it's her mom.

116
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,200
- Hello.

117
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,033
- [Carol] Hi sweetheart.

118
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:15,866
- Hi.

119
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,060
- [Carol] Listen, I need
you to do a favor for me.

120
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,412
- What?

121
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:21,245
- I'm running really late

122
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:22,500
and you've gotta pick up Wendy at school.

123
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,750
- Mom, I already made
plays with Brian today.

124
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,591
- I'll let you get those earrings.

125
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,279
- [Jill] Yeah, I can brag.

126
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,760
- Good, thanks.

127
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,080
Don't be late, okay, five o'clock.

128
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,913
- I won't, I won't.

129
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:35,870
- [Carol] Okay, talk to you later, bye.

130
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,703
- Bye.

131
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,680
- Wendy are you sure you wouldn't
like me to wait with you?

132
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,030
Well, I could even give
you a ride home myself.

133
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,570
- What time is it?

134
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,773
- Five to 5:00.

135
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,230
- I'm fine Mrs. Hyde.

136
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,680
My mom will be here any
second, she's never late.

137
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,500
- Well okay.

138
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,077
See you tomorrow honey.

139
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:14,910
- Bye.

140
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,111
- Bye.

141
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:18,528
(slow music)

142
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:29,873
(woman laughing)

143
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:33,281
- (indistinct) get into something
that really puts it heavy.

144
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,800
All right, I appreciate (indistinct).

145
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,853
Okay, bye.

146
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,440
- Excuse me, could you
like uh recommend something

147
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,360
for somebody you just left
and rain in the parking lot.

148
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,943
- Give me a break, okay.

149
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:56,393
- Oh my gosh.

150
00:09:56,393 --> 00:09:59,140
- You got nothing to worry about.

151
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,643
Hey, I'm all yours.

152
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:05,866
(indistinct)

153
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:08,541
- Oh my God.
- What?

154
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,610
- Oh my God, my mom told
me to pick up Wendy.

155
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,443
It's 10 after 5:00.

156
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:12,427
How did this happen?

157
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,621
Where's my jacket?

158
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:17,224
I gotta go, I gotta go.

159
00:10:17,224 --> 00:10:18,974
- All right, see you.

160
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:32,410
(somber piano music)

161
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:38,115
- Still here?

162
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:40,625
- Just waiting for my mom.

163
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,849
- She's late, huh.

164
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,266
- She'll be here in a second.

165
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,203
- Wanna wait inside?

166
00:10:57,203 --> 00:10:58,453
- No, I'm okay.

167
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:05,479
(suspenseful music)

168
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:25,509
(car honking)

169
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:43,585
(suspenseful music)

170
00:12:06,571 --> 00:12:07,490
- Why don't you use the phone,

171
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,450
call somebody.

172
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,290
- No, I'm okay.

173
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:12,532
- Sure now?

174
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,365
- Hmm-mm.

175
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:30,722
(eerie music)

176
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:52,615
(car engine revving)

177
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,983
(somber music)

178
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:49,155
(phone rings)

179
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:54,762
(suspenseful music)

180
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:13,486
- Wendy?

181
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:21,755
Wendy?

182
00:14:26,346 --> 00:14:27,179
Wendy?

183
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:34,247
(suspenseful music)

184
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:42,561
Wendy?

185
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,051
Wendy?

186
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,658
Is she here?

187
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,491
- What?

188
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:54,324
- Is Wendy here?

189
00:14:54,324 --> 00:14:55,170
- What do you mean?

190
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,550
You were supposed to pick her up.

191
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,530
- I know, I looked everywhere.

192
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,587
I can't find her.

193
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,200
- Are you sure you looked
everywhere all over school?

194
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,620
- I looked everywhere.

195
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,819
Oh God her books were lying on the ground

196
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:10,652
in front of the school.

197
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:13,420
- Jill, calm down, calm down sweetheart.

198
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,820
- I know something is wrong.

199
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,180
- Come on, let's go.

200
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,333
- I'm coming too.

201
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,210
- No, you stay here.

202
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,610
Try calling her friends.

203
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:30,095
(somber music)

204
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:37,467
Wendy?

205
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:46,180
Wendy, it's dad, you in there?

206
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,110
- I mean she had like had to go home

207
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,670
with one of her friends
or something, right?

208
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,350
- That's probably right, honey.

209
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,274
Why don't you look down back there.

210
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:54,107
Wendy?

211
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,513
Wendy?

212
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,832
Wendy?

213
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,496
(phone rings)

214
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:24,329
- Hello.

215
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:25,472
- Carol, anything?

216
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:27,222
- No, one's seen her.

217
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:30,211
- I'm calling the police.

218
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:42,812
- [Woman] Right away.

219
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:51,526
- Sorry.

220
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:55,241
- Where were you?

221
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:58,540
It's 7:15, I was getting worried.

222
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,660
- Decided to run home and
clean up a little bit.

223
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,793
- I'm flattered, what's the occasion?

224
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,925
- The occasion is you're special ma.

225
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:10,336
And I'm buying tonight.

226
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:12,800
- No Frank, you can't afford it.

227
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,443
- No, no, no, I insist.

228
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:23,853
- You okay?

229
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:25,103
- I'm fine, ma.

230
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,837
Ma, I'm fine.

231
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:34,388
- Let's eat.

232
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:37,757
- I'm starving.

233
00:17:44,045 --> 00:17:46,462
(indistinct)

234
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:55,643
- Mr. Sanders, I'm not sure, but we found

235
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:57,193
what possibly could be blood out back.

236
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:59,970
Now, just in case, I need
to know Wendy's blood type,

237
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,970
just as a formality.

238
00:18:02,588 --> 00:18:03,421
- O positive.

239
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:04,294
- We'll be up all night,

240
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:05,370
I've got every available
man working on this.

241
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,610
We're gonna question all
the employees at the school

242
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,663
and anybody that might
have seen something.

243
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:10,496
- Okay.

244
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:11,329
- You go home.

245
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:12,251
- No, I wanna say till--

246
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:15,101
- I know you do, but I think
you might be needed at home.

247
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:21,001
(radio chatter)

248
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:36,270
- Is Jill asleep?

249
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,973
- No, no, she can't sleep.

250
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,773
She's fine.

251
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,393
Sorry.

252
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,463
- I know she's okay.

253
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,880
I don't know what went
wrong but I know she's okay.

254
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:11,386
Tell me I'm right. (sobbing)

255
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,208
(knocks on door)

256
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:24,931
- Did you find her?

257
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:25,764
- Yeah.

258
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,847
- She all right?

259
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,570
- I'm not sure.

260
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,363
We found her up at Culbertson road.

261
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,993
She's been raped and
beaten very very badly.

262
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:44,297
(suspenseful music)

263
00:19:58,306 --> 00:20:00,806
(phone rings)

264
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,723
- She's comatose.

265
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:06,770
It might be brain damage,
we won't know for sure

266
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,920
until she comes around.

267
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,043
Neurosurgeon's with her now.

268
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:12,590
- So, that means she
will just be okay, right.

269
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,200
No permanent damage or anything?

270
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,080
- That's right.

271
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,383
She's broken her forearm.

272
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,413
Four cracked ribs and contusions all over.

273
00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:21,413
Now look, I've given you the worst part.

274
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,190
The good part is it was just critical.

275
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,060
She's stable and that's remarkable

276
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,500
considering what she's been through.

277
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,350
There's a good chance for a full recovery

278
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,370
if she comes out of this coma
in the next 24 to 48 hours,

279
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,250
even up to 72 hours, still promising.

280
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,263
But after that--

281
00:20:37,674 --> 00:20:42,627
- Oh my God (sobbing)

282
00:20:42,627 --> 00:20:46,544
- [Woman] Dr. Martinez,
report to OR room five.

283
00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:51,160
(somber music)

284
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:35,665
(suspenseful music)

285
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,063
- I called your mother, she's on her way.

286
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,700
Police have a couple of leads,

287
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,920
but they don't know whether
it was somebody she knew

288
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,373
or somebody passing through.

289
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,433
- If she doesn't come back,

290
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,867
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

291
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:44,519
(children speaking in the background)

292
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,130
- Carol, honey, it's been decided now,

293
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,591
you're going home.

294
00:23:16,591 --> 00:23:18,418
- Come on, you (indistinct).

295
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:19,251
- No.

296
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:22,294
- Come on, you've been here two days now.

297
00:23:22,294 --> 00:23:23,617
- No, no, doctor said.

298
00:23:23,617 --> 00:23:26,101
The doctor said she
could come at any minute.

299
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:27,430
I wanna be here in case she does.

300
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,263
- Come on.

301
00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:32,060
Jill is waiting downstairs
to take you home.

302
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,033
I'm worried about you.

303
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:37,400
So, let this doctor and I will call you

304
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,573
if there's any change, I promise.

305
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:42,964
Come on.

306
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:49,080
(somber music)

307
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:09,252
- Hello.

308
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:12,606
Finally.

309
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:14,739
No, no.

310
00:24:16,218 --> 00:24:18,340
There's no change.

311
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,923
(somber music)

312
00:24:42,725 --> 00:24:44,310
- Where's your grandma.

313
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,540
- She's like still in the cafeteria.

314
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,373
- You okay?

315
00:24:50,842 --> 00:24:51,692
- Dad, I'm sorry.

316
00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:54,572
- For what?

317
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:56,163
- I just feel like this
is like all my fault.

318
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,363
- No, honey, it's not your fault.

319
00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:03,970
- I mean I was the one, you know,

320
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,623
who was supposed to pick her up one time.

321
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,460
I just never thought that...

322
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,560
- You're not to blame.

323
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,140
Nobody's is to blame, it just happened.

324
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,983
It's one of those things that happened.

325
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,680
- You know mom blames me.

326
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,728
- No, she doesn't.

327
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:21,561
- Yeah, she does.

328
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,904
The car right now, she didn't talk to me,

329
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:26,737
she didn't look at me.

330
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:27,670
- She doesn't blame you, honey.

331
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,580
She is sick with grief, she's worried.

332
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,320
She's just not (indistinct).

333
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,227
She doesn't blame you, I know that.

334
00:25:48,723 --> 00:25:51,223
(phone rings)

335
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:53,066
- Hello.

336
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:56,034
Hello.

337
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,807
Is anyone there?

338
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:07,186
Who is this?

339
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:09,197
- How is she?

340
00:26:09,197 --> 00:26:10,216
- [Carol] Who is this?

341
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:12,947
- Is she gonna pull through?

342
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,550
- Who is this?

343
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,890
Tell me, damn it.

344
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,803
- No, no, no, no, you tell her.

345
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:21,697
You tell her to be quiet
'cause I can hurt her again.

346
00:26:23,188 --> 00:26:26,188
(suspenseful music)

347
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,456
- Thank you.

348
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:33,289
Carol what's up?

349
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:35,212
- [Carol] Is Wendy okay?

350
00:26:35,212 --> 00:26:36,390
- Yeah she's fine, what's wrong?

351
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:40,466
- He called here.

352
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,050
- Who?

353
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,545
- [Carol] He threatened to hurt her again.

354
00:26:43,545 --> 00:26:44,378
- What?

355
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,520
- I'm afraid he's gonna kill her.

356
00:26:49,684 --> 00:26:50,980
- All right, now just calm down.

357
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,030
I'll call the police.

358
00:26:56,256 --> 00:26:59,006
(dramatic music)

359
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:25,470
What's the matter, what's wrong?

360
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,303
Everything's under control.

361
00:27:26,303 --> 00:27:27,280
- No, it's not.

362
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,140
Not while he's still out there.

363
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,910
- He won't be for long.

364
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,430
- You have to find him.

365
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,740
You have to find him, I
don't think you understand.

366
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,030
I think he wants to kill her.

367
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,830
- Mrs. Sanders, we're very close.

368
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,350
And until we get him, we've posted a guard

369
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,340
at Wendy's door 24 hours a day.

370
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,270
There is no way he can get to her.

371
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,417
She'll be safe, don't worry.

372
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,760
- Frank, these men want to see you.

373
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,373
- Frank Warden, police.

374
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,270
Get up slowly, we've got
a warrant for your arrest

375
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,020
for the rape and assault of Wendy Sanders.

376
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,260
Get up.

377
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,130
I've also got in order
to impound your car.

378
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,861
- Is this some kind of
joke, I didn't do nothing.

379
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:14,352
- You have the right to remain silent.

380
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:15,681
If you give up the right to remain silent,

381
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:17,730
anything you say can and
will be used against you

382
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,569
in a court of law.
- Please, do something.

383
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:21,712
- You have the right to
speak with an attorney

384
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:23,879
and have an attorney
present during questioning.

385
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:24,712
- I didn't do nothing, ma.

386
00:28:24,712 --> 00:28:25,606
- If you desire and cannot afford one--

387
00:28:25,606 --> 00:28:29,439
- [Frank] I didn't do
nothing, I swear to God.

388
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,497
- Mr. Sanders, we got him.

389
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,740
His name is Frank Warden,
he's been a janitor

390
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,370
at Wendy's school for three months.

391
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,403
He's got two prior charges
on molestation in California.

392
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,700
- God, how does a guy like I get hired?

393
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,410
- He's never been in
trouble in this state.

394
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,760
It didn't show up on the
screening for the job.

395
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,220
But we have good forensic evidence.

396
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,443
The lab found a hair in
his car, it's Wendy's.

397
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,713
Look, there's gonna be an
evidentiary hearing in three days.

398
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,090
A judge will review the case and make sure

399
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,499
the evidence is good
enough to go to trial.

400
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:20,332
- But there's no problem, right?

401
00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:21,165
He's the right guy?

402
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:22,510
- It's just a formality.

403
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,630
The Assistant DA says it's a slam dunk.

404
00:29:28,002 --> 00:29:28,835
- Thanks.

405
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,875
♪ Little star ♪

406
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:38,625
♪ How I wonder where you are ♪

407
00:29:43,557 --> 00:29:45,807
Come back home, sweetheart.

408
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,090
Please Wendy, I miss you so much.

409
00:29:55,284 --> 00:29:59,117
You know what, I can't
go running without you.

410
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,587
I need my running mate.

411
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:12,817
Wendy please.

412
00:30:25,898 --> 00:30:28,333
- It looks like Frank Warden
got himself a top attorney.

413
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,863
- Well, everybody gets an attorney.

414
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:36,600
- Yeah well, not everyone
gets Ellen Wells.

415
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,930
She was the one that
got the cop killer off

416
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,993
last year remember.

417
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,410
And she's a clever one.

418
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:49,380
- It doesn't matter,

419
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,660
they have him and they have evidence.

420
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,310
She can't do anything about that.

421
00:30:55,992 --> 00:30:59,960
(journalists chattering)

422
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,339
- Dave, you know better than that.

423
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:02,500
I'm not gonna say anything
till after the hearing.

424
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,819
- Can you tell us
anything about the crime?

425
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:06,615
- (indistinct) do you
think of what he's done?

426
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,890
- My son is innocent,
he did nothing wrong.

427
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,548
- How do you feel about these accusations?

428
00:31:13,548 --> 00:31:16,798
(chattering continues)

429
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,150
- How can you do this?

430
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,270
How can you defend him after
what he's done to my daughter?

431
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,470
- No verdict has been handed
down yet, Mrs. Sanders

432
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,890
and everyone deserves the best defense.

433
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,330
- Well, I guess you just
have to believe that,

434
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,823
don't you just to keep going.

435
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,840
- There's no doubt then that
the hair found in the car

436
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,560
registered to the defendant Frank Warden.

437
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,500
No doubt that the hair came
from the victim, Wendy Sanders.

438
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,550
- None.

439
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,950
The hair sample found the
car was a perfect match

440
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,700
with the one taken from the Sanders girl.

441
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,550
- Thank you.

442
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,330
That's it your honor.

443
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,750
- Dr. Hall, I read your
report and I have no doubt

444
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,810
whatsoever that the hair
you found in my client's car

445
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,360
matches the hair of the victim.

446
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:09,200
What I do have doubts
about are the procedures

447
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,963
used by the police once Mr.
Warden's car was impounded.

448
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,220
- I don't understand.

449
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,643
- No, I don't understand.

450
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,960
Frank Warden's car was
taken for an evidence search

451
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,830
but it sat in front of a police garage

452
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,840
unguarded for eight hours

453
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,160
before you and your team called it.

454
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,340
- Your honor, is Ms. Wells suggesting

455
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,570
that evidence was planted?

456
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,490
- Not necessarily.

457
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,580
- Then what?

458
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,710
- Chain of evidence, your honor.

459
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,240
Police arrested my client in the house

460
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,800
he shares with his mother.

461
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,060
A tow truck towed the
car from there to the lab

462
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,280
but it was not escorted
by a police officer.

463
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,230
- Oh, come on now.

464
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:44,610
- Chain of evidence from
the time the car was taken

465
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,340
to the time dr hall discovered
the tell-tale hair in it,

466
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,440
it was left unguarded,
unsecured four times,

467
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,700
a total of nine hours 25 minutes.

468
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,860
- Your honor, there is absolutely
no indication whatsoever

469
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,330
that any evidence tampering went on.

470
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,700
- As there is no proof that
any sort of evidence tampering

471
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,830
didn't go on the chain
of evidence was broken

472
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,410
not once but several times

473
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,600
and therefore such
evidence is not admissible.

474
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,770
And even though Mr. Post
has studiously avoided

475
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,090
revealing this, the court must know

476
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,500
that Frank Warden routinely
left his keys in his car

477
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,870
and that any number of friends
and associates knew this

478
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,220
and just as routinely borrowed it

479
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,840
often without permission.

480
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,320
There's simply no telling
how a hair from the victim

481
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,263
got into the car.

482
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,110
What's setting aside the car now?

483
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,760
Was there any other forensic evidence

484
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,840
found on the victim herself.

485
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,543
Any blood, tissue or semen?

486
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,460
- No blood, tissue or semen
from the victim's assailant

487
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,882
was found, no.

488
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:40,130
- That's all, Dr. Hall, thank you.

489
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,670
Your honor, since the
evidence against my client

490
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,503
is tainted.

491
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:45,690
- Wait, we do know that the
accused was the only one

492
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,670
in the school at the time.

493
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,160
- No, we don't.

494
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,010
He was seen at the school
before four o'clock

495
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,890
but no one can place him there after that

496
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,280
and we know the victim wasn't abducted

497
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,680
until closer to five.

498
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,810
Mr. Warden was gone by
then and I have a witness

499
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,810
who can verify that.

500
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,820
- Raise your right hand.

501
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:08,420
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth

502
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,520
and nothing but the truth so help you God?

503
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,500
- Yes, I do.

504
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,333
- Be seated.

505
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,350
Mrs. Warden, did you meet with your son

506
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,950
on the night in question?

507
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:31,700
- Yes, that's the night we have
dinner together every week.

508
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,030
- Where do you meet?

509
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,230
- At Arman's restaurant
out near the interstate.

510
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,370
- Do you have a special time you meet?

511
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,600
- At five o'clock always.

512
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,320
- And was Frank late?

513
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,143
- He was right on time.

514
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,390
- Would you lie under
oath to protect your son.

515
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,973
- No, Ms. Wells, I would not.

516
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,120
- Thank you.

517
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,990
your honor I know detectives
questioned restaurant personnel

518
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,540
regarding the time Frank
Warden showed up that night.

519
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,030
- They served hundreds
of people a day there.

520
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,650
No one could say exactly what
time Mr. Warden was there.

521
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:07,100
- No, but they could verify
that he was indeed there.

522
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,170
Your honor, the district attorney's office

523
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,890
rushed to indictment on this case,

524
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,420
which is understandable
considering the crime.

525
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,460
But we must separate the
emotions in the community

526
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,000
from the process of law
with which we're charged.

527
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,030
Since there is not enough
evidence against my client,

528
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,540
I move that all charges
against him be dismissed

529
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,930
- Mr. Post, if your office turns out

530
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,710
more conclusive evidence,

531
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:44,450
you may pursue a new indictment
against the defendant.

532
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:49,450
For now, I have no choice
but to dismiss all charges

533
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,037
against him.

534
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,577
- All rise.

535
00:36:01,175 --> 00:36:02,971
- Mrs. Wells, I need to talk to you.

536
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:04,203
- Yeah, I bet you wanna talk to me.

537
00:36:10,823 --> 00:36:13,823
(suspenseful music)

538
00:36:33,182 --> 00:36:35,446
(gunshots)

539
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:37,613
(screams)

540
00:36:49,213 --> 00:36:51,796
- Help him please, help my son.

541
00:37:02,043 --> 00:37:03,423
- [Man] Profile please, turn to the right.

542
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:08,452
- I was afraid.

543
00:37:08,452 --> 00:37:10,350
- [Bill] But what was
it doing in your bag?

544
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,300
- [Carol] I know that sounds strange

545
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,223
but I didn't even remember
that it was in here.

546
00:37:15,223 --> 00:37:16,603
- [Bill] I don't care if you forgot,

547
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:17,857
why did you do that,
why did you shoot him?

548
00:37:19,556 --> 00:37:22,056
- Do you think I planned this?

549
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:24,830
Do you?

550
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,123
- No.

551
00:37:31,645 --> 00:37:34,543
I don't know when to think,
this whole thing is a nightmare

552
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,523
and it keeps getting worse.

553
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,320
- We made bail.

554
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,400
- Yeah, how?

555
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,920
- The house.

556
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,440
- That couldn't have been enough.

557
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,130
- I had to put a part
of your business too.

558
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,690
- Oh, jeez.

559
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,763
Thank you Jack, I appreciate it.

560
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,163
So what do we do now?

561
00:37:56,212 --> 00:37:58,570
- Well, you're gonna get
your wife a decent attorney.

562
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,240
- Well, I assumed you
people would be doing that.

563
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,530
- Bill, I'm your corporation
and tax attorney.

564
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,580
I'm not equipped to handle Carol's case.

565
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,510
Nobody in my firm is.

566
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,820
I hope you get the best attorney in town.

567
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,420
Believe me, she's gonna need it.

568
00:38:11,517 --> 00:38:13,500
- In the eyes of the law,
she shot an innocent man.

569
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,700
And if he dies, she could
be tried for murder.

570
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,470
- Mr. Sanders, can you
tell me what your wife

571
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,403
is going to plead?

572
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,380
- Well, I'm sorry, I have no comment.

573
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,050
- Will it be justifiable homicide

574
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,760
or is she going to plead
temporary insanity?

575
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,770
- Mr. Sanders told you, he has no comment.

576
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,960
- Excuse me, excuse me, are
you Carol Sanders husband?

577
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,930
- Yes.

578
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:34,180
- I just wanted to tell you how brave

579
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,660
that I think your wife is.

580
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,780
- Brave?

581
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,820
- That man deserved everything he got

582
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,200
and your wife was the only person

583
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,890
who had the guts to do it.

584
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,510
I saw everything on TV.

585
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,560
Please, tell her that I'm rooting for her

586
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,810
and I'm not the only one.

587
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,360
- Better be prepared Bill.

588
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,710
This is just the beginning.

589
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,559
- Will you plead temporary insanity?

590
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,976
(indistinct)

591
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,340
- How do you see yourself, Mrs. Sanders?

592
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,337
As a vigilante or a hero?

593
00:39:11,968 --> 00:39:13,513
- [Journalist] Mrs.
Sanders, who's your lawyer?

594
00:39:15,348 --> 00:39:18,597
Mrs. Sanders can we
have a comment, please.

595
00:39:18,597 --> 00:39:23,597
Mrs. Sanders, can we
please have a comment?

596
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,297
- Hi sweetheart, I'm back.

597
00:39:33,218 --> 00:39:34,718
I love you, angel.

598
00:39:36,381 --> 00:39:37,714
Can you hear me?

599
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:43,964
I love you.

600
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,100
I talked to the doctor today,

601
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,293
he said you're getting so much better.

602
00:39:51,613 --> 00:39:52,913
You're such a strong girl.

603
00:39:53,915 --> 00:39:54,783
I know how you're fighting.

604
00:39:56,047 --> 00:39:56,880
- Jill?

605
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:03,148
- Sweetheart, I'm back.

606
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:11,166
(somber music)

607
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:18,185
- Mom.

608
00:40:19,187 --> 00:40:20,020
- Wendy.

609
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:28,062
You're safe Wendy, come back.

610
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:29,395
Come back to me.

611
00:40:30,537 --> 00:40:31,870
Come back Wendy.

612
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:38,010
- She was deeply unconscious before.

613
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,520
Now, she's just barely under.

614
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,862
- So, what does that mean?

615
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:43,540
- Well, physically she's out of her coma.

616
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,880
Psychologically, she's in withdrawal.

617
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,180
She's just not ready to remember.

618
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,440
- So you're saying she'll come
out of that too then, right?

619
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,457
- Oh yes.

620
00:40:51,457 --> 00:40:54,360
And when she does, she's
gonna need all of your support

621
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,710
and the best psychiatric
help that's available.

622
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,253
- I really need to get back.

623
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:02,943
- Yeah listen, I'm worried about Jill.

624
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:08,019
- Jill, the girl who hardly
comes to see her sister.

625
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:09,470
- She doesn't come here
because you're here

626
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,330
and she knows you're here

627
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,400
and she thinks you don't wanna see her.

628
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,623
- That's ridiculous.

629
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,500
- Well, maybe not.

630
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:18,052
You hardly ever talk to her.

631
00:41:18,052 --> 00:41:20,000
- Wendy needs me more
than Jill does right now.

632
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,833
- Maybe not.

633
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,420
She thinks you blame her for this.

634
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:25,893
Maybe you do.

635
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,133
- That is so unfair.

636
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:33,570
- Look, we need to be a
family right now, Carol.

637
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,763
We need to be together.

638
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:39,195
- [Woman] Dr. Reid to
ICU, Dr. Reid to ICU.

639
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:40,510
- There's something else I
need to talk to you about too

640
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,030
now, we gotta choose a lawyer.

641
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,438
Now, you haven't met with
any of those people that--

642
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:47,271
- I thought you were gonna
take care of all that.

643
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,104
- Look, I met with all of them

644
00:41:48,104 --> 00:41:49,090
but you have to make the choice.

645
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,730
It's your lawyer, you gotta choose.

646
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,430
I mean you gotta take some
responsibility here, Carol.

647
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,360
- I'm the one that's up
there holding her hand

648
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,810
talking to her, willing her to come back--

649
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,900
- Well, who's gonna do
that if you go to jail?

650
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,710
Carol, who's gonna do
that if you're convicted?

651
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,430
Now we're in a hell of a jam here,

652
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:10,180
we need to find the best
possible criminal lawyer we can.

653
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,013
- [Woman] Dr. Brandt to OR seven.

654
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,950
- You can't be serious.

655
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,610
- I am.

656
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,120
I saw you in action and
I think you're brilliant

657
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,910
and I want you to be my attorney.

658
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,630
- Mrs. Sanders, I only
agreed to meet with you

659
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,730
as a courtesy.

660
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,560
If I'd known you were going
to ask me to represent you,

661
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,310
I never would have let you in here.

662
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,703
Frank Warden is still alive,
I still represent him.

663
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,390
I'm afraid that's all I'm
allowed to say to you legally.

664
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,850
If you would like me to have my secretary

665
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,550
compile a list of criminal
attorneys, I could do that.

666
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,183
Well, I do have one more question.

667
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:53,080
How can you defend people
like him, criminals?

668
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,913
Guilty people?

669
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,070
How can you live with yourself?

670
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,870
- I could ask you the same question.

671
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,070
I'm not the one who shot
a man in cold blood.

672
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,300
- Do you have children Ms. Wells?

673
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,580
- Yes.

674
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,450
- Do you love them?

675
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,283
- Of course.

676
00:43:09,283 --> 00:43:11,060
- Would you do anything in
your power to protect them,

677
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,080
you know from anyone anywhere?

678
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,440
- Mrs. Sanders, that's not the issue.

679
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,430
- Well, I'm not proud of what I did

680
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,983
and I live with that every day.

681
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,870
But Frank Warden was not an innocent man

682
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,490
and we both know that.

683
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:30,290
He was guilty as sin
and you let him go free.

684
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:33,410
The man who raped my 12 year old daughter

685
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,633
and left her for dead.

686
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:40,140
You let his mother lie under oath.

687
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,560
You knew all about it
and you let it happen,

688
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,393
all of it.

689
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,603
You may not have killed a man, Ms. Wells,

690
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,620
but you are every bit as guilty as I am.

691
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,540
- I'm only guilty of
representing my client

692
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,710
to the best of my ability.

693
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,543
In this country you're
innocent until proven guilty,

694
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,243
even you.

695
00:44:22,178 --> 00:44:24,000
- Mrs. Warden.

696
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,833
- Go away.

697
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:30,690
- Mrs. Warden, I'm in
trouble, I need your help.

698
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,433
- Go away.

699
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,980
- Mrs. Warden, I can't go to jail.

700
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,120
My daughter needs me she's very sick

701
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,393
because of something
you are son did to her.

702
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,950
I know that it would be
very hard to believe that,

703
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:53,570
but it's true and you know it.

704
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,870
Please, I just need you to tell the truth.

705
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,503
- Get out of here.

706
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,180
- Mrs. Warden, he will do it again.

707
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,460
Just hear me out.

708
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,480
- I can't hear you out Mrs. Sanders.

709
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,980
I don't have the time.

710
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,423
I have something that I have to do.

711
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,313
I have to bury my son.

712
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,513
Frank died an hour ago.

713
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,900
You're a murderer Mrs. Sanders
and you're going to jail

714
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,900
for a very long time.

715
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,020
And while you're there you
can think about how your child

716
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,950
needs you and about how
I don't have mine anymore

717
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:46,913
because of you.

718
00:45:53,711 --> 00:45:56,294
(somber music)

719
00:46:18,335 --> 00:46:19,410
- My God, I don't believe you.

720
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,670
Ellen Wells, what in the
hell is the matter with you?

721
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,092
What were you thinking?

722
00:46:23,092 --> 00:46:24,590
- You said to get an attorney
the best I could find.

723
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:25,800
She's the best, isn't she?

724
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,266
- That's not the point.

725
00:46:27,266 --> 00:46:28,099
- Isn't she's the best?

726
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:29,640
- The point is she's the
one that's responsible--

727
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,473
- The point is,
- for the...

728
00:46:30,473 --> 00:46:31,760
- She's not gonna represent me anyway.

729
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,193
So, this whole conversation's useless.

730
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,213
- I spoke to Brody.

731
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,050
He recommended Sabitsky, Graboff and Lee.

732
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,330
I have a meeting there tomorrow.

733
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,560
- Well good, that's good.

734
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,710
Look, let's not fight,
I don't wanna fight.

735
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,670
We're on the same side, right?

736
00:46:53,886 --> 00:46:54,719
Right?

737
00:46:57,159 --> 00:46:58,909
- We're not fighting.

738
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:15,924
- [Woman] Dr. Brandt, OR seven.

739
00:47:15,924 --> 00:47:17,674
Dr. Brandt, OR seven.

740
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:22,685
- Mom?

741
00:47:24,306 --> 00:47:26,639
- Hey sweetheart, you're up.

742
00:47:30,082 --> 00:47:31,170
What's the matter?

743
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:32,373
- Why didn't you tell me?

744
00:47:35,944 --> 00:47:36,818
- Tell you what?

745
00:47:36,818 --> 00:47:40,151
- About what happened, about Mr. Warden.

746
00:47:41,245 --> 00:47:42,828
About what you did.

747
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:53,172
- There'll be lots of time
to talk about that later.

748
00:47:56,341 --> 00:48:00,019
I just want you to use all your energy

749
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:04,436
and all your concentration
so you can get well, okay?

750
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,010
- It's my fault, isn't it?

751
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,773
- No, of course not.

752
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,720
- I shouldn't let Mrs. Hyde take me home.

753
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,330
- No, it's not your fault.

754
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,983
- I don't understand.

755
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,290
Mr. Warden was nice to me.

756
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,513
He was my friend.

757
00:48:26,877 --> 00:48:28,103
I trusted him.

758
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,063
Why did he hurt me?

759
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,283
Why did he wanna hurt me?

760
00:48:37,992 --> 00:48:39,863
- I don't have an answer for that.

761
00:48:42,802 --> 00:48:45,302
And I'm not sure anybody does.

762
00:48:47,874 --> 00:48:49,864
- What about you?

763
00:48:49,864 --> 00:48:50,964
Are you gonna be okay?

764
00:48:53,178 --> 00:48:55,678
- Yes, I'm gonna be just fine.

765
00:49:04,878 --> 00:49:05,961
I'm so sorry.

766
00:49:10,622 --> 00:49:12,122
I love you, angel.

767
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:25,020
- God, this is so strange grandma.

768
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,030
I mean, this one says mom
should run for congress.

769
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:28,950
And then one yesterday

770
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,900
says she's no better than Frank Warden.

771
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:35,238
- We used to be such a normal family.

772
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,050
- Why Jill?

773
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:55,220
How could you after all
your sister's been through?

774
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,640
- What happened, what's going on?

775
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,010
- She's making a little progress,

776
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:01,430
just as she's starting
to get a little better,

777
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:04,370
you decide that she has
to know about the trial,

778
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,710
the murder, the shooting.

779
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,160
What are you thinking?

780
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,470
What are you thinking?

781
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:11,860
- Mother, she asked me, okay?

782
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,413
She heard people talking about it.

783
00:50:14,413 --> 00:50:16,640
- Well, I think that's an excuse

784
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,690
and I think it's typical.

785
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:19,840
- What was this supposed
to do, lie to her?

786
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,560
You wish it were me, don't you?

787
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,505
You wish it were me in
the hospital, not Wendy,

788
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:29,373
not your favorite.

789
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,260
- That's insane and I
am sick of hearing you

790
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,093
say things like that.

791
00:50:34,093 --> 00:50:35,460
I don't wanna hear that anymore.

792
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,100
- It's true, you've always loved Wendy

793
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,400
more than you've loved me.

794
00:50:44,968 --> 00:50:46,303
- I didn't know why you wanted to hurt me.

795
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:56,533
I knew even before he
started hitting me real hard.

796
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,117
I knew I was gonna die.

797
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:10,403
When I woke up in the hospital,
I thought I was in heaven.

798
00:51:11,273 --> 00:51:12,433
I thought I was dead.

799
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,140
- Who was the first person you saw?

800
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:22,017
- Mommy, she was the first person I wanted

801
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,413
and the first person I saw.

802
00:51:26,734 --> 00:51:27,773
- And what did you think?

803
00:51:29,334 --> 00:51:30,167
- I was just happy.

804
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:36,223
Now I worry about mommy.

805
00:51:36,223 --> 00:51:38,790
(soft music)

806
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:41,043
Dr. Raulston, I don't
want her to go to jail.

807
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:45,625
(soft music)

808
00:51:55,841 --> 00:51:58,280
- I thought we said everything
we had to say in your office.

809
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,300
- Things are different now Mrs. Sanders.

810
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,623
Frank Warden is dead.

811
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,833
I thought about what you said a lot.

812
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,810
I've always believed that every person

813
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,360
deserves the best defense possible.

814
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,690
There's no way for me to understand

815
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,670
why Frank Warden did what he did,

816
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,520
but I do understand what you did.

817
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,573
I understand your
frustration and your rage.

818
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:27,070
Whether you planned it or not,

819
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,953
even if he was guilty,
what you did was wrong.

820
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:37,780
But if it had been my
daughter that he raped,

821
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,970
if he had tried to kill my daughter,

822
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,360
I don't know what I would have done.

823
00:52:50,111 --> 00:52:50,960
In answer to your question,

824
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,313
yes I would like to represent you.

825
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,010
- She's working through it, it's tough.

826
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,700
Wendy's dealing with so much,

827
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,713
but she's getting better each day.

828
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,830
Your being here every day
has been extremely important.

829
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,000
- Thank you.

830
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,100
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

831
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:19,050
My trial is starting soon and
I won't be able to be here

832
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:20,060
as much as I've been,

833
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:23,160
but Wendy's dad will and her sister

834
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,530
as much as possible.

835
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,930
The worst is over.

836
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:29,880
There's still some rough times ahead

837
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,793
but she's getting better each day.

838
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,860
- No, I mean I'm just like way
in the back of the picture.

839
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,693
- No, you're not.

840
00:53:41,693 --> 00:53:44,120
- Brian really.

841
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,630
Her priorities are all laid out.

842
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:50,113
She's taking care of Wendy,
getting ready for a trial,

843
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,113
trying to keep dad from going insane.

844
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,680
After that, there's not
much time left for me.

845
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,097
- Just tell her that...

846
00:53:59,097 --> 00:54:01,210
- Brian, I've tried.

847
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:02,683
Tried 100 times.

848
00:54:05,016 --> 00:54:08,330
I think it was like this even
before anything happened.

849
00:54:28,402 --> 00:54:31,485
(car engine revving)

850
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:50,993
- Don't stop.

851
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,773
I don't think everyone in the
neighborhood has seen you yet.

852
00:54:57,508 --> 00:55:00,425
(tires screeching)

853
00:55:02,696 --> 00:55:04,240
- So, are you happy?

854
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,530
- Do I look happy?

855
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:06,530
- I know you should.

856
00:55:07,593 --> 00:55:10,193
You got to get out of me and
make Brian feel real bad.

857
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,810
I know you don't like him, I don't care.

858
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,780
He is always there for me.

859
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,480
- I think we're all aware of that.

860
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:21,920
- Well, there might
have been some other way

861
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,510
to do it you know,

862
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:24,920
to let me know you didn't
like what we were doing

863
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,583
besides doing your whole scene.

864
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,700
It was pretty damn embarrassing.

865
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:34,290
- No, embarrassing is
your daughter almost dies

866
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,010
and it's taking her months to come back

867
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:38,340
and your other daughter sits
parked in front of the house

868
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,110
with her boyfriend necking
so the whole neighborhood--

869
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:42,560
- You do blame me, don't you?

870
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,597
- What are you talking about now?

871
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:47,073
- For what happened to Wendy.

872
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,510
- If only I had been there
just two minutes sooner.

873
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:52,390
You think about it every second--

874
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:56,610
- I don't blame anyone
except Frank Warden.

875
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:57,653
- That's a lie.

876
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:01,973
- Jill, I love you,

877
00:56:08,137 --> 00:56:09,510
but I don't understand you sometimes.

878
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:11,830
You don't seem to think of
anyone's problems but your own

879
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,650
and I don't have the time or the energy

880
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:16,210
to deal with those right now.

881
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,460
- Why don't we just admit it,

882
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,587
you have never had the time
or the energy to deal with me.

883
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:22,150
You don't wanna deal with me.

884
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,920
- That is so not true.

885
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,790
- Yeah, because the
truth hurts, doesn't it?

886
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,740
- Just leave me alone.

887
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,450
You can get away from me right now.

888
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:30,283
- Stop it now, damn it.

889
00:56:30,283 --> 00:56:31,116
Stop it.

890
00:56:31,116 --> 00:56:32,070
Now listen, you know how this goes.

891
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:33,230
Let me tell you how this goes.

892
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:36,050
You both just yell until
you get louder and louder

893
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,910
and then one of you says
something that you regret.

894
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,720
And then you don't speak for a while.

895
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,380
And then when you do, the whole damn thing

896
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,270
starts over again.

897
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:46,543
So please just stop it.

898
00:56:59,154 --> 00:57:02,821
- I cannot believe I
got into that with her.

899
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,650
- Oh, come on Tim.

900
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,923
This kind of last minute
crap is beneath you.

901
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:10,543
Well, it used to be.

902
00:57:10,543 --> 00:57:11,376
It's a pot shot.

903
00:57:11,376 --> 00:57:12,960
Shoot at my expert maybe you'll get lucky

904
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,173
and hit him please.

905
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,533
So you're not backing off.

906
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,250
Can you believe it, less
than two weeks till the trial

907
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,240
and the special prosecutor
from the DAs office

908
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,210
wants to exclude our expert witness.

909
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:27,540
- The psychiatrist?

910
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,150
- The pre-trial hearing is tomorrow

911
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:32,440
and he's hoping to to weaken
our temporary insanity defense.

912
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,850
It's a low blow this close to the trial,

913
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,820
especially since the judge
is such a hard-liner.

914
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,603
But if he disallows our shrink,

915
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,780
I'll find something else
and fight like hell with it,

916
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,613
I promise you.

917
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:46,620
Who knows, we might be able to
play this into a continuance.

918
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,843
- That'll be good, I'm
sure that'll be fine.

919
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:01,693
- What's wrong?

920
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,240
- I had a fight with Jill

921
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,700
and uh we said some really
ugly things to each other.

922
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,663
And she took off and I
don't know where she is.

923
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,650
- I realize how hard this must
be for you and your family,

924
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:24,624
but you've got to focus on the trial.

925
00:58:24,624 --> 00:58:25,457
- I know.

926
00:58:25,457 --> 00:58:26,390
- The pre-trial hearing is tomorrow

927
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,420
and you need to concentrate on that.

928
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,200
- Excuse me, Jill Sanders' mother.

929
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,033
I called a little bit ago.

930
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:44,970
- Sure, of course.

931
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,550
I'm sorry Mrs. Sanders,
I still haven't seen her.

932
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:49,260
She hasn't been by.

933
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,770
- What about Brian,
have you heard from him?

934
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:54,320
- No, I checked with the
rest of the employees.

935
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,020
No one's heard a word.

936
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,220
Is Jill okay, Mrs. Sanders?

937
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,320
Is she in any trouble?

938
00:59:00,946 --> 00:59:02,097
- I hope not, thank you.

939
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:19,883
- Brian, where's Jill?

940
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,640
Brian, talk to me.

941
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,970
I need to know who she
is, she's my daughter.

942
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:28,813
- I don't know.

943
00:59:32,122 --> 00:59:33,983
I looked every place I
thought she might be,

944
00:59:34,984 --> 00:59:35,817
I couldn't find her.

945
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:38,480
- Call me if you hear from her.

946
00:59:41,651 --> 00:59:42,484
Thanks.

947
00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:49,746
(somber music)

948
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:17,290
- So, Ms. Wells, where's your client?

949
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,563
Doing a talk show?

950
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:20,493
- No, your honor.

951
01:01:20,493 --> 01:01:23,150
In fact my client has
turned down all requests

952
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:23,983
for all kinds--

953
01:01:23,983 --> 01:01:26,410
- Please Ms. Wells, spare
us the media update,

954
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:27,810
where is she?

955
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:30,830
- Your honor, Mrs. Sanders
has been so preoccupied

956
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:32,920
with caring for her daughter
that she can barely keep track

957
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,920
of what hour it is let alone what day.

958
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,040
- I'm sure you're not trying to sell me

959
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,733
some sort of a schedule mix-up, correct?

960
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,440
- Correct your honor.

961
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,770
- All right, now regarding
Mr. Reimer's motion

962
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:49,770
to exclude your expert witness, Dr. Green,

963
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,080
motion denied.

964
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,590
Now the next time we see each other,

965
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:57,330
I want Carol Sanders here.

966
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:58,170
- She will be.

967
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:01,130
- She better because I've
set a firm trial date

968
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:05,470
for Monday morning at 9:00
a.m. before Judge Roth.

969
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:06,880
- She will be here, I promise.

970
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,390
- Well if she isn't, I'm
going to issue a bench warrant

971
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:12,700
for her arrest, which
means her bail is revoked

972
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,883
and she'll be spending her trial in jail.

973
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:18,053
- [Man] All rise.

974
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,152
- Mr. Sanders.

975
01:02:24,152 --> 01:02:25,427
- I don't know where the hell she is.

976
01:02:25,427 --> 01:02:26,260
I'm looking everywhere for her.

977
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,280
- She's got to realize this
judge will eat her alive.

978
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,090
I told her that, I told you that.

979
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:31,747
How could you let this happen?

980
01:02:31,747 --> 01:02:32,580
- Well, I didn't let this happen.

981
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,260
There's a lot of stuff
that's been going on

982
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,371
at our home Ms. Wells.
- I know that.

983
01:02:36,371 --> 01:02:37,204
I know how tough it is,

984
01:02:37,204 --> 01:02:38,650
but she's gotta get her
priorities straight.

985
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:39,600
- Well, that's quite a statement

986
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,050
coming from someone like you.

987
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,080
- It would seem to me
that the first priority

988
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,410
would be to get Carol acquitted.

989
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:50,590
- Look, you just do for her
what you did for Frank Warden,

990
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:51,924
we'll get along fine.

991
01:02:51,924 --> 01:02:52,757
- That's what I'm trying to do,

992
01:02:52,757 --> 01:02:54,400
but I can't do anything
if she doesn't show up.

993
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,313
- Right, fine.

994
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:02,742
(dramatic music)

995
01:03:33,345 --> 01:03:36,678
- I've been thinking about what you said

996
01:03:39,933 --> 01:03:42,363
that I blamed you for
what happened to Wendy.

997
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,473
Maybe I did.

998
01:03:50,533 --> 01:03:52,663
I was looking to blame someone, anyone.

999
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,483
I was in so much pain.

1000
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,453
But it wasn't fair, Jill.

1001
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:05,120
I couldn't admit the truth

1002
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,003
that I blame myself.

1003
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:15,530
I couldn't face the truth,

1004
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:20,530
that's why I was so angry
at you and everybody.

1005
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,966
- Mom, none of this was your fault.

1006
01:04:23,966 --> 01:04:24,799
- Yes.

1007
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,713
- No, none of this, you are not to blame.

1008
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,923
Maybe dad's right,

1009
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,080
maybe none of us are to blame.

1010
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:40,923
Maybe if just you and I quit
pointing fingers at each other.

1011
01:04:43,415 --> 01:04:46,237
It just seems like we're
always like fighting or yelling

1012
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,990
or something and I mean

1013
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:53,710
maybe we should just...

1014
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,660
You know, we're never just
able to talk like this.

1015
01:05:03,243 --> 01:05:05,660
(slow music)

1016
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:16,700
- Hello Mrs. Hyde.

1017
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,610
- Mr. Sanders, how's Wendy.

1018
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,860
- Oh, she's getting better every day.

1019
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,603
- I'm so pleased to hear that.

1020
01:05:24,932 --> 01:05:25,765
I can't tell you.

1021
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,623
This is everything from
Wendy's desk and locker.

1022
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,820
I kept putting it off

1023
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,353
until I admitted she wasn't
coming back to school this year.

1024
01:05:37,399 --> 01:05:38,232
- Thank you.

1025
01:05:38,232 --> 01:05:40,600
- It was terrible what happened to her.

1026
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,023
We were all just heart sick.

1027
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:46,000
- Did you hire him?

1028
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:49,750
- Custodial help comes
to the district office.

1029
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:50,970
- Yeah, but you're the principal,

1030
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:52,603
you had to approve him, right?

1031
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:58,220
- He passed all the standards
we applied to our applicants.

1032
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,891
There was no way we could have--

1033
01:05:59,891 --> 01:06:01,140
- But didn't you check his records?

1034
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:05,260
I mean he had two child
molestation charges in California.

1035
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:07,970
- We only check on a statewide basis

1036
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:09,420
and there was no file on him.

1037
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:14,630
- So what you're saying is
that there could be people

1038
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:15,810
like Frank Warden.

1039
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:18,250
- That's how it's done Mr. Sanders.

1040
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,583
It's no excuse but that's how it's done.

1041
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:24,810
Wendy is a lovely child and I'll be sorry

1042
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:27,243
for what happened to her
for the rest of my life.

1043
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:31,630
- And she'll make sure
this never happens again.

1044
01:06:49,163 --> 01:06:49,996
- Ready?

1045
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:56,493
- No, not yet.

1046
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,723
- Wendy, you look great.

1047
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,073
- It's not that,

1048
01:07:07,429 --> 01:07:08,262
I think I'm scared

1049
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,473
Is that silly?

1050
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,090
- No, baby, that's not silly.

1051
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,150
- It's just that,

1052
01:07:19,552 --> 01:07:22,143
I mean it's all my friends,

1053
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,230
people I like, people that like me.

1054
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:34,450
I feel different

1055
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,710
and they're still the same.

1056
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,020
Do you think they'll still like me?

1057
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:48,394
- More.

1058
01:07:49,561 --> 01:07:50,394
I like you more.

1059
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,460
Wendy, everybody out there thinks

1060
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:56,723
that you are just like the
bravest person in the world.

1061
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,130
You have been so strong for so long

1062
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:04,440
and they all just love you
and admire you for that.

1063
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,293
So do I.

1064
01:08:09,657 --> 01:08:11,957
- Enough to let me borrow
your leather jacket?

1065
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:16,743
- Yes, enough to let you
borrow my leather jacket.

1066
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,700
- Okay, I'm ready.

1067
01:08:25,794 --> 01:08:28,377
(somber music)

1068
01:08:47,997 --> 01:08:49,497
- Good to see you.

1069
01:09:00,662 --> 01:09:01,674
- Oh, Bill.

1070
01:09:01,674 --> 01:09:02,624
- Yeah.

1071
01:09:02,624 --> 01:09:03,680
- We need some more lemonade.

1072
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,160
- Oh well, just one minute.

1073
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,087
I'll just (indistinct).

1074
01:09:07,766 --> 01:09:09,366
- Oh my God, I don't believe it.

1075
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,660
More letters every day

1076
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:19,173
and from places I've never even heard of.

1077
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:28,550
Bill, have you given any thought

1078
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:32,770
to what might happen to
Carol if she's convicted

1079
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:34,160
and if she...

1080
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:41,920
- Yeah, yeah, I think
about it all the time.

1081
01:09:44,516 --> 01:09:45,920
I think about nothing else.

1082
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,753
- Me too.

1083
01:09:48,426 --> 01:09:51,110
- You know it's first
degree, she could get life.

1084
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:52,650
What'll happen to her?

1085
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:53,953
What'll happen to us?

1086
01:09:57,450 --> 01:10:01,867
(children playing in the background)

1087
01:10:14,508 --> 01:10:19,508
- I cannot hurt you with my (indistinct).

1088
01:10:29,121 --> 01:10:31,451
- [Mrs. Warden] You're
a murderer Mrs. Sanders

1089
01:10:31,451 --> 01:10:34,598
and you're going to jail for a long time.

1090
01:10:34,598 --> 01:10:37,181
(tense music)

1091
01:10:52,029 --> 01:10:53,700
- Tell us Carol, how did you feel

1092
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:55,460
when you heard the charges
against Frank Warden

1093
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,230
were being dropped?

1094
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:58,063
- I'll try.

1095
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:02,930
Shock at first.

1096
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:06,343
Complete shock and disbelief.

1097
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:11,170
Everybody knew that he was guilty.

1098
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:13,243
- I have to object to that.

1099
01:11:13,243 --> 01:11:14,243
- Sustained.

1100
01:11:15,273 --> 01:11:18,440
- Whatever your feelings were,
the evidence didn't work out.

1101
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,940
- Well, I got the impression

1102
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,700
and I had that impression
from Detective Metcalf

1103
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,970
and the district attorney
that they had evidence

1104
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:31,770
that there was no doubt
about who had raped

1105
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:36,110
and beaten my daughter almost to death.

1106
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:39,950
And that whoever had done
it would be punished for it.

1107
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:41,680
So I felt outraged.

1108
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,940
- Okay.

1109
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:44,333
What else did you feel?

1110
01:11:46,105 --> 01:11:49,880
- The most intense hatred I've ever known.

1111
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:55,673
I hated him more than
I thought anyone could.

1112
01:11:58,286 --> 01:11:59,740
It was crippling.

1113
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:01,200
- What happened next?

1114
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,600
- When the judge said
that he could go free,

1115
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,330
I got up and I dropped my purse

1116
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:10,770
and that's when I saw it, I saw the gun.

1117
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:15,720
And I picked it up and I looked up at him

1118
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,253
and he was laughing.

1119
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,623
I saw Frank Warden laughing.

1120
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:26,910
- Do you usually carry a gun?

1121
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,713
- No, never.

1122
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:31,463
It was my husband's.

1123
01:12:31,463 --> 01:12:33,120
He keeps it for protection.

1124
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,450
I didn't even like having it in the house.

1125
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:37,010
- What were you doing with it?

1126
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:41,640
- Someone had called and
threatened my daughter's life

1127
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,560
and I panicked I got the gun
and I put it into my purse.

1128
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,690
- You told police of
this threatening call.

1129
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:50,310
Did they take the threat seriously?

1130
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:52,660
- They took it seriously
enough to put a policeman

1131
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,040
outside Wendy's room.

1132
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:54,873
- Okay.

1133
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:59,413
You were in the courtroom,
you saw the gun,

1134
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:01,600
then what happened?

1135
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,793
- Something snapped in me.

1136
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,113
I lost control.

1137
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:15,680
It was like I was watching
myself from the outside,

1138
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,683
looking at myself and not
being in the middle of it.

1139
01:13:27,667 --> 01:13:32,667
I'm sorry (indistinct). (sobbing)

1140
01:13:37,274 --> 01:13:38,107
My lovely,

1141
01:13:43,174 --> 01:13:44,507
lovely daughter.

1142
01:13:53,224 --> 01:13:55,750
- When you reached for
the gun in your purse,

1143
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:58,690
did you intend to kill Frank Warden?

1144
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:02,143
- No, I didn't intend anything.

1145
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:06,130
It was like my system was overloaded

1146
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:09,617
and I was being pushed to a
place I had never been before.

1147
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:13,040
I know that might be hard to understand.

1148
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,670
- No, I think that many of us

1149
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:16,220
could begin to understand that.

1150
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:23,270
Carol, did you plan to kill
Frank Warden that day in court?

1151
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:25,543
- No, I did not.

1152
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:30,283
- At the time you shot Frank Warden,

1153
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,027
did you know who you were?

1154
01:14:34,027 --> 01:14:35,188
- I don't understand.

1155
01:14:35,188 --> 01:14:36,180
- Well, you are Carol Sanders yes

1156
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,193
and you've always been Carol Sanders.

1157
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:41,925
So on that day did you
think you were someone else?

1158
01:14:43,494 --> 01:14:44,327
- No, I did not.

1159
01:14:44,327 --> 01:14:46,730
So you were fully aware of who you were

1160
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:48,570
the whole time, correct?

1161
01:14:48,570 --> 01:14:50,450
- Yes that's correct.

1162
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:52,400
- And did you know where you were then?

1163
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,093
- Yes, I did.

1164
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:59,660
- Did you know who Frank Warden was?

1165
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,720
You didn't forget his identity, did you?

1166
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:05,000
- I knew only too well
who Frank Warden was.

1167
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,260
- You pulled a gun from your purse,

1168
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,050
you put your finger on the trigger,

1169
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:13,047
aimed it at Frank Warden
and shot him dead.

1170
01:15:13,047 --> 01:15:14,319
- Is there a question your honor

1171
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:15,940
because this is all in
video, it's not disputed.

1172
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:19,720
- Question, at the second
you pulled the trigger,

1173
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,913
did you want Frank Warden to be dead?

1174
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:32,970
- At that very second, I guess
I must have wanted him dead.

1175
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:46,330
But I didn't plan it, it just happened.

1176
01:15:53,289 --> 01:15:56,289
(slow somber music)

1177
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,520
(indistinct)

1178
01:16:10,556 --> 01:16:13,139
- Everything, that's all of it.

1179
01:16:17,403 --> 01:16:18,744
I'm supposed to be the father,

1180
01:16:18,744 --> 01:16:22,150
I'm supposed to be there to protect her

1181
01:16:25,773 --> 01:16:27,623
and you and I didn't, I wasn't there.

1182
01:16:29,094 --> 01:16:30,317
I wasn't there for any of you.

1183
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,310
I let you down.

1184
01:16:37,584 --> 01:16:40,194
- You didn't let us down.

1185
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:41,027
You did everything you could.

1186
01:16:41,027 --> 01:16:43,060
There's nothing more you could have done.

1187
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:48,103
- (indistinct) we could've survived.

1188
01:16:50,633 --> 01:16:53,133
(piano music)

1189
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:59,930
- Detective Metcalf,
who brought the charges

1190
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:00,910
against Frank Warden?

1191
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:02,430
- Assistant DA Post.

1192
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:04,600
- Did Mr. Post believe he
had sufficient evidence

1193
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,520
for a conviction?

1194
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,611
- He said it would be a slam dunk.

1195
01:17:07,611 --> 01:17:08,650
- But it wasn't, was it?

1196
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:09,950
- But it should have been.

1197
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:12,233
Case unraveled.

1198
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:15,600
I never had a case that was quite like it.

1199
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,713
No, that was anything like it.

1200
01:17:18,626 --> 01:17:20,950
We should have followed
procedures a little more closely,

1201
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,840
especially regarding the evidence.

1202
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,040
- What did you wanna do?

1203
01:17:25,621 --> 01:17:26,454
- I don't understand.

1204
01:17:26,454 --> 01:17:27,287
- You were convinced he was guilty

1205
01:17:27,287 --> 01:17:28,540
but he was going to walk away from it.

1206
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:30,960
Did you have any reaction to that?

1207
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,730
- I wanted to kill him.

1208
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:33,563
I'm a father.

1209
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:36,570
For just a second, I was thinking.

1210
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:39,610
Well, I wasn't thinking, I was so angry

1211
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:42,153
and so frustrated and I'd worked so hard.

1212
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:47,260
I guess I went a little
crazy for a second.

1213
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,743
- Insane, just temporarily.

1214
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:53,763
- Yes.

1215
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:08,952
(dramatic music)

1216
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:35,810
- Tell us how this happened, Dr. Green.

1217
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:38,280
- She suffered two severe shocks.

1218
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,303
Once when the charges against
Frank Warden were dropped,

1219
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:46,570
the second time when she
felt the gun in her hand.

1220
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:48,030
She lost all touch with reality

1221
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:50,840
in what's known as a dissociative state.

1222
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,250
She felt nothing, heard
nothing, saw nothing.

1223
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,483
She just reacted.

1224
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:57,890
There was no way she could
have stopped herself.

1225
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,080
- The defense asks you
to believe that a woman

1226
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,600
with a normal childhood and
no history of mental problems

1227
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:10,460
forgot she had a loaded gun in her purse.

1228
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:13,640
And they want you to
believe that she was insane

1229
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,960
for only a minute

1230
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,150
and isn't held accountable
for her actions during it.

1231
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:23,140
A minute by the way in
which she did something

1232
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:26,563
she now admits she very
badly wanted to do,

1233
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:31,520
kill a man she hated with
every fiber of her being.

1234
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,113
I think that's just too
much to ask you to believe.

1235
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,350
The answer that deserves
is a verdict of guilty

1236
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:39,493
in the first degree.

1237
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:42,740
Now there's one more issue here

1238
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,973
needs to be addressed, justification.

1239
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:52,270
The crime committed against
Mrs. Sanders daughter

1240
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:55,580
is the kind of thing that
stirs up vengeful emotions

1241
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,860
in most of us.

1242
01:19:56,860 --> 01:20:00,343
It makes us wanna get up
and go set things right,

1243
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:03,030
doesn't it?

1244
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:05,410
But we can't work that way.

1245
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:08,633
We have laws, we have police.

1246
01:20:09,650 --> 01:20:11,600
We have courts.

1247
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:16,253
When we feel justified in
enforcing the law for ourselves,

1248
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:22,093
well, chaos is right around
the corner for all of us.

1249
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:28,303
- Last night saying good night to my son,

1250
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:31,400
I thought about how I would react

1251
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,700
if someone hurt him in
a brutal, degrading,

1252
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:36,790
painful way

1253
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:42,323
and how I'd feel if that
person was somehow let go.

1254
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:46,130
Given the sudden opportunity
to right that wrong,

1255
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:47,973
would I be able to control myself.

1256
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:52,500
I know it's possible for a
mother who loves her child

1257
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,590
as much as I love mine and
as much as carol loves hers

1258
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:57,033
to lose control.

1259
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,293
Carol finally ran out of control.

1260
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:04,320
She'd been using all
her strength to hang on.

1261
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,090
And on that day in this courtroom,

1262
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:09,493
she simply ran out of control.

1263
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:14,960
She's a woman whose heart was torn apart

1264
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,763
by a violent, senseless act.

1265
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,690
What she did was neither
planned nor premeditated.

1266
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:27,750
I know you know that

1267
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:28,930
and you understand that.

1268
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:31,750
And I'm asking you to acquit her

1269
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,603
by reason of temporary insanity.

1270
01:21:48,214 --> 01:21:50,964
(dramatic music)

1271
01:22:25,642 --> 01:22:26,475
- All rise.

1272
01:22:29,566 --> 01:22:31,066
You may be seated.

1273
01:22:35,248 --> 01:22:37,140
Has the jury reached a verdict?

1274
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,460
- We have your honor.

1275
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,760
- [Judge] What is the verdict?

1276
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:43,110
- We find the defendant
guilty of manslaughter.

1277
01:22:44,022 --> 01:22:47,105
(suspenseful music)

1278
01:22:58,048 --> 01:23:00,465
- Mrs. Sanders, please stand.

1279
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:06,420
The verdict of this jury

1280
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,953
now becomes the judgment of this court.

1281
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:13,260
I pronounce you guilty of
the crime of manslaughter.

1282
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:34,493
Order, order.

1283
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:38,030
I'm setting a sentencing hearing

1284
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:39,060
for two weeks from today.

1285
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:41,230
- The penalty for
manslaughter is less severe.

1286
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:43,913
- I can't wait, I've gotta know right now.

1287
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,430
- Your honor, may I confer with my client

1288
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,140
before you dismiss the court?

1289
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:51,170
- Ms. Wells, this is highly unusual.

1290
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:52,220
- Please, your honor.

1291
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:54,533
- Very well.

1292
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:59,299
- We're exhausted, we can't
spend two weeks waiting.

1293
01:23:59,299 --> 01:24:01,399
We have to move on, we have to keep going.

1294
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:06,880
- Your honor, my client
seeks closure to this.

1295
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,790
Her emotional journey
over the last few months

1296
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:12,020
as we've revealed in this
trial has been incredible.

1297
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:12,910
- What are you requesting?

1298
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:14,890
- Mrs. Sanders is ready
to hear her sentencing

1299
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:15,903
as soon as possible.

1300
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,233
- Granted.

1301
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:24,520
Pending no objection from the prosecutor,

1302
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,980
tomorrow then at 10:00 a.m.

1303
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:30,343
I'll review my notes and
hand down the sentence.

1304
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,470
- Thank you, your honor.

1305
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:34,543
- [Judge] All rise.

1306
01:24:46,216 --> 01:24:47,490
- The judge wrote sentencing patterns.

1307
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:49,390
You're gonna draw five
years more than likely.

1308
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:51,290
You could be paroled in
three and a half years

1309
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:52,503
and I'm not done.

1310
01:24:53,653 --> 01:24:55,570
I'm filing an appeal and I'm
going for a sentence reduction

1311
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:57,160
as soon as possible.

1312
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,660
- But I mean, she's going
to jail tomorrow, right.

1313
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:05,783
- I'm so sorry.

1314
01:25:08,199 --> 01:25:11,032
(dramatic music)

1315
01:25:22,085 --> 01:25:23,057
- I'm scared.

1316
01:25:23,057 --> 01:25:24,201
- I know.

1317
01:25:24,201 --> 01:25:25,333
I think that's permissible.

1318
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:30,633
Listen, whatever happens,

1319
01:25:32,378 --> 01:25:34,103
you've already been through the worst.

1320
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:37,960
Now you and I know that
we're watching Wendy

1321
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:41,563
go through this is the worst
thing that can ever happen.

1322
01:25:42,990 --> 01:25:43,990
She's gonna be fine.

1323
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,097
So are you.

1324
01:25:52,992 --> 01:25:55,043
- I love you so much.

1325
01:25:55,043 --> 01:25:57,626
(somber music)

1326
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:17,060
- Your honor the state
requests the maximum sentence,

1327
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,010
10 years in prison.

1328
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,380
- Ms. Wells, anything?

1329
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:22,213
- Thank you.

1330
01:26:24,490 --> 01:26:25,990
I would ask please that you remember

1331
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:27,620
the tragedy my client has endured,

1332
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:29,310
all she's had to go through,

1333
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:31,420
and especially the fact that
her daughter's recovery,

1334
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:34,360
though significant so far is incomplete.

1335
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,693
And that Mrs. Sanders
has been integral to it.

1336
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:43,670
- Does anyone else have anything to say

1337
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:46,520
about this matter before the
court renders it's decision?

1338
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:51,130
- I do, your honor.

1339
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:52,890
- [Judge] Who spoke?

1340
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:53,723
- Ms. Warden.

1341
01:26:53,723 --> 01:26:55,283
I would like to say something.

1342
01:26:57,070 --> 01:26:58,370
- Come forward Ms. Warden.

1343
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,970
- It's important for me to say this.

1344
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:16,210
I don't know what it
means to you, your honor.

1345
01:27:16,210 --> 01:27:19,630
I mean you're going to
do what you've decided,

1346
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:22,563
but I want you to know how I feel.

1347
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,363
- Go on Ms. Warden.

1348
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:31,723
- I loved my son, he was my only child,

1349
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,053
all I lived for.

1350
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:38,080
But things didn't work out for him.

1351
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,570
I did what I could but
he always had trouble

1352
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:42,803
or he got into trouble.

1353
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:49,333
I lied to you.

1354
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:54,463
I had to, he's my child.

1355
01:27:55,550 --> 01:28:00,550
But I didn't think that
it would lead to Frank

1356
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:02,253
getting let go.

1357
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,740
I thought you'd all prove what he'd done

1358
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:07,560
and he'd be punished.

1359
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,603
But I wasn't going to help you to do it,

1360
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,013
I'm his mother.

1361
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:19,070
But he did do it and I'm so ashamed.

1362
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:25,150
I mean that...

1363
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:28,833
This beautiful little girl,

1364
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:33,970
she suffered so much and
she'll keep on suffering.

1365
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:38,253
He didn't tell me but I knew
because I knew him so well.

1366
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:44,410
Your honor, if you send her to jail,

1367
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:46,223
it won't bring back my son.

1368
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:52,130
It won't make what he did
to her daughter go away,

1369
01:28:52,990 --> 01:28:56,493
it won't erase the terrible
ugly thing that he did.

1370
01:28:57,630 --> 01:28:59,010
It won't do anything

1371
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:04,640
except make our misery last longer,

1372
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:07,703
Wendy's, hers and mine.

1373
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,823
- Thank you Mrs. Warden.

1374
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:36,240
I'm ready to hand down my decision now.

1375
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:43,720
The beauty of our legal system
is overall that it works

1376
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:45,513
all on its own.

1377
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,390
If we perceive that it is not working,

1378
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:49,510
we do not have the right

1379
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:51,843
to take our own corrective measures,

1380
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,623
especially violent ones.

1381
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,283
If we do that, we will
not have a just society.

1382
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:04,240
Mrs. Sanders, for the crime
you have been convicted of,

1383
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:06,870
manslaughter, I had originally intended

1384
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:08,633
a sentence of six years.

1385
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:15,380
Now, as this is unlike
any case I've ever had

1386
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:17,600
and after long long consideration

1387
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,430
and owing to the many tragic
and extenuating circumstances,

1388
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:24,233
I'm reducing that sentence to three years.

1389
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:28,713
With good behavior, that sentence
is reducible to 24 months.

1390
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:34,030
And I'm allowing weekend
visitations with your family

1391
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:37,243
so that you may begin the healing process.

1392
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:41,663
It's been long overdue.

1393
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:45,860
This court is adjourned.

1394
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:48,933
- [Man] All rise.

1395
01:30:53,626 --> 01:30:56,543
(slow piano music)

1396
01:31:39,814 --> 01:31:42,564
(ethereal music)
