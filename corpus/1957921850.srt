1
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:06,289
- Okay.

2
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:09,647
Where are you?

3
00:02:11,857 --> 00:02:12,656
All right.

4
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:53,073
Shit.

5
00:02:56,497 --> 00:02:57,457
Don't come any closer.

6
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:58,385
This will burn you.

7
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,681
Who's there?

8
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:10,705
Shit, no!

9
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:13,616
No, no, no, no, no.

10
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,441
Listen.

11
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,033
I'm sorry.

12
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:25,584
I won't tell anyone.

13
00:03:26,512 --> 00:03:27,729
Please.

14
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,041
Just let me go home.

15
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:36,177
Hello, if anyone can hear me,

16
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,064
my name's Keith Barren.

17
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:40,369
I work at Brooke's
Hardware Store.

18
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,904
There's something terrible here.

19
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:43,185
I tried to figure it out.

20
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:46,160
Stay away!

21
00:03:47,664 --> 00:03:49,584
Stay away from me!

22
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:51,153
You have to fight them.

23
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:52,176
You have to-

24
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:53,136
Oh, shit.

25
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:57,200

49
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:56,976
- Yes, sir.

50
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:58,800
- Just got this resume
in, can you look it over?

51
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:03,791
- Sam Coleman?

52
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:07,217
Doesn't look like he has
much experience.

53
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:10,641
Oh, but he does have his
high school GPA here.

54
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:11,504
- Hire him.

55
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:12,721
I don't give a shit who he is.

56
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:15,344
It's better he doesn't have any
experience, no expectations.

57
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,328
We just need somebody
for Black Friday.

58
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:19,151
- Sir, maybe we
should look around.

59
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:20,593
- Sam Coleman.

60
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:21,424
Hire him.

61
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:23,408
- All right, boss man.

62
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:24,241
Will do.

63
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:33,489
♪ A Brooke's day is
a great day ♪

64
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:51,153

65
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:52,144
You can do this.

66
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:53,968
Here we go.

67
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:54,801
Hello?

68
00:06:56,273 --> 00:06:58,768
I was wondering if you guys
have any job openings available?

69
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:01,585
One panini, no tomato.

70
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:03,280
- Oh no, no, I said,

71
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:04,497
are you guys hiring?

72
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:07,185
I actually have my
resume right here.

73
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:09,617
- Sir, this is a drive-through.

74
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:12,656
If you want an application,
you can come in.

75
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:16,785
- Never mind, I'll take
a burger, no cheese.

76
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,569
I'm lactose intolerant.

77
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,681
- Thank you, your total
will be at the window.

78
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,544
- It's okay, it's okay.

79
00:07:57,584 --> 00:07:58,577
- Hello?

80
00:07:58,609 --> 00:07:59,377
- Sam Coleman?

81
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:00,497
- Yeah, that's me.

82
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:01,840
- Gene, Brooke's Hardware Store.

83
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:03,057
- Oh, hello.

84
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:03,856
- Listen.

85
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:06,128
We loved your resume.

86
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:09,104
How would you like to start,
well, today?

87
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:12,913
- Yeah!

88
00:08:14,256 --> 00:08:15,664
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

89
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:16,465
Hey!

90
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,488
Yeah!

91
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:25,264
Shoot.

92
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,400
Oh, hello, mom?

93
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,200
I got a job.

94
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,737
Can you believe it?

95
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,145
Yeah, Brooke's Hardware.

96
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:42,192
What?

97
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:43,025
Mom?

98
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,593
Hello?

99
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,225
Mom, can you hear me?

100
00:08:48,624 --> 00:08:49,776
Hello?

101
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,609
Mom, you there?

102
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:52,464
You there?

103
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:54,416
Hello?

104
00:08:58,864 --> 00:09:00,305
- Sam.

105
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:02,225
I'm impressed, you
made good time.

106
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:03,568
Gene Knibbs here.

107
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:04,368
I assume you remember me?

108
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:05,648
- Yeah, yes, of course.

109
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:06,481
- Follow me.

110
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,328
So back here are our offices.

111
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:11,088
This is where we handle
clerical, accounting,

112
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:13,457
human resources, you name it.

113
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:14,800
Now it's a big place.

114
00:09:14,832 --> 00:09:17,328
So don't get lost on your
first day, okay?

115
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,161
You ready?

116
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:21,200
- Yeah.

117
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:22,193
- All right.

118
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:24,113
Meet me at the end of the
hall, in the break room.

119
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,472
Come on, lots to go over.

120
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:35,216
Now, before I give you the tour,

121
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:37,361
you need to watch this
quick training video.

122
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:44,369
I think you'll get a
kick out of it.

123
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,440
- Welcome
to Brooke's Hardware.

124
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:48,656
- Hi, I'm Tim.

125
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,937
- And I'm Karen.

126
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:52,561
- And it's your first
day working here at...

127
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,361
- Brooke's!

128
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,256
- That's Tim.

129
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:59,121
- And as Silvio Brooke
says on page 32.

130
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:01,392
- Watch, watch, watch.
- A Brooke's day is

131
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:02,674
a great day.

132
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,072
- When in doubt, get
your handbook out.

133
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:23,985
- I love it!

134
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:25,105
There you have it.

135
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:27,056
Think you can do this, you
think you got what it takes?

136
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:28,081
- Definitely, sir.

137
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:30,320
- I know you got what it takes.

138
00:10:30,353 --> 00:10:31,570
Anyways.

139
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,530
On with the tour.

140
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:34,512
The back stock area,

141
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:35,536
the lumber section,

142
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,257
cleaning supplies, paint
department, accessories,

143
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,472
plumbing department, more paint,

144
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,744
more cleaning, and
more plumbing.

145
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:43,697
And back where we started,
gardening.

146
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:45,232
I think you know this place.

147
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:46,768
And here's the power grid.

148
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,656
It controls all the
lighting in the store.

149
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:50,832
Don't go messing around
with this thing, okay?

150
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:52,112
It can give you some
real trouble.

151
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:55,280
All right Sammy boy, you'll
learn a lot more on the job.

152
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:58,001
So, let's head up to the
registers and get you trained...

153
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:00,688
Brian?

154
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:01,616
- Gene.

155
00:11:01,648 --> 00:11:03,376
The warehouse lights
are completely broken.

156
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:06,416
Nobody's allowed in there
until we get that fixed, okay?

157
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:08,145
- Sure thing, boss man.

158
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:09,328
Oh, Brian.

159
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:11,312
I'd like you to meet
Sam Coleman.

160
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:14,096
This is the kid who's gonna
get you through Black Friday.

161
00:11:14,128 --> 00:11:15,281
- Hello, I'm, I'm Sam.

162
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:16,112
- Yeah, hi.

163
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:18,257
I gotta get back to work.

164
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:19,760
Nobody allowed the warehouse,
got it?

165
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:20,592
- Got it.

166
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:27,664
That is our owner and
general manager.

167
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:29,232
The big cheese.

168
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:31,216
The head honcho.

169
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:34,577
Don't worry about him, he
gets into moods sometimes.

170
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:36,016
- Okay.

171
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:37,649
I'll remember that.

172
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:39,025
- Well, let's get you set up

173
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:40,816
for your first day of work,
shall we?

174
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,281
Come on.

175
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:53,009
All time off requests
must be submitted

176
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,889
a minimum of a month in advance.

177
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:57,488
Come on, chop chop.

178
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:59,441
Unless, of course, you're sick.

179
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:02,192
Brooke's doesn't tolerate
any illness in the workplace.

180
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:03,344
So.

181
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:04,465
- Aye aye, Captain.

182
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:06,161
- Oh, I almost forgot.

183
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,592
Your very own Brooke's
employee vest.

184
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:12,337
Looks good.

185
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,225
You're a Brooke's man now.

186
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:17,009
And last but not least,
your name tag.

187
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:19,248
- Oh, um...

188
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:21,712
I, um...

189
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:24,944
- Something wrong?

190
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:26,065
- No, it's perfect.

191
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:29,072
- Of course it is.

192
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:29,905
Looks good.

193
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,584
Your box cutter and
your walkie talkie

194
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:34,864
will be up with the register.

195
00:12:34,896 --> 00:12:37,520
Those are two things you don't
want to go anywhere without.

196
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:38,672
- Okay, sounds great.

197
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:39,792
I, I won't forget.

198
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:42,448
- And remember, a Brooke's
day is a great day.

199
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:43,921
- Oh Sam, this is Sarah.

200
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:45,328
She's gonna be
training you today.

201
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:47,056
Sarah, Sam.

202
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:48,016
- Hello.

203
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:49,264
- Hi, nice to meet you.

204
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:53,201
- So are you excited for
your first day?

205
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,032
- Well.

206
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:56,816
A Brooke's day is a great day,
right?

207
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:59,153
- Huh, the boy already
knows his stuff.

208
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,585
You're gonna fit in great.

209
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:03,857
I'll leave you to it,
and like you said, Sam.

210
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:06,929
- A Brooke's day is a great day?

211
00:13:06,961 --> 00:13:08,849
- You're absolutely right it is,
buddy.

212
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:12,785
- Okay.

213
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:15,792
As far as the register goes,
it's pretty self-explanatory.

214
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:17,808
You'll learn everything
through practice.

215
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,600
But here's your three
step lesson.

216
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,401
- I'm listening.

217
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:21,394
- Pay very close attention.

218
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:23,984
Scan the item.

219
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:26,289
- Okay.

220
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,824
- Take the customer's money.

221
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,137
- Okay.

222
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:30,544
- And give them their change.

223
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,496
- Okay.

224
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:33,745
- Easy peasy.

225
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:35,794
Okay, you hold down
the fort here.

226
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:36,754
I have to go work on an order,

227
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:39,184
and Brian isn't giving me
any extra time.

228
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:40,304
- Wait, wait.
- Yeah?

229
00:13:40,337 --> 00:13:42,992
- Aren't you supposed
to finish training me?

230
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:45,361
- Do you need me to go over
those three steps again?

231
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:48,209
- No, I just.

232
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:49,392
- You'll be fine.

233
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:50,864
As long as you can keep
your eyes open,

234
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,721
this job is a piece of cake.

235
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:53,648
Anybody can do it.

236
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:57,265
- Okay.

237
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,048
- Look, channel two is
a direct line to me.

238
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,705
Call me if you have any
questions, okay?

239
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:04,689
- Okay, cool.

240
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,808
I got this.

241
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,992
- You're gonna kill it, dude.

242
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:07,825
- Thanks, Sarah.

243
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:31,792
Hello, welcome
to Brooke's.

244
00:14:31,824 --> 00:14:33,520
Hey, how's it going today?

245
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:35,696
Hey, you guys need any
help finding anything?

246
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:37,009
Welcome to Brooke's.

247
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:37,841
Welcome to Brooke's.

248
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:39,057
Hey, how's it going?

249
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:39,921
Welcome to Brooke's.

250
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:41,264
Welcome to Brooke's.

251
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:55,056
Hey Sarah.

252
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:57,329
Just testing my walkie,

253
00:14:57,361 --> 00:15:00,784
but is this all I have
to do all day?

254
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,608
Are there ever customers?

255
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,408
Hey, Sam.

256
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,169
Yeah, honestly,

257
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,601
this place only stays open
'cause of Black Friday.

258
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:09,424
Other days, it's a
piece of cake.

259
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:11,184
Easiest job in the world.

260
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:14,064
Well, I'm actually headed
out for the day,

261
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:16,369
so I'll see you later.

262
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:17,872
Nice meeting you, Sam.

263
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:20,209
- It was nice to meet you too,
Sarah.

264
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:22,065
- See you, Sam.

265
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:26,384
- Piece of cake.

266
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:31,440
- Hey Sam.

267
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,104
End of the first shift already?

268
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:34,320
- Yes, sir.

269
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:37,072
- Sarah said you absolutely
killed it on the register today.

270
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,417
I'm so proud.

271
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:39,569
- Thank you.

272
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:41,425
I really, really
enjoyed it actually.

273
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,984
- Well, can I count on you to
be back here tomorrow then?

274
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:46,993
- Yeah.

275
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:48,688
Yeah, I'll see you then.

276
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,937
- Yes, you will, Sam.

277
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:50,768
Yes, you will.

278
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,041
- Goodnight, sir.

279
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:53,937
- Have a good night.

280
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:06,545
- Yeah!

281
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:47,729
- Good morning, sir.

282
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:48,849
- Good morning, Sam.

283
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,128
The registers are waiting.

284
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:55,313
- $1.25 is your change.

285
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:58,512
Have a good day.

286
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:02,065
Oh, and remember a Brooke's
day is a great day.

287
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:02,897
- Thanks man.

288
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,400
- You're welcome.

289
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:23,504
Hello.

290
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:26,865
Nice to meet you, sir.

291
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:29,041
- What is that thing?

292
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,689
- Oh, the sticker?

293
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:35,441
I don't know, it's
just a sticker.

294
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:36,369
I'm Sam by the way.

295
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:38,896
- Bill.

296
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:48,305
- So, how long
you been working here?

297
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:49,169
- Too long, dude.

298
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,536
You in school?

299
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:54,192
- Yeah, I'm in
community college.

300
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:57,585
Hoping to get in medical
school eventually.

301
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:59,152
- Dude, medical school?

302
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:01,521
Doctor Sam, huh?

303
00:18:01,553 --> 00:18:02,449
- Yeah.

304
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,920
I guess so.

305
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:04,912
- Well, Doctor Sam,

306
00:18:05,776 --> 00:18:08,081
maybe you can save me
from this job.

307
00:18:08,113 --> 00:18:08,977
It's killing me.

308
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,696
Wanna help me burn it down?

309
00:18:11,728 --> 00:18:13,201
- What?

310
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,352
- Kidding.

311
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,249
Geez Sam,

312
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,360
But come on.

313
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:19,633
What if we did, right?

314
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,736
It's boring as hell around
here, and kind of creepy too.

315
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,673
What are you doing wasting
your time here?

316
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:27,984
- I don't know.

317
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:30,832
I don't think a job like
this is such a bad choice.

318
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:32,336
I'm having such a tough
time with school,

319
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:34,449
and I'm getting the
hang of things

320
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,761
pretty quickly around here.

321
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:38,576
- Hey, I'm not complaining.

322
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:42,481
At least there's finally another
normal person around here.

323
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:44,401
- Yeah.

324
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,001
- ♪ A Brooke's
day is a great day. ♪

325
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:09,264
♪ A Brooke's day is a great day.♪

326
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:12,849
Good night, Gene.

327
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:17,393
Gene?

328
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:20,881
Sir?

329
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,561
Gene?

330
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:39,440
Gene?

331
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:54,287
- Sorry.

332
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:56,913
I was just spacing out there.

333
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:58,513
Long day.

334
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:01,649
- Okay.

335
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:02,480
No worries.

336
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,977
- Have a good night, son.

337
00:20:06,513 --> 00:20:07,441
- Good night, Gene.

338
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:47,984
- Hey Sam, just wanted to
say I'm feeling great today.

339
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:50,353
Excited to see you back
in action again.

340
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:51,920
- Thank you so much, sir.

341
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:53,329
- Good luck out there.

342
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,832
You're gonna kill it.

343
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:55,696
Put it there.

344
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,440
There you go.

345
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:05,264
Oh, head to the back stock area.

346
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:06,385
Brooke's is waiting.

347
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:15,313
- Hello?

348
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:18,097
Sarah?

349
00:21:22,544 --> 00:21:23,345
Hello?

350
00:22:30,545 --> 00:22:31,344
Sarah?

351
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:33,264
- Boo!

352
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:36,176
Gotcha.

353
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:40,465
- Yeah, okay.

354
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:42,000
You got me.

355
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:44,689
- All right, let's get to work.

356
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,521
Come on.

357
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:59,697
- Hey Sarah, what do we do
when something's out of stock?

358
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:02,577
Sarah?

359
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:11,985
Oh!

360
00:23:13,745 --> 00:23:14,640
Here we go.

361
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,937
- Aha!

362
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:26,768
Oh.

363
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:28,528
Brian.

364
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:30,577
It's you.

365
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:34,321
Nice to see you again.

366
00:23:34,352 --> 00:23:35,152
Listen,

367
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:38,513
I am so, so sorry.

368
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:40,529
Sarah had pulled this
prank on me earlier and I,

369
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,513
I was just trying to get
her back 'cause.

370
00:23:44,912 --> 00:23:46,512
It's really hard to explain.

371
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:50,545
Just, I've just been getting
used to the store and I,

372
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:54,065
I know there's no room for
messing around and, and, and,

373
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:55,568
and I know it was just a joke,

374
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,704
and it will never ever
happen again because,

375
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:01,968
a Brooke's day is a-

376
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,816
- We need you in the gardening
section the rest of the day.

377
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:08,721
- Yes sir, of course, sir.

378
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:09,552
I'm on it.

379
00:24:14,512 --> 00:24:16,113
- Hey. Hey!

380
00:24:22,384 --> 00:24:23,504
Follow me.

381
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:24,304
- Yes, sir.

382
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,520
Of course, sir.

383
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,281
Welcome to Brooke's.

384
00:24:51,313 --> 00:24:52,433
Can I help you?

385
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,280
Sir?

386
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:02,576
Hello?

387
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,312
Is there anything I can
do to help you?

388
00:25:09,457 --> 00:25:10,256
Sir?

389
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,520
Sir.

390
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,800
Can, can, can you hear me?

391
00:25:35,537 --> 00:25:36,401
Can I help?

392
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:44,625
- Hello sir, Sam has
to take his break now.

393
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:45,520
Have a wonderful Brooke's day.

394
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,544
- What the heck was that?

395
00:26:02,576 --> 00:26:05,168
- Dude, I should have told you
about that creepy customer.

396
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:07,888
I can't believe Brian put
you on gardening all alone.

397
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:10,097
- You've, you've seen
that guy before?

398
00:26:10,128 --> 00:26:12,337
- He's been hanging around
that section a lot recently.

399
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,000
Just staring at the fertilizer.

400
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:16,336
I told you, Sam, this
place gives me the creeps.

401
00:26:17,904 --> 00:26:20,753
If you ever see him again,
just don't go near him, okay?

402
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:21,713
- I won't, I won't.

403
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:25,361
- Are you sure you're all right?

404
00:26:25,392 --> 00:26:26,448
- Yeah.

405
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,496
Yeah, I'm just, just a
little shaken.

406
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,896
Just a little shaken.

407
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:16,144
Shake their hand, look
'em in the eye, help them.

408
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,136
Welcome to Brooke's.

409
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:21,137
Huh?

410
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,521
Hey, uh, Sarah,

411
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:45,904
do you know where a janitor's
closet is or something?

412
00:27:45,936 --> 00:27:49,297
There's a spill or, I
don't know what it is.

413
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,312
Something creepy.

414
00:27:51,344 --> 00:27:52,177
Yeah.

415
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:55,057
Don't bother.

416
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:55,889
Sorry.

417
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:15,857
Nevermind.

418
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:18,608
Think I found it.

419
00:29:38,384 --> 00:29:40,016
"Property of Keith"?

420
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,840
"This place is weird."

421
00:29:46,736 --> 00:29:49,680
"Gonna write entries
about what I see."

422
00:29:49,712 --> 00:29:50,512
"-Keith."

423
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,552
"Brian yelled at me again."

424
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:54,385
"I should quit."

425
00:29:57,488 --> 00:29:58,992
"I was gonna file a
report on Brian."

426
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:01,072
"He offered me a raise
to ignore it,"

427
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:02,192
"I don't know what to do."

428
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:03,856
"I can't take it anymore."

429
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:06,832
"I finally submitted a
report, no response."

430
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:08,560
"Customer repeatedly
harassing Michelle,"

431
00:30:08,592 --> 00:30:10,385
"and no help again... Brian."

432
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:13,488
"Don't trust management."

433
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,448
"They're part of it."

434
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,040
"Something horrible
in this store."

435
00:30:21,969 --> 00:30:24,048
"I have to find out what it is."

436
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:33,425
What's happening?

437
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:41,137
"Finally going to find out
what's happening in this store."

438
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:42,224
Last message.

439
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:01,297
Look at this place.

440
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,328
- Yeah, this is weird, Sam.

441
00:31:06,129 --> 00:31:07,408
- Just...

442
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:09,841
Just look at what I found.

443
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,713
- What?

444
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:15,697
What is it?

445
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:17,425
Sam?

446
00:31:17,457 --> 00:31:19,984
- Well, those are old
Brooke's handbooks

447
00:31:20,016 --> 00:31:22,097
from like the '70s or something.

448
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:23,249
I don't know, but,

449
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,664
I found this in between one.

450
00:31:28,785 --> 00:31:29,584
- Oh, shit.

451
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:34,897
- Look, dated 7-19-19.

452
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:36,080
I feel watched.

453
00:31:36,112 --> 00:31:37,904
Something horrible
in this store.

454
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:39,984
I have to find out what it is.

455
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:40,816
What?

456
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:42,640
- Holy shit.

457
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:44,816
It's Keith.

458
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:46,832
- Keith?

459
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:49,841
- He worked
here before you started.

460
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:52,464
I thought he must have quit
or got fired or something.

461
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:56,496
I never really found out
what happened.

462
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:57,649
- What do you mean?

463
00:31:57,681 --> 00:31:59,312
- I don't know.

464
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:01,553
He just didn't show up one day.

465
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:02,385
It was weird.

466
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:05,168
- Did you ask anybody
what happened?

467
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:06,385
- No.

468
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:08,016
Sam, I don't know.

469
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:10,001
People come and go here
all the time.

470
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,472
I usually just keep to myself.

471
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:15,921
- Do you remember what
day Keith left?

472
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:18,320
- I don't know.

473
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:19,665
Some time in October?

474
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:22,513
- October 3rd?

475
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:28,209
"Finally going to find out
what's happening in this store."

476
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:29,169
October 3rd.

477
00:32:30,257 --> 00:32:31,792
No more messages after that.

478
00:32:34,129 --> 00:32:37,233
So now, it makes me wonder like,

479
00:32:39,632 --> 00:32:40,432
like...

480
00:32:43,184 --> 00:32:44,368
- What happened to Keith?

481
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:06,961
So, Keith goes
to investigate something

482
00:33:06,993 --> 00:33:09,167
and then just doesn't
show up the next day?

483
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:11,889
I didn't know him that well,
but like...

484
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:17,585
- I mean, there has to
be an explanation, right?

485
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:18,704
Who do we ask?

486
00:33:18,736 --> 00:33:19,537
- Dude?

487
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:20,816
We don't ask anybody.

488
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:22,417
What if this is some
sort of conspiracy

489
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:24,624
or black market organ
operation or something?

490
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:27,568
- Well how, how do we
find out for sure?

491
00:33:29,969 --> 00:33:31,440
- I know Gene keeps
employee records

492
00:33:31,472 --> 00:33:32,913
in a cabinet in his office,

493
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:34,865
but that's,

494
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,944
that's too risky.

495
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,641
we can't do that.

496
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:40,816
- Yeah.

497
00:33:51,536 --> 00:33:52,592
- But what if we did?

498
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:00,849
- Yeah.

499
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:02,927
What if we did?

500
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:16,432
- Break time.

501
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:26,737
- Go, go, go.

502
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:28,273
You stand watch, I'll look.

503
00:34:28,305 --> 00:34:29,360
- Okay. Okay.

504
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:33,744
Which one is it?

505
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:37,136
- It's here somewhere, I
promise. No...

506
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:38,000
No...

507
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:39,280
- Hey look, it's mine!

508
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:40,657
- Dude, keep watch.

509
00:34:40,689 --> 00:34:42,065
- Right, right, sorry, sorry.

510
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:44,368
No...

511
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:45,167
No.

512
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,897
- Oh, Keith, here we go.

513
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,785
- Sarah, hurry up, I
can hear Gene, let's go.

514
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:50,737
- Sam.

515
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:52,433
- What is it? Say it quick,
come on.

516
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:55,057
It's empty.

517
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:55,856
- What?

518
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:58,833
What do you mean, it's empty?

519
00:34:58,864 --> 00:34:59,664
- It's empty.

520
00:35:04,209 --> 00:35:05,009
- Oh...

521
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:06,865
Shoot.

522
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:19,121
- He can't hear us.

523
00:35:19,153 --> 00:35:19,953
Trust me.

524
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:22,449
- All right.

525
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,281
Okay.

526
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:27,729
That's what Keith meant in
those messages.

527
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:28,880
They're hiding something.

528
00:35:28,913 --> 00:35:30,896
- Yeah, this is getting scary.

529
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,913
- There's some sort of
conspiracy here.

530
00:35:32,945 --> 00:35:34,257
Just like you said,

531
00:35:34,288 --> 00:35:35,569
Keith was on to something,

532
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,880
and then something
happened to him.

533
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:38,576
- There's definitely
something going on here.

534
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:39,569
- I feel like Gene wouldn't just

535
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:41,807
throw something away
like that by accident.

536
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,209
- No, dude, did you even
read those messages?

537
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,296
This wasn't an accident.

538
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:47,120
I'm telling you this
place is creepy.

539
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:50,769
- Yeah well, what do we do?

540
00:35:50,801 --> 00:35:51,985
What do we do?

541
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,704
- Brian keeps secret files in
the closet near his office.

542
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:05,329
He doesn't think I'm watching.

543
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:11,857
- Did he just?

544
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:15,280
- Finally, this job
gets interesting.

545
00:36:37,424 --> 00:36:38,225
- Sarah?

546
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,521
When can we go look into this?

547
00:36:41,553 --> 00:36:43,601
I need to know what's in there,
over.

548
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:46,127
- Hey doc.

549
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,537
- You don't have to say "over."

550
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:50,289
- And sorry, I'm on
register all shift.

551
00:36:52,048 --> 00:36:52,847
- Yeah.

552
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:55,664
Okay.

553
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:56,496
Right.

554
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:26,768
No you're not.

555
00:37:29,009 --> 00:37:29,840
You're not alone.

556
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:39,088
Brian keeps secret files

557
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:41,520
in the closet near his office.

558
00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:32,977
Dang it!

559
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:10,929
- What the hell do you
think you're doing?

560
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,081
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

561
00:39:12,112 --> 00:39:13,649
- Who's out in the gardening
section right now, huh?

562
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,769
- What?

563
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,649
You're telling me that you
left your section unattended

564
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,801
in the middle of your shift?

565
00:39:18,832 --> 00:39:19,728
- I, I, I was-

566
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:20,944
Managers only.

567
00:39:20,977 --> 00:39:21,968
Do you remember what I told you?

568
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:23,184
Do you understand English?

569
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:24,561
- Yes sir, of course.

570
00:39:24,592 --> 00:39:26,352
- I thought you wanted to
keep this job kid, huh?

571
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:27,376
I guess you wanna lose it now?

572
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:28,561
- No, no, not at all.

573
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:29,936
- Then get your head out
of the clouds.

574
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,953
Stop snooping around
back here like a creep.

575
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,729
And get the fuck back to work.

576
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:37,649
Okay?

577
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:01,616
- Sam?

578
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:03,569
There you are.

579
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:05,745
- Hey.

580
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:08,785
- What's wrong, dude?

581
00:40:11,057 --> 00:40:12,752
- Sarah, I'm so sorry.

582
00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:16,305
I went and checked it out,
the closet,

583
00:40:17,904 --> 00:40:19,056
but Brian caught me and,

584
00:40:21,617 --> 00:40:22,417
it was bad.

585
00:40:23,696 --> 00:40:26,128
- Man, why did you
go without me?

586
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,464
- I, I don't know.

587
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:31,570
I'm just not good at anything.

588
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,353
I'm just... not good
at anything.

589
00:40:34,385 --> 00:40:35,440
- Hey.
- What the hell

590
00:40:35,472 --> 00:40:36,977
am I supposed to do, Sarah?

591
00:40:37,008 --> 00:40:37,937
What am I supposed to do?
- Sam.

592
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,697
- What the hell am I
supposed to do?

593
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,688
- Look at me.

594
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:42,000
- Hey, look at me.

595
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:44,913
What do you think you should do?

596
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:49,232
- Oh.

597
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,184
Yeah,

598
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:55,248
I think I should talk to Gene
and try to figure things out.

599
00:40:56,816 --> 00:40:59,601
- See, I think that's perfect.

600
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:03,728
Look, anything outside
of the store,

601
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,648
that's what should really
matter to you.

602
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:06,481
Okay?

603
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:09,713
- Yeah.

604
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:10,544
You're right.

605
00:41:11,408 --> 00:41:13,520
- Look doc, I gotta
get home now,

606
00:41:13,553 --> 00:41:15,952
but let me know how it
goes with Gene.

607
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:16,785
Okay?

608
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,610
- Yeah.

609
00:41:22,928 --> 00:41:26,481
- Hey, it's gonna be okay.

610
00:41:26,512 --> 00:41:29,040
Don't let this job become
your life, man.

611
00:41:29,073 --> 00:41:29,873
Okay?

612
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:32,176
- Yeah.

613
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:33,010
Thanks, Sarah.

614
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:35,568
- Goodnight, Doctor Sam.

615
00:41:43,696 --> 00:41:45,168
- Gene?

616
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,992
- Sam, to what do I owe
the pleasure?

617
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:50,290
- Can I talk to you
about something?

618
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,272
- Yes, of course, anything,
come in.

619
00:41:52,305 --> 00:41:53,105
Sit down.

620
00:42:01,008 --> 00:42:03,504
This is about what happened
between you and Brian, right?

621
00:42:04,594 --> 00:42:05,424
- Yeah.

622
00:42:07,217 --> 00:42:08,465
- I heard everything, Sam.

623
00:42:08,497 --> 00:42:10,672
I am so, so sorry.

624
00:42:10,705 --> 00:42:12,592
Nobody deserves to get
yelled at like that,

625
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:13,777
that's uncalled for.

626
00:42:13,808 --> 00:42:15,408
- I know.

627
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,074
I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

628
00:42:19,345 --> 00:42:20,945
I guess what I'm
trying to say is

629
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:25,936
I'm not so sure I'm cut
out to work here anymore.

630
00:42:30,192 --> 00:42:31,280
- Just, just a second.

631
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:44,112
Sam,

632
00:42:45,905 --> 00:42:47,890
allow me to let you in on
a little secret.

633
00:42:49,777 --> 00:42:53,232
This store, it's teetering
on the edge of bankruptcy.

634
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:56,688
Yeah, we were hit hard
with the rise

635
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,128
of those big online players,

636
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,536
but you know the one thing

637
00:42:59,568 --> 00:43:01,552
that our competitors don't have,
Sam?

638
00:43:01,585 --> 00:43:04,496
It's the people, the
customer service.

639
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:06,448
Now with Black Friday
just around the corner,

640
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:08,464
we're gonna need the best
possible people on our team,

641
00:43:08,497 --> 00:43:09,521
the best.

642
00:43:09,552 --> 00:43:12,241
And you have really
shown promise.

643
00:43:13,905 --> 00:43:14,705
- Thank you, sir.

644
00:43:14,737 --> 00:43:15,825
- Yeah.

645
00:43:15,856 --> 00:43:19,474
Sam, have you ever considered
working here full-time?

646
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,904
- Oh, I-

647
00:43:21,936 --> 00:43:24,496
- I really think that
for your future,

648
00:43:24,528 --> 00:43:27,408
a full-time path, now
that's a smart option.

649
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,425
You know, this here is
a solid career.

650
00:43:30,448 --> 00:43:32,977
You would be on the path
to management.

651
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,321
Let's be honest.

652
00:43:34,352 --> 00:43:36,721
If we want this store to
succeed and grow,

653
00:43:36,754 --> 00:43:38,609
we are gonna need people
like Sam Coleman

654
00:43:38,641 --> 00:43:39,634
in the Brooke's family.

655
00:43:39,665 --> 00:43:40,690
Huh?

656
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,600
For the culture, the
commitment, and for the cause.

657
00:43:43,632 --> 00:43:44,434
Right?!

658
00:43:44,465 --> 00:43:45,457
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

659
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,450
Yeah!
- Yeah!

660
00:43:48,177 --> 00:43:49,776
- Well, there's no rush
on your answer,

661
00:43:49,808 --> 00:43:53,232
but if you want the position,
it's yours.

662
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,945
You, my friend, would
be great at it.

663
00:43:58,032 --> 00:43:59,984
Just let me know by
Black Friday.

664
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:01,520
Sam, we will make sure

665
00:44:01,553 --> 00:44:03,824
that Brian learns to
respect you, man.

666
00:44:03,856 --> 00:44:05,232
- Wow, thank you.

667
00:44:05,264 --> 00:44:06,800
Thank you so much, Gene,
seriously.

668
00:44:06,832 --> 00:44:07,792
Thank you so much.

669
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:09,841
I promise I'll have an
answer for you very soon.

670
00:44:09,872 --> 00:44:11,377
- I know you will, Sam, I know.

671
00:44:12,241 --> 00:44:13,424
- Thanks, Gene.

672
00:44:43,825 --> 00:44:45,937
- Are you writing an
order for this section?

673
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,401
- Yeah, I am.

674
00:44:50,384 --> 00:44:51,729
- Okay.

675
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,720
Sam, dude.

676
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:54,992
How did it go with Gene?

677
00:44:55,024 --> 00:44:55,825
- Oh.

678
00:44:57,584 --> 00:44:58,385
Actually,

679
00:44:59,665 --> 00:45:00,625
actually Sarah,

680
00:45:01,552 --> 00:45:05,681
I think I'm probably gonna
start working here full-time.

681
00:45:07,312 --> 00:45:08,849
- Wait, what?

682
00:45:09,681 --> 00:45:12,112
Sam, you're in school.

683
00:45:12,145 --> 00:45:14,513
You're gonna save lives,
remember?

684
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,665
Doctor Sam?

685
00:45:15,697 --> 00:45:17,744
- No, no, it'll be fine.

686
00:45:17,776 --> 00:45:19,505
I'm pretty sure I'll be able
to work around my schedule.

687
00:45:19,537 --> 00:45:20,305
It's gonna be-

688
00:45:20,337 --> 00:45:21,425
- Wait, no.

689
00:45:21,457 --> 00:45:22,385
Sam?

690
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:24,944
Did you listen to
anything I said to you?

691
00:45:24,977 --> 00:45:26,512
Come on Sam, are you crazy?

692
00:45:26,545 --> 00:45:27,761
Do you really wanna
get stuck here

693
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:29,074
working full-time?

694
00:45:29,105 --> 00:45:30,385
You deserve better.

695
00:45:30,416 --> 00:45:32,624
Don't get sucked into
this full-time bullshit.

696
00:45:33,745 --> 00:45:37,488
- Look, I just gotta start
fighting for myself, okay?

697
00:45:37,521 --> 00:45:39,184
I know I can do this.

698
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:41,554
Gene even said I'm on
track to be management.

699
00:45:43,056 --> 00:45:44,273
- Oh my god.

700
00:45:44,305 --> 00:45:45,201
Are you serious?

701
00:45:45,233 --> 00:45:46,032
- What?

702
00:45:47,153 --> 00:45:49,105
Don't you work here full-time?

703
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:50,194
Why is it so bad?

704
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:52,240
- I work here full-time
because I have to.

705
00:45:52,272 --> 00:45:53,074
- Well, Sarah.

706
00:45:54,034 --> 00:45:55,472
Maybe I won't end up like you.

707
00:45:58,576 --> 00:45:59,857
- All right, dude.

708
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:02,032
Whatever, enjoy the nightmare.

709
00:46:22,352 --> 00:46:23,472
- Look, Sarah.

710
00:46:23,504 --> 00:46:24,912
I'm really sorry for earlier,

711
00:46:25,968 --> 00:46:27,792
but I know this is a
great opportunity

712
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,161
and I just hope we can be cool.

713
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:32,048
Are we?

714
00:46:33,425 --> 00:46:34,225
Are we cool?

715
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:37,616
- Don't take this promotion,
Sam.

716
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:40,592
- Are you serious?

717
00:46:40,624 --> 00:46:43,057
- I'm just looking out
for you here.

718
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:44,753
- I'm apologizing to you.

719
00:46:44,785 --> 00:46:45,585
I just told you this is a,

720
00:46:45,617 --> 00:46:47,569
this is a great
opportunity for me.

721
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:50,256
- Sam, do you really
wanna work in this place,

722
00:46:50,288 --> 00:46:52,752
where employees and their
files just go missing?

723
00:46:53,617 --> 00:46:55,121
- Yeah, I do.

724
00:46:55,152 --> 00:46:56,369
- No you don't, Sam.

725
00:46:56,401 --> 00:46:59,025
You have a Brooke's sticker
on your personality square.

726
00:46:59,057 --> 00:47:00,752
You don't know what you want.

727
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:01,841
- Do you, Sarah?

728
00:47:01,872 --> 00:47:04,881
- Sam, I told you, I told you,
and before-

729
00:47:04,913 --> 00:47:07,025
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, shh.

730
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:09,488
Let's let's take it down
a few notches, Sarah, huh?

731
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:12,240
- This is pathetic.

732
00:47:12,272 --> 00:47:13,072
I'm going home.

733
00:47:14,896 --> 00:47:16,561
- Everything alright man?

734
00:47:16,593 --> 00:47:18,672
- Yeah, everything's okay, Gene.

735
00:47:18,704 --> 00:47:21,169
But I wanted to let you know.

736
00:47:21,201 --> 00:47:22,001
- Yeah?

737
00:47:24,273 --> 00:47:26,929
That I gladly accept your
offer to work here full-time.

738
00:47:26,961 --> 00:47:29,232
- Yes, oh my goodness
this is wonderful.

739
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:30,673
Absolutely wonderful.

740
00:47:30,705 --> 00:47:32,817
That's the right choice Sam.

741
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,224
I am so happy.

742
00:47:34,256 --> 00:47:37,521
We are so happy to have you
in our full-time family, huh?

743
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:38,992
- Yes, great, wonderful.

744
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:40,240
So happy for you.

745
00:47:40,273 --> 00:47:42,704
At least if you don't
end up miserable like me,

746
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:45,040
you'll end up a missing
person, like Keith.

747
00:47:48,752 --> 00:47:50,448
- What do you mean a
missing person?

748
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,249
- Nothing, nothing.

749
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,145
She means nothing by that.

750
00:47:52,177 --> 00:47:54,033
- No, I don't mean nothing.

751
00:47:54,065 --> 00:47:55,344
Keith was on to you guys, Gene.

752
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:57,040
He knew something bad was
happening here,

753
00:47:57,072 --> 00:47:58,160
and you got rid of him.

754
00:48:08,529 --> 00:48:10,928
- This is a huge
misunderstanding.

755
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,280
Follow me.

756
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:20,657
Come in. Sam,
shut the door.

757
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,793
I'm telling you, this is
a huge misunderstanding.

758
00:48:23,825 --> 00:48:24,689
I'm sorry.

759
00:48:24,721 --> 00:48:26,000
Look here.

760
00:48:26,032 --> 00:48:27,537
Let's see.

761
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:28,497
Yep, there it is.

762
00:48:29,521 --> 00:48:30,736
His file is right here.

763
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:32,944
- What the hell?

764
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,496
- I'm gonna be honest
with you guys.

765
00:48:36,528 --> 00:48:39,025
Keith had a nasty accident
during a shift.

766
00:48:39,056 --> 00:48:42,065
He fell off a ladder and he
got roughed up pretty good.

767
00:48:42,865 --> 00:48:43,793
You wanna read it?

768
00:48:43,825 --> 00:48:44,689
Everything's here.

769
00:48:46,705 --> 00:48:48,593
- What the hell, but?

770
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:52,912
No, his journal and
the messages.

771
00:48:52,944 --> 00:48:56,177
- No, we took care of it and
he's fine now, I promise.

772
00:48:56,209 --> 00:48:57,137
- No, no, no.

773
00:48:57,169 --> 00:48:58,704
What about if you let us
contact Keith-

774
00:48:58,736 --> 00:49:01,456
- You know I can't give out
information like that, Sarah,

775
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,664
but everything's here.

776
00:49:03,697 --> 00:49:05,905
- No, none of this
was here before.

777
00:49:06,865 --> 00:49:07,953
- What do you mean?

778
00:49:07,985 --> 00:49:08,945
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

779
00:49:08,977 --> 00:49:10,192
- What do you mean Sarah?

780
00:49:12,753 --> 00:49:14,096
- Sam and I snuck into
your office Gene,

781
00:49:14,128 --> 00:49:17,104
and there was no file
here on Keith.

782
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:18,577
- Don't drag Sam into this.

783
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:20,209
- What?

784
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:23,857
But Sam, you found the
room, and his messages.

785
00:49:23,889 --> 00:49:25,680
We both wanted to find out
what happened to Keith.

786
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,697
And there was no file here.

787
00:49:27,729 --> 00:49:30,544
- Sweetheart, documents
take time to process.

788
00:49:30,577 --> 00:49:32,849
Look, this is all a
misunderstanding, I promise.

789
00:49:32,881 --> 00:49:34,417
- Sam, back me up here.

790
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:39,665
- I, I, I, I don't know.

791
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:42,640
- This is pathetic.

792
00:49:42,672 --> 00:49:43,505
- I'm sorry, Sarah,

793
00:49:43,537 --> 00:49:45,808
but sneaking into my
office like that.

794
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,536
That's against the handbook.

795
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,712
I'm gonna have to submit
a report to Brian.

796
00:49:49,744 --> 00:49:50,640
Any objection, Sam?

797
00:49:56,272 --> 00:49:57,457
- No.

798
00:49:57,489 --> 00:49:58,769
- Go ahead.

799
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:00,689
Write your fucking report.

800
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:01,521
I'm going home.

801
00:50:05,744 --> 00:50:06,545
Good night, Sam.

802
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,096
- I'm sorry you had a deal
with that, Sam.

803
00:50:14,129 --> 00:50:16,400
Mind taking this report
over to Brian?

804
00:50:16,432 --> 00:50:17,681
Then you can head home.

805
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:19,889
- I will.

806
00:50:21,296 --> 00:50:23,377
- Glad to have you in our
full-time family, Sam.

807
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,449
Have a good night.

808
00:50:47,729 --> 00:50:49,681
- Don't come back!

809
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:03,729
- Sarah, I-

810
00:51:06,993 --> 00:51:07,793
Bill?

811
00:51:09,393 --> 00:51:11,056
Are you working register today?

812
00:51:12,785 --> 00:51:13,585
- What?

813
00:51:15,184 --> 00:51:15,984
- Where's Sarah?

814
00:51:18,385 --> 00:51:19,345
- She ain't nowhere.

815
00:51:20,624 --> 00:51:21,712
- What?

816
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:23,089
What do you mean?

817
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,145
- She got fired, kid.

818
00:51:26,576 --> 00:51:27,280
She got fired, okay?

819
00:51:28,271 --> 00:51:30,641
I heard Brian yelling
at her over the phone.

820
00:51:30,673 --> 00:51:31,537
- What?

821
00:51:31,569 --> 00:51:32,368
Are you serious?

822
00:51:34,064 --> 00:51:35,184
What'd he say?

823
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,625
- I don't know. I
couldn't hear exactly.

824
00:51:36,656 --> 00:51:38,609
Something like, "don't
ever come back!"

825
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,489
You know, firing words.

826
00:51:43,824 --> 00:51:46,640
- So she's, she's not here.

827
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,713
- She ain't here.

828
00:51:58,353 --> 00:51:59,152
Brian!

829
00:52:03,249 --> 00:52:04,561
- I'll be right back, Bill.

830
00:52:16,336 --> 00:52:17,681
- Yes?

831
00:52:17,713 --> 00:52:18,513
What is it?

832
00:52:22,769 --> 00:52:24,593
- Do you think we can talk?

833
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,320
- Come in.

834
00:52:38,673 --> 00:52:39,472
What do you need?

835
00:52:40,753 --> 00:52:41,553
- Yeah, so.

836
00:52:46,031 --> 00:52:47,120
- What do you need, Sam?

837
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:50,927
- Yeah, so I know you're
really busy and everything.

838
00:52:53,233 --> 00:52:56,656
Anyways, I, I really
wanted to ask you about...

839
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,929
About Sarah.

840
00:53:01,648 --> 00:53:02,864
- She broke the rules,

841
00:53:03,697 --> 00:53:05,360
which are in place for a reason.

842
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:08,111
- That isn't fair, Brian.

843
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:09,167
She has, she has to-

844
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:10,769
- Not fair?

845
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,497
What the hell does that mean,
not fair?

846
00:53:12,529 --> 00:53:13,713
A day working into full-time,

847
00:53:13,745 --> 00:53:15,985
and you're trying to
tell me how to do my job?

848
00:53:17,137 --> 00:53:18,033
- I'm sorry.

849
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:19,024
- Oh, you're sorry?

850
00:53:19,057 --> 00:53:20,273
I give you a place in my store

851
00:53:20,305 --> 00:53:22,833
and you confront me in
my own fucking office.

852
00:53:22,864 --> 00:53:25,841
- I, I'm not confronting
you, I'm just, I'm just,

853
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:26,833
I'm just trying-

854
00:53:26,864 --> 00:53:29,425
- I'm just, I'm just, I'm
just, I'm just, shut up!

855
00:53:37,649 --> 00:53:41,489
Listen, we need you here
on Black Friday.

856
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,801
All right? I'm gonna be
bringing in some temps

857
00:53:42,832 --> 00:53:43,792
to help out for the day,

858
00:53:43,825 --> 00:53:45,681
but we need full-timers
who know what's going on

859
00:53:45,712 --> 00:53:47,632
if we're gonna pull through.

860
00:53:47,665 --> 00:53:49,136
And if you can't
understand the basic rules,

861
00:53:49,169 --> 00:53:53,009
that's going to be a
problem, for everybody.

862
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,513
- No, it won't be a problem.

863
00:53:55,601 --> 00:53:56,401
- Good.

864
00:53:57,457 --> 00:53:59,633
You're back on gardening
the rest of the day.

865
00:54:01,361 --> 00:54:02,736
- I'm on it, sir.

866
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:12,881
- Go!

867
00:55:04,465 --> 00:55:05,231
- Sarah?

868
00:55:09,617 --> 00:55:11,185
I know you're not even
here right now,

869
00:55:16,848 --> 00:55:18,576
but I'm gonna figure
this thing out,

870
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:22,641
once and for all.

871
00:55:25,712 --> 00:55:26,577
Over and out.

872
00:55:46,768 --> 00:55:47,568
Hey Bill?

873
00:55:48,688 --> 00:55:49,777
- What?

874
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:52,497
- If you distract Brian and
get him out of his office,

875
00:55:52,528 --> 00:55:53,457
no questions asked.

876
00:55:54,704 --> 00:55:55,889
I'll give you five bucks.

877
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:58,161
- Ten.

878
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,344
- Seven.

879
00:55:59,377 --> 00:56:00,177
- Six.

880
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,865
- Okay.

881
00:56:02,896 --> 00:56:04,273
- You got a deal.

882
00:56:04,304 --> 00:56:05,104
Come on.

883
00:56:15,697 --> 00:56:17,936
Brian, Brian, Brian, get
out, get out here now!

884
00:56:17,969 --> 00:56:18,960
- What, what?

885
00:56:18,993 --> 00:56:20,145
- There's a thief, there's
a thief in the store!

886
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:20,945
- Where?

887
00:56:20,976 --> 00:56:21,744
- Front of the store.

888
00:56:21,776 --> 00:56:23,025
- Come on, follow me!
- Go!

889
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:42,577
- Come on!

890
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:00,817
Brian keeps secret files

891
00:57:00,848 --> 00:57:02,641
in a closet near his office

892
00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:31,920
- Jeez.

893
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,640
- Okay.

894
00:58:07,665 --> 00:58:08,560
Okay, okay.

895
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:11,984
"Employee incident."

896
00:58:14,096 --> 00:58:15,505
"Harassed by customer,"

897
00:58:15,536 --> 00:58:18,130
"threatened a lawsuit,
fired immediately."

898
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:25,488
No, no, no, no, "False
report filed."

899
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,600
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

900
00:58:27,634 --> 00:58:29,232
Brian covered it up.

901
00:58:34,256 --> 00:58:35,857
Accident covered up.

902
00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:38,704
Bernard.

903
00:58:38,737 --> 00:58:41,968
"Box baler crushed arm,
false report filed."

904
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:43,408
Brian...

905
00:58:43,441 --> 00:58:44,624
No no no no no.

906
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:50,576
Oh my God.

907
00:58:52,657 --> 00:58:53,456
No.

908
00:59:05,936 --> 00:59:06,737
Keith.

909
00:59:12,432 --> 00:59:13,232
No!

910
00:59:16,816 --> 00:59:18,032
No, no, no, no, no.

911
00:59:24,656 --> 00:59:25,456
Brian...

912
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:57,970
- I'm so sorry, Brian.

913
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,960
You know, I've got bad eyes.

914
00:59:58,992 --> 01:00:00,497
I had no idea it was Gene.

915
01:00:00,528 --> 01:00:02,992
I'll wear my glasses next time.

916
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,520
- October 3rd.

917
01:00:41,074 --> 01:00:42,129
- October 3rd...

918
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,400
What the hell?

919
01:00:48,593 --> 01:00:50,641
What the hell is going on?

920
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:08,657
You have to fight them.

921
01:01:20,401 --> 01:01:22,193
You have to fight them!

922
01:01:22,225 --> 01:01:23,024
- I will.

923
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,984
- Hey,
it's Sarah.

924
01:01:36,016 --> 01:01:37,168
Sorry I missed your call.

925
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,216
Leave a message, or whatever.

926
01:01:39,248 --> 01:01:40,016
Bye.

927
01:01:41,232 --> 01:01:42,672
- Hey Sarah,

928
01:01:42,704 --> 01:01:44,785
wanted to try you again.

929
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:46,672
I,

930
01:01:47,665 --> 01:01:49,969
I just found out some
stuff about Brooke's,

931
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:53,712
and I wanted to let you know I,
I,

932
01:01:55,025 --> 01:01:56,272
I just wanted to tell you,

933
01:01:57,265 --> 01:02:00,464
that Brian covered up so
much corruption.

934
01:02:00,496 --> 01:02:03,760
So many people were hurt
and nobody knows about it,

935
01:02:03,792 --> 01:02:06,896
but I'm never gonna let this
happen to anyone ever again.

936
01:02:07,984 --> 01:02:08,848
And you know what?

937
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,688
I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to take Brooke's down.

938
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,320
So yeah.

939
01:02:19,312 --> 01:02:20,817
I have a plan for Black Friday,

940
01:02:21,777 --> 01:02:23,216
and Brooke's won't survive it.

941
01:02:28,497 --> 01:02:29,361
Gene?

942
01:02:29,393 --> 01:02:30,704
- Mm-hmm.

943
01:02:30,736 --> 01:02:32,337
- Have you noticed Brian today?

944
01:02:32,369 --> 01:02:33,520
Just listen.

945
01:02:36,624 --> 01:02:38,801
And, and the employee
handbook says,

946
01:02:38,832 --> 01:02:40,113
you can't work if you're sick.

947
01:02:40,145 --> 01:02:41,137
I know you know that.

948
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,488
- I'll go and talk to him.

949
01:02:46,705 --> 01:02:47,920
- Yes, what is it?

950
01:02:47,952 --> 01:02:49,872
- I've noticed that
you've been pretty sick
recently.

951
01:02:49,904 --> 01:02:51,537
You can't come in for Black
Friday when you're sick.

952
01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:52,369
It's against the rules.

953
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,649
- I don't care if I'm
on death's door,

954
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,800
I will be here on Black Friday.

955
01:02:54,832 --> 01:02:56,912
- Hey!
- Don't get involved, kid!

956
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:58,129
- No, no, listen to me!

957
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:03,600
If you're really sick,

958
01:03:03,632 --> 01:03:05,264
it's gonna be hard for
you to run the store

959
01:03:05,296 --> 01:03:06,320
and manage everybody.

960
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,200
What if,

961
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,809
what if I take on the
responsibilities of team leader?

962
01:03:15,345 --> 01:03:16,176
Just for the day.

963
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,569
- I think that's a
great compromise.

964
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,320
- Can you do it?

965
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:30,897
- I will.

966
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:36,112
- Okay.

967
01:03:37,617 --> 01:03:39,760
- I'll see you on Friday, early.

968
01:03:39,792 --> 01:03:40,593
- Of course.

969
01:03:47,856 --> 01:03:48,656
- Sam,

970
01:03:51,664 --> 01:03:53,041
I'm proud of you.

971
01:03:54,737 --> 01:03:56,080
I'm proud of you.

972
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,112
- Black Friday,
here we come.

973
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,704
- Good morning,
everyone.

974
01:04:06,736 --> 01:04:08,465
Thank you for coming
in early today.

975
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,672
As you know,

976
01:04:10,704 --> 01:04:12,848
today is the most important
day of the year for Brooke's.

977
01:04:14,257 --> 01:04:16,113
This day can make or break us.

978
01:04:17,137 --> 01:04:18,993
So let's make it make us, okay?

979
01:04:22,513 --> 01:04:23,793
I'll be frank.

980
01:04:23,825 --> 01:04:27,729
We need to make $15,000 today
in order to pull through.

981
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,912
It'll be close,

982
01:04:28,944 --> 01:04:31,600
but I'm very confident that
we can make it with hard work.

983
01:04:31,632 --> 01:04:33,648
So, thank you again to our temps

984
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,760
for coming in to help us today.

985
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:37,136
We have a fantastic a team,

986
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:40,177
and I know that we will succeed.

987
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,520
We have to succeed.

988
01:04:43,825 --> 01:04:45,296
We have to.

989
01:04:45,328 --> 01:04:48,336
- All right team, Brian's a
bit under the weather today.

990
01:04:48,369 --> 01:04:52,561
So I've chosen Sam Coleman
as team leader,

991
01:04:52,593 --> 01:04:54,097
and I couldn't be more proud.

992
01:04:54,129 --> 01:04:57,296
If he tells you to do
something, you do it.

993
01:04:57,329 --> 01:04:58,864
No questions asked, huh?

994
01:04:59,824 --> 01:05:01,233
You got this, Sam, come on.

995
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,081
- Here we go.

996
01:05:04,113 --> 01:05:06,352
Bill, Mandy, you two will
be on the floor

997
01:05:06,384 --> 01:05:07,953
restocking as necessary.

998
01:05:07,985 --> 01:05:09,937
Gene will be on the floor
keeping customers happy.

999
01:05:09,969 --> 01:05:11,825
Ben, you'll be restocking too.

1000
01:05:11,857 --> 01:05:14,321
Vincent, you'll start
out on register.

1001
01:05:14,353 --> 01:05:15,792
Brian will be in the back,
supervising,

1002
01:05:15,824 --> 01:05:17,489
keeping everything on track.

1003
01:05:17,521 --> 01:05:20,369
And I am team leader,

1004
01:05:20,401 --> 01:05:22,961
rotating between
stations as necessary.

1005
01:05:22,993 --> 01:05:24,752
- Any questions?

1006
01:05:24,784 --> 01:05:25,937
That's what I like to hear.

1007
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:27,536
Everybody, hands in the middle.

1008
01:05:27,568 --> 01:05:29,584
Brooke's on three, one, two,
three.

1009
01:05:29,617 --> 01:05:31,120
Brooke's!

1010
01:06:15,568 --> 01:06:16,400
- Brain, how's it going?

1011
01:06:16,432 --> 01:06:17,617
Are we close to our quota?

1012
01:06:17,649 --> 01:06:19,825
- Yeah we're almost there,
but we have to keep hustling.

1013
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:21,393
Stay focused.

1014
01:06:21,424 --> 01:06:22,224
We close in an hour.

1015
01:06:22,256 --> 01:06:24,529
This is the time that
counts the most.

1016
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,777
We have to pull through.

1017
01:06:26,705 --> 01:06:29,297
Now, get back in there, go.

1018
01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:30,161
- I'm on it, sir.

1019
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,160
Here we go.

1020
01:06:42,513 --> 01:06:43,825
- Hey Vincent.

1021
01:06:43,856 --> 01:06:44,625
- Yeah?

1022
01:06:44,657 --> 01:06:45,521
- I think you got this.

1023
01:06:45,553 --> 01:06:48,208
So I'm gonna go help
out in the back.

1024
01:06:48,241 --> 01:06:49,585
- What, are you sure?

1025
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,689
Okay, okay, I got this.

1026
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,553
- You got this.

1027
01:07:06,352 --> 01:07:07,247
- What?

1028
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,849
- Bill, you're doing
a great job.

1029
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:10,545
- Thank you.

1030
01:07:10,577 --> 01:07:11,633
- In fact, Bill, actually,

1031
01:07:11,665 --> 01:07:12,944
you're doing such a good job,

1032
01:07:12,976 --> 01:07:14,000
Um.

1033
01:07:14,032 --> 01:07:17,872
Brian told me to let you
know that if you wanted to,

1034
01:07:17,904 --> 01:07:19,600
you can take off and
go home early.

1035
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:25,969
- I was wrong about you kid.

1036
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,664
I know what you're doing.

1037
01:07:27,697 --> 01:07:28,753
Good luck.

1038
01:07:29,584 --> 01:07:30,448
See you later!

1039
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:36,689
- Hey, so I can take
over for you now, Mandy.

1040
01:07:36,721 --> 01:07:38,000
Why don't you head home?

1041
01:07:39,313 --> 01:07:41,360
- Don't you guys need help here?
Like?

1042
01:07:41,393 --> 01:07:43,409
- We have a very capable crew,

1043
01:07:43,441 --> 01:07:44,913
and you'll be compensated
for your whole shift,

1044
01:07:44,944 --> 01:07:46,864
so uh, don't even
worry about it.

1045
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:49,329
- Oh, okay.

1046
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,161
Bye.

1047
01:07:50,993 --> 01:07:52,561
- Hey Bill, wait for me.

1048
01:07:56,304 --> 01:07:57,104
- What?

1049
01:07:57,136 --> 01:07:57,936
- Uh yeah, they're gone.

1050
01:07:57,969 --> 01:07:58,929
I, I don't know what to do.

1051
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,944
- Are you joking around,
are you joking with me?

1052
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:02,161
- Hello?

1053
01:08:02,193 --> 01:08:03,696
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1054
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:05,553
Excuse me, I have to run.

1055
01:08:09,425 --> 01:08:11,249
- I'm gonna be
all alone here?

1056
01:08:11,281 --> 01:08:13,681
- No, actually you
can head home.

1057
01:08:13,713 --> 01:08:15,729
You're gonna get compensated
for the whole day.

1058
01:08:15,761 --> 01:08:16,528
- Oh, okay.

1059
01:08:16,561 --> 01:08:17,360
Cool, cool.

1060
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:33,137
- Hey Vincent, go ahead
and take off for the day.

1061
01:08:33,169 --> 01:08:34,480
You've earned it.

1062
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:35,953
We're gonna compensate you
for your whole shift anyway,

1063
01:08:35,984 --> 01:08:38,161
so don't worry about it.

1064
01:08:38,193 --> 01:08:39,216
- Okay, okay.

1065
01:08:42,033 --> 01:08:45,136
- Sam, what in Brooke's
name is happening?

1066
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:46,577
- I don't know, the temps
all left on me.

1067
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:47,633
- What?

1068
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:48,560
- Everybody's gone.

1069
01:08:49,489 --> 01:08:50,705
What do I do?

1070
01:08:50,736 --> 01:08:51,505
- Uh uh uh, let me do it.

1071
01:08:51,536 --> 01:08:52,337
Let me do it. Let me do it.

1072
01:08:53,649 --> 01:08:54,767
Over here everybody, over here.

1073
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,664
I can help you.

1074
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,296
- What's the hold up?

1075
01:09:01,329 --> 01:09:02,993
- Gene, are you all right?

1076
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:04,176
- We can't do this.

1077
01:09:04,209 --> 01:09:05,231
- What?

1078
01:09:05,264 --> 01:09:08,080
- There's too many people,
what the hell do we do?

1079
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:09,328
- I think I have an idea.

1080
01:09:09,361 --> 01:09:11,281
- Well, quit standing
there and do it.

1081
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,760
- Excuse me, ladies
and gentlemen.

1082
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:17,360
Ladies and gentlemen,
please listen up.

1083
01:09:17,393 --> 01:09:21,489
I'd like to announce that,
um, all further purchases

1084
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,768
will be full price.

1085
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,073
- That's not true!

1086
01:09:25,105 --> 01:09:27,153
- Discounted! It's all
still discounted!

1087
01:09:27,185 --> 01:09:28,080
Please!

1088
01:09:28,113 --> 01:09:29,840
- I'm sorry! I don't
make the rules!

1089
01:09:29,873 --> 01:09:31,504
- No, no, no, no, no!

1090
01:09:31,537 --> 01:09:32,593
That's not true!

1091
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,529
- Don't listen to him!

1092
01:10:14,704 --> 01:10:15,505
- What the hell?

1093
01:10:22,448 --> 01:10:24,273
- Oh my God.

1094
01:10:28,304 --> 01:10:30,064
- I'm gonna take my break now.

1095
01:10:44,593 --> 01:10:47,248
Ladies and gentlemen,

1096
01:10:47,281 --> 01:10:49,905
Brooke's will be
closing promptly.

1097
01:10:50,769 --> 01:10:53,711
No more purchases will
be made today.

1098
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,233
Please head towards your
nearest exist.

1099
01:10:57,264 --> 01:11:01,521
And remember, a Brooke's
day is a great day.

1100
01:11:42,897 --> 01:11:45,073
- I did it, Keith.

1101
01:11:45,104 --> 01:11:46,320
One thing left.

1102
01:12:08,144 --> 01:12:09,745
Yes, what is it?

1103
01:12:09,777 --> 01:12:12,336
- Hey Brian, can we
talk real quick?

1104
01:12:24,624 --> 01:12:25,424
Uh, um,

1105
01:12:28,816 --> 01:12:29,905
How's, um...

1106
01:12:31,024 --> 01:12:32,113
how's everything going?

1107
01:12:33,712 --> 01:12:34,672
- Fine.

1108
01:12:34,705 --> 01:12:35,505
Why do you ask?

1109
01:12:36,465 --> 01:12:40,016
- No reason just, just
wanted to say,

1110
01:12:41,808 --> 01:12:43,248
just wanted to say something.

1111
01:12:45,488 --> 01:12:46,288
- Okay?

1112
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:49,553
- Um.

1113
01:12:49,584 --> 01:12:50,321
- Keith, what?

1114
01:12:50,353 --> 01:12:51,152
I don't have all day.

1115
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:57,168
- You can't keep doing this.

1116
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,224
- What?

1117
01:12:58,256 --> 01:13:00,432
What are you talking about?

1118
01:13:06,225 --> 01:13:08,977
No, no, no, Keith. No!

1119
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:09,776
What the hell are you doing?

1120
01:13:09,809 --> 01:13:10,513
- I'm sorry, Brian.

1121
01:13:10,544 --> 01:13:11,441
- Let me outta here.

1122
01:13:11,473 --> 01:13:12,753
- I know you're doing
something terrible.

1123
01:13:12,784 --> 01:13:14,001
I know there's something
bad going on here.

1124
01:13:14,032 --> 01:13:15,473
- Keith, open this door,
right now.

1125
01:13:15,504 --> 01:13:16,624
- I can't let you keep
getting away with it.

1126
01:13:16,657 --> 01:13:17,776
- You do not know what
you're doing.

1127
01:13:17,808 --> 01:13:19,409
You have no idea
what's going on.

1128
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,137
- I'm going to find out what
you've been hiding, Brian.

1129
01:13:21,968 --> 01:13:23,249
I'm going to find proof.

1130
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,297
- No, no, no, no, no.

1131
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:26,993
Keith, don't walk away!

1132
01:13:27,024 --> 01:13:28,177
No, please, come back!

1133
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:30,352
Keith, Keith, please!

1134
01:13:30,385 --> 01:13:31,953
I can't protect you.

1135
01:13:31,985 --> 01:13:34,032
Keith, I can't. Come back,
Keith.

1136
01:13:34,065 --> 01:13:36,850
No! Keith, come back, please!

1137
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,480
I can't protect you!

1138
01:13:40,464 --> 01:13:41,936
Oh my God, no, no.

1139
01:13:41,968 --> 01:13:43,825
Shit, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1140
01:13:43,856 --> 01:13:44,688
Keith, no, no, no, no.

1141
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:46,064
Please come back, turn around.

1142
01:13:46,097 --> 01:13:48,144
Keith, please God,
please turn around.

1143
01:13:48,176 --> 01:13:49,073
Do not go in there.

1144
01:13:49,104 --> 01:13:50,160
Shit, no, no!

1145
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,448
Keith, no, no, no, Keith!

1146
01:13:54,481 --> 01:13:56,050
Turn around, Keith.

1147
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,424
No, no.

1148
01:14:34,832 --> 01:14:35,632
I'm sorry.

1149
01:15:25,169 --> 01:15:26,608
What did you do?

1150
01:15:26,641 --> 01:15:28,400
What the fuck did you do?

1151
01:15:29,521 --> 01:15:30,833
I know about everything, Brian.

1152
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:32,528
- What did you do?

1153
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:33,617
- It's over.

1154
01:15:33,648 --> 01:15:35,568
I found all, all,

1155
01:15:36,593 --> 01:15:38,321
all the shit you've
been covering up.

1156
01:15:38,352 --> 01:15:40,081
I took your keys right
from under you.

1157
01:15:40,112 --> 01:15:41,328
- You little bastard.

1158
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,184
- I went into that closet.

1159
01:15:43,217 --> 01:15:44,624
I found the files.

1160
01:15:44,656 --> 01:15:45,552
I found the boxes with the files

1161
01:15:45,584 --> 01:15:46,896
you've been covering up,
asshole.

1162
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:55,504
Yeah, you better run, asshole.

1163
01:15:55,536 --> 01:15:57,521
No, stop, I'm serious, man.

1164
01:15:57,552 --> 01:15:59,024
I'm gonna turn you in Brian.

1165
01:15:59,056 --> 01:15:59,825
I know about Keith.

1166
01:15:59,857 --> 01:16:01,201
I know what's in this store.

1167
01:16:02,577 --> 01:16:03,377
- You do?

1168
01:16:05,072 --> 01:16:05,872
- Yeah.

1169
01:16:06,865 --> 01:16:10,097
Corruption, cover-ups, evil.

1170
01:16:10,128 --> 01:16:11,888
- Oh sweet Jesus.

1171
01:16:11,921 --> 01:16:13,456
I cannot believe how
stupid I was

1172
01:16:13,488 --> 01:16:15,408
to trust you on Black Friday.

1173
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,945
- I know about Keith.

1174
01:16:16,977 --> 01:16:18,448
I found his journal.

1175
01:16:18,481 --> 01:16:19,985
I have his death
certificate right here.

1176
01:16:22,512 --> 01:16:23,825
He died working here, Brian,

1177
01:16:23,857 --> 01:16:26,065
and I won't let him die in vain.

1178
01:16:26,096 --> 01:16:28,594
You covered it up, evil
piece of shit!

1179
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:30,224
You care more about making money

1180
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:32,720
than the lives of
your employees.

1181
01:16:37,073 --> 01:16:39,089
- You've never been more wrong

1182
01:16:39,121 --> 01:16:41,488
in your entire fucking life,
kid.

1183
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:48,880
- Oh, just calm down.

1184
01:17:01,329 --> 01:17:03,953
- Oh, I failed, I failed.

1185
01:17:06,544 --> 01:17:07,345
It's done.

1186
01:17:13,424 --> 01:17:15,056
The money's gonna be gone soon.

1187
01:17:18,481 --> 01:17:19,600
The store's about to
be bankrupt,

1188
01:17:19,632 --> 01:17:23,281
and I have nothing,
nothing left to feed you.

1189
01:17:32,945 --> 01:17:33,745
Help me,

1190
01:17:41,168 --> 01:17:43,474
for I don't know what to do.

1191
01:17:43,505 --> 01:17:44,912
- The only thing that I've done

1192
01:17:44,944 --> 01:17:48,625
for the last 20 miserable
years of my life

1193
01:17:48,656 --> 01:17:51,440
is to work to keep
this place alive.

1194
01:17:51,472 --> 01:17:53,552
You could live 10 lifetimes
and not comprehend

1195
01:17:53,584 --> 01:17:55,025
the lengths that I've gone to.

1196
01:17:55,889 --> 01:17:58,225
- No, no, I know exactly
what's happening asshole-

1197
01:17:58,256 --> 01:18:00,496
- No, you don't!

1198
01:18:00,529 --> 01:18:01,328
- Talk to me.

1199
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:04,625
Tell me what to do.

1200
01:18:04,657 --> 01:18:05,457
Where are you?

1201
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:10,001
I've given you everything,
I've always been there for you.

1202
01:18:12,177 --> 01:18:16,113
I need your help, please
tell me, what can I do?

1203
01:18:16,145 --> 01:18:17,712
- I have been trying
to protect you,

1204
01:18:17,744 --> 01:18:21,552
to keep anything from
happening to you, to any of us.

1205
01:18:21,584 --> 01:18:22,352
- Really?

1206
01:18:22,384 --> 01:18:23,408
Is that why you fired Sarah?

1207
01:18:23,441 --> 01:18:25,072
- I fired her to keep her safe.

1208
01:18:25,104 --> 01:18:26,064
Listen to me.

1209
01:18:26,096 --> 01:18:28,144
I kept those documents to
figure this out

1210
01:18:28,176 --> 01:18:29,840
and to keep people safe.

1211
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:31,664
All those people,
everyone who got hurt,

1212
01:18:31,696 --> 01:18:32,880
they all asked questions.

1213
01:18:32,912 --> 01:18:35,952
That's why they were
punished, but not by me.

1214
01:18:35,984 --> 01:18:39,153
Michelle, Ernesto, Bernard.

1215
01:18:39,185 --> 01:18:40,304
They were starting to
figure it all out,

1216
01:18:40,336 --> 01:18:41,841
but Keith came the closest.

1217
01:18:41,873 --> 01:18:44,144
So if Sarah would've come back
after uncovering that shit,

1218
01:18:44,176 --> 01:18:45,328
they would've killed her too.

1219
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,633
- Bullshit, this is you, Brian.

1220
01:18:47,665 --> 01:18:48,880
This is all you!

1221
01:18:49,745 --> 01:18:51,665
- Shut the fuck up and
listen to me.

1222
01:18:55,088 --> 01:18:56,241
We don't have much time.

1223
01:19:00,912 --> 01:19:01,905
If you'd like to share your

1224
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:02,993
experience with us,

1225
01:19:03,025 --> 01:19:04,209
find our friendly Brooke's

1226
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,905
general manager, Gene Knibbs,

1227
01:19:06,801 --> 01:19:08,753
Gene?

1228
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:09,745
Hello?

1229
01:19:10,673 --> 01:19:11,920
Gene!

1230
01:19:11,952 --> 01:19:13,104
Gene.

1231
01:19:13,136 --> 01:19:15,056
No more games.

1232
01:19:15,088 --> 01:19:16,689
You know that the boss man will

1233
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,000
never surrender.

1234
01:19:18,032 --> 01:19:21,073
So now, after all this time,

1235
01:19:21,105 --> 01:19:23,025
you have our blessing,

1236
01:19:23,057 --> 01:19:24,688
to take care of it.

1237
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:25,584
- Yes.

1238
01:19:25,616 --> 01:19:26,512
- Please.

1239
01:19:26,544 --> 01:19:27,504
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1240
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,256
Yes, I will.

1241
01:19:30,288 --> 01:19:31,633
Yes.

1242
01:19:31,665 --> 01:19:32,560
I will.

1243
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:33,392
- Yes!

1244
01:19:34,737 --> 01:19:36,112
I can?

1245
01:19:37,296 --> 01:19:38,096
I may?

1246
01:19:38,128 --> 01:19:40,752
- Yes, you may.

1247
01:19:40,784 --> 01:19:41,585
- I will.

1248
01:19:42,832 --> 01:19:43,856
I will.

1249
01:19:43,888 --> 01:19:45,872
- Your hard work is paying off.

1250
01:19:45,904 --> 01:19:48,049
No more sitting in the shadows.

1251
01:19:48,081 --> 01:19:50,161
Let us out this cage.

1252
01:19:50,193 --> 01:19:52,049
Let us out of this prison.

1253
01:19:52,081 --> 01:19:52,849
And then,

1254
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:54,929
we will be free.

1255
01:19:54,961 --> 01:19:56,464
- Oh yes.

1256
01:19:56,496 --> 01:19:58,320
Then we will be free.

1257
01:19:58,352 --> 01:19:59,473
- Yes!

1258
01:20:01,136 --> 01:20:02,864
Do it. Do it.

1259
01:20:07,313 --> 01:20:12,145
♪ A Brooke's day is
a great day ♪

1260
01:20:12,688 --> 01:20:16,849
♪ A Brooke's day is
a great day ♪

1261
01:20:24,336 --> 01:20:26,385
- Come on, we have to
do something.

1262
01:20:26,417 --> 01:20:27,856
They feed off this place.

1263
01:20:27,888 --> 01:20:29,265
We have to keep them here.

1264
01:20:29,297 --> 01:20:30,257
Without this store,

1265
01:20:30,289 --> 01:20:32,081
they get out of their
cage, into the world.

1266
01:20:32,113 --> 01:20:34,256
It's our responsibility to
keep them here.

1267
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:35,089
- Who?

1268
01:20:36,305 --> 01:20:37,073
What are you talking about?

1269
01:20:37,105 --> 01:20:38,672
- You can't run from it.

1270
01:20:38,704 --> 01:20:39,664
Here.

1271
01:20:39,696 --> 01:20:40,881
- Who?
- Take these, take 'em.

1272
01:20:40,913 --> 01:20:41,809
Sam, take them.

1273
01:20:41,841 --> 01:20:42,641
He trusts you.

1274
01:20:42,673 --> 01:20:44,017
Sam, it's your responsibility.

1275
01:20:44,049 --> 01:20:45,809
I've done this for as
long as I can.

1276
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,976
Listen closer than you've ever
listened to anything before.

1277
01:20:49,007 --> 01:20:51,152
You have to keep feeding them.

1278
01:20:51,184 --> 01:20:52,847
Sam, feed them.

1279
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,736
You have to keep feeding them.
- Brian? Who?

1280
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,305
- Sam, you have to keep
feeding them.

1281
01:20:56,336 --> 01:20:59,281
Sam.

1282
01:21:12,016 --> 01:21:13,585
Gene,

1283
01:21:13,616 --> 01:21:14,832
wait.

1284
01:21:14,864 --> 01:21:15,665
Listen to me.

1285
01:21:17,169 --> 01:21:18,704
Sam, don't let them out!

1286
01:21:18,736 --> 01:21:20,687
Don't let them out!

1287
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,840
No!

1288
01:21:21,872 --> 01:21:23,409
Lock the doors!

1289
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,416
Keep the doors locked!

1290
01:21:26,447 --> 01:21:27,217
Sam!

1291
01:22:42,929 --> 01:22:46,545
- ♪ A Brooke's day is a
great day, woo hoo hoo! ♪

1292
01:22:50,673 --> 01:22:51,920
It's show time!

1293
01:23:05,327 --> 01:23:06,129
- Sir.

1294
01:23:07,633 --> 01:23:09,071
Please.

1295
01:23:09,104 --> 01:23:10,481
You have to get out.

1296
01:23:10,513 --> 01:23:12,433
Something, something
horrible is happening.

1297
01:23:12,465 --> 01:23:13,745
You, you have to get out.

1298
01:23:13,776 --> 01:23:14,864
Just, just go.

1299
01:23:16,465 --> 01:23:17,489
Sir, please, please.

1300
01:23:17,521 --> 01:23:18,767
You have to, you have
to come with me.

1301
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,049
We can get somewhere safe.

1302
01:23:27,344 --> 01:23:28,785
- Do you like him?

1303
01:23:30,096 --> 01:23:32,111
The closest we could get
to human so far.

1304
01:23:39,984 --> 01:23:41,649
We're so proud of what
we've created.

1305
01:23:43,953 --> 01:23:44,752
Do you like him?

1306
01:23:45,969 --> 01:23:47,857
- No. No. You ki-

1307
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:48,753
- You have no idea

1308
01:23:48,784 --> 01:23:51,185
the power that they
could give us.

1309
01:23:51,216 --> 01:23:54,001
This is the first one that
could actually blend in,

1310
01:23:54,033 --> 01:23:55,793
the first of many.

1311
01:23:55,825 --> 01:23:56,849
- No, you killed-

1312
01:23:56,881 --> 01:23:58,096
you killed-

1313
01:23:58,127 --> 01:23:58,929
- Show him.

1314
01:24:02,513 --> 01:24:04,847
- No,

1315
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,711
no, stop!

1316
01:24:05,744 --> 01:24:06,609
- It's okay, Sam.

1317
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,209
- Stop, I'm serious, man.

1318
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,169
- It's okay, Sam.

1319
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,256
- Don't take another step!

1320
01:24:10,289 --> 01:24:12,273
- You'll never have to
worry again, Sam.

1321
01:24:12,305 --> 01:24:13,073
- Stop.

1322
01:24:13,105 --> 01:24:14,289
- I always knew you'd choose us,
Sam.

1323
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,537
- Please, stop.

1324
01:24:20,111 --> 01:24:22,064
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1325
01:24:22,096 --> 01:24:23,313
- I'm sorry!

1326
01:24:44,207 --> 01:24:46,160
A Brooke's day,

1327
01:24:46,192 --> 01:24:50,097
is a great day.

1328
01:24:51,824 --> 01:24:54,385
No! No!
No!

1329
01:24:55,184 --> 01:24:58,001
- No, Sam, no!

1330
01:25:01,009 --> 01:25:01,841
No!

1331
01:25:01,873 --> 01:25:03,568
- What the fuck?

1332
01:25:04,721 --> 01:25:06,096
- No,
no, no!

1333
01:25:08,593 --> 01:25:10,161
Stop it, no!

1334
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,808
- What the fuck!?

1335
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,713
What the fuck?

1336
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:40,048
Look at what you've done!

1337
01:25:41,425 --> 01:25:43,631
- What the fuck?

1338
01:25:45,425 --> 01:25:47,089
- What have you done?

1339
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,040
Why, Sam?

1340
01:25:52,721 --> 01:25:55,793
Oh.

1341
01:25:55,825 --> 01:25:57,265
- Help me!

1342
01:25:57,297 --> 01:25:58,448
Now!

1343
01:26:14,993 --> 01:26:16,304
Sam,

1344
01:26:16,336 --> 01:26:18,737
you will be punished for this.

1345
01:26:45,713 --> 01:26:47,951
Sam, get back here.

1346
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,360
Get back here, Sam!

1347
01:26:58,353 --> 01:26:59,568
No, no. Don't
touch the light.

1348
01:26:59,601 --> 01:27:01,360
Don't touch it.

1349
01:27:01,391 --> 01:27:02,864
Stay back.

1350
01:27:02,897 --> 01:27:04,401
Stay back.

1351
01:27:04,432 --> 01:27:05,231
Stay back.

1352
01:27:22,961 --> 01:27:24,817
Do you know how hard
we've worked?

1353
01:27:24,848 --> 01:27:25,937
- What the fuck?

1354
01:27:25,969 --> 01:27:26,737
- Do you?

1355
01:27:26,768 --> 01:27:27,537
- What the fuck?

1356
01:27:27,568 --> 01:27:29,648
- This is what we had before,

1357
01:27:29,681 --> 01:27:32,080
but then you went and
killed the customer.

1358
01:27:32,112 --> 01:27:36,912
He was the most evolved
body we made in 40 years.

1359
01:27:37,393 --> 01:27:38,417
- What are you?

1360
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:44,977
Where did you come from?

1361
01:27:46,064 --> 01:27:47,184
- Sam.

1362
01:27:47,216 --> 01:27:48,592
You should know by now,

1363
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:52,528
this store is home to
countless souls,

1364
01:27:52,561 --> 01:27:54,608
damned to hell,

1365
01:27:54,641 --> 01:27:58,192
souls that would otherwise
be trapped forever.

1366
01:27:58,225 --> 01:28:00,145
Don't you feel it?

1367
01:28:00,177 --> 01:28:02,448
When I got this job, a voice,

1368
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,553
it came to me and
offered me a deal.

1369
01:28:05,585 --> 01:28:07,792
If I helped them create bodies,

1370
01:28:07,825 --> 01:28:09,968
in exchange I would
share their power.

1371
01:28:10,001 --> 01:28:13,200
In exchange, I would live
forever with purpose.

1372
01:28:13,233 --> 01:28:16,592
Brian kept us here for so long.

1373
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:17,681
Thought he could stop us.

1374
01:28:18,768 --> 01:28:22,225
We weren't strong enough
yet, but it was inevitable.

1375
01:28:22,257 --> 01:28:26,224
Eventually we would be able
to walk out of the store

1376
01:28:26,257 --> 01:28:28,496
and claim whatever we wanted

1377
01:28:28,529 --> 01:28:29,776
as our own.

1378
01:28:32,656 --> 01:28:33,808
- Are you gonna eat me?

1379
01:28:38,225 --> 01:28:42,608
- Sam, no, if you work
with us, if you help us,

1380
01:28:42,641 --> 01:28:44,016
then your future is set.

1381
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:46,608
If we want this army to
succeed and grow,

1382
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:49,457
we're gonna need people like
Sam Coleman on our side,

1383
01:28:49,488 --> 01:28:52,816
for the culture, the
commitment, and for the cause.

1384
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,001
- Why are you letting them
do this to you?

1385
01:28:58,033 --> 01:28:59,313
- They are mine.

1386
01:29:00,625 --> 01:29:02,672
Don't be like Brian, Sam.

1387
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:05,873
When you let them in, they
take away all your fear,

1388
01:29:05,904 --> 01:29:08,368
all the doubt, it'll
be gone Sam.

1389
01:29:08,401 --> 01:29:10,800
You'll live a life of
peace and purpose.

1390
01:29:11,824 --> 01:29:13,680
Just be a good employee, Sam.

1391
01:29:15,633 --> 01:29:17,264
It's the easiest way for you.

1392
01:29:18,896 --> 01:29:21,296
Just, just give me Brian's keys,

1393
01:29:22,384 --> 01:29:23,792
and I'll know you're with me.

1394
01:29:27,217 --> 01:29:28,561
- If I give you the keys,

1395
01:29:30,608 --> 01:29:32,977
will I really be okay?

1396
01:29:39,025 --> 01:29:39,985
- It's okay.

1397
01:29:44,848 --> 01:29:46,897
Just put them in my hands.

1398
01:29:55,441 --> 01:29:57,265
You'll never have to
worry again, son.

1399
01:30:17,137 --> 01:30:17,936
Sam?

1400
01:30:20,017 --> 01:30:21,232
Sam.

1401
01:30:37,330 --> 01:30:38,128
- No.

1402
01:30:41,488 --> 01:30:42,288
No!

1403
01:30:44,017 --> 01:30:46,128
- It didn't have to go this way,
kid.

1404
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,056
- I'm not letting you-

1405
01:30:47,088 --> 01:30:48,656
- You were never cut
out for this job, kid.

1406
01:30:58,545 --> 01:31:00,209
- Shit, shit.

1407
01:31:00,241 --> 01:31:01,040
Oh my god.

1408
01:32:54,385 --> 01:32:56,112
- Hey,
it's Sarah.

1409
01:32:56,144 --> 01:32:57,361
Sorry, I missed your call.

1410
01:32:57,394 --> 01:33:00,080
Leave a message or whatever,
bye.

1411
01:33:03,376 --> 01:33:04,177
- Sarah.

1412
01:33:06,512 --> 01:33:07,312
I,

1413
01:33:08,657 --> 01:33:09,456
I, uh,

1414
01:33:11,984 --> 01:33:13,488
Hey, um,

1415
01:33:13,521 --> 01:33:14,321
I,

1416
01:33:15,697 --> 01:33:18,192
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
die right about now.

1417
01:33:22,193 --> 01:33:22,992
Yeah.

1418
01:33:24,528 --> 01:33:27,728
So, uh, I wanted to
say some stuff.

1419
01:33:29,808 --> 01:33:30,608
Sarah,

1420
01:33:32,561 --> 01:33:34,992
I am really so, so sorry.

1421
01:33:37,649 --> 01:33:38,448
I'm sorry.

1422
01:33:40,337 --> 01:33:42,640
I'm so sorry I was so scared,

1423
01:33:42,672 --> 01:33:43,474
and,

1424
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:47,760
and I'm sorry it got in the
way of standing up for you.

1425
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,584
You were the best thing
about this place.

1426
01:33:54,641 --> 01:33:55,440
And,

1427
01:33:57,552 --> 01:33:58,992
now, I'm gonna die.

1428
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:02,769
Yeah.

1429
01:34:04,016 --> 01:34:05,136
I'm gonna die.

1430
01:34:19,184 --> 01:34:19,985
No.

1431
01:34:20,913 --> 01:34:22,000
No.

1432
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:25,200
I'm gonna try and fight
my way out of this.

1433
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:28,880
Because,

1434
01:34:30,385 --> 01:34:31,217
compared to this,

1435
01:34:33,616 --> 01:34:35,440
the real world doesn't
sound so scary.

1436
01:34:38,801 --> 01:34:39,600
You were right.

1437
01:34:41,937 --> 01:34:43,216
This job really sucks.

1438
01:35:19,505 --> 01:35:21,008
