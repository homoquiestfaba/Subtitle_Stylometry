1
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:05,531
<i>They did this</i>
<i> experiment in england once.</i>

2
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,666
<i> A group of people were told</i>
<i> that for the following...</i>

3
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,502
<i> Few weeks, hired strangers</i>
<i> would be interfering...</i>

4
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,505
<i> Ever-so-slightly in their</i>
<i> lives.</i>

5
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:16,842
<i> Nothing they would normally</i>
<i> notice, maybe a passerby...</i>

6
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:20,612
<i> On a bicycle or a waiter</i>
<i> at a restaurant.</i>

7
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,781
<i> Just little interactions</i>
<i> set up...</i>

8
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,750
<i> To alter the course</i>
<i> of their routines.</i>

9
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,523
<i> When the study was finished,</i>
<i> the volunteers recounted...</i>

10
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,392
<i> All the things that had</i>
<i> happened to them.</i>

11
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:36,829
<i> And some of them were</i>
<i> seriously affected...</i>

12
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:40,566
<i> By the message they were</i>
<i> being sent.</i>

13
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:44,703
<i> One woman started believing</i>
<i> in god.</i>

14
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,738
<i> But here's the thing.</i>

15
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,540
<i> Nothing was done to them.</i>

16
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:53,212
<i> Their lives had carried on</i>
<i> completely unchanged.</i>

17
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:56,281
<i> The only thing altered was</i>
<i> their perception.</i>

18
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,488
<i> People see what they're</i>
<i> looking for.</i>

19
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,600
Uh... I'm gonna drum roll...

20
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,535
Until you finish setting
up the camera.

21
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,570
Make you go faster. Come on.

22
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,506
Okay. Uh--
you done? You done?

23
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:24,877
September 18th, 2014, terms and
conditions of the experiment.

24
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,613
Rule one, no physical
interference...

25
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,381
With the subject at any time.

26
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,783
Electronic and mechanical
equipment only.

27
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,153
Rule two, strict deadline.

28
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,922
Six weeks to prove hypothesis
or the project is abandoned.

29
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,324
Rule three, objectivity.

30
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,194
No trick editing, no false
narrative...

31
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,729
Everything that you will
witness...

32
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,464
Will be 100 percent real.

33
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:49,434
The theory, simply put,
with the proper execution...

34
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:52,171
It is possible to drive an
unsuspecting person...

35
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:55,774
Into believing that they are
truly being haunted.

36
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,243
Now in our case,
the unsuspecting person...

37
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,712
Is Harold grainey, the creepy,
psycho hermit...

38
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,447
That lives across the street.

39
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,783
We have reason to believe that
something strange...

40
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,485
Is going on in that house.

41
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:10,355
Now the goal is to document
the entire thing.

42
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,291
Say, "hi, Sean."

43
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,259
Whoa, dude, I'm not in this.

44
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,895
Posterity, remember,
this is the process.

45
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,330
We have to document
everything...

46
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,500
And everything includes
shopping... right?

47
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:25,804
This is Mr. Sean Turner,
residence surveillance expert.

48
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,906
Mit-bound mastermind...

49
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,442
Voted most likely to invent
the next Facebook.

50
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,778
Say hi to the kids at home,
Sean.

51
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,514
Hi, kids.

52
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:39,518
Uh, tell them exactly what
it is we're doing here.

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,454
We are purchasing the last
of our supplies.

54
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,523
And supplies for...?

55
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,325
For the surveillance room.

56
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,993
Uh, surveillance headquarters.

57
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,861
I.E. Your bedroom.

58
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,798
Why don't you show everybody
what's in your basket?

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Well?

60
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:58,604
Ugh... all right, fine, here,
take this.

61
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:03,809
All right, just checking the
color contrast, there we go.

62
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,478
Stunning quality... absolutely
stunning.

63
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:13,285
Oh, man, great idea, Sean,
spray painting indoors.

64
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:16,488
Um, why don't you give
everybody the run-down.

65
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,861
Well, in order to fully surveil
someone's house...

66
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,697
Undetected with real-time audio
and video...

67
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,000
You need a high-speed Internet
feed...

68
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:31,536
And you need a few stealthy
gadgets that are surprisingly...

69
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:35,007
Easy to acquire, in fact, all
of these came from skymall.

70
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,775
God bless America...

71
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,544
Selling terrorist-grade spy
equipment on an airplane.

72
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,946
Exactly.

73
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,516
This is a motion-sensor adhesive
mini cam.

74
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:47,686
It's wifi-enabled, you can stick
it to pretty much anything...

75
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,289
It's like the same thing
that the d.A. Uses...

76
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,623
For undercover drug busts.

77
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,694
This is a 2.4 ghz mounted
thin cam.

78
00:04:55,696 --> 00:05:00,432
It's controlled from a remote,
it has zoom aperatures...

79
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,801
And night vision capabilities.

80
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,569
As for the disturbances
themselves...

81
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,805
These are pulse-control
magnets...

82
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,941
Electronic wire trips,
fuse rerouters...

83
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,811
This big guy here
is a low-range Sonic emittor.

84
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:17,649
These are ultra-range wireless
audio bugs.

85
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,053
Now all together, it's enough
to control someone's lights...

86
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:23,355
And home electronics from your
fingertips.

87
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:26,325
We route all of this together
into...

88
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:27,959
Mission control.

89
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,862
Here, take this.

90
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:35,734
All right, so, we have three
monitors, four hard drives...

91
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:39,571
One steady vantage point to
watch us watching the subject.

92
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:43,475
And of course, our beautiful eye
in the sky...

93
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,344
An objective witness cam.

94
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,846
This set up has cost us
a lot of time...

95
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,015
A lot of Sean's father's
money...

96
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,852
Coming fully equipped with a
digital editing bay.

97
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:58,423
This is truly what's going to
make this a goddamn masterpiece.

98
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:04,429
Oh, wow, this thing
got fucked up.

99
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,633
Fascinating.

100
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,836
How are you doing?

101
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,472
I'm done. It's good to go.

102
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,148
All right, it is 8:40 am,
Saturday, September 19th.

103
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,785
Our street cam is in position,
and our subject is on his way...

104
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,153
To his weekly grocery run...

105
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,489
So that means for the
next hour and a half...

106
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:33,125
That house is ours.

107
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:38,730
All right, and there he goes.
Okay, let's do this.

108
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,966
All right, go, go, go!

109
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,907
You good, dude?

110
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,544
Yeah.
Okay, let's go, come on.

111
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:08,493
Hey, dude! The ladder,
get the ladder.

112
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,429
Let's go, come on.

113
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,634
Dude, go! Come on.

114
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:24,810
All right, this place
is fucking creepy.

115
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,211
Anthony, you want to make
yourself useful?

116
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,914
I am, I'm talking with you.

117
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,549
Hurry up!

118
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,787
Sweet record player, grainey.

119
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,026
Huh... I guess that means
no basement cam.

120
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,527
Oh, shit!

121
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,230
Ugh, stupid fucking cat.

122
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,203
What?

123
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:55,240
Well, all right, extreme home
makeover time.

124
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,096
Is it on?

125
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,564
Yeah, but we gotta hide it
better.

126
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,132
Relax, it's fine.

127
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,268
No, it's not, okay!
And we gotta get out of here.

128
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,702
I still have to plant the audio.

129
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,638
Hey! Relax, it's gonna work.

130
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,841
All right, I will work on this,
you finish up.

131
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:07,212
Hey, Sean, it's gonna be fine.

132
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,791
Ladies and gentlemen,
i present to you exhibit c...

133
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,326
The living room cam...

134
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,663
The camera that ultimately
captured the tragedy.

135
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:29,234
And this is clip number one,
September 19th, 2014.

136
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:34,172
The first day of the so-called
"haunting project."

137
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,742
The haunting project?

138
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,044
For lack of a better title.

139
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,912
Yeah, for lack of a much
better title.

140
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,848
All right, seriously, and you
guys can just do all that...

141
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,183
Stuff from this room?

142
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,118
It's brilliant, actually,
i mean...

143
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,187
I don't think that anybody
has ever done...

144
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,689
Anything quite like this.

145
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,358
Except that they have.

146
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,193
Okay, explain.

147
00:09:55,195 --> 00:10:00,065
Um, okay, how about a million
movies and TV shows?

148
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:04,736
I mean, like scare tactics,
paranormal whatever...

149
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,338
It's the same shit.

150
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,975
Ashley, i-- I don't think you
fully understand...

151
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,643
The scope of the project.

152
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,079
I mean, we're not punking
somebody here.

153
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:17,916
We're driving them to question
their own beliefs.

154
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:21,286
I mean, this is real, right?

155
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,822
Only it's not real, it's
bullshit.

156
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:27,626
No, Sean, help her out, okay?
Give her the scoop.

157
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,028
What you're talking about
is fiction...

158
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,865
What people think people
would do...

159
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,701
When confronted by a
supernatural presence.

160
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,904
Set up cameras,
call a psychic...

161
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,173
But would anyone actually
do that?

162
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,410
Short of an actual ghost
being in the house...

163
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:47,912
This is as real as it gets.

164
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:52,384
Come on, every great filmmaker
takes their own next step.

165
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:56,287
And this is my next step.

166
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,289
So, you're gonna torture some
poor old man...

167
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,091
That's the next step?

168
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,128
Ashley, the fact that you just
said that proves to me...

169
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,963
That you have no idea
who grainey is.

170
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,831
Okay, well, what does that mean?

171
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,333
It means Harold grainey
is an asshole.

172
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,734
Yeah, he's a psychopath.

173
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,703
He's bat-shit crazy.

174
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:14,839
I mean, he beat his wife
until she left.

175
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,841
Yeah, and now he just sits
in the house all day...

176
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,109
Drinking himself to death.

177
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,878
Yelling at anybody who
bothers him.

178
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,414
What, because he doesn't let
kids in his yard...

179
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,783
You're gonna scare an old man
half to death?

180
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:27,285
Trust me, he deserves it.

181
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,753
Why?

182
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,857
I'm not gonna get into it.

183
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,226
But there's other shit, too.

184
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,829
He used to call the cops on us
all the time, even as kids.

185
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,931
And didn't he poison the
lindeman's dog?

186
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,167
Yes, yes, he did.

187
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,002
And he watches people.

188
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:48,907
Yeah, he is an old, miserable,
wife-beating, dog-killing...

189
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,475
Drunk sack of shit.

190
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,144
I mean, I for one, am not gonna
lose any sleep over this.

191
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:56,247
Well, what do you mean he
watches people?

192
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,950
I mean, he watches people,
the neighbors.

193
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,086
He just stands in the window
and stares at them.

194
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,154
Yeah, it's creepy.

195
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:06,357
Even at night, when you
can see him.

196
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:10,128
Harold grainey's a freak. He's
probably watching us right now.

197
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,297
Fuck you.
I'm serious!

198
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,432
Ten bucks says grainey
is watching us right now.

199
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,967
We can see it right here
on the th--

200
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,068
you guys!
No, come on!

201
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,203
Look, take a look.

202
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,872
Take a look.

203
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,208
Get on over there.

204
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:30,148
Okay, so you see that beige
house right there by Sanjay's?

205
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,885
Okay, look up in the top
left window.

206
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,387
Right there, do you see that?

207
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,289
The shadow?

208
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,390
I don't see anything.

209
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,859
No, babe, behind the curtain?

210
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:47,065
Look closer... closer.

211
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:52,103
What the fuck? Ethan!

212
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,372
Fucking asshole!
I told you, you'd be surprised.

213
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,107
Turn that light back on.

214
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,542
All right, it was not
that funny.

215
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,378
Oh, it was that funny... Sean?

216
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,548
Nice.

217
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:11,122
Day six, first incident, we're
gonna call this one light's out.

218
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,525
Now as you can see, I've--
wait.

219
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,060
Cat... oh, damn it.

220
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,129
Here, take this. I can change
to the ceiling cam.

221
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,931
No, no, no, this shot is better.

222
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,968
Uh, do not enter.

223
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,905
I told you not to point
that thing at me.

224
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,040
I just told you not
to enter, so--

225
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,942
why are the lights so low?

226
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,911
Do you need something?

227
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:36,981
I'm on my way to work, there's
money on the counter for pizza.

228
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,850
And Sean, don't let him do
anything stupid...

229
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,151
And can you at least try
to hide the beer?

230
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,386
Yeah, noted.

231
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:45,089
Wait, can you shut the door,
please?

232
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,858
Okay, start from the top.

233
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,294
Wait for the fucking cat
to move.

234
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,937
Come on, baby.

235
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,313
All right, you ready?

236
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,325
Oh, shit.

237
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,146
Grainey, you okay?

238
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,351
So now what?

239
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,186
Well, now we wait.

240
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,557
I don't want to drink any more
of that beer.

241
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,893
Why, you want a fucking zima
or something?

242
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,295
No, it just tastes like shit.

243
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,297
Okay, I'll be sure to get you
something frilly.

244
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,965
You can get a Cosmopolitan
or something.

245
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,300
Bottled diarhea or something.

246
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,935
Well, it's a man's beer...

247
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,570
So it makes sense that you
don't like it.

248
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,139
Fucking pussy.

249
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,408
Oh, it's so terrible, isn't it?

250
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,177
I just puked a little bit.

251
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,213
In your pants?
No, I'm good.

252
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,615
Dude, he's sleeping.

253
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:21,386
He's not sleeping. Look at him.

254
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,520
Do it!

255
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:40,571
Is he gonna move or...?

256
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,586
Where you going, grainey?

257
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,603
Yeah.

258
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,541
Oh, shit.

259
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,279
What's going on?
Dude, turn the lights back on.

260
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,314
Yeah.

261
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,355
What the hell is this?

262
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,263
Evening, sir.
Evening.

263
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,100
I'm responding to your alarm
that went off a short while ago.

264
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,235
What alarm?

265
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,636
You're getting this, right?

266
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,306
Yeah, but we don't have any
audio in the foyer.

267
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,475
Jesus.

268
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,610
No, it hasn't worked
for 15 years.

269
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:56,614
Well, maybe it's just an
electrical disturbance.

270
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,750
We are required to respond.

271
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,685
You mind if I come in?

272
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:04,288
Um, yeah, yeah, I do.

273
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,357
Sorry?

274
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,760
I said, "yes, I do."

275
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:12,663
And the only disturbance
I've had tonight is you.

276
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:19,404
All right, I'm glad you're safe.

277
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,105
Thank you.
Have a good night.

278
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,442
Thanks for your concern.

279
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,150
Holy shit, did you just
see that?

280
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,751
What do you think he said
to him?

281
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,835
Please state your full name
and occupation for the jury.

282
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,837
Christopher Todd Palmer...

283
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,206
Officer in the Ashland police
department.

284
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,109
And how did you first come into
contact with the accused?

285
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,611
I was the first officer to
respond to the scene that night.

286
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:04,382
Officer Palmer, would you please
describe for the court...

287
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:08,686
Exactly what you saw when you
entered 614 covered bridge road?

288
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:11,589
After responding to the call,
i canvassed the house.

289
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:15,426
I entered through the open
front door with my weapon drawn.

290
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,830
I was the only officer there
at the time.

291
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:21,499
And what did you find when
you entered the house?

292
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,368
I heard a noise coming from
the living room...

293
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,304
So I approached.

294
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:29,240
That's when I saw the defendant
standing over a body...

295
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,609
Covered in blood.

296
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,847
Harold?

297
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,350
Harold!

298
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,152
I know you're in there!

299
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:42,787
Whoa, check this out.

300
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,191
Hey, dude! Dude, hey!
Wake up!

301
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,494
We got a visitor.

302
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:55,733
Here he comes.

303
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,136
I need for you to sign these.

304
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,771
I can see your car out here.

305
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,209
Hey, what the hell just
happened?

306
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,378
Crap, I don't think our video
card driver...

307
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,147
Likes our surveillance software.

308
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,816
We-- we have to get this! All
right, you said this would work!

309
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,252
Yeah, I know, I'm not doing
this on purpose, it just--

310
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,387
oh, there, it was just
interference.

311
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:27,798
I wonder if this is the infamous
ex-Mrs. grainey?

312
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,601
Thought he would have poisoned
her, too.

313
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,203
Okay, fine, Harold!

314
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,805
You win... again!

315
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,477
What she leave there?

316
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,314
What the hell is wrong
with him?

317
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,660
What do you think so far?

318
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,862
Uh, it doesn't really matter
what I think.

319
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,898
Objectivity, right?

320
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,566
Yeah, but you're the social
scientist here.

321
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,336
I mean, what are your
observations?

322
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:41,505
Uh, honestly?
Yeah, honestly.

323
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:44,408
I think scientifically...

324
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,644
It's interesting enough just
watching someone.

325
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:50,281
Uh, you know, observing someone
in their natural state...

326
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:54,518
Uninfluenced... there's
something fascinating about it.

327
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,521
Yeah, kind of.

328
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:01,826
But, uh... that's not what
we're doing here.

329
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,728
Remember that?

330
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,572
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

331
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,942
Rocky... rocky!

332
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,544
Get out of here! Get out
of here, you half breed!

333
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,647
Shut up! Get him out of here!

334
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,882
Hey, come on, what's the problem
here, man?

335
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:27,418
What's the problem?

336
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,687
Well, the problem is your dog is
pissing and messing up...

337
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:32,823
My property. Let him piss on
your property, okay?

338
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:36,327
Come on! Easy, easy!

339
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,429
Maybe I should teach him
a lesson.

340
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:41,365
Keep that son of a bitch
on a leash, okay?

341
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,367
'Cause the next time, if it
happens again...

342
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:46,537
I'm gonna cut him in four pieces
and send him home in this can.

343
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,708
Let's go, boy.

344
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,410
Let's go, boy.

345
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,785
Come on.

346
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,503
Mwah-hah-hah!

347
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,919
Harold?

348
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:19,130
Harold?

349
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:22,933
This screen door won't stay
closed. It keeps popping open.

350
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:26,570
The kitchen is a mess.
I have to get groceries.

351
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,973
Do you think you can
give me a hand?

352
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,982
You know, I really need your
help around here.

353
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:42,953
I mean, just-- just once,
for me, just something!

354
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,828
Can you at least fix this door?

355
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:07,778
See you tonight, grainey.

356
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,587
Ashley, you've never even
been camping.

357
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:21,492
Why would you-- why-- you just
bought that for no reason?

358
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,596
Quiet, I'm on the phone.

359
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,465
Why are you drawing dicks
on everything?

360
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,867
It's my "faux de cocks".
What?

361
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,603
No, no,

362
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,205
Sean's just filmin me right now.
It's so immature.

363
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:36,106
Reprimanding me.
On so many levels.

364
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:39,210
Because I've got cocks
on my wall.

365
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:42,012
Well, no, they weren't--
i drew them on the wall.

366
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,681
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen.

367
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:45,583
This is part two of a segment...

368
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:48,018
That I like to call
"knock knock".

369
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,055
You ready? All right.

370
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:55,559
Go, and ready, and wakey-wakey!

371
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:14,111
There we go, that's a good
little boy.

372
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,916
Here he comes.

373
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,576
He's so confused.

374
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,077
Why isn't he moving?

375
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,082
I don't know. Let's speed
up the door.

376
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,317
Okay.

377
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,321
What the fuck?
Where's he going?

378
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:03,761
Why doesn't he care
about the door?

379
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:05,996
Not in his bedroom.

380
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,799
He's not outside, i--

381
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,601
the garage.

382
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:14,338
Shit. I told you we
needed a camera in there.

383
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,307
I mean, this is one of these
vital moments where--

384
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,975
whoa, whoa, whoa!
Is that--

385
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,924
Jesus fucking Christ.

386
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,673
He's fucking crazy.

387
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:53,611
Holy shit.

388
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,646
What the fuck?

389
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:01,085
Is he-- is he looking at us?

390
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,354
Holy shit, dude!
Hold on!

391
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:05,289
He knows!
He does not know!

392
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,757
Just hold on!
Of course, he knows!

393
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,225
Look at his fucking eyes!

394
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,293
I mean, he's probably coming
over here right now!

395
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,729
Sean, hold on! Relax.

396
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,030
Zoom in.

397
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:20,304
See? He's just staring
at the wall.

398
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,773
Now this guy is fascinating.

399
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,046
Ethan?
Wait, where is he going?

400
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,990
He's going outside.
Check the other cameras!

401
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,029
Okay.
No. No. No.

402
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,031
Well, where is he?

403
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,866
Ethan?

404
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:50,100
You swear he didn't see us?

405
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,805
Uh, maybe he'll leave.

406
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,875
Okay, take the camera.

407
00:27:57,877 --> 00:27:59,977
No, I'm not gonna take the
camera! We need to hide, man!

408
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,046
Shut up! Just take the camera!

409
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,050
Are you fucking kidding me?

410
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:08,018
What? He's not gonna kill two
people on their own door step.

411
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,386
He's not that crazy.
You're sure?

412
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:12,056
Okay, if this is done,
then it's done.

413
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,390
So we either call the cops...

414
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,092
Or go to the door and see
what he wants.

415
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:17,795
Either way, if you don't record
this...

416
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:20,064
I'm gonna come back here
and kill you myself.

417
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,267
Shit.

418
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,772
Ethan.

419
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,781
Dude, no!

420
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,797
Ethan!

421
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,046
Ethan?

422
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,385
Ethan!

423
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,893
There you are!

424
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,364
I get one night with you...

425
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:04,134
And I have to spend it coming
across town hunting you down?

426
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,570
Why didn't you answer
your phone?

427
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,960
You crazy old man.

428
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,565
Oh, thats nice.

429
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,568
Yeah.

430
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,837
Get you in the limo.

431
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,072
Fuck, i--
Jesus, man.

432
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,473
You have a problem.
It's 10:00 in the morning.

433
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:44,408
I-- i--

434
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,276
we are 11 days in.

435
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:48,011
Some definite incidents
to report.

436
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,915
Uh, this is the first time that
Mr. grainey has not left...

437
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,218
His house at the usual time
in four weeks.

438
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,254
Also, a few slight hiccups
in our disturbances.

439
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:59,623
The first of which was alerting
the police...

440
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,892
With our electrical
interference.

441
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:05,562
And the second, and more
interesting being...

442
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:09,900
What can only be described as a
psychotic, violent assault...

443
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,535
On the old man's own property.

444
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:15,172
Uh, one thing is for sure, it
doesn't seem that he suspects...

445
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:19,142
Any human interference, but his
behavior is definitely changing.

446
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:24,348
As such, the experiment at this
point, can only be described...

447
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,017
As a success.

448
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,020
I just think we should
be careful.

449
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:32,522
Why don't you tell everybody
why you feel this way?

450
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,224
Why don't you turn
the camera off?

451
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,460
I'm just saying, why do you
want to stop this?

452
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:40,464
Oh, let me guess, you're afraid
that it's actually gonna work.

453
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,269
Hey, Sean, honey, whose house
are you at tonight?

454
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:47,004
My mom's.

455
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,573
And is she cooking you dinner?

456
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:53,143
Uh, no, she's working late
again.

457
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,544
Well, then, you're having
dinner with us... again.

458
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,115
Great.

459
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,252
You know who little Albert is?

460
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,488
It's some weird way of
introducing me to your dick?

461
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:09,993
We learned about this in psych,
dude.

462
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:17,200
Back in the 20's, Johns Hopkins
university did this messed up
experiment on behavioral
conditioning in infants.

463
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:20,704
The baby they used was called
little Albert.

464
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,106
They would set little Albert
on a mattress...

465
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,508
Next to a white lab rat.

466
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,344
At first, he just played
with it.

467
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:29,446
He didn't have any reason
to be scared.

468
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,215
But after a while, every time
he touched the rat...

469
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,284
It would startle him.

470
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,053
Ringing loud bells or whatever.

471
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:37,587
And Albert would cry.

472
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,023
Eventually he started to
associate the rat...

473
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:42,092
With frightening sensations...

474
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,728
And whenever he saw anything
that looked even like a rat...

475
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,565
With or without the sound,
he became terrified.

476
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:51,435
Okay, help me out, because i
know you have some point here.

477
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:58,375
My point is... be careful how
far we push this guy.

478
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,744
We're creating something that
isn't what it seems.

479
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:03,113
It can do more damage
than you think.

480
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:08,685
All right, boys,
it's almost ready.

481
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,989
I'm just saying... they never
cured little Albert.

482
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,265
All right, so tonight, we're
gonna take things down a notch.

483
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,402
Maybe slamming doors was a
little bit too much, too fast.

484
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,004
So, we've come up
with a new haunt.

485
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:30,474
It's always a classic,
and relatively harmless.

486
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:34,177
Now as you'll notice, our old
man fell into another...

487
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,046
Whiskey-drenched slumber.

488
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:38,682
Well, that is a shame that we're
gonna have to wake him up.

489
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:43,353
This little number I like to
call, "the moonlight sonata".

490
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,491
Oh, wow, and this could not be
more perfect.

491
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:50,160
Sean, if you'll do the honors.

492
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:05,442
Dude, oh, my god, that's--

493
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,551
what are you doing?

494
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:52,556
Carrie, what are you doing?

495
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,758
I'm dancing, Harold.

496
00:34:56,562 --> 00:35:00,764
Carrie, it's 3:00
in the morning.

497
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,432
Is it?

498
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,604
You're drunk, Carrie.

499
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,874
I think on a night like this I'm
allowed to be, don't you think?

500
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:15,579
No, I don't, I think you
should be in bed.

501
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:19,216
So I can wake up tomorrow and
everything will be better?

502
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,819
So you're being--

503
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,394
no! I want to dance!

504
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,500
Listen to me.
No!

505
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:38,668
Oh, my god!
The neighbors are gonna hear us.

506
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,204
Do you think I care about the
fucking neighbors?

507
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,441
What are you doing?

508
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:51,882
What are you doing?

509
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,726
Hm... that's interesting.

510
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,762
At least he didn't
hit it with an axe.

511
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,200
All right, it's 11:40 pm.

512
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,901
And grainey just unlocked
the padlock...

513
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:47,504
And went down into his basement.
Check it out.

514
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:50,273
What the hell is a 150-year-old
man doing...

515
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,242
In a basement at midnight?

516
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,781
It's not the lock that matters,
Sean.

517
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,616
It's what's worth locking up.

518
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:02,319
I mean, grainey doesn't even
lock his front door...

519
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,520
But he locks his basement?

520
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:06,590
Isn't that strange to you?

521
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,692
Yeah, no, that's definitely
strange to me.

522
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:11,995
And there's something mysterious
happening...

523
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,798
But I also think we need
to maintain objectivity...

524
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,834
Which is one of our rules, and
not jump to conclusions, so--

525
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,937
man, we're gonna be so fucking
famous after this.

526
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,305
What, man?

527
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:23,940
We're gonna be so fucking
famous.

528
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,609
I think people are gonna find
it interesting, absolutely.

529
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,510
You're gonna be famous
in your lifetime...

530
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,246
It's 'cause you're
YouTube famous.

531
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,281
'Cause you made like make-up
tutorial videos...

532
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,816
Or candle reviews.

533
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,585
Dude, you know what? I respect
the candle reviewers.

534
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,653
I mean, come on!
Hah-hah-hah!

535
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,989
What? They got viewership.

536
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:41,758
I mean, I would give the world
for a million views.

537
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,593
Yeah, of course, you would.

538
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,896
This goes out to all the people
that gave me one million views.

539
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:08,418
Captain's log, day 13.

540
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,655
Our fearless leader
has succumbed...

541
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:14,524
To a six pack of keystone light.

542
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:18,862
But we must forge ahead and film
absolutely everything...

543
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:20,597
For posterity.

544
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,501
This is Ethan, asleep...

545
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:28,571
Across from a video
of an open doorway.

546
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,607
Exciting stuff.

547
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:34,978
Notice the drool forming
on Ethan's pillow...

548
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,579
Next to his face.

549
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,915
We'll keep that for the
director's cut.

550
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:44,387
This is Ethan's shoe, which
features a crudely-drawn...

551
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:48,058
Flock of peni for some reason.

552
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,893
Let's play a game called...

553
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:53,330
How many things does Ethan
have open on his computer...

554
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:55,899
Slowing down our video feed.

555
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:59,636
Okay, let's do this.

556
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:05,508
World news, close.
Buzzfeed, close.

557
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:11,681
Reddit, close, Facebook,
spotify, netflix...

558
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,450
Close, close, close.

559
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,989
Pornography... of the Asian
variety.

560
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:25,962
Unshaved, uh, very discreet,
Ethan, close.

561
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:29,866
An imdb search for...
'Mac and me'.

562
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:34,437
Close, and--

563
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:06,803
dude, dude, dude, dude,
wake up.

564
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:09,139
What?
Get up!

565
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,508
I gotta show you something.
Here, take the camera.

566
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,948
Fuck... what?

567
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,452
Okay, so, this is grainey
going down...

568
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:25,855
To the basement at 11:38 pm.
Okay.

569
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:28,491
This is grainey now.
Live feed.

570
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:29,926
Okay, yeah.

571
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,495
And this is grainey coming out
of the basement.

572
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,499
Okay, i--

573
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,435
note the time difference.

574
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:41,938
6:55 am... so he was down
there all night?

575
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,773
Seven hours.

576
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,442
I mean, what the hell would he
be doing in the basement...

577
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:48,077
In the middle of the night
for seven hours?

578
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,915
Oh, wow, do I detect some actual
enthusiasm in your voice?

579
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:53,983
And not whiny hesitation?

580
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,019
Any opportunity to be an idiot.

581
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,792
Okay, it's day 15,
2:10 in the morning.

582
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,561
Got a very interesting one
for you tonight.

583
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:06,162
This one is called "cold spots""

584
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:10,033
now the original idea behind
this was to kill the thermostat.

585
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:12,769
To mimic the drop in temperature
brought on by spirits.

586
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:16,906
But Sean here had the ingenious
idea for the windows.

587
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,975
Sean, if you will.

588
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:22,545
Okay, so, there's a chemical
solvent that you can make...

589
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:25,114
From an alkaline battery which,
among other things...

590
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,650
Causes glass to crack
in the cold.

591
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,886
It's essentially an
anti-anti-freeze.

592
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:32,956
Uh-huh, and Sean spread it all
over the windows...

593
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,691
The night we broke in to
grainey's.

594
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,626
Now we've already killed
the heater...

595
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:38,995
And it's about 36 degrees
outside...

596
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,964
So as you can imagine...

597
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:44,100
That bedroom's gonna get
pretty fucking cold.

598
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,508
It's kind of beautiful watching
an old man sleep...

599
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,511
Thinking, you know,
what he's dreaming about.

600
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:57,814
World war 1.

601
00:41:57,816 --> 00:41:59,716
You falling asleep?
No.

602
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:01,551
Better not be.

603
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,558
Quitter. Quitter!

604
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:45,862
Yo, dude.
Hey, Sean, come here...

605
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:47,564
I want you to see grainey's
face.

606
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,132
What?
Come here!

607
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:57,006
Look, look at grainey's face,
right there, what do you see?

608
00:42:57,008 --> 00:43:00,009
Uh, I don't see anything.

609
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:04,781
No, here... right there.

610
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:07,650
He's shivering. Come on, man,
this is kind of fucked up.

611
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:10,820
No, he's-- he's not shivering.
He's saying something.

612
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,956
The audio, can you--
yeah.

613
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:14,791
Got it.
What are you--

614
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:16,259
ssh, ssh, ssh.

615
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,234
Fuck!
Oh, shit!

616
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,103
You, in the hallway now!

617
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,672
You turn the camera off!
Fuck--

618
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,641
are you out of your mind, Ethan?

619
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,743
Have you listened to what
i said?

620
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:37,146
Right, I'm sorry, I just--
i-- Sean wanted to see it.

621
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:39,983
How could such an elaborate
scheme be executed...

622
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:44,387
Right under your own roof
for upwards of six weeks...

623
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:48,224
Without the least of your
objection or interference?

624
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:51,728
Honestly, I never knew
what they were doing.

625
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,963
You never knew what
they were doing?

626
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:59,202
Your son and his friend spent an
average of 50 hours a week...

627
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:01,304
In your son's bedroom...

628
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:05,108
With a professional grade
equipment hub...

629
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,944
That you didn't purchase,
and you never once inquired...

630
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,847
As to what they were up to?

631
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,849
Of course, I asked.

632
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:16,853
Sean said his father bought
the computers for him.

633
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:18,421
His father had money.

634
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:22,392
Had Ethan and Sean ever gotten
into trouble before?

635
00:44:22,394 --> 00:44:24,327
Sean? Never.

636
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:28,164
But Ethan--

637
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:32,068
he got into some trouble
after his father left.

638
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,803
But meeting Sean this year...

639
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:39,208
It's just been such a good
influence on him.

640
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,878
And trust me, when you're
a mother...

641
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,748
You would so much rather
have your son...

642
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,885
Sitting with his friends in his
room with cameras...

643
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:51,721
Than out god-knows-where...

644
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:54,223
Doing drugs and drinking
and getting into trouble.

645
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:58,261
But would you agree that they
still found a way to get into
trouble?

646
00:44:58,263 --> 00:45:00,963
Objection, your honor.
Argumentative.

647
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,132
I'll rephrase.

648
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:06,269
At no point during your son's
six-week experiment...

649
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:07,937
Did you ever become concerned...

650
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:13,142
That any of their actions could
get them into trouble?

651
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,812
When I came home that night...

652
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:20,049
I noticed that Ethan had gone
through my closet.

653
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,018
And why did this concern you?

654
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:30,026
Because that's where I kept
his father's gun.

655
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,856
It's working.

656
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,331
Hey.

657
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,000
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Um--

658
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,469
she'll be home soon.
Yeah.

659
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:22,939
We have time.

660
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,376
It's freezing in here.

661
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:18,394
Dude, he's just sitting there.
What the fuck?

662
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:49,258
Okay, so, not only did
"cold spots" work...

663
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,495
But it yielded a much more
interesting development.

664
00:48:52,497 --> 00:48:55,531
Now we're both convinced
that our haunts...

665
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,633
And grainey's basement
are somehow related.

666
00:48:57,635 --> 00:49:01,938
And he's been down there
for a couple hours, so--

667
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,540
what do you think is down there?

668
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:07,710
What about his wife?
Hm?

669
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:09,712
It can't be, we already
saw her.

670
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:12,682
Did we?
Yeah, we did.

671
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,383
Yeah, well, how do we know
that was his wife?

672
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:15,718
Maybe it was just some
old woman.

673
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,586
Yeah, but, nobody visits
grainey.

674
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:20,690
Why would some old lady just be
pounding on his door?

675
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:23,960
Who the hell knows? I'm just
saying, add it to the board.

676
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:34,537
You know what the weirdest thing
about this is?

677
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:38,374
No matter what we do to this
guy, he never calls the cops.

678
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:41,344
Or does anything about it for
that matter.

679
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:43,546
Would you call the cops if you
had a body in your basement?

680
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,084
Don't you think it's weird?

681
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:50,586
I mean, after everything
that's happened to this guy...

682
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:55,191
He's never once seemed afraid.

683
00:49:55,193 --> 00:49:57,526
Oh, here he comes.
Mark it, dude. What time is it?

684
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:59,095
8:28 am.

685
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:00,696
Okay, so that's...

686
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:03,766
An hour and ten minutes
in the basement.

687
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:09,438
All right, Sean, you know what
needs to happen now, right?

688
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,273
No way, dude.

689
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:12,508
Yes.
No!

690
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,310
Sean--
we're not going in there.

691
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:16,012
We have talked about this.

692
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:18,147
Yeah, and I said the same thing
then. There's no way.

693
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,349
All we have to do is find
a way past the lock.

694
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:24,387
No, actually, because even
if we break the lock...

695
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:26,055
Which he'll notice...

696
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:27,623
We still have to get in there
when he's not home.

697
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,258
And grainey never leaves
the house.

698
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,160
Who's to say when he's gonna
be leaving again?

699
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:34,130
Listen, all I'm saying is we
have a film to finish.

700
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:35,731
And you and I both know...

701
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:37,533
That there's something going
on in that basement.

702
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,602
Okay, and I have reason to
believe that we're not...

703
00:50:39,604 --> 00:50:40,736
The ones committing
the crime any more.

704
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:42,671
Ethan--
Sean, come on!

705
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:44,774
We're this close, all right?
Don't let me down on this.

706
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:50,312
Seriously, how can you live with
yourself without knowing?

707
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,324
Well, we're not going
when he's there.

708
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:04,660
Okay, yeah, deal.

709
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:06,662
And we still need to find
a way past the lock.

710
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:08,531
Yeah, so we'll find a way.

711
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:10,499
All right, well, any ideas?

712
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:13,069
I don't know, man, you're the
one going to mit, all right?

713
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,236
It's a problem. Just find
a solution.

714
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:29,452
Okay, so, here's the thing.

715
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:32,154
Maybe we don't need to go into
the basement.

716
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:33,689
What?

717
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:37,393
Not if we can get someone else
to go in there for us.

718
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:43,532
Why am I filming this?

719
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:46,569
What? Because. Are we on?

720
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:48,671
Yeah.
Grainey still out?

721
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:52,108
Grainey hasn't moved all
morning.

722
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:55,611
All right, then. Let's go.
Come on.

723
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,416
All right, I want you to go back
in my room, call my phone...

724
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,451
If grainey even moves,
then you tell me, okay?

725
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,819
I'm gonna plant this bug...

726
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:06,188
And you let me know when you
hear it, okay?

727
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,656
I'll be back before you know it.

728
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,430
Okay, I can see you.

729
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:18,334
And grainey still hasn't
moved,so you're all good.

730
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:21,403
Hurry up! Come on.

731
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:22,872
<i> Ethan</i>
<i> can you hear me?</i>

732
00:52:22,874 --> 00:52:24,673
Yeah. Yeah, no,
you're all good...

733
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:27,243
But you should come back now.

734
00:52:27,245 --> 00:52:30,479
<i> Uh, just two seconds. I gotta</i>
<i> get it hooked on this thing--</i>

735
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,384
<i> oh, shit!</i>

736
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:39,688
Oh, come on!
Right now, really? Fuck.

737
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,264
Whoa. Ethan?
<i> Yeah?</i>

738
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:51,901
Yeah, I can't see grainey, so...
You need to come back now.

739
00:52:51,903 --> 00:52:53,869
<i> Okay, okay.</i>

740
00:52:57,475 --> 00:53:00,276
Oh, he was just taking a leak.

741
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:05,714
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck,
oh, fuck.

742
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,279
Run, run, run, run!

743
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:54,997
All right, Sean. Ready to give
Mr. grainey a awake-up call?

744
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,007
Hi, yes, Ashland police
department.

745
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,689
I hope this works.
Don't hope it works, Sean...

746
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:22,558
Expect it to.

747
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:50,819
Mr. grainey. I hope
you're well this evening.

748
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:52,054
I was sleeping.

749
00:54:52,056 --> 00:54:53,422
Does this sound okay?

750
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:54,823
Yeah, ssh, yeah, it's fine.

751
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,558
I was trying to sleep.

752
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,761
I'm sorry for the late hour.

753
00:54:58,763 --> 00:55:00,963
I just wanted to make sure that
you didn't hear anything...

754
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:03,599
Out of the ordinary tonight
while you were sleeping.

755
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:05,467
Anything at all?

756
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:08,837
No, I didn't hear a thing,
so, if you don't mind--

757
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:11,707
the reason I'm here is because
we got a noise complaint.

758
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:13,742
About a woman screaming.

759
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,811
Well, i--

760
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,313
in your basement, sir.

761
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:19,982
In my basement?

762
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,617
Look, we got a call.

763
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:24,620
Apparently one of your neighbors
was walking his dog...

764
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:28,557
Said he heard a woman screaming
in your basement.

765
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,694
That's absurd.

766
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:34,663
Well, then you wouldn't mind if
i come in to take a look, right?

767
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,900
Just to be thorough?

768
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:39,001
Sure.

769
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,748
Be careful.

770
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:58,554
Let's see what you got down
there, grainey.

771
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:00,723
Moment of truth.

772
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,896
It's just storage down here.

773
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:11,760
All right. I think
we're good here.

774
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,908
You sure they said
it was a woman?

775
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:29,478
That's right. Why?

776
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,950
Nah... never mind.

777
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,155
Sorry to disturb you again, sir.
Yeah.

778
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:44,793
You gotta be kidding me.

779
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,465
He didn't find anything?

780
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,867
He wasn't looking hard enough.

781
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:03,645
No, no way!
We're not going in there!

782
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,516
We're not!

783
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,155
Say it again, Sean.
Fuck you.

784
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,958
No, come on, say it
to the camera.

785
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,693
Sean, obviously it's
bothering you...

786
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:20,863
So let's talk about it, okay?
On the record.

787
00:58:20,865 --> 00:58:22,731
You know what I think.

788
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:25,634
What, you think I'm ruining
my own project?

789
00:58:25,636 --> 00:58:28,804
I'm sorry, our project.

790
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:30,539
I think you know you're
ruining it...

791
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:33,775
But it's easier for you
to blame me.

792
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:36,912
We wait until he leaves, we
knock that goddamn door down...

793
00:58:36,914 --> 00:58:38,981
And we see what's in the
basement.

794
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:41,016
Documentary over,
it's that simple.

795
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,851
Unless nothing's in there.
There's--

796
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,720
then documentary ruined...

797
00:58:44,722 --> 00:58:48,524
Burglary charges, and a waste
of all of our time and money.

798
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:50,692
We have one more weekend, okay?
One more haunt.

799
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,628
We move the furniture around,
just like in poltergeist.

800
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:56,832
Just like we planned.
No, no, it needs more.

801
00:58:56,834 --> 00:59:00,702
Come on, doesn't a part of you
need to know what's down there?

802
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,971
Sean, let do something
different?

803
00:59:02,973 --> 00:59:04,873
Let's do something dangerous?

804
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,643
Let's do something your daddy's
not gonna approve of?

805
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,912
What?

806
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:13,649
No, it's just funny that you
should put it that way.

807
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:14,783
What?

808
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:23,191
Do you want to get into what
this is really about, Ethan?

809
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:25,961
What do you mean?

810
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:27,129
I think you know what I mean.

811
00:59:27,131 --> 00:59:29,031
No, Sean, please, enlighten me.

812
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:34,236
I know about grainey...
And your father.

813
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,908
What did you say?

814
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,677
You heard me.

815
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:46,281
Now do you want to turn
the camera off?

816
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:55,991
- That was the afternoon of
October 22nd, 2014. -40 pm.

817
00:59:55,993 --> 00:59:57,926
What did the two of you
discuss...

818
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:00,128
After the camera was turned
off?

819
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:06,368
Should I repeat the question,
Sean?

820
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:09,905
He told me the story of what
really happened with his father.

821
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:11,873
A story you never heard before.

822
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:15,210
Yeah, this all happened before
i moved to the neighborhood.

823
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:22,284
But Ethan would always tell me
that his father left him.

824
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:26,288
And what prompted him to finally
tell you the truth?

825
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:33,028
I found an email open on his
computer from his father.

826
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,763
He always said that he never
talked to him...

827
01:00:34,765 --> 01:00:37,232
So I thought that was strange.

828
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:39,768
I shouldn't have read it, but--

829
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,671
what did Ethan tell you?

830
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:47,943
Well, um... his mom and dad
were having problems.

831
01:00:47,945 --> 01:00:52,347
One night, things got physical,
it was pretty bad.

832
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:55,951
His mom ran out and went
for help.

833
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:58,020
And who's house did she run to?

834
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:03,125
Mr. grainey's.

835
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:07,129
Harold grainey interfered
in a domestic dispute...

836
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:09,097
With Ethan's parents...

837
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:13,068
Causing an altercation of his
own with Ethan's father.

838
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:16,271
And when the police arrived,
Mr. grainey's testimony...

839
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:19,241
Sent Ethan's father to jail
that night, correct?

840
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,678
That's right.

841
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,113
Well, it doesn't sound like Mr.
grainey did anything wrong...

842
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:27,149
In that scenario, does it?

843
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,787
No. It doesn't.

844
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:34,890
And what ended up happening
with Ethan's father?

845
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:39,728
Well, um, the way that
Ethan told it...

846
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:43,098
Grainey had a long talk
with his mom that night.

847
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,168
By the time his dad got out,
she wanted him gone...

848
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,836
And filed for divorce.

849
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:49,705
And full custody of Ethan.

850
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:51,440
Yes.

851
01:01:51,442 --> 01:01:54,443
So despite Ethan's father's
obvious responsibility...

852
01:01:54,445 --> 01:01:57,446
In this particular incident, to
a 13-year-old boy reading...

853
01:01:57,448 --> 01:02:01,717
These emails, it would seem
that an old man interfered...

854
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:05,220
In his life and that
his father was taken away.

855
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,090
It's quite a good reason to hold
a grudge, wouldn't you say?

856
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:10,826
Objection. Speculation.

857
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:14,763
Is it not a fact that Mr.
grainey had a conversation...

858
01:02:14,765 --> 01:02:17,065
With Ethan's mother the night
of the altercation?

859
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,935
And that Ethan never saw his
father again?

860
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:24,906
Yeah, no, but see...

861
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,477
No one was ever supposed
to get hurt.

862
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:32,748
So Ethan never implied that the
man he referred to as, quote,

863
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,950
a "miserable, wife-beating,
drunk piece of shit"...

864
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:36,451
Should be punished...

865
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:40,021
Even to the point where
he might react violently?

866
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:46,428
No, it was just a prank...
An experiment.

867
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:29,204
Here's to my mom working nights,
because if she didn't...

868
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:31,840
We couldn't actively make bad
decisions at my house.

869
01:03:31,842 --> 01:03:32,908
Give it up.

870
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:35,243
One, two, three!

871
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:40,816
Hey Carly, how's that
Tequila treating you.

872
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:42,517
Really good.

873
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:44,286
Hey, give me the camera.

874
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:46,321
No, man, why?
Everyone's gonna see this.

875
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,989
Ted spiegelman, ladies and
gentleman.

876
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,291
Gobble, gobble.

877
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:51,426
The guy that dressed up
like one creepy cock.

878
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:54,129
Biggest cock.
That you are.

879
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:56,398
And you're the only person to
actually dress up...

880
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,436
Well, besides Ashley, who
dressed up like a...

881
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,171
Slutty witch?

882
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:06,241
Yo, hey, man, I was doing good,
come on, give it back.

883
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:09,177
Okay, so he disappears for,
like, two minutes.

884
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,913
And then he comes charging out
of the garage...

885
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:13,849
With this giant fucking axe.

886
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:15,250
Shut up.
No, no, seriously.

887
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:17,853
So wait, wait, wait,
so he takes the axe...

888
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:21,890
And he walks over to the door,
and then he just destroys it!

889
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:23,325
Just like whack! Whack! Whack!

890
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:25,460
Like shelley duvall was on
the other side.

891
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:27,295
Who?

892
01:04:27,297 --> 01:04:28,496
Never mind.

893
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,003
Okay, why don't you put that
thing down now, Ethan?

894
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:37,606
Uh-huh, you know I'm seriously
considering it.

895
01:04:37,608 --> 01:04:42,444
Just uh, two seconds,
i gotta go find Sean.

896
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:52,554
Wow, guys. I don't know if
that's more stupid or racist.

897
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:54,522
What?

898
01:04:54,524 --> 01:04:56,658
Sanjay's from Malaysia. They
don't wear fucking turbans.

899
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,461
Whatever, man.
Asshole.

900
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:08,036
Whoa, um, ow, ow, hi, Carly.
Um, are you having fun?

901
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:12,974
Ethan, I have to apologize.

902
01:05:12,976 --> 01:05:15,277
I gave you shit about your
project...

903
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:17,445
But it actually seems
pretty awesome.

904
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:20,181
Well, thank you.
It is pretty awesome.

905
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:22,350
Do you actually think that
he's a murderer?

906
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:27,255
Well, Carly. You'll just have to
wait and see. Right, Sean?

907
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:30,325
So, is there a place where Sean
and I can go...

908
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:32,494
To get away from all
the cameras?

909
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:34,462
Oh, the cameras are bothering
you?

910
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:37,265
Okay, um, well, you could
go to my room.

911
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:42,938
Oh, okay, no, bad idea.
Why don't you go to Sean's room?

912
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,372
You have your own room here?

913
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:46,608
Well, technically it's
a guest room...

914
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,976
But since Sean practically
lives here--

915
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:50,445
sounds great.

916
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:54,049
Um, well, you guys enjoy
your privacy.

917
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,466
I just get really frustrated...

918
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,536
Having Ethan film everything
that I do.

919
01:06:14,538 --> 01:06:16,638
It's really hard to get you
alone, you know.

920
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,975
It's like you're always
with Ethan.

921
01:06:19,977 --> 01:06:23,111
Yeah, maybe too much, right?

922
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:25,046
What do you mean?

923
01:06:25,048 --> 01:06:30,418
I just feel like what we're
doing is getting a little...

924
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:33,188
I don't know... dangerous.

925
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:42,297
Well...

926
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:44,733
Can't a little danger
be a good thing?

927
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,705
What is that?
What?

928
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:52,273
That.

929
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:54,642
Oh, my god, shit, Ethan!

930
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:56,511
Shit.

931
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:03,151
What the fuck, Ethan!

932
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:05,153
Enjoy your privacy?
Are you kidding me?

933
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:07,255
Just relax.
Give me that! Turn it off!

934
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:09,024
Stop! Relax!
Relax?

935
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:10,658
Relax? This is sick.

936
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,460
Wait, wait, how long
has it been in there?

937
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:14,029
What, do you-- you watch me
sleep now?

938
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:17,532
Sean, it was just for tonight.
I swear.

939
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,734
I wanted to see if you'd say
something about the project.

940
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:21,269
I knew you'd be in there--

941
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:23,505
the project? Forget the
fucking project, okay?

942
01:07:23,507 --> 01:07:25,407
Do you understand what this
means?

943
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:28,710
I'm sorry, I'm sorry about the
camera, but, Sean...

944
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:29,744
You don't get it,
we're so close here.

945
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:31,513
You're obsessed.

946
01:07:31,515 --> 01:07:33,648
Okay, I told you, we're not
going in the basement.

947
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:37,318
We were here to haunt the dude.
Does he not seem haunted to you?

948
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,287
Not enough, no.

949
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:41,489
Well, it's enough for me.

950
01:07:41,491 --> 01:07:44,492
Okay, you got your revenge,
but I didn't sign up for this.

951
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:46,694
Sean, stop!

952
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,498
Are you fucking kidding me?

953
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:55,136
You were nobody until I picked
you up, don't forget that.

954
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:57,405
I had this idea and you had the
brains and money...

955
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,740
To make it happen.

956
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:00,241
And look at what we've
accomplished.

957
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:03,144
So it's exactly what you
signed up for...

958
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:04,712
So don't act like it's not.

959
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:08,716
I mean, would you be anywhere
if it hadn't been for me?

960
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:10,685
Would you have gone
to any parties?

961
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:13,688
Would you have been with Carly
tonight if it wasn't for me?

962
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:16,724
Would you have left your boring,
nerdy, rich circle...

963
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:19,160
And had any fun before
graduation...

964
01:08:19,162 --> 01:08:21,329
If it hadn't been for me?

965
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,199
Fuck you, Ethan.
Fuck me.

966
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:26,868
They're your cameras, Sean.

967
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,838
Your fingerprints, traceable to
your credit card.

968
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,577
Is that a threat?

969
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:38,346
It's the truth.

970
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:41,449
All I've ever wanted from this
project is the truth.

971
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,852
So the world could see exactly
what it is--

972
01:08:43,854 --> 01:08:45,587
the world is only gonna see what
you want them to see, Ethan.

973
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:47,522
Okay?

974
01:08:47,524 --> 01:08:48,790
Don't you get it? I mean, it's
not even about grainey...

975
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:51,226
Any more, it's about you, and--
oh--

976
01:08:51,228 --> 01:08:55,663
I don't even know why I agreed
to do this. I just feel--

977
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:57,632
dude, you know what? Feel
however you want, Sean.

978
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,834
That's fine.

979
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:05,773
I'm sorry about the camera,
that was a shitty thing to do.

980
01:09:05,775 --> 01:09:11,279
But you listen to me very
carefully.

981
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:17,919
Whatever happens here... you
and me are in this together.

982
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:20,822
Got it?

983
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:27,595
Get the fuck out.

984
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:25,853
Come in.

985
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:27,455
Hey.

986
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:28,690
Hey.

987
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:40,001
Uh, hey, so, I'm sorry
about the other night.

988
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:46,507
If it makes you feel any better,
Carly said she really liked you.

989
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:48,476
So... what's up?

990
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:50,678
I want my equipment back.

991
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:54,882
What?

992
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:57,318
The computers, the monitors,
the cameras.

993
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,454
I'll let you edit what you have
so far, but I'm done.

994
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:02,924
Are you're serious?
I just said sorry to you.

995
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:04,859
I mean, what more do you want?

996
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:07,528
That's not what this is about.

997
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:11,766
Okay, you know what,
you're not thinking straight.

998
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,669
Why don't we just take a break,
we'll take a breather...

999
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:16,804
Let's have some beers,
let's hang out, let's--

1000
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:19,507
whoa, whoa, fuck!

1001
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:22,777
Whoa, holy shit.

1002
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,380
No way that actually happened.
That goddamn cat!

1003
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:26,514
I honestly can't believe
that happened.

1004
01:11:26,516 --> 01:11:29,817
Fuck!
All right--

1005
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:31,486
it's over.

1006
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:33,554
What are you talking about?

1007
01:11:33,556 --> 01:11:36,824
What do you mean? The camera is
on the ground.

1008
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:38,559
So the whole thing is over.

1009
01:11:38,561 --> 01:11:40,962
The camera's on the ground
in the den.

1010
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:43,431
Grainey is asleep,
in his bedroom.

1011
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:45,333
It's not that complicated.
Seriously, Ethan...

1012
01:11:45,335 --> 01:11:49,637
Sean, your cameras,
your fingerprints, remember?

1013
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,839
Think about mit.

1014
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:54,509
We know every inch of that
house.

1015
01:11:54,511 --> 01:11:56,411
I will be in and out
in 30 seconds.

1016
01:11:56,413 --> 01:11:58,079
It's not like we've never
broken in before.

1017
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,448
Not while he was home, we
haven't. Are you stupid, Ethan?

1018
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,983
He's asleep.

1019
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:03,451
And what happens when
he wakes up?

1020
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:04,619
Do you remember what he
did to the door?

1021
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:06,054
That was a door.

1022
01:12:06,056 --> 01:12:07,822
Will you just hand me my phone?
Goddamnit, Ethan!

1023
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:08,890
Are you actually crazy?

1024
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:10,625
Hand me my phone!
No.

1025
01:12:10,627 --> 01:12:14,429
If you were ever my friend,
you would back me up right now.

1026
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:16,664
Now I will be gone
for two minutes.

1027
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,666
Text me if grainey wakes up.

1028
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,114
Oh, god.

1029
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:39,113
Okay, go.

1030
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:41,048
Go, go, go, go, go.

1031
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:51,959
No.

1032
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:55,863
No, no, no, no... shit.

1033
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:01,536
No, don't do it.
Don't go down there.

1034
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,823
What is all this?

1035
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,834
Shit.

1036
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:48,776
Oh, shit.

1037
01:15:48,778 --> 01:15:51,112
No, no, no, no, no.

1038
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:53,014
Oh, shit.

1039
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:19,740
Shit, go.

1040
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:24,946
Come on, Ethan, get out
of there, come on.

1041
01:16:24,948 --> 01:16:27,315
Hide, Ethan, hide!

1042
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,688
Oh, no.

1043
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,691
Holy shit.

1044
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,121
Where are you going?

1045
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,760
Okay. Shit.

1046
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:48,262
Don't move yet, Ethan,
i can't see.

1047
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:57,238
What the hell?

1048
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:01,175
Oh, god.

1049
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:12,820
Fuck.

1050
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:58,799
Oh, my god!

1051
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:14,448
Oh, my god! We just--

1052
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:15,883
he just--

1053
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:36,904
Ethan?

1054
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:40,107
Ethan!

1055
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:41,942
He-- he's dead?

1056
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:44,912
Yeah, he is dead. He just shot
himself in the fucking head.

1057
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,315
What have we done?

1058
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:50,918
Why? I just-- I don't get it.
Why?

1059
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,219
It's because of the bell, Ethan.

1060
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:53,921
It's because of the goddamn
bell.

1061
01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:57,458
No, we wanted to move something.
That was part of the plan.

1062
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:58,793
The plan?

1063
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:00,394
We killed him!

1064
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:04,899
We didn't kill him.
We-- we didn't do anything.

1065
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:07,868
Yeah, we did do something, okay?
Which means it's our fault...

1066
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:09,069
Which means we're gonna
go to fucking jail...

1067
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:10,437
For a long-ass time!

1068
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:12,540
Just shut up! Shut up
for a second, okay!

1069
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:16,343
Just let me think
for a goddamn second, okay?

1070
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:25,152
Oh, shit, Ethan, your foot.
Fuck.

1071
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:27,188
Our fingerprints are everywhere,
okay?

1072
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:29,023
They're on all the cameras. Your
fingerprints are on the bell.

1073
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:30,591
All over the house!

1074
01:20:30,593 --> 01:20:34,328
The old man killed himself,
okay? We were never here.

1075
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:39,300
Okay, so, so, you get the
cameras...

1076
01:20:39,302 --> 01:20:43,070
And I'll clean this up.

1077
01:20:43,072 --> 01:20:45,539
We're gonna be fine, yeah.

1078
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:48,142
Okay... hey!

1079
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:51,045
Sean, look at me! Hey! Hey!
Look at me!

1080
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:58,052
We're gonna be fine, okay?
Let's go. Go. Come on.

1081
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:24,478
Okay, I got the--

1082
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:28,148
oh, god.

1083
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:31,352
Oh, god.

1084
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:34,488
Sean, help me.

1085
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,323
Sean!

1086
01:21:36,325 --> 01:21:38,626
Freeze!

1087
01:21:38,628 --> 01:21:41,228
You, on the ground now.

1088
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:44,398
You, face on the floor,
hands on your head.

1089
01:22:23,706 --> 01:22:27,641
Sit up for me, please.
Come here.

1090
01:22:27,643 --> 01:22:32,246
I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry.

1091
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:37,318
Come on. Come here.

1092
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:40,254
Come on.

1093
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,722
What do i--

1094
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:47,661
okay, now, let's dance.

1095
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:23,263
Thank you.

1096
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:29,770
Oh, it feels so good to be home.

1097
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:38,245
You wanna go see? Do you
want to go see Caroline?

1098
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:42,383
Let's go see Caroline.
Come here.

1099
01:23:42,385 --> 01:23:43,484
Who's this?

1100
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:46,453
Oh, my goodness. Oh.

1101
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:54,128
He's a sweet baby.

1102
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,397
Oh, sweet baby.

1103
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:20,554
Hey.
Hey.

1104
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:24,224
I just came from your garden,
was out there, everything's
holding up great.

1105
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:26,360
How about you,
how you holding up?

1106
01:24:26,362 --> 01:24:28,395
I'm doing great.
What do you think?

1107
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:36,703
I, um, I bought you something.

1108
01:24:36,705 --> 01:24:38,105
What's in there?

1109
01:24:38,107 --> 01:24:39,339
The idea is you open it.

1110
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:40,474
Mm-hm.

1111
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:46,146
Let's see, what is it?
What is it? What is it?

1112
01:24:46,148 --> 01:24:50,284
Ah... the one
I've always wanted.

1113
01:24:50,286 --> 01:24:52,719
Now don't be a smart ass.

1114
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:55,422
I mean, this is a real antique.

1115
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,325
Look, we don't need you
yelling and screaming...

1116
01:24:58,327 --> 01:25:01,261
Wasting energy for no reason.

1117
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:04,331
Sometimes Amy and I aren't
here to hear you.

1118
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:16,743
You know, I just want you to
know that...

1119
01:25:16,745 --> 01:25:22,282
Whenever you need anything,
i mean anything at all...

1120
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:28,322
All you have to do is ring this
and I'll hear it, honey.

1121
01:25:28,324 --> 01:25:34,595
And I'll come to you,
no matter what, okay?

1122
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:46,306
Good.

1123
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:51,478
It works.

1124
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:12,826
What do you mean when you say
that this was almost inevitable?

1125
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:17,297
Harold lost himself when
Caroline died.

1126
01:27:17,299 --> 01:27:18,899
He lost everything
that made him happy.

1127
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:22,669
And twelve years is
a long time to be alone.

1128
01:27:22,671 --> 01:27:27,341
Are you implying that Harold had
suicidal tendencies?

1129
01:27:27,343 --> 01:27:32,412
What I'm saying is that
Harold was hurting.

1130
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:34,881
And he was hurting himself.

1131
01:27:34,883 --> 01:27:36,917
But I made a promise to
Caroline...

1132
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:39,853
That I would make sure he was
gonna be all right.

1133
01:27:39,855 --> 01:27:42,422
But he wasn't all right, was he?

1134
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:44,758
No. He wasn't.

1135
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,361
And that's why you went to his
home one final time...

1136
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:48,862
On September 24th?

1137
01:27:48,864 --> 01:27:50,764
Correct.

1138
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:53,500
What did you bring him that day?

1139
01:27:53,502 --> 01:27:55,736
I found a place for him to go.

1140
01:27:55,738 --> 01:28:00,007
Somewhere where he could get
proper professional care.

1141
01:28:00,009 --> 01:28:01,908
Where he wouldn't be alone.

1142
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:06,847
It took me months to try to get
him to sign the papers...

1143
01:28:06,849 --> 01:28:09,816
It got to a point where he--

1144
01:28:09,818 --> 01:28:13,420
he didn't want to talk
to me anymore.

1145
01:28:13,422 --> 01:28:14,888
Did he ever mention to you...

1146
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:18,025
Why he didn't want to receive
proper care?

1147
01:28:18,027 --> 01:28:21,561
He never wanted to leave
that house.

1148
01:28:21,563 --> 01:28:24,364
He said Caroline was there.

1149
01:28:27,836 --> 01:28:31,605
Will the defendants please rise?

1150
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:39,780
Before I issue your sentencing,
i want to remind the court...

1151
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:45,452
That in this state, we abide by
the felony murder rule...

1152
01:28:45,454 --> 01:28:50,490
Which states if a death occurs
during the commission...

1153
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:53,493
Of a felony, any felony...

1154
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:56,063
The persons responsible
for that felony...

1155
01:28:56,065 --> 01:29:00,701
Can be charged with murder,
regardless of intent.

1156
01:29:00,703 --> 01:29:04,371
Mr. Fleming, Mr. Turner...

1157
01:29:04,373 --> 01:29:07,941
Your actions, regardless
of your intentions...

1158
01:29:07,943 --> 01:29:11,411
Led to a man's death.

1159
01:29:11,413 --> 01:29:16,850
It wasn't enough that you
tormented a lonely old man...

1160
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:22,989
But then you were perverse
enough to record it.

1161
01:29:22,991 --> 01:29:28,595
Justice, in my opinion, would be
the guilt of this tragedy...

1162
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:31,865
Punishing you for the rest of
your lives.

1163
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:37,104
The law, however, can only
punish you for so long.

1164
01:29:37,106 --> 01:29:41,475
You've been found guilty of
illegal surveillance...

1165
01:29:41,477 --> 01:29:45,779
And breaking and entering,
both misdemeanors.

1166
01:29:45,781 --> 01:29:51,051
Since you are both minors
with no prior records...

1167
01:29:51,053 --> 01:29:57,391
I hereby sentence you
to two years probation.

1168
01:29:57,393 --> 01:30:02,529
500 hours community service.
That's it.
