2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,100
Mom, wake up! 

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,400
Wake up. We're on fire! 

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,800
Daddy! 

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,400
Ken, wait! What are you doing?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,800
Forget about the channel. 

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,600
There's a boat coming. 

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,400
They'll help us. 

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,000
We have to think about the kids. 

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,600
Trust me. 

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,900
I'm thinking of all of us.

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,800
Oh, dear God. 

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,800
Where's Julie? 

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,600
I thought she was with you. 

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,500
Here! Take these! 

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,800
We have to jump! 

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,000
It's stuck! 

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,100
Propeller's stuck. 

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,500
Come on...Come on! 

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,300
We have to jump. 

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,700
We'll never make it to land! 

22
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,400
Oh, no way, Jules. 

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,100
That's crazy. 

24
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,500
Would you rather burn to death?! 

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,700
Julie, don't you dare! 

26
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,500
Jules, there's sharks out there! 

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,700
We're gonna die. 

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,100
It's our only chance. 

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,600
Jules, don't. 

30
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,200
Julie, no! 

31
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,000
Julie! 

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,500
Julie, just stay still. 

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,400
Julie? 

34
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,200
Honey, don't... don't move. 

35
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Okay, just... just stay still. 

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,800
Oh, my God, Julie! 

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,500
No! 

38
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,600
Julie! 

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,600
Not a pretty sight, is it, Frank?

40
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,000
No, but it beats the show this morning.

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,700
20-year-old girl gets attacked by sharks. 

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,500
Older brother jumps in to save her.

43
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,600
Both are missing. 

44
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
I think we have a better chance 
of finding the brother.

45
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,100
What else? 

46
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,800
Parents heard an explosion. 

47
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,400
Till we get onboard and process the scene,

48
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,300
they're all we have. 

49
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,400
Ken and Laura Gannon. 

50
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Tough way to lose your kids. 

51
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,900
Gannon got himself caught on a sandbar. 

52
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,700
Take a look at that. 

53
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Frank, we got to move quick. 

54
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,600
The tide is rising and we have 
a sinking crime scene.

55
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,700
Yeah!

56
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,200
We don't get fooled again

57
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,900
Don't get fooled again

58
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,200
No, no!

59
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,200
Eric, the shark that attacked 
the young girl was a bull shark.

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,500
I think I'm covered. 

61
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,600
So I want you to be careful. 

62
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,400
Now listen to me. 

63
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,800
I want you to extend your 
search up to the channel marker.

64
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,200
Now, notice that marker is green.

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,000
That should indicate that there's 
a clear channel, shouldn't it?

66
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,200
Shouldn't be a sandbar here. 

67
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,700
That's exactly my point. 

68
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Okay, keep me posted. 

69
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,200
Please find our children. 

70
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,900
Mrs. Gannon, I've got my best diver on it. 

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
If they're out therewe'll find them, okay? 

72
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,000
What I'm gonna do is order 
a reference sample from each of you, okay?

73
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,900
We swab your cheeks. 

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,200
It's not a big deal. 

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500
You mean in case they have to identify...

76
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,900
That's right, standard procedure. 

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,300
It's okay. 

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,400
This was a smoke detector. 

79
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,600
Burn and char marks emanate 
from the galley.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,200
That's where the fire started. 

81
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,900
Ship's sinking. 

82
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
We better work fast. 

83
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,200
Found our point of origin. 

84
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,900
Pour pattern. 

85
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,800
Which indicates an accelerant. 

86
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,900
Breeze through the broken window 
acted as an oxidizer. 

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
All it needed was a spark. 

88
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,000
And you get a fire triangle. 

89
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,800
Piece of cloth and glass 
at the point of origin. 

90
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Molotov cocktail. 

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,500
Could be. 

92
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,500
What, no envelope? 

93
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,500
No time. 

94
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,100
Run and shoot, Ryan. 

95
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,400
Our crime scene's going under. 

96
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,300
Any sign of the young guy? 

97
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,300
No, because I had a little rip 
current around that sandbar,

98
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,800
must be about five knots. 

99
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,900
Okay, let's agreethat the current 
took him away from the yacht;

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,100
we follow the Gulf Stream. 

101
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
I'll have AV work on that.

102
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,500
I wanted to get this to you first.

103
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,900
That boat grounding was no accident.

104
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,700
Original anchor chain was cut, 

105
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
and whatever it's mounted to now is new.

106
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,000
Now, look at this. 

107
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,900
You see how clean it is? 

108
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,700
Not a blade of seaweed, 
hasn't been there more than a day. 

109
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,700
Eric, somebody moved that buoy.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,100
That marker meant we were in the channel.

111
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,700
I know these waters, Lieutenant. 

112
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,700
Who would do something like that? 

113
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,400
Well, that's what we're going 
to find out, Mrs. Gannon.

114
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,700
There was a ship in the area.

115
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,700
Did you get a look at it? 

116
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,000
I did. 

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,900
It was blue, 

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,800
I think, the hull, I mean. 

119
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,300
Do you remember anything else about it?

120
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,400
The ship's name. 

121
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,700
It was the Helen B. 

122
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,200
I remember because my mother's 
name was Helen.

123
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,500
I guess... 

124
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,800
I guess I'm a little confused. 

125
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,000
There was a boat in the area, 

126
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,500
and yet you steered away from it.

127
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,500
Yes. 

128
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,500
- You ignored help.
- Help?

129
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,700
That ship was a salvager. 

130
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
They prey on people like us. 

131
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,100
Ask anyone at the yacht club.

132
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,000
A couple we know accepted 
a tow from one last year.

133
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,100
Week later, they got a bill 
for half a million dollars. 

134
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,700
Well, I bet that half a million 
looks like bargain now.

135
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,400
Can I help you?

136
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,500
You're captain of the Helen B? 

137
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,000
Rex Hoby. Pleasure. 

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,300
Where's your crew today, Mr. Hoby? 

139
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,500
Sent them home. 

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But they did work earlier today, didn't they? 

141
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,100
Mr. Hoby, I have a witness that 
can place you at that sinking yacht.

142
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,900
My crew and I offered help 
to a boat in distress,

143
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,900
help which was refused. 

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,100
For which you expected 
fair compensation, right?

145
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,200
Yeah. 

146
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,800
Rules of maritime salvage. 

147
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
And it was just pure chance 
that you were there. 

148
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,200
Speak on it, Lieutenant. 

149
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,100
Here's what I think happened, Mr. Hoby. 

150
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,100
You and your crew used 
that torch and that chain

151
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,500
and moved a channel marker in 
the hopes that a yacht would run aground,

152
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,500
because that's what you do--

153
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,700
you lay in wait. 

154
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,400
Must be hundreds of us out 
there with chains like that. 

155
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,500
And a cutting torch. 

156
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,600
Part of the trade. 

157
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,000
Yes, but how many of you 
use a Molotov cocktail?

158
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,200
I was there to help this morning, Lieutenant...

159
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,800
for profit, sure, 

160
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,300
but to destroy a vessel? 

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,800
No way. 

162
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,700
That would be taking money out of my pocket.

163
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,700
But I'll tell you, though...

164
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,900
I never will forget that girl's scream. 

165
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,500
Mr. Hoby, I can imagine the sleep you're losing.

166
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,700
Anger management? 

167
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,800
Just an experiment. 

168
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,600
- You're trying to create pour patterns 
that we found on the yacht. - Yeah. 

169
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,400
You know, the whole 
Molotov cocktail thing bothered me. 

170
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm listening. 

171
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,900
Well, the pour patterns-- 

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,900
they didn't fit. 

173
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,300
Here, I'll show you. 

174
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,800
They were uniform, 

175
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,400
which means the blast emanated from a central point 
was caused by an object that was dropped straight down.

176
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,600
Was not thrown. 

177
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,200
So there was no Molotov cocktail? 

178
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,600
We're back at square one. 

179
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,800
Not exactly. 

180
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,300
I know what the accelerant is.

181
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,800
Diethylene glycol. 

182
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,000
That's cooking fuel, isn't it?

183
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,600
Mm-hmm. 

184
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,800
Explains why the fire was started in the galley.

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,700
Now we know it was by someone on the yacht.

186
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Suspect pool is very small. 

187
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,400
One of the kids or one of the parents.

188
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,900
Got the program running now, Eric.

189
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,400
Calculating the approximate time the body entered 
the water against the speed of the specific current.

190
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,200
We should be able to determine 
its approximate location. 

191
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,200
All right, now would be good. 

192
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,400
Working on it, big man. 

193
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Talk to me, Cooper. 

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,400
A little north of where I originally thought. 

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
Okay, where am I headed now? 

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,600
300 yards off Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park.

197
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,200
I just sent you the coordinates. 

198
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,700
Great work, Dan. Thanks. 

199
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,700
I appreciate it. 

200
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,400
Okay, Alexx. 

201
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,300
That's not our son. 

202
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,200
That means Luke is still out there. 

203
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,600
He's right, ma'am. 

204
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,600
We'll take it from here. 

205
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,500
If you'll excuse us. 

206
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,500
Alexx, if this is not their son,

207
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,300
who is this? 

208
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,800
I don't know who this boy is, Horatio.

209
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,800
But there's one thing I do know.

210
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,100
These are burn marks on his body.

211
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,300
Look at the char. 

212
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Which means he was on the boat.

213
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,000
It also means someone is lying.

214
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,400
Hey... 

215
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,700
any info on our John Doe from the water?

216
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,700
No soot in his lungs, 

217
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,300
no esophageal burning. 

218
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,600
He was already dead when he got 
on the Gannons' boat.

219
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,100
Look at my boy. 

220
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,800
All growed up. 

221
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,300
So, uh... 

222
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,000
what killed him? 

223
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,900
Someone shot him. 

224
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,700
Hit him right in the chest.

225
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,500
Looks like a .25. 

226
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
You think we can ID him? 

227
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,700
It may take a little work.

228
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Hmm, lucky the sharks didn't have at his hands.

229
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,200
But we're still a long way from a usable print.

230
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,600
You want me to hold or cut? 

231
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,400
I'll cut. 

232
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,100
Damn. 

233
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,000
Everything okay? 

234
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,000
My Firearms Proficiency is up. 

235
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,500
Six months goes by fast.

236
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,500
Well, you left Firearms, 

237
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,800
so it's not such a big deal, is it?

238
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,800
I like to stay current. 

239
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,000
Calleigh, did you quit because 
Hagen died in there?

240
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,400
I transferred. 

241
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,600
But, yeah, all of a sudden,
evidence isn't just evidence. 

242
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,400
What have you got? 

243
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,600
This? This is just work. 

244
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,400
Good luck on your test.

245
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,600
Thanks. 

246
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,100
- Hey.
- Hey.

247
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,300
So, now what? 

248
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,900
Well, some analysts like to use water 

249
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,600
or glycerine to reconstitute prints,

250
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,700
but, uh, too much leakage. 

251
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,200
I like tissue builder. 

252
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,400
It's time to get busy. 

253
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
No luck on AFIS. 

254
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,900
Let's check Immigration. 

255
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,600
Immigration database got a hit.

256
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Damon Loughlin. 

257
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
He's here on a student visa.

258
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,600
That doesn't explain how 
he ended up on the Gannons' boat. 

259
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,500
We were able to identify 
the young man that we found in the water.

260
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,400
You know him, don't you, Mrs. Gannon? 

261
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,900
That's Damon. 

262
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,700
He didn't look anything like that at the pier.

263
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,000
His burns are consistent with the fire.

264
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,300
He started the fire?

265
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,000
No, ma'am, 

266
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,700
he was dead before the fire.

267
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,300
He went down with the boat,

268
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,100
and the current took him out to sea.

269
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,100
I'm curious as to how you know him.

270
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,300
I think my daughter Julie was seeing him. 

271
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,300
But you're not sure. 

272
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
At their age, they don't tell their mothers much. 

273
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:31,900
Horatio? 

274
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,000
Excuse me. 

275
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,900
Yes, ma'am. 

276
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,100
Homicide ran the student visa of Damon Loughlin.

277
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,400
He's a house-sitter for a family 
by the name of Elias.

278
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
The live in Coconut Grove. 

279
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,800
Have you contacted them? 

280
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,100
They were on their yacht 
at the yacht club all weekend.

281
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
You want to guess which one? 

282
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,900
The Mayfair Yacht Club. 

283
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,800
Same as the Gannons. 

284
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,100
Okay, very good. 

285
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Talk to the Eliases, 

286
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,900
- and I'll stay with Mom.
- Okay. 

287
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,800
Mr. Elias, thank you for coming so soon. 

288
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,800
What's happened? 

289
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,300
I'm Calleigh Duquesne. 

290
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,200
This is Ryan Wolfe. 

291
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,300
We're with the Crime Lab.

292
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,300
We'd like to see Damon's room.

293
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,300
Please come on in. 

294
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Dad, what's going on?

295
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I don't know yet, Tia. 

296
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,700
Oh, my God! 

297
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,200
Is Damon okay? 

298
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,700
Uh, no, I'm afraid he's not.

299
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,800
This is a crime scene. 

300
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,400
You're going to have to stay outside.

301
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,500
I have, uh, valuables in the house.

302
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,200
Is there any way I could check on them? 

303
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,100
We'll have someone escort you in.

304
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,800
Would you take them around back, please, Officer?

305
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,300
Well, I think it's safe to say 
this is where Damon was shot.

306
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,900
The bullet was in the body, right? 

307
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,900
Right. So there might be 
a casing around here somewhere.

308
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,200
Found it. 

309
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
I'll take it to Firearms. 

310
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,400
Thank you. 

311
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay, let's go talk to Mr. Elias.

312
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,800
Mr. Elias, can we speak to you, please?

313
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,100
Anything missing? 

314
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,600
Our gold. 

315
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,100
Gold? 

316
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,800
How much? 

317
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,600
Ten million dollars... in bars. 

318
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,700
Ten million dollars in gold bars?

319
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
That is correct. 

320
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,400
I do not trust banks. 

321
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
My laptop's gone. 

322
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,100
You're going to need to write 
all of that down on this form.

323
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,200
Do you know the Gannon family? 

324
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,200
Tia used to date their son. 

325
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,900
Really? 

326
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,300
Why? 

327
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,300
Because Damon was shot here, 

328
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,700
and then, he was put on their boat.

329
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,100
Tia, why did you stop dating the Gannon boy? 

330
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,300
Luke and I just drifted apart.

331
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,700
Why? 

332
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,700
Do you think I had something to do with this?

333
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,000
Investigation's on going. 

334
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,800
We'll let you know. 

335
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,600
Thank you. 

336
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,900
You again. 

337
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,300
Just like a bad penny, huh?

338
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,400
Noticed those dive suits.

339
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,400
They weren't here this morning.

340
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,500
They dry better above deck. 

341
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,400
I also noticed the burn residue on them.

342
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,700
And your shiny new trunk.

343
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
Taking a little trip. 

344
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,300
- Packed a few things.
- Open it.

345
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,200
So here's what I think happened, Rex.

346
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,300
After the yacht sank off the sandbar, 

347
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
you unloaded the gold 

348
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
and that's where you gotthe burn residue, right? 

349
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,500
That's mine. 

350
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,100
Owner granted me salvage rights. 

351
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,900
The owner reported it stolen from his home, Rex.

352
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,400
So where did you get it? 

353
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,700
From me. 

354
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,300
Luke Gannon, alive and well. 

355
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,300
Yeah, thanks to this guy.

356
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,800
Probably had about ten minutes of fight 
left before he pulled me out of the water.

357
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,800
So he got ten million for saving your neck, huh?

358
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,900
Law of the sea: any family member 
can grant scuttle rights.

359
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,600
Besides, I had no idea it was there.

360
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
Dad headed to shore instead of 
trying to save me or Julie,

361
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,500
so I don't owe him squat. 

362
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,200
Yes, but now you owe me. 

363
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,600
Come over here. 

364
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,800
Oww... 

365
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,200
All I did was jump in and try and save my sister.

366
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,000
That's the way you wanted it to look.

367
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,700
You're wrong. 

368
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,600
Am I? 

369
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
You torched the ship; it sank; 

370
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
the salvager scuttled it; 

371
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,700
you guys split the take. 

372
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,600
Never happened. 

373
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,900
We found Damon Loughlin's body. 

374
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
That's gonna tie you to the Elias' house,

375
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,700
the kidnapping and the murder. 

376
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Why would I kill him? 

377
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,400
OK, Because he tried to prevent 
you from taking the gold.

378
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,800
Do you have any proof of that? 

379
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,900
Do not test me. 

380
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,800
Hey, making some progress on 
the glass you collected from the yacht,

381
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,400
but I still have no idea what I'm looking at.

382
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,300
This might help. 

383
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,800
I scraped a sample off the glass.

384
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,000
THC. 

385
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,300
Active ingredient in marijuana. 

386
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
It was bong filled with cooking fuel, 

387
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,000
but when someone lit up, 

388
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,100
the boat went up instead. 

389
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,800
And that makes this hole the choke.

390
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,300
You have to cover it with your finger 
to collect the smoke in the chamber.

391
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,000
Or to keep the cooking fuel from spilling out. 

392
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,100
Could give us prints. 

393
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,300
I'll get it to Delko. 

394
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah, do that. 

395
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,300
But I think I know who the owner of this bong is.

396
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,900
So I smoke a little dope. 

397
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,400
Big deal. 

398
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,500
Someone put cooking fuel in your bong, Luke. 

399
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,000
Well, that explains what happened. 

400
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
Second I saw the fire, 

401
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,500
I dropped it. 

402
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,100
My parents were asleep below deck. 

403
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,700
I sneak a bong hit before bed every night. 

404
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,000
Whoa! Mom! Dad! Fire! 

405
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Do you have any idea who'd try to burn you? 

406
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,000
Well, feel kind of bad saying this, but, uh...

407
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,000
my mom might have. 

408
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,500
You think your mom tried to do this to you? 

409
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,100
She hates the fact we're not the perfect family.

410
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,000
Got caught smoking a couple times. 

411
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,300
Dad didn't like it, but he dealt. 

412
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,000
My mom went ballistic. 

413
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,800
You think she was trying to teach you a lesson? 

414
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,700
Tough love? 

415
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,100
I wouldn't put anything past her. 

416
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,800
Anything with the bong? 

417
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,300
Well, I lifted a beauty of a print.

418
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,900
Come from the mother? 

419
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,400
Nope. 

420
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,600
In fact, didn't get a hit on any of the Gannons.

421
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,900
Maybe it wasn't just his family 
that didn't approve of his little habit.

422
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,600
Try this. We got this from his ex-girlfriend.

423
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
She handled this form. 

424
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,400
Look at this shoe right here. 

425
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,200
It looks exactly like... 

426
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,000
Tia, can I speak with you, please?

427
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,500
What's up? 

428
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,200
Just take a look. 

429
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,800
That's your print. 

430
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,900
Why'd you pour the cooking fuel in there, Tia? 

431
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,500
You know, I talked to some 
girls down at the yacht club, 

432
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,400
and they said you and Luke didn't drift apart.

433
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
So why'd you break up? 

434
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,000
You expect a guy to cheat, 

435
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,500
but this... was too weird. 

436
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,200
You're gonna have to be a 
little more specific, Tia.

437
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,200
I caught him with his sister last week.

438
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,700
With her how? 

439
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,200
In bed. Doing it. 

440
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,800
I felt sick. 

441
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,100
I knew he got high every night. 

442
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,000
I just wanted to hurt him like he hurt me.

443
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,700
Well, you sunk a yacht, 

444
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,200
and you contributed to the death of Julie Gannon.

445
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,000
And that's manslaughter. 

446
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,700
So Tia Elias caused the fire.

447
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,400
And had nothing to do with 
Damon's murder or the gold. 

448
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,300
In fact, her motive was odd, though. 

449
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Which would be what? 

450
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,000
She says she caught the Gannon 
siblings in bed together.

451
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
That's pretty deviant behavior.

452
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,700
I would agree, but there may 
be another explanation.

453
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,400
- Like what?
- Here's what I want you to do.

454
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,100
Have Eric run the Gannon family nationally.

455
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,300
For priors? Okay. 

456
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,400
I ran the family nationally. 

457
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,000
The kids each had at least five offenses.

458
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,300
Fraud, forgery, check kiting. 

459
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
These two-- they're not brother and sister at all.

460
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,100
They are not college age, either, are they? 

461
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,200
No, he's 24 and she was 23. 

462
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Run the parents. 

463
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,500
The parents. 

464
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,100
Here we go. One's clean;

465
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,600
the other one has a sheet longer 
than the kids' combined.

466
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,200
- No convictions.
- Not yet. 

467
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,200
I understand that you've been with 
your husband Kenfor only three years. 

468
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,200
My first husband passed away.

469
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,000
I went to a bereavement group and Ken was there.

470
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,000
His wife had just died of cancer.

471
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
And you were there for Ken. 

472
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,500
He was there for me, too. 

473
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:23,900
If it wasn't for him, 

474
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,700
I don't know I could have gotten by. 

475
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,900
I have some bad news for you. 

476
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,800
These are all... Ken. 

477
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
I don't understand. 

478
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,500
Are these... real? 

479
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,200
I'm afraid so. 

480
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,700
Well, what about the kids? 

481
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,300
When I first met Ken, 

482
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,200
he was so concerned about me 
getting along with his two teenagers.

483
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,000
The children are not related 
to each other or to Ken.

484
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,800
Mrs. Gannon, I don't know 

485
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,400
how to tell you this other than they 
used you to gain entry to the yacht club.

486
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,000
For the Elias' gold? 

487
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,600
Mm-hmm. 

488
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,900
I am such a fool. 

489
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,100
Mrs. Gannon, you're not a fool. 

490
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
These are pros. 

491
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,700
This is what they do for a living.

492
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
How can I go home? 

493
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,700
You can't. 

494
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,500
These are dangerous people 
with nothing left to lose. 

495
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,300
We do have one advantage. 

496
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,100
They don't know we're on to them yet.

497
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,700
You found my son. 

498
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,100
Yes, we did. 

499
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,700
Except he's not your son. 

500
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,000
Mr. Gannon, you have an arrest record 
that spans back some 15 years now. 

501
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,000
That's quite a resume. 

502
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,000
Arrests, no convictions. You through?

503
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,800
Your wife Laura mentioned that you had met 
in a bereavement class in which you stated 

504
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,800
that you'd lost a wife to cancer, 

505
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,000
but in truth, 

506
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,200
there is no wife; 

507
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,700
there was no cancer and no family.

508
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,600
So you're going to arrest me 
for lying to my wife? 

509
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,500
You used Laura to meet the Eliases,

510
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,900
sent your bogus son to date their daughter

511
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,900
so you could steal their gold. 

512
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,200
Too bad that's all you got. 

513
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,300
We're done. 

514
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,300
For now. 

515
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,600
Guy's gonna walk? 

516
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Not for long. 

517
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,500
How did Laura Gannon's 
first husband die, Frank?

518
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,400
Car accident three years ago. 

519
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,000
Why? 

520
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,200
Let's pull the file and get 
the VIN number on the vehicle.

521
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,700
Tow it in if we find it? 

522
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,600
First things first. 

523
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,700
Hey, Calleigh. 

524
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,300
Did you come by for your stuff? 

525
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,300
I got it in a box around here somewhere.

526
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,200
Oh, that's okay, Jim. 

527
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,000
I'll just have to get it some other time.

528
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,800
So what brings you by? 

529
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,800
Proficiencies. 

530
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
I'm on a deadline. 

531
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,100
That casing--is it from the Elias house? 

532
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,200
Yes. Why? 

533
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,700
Is there any reason in particular 
why you didn't collect the evidence off it?

534
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,000
It could contain DNA. 

535
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,600
Well, there is something fused to that casing.

536
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,100
I'll have to get on that. 

537
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,100
What are you doing? 

538
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,500
Horatio's got a suspect on ice.

539
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,900
He won't stay that way forever. 

540
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,400
I'm taking this to DNA. 

541
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,800
Okay, but this is my lab now. 

542
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,400
All due respect, this is my evidence. 

543
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,400
You want the results, they'll be in DNA. 

544
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,200
We discovered something at the Eliases.

545
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,200
Oh, yeah? What?

546
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,000
We found skin tissue on a shell casing 
from the Damon Loughlin shooting.

547
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Well, could be my sister's. 

548
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,800
Julie? 

549
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,000
Yeah, we went there together, me and Julie. 

550
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,200
Come on. Hurry up. 
We've got to get out of here. 

551
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,900
Don't go any further. 

552
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,000
Give it to me. 

553
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,200
Please. 

554
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,600
Julie! 

555
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,000
Except she's not your sister. 

556
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,400
And besides, it doesn't 
really matter who shot him.

557
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,100
You were both there; 

558
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,400
it's felony murder. 

559
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,400
Okay... then I wasn't there. 

560
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,800
And you can't prove that I was. 

561
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,600
Actually, I can. 

562
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,200
May I see your hands please? 

563
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,500
Excuse me? 

564
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,200
Put your hands on the table. 

565
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,400
When you went to pick up the casing,

566
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,900
you burnt your finger. 

567
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,100
We have your DNA. 

568
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,400
Julie! 

569
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,700
Ow! 

570
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,700
It's all over, Luke. 

571
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,100
I used the VIN number to find the car 
that Mrs. Gannon's first husband was killed in.

572
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,300
It's a Mercedes E55. 

573
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,600
That's a fast car. 

574
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,500
Yeah. 

575
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,300
Insurance company totaled it 
and sold it to a wholesaler. 

576
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,300
Wholesaler flipped it and sold it to a...

577
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,400
Luis Cruz. 

578
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,400
What was the cause of the accident? 

579
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,300
Excessive speed. 

580
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,100
According to witnesses,
Mrs. Gannon's late husband, 

581
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,100
a Philip Reynolds, 

582
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,300
was traveling too fast to navigate 
a turn not too far from his office.

583
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,600
Says here he may have hit 
the gas instead of the brake.

584
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,500
Ran head-on into a stone wall.

585
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,200
He was pronounced at the scene.

586
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,200
Looks like, to me,
it was just a freak accident. 

587
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,300
Or the perfect crime. 

588
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,100
Did You know Philip Reynolds, Luis? 

589
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,400
He was killed three years ago.

590
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,900
No, I don't know him. 

591
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,300
But you bought the car 
from his insurance company.

592
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,400
Yeah, so? 

593
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,600
You can't just take my car.

594
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,600
As a matter of fact, I can, Luis.

595
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,600
What is this? 

596
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,700
That document allows me 
to take possession of your vehicle.

597
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,400
- I suppose you want my license and my registra...
- Just want your keys.

598
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,000
Thank you. 

599
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:07,800
Let's go. 

600
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,300
Bingo. 

601
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:51,900
Eric. 

602
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,800
That car was definitely tampered with. 

603
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,800
This switch was part of a small assembly 
rigged to the cruise control.

604
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,900
You'd have never known it was 
there unless you looked for it.

605
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,300
It's a clever piece of work. 

606
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,700
Can we tie it to Gannon? 

607
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
I'm just getting started. 

608
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,800
Okay. Find me. 

609
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,700
H... I got it. 

610
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,700
Mr. Gannon, have a seat. 

611
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,500
And while you're at it, 

612
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,300
why don't you take a look at that.

613
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,300
An electrical device? 

614
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,500
So? 

615
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,700
So we found it in a car that 
belonged to your wife's late husband,

616
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Philip Reynolds. 

617
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
You planted it there. 

618
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,300
Fascinating. 

619
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Laura was the perfect mark, wasn't she? 

620
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
She gave you ongoing accessto the yacht club 

621
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,500
and to rich people who brag about their wealth. 

622
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,900
Yes, the yacht club. 

623
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,300
The paradise for grifters 
just like you and your kids.

624
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,900
But first you needed to get rid of the husband.

625
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,600
So you learned that he worked late each night,

626
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,200
came home around the same time. 

627
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,400
About a half a mile from 
his office there's a left turn.

628
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,900
When he got to the corner, he signaled. 

629
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,700
Turn signal activated a switch. 

630
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
That switch overrode the cruise control,

631
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,400
turning it on, 

632
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,800
closing a solenoid,
which locked the brake pedalin place. 

633
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,400
And that sent the car accelerating out of control.

634
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,900
Now you knew there was no way
he could make that curve. 

635
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,800
Nice theory. 

636
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,200
It's more than a theory. 

637
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,400
You were careful, 

638
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,900
but not careful enough. 

639
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,500
You did a good job of wiping up your handiwork. 

640
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,700
There was one print you couldn't wipe off. 

641
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
Stuck between layers of adhesive. 

642
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,100
Like a fossil. 

643
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
Preserved... 

644
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,300
for us to find. 

645
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,800
Oh. You're under arrest. 

646
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,100
Mrs. Gannon? 

647
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,000
Mrs. Gannon? 

648
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Why couldn't I see them 
for who they really were?

649
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,400
Strangers. 

650
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,100
Worse. 

651
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,200
All I wanted was family. 

652
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,800
What's wrong with me? 

653
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,200
Nothing. 

654
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,400
Family is what we all want. 

655
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
