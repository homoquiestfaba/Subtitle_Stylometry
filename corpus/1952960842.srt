was gonna explode.

this little firework thing

184
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,622
that had a little guy
on a parachute.

185
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,221
It was made of plastic,
and it blowed up.

186
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,028
But it got stuck on the tree.

187
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,160
And then I had this other one
that was like a rocket,

188
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,967
and I taped a little paper guy
to it, and he, like, burned up,

189
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:14,602
'cause I couldn't see him,
where the rocket landed.

190
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,180
But all I found where
the rocket landed

191
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:21,376
was a piece of plastic
that was the top.

192
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,818
And then we had this other one
that was about, like, this big,

193
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,117
and it spun around.

194
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,352
And it starts-and it explodes.

195
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,693
- Oh, man, it's hot outside.

196
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,034
- Yeah, it is.

197

in tennis?

I know why you left now.

724
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,051
