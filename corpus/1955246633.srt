he was carrying $9,000 in cash,

177

and a three-page letter.

178
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,900
The letter begins:

179
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,721
"I've been telling you about Nina
and nobody listens.

180
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,820
I may be a danger
to the worldview of some,

181

- Thank you.

Nah, just a little.

I had to find your name.

Get transcript of letter thing."

191
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,500

Okay. It's weird you had
an answer for that, but...

216
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,380
It's in New Jersey, off the coast.

217
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,420
It's this underwater canyon.

218
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,180
It's starts in the basin and goes out
in the ocean, like 400 miles.

219
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,460
It's as big as the Grand Canyon,
but nobody knows about it,

220
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,360
so people just abandon
things there all the time.

221
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,803

I couldn't stand to see her that way.

229
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,322
Three months later, she was dead.

230
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,580
My father told me in the front seat
of his convertible

231
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,380
after finding me in a park.

232
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,780
He was already living with his new wife
and her children,

233
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,020
somewhere in the suburbs.
He wouldn't tell me which one.

234
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,620
I lived on the streets
until an overdose put me in the hospital

235
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,927
and I became a ward of the state.

236
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,140
The day my father was found
guilty of abuse and neglect,

237
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,969
I sat beside him in court.

238
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,420
Right before my statement,
he pulled me close,

239
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,020
so it would look like he was hugging me,

240
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,220
and then he whispered in my ear,

241
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,926
'You know it's all your fault, right?

242
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,050
You killed your mother.'

243
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,060
That's what I could never explain
to the lawyers and caseworkers.

244
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,260
It wasn't about the handcuffs
or the beatings

245
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,420
or his shaving my head. That was nothing.

246
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,540
It was the constant suggestion
that I was doing something wrong,

247
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,060
that I was inherently poisonous

248
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,340
and to blame for the series of abuses
and abandonment

249
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,660
that marked my adolescence.

250
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,580

in countless, subtle

251
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,365

to kill a man, the whole thing, right?

and put them in his fancy bottle of scotch

it was less fun to have bad sex

You heat it up to 209 degrees.

350
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,129
No, I mean, what in the actual
fuck are we gonna do?

351
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,180
I don't know.

352
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:27,162
Uh, I never really had a plan
for when life shits the bed like this.

353
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,643
Do you have any sense
of how many phone calls

354
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,889
and hysterical emails I've gotten?

355
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,930
As a matter of fact, I do.
I changed my number.

356
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,810
Thanks for letting me know.

357
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,100
So here's where we are.

358
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,220
Random House is backing out
of the short story collection.

359
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,448
- (SIGHS)
- Columbia

360
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,740
wants to buy you out
of your teaching contract.

361
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,860
- Fuck them.
- Essentially,

362
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,203
everyone is on the verge of suing us.

363
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,447
The Penguin thing... that's over, too?

364
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,740
Not yet.

365
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,620
I have managed to talk them down,

366
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,340
but you have gotta work with me here.

367
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,340
Okay. All right. Just tell me how.

368
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,966
Okay. First of all,
you gotta tell me the truth.

369
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,660
- Fine. Easy.
- Everything.

370
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,580
Look, yeah, my dad isn't dead, obviously.

371
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,340
But that's it.

372
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,660
So why does Neil say that
you never lived in a group home?

373
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,100
Why does he say you were never homeless?

374
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,980
Why? Because... I don't...

375
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,082
My dad's crazy, that's why!

376
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,180
I don't know! I've been trying
to figure it out my whole life.

377
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,089
He just... He doesn't want me to be happy.

378
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,486
Do you have proof?

379
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,580
(SIGHS) What kind of proof?

380
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,330
I don't know. Records.

381
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,940
- I mean, not on me.
- Find some.

382
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,220
Quick. I believe you,
but you've gotta cover your ass.

383
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,540
Okay.

384
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,201
Next, you've got to write a...

385
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,321
press release statement like, now.

386
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,410
Next, Penguin has got to
have some pages ASAP.

387
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,485
JEN: Unless you start producing,
this all goes away.

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,402
Kill yourself, you fucking asshole!

391
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,100
- Whad'ya got?
- I already paid for that.

392
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,440

(LAUGHS)

394
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,042
Say what do you want from me.

395
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,020
I don't know.

396
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,771
I know exactly what you like, don't I?

- (GASPS)
- (LAUGHS)

398
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,820
ATTORNEY: Hi, Cori.

399
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,340
Cori, do you remember
drawing that picture?

400
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,940
Yes.

401
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,380
Why did you draw it?

402
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,820
CORI: I drew it to show what happened.

403
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,460
Hans went away for a long time,

404
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,643
and when he came back,
he had this very big bag.

405
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,020
Inside the bag there were
so many rolls of tape, like a ball,

406
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,180
and Hans took it to his car.

407
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,540
ATTORNEY: Now, in your picture,

408
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,220
the bag is zipped up.

409
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,500
Could you actually see what was in the bag

410
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,604
or were you just kind of imagining
what might be in there?

411
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,380
Imagining.

412
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,300
ATTORNEY: And who asked you to draw it?

413
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,860
CORI: The psychologist.

414
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,940
Now, did you remember the part about
your Dad carrying the bag

415
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,805
before the psychologist talked to you?

416
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,860
I'm not sure.

417
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,691
Do you have trouble with keeping things
straight sometimes, Cori?

418
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,460
Do you get a little, you know,
confused, sometimes?

419
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,020
I don't want to do this anymore.
Can I stop now?

420
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,009
Okay. Thank you, pal.

421
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,940
Did Cori always call his parents
by their first names?

422
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,460
No, I don't think so, actually.

423
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,460
It seemed at the earlier custody trial
statements he would say "my mom,"

424
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,882
but I don't know when he started
calling Hans "Hans."

425
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,140
Do you think we could get
the Family Court documents?

426
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,460
Some of them. Anything public record.

427
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,971
Can I see it?

428
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,780
All right. So this is the first one,
where Cori is calling his mother "Nina,"

429
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,300
and Hans was already called "Hans."

430
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,620
Hmmm.

431
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,380
This was three months
before she disappeared.

432
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,580
Mm-hmm.

433
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,860
Hey, can you get documents
from other states,

434
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,689
not just New York?

435
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,580
Uh, yeah. Wha... what are you thinking?

436
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,900
Illinois.

437
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,100
Yeah, sure. Why?

438
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,420
'Cause I grew up in Chicago.

439
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,885
What are you looking for?

440
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,100
(SIGHS) How about the hearing

441
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,340
where my father was convicted
of neglect and abuse

442
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,681
and I was made a ward of the state?

443
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,340
What are you gonna do with it?

444
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,204
I don't know. All my book
deals went to shit,

445
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,060
and my editor says
they're gonna stay that way

446
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,340
until I come up with some proof
that all that stuff actually happened.

447
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,649
And I have to publish it
in an important publication.

448
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,060
Like say The Times?

449
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,220
STEPHEN: I wouldn't ask you to do that.

450
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,767
LANA: Yeah, kind of just did,
but that's okay.

451
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,331
I'd love to help.

452
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,129
Does this look like
what you're looking for?

453
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,060
STEPHEN: Yeah.

454
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,540
Now the only problem is I can't write it.

455
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,260
Of course you can.
Write whatever you want.

456
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,362
No, I just can't write. I mean...

457
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,481
It just happens.
Last time it lasted six months.

458
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,980
And then what?

459
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,730
Then I started taking Adderall.

460
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,806
Okay. It's printing.

461
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,540
What if we published this as is?

462
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,900
Mm? Print it full page,

463
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,527
complete with your
handwritten annotations.

464
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,020
That's something people would notice

465
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,980
and you wouldn't have to write anything.

466
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,220
I think that you're brilliant.

467
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,900
I know.

468
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,480
(♪♪♪)

469
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,561
There's a term for what you are right now.

470
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,570
- Cunt-struck.
- Fuck you.

471
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,780
- Cunt-struck.
- That's not a word.

472
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,484
Yeah, it is.

473
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,140
It's an old word, old-timey word.

474
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,526
It's like cuntwinked.

475
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,980
Or the more politically
correct version, hoodwinked.

476
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,300
- Come on, you don't know this? Huh?
- No.

477
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,500
What's the male version?

478
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,887
- Cock hobbled.
- Shut the fuck up!

479
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,128
Come on. You gonna match
with me and you don't know that?

481
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,770
Hey. I put this on so I'd remember
to give it to you.

482
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,370
Remember this?

483
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,445
Yeah.

484
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,340
Yeah. I was going through this old box

485
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,886
and thought I'd give it back to you.

486
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,929
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

487
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,771
You sure you're ready
to part ways with that?

488
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,500
- Thought it'd make you happy.
- Yeah, it did.

489
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,045
You could give it to Jax.

490
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,300
It belonged to my grandmother.

491
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,528
- STEPHEN: Yeah, I remember.
- (BUZZER)

492
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,260
You gave it to me
the night after I overdosed.

493
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,180
Remember you said it would protect me?

494
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,520
I sure don't.

495
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,620
It meant a lot to me at the time.

496
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,722
Yeah? That's interesting.

497
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,060
'Cause I didn't give it to you, Stephen.

498
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,420
- What?
- It got stolen

499
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,460
from my jacket at a party.

500
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,580
What are you talking about?
I was in the hospital at Northwestern.

501
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,920
You snuck in to visit me.

502
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,924
Ha, doesn't matter. Forget it.

503
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,020
It matters to me.

504
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,804
(GROANS)

505
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,340
Look, you were pissed off at me
'cause I made that shitty joke

506
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,220
about your mom in the wheelchair
peeing herself, yeah?

507
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,580
- Yeah, I remember.
- Yeah, and the chain broke,

508
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,420
and I had it in my jacket pocket
and then it went missing at the party.

509
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,921
This is not how I remember it.

510
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,420
I believe that's not how you remember,

511
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,966
because you have a convenient way
of remembering things.

512
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,649
- What? We're done?
- Yeah, we're done.

513
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,420

(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)

515
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,722
Why don't you just tell me
what you're looking for, what you like?

516
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,400
Because I don't want to scare you away.

517

No.

You're the last person
I want to show my flaws to.

520
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,420
You're showing them to somebody.

(SIGHING) No, I'm not.

523
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,442
I just don't want to wonder
who else you're with.

524
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,522
Give me a chance.

525
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,731
Tie this wrist.

526
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,289
Now tie it to the bed.

527
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,366
(WHISPERING) Now tie this one.

528
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,003
Tie it really tight.

529
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,361
Like that?

530
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,840
Yeah.

531
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,491
Take one nail.

532
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,406
Run it down.

533
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,611
Slower.

534
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,840
Slow.

535
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,760
Harder.

536
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,924
Harder.

537
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,180
- (GASPS)
- Like that?

538
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,220
Yeah. (SIGHS)

539
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,685
Kiss me.

540
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,090
Well, fine, but I like the Hans idea.

541
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,740
JEN: Look, I think they have
the right to voice a concern.

542
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,180
This doesn't even resemble the book
they're paying you to write.

543
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,860
(LAUGHS) Okay, no? Fine.

544
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,780
I get that, but it's a better idea.

545
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,500
Yeah, I'm not really sure
that I can sell this, Steve.

546
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,980
Look, Norman Mailer, Truman Capote.

547
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,300
They were both at the top of their games

548
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,420
and then they got
massive writer's block, right?

549
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,020
- And then?
- Yes, and they fell into addiction.

550
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,761
Exactly. And what happens? A murder trial.

551
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,260
Truman Capote writes his masterpiece,
changes American literature.

552
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,700
Norman Mailer wins
the freaking Pulitzer Prize.

553
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,900
JEN: Oh, so Hans Reiser
is gonna win you a Pulitzer now?

554
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,220
No, I'm just... He's interesting,
that's all. It's what I want to write.

555
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,980
Alright. Fine, fine, fine. As long as
you're actually writing something.

556
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,162
I don't know. I guess we'll figure it out.

557
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,980
You're gonna have to get me some pages
if you want me to pitch this change,

558
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,220
- actual pages.
- Um, cool. You got it.

559
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,820
Yes, I promise. I promise. I promise.

560
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,300
- I promise.
- Okay.

561
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,890
Okay. Bye.

562
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,500
I made breakfast.

563
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,331
- I see that.
- Eggs Benedict.

564
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,402
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

565
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,540
It's just, um... (CLEARS THROAT)

566
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,450
This was taped to my front door.

567
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,770
Motherfucker!

568
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,540
You stay away from her.

569
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,660
If you ever hurt them, I swear to God
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

570
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,889
Oh, come on. You're so dramatic!

571
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,620
- Come on.
- No.

572
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,340
Oh! I see how it is, Tough Guy.

573
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,480
All right, you handsome motherfucker.
At least come on in.

574
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,166
Come on!

575
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,860
You want a 7-Up?

576
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,020
Hey, let's get a steak, huh? My treat.

577
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,420
- Where's Cynthia?
- She's in Florida.

578
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,980
You know how much I can't stand
the fucking silverbacks.

579
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,980
So you're just spending her money alone?

580
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,340
Yeah, she sends her love to you, too.

581
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,700
Cynthia, you know,
she had me clean out the attic.

582
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,020
I was visiting your stepsister.

583
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,380
She's going to Yale now,
did you know that?

584
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,611
And I thought I might stop by here
and see if you wanted any of this.

585
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,620
(SIGHS)

586
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,100
You came all this way to give me a box?

587
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,804
I came to see my son.

588
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,565
Why? You obviously hate me.

589
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,580
Oh, hey, now, come on! Don't say that.

590
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,580
- Why do you say that?
- 'Cause you humiliated me!

591
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,140
Congratulations, I hope you're happy.

592
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,820
I'm not happy.

593
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,500
That didn't make me happy.

594
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,940
Then why would you do that?

595
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,420
You told everyone I was dead.

596
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,740
So did you!

597
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,289
Yeah, well, I mean,
there's storytellers in this family.

598
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,220
I... I've read everything
you've ever written.

599
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,290
I've come all the way across the country
to this fancy party

600
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,286
where they're celebrating my son,
the big-shot literary genius,

601
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,660
because I'm proud of you

602
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,020
and I'm sitting there,
listening to these stories,

603
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,380
and every time, the monster father dies
a horrible death

604
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,740
and those assholes in their party clothes,
they're all happy about it.

605
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,140
How do you think that makes me feel?

606
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,820
You know what? You're not doing this.

607
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,700
You're not turning it around
to make it about you.

608
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,060
I'm not going to feel guilty
for not keeping your secrets.

609
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,740
My secrets? What about yours?

610
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,820
All right, look, here you go.

611
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,900
- What do you got?
- Here's the court hearing

612
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,740
where you were convicted
of seven counts of neglect and abuse.

613
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,460
Here's the police report
for when I was homeless,

614
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,961
'cause you were hiding with
your fucking replacement family!

615
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,660
Hiding? I looked everywhere for you.

616
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,660
You were a strung-out drug addict.

617
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,660
I roamed the streets
trying to save your life.

618
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,140
- Oh, you were gonna save me?
- Yes, save you. I had to restrain you.

619
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,322
You were trying to kill yourself.

620
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,700
(LAUGHS)
You fucking beat the shit out of me,

621
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,484
and I was too little to fight back!

622
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,620
I was grieving. I was doing my best!

623
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,660
You were grieving? As if I wasn't!

624
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,445
- As if I wasn't fucking grieving!
- You pick at the details,

625
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,580
you're missing
the entire context of this thing.

626
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,060
- (YELLING) The context?
- Yeah.

627
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,940
The context is you were
a fucking nightmare!

628
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,460
You were a nightmare!

629
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,460
You made my life a living hell!
You terrorized my family!

630
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,860
I'm your family!

631
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,860
I was your fucking family
and you fucking abandoned me!

632
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,564
That's not true!

633
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,660
You're not going anywhere. Stay there.

634
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,060
Get off of me!

635
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,525
(SCREAMS)

636
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,800
Fucker!

637
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,726
You son of a bitch!

638
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,887
Roger! Get the fuck off me!

639
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,700
I didn't abandon you.

640
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,041
You left home, for God's sake!

641
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,100
You know what? You're right.

642
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,740
You have another family to take care of.

643
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,700
My father is dead. I'm a fucking orphan.

644
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,450
- You don't mean that!
- Yes, I do!

645
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,060
You don't know what
you're saying right now.

646
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,060
You're a pathetic old man and you're
gonna die miserable and alone,

647
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,400
and you fucking deserve it!

648
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,620
Stephen! Stephen!

649
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,960
(STARTING MOTORCYCLE)

650
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,820
Stephen, come back here!

651
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,922
(MOTORCYCLE DRIVING AWAY)

652
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,611
(GROANS)

653
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,246
(WINCING)

654
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,340
All at once or slow?

655
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,124
- Mm?
- Slow.

656
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,140
(SCREAMS)

657
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,900
Fuck!

658
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,240
ATTORNEY: What did you mean

659
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,490
when you told Dr. Shapiro that Nina
wanted Cori to be sick?

660
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,340
She was... inventing illnesses for Cori,

661
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,420
to make him go through all these
unnecessary medical procedures,

662
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,740
giving him medications
that were making him sick.

663
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,700
She was poisoning my son.

664
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,300
She didn't like him
on some deep, conflicted level.

665
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,528
I know people don't want to hear that.

666
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,680
I mean, they can't believe that a parent
would actually hurt a child.

667
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,980
It happens all the time.

668
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,620
The court system, I mean,

669
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,202
it just makes things
so much worse for the children.

670
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,660
We're taught to believe that the system

671
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,740
will actually help the child,

672
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,940
that it'll do the right thing,

673
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,169
but it doesn't always.

674
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,330
Sometimes it does the opposite.

675
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,566
I was betrayed and abandoned

676
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,300
by the people that I was
supposed to trust blindly.

677
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,041
When I fought back, they called me a liar.

678
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,290
No one tells you what
you're supposed to do then.

679
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,563
When you're all alone,

680
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,260
you have to take matters
into your own hands.

681
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,180
If you understand that,
you understand everything.

682
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,568
I always tried to do the right thing...

683
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,320
Even if it was an impossible decision.

684
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,560
(GROANING)

685
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,730
Hey.

686
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,740
You okay?

687
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,491
(SIGHING) Yeah.

688
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,900
What is that?

689
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,527
It's Adderall, Klonopin, Vicodin.

690
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,970
Can I have one?

691
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,808
(♪♪♪)

692
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,091
LANA: I hate feeling trapped.

693
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,367
STEPHEN: I'd never want to trap you.

694
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,571
You can tell me whatever you want.

695
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,643

Here?

00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,004
Harder. Harder.

713
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,180
You can't go harder?

- Like that?
- Yeah.

Okay. Now I want you
to press as hard as you can.

720

It's okay. Just let it out.

I want you to take it out.

with your publisher,

00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,100
maybe you remember them.

755
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,180
We waited three hours... for you.

756
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,820
Um, the bottom line is,

757
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,940
Penguin does not want this true crime
bullshit, like I told you,

758
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,380
and they're pulling out
of the original project, too.

759
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,180
- Oh, fuck!
- You have seven days

760
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,660
to return the advance, and there's
nothing else I can do.

761

- Fuck!
- And you need a new editor

762

because you no longer have one.

763
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,300

to get your shit together.

the other day at the hospital,

all my fault? All this?

- I thought the whole point

of the Hans thing, of the trial,
of all that

810
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,860
was so that you could write
about something different.

811
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,580
So what? Back to me.

812
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,980
You know what he fucking said?

813
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,380
I didn't have the right context.

814
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,960
The right fucking context?

815
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,620

- Terrorized!
- Terrorized is a bad word.

word that describes it?

I've, I've thought about it.

820

I don't have a good feeling about it.

821
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,020

Are you serious? How?

823
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,660
Because they saw us
so out of control all the time.

- We weren't out of control.
- Yeah, we were.

When you totaled his Mustang
in front of the kids.

829
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,060
Now that had to be terrifying for them.

830
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,140
Are you seriously trying to
make me feel bad about that?

shittiest father ever, right?

new perspective, if you want to,

834
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,340
from an adult perspective,
like a real adult.

00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,860
A real adult, like Roger?
That would be better?

836
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,291
I didn't say it would be better.

837
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,620
- Oh.
- I didn't say that.

838
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,700
What did you say?
That we both started in the same place

839
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,180
and I ended up here and you ended up...

840
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,140
what, getting everything good?

my family anymore either.

coming around them no more.

she had never loved me.

868
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:31,408
That she only married me to escape Russia.

00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,086
...and I crushed it until
I felt her throat collapse.

871
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,900
That was it.

872
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,180
All the anger, all the hatred.

873
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,806
There was just silence.

874
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,060
Lana, can I talk to you?

875
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,020
Hey.

876
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,600
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Don't touch me!

877
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,964
Can I please just... Please?

878
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,340
Talk to Roger
if you need someone to talk to.

879
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,620
Well, he's not answering my calls either.

880
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,140
Please? I feel like I'm about
to go underwater, okay?

881
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,130
Can I just... please talk to you...

882
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,402
Please?

883
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,340
You're the only person that's made me
feel okay about myself

884
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,808
in my entire adult life
and I feel like I know you.

885
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,646
From the first second
I met you, I felt that.

886
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,020
I know it feels that way,

887
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,260
- but maybe that's not a good thing.
- Why?

888
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,931
Because you're gonna
take me down with you.

889
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,860
It's just who you are.

890
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,486
Look, I'm fucked up, okay?

891
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,820
- Come on!
- You knew that!

892
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,580
Is that gonna be your excuse
for the rest of your life?

893
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,580
That you're too broken not
to be completely selfish?

894
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,966
Grow some fucking balls!

895
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,060
At least I'm not pretending
nothing's wrong with me.

896
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,700
(SIGHS) Oh, you're pretending plenty.

897
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,370
You just don't see it.

898
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,820
Here's those papers you wanted.

899
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,002
They're pretty enlightening.

900
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,886
Fuck.

901
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,260
NEIL ON TV: There we go.
Okay, you ready for a ride?

902
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,600
Hop on my back.

903
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,610
Come on, man.
See if you can stay on. You ready?

904
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,740
You gotta hold on.
Put your legs around me.

905
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,700
- Hold tight. Ready?
- Yeah!

906
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,883
NEIL: Yeah? (LAUGHING)

907
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,900
You're the one who should be
in front of the camera.

908
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,764
What are you doing, hiding back there?

909
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,162
There she is, ladies and gentlemen,

910
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,340
the most beautiful woman in the world.

911
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,046
- Just like out of a fairytale.
- Aw, stop.

912
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,525
Do you remember her like that?

913
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,765
Not much.

914
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,380
NEIL: She really was the most
beautiful woman I ever saw.

915
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,720
Wave to Daddy.

916
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,640
I was your age then,
right before we went to Chicago,

917
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,460
and when she died...

918
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,460
(BLOWING NOSE)

919
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,689
Man, I was so confused,
I couldn't stop screaming.

920
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,165
Yeah, I remember.

921
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,580
You want coffee?

922
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,500
- What?
- Coffee.

923
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,841
No! Wh... what the fuck are you doing?

924
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,860
- Just waiting.
- No.

925
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,180
Dad, you broke into my house.

926
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,930
What the fuck?

927
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:40,500
Well, I wanted to give you something.

928
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,490
Jesus. I can't... I can't deal
with this right now.

929
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,201
I'm trying to apologize to you...

930
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,300
...before it's too late.

931
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,140
What does that mean?

932
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,780
I had a bunch of tests done.

933
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,060
I'm dying.

934
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,685
Don't fucking lie to me!

935
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,320
Will you just fucking listen to me?

936
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,283
I'm a sick man.

937
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,100
I wanted to come see you,
make amends with my son.

938
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,620
- Amends?
- Yeah.

939
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,131
What amends are you making?

940
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,260
(WRY LAUGH) You're such a martyr.

941
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:16,580
God, you always have been.
What kid is like that?

942
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,060
Think the world owes you something.

943
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,060
- Look, Dad, I'm exhausted.
- You're exhausted?

944
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,020
A lot of people look at your life
and think it would be pretty good.

945
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,260
You know? The New York Times
reviews, pretty girls,

946
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,340
everybody kissing your ass
to be around a hot shit writer.

947
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,460
Well, I can kiss all that good-bye
'cause everything good in my life

948
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,940
just disappeared as soon as you showed up!

949
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,520
You wanna blame me? That's easy.

950
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,900
And what are all the good things
in your life that fell apart?

951
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,220
What do they all have in common?

952
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,820
- Here we go!
- Yeah, you!

953
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,860
I mean, you're a fucking curse.

954
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,180
You're poison.

955
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,487
You know, everything you touch,
you fuck up.

956
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,601
Just get out of my house!

957
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,410
All right.

958
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,220
- Look, I made this for you.
- Get out!

959
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,846
- Just promise me that you'll look at it.
- Get out!

960
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,900
- You just need to see for yourself.
- Get out of my house!

961
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,420
I will get out of your house, but you
just see for yourself, all right?

962
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,330
- You have to hear me out.
- I don't fucking have to look at it!

963
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,570
You fucking hit your father.

964
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,020
- What, you wanna fight me, boy?
- I won't fucking fight an old man!

965
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,361
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to? I'll ruin you!

966
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,763
Come on. Huh? Come on! Fucking pussy.

967
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,700
Huh? You fucking faggot!

968
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,930
Huh? You waste of a life! Come on, hit me!

969
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,620
You wanna kill me so bad,
hit me! Come on! Hit me!

970
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,420
I deserve it! Come on! Hit me, hit me!

971
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,220
(YELLING) Hit me! Hit me! Come on!

972
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,651
Hit me!

973
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,926
Oh, fuck!

974
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,620
- Fuck you!
- Call 911.

975
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,180
Oh, fuck you! I'm not fucking buying it!

all right, all right....

I'm a terrible father...

980
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,121

(MACHINE BEEPING)

983
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,620
Hi, Stephen.

984
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,100
I... I don't know
if I'm ever gonna, you know,

985
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:01,180
get a chance to see you again,
and even if I do,

986
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,700
we were never so good
at communicating, so...

987
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,020
Well, there are some things
I wanna tell you, so...

988
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:10,140
that's why I'm doing this.

989
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,620
You know, that story you tell

990
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:16,580
about the time I shaved your head
and I restrained you,

991
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,923
was actually two different times.

992
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:25,300
The first time,
you were squatting at the house.

993
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,660
It had been empty for a year,

994
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,970
and I needed that money so badly.

995
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,900
I finally found a buyer,

996
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,060
and I had to show the house once more
before the deal closed.

997
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:44,420
I got there, and you trashed the place.

998
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,444
Thousands of dollars in damage,

999
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:52,660
and I was so angry that
I hit you and I cut your hair.

1000
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:57,460
You know, afterwards you were
crying in the bathtub.

1001
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,403
It was really horrible.

1002
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,282
The second time...

1003
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,380
...I did it to try to stop you
from killing yourself.

1004
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,900
You were living on the street

1005
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,300
and I came upon you
sitting outside the arcade,

1006
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,900
and I asked you what was up, you know,
what your plans were,

1007
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,401
and you said, "Well, I guess,
I'll just commit suicide."

1008
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,740
I had to go to work,

1009
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,220
and I didn't know what the hell to do.

1010
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,449
I took you back to the empty house
and then you really got out of control.

1011
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,340
You know, you were trying
to cut your wrists open,

1012
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,660
so I... I handcuffed you
to this radiator pipe

1013
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,660
while I tried to, you know,
reach my own decision

1014
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:49,448
whether to call the cops
or if that would put you in jail.

1015
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,500
30 minutes later, I came back to check
on you and you were hanging there,

1016
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,340
passed out in a puddle of blood
at your feet,

1017
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,780
and I thought you were dead.

1018
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,930
It was like a bolt of lightning
hit my heart.

1019
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:13,807
I just couldn't bear the thought
of living knowing what I'd done to you.

1020
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:23,042
Part of me... I don't think
ever came back from that moment.

1021
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,940
I took the handcuffs off you and I said,

1022
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,407
"You do whatever you wanna do, son."

1023
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,926
You didn't want anything to do with me.

1024
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,530
I can't blame you for that.

1025
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:42,131
I keep trying to apologize to you,

1026
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,641
but it all goes wrong.

1027
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,766
Maybe there just isn't a way to make
amends for something like this.

1028
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,980
And not that it matters,
but honestly, I...

1029
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,447
I only ever tried to do right by you.

1030
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,121
I'm a broken man,

1031
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,620
and I just...

1032
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,722

01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:56,380
Look, I knew I wasn't
gonna get away with it.

1041
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,540
I mean, I looked guilty,

1042
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,940
I am guilty,

1043
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:07,843
but a father does what he has to do
in order to protect his children.

1044
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,820
Okay. Um...

1045
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,940
If you knew that you weren't
going for innocence,

1046
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,580
then why didn't you just plead guilty
in the beginning and get a deal?

1047
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,500
I mean, I heard DuBois
made a deal for seven years

1048
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,170
because the DA didn't wanna go to court.

1049
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,740
But who would've cared?

1050
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,340
I had the most publicized trial in years.

1051
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:30,460
Would you be interested in following the
story of a murderer who took a plea bargain?

1052
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,211
But I thought you said
you did it for your children.

1053
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,820
I did. Everything I've ever done
was for them.

1054
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,891
But you insured that
you would never see them again.

1055
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,968
I mean, they're not gonna have a father.
I don't...

1056
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,248
I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you.

1057
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,820

Just the truth's a motherfucker.

1062
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,610

1065
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,500
So you wrote all that in two days?

1066
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,331
Yeah, I mean, I put it
down on paper in two days, but...

1067
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,500
I mean, this is the book that I've...
I've been wanting to write.

1068
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,286
I just didn't know that until...
until now.

1069
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,900
So let's find you a publisher.

1070

It's not going to be Penguin, but...

1071
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,370
I've got a friend at Grey Wolf
I think would be into this idea.

1072
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:41,811
It won't be a big advance,
but something to get us back on track.

1073
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,371
Us?

1074
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,609

That was your decaf.

You can have my coffee, if you want.

1081
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,260
I also brought you some blueberries.

1082
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,887
So many gifts and so few actual apologies.

1083
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,286
I don't know where to start.

1084
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,725
Start with the hydrangeas.

1085
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,260
And for the record... no.

1086
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:49,091
It's not my life's plan
to be watering these things...

1087
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:54,323
feed them bone meal so they stay blue.

I'd be doing all of this.

1091
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,685
Sorry, Roger.

You never gave me any grief
about that, not once.

You kept showing up for me, so...

from this over a few words.

- Oh, great!

I was 14.

1117
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,761
You let me drive out to Warren Park
in the '69 Mustang.

1118
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,980
I loved that car.

1119

in Warren Park, in the parking lot.

and you were a terrible driver.

Fine. Then we'll just go.

1130
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,780
We'll agree not to talk.
It doesn't matter.

1131

None of it matters.
