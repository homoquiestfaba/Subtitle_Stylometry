the nervous groom to be.

100
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:02,499
- Hi, how are you?

101
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:04,335
- The least I can do is get your bags.

102
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:05,169
- Thanks.

103
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:09,107

- I think Mom and Dad would have liked him.

106
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:15,014
- You know a young Irish lad,

107
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,717
went to Notre Dame and almost became a priest.

108
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,653
Honey, their socks would roll up and down.

00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,154
(laughing)

110
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,925
No, trust me, no, they'd have liked him all right.

111
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:28,029
Come on, let's go get you married.

112
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:30,833
- [Jimmy] Your life is mine.

113
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,700
My life is yours.

114
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,870
And life is what it's all about.

115
00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:38,608
And when we get what we deserve,

116
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:42,413
life is hard to figure out.

117
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:47,251
But things are always not the same

118
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,088
and who we are is not to blame.

119
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,594
And if one day we end up dead,

120
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:58,531
Mother, cover up my head.

121
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,669
- Come on Jimmy, we're running behind.

122
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:08,543
They'll follow this road along the promenade.

123
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:10,478
- Liam, you'll be here.

124
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:12,615
- No, not me.

125
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:14,050
Send Sinead there.

126
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,785
- We don't want them doubting us before we get set up.

127
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:17,653
- And what about here?

128
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:19,389
The motorcade's passing right in front there.

129
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,525
If you want someone over there send Sinead.

130
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:27,198
- OK.

131
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:30,669
Right, when the car reaches this point we set off.

132
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:34,740
Sinead, are you certain his wife and kids won't be along?

133
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,176
- It's been confirmed.

134
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:39,045
- Why don't we set it up over here

135
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,480
on the side of the road?

136
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,149
- There's too many people there.

137
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:43,851
- Exactly, what do you think I'm talking about?

138
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:46,020
- We're only interested in the royal, Liam.

139
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,021
- What, are you stupid?

140
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:48,423
More bodies means more press.

141
00:06:48,423 --> 00:06:50,258
Better for the movement.

142
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:51,793
Jimmy, why the fuck is she talking?

143
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:52,961
She's got no say about this.

144
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:54,263
- Wrong, sonny.

145
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,605
You've got a lot to learn.

146
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,574
The movement doesn't gain support

147
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:05,877
by blowing up innocent women and children.

148
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:08,880
Our brothers in the states are quite sentimental

149
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,151
about the weak and the defenseless being victimized.

150
00:07:14,286 --> 00:07:15,154
You follow?

151
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:24,832
(thudding)

152
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:29,237
(door slamming)

153
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,409
- Gerry, Liam's in on this with us isn't he?

154
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:34,643
- I'll have no talk of that.

155
00:07:34,643 --> 00:07:36,646
He's as part of this movement as you and I.

156
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:37,447
You have something to say to him

157
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:39,549
you say it to his face.

158
00:07:39,549 --> 00:07:40,817
- Jesus, sorry.

159
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:47,258
(door closing)

160
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,829
- He's as good ever I was, maybe better.

161
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:53,633
- Aye, and that's just what worries me.

162
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,706
(dogs barking)

163
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:03,377
- Don't you ever question me like that

164
00:08:03,377 --> 00:08:05,780
in from of Gerry again, you hear?

165
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,614
- OK.

166
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:09,384
We'll have to sort this out together.

167
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,560
You know maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

168
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:25,069
Maybe you can see things a bit differently.

169
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,472
- What are you talking about?

170
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:33,512
- How come you don't have a girlfriend, Liam?

171
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,317
- I have to stay focused.

172
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:47,996
(kissing)

173
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:49,231
(Liam breathing heavily)

174
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:51,666
- What's wrong, are you a virgin?

175
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,001
(Liam chuckling)

176
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:56,172
You haven't done this before have you?

177
00:08:59,142 --> 00:09:00,711
(laughing)

178
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:01,945
What's wrong, Liam?

179
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:04,114
Are you afraid of women?

180
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:06,851
(dramatic music)

181
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:13,359
- You're gonna get yours, you bitch.

182
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,569
(light jazz music)

183
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:23,871
- Buy me a drink, soldier?

184
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:30,279
- Mind if take your wee sister on the road to damnation?

185
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,680
- As long as you take a map.

186
00:09:36,753 --> 00:09:37,987
- Something brewing there?

187
00:09:37,987 --> 00:09:39,088
- Brewing?

188
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:40,990
It's bloody fermented.

189
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,660
He's loved her since she was six.

190
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:49,701
- What are you thinking?

191
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:50,936
What's that?

192
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:52,771
I'm not real strong on body language.

193
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:56,609
- Liam, haven't seen him all night.

194
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,744
He left upset.

195
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:01,715
I worry, you know.

196
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:04,151
- You can't be his protector forever, Gerry.

197
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:05,152
If you don't take him away from your tit,

198
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:06,788
he's never gonna grow up is he?

199
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:10,291
- Cheers.

200
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,094
(glasses clinking)

201
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:12,928
- Tits.

202
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:18,868
- Will you come by later?

203
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,204
- Can't.

204
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:24,942
Not now, Mary, just isn't right.

205
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:29,146
- What isn't?

206
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:32,417
- Not when I have another woman's photograph on my bedstead.

207
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,819
Sorry.

208
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:36,789
(light blues music)

209
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:43,731
- Gerry, Fiona's wake is long past.

210
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:47,001
The mourning period is over.

211
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:00,183
(glasses clinking)

212
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:01,852
(knocking)

213
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:04,388
- McMann was just in here with a fifth of Bushmill.

214
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:05,523
I haven't seen him since.

215
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:08,493
Use the alleyway.

216
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:09,694
Everybody else does.

217
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:10,628
- Seems good to me.

218
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:19,139
(unzipping)

219
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:20,507
(trickling)

220
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:22,509
- Hey Ger, watch your shoes will ya?

221
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,245
Here, here.

222
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:26,547
That's a good girl.

223
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:29,851
You like that?

224
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:31,453
That's a good girl.

225
00:11:34,723 --> 00:11:37,226
- I see your taste in females is improving.

226
00:11:38,428 --> 00:11:40,029
- She's so little.

227
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:42,299
Don't think her mom's even weened her yet.

228
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:43,400
Last, I think.

229
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,201
Oh, yeah.

230
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:46,637
- Come inside for a while.

231
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:49,974
- Don't think so, big brother.

232
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,409
Have to keep the temple pure.

233
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,647
- Thought your friend could use some company.

234
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,487
- Thanks very much, Gerry boy.

235
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,356
(meowing)

236
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:03,590
But I don't quite fit in.

237
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,528
(meowing)

238
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,767
- Got an early start in the morning.

239
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,502
- Then you best be getting on home.

240
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,971
Wouldn't want you to be fatigued tomorrow.

241
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:16,905
And pull a muscle.

242
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:18,975
- Right.

243
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:25,049
- That's a little girl.

244
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:26,417
Where you going?

245
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:30,789
Where you going little girl, huh?

246
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:33,625
(accordion music)

247
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:38,064
(chattering)

248
00:12:52,113 --> 00:12:53,649
- So, what did you think?

249
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,618
- Oh, you look beautiful.

250
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:57,686
Hey, what are we, crazy?

251
00:12:57,686 --> 00:12:58,788
Ice cream in the winter?

252
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:00,690
- Oh, it's freezing.

253
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,525
Thanks.

254
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,580
- So, Connel, your family live around here?

255
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,848
- Uh huh.

256
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:22,849
Cousins, brothers, sisters, the lot.

257
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:24,285
- And your folks?

258
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:26,253
- Connel's parents were killed in the travels

259
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:28,289
a few years back, a bomb.

260
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:29,925
- Yeah, stupid bloody war.

261
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:31,626
- Sorry.

262
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,600
(ominous music)

263
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,769
(beeping)

264
00:13:42,005 --> 00:13:44,108
(laughing)

265
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:45,275
- Oh.

266
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:46,877
(laughing)

267
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:48,746
- Oh, I wanted that, too.

268
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:51,015
- I'll get you another one.

269
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,453
- Almost there, get ready.

270
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:01,228
Sinead.

271
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:02,062
Sinead.

272
00:14:04,564 --> 00:14:06,467
- Jesus, Ger, I swear.

273
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,035
- I said no children.

274
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:09,270
- This doesn't change anything.

275
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,838
We do it.

276
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:11,840
- What the hell?

277
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,475
No.

278
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:15,744
- There you go, no chocolate.

279
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:17,313
- Thanks.

280
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:18,314
Hey, who is that?

281
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:19,148
Look, honey.

282
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,518
- What's all this?

283
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:22,418
- Visiting.

284
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:23,420
Most likely a Brit.

285
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,623
- Give it to me.

286
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:27,558
- This is my time. - No.

287
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:30,095
- Where'd you guys go?

288
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:31,429
Kelly?

289
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:32,464
- John.

290
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:33,298
Over here.

291
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:37,069
- Stupid, give it to me.

292
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:38,137
- Leave it alone.

293
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:41,708
- You stupid bastard.

294
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:45,312
I should have stood on your crypt when I had a chance.

295
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:48,349
(ominous music)

296
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:50,785
(gun firing)

297
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,367
- Gun.

298
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:05,536
There's a gun.

299
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:08,205
Hold it.

300
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,674
Sniper.

301
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:10,741
- What are you doing, are you mad?

302
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:11,677
- Sniper, there.

303
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,079
- Go.

304
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:15,747
Back.

305
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:27,428
(gun firing)

306
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:28,696
- [John] That's who I am.

307
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,536
- Let's go. - All right, ladies and gents,

308
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:35,538
get back in your cars.

309
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:36,539
There's nothing to see here.

310
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:37,773
Let's go, lad.

311
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:39,308
Keep it moving, let's go, let's go, let's go,

312
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:42,079
get back in your cars, start 'em up.

313
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,187
(gun shooting)

314
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:22,058
(ethereal music)

315
00:16:25,729 --> 00:16:27,931
- I guess you can take the boy out of the CIA,

316
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:30,468
but you can't take the CIA out of the boy.

317
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,370
- No more smart ass comments.

318
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:50,525
(tense music)

319
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:51,426
- It's my turn.

320
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,030
(beeping)

321
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:00,036
(exploding)

322
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:02,172
(yelling)

323
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:06,944
(laughing)

324
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,380
(chattering)

325
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:25,733
(sirens blaring)

326
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:28,168
(chattering)

327
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:41,551
(accordion music)

328
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:01,241
- Got one live one.

329
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:11,085
(chattering)

330
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:52,366
(TV chattering)

331
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,572
- [Announcer] Police have arrested splinter group

332
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:59,242
leader Gerry Fallon, who was critically wounded

333
00:18:59,242 --> 00:19:00,910
in the foray.

334
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,413
Two additional members of the group are dead.

335
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:06,350
Officers are searching the area for additional suspects.

336
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:10,721
- Tried to stop him.

337
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:11,656
He went mad.

338
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:13,525
- Sit down.

339
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:17,196
- Tell us exactly what happened.

340
00:19:18,564 --> 00:19:21,033
(sirens blaring)

341
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:22,235
- I want all.

342
00:19:22,235 --> 00:19:23,804
More preps in ready in five minutes,

343
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:25,305
we're gonna lose this man.

344
00:19:25,305 --> 00:19:27,174
Five units of multi plasma stat, move.

345
00:19:27,174 --> 00:19:30,545
- Not with the woman and kid in the car.

346
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:34,249
Back for the movement, but, he wouldn't listen.

347
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:35,818
You know his temper.

348
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,154
And then.

349
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:42,158
Sinead started firing back at him.

350
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,029
I managed to run out of the room without being hit.

351
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:48,833
And then I come back in the room, dead.

352
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:54,172
He's dead.

353
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:56,708
Me own brother.

354
00:19:57,776 --> 00:19:59,879
(crying)

355
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:01,881
Where's me brother?

356
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:03,483
- Easy, son.

357
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:04,651
Go easy.

358
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:06,020
- Excuse me.

359
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,588
Just got word from hospital.

360
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:10,391
Gerry's been shot up bad, but he's still alive.

361
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:14,696
- Then it's in God's hands now.

362
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:30,815
- [Judge] Gerald Anthony Fallon.

363
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:32,617
You have been found guilty on 12 counts

364
00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:34,118
of murder in the first degree.

365
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:37,556
This is one of the most heinous and cowardly acts

366
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:40,159
of brutality I have encountered in my 15 years

367
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,028
serving Her Majesty's court.

368
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:47,535
For said acts, I sentence you to serve life imprisonment.

369
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:50,037
With my recommendation there should be no parole.

370
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:53,642
And may God have mercy on your miserable soul.

371
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:57,646
(chattering)

372
00:20:57,646 --> 00:21:01,184
- Mary, wait, you can't go in there.

373
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:04,320
- Just who the hell do you think you are,

374
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,789
you conniving little bastard?

375
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:06,991
You owe me some answers.

376
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:10,461
- I don't know what answers you're talking about.

377
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:12,397
O'Dey, do you mind?

378
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,231
This is personal.

379
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:17,903
Listen, here, you stupid bitch.

380
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,905
Don't you ever come in here and talk to me like that

381
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:20,940
in front of my men.

382
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,408
- My, my.

383
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:25,312
You are full of self importance, aren't ya?

384
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:27,180
Don't forget, little Liam, I know you.

385
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,983
You're a lying, vicious cheat who's happy

386
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:30,451
to let his brother serve life up in that

387
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:32,620
stinking hole for something I know you did.

388
00:21:35,357 --> 00:21:36,859
You'll get what's coming to you.

389
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:37,693
- Get out.

390
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:40,796
- You haven't heard the last of me.

391
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:42,465
- I know where you and yours live.

392
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:46,236
(smashing)

393
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:55,414
(squawking)

394
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,582
- [Gerry] I know that it may seem hard, Mary,

395
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,719
but I really think it's for the best.

396
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,187
It may seem selfish to you,

397
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,322
but I couldn't handle it if you were to keep on visiting me.

398
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,026
I know what a fool I've been in letting you slip away.

399
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:09,463
I have a long time to think about these things.

400
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:12,333
And God knows, I have enough demons of guilt on my head.

401
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:16,404
If you feel as strongly for me as I do for you,

402
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:18,174
give me the peace of letting me go.

403
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:21,077
All my love, Gerry.

404
00:22:23,547 --> 00:22:26,316
(ethereal music)

405
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,129
- [Reporter] It is said the United States may offer to act

406
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:39,631
as an intermediary in peace talks.

407
00:22:39,631 --> 00:22:42,068
There is concern as to whether loyalists or republican

408
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:44,671
paramilitary's will agree to a temporary ceasefire

409
00:22:44,671 --> 00:22:46,773
prior to the talks.

410
00:22:46,773 --> 00:22:49,477
Sources from both sides are optimistic that these talks

411
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:51,946
may finally lead to the building blocks of peace.

412
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:55,684
- Never lasts, girl. - Maryland senator

413
00:22:55,684 --> 00:22:57,152
Peter Roberts--

414
00:22:57,152 --> 00:22:58,888
- Never lasts. - --expressed grave concerns

415
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:01,824
about whether the republicans were willing to end the fight.

416
00:23:01,824 --> 00:23:04,660
(classical music)

417
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:09,700
- [Reporter] This bulletin just in from the BBC's

418
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,369
Ireland news desk.

419
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:14,239
Peace talks are now underway between the British government

420
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:16,374
and (foreign language spoken), the political wing

421
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:19,278
of the Irish Republican Army, said to be brokered

422
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:21,013
by the US secretary of.

423
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,124
- This way.

424
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:31,058
- Be quiet.

425
00:23:32,226 --> 00:23:33,161
(chattering)

426
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,228
- Quiet down.

427
00:23:35,264 --> 00:23:36,732
Now everybody just stay calm.

428
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:41,204
I've just spoken with our political representative.

429
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:43,973
He says the process is for real.

430
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:46,442
And they expect it to stay real for some time.

431
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:50,281
I, for one, am glad to see it quiet down for a while.

432
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:55,086
The older you get, the more the fighting spirit

433
00:23:55,086 --> 00:23:56,354
gets taken from you.

434
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:00,960
I want all unit commanders to assemble their men,

435
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,597
collect their weapons, and turn them into us by 0900.

436
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:07,000
This war stops now.

437
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:11,873
- Well, you said one thing right, John Feeney.

438
00:24:11,873 --> 00:24:14,209
You are an old withered bastard.

439
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:15,476
Because only an old withered bastard like yourself

440
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:17,379
would buy into this kind of bullshit.

441
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:19,148
- Not my decision, Liam.

442
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:21,217
Orders from upstairs.

443
00:24:21,217 --> 00:24:24,387
As a soldier, I do what I'm told.

444
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:27,224
- Well, your upstairs is getting old, too.

445
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:29,827
And a good leader knows that there's a time to obey orders

446
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:32,763
and a time to stand for what he believes in.

447
00:24:33,698 --> 00:24:35,267
What do you believe in, John?

448
00:24:38,837 --> 00:24:40,439
- I believe that you're much younger and much stronger

449
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,774
than I am.

450
00:24:43,142 --> 00:24:45,945
And if you don't get down off your high horse,

451
00:24:45,945 --> 00:24:48,315
I'm gonna knock your bollocks into your throat,

452
00:24:48,315 --> 00:24:51,218
and send you packing home in shit kick nappies.

453
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:56,791
There was a time when I could have had you shot,

454
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:59,395
skinned, and stuffed like a Christmas goose, son.

455
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:01,998
Don't think I still won't.

456
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:09,873
- Come on, lads.

457
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,578
(chattering)

458
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:18,784
- You all agree with me, then?

459
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:19,885
We have to act fast.

460
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:20,953
I mean tonight.

461
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,156
- Yeah. - You know the place.

462
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:24,591
And boys.

463
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:26,026
Come prepared.

464
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,093
It's our fight now.

465
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:28,996
Let's go.

466
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:33,334
(chattering)

467
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,938
(dialing)

468
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:41,110
- What's all this then?

469
00:25:42,178 --> 00:25:44,180
You know I exercise alone.

470
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,850
- Somebody decided you need to make more friends, Gerry.

471
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,918
Consider it a social.

472
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,022
(tense music)

473
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:10,043
- That's him, planted the bomb that killed me da.

474
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:16,852
How are you, Gerry?

475
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:18,520
Been wanting to make your acquaintance

476
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,356
for some time, I have.

477
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:27,697
(groaning)

478
00:26:27,697 --> 00:26:30,134
(chattering)

479
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:52,526
- If the government doesn't move in soon,

480
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:54,229
we'll have a bloody riot on our hands.

481
00:26:55,263 --> 00:26:57,665
(chattering)

482
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,703
- [Man] Never get out alive.

483
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:03,105
(chattering)

484
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:15,186
- Just give me the ball.

485
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:18,223
(chattering)

486
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:20,459
(grunting)

487
00:27:21,493 --> 00:27:22,494
- No, don't.

488
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,698
(grunting)

489
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:28,836
Stop it.

490
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:31,272
- What are you doing?

491
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:32,473
- Don't mind if we kick the shit out of your

492
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:33,307
retarded little brother, do you, Gerry boy?

493
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:38,513
- If he can't fight, that's his problem.

494
00:27:40,148 --> 00:27:42,385
(grunting)

495
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,324
(chattering)

496
00:27:47,324 --> 00:27:50,260
- Well, lads, looks as though we're an active jury,

497
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,261
one last time.

498
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:00,706
- I'm gonna catch up with Feeney and OD.

499
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:02,741
So I want you two to stay here.

500
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:03,943
Just find somewhere.

501
00:28:09,483 --> 00:28:11,018
- If we ever hope to have a free Irish state,

502
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:13,387
it's for the English to be out 100%.

503
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:16,224
That means no bargaining, no molly coddling,

504
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:18,060
and no damn cease fire.

505
00:28:19,728 --> 00:28:21,864
Not until we have our freedom.

506
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:23,166
Are you with me, brothers?

507
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,969
- Yeah. - I can't hear you.

508
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:27,103
Are you with me?

509
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:29,907
(yelling)

510
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:31,242
- Looks like there's three of them coming.

511
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,910
OD, Fagen, and Feeney.

512
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,445
- Grand.

513
00:28:34,445 --> 00:28:36,248
You all know your positions, then?

514
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,048
Make it count.

515
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,388
(tense music)

516
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,565
(gun cocking)

517
00:28:55,036 --> 00:28:56,404
(knocking)

518
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:57,672
Who is it?

519
00:28:57,672 --> 00:28:59,074
- It's John Feeney, Liam.

520
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:04,714
- What can I do for you, boys?

521
00:29:04,714 --> 00:29:05,715
- You're a fool.

522
00:29:05,715 --> 00:29:07,117
Bringing men here.

523
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:09,386
Only the four of us are supposed to know about this site.

524
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:12,456
You're just a bunch of little boys.

525
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:13,291
- Boys?

526
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:16,227
(gun shooting)

527
00:29:16,227 --> 00:29:18,397
(yelling)

528
00:29:24,437 --> 00:29:27,106
(guns shooting)

529
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,663
- Fagen's getting away.

530
00:29:46,663 --> 00:29:49,232
(gun shooting)

531
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:52,135
- You're a lucky one, Fagen.

532
00:30:07,053 --> 00:30:09,789
When they come and ask you who did all this,

533
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:12,026
you'll tell them brothers in arms, won't you?

534
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:19,868
That's a good lad.

535
00:30:26,676 --> 00:30:28,044
- OK.

536
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:29,647
Let's try another one, shall we?

537
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:33,050
What do you see?

538
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:37,055
- Sunset, over the water. - Very good, Gerry.

539
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,791
Let's try another one.

540
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:40,693
- A flower.

541
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:45,064
A pretty flower. - Pretty flower.

542
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:45,831
Nice.

543
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,369
Well, my time's up.

544
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:50,637
That's really good, Gerry.

545
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:53,675
I think you've come a long way.

546
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:54,709
I think there's hope.

547
00:30:55,643 --> 00:30:56,678
Wonderful hope.

548
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:58,580
Don't you?

549
00:31:03,686 --> 00:31:05,522
Gerry, they've asked me to inquire the whereabouts

550
00:31:05,522 --> 00:31:06,823
of your brother.

551
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:12,363
- Get the fuck out.

552
00:31:28,716 --> 00:31:30,718
- Let's go, lad. - Right.

553
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:45,668
(tense music)

554
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:07,427
(ominous music)

555
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:11,565
- Boom.

556
00:32:14,435 --> 00:32:15,436
On your knees, then.

557
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:17,038
Come on now, hurry up.

558
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:19,040
On your knees.

559
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,009
It's only the money I want.

560
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:21,910
Hurry up now lads.

561
00:32:26,015 --> 00:32:28,752
I was joking about only being interested in the money.

562
00:32:28,752 --> 00:32:31,622
There are much more important things in life.

563
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:37,395
(gun shooting)

564
00:32:39,631 --> 00:32:42,468
(classical music)

565
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:49,709
- John.

566
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:51,945
John.

567
00:32:57,418 --> 00:32:58,219
- Shit.

568
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:13,771
Hey, Lee.

569
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:17,609
- Got to get a phone out here, John.

570
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:20,545
- Well.

571
00:33:22,748 --> 00:33:24,350
Lee, what are you doing up here?

572
00:33:25,818 --> 00:33:28,555
I hope you brought your fly rod with ya, and that's it.

573
00:33:28,555 --> 00:33:31,158
- Let's get on, shall we?

574
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:32,526
Will you join us, Mr. Hall?

575
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:40,101
We just received this.

576
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,304
Only if you don't mind, Bracket.

577
00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:47,210
- You'll notice, this isn't tomato ketchup.

578
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,779
Nor is it the set of a Hollywood film.

579
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:50,647
This is reality.

580
00:33:51,982 --> 00:33:54,185
We're a group of patriots, who don't believe

581
00:33:54,185 --> 00:33:56,954
in the sham of a peace process that the British,

582
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:59,324
using the Americans are pushing upon our people.

583
00:34:00,492 --> 00:34:02,728
We intend to derail it by any means necessary.

584
00:34:03,595 --> 00:34:05,298
And everybody is a target.

585
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:07,634
Remember who we are.

586
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:09,469
Brothers in arms.

587
00:34:11,805 --> 00:34:13,140
Welcome to the war.

588
00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:16,611
- I don't know where they're getting their information,

589
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:18,513
but my security sources believe this

590
00:34:18,513 --> 00:34:20,482
to be a significant threat.

591
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:23,219
The men, the money.

592
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,421
- Earlier this week, two leading republican activists

593
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:27,790
were killed, it's believed, while attempting

594
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,927
to retrieve their weapon arsenal, as part of

595
00:34:29,927 --> 00:34:31,428
their decommissioning.

596
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:33,697
We believe that the same man in this video killed them,

597
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,801
and now has their entire explosive store.

598
00:34:37,735 --> 00:34:38,736
Liam Fallon.

599
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:40,104
Ring any bells, John?

600
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:42,541
- Oh yeah.

601
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,043
You know I know him.

602
00:34:44,043 --> 00:34:48,081
- I simply can't have these loonies mucking up our plans.

603
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:51,051
Your secretary of state is also arriving.

604
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:53,854
Covertly, I might add, to help with the process.

605
00:34:53,854 --> 00:34:55,690
I want this thing taken care of.

606
00:34:57,725 --> 00:34:58,627
You understand me.

607
00:34:59,928 --> 00:35:01,897
- Thank you, Sir Phillip.

608
00:35:01,897 --> 00:35:03,465
Can we talk alone for a second?

609
00:35:09,038 --> 00:35:10,774
Pompous bastard.

610
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:13,377
- Look, Lee-- - OK, John, now wait.

611
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,378
Please.

612
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,913
Listen for a sec, will you?

613
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,415
Now you'll be working with the British,

614
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,884
but there may be something of personal interest to you

615
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,353
on this.

616
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,223
After you arrive at Belfast, you'll be going straight

617
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:25,825
to interview Gerry Fallon.

618
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:28,929
He's willing to cooperate.

619
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:30,497
- Gerry Fallon?

620
00:35:30,497 --> 00:35:31,999
You've got to be kidding.

621
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,700
The only way I ever want to see Gerry Fallon again

622
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,503
is with my gun in his mouth.

623
00:35:35,503 --> 00:35:38,639
No, Lee, I don't need this aggravation, I don't want it.

624
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,310
- Truth is, you have no choice.

625
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:44,113
- Bullshit.

626
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:49,119
Not a chance.

627
00:35:55,826 --> 00:36:00,766
- Let's go.

628
00:36:20,622 --> 00:36:22,958
- Like me to leave, sir?

629
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:26,595
- No, you better stay.

630
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:27,696
- I'm harmless enough.

631
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:33,670
- It's not you I'm worried about, Gerry.

632
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:38,342
My name's John Hall.

633
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:40,846
Sound familiar?

634
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:43,582
- Can I have a smoke?

635
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:56,530
- Where's your brother?

636
00:36:57,765 --> 00:36:58,900
- Somewhere in Ireland.

637
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:01,837
- Oh.

638
00:37:01,837 --> 00:37:02,804
You like games.

639
00:37:05,842 --> 00:37:10,581
Gerard Anthony Fallon, born in 1957, Belfast,

640
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:12,883
first arrested for assaulting a British

641
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:14,418
army officer in 1972.

642
00:37:15,953 --> 00:37:18,523
Received scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin,

643
00:37:18,523 --> 00:37:20,792
dropped out final year after death of mother.

644
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:23,796
Father Michael shot to death, April 1969.

645
00:37:25,264 --> 00:37:29,102
Wife accidentally killed by a plastic bullet July 1988.

646
00:37:29,102 --> 00:37:32,038
- There are no accidents with plastic bullets.

647
00:37:32,038 --> 00:37:33,640
- Where's Liam?

648
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,277
- With all due respect to yourself, Mr. Hall.

649
00:37:36,277 --> 00:37:37,478
And whoever you're working for.

650
00:37:37,478 --> 00:37:38,679
If you go after Liam, with just yourself

651
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,649
and those proper British bobbies backing you,

652
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:43,018
they're gonna find you in a barn somewhere.

653
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:44,286
Cut from throat to dick.

654
00:37:45,154 --> 00:37:46,456
- What are you saying?

655
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:48,525
- If you want Liam, I'll give him to you.

656
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,594
But not in here.

657
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:53,063
- You think I'm gonna get you out of here?

658
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:53,898
You're crazy.

659
00:37:55,032 --> 00:37:56,534
I came a long way.

660
00:37:56,534 --> 00:37:59,371
I was told you agreed to give full cooperation.

661
00:37:59,371 --> 00:38:02,073
- Can't have much cooperation behind six feet of stone.

662
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:06,112
Clock's ticking.

663
00:38:13,086 --> 00:38:14,421
- Sergeant. - Yes, sir.

664
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:20,728
- Beautiful country.

665
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,899
But all it takes is one look at people like you

666
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:26,135
to know why my grandparents left.

667
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:28,003
- Appreciate the vote of confidence.

668
00:38:28,003 --> 00:38:29,039
- Where to, first?

669
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:31,675
- A fellow called Brian Fagen.

670
00:38:33,076 --> 00:38:34,545
- Yeah, what about him?

671
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,113
- He's a good man.

672
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,416
Probably only friend I have left.

673
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,019
- You want to drop the anonymous tip before your trial?

674
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,554
- What tip was that?

675
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,890
- That Liam's the one that blew up the Liden family.

676
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:46,960
And my sister.

677
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:49,162
- Don't know about that.

678
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:52,333
- So was it you?

679
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:54,902
- I never said push the button.

680
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,670
- Well, if you weren't responsible,

681
00:38:57,838 --> 00:38:58,974
then why didn't you say something?

682
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:01,876
- I never said that, either.

683
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:05,181
(dog barking)

684
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:07,750
(bluesy music)

685
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:51,167
He did live here.

686
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:54,838
- [John] Excuse me, miss?

687
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:57,908
Is there a Brian Fagen living here?

688
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,512
- No. - Do you know what happened

689
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,346
to his sister?

690
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:17,165
So, you married George Bailey.

691
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,499
Good lad.

692
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,467
When's he due back?

693
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,639
- George has been dead going on three years now, Gerry.

694
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:26,008
- Christ, Mary, I'm sorry.

695
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:30,613
- RUC picked him up one night coming back from the club.

696
00:40:30,613 --> 00:40:32,082
A few of his mates were with the movement,

697
00:40:32,082 --> 00:40:33,083
but he never joined.

698
00:40:34,618 --> 00:40:35,853
They held him for three weeks,

699
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:37,321
then released him to hospital.

700
00:40:39,256 --> 00:40:40,993
He died two days later.

701
00:40:40,993 --> 00:40:42,427
Internal injuries, they said.

702
00:40:43,729 --> 00:40:46,666
Hopefully those days are coming to a close.

703
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:48,968
- That's why we're here, Mary.

704
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:49,869
We need to see Brian.

705
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,072
- Haven't seen him.

706
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:53,173
Not since the incident with Liam.

707
00:40:53,173 --> 00:40:53,941
No one has.

708
00:40:55,142 --> 00:40:56,844
He'll stay under for a while, I'm guessing.

709
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,782
- Who could put the word out, we need to see him.

710
00:41:00,782 --> 00:41:02,650
- Mommy, Mommy, look what I did at school today.

711
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:05,621
- Oh, it's lovely.

712
00:41:08,724 --> 00:41:09,558
Lucy.

713
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:12,562
This is Mr. Farrel.

714
00:41:12,562 --> 00:41:13,964
He's an old friend of your Uncle Brian.

715
00:41:13,964 --> 00:41:14,965
- Hello.

716
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:16,334
Are you a bad man?

717
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:18,136
- No, honey.

718
00:41:18,136 --> 00:41:20,671
- Bad men are going to kill everybody that killed my daddy.

719
00:41:20,671 --> 00:41:21,606
- No, sweetheart.

720
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,612
Uncle Brian is going to be fine.

721
00:41:29,582 --> 00:41:30,784
- There's still a lot of people who think

722
00:41:30,784 --> 00:41:32,886
you're a traitor out there.

723
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:35,222
Be careful showing your face about the streets.

724
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,899
- We know that Liam's been recruiting members

725
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:47,537
of bars and pubs very young and very angry.

726
00:41:49,038 --> 00:41:50,807
- And you're gonna plant an angry young secret agent man

727
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:52,476
there and file the lot.

728
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,913
- In a manner of speaking, yeah, one of the best.

729
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:59,150
- Liam could smell a Brit spy like a ripe fart.

730
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,420
- Not this one he won't.

731
00:42:06,392 --> 00:42:08,561
(honking)

732
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:12,299
- Tonight, come to the Raiden.

733
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:13,767
It's all about the new truce.

734
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:15,635
Come on by, lads.

735
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:22,878
- Sounds good, Mitt.

736
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:34,725
- So, pick a bunk.

737
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:36,961
It ain't the Ritz, but it's functional.

738
00:42:36,961 --> 00:42:39,497
- Can I caution you again, my friend?

739
00:42:39,497 --> 00:42:40,832
Liam is not some mugger on the streets.

740
00:42:40,832 --> 00:42:42,367
- I'm quite aware of that.

741
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:44,603
- You think people don't know they're moving stuff in here?

742
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,273
Your man is about as subtle as a bull in a china shop.

743
00:42:48,241 --> 00:42:49,775
- Are you testing me?

744
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,179
- I'm saying if you want Liam, you've got to live like him.

745
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:54,147
Underground, on the streets.

746
00:42:54,147 --> 00:42:56,350
You got to get inside his head.

747
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,751
Think Irish.

748
00:42:57,751 --> 00:42:58,820
Feel our pain.

749
00:42:59,921 --> 00:43:00,722
- Is that right?

750
00:43:03,157 --> 00:43:05,694
You know when my grandfather immigrated to the US,

751
00:43:05,694 --> 00:43:08,230
he shortened his name from O'Halleran to Hall

752
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:10,901
because nobody in the city would hire a dirty mick.

753
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:14,604
Does that make me less Irish than you?

754
00:43:14,604 --> 00:43:16,474
Because of the geography, is that it?

755
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:19,610
Get smart, Gerry boy.

756
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,014
Don't even get being Irish confused

757
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:24,283
with being a damn sociopathic killer.

758
00:43:25,183 --> 00:43:26,084
I know that pain.

759
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:29,322
I've lived in the streets and I've been poor.

760
00:43:29,322 --> 00:43:31,391
But it will never be an excuse for pulling

761
00:43:31,391 --> 00:43:34,495
the maniacal, sick shit that you've pulled.

762
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,372
- Thousands were murdered by British occupying

763
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,507
security forces.

764
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:49,211
And most of those people, they were civilians.

765
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,046
Brothers.

766
00:43:56,653 --> 00:43:58,823
And now, they want us to lie down again,

767
00:43:58,823 --> 00:44:01,259
like good wee kitties, and declare a cease fire.

768
00:44:02,327 --> 00:44:05,097
Because they say so? - Hell no.

769
00:44:05,097 --> 00:44:08,133
(chattering)

770
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:11,404
- Now, we're gonna be speaking to each one of ya.

771
00:44:11,404 --> 00:44:12,806
Not all of you will make it.

772
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,876
But for those of you that do, you'll be telling

773
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:19,313
your grand kiddies about this glorious day

774
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:23,719
when we, the founding fathers, created a free Ireland.

775
00:44:26,388 --> 00:44:27,991
Welcome to the revolution, lads.

776
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:32,695
You ever fired a gun before, Devlin?

777
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,565
- I don't think so.

778
00:44:35,866 --> 00:44:36,700
No.

779
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:40,772
- Have you read Man and Superman or Thus Spake Zarathustra?

780
00:44:41,906 --> 00:44:44,242
- No, but I saw the film.

781
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:47,313
- The film?

782
00:44:49,415 --> 00:44:52,085
(ominous music)

783
00:45:07,202 --> 00:45:09,873
(laughing)

784
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,308
O'Brien, Plantis.

785
00:45:13,076 --> 00:45:16,180
What do you know about explosives?

786
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,381
- Not much.

787
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,484
- Ever fired a gun before?

788
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,753
- Sure.

789
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:23,455
Did a stint in the territorial army.

790
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,958
Only way I could get to play with the boys' guns.

791
00:45:28,161 --> 00:45:31,264
I've shot heckler and kush submachinegun.

792
00:45:31,264 --> 00:45:32,932
And nine millimeter Beretta.

793
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:35,035
Oh and a Winchester.

794
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:37,838
- A Winchester?

795
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:39,006
That's an old west gun.

796
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:42,744
- Always fancied meself a bit of a Calamity Jane,

797
00:45:42,744 --> 00:45:44,479
after I saw Doris Day in the movie.

798
00:45:46,148 --> 00:45:48,384
(laughing)

799
00:45:54,257 --> 00:45:55,425
- Where you from, Pete?

800
00:45:56,426 --> 00:45:57,929
- The Falls.

801
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:59,630
- Aye, so am I.

802
00:46:00,898 --> 00:46:02,100
You look familiar to me.

803
00:46:08,107 --> 00:46:10,443
What do you know about guns?

804
00:46:11,611 --> 00:46:12,445
- Do you mind?

805
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:30,333
- Why are you here?

806
00:46:31,968 --> 00:46:34,238
- I'm ready to kill, for you.

807
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:46,352
- These are my people.

808
00:46:46,352 --> 00:46:47,453
Let me do the talking.

809
00:46:51,056 --> 00:46:53,660
(bluesy music)

810
00:46:59,834 --> 00:47:03,070
- What in the name of God in heaven are you doing here, son?

811
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,473
- I need to speak to Brian.

812
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:05,707
Where can I find him?

813
00:47:05,707 --> 00:47:09,111
- If I was you, I'd be on my way.

814
00:47:09,111 --> 00:47:12,015
You've not many friends left around here.

815
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:13,416
- What the bloody hell are you doing here, Johnny Fallon?

816
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:15,418
- I'm not looking for trouble.

817
00:47:15,418 --> 00:47:17,521
I need to find Brian Fagen.

818
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:19,223
Can anyone help me?

819
00:47:19,223 --> 00:47:20,057
- Help you?

820
00:47:21,158 --> 00:47:22,761
Why don't you go and ask Sinead?

821
00:47:22,761 --> 00:47:24,896
She's buried not five miles down the road.

822
00:47:24,896 --> 00:47:26,865
I'm sure they've gotten that killer's fingerprints

823
00:47:26,865 --> 00:47:28,100
buried on it.

824
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,435
- Give me a whiskey.

825
00:47:29,435 --> 00:47:31,003
- I didn't kill your sister, Patty.

826
00:47:31,003 --> 00:47:32,839
I came back to avenge her death.

827
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:34,208
And the death of all the comrades

828
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:35,943
who were killed by my brother.

829
00:47:35,943 --> 00:47:37,311
- I'm gonna tear you apart.

830
00:47:38,312 --> 00:47:39,279
- That's it, pal.

831
00:47:40,548 --> 00:47:41,850
- This is not the way. - Shut up.

832
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,284
We tried it your way.

833
00:47:43,284 --> 00:47:44,886
Now we're looking for Brian Fagen.

834
00:47:44,886 --> 00:47:46,355
You ready to behave yourself?

835
00:47:47,189 --> 00:47:48,023
Where?

836
00:47:49,558 --> 00:47:51,695
- He's in your mother's place.

837
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:53,096
Giving it hard up the ass.

838
00:47:53,096 --> 00:47:53,930
- Enough.

839
00:47:58,269 --> 00:47:59,904
So, the first thing is this.

840
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:03,541
We want Liam taken out as badly as you people.

841
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:05,978
And second, you'll get no help from us,

842
00:48:05,978 --> 00:48:08,780
so long as that Mickey Mouse Scotland Yard operation

843
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,183
stays in our community.

844
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:13,486
- What are the chances of getting to Liam?

845
00:48:13,486 --> 00:48:15,890
We've already got someone on the inside.

846
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,726
- I put my money on Liam trying something when

847
00:48:18,726 --> 00:48:22,464
the US secretary comes for his secret meetings.

848
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:26,468
- I didn't tell him.

849
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:29,238
- Where are you getting your information?

850
00:48:29,238 --> 00:48:32,174
Why would they hit the paramilitary talks instead

851
00:48:32,174 --> 00:48:33,542
of the government meetings?

852
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,313
- The second venue is more isolated.

853
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,148
If Liam hits both loyalists and republicans,

854
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,618
on the US team, brokering the deal, together,

855
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:43,054
the whole peace process will blow sky high.

856
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:45,523
- What makes you think that's what Liam would do?

857
00:48:46,992 --> 00:48:49,428
- Because that's what I'd do.

858
00:49:03,444 --> 00:49:05,847
(chattering)

859
00:49:08,116 --> 00:49:10,620
(dog barking)

860
00:49:12,855 --> 00:49:15,291
(chattering)

861
00:49:18,495 --> 00:49:21,098
(gun shooting)

862
00:49:46,295 --> 00:49:47,296
- What's the matter?

863
00:49:47,296 --> 00:49:49,131
You remember something?

864
00:49:49,131 --> 00:49:49,965
- Aye.

865
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:52,902
Come on, I want to show you something.

866
00:50:04,816 --> 00:50:06,084
It's over here.

867
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,936
She didn't make me in the movement.

868
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:25,240
She said I should have finished my degree.

869
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,307
She used to tease me.

870
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,512
But eventually I only stayed in the movement

871
00:50:29,512 --> 00:50:30,680
to keep an eye on Liam.

872
00:50:32,348 --> 00:50:33,182
She said.

873
00:50:35,752 --> 00:50:37,454
If I was a part of it, then she had

874
00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:38,655
to be a part of it, also.

875
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:40,658
And so was our child.

876
00:50:44,695 --> 00:50:45,798
She'd one month ago.

877
00:50:49,968 --> 00:50:50,869
- You know.

878
00:50:52,138 --> 00:50:53,606
You made your own bed, Fallon.

879
00:51:09,057 --> 00:51:10,593
- What's happened?

880
00:51:10,593 --> 00:51:11,861
- We just got a tip where your brother and his mates

881
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:14,163
are hanging out, we raid in 30 minutes.

882
00:51:14,163 --> 00:51:15,766
I'd like you to come along.

883
00:51:15,766 --> 00:51:17,067
- It'll be a suicide mission.

884
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:17,901
He's on to you.

885
00:51:18,902 --> 00:51:19,903
- Oh, yeah?

886
00:51:19,903 --> 00:51:21,405
What makes you so sure of that?

887
00:51:21,405 --> 00:51:23,608
- The old man that did tip you, he wanted it that way.

888
00:51:25,677 --> 00:51:26,878
- I didn't stop grieving for my da.

889
00:51:26,878 --> 00:51:28,581
No, I didn't.

890
00:51:31,317 --> 00:51:33,420
Because I knew it was all part of the plan.

891
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,589
The plan to make me what I am today.

892
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:37,157
Your leader.

893
00:51:37,157 --> 00:51:41,529
And with God as my witness, the fire that was lit inside me

894
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:45,266
that day outside burns twice as bright,

895
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:49,271
and twice as hot today.

896
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:51,006
Are you ready, brothers?

897
00:51:51,006 --> 00:51:51,841
(yelling)

898
00:51:51,841 --> 00:51:53,176
Are you ready?

899
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:56,012
(yelling)

900
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:58,649
(ominous music)

901
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,762
- [Man] Over here.

902
00:52:10,763 --> 00:52:11,898
I'll meet you down here.

903
00:52:11,898 --> 00:52:13,466
I'll take him.

904
00:52:13,466 --> 00:52:15,903
(chattering)

905
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:18,572
Take it easy.

906
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:23,311
(chattering)

907
00:52:29,618 --> 00:52:32,121
(tense music)

908
00:52:35,091 --> 00:52:37,127
- You better give me a gun, if you want me to go in there.

909
00:52:37,127 --> 00:52:38,395
- Forget it.

910
00:52:38,395 --> 00:52:39,597
- All right, then I'm staying here.

911
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:41,599
- Suit yourself.

912
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:52,378
- OK.

913
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,546
Here they come.

914
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:54,347
Now.

915
00:52:57,283 --> 00:52:58,452
I said now, Francis.

916
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:08,063
- [Man] Control, a bomb here.

917
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:09,064
Roger.

918
00:53:09,064 --> 00:53:11,100
- Come in, Francis.

919
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,436
(exploding)

920
00:53:15,238 --> 00:53:16,607
- [Man] Waiting for back up.

921
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:17,441
Now.

922
00:53:24,282 --> 00:53:25,450
- Come on.

923
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,185
(gun shooting)

924
00:53:27,185 --> 00:53:30,155
(dramatic music)

925
00:53:30,155 --> 00:53:32,725
(gun shooting)

926
00:54:14,273 --> 00:54:15,709
- [Man] Get to an ambulance.

927
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:17,210
Call for backup.

928
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,779
Ambulance, now.

929
00:54:18,779 --> 00:54:21,516
(dramatic music)

930
00:54:24,686 --> 00:54:27,255
(gun shooting)

931
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:49,414
- They'll head for the docks.

932
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:50,382
Follow me there.

933
00:55:27,526 --> 00:55:28,727
- Where are they?

934
00:55:28,727 --> 00:55:29,561
- You check inside.

935
00:55:29,561 --> 00:55:31,130
You do the platform.

936
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:31,964
I'll do the back exit.

937
00:55:35,034 --> 00:55:37,303
- [Announcer] Now boarding.

938
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:42,510
- You're under arrest.

939
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,545
Put your hands up.

940
00:55:44,545 --> 00:55:45,747
RUC undercover.

941
00:55:45,747 --> 00:55:47,983
(laughing)

942
00:55:49,251 --> 00:55:51,153
I'll empty this gun into your face and go out

943
00:55:51,153 --> 00:55:53,322
for a pint afterward.

944
00:55:53,322 --> 00:55:54,290
Don't push me.

945
00:55:58,529 --> 00:56:01,532
- [Announcer] Last call, all aboard.

946
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:04,002
- I was wondering what you were waiting for, Francis.

947
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:06,838
Such a pity, on the wrong side.

948
00:56:08,006 --> 00:56:10,075
I was growing fond of you, Francis.

949
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,410
Getting feelings about you.

950
00:56:13,512 --> 00:56:15,348
Feelings I always wondered if I had.

951
00:56:16,883 --> 00:56:18,318
Know what I mean?

952
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:20,520
- You are one sick individual.

953
00:56:21,522 --> 00:56:23,157
And I'm here to put you down.

954
00:56:26,928 --> 00:56:29,164
(clicking)

955
00:56:30,532 --> 00:56:32,801
(stabbing)

956
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:41,178
(ominous music)

957
00:56:48,487 --> 00:56:49,888
- Oh Christ, no.

958
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,327
- Shit, the train.

959
00:57:04,706 --> 00:57:06,374
- Long live the movement, Liam, boy.

960
00:57:09,378 --> 00:57:10,212
- Gerry.

961
00:57:11,814 --> 00:57:13,549
- Nice night, eh, big brother?

962
00:57:14,617 --> 00:57:15,819
- Gerry, take him.

963
00:57:15,819 --> 00:57:17,053
- Put the knife down, eh?

964
00:57:18,088 --> 00:57:20,123
- Come on, don't be stupid, man.

965
00:57:20,123 --> 00:57:22,026
- Gerry, for Christ sake, what are you doing?

966
00:57:22,026 --> 00:57:23,127
Take him now.

967
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:25,263
- Gerry, come on.

968
00:57:37,243 --> 00:57:38,778
- Gerry, what are you doing?

969
00:57:38,778 --> 00:57:40,247
Give me the gun.

970
00:57:40,247 --> 00:57:42,750
(tense music)

971
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,822
(laughing)

972
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:53,529
- Long live the movement, Gerry boy.

973
00:57:53,529 --> 00:57:55,598
(laughing)

974
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:56,866
- Can I just listen?

975
00:57:56,866 --> 00:57:58,902
Gerry says he'll meet you at the social club

976
00:57:58,902 --> 00:58:00,771
tomorrow night, half past six.

977
00:58:00,771 --> 00:58:02,272
- Where is he?

978
00:58:02,272 --> 00:58:03,207
You tell that little prick to get back here now.

979
00:58:03,207 --> 00:58:04,976
- I said listen, Mr. Hall.

980
00:58:04,976 --> 00:58:07,211
Everything you've done so far has turned around

981
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:09,315
and bitten you in the arse,

982
00:58:09,315 --> 00:58:11,217
and now a lot of people are dead.

983
00:58:11,217 --> 00:58:12,051
You want Liam?

984
00:58:12,952 --> 00:58:14,219
You do it our way.

985
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:15,522
You're working for us now.

986
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:17,891
Welcome to the movement.

987
00:58:17,891 --> 00:58:19,125
- Wait a minute, damn it.

988
00:58:21,596 --> 00:58:22,430
Shit.

989
00:58:26,334 --> 00:58:28,437
- Why didn't you take Liam out back there?

990
00:58:30,238 --> 00:58:32,407
- Maybe I'm not the same man since prison.

991
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:34,210
- Maybe Liam is better than you now.

992
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,613
- Just trust me, Brian.

993
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:37,814
I sort him out.

994
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:38,648
Just trust me.

995
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,521
Look.

996
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,224
I'm gonna call around and see Mary.

997
00:58:51,998 --> 00:58:53,165
- Hey.

998
00:58:53,165 --> 00:58:54,066
Do you need a map?

999
00:58:55,267 --> 00:58:56,502
- No thanks.

1000
00:58:56,502 --> 00:58:57,471
I remember the way.

1001
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:01,541
(laughing)

1002
00:59:02,609 --> 00:59:05,613
(sentimental music)

1003
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,762
- What are you thinking?

1004
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:50,665
- I was thinking about when we were kids.

1005
00:59:52,635 --> 00:59:55,604
I remember my parents used to say this is our wee lad,

1006
00:59:55,604 --> 00:59:57,808
Gerry, the football star.

1007
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:00,977
He's going to play in the all Ireland some day.

1008
01:00:02,612 --> 01:00:04,082
And this is our other wee lad, Liam.

1009
01:00:04,082 --> 01:00:05,683
His brother.

1010
01:00:05,683 --> 01:00:08,186
- Christ, you're still going over this old stuff.

1011
01:00:09,421 --> 01:00:11,023
- What?

1012
01:00:11,023 --> 01:00:14,059
- I don't have time for any more victims in my life, Gerry.

1013
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:14,893
I've had enough.

1014
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:18,732
Everybody around us has lost someone we love

1015
01:00:18,732 --> 01:00:20,600
to this stupid, bloody war.

1016
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,936
Get over it.

1017
01:00:21,936 --> 01:00:23,738
- I wasn't talking about the war.

1018
01:00:23,738 --> 01:00:25,673
I was talking about family.

1019
01:00:25,673 --> 01:00:28,276
- Liam is not your problem to solve, he never was.

1020
01:00:29,444 --> 01:00:31,980
- What do you know about it?

1021
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,984
(sentimental music)

1022
01:00:38,654 --> 01:00:39,957
- I know that there are some problems

1023
01:00:39,957 --> 01:00:41,425
that can't be solved.

1024
01:00:41,425 --> 01:00:42,893
Not by he likes of us, anyway.

1025
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:47,899
All that's important now is what you can do something about.

1026
01:00:50,168 --> 01:00:51,904
I love you, Gerry, I always have.

1027
01:00:54,874 --> 01:00:56,409
Lucy, she's smitten by you.

1028
01:00:58,612 --> 01:01:00,347
And to Brian, you're the brother he never had.

1029
01:01:03,084 --> 01:01:04,685
I can't force you to do nothing.

1030
01:01:05,987 --> 01:01:09,424
But if it's family you want, it's right here,

1031
01:01:09,424 --> 01:01:10,392
for you to take.

1032
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:12,494
All you want.

1033
01:01:30,615 --> 01:01:31,983
- Mr. Hall, I presume.

1034
01:01:33,452 --> 01:01:37,690
Charles Erickson, your, well, I guess you'd say replacement.

1035
01:01:39,393 --> 01:01:42,629
Here to set up security for the US secretary's visit.

1036
01:01:42,629 --> 01:01:45,333
- And you're also here to piss me off.

1037
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:46,267
- No, sir.

1038
01:01:46,267 --> 01:01:48,236
Let's avoid that.

1039
01:01:48,236 --> 01:01:50,271
To be honest with you, the agency sent me out here

1040
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:53,175
quite unexpectedly and truth is,

1041
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:55,177
it'd be helpful if we had someone aboard who knew

1042
01:01:55,177 --> 01:01:56,645
what was going on around here.

1043
01:01:58,148 --> 01:02:00,350
Because I sure as hell do not.

1044
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:01,985
- Come on, I'll show you around.

1045
01:02:10,395 --> 01:02:11,230
Keep the change.

1046
01:02:12,731 --> 01:02:14,733
- It's already been taken care of.

1047
01:02:14,733 --> 01:02:17,337
(bluesy music)

1048
01:02:25,012 --> 01:02:26,714
- I should arrest you, you know.

1049
01:02:26,714 --> 01:02:29,084
- But that'd be boring.

1050
01:02:29,084 --> 01:02:30,252
- Yeah.

1051
01:02:30,252 --> 01:02:31,720
Yeah, it would.

1052
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,789
- I thought you'd be back in the states by now.

1053
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:36,959
- Your little brother killed and wounded a lot of my men.

1054
01:02:36,959 --> 01:02:37,894
That pisses me off.

1055
01:02:39,396 --> 01:02:40,697
- Very Irish of you.

1056
01:02:40,697 --> 01:02:42,900
- I keep telling you, O'Halleran's the name.

1057
01:02:44,268 --> 01:02:45,837
So what do you think he'll hit?

1058
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:49,941
- The talk in the country house.

1059
01:02:49,941 --> 01:02:50,775
I think.

1060
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:52,945
- What did Brian mean when he said

1061
01:02:52,945 --> 01:02:54,546
I was working for you now?

1062
01:02:58,985 --> 01:03:00,387
What do we do 'til then?

1063
01:03:01,588 --> 01:03:02,589
- Have another pint.

1064
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:06,961
(gun shooting)

1065
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:07,795
- Excellent.

1066
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:12,034
How we doing, lads?

1067
01:03:12,034 --> 01:03:13,402
- Doing well.

1068
01:03:13,402 --> 01:03:14,202
- About 1600.

1069
01:03:15,471 --> 01:03:18,041
(gun shooting)

1070
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,713
(chattering)

1071
01:03:24,248 --> 01:03:26,317
- Come here little puppy, come on.

1072
01:03:26,317 --> 01:03:28,486
(whining)

1073
01:03:29,955 --> 01:03:31,923
It's OK, it's OK, doggie.

1074
01:03:31,923 --> 01:03:32,858
Get closer to the window.

1075
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,062
Come here, it's OK.

1076
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,063
It's OK.

1077
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,333
(whining)

1078
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:41,068
- What are you doing?

1079
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:45,139
- Another little one scream.

1080
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:47,175
- I asked you a question, soldier.

1081
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:50,311
- What are you, playing the general here?

1082
01:03:50,311 --> 01:03:51,213
- What did you say?

1083
01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:54,717
- I said who the fuck are you?

1084
01:03:54,717 --> 01:03:55,584
Alec Guinness?

1085
01:03:56,585 --> 01:03:58,154
Mind your own fucking business.

1086
01:03:59,556 --> 01:04:01,157
(grunting)

1087
01:04:01,157 --> 01:04:02,325
- Don't you ever let me catch you touching

1088
01:04:02,325 --> 01:04:03,794
an animal again, you hear?

1089
01:04:03,794 --> 01:04:06,564
- Well, General, you just made a big mistake, my friend.

1090
01:04:08,499 --> 01:04:09,301
I tell you what.

1091
01:04:10,469 --> 01:04:12,137
Why don't you take a bite of this?

1092
01:04:15,975 --> 01:04:18,344
You don't remember me, do ya?

1093
01:04:18,344 --> 01:04:19,912
Asthmatic little piece of shit.

1094
01:04:21,448 --> 01:04:22,282
Come on.

1095
01:04:25,452 --> 01:04:27,188
Oh, that was a nice one.

1096
01:04:27,188 --> 01:04:29,391
Careful you don't cut yourself.

1097
01:04:29,391 --> 01:04:30,859
You know, for a general, you fight like a wee girl.

1098
01:04:30,859 --> 01:04:31,993
Like you always did.

1099
01:04:33,429 --> 01:04:34,263
- I'm gonna cut you to pieces.

1100
01:04:34,263 --> 01:04:37,566
(dramatic music)

1101
01:04:37,566 --> 01:04:39,336
- Now you remember who I am, Liam?

1102
01:04:39,336 --> 01:04:40,170
Hmm?

1103
01:04:41,338 --> 01:04:43,540
I'm your nightmare, little Liam.

1104
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:46,611
I kicked your sick ass once, and now I'm gonna do it again.

1105
01:04:46,611 --> 01:04:48,379
I cut up your orange little soccer ball,

1106
01:04:48,379 --> 01:04:50,415
and now it's your turn, my friend.

1107
01:04:51,817 --> 01:04:54,686
(grunting)

1108
01:04:54,686 --> 01:04:56,722
Is that what you want as your leader?

1109
01:04:56,722 --> 01:04:59,259
No, I'm your leader.

1110
01:04:59,259 --> 01:05:00,627
I'm your leader.

1111
01:05:00,627 --> 01:05:02,629
Now gather 'round, boys.

1112
01:05:02,629 --> 01:05:05,232
(gun shooting)

1113
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:16,813
(dog whining)

1114
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,921
- I will not have anyone abusing an animal.

1115
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,825
No one, is that understood?

1116
01:05:26,825 --> 01:05:28,626
Animals are God's gift to all of us.

1117
01:05:30,595 --> 01:05:31,429
Beat it.

1118
01:05:38,337 --> 01:05:41,441
- We've just received word that the US secretary of state

1119
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:42,909
will be attending a meeting,

1120
01:05:42,909 --> 01:05:44,879
chaired by the British officials, before going on

1121
01:05:44,879 --> 01:05:47,281
to a second private round of talks.

1122
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:49,851
So the question is, which place will they hit?

1123
01:05:49,851 --> 01:05:52,721
The government talks or the meeting at the seaside house?

1124
01:05:59,062 --> 01:06:00,897
After the US secretary's arrival, John will take

1125
01:06:00,897 --> 01:06:03,801
half of our deployment to the government talks.

1126
01:06:03,801 --> 01:06:05,703
I will lead the rest of the security team

1127
01:06:05,703 --> 01:06:09,708
at the manner house, where our guest, Mr. Fallon,

1128
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:12,244
will be in charge of a security road block.

1129
01:06:14,312 --> 01:06:16,883
- Only knows the secretary's time table.

1130
01:06:16,883 --> 01:06:18,317
- Since the talks seem to be going well,

1131
01:06:18,317 --> 01:06:19,552
the ETA of the second meeting

1132
01:06:19,552 --> 01:06:23,257
should be about 90 minutes, over.

1133
01:06:23,257 --> 01:06:24,591
- If you can convince him to do otherwise,

1134
01:06:24,591 --> 01:06:26,160
it will be a smart move.

1135
01:06:27,462 --> 01:06:28,696
Liam's coming here, John.

1136
01:06:30,098 --> 01:06:30,932
I can feel it.

1137
01:06:38,607 --> 01:06:41,278
(ominous music)

1138
01:06:42,812 --> 01:06:43,914
- Jesus Christ.

1139
01:06:46,751 --> 01:06:47,852
Get the first aid kit.

1140
01:06:56,295 --> 01:06:57,664
- Easy does it, boys.

1141
01:06:58,865 --> 01:07:01,000
We've got a ride to take.

1142
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,838
(laughing)

1143
01:07:09,911 --> 01:07:12,047
- Can I give you a hand there, missus?

1144
01:07:12,047 --> 01:07:13,215
- Oh, no problem. - Get in.

1145
01:07:13,215 --> 01:07:14,216
Get in.

1146
01:07:14,216 --> 01:07:16,285
Get in the house.

1147
01:07:16,285 --> 01:07:17,320
Get down.

1148
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,321
Shut that kid up.

1149
01:07:18,321 --> 01:07:20,489
Take the photo, go ahead, quick.

1150
01:07:20,489 --> 01:07:22,659
(honking)

1151
01:07:43,116 --> 01:07:45,419
- If that isn't a warm memory to cherish,

1152
01:07:45,419 --> 01:07:46,654
I don't know what is.

1153
01:07:47,922 --> 01:07:50,157
(laughing)

1154
01:07:51,793 --> 01:07:54,196
(chattering)

1155
01:07:55,297 --> 01:07:56,498
- Gerry, I think they're breaking up here.

1156
01:07:56,498 --> 01:07:57,967
The US secretary just left.

1157
01:07:57,967 --> 01:08:00,069
What's it like on your end, over.

1158
01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:01,904
- [Gerry] If they're going to arrive,

1159
01:08:01,904 --> 01:08:03,140
I think they would have already.

1160
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,342
Better come down here and buy us some supper.

1161
01:08:07,378 --> 01:08:08,512
We've got company, son.

1162
01:08:12,851 --> 01:08:15,521
(ominous music)

1163
01:08:31,472 --> 01:08:32,307
- Shit.

1164
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:42,385
- Turn the engine off.

1165
01:08:42,385 --> 01:08:44,387
IDs out and visible.

1166
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:45,389
And be quick about it.

1167
01:08:45,389 --> 01:08:46,390
- What's all this about?

1168
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:47,325
We were told to provide catering

1169
01:08:47,325 --> 01:08:48,759
for some visiting Americans.

1170
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:50,227
What's all the security hassle for?

1171
01:08:50,227 --> 01:08:51,330
- Never you mind.

1172
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:53,265
- We're already late as it is.

1173
01:08:53,265 --> 01:08:54,933
We don't need this hassle.

1174
01:08:54,933 --> 01:08:55,767
- Yeah, OK.

1175
01:08:55,767 --> 01:08:57,603
It's all right, Gerry.

1176
01:08:57,603 --> 01:08:59,772
These caterers were expected 30 minutes ago.

1177
01:08:59,772 --> 01:09:01,207
- Just a quick check in the back.

1178
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:05,646
- Gerry.

1179
01:09:05,646 --> 01:09:07,214
They're screaming for the caterers inside.

1180
01:09:07,214 --> 01:09:08,550
Everything's OK here.

1181
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:13,688
- He'd never be that obvious.

1182
01:09:19,228 --> 01:09:20,029
- Sorry, mate.

1183
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:21,298
I got stuck in a ditch.

1184
01:09:22,432 --> 01:09:23,700
(foreign language spoken)

1185
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,202
Come on, everyone, we're late.

1186
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:36,515
- So what do you think?

1187
01:09:36,515 --> 01:09:38,718
- Don't think he's coming.

1188
01:09:38,718 --> 01:09:40,720
Gerry. - 97, 98, 99, 100.

1189
01:09:43,857 --> 01:09:46,027
Here I come, ready or not.

1190
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:02,245
Right here you little wanker.

1191
01:10:11,823 --> 01:10:13,992
- Gerry, help me, help me.

1192
01:10:15,561 --> 01:10:16,395
Help me.

1193
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,437
(laughing)

1194
01:10:23,437 --> 01:10:24,771
- You little wanker.

1195
01:10:24,771 --> 01:10:28,209
You always could find the best hiding places.

1196
01:10:28,209 --> 01:10:29,377
- Damn. - What?

1197
01:10:31,879 --> 01:10:32,714
- Damn.

1198
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:39,322
- Deal with the ones out there.

1199
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:40,123
Silencer.

1200
01:10:42,592 --> 01:10:44,194
And then take care of the subtext.

1201
01:10:44,194 --> 01:10:44,995
Go.

1202
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:55,540
- Hey, you're going the wrong way.

1203
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:56,542
(gun shooting)

1204
01:10:56,542 --> 01:10:58,744
(grunting)

1205
01:11:06,587 --> 01:11:08,823
- Those caterers who just came through, find 'em.

1206
01:11:08,823 --> 01:11:10,258
They're the lads we want.

1207
01:11:14,463 --> 01:11:17,433
(gun shooting)

1208
01:11:17,433 --> 01:11:19,468
- Sit down, now.

1209
01:11:19,468 --> 01:11:20,704
- What the hell is going on here?

1210
01:11:20,704 --> 01:11:22,305
- Who are you people?

1211
01:11:22,305 --> 01:11:23,540
What the hell do you want?

1212
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:26,176
- We, Mr. Secretary, are brothers in arms.

1213
01:11:26,176 --> 01:11:28,713
And if our demands are met, these few hours we spend

1214
01:11:28,713 --> 01:11:30,214
together will be pleasant ones.

1215
01:11:30,214 --> 01:11:35,220
So just stay seated, shut up, and no heroics.

1216
01:11:35,821 --> 01:11:37,990
(tense music)

1217
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,933
- [Man] In position.

1218
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:48,836
- We have the west side covered.

1219
01:11:48,836 --> 01:11:50,070
- What do you think you're going to achieve,

1220
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,339
you bloody fool?

1221
01:11:51,339 --> 01:11:52,908
You not know what you're going to destroy here.

1222
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:55,477
- I know exactly what I'm doing, you stupid bastard.

1223
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:59,182
I'm finishing your talks here with Mr. Loyalist over there.

1224
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:01,017
And you, Mr. Secretary.

1225
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:03,253
You can explain the US government's involvement

1226
01:12:03,253 --> 01:12:05,522
in these secret peace talks when I invite

1227
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:07,558
the international media circus along.

1228
01:12:09,594 --> 01:12:10,895
Look carefully, gentlemen.

1229
01:12:12,297 --> 01:12:13,932
If anything happens to me, or if I am in any way

1230
01:12:13,932 --> 01:12:16,569
made unhappy, I just have to push this button.

1231
01:12:17,736 --> 01:12:20,540
And we'll all be traveling westward.

1232
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:38,628
To whom am I speaking?

1233
01:12:38,628 --> 01:12:42,565
- Mr. Fallon, this is John Hall of US central intelligence.

1234
01:12:42,565 --> 01:12:45,202
- Here's our demands, and I'll only say them once.

1235
01:12:45,202 --> 01:12:48,472
First off, I want some members of the international media

1236
01:12:48,472 --> 01:12:51,376
outside this compound within three hours.

1237
01:12:51,376 --> 01:12:54,379
Or this little menage tois will be terminated.

1238
01:12:54,379 --> 01:12:55,947
Second.

1239
01:12:55,947 --> 01:12:58,951
I want some of my republican comrades freed from prison.

1240
01:13:00,019 --> 01:13:01,621
Third.

1241
01:13:01,621 --> 01:13:04,157
I want the British prime minister and the American president

1242
01:13:04,157 --> 01:13:06,293
to issue statements about how they've just defied

1243
01:13:06,293 --> 01:13:09,263
sanction deficit meetings between their government

1244
01:13:09,263 --> 01:13:13,201
representatives, and men of violence.

1245
01:13:13,201 --> 01:13:14,002
And finally.

1246
01:13:15,504 --> 01:13:18,140
I'm requesting a liaison officer from your side

1247
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,142
to come over here.

1248
01:13:20,142 --> 01:13:22,912
- Fine, I'd like to come in myself.

1249
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:27,685
- No, Mr. Hall, I don't want you, or the bastard.

1250
01:13:27,685 --> 01:13:28,552
- The bastard.

1251
01:13:28,552 --> 01:13:29,587
What bastard? - Me.

1252
01:13:32,424 --> 01:13:34,893
- Are you sure you want to do this.

1253
01:13:34,893 --> 01:13:36,728
- Want has got nothing to do with it.

1254
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,900
If this doesn't go in my favor,

1255
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,168
I want you to do something for me.

1256
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:44,638
When me buried me da, I put a rose in one pocket

1257
01:13:44,638 --> 01:13:46,140
and a deck of cards in the other.

1258
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,842
That way, no matter which way he traveled, he'd be ready.

1259
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:51,780
I'd like to feel the same security.

1260
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:54,582
- Why didn't you take the shot when you had the chance?

1261
01:13:54,582 --> 01:13:56,051
- When I was at Trinity College,

1262
01:13:56,051 --> 01:13:58,654
I wrote my thesis on Shelly's Frankenstein, the doctor.

1263
01:13:59,922 --> 01:14:01,223
The creator.

1264
01:14:01,223 --> 01:14:03,393
When I do in Liam, it's gonna be my way.

1265
01:14:05,429 --> 01:14:08,098
(ominous music)

1266
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,675
(knocking)

1267
01:14:28,989 --> 01:14:29,890
- Leave us.

1268
01:14:34,463 --> 01:14:35,630
- You've gotten better.

1269
01:14:36,498 --> 01:14:37,332
- You've aged.

1270
01:14:42,638 --> 01:14:44,073
Come, come, Gerry boy.

1271
01:14:45,242 --> 01:14:46,643
No tears for this, old lad.

1272
01:14:51,049 --> 01:14:54,919
- I don't suppose it'll do any good to ask you to surrender.

1273
01:14:54,919 --> 01:14:57,089
- You taught me better than that, Gerry.

1274
01:14:58,224 --> 01:15:00,459
- I never wanted this for you, Liam.

1275
01:15:00,459 --> 01:15:01,994
I want you to answer your dreams.

1276
01:15:01,994 --> 01:15:04,564
- And I just wanted to be like you, Gerry boy.

1277
01:15:04,564 --> 01:15:06,166
(laughing)

1278
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:08,803
But then, I wanted to surpass ya.

1279
01:15:10,204 --> 01:15:11,472
Which.

1280
01:15:13,307 --> 01:15:15,043
I'd say I've done in flying colors.

1281
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:22,919
- You're a murderer.

1282
01:15:22,919 --> 01:15:24,320
- And exactly what were you?

1283
01:15:25,488 --> 01:15:27,424
- I thought I was a patriot.

1284
01:15:27,424 --> 01:15:29,593
But I was just a stupid boy.

1285
01:15:29,593 --> 01:15:31,929
- George Washington was considered a terrorist.

1286
01:15:31,929 --> 01:15:33,265
And a murderer in his day.

1287
01:15:34,533 --> 01:15:36,635
I'm winning, Gerry boy.

1288
01:15:36,635 --> 01:15:37,869
They're on their knees.

1289
01:15:40,106 --> 01:15:40,940
Join us.

1290
01:15:42,942 --> 01:15:44,711
Be at my side again, Gerry, come on.

1291
01:15:45,813 --> 01:15:47,681
- I don't think so, wee brother.

1292
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:49,850
I've committed enough sins for one lifetime.

1293
01:15:52,954 --> 01:15:55,456
(tense music)

1294
01:16:06,703 --> 01:16:08,973
- Insurance policy, Gerry boy.

1295
01:16:08,973 --> 01:16:13,978
If those boys don't get a call from me every hour, well,

1296
01:16:14,847 --> 01:16:15,881
you know what will happen.

1297
01:16:16,748 --> 01:16:19,418
(ominous music)

1298
01:16:24,624 --> 01:16:27,661
- What do you want me to do?

1299
01:16:29,196 --> 01:16:31,198
- That's the spirit, Gerry boy.

1300
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:32,099
That's the spirit.

1301
01:16:35,537 --> 01:16:37,205
This is an interesting gathering.

1302
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:40,643
All the rotten eggs in one basket.

1303
01:16:40,643 --> 01:16:41,444
Gerry.

1304
01:16:44,781 --> 01:16:46,617
It's all downhill from now, Gerry boy.

1305
01:16:50,655 --> 01:16:51,489
- John.

1306
01:16:53,658 --> 01:16:55,860
- Yeah, Gerry, this is John, go ahead.

1307
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,763
- They want a statement read by the British prime minister.

1308
01:16:57,763 --> 01:16:58,764
And US president.

1309
01:16:58,764 --> 01:17:00,299
No later than tomorrow at nine.

1310
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,203
They've got TV so he'll be watching.

1311
01:17:03,203 --> 01:17:04,704
He says he'll release a hostage soon,

1312
01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:05,906
as a sign of good faith.

1313
01:17:08,376 --> 01:17:10,645
(laughing)

1314
01:17:10,645 --> 01:17:12,280
- Boom.

1315
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:14,549
(laughing)

1316
01:17:17,819 --> 01:17:18,820
Boom.

1317
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:21,057
(laughing)

1318
01:17:24,861 --> 01:17:26,297
Get the hostage ready for me.

1319
01:17:33,138 --> 01:17:34,973
- [Man] There's movement at the door.

1320
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:40,880
- I can take him now.

1321
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,148
- Hold your fire.

1322
01:17:42,148 --> 01:17:45,152
- Mr. Hall, here comes your hostage.

1323
01:17:47,354 --> 01:17:49,589
(laughing)

1324
01:18:00,402 --> 01:18:03,373
They have no sense of humor, your employers.

1325
01:18:03,373 --> 01:18:05,642
- If you don't release some humans,

1326
01:18:05,642 --> 01:18:07,077
they'll not take us seriously.

1327
01:18:07,077 --> 01:18:08,779
- You think Michael Collins and Walter Devril

1328
01:18:08,779 --> 01:18:10,615
thought they'd live through their revolution?

1329
01:18:10,615 --> 01:18:11,449
Huh, Gerry boy?

1330
01:18:13,484 --> 01:18:16,121
- I need to take a piss, noble Mr. Martyr.

1331
01:18:18,924 --> 01:18:20,526
- You're such an asshole, Gerry.

1332
01:18:22,028 --> 01:18:23,529
Take him upstairs, will ya?

1333
01:18:23,529 --> 01:18:26,233
And make sure he shakes twice and washes his hands.

1334
01:18:29,203 --> 01:18:30,437
(ominous music)

1335
01:18:30,437 --> 01:18:30,938
- I think I can get the one closest to us.

1336
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:33,375
Take on.

1337
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,610
(chattering)

1338
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:38,114
(tense music)

1339
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:45,522
- Have a crumpet.

1340
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:47,791
(grunting)

1341
01:18:49,192 --> 01:18:51,696
(tense music)

1342
01:19:01,907 --> 01:19:02,742
- Brian.

1343
01:19:04,911 --> 01:19:05,745
It's Mary.

1344
01:19:10,051 --> 01:19:11,218
What the fuck is Fallon doing in there?

1345
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,189
Erickson.

1346
01:19:14,189 --> 01:19:15,190
I'm going in.

1347
01:19:17,325 --> 01:19:19,728
(chattering)

1348
01:19:20,696 --> 01:19:22,865
(gasping)

1349
01:19:25,301 --> 01:19:27,538
(grunting)

1350
01:19:31,508 --> 01:19:32,811
- Reports are coming in of gunfire from the holiday

1351
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:35,780
resort home of retired American general.

1352
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:37,115
(laughing)

1353
01:19:37,115 --> 01:19:39,051
Full details are not yet available,

1354
01:19:39,051 --> 01:19:42,388
but we do hope to have further coverage.

1355
01:19:45,358 --> 01:19:47,594
- Daniel, where's your ma and pa?

1356
01:19:48,695 --> 01:19:50,298
- At me sister's for the night.

1357
01:19:50,298 --> 01:19:51,466
Just had a baby.

1358
01:19:51,466 --> 01:19:52,433
- Daniel, we need your help.

1359
01:19:53,334 --> 01:19:54,502
- Yeah, sure.

1360
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:55,503
- You lock down music, like the place,

1361
01:19:55,503 --> 01:19:58,140
we need you to play live.

1362
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:00,309
OK?

1363
01:20:00,309 --> 01:20:02,746
- Seriously cool, man.

1364
01:20:02,746 --> 01:20:04,314
- John, can you hear me?

1365
01:20:04,314 --> 01:20:05,248
- [Erickson] Erickson here, where are you?

1366
01:20:05,248 --> 01:20:06,082
- Upstairs.

1367
01:20:07,217 --> 01:20:08,652
I saw the main device on the top floor,

1368
01:20:08,652 --> 01:20:10,020
managed to disconnect it.

1369
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:10,955
That means there's one more connected

1370
01:20:10,955 --> 01:20:12,490
to all the charges downstairs.

1371
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:14,259
I think I know where It is.

1372
01:20:14,259 --> 01:20:15,193
Where's John?

1373
01:20:15,193 --> 01:20:15,994
- John is at the house.

1374
01:20:15,994 --> 01:20:17,295
- Shit.

1375
01:20:17,295 --> 01:20:18,897
- What do you want to hear?

1376
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:23,903
Festering Boys, the Flem Brothers, RE and the Puke.

1377
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:25,471
- Puke.

1378
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:26,306
- Brilliant.

1379
01:20:29,977 --> 01:20:32,380
(rock music)

1380
01:20:38,521 --> 01:20:41,590
- Don't people have no manners any longer?

1381
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:43,159
Why don't you take young Lucy upstairs

1382
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:45,362
and read her a bed?

1383
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:48,098
(chattering)

1384
01:20:48,098 --> 01:20:49,566
- No, God damn it.

1385
01:20:53,204 --> 01:20:55,673
(tense music)

1386
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:08,322
- Hey.

1387
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,925
(gun shooting)

1388
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:13,928
- It's Hall, CIA.

1389
01:21:13,928 --> 01:21:16,598
(rock music)

1390
01:21:16,598 --> 01:21:19,000
(chattering)

1391
01:21:20,336 --> 01:21:21,204
- OK, boys, get ready.

1392
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:25,408
(yelling)

1393
01:21:33,017 --> 01:21:35,320
- Sources say they believe that Liam Fallon,

1394
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,055
the leader of an extreme splinter group,

1395
01:21:37,055 --> 01:21:39,291
going under the name Brothers in Arms,

1396
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:41,460
may be holding an American man hostage.

1397
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,562
Some of his men have already surrendered,

1398
01:21:43,562 --> 01:21:47,734
and it is believed that their average age is only around 19.

1399
01:21:47,734 --> 01:21:49,002
- What's this? - A spokesman

1400
01:21:49,002 --> 01:21:50,504
for the security forces has informed reporters

1401
01:21:50,504 --> 01:21:53,140
on the scene-- - You traitors.

1402
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:54,642
- [Reporter] As yet there has been no sighting

1403
01:21:54,642 --> 01:21:56,345
of the leader, Liam Fallon, but they do expect

1404
01:21:56,345 --> 01:22:00,549
the situation to be resolved in the next few hours.

1405
01:22:02,919 --> 01:22:03,920
(gun shooting)

1406
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,488
- You traitorous bastards.

1407
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:06,489
- We got a clear shot.

1408
01:22:06,489 --> 01:22:08,659
- Hold your fire.

1409
01:22:08,659 --> 01:22:10,928
(gun shooting)

1410
01:22:10,928 --> 01:22:12,863
(grunting)

1411
01:22:12,863 --> 01:22:14,132
- You traitors.

1412
01:22:16,835 --> 01:22:17,669
Gerry.

1413
01:22:37,325 --> 01:22:40,296
Come on, Gerry, where you hiding, Gerry?

1414
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:53,210
Gerry.

1415
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:54,478
I'm gonna find you, Gerry.

1416
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:57,316
Come on, you wanker.

1417
01:22:58,784 --> 01:23:00,519
- Bitch, I'll kill you.

1418
01:23:00,519 --> 01:23:02,322
Get down here, Christ.

1419
01:23:04,824 --> 01:23:06,959
(yelling)

1420
01:23:06,959 --> 01:23:09,396
(rock music)

1421
01:23:10,731 --> 01:23:12,466
(chattering)

1422
01:23:12,466 --> 01:23:13,300
(gun shooting)

1423
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,170
- What the hell?

1424
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:18,540
(gun shooting)

1425
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:19,541
- Brilliant.

1426
01:23:23,612 --> 01:23:24,447
- No.

1427
01:23:30,887 --> 01:23:31,823
- What kept ya?

1428
01:23:31,823 --> 01:23:33,024
- Modern technology.

1429
01:23:34,225 --> 01:23:36,394
(beeping)

1430
01:23:37,261 --> 01:23:40,065
(tense music)

1431
01:23:40,065 --> 01:23:41,166
- What are you doing?

1432
01:23:46,272 --> 01:23:48,041
They've all run away.

1433
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:51,012
Why?

1434
01:23:51,012 --> 01:23:53,581
- Because you lost sight of the reasons for this.

1435
01:23:53,581 --> 01:23:55,516
Your demands were exaggerations.

1436
01:23:55,516 --> 01:23:56,351
And guess what?

1437
01:23:58,053 --> 01:23:59,321
Because they were a bunch of stupid kids

1438
01:23:59,321 --> 01:24:01,089
off the street, you dumb bastard.

1439
01:24:01,089 --> 01:24:04,360
We worked on our people for months, years on end.

1440
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,262
Those kids had no training whatsoever.

1441
01:24:09,967 --> 01:24:12,036
(gun shooting)

1442
01:24:12,036 --> 01:24:14,906
Come on, Liam, come on, out the back, Liam, quick, hurry.

1443
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:26,720
- [Erickson] Erickson here, where are you?

1444
01:24:28,922 --> 01:24:29,790
- Station two.

1445
01:24:30,924 --> 01:24:32,026
The Fallons have left the area.

1446
01:24:32,026 --> 01:24:33,795
- Take the house now.

1447
01:24:33,795 --> 01:24:34,796
All units move in.

1448
01:24:34,796 --> 01:24:36,264
Go, go, go.

1449
01:24:36,264 --> 01:24:37,265
- Move it, move it, up by the window.

1450
01:24:37,265 --> 01:24:38,100
- Come on.

1451
01:24:39,701 --> 01:24:42,404
(chattering)

1452
01:24:42,404 --> 01:24:44,908
(tense music)

1453
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:48,711
- [Liam] Come on, Gerry.

1454
01:24:48,711 --> 01:24:50,881
(laughing)

1455
01:24:50,881 --> 01:24:52,149
We did it.

1456
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:53,751
(chattering)

1457
01:24:53,751 --> 01:24:55,686
- Search the perimeter.

1458
01:24:58,056 --> 01:25:00,192
(beeping)

1459
01:25:00,192 --> 01:25:01,961
- Gonna blow.

1460
01:25:01,961 --> 01:25:04,297
(exploding)

1461
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:16,578
(coughing)

1462
01:25:38,904 --> 01:25:41,473
- Great to be back together again, Gerry, you know?

1463
01:25:43,242 --> 01:25:46,746
Great to have the family back together.

1464
01:25:46,746 --> 01:25:47,580
- Aye.

1465
01:25:48,882 --> 01:25:49,917
But sometimes.

1466
01:25:51,385 --> 01:25:56,358
You got to take responsibility for what you've done.

1467
01:25:56,358 --> 01:25:57,325
For what you created.

1468
01:26:00,562 --> 01:26:01,396
Sometimes.

1469
01:26:03,799 --> 01:26:06,369
Taking that responsibility means you have to let go

1470
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:09,439
of the things you hold dear.

1471
01:26:12,309 --> 01:26:17,315
And the people you love.

1472
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:27,761
(dramatic music)

1473
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:37,171
- No.

1474
01:26:37,171 --> 01:26:39,508
(exploding)

1475
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,802
- I can't say I understand why he did what he did.

1476
01:27:05,705 --> 01:27:06,606
I'm sorry, Mary.

1477
01:27:08,742 --> 01:27:12,646
Believe me, I know how it feels to lose someone you love.

1478
01:27:12,646 --> 01:27:14,315
- It is a painful loss, Mr. Hall.

1479
01:27:18,553 --> 01:27:20,522
Maybe that's something that you and I

1480
01:27:20,522 --> 01:27:22,057
and Gerry have in common.

1481
01:27:30,934 --> 01:27:34,238
He did what he did out of loyalty, to his family.

1482
01:27:35,406 --> 01:27:36,240
His country.

1483
01:27:38,110 --> 01:27:39,511
Might seem strange to you.

1484
01:27:41,847 --> 01:27:42,681
It's what he was.

1485
01:27:44,651 --> 01:27:46,052
I loved him for what he was.

1486
01:28:08,045 --> 01:28:10,213
- Just in case, Gerry boy.

1487
01:28:11,048 --> 01:28:12,082
Just in case.

1488
01:28:15,687 --> 01:28:17,088
- [Gerry] Your life is mine.

1489
01:28:18,356 --> 01:28:19,357
My life is yours.

1490
01:28:20,993 --> 01:28:22,594
And life is what it's all about.

1491
01:28:23,996 --> 01:28:28,234
And when we get what we deserve, life is hard to figure out.

1492
01:28:28,234 --> 01:28:30,704
But things are always not the same.

1493
01:28:30,704 --> 01:28:32,506
And who we are is not to blame.

1494
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:36,744
And if one day we end up dead, Mother,

1495
01:28:37,946 --> 01:28:38,814
cover up my head.

1496
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:43,251
- For fuck's sake, Liam, you scared the piss out of me.

1497
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:45,488
- Sorry, Gerry, can I play with you, today?

1498
01:28:45,488 --> 01:28:47,690
- Got no time for play anymore, Liam.

1499
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:50,160
Got to do something for Brian, for the movement.

1500
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,762
- You're going to make a bomb?

1501
01:28:51,762 --> 01:28:54,331
- Yeah, but don't go shouting it about nowhere, either.

1502
01:28:54,331 --> 01:28:56,067
- Can I help, I won't tell anyone.

1503
01:28:56,067 --> 01:28:57,335
Please.

1504
01:28:57,335 --> 01:28:58,536
- OK.

1505
01:28:58,536 --> 01:28:59,971
Guess it's time you grew up.

1506
01:28:59,971 --> 01:29:01,774
But don't tell anybody.

1507
01:29:01,774 --> 01:29:03,376
- I won't.

1508
01:29:03,376 --> 01:29:04,677
- OK.

1509
01:29:04,677 --> 01:29:05,511
Come on.

1510
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:11,651
- [Gerry] Is it my fault, what I feel?

1511
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:14,322
Is it life I've got to steal?

1512
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:17,992
Tell me, softly, why I hate.

1513
01:29:19,561 --> 01:29:21,630
Wake me up, before it's too late.

1514
01:29:23,999 --> 01:29:25,902
Help my brother dry his tears.

1515
01:29:28,371 --> 01:29:30,373
Help erase these last few years.

1516
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:34,612
If we could only take things back.

1517
01:29:34,612 --> 01:29:36,347
And love the things that we attack.

1518
01:29:37,649 --> 01:29:39,484
My brother's heart is thickly veiled.

1519
01:29:40,652 --> 01:29:43,255
His heart is hard, his love has failed.

1520
01:29:44,624 --> 01:29:47,059
But I am here to rescue him.

1521
01:29:47,059 --> 01:29:48,661
And try to understand his whim.

1522
01:29:50,197 --> 01:29:51,999
Are we here just to survive,

1523
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,568
and can we get through life alive?

1524
01:29:55,537 --> 01:29:57,872
My baby brother's life is mine.

1525
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,811
My heart is his, it's now our time.

1526
01:30:02,678 --> 01:30:05,681
(sentimental music)
