1
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,464
Czy nie mo¿emy po prostu wys³aæ kierowcê?

2
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,735
To S¹ przyjaciele,nie goœcie.

3
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,538
Did you remind Tim
that the people are coming

4
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,010
with the new furniture?

5
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,569
Oh.

6
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,549
Sweetie, can you pretend
that we're running a business?

7
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:56,645
If I wanted to work, I would
have stayed in New York.

8
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,714
I'm going
I'm going

9
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:24,645
Hey buddy, the new furniture
should be here in about an hour.

10
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,706
You're gonna have
to sign for it, okay?

11
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,081
Okay.

12
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,433
You know, I don't know
why someone who spent

13
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:52,671
4 years in pre-med would wanna
become a doctor of divinity

14
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,111
instead of a real doctor.

15
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,581
You could really help
some people, you know?

16
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:02,609
I wanna help
people with this.

17
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:13,459
I tell ya what, why don't
you just forget everything,

18
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,501
stay with us here
in paradise?

19
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:25,006
I wanna help other
people find paradise.

20
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:28,740
Yeah, stepped in it
that time, huh?

21
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:32,113
Oh, there's my
master's voice.

22
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,617
See ya later.

23
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,716
Christopher!

24
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,757
Yup, yup,
yup, yup, YUP

25
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,057
Sorry, honey.
I told him.

26
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,061
See ya, son.

27
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,436
Chu.

28
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,238
I got him.

29
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,711
He's outside of Deville's.

30
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,714
<i>You have a positive ID?</i>

31
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,841
<i>Yup.</i>

32
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,079
<i>It's him.</i>

33
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,645
Is he
carrying any suitcases?

34
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,282
No.

35
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,917
<i>Well, you hold your position.</i>

36
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,518
I'll have a team there
in a half-hour.

37
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,120
<i>Half an hour?
He could be gone in 5 minutes.</i>

38
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,460
Let me take him now.

39
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,591
<i>That's a negative.</i>

40
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,603
<i>I only want this guy
carrying drugs or money.</i>

41
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,002
<i>That's not necessary.</i>

42
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,334
<i>We've got
a fugitive warrant.</i>

43
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,238
He's been indicted
on two RICO cases.

44
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,140
And he's gonna
walk on both.

45
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,507
I want this guy.

46
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,103
<i>We need hard evidence.</i>

47
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,875
<i>I want him in jail.</i>

48
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,578
You stay in your car
and you just watch him.

49
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,143
<i>What's up?</i>

50
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,786
See that guy
over there?

51
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,386
<i>What guy?</i>

52
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,824
<i>The white
guy with the beard</i>

53
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:34,898
I think you and I are the
only two whites around here.

54
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,992
What's wrong?
Someone you recognize?

55
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,435
No.

56
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,529
But he seemed
to know me.

57
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:45,363
This is all you'll need.

58
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:50,431
<i>Cameron will meet you
at the Anantara Resort.</i>

59
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,137
<i>It's a lovely place, although
it's taken on the stench</i>

60
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,645
of death as of late.

61
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,579
Cameron will provide you
with police protection

62
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:02,245
as long as you're
in the providence.

63
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,289
But once you're out of here,
you're on your own.

64
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:11,221
I hear that this is
your last shipment.

65
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,594
May I ask why?

66
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,224
I had enough.

67
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,291
You've had enough?

68
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:22,898
Well, that makes you
a very dangerous man, Bruno.

69
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:27,069
<i>Our entire society's
built on having more,</i>

70
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:32,242
<i>bigger house, faster car,
more beautiful woman.</i>

71
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,081
<i>What if everyone decided
they'd had enough?</i>

72
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,112
<i>Our entire world order
would come tumbling down.</i>

73
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,226
The day you have enough, Bruno,
is the day you die.

74
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:48,130
<i>If I didn't
know you better...</i>

75
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,169
I'd call that a threat.

76
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,462
Sound like a threat
to you, Charlie?

77
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,871
Sounds like a threat
to me, Bruno.

78
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,845
<i>I bet you want
more, Charlie, don't you?</i>

79
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,882
A little more
never hurt anybody.

80
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,249
White man.

81
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,384
It's Caperna.

82
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,897
See you around, Deville.

83
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,862
Bye, Bruno.

84
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,743
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

85
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,613
Here,
take the phone.

86
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,945
Wait for me
at the hotel.

87
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,179
- Here, you take this.
- No, you keep it.

88
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,380
Go ahead.

89
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,128
What took you so long?

90
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,769
Release him.

91
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,104
What, what?
Wait, wait.

92
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,906
What do you-
what do you think you're doing?

93
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,241
I'm releasing this man.

94
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,837
We have no evidence
he's committed any crime

95
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,177
in this country.

96
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,978
He's wanted in the
United States of the America.

97
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:05,011
<i>Do you have an
international arrest warrant?</i>

98
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,024
I'm sure we do,
back at the office.

99
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,060
But you don't
have it here.

100
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,824
Sir,
you're free to go.

101
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,331
Thank you.

102
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,765
See ya around,
Ricky boy.

103
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,427
Wait, you can't
release him!

104
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,562
I've been chasing
him for 5 years!

105
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,900
You bring me
the right paperwork,

106
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,463
I'll pick him up
for you.

107
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,803
How much is he
paying you?

108
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,138
You're under arrest.

109
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,473
Arrest me?
Arrest you!

110
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,807
How much are
they paying you?!

111
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,313
Take him away.

112
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,678
Ugh!

113
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,226
Well, that didn't
take long.

114
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:57,172
We need to be packed up
and out of here in 5 minutes.

115
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,675
Let's go.

116
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,853
<i>Where is it?</i>

117
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,188
There isn't any more.

118
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,523
You've got
to get me some.

119
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,529
Next week you'll have enough
to dive into head first,

120
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,531
but rig ht now I need you to
pull yourself together.

121
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,930
<i>We have to get
out of here.</i>

122
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,730
Don't you care
that I'm hurting?

123
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,465
Come on, Mimi,
I don't have time to explain!

124
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,730
It's been longer
than a half-hour.

125
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,428
You should consider
yourself lucky

126
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,368
<i>that they're letting
you go at all.</i>

127
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,998
<i>You punched
a police inspector.</i>

128
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:20,567
Yeah, well,
he was corrupt.

129
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,704
You try pulling it.

130
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,742
Where's my gun?

131
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:31,482
<i>It's con?scated.</i>

132
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:36,823
But here's your flight
to Los Angeles.

133
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,360
It's a condition
of your release.

134
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:46,369
<i>And if you ever want this back,
you will get on that plane.</i>

135
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,497
I'm not letting him
slip away again.

136
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:53,032
He's long gone.

137
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,205
I'll see about that.

138
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,947
Get back here.

139
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,646
Get back-

140
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,254
Consider yourself suspended.

141
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,729
<i>Ah, Special Agent Caperna,</i>

142
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:25,640
<i>or should! say former
Special Agent Caperna?</i>

143
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,678
Can I get you a drink?

144
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,914
No, thanks.

145
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,643
That's rig ht.

146
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,946
You don't drink.
You don't smoke.

147
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,509
You don't gamble.

148
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:41,854
Your only vice is your
hatred of drug dealers.

149
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:47,523
<i>I'm just wondering what you
plan to offer me for Bruno.</i>

150
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:53,593
You're under suspension, so you
can't offer me legal immunity.

151
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,539
You don't have a gun,
so you can't threaten me.

152
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,544
<i>Ha, ha, ha.</i>

153
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,239
Cheer up,
today's your lucky day.

154
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:07,250
Mr. McGrilly has outlived
his usefulness for me

155
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:11,220
<i>so I can offer you a sizable
discount in the hopes that we</i>

156
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:17,250
can have a more permanent
relationship in the future.

157
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:28,362
This is on the house.

158
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:48,687
<i>Sometimes
I just love my job.</i>

159
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,194
<i>Ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha.</i>

160
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,732
Have you seen Chris?

161
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,615
<i>It's coming.</i>

162
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,983
Yeah.

163
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:30,521
It'll be here
in a couple hours.

164
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,563
I'll be with you soon.

165
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,457
Dad-

166
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,502
One way or another.

167
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,735
<i>Christopher!</i>

168
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,670
Christopher!

169
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,581
Christopher!

170
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,885
Christopher-

171
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,898
You're impossible.

172
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,628
Aroon took the rest of the
staff to the evacuation center.

173
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,537
He'll be back for
us in 20 minutes.

174
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,667
<i>I'm not going.</i>

175
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:23,703
The storm is gonna
tear this place apart.

176
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:43,356
Well, I'm going, but not
to the evacuation center.

177
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:47,561
I'm going to Bangkok.

178
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:52,871
I'm gonna take the first
flight out to New York

179
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,903
and I'm gonna
file for divorce.

180
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:05,745
<i>Helen, reopen our
house in Los Angeles, huh?</i>

181
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:11,290
Community property laws
are better there.

182
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:32,805
It's okay.

183
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,852
We're not gonna
get divorced.

184
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,990
I have something
else in mind.

185
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:09,018
<i>Don't give up hope.</i>

186
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,963
Don't worry, son.

187
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:37,235
She'll get over it,

188
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:40,539
same way she
got over you.

189
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,689
<i>Put the gun down.</i>

190
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:16,436
You okay, baby?

191
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:20,450
<i>Mimi?</i>

192
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,653
Ric's gonna be there.

193
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:33,356
Just let him take out Bruno
and then you kill him,

194
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,059
and then it's
all yours, Charlie.

195
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,328
Who is it?

196
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:44,431
<i>It's no one, just a girl.</i>

197
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,032
Which one?

198
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:48,669
You mean they have
individual names?

199
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,482
Are you an American?

200
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,848
Yeah, what are
you doing here?

201
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,181
<i>My name is Ric Caperna.</i>

202
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,654
I'm special agent with the
Drug Enforcement Administration.

203
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,985
You have any
guests here now?

204
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,653
No, we evacuated our guests
yesterday and our staff today.

205
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,990
Can you
show me around?

206
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,429
Sure, this way.

207
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:10,319
<i>Charlie,
check out the place.</i>

208
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,190
Get down!

209
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,195
<i>Helen, we've
gotta get out of here.</i>

210
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:38,298
<i>Ric, don't make
me hurt these nice people</i>

211
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,905
<i>Put the gun down, Ric.
Come on.</i>

212
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,090
<i>Put your gun down!</i>

213
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,920
<i>Come on.</i>

214
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,813
<i>That's right.</i>

215
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,780
<i>Not so tight, Charlie.</i>

216
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:10,258
<i>I'd hate for Ric
to be uncomfortable.</i>

217
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:13,296
May I ask
what's going on?

218
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:18,528
What's going on
is irrelevant.

219
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,571
What you really want to know
is if you and your wife

220
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:25,574
are gonna be safe,
and the answer is yes,

221
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,305
provided you do exactly
as you're told.

222
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,313
What about him?

223
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,645
Let me worry
about him.

224
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,981
You ought to be worrying
about yourself, Bruno.

225
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,349
Shut up, Caperna.

226
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,018
Charlie!

227
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:52,257
Ricky boy, behave yourself.

228
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:55,237
You might just survive
this afternoon.

229
00:34:55,293 --> 00:35:00,538
Look,
let's all be friends.

230
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,944
<i>I'm Bruno.</i>

231
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:06,175
My wife, Mimi.

232
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:09,879
<i>The over-eager,
Ric Caperna.</i>

233
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,219
<i>My good friend Charlie.</i>

234
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,020
And who are you?

235
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:20,223
<i>Chris.
This is my wife, Helen.</i>

236
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,559
<i>This your place?</i>

237
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,793
- Yeah.
- Oh, nice.

238
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,028
You did very nice.

239
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,367
Don't worry,
we're not staying long.

240
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,804
A few hours at most.

241
00:35:54,052 --> 00:36:00,833
<i>III</i>

242
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,964
Chris, come here.

243
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:05,337
Come here.

244
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,678
Yeah, okay.

245
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,746
Any of your staff
still around?

246
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,117
No.

247
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,054
You see that guy,
right?

248
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:36,962
Who is he?

249
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,237
The angel of death.

250
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:45,077
He was here before the tsunami.
Now he's back again.

251
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,809
Angel of death, huh?

252
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,817
All right, go sit down.
Go ahead. Thanks.

253
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,147
I'm gonna
take care of this.

254
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,188
Yeah, be careful,
will ya?

255
00:36:57,082 --> 00:37:00,495
<i>What's wrong?</i>

256
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,532
We're gonna die.

257
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:08,427
It's not them
I'm worried about.

258
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:27,553
<i>Sit down.
Just sit down.</i>

259
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,592
<i>Have a seat, please.</i>

260
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:44,641
Hi, Mimi.

261
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:50,841
How'd you know
her name?

262
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,404
<i>He knew mine too.</i>

263
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,778
Hey.

264
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,049
<i>Who are you?</i>

265
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,219
I am that I am.

266
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,021
You work for Kamal?

267
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:07,222
<i>Let's ask an expert.</i>

268
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:12,735
<i>Do I look like
a drug dealer, Ric?</i>

269
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,399
Deville.

270
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,874
<i>So that's where you got
your information, huh?</i>

271
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,274
<i>Deville.</i>

272
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:23,176
<i>You sold me out.</i>

273
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:27,808
Your so-called friend has
only one love: bloodshed.

274
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:33,481
And if he has his way,
none of you will survive today.

275
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:36,287
- Let me kill this creep now.
- No, no, Charlie, no, no.

276
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:37,793
<i>We don't even know him.</i>

277
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,795
No, we don't.

278
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,592
You have to nothing
to fear from me, Chris.

279
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:45,362
I'm not the
angel of death.

280
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,960
<i>Ask your wife, Helen.</i>

281
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:49,699
<i>She knows me.</i>

282
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,900
I've never
seen you before.

283
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:55,877
<i>Well, that's
true you've never seen me,</i>

284
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:59,177
but on the 137th day
of your 12th year,

285
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:03,447
you gave your life to me,
small Presbyterian church

286
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:08,150
<i>on Hartford Road
and Evergreen Avenue.</i>

287
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:12,161
<i>Oh, since then you allowed
yourself to become</i>

288
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:15,721
<i>a little strangled
by the cares of this world</i>

289
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:20,327
<i>and the deceitfulness
of human wealth,</i>

290
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:26,239
<i>but I never lost
sight of you, Helen.</i>

291
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:30,268
<i>And I know the day is coming
when you will ?ourish.</i>

292
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,109
<i>Come on, Bruno, let me
pop this guy now He's a loony.</i>

293
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,849
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Charlie, please.

294
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,721
<i>Don't pretend you've
never heard my voice, Charlie,</i>

295
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,055
though it was
always filtered

296
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,823
through your mother
and grandmother.

297
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,421
<i>When you came forward
in your 9th year;</i>

298
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:52,093
<i>you loved the smiles
on their faces,</i>

299
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:56,663
but your heart proved to be
such rocky soil, Charlie.

300
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:02,269
<i>Your friends called you sissy,
and you just caved in.</i>

301
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:06,304
<i>You were always very prideful,
Charlie, even as a kid.</i>

302
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,419
All right, come on.

303
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:14,457
What's your game,
pal, huh?

304
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,321
You work for
Deville or not?

305
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:22,161
No, I don't work for Deville,
nor does Deville work for me.

306
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,066
<i>He was outside the prison
yesterday when I was released</i>

307
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:29,230
<i>You used
the wrong verb tense, Ric.</i>

308
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,433
I wasn't outside
the jail yesterday.

309
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:37,845
I am outside the jail now,
even as we speak.

310
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:44,751
<i>The same way that I am on the
street outside Deville's of?ce.</i>

311
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:50,191
Tell Charlie how you saw me,
"the bearded white guy. "

312
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,159
I don't know what I saw,

313
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:56,363
and I'm tired
of playing 20-Questions.

314
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:57,729
Who are you?

315
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:05,537
<i>III</i>

316
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:06,905
I'm Jesus.

317
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,143
<i>Chris t.</i>

318
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:18,186
<i>Yeah, and I'm
the Virgin Mary.</i>

319
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,299
That's it. That's it.
I've had enough.

320
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:31,629
Calm down.
Calm down.

321
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:32,963
What do you mean
calm down?!

322
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:36,233
It's obvious he's escaped
from the local loony bin.

323
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:39,104
You know, you're lucky
my mother's not here.

324
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:42,543
She wouldn't let anyone
blaspheme, not even me.

325
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,706
You're right, your mother's
a very Godly woman

326
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:50,719
and she prays for you to come
to me every day, Charlie.

327
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:53,085
Don't break your
mother's heart, Charlie.

328
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:55,055
Shut up!
Just shut up!

329
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,093
Give me your gun,
Charlie.

330
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,650
<i>Give me your gun.</i>

331
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,494
<i>Who is it?</i>

332
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,862
Wrong number.

333
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:20,906
Chris, you've done a great
job of restoring this hotel.

334
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:27,385
It was Helen.

335
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:30,551
If I had my way,
I would have left it a ruin,

336
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:33,824
<i>a monument
to God's cruelty.</i>

337
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:38,231
Do you think that's
the way Timothy sees it?

338
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:42,965
<i>Anywhere he looked,
he saw my love.</i>

339
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,667
I don't wanna
talk about him.

340
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,734
<i>It's not true, Chris.</i>

341
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,771
You've been wanting to talk
to me about him for years.

342
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,487
You know, if you were
who you say you are,

343
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:01,524
I'd punch you
square in the face.

344
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,052
What happened?

345
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:11,533
<i>Our son was killed
in the tsunami in 2004.</i>

346
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,125
<i>That's terrible.</i>

347
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:17,196
<i>How old was he?</i>

348
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,537
He was 22.

349
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,838
<i>$0 young.</i>

350
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,109
<i>I don't think
I could bear that.</i>

351
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,309
The only thing you can do
is just remind yourself

352
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,216
that the pain
isn't real.

353
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:36,489
<i>Mimi spent time in a
monastery where she was taught</i>

354
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:40,256
<i>that all pain and suffering
are illusions.</i>

355
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:43,788
Isn't that right, Mimi?

356
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:45,163
Yes.

357
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:52,936
Mimi, do you believe this pain
you're feeling now is real?

358
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:54,271
No.

359
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:56,608
Isn't real.

360
00:43:56,668 --> 00:44:00,707
But you feel it.

361
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:05,221
Only because I haven't
achieved enlightenment yet.

362
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:11,022
<i>Mimi, I am Jesus,</i>

363
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:13,153
and I'll never tell you
that you're not hurting

364
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:15,788
when you really are.

365
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:20,825
I don't deny your pain,
and I'll never ignore it.

366
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:28,238
I think it's better
if pain is just an illusion

367
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:31,405
because if I thought what
I was feeling was real,

368
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:34,211
I would kill myself.

369
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:37,276
<i>Hey, baby, you don't have
to live like this, you know?</i>

370
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,345
You can always
go back to rehab.

371
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:43,756
Maybe she needs
a reason to face reality.

372
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:46,762
What do you know?

373
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:49,128
I know pain.

374
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,861
It breaks my heart.

375
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:56,565
<i>My hope for humankind was never
pain, suffering, and death.</i>

376
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,741
<i>It's Kamal, your supplier.</i>

377
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:07,749
<i>He's running late
because of the storm.</i>

378
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,843
Oh, and don't worry
about the storm.

379
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,889
<i>It's going to hit further
north along the coast.</i>

380
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,960
This is him.

381
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,402
Will you still
be here today?

382
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:31,507
<i>Couple hours?</i>

383
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:38,875
I can't wait a couple hours.
I'm dying.

384
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,381
Look, I know you’re
hurting, baby.

385
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:43,612
Look-listen to me, you're
halfway through detox now.

386
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:46,416
If we stay the course
we can start again.

387
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:50,653
We can start again clean.

388
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:52,023
I'm gonna die!

389
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,063
You're not going to die!

390
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:10,645
What's wrong, Mimi?

391
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:15,013
He doesn't understand
how badly I hurt.

392
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,985
<i>That's too bad because
if he doesn't understand</i>

393
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:19,612
the depth of your pain,

394
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:25,059
he'll never appreciate
the height of your victory.

395
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,620
What is victory?

396
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,859
<i>Your triumph over drugs.</i>

397
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:34,836
And more importantly,
finally finding the peace

398
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:40,843
<i>and the security that you've
sought after your whole life.</i>

399
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,879
Can I tell them
about your life?

400
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:50,477
Mimi was born
in a tiny village.

401
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,145
You could say
that even from birth

402
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,214
she was a victim
of the drug trade.

403
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,190
<i>Her father worked
in the poppy fields</i>

404
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:01,924
<i>while her mother worked
in the processing plants.</i>

405
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,626
They had no choice.

406
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,828
We were so poor.

407
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:12,739
You either worked the fields
or you starved.

408
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:17,769
But-
they were good people.

409
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,372
They loved me.

410
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:23,817
They send me to school
at the monastery

411
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:27,151
<i>so I would have
a better life.</i>

412
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:28,849
<i>You loved it there.</i>

413
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:30,586
<i>Yes.</i>

414
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:32,628
<i>It's wonderful.</i>

415
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,495
<i>What happened?</i>

416
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:42,936
<i>Mimi's father
was wrongly accused</i>

417
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:46,840
by the drug lord
of stealing.

418
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:52,871
<i>The only payment
he would accept was Mimi.</i>

419
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,244
They dragged her out
of the monastery

420
00:47:57,308 --> 00:47:59,686
and sold her to
a Bangkok brothel.

421
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:02,691
<i>Don't tell them
about it, please.</i>

422
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:05,887
<i>I won't.</i>

423
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,930
<i>We skip to Bruno?</i>

424
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:14,631
<i>For Bruno, it was
love at first sight.</i>

425
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:39,646
<i>He couldn't bear
to see you working there,</i>

426
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:44,716
<i>so he bought you
from the gangster.</i>

427
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:04,313
At first I wasn't sure
what he was going to do.

428
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:09,613
Whether he would
be like the others.

429
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,620
I belong to him.

430
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:18,490
He can use me, beat me,
put me on the street,

431
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:23,726
but instead he freed me.

432
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:25,927
<i>And the drugs?</i>

433
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:31,463
<i>Dealers usually hook their
women so they can control ‘em.</i>

434
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,510
Isn't that right, Bruno?

435
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:41,107
Another word out of you,
I put a bullet in your head.

436
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:43,152
<i>It's about time.</i>

437
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:50,817
<i>Bruno wasn't to blame,</i>

438
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,292
not directly anyway.

439
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,860
Call it insecurity.

440
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:01,893
Bruno, Mimi never quite felt
comfortable around your friends.

441
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:08,335
They all look at me
like I was some dumb Bai girl.

442
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:13,144
When Bruno wasn't around,
then they talk about my accent,

443
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:18,950
the way I dress,
the way I walk, everything.

444
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:22,287
<i>You thought you'd be happy
if you were as sophisticated</i>

445
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:27,694
and worldly as they were.

446
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:30,631
<i>So when your friend Louise
invited you to do heroin</i>

447
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:34,101
<i>with her,
you couldn't say no.</i>

448
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:37,662
<i>You told yourself you couldn't
get hooked the first time,</i>

449
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:41,608
<i>especially if you
snorted it.</i>

450
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:46,114
<i>Louise was so smart
and so happy,</i>

451
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,150
<i>maybe you'd be too.</i>

452
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:56,084
<i>But it didn't last.</i>

453
00:51:56,147 --> 00:52:01,096
That hole in your heart,
it remains.

454
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,825
Stop romanticizing it.

455
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:06,868
<i>You think that helps?</i>

456
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:09,871
She's not an addict
because of some deep

457
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:14,706
phycological
or spiritual need.

458
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:17,302
She's an addict
because she used heroin.

459
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:19,507
It's that simple.

460
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:22,346
It's an addictive drug,
and once you start using it,

461
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:24,852
you can't stop.

462
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:27,947
That's why it's a
multibillion-dollar business.

463
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:30,117
<i>Why did she take
it in the ?rst place?</i>

464
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,218
Did you ever ask her?

465
00:52:33,284 --> 00:52:34,957
Are you blaming me?

466
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:36,521
Do you blame yourself?

467
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:37,861
No.

468
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:40,334
That's good.

469
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:44,567
Because even if Mimi
had never met you,

470
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,165
<i>despair would have eventually
driven her to drugs.</i>

471
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:50,235
<i>Her environment
was so corrupt.</i>

472
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:53,282
Did you know
Ric was a twin?

473
00:52:55,306 --> 00:52:56,717
You mean
there's two of them?

474
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:59,687
Was.

475
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:04,692
<i>She died when
they were just 18.</i>

476
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,091
<i>She?</i>

477
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:10,064
He's got a chick twin?

478
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,091
I guess his parents forgot
which one to put the dress on.

479
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:23,234
And Bruno, if he has his way,
he's going to kill you.

480
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:44,925
<i>Is that true, Ricky boy?</i>

481
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:49,062
Are you gonna kill me?

482
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:51,106
If there's any justice.

483
00:53:54,164 --> 00:54:00,137
Fortunately, Ric and I
define justice differently.

484
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,082
It's not my will that
any of you die today.

485
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:14,118
<i>I came to give you life,
life more abundantly.</i>

486
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:18,428
Tell that to my son.

487
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:23,461
Chris, does your
son still exist?

488
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:29,637
Helen, does he?

489
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:33,944
<i>That pan of you that hears
my voice knows deep inside</i>

490
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:37,110
<i>that Timothy is in a much
better and more glorious place,</i>

491
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:42,283
<i>and one day you'll be
reunited with him.</i>

492
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:46,021
That's why Chris
despises you.

493
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:48,689
<i>Your small
but lingering hope</i>

494
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:53,792
<i>that one day you'll
see Timothy again.</i>

495
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:56,201
<i>It's an affront to him.</i>

496
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,672
<i>He resents you for it.</i>

497
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:03,371
<i>In his eyes you traded
true pain and mourning</i>

498
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:06,608
<i>for some self-comforting
religious fantasy.</i>

499
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:12,985
In his eyes Timothy
just blinked away,

500
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:20,991
<i>never to be again, no heaven,
no hell, no nothing.</i>

501
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:25,898
But Chris, that's not a very
emotionally satisfying

502
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:28,766
kind of atheism, is it?

503
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:32,501
You can't rage against a void
because a void can't hear you.

504
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:34,474
A void can't be hurt
or punished.

505
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:35,805
You needed someone.

506
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:41,782
<i>You needed something to
direct all that anger at.</i>

507
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,512
You needed God.

508
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:47,545
I'll direct it against you
if you don't shut up!

509
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:57,859
<i>Chris, I wish
that you believed</i>

510
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:02,995
half of what you once
said you believed.

511
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:08,840
<i>Chris once was very publicly
proud of being a man of faith.</i>

512
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:11,903
<i>He could name it and claim it
with the best of them,</i>

513
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:16,918
so revered as one of the
company's moral compasses.

514
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:19,454
One that-

515
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:23,184
Oh, Chris had no problem

516
00:56:23,247 --> 00:56:27,491
marketing sub-prime
mortgage packages.

517
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,054
You knew they were bad
from the beginning.

518
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,498
That's nonsense!
Nonsense!

519
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,332
<i>I had plenty of them in
my own personal portfolio.</i>

520
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,373
<i>You sold them all
for a substantial pro?t</i>

521
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:40,705
before they collapsed.

522
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:45,042
<i>You used the pro?t to
help buy this hotel.</i>

523
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:48,083
<i>I thought! was a crook.</i>

524
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:57,484
It is easier for a camel to
pass through the eye of a needle

525
00:56:57,548 --> 00:57:02,520
<i>than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of God.</i>

526
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:09,295
Why don't you just
leave the guy alone?

527
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,236
Why don't you leave
Bruno alone?

528
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:12,603
<i>Yeah!</i>

529
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,244
Why are you treating me
like the bad guy?

530
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,804
You know how many people
his heroin kills every year?

531
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:23,818
Yes, and I know
every one of their names.

532
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:26,855
So you should hate him
as much as I do.

533
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,186
<i>Burl don't.</i>

534
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:32,693
Sadly, if he doesn't repent,
I will be forced

535
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:35,889
by that decision of his
to judge him.

536
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:40,332
But don't think that I take
pleasure in that, I don't.

537
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:44,134
So what are you saying?
He can go to heaven?

538
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:47,141
Yes, if he repents.

539
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:50,906
<i>I'd be thrilled.</i>

540
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:54,609
<i>Well, count me out then
because I ain't going anywhere</i>

541
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:58,953
where he's going except maybe
to prison to visit him.

542
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:05,221
<i>Ric, can I
ask you a question?</i>

543
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:07,387
Can I stop you?

544
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:14,027
Is all this anger
and hatred,

545
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:17,072
is it going to bring
your sister Michelle back?

546
00:58:24,535 --> 00:58:26,515
What happened to her?

547
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:33,618
<i>Overdose.</i>

548
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:34,951
<i>Heroin.</i>

549
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:49,696
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

550
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:11,415
That's rich
coming from you.

551
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,461
People like you
killed her.

552
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:25,706
<i>So now you're
going to kill him?</i>

553
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,742
<i>If that's what it takes.</i>

554
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:32,110
- To do what?
- To bring him to justice!

555
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:35,048
<i>Ric, you love
that word justice.</i>

556
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:36,379
<i>You don't know
what it means.</i>

557
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,717
<i>Justice has no place
for illegal wire-taps,</i>

558
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:42,450
planted evidence,
perjured testimony.

559
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:47,188
<i>Hey! I'm just trying to
level the playing field here.</i>

560
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,527
Guys like Bruno have
all the money they need

561
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:56,367
<i>to hire the best lawyers,
buy half the judges and juries.</i>

562
00:59:56,426 --> 01:00:01,500
<i>If we didn't cut some corners,
we wouldn't make case one.</i>

563
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:04,808
<i>The ends don't
justify the means.</i>

564
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:06,142
Says who?!

565
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,114
You?

566
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:11,415
Your way doesn't work.

567
01:00:11,475 --> 01:00:14,513
The meek didn't
inherit the earth.

568
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:20,654
They got chewed up
and spit out.

569
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,698
<i>Is your way working, Ric?</i>

570
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:30,672
Has all your anger
gotten you any peace?

571
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:33,708
<i>You haven't had one moment
of peace since the day</i>

572
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:39,237
you walked in the door and found
your sister Michelle like that.

573
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:41,783
<i>But it's not
too late, Ric.</i>

574
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:44,375
Behold me.

575
01:00:44,441 --> 01:00:49,288
<i>I stand at the door of
your heart, and I knock.</i>

576
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:05,562
<i>It's your supplier, again.</i>

577
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,004
This is him.

578
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,372
Hello?

579
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,153
Will you still
be here today?

580
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:23,291
<i>But you still will be
here today, right?</i>

581
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:30,127
Late r?

582
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,495
<i>All right.</i>

583
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,000
<i>Not til later.</i>

584
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:42,440
I don't like this,
Bruno.

585
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:44,638
This whole thing's
going south fast.

586
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,975
I mean, the storm.

587
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,175
Come on.
Who is this guy?

588
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:51,651
He knows too much.
He's dangerous.

589
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,484
I know.
I know.

590
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:59,459
He's the guy with the beard
I saw outside of Deville's.

591
01:01:59,516 --> 01:02:01,518
<i>He's not Jesus Christ.</i>

592
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:03,723
If you know what's good
for you, you'll go over there

593
01:02:03,787 --> 01:02:06,927
and put a bullet in his head
right now, right now.

594
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,209
You Okay?

595
01:02:25,676 --> 01:02:27,747
Mimi?
Mimi?

596
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:31,588
I'm dying, Bruno.

597
01:02:31,648 --> 01:02:33,628
<i>Got to help me.</i>

598
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:47,567
No, trust me.

599
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:50,134
She can go into
cardiac arrest.

600
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,646
Trust me.

601
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:27,438
<i>Mimi, I know
what you really want.</i>

602
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:36,389
This can maybe heal you
for a couple of hours,

603
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:41,327
but I can heal you
for eternity.

604
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:47,062
Which will it be?

605
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,330
Eternity.

606
01:04:20,924 --> 01:04:25,236
How do you feel?

607
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:27,275
Healed.

608
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,010
<i>Am I healed forever?</i>

609
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:39,281
Your body is healed,
but not your soul.

610
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,754
Can you heal that too?

611
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:44,485
Yeah.

612
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:48,324
And unlike what you learned
at that monastery,

613
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:52,127
<i>I won't force you to suffer
through a thousand lifetimes</i>

614
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:56,160
<i>of war and sorrow
and death.</i>

615
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:02,132
The work has already
been done.

616
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:04,702
Do you know howl died,
Mimi, on the cross?

617
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:09,444
Have you ever
heard of that?

618
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:12,487
Do you know what
I did there?

619
01:05:14,845 --> 01:05:18,759
I sacrificed myself
for your sins,

620
01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:21,762
for the sins
of the world.

621
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:24,958
I took it all
upon myself.

622
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:29,993
<i>I paid the penalty so
that you don't have to.</i>

623
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:40,038
Mimi, today, if you
desire, you are free.

624
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:45,214
What do I have to do?

625
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,653
Believe in me.

626
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:52,182
Trust me.

627
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:55,354
I do.

628
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:57,329
I know you do.

629
01:05:57,387 --> 01:06:03,235
I can see inside
your heart.

630
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:05,273
Mimi...

631
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:10,277
Today you are my precious,

632
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,677
precious daughter.

633
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:45,940
You see,
never give up hope.

634
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:08,129
<i>Bruno, I've been healed.</i>

635
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:09,727
I feel it.

636
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,100
Oh, that's terrific.

637
01:07:11,161 --> 01:07:12,799
I know it's true.

638
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,899
Oh, that's great,
baby.

639
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:17,410
That's great.

640
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:19,242
<i>Bruno.</i>

641
01:07:19,302 --> 01:07:22,749
Listen-

642
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:25,342
would you get me
some coffee?

643
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:26,682
- Sure.
- Yeah?

644
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:29,383
- Yeah.
- Okay.

645
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:31,322
You got a kitchen
here, right?

646
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:32,655
Yeah.

647
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,059
<i>Would you
mind just, you know</i>

648
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:36,222
getting some coffee,
some sandwiches?

649
01:07:36,286 --> 01:07:38,892
You know, we're gonna be
here a couple hours more.

650
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:43,233
Don't worry.
I'll pay you.

651
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:46,638
<i>You know just treat us
like any other guests</i>

652
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:49,939
who held you hostage.

653
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:57,582
<i>We need to talk.</i>

654
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,142
<i>Yeah, everything's
under control.</i>

655
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:00,483
<i>Go with them, huh?</i>

656
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:02,989
Make sure
she stays healed.

657
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:08,046
<i>III</i>

658
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:18,463
You still smiling, huh?

659
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:19,836
Have a seat.

660
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:31,548
You know, under normal
circumstances,

661
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:38,457
any man who messes
with my wife's mind dies.

662
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:43,897
<i>But since you managed
to calm her down,</i>

663
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:48,329
I'm gonna give you
a pass this time.

664
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:51,861
Bruno, what do you think
just happened?

665
01:08:51,928 --> 01:08:57,606
Was it just words?
Or did she really change?

666
01:08:57,667 --> 01:09:00,580
You never experienced
firsthand

667
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:06,212
the destruction that
your product causes

668
01:09:06,276 --> 01:09:08,620
<i>until Mimi.</i>

669
01:09:41,711 --> 01:09:47,184
You are sorry, Bruno,
but sorry isn't enough.

670
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:01,404
What do you expect
me to do?

671
01:10:01,464 --> 01:10:04,445
He's not gonna stop.

672
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:12,442
I am ready
to forgive you.

673
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:16,480
The price is true
repentance.

674
01:10:19,783 --> 01:10:22,389
This is my last deal.

675
01:10:22,452 --> 01:10:24,796
I'm getting out
of this.

676
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:27,357
<i>That's good.</i>

677
01:10:27,424 --> 01:10:30,371
<i>You should walk away.</i>

678
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:36,309
<i>But Bruno, is walking away
going to make you clean?</i>

679
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:42,943
<i>Did it work for you,
Chris?</i>

680
01:10:43,506 --> 01:10:48,114
You're comparing me
to him now?

681
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:49,680
<i>I was a respectable
businessman.</i>

682
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:52,488
He's a criminal.

683
01:10:52,549 --> 01:10:54,551
Yet, you walked away
from your work.

684
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:56,494
Why?

685
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,429
Because I had enough.

686
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:01,401
I was sick of the greed
and materialism.

687
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:03,459
Whose Chris?

688
01:11:03,526 --> 01:11:05,028
<i>Society's or yours?</i>

689
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,597
Does it matter?

690
01:11:07,664 --> 01:11:10,804
<i>I knew it was wrong
and I left.</i>

691
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:12,278
<i>Who told
you it was wrong?</i>

692
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:14,576
No one, I just knew.

693
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:18,107
<i>No, you didn't,</i>

694
01:11:18,174 --> 01:11:24,284
not until you walked in front
of the wrong mirror, Chris.

695
01:11:24,347 --> 01:11:27,021
Timothy.

696
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:29,529
What are you
talking about?

697
01:11:29,586 --> 01:11:33,693
You loved being the moral
compass of your company,

698
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:39,502
but then Timothy gave his life
to me and everything changed.

699
01:11:39,562 --> 01:11:44,875
His faith was so alive,
so vibrant, so selfless

700
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:47,505
<i>that you knew deep inside
you didn't really believe</i>

701
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:50,107
what he believed-

702
01:11:50,173 --> 01:11:54,144
that your God
wasn't God at all,

703
01:11:57,213 --> 01:12:03,186
and that what you really
worshiped was success.

704
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:09,063
If I really worshiped
success,

705
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:12,436
<i>why'd I throw it all away
and come here, huh?</i>

706
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:15,499
It's the ultimate show
of success,

707
01:12:15,565 --> 01:12:21,447
thumbing your nose at
cut-throat corporate greed

708
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:25,543
<i>and coming here to sit
on a beach in paradise,</i>

709
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:30,853
<i>proving once and for all
your moral superiority.</i>

710
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:34,690
<i>Am I right?</i>

711
01:12:34,751 --> 01:12:39,791
<i>I'm not answering
any more of your questions.</i>

712
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:42,097
Neither can I answer
your question.

713
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:45,537
Which is?

714
01:12:45,595 --> 01:12:48,405
"Why did my son die?"

715
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,332
<i>How much longer?</i>

716
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,369
I'm almost done.

717
01:13:26,636 --> 01:13:28,877
Tell me something.

718
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:32,818
Are we in danger?

719
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:36,482
You and your husband
and Jesus are okay,

720
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:40,187
but I'm worried
about the policeman.

721
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,162
I have to trust
Jesus about him.

722
01:13:43,219 --> 01:13:46,098
He's not really Jesus.

723
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:47,862
Yes, he is.

724
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:50,564
Look at me.
I'm healed!

725
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,765
He says you know him too
when you were 12.

726
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:59,508
When I was 12...
... everything seemed possible,

727
01:13:59,569 --> 01:14:03,608
even a God who took an active
interest in everything you did.

728
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:05,949
You don't believe
that any more?

729
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:09,285
No, I don't.

730
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:13,760
And even if I did, what
difference does it make?

731
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:19,823
Where do you go when
the worst thing happens?

732
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:22,392
I lost a son.

733
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:39,779
I get it.

734
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,600
Do you want something?

735
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:56,966
<i>Thank you.</i>

736
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:06,345
Can I untie him so I can
give him something to eat?

737
01:15:06,402 --> 01:15:09,679
<i>What do you say, Jesus?</i>

738
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:13,152
Can I trust him
to behave himself?

739
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:17,021
<i>You know the
answer to that question.</i>

740
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:18,888
<i>You bet I do.</i>

741
01:15:18,948 --> 01:15:22,896
<i>If he wants something,
give it to him there.</i>

742
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:31,038
<i>Is that what it's
gonna take to stop you?</i>

743
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:38,774
Tell him, Jesus.

744
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:42,441
<i>It was never my intention
to kill him.</i>

745
01:15:42,505 --> 01:15:48,478
I'd be more than happy
if you had just walked away.

746
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,524
Live and let live, Ric.

747
01:15:56,953 --> 01:15:58,694
But you're going
to kill him now.

748
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,028
<i>No!</i>

749
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:02,330
<i>Don't listen to him.</i>

750
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:08,103
I'm gonna let Ricky boy sit
right there, tied to that chair

751
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:10,144
as we go on
our merry way.

752
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:17,409
<i>Knowing full well
that Kamal will do it.</i>

753
01:16:17,473 --> 01:16:21,649
It's not my responsibility
what happens after we leave.

754
01:16:21,711 --> 01:16:26,751
Yes, Bruno, it is.

755
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:28,853
What do you expect
me to do?

756
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,091
He's not gonna stop.

757
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:33,633
Give yourself up.

758
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,930
It's not fair.

759
01:16:35,992 --> 01:16:38,472
<i>Is it fair that I
had to leave heavenly glory</i>

760
01:16:38,528 --> 01:16:42,874
<i>to bear the punishment
for your sins?</i>

761
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:46,004
<i>No, it wasn't fair.</i>

762
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:50,279
But Bruno, sometimes
love trumps fairness.

763
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:54,310
Bruno, I've been waiting all
your life for the moment

764
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:59,952
when you would finally lay down
the burden of all the sins

765
01:17:00,016 --> 01:17:01,996
that you've committed.

766
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:09,764
<i>It weighs so heavy
on you, Bruno.</i>

767
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:12,806
<i>Give that burden to me.</i>

768
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:14,842
<i>I'll take it for you.</i>

769
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:20,372
I can't.

770
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,313
<i>I can't.</i>

771
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:28,317
<i>I don't know why you
went through all that trouble.</i>

772
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:32,348
I could have told you
what he was gonna say.

773
01:17:45,461 --> 01:17:48,408
Don't say it.

774
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:50,967
Say what?

775
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:52,671
That I should do it.

776
01:17:57,306 --> 01:18:03,746
If I go with him,
I could end up injail.

777
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:06,794
Maybe you have to
go to jail to be free.

778
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:11,831
I love you.

779
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,869
Then do it for me,
please.

780
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:29,783
<i>I told you he wasn't
gonna fall for your line.</i>

781
01:18:33,576 --> 01:18:34,919
It's very hard
to except the truth

782
01:18:34,977 --> 01:18:38,948
when you've been living
a lie all your life.

783
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:50,527
<i>Sometimes it's easier
just to die.</i>

784
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:52,834
Isn't that rig ht,
Chris?

785
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:56,104
I never lived a lie.

786
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:59,146
<i>But you
are ready to die.</i>

787
01:19:01,604 --> 01:19:05,643
One of the saddest
things that I see

788
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:10,919
is the way couples tear each
other apart in anger and guilt

789
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:15,326
instead of pulling together
when they lose a child.

790
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:19,764
<i>I tried.</i>

791
01:19:19,822 --> 01:19:24,464
But he built this
little shrine to Tim,

792
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:27,508
and he didn't let anybody
else in, not even me.

793
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:34,472
Helen, your marriage wasn't
going to end in divorce.

794
01:19:34,537 --> 01:19:37,074
<i>If you don't like the way
we react to children's deaths,</i>

795
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:39,050
stop killing them!

796
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:58,199
<i>Are you going
to tell her, or am I?</i>

797
01:19:58,261 --> 01:20:03,261
<i>III</i>

798
01:20:08,404 --> 01:20:13,376
Chris was going to
take his life today.

799
01:20:15,578 --> 01:20:20,049
He was going to wait
for the storm to hit

800
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:27,733
<i>and then walk out
into the waves</i>

801
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:30,771
<i>and shoot himself.</i>

802
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,811
<i>Is that true?</i>

803
01:20:41,904 --> 01:20:44,885
You were gonna
do that to me?

804
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,849
I wasn't doing it
to you.

805
01:20:49,912 --> 01:20:55,157
After everything that we've
been through with Tim,

806
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:59,996
you were gonna
do that to me?

807
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:01,534
I wasn't.

808
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,661
That's so selfish.

809
01:21:03,726 --> 01:21:05,364
Just get off me!

810
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:07,634
No, come on, Helen!

811
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,004
Please!

812
01:21:10,132 --> 01:21:12,112
<i>I talk to her.</i>

813
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:17,613
<i>You want
me to stop her?</i>

814
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:19,914
<i>No.</i>

815
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:29,529
I didn't want
to hurt her.

816
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:31,565
<i>I know.</i>

817
01:21:39,462 --> 01:21:41,442
Why did Tim have to die?

818
01:21:45,968 --> 01:21:48,710
He died for you.

819
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:11,438
Helen, are you okay?

820
01:22:14,897 --> 01:22:16,205
No.

821
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:24,716
Everything I had
is gone.

822
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:28,244
But you have hope.

823
01:22:50,566 --> 01:22:54,605
Your son was
a fine young man

824
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:57,776
<i>and loved me
very much.</i>

825
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:04,553
His goal was to share me
with the whole world.

826
01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:07,890
Then why'd you
take him?

827
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:12,399
<i>Chris, you keep
crediting me with his death,</i>

828
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:15,264
but that's not the case.

829
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:18,635
<i>I created
a perfect world,</i>

830
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:25,669
<i>paradise without death
or disease, any of those things.</i>

831
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:30,809
Then I created man.

832
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:36,346
<i>I gave him a wondrous
but very dangerous gift:</i>

833
01:23:36,412 --> 01:23:39,655
free will.

834
01:23:39,715 --> 01:23:44,164
And soon paradise
was lost

835
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:49,134
<i>and fell to murder,
war, greed,</i>

836
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:53,640
<i>pride, terrible things,</i>

837
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:58,543
all of which sprung
from the heart of man.

838
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:02,173
<i>I didn't create
one of them.</i>

839
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:04,217
But you let ‘em happen?

840
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:09,218
Yes.

841
01:24:10,012 --> 01:24:12,822
But you're not responsible?

842
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,919
I gave you freewill.

843
01:24:15,985 --> 01:24:18,192
What a cop-out!

844
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:21,564
If I sawa guy raping
a girl in an alley,

845
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:23,660
<i>I could never live
with myself if I didn't</i>

846
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:26,104
<i>do something about it.</i>

847
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:27,606
But you're just
fine with it?

848
01:24:27,663 --> 01:24:29,301
No.

849
01:24:29,365 --> 01:24:33,472
<i>I cry a billion rears
across the world every day.</i>

850
01:24:33,536 --> 01:24:35,777
Then why don't you
do anything about it?

851
01:24:35,838 --> 01:24:40,583
I did, 2,000 years ago
on a wooden cross,

852
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:43,248
and I continue today
crying out into the hearts

853
01:24:43,312 --> 01:24:46,725
and the consciences of
every man and every woman,

854
01:24:46,782 --> 01:24:49,763
the same way
I'm crying out to you.

855
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:55,657
<i>Light has come
into the world,</i>

856
01:24:55,724 --> 01:25:00,195
but the oh-so-tragic
reality

857
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:04,335
<i>is that men
love the darkness.</i>

858
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,711
<i>Ultimately, I take every bit
of it and I turn it around</i>

859
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:12,149
<i>for the bene?t of my
Father's kingdom.</i>

860
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:19,056
<i>How did my son's
death bene?t your kingdom?</i>

861
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:22,095
By bringing you into it.

862
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:34,096
<i>Chris, Timothy knew that
you didn't really believe in me.</i>

863
01:25:35,764 --> 01:25:39,735
<i>He became very concerned
for your soul.</i>

864
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:48,689
The tsunami.

865
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:57,262
When man fell in
the Garden of Eden,

866
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:00,732
the whole world
fell with him.

867
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:05,465
Disasters like the
tsunami are all echoes

868
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:10,374
of that initial cataclysm.

869
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:17,008
<i>But remember,
I never let evil win.</i>

870
01:26:17,072 --> 01:26:19,518
And so I'm here,

871
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:24,422
answering the prayers
of a wonderful young son.

872
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:30,487
<i>For his beloved father,
that one day he would come</i>

873
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:33,965
<i>into a relationship
with me.</i>

874
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:37,492
New life in me.

875
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:48,809
<i>Bring him back, please.</i>

876
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:54,287
<i>Chris, I can bring him back.</i>

877
01:26:54,343 --> 01:26:57,756
But if you could see
what he's seeing now,

878
01:26:57,813 --> 01:27:01,226
if you could feel
what he's feeling,

879
01:27:01,283 --> 01:27:04,389
<i>you wouldn't even dream
of calling him back</i>

880
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:09,630
<i>to this fallen world,
not even for a second</i>

881
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:16,006
<i>And I guarantee you,
if you put your faith in me,</i>

882
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:23,004
you'll be reunited with
Timothy forever... there.

883
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,819
I will.

884
01:27:42,024 --> 01:27:43,332
I will.

885
01:27:44,126 --> 01:27:49,126
<i>III</i>

886
01:27:55,504 --> 01:28:00,385
So sorry I haven't
been there for you.

887
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:02,718
Can you forgive me?

888
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:05,088
Only if you can
forgive me.

889
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:26,072
Thank you, Lord.

890
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:30,276
<i>It's nice to hear
you call me Lord again.</i>

891
01:28:30,339 --> 01:28:34,082
<i>Don't lose it.</i>

892
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:44,931
<i>I have so much in store
for you both.</i>

893
01:28:48,123 --> 01:28:53,505
<i>Oh, now ain't that sweet?</i>

894
01:28:53,562 --> 01:28:56,702
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

895
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:59,143
I worry about you.

896
01:28:59,201 --> 01:29:00,942
<i>Haven't you ever felt
there was something missing</i>

897
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:03,108
in your life?

898
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,117
Nothing he can offer me.

899
01:29:05,174 --> 01:29:06,482
<i>Amen.</i>

900
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:11,953
Don't you find it odd
to find yourself

901
01:29:12,014 --> 01:29:14,995
<i>in agreement
with Charlie?</i>

902
01:29:18,053 --> 01:29:20,033
Not on that.

903
01:29:25,994 --> 01:29:27,268
Charlie Doles.

904
01:29:27,329 --> 01:29:28,637
Shut up!

905
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:34,044
<i>I don't need you reading back
a list of my so-called sins.</i>

906
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:37,811
Let's just stick to the first
man I killed: Dwayne Weiss.

907
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:39,819
You were 15 years old.

908
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:43,118
<i>Yeah, and if
you know that much,</i>

909
01:29:43,178 --> 01:29:45,658
<i>then you know the
last words he spoke.</i>

910
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:49,958
"Please, God, don't. "

911
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:54,092
He called me God.

912
01:29:54,156 --> 01:29:56,136
<i>He wasn't
referring to you.</i>

913
01:29:56,191 --> 01:29:58,865
Oh, yeah?
You sure about that?

914
01:29:58,927 --> 01:30:01,066
I was the only man in
that room with the power

915
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:04,201
to let him live
or let him die.

916
01:30:04,266 --> 01:30:05,836
<i>Isn't that what being
God is all about?</i>

917
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:11,613
Having the power
over life and death?

918
01:30:11,673 --> 01:30:17,021
Bruno used to be a great
god until he got weak

919
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:19,355
and started
being merciful,

920
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:22,452
letting people live
who should have died.

921
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:26,431
<i>And that's why we're in
this situation we're in now</i>

922
01:30:26,488 --> 01:30:29,196
<i>You're in this
situation you are now</i>

923
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:33,967
because I wanted to give you
another chance at salvation.

924
01:30:34,029 --> 01:30:35,804
<i>Don't you worry about me.</i>

925
01:30:35,864 --> 01:30:37,844
You worry about yourself.

926
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:43,738
<i>Don't Charlie.</i>

927
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:46,285
Put the gun down.

928
01:30:46,341 --> 01:30:47,649
<i>No.</i>

929
01:30:49,678 --> 01:30:53,285
I've had enough of you.

930
01:30:53,348 --> 01:30:56,727
<i>You give me your gun.</i>

931
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:59,163
Give me your gun now.

932
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,451
Now give me the bag.

933
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:27,256
Didn't have to happen
this way, Bruno.

934
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,522
Yes, it did.

935
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:32,121
I couldn't go through
with the deal, Charlie.

936
01:31:32,187 --> 01:31:36,260
<i>Those days are over.</i>

937
01:31:36,325 --> 01:31:39,101
I'm going with him.

938
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,503
You're crazy.

939
01:31:40,562 --> 01:31:42,599
You're gonna spend the rest
of your life in jail.

940
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:45,474
Maybe.

941
01:31:45,534 --> 01:31:49,778
<i>But I don't think our Lord
would lead us astray.</i>

942
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:53,081
Maybe I have to go
to jail to be free.

943
01:31:53,141 --> 01:31:55,121
It would be
a small price to pay.

944
01:31:59,414 --> 01:32:02,884
<i>Your will be done.</i>

945
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:08,234
What happened
to you, man?

946
01:32:10,759 --> 01:32:14,639
Ric-

947
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:17,370
The moment has come.

948
01:32:17,432 --> 01:32:19,207
For what?

949
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:21,577
For you to decide if you're
going to follow my will

950
01:32:21,637 --> 01:32:25,608
to eternal life
or your own to destruction.

951
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:33,192
I think you know
the answer.

952
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:39,021
Would it affect
your answer to know

953
01:32:39,087 --> 01:32:43,763
that Michelle is with me?

954
01:32:43,825 --> 01:32:48,638
<i>Her tragic cause of death didn't
mean that she wasn't saved</i>

955
01:32:48,697 --> 01:32:50,335
Michelle accepted
that for herself

956
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:54,278
<i>when she was
14 years old.</i>

957
01:32:54,336 --> 01:32:58,546
<i>Now she stands in the very
presence of Father God himself.</i>

958
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:02,110
Her face glows with
joy and contentment

959
01:33:02,177 --> 01:33:05,181
<i>beyond comprehension.</i>

960
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:07,453
I want you to
see her there.

961
01:33:07,516 --> 01:33:11,054
If you surrender to me
and my will,

962
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:15,590
you will spend
eternity with her.

963
01:33:15,657 --> 01:33:18,297
Helen accepted me
as a child.

964
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:23,400
Today she was joined by
Chris, Mimi, even Bruno.

965
01:33:23,465 --> 01:33:26,844
Michelle was killed
by a heroin overdose,

966
01:33:26,902 --> 01:33:30,076
<i>but I promise you
hatred kills more people</i>

967
01:33:30,138 --> 01:33:32,744
<i>every year than heroin.</i>

968
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:35,378
<i>And it's the hardest
drug of all to kick.</i>

969
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:40,415
But I'll help you do it
if you embrace my love.

970
01:33:54,663 --> 01:33:56,643
Never

971
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:47,822
Sorry, Bruno.

972
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:57,127
Are you gonna be okay?

973
01:34:57,192 --> 01:35:01,231
<i>No, Mimi.</i>

974
01:35:01,296 --> 01:35:04,277
I'm not gonna make it.

975
01:35:09,137 --> 01:35:12,584
<i>Baby...</i>

976
01:35:12,641 --> 01:35:15,451
I love you.

977
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:18,252
I love you too.

978
01:35:18,313 --> 01:35:21,783
<i>It's gonna
be okay, Mimi.</i>

979
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:26,629
I'd rather die today
and live with you forever

980
01:35:26,688 --> 01:35:33,196
than go on the way
we were going.

981
01:35:33,261 --> 01:35:35,969
<i>I'm happy-</i>

982
01:35:44,806 --> 01:35:46,786
Bruno...

983
01:35:49,043 --> 01:35:54,043
<i>III</i>

984
01:36:04,059 --> 01:36:06,699
<i>Don't worry, Bruno.</i>

985
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:09,605
I'll take care of her.

986
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:02,782
Stay down, Caperna.

987
01:38:02,844 --> 01:38:05,051
I'm gonna send you
to meet your sister.

988
01:40:21,883 --> 01:40:23,191
<i>Ric.</i>

989
01:40:25,653 --> 01:40:27,291
Hey.

990
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:29,494
Great work, man.

991
01:40:29,557 --> 01:40:30,865
Thanks.

992
01:40:33,761 --> 01:40:39,837
You'll never believe this, but
Bruno actually kept a notebook.

993
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:42,313
<i>Has everything in it.</i>

994
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:47,820
<i>His suppliers, his customers,
old corrupt of?cials</i>

995
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:51,220
<i>in like a dozen
different countries.</i>

996
01:40:51,278 --> 01:40:55,249
It's gonna keep a lot of people
busy for a very long time.

997
01:40:58,086 --> 01:41:00,066
Are you up to
leading the team?

998
01:41:02,690 --> 01:41:05,500
It sounds like fun.

999
01:41:26,781 --> 01:41:29,455
I'm gonna have a lot
of fun with this one.

1000
01:41:29,517 --> 01:41:30,825
Ha, ha.

1001
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:36,093
<i>You had a lot
of fun with Bruno, too,</i>

1002
01:41:36,157 --> 01:41:38,137
but he came to me.

1003
01:41:40,461 --> 01:41:45,433
So did Helen
and Chris and Mimi.

1004
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,446
Everywhere they go,
they'll spread my love

1005
01:41:47,502 --> 01:41:51,473
<i>and shine a cleansing light
in your darkness.</i>

1006
01:41:56,677 --> 01:41:59,419
It's not over yet.
