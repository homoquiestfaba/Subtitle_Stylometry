God, dude,
this campus is awesome!

26
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:51,672
This is friggin' awesome.
Are you looking at this shit?

27
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:52,506
This is beautiful.

28
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,389
Do you go to school here?

29
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,614
No, I don't go to
school here. I'm too dumb.

30
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:58,769
But my best friend
from high school goes here.

31
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,682
Yeah, it's his 21st birthday and me and
my friend are going to surprise him.

32
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,650
- Whoa. Foaming.
- Uh...

33
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,563
- Wait, is that a beer?
- What? No. What are you talking about?

34
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:09,686
Honestly, man, I'm just so
psyched to see my friends, man.

35
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:11,775
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, here's the train station.

36
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,908
Yeah, dude,
that's him on the corner.

37
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,570
Yeah, can you just honk
your horn a little bit?

38
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:17,006
Yeah, thanks, man.

39
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,373
Hey, you fucking Jew,
get in the cab!

40
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,390
Dude, he is such a fucking tool.
What is he wearing?

41
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:25,372
I love him, but, like, he does
dress like a fucking tool.

42
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:26,957
- Miller! What's up, man?
- Yo, what's up?

43
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,626
- Come on, bring it in, baby.
- How you doing?

44
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:31,420
- Dude, how you fucking doing, dude?
- Good.

45
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:32,803
- You look fat.
- What?

46
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,471
- Yeah.
- I mean, I've had midterms.

47
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,091
- I've been stress eating a little bit.
- A little bit?

48
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:37,818
- A little bit.
- Dude, stop talking about your weight.

49
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:39,511
- How's Stanford? Good?
- Stanford's great. Honestly.

50
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:41,061
Actually, yeah,
how's Hakakiqua State?

51
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,807
- It's good, dude, I'm killing it. Yeah.
- Yeah? Kill it! Good.

52
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:46,567
Dude, how's your family?
And your sister?

53
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,270
- How's your sister?
- My sister? Why are you...?

54
00:03:48,305 --> 00:03:50,779
What? No reason.
I'm just checking in.

55
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,691
You don't have to check in.
She's my sister.

56
00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:54,241
She's 16 years old now.

57
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,799
OK, yeah, she's 16, but in
real life she's, like, 18.

58
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:59,323
No, in real life she's 16.
That's the whole thing.

59
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:01,217
And her Facebook photos
are fucking awesome.

60
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:03,076
Is that Cancun, where does she...?

61
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,997
You know, there's always this moment
right before I see you, where I'm like,

62
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:08,797
"Why haven't I seen Miller
in so long? It's ridiculous.

63
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,127
We should keep in better touch."
And then I see you and I'm like,

64
00:04:12,162 --> 00:04:14,796
"Oh, yeah, that's right,
he's a fucking idiot."

65
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:17,014
I'm just kidding, man, come on.

66
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,432
What if I said that
about your sister?

67
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,635
What if I was like, "I wanna fuck
Danielle." What would you say?

68
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,555
Dude, honestly, I would love
for you to fuck my sister.

69
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,022
- Really? Why?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,850
It would seriously be
an honor to my entire family

71
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:28,609
- if you fucked my sister.
- What?

72
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:31,021
I'll bet you five bucks that I fuck
your sister before you fuck my sister.

73
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:34,107
I bet you five bucks that I fuck my
sister before you fuck my sister.

74
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:36,568
I'll give you five bucks
if you fuck your sister.

75
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:39,036
OK, can we cool it
with the sister fucking?

76
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:42,199
This is your friend's place,
all right? Get out.

77
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:45,292
Oh, great. This is awesome.

78
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,746
- Jesus Christ, this place is quaint.
Thank you.

79
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:51,166
- Whoa! I don't know.
- Jesus! Who is that guy?

80
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,711
He's kind of a good dancer.

81
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,556
What's up,
VisionQuest? Boom.

82
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,719
Dude, if we're not as fucked up as
that guy in two hours, we have failed.

83
00:05:02,754 --> 00:05:04,363
I'd definitely wash
that hand if I were you.

84
00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:05,973
Did you see the headdress?
He's The Chief.

85
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:07,266
No, he's a street person, dude.

86
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,021
Nice tie. You look like
Jason Gordon-Levitz.

87
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,948
It's actually
Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

88
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,908
<i>I actually really like him
in 500 Days of Summer.</i>

89
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,778
- He's actually a really good actor.
- He is a really good actor.

90
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:21,380
Had a nice little
transitional period, right?

91
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:22,948
<i>- Third City from the Sun or...
- Yeah.</i>

92
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:24,613
JeffChang!
- Hey!

93
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:26,208
Yeah! What's up, bud?

94
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,391
Happy birthday,
you tiny yellow son of a bitch!

95
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:30,504
- Surprise, buddy!
- What are you guys doing here?

96
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,548
I want you to call your lame
friends and cancel your plans

97
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,586
because we're taking you out tonight
and melt your fucking face off!

98
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:38,053
- Yes. Yes, we are!
- No. Wait, no, no, wait!

99
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,507
- Your face will be fine.
- Guys! Miller, I'm not...

100
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:41,557
- Yeah, dude.
- Yeah!

101
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,573
- No, no, hey, guys.
- Wow, man, nice place!

102
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:45,519
- Guys, guys, guys, listen to me.
- What?

103
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,265
I really appreciate you coming
all the way down here, but...

104
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,725
Do you have any weed?
I smoked all mine on the train.

105
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,525
No, no. Seriously,
I can't go out tonight.

106
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,479
OK? I have my biggest med school
interview, ever, tomorrow morning.

107
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:56,321
Shit! We should've called.

108
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,194
JeffChang! You're 21 years old, man.
Your asshole dad isn't here anymore.

109
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,943
- Gentlemen.
- Holy fuck, he is totally here.

110
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:05,622
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Chang. How's Cathy?

111
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,667
I mean, Mrs. Chang?
I mean, Dr. Mrs. Chang? Fuck me.

112
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,581
You still owe me $17.50 for
that hole in my fence, Altman.

113
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:14,833
Uh, really? That was from,
like, eighth grade.

114
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:20,005
I didn't know you still
associated with these... people.

115
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,598
No, Dad, I swear,
I didn't know they were coming.

116
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:26,053
Your interview with Dr. Collins is at 8:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

117
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:27,269
I'll pick you up at seven.

118
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,188
- Your suit is pressed?
- Yeah.

119
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:32,518
I had to call in a lot of favors
to get you this interview.

120
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:36,230
Be rested, be sharp,
do not embarrass me.

121
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:38,315
I won't.

122
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,528
Dick wads.

123
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,242
Look, it was so nice
of you guys to surprise me,

124
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:50,094
but, listen, I can't
go out tonight, OK?

125
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:51,877
This is like my whole life
in one interview.

126
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,185
- Dude, I totally get it.
- That's funny 'cause I don't.

127
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,423
- I don't totally get it.
- Could we go out tomorrow night?

128
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,877
No, we cannot go out tomorrow night,
because I've got tickets to Soundgarden.

129
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:00,587
You're a straight-A student,
dude. You can go out one night.

130
00:07:00,622 --> 00:07:01,887
He can't go out, dude.

131
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,465
Casey, first of all,
you need to shut the fuck up.

132
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,015
- And JeffChang, you need to sit down.
- No.

133
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,032
Come on, just take a seat,
please, on your nice futon.

134
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:11,014
Because you have the wrong
attitude right now, my friend.

135
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:12,724
Look, JeffChang,
this isn't just any birthday.

136
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,858
OK? This is your 21st birthday.

137
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,444
- Here we go.
- This is the day that you become a man.

138
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,774
This is the day that you get to tell
every bouncer who's ever carded you,

139
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:21,990
"You know what? Sure, I get it.

140
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,361
Yes, I look like
a nine-year-old Chinese girl."

141
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:26,172
- What the fuck?
- "But guess what?

142
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,913
Today is my 21st
fucking birthday."

143
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,249
So, step aside
and let the man come through.

144
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,494
Miller, I totally get it,
but I can't go out tonight.

145
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:34,670
It's actually not your fault.
It's your people's fault.

146
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,422
Your people haven't been in this
country for a very "rong" time.

147
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,711
- What? He's more American than you.
- My family built the railroads.

148
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:43,147
Yeah, but, well, you know what
I mean. Like, your people.

149
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:45,514
- What? What?
- China. I don't know. Are you Chinese?

150
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,342
- Listen, the point is...
- I understand what you're saying,

151
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:48,809
- but I can't...
In America,

152
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,659
in the United States of America,
bald eagles and Budweiser,

153
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:54,474
you go out and drink because
it's a sacred rite of passage.

154
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:56,275
- It's just like in Africa when...
- Oh, my God.

155
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,999
If we were in Africa... You are
so lucky we're not in Africa.

156
00:07:58,034 --> 00:07:59,653
If we were in Africa, you would
have to leave the village

157
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,191
- and not come back till you killed a bear.
- None of that is true.

158
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:04,359
- There's no bears in Africa? Really?
- No.

159
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,216
- You have to read a book.
You're 21 years old.

160
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:09,788
This, as they say in Casey's
home country, is a bar mitzvah.

161
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,291
- It's the American bar mitzvah.
- I was born in America.

162
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,162
It's like... OK, it's like when an
Eskimo kills his first penguin, right?

163
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:17,998
- Nope, they definitely don't do that.
- Yes, they fucking do, Casey.

164
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:20,424
- I hate you.
- In this country, JeffChang,

165
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,086
your best friends take you out
and they fuck you with alcohol.

166
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:25,839
- I'm gonna fuck you with alcohol.
- Oh, my God.

167
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:27,817
- Now who's with me?
- Nope.

168
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:29,725
- Come on, fuckers!
- Uh-uh.

169
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,518
- Mm-mm.
Whatever. I'm fucking taking you out

170
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,389
whether you want to or not! I don't care
if you're scared of your fucking dad.

171
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:35,933
Dude, we're all scared
of his fucking dad.

172
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:37,941
I'm not! A little bit.

173
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,943
Also, if you do not
come out tonight,

174
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,314
I will stand outside your bedroom
window all night doing this.

175
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,866
- OK, OK, OK, I'll go out!
- I can't hear you!

176
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,529
- This thing is super loud!
- I'll go out, just stop! Just stop!

177
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:51,079
That's what I'm saying.
That wasn't so hard.

178
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,665
What kind of asshole brings
an air horn in his backpack?

179
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,246
- Honestly, it comes in handy more than you'd think.
- Just one beer. One beer.

180
00:08:57,281 --> 00:08:59,244
- That's all I wanted. We'll take care of you.
- That's it, man.

181
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,287
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
You're my little baby tonight.

182
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:05,260
<i>♪ You may bury me with an enemy
in Mount Calvary! ♪</i>

183
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:09,007
<i>♪ You can stack me on a pyre
and soak me down with whiskey ♪</i>

184
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,641
<i>♪ Roast me to
a blackened crisp ♪</i>

185
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,226
<i>- Give me a shot!
- ♪ And throw me in a pyre! ♪</i>

186
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,681
<i>♪ I don't really give a shit
I'm going out in style! ♪</i>

187
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,394
I'm gonna be 21 forever,
you motherfuckers!

188
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,067
- Dude! How you doing?
- I'm doing great, dude.

189
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:28,742
- Good to see you guys!
- What's up, dude?

190
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,446
It's awesome to see you. Honestly,
'cause I miss you. I miss your hugs.

191
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:33,580
- Yeah. OK. OK.
- Give me a hug.

192
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:37,202
Are you, uh... are you...
Are you sure you're OK, man?

193
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:39,496
You're fine, like,
should we maybe get going?

194
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:41,161
No, Casey, look at me. I'm fine.

195
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:42,640
- I'm fine.
- You look fine.

196
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:44,049
- I'm fine.
- He's fine.

197
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,968
- You know what this bar reminds me of?
- What?

198
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,173
The night we won Rothenberg's Beer Pong
tournament, and JeffChang hooked up

199
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,300
with that nine-foot tall chick
who played the banjo.

200
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:52,593
- Yeah, what was her name?
- Tara.

201
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:53,886
Tara!
- Yeah, Tara!

202
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:54,761
She was gigantic.

203
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,312
Man, high school
was so awesome.

204
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,064
Speaking of the banjo,
you still writing music?

205
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,477
Dude, I'm pre-med, man. I don't write music.
I don't listen to music.

206
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:04,438
I can't even remember
the last time I went to a show.

207
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:06,029
- Fuck, man.
- Yeah.

208
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,275
Hey, you're still in for Sidewinder
at The Gorge this summer, right?

209
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,028
- Hell, yeah! The Gorge!
- Right, OK! The Gorge!

210
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:12,494
- Casey, what about you, man?
- Hm?

211
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,997
- The Gorge, Sidewinder.
- Oh, I don't know, man.

212
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,889
Aren't we too old to be doing
the whole music festival thing?

213
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:20,746
Uh, I don't know, Casey, are we
too old to have fun times?

214
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:22,463
- No.
- Are we too old to spend a week

215
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,882
enjoying 250 bands play the
seminal music of our generation?

216
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,628
Are we too old to drop acid and make
love to white chicks in dreadlocks?

217
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:29,470
- I don't like dreadlocks.
- Are we too old to take

218
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:30,839
handfuls of Ecstasy and dance around in fur...
with other people in fur?

219
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,885
- Yeah, we are too old for all of those things.
- I don't like dreadlocks.

220
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,394
But, guys, all I'm saying is that
we all graduate in May, right?

221
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:42,142
This could be the last summer all three
of us ever spend together. You know?

222
00:10:42,177 --> 00:10:46,188
Right, but I have a job
lined up after graduation.

223
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:47,696
- What?
- You got a fucking job?

224
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:51,033
Yeah. I'm working for
Newbury Capital in New York.

225
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,613
- Dude, congrats, that's a great firm!
- Thanks, JeffChang. See?

226
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:56,653
Yeah, awesome. What about
Sidewinder at The Gorge, Casey?

227
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,624
I'll think about it, all right?
That's all I'm saying.

228
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,120
- Yeah. You're selfish. That's bullshit.
Jeff! Jeff!

229
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:04,463
Oh, Nicole!
- Holy shit, game on.

230
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,834
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Happy birthday!

231
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:08,749
Hey. Meet my oldest friends,
Miller, Casey.

232
00:11:08,784 --> 00:11:10,629
We used to tear shit up
in high school.

233
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:12,502
Casey.
Nice to meet you, Nicole.

234
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:14,306
Wow, that's quite a firm shake.

235
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,933
That's 'cause he
masturbates a lot.

236
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:19,638
Oh, yeah? Me too. I can't get to
sleep without flicking the bean.

237
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:23,308
What? Wow, I guess we already have
a lot in common. That's great.

238
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:25,018
Yeah, I masturbate a lot, too.

239
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:26,485
- He does.
- Like a lot.

240
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,980
- Oh.
- At weird places too, like malls,

241
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:31,062
bathrooms, handicap stalls.
They're bigger.

242
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:33,110
Name some more spots
you jerk off in, Miller.

243
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,237
Sometimes I wear flannel.
Made me feel like a lumberjack.

244
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:37,360
- What the fuck?
- I am so sorry for him.

245
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:39,414
I don't even know you.
I feel terrible.

246
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,618
What are you talking about? I feel like
she's picking up what I'm putting down.

247
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,996
- Oh.
- Yeah, but then again, she's putting it down again.

248
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:45,587
But then she picks it back up.

249
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,673
I feel like she'd never
really pick it up twice.

250
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,751
OK, look, I'm just gonna ask.
Who would you rather...?

251
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,503
- Him.
- Oh, my God.

252
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,173
- OK, it's over. It's over.
Oh, my God. This is embarrassing.

253
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,010
That's fine, that's fine. Fuck you
all, I'm gonna go play some darts.

254
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:00,345
Have a really boring life
with my boring friend Casey,

255
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,264
- who played the flute in band.
- Shh.

256
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:04,523
OK, thanks, buddy. Enjoy.

257
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,775
Wow. Thank you for that.
Oh, my God.

258
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,062
- Here, sit down.
- You're welcome. Thank you.

259
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:11,822
So, um...
So, that's your friend?

260
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,734
Yeah, we were best friends
back in high school,

261
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,576
- but we're not really that close anymore.
- Yeah.

262
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,197
Your oldest friends are always
your weirdest friends, right?

263
00:12:18,232 --> 00:12:20,279
- Yeah, what is that about?
- I don't know.

264
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:22,291
People change when
they go to college, right?

265
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:25,746
Like, I'm sure he wasn't that big
of an idiot back in high school.

266
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:28,662
No, actually, that's exactly how
big of an idiot he was, yeah.

267
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:31,543
- Hundred percent same amount of idiot.
- Really? OK.

268
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:34,709
Yeah. So you're in, uh, Sigma...
Zeta...

269
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:37,147
- ...circle with a line in it.
- Oh, OK.

270
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:39,516
- I get it, you're not in a frat?
- No.

271
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,263
- 'Cause I'm not angry and secretly gay.
- Wow!

272
00:12:43,298 --> 00:12:44,598
So, what are you drinking?

273
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,488
Oh, dude, I'm so glad you guys
came. I really needed this.

274
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,566
- My dad's been driving me crazy.
Yeah man, we love you.

275
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:57,367
- We wouldn't miss it for anything.
- Miller!

276
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,780
Honestly, I'm sorry Casey's being
such a little bitch, though.

277
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:00,656
- He's not being a bitch.
- Dude, yeah, he is.

278
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,450
Honestly, I feel like he thinks that
he's too good for us and it's like,

279
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:04,750
"Bro, you're a nerd."

280
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,418
He's not a nerd.
He's our friend.

281
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,247
You're lucky to be hanging out
with us because we're awesome.

282
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,332
Dude, he's just trying
to be happy.

283
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:12,341
So, you leave for
Brazil tomorrow?

284
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:16,303
Yes, and then Chile,
Ecuador and Argentina.

285
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,173
What about you? What are you
doing for spring break?

286
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,338
I have a two week externship
at J.P. Morgan.

287
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:22,469
It's private equity stuff.
It's pretty cool.

288
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,563
- You know? It's not that cool.
- Wait.

289
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:31,228
So, on the last spring break of
your entire life, you're working?

290
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,529
Yeah, why? Aren't we supposed
to be starting our lives?

291
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,024
- Did your mom tell you that?
- Yeah, my mom did tell me that.

292
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,339
- She did?
- Yeah. Why you hating on my mama?

293
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:40,577
No, it's just...
I mean, look around. OK?

294
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,781
In ten years, everyone in this
bar will be married with kids,

295
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:45,534
driving to some boring job
in a fucking minivan.

296
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:50,080
I mean, we got to do as much crazy
shit as we can before then.

297
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:53,041
No, yeah, exactly.
I totally agree.

298
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,545
We're not too big on crazy here,
are we?

299
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,731
What? No, I'm a huge
proponent of the crazy.

300
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:00,848
Are you kidding?
I'm the mayor of Crazyville.

301
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:03,642
- Oh, my God, you're such a dork.
- No! Are you...?

302
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,931
What? Check it. Look, V-neck
sweater with an un-tucked shirt.

303
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,482
My shit is bananas, girl.

304
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,770
I'm just saying, the point is, is that

305
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:16,064
he's changed and I can tell
that you're upset by it.

306
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:17,489
- I'm not upset. I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

307
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,693
OK, whatever, message received.
I'm gonna talk to him.

308
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:21,326
- Dude, no.
- This can't go on. He's hurting you.

309
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,322
- He's hurting both of us.
- You don't need to talk to him.

310
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:24,966
Holy shit, dude!

311
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:26,540
- Fuck me!
That's awesome.

312
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,958
It went all the way through.
I can see it.

313
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,454
Oh, my God. Hey, hey...
Oh, my God, I am so sorry, man.

314
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:32,379
- I'm so sorry.
- Problem, homeboy?

315
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,562
- No, no. Here, let me take a look.
- Get your hands off me!

316
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:36,675
- I'm gonna be a medical student. I'll just check...
- Back off!

317
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,838
<i>- Hey, hey, hey! Step Up, 3D. Take a step back.
- Miller, help me.</i>

318
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:42,431
- You want to fight?
- Calm down. Nobody wants to dance, OK?

319
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,886
- It was an accident.
- Sorry, we won't touch you. It was an accident.

320
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:49,056
Oh, well, guys, I guess
it was just an accident.

321
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,184
You know, my face
doesn't even hurt anymore,

322
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:54,109
now that I know that
it's an accident.

323
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,772
I mean, accidents, they happen all
the time when you're drinking.

324
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:58,541
People get hit by things
like flying darts...

325
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:00,240
- What's happening?
- ...and flying stools.

326
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,444
What are you doing with the bar stool?
What, you're gonna throw it at us?

327
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:04,839
Jesus Christ, man! Are you OK?

328
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:07,183
Now if I ever see
you fucking tampons again,

329
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:09,493
I will come at you like
a fucking spider monkey!

330
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:11,543
I'll rip your face off, bitch.

331
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,372
- I think we should get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah, let's get

332
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,998
- the fuck out of here.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

333
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:17,758
Wow, you seriously
need to get laid.

334
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,628
I know, what do you think
I'm trying to do right now?

335
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:22,106
- Oh, really, is that what this is?
- Yeah.

336
00:15:22,141 --> 00:15:24,515
- Why, how am I doing? Is it not...
- Eh...

337
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,052
Do you have any, like, notes or comments or anything?

338
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,221
- We gotta go.
- What? No, I'm talking to Nicole.

339
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:30,556
That's a really great story.
We gotta go.

340
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:31,741
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not going.

341
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:32,891
We need to get out of this bar.

342
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,862
OK, what could have possibly went down in
there that you had to pull me away from her?

343
00:15:44,897 --> 00:15:47,656
What? Dude, that wasn't gonna happen.
She's a hard nine, you are a soft six.

344
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:50,123
- Oh, what the fuck, man?
- Wow.

345
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,535
- Shit.
- OK, where we going? Let's go.

346
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,913
No, man, it's eleven o'clock.
We're done.

347
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:57,339
OK. OK.

348
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,439
Oh, dude, there's like 20 bars nearby.
That's awesome. Let's do it.

349
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:03,505
No, we gotta get JeffChang home, man.
His dad is gonna fucking flip.

350
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,900
What are you? A pussy?

351
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:08,225
- That's awesome.
- You fucking pussy!

352
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,643
How many fuckin' shots
did you give him in there?

353
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,847
Relax, OK? He drank us both
under the table in high school.

354
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:13,783
- Yeah, I remember.
- Oh, shit, the Galway.

355
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:15,684
These fuckers have been
carding me for years.

356
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:18,193
Whoa! JeffChang! Car!

357
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,404
- Fuckers!
- What the hell? Where is he going?

358
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,566
All right, dude, relax, one more bar
and then we'll go home. I promise.

359
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:25,944
- All right. She was cute, right?
- Yeah, she was cute.

360
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:26,820
- She's just not my type.
- What is your type?

361
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:29,156
Girls that wanna
have sex with me.

362
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,874
- ID?
- Oh.

363
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:34,661
You got ID or not, man? Just
come back when you hit puberty.

364
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:38,630
Twenty-one. Blackjack,
motherfucker!

365
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,083
- Whatever, just go the fuck inside.
- What?

366
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:42,503
- What? What?
- You're good, go in.

367
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:44,421
Where are the white women at?

368
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,894
Drink, drink, drink, drink!

369
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,869
Yeah!

370
00:17:57,904 --> 00:17:59,830
Take it off, yeah!

371
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,591
Oh...

372
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,670
Oh, my God!

373
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,635
Holy shit, dude! Stop pissing!
Stop pissing! Stop it!

374
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,970
What the hell are you doing?

375
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,308
I'll just talk to myself.
Awesome.

376
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:20,649
Man, this is ridiculous.

377
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,822
Miller, we have to get him home.

378
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:29,324

Yeah, let's put him down.
He's really heavy.

392
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:05,319
Oh, my God.

393
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,731
JeffChang's dad is gonna
fucking honor kill him

394
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:08,947
if we don't get him
to that interview.

395
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,444
Relax, he's gonna be fine, man.
Let's just get him home.

396
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,203
Yeah, so where are we?

397
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,749
How do I feel like
none of this looks familiar?

398
00:19:25,784 --> 00:19:27,251
Did we come from...?

399
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,754
JeffChang, where do you live?

400
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:35,384
- Home...
- Yeah, home, how do we get home, bud?

401
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:40,145
- Suck my shit.
OK, hey, hey.

402
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,016
Get you home, we can get you rested.
Just give us your address, buddy.

403
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:45,102
We'll get you a good night's
sleep, a nice cup of coffee.

404
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,645
Dude, that's not gonna work.
You gotta shake him.

405
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,070
- What?
- Wake up, asshole!

406
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,655
- Tell us where you live.
- Didn't you...?

407
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,609
I know that you're in there
and I know that you can hear me.

408
00:19:52,644 --> 00:19:55,153
- Didn't you have his address?
- Yeah, I do, uh...

409
00:19:55,188 --> 00:19:56,829
It's back at his apartment,
though.

410
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,163
All right, well,
maybe it's in his wallet?

411
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:01,493
Yeah, check his wallet.
He's really passed out, man.

412
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:04,788
No, that's his parents' address.
I know that one. Fuck!

413
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:06,540
- Yeah, let's call his parents.
- Yeah, let's.

414
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:10,460
Let's call Dr. Chang, the scariest man
in the entire world, and be like,

415
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:12,386
"Hey, what's going on,
Dr. Chang?

416
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:16,258
We took your son out, got him shitfaced and
totally ruined his future. Oops. Sorry."

417
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:18,319
OK, look, Casey, we don't know
where JeffChang lives. OK?

418
00:20:18,354 --> 00:20:20,345
We don't know anybody who knows
where JeffChang lives,

419
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,389
- so it seems like...
- Wait. Oh, my God. Nicole.

420
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:23,730
Dude, stop thinking
with your penis.

421
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,316
No, no, no. Nicole,
she's friends with JeffChang.

422
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,937
- She might know where he lives.
- OK, cool. Did you get her number?

423
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:30,821
- No.
- No, because you can't close.

424
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,733
No, because you pulled me away
from her before I fucking could.

425
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:34,523
- You know that.
- You could never close.

426
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:36,243
She was closeable.
I would've closed.

427
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,488
- JeffChang could've closed.
- You know what? Nicole lives in a sorority.

428
00:20:38,523 --> 00:20:41,237
If we could find her sorority
house, we could find her.

429
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:43,917
OK, Casey, there's 40,000
people at this university.

430
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,580
There is no way that I'm gonna
go looking for one person,

431
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:48,040
who may or may not
know where he lives.

432
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,375
That is dumb. No. No.

433
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,294
"No." No, never.

all the way over here?

442
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,987
- I wish I was homeless.
- Oh, my God.

443
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,775
Think about it, man, they got no stress.
They have no responsibilities.

444
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,159
What responsibilities
do you have?

445
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,404
Dude, I have a cat that
needs love and affection

446
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,288
and I have to take her on walks.

447
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,952
- You don't take cats on walks.
- I take my cat on walks.

448
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:26,502

Dude, I really don't
want to fuck this up.

452
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:35,177
JeffChang has wanted to be
a doctor his whole life.

453
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,631
Maybe he should've thought about
that before he went out drinking tonight.

454
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,968
- Yeah, 'cause this is all his fault.
- What is that supposed to mean?

455
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:43,060
You forced him to go out
and made him get drunk.

456
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,222
JeffChang is a grown man
and he made his own choices.

457
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:46,723
There was no air horn
involved anywhere?

458
00:21:46,758 --> 00:21:47,981
Nope.

459
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,394
Great. Seems like you haven't
changed at all, that's nice.

460
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:52,778
Yeah, well, you've changed
because in high school,

461
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:55,273
- you were sorta cool, Casey.
- What is this jabbing my leg?

462
00:21:55,308 --> 00:21:57,734
But now, you are not cool.
Now you're just super douchey.

463
00:21:57,769 --> 00:21:59,660
- What the fuck?
- Holy shit.

464
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,864
- What is JeffChang doing with a gun?
- I don't know, man.

465
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,074
Take him.

466
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,243
- Dude, this is a real gun, man.
- I know.

467
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:09,419
I got it.
He's on the riflery team, right?

468
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:13,500
You think this guy's OK? He didn't
say anything to you, did he?

469
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:14,800
No one's trying
to hurt him or anything?

470
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,629
No. But we don't talk as much
as we used to. You know?

471
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,848
All right, let's just
keep going, I guess, right?

472
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,343
I want to shoot something if I
have this fucking gun in my hand.

473
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:25,470
- Please don't. Please don't.
- Can I kill a squirrel?

474
00:22:25,505 --> 00:22:28,182
- Miller, put the fucking gun away.
- OK.

475
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:30,684
- Let's go.
- I'll kill one later.

476
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:41,820
- So, what sorority is Nicole in?
- Sigma Zeta something.

477
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:43,697
Dude, her sorority letters
were written on her rack.

478
00:22:43,732 --> 00:22:45,080
How do you not remember them?

479
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,617
I was more interested
in what she had to say, dude.

480
00:22:46,652 --> 00:22:48,125
Yeah, well, if you
had been a normal guy

481
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,912
and stared at her tits,
we'd be home already.

482
00:22:49,947 --> 00:22:52,045
Speaking of tits,
how is your sister?

483
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,625
Oh, my God.
Sigma Zeta Theta, could that be it?

484
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,169
- Yeah, that's actually right.
- Oh.

485
00:22:57,204 --> 00:22:59,428
Vaginas!

486
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:01,048
Yeah, you wanna tell us
where you live, man?

487
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,556
Big vagina.

488
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,761
OK. Let's just lock that away for
a few minutes and act normal, OK?

489
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:08,931
Oh, hello!
Hello. How are you?

490
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:10,432
Hi.
Hi.

491
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:14,144
Awesome. Is Nicole in?

492
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,445
Is this some sort of
pledge thing?

493
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,878
- I want cereal. Count Chocula.
- Shh. JeffChang.

494
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:21,276
- All right.
You don't have to write.

495
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:22,236
The answer is...

496
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:25,405
Oh, no, don't even worry about it.
Just tell Nicole to come downstairs.

497
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,622
Just tell her it's Casey.

498
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:29,743
It's a funny story, actually.
She'll totally love this.

499
00:23:29,778 --> 00:23:31,328
Fuck! Well, what are
we gonna do now, man?

500
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:32,830
That was so weird.

501
00:23:32,865 --> 00:23:33,997
Hold him.

502
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,134
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

503
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,296
- Don't leave me with the baby.
- Bring the baby. Come on.

504
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:43,674
- I can't... fuckin'...
- Let's go around the back.

505
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:45,509
Motherfucker.

506
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:49,853
Hey. Dude, no, we're not
breaking into a sorority.

507
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,516
Don't be
scared. They're just girls.

508
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,192
Oh, jackpot. Yes.

509
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:57,855
What? Do you have a better idea?

510
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:01,608
- Come on.
- I fucking hate you.

511
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,159
Watch his head.
Watch his head.

512
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,697
It's gonna be fine,
everything's gonna be fine.

513
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,833
- Oh, Jesus. I'm sure he's fine.
- Great.

514
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:14,621
Oh, God, JeffChang, be careful.

515
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:15,706
Shh!

516
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:21,211
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Was Nicole Latina?

517
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:22,511
She could be half-tina.

518
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:25,472
I don't know, man.
She seemed pretty Nordic to me.

519
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:29,428
Dude, Cameron Diaz is Latina. It's just a
meaningless ethnic signifier. Come on.

520
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,105
You know, sometimes,
you say the stupidest shit

521
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,393
and other times it's like, Cameron Diaz,
Latina, I never even thought of that.

522
00:24:36,428 --> 00:24:38,663
<i>- Shh!
- Yeah, I really liked her in Shrek.</i>

523
00:24:38,698 --> 00:24:41,466
<i>Yeah, dude,
Shrek was fucking tight.</i>

524
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:44,234
I'm hungry!
- Shh, shh, shh!

525
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:46,462
- I want waffles!
- Shit.

526
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:48,620
- Go.
- I want waffles!

527
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,658
He is way too loud. We definitely
can't bring him with us.

528
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:52,875
Right, so, what are we gonna do?

529
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,751
Well, we can't just
leave him here, man.

530
00:24:54,786 --> 00:25:00,257
Hi-ya. Hi-ya,
hi-ya, hi-ya. Hi-ya, hi-ya...

531
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,419
Chill out with the rain dance. I'm
trying to tie you to the can.

532
00:25:02,454 --> 00:25:04,094
Hi-ya, hi-ya...

533
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:06,847
- Is this really the best idea?
- Probably not.

534
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:09,468
- Let's hump and dump.
- That's not an expression, but OK.

535
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:21,737
"Rosa. Maria"?

536
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:24,983
"Incarnazion"?
Dude, something is wrong...

537
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,783
Dude, what are you doing?

538
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:51,301
Lupe?

539
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:55,514
Honey, are you OK?

540
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,726
Got a little cramp?
Need a tamp?

541
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:01,985
Have you seen my bra?

542
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,689
- Go, go, go.
Maybe it's in your room.

543
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:05,482
Fuck, it's a dead end.

544
00:26:05,517 --> 00:26:06,316
Go, go, go!

545
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:17,286
Pledge Gomez and Pledge Aguilar are eager
for our spanking, Pledge Mistress!

546
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:20,205
Lupita, are you OK?

547
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:28,839
Lupe.

548
00:26:28,874 --> 00:26:29,805
Lupe.

549
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,717
Is something wrong,
Pledge Mistress?

550
00:26:31,752 --> 00:26:32,968
Why are we not being spanked?

551
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:38,098
- Don't, don't, don't.
- We wait eagerly, Pledge Mistress.

552
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:42,415
Pledge Mistress, we are
deserving of this spanking.

553
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,813
- Yes, they are.
- What are you doing?

554
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:46,405
I'm gonna spank that ass.

555
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,740
- No.
- Shh. I hear something.

556
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:52,070
- Go check the door.
- We want to be spanked by you, Pledge Mistress.

557
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,669
I feel nothing. Again.

558
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:03,957
Pledge Aguilar requests a spanking
of her own, Pledge Mistress.

559
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,051
What the fuck?

560
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,099
- Fucking...
- I love sorority chicks.

561
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,686
Pledge Mistress,
is there a man in the room?

562
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,690
Um...
Well, say something.

563
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:32,993
That's right, pledges. This is
a new part of your initiation.

564
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:35,823
- Really, because that's not...
- Yeah, I don't know about that...

565
00:27:35,858 --> 00:27:37,706
Girls, this is
what the Pledge Mistress said.

566
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,659
Guys, do you want me
to have to call Pledge Mistress?

567
00:27:39,694 --> 00:27:41,543
No, no.
- I don't want to call Pledge Mistress.

568
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,539
You know how she gets this time
of night, but I will wake her up

569
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:45,207
and tell her you're
being disobedient pledges.

570
00:27:45,242 --> 00:27:47,341
- We're sorry.
- Yeah.

571
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:50,671
- That's better.
- What's our new assignment?

572
00:27:50,706 --> 00:27:52,690
Find Nicole. Find Nicole.

573
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:54,742
- Your new assignment...
- Find Nicole.

574
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:56,760
- ...is to start making out.
- What?

575
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:10,315
Candy.

576
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:12,943
I'm hungry.

577
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:23,829
Who the fuck is this?

578
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:00,449
Candy bar.

579
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,409
This is so wrong.

580
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:09,173
Relax, all the kids go les nowadays.
Isn't that right, Becca?

581
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,920
Yeah, totally, but how is this part
of our sorority training again?

582
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:17,264
I have no idea, but I love you.

583
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,718
I want to make beautiful lesbian
babies with both of you.

584
00:29:19,753 --> 00:29:21,018
Look, do either of you guys...

585
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:22,644
- God, they're really going at it.
- Yeah.

586
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,806
Do either of you guys know
which room Nicole is in?

587
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:27,476
Nicole? There's no Nicole
in this sorority.

588
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:29,359
- What?
- She's not here.

589
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:31,938
Dude... we're in the
wrong sorority.

590
00:29:31,973 --> 00:29:34,483
No, dude, we're in
the right sorority.

591
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:40,947
Eyes!

592
00:29:40,982 --> 00:29:42,779
Throat!

593
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,541
Groin!

594
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,787
All right, we do have
to get going soon.

595
00:29:46,822 --> 00:29:48,827
Yeah. No, we'll get going.

596
00:29:48,862 --> 00:29:50,798
Becca? Hey, sorry.

597
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,460
- Will you grab her boobie a little bit?
- Come on, man, that's...

598
00:29:53,495 --> 00:29:57,881
Intruder in the house! Intruder!

599
00:29:57,916 --> 00:29:59,765
I'm so sorry.

600
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,843
- Go, go!
- Go, go, go!

601
00:30:01,878 --> 00:30:04,405
Hey, get your ass back here!

602
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:08,475
- JeffChang!
- JeffChang, we're coming!

603
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:11,270
What the hell?

604
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:13,403
Hey!

605
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,406
We're gonna kick your ass!

606
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:19,194
Ladies, please,
can we just talk about this?

607
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:21,113
- Holy shit!
- Oh, window!

608
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:23,664
Go, go, go, go!

609
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:27,411
We're gonna fuck you up!
- Motherfuckers!

610
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,165
How we gonna get him down?

611
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,040
Uh...

612
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,300
- We're gonna throw him off.
- What? No.

613
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,796
Trust me. A pool cover's like a giant pillow.
I've done this a thousand times.

614
00:30:37,831 --> 00:30:40,924
- You have?
- We're gonna beat your ass!

615
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:43,844
- OK, on three.
- Oh, my God, look.

616
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:45,217
That's Nicole's sorority.

617
00:30:45,252 --> 00:30:46,555
- Oh, cool. OK.
- All right.

618
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:50,037
One... two...

619
00:30:50,072 --> 00:30:52,561
- Fuck.
- ...three!

620
00:30:56,516 --> 00:30:57,489
Oh, my God.

621
00:31:00,312 --> 00:31:01,737
Did we just kill JeffChang?

622
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:05,574
Jump!

623
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:11,670
Oh, my God!
Dude, they're everywhere!

624
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,582
JeffChang is
covered in rose thorns.

625
00:31:13,617 --> 00:31:15,424
- Open the fucking door!
- Can I help you?

626
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:18,337
- Oh, my God, thank God you're white.
- Is Nicole here?

627
00:31:18,372 --> 00:31:20,627
- Uh, yes, but... OK...
- Awesome.

628
00:31:20,662 --> 00:31:22,848
Um, she doesn't want to see you.

629
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:24,760
OK, just be careful.
Oh, my Lord.

630
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:26,101
I'm looking at his asshole. Oh!

631
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:28,347
So, whose idea was it
to throw Jeff off the roof?

632
00:31:28,382 --> 00:31:30,992
Uh, Casey.
It was Casey's idea.

633
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:33,567
Wow. I was all wrong about you.

634
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:35,353
Had you pegged for
a real straight arrow.

635
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:37,105
Oh, no, he is.
He went to space camp.

636
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,864
- Thanks, man.
- Straight arrow.

637
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:42,152
- Yeah. I have a bit of a wild side. Mm-hm.
- Oh, yeah?

638
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:45,370
Sometimes after eating,
I jump right into the pool.

639
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:47,991
- I don't even wait 20 minutes.
- You're a fucking renegade.

640
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:49,458
Yeah, you think so?
- Yeah.

641
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:51,870
Sometimes at night... I
don't even wear my mouth guard.

642
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:53,330
- Oh, my God.
- And I'm supposed to.

643
00:31:53,365 --> 00:31:54,998
That's recommended.

644
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:56,590
- You're funny.
- Thanks.

645
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,383
- I think you're funny too.
Thank you.

646
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:00,629
What the fuck are you guys doing?
OK, look, I go to the window

647
00:32:00,664 --> 00:32:02,857
to check out for our safety,
and I come back,

648
00:32:02,892 --> 00:32:05,015
it's all bananas in pajamas.
Let's get serious.

649
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,178
- Do you know where JeffChang lives?
- I don't, I'm sorry.

650
00:32:08,213 --> 00:32:10,010
Do you know
any of his friends or anything?

651
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:12,010
I met Jeff in my remedial
science study group,

652
00:32:12,045 --> 00:32:13,941
but he didn't really talk
to anyone else so...

653
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:16,436
There we go, back at square one.
Not a single clue.

654
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:19,196
Wait, your remedial
science group?

655
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:21,441
Yeah, I'm a Bio major.
I tutor kids who are struggling.

656
00:32:21,476 --> 00:32:22,484
OK, no, JeffChang is Asian.

657
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,576
There's no remedial
in that language.

658
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:27,739
- Yeah.
- Nicole, JeffChang invented science, OK?

659
00:32:27,774 --> 00:32:29,908
Actually, he's failing
out of school.

660
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:35,247
- This JeffChang, right here?
- Yeah. This JeffChang.

661
00:32:35,282 --> 00:32:36,456
You guys didn't know that?

662
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:38,006
- No. No.
- What?

663
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,253
What is going on with JeffChang?
First the gun and now this?

664
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:42,719
Why wouldn't he tell us
he was failing?

665
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,721
I don't know. Maybe he was
embarrassed or something.

666
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:47,134
We're his best friends. You tell
your best friends stuff like that.

667
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:48,600
Maybe we're not friends
like that anymore.

668
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,478
What? OK, we're
in the middle of a crisis here.

669
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:53,515
You're just gonna drop that
kind of shit on me right now?

670
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,993
Listen, Nicole, is there
like a campus address book,

671
00:32:56,028 --> 00:32:58,437
or do you know anyone that
might know where he lives?

672
00:32:58,472 --> 00:33:00,571
No. Oh, wait,

673
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:02,364
- Randy might know where Jeff lives.
- Oh, great.

674
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,152
He's the campus pep leader.
He has every student's address

675
00:33:05,187 --> 00:33:07,234
in his phone for sending out
flyers and stuff.

676
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:09,088
- So Randy is a cheerleader?
- Yell leader.

677
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:10,873
- Oh, yell leader.
- Completely different.

678
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:13,535
- Yeah, I didn't realize, OK.
- Straight to voicemail.

679
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,960
Oh, he's at the pep rally.

680
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:16,580
You know what? I'm going to
a party on that side of campus,

681
00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:18,464
- I can take you guys over there.
- Great!

682
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:20,083
OK, look, no, guys.
We can't just run out of here.

683
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:21,592
We're surrounded by
Latins right now.

684
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:23,212
They're coming in hot.
They're frickin' everywhere.

685
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:25,596
- No worries. I have a car.
- She has a car!

686
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:28,383
Nice. A little bit of a road
trip? We're on a mission.

687
00:33:28,418 --> 00:33:31,136
OK, there she is.
Go that way!

688
00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:33,187
Oh, fuck, what is that?
It looks like a toy.

689
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:36,016
Look over here!
It's fine, it's a car. We're coming.

690
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:37,983
Dude, there's no way.
There's Hispanics everywhere.

691
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,061
Check the bushes.
- OK, we gotta go, come on!

692
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,105
No, no. This is stupid. We're
not gonna fit in that thing.

693
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:44,448
- We'll be fine.
- I've taken shits bigger than that.

694
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:46,464
I cannot believe you're jeopardizing
our mission for some girl.

695
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:48,445
- Why? You think she likes me?
- No, you're a fucking nerd.

696
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,120
That's what I was saying.
It's like,

697
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:52,157
- I think she would date a guy that
rides a mountain bike... - Shh!

698
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:56,126
...or like surfs in Costa Rica.
Where do I fit in?

699
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:58,539
- Fuck, this really isn't gonna work.
I told you.

700
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,710
There they are!

701
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:06,088
Go, go, go!

702
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:13,345
Get the fucking van.

703
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,100
<i>- ♪ Hm-mm ♪

709
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,633
Is the pep rally
even still going on?

710
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,392
Oh, yeah,
we've got State tomorrow.

711
00:34:32,427 --> 00:34:34,116
This campus is gonna
be going off all night.

712
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:35,200
Oh, nice.

713
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,918
Well, thanks for the ride.

714
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:39,496
So, how are we gonna
find this Randy guy?

715
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:42,464
Pep rally's right down that path.
Just look for the big truck.

716
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:45,460
It's called the Spirit Mobile. Randy
should be around there somewhere.

717
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:46,969
You sure you don't
want to come with us?

718
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:49,506
I'd love to, but I'm already
super late to my party.

719
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:52,009
And why is Randy gonna give us
JeffChang's address?

720
00:34:52,044 --> 00:34:53,218
Oh, because he's my boyfriend.

721
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,018
What?

722
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:57,563
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Uh, no.

723
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:59,565
- Yeah.
Well, Nicole, have a great night.

724
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,561
- Thank you so much. You're a gem.
- OK, well, good luck.

725
00:35:02,596 --> 00:35:04,521
- OK.
- Great. Thank you.

726
00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:05,397
Bye.

727
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,736
- Just don't.
- Casey, I'm not gonna say anything.

728
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:13,405
Can't believe she has a
boyfriend, though, right?

729
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,038
I thought she would have
said something earlier.

730
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:18,660
It makes sense. That's why she
wasn't, you know, feeling me.

731
00:35:18,695 --> 00:35:20,294
But I'm not gonna say anything.
I won't say anything.

732
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:22,498
I don't want to rub salt in your wound
'cause I could tell you're hurting...

733
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:25,334
But I didn't know
she had a boyfriend. Wow.

734
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:27,165
Let's just find this guy, OK?

735
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,927
I bet he's huge, by the way.

736
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:32,382
Probably super flexible. The guy
could probably blow himself.

737
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:34,819
I'd blow myself,
but I have a long torso.

738
00:35:34,854 --> 00:35:37,221
But seriously,
does your sister ask about me?

739
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:42,809
Check the alley!
Let's find these motherfuckers!

740
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:47,648
What the hell's
going on out here?

741
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:52,451
Hey... have you seen these guys?

742
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:53,786
I've been looking
for them all night.

743
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:56,198
They were also carrying
a drunk Asian kid.

744
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:59,500
Oh, I got you,
you little turds.

745
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:19,429
Hey, let's check over there
by the big truck.

746
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:24,059
Oh, look, cheerleaders!
Let's ask the cheerleaders.

747
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:26,193
Uh, excuse me! Excuse me!

748
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,689
- Do you know where Randy is?
- He's behind the Spirit Mobile.

749
00:36:28,724 --> 00:36:29,565
Oh, thank you.

750
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:41,702
Excuse me, hey, are you Randy?

751
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:45,289
- Oh, no.
- What the fuck you doing here?

752
00:36:45,324 --> 00:36:46,880
Who's this guy, Randy?

753
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:49,126
These are the motherfuckers
that threw a dart at my face.

754
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,503
- Break them down, Randy.
- Wait, this is the guy from the bar?

755
00:36:51,538 --> 00:36:55,174
- Yeah.
- You got a lot of nerve coming into my house.

756
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:57,641
You are not cool enough
to call something your house.

757
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:00,679
Plus, we're outside, so it doesn't
even make sense. There's no house.

758
00:37:00,714 --> 00:37:02,729
- It's a metaphor, bitch.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude, dude.

759
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:05,934
I'm sorry about my friend. Look,
we just talked to Nicole and...

760
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:07,359
Whoa, you talked to my girl?

761
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,153
Yeah, I wouldn't
have gone that route.

762
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:11,148
Yeah, listen, we're just trying
to get our friend home

763
00:37:11,183 --> 00:37:13,108
and she said you might have
his address in your phone?

764
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:15,242
- Nicole said that?
- Hm-mm.

765
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:17,196
- Lock him up, Randy.
- Sweep the leg, Randy.

766
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:18,871
"Sweep the leg"?

767
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,457
- Hurt his feelings, Randy.
- Crush his spirit, Randy.

768
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:26,121
Well, I mean, I should probably help them out, right?

769
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:28,380
Here's my phone, motherfuckers.

770
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:30,591
- Come and get it.
- Can we just be grown-ups about this?

771
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:33,170
- OK, I'm done talking. What's up?
- Dude, what are you doing?

772
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:34,803
- Oh, shit, Randy!
- He's got a gun, Randy!

773
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:36,847
- I'm scared, Randy.
- Give me your fucking phone, Randy!

774
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:39,927
- Put the fucking gun away, OK?
- No, dude, you know what? I know guns.

775
00:37:39,962 --> 00:37:41,970
- That shit ain't even real.
- Huh? Is this real?

776
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,358
Yeah, baby, kick his ass, Randy!

777
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:51,855
- Yeah, boy! Fuck him up!
- Yeah, beat his ass, Randy!

778
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,649
Break a leg, baby!

779
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,990
Oh, shit, Randy.

780
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:04,082
I got it, I got the phone.

781
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:07,308
- Pussies!
- Where the hell are you going?

782
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:10,499
- Hey!
- Get up, Randy. Let's get him, Randy!

783
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:15,546
Move, move, get out the way!
Watch it!

784
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:17,381
Fuck!

785
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:25,180
Fuck!

786
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,985
There he is! I see him!

787
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:43,698
Yeah, we got you now!

788
00:38:43,733 --> 00:38:44,873
You're cornered, dude!

789
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:47,452
- We're gonna fuck up your face!
Miller!

790
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:49,711
Get in, get in, get in!

791
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,707
Hey! I'm in, I'm in!
Go, go, go!

792
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:58,547
Find 'em? All right, go. Look for them.
Come on, I want...

793
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:06,979
That was so dumb. That was so dumb.

794
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,933
This Randy guy's a massive douche, but
I actually really like his phone.

795
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:12,060
Just tell me that JeffChang's
address is in there.

796
00:39:12,095 --> 00:39:14,570
OK, Jeffrey Reginald Chang.

797
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:17,906
- Four-nineteen Oak Street, number two.
- Oh, thank God.

798
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:22,446
And that is located... six blocks away.
And boom goes the dynamite.

799
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:23,906
- Nice. Finally!
- Nice.

800
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:28,208
Finally.
We're gonna get you home, buddy.

801
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:29,620
- I'm glad we didn't ruin his life.
- He's still breathing, right?

802
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:31,962
Who cares?
Oh, go straight here.

803
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:34,339
OK, so this is good. We're
gonna have him home by four.

804
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:37,586
He'll be able to nap it out for a few
hours and be good to go by seven.

805
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:39,463
His asshole father
will never know.

806
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:49,765
Hello? Honey, I told you.

807
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,192
I knocked on his door,
he didn't answer.

808
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,666
I called his cell phone. He didn't pick up.

809
00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:58,071
<i>- Oh, man, he's gonna pay for this.
- Why didn't you wake him up?</i>

810
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:02,569
No, he's not asleep. He's out here.
I can feel it in my knee.

811
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,615
So, what about that buffalo,
you think it's OK?

812
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,290
- No, they're gonna kill it.
- Really?

813
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:11,119
Buffalos only live for like
three years anyway, man.

814
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:13,034
- Whoa! Was that The Chief again?
- Yes, it is.

815
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:14,880
Stay awesome, Chief!

- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Whoo!

826
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:40,857
Awesome.
- You were right, man. Golf carts go down stairs.

827
00:40:40,892 --> 00:40:43,610
Holy shit, I fucking love college, man.
I don't know why I ever left.

828
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,196
Wait, what?

829
00:40:46,231 --> 00:40:48,205
What?

830
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,290
Did you drop out of college?

831
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:53,620
It's me, man. You can tell me whatever you want.
I'm not gonna make a big deal.

832
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:55,581
- OK, yeah, I dropped out of college.
- What?

833
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:56,964
- Two years ago.
- Two...

834
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,959
What have you been doing
for fucking two years?

835
00:40:58,994 --> 00:41:01,343
I work at a gas station, man.

836
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:03,734
I get, you know, free snacks.
I get free smokes.

837
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:06,091
Like, I hang out
with my boy Varaj... Varag.

838
00:41:06,126 --> 00:41:07,599
You have a boy "Varaj"?

839
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:09,977
- Yeah, he's pretty...
- This is... Oh, my God.

840
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:12,472
Dude, look, Casey, I don't know why
you're acting so surprised, man.

841
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:14,398
Like, I'm not JeffChang,
I'm not you.

842
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:16,441
I wasn't gonna do
awesome stuff with my life.

843
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:19,729
- Like... this is what's up.
- OK. What a cop-out.

844
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:22,983
You're one of the smartest
people I've ever met.

845
00:41:23,018 --> 00:41:24,658
Really?

846
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:26,987
- Top 25. Whatever, man.
- Fuck you.

847
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:29,663
- You aced your SAT's, right?
- Yeah.

848
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:32,249
And remember Mary what's-her-name?
The hot born-again chick?

849
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:35,829
No one could get near her, and then you
stole third base with her at the book fair.

850
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:38,415
- She liked to read.
- I know. I don't know what you said to her,

851
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,393
but it must have
been pretty smart.

852
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:42,336
Uh... I told her I had leukemia.

853
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:45,471
That's actually pretty dark.

854
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:47,841
Whatever, man. The point is
you're really smart.

855
00:41:47,876 --> 00:41:50,517
- You're just lazy as fuck.
- Yeah.

856
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:53,013
- I'm not bullshitting, man.
- I know, you're right.

857
00:41:53,048 --> 00:41:54,848
I just gotta get my shit
together, man.

858
00:41:54,883 --> 00:41:57,142
I just gotta
get my shit together.

859
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:03,113
I miss you, dude.

860
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:06,819
We don't really get to talk
like this much anymore.

861
00:42:08,737 --> 00:42:11,072
Look, maybe I could take
a couple weeks off this summer

862
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:13,408
and catch up with you guys
at the Sidewinder Festival.

863
00:42:13,443 --> 00:42:14,284
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

864
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:16,710
- That's awesome, Casey!
- I miss you guys too.

865
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:20,332
Dude, I'm gonna fuck so much unwashed
hippie ass it's gonna be embarrassing.

866
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:22,251
- Right.
- I like the hippie chicks, man.

867
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:23,383
They don't shave their legs.

868
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:25,260
That means they have
a huge bush and you know me...

869
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:27,805
- Yeah, you love bushes. Yeah.
- I like a good bush. Fuck.

870
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,467
OK, JeffChang's apartment
is right up here on the left.

871
00:42:30,502 --> 00:42:33,060
Nice. We got you home, buddy.

872
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:36,014
- This doesn't look right.
- What the shit is this?

873
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:46,942
- You sure this is the right address?
- Yeah.

874
00:42:46,977 --> 00:42:48,861
Must be an old address.

875
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,072
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

876
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:55,582
All right, well, come on,
let's go inside.

877
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:57,953
Maybe someone in his old room
knows where he lives now.

Look at this place, man.

882
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,897
Yeah, these nerds
know how to party, bro!

883
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:27,865
Oh, dude, Beer Pong?
We gotta play. We gotta play.

884
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,068
Yeah, man. That would be great,
but we got some shit to do.

885
00:43:30,103 --> 00:43:31,827
Hey, your elbow's
over the table!

886
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:33,718
- Shut up, you piece of shit!
- Hey, fuck you, man!

887
00:43:33,753 --> 00:43:35,539
- Watch your elbow, asshole!
- Thirty seconds...

888
00:43:35,574 --> 00:43:38,994
- I'm gonna kick that guy's ass!
Dude, what is wrong with you?

889
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:47,801
- Oh, my God. You are so cute.
- Hello. Oh, my God.

890
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:50,714
Bang on my door one more fucking time
and I'll claw your fucking eyes out.

891
00:43:50,749 --> 00:43:52,097
- What?
- Whoa.

892
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:54,092
OK, um... Do you know this guy?

893
00:43:54,127 --> 00:43:55,434
Why, because I'm Asian?

894
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,603
We don't all know each other,
you racist mother...

895
00:43:57,638 --> 00:44:00,641
Oh, wait, I do know this guy.
Yeah, he used to live here.

896
00:44:00,676 --> 00:44:02,684
Do you know where he lives now?

897
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:05,082
No, I used to live across the hall
and he never talked to anyone.

898
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:07,439
- Of course he didn't.
- That's why I was shocked when the cops came

899
00:44:07,474 --> 00:44:09,615
- and arrested his bitch ass.
- Wait, what?

900
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,867
What would the cops
possibly want with JeffChang?

901
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:16,240
I don't fucking know, but he moved out
after that and I never saw him again.

902
00:44:16,275 --> 00:44:18,624
What is going on with JeffChang?

903
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:20,334
Motherfucker took
my laundry detergent.

904
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:23,712
He's packing heat, he's failing out
of school, and now he's a criminal?

905
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:26,708
Maybe he's a Yakuza or something. This
chick is really fucking turning me on.

906
00:44:26,743 --> 00:44:29,708
Do you have a forwarding address
for JeffChang?

907
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:32,673
Yeah, yeah, no, I do.
No, you fucking cock lickers.

908
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,348
You could check with our RA.
He might know.

909
00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:37,851
- Your RA, where is your RA? Miller!
- What, the fuck...

910
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:40,889
Top floor. His name is PJ Brill and
he's throwing this fucking party

911
00:44:40,924 --> 00:44:43,148
- if you could believe that.
- She has such a mouth on her.

912
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:45,477
- I believe it. I believe it.
- Yeah, and when you see the beaver muncher,

913
00:44:45,512 --> 00:44:48,272
tell him to get all the titties
and butt-fuckers out of my foyer.

914
00:44:48,307 --> 00:44:50,531
I got fucking field hockey
tomorrow.

915
00:44:53,249 --> 00:44:55,828
- Oh, here we go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

916
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:58,240
- Where do you think you're going?
- We're going up.

917
00:44:58,275 --> 00:45:00,492
- No way. Tower of Power, dude.
What?

918
00:45:00,527 --> 00:45:02,084
- What's the Tower of Power?
- Yeah.

919
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:05,164
You gotta win the event on each
floor to move up a level. Hey.

920
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:07,339
You have to be kidding me.
- Nope.

921
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:09,939
- OK, how many levels are there?
- There's eight.

922
00:45:09,974 --> 00:45:12,504
OK, we just need to talk
to this guy named PJ Brill?

923
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:14,346
PJ Brill is Tower Master.

924
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:17,224
You wanna talk to him,
you gotta get to the top level.

925
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:20,387
- How do big dumb animals like you even get into college?
- Miller...

926
00:45:20,422 --> 00:45:23,515
Just 'cause I look like this...
doesn't mean I don't have feelings.

927
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,785
Look, we just need
to get our friend home, OK?

928
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,020
- Can you help us out? Please?
- Come on, man.

929
00:45:28,055 --> 00:45:30,112
Tower of Power, dude.

930
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:31,857
- Tower of Power, dude?
- Tower of Power.

931
00:45:31,892 --> 00:45:33,567
What are we gonna
do with JeffChang?

932
00:45:33,602 --> 00:45:35,367
Uh...

933
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:37,905
Oh, stoners.

934
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:40,873
- Hey, what's up, dudes?
- What's going on?

935
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:43,535
- You guys mind watching our friend for a bit?
- Sure, man.

936
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:45,711
Killer.

937
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:48,999
These guys look super high.
You sure this is a good idea?

938
00:45:49,034 --> 00:45:51,258
Relax, dude, these morons
aren't going anywhere.

939
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:53,754
Now, come on! Let's show these
clown dicks how to pong, baby.

940

OK, bros, when we beat you,

00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:48,684
Hey, Ivan Drago, this one's
for you and your sweet jumpsuit.

958
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,734
Ahh! Sucka.

959
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,444
Say something, bro.
You're freaking me out.

960
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:56,358
- This one's for Apollo Creed. His spirit lives on.
- Yeah!

961
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,695
- That's what I'm talking about! That's what I'm talking about!
- Paper covers rock, bitch.

962
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,531
- Rock covers your Russian ass!
- That's right... different cultures.

963
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:05,409
Sky hook.

964
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:08,460
That's unbelievable!

965
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:11,123
- Last shot, last shot.
- Kiss it. Kiss it.

966
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:16,176
<i>♪ Man up! ♪</i>

967
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:18,129
<i>- ♪ Yeah ♪
- Yeah!</i>

968
00:47:18,164 --> 00:47:20,048
That's unbelievable!

969
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:21,598
USA! USA!

970
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:23,267
- Red, white and blue!
- Undefeated, baby!

971
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:25,721
- Give me my beads, bitch!
- Sorry, he doesn't mean that.

972
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:27,598
Tower of fucking Power!

973
00:47:27,633 --> 00:47:31,018
All day!

974
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:36,273
That's right, baby!
You did it. You know you did it.

975
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:44,490
Yes!

976
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:50,704
- What's the name of the game?
Thumper!

977
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:53,457
- And why do we play?
- To get fucked up!

978
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:00,088
Yeah!

979
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:08,222
- Yeah!
- Give me my beads.

980
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,939
That's what I'm talking about,
right there!

981
00:48:16,974 --> 00:48:18,357
Dude, what?

982
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:27,115
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

983
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:35,249
Almost there!
Holy shit! You can do this!

984
00:48:37,911 --> 00:48:38,752
No.

985
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:49,950
- Suck and Blow!
- Fucking child's play.

986
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,980
All right, last event,
get in line.

987
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:54,893
I'm gonna go get in there.
Let's go, Suck and Blow party.

988
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:57,312
Casey?

989
00:48:58,272 --> 00:48:59,363
Nicole?

990
00:48:59,398 --> 00:49:02,157
- Oh, so this was your party.
- Hey.

991
00:49:02,192 --> 00:49:03,986
- Did you get Jeff home OK?
- Uh, no, actually,

992
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:06,446
we left him downstairs
with a couple random stoners.

993
00:49:06,481 --> 00:49:09,081
Wait, are you serious?

994
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:11,660
Yeah, actually, now that I think about
it, it's kind of a horrible idea.

995
00:49:11,695 --> 00:49:12,703
I don't know why we did that.

996
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,377
- Hey, Walsh.
- Yeah, bro?

997
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:22,421
Hey, man, who's this dude?

998
00:49:27,718 --> 00:49:29,518
So, Randy didn't
have Jeff's address?

999
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:32,848
Yeah, no, your boyfriend actually
turned out to be a bit of a dead end.

1000
00:49:32,883 --> 00:49:34,106
Balls, I'm sorry.

1001
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:36,310
Can I ask you what
you see in that guy?

1002
00:49:36,345 --> 00:49:38,068
- Is this you being jealous?
- No!

1003
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,563
- Is that what that is?
- I'm not jealous.

1004
00:49:39,598 --> 00:49:40,988
- Yes, you are.
- Why am I jealous?

1005
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:45,652
Why, 'cause he's handsome and
has phenomenal school spirit?

1006
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:48,109
Randy is pretty crazy,
but he's also fun.

1007
00:49:48,144 --> 00:49:50,497
And he's passionate
and I like that in a guy.

1008
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:53,785
Yeah, but he's passionate about
cheerleading and fighting people.

1009
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,764
It's like the two worst things
to be passionate about.

1010
00:49:56,799 --> 00:49:59,708
OK, all right, what are you
passionate about, Casey?

1011
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:05,345
- I'm passionate about a lot of things.
- Oh, what NPR?

1012
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,676
<i>Yeah, yeah, I actually like NPR a bit.
They have a nice little Morning Edition,</i>

1013
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:12,221
sometimes I get some cooking tips from them.

1014
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:14,688
- Cute ringtone.
- Sorry.

1015
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:16,356
I thought that
might have been him.

1016
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:20,145
He hasn't returned my texts all night.
I... hate it when he does this.

1017
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:23,447
Well, enough about Randy.

1018
00:50:23,482 --> 00:50:25,150
Would you like to
Suck and Blow with me?

1019
00:50:25,185 --> 00:50:27,367
I thought you'd never ask.

1020
00:50:31,615 --> 00:50:34,249
Dude, does it look
like the bear's...

1021
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:38,664
- ...blowing him enough yet or what?
- It looks great, I believe it.

1022
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:43,669
What about the face...
Should I write, "Douchebag"?

1023
00:50:43,704 --> 00:50:46,418
Or "Fucktard"? Huh?

1024
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,723
Very nice form.
Where did you learn to play?

1025
00:50:56,758 --> 00:50:58,482
Hanover Lake every summer.

1026
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:00,519
No way, I used to spend
every winter break there.

1027
00:51:00,554 --> 00:51:01,937
- No!
- I swear to God.

1028
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:06,233
The card needs to be a little
higher, Danielle. For next time.

1029
00:51:06,268 --> 00:51:08,826
Yeah, people say that
it's like old and run down,

1030
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:11,280
but I think it's the most
beautiful place in the world.

1031
00:51:11,315 --> 00:51:13,699
Yes! Well, except for that
creepy guy that sells pinecones.

1032
00:51:13,734 --> 00:51:16,076
- Creepy Dan the Pinecone Man!
- Yes! Oh, my God!

1033
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,580
I can tell you don't like me,
but if you have a sister

1034
00:51:19,615 --> 00:51:21,206
who looks like you...

1035
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,022
I can't believe that
you know Hanover Lake.

1036
00:51:24,057 --> 00:51:26,260
It is literally my
favorite place on earth.

1037
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:28,428
It's like, all you need
to know about me.

1038
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:31,633
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

1039
00:51:33,552 --> 00:51:36,013
Jesus Christ, we're playing Suck
and Blow, people. Game faces.

1040
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:42,018
Oh, God.
Randy's in the hospital.

1041
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,486
He got mauled by
a fucking buffalo.

1042
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:47,489
Some asshole stole his phone.
That's why he hasn't texted.

1043
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:51,195
- Oh, my God, I'm such a bitch.
- Do you want me to come with you?

1044
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,280
Probably not, right?

1045
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,616
All right, bye.

1046
00:51:58,494 --> 00:51:59,793
Let her go, man.

1047
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:02,498
Sometimes the heart
is a lonely hunter.

1048
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:07,211
Do you want to cry?
I'll fucking cry for you.

1049
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,880
Do you want to make out with me?

1050
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:11,590
No? Kenny, you can come too.

1051
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:14,801
You look like a watcher.

1052
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:22,524
He's waking up, dude.

1053
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,693
I can't just leave it.
It says "DOUCHEBA"...

1054
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:26,939
- No one's gonna get it.
- The public will understand.

1055
00:52:26,974 --> 00:52:29,107
- This is my art.
- Stop being such a diva.

1056
00:52:30,818 --> 00:52:33,821
Fuck, dude... we gotta go!

1057
00:52:36,698 --> 00:52:38,659
What the fuck?

1058
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:44,873
Top floor, baby, top floor!

1059
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:49,593
- What the hell is this?
Holy shit.

1060
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:51,922
- What is this place?
OK, shit just got weird.

1061
00:52:51,957 --> 00:52:54,515
Congratulations, players.

1062
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:56,600
You've completed
the Tower of Power.

1063
00:52:56,635 --> 00:53:00,347
- You PJ Brill?
- Please, call me Tower Master.

1064
00:53:00,382 --> 00:53:01,849
These are my sweet bitches.

1065
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:04,358
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- What's up, sweet bitches?

1066
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:09,731
- Look, we're friends with Jeff Chang...
- Now, here is your reward.

1067
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:11,959
Gold beads?
You gotta be kidding me, dude.

1068
00:53:11,994 --> 00:53:13,678
All right, are you
fucking serious, man?

1069
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:15,705
I want more than gold
fucking beads.

1070
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,663
Miller, it's not
about the beads, man.

1071
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:19,575
They gave me 50 bucks for
this whole party, all right?

1072
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,959
Fifty bucks! The chair,
it was 40! All right?

1073
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:23,912
These chicks, I'm paying them
five bucks each tonight.

1074
00:53:23,947 --> 00:53:25,337
So maybe you guys
could cut me a break.

1075
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:27,422
Maybe he can cut us a break 'cause
I just chugged a gallon of milk.

1076
00:53:27,457 --> 00:53:30,043
Went through your little rat race. I'm
all excited, get to the top floor and

1077
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:33,338
look what I got, look at this. I have
a baby wizard Elvis with gold beads.

1078
00:53:33,373 --> 00:53:35,816
I'm sorry you got free booze
and free milk. Shit!

1079
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:38,225
My fault, buddy! OK, do you know
how much milk costs?

1080
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,866
- Like, it's more than gasoline.
- We're friends with Jeff Chang...

1081
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:43,473
Hey, can I get my banana? These dudes
are like stressing me. Thanks.

1082
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:48,437
- OK, who are we talking about?
- JeffChang. He used to live here.

1083
00:53:48,472 --> 00:53:51,290
- You were his RA. The cops came in here...
- Oh, yeah, yeah!

1084
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:54,109
He got super wasted and we're
just trying to get him home.

1085
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:56,195
No, I don't know where
that little psycho lives, man.

1086
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,995
Why you calling him a psycho?
What's that about?

1087
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,886
Dude, the guy got arrested
for attempted murder, right?

1088
00:53:59,921 --> 00:54:01,707
What?
- Yeah, that's fucking psycho, right?

1089
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:04,453
- Murder? Are you kidding me?
- Bullshit. Who did he try to kill?

1090
00:54:04,488 --> 00:54:06,830
I don't know, but he had a gun
and he fucking used it, dude.

1091
00:54:06,865 --> 00:54:08,957
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Yeah. Right?

1092
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:10,626
You know,
the boy's a little nuts.

1093
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:14,046
Coming from a man in a diaper,
eating a banana.

1094
00:54:14,081 --> 00:54:15,804
OK, I get it.

1095
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,640
I might not look
like your average dude. OK?

1096
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:19,975
That's for sure.
- But I've got bitches

1097
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:23,013
and I've got goblets and
I wake up in the morning happy.

1098
00:54:23,048 --> 00:54:23,847
Miller...
- Your nipples are just

1099
00:54:24,473 --> 00:54:26,600
- looking right at me.
- What the fuck, man?

1100
00:54:26,635 --> 00:54:28,317
- Uh, thanks for nothing.
- OK.

1101
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:29,978
- PJ Brill, you fucking weirdo.
Let's get out of here.

1102
00:54:30,013 --> 00:54:31,445
Have some beer, have some milk.

1103
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,733
I'll try to get iPods for you guys next time.
That'd be great, right?

1104
00:54:34,768 --> 00:54:36,950
This is bullshit.

1105
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:40,217
You don't think JeffChang actually
tried to kill someone, do you?

1106
00:54:40,252 --> 00:54:43,450
No, I don't. I think JeffChang is fine.
I think everything is fine.

1107
00:54:43,485 --> 00:54:47,294
- Look at that asshole.
- Yeah, what an idiot.

1108
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:49,915
- Wait. Is that JeffChang?
What is he wearing?

1109
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,250
Oh, my God, he's drinking again.

1110
00:54:51,285 --> 00:54:52,800
- Fuck me!
- Move.

1111
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:55,587
- JeffChang! We're coming!
- Put the bottle down, buddy!

1112
00:54:59,376 --> 00:55:02,299
Yeah!

1113
00:55:02,334 --> 00:55:05,222
Mommy, look at me dance!
Look at me dance!

1114
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:07,683
Look at me dance!

1115
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:11,603
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my God.

1116
00:55:12,563 --> 00:55:13,904
Suck my dick, bear!

1117
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:17,109
Suck my motherfucking dick,
bear!

1118
00:55:17,144 --> 00:55:19,535
Yeah!

1119
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:22,197
Hey, chipmunk, hey,
I'm one of the good guys.

1120
00:55:22,232 --> 00:55:24,074
We're gonna get you
some clothes, OK?

1121
00:55:24,109 --> 00:55:25,534
It's all gonna be OK.

1122
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:27,953
You'll never catch me alive.

1123
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:31,206
Ah, fuck!

1124
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:34,258
Fuck!

1125
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:38,887
I'm gonna kick his ass!

1126
00:55:38,922 --> 00:55:41,466
We're not gonna kick your ass! We
do need you to come back, though!

1127
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:09,036
Whoo!

1128
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:13,255
Oh, shit! Lookit...

1129
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,585
- It's the big bad po-po!
- Get down, sir.

1130
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:19,213
Get down immediately.

1131
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:23,300
- What are you doing, sir?
- I think he's getting down.

1132
00:56:23,335 --> 00:56:25,469
- Yeah, I know, I see that.
- I'm just saying, technically,

1133
00:56:25,504 --> 00:56:27,304
he's doing what
you asked him to do.

1134
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:30,397
What the fuck?

1135
00:56:30,432 --> 00:56:32,232
OK, sir,
please remove yourself...

1136
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:34,269
He's our friend!

1137
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:35,562
What the hell is this?

1138
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:38,238
- Dr. Chang! Hi. What are you...
- Hey.

1139
00:56:38,273 --> 00:56:40,192
- It's so good to see you, man!
- Great to see you.

1140
00:56:40,651 --> 00:56:42,820
Where's my son?

1141
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:47,664
He's home. He's in bed.
He's sleeping.

1142
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:51,411
- Why don't I believe you?
- Because you're suspicious and mean?

1143
00:56:51,446 --> 00:56:53,705
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, touch my fucking ass, dude!

1144
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,131
Come on! OK. OK.

1145
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:59,176
Hey! Why are you asking about
Jeffrey? Is everything OK?

1146
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:02,464
I have reason to believe that the
three of you have been out drinking.

1147
00:57:02,499 --> 00:57:06,089
What? No. We put Jeff to bed at
like nine o'clock, right, Miller?

1148
00:57:06,124 --> 00:57:09,680
<i>Yeah, we watched Cold Case, made
paninis and then went to bed.</i>

1149
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:13,642
Yeah, then Miller and I came out
for a drink, or nine.

1150
00:57:13,677 --> 00:57:16,979
What?

1151
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:20,023
Your parents must be
so proud of you.

1152
00:57:20,058 --> 00:57:21,740
- Get him!
- Free OJ!

1153
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:23,402
- Free the dolphins!
- Hm...!

1154
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:25,828
Fuck you, cop!

1155
00:57:25,863 --> 00:57:27,406
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck.

1156
00:57:27,441 --> 00:57:29,998
Oh, you kids today.

1157
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:32,578
Every one of you is spoiled,
drunk and fat!

1158
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:35,914
- Oh, my God, right?
- Thank you, sir.

1159
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:37,040
- Appreciate it.
Look.

1160
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,295
- Miller, look.
- Fuck that!

1161
00:58:03,066 --> 00:58:05,068
Here are tonight's winners.

1162
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:13,417
Jesus.

1163
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:16,371
I feel like someone should
break those two up, right?

1164
00:58:16,406 --> 00:58:18,213
Do you see your friend or what?

1165
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:21,084
No, is there anywhere else
you might have taken him?

1166
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,879
- Jeffrey Reginald Chang?
- Yeah.

1167
00:58:23,914 --> 00:58:25,762
- Ooh...
- What? What is it?

1168
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:28,682
They've taken him to
Health Services.

1169
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:31,470
- What does that mean?
- I wouldn't want to speculate.

1170
00:58:31,505 --> 00:58:33,562
Look, I'm sure he's OK.

1171
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:35,557
No, he's not OK, Miller.
He could be in a coma.

1172
00:58:35,592 --> 00:58:37,305
- You understand that?
- No, yeah. Absolutely.

1173
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,139
All right, how do we get
to Health Services?

1174
00:58:39,174 --> 00:58:40,702
- You're gonna wanna go...
- I can take you.

1175
00:58:40,737 --> 00:58:42,231
Who are you? Why is she
wearing an orange vest?

1176
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:44,698
I'm Cara.
I'm a campus security escort.

1177
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:46,527
- Why don't you come with me?
- Of course you are.

1178
00:58:46,562 --> 00:58:48,327
- I will come with you. Casey.
- What?

1179
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:51,052
- She's an escort. Whatever.
- She not that kind of escort.

1180
00:58:51,087 --> 00:58:53,742
No, I love the name Cara. In
fact, my mother's name is Cara.

1181
00:58:53,777 --> 00:58:55,619
Your mother's name is Beth.
Everybody knows that.

1182
00:58:55,654 --> 00:58:57,586
Yeah, but I call her Cara,
sometimes.

1183
00:58:57,621 --> 00:58:59,748
But, Cara, where are
your people from? Italy?

1184
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:02,299
- Mexico.
- Latinas.

1185
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:03,967
- Whoa... ladies...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1186
00:59:04,002 --> 00:59:06,672
A lot of Latinas. Ladies,
let's just talk about this.

1187
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:12,434
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck, dude?

1188
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:15,430
Where the fuck are we?
I don't like this.

1189
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:18,357
- What are you freaks looking at?
- Why are we here?

1190
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:21,019
- What the fuck is going on right now?
- I don't want to be here.

1191
00:59:21,054 --> 00:59:23,897
- Why aren't you guys saying anything?
- Holy shit, dude.

1192
00:59:23,932 --> 00:59:26,198
- We are shackled.
- Why are we shackled?

1193
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:28,735
- Why are you wearing a fucking tube sock?
- Why are you wearing a sock?

1194
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:31,755
- They match. Whose socks are these?
- We are so fucked.

1195
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:34,706
Welcome to the Tribunal of Justice.
- What?

1196
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:38,579
These two men stand accused
of infiltrating our sacred home,

1197
00:59:38,614 --> 00:59:41,203
violating the dignity
of two of our pledges,

1198
00:59:41,238 --> 00:59:43,286
and destroying our
award-winning rose garden.

1199
00:59:43,321 --> 00:59:45,300
Look, if I could just
respond to all that...

1200
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:48,422
- What sayest the sisterhood?
Guilty as charged!

1201
00:59:48,457 --> 00:59:51,056
OK, look, in our
country, America,

1202
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:53,135
usually there's like a trial
and some evidence and shit!

1203
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:55,804
- You're not just guilty.
- The punishment shall match the crime.

1204
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,147
The aggrieved may enter
the circle of vengeance.

1205
00:59:58,182 --> 01:00:01,977
The circle of what? Hold on.
Holy shit, look who it is.

1206
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:04,736
Holy shit, these chicks
are gonna tear us up.

1207
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:07,711
Assume the position.
- Wait, actually, you know what?

1208
01:00:07,746 --> 01:00:10,652
I didn't even spank them. That was all him.
I wasn't even...

1209
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:12,369
- What are you...?
- Fuck you, dude. I'm sorry.

1210
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:14,323
Punishment grows more severe
every second you delay.

1211
01:00:14,358 --> 01:00:17,075
- Ready, sister?
- Ready.

1212
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:22,059
Assume the position.

1213
01:00:22,094 --> 01:00:24,166
- OK, OK, OK.
- Oh, my God.

1214
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:28,879
OK, Chantelle, I have a rare skin
condition on my upper thighs,

1215
01:00:28,914 --> 01:00:30,460
so if you could
just avoid that area.

1216
01:00:30,495 --> 01:00:32,007
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- Thanks, Chantelle.

1217
01:00:32,758 --> 01:00:34,301
I'll totally watch it
while I just...

1218
01:00:34,336 --> 01:00:36,643
Oh, my God, holy shit!

1219
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:39,188
- Oh, my God!
Ow! Ow!

1220
01:00:39,223 --> 01:00:42,059
You just had to fuck with these girls, didn't you?

1221
01:00:42,094 --> 01:00:44,895
Holy shit! Yeah, when a lady asks you
to spank her ass, you spank that ass!

1222
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,689
Oh, great. You know what? You
are fucking unbelievable, man!

1223
01:00:47,724 --> 01:00:50,150
- It's called having manners, Casey!
- Fuck my face!

1224
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:52,402
Enough. Turn around.

1225
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:54,863
It hurts. It hurts.

1226
01:00:55,823 --> 01:00:57,241
It hurts.

1227
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,619
Look, Goat Mask Lady...

1228
01:01:00,654 --> 01:01:02,085
Please.

1229
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,505
- I mean, like, we're really sorry.
- Yeah.

1230
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,583
We're just trying to get
our friend JeffChang home.

1231
01:01:06,618 --> 01:01:08,669
- Justice has been served...
- Oh, thank God.

1232
01:01:08,704 --> 01:01:09,968
...for the first offense.

1233
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,422
- What?
- To address the second offense,

1234
01:01:12,457 --> 01:01:14,842
the offenders will
now commence making out.

1235
01:01:14,877 --> 01:01:16,058
- Oh, fuck! Yeah, right.
- What?

1236
01:01:16,093 --> 01:01:17,518
You guys really
don't want to see that.

1237
01:01:17,553 --> 01:01:20,180
That's a joke, that's
disgusting. You're weird.

1238
01:01:20,215 --> 01:01:22,773
The longer you wait,
the longer the kiss.

1239
01:01:22,808 --> 01:01:25,561
- Look, there's no way I'm kissing him.
- Yeah I'm sorry, that's just...

1240
01:01:25,596 --> 01:01:28,164
All those who want to see the
offenders kiss, stomp your feet.

1241
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:30,697
That's unfair! Clearly we're outnumbered.

1242
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:32,943
Yeah, OK, look, you guys
can stomp your feet all you want,

1243
01:01:32,978 --> 01:01:34,618
there's no way I'm
making out with a dude!

1244
01:01:34,653 --> 01:01:39,116
Do it. Or be forever branded
with the mark of the sisterhood.

1245
01:01:39,151 --> 01:01:40,374
Holy shit.

1246
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:42,376
Dude, I can't get branded.

1247
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:45,539
I'm gonna like not be able to get
buried in a Jewish cemetery or...

1248
01:01:45,574 --> 01:01:47,416
Fuck it.

1249
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:50,008
Really?

1250
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:51,295
Fuck it, dude.

1251
01:01:54,173 --> 01:01:57,467
I just... I wish you were wearing more
than a tube sock, but fuck it, baby.

1252
01:01:57,502 --> 01:01:59,386
I really wish you
didn't call me baby.

1253
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:01,221
OK.

1254
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:04,523
- Tongue?
- Of course, tongue.

1255
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:06,018
Really? You had
to fucking ask for tongue?

1256
01:02:06,053 --> 01:02:08,187
I'm sorry, that was stupid.

1257
01:02:15,611 --> 01:02:17,946
- Oh, grab his boobie.
- You never even did that.

1258
01:02:17,981 --> 01:02:19,239
Do it, offender.

1259
01:02:27,873 --> 01:02:31,550
Dude, are you getting
a chubby right now?

1260
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:34,046
Dude, I can't help it. You're
actually kind of a good kisser.

1261
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:36,215
You know what? I'm fucking done.

1262
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:47,226
- None of that ever happened.
- Ever.

1263
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:51,028
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

1264
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:53,315
We need to find
some clothes, man.

1265
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,567
We'll get some
at Health Services.

1266
01:02:57,694 --> 01:02:59,077
- Thanks, dude.
- Hey.

1267
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:00,447
All right,
it's already 6:00 a.m.

1268
01:03:00,482 --> 01:03:01,747
We gotta hurry up
and get JeffChang.

1269
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:04,576
Dude, if I walk any
faster my sock's gonna fall off.

1270
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:08,337
- This is all your fault.
- What?

1271
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:10,297
You made JeffChang go out,
got him wasted,

1272
01:03:10,332 --> 01:03:13,293
you fucked with the Latin sorority
girls, you pulled a gun out on Randy.

1273
01:03:13,328 --> 01:03:15,093
OK, look, you cannot pin
all this on me, Casey.

1274
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,464
You're the reason why we are
currently walking through campus

1275
01:03:17,499 --> 01:03:19,817
at six in the morning wearing
only socks on our cocks!

1276
01:03:19,852 --> 01:03:22,100
OK. I'm sorry for trying
to show you guys a good time.

1277
01:03:22,135 --> 01:03:24,847
You know what, man, we're done. OK?
When this is over don't e-mail me,

1278
01:03:24,882 --> 01:03:26,682
- don't text me, don't call me, don't poke me...
- Whoa!

1279
01:03:26,717 --> 01:03:27,898
...you and me are fucking over!

1280
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:30,811
Oh, and another thing,
Sidewinder sucks!

1281
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:32,861
Take it back.

1282
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:34,690
It's hot, it's dirty,
the people are gross,

1283
01:03:34,725 --> 01:03:36,073
and half the acts
are fucking DJs.

1284
01:03:36,108 --> 01:03:37,922
Why would I want
to spend a week of my life

1285
01:03:37,957 --> 01:03:39,736
watching some asshole
in a pink track suit

1286
01:03:39,771 --> 01:03:40,828
play his fucking iPod for me?

1287
01:03:40,863 --> 01:03:42,121
Because your friends
are gonna be there...

1288
01:03:42,156 --> 01:03:44,248
I'm not going to some
stupid fucking music festival

1289
01:03:44,283 --> 01:03:47,202
just to preserve the illusion that
we're still friends because we're not.

1290
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:49,121
We're not still friends anymore,
Miller.

1291
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,168
OK. It's cool, man.

1292
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:57,504
So since we're not friends, I can tell
you how fucking lame you've been.

1293
01:03:57,539 --> 01:03:59,221
I can tell you that you probably
should go to Wall Street

1294
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:02,092
and that you should spend the funnest
years of your life in an office.

1295
01:04:02,127 --> 01:04:03,934
Working for the man,
wearing a cute little suit.

1296
01:04:03,969 --> 01:04:06,597
It's called growing up, dude.
Why don't you look into it?

1297
01:04:06,632 --> 01:04:08,814
I don't need to grow up, bro,
you need to grow down.

1298
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:10,225
- That's not even an expression!
- Well, today it is! OK?

1299
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:11,602
Do you remember what it's like
to have fun, to be cool,

1300
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:13,874
to give a shit
about your friends?

1301
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:15,320
- You've changed.
- Oh, my God.

1302
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:17,489
You don't have fucking balls
anymore. You're a little bitch.

1303
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:21,195
Well, you know what, man? You're just
the fucking same desperate, low-life,

1304
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,870
- fucking loser that you've always been.
- Yeah?

1305
01:04:22,905 --> 01:04:25,289
- Yeah. So fucking kudos to you, man!
- Don't fucking push me.

1306
01:04:25,324 --> 01:04:27,784
- Don't start...
- You're a fucking dick, dude! Fucking white trash!

1307
01:04:27,819 --> 01:04:31,622
Fucking hands off! Yeah, take it, bitch!

1308
01:04:31,657 --> 01:04:33,540
Fucking asshole!
Could fight...

1309
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:37,544
You fight like a girl.

1310
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:48,263
Health Services,
how can I direct your call?

1311
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:52,184
I'll call you back.

1312
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:57,780
Mental Health, third floor.

1313
01:04:57,815 --> 01:05:00,651
- You're hilarious.
- We're here to pick up our friend.

1314
01:05:00,686 --> 01:05:01,950
Name of patient?

1315
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:04,119
Jeffrey Reginald Chang.

1316
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:07,199
Plus if you had any clothes, that
would be greatly appreciated.

1317
01:05:08,158 --> 01:05:10,626
He's here. Let me get his file.

1318
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:13,497
And if you could please
hurry up, we're in a rush here.

1319
01:05:14,456 --> 01:05:16,917
Thank God I don't know
anyone at this school.

1320
01:05:18,836 --> 01:05:20,212
Casey?

1321
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:24,056
Nicole. Hi.

1322
01:05:24,091 --> 01:05:26,725
Um... where are your clothes?

1323
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,680
We just got jumped by some
girls. It's a long story.

1324
01:05:29,715 --> 01:05:31,522
- I bet.
- What are you doing here?

1325
01:05:31,557 --> 01:05:34,518
Um... Randy got mauled
by a buffalo, remember?

1326
01:05:34,553 --> 01:05:36,913
Right, yes! How is that guy?

1327
01:05:36,948 --> 01:05:39,238
- He's fine, I guess.
- Yeah?

1328
01:05:39,273 --> 01:05:44,111
I mean, I came over here to check on
him and he got all agro on me again.

1329
01:05:44,146 --> 01:05:47,531
And then, I got pissed
and we broke up.

1330
01:05:47,566 --> 01:05:48,914
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1331
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,242
So, we're pretty much done.

1332
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:52,161
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1333
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,454
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, oh, it's fine.

1334
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:56,964
I mean, we weren't
really that serious.

1335
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:59,209
- But, still, I mean...
- Yeah, it was a long time coming.

1336
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:01,218
- OK.
- Anyway...

1337
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:02,553
...it looks like I'm going to

1338
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:04,548
South America
by myself now, so...

1339
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:06,265
- Oh, right, the trip.
- Mm-hm.

1340
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,177
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, I'm still going.

1341
01:06:08,212 --> 01:06:09,351
Cool.

1342
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:12,681
Yeah, my flight leaves
in a few hours, so...

1343
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,435
...I guess this is goodbye.

1344
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,026
OK.

1345
01:06:24,943 --> 01:06:26,570
Bye.

1346
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:30,824
- Can I go with you?
- No thanks, I'm good.

1347
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:32,159
OK, well, whenever
you're not good,

1348
01:06:32,451 --> 01:06:35,537
<i>I'll be right here, reading Perfect Bride.</i>

1349
01:06:35,572 --> 01:06:37,873
<i>What, I can't read
Perfect Bride, bro?</i>

1350
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:41,939
I'm sorry, Jeffrey Chang
is on 24-hour hold.

1351
01:06:42,211 --> 01:06:43,941
He can't be released
until tomorrow morning.

1352
01:06:43,976 --> 01:06:45,950
- What?
- No, he's gotta be home by 7:00 a.m.

1353
01:06:45,985 --> 01:06:47,925
- Why is he on hold?
- It's confidential.

1354
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,349
Oh, it's confidential, Casey.
Give me that.

1355
01:06:49,384 --> 01:06:53,096
Hey! Give that back immediately!
Give me that! You, stop!

1356
01:06:53,131 --> 01:06:54,807
My God, look how many times
he's been in here, man.

1357
01:06:54,842 --> 01:06:56,850
Give that back to me,
you little shit!

1358
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:59,276
Oh, my God.

1359
01:06:59,311 --> 01:07:01,445
"Patient was brought in
for attempted murder.

1360
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:05,275
Later determined his weapon
misfired during a suicide attempt."

1361
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:07,277
JeffChang tried to
commit suicide?

1362
01:07:09,196 --> 01:07:10,864
Get out. Now!

1363
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:18,705
Dude, what the fuck is going on?

1364
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:22,382
I mean, JeffChang
was always the happy one.

1365
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:25,379
What were we supposed to do?
He didn't tell us anything.

1366
01:07:25,414 --> 01:07:28,222
Dude, look, fuck that. OK?

1367
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:31,760
We are his best friends, and he
felt like he couldn't even call us.

1368
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:34,179
That sucks.

1369
01:07:35,139 --> 01:07:36,098
We suck.

1370
01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:41,353
What happened, man?

1371
01:07:42,312 --> 01:07:43,730
We used to be so close and...

1372
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:46,817
Ah, fuck.

1373
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:51,572
- Thanks, Erin.
- No problem, Gary. See you next time.

1374
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:55,951
Jesus, not The Chief again.

1375
01:07:55,986 --> 01:07:57,626
What's up, Chief?

1376
01:07:57,661 --> 01:07:59,628
Oh, hey, dudes.
How was your night?

1377
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:02,124
- Pretty terrible, actually.
- Tell me about it.

1378
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:04,585
I ripped two sheets of LSD
and spent the whole night

1379
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:07,004
dancing in front of
my house again.

1380
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,006
Now I gotta go teach.

1381
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:15,596
Wait. Did The Chief
just say he was

1382
01:08:15,637 --> 01:08:17,556
dancing in front of his house
the whole night?

1383
01:08:17,591 --> 01:08:19,398
- Yeah, so what?
- That's it!

1384
01:08:19,433 --> 01:08:20,746
- What's it?
- Oh, my God, that's it!

1385
01:08:20,781 --> 01:08:22,067
What's it? What are you
talking about?

1386
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:23,416
OK. So, the first time
we saw The Chief

1387
01:08:23,451 --> 01:08:24,966
was in front of
JeffChang's place, right?

1388
01:08:25,001 --> 01:08:26,447
And then we saw him
like nine more times.

1389
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:28,942
Right, and we thought that he was just
wandering around campus all night

1390
01:08:28,977 --> 01:08:31,618
just like we were.
But what if he wasn't?

1391
01:08:31,653 --> 01:08:35,372
What if The Chief was in the exact
same place the entire time?

1392
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:38,577
Then that would mean we walked past
JeffChang's place a dozen times.

1393
01:08:38,612 --> 01:08:40,245
- Oh, my God!
- Yes, and that's why JeffChang

1394
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,545
kept mumbling those
Indian chants.

1395
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,206
It was because he was trying
to tell us where he lived.

1396
01:08:43,241 --> 01:08:45,121
<i>It's like The Da Vinci Code
except it makes sense.</i>

1397
01:08:45,156 --> 01:08:46,967
Oh, my God, we are officially
the two biggest morons

1398
01:08:47,002 --> 01:08:50,047
- in the entire world.
- Yeah. Hey, Chief, where do you live?

1399
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:52,966
- Um... Fifth and Broadway.
- Fifth and Broadway.

1400
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:54,527
All right, so wait,
here's what we gotta do.

1401
01:08:54,562 --> 01:08:56,018
- We gotta break JeffChang out.
- Break him out.

1402
01:08:56,053 --> 01:08:58,347
- Get him home, gotta get him sober...
- Sober him up.

1403
01:08:58,382 --> 01:09:00,408
...and then we gotta
get him showered and dressed

1404
01:09:00,443 --> 01:09:02,434
before his dad shows up,
which is in 36 minutes.

1405
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:04,349
- That sounds totally impossible.
- Yeah?

1406
01:09:04,384 --> 01:09:06,230
Well, I'm not gonna
let JeffChang down again.

1407
01:09:06,265 --> 01:09:07,731
No, let's get that
little fucker home.

1408
01:09:07,815 --> 01:09:10,108
Wait, wait.
Are we best friends again?

1409
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:12,402
- No.
- Right. No, I'm not either.

1410
01:09:12,437 --> 01:09:13,327
Cool.

1411
01:09:16,949 --> 01:09:19,409
Hey, hey, you can't be in here!

1412
01:09:19,444 --> 01:09:20,667
<i>♪ Come on! ♪</i>

1413
01:09:20,702 --> 01:09:22,120
- JeffChang!
- JeffChang!

1414
01:09:22,155 --> 01:09:23,764
- JeffChang!
- God, God!

1415
01:09:25,518 --> 01:09:27,132
- JeffChang!
- JeffChang!

1416
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,503
Have you seen a little Asian with
shit on his face? No? Thank you.

1417
01:09:29,538 --> 01:09:31,011
- JeffChang!
- JeffChang!

1418
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:33,131
Hey, he's in here!
Nice!

1419
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:34,775
We're gonna break you out,
buddy.

1420
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:36,350
- JeffChang!
- He's barely coherent.

1421
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:39,054
Man, how're we gonna get him outta here?

1422
01:09:39,089 --> 01:09:41,428
There's like
orderlies everywhere!

1423
01:09:41,463 --> 01:09:43,732
Casey.
I just had an awesome idea.

1424
01:09:43,767 --> 01:09:45,901
This is definitely
not an awesome idea.

1425
01:09:45,936 --> 01:09:47,980
It'll be fine.
I've done this a thousand times.

1426
01:09:48,015 --> 01:09:49,446
No, that's what
you said last time.

1427
01:09:49,481 --> 01:09:52,151
Hey, you gotta trust me. Now bring
him a little to the left. OK.

1428
01:09:52,186 --> 01:09:53,826
No, no, we gotta
pull him back up.

1429
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:56,078
That's the Spirit
Mobile. It's super tall.

1430
01:09:56,113 --> 01:09:58,490
- I don't like this ride, guys.
No, it's too far down!

1431
01:09:58,525 --> 01:10:00,701
- Pull him back up!
- OK. You're right. Let's pull him up.

1432
01:10:00,736 --> 01:10:01,660
- Oh, shit!
- Miller!

1433
01:10:03,912 --> 01:10:06,331
Oh, my God! Did we just
kill JeffChang again?

1434
01:10:11,128 --> 01:10:13,095
Where's...?
Where's the Spirit Mobile?

1435
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:14,652
- I don't know. It was right here.
- Oh, no,

1436
01:10:14,687 --> 01:10:16,175
did they drive off
with JeffChang on it?

1437
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:17,558
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1438
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:20,387
I thought it was only 20 feet.
How am I supposed to know?

1439
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:26,602
Come on, guys.
Get in. We're late.

1440
01:10:27,561 --> 01:10:29,820
- What the fuck?
- Randy, look!

1441
01:10:29,855 --> 01:10:31,697
It's the guys who
stole your smart phone.

1442
01:10:31,732 --> 01:10:33,900
- Fuckers.
- Why are they taking your truck, Randy?

1443
01:10:33,935 --> 01:10:36,069
- Get out of the Spirit Mobile!
- Oh shit! Go, go, go!

1444
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:38,113
- Go!
- You're dead!

1445
01:10:38,148 --> 01:10:39,413
Hey!

1446
01:10:42,235 --> 01:10:44,918
- Bitch.
- Hey, what was that all about?

1447
01:10:44,953 --> 01:10:47,247
Don't worry about it, just drive, drive, drive.

1448
01:10:47,282 --> 01:10:49,541
- How'd you even start the car?
- The keys were in the ignition.

1449
01:10:49,576 --> 01:10:52,419
Fuck! I'm so late.
My dad's gonna kill me.

1450
01:11:05,724 --> 01:11:08,643
Hey, why is there a teddy bear
glued to my penis?

1451
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:11,563
No idea, no idea how
that could have happened.

1452
01:11:11,598 --> 01:11:13,238
I miss you guys.

1453
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:15,108
How come we never
hang out anymore?

1454
01:11:15,143 --> 01:11:16,944
- Wrong lane, wrong lane!
- Wrong lane!

1455
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:19,363
You're in the wrong lane!

1456
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:23,290
Oh, my God, JeffChang,
you're fucking crazy right now!

1457
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:26,161
- I feel really alert right now. I feel like Spider-Man.
- What?

1458
01:11:26,196 --> 01:11:28,539
I just really wish I
had my contacts on.

1459
01:11:28,574 --> 01:11:29,671
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck!

1460
01:11:29,706 --> 01:11:31,917
Parking meter, parking meter,
parking meter...!

1461
01:11:33,836 --> 01:11:36,693
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Oh, my God, oh, my God...

1462
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:39,550
Oh, shit! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1463
01:11:46,723 --> 01:11:48,725
Hit the brake, dude. Dude, hit
the brake! Hit the brake!

1464
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,685
- No, stop!
- Dude, do it!

1465
01:11:49,893 --> 01:11:52,062
Get off!

1466
01:11:53,021 --> 01:11:56,115
Ow!

1467
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:58,158
Look, I don't want to die.
I want to go back to college.

1468
01:11:58,193 --> 01:12:00,779
I want to go to Alaska, I want
to make out with a black chick!

1469
01:12:00,814 --> 01:12:02,715
- I wanna fuck Casey's sister!
- What?

1470
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,616
- You dropped out of school?
- Yeah!

1471
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:05,784
Why would you do that, Miller?

1472
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:08,162
Turn around and drive the car,
please!

1473
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:15,627
Oh, my God, we're going to jail.
We're going to jail.

1474
01:12:16,587 --> 01:12:18,630
- I can shake them, no problem.
- No, don't shake them.

1475
01:12:18,665 --> 01:12:20,424
Don't shake them!

1476
01:12:20,459 --> 01:12:22,683
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

1477
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:24,928
We're not on the street anymore.
This is not where cars go.

1478
01:12:24,963 --> 01:12:26,847
Cars don't go here.
Cars don't go here, JeffChang!

1479
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:32,227
Oh, my God. Are your eyes open?

1480
01:12:32,262 --> 01:12:33,479
- Fuck you.
- I can't tell.

1481
01:12:33,979 --> 01:12:37,149
- Oh, no. Oh, my God.
- Out of my way, nerds!

1482
01:12:39,067 --> 01:12:40,068
Hey, did you see that guy?

1483
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:43,579
Casey, we need to
neutralize the target

1484
01:12:43,614 --> 01:12:45,449
'cause he doesn't know what
the fuck's going on right now.

1485
01:12:45,484 --> 01:12:47,493
- Come on, guys.
Shit, shit, shit.

1486
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:06,386
Yeah, maybe I shouldn't
be driving.

1487
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:24,203
It's 6:51, we have nine minutes to
clean him up before his dad gets here.

1488
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:26,949
- Guys, my back hurts.
- Yeah, we threw you out a third-story window onto a SUV.

1489
01:13:26,984 --> 01:13:29,034
- What? Why would you do that?
You told us to.

1490
01:13:29,069 --> 01:13:30,209
Why would I say that?

1491
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:31,495
Because we're your
best friends. We love you.

1492
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:32,996
Get him in the house!
Get him in!

1493
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:36,131
What do we do about the bear?

1494
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,876
I don't know, man, just fucking
hold him or something.

1495
01:13:37,911 --> 01:13:39,760
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

1496
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:42,179
- Holy shit! What are you doing?
- Pull harder.

1497
01:13:42,214 --> 01:13:44,800
- I don't want to rip his dick off!
- I don't want that either!

1498
01:13:44,835 --> 01:13:46,558
- Fuck you!
- Seriously, pull harder, dude!

1499
01:13:46,593 --> 01:13:49,096
I don't know, man, JeffChang has
a super stretchy penis!

1500
01:13:49,131 --> 01:13:51,449
- Pull harder, dude!
- I'm trying to!

1501
01:13:51,484 --> 01:13:53,767
Fucking come on!

1502
01:13:54,726 --> 01:13:57,569
Oh, my God!

1503
01:13:57,604 --> 01:13:59,530
Dude, we just
circumcised JeffChang.

1504
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:01,775
- Who cares? Get him in the bathroom.
- Come on, buddy!

1505
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:13,411
Dude, I can't believe
we actually pulled this off.

1506
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,455
Yeah, of course we did, man,
we're fucking awesome.

1507
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:18,298
- Small arms.
- Whatever. Come on.

1508
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:20,801
- There we go.
- I don't know if I can do this.

1509
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:23,401
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, what do you mean?

1510
01:14:23,436 --> 01:14:25,966
I mean, like, I don't know
if I want go to med school

1511
01:14:26,001 --> 01:14:27,301
or be a doctor or any of it.

1512
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:32,479
- Now you fucking tell us?
Miller, shut up.

1513
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:34,600
No, dude, are you serious?
I fucking kissed a guy for you!

1514
01:14:34,635 --> 01:14:35,649
- Miller!
- What?

1515
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:38,604
Yeah, I kissed Casey.
It was fucking gross.

1516
01:14:38,639 --> 01:14:39,956
- Yeah.
- Miller, shut up.

1517
01:14:39,991 --> 01:14:41,238
- What?
Let him talk.

1518
01:14:41,273 --> 01:14:43,650
Look, I'm sort of
losing my shit up here.

1519
01:14:46,528 --> 01:14:49,031
We heard that you
tried to off yourself.

1520
01:14:49,066 --> 01:14:51,331
- Miller, really?
- What?

1521
01:14:51,366 --> 01:14:53,167
- Why'd you do it, man?
- I didn't.

1522
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:56,712
- So then, what...?
- I mean, I did, sort of. I...

1523
01:14:56,747 --> 01:14:59,583
I was up for 72 hours studying.
I was cracked out on pills.

1524
01:14:59,618 --> 01:15:01,877
I was literally
hallucinating in my room,

1525
01:15:01,912 --> 01:15:03,552
but I didn't actually try to...

1526
01:15:03,587 --> 01:15:06,215
- Right. I do weird shit when I hallucinate too.
- Yeah.

1527
01:15:08,133 --> 01:15:10,267
- You know?
- The doctors say I'm not suicidal.

1528
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:12,805
They just think I'm fucking
stressed out of my mind.

1529
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,095
- I mean, you guys know my dad.
- Yeah.

1530
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:17,316
Yeah. He's been
riding me my whole life

1531
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:20,270
to go to med school and be
a doctor, but I hate medicine.

1532
01:15:20,305 --> 01:15:23,690
I suck in science.
I'm fucking miserable.

1533
01:15:23,725 --> 01:15:25,699
- So, don't do it.
- Yeah. Fuck it.

1534
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:28,695
Oh, shit, he's here. What should I do?

1535
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:30,548
Honestly, I think you
have to tell him the truth, man.

1536
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:32,331
I think that's pretty obvious
to everybody in this room.

1537
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:34,827
- You gotta tell him the truth.
- Oh, my God, you guys are so white.

1538
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:36,543
What?
Dude, that's really racist.

1539
01:15:36,578 --> 01:15:38,372
Yeah. White people
have feelings too, man.

1540
01:15:38,413 --> 01:15:39,880
I can't just tell him the truth.

1541
01:15:39,915 --> 01:15:42,835
I come from like five generations of doctors.
I'm the first-born son.

1542
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:45,709
This is what's expected of me.

1543
01:15:45,744 --> 01:15:48,514
Fuck!

1544
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:52,344
Dude, it's the rest of your life, man.
Stop being such a fucking pussy.

1545
01:15:52,379 --> 01:15:54,388
He's your dad, dude.
He'll understand.

1546
01:15:54,423 --> 01:15:56,265
- I promise.
- Yeah.

1547
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:02,986
Whoo!

1548
01:16:03,021 --> 01:16:03,814
- Holy shit!
- What the fuck?

1549
01:16:03,849 --> 01:16:05,354
You just got rocked, boy!

1550
01:16:05,389 --> 01:16:06,824
- You OK, buddy?
- What?

1551
01:16:06,859 --> 01:16:08,867
- Bat me.
- That was so hot, Randy.

1552
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:11,947
Look, man, we're sorry that we stole
your truck, but like, calm down, man.

1553
01:16:11,982 --> 01:16:15,701
Oh, no, this isn't about my truck.

1554
01:16:15,736 --> 01:16:16,875
- OK! OK!
- Chill, chill!

1555
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:18,495
Oh, that lamp will
never work again, Randy!

1556
01:16:19,371 --> 01:16:21,588
- Yeah!
- OK, OK, OK, what is this about?

1557
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:24,251
- Is this about your phone?
- Right, OK, we're sorry, Randy,

1558
01:16:24,286 --> 01:16:26,051
that we stole your truck
and your cell phone.

1559
01:16:26,086 --> 01:16:30,257
- This ain't about my phone neither.
- Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1560
01:16:30,292 --> 01:16:31,765
- Stop!
- Bitch!

1561
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,308
That's my fucking boom box, man.

1562
01:16:33,343 --> 01:16:35,471
- What is it about? Is it about Nicole?
- Calm down!

1563
01:16:35,506 --> 01:16:37,389
Oh, my God, you didn't
even close with Nicole.

1564
01:16:37,424 --> 01:16:38,814
Yeah, but I was really close,
right?

1565
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:39,725
No, there's no such thing as
almost fucking his girlfriend.

1566
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:42,693
You either fucked his girlfriend
or you didn't.

1567
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:44,396
- Stop talking, assholes!
- He didn't fuck your girlfriend!

1568
01:16:44,431 --> 01:16:45,939
- No, no, no, no.
- He didn't fuck your girlfriend!

1569
01:16:45,974 --> 01:16:47,691
- That's what I'm saying.
- Is this a joke?

1570
01:16:47,726 --> 01:16:48,824
I almost... I almost did.

1571
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:51,403
Then you've almost
fucked every girl you know.

1572
01:16:51,438 --> 01:16:53,864
This is not about
my truck or my phone...

1573
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:56,457
...or... my... girl!

1574
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:59,453
- That's my laptop!
- Fuck your laptop! Get a desktop, bitch!

1575
01:16:59,488 --> 01:17:02,379
You know what? This is definitely
about the dart in the face.

1576
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:05,292
Honestly, I completely forgot about
the dart in your face. Are you OK?

1577
01:17:05,327 --> 01:17:07,134
- He's had a really rough night too.
- Shut up!

1578
01:17:07,169 --> 01:17:10,047
Come on, Randy! Do what I said,
fuck me in the ass, Randy!

1579
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:12,806
What?

1580
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:16,178
I mean, fuck them in the ass!
Just...

1581
01:17:16,213 --> 01:17:19,515
- What...
- The hell is going on here?

1582
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:20,390
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

1583
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:23,233
- Who the fuck is this guy?
- Hey.

1584
01:17:23,268 --> 01:17:26,188
I'm Jeffrey's father.
Who the fuck are you?

1585
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:28,322
I'm Randy.

1586
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:31,533
- He's Randy.
- That's Randy.

1587
01:17:31,568 --> 01:17:35,162
OK, Randy... I'm here to
take my son to his interview.

1588
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:38,116
Well, he's not going with you, so why
don't you just get the fuck outta here?

1589
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:42,836
Oh, no, he's definitely
coming with me.

1590
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:47,501
- Oh, shit.
- Look, old man... don't make me beat you in front of your son.

1591
01:17:47,536 --> 01:17:49,378
I wouldn't do that.

1592
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:53,388
- Holy shit!
- Shit!

1593
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:54,890
Whoa!

1594
01:17:54,925 --> 01:17:56,642
That's what fucking happens,
man.

1595
01:17:56,677 --> 01:18:00,013
Oh, your dad's
a dick. Oh, my arm.

1596
01:18:00,048 --> 01:18:00,973
You should probably stay down.

1597
01:18:01,008 --> 01:18:02,766
Let's go!

1598
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:06,103
OK, you need to tell him that you
don't want to be a doctor right now.

1599
01:18:06,138 --> 01:18:07,653
I don't think this
is a good time.

1600
01:18:07,688 --> 01:18:09,147
- Just fucking tell him.
- No. You tell him.

1601
01:18:09,182 --> 01:18:10,666
- No, no, no.
- I'm not fucking telling him.

1602
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:12,116
- You fucking tell him.
- You fucking tell him.

1603
01:18:12,151 --> 01:18:14,027
You're not a pussy.
I am a pussy.

1604
01:18:14,062 --> 01:18:15,571
Tell him right now.
- Let's go, Jeffrey.

1605
01:18:15,606 --> 01:18:16,446
Holy shit...

1606
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:21,910
Uh...

1607
01:18:23,829 --> 01:18:25,212
No, I'm not going.

1608
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:26,873
What the hell are
you talking about?

1609
01:18:26,908 --> 01:18:28,465
I don't want to go
to med school.

1610
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,377
- I don't want to be a doctor.
- Jeffrey.

1611
01:18:30,412 --> 01:18:33,502
I'm not...
No, I'm not a kid anymore, Dad.

1612
01:18:33,537 --> 01:18:36,557
I'm 21 years old and...
from here on out,

1613
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:39,643
I'm gonna decide what I do
with my life and that's that.

1614
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:42,389
What are you gonna do? Throw me off a roof?
These guys already did that.

1615
01:18:46,185 --> 01:18:48,020
OK.

1616
01:18:48,979 --> 01:18:50,481
I get it.

1617
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,650
- See, I told you he'd understand, man.
- I get it.

1618
01:18:53,685 --> 01:18:56,368
You're even dumber
than I thought.

1619
01:18:56,403 --> 01:18:58,822
- Get in the goddamn car, Jeffrey.
- No. No.

1620
01:18:58,857 --> 01:19:01,874
- You ungrateful little shit.
- Dad!

1621
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:05,245
I can't believe I raised a worthless
piece of shit like you...

1622
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,962
Oh, shit! Dude, what?

1623
01:19:06,997 --> 01:19:08,464
- That's my friend!
- Miller! Miller!

1624
01:19:08,499 --> 01:19:11,960
- That's my friend, dude.
- Just calm down.

1625
01:19:13,879 --> 01:19:15,255
No, Dad.

1626
01:19:17,174 --> 01:19:18,133
Why don't you just leave?

1627
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:21,345
Just leave.

1628
01:19:23,263 --> 01:19:24,890
Now.

1629
01:19:33,524 --> 01:19:36,652
Yeah, you just punched my dad in the face.

1630
01:19:36,687 --> 01:19:39,029
I know. It felt good, though.

1631
01:19:41,749 --> 01:19:42,866
Hey, man.

1632
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:46,578
My dad's a dick, too.

1633
01:19:47,538 --> 01:19:51,291
I, uh... I'm sorry I broke
your apartment.

1634
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:53,627
What the fuck is this?

1635
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:58,882
Just listen to your heart.

1636
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:03,137
- Listen to your heart.
- Yeah. All right, man. OK.

1637
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:09,518
- Nice apology, Randy.
- That was heartfelt, Randy.

1638
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:13,105
See ya, guys!

1639
01:20:14,064 --> 01:20:16,567
- Who are those guys?
- Those guys are the weirdest guys.

1640
01:20:16,602 --> 01:20:18,944
- They're so weird.
- Yeah.

1641
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:23,657
Dude, another good birthday.
- Yeah.

1642
01:20:23,692 --> 01:20:26,041
Yeah.

1643
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:28,001
So, what are you gonna do now?

1644
01:20:28,036 --> 01:20:31,171
God, I don't know. You know, I
can do whatever the fuck I want.

1645
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:35,002
You know, for once in my life, I don't
have to do what other people tell me.

1646
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:38,839
I'm just gonna travel
and write music again and...

1647
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:41,717
Fuck it. You know,
I'm just gonna live my life.

1648
01:20:42,676 --> 01:20:43,552
Yeah.

1649
01:20:45,429 --> 01:20:46,979
I'm glad you guys came.

1650
01:20:47,014 --> 01:20:49,016
Seriously, thanks for
being such good friends.

1651
01:20:49,051 --> 01:20:50,559
Yeah, dude.

1652
01:20:51,518 --> 01:20:53,020
Me and Casey will always
be there for you.

1653
01:20:53,055 --> 01:20:55,904
- I gotta go.
- What?

1654
01:20:55,939 --> 01:21:00,110
- Sorry, just... I'll call you.
- Yeah, way to ruin the moment, dick!

1655
01:21:00,145 --> 01:21:04,656
Love you guys! Good job standing
up to your dad, JeffChang!

1656
01:21:04,691 --> 01:21:07,291

All right, guys, but seriously,
tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.,

1676
01:22:55,517 --> 01:22:57,311
I have my big admissions
interview at Northern.

1677
01:22:57,346 --> 01:22:59,069
So don't let me get too stupid.

1678
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:00,856
I'm so psyched you're
going back to college, dude.

1679
01:23:00,891 --> 01:23:02,156
- Yeah.
- But seriously,

1680
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:05,527
don't let me get too messed up.
It's really important to me.

1681
01:23:05,562 --> 01:23:07,202
- Of course, man.
- OK.

1682
01:23:07,237 --> 01:23:08,572
- We'll take care of you, dude.
- Yeah.

1683
01:23:08,607 --> 01:23:10,205
- OK.
- Yeah.

1684
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,326

Ooh! I am so sorry that I'm
late, this is not like me.

1688
01:23:32,798 --> 01:23:34,271
This is actually
very unprofessional.

1689
01:23:34,306 --> 01:23:36,690
You would not believe
what happened to me last night.

1690
01:23:36,725 --> 01:23:40,395
I've been taking my academics really
serious lately so this is a shock to me.

1691
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:43,645

university, I want you to know that.
