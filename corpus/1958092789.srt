1
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,708
Avast, you hornswoggler.

2
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:08,375
Avast yourself.
I'll run you through.

3
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,375
I'll tear you limb from limb.

4
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,458
Hey.

5
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,750
Your time is running out, Peter Pan.

6
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,125
Peter Pan
doesn't care about time.

7
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,208
Watch out for the crocodile.

8
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,708
You watch out for the crocodile.

9
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:39,417
And, Wendy, please don't wait
to the last minute to pack.

10
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
I won't, Mother.

11
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,667
- The train is at 8 o'clock sharp tomorrow.
- Mother, I heard you.

12
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,792
I'll be ready.

13
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,750
Out of the way, Mother.
Where's that treasure?

14
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,000
Where is it? Aha!

15
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,583
No, give it back!

16
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:53,958
John, give it back.

17
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:57,125
I've got it!

18
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,375
I've got the treasure.

19
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,934
I've got the treasure.

20
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:03,958
I've got the treasure.

21
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:11,042
Got you.

22
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:14,917
Where is it?

23
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,460
Captain Hook,
I'm getting a little tired.

24
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,750
Maybe we can take a break?

25
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,042
Are you forfeiting?
Are you giving up?

26
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:47,125
I've got you cornered, Peter.
Your Lost Boys are nowhere to be seen.

27
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,083
No one will save you now!

28
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:55,333
You're not forgetting about me, are you?
Michael, give me your treasure.

29
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,000
Now leave Hook to me.

30
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,458
Make way, Captain, lest I run you through!

31
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,458
Go, Wendy!

32
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,143
Come on, Wendy.

33
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:10,292
Go, Wendy.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,250
Don't hurt him!

35
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:16,375
- You giving up, Captain?
- No.

36
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,333
No, you're just...

37
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,875
What was that?

38
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,875
Not again.

39
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,958
Who's responsible for this?

40
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,333
- Wendy?
- John, you tattletale!

41
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:42,500
- I didn't say anything.
- It wasn't my fault!

42
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,292
- It was their silly game!
- Now, now.

43
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,708
- And they started it, it wasn't me!
- Enough!

44
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:47,792
Sword.

45
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,875
Sword, hats.

46
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,083
Nana.

47
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,333
Father, can't she just stay
for a little while?

48
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:00,417
No, she cannot.

49
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:05,292
Honestly, Wendy, is this how you want
to spend your last night at home?

50
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,875
- It was just a bit of fun.
- Exactly.

51
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:13,208
You are too old for this
to be the type of fun that you are having.

52
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,000
Nana. Come on.

53
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:25,125
Wendy, why did you say that?

54
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,500
Why did you say it was our fault?

55
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:31,000
You're a pirate, aren't you?
It's every man for himself.

56
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,417
They suit you, Wendy.

57
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,792
You should take them with you.

58
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,583
I'd rather not.

59
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,958
Come along, boys, into bed.

60
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,583
- It wasn't my fault.
- I know, John.

61
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,417
Mother, why does Captain Hook
hate Peter Pan?

62
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,583
That's a very good question,
one that we will have to ponder,

63
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,667
tomorrow.

64
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,083
Wendy.

65
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:30,667
May I come in?

66
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,000
You really must set a better example
for your brothers.

67
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,708
They look up to you so much.

68
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,500
That's what they have you for.

69
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,750
They need me to be their mother

70
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,708
and your father to be their father.

71
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:49,625
But they need you to be their big sister.

72
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,375
You give them something
that neither of us can.

73
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:57,500
They will follow your lead,
so you must be a good leader.

74
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,958
How am I supposed to do that
if I'm off at boarding school, Mother?

75
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,333
By going with your head held high

76
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,167
to start with.

77
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:13,125
If a young lady is lucky enough,
at a certain age, she goes off to school.

78
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:16,042
To get ready for the life ahead of her.

79
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,292
What if I don't want that life?

80
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,958
It's what I did when I was your age.

81
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:23,042
What if I don't want your life?

82
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,833
What is it that you're afraid of, my love?

83
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,958
I want things to stay the way they are.

84
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,500
The way they are?

85
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:47,542
Wendy, look, you scarcely fit in your bed.

86
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,083
You're growing up.

87
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,542
Perhaps, I don't want to grow up.

88
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,542
You can't stop time, Wendy.

89
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,917
It'll march on whether you like it or not.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,625
Just imagine all the things
you would miss out on,

91
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,417
if you didn't see where it took you.

92
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:13,458
And all the things the world would miss

93
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,750
if you weren't there to do them.

94
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:27,458
<i>It's time to drift away, my loves</i>

95
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:34,792
<i>And dream of cooing turtle doves</i>

96
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:41,542
<i>For when I turn to switch the light</i>

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,625
<i>I know you'll grow up overnight</i>

98
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:56,167
<i>Fly off into the cloudless skies</i>

99
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:03,500
<i>Where twinkling stars will fill your eyes</i>

100
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:11,583
<i>I'll miss you dearly
My brave little ones</i>

101
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:20,833
<i>All grown up now in the morning sun</i>

102
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,250
Gotcha!

103
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,125
I can't... What was happening?

104
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,958
Was I dreaming?

105
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,708
You were flying.

106
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,250
How?

107
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,250
A little bug did it.

108
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,583
I don't think that's a bug.

109
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:17,917
Well, it's a... It's a...

110
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,292
She is a fairy.

111
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,042
And if I know one thing about fairies,

112
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,125
it's they don't take kindly
to being called bugs.

113
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,750
- Are you...
- Peter Pan?

114
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,833
Were you expecting someone else?

115
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:35,417
We weren't expecting anyone at all.

116
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,083
They always act so surprised.

117
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:38,833
I always envisioned you as being...

118
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:40,708
- Taller?
- No, smaller actually.

119
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,917
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
that's not what I meant.

120
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,417
I'm... Well... I... How are you real?

121
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:53,750
I thought you were just a bedtime story.

122
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,833
Why can't I be both?

123
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,542
I like hearing stories about myself.

124
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,833
And your mother's very good
at telling them.

125
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,125
Now, let's see here.

126
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,708
Excuse me, you can't just
go through all our stuff.

127
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:06,000
Where are you hiding?

128
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,750
Oh please, be careful.

129
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,333
This is very delicate.

130
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,000
What are you doing here?

131
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,208
One, we've to get you out of here.

132
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:17,292
And, two...

133
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,083
My shadow.

134
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,708
Your shadow?

135
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,750
It's trying to get away,
and I've only got one.

136
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:30,500
You're making this harder
than it has to be.

137
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:32,207
Oh.

138
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:39,958
There you are.

139
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,875
Oh.

140
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:53,042
Got it.

141
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
Lights out, shadow.

142
00:11:58,292 --> 00:11:59,875
Get it, Peter, get it.

143
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,042
Oh, almost got it!

144
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,292
There it is.

145
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,208
Your hat! I've got your hat!

146
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,125
Go, go, go!

147
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,375
Ha! Got you!

148
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,458
When will you learn you can't get
anywhere without me, old friend.

149
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,083
No, that time doesn't count.

150
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,533
- Hold still.
- Maybe I could help you with that.

151
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,875
Here. Let me see.

152
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,583
It's okay, Tink. Wendy wouldn't hurt me.

153
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,208
- Can't she speak?
- Of course, she can.

154
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:53,167
You just haven't learnt to hear her right.

155
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,167
Well, you're very small, Tinker Bell.

156
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,667
- What's she saying?
- She says "All fairies are small."

157
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,042
- "That's what makes them fairies."
- Oh.

158
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,250
How'd you know my name, Peter Pan?

159
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,708
I heard your mother call you.

160
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:17,167
- "Wendy, time to wake up," she says.
- Time to wake up.

161
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,417
- "Wendy, time for school."
- Wendy, time for school.

162
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,125
<i>- "Wendy, bedtime."</i>
- Wendy, bedtime.

163
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,417
But you never want to go.

164
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:26,417
You've been watching me?

165
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,250
- Sometimes.
- Why?

166
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,208
Because I've been waiting
for you to say it.

167
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:33,417
- Say what?
- Same thing I said, once upon a time.

168
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,792
I don't want to grow... Ow!

169
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,875
- Ow! Ow!
- I was only...

170
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,000
You stabbed me.
You stabbed me in the heart.

171
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,625
Your heart is in your foot?

172
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:42,417
Isn't yours?

173
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,875
When Mr. Bear gets hurt,
Mama gives him a kiss to make it better.

174
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,750
What's a kiss?

175
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,292
You don't know what a kiss is?

176
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,542
No, but I think I need one.

177
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,458
Well, I...

178
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:57,542
No.

179
00:13:58,417 --> 00:13:59,417
Um...

180
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:06,750
This is a kiss.

181
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:16,125
I like it. I like it very much.

182
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:17,792
Now, do you feel better?

183
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,042
Yes. Good as new.

184
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,250
What's she saying?

185
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:25,292
- That it's high time we go.
- Go where?

186
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:29,208
To one place in the entire universe
where you can really be yourself.

187
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:33,333
Where there are no rules, no schools,
no bedtimes, no mothers and fathers,

188
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:35,208
- and most of all...
- No growing up.

189
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,917
That most of all.

190
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,083
Oh, you are you talking about Never land?

191
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,542
Surely, we couldn't there though?

192
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,375
- Of course, you could.
- But how do you get there?

193
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,458
That's... the fun part.

194
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,083
This suddenly seems like a terrible idea.

195
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,917
I've always dreamed of flying.

196
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,042
It's the easiest thing in the world.

197
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,250
All you have to do, is fill your head
with happy thoughts.

198
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,333
That's it?

199
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,792
Oh, right. And a little pixie dust.

200
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,708
What is it?

201
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:24,417
What are you saying?

202
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,917
You want me to close my eyes?

203
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,583
All right.

204
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,851
What are you thinking of?

205
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,000
Of when I was little.

206
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,208
When I was happy.

207
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,125
About how things used to be.

208
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,417
Now, open your eyes.

209
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,125
Whoa.

210
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,167
- No, no. I'm not ready yet.
- I still...

211
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,559
- Are you certain this is safe?
- Of course it is.

212
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,917
I haven't fallen yet.

213
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:20,542
I can fly?

214
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,583
I think I'm gonna be sick.

215
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:28,167
I can fly!

216
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,417
Goodbye, Nana!

217
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,667
Yay!

218
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,750
I'm flying!

219
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,500
Yay!

220
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,333
There it is!

221
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,083
Second star to the right
and straight on 'til morning.

222
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,417
Look!

223
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,583
I see it!

224
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,375
- Is that...
- Never land!

225
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,458
Wait for us, Wendy!

226
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,542
Is this everything
you've dreamed of?

227
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,305
I could never have dreamed of this!

228
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,250
Come on, there's more!

229
00:19:58,042 --> 00:20:00,125
Oh. Oh, no!

230
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,333
Oh, no!

231
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,750
He's back!

232
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,667
Hey!

233
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,167
Get your eyes to the sky!
The boy! He's back!

234
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,875
Yes, what?

235
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:35,250
Uh, it's the boy, Captain.
It's Peter Pa...

236
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,792
Never...

237
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
say...

238
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,292
his name.

239
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,042
Sorry, Captain.

240
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,375
Mr. Smee.

241
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Smee,

242
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,875
make a note. My cabin needs a new door.

243
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,167
A new door. Yes. Uh, right.

244
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:13,417
Might I say, Captain, uh,
that will be your third door this month.

245
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,833
And it won't be the last.

246
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,125
Where's my telescope?

247
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,375
Telescope! Smee.

248
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,625
Telescope at hand, Captain.

249
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,833
Speak not to me of hands, Smee.

250
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,083
Oh, I see your point. Uh...

251
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,913
- Where is he, then?
- Over there, Captain.

252
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,458
There you are.

253
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,083
Footloose and flying free.

254
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,125
But not for long.

255
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,333
What'd you have us do, Captain?

256
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:55,125
Why, let's invite him down
for a spot of tea.

257
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,958
Tea. Excellent idea.

258
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:00,667
Hear that boys? Put the kettle on.

259
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,250
It's tea time!

260
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:19,792
There. Look.

261
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah.

262
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:27,667
What was that?

263
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,250
Pirates. Come on.

264
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,458
Come on, Michael!

265
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:48,042
It's Hook!

266
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,667
Captain Hook?

267
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,417
Who else would try to kill me
this early in the morning?

268
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,875
Fire!

269
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:04,958
Follow me.

270
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:15,042
Now, listen close.

271
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,208
I'll lead the charge,
you three take up the rear

272
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:18,750
and we'll storm them, fore to aft.

273
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:20,417
They'll never see us coming.

274
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Move!

275
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:26,250
Remember, all pirates are fair game,
but leave Hook...

276
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,125
to me.

277
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,083
Did I hit him?

278
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,250
Well, you hit someone, Captain.

279
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,250
Oh, no.

280
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:19,208
John?

281
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,000
Michael?

282
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:26,708
John?

283
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:28,292
Michael?

284
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,583
Tinker Bell? Can you hear me?

285
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:35,917
Peter!

286
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,333
Anyone?

287
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,750
Look!

288
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,417
She has his hat!

289
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,875
What have you done with Peter?

290
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:06,125
I haven't done anything with Peter.

291
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,542
Where did you all...

292
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:11,917
Not another move!

293
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:21,167
Pardon?

294
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,417
Are you the Wendy?

295
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:27,250
Well, I'm a Wendy.

296
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,917
The Wendy Peter went to find?

297
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The Wendy who knows the bedtime stories?

298
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:33,667
'Cause if you don't know stories
then you're an imposter.

299
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,958
And you know what we do with imposters.

300
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:40,208
Stop doing that!

301
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,375
Are you...

302
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,417
Are you Tiger Lily?

303
00:25:58,542 --> 00:25:59,667
Which means you must be...

304
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,583
- Lost Boys.
- Every last one of us.

305
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:05,125
- But you're not all boys.
- So?

306
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,667
Well, I guess it doesn't really matter.

307
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,708
What matters is,
what you've done with Peter.

308
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,792
Give me that.

309
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,042
I haven't done anything with him.

310
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:16,417
He came and collected me and my brothers.

311
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Brothers?

312
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:19,583
Peter didn't say anything about brothers!

313
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:21,707
That's what I've been trying
to tell you all.

314
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,417
We were flying, and then,
we were attacked.

315
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,583
- Attacked?
- Yes.

316
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,125
- By pirates!
- I knew it.

317
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,875
- I knew it was a bad day to fly.
- No, you didn't.

318
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:32,750
- Bellweather, telescope.
- At all? I didn't say it at all?

319
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,633
- I didn't say it?
- You did not say it.

320
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:39,875
I said it when Peter asked us
to look for... whoever this is... I win.

321
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:42,000
You never said it. No.

322
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:45,000
These brothers of yours,
what do they look like?

323
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:51,208
Well, John's this tall
and Michael's this tall

324
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,542
and John, he has a hat. He has a top hat.

325
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,667
- Ooh, a hat!
- Yes, but I don't know if he's wearing it.

326
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,583
So, he might be this tall. And...

327
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,375
Does one of them have a bear?

328
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:05,125
Mr. Bear, yes, that's Michael.

329
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,542
There's definitely pirates, all right.

330
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,292
Well, I don't see anything.

331
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:20,917
- I don't trust...
- She's too grown up, isn't she?

332
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,250
- Yep, too old.
- Isn't she?

333
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,417
You're just looking the wrong way.

334
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:47,583
Oh, I see it! There's John
and Michael and a pirate ship!

335
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,292
And pirates.

336
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:52,958
Oh, dear!

337
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,542
Come along, lads.

338
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:03,000
Don't fancy yourselves the first
half-pints to be found a floating.

339
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,083
Well, I rescued the Captain from the sea

340
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,083
when he was scarcely taller
than yourselves.

341
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:09,083
Of course he weren't captain then.

342
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:12,042
He didn't have a hook.
He was just a little lost child,

343
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,375
desperate to make it back
to these fine shores

344
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,250
before he got too old to enjoy them.

345
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,042
All right, make some rooms for our guests.
Come on, come on.

346
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,333
Ooh, a fresh catch from the sea.

347
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:26,167
Hey. That's a fine bear you got there.
Did you kill that yourself?

348
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,375
Don't you touch Mr. Bear!

349
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,208
Ooh!

350
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,292
Mr. Bear.

351
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:33,750
Leave him alone!

352
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:47,750
What do you have for me, Mr. Smee?

353
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,083
Good tidings, I hope.

354
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:51,792
No, not today,

355
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:56,583
but... but we fished these little fellas
out of the drink.

356
00:28:56,667 --> 00:29:02,500
One of them is in possession of a small,
but possibly dangerous, bear.

357
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,667
And all three of them may be compatriots
of you-know-who.

358
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:24,167
Shh.

359
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,750
What's that?

360
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,708
Listen.

361
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:35,333
Do you hear what I hear?

362
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,208
- I don't think so.
- Listen!

363
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,583
Listen.

364
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,458
There it is again.

365
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,333
Teeny.

366
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,125
Tiny.

367
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,333
Oh, that's it.

368
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,042
Mr. Smee.

369
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,250
Yes, Captain?

370
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:26,125
What are the rules on my ship?

371
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:29,792
As they be tattooed on me heart.

372
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:34,208
One, each pirate upon first embarking
shall be entitled...

373
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:36,625
Start at 37.

374
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:39,542
Yes, quite right. Rule 37,

375
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:43,125
no one shall say the boy's name.

376
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,958
Rule 38, no whistling.

377
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:47,667
Rule 39...

378
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:55,042
No...

379
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:56,833
clocks.

380
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,125
That's it.

381
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,250
Now,

382
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:03,208
tell me.

383
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,583
How did you come to Never land?

384
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:10,125
- We came with Pe...
- Please don't break the rules!

385
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,208
Do not say his name.

386
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:15,417
We don't care about your rules.
We came with Peter Pan.

387
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,875
And he's gonna rescue us.

388
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:20,500
He said his name.

389
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,958
Dibs on the bear after he executes them.

390
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,542
He's going to rescue you?

391
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,208
Well... Probably.

392
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,792
Hopefully.

393
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:39,458
Hope.

394
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,250
Most days, I hate that word.

395
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,458
But on this occasion...

396
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:50,583
I wonder.

397
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,083
Mr. Smee.

398
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yes, Cap?

399
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,458
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

400
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:02,000
- The plank.
- He's gonna make them walk the plank.

401
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:04,792
- That a cup of tea'd be nice right now.
- No.

402
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:10,625
Rouse yourselves, lads.

403
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:13,833
Set a course

404
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:15,750
for Skull Rock.

405
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,208
<i>Heave ho, Heave ho</i>

406
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:24,875
<i>- Heave ho
- Dark and quiet are the devils in the deep</i>

407
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,208
<i>So slow and silent
So you're swallowed in your sleep</i>

408
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:29,500
<i>With a tail and a tooth
And I'm telling you the truth</i>

409
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:32,042
<i>You'll be boiling in the belly
Of a behemoth</i>

410
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:34,583
They're headed to Skull Rock.

411
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,375
Just as I feared.

412
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,167
Wonder why they call it...

413
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,125
Oh, my...

414
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:48,375
There's only one reason
pirates go to Skull Rock.

415
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:50,500
An execution is nigh.

416
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,125
An execution?

417
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:54,958
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's go rescue them.

418
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,184
<i>Dark and quiet are the devils in the deep</i>

419
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,542
<i>So slow and silent
So you're swallowed in your sleep</i>

420
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,917
<i>With a tail and a tooth
And I'm telling you the truth</i>

421
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,833
<i>You'll be boiling in the belly
Of a behemoth</i>

422
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,125
<i>your sights abroad</i>

423
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,250
<i>And suddenly the suction of a cephalopod</i>

424
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,750
<i>Has you thinking twice take my advice</i>

425
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:14,500
<i>A mutineer should also fear a firing squad</i>

426
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:17,875
<i>Ho!</i>

427
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,875
<i>Ho!</i>

428
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,333
You can get anywhere
in Never land down here.

429
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,625
If you know the way.

430
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:37,542
It's particularly useful
when you wanna hide from pirates.

431
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,083
Which is my preference.

432
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:41,000
Why is Captain Hook so hateful?

433
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,625
- Because he grew up.
- And grew up wrong.

434
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:46,667
- But he's still the best swordsman.
- Which also makes him...

435
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,042
- The worst.
- Which is why we leave him to Peter.

436
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:52,292
Who he hates
because Peter cut off his hand.

437
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,750
Fed it to the crocodile.
Well, along with his watch.

438
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,917
- You know about the crocodile?
- That's how the story goes.

439
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,708
Wait, you mean I'm in a story?

440
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,042
Shh!

441
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,750
Don't look at that.

442
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:24,125
Oh, no.

443
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,167
Poor Robert.

444
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,542
Oh, look, there they are.

445
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,667
For goodness sakes, Michael can't swim.

446
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,250
Captain.

447
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Oops.

448
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,375
Tide's rising.

449
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:54,042
Poor little cast aways.

450
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:56,292
Tell me.

451
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,625
What will you hold on to?

452
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:01,875
Your hope?

453
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,125
Or your breath?

454
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,208
You can't kill us.

455
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:09,042
- We've done nothing wrong.
- Oh, yes you have.

456
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,292
You're doing it right now.

457
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:14,458
I've found you guilty of being a child,

458
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:18,042
and we can't have children...

459
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:19,958
in Never land.

460
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:24,125
Rule 44, no children in Never land.

461
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,583
<i>No children in Never land</i>

462
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,875
<i>No children in Never land</i>

463
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:31,333
<i>No children in Never land</i>

464
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:33,792
<i>No children in Never land</i>

465
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,333
<i>No children in Never land</i>

466
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:38,708
<i>No children in Never land</i>

467
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:41,542
<i>No children in Never land</i>

468
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:44,542
<i>No children in Never land</i>

469
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:47,083
<i>No one but children in Never land</i>

470
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:49,625
<i>No one but children in Never land</i>

471
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,083
<i>No one but children in Never land</i>

472
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:55,250
<i>No one but children in Never land</i>

473
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,583
<i>No one but children in Never land</i>

474
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:00,167
<i>No one but children in Never land</i>

475
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,500
Quiet!

476
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:04,250
<i>In Never land</i>

477
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:08,583
You.

478
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,208
What is your name?

479
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:14,375
How long have you served on my ship?

480
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,750
Hey. Answer your captain.

481
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Fake beard.

482
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,542
I've got to say,
it's not half bad being a pirate.

483
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,667
Pan!

484
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,583
It's far better being me.

485
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,417
Mr. Bear!

486
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, he's just showing off.

487
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,292
Oh, he's not showing off yet.

488
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,000
Now he's showing off.

489
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,458
Captain Hook.

490
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:30,125
You're looking a little worse for wear,
old man.

491
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,958
You sure you won't be happier
back in your sick-bed?

492
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:35,417
Not today, boy.

493
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:39,292
I woke this morning
with a tune in my heart.

494
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:43,667
Do you know what the refrain was?

495
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:47,625
<i>Yo ho, yo hey</i>

496
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:50,250
Oh, brother. Hook's singing again.

497
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,833
<i>Peter Pan shall perish today</i>

498
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:57,042
Dark and sinister man.
Prepare to meet thy doom.

499
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,333
Proud and insolent youth.

500
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:01,833
Have at me!

501
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:17,625
Come with me.

502
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:19,125
Trust me.

503
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:22,375
Oh, good morning, Mr. Smee.

504
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,208
Oh, the fairy.

505
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,667
John. Michael.

506
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,583
- Wendy!
- Shh.

507
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,667
Look what they did to Mr. Bear.

508
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,375
Oh, my...

509
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:16,292
Yes! Get his hat!

510
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,333
Bad form!

511
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:30,333
Oh, Tinker Bell. Thank goodness.

512
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,083
Can you help us?

513
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,708
Yes!

514
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,375
Oh, Wendy.

515
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:41,292
You're still alive!

516
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,958
Yes, I am and so are you.

517
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:45,708
I thought that maybe you had...

518
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:46,833
Died? Perished?

519
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,226
- Been blown to bits?
- Yes!

520
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,000
Not a chance. I'm quite good
at not getting kill...

521
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,625
Got you!

522
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:01,792
I beat you.

523
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:06,667
Don't even think about helping, Tink.

524
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:10,833
Wretched fairy.

525
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:13,667
Very bad form, Captain Hook.

526
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,292
All my bad form, I learnt from you.

527
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,042
Don't flatter yourself.

528
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,542
You've always been rotten.

529
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:25,125
A stinking, rotten codfish.

530
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,375
You've stabbed me in my heart
with your words.

531
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,083
For the last time.

532
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:40,333
Now, I will repay in kind with my sword.

533
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:45,875
Strike then, if you've got the courage.

534
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:48,292
And strike true.

535
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:51,583
For to die

536
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:54,875
- will be an awfully big adventure.
- An awfully big adventure.

537
00:40:58,667 --> 00:40:59,875
Hey, stop!

538
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:05,042
Who are you?

539
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:10,833
I've never seen you here before!

540
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,375
- Well, you see, I'm...
- She's a Wendy.

541
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,875
- A Wendy!
- A Wendy!

542
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,167
A Wendy?

543
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:24,167
- What's a Wendy?
- I'm a Wendy.

544
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,333
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

545
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:32,625
And I am from London, England
where gentlemen do not harm children!

546
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,042
Well.

547
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:42,083
- I am...
- Captain Hook. I know.

548
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,583
- And we are in...
- Never land.

549
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:49,833
And this child...

550
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:51,875
is no child.

551
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:56,792
Nor I a gentle man.

552
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,708
So, say your goodbyes, Wendy.

553
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:06,500
For you shan't be seeing him
in this world again.

554
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:13,042
No.

555
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:14,833
Oh, God.

556
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:24,833
That is one big crocodile.

557
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:31,625
Look!

558
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,000
Avast, great beast!

559
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,750
No! No! No!

560
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:42,958
Oh, my!

561
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,917
Run! Run!

562
00:42:58,417 --> 00:42:59,958
Tally ho!

563
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,208
Come on. Let's go.

564
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,333
Well, that was fun.

565
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,625
It was an adventure.
Isn't that what you wanted?

566
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:11,000
Yes, but I didn't think that meant
being shot out of the sky by pirates.

567
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:12,083
Or drowned.

568
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:13,917
Or dismembered.

569
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:20,125
Tinker Bell, I don't understand you.
What are you saying?

570
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,208
What she's saying is, I saved the day.

571
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,042
You sort of saved the day.

572
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:25,542
You saved part of the day.

573
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,333
And I did a pretty good job at it.

574
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:29,958
And it's not like you had

575
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,083
- any help at all.
- No, I didn't.

576
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:33,167
I'm Peter Pan.

577
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,292
I don't ever need help.

578
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:38,542
You have a magical fairy
that makes you fly.

579
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:42,958
A gaggle of children to do your bidding,
a princess who cleans up after you

580
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:44,792
while you're off gallivanting
with pirates.

581
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:48,917
Do you really think that
you could beat Captain Hook on your own?

582
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,833
- What's a gaggle?
- Hmm.

583
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:52,958
Of course, I could. I always beat him.

584
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:55,250
That's just how it works. Always has.

585
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,333
Always will.

586
00:44:56,917 --> 00:44:59,167
And what happens if it doesn't?

587
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,417
Yes, what happens then?

588
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:03,833
That won't ever happen.

589
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:05,917
- Will it, Peter?
- Of course not.

590
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:07,667
This is Never land.

591
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,500
Where nothing ever changes.

592
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,417
Least of all, me.

593
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,083
Right.

594
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:25,208
It's not true
what Peter says, you know?

595
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,417
Some things do change.

596
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,625
- We're not to talk.
- We're not to talk.

597
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:30,917
What? What aren't you
supposed to talk about?

598
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,250
Hook wasn't always Hook.

599
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:01,083
Come along, don't dilly-dally.

600
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:07,958
What is this place?

601
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:09,583
It's home.

602
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:11,083
Come on.

603
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:23,958
Aren't you coming?

604
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:25,042
No.

605
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,792
It's their home, not mine.

606
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:31,708
Not yours either, I don't think.

607
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,875
I don't know where my home is exactly...

608
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:40,833
Or where I want it to be.

609
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,750
You will.

610
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:47,917
The first time I rode out on my own,

611
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,975
my great great grandmother,

612
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,333
she came to me and said,

613
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,500
"Feel the ground beneath your feet,

614
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:04,375
"so that your eyes can find the stars.

615
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,292
"Hold the past in your heart,"

616
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:11,167
"but know that where you go from here,
it's up to you."

617
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:19,792
Sleep tight,

618
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:22,292
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

619
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:25,375
Then get home safe.

620
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:48,917
Hi, Wendy.

621
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:54,875
Well, how did you find this place?

622
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:58,542
Peter found it.
Just like he found all of us.

623
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:01,958
Just like he found me.

624
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:04,125
Exactly.

625
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:33,583
Wendy?

626
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:35,333
Can you tell us a bedtime story, now?

627
00:48:35,792 --> 00:48:38,000
- Yes! Bedtime stories!
- Yes! Bedtime stories!

628
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,250
We've been waiting forever.

629
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:43,917
Well, I could,

630
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:49,250
but I was thinking, perhaps,
Peter could tell us a story first.

631
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,208
- What about?
- I don't know.

632
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:54,333
Maybe how you came to Never land?

633
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:55,958
Or how you met Captain Hook.

634
00:48:58,042 --> 00:49:00,417
It's a very short story
and it goes like this...

635
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:03,750
I fought Captain Hook in a duel
and I cut off his hand.

636
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:05,458
Yes. Yes. Everyone knows that.

637
00:49:06,417 --> 00:49:07,667
How'd you two meet?

638
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,458
Why'd you start fighting
in the first place?

639
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:11,958
Because he's a pirate.

640
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,500
And I'm Peter Pan.

641
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:16,833
But surely, it can't be as simple as that.

642
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:17,917
Why not?

643
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:20,583
Because nothing ever is.

644
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:23,458
Where are you two from?

645
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,333
Where's his mother and father?

646
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:27,958
Where are yours?

647
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:30,208
Uh, that's a trick question.

648
00:49:31,042 --> 00:49:34,208
This is Never land
where there are no mothers and fathers.

649
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:35,500
Why aren't there?

650
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:37,500
I don't remember my mother.

651
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,125
Well, now you don't have to.

652
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,167
Wendy can be our mother.

653
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:42,833
Goodness, no.

654
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,708
I don't even know
if I want to be a mother.

655
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:47,875
But I still have one.

656
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:49,708
So do you,

657
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:51,417
and you,

658
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:53,458
and all of you.

659
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:56,625
Somewhere out there...

660
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:00,417
she misses you.

661
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:06,292
She loves you very much.

662
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:08,750
I wouldn't mind seeing my mother again.

663
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yes, you would.

664
00:50:11,417 --> 00:50:13,875
If you went back home,
it would be the end of all our fun.

665
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:14,958
All our adventures.

666
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:18,292
All you'd have left... is growing up.

667
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:25,083
It's never good when Peter
starts slamming doors.

668
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:27,500
I'm sorry I asked for a story, Wendy.

669
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,083
Oh, it's not your fault.

670
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:32,375
How about...

671
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:39,708
How about I sing you a lullaby instead?

672
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:41,125
What's a lullaby?

673
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:45,458
It's a song that my mother sings me
and my brothers sometimes.

674
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:48,208
I believe it goes like this...

675
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:57,958
<i>It's time to fall asleep, my friends</i>

676
00:50:58,792 --> 00:51:05,583
<i>And dream of fun that never ends</i>

677
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:11,833
<i>Like swift adventures up above</i>

678
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:17,667
<i>And roaring fires and mother's love</i>

679
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:24,625
<i>For when she turns in the moonlight</i>

680
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:31,625
<i>She knows you're up above the night</i>

681
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Do you hear that?

682
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,292
What is that?

683
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,875
Fruit bats.

684
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:45,292
They come in this time of year.

685
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:46,667
No. Listen...

686
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:50,667
I believe,

687
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:57,375
I've heard something like that before.

688
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:26,750
Dear, Tinker Bell,
I wish I could understand you.

689
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:32,375
I don't think that Peter can either.

690
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:34,458
He actually doesn't listen, does he?

691
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Well, it's his loss, not yours.

692
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,625
I'm sure you've
simply wonderful things to say.

693
00:53:13,292 --> 00:53:14,417
"James."

694
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:16,083
Who's James?

695
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:22,583
Oh.

696
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,125
Peter?

697
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,042
Oh, Peter, come on.

698
00:53:34,792 --> 00:53:36,083
Don't be like that.

699
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:44,167
- What's this?
- It's a kiss.

700
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:47,708
I made it for you, so we'd both have one.

701
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:50,208
I thought we'd be friends.

702
00:53:51,042 --> 00:53:52,875
Instead, we're just...

703
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:54,042
Fighting.

704
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,250
Just like you and Hook.

705
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,792
Hook was a friend of yours, wasn't he?

706
00:54:07,292 --> 00:54:08,500
He was my best friend.

707
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:12,792
And the very first Lost Boy.

708
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,500
And what happened?

709
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:21,042
Never land... just wasn't good enough
for him, I guess.

710
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:27,042
He sailed away one morning without a word

711
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:29,708
and left me all alone.

712
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:34,250
When he returned, he'd changed.

713
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:36,917
He was cruel.

714
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:39,167
Evil.

715
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:42,250
Was he though? Or had he just grown up?

716
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:43,458
What's the difference?

717
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,625
That's why you mustn't ever leave.

718
00:54:50,917 --> 00:54:53,083
Who knows what you'll become if you go.

719
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:54,625
What will I become if I stay?

720
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,792
Nothing. Just be you. Like me.

721
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,667
I really thought you'd be happy here.

722
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:05,208
Yes, I did too.

723
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:09,583
But Never land is not exactly
what I was expecting.

724
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:14,208
Peter, it's so much more real.

725
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:18,042
Of course it's real.
It's just a different real.

726
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:19,708
A better real.

727
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:23,583
- Peter...
- Goodnight, Wendy.

728
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:48,458
Mr. Bear.

729
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:07,083
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

730
00:56:11,042 --> 00:56:13,208
The little sing-song girl

731
00:56:14,542 --> 00:56:16,167
of London, England.

732
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:22,500
Your voice drew me back to my old home.

733
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:26,292
Thank you.

734
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:17,750
Got you!

735
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:27,208
Where are you?

736
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:38,875
How many times did we play hide-and-seek
in these ruins?

737
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,458
You were always the best at hiding.

738
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:49,750
Then again...

739
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,000
I was always the best...

740
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,125
at finding you!

741
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:02,583
Captain Hook?

742
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:05,125
Yes.

743
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:08,917
I don't think I like this adventure.

744
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,500
Peter!

745
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:39,125
Peter!

746
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:41,000
No!

747
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:47,625
What have you done?

748
00:58:51,292 --> 00:58:52,292
I've done it.

749
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:53,375
Peter!

750
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:56,667
I've killed Peter Pan.

751
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:42,250
I want a word...

752
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:44,250
with...

753
01:00:44,917 --> 01:00:45,917
you!

754
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:54,708
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Then listen.

755
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:21,167
What is that?

756
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,167
Yeah, it's simply...
That's just a lullaby.

757
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,583
Yes, but why...

758
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,250
does it remind me of something?

759
01:01:33,417 --> 01:01:35,250
- Open this!
- Yes.

760
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,917
Where are the keys? Keys. Keys. Keys.

761
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,667
Where does it come from? Tell me.

762
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,375
- I don't know.
- Tell me!

763
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:46,500
Why does it make me feel so...

764
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:48,708
I couldn't say.

765
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:50,875
It was just something my mother sings us.

766
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:51,958
Your who?

767
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:54,125
My mother.

768
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:03,708
Yes, of course.

769
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:20,417
I know you weren't always like this,
Captain Hook.

770
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,792
I know you and Peter were friends.

771
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,500
I've heard stories.

772
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:29,667
Have you?

773
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:31,542
You left Never land.

774
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:34,708
And when you returned, you were...

775
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:35,833
Evil.

776
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:39,708
Yes.

777
01:02:39,792 --> 01:02:40,833
Hmm.

778
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,000
There's truth to that.

779
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,500
But he left out the most important part.

780
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,083
I didn't just leave Never land.

781
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:02,667
Peter made you go.

782
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:04,417
There it is.

783
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:07,625
There's the sticking point.

784
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,792
My once and best friend banished me,

785
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:14,458
all because I missed my...

786
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:24,958
I... missed...

787
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:31,375
my...

788
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:47,292
Your mother?

789
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,375
Yes, my mother.

790
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:54,875
Who sang me that very song.

791
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,875
Is it so terrible a thing,

792
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,500
to miss a mother?

793
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:03,917
No, of course, it's not.

794
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,375
Tell that to your dearly departed friend,

795
01:04:07,417 --> 01:04:09,083
for he surely thought otherwise.

796
01:04:12,083 --> 01:04:14,750
And do you know, after all that,
I never did find her.

797
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:16,875
I never made it home.

798
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:20,792
I never saw my poor,
sweet mama, ever again.

799
01:04:23,417 --> 01:04:26,833
I left Never land and I was lost at sea.

800
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,625
I'd have surely perished,

801
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:35,542
were I not saved by this man here.

802
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:41,792
There I was, rescued
and raised by pirates.

803
01:04:43,417 --> 01:04:45,333
And by-and-by, I became their Captain

804
01:04:45,417 --> 01:04:50,208
and I, in-turn brought them
right back here.

805
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:51,833
But why?

806
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:55,875
Why come back at all,
if Peter hurt you so?

807
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,375
Because he was my friend.

808
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:00,708
I'd been happy here.

809
01:05:00,792 --> 01:05:03,000
- You could be happy again.
- No.

810
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:05,333
My time for joy is lost.

811
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:10,875
Everything I could have been
has been reduced to this.

812
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:14,125
This...

813
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,000
is what growing up looks like.

814
01:05:23,042 --> 01:05:24,042
No.

815
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:27,417
This is what it looks like,
when you grow up wrong.

816
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:34,833
You find me a child
who truly knows the difference

817
01:05:34,917 --> 01:05:36,625
between right and wrong.

818
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:40,708
And I'll show you a man

819
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:45,500
who can't remember
why it mattered in the first place.

820
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:52,000
Execute every last one of them.

821
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:01,167
- No! Wait! Stop!
- Come here!

822
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:02,833
Guilty!

823
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:05,917
- James, don't you think that...
- Never call me that!

824
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I am Captain Hook.

825
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:14,958
Please stop! Take me.

826
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,500
Take me instead!

827
01:06:19,792 --> 01:06:21,792
They're only children, let them live.

828
01:06:24,042 --> 01:06:26,250
When they grow up,
they'll be good pirates,

829
01:06:26,958 --> 01:06:28,167
especially those two.

830
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:30,042
Please take me.

831
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:35,458
Your largesse is admirable.

832
01:06:37,917 --> 01:06:39,917
Perhaps it'll lead to a bigger splash.

833
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:43,792
No! Wendy! No!

834
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,292
Wendy! No! Wendy!

835
01:06:48,292 --> 01:06:49,500
John, I'm sorry.

836
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,250
No, Wendy!

837
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:20,726
<i>Puhkitinin kguh weechitdaan.</i>

838
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,292
Where is everyone? Where's Tink?

839
01:07:23,042 --> 01:07:24,208
Where are my Lost Boys?

840
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,500
They were taken.

841
01:07:28,542 --> 01:07:29,583
By Hook?

842
01:07:54,792 --> 01:07:55,952
Let me help you.

843
01:08:23,792 --> 01:08:27,625
<i>A route unravels where those who travel</i>

844
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:32,708
<i>Don't return from the Earth</i>

845
01:08:32,792 --> 01:08:37,625
<i>So take a hop tiny, and bob on the briny</i>

846
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:42,917
<i>Seek the shore, forever more</i>

847
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,417
<i>Fair winds</i>

848
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:51,792
<i>And following seas</i>

849
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:57,542
<i>Elude alligator, confront the creator</i>

850
01:08:57,625 --> 01:09:03,292
<i>Thine eyes shall see, the mystery</i>

851
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:07,250
<i>Fair winds</i>

852
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:13,333
<i>And following seas</i>

853
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:18,125
<i>And as you sink deeper
and stare at the reaper</i>

854
01:09:18,208 --> 01:09:22,875
<i>Who waits on the tongues of leviathans</i>

855
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:27,500
<i>And there's a lot of 'em,
you won't touch the bottom</i>

856
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:32,708
<i>And as we suggested,
you're slowly digested</i>

857
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:36,292
<i>Fish food</i>

858
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:41,375
<i>And following sea</i>

859
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:47,042
Farewell then.

860
01:09:49,292 --> 01:09:53,208
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

861
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:59,333
<i>Into the water, no son or daughters</i>

862
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:04,833
<i>Escapes the drink, they'll certainly sink</i>

863
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:09,083
<i>Fair winds</i>

864
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:15,583
<i>And following seas</i>

865
01:10:15,667 --> 01:10:17,250
<i>Fair winds</i>

866
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:19,208
Think happy thoughts.

867
01:11:08,417 --> 01:11:09,417
Mr. Smee.

868
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,667
Mr. Smee.

869
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:16,667
Yes, yes, sir. Yes, sir.

870
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:21,042
- Did you hear a splash?
- Absolutely, Captain.

871
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:22,125
It was, uh...

872
01:11:24,542 --> 01:11:26,875
- Actually...
- I didn't hear one.

873
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:28,458
Nor I.

874
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:30,375
But I'm sure one's coming.

875
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,250
Well, she surely must have
hit the water by now.

876
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:41,417
Unless she fell very slowly.

877
01:11:44,542 --> 01:11:47,917
Did anyone hear a splash?

878
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,560
- Was there a splash?
- Mmm-mmm.

879
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:27,708
Why that looks like...

880
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:39,917
- Wendy!
- Wendy!

881
01:12:40,917 --> 01:12:42,250
You have the boy's magic.

882
01:12:43,167 --> 01:12:45,875
No. This magic belongs to no boy.

883
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:50,958
We still have you outnumbered, girl.

884
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:53,167
Hand over hook over fist.

885
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:58,708
My men would lay down their lives
for their captain.

886
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:00,542
Yes.

887
01:13:01,292 --> 01:13:04,208
But what's a captain without his ship?

888
01:13:29,042 --> 01:13:30,958
Smee!

889
01:13:32,917 --> 01:13:34,375
- Mr. Smee.
- Yes, Cap.

890
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:37,208
Get my ship back in the water.

891
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:42,458
- Hands on the wheel!
- Hand on the wheel!

892
01:13:42,542 --> 01:13:44,708
Drop the anchor! Make it fast!

893
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,208
Is that?

894
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:57,167
- I think it might be.
- It couldn't be!

895
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,250
But it definitely is.

896
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:12,250
- Peter!
- Peter!

897
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:13,708
- Peter!
- Pan!

898
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:32,667
Miss me?

899
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:35,667
More than you'll ever know.

900
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:40,917
Well, wake me up
if one of them kills the other.

901
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Again.

902
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:48,208
How did you do it, boy?

903
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,542
How did you survive?

904
01:14:53,792 --> 01:14:55,792
Faith, trust and pixie dust?

905
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:56,875
No.

906
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,833
No pixie dust this time.

907
01:14:58,917 --> 01:14:59,917
No magic.

908
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:01,833
No tricks.

909
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:04,875
Just a little help from my friends.

910
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:08,083
You dare to speak to me of friends

911
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:11,833
when all of yours now belong to me?

912
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:17,958
Proud...

913
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:21,083
and insolent youth,

914
01:15:24,167 --> 01:15:25,417
raise your sword.

915
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:28,500
Sad and sinister man,

916
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:32,917
one last time.

917
01:15:51,917 --> 01:15:53,625
Oh!

918
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,458
Get off!

919
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:13,542
Get the children!

920
01:16:14,542 --> 01:16:15,917
Get the pirates!

921
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,667
- I've got the bear!
- Hey!

922
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,000
The bear is mine!

923
01:16:24,833 --> 01:16:27,042
Give me back my bear!

924
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,167
Give it back!

925
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:40,125
Don't touch my brother!

926
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,917
Or his bear!

927
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:08,833
Uhh!

928
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:37,958
Just like old times.

929
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:41,583
All your times are old, Captain.

930
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:02,583
Upon him!

931
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:13,167
Michael, come on.

932
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:46,250
- Uhh!
- Almost there.

933
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:52,958
Oh. That was close.

934
01:18:53,042 --> 01:18:55,458
Kids, give me that wheel.

935
01:18:57,917 --> 01:18:58,917
Wendy!

936
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:01,208
Help!

937
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:03,958
The helm!

938
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:26,042
Right, John, Michael,
hang on to something.

939
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,792
Everyone, hang on!

940
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:34,333
Three!

941
01:19:35,292 --> 01:19:36,333
Two!

942
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
One.

943
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:30,875
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

944
01:20:43,292 --> 01:20:44,875
Hang on, Peter!

945
01:20:44,958 --> 01:20:46,042
Don't look down.

946
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,458
Peter, no! No, hang on!

947
01:20:48,042 --> 01:20:49,042
Don't let go.

948
01:20:49,542 --> 01:20:50,625
Peter!

949
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:18,208
Do you know, what really hurts

950
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,167
about getting old?

951
01:21:21,917 --> 01:21:25,333
It's not the creaking bones

952
01:21:27,417 --> 01:21:28,792
or the dashed dreams

953
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:33,292
or even the sense of death

954
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:35,833
drawing ever the nearer.

955
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:40,417
It's knowing your best friend
can stare you in the eyes

956
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,083
and not recognize you.

957
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:44,375
- You're the one who wanted to leave.
- I was a child!

958
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:48,458
Wait, stop!

959
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:09,625
Go ahead, boy.

960
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:11,542
Go ahead.

961
01:22:13,042 --> 01:22:16,542
But imagine a Never land
without the two of us.

962
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:19,667
Without our battles.

963
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:21,792
Our brawls.

964
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I know

965
01:22:26,667 --> 01:22:27,917
without you

966
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:33,292
the fire that fuels me will go out.

967
01:22:34,292 --> 01:22:35,292
Without me,

968
01:22:36,292 --> 01:22:38,292
you'd have no choice but to...

969
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,375
- Be a real boy?
- No.

970
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:44,250
No. A real boy would have to grow.

971
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:45,625
A real boy...

972
01:22:45,708 --> 01:22:46,833
Would apologize.

973
01:22:46,917 --> 01:22:48,792
Apologize?

974
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:52,583
For what?

975
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:54,333
For hurting you.

976
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:57,792
For being a rotten friend.

977
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:08,667
I'm sorry I did what I did, Captain Hook.

978
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:12,208
I'm sorry I hurt you, James.

979
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:16,125
You don't get to do that.

980
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,500
No, that's not how this works.

981
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:23,458
I want you to fight.

982
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:26,750
- I need you to fight.
- This isn't fun anymore.

983
01:23:26,833 --> 01:23:29,417
It's not supposed to be fun!

984
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,125
Oh, Captain.

985
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:34,250
Grow up.

986
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:42,583
Got you.

987
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:43,875
Don't worry, James.

988
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:45,000
Oh.

989
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:46,375
Just think happy thoughts.

990
01:23:55,792 --> 01:23:56,792
Peter.

991
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:01,542
I haven't got any.

992
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:45,250
What's wrong, Peter?

993
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:48,792
He was my friend.

994
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:52,125
We're your friends, too, Peter.

995
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:53,875
We're always on your side, Peter.

996
01:24:54,667 --> 01:24:55,958
I know.

997
01:24:57,417 --> 01:24:59,417
And I'm glad you are, but...

998
01:25:03,292 --> 01:25:04,292
Peter,

999
01:25:07,542 --> 01:25:10,208
don't you think it's time
we get these Lost Boys home?

1000
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:20,625
Where to, Peter?

1001
01:25:20,708 --> 01:25:23,375
Second star to the right,
straight on till morning.

1002
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Wait, wouldn't it be left?

1003
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,375
- What?
- The star.

1004
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:31,583
- If we're going in the opposite direction.
- Oh, yes! That's right.

1005
01:25:31,667 --> 01:25:34,792
Yes. Yes, it's right.
Wait, we're going left, right?

1006
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:40,042
No, no, no. People!
It has always been right, Twins?

1007
01:26:30,542 --> 01:26:31,542
Goodness, Wendy.

1008
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:33,625
You gave me a fright.

1009
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:36,333
Mother? I...

1010
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:39,375
What is it?

1011
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:40,875
I'm sorry.

1012
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:46,250
Oh, there, there. Oh, sweet girl.

1013
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:48,417
It's quite all right.

1014
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,208
And I think I'm ready.

1015
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:51,500
Ready for what?

1016
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:53,403
I'm ready to grow...

1017
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,083
Did you hear something?

1018
01:26:57,167 --> 01:26:58,542
No, I didn't hear anything.

1019
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:00,875
- What on Earth?
- I think it was just a...

1020
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:03,057
- What's that commotion?
- Nothing.

1021
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:05,500
- Father, I heard something, too.
- Intruders.

1022
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:07,083
There are no intruders.

1023
01:27:07,167 --> 01:27:10,000
No, Father, Mother,
I have something to explain to you.

1024
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:11,917
- Stay out here.
- No, don't go in.

1025
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Oh, no, be careful with that! No!

1026
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:16,375
That was a present
from my Uncle John and Auntie Ang.

1027
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:18,458
Please, please, please, careful. Just...

1028
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,500
Who are all these children?

1029
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:30,208
Mother.

1030
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:38,208
Uh-uh...

1031
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:39,958
Where on Earth did you come from?

1032
01:27:40,042 --> 01:27:42,292
They came from Never land, Father.

1033
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:43,875
Never-where?

1034
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:56,542
Boy,

1035
01:27:58,083 --> 01:27:59,375
why are you crying?

1036
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:03,125
You know how you asked me
where I came from?

1037
01:28:04,917 --> 01:28:05,917
Yes.

1038
01:28:18,417 --> 01:28:20,833
- This was your home?
- It was, once.

1039
01:28:22,042 --> 01:28:23,625
My mother scolded me one night

1040
01:28:24,917 --> 01:28:26,208
and told me to grow up.

1041
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:30,333
Instead, I climbed out of the window,

1042
01:28:30,417 --> 01:28:31,833
leapt over the garden wall,

1043
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:34,583
and never looked back.

1044
01:28:35,792 --> 01:28:37,042
Except you did.

1045
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:42,625
That's why you kept coming back, isn't it?

1046
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,875
Because you miss your home.
And you miss...

1047
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:51,208
My mother.

1048
01:28:53,542 --> 01:28:54,792
But she's long gone now.

1049
01:28:56,333 --> 01:28:57,333
I'm just a story.

1050
01:28:58,292 --> 01:29:00,625
A story told to any child who'd listen.

1051
01:29:02,333 --> 01:29:04,500
It never had an ending, until now.

1052
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:09,583
Maybe I could still come back
to listen to it sometimes.

1053
01:29:12,667 --> 01:29:13,917
Or you could stay.

1054
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:15,750
Here?

1055
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:16,833
Yes.

1056
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:20,708
But you're going to leave.
Going to grow up.

1057
01:29:22,042 --> 01:29:23,083
You know, Peter.

1058
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:29,208
After all this, I think that to grow up...

1059
01:29:30,792 --> 01:29:34,250
Why, it might just be
the biggest adventure of all.

1060
01:29:36,292 --> 01:29:39,292
Just think of all the things
that could be right around the corner

1061
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:40,917
that you're missing out on.

1062
01:29:42,292 --> 01:29:47,125
Think of what the world is missing out on
with you not being there to do them.

1063
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:54,333
I don't think I'm ready.

1064
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:09,208
No, wait! Peter!

1065
01:30:12,708 --> 01:30:13,917
Don't go.

1066
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:21,500
What sort of magic is this?

1067
01:30:25,375 --> 01:30:26,583
Who's that boy?

1068
01:30:27,958 --> 01:30:29,792
Why, that's Peter Pan.

1069
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,500
Goodbye, Tink.

1070
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:37,333
You take care of Peter

1071
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:40,250
and please don't forget about me.

1072
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:43,208
I could never.

1073
01:30:46,125 --> 01:30:50,625
Wendy, thank you for hearing me.

1074
01:31:17,917 --> 01:31:18,917
Goodbye, Peter Pan.

1075
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:21,500
Goodbye, Peter Pan!

1076
01:32:33,417 --> 01:32:36,042
Did you see me, Cap?

1077
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:38,042
I'm still alive!

1078
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:39,917
- I didn't drown!
- Do you hear that?

1079
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
I'm floating!

1080
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:43,127
- Look at us, we're floating.
- Did you hear that?

1081
01:32:45,417 --> 01:32:46,417
The gulls?

1082
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,500
No!

1083
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,250
Crocodile?

1084
01:32:49,583 --> 01:32:50,583
No!

1085
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
What then?

1086
01:36:16,417 --> 01:36:22,625
<i>It's time to drift away, my loves</i>

1087
01:36:23,917 --> 01:36:30,875
<i>And dream of cooing turtle doves</i>

1088
01:36:31,167 --> 01:36:37,583
<i>For when I turn to switch the light</i>

1089
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:44,208
<i>I know you'll grow up overnight</i>

1090
01:36:46,042 --> 01:36:52,542
<i>Fly off into the cloudless skies</i>

1091
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:59,000
<i>Where twinkling stars will fill your eyes</i>

1092
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:04,292
<i>I'll miss you dearly</i>

1093
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:07,708
<i>My brave little ones</i>

1094
01:37:09,167 --> 01:37:16,083
<i>All grown up now in the morning sun</i>

1095
01:42:32,583 --> 01:42:34,625
<i>Heave ho</i>

1096
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:36,042
<i>Heave ho</i>

1097
01:42:36,167 --> 01:42:39,292
<i>Oh oh dark and quiet
are the devils in the deep</i>

1098
01:42:39,375 --> 01:42:41,667
<i>So slow and silent
So you're swallowed in your sleep</i>

1099
01:42:41,875 --> 01:42:44,125
<i>With a tail and a tooth
And I'm telling you the truth</i>

1100
01:42:44,208 --> 01:42:46,667
<i>You'll be boiling in the belly
Of a behemoth</i>

1101
01:42:46,917 --> 01:42:51,083
<i>Set sail with your sights abroad
And suddenly the suction of a cephalopod</i>

1102
01:42:51,208 --> 01:42:56,250
<i>Has you thinking twice take my advice
A mutineer should also fear a firing squad</i>
