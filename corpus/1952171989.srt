1
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:11,084
I thought all it needed
was the antenna.

2
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:14,122
Oh, no. No, lady,
that was just part of it.

3
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:16,843
Your oscillator variation
control is out.

4
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:21,884
Your audio analyser is burned and
that TV filter, well, that's all shredded.

5
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,728
It's gonna be a job. Big job.
Can I use your phone?

6
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,319
- Yes, of course. It's in the kitchen.
- Thanks.

7
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:37,042
Yeah, I put the antenna up.
Then I stripped down the set.

8
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:40,559
Ought to be worth about 40 bucks
to put it back together again.

9
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:54,561
How did you...?

10
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:56,602
Nail file.

11
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:54,241
They're putting a new train in service.
Leaves the city at 10 p.m.

12
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:56,559
- How about that?
- Don't tell me.

13
00:01:56,769 --> 00:01:59,567
That's a gentle way of saying
you have to work nights again.

14
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:03,728
Nothing like it. My evenings with you
are worth more than success or gold.

15
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:07,160
I should think Larry would want you
to save your strength.

16
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:10,048
He'd go out of business
if you got sick.

17
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,358
Samantha. I have to speak to you.

18
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:19,002
- What's the matter?
- I can't talk in front of him.

19
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:21,000
It's extremely urgent.

20
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:27,483
There is nothing you can't say to me
that you can't say in front of Darrin.

21
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,125
Well, get rid of him! And hurry up,
it's cold in here.

22
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:35,806
- What did you say, dear?
- I said it was sweet of you to say so.

23
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:38,087
Say what?

24
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:41,845
About my being more important
to you than gold.

25
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:45,638
- I like the thought.
- Sincerely said and honestly felt.

26
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:52,439
Samantha, I advise you
to listen to me.

27
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:53,962
What is it, Mother?

28
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,286
It's your father.
He's coming to see you.

29
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:00,483
- Father?
- What did you say, honey?

30
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:04,286
Nothing, darling.

31
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,601
That's funny.

32
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:10,245
You know, for a moment there I thought
you were talking to the dishes.

33
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,687
- Father's coming here?
- Yes, he is, tonight.

34
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,568
- And he knows you're married.
- Well, why so secretive?

35
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,885
Don't you realise what that means,
Samantha?

36
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:30,482
Of course. Oh, it'll be wonderful
seeing him again, and...

37
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:34,437
- Oh, no.
- Exactly.

38
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:38,119
- How are you going to explain Duncan?
- Darrin.

39
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:41,719
His name will be mud when
your father finds out he's human.

40
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,002
Maybe we'd just as well face it now.

41
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,121
I'm married, and there's
nothing he can do about it.

42
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,004
I shudder to think how many things
he can and probably will do about it.

43
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,286
What am I going to do?

44
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,844
- Your father?
- Yes.

45
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,569
He knows I'm married
and he's coming to see me tonight.

46
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:03,442
- When did you find out about this?
- Just now.

47
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:05,207
You were talking to the dishes.

48
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:08,520
I was talking to Mother.
She was trying to be unobtrusive.

49
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,367
Well, so your father's coming.
I'd like to meet him.

50
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:17,722
Father doesn't approve
of mixed marriages.

51
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:21,606
Well, neither does your mother,
but we worked that out. Sort of.

52
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:25,245
But Father's different.
He's got a terrible temper.

53
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,405
Honey, it's time he faced the fact.

54
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:30,328
You're married to me,
what can he do about it?

55
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:36,683
That's what he can do about it.

56
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:40,046
- You're kidding.
- No, Darrin, I'm not kidding.

57
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:44,037
I know my father. And I better
break the news to him alone.

58
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:48,238
Okay. Okay, but I'm coming home
right afterwards.

59
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:53,086
Darrin.

60
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:58,203
- Darrin, look these over, will you?
- Yeah, sure, Larry.

61
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:01,648
Get on it this afternoon,
we'll talk about it on the train.

62
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:05,880
I forgot to tell you, Larry.
I won't be going home tonight.

63
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:08,923
Oh, really?

64
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:13,048
Oh, really. Come on now, Larry. I'm
going to stay in town and have dinner.

65
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:16,042
- Trouble with Samantha?
- No, of course not.

66
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,443
Then why can't you go home?

67
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,925
My father-in-law
is coming over tonight...

68
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,920
...and Samantha hasn't told him
about me.

69
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:25,999
So what? He should be proud to have
the finest account executive...

70
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:27,841
...of McMann & Tate
for a son-in-law.

71
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:30,319
I'm afraid that wouldn't
impress him very much.

72
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:33,362
You're a fine human being, Darrin.
What more does he want?

73
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,408
If I told you, you'd never believe me.

74
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,278
I've got to be strong with Daddy.
After all, I'm not a child anymore.

75
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:43,327
Better be careful
or you won't be a bride anymore.

76
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:46,845
It's not fair. No one tells him
how to run his life.

77
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:51,082
Well, first of all, your father doesn't
run his life. He choreographs it.

78
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:53,046
Well, I don't care what he does.

79
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:56,997
When he gets here,
I'm going to stand right up to him.

80
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,400
Father.

81
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:13,440
Samantha, of course it is.

82
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:16,567
You've got to be my daughter.
You're positively gorgeous.

83
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:19,203
Well, what about yourself,
you look marvellous.

84
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:21,206
Yes, I suppose I do.

85
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:24,361
All right, Charles,
I shan't be needing you anymore.

86
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:26,562
Endora.

87
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,437
My love, nice to see you.

88
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:31,918
Oh, it's nice to see you too, Maurice.
How are you?

89
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:35,286
- In excellent health, thank you.
- You wouldn't have it any other way.

90
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:39,237
Of course not. Close your eyes
and reach in my pocket.

91
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:42,606
- You brought me something?
- Haven't I always?

92
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:49,159
Oh, Father. It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

93
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:51,803
It's the most beautiful thing
anyone has ever seen.

94
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:57,919
- Endora, a little something for you.
- Oh, thank you, Maurice.

95
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,161
Oh, how very thoughtful of you.

96
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,843
From that charming little shop
in Zürich, remember?

97
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,883
Oh, yes. Yes, I remember. Is that
disagreeable little clerk still there?

98
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:10,649
Oh, yes, he's there.
And still disagreeable.

99
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:16,725
- But very, very little.
- Oh, Maurice, you shouldn't have.

100
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,928
- It was nothing.
- Oh, not the gift, the clerk.

101
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,443
I haven't brought anything
for the man at the house...

102
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:28,238
...but then what can you create
for a man who has everything?

103
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:32,163
What's his name?
Darrell? Denny? Dinny?

104
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:33,808
- Donald.
- Darrin.

105
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,928
Darrin. Darrin, that's a good name.
It's got a good sound to it.

106
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,000
Darrin. Darrin what?

107
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,040
- Stephens.
- Stephens?

108
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:46,447
- I don't think I've ever flown into them.
- Massachusetts, very old stock.

109
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:50,238
- Good. Are you happy?
- Yes, I am.

110
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,964
That's all that's important.
That's what I've always wanted for you.

111
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,081
- You really mean that, Father?
- Of course I do.

112
00:07:57,249 --> 00:08:01,162
- Then I have something to tell you.
- Marry the right man, you'll be happy.

113
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,443
- The right man?
- Haven't I always said that?

114
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,203
Find the man of whom I approve,
and he'll make you happy.

115
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:09,007
Do you remember
my telling you that?

116
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:11,723
Yes, now that you mention it.

117
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,519
Doesn't make sense. Why should he
be against your marriage?

118
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:19,203
He just doesn't approve
of mixed marriages.

119
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,400
Oh, I didn't know you were mixed.

120
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:26,287
Oh, yes. I'm English
and she's Norwegian.

121
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:29,885
- That's a mixed marriage?
- To her father it is.

122
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:32,643
- What is he, a Viking?
- Worse.

123
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,601
Well, where is he?
When am I going to get a look at him?

124
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:41,126
- Well, he's not here. Is he, Mother?
- I hope not.

125
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,607
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean, if he was here...

126
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:47,567
...he wouldn't be
where he was supposed to be.

127
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:50,568
Isn't that right, Samantha?

128
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:54,887
Yes. Yes, Mother, that's right. And
he's supposed to be in Washington.

129
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,081
- What do you think of him, Endora?
- Well, I...

130
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,562
I think he'll surprise you.

131
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:05,126
Good.

132
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:07,126
Good.

133
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:11,009
Look, Darrin, you love Samantha,
don't you?

134
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:13,484
- Certainly.
- Well, then you have to fight for her.

135
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:16,482
Stand up to the old man.
What can he do to you?

136
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:20,483
Point a finger at you and blow you up
like you were made of glass?

137
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:28,725
It's a shame I'm not going to see
that young man of yours.

138
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:31,357
Yes, well, it's too bad
you can't stay longer.

139
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,402
Darrin should be home in a few days.

140
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:37,199
He's been working so hard lately.

141
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,367
Well, aren't you going to answer it?

142
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:43,167
- The telephone?
- Yes.

143
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:46,361
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

144
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:49,201
Hello?

145
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:52,924
- Oh, hello, Darrin. How are you?
- I'm in a bar, getting drunk.

146
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,643
You're so far away,
I can hardly hear you.

147
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:57,805
He's so far away,
I can hardly hear him.

148
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,287
- You won't be home for a week.
- Why not?

149
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:04,640
Oh, that's a shame. You see,
my father dropped in tonight...

150
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,879
...and I was hoping
the two of you would meet.

151
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:10,206
If you think I'll spend a week
in this bar, you're out of your mind.

152
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:14,522
Oh, no. No, of course not.
Just a moment.

153
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:18,921
I think I better take this
in the other room. You understand.

154
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:21,597
Of course. Go ahead, darling.

155
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:26,439
She's turned into quite a girl.
Chip off the old block, eh?

156
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:28,321
If you say so, Maurice.

157
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:33,003
Chanson du Mer '59.

158
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:36,007
Quite like old times. Brussels.

159
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:40,765
Remember I'épaule de mouton?
What a weekend that was.

160
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:43,722
We were never in
Brussels together, Maurice.

161
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:47,808
Of course we were,
I remember distinctly. You were...

162
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:50,448
No, no, perhaps you're right.

163
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,688
You always did have a memory
like a steel trap, Endora.

164
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:58,404
Chanson du Mer '59,
'53 was much better.

165
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:02,398
No '53.

166
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:05,720
Oh, well, probably only
half a dozen bottles left.

167
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:09,205
- Darrin, you can't!
- I don't care, Sam. I'm coming home.

168
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:13,482
I beg of you, Darrin. Please don't
come home. Please listen to me.

169
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:16,157
I'm through listening. Goodbye.

170
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:19,089
Hello? Hello, Darrin?

171
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:21,968
Please understand I'm doing this
for your own good.

172
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,006
Larry!

173
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,162
Larry, get me out of here!

174
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,087
- What's the matter?
- What do you mean, what's the matter?

175
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:41,763
- I'm stuck in here.
- Oh, come on, pull on it. Pull.

176
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:45,003
What's wrong with this door?

177
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:49,121
There's Darrin.
We were on our honeymoon.

178
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:51,484
Nice-Iooking boy.

179
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:53,804
What's this?

180
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:56,079
That's Darrin when he was a lieutenant.

181
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,844
- Well, what's he doing in the service?
- Everybody goes into the service.

182
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,688
Everybody, perhaps, but not us.

183
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:08,367
Well, you see,
it's really very simple. He's...

184
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,446
He's what?

185
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:15,558
He's patriotic.
He's always been patriotic.

186
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,398
I have pictures of him in World War I,
the Spanish-American War...

187
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:22,845
...and the War of 1812.
Before that, I have paintings.

188
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,839
Well, come on, fellas.
Easy. Down easy.

189
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,766
Easy does it.

190
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:36,403
Yeah, we'll have you out
in a few minutes, Darrin.

191
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:37,843
- Okay.
- Did you talk to her?

192
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,119
- You bet your life I did.
- What did she say?

193
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:42,638
She said not to come home,
but I said I had enough.

194
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:46,245
- I'm coming home right now.
- Want me to drive you?

195
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,805
No, it's too far, but there's
a new train in service, Larry...

196
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,039
...but I don't know
what time it leaves.

197
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:55,241
- Have you got a dime?
- Yeah.

198
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:00,447
Here you are.

199
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:05,487
Thanks, Larry.

200
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:08,165
I have in this hand a certificate...

201
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,446
...testifying to the birth of
a male child named Stephens...

202
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:13,406
...first name Darrin...

203
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:17,642
...mother, Phyllis, father, Frank.
Would you care to explain?

204
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:20,084
Yes. Yes, I would.

205
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:26,485
- It's a front to fool the neighbours.
- I tried that. It almost worked.

206
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:28,567
Almost?

207
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:30,560
I also found this.

208
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:33,846
"Darrin Stephens.
One capsule after each meal.

209
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:37,365
Two before bedtime." Does the front
to fool the neighbours...

210
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,724
...extend to the bathroom
medicine cabinet?

211
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,248
No, of course not.

212
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:44,088
Then why would a warlock
be needing medicine...

213
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:46,604
...unless, of course,
he's not a warlock at all?

214
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:50,688
Can you tell me when the last train
leaves for Morning Glory Circle?

215
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:52,646
Thank you.

216
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:58,320
Twenty minutes. Larry, can you
have me out of here by then?

217
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:01,965
Don't worry. If we can't,
we'll ship you railroad express.

218
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:12,007
- Is he or isn't he?
- Father, please.

219
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:15,963
Just tell me the truth.
Is my son-in-law a warlock or not?

220
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:21,118
- You won't get angry?
- I reserve that privilege.

221
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:24,602
Father, please sit down.

222
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:32,440
It's true.

223
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,686
Darrin is mortal.

224
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:39,082
You're not angry, are you?

225
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:43,563
Father, please.

226
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:49,317
Maurice, control yourself.

227
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:53,165
Father, your temper.

228
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:01,720
Stop carrying on.

229
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:10,527
Stop acting like a child.

230
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:18,282
Oh, Maurice, you're being ridiculous.

231
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:20,844
And you, I turn my back
and what happens?

232
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:23,443
She marries a common,
ordinary mortal.

233
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,800
Darrin is neither common
nor ordinary.

234
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,319
- I am not talking to you.
- Times have changed, Maurice.

235
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:34,118
- This happens in the best of families.
- It does not happen in my family.

236
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:39,357
Well, it has. It's over and done with.
I'm married.

237
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:43,483
And I am going to annul the marriage,
Samantha, forever.

238
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:56,679
- Washington, eh?
- Father. Mother.

239
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,767
Very good, Endora.

240
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,280
- What have you done with him?
- Wouldn't you like to know.

241
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:13,644
Endora.

242
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,760
Perhaps you frighten
Samantha, Maurice...

243
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:18,648
...but you certainly
don't frighten me.

244
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:20,362
Where is he?

245
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:33,479
You're getting stronger, Endora.

246
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:39,843
- You're getting older, dear.
- I'll find him.

247
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:47,362
Wouldn't you like to bring in
the evening paper, dear?

248
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:56,963
A flower, a bird, a tree.
What do you think, Samantha?

249
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:01,525
- What's that you have there?
- Just the evening paper.

250
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:04,602
I can't understand it.

251
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:08,557
A girl of your background, your
breeding. I can't understand.

252
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:09,764
Yes, I can.

253
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,568
- It shows a complete lack of respect.
- Please!

254
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:14,321
You young people are all the same:

255
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:17,606
No feeling for tradition,
no sense of history.

256
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,403
It's a disgrace.

257
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:41,248
- Are you all right, darling?
- Yes. Yes, I'm all right.

258
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:42,888
Excuse me, sweetheart.

259
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,688
Now, look, you. So far
I've been locked in a phone booth...

260
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:48,488
...turned into a newspaper,
I've been banged on one end...

261
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:51,447
...and burned on the other.
I may be a source of amusement...

262
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:54,919
...but I'm also married to your
daughter. She loves me and I love her.

263
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:58,445
We're gonna stay married whether
you like it or not. Is that clear?

264
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:01,601
I have to admit, he has courage.

265
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:05,678
- You certainly picked a good one.
- I told you, Father.

266
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:08,278
It's a shame I have to do this.

267
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:16,320
Father!

268
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:18,847
Father, how could you?

269
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:24,087
- I did it for your own good, Samantha.
- Maurice, you have no right.

270
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:27,884
- You keep out of this, Endora.
- Bring him back.

271
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:33,529
- Father, please bring him back.
- Someday you'll thank me for this.

272
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,920
Thank you?

273
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:38,478
I never want to see you again.

274
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:41,078
You don't really mean that,
you're excited.

275
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:51,559
How dare you speak like that
to your father?

276
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,204
Maurice...

277
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:55,640
...I'm not overly fond
of that boy either...

278
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:58,881
...but I won't have a human being
on my conscience. Bring him back.

279
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:01,649
I'm sorry, Endora.
What's done is done.

280
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,398
You bring him back,
or I'll make your life miserable for you.

281
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:07,241
And you know I can do it.

282
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:10,400
I'll move in with you.

283
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:16,638
Father, if you love me,
please bring him back.

284
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:18,805
Does it really mean
that much to you?

285
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:22,797
I love him. With all my heart,
I love him.

286
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:25,079
Please don't take him away from me.

287
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:28,761
Very well.

288
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,328
I'll try.

289
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:33,288
What do you mean, try?

290
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:37,599
I'm sorry, Endora.
I gave him a terrible jolt.

291
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:41,320
Don't waste time, do something.

292
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,559
- Well?
- I'm trying.

293
00:19:56,849 --> 00:20:00,444
Please, Father, I know you can do it.

294
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:07,284
He's doing it. You're doing it!
Where's the rest of him?

295
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:16,281
That's it. That's it, Maurice.
You have it in you. I know you have.

296
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:20,283
- Keep it up, keep it up.
- Oh, go to it, Maurice. Go to it.

297
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:33,206
Oh, look at that technique.

298
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,479
Please try harder, Daddy.

299
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:02,682
He did it! He did it!

300
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:07,639
- Oh, Darrin.
- Very good. Very good indeed.

301
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:13,564
- Is that all of him?
- Yes. That's all of him.

302
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:17,602
You all right, Darrin?

303
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:20,928
Well...

304
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:25,759
...here we are.
Just one big, happy family.

305
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:33,639
Of course, we haven't
discussed it much...

306
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:39,008
...but I'm partial to large families.
- Oh, yes, so am I. Four or five, at least.

307
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:42,246
Grandchildren might be a good idea.
What do you think, Endora?

308
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:45,003
There's no need to rush
on my account.

309
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:48,281
Oh, no. No, of course not.
We have plenty of time.

310
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:50,286
But there's something
I should tell you.

311
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:54,402
- Lf the first one's a boy...
- Now, none of the silly sentimentality.

312
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,764
You don't have to name
the baby after me.

313
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:00,365
Oh, well, I'm glad you feel
that way, Daddy...

314
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,568
...because Darrin promised his father
that we'd name the first boy after him.

315
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:08,883
Oh, well, I suppose
some people need that.

316
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:10,448
Well, I must fly.

317
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:15,160
But before I go, I want to propose
a toast, Chanson du Mer '59.

318
00:22:15,489 --> 00:22:19,926
Fifty-nine? For this family?
Nothing doing.

319
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,804
How about '53?

320
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:31,401
Chanson du Mer '53.

321
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:35,162
Chanson du Mer '53.

322
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:37,644
Are you...?

323
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:41,882
- Are you sure he's not one of us?
- It isn't chilled though.

324
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:44,205
He's not one of us.

325
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:47,118
It's chilled, my boy.

326
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:51,959
Perfect.

327
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,885
Although I take a dim view
of most mortals...

328
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:57,358
...you've made
a favourable impression, Donald.

After a century or two...

331
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:06,166
...I might get to like you
as well as I like this champagne.

332
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:09,202
Too bad you won't be
around that long.

333
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:12,008
Happiness, darling.

00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:17,477
Delightful to see you again, my love.

One and all, auf Wiedersehen.

Au rev oir, Maurice.

He always was very big on exits.
