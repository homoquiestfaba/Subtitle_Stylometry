1
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,139
Panama.

2
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:40,875
Panama?

3
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,379
Best l could do, Andrew...

4
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,849
...in the circumstances,
given your sins.

5
00:00:46,287 --> 00:00:48,050
They were baying for blood.

6
00:00:50,058 --> 00:00:51,753
l argued your case.

7
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:56,262
''For his long service,
his fine brain in the balance...

8
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:58,056
...against the gambling debts...

9
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,861
...the blown cover and the wives.''

10
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,231
The wives.

11
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:07,566
So, a last chance.

12
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:08,833
Panama.

13
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,272
Keep the head down?

14
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:13,471
Serve out my time?

15
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:16,013
Not quite, Andrew.
We do have interests:

16
00:01:16,217 --> 00:01:19,846
The canal, vital artery.
There is work to be done.

17
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:25,424
But for God's sake,
be careful out there, man.

18
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,152
There's a nasty web
of money-laundering...

19
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:30,388
...drug trafficking and corruption.

20
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:32,359
Really?

21
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:36,527
There are only 200
resident Brits in Panama.

22
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:39,802
Butyou can surely ferret
out one or two...

23
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:43,774
...who can gain you access
to the corridors ofpower.

24
00:01:58,192 --> 00:02:02,094
Look, look!
The Bridge of the Americas.

25
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,958
You know, eversince
the canal cut them in half...

26
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,467
...this bridge is now the only link...

27
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,573
...between North and South America.

28
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:16,239
Think about it!

29
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,469
The way l see it,
we all have a dream of ourselves...

30
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:53,477
...that we could be more than we are.

31
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:57,443
Well, Pendel and Braithwaite are here
to help you realize that dream...

32
00:02:57,652 --> 00:02:59,847
...in the Savile Row tradition.

33
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,750
Let's try this one now.

34
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,289
Oh, yeah, l guess this is kind of....

35
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:13,799
l thought you'd like that one, sir.
Mr. Connery's choice.

36
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:17,368
As soon as l saw you l thought,
''Who does he remind me of?''

37
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,975
And that's it. ln the build too.
Golfer's shoulders.

38
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:59,096
How about that, Uncle Benny?

39
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:02,970
You've got the fluence, Harry.
l've always said it, and you have.

40
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,271
You're the outright best tailor
in the world. Barnone.

41
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,472
Steady on, Uncle Benny, steady on.

42
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:15,750
Harry, come on.

43
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,083
-l'm coming.
-All right.

44
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:21,928
All right, you get in first, Sarah.
Don't forget your belt.

45
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,323
-Sarah.
-l'm trying!

46
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,520
Mark.

47
00:05:28,903 --> 00:05:30,564
Okay. Bye-bye.

48
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,788
George, George, l saw you yesterday.

49
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,029
All right, here you go then.
How's your old lady?

50
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,537
Sarah, Sarah!

51
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,112
Hi, Bella.

52
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,641
Dad, give me a quarter.

53
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:19,476
Have you learnt your poem?

54
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:22,986
Tyger, tyger, burning bright
ln the forest of the night

55
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:41,307
-See you, Dad.
-Shalom.

56
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:42,737
Shalom.

57
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,591
Look at your hair!

58
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,699
Oh, what immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful cemetery

59
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:09,165
No, ''symmetry.'' Symmetry.

60
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,895
l still don't know what it means.

61
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,576
-Did you see the news last night?
-Yes, l did.

62
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,974
Your people want their canal back.

63
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:24,618
Not my people, Ernesto.
They're rabid, right-wing senators.

64
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,753
-Do you know what they are?
-Say it.

65
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:28,421
Assholes.

66
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,974
You see?

67
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:55,614
Turn around.

68
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,076
lt's only a tad, Ramon.

69
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,186
lf you want to look good in my suit,
lose weight and grow a foot.

70
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:05,951
Come to the shop.
We can ease it a little.

71
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,388
Okay.

72
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:12,156
So, what are we gonna do
about the overdraft, Harry?

73
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,164
You tell me, Ramon.

74
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,462
You have to think
about selling the farm, Harry.

75
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,036
Sell it?

76
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:21,436
lt's a gold mine, Ramon.

77
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:26,011
Angelo's turning it around. He's a
very good man, Ramon. Dedicated.

78
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,310
l hear you got a water problem.

79
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,215
Did have, Ramon, did have.
l put that right.

80
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:33,250
Now, it flows like....

81
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:34,785
Water.

82
00:08:35,256 --> 00:08:36,382
Exactly, Ramon.

83
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:40,188
Maybe you shouldn't have
bought it, eh?

84
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,557
On your advice, Ramon. Fair's fair.

85
00:08:45,132 --> 00:08:47,566
The bank wishes to see
a substantial reduction...

86
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:51,568
...on the outstanding sum
by the end of next month.

87
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:53,296
Otherwise...

88
00:08:54,341 --> 00:08:55,706
...we have to call it in.

89
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,899
What?

90
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:58,305
The whole lot?

91
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:00,571
But of course the whole lot.

92
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,084
You are my friend. l hate
to do this, but my hands are tied.

93
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:08,380
What can l say?

94
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:13,150
What am l going to tell Louisa?
l bought it with her inheritance.

95
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,261
Well, you're the storyteller, Harry.

96
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:33,104
You're an angel.

97
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,846
Someone to see you.

98
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:43,045
Oh, yes? Who?

99
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:45,122
New customer, he say.

100
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:48,293
Hi. Name's Osnard.

101
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,988
l phoned.

102
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,763
Mr. Osnard. Harry Pendel.

103
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:56,232
Very happy to meet you, sir.

104
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:59,938
No offense, but l was hoping
to see Mr. Braithwaite.

105
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:02,976
No chance of that,
l'm sorry to say, sir.

106
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:06,408
My late partner has been dead
and gone these many years.

107
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:10,209
Though his exacting standards
are very much alive and well.

108
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,009
Glad to hear that.

109
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,418
He dressed my father, you know.

110
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:17,591
Back in his Savile Row days.

111
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:21,459
Well, l never! Now that's a first,
l don't mind admitting.

112
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,222
Father to son,
Savile Row to Panama City.

113
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:27,195
-Did you hear that?
-l thought you'd be surprised.

114
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:29,130
Surprised, sir, and delighted.

115
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:32,066
Marta, put Mr. Osnard down
as an old customer.

116
00:10:32,273 --> 00:10:35,208
Arthur Braithwaite made
for his father.

117
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:38,139
Now, if you'd care
to come this way, Mr. Osnard.

118
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,309
What in hell happened to her?

119
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:45,980
ln the bad old days, would that be?
Noriega's time?

120
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,814
Rough justice meted out?

121
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,651
-lf you'd care to take a seat, sir.
-Thank you.

122
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:57,230
We call this The Club Room. Many of
our gentlemen spend time here...

123
00:10:57,431 --> 00:10:59,490
...in the lunch hour
and at the day's end.

124
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,928
And why not?

125
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:03,433
What did you have in mind,
sir, exactly?

126
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:07,073
l thought l'd start with a few
lounge suits. See how they go.

127
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:11,973
After that, well, the ''full monty,''
as old Braithwaite used to say.

128
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,942
l see. Very good, sir.

129
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:18,050
Pity the expression's been hijacked.
Means quite the other thing now.

130
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:21,050
-So they tell me, sir.
-Bollock naked, in fact.

131
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:23,189
-Quite so, sir.
-Money's no problem.

132
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:27,092
Take a look at these, sir.
See what takes your fancy.

133
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:30,860
They're all the right weight
for this diabolical climate.

134
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,000
Seven ounces of nicely breathing,
finest worsted.

135
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:36,635
About all a man could
or should put up with.

136
00:11:36,837 --> 00:11:39,738
How about this one?
Alpaca, am l right?

137
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,601
-Very good, sir.
-Perfect.

138
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:43,800
And exactly what l should've picked.

139
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:45,706
Given that money's no object?

140
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:51,451
-So, what's next?
-Ah! The sun!

141
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,745
Vital statistics.
Please step this way.

142
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:55,319
Certainly.

143
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,956
lf l could ask you to slip off
your jacket. Thank you, sir.

144
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:15,170
You were Noriega's tailor,
weren't you, in his time?

145
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:17,836
l'm sorry, sir, is that a problem?

146
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:21,879
Not necessarily.
Smelly little bugger, was he?

147
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,340
lf l may, sir.

148
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,248
Forty.

149
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:29,046
And the waist....

150
00:12:29,256 --> 00:12:30,689
What's the damage?

151
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:33,189
A very creditable 34-plus.

152
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:34,516
Plus what?

153
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,793
Plus lunch, put it that way, sir.

154
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,429
Very good.

155
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:43,228
Do you ever miss it?
The old country? Savile Row?

156
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:46,871
The Row. Well, now...

157
00:12:47,074 --> 00:12:48,598
...l do and l don't.

158
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,810
Nothing beats it,
but when l was there...

159
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:55,675
...l always felt very much
in old Arthur Braithwaite's shadow.

160
00:12:56,116 --> 00:13:00,280
Though it was Arthur Braithwaite
who encouraged me to spread my wings.

161
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:04,389
-Good old boy, Arthur, was he?
-One of the old school, sir.

162
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:09,319
Now, if l might....

163
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:12,229
Very good, sir.

164
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,399
Do we dress right or left?

165
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:18,264
Most gentlemen favor left these days.
Don't think it's political.

166
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:22,465
Never know where the bloody thing is.
Bobs about like a windsock.

167
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,145
-You were saying?
-Saying, sir?

168
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:29,248
Braithwaite. Telling you
to spread your wings.

169
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,652
Yes, of course.
l remember it like yesterday.

170
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,516
l was cutting a nice muted check
hacking jacket for Lord Braeburn.

171
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:39,318
Finest mohair, dash of cashmere.

172
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,786
l looked up and he was looking
at me from the doorway.

173
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,927
Arthur Braithwaite, that is.

174
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:47,692
He was a big man, imposing.

175
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:50,631
He had a presence.
lt's hard to put it into words.

176
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:52,635
-lt was the moustache.
-Moustache?

177
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,172
Bloody great bushy job,
soup all over it.

178
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:59,472
-There was no moustache in my day.
-l can see it now. Bright brown.

179
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,081
l think we're being rumbled, Harry.
Admit nothing. Deny all.

180
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:05,251
l think your memory's playing tricks.

181
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:09,650
You're thinking of another man and
awarding his moustache to Braithwaite.

182
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:12,723
Go on.

183
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:17,056
''Harry,'' he says to me,
''l think you've earned your spurs.

184
00:14:17,264 --> 00:14:19,425
How would you feel
about taking my name...

185
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:22,101
...and tradition to the New World?

186
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:24,668
l'm talking about a full partnership.''

187
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:27,705
l don't mind saying,
there were tears in my eyes.

188
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,206
You've practically got tears in mine.

189
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:31,803
Thank you, sir.

190
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,912
l've never heard such a load
of bullshit in my life.

191
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,282
Come and sit down, Harry.

192
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:41,815
lt's all right.

193
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,319
l'm your fairy godmother.

194
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,450
The thing is, Harry,
l know who you are.

195
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:51,931
More accurately,
l know who you aren't.

196
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:55,329
-l don't know what you're saying.
-lt's all right. Relax.

197
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:59,063
Because l know. You're 90601 7 Pendel.

198
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,673
Six years for arson,
served two and a half.

199
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,834
Learnt your tailoring in the slammer.
lnsurance scam, wasn't it?

200
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:08,480
Set fire to a warehouse
for your Uncle Benny.

201
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:11,173
They caught you
with the matches in your hand.

202
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:13,216
You've never been near Savile Row.

203
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,217
Braithwaite is your Uncle Benny...

204
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:19,051
...raised from the dead, born again
and given a size-nine halo.

205
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,797
Upon release, you did a runner to
Panama with your Uncle Benny's help.

206
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,865
Built up a fine business.

207
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:33,096
Married the daughter of an American
canal engineer. Well-respected man.

208
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,041
But you owe the bank 50,000,
thanks to that farm.

209
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:39,735
You've put in the shop
and the house as collateral.

210
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:42,507
Not wise, Harry. Not wise at all.

211
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,282
l can almost hear the creditors
banging on the door.

212
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,746
Who are you?

213
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:49,715
l'm Andy Osnard.

214
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:53,222
New boy at the British Embassy,
finding my way around town.

215
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:03,369
Strictly between us...

216
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:06,128
...l'm Ml.6's man in Panama.

217
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,567
lt's dark and lonely work,
like oral sex.

218
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:11,767
But someone has to do it, Harry.

219
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:16,479
l'm opening up a little network.
Keeping an eye on the canal.

220
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:19,148
So, what's that got to do with me?

221
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,446
What gives you
the right to come here...

222
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:25,318
...sandbag me with my past
after l've paid my debt to society?

223
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,290
Cool down. l'm bonus.

224
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:31,625
Okay.

225
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:32,921
What do you want?

226
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,365
Your memory.

227
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:37,035
Your ''rock of eye.''

228
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:41,230
lsn't that the expression? Things you
know and don't even know you know.

229
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:43,500
Highest prices paid.

230
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,307
Get out. Now.

231
00:16:48,682 --> 00:16:49,876
Off.

232
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:53,448
Don't be a cunt, Harry.
We're made for each other.

233
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:56,782
You have debts, l have money.
Where's your patriotism?

234
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,787
l had it out in prison,
without an anesthetic.

235
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,200
There's five grand there.
Say it's on account of the suits.

236
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:14,602
Call it ''entertainment expenses,''
anything you like, really.

237
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:16,935
l want us to get on, Harry.

238
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:18,535
Go on.

239
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,240
Show me around, is all.

240
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,680
Do l have a choice?

241
00:17:27,888 --> 00:17:29,947
Oh, don't put it like that.

242
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:33,684
lt's a game. Let's have some fun, eh?

243
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,858
Hi.

244
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,467
No, nothing much.

245
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:47,472
Well, sure, if you feel you have to.

246
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:52,102
-Why not just bring him home?
-l think l'll take him to the club.

247
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,378
Not sure. He's an odd chap.

248
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,849
No, nothing's wrong.

249
00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:00,142
Your voice sounds funny.

250
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:07,255
He called it a windsock?

251
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:21,636
Señor. Good evening, Mr. Pendel.

252
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:26,334
-Must have cost a lot to get in here.
-Had to be done.

253
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:29,606
Hey, Harry, what about my blazer?

254
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:33,649
Drop by on Tuesday, Luis.
lt'll be ready to try on.

255
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:36,786
Blazers, they all want blazers.

256
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,651
You dress everyone here?

257
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:40,156
Just about, Andy.

258
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,884
So who are ''they''?

259
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:43,756
Who gets to join?

260
00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:47,559
Basically, 30 ruling families,
their lawyers and their bankers.

261
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:49,793
And their tailors, l take it.

262
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,334
When the Americans took out
Noriega, l said to myself:

263
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,374
''Harry, they got Ali Baba,
but they missed the 40 thieves.''

264
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:59,073
Well, here they are.

265
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,179
So fill me in.

266
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:04,145
Nobody ever loses
their reputation in Panama.

267
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,616
They hang it in the closet
for a bit to get its shape back.

268
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:10,756
When they put it on again,
it's as good as new.

269
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:13,716
On the dance floor, Rafi Domingo.

270
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:16,555
Shipping and drugs.

271
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:19,692
l could fuck that very easily.

272
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:26,296
-Wouldn't be any pain at all.
-A lot have, Andy.

273
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:28,497
A lot wish they had, who haven't...

274
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,076
...and one or two have,
who wish they hadn't.

275
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:38,114
Who are those charmers just come in?

276
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:41,452
Government ministers
and the money boys who own them.

277
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:45,558
At the table, bunch of gentlemen
from the loyal opposition.

278
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,125
They come much cheaper, naturally.

279
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:56,733
Welcome to Panama.

280
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,301
A Casablanca without heroes.

281
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,303
You are pure gold, Harry.

282
00:20:02,642 --> 00:20:03,836
Hey!

283
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:06,478
Harry!

284
00:20:07,714 --> 00:20:08,874
Mickie.

285
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:13,208
Harry.

286
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,651
Mickie, l think you're
a touch refreshed!

287
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:18,447
Please, come and sit down.

288
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:21,092
''A man should stand on his feet.''

289
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:23,685
Anyone remember that?!

290
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,960
lsn't that the next bit?

291
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:32,871
''Never on our knees.'' Right.
Or on our asses.

292
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:37,203
-So who the fuck are you, my friend?
-l'd like you to meet Andy Osnard.

293
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,843
British Embassy.

294
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:41,343
Mickie really is a genuine hero, Andy.

295
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:44,711
One of the few with the guts
to stand up to you-know-who.

296
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:47,478
Mickie, please sit down.
People are staring.

297
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:50,451
l don't give a fuck about these fucks.

298
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:54,388
These are the fucks who kept
that fuck Noriega in power.

299
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:57,085
You know what l would do--
Mr. Andy, right?

300
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,788
You know what l would do
if l was president?

301
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,265
-What?
-l'd kill every fuck in this room.

302
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,767
All of us.

303
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:07,633
Look at us. Look at us!

304
00:21:09,743 --> 00:21:13,144
We got everything
God needed to make paradise.

305
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:14,404
And what do we do?

306
00:21:14,614 --> 00:21:16,673
We sell each other.

307
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:19,477
We sell our country.
We sell it all away!

308
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:21,586
Harry, you take him for a walk.

309
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:23,653
Look at these people, eh!

310
00:21:24,257 --> 00:21:25,588
Look at these people.

311
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,387
You sold your souls,
you don't even know it. Stupid!

312
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:34,799
lf you make any more trouble,
l will never cut you another suit.

313
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,905
Come on. l'll take you home.

314
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:43,138
Sorry. He's an old friend,
you know.

315
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:47,176
Hello, Harry.

316
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,278
Señor Delgado. Buenos noches.

317
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:51,950
Canal Commissioner?
He as clean as they say?

318
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:54,017
Well, my wife thinks so.

319
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:56,722
Come on, Mickie, what is this?

320
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,997
Come on, Mickie.

321
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,361
You're a good man, Harry.

322
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:20,505
The only good men left in Panama City
are you and me.

323
00:23:20,707 --> 00:23:23,972
-That's all. You and me.
-Okay, in you go. Come on.

324
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,771
He has heart, Mr. Cool.

325
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:30,972
Heart.

326
00:23:31,184 --> 00:23:33,448
Come on, now. Call it a night.

327
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,462
So, what's the story with him?

328
00:23:50,236 --> 00:23:51,430
Mickie?

329
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,138
He was my first customer.

330
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:56,900
Best-looking man in Panama.

331
00:23:58,178 --> 00:23:59,236
A god.

332
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,944
Till Noriega threw him
into prison to shut him up.

333
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,213
Didn't bloody well work, did it?

334
00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:10,383
There's more to Mickie Abraxas
than meets the eye.

335
00:24:10,857 --> 00:24:12,757
Oh, l'm sure there is.

336
00:24:13,727 --> 00:24:16,628
My people don't care
about the glorious past exploits...

337
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,923
...of some shagged-out old wino.

338
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:22,329
They want the real stuff.
Today's men.

339
00:24:22,936 --> 00:24:24,631
Tomorrow's, not yesterday's.

340
00:24:25,905 --> 00:24:28,339
We're not a fucking charity
for losers.

341
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:33,441
l hope l haven't made
a mistake with you.

342
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:44,283
Don't underestimate Mickie Abraxas.

343
00:24:44,491 --> 00:24:45,958
So?

344
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,684
What if l was to tell you
he's still at it?

345
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:51,592
At what, exactly?

346
00:24:51,965 --> 00:24:53,592
He's still in there.

347
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:55,792
The Silent Opposition.

348
00:24:56,136 --> 00:24:58,366
The ''Silent Opposition''?

349
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,631
He's never lost touch
with ordinary, decent people.

350
00:25:01,841 --> 00:25:03,433
Deprived people.

351
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:07,513
People who are tired
of the corruption, the greed.

352
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,209
Do you know what the poor call those?

353
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:14,477
''The Cocaine Towers.''

354
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,552
And our 85 banks?

355
00:25:16,756 --> 00:25:18,348
''The launderettes.''

356
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:20,317
Can we buy him?

357
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:22,552
Mickie? Never.

358
00:25:24,264 --> 00:25:27,631
But he might allow you
to contribute to the cause.

359
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:39,872
Uncle Benny, l fill up. l can't stop.
l get the wind in my ears.

360
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,106
You've got the fluence in full flow
and the rock of eye.

361
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:46,877
But it's a curse
as well as a blessing.

362
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:05,227
How'd it go?

363
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,377
Fine. l think.

364
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:13,807
Hey...

365
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:16,672
...get in here.

366
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,022
Hi.

367
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:31,360
l missed you.

368
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:35,199
Wait, l'll take my socks off.

369
00:26:36,603 --> 00:26:38,468
l may be some time.

370
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:17,099
Mr. Osnard.

371
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:19,538
Ah, Andrew Osnard.

372
00:27:19,746 --> 00:27:23,182
Nigel Stormont. Francesca Deane.

373
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:25,044
-Hello.
-Welcome to Panama.

374
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:26,775
Thank you, ambassador.

375
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:27,953
Please.

376
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:32,215
l gather you've been having
a look round already...

377
00:27:32,425 --> 00:27:33,392
...quite extensively.

378
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:35,584
Yes, indeed. Great spot.

379
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:37,023
Right up my street.

380
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:42,031
And how should we describe your
street, Andrew...

381
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:43,862
...to the curious?

382
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,870
l usually say
l'm in information technology.

383
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:49,769
Oh, you're one of them.

384
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:51,136
''A friend.''

385
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,672
That's right. l'm a friend.

386
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,517
Oh, my dear, but it's a huge secret.

387
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,312
Or it was, until Osnard blubbed it.

388
00:28:01,521 --> 00:28:04,786
l mean, l'm barely allowed to know it.

389
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:07,755
Not the Osnard got
drummed out of Madrid?

390
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:09,585
Foreign minister's wife, wasn't it?

391
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,827
Not his wife. Mistress.

392
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:16,297
There are some things
l won't do for England.

393
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:19,470
Got your picture in the paper,
didn't it?

394
00:28:19,672 --> 00:28:22,197
Hence my posting to Panama.
What was your crime?

395
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:24,910
Coffee?

396
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:26,169
Thank you.

397
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:27,903
Help yourself.

398
00:28:28,214 --> 00:28:31,445
ls it just exile, or do you
have a purpose here?

399
00:28:33,186 --> 00:28:34,312
Sure.

400
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:38,715
The boys at home are concerned that
the world's biggest trade gateway...

401
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,086
...doesn't fall into
the wrong hands...

402
00:28:43,963 --> 00:28:46,158
...now that it's in the wrong hands.

403
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:50,227
Forgive me.
Don't want to seem presumptuous...

404
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:52,961
...but l doubt you'll find
anything they don't know...

405
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:55,766
...from our regular embassy briefings.

406
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:01,275
Know about the Silent Opposition?

407
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:06,850
There you go.

408
00:29:10,556 --> 00:29:12,353
You're a fast worker.

409
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,755
See something worth having,
go after it.

410
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,430
May l ask at what point we here
at the embassy...

411
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,599
...will get sight of your product?

412
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:24,470
My boss says no local sharing unless
he gives the nod...

413
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:27,469
...but l'm not really bothered
about that.

414
00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:31,040
Say, the four of us in this room?

415
00:29:32,178 --> 00:29:34,169
l'd have no problem with that.

416
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:39,445
Well, all that seems very
satisfactory. Nigel?

417
00:29:40,253 --> 00:29:41,686
Francesca?

418
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:43,979
Good to have you with us, Andrew.

419
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:46,119
Good to be here.

420
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,221
Francesca will show you
to your office.

421
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:51,289
Yes.

422
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,961
lt's a bit on the poky side,
l'm afraid.

423
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:02,606
Bit on the poky side's fine with me.

424
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:05,073
We thought you'd be out
and about a lot.

425
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:06,643
Here we are.

426
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,820
What are you listening to?

427
00:30:24,597 --> 00:30:25,586
The sea.

428
00:30:31,938 --> 00:30:35,499
Bloody thing's been sitting in
the warehouse all its life.

429
00:30:36,976 --> 00:30:39,103
Stuck on one combo.

430
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:42,974
Tumblers all shot.

431
00:30:48,454 --> 00:30:49,751
Gotcha!

432
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,522
Are you quite sure that it
was locked in the first place?

433
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:06,231
l'm staying at the Gamboa Rain Forest
Resort till the apartment's ready.

434
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:07,997
Come out on Sunday.

435
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:11,802
Spot of lunch. Swim in the lake.

436
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:14,840
See how it goes.

437
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,844
l think l'm busy on Sunday.

438
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:20,541
You're right.

439
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:23,020
lt was open.

440
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:27,692
Just tight from lack of use.

441
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:35,094
The ambassador's asked me
to brief you...

442
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:37,861
...in case there's anything you
don't already know.

443
00:31:44,677 --> 00:31:48,738
Noriega formed these so-called
''Dignity Battalions.''

444
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,506
Dingbats.

445
00:31:50,716 --> 00:31:55,744
They were to beat the dignity out of
anyone remotely critical of Noriega.

446
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,250
lt was Dr. Frankenstein,
George Bush...

447
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,088
...who created this monster...

448
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,025
...when he was head of the ClA.

449
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:07,028
And when Noriega's...

450
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:11,135
...drug running and brutality
got too much, even for the ClA...

451
00:32:11,337 --> 00:32:16,172
...it was George, now President Bush,
who decided to take him out.

452
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:18,374
And just to make sure...

453
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:22,304
...they fire-bombed a big chunk
of the old city.

454
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:28,348
Sadly, that's where
the anti-Noriega rebels were.

455
00:32:28,554 --> 00:32:31,717
The handful that Noriega hadn't
banged up already.

456
00:32:32,725 --> 00:32:36,889
So no more opposition,
silent or otherwise.

457
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,725
Burnt...

458
00:32:39,532 --> 00:32:41,124
...scattered...

459
00:32:42,768 --> 00:32:44,201
...fled.

460
00:32:47,807 --> 00:32:50,674
Or risen again from the ashes.

461
00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:06,791
Okay, okay, okay.
Everybody, here we go.

462
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:16,867
Sorry.

463
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:33,641
Mickie!

464
00:33:34,987 --> 00:33:36,318
Come in.

465
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:54,766
Sorry about the other night.
l'm going through a bad patch.

466
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:58,740
ls it money, Mickie? ls it?
Maybe l can help.

467
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:02,241
You?

468
00:34:03,683 --> 00:34:06,243
You got worse debts than me.

469
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,881
Mr. Farmer, huh?

470
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:17,587
Do you still keep in touch,
you know...

471
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:20,891
...with any of the students,
the fighters, from the old days?

472
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,696
No, they're all lawyers now. Bankers.

473
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,803
Haven't you heard?
We got a democracy.

474
00:34:30,009 --> 00:34:32,603
There's still a lot to fight for,
Mickie.

475
00:34:34,046 --> 00:34:36,674
l haven't got the stomach for it.

476
00:34:36,882 --> 00:34:39,942
l get the shakes when l see a cop.

477
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:44,614
Unless l'm drunk,
and then l want to hit him.

478
00:34:45,024 --> 00:34:47,049
Either way....

479
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,720
What about Marta's people?

480
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:51,889
They loved you.

481
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:53,728
They looked up to you.

482
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,400
You should give up on me, Harry.

483
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,270
l'm a lost cause.

484
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,872
How much do you owe, Mickie?

485
00:35:06,078 --> 00:35:08,569
Owe to the casino? To you?

486
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:11,215
All of it. All in. Come on.

487
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,784
Not much change out of 20 grand.

488
00:35:17,623 --> 00:35:19,215
l'll get it for you, Mickie.

489
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:22,590
And l'm gonna make you a new suit.

490
00:35:23,129 --> 00:35:26,155
A lovely silk and mohair herringbone.

491
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:29,030
Okay?

492
00:35:29,235 --> 00:35:31,897
Okay. Okay.

493
00:35:43,582 --> 00:35:45,607
-Señor Pendel?
-What have l done wrong, Marta?

494
00:35:45,818 --> 00:35:48,685
Nothing. That's the problem.
Look at these accounts.

495
00:35:48,888 --> 00:35:51,516
Your friend Rafi Domingo.
Two months overdue.

496
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:54,215
Carry it till next month.
He's a good customer.

497
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:57,487
He's a shit. He made all his
money under Noriega.

498
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,164
l'm going to charge him interest.

499
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,265
-You can't do that.
-Yes, l can.

500
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:04,368
You're worried they won't like you
if you make them pay.

501
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,730
lt's a tradition.

502
00:36:05,938 --> 00:36:08,236
Gentlemen keep tailors
waiting for money.

503
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:11,433
Gentlemen? Find me one.

504
00:36:11,877 --> 00:36:15,369
Your Mr. Osnard isn't one,
that's for sure.

505
00:36:15,581 --> 00:36:17,811
-What does he want?
-A suit.

506
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,612
This is me, Harry.

507
00:36:20,419 --> 00:36:22,649
He's looking for information.

508
00:36:22,855 --> 00:36:26,222
Be nice to him. No sulks.
Promise?

509
00:36:26,692 --> 00:36:27,954
He's a devil.

510
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,718
-Who says?
-His eyes say.

511
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:31,988
l'm just having a bit
of a natter with him.

512
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:35,065
Don't look at me like that, Marta.
l'm just a tailor.

513
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:39,465
No, Harry, not just a tailor.
You are a dreamer.

514
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:42,436
Which is why l have to
watch over you.

515
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:46,538
Oh, speak of the devil. Mr. Osnard!

516
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,407
How's my suit coming along then?

517
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:50,946
When l put the shears
into that alpaca, l said:

518
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,880
''Harry, this is gonna be
something special.''

519
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,154
A poem, is it?

520
00:36:57,356 --> 00:36:59,517
Great body.

521
00:36:59,892 --> 00:37:03,191
As long as her face is turned away
when you're fucking her.

522
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,894
Marta's decent. She's been
in some very bad places.

523
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,964
Oh, yeah? Such as?

524
00:37:09,668 --> 00:37:12,000
Here. Under Noriega.

525
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:19,507
She stood up when the rest
of us were lying down.

526
00:37:19,712 --> 00:37:21,509
That's why they did her face for her.

527
00:37:21,714 --> 00:37:24,615
Are her sacred causes still intact?

528
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:27,243
She'd never budge.

529
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,784
Not Marta.

530
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:30,683
So she's one of them.

531
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,257
-One of who?
-The Silent Opposition.

532
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,620
Absolutely.

533
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:38,194
-Harry, stop.
-l can't.

534
00:37:38,397 --> 00:37:39,864
What is she?

535
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:43,731
Their chief of ops?

536
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,429
Head spook?

537
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,835
-She's more. Much more.
-How much?

538
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:51,407
You press me too hard, Andy.

539
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:56,508
Sweetheart, you haven't even
felt me yet.

540
00:37:56,749 --> 00:37:58,740
Think ''farm.''

541
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:03,547
She's their Joan of Arc.
Their spiritual leader, bar none.

542
00:38:04,924 --> 00:38:06,949
You're too much, Harry.

543
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,957
Can l have her?

544
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,455
Every penny you give her goes
to the cause...

545
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,100
...without commission
or deduction of any kind.

546
00:38:16,302 --> 00:38:17,291
How much?

547
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,869
For the pulse and soul
of the Silent Opposition?

548
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:21,767
For Marta?

549
00:38:21,974 --> 00:38:24,442
Mickie needs 20 grand
to activate his units.

550
00:38:24,643 --> 00:38:26,668
Marta should get the same.

551
00:38:27,012 --> 00:38:29,913
-Yeah, l think we can swing that.
-Thank you, Mr. Osnard.

552
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:33,778
London's tickled pink with this
Silent Opposition of yours.

553
00:38:37,823 --> 00:38:39,791
How is the farm, by the way?

554
00:38:39,992 --> 00:38:41,926
-Don't ask.
-Know who your neighbor is?

555
00:38:42,127 --> 00:38:44,357
The guy who's cutting off access
to your water?

556
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:46,997
He's not a person,
he's an absentee landlord...

557
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,633
...and a corporation in Miami.
And a prick.

558
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:52,935
You know where he banks?

559
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,166
With your chum Ramon.

560
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,103
Not to put too fine a point on it,
he is your chum Ramon.

561
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:02,280
Well, Ramon owns two thirds.

562
00:39:04,683 --> 00:39:06,878
Mr. X owns the other third.

563
00:39:07,486 --> 00:39:08,851
You know who Mr. X is?

564
00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:11,655
No, l don't know who Mr. X is.

565
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:14,952
How about your farm-manager chap?

566
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,694
Angelo, isn't it?

567
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,282
No!

568
00:39:47,893 --> 00:39:49,622
Mickie! Marta!

569
00:39:49,828 --> 00:39:51,819
Oh, for the love of God!

570
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,367
Mickie!

571
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:03,335
-Oh, God!
-lt's okay.

572
00:40:05,377 --> 00:40:06,969
What time is it?

573
00:40:07,212 --> 00:40:08,873
lt's 7:00.

574
00:40:13,218 --> 00:40:15,516
l'll make breakfast.

575
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,931
What happened to your diet, Mom?

576
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:31,227
l'm in denial.

577
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:32,631
What's denial?

578
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:34,669
A very big river in Africa.

579
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:36,807
-Ba-bum!
-Thank you.

580
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:41,339
Mom, this girl in school told me
mothers who work...

581
00:40:41,547 --> 00:40:45,210
...feel guilty about their children.
Why don't you?

582
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:48,011
Maybe because your father
is such a good mother.

583
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,383
Listen, it's ballet today.
Do not forget your bag.

584
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,387
-Let's go.
-Okay, come on.

585
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,057
Are you seeing
the president today, Dad?

586
00:41:00,265 --> 00:41:02,699
lndeed. So we'd
better get our skates on.

587
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:13,111
Harold Pendel.

588
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,686
This way, Mr. Pendel.

589
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:37,367
Working. Always working.
He thinks only of Panama.

590
00:41:45,277 --> 00:41:46,869
Señor Pendel.

591
00:41:47,246 --> 00:41:48,679
Show me your pass, please.

592
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,781
Marco, you know me.

593
00:41:50,983 --> 00:41:53,315
l made you that
double-breasted mohair.

594
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:56,010
l'm still waiting for you
to pay me for it.

595
00:41:56,221 --> 00:42:00,317
Through here. He's gonna give you
only five minutes, okay?

596
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:10,065
Your Excellency.
Welcome back, indeed.

597
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,838
Five capitals in one week,
l think l read.

598
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:19,537
Paris to Tokyo in seven days.
A record for a world-class statesman.

599
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,076
Pants.

600
00:42:23,782 --> 00:42:26,410
They'll know where Panama is then,
won't they?

601
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:31,318
We won't be just a wriggly little
worm on the map with a canal, will we?

602
00:42:31,523 --> 00:42:33,013
Vest.

603
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:39,255
l dispense with
the rear buckle as a rule...

604
00:42:39,465 --> 00:42:41,933
...with your handmade waistcoat,
Excellency.

605
00:42:42,134 --> 00:42:45,729
Too many of my gentlemen report
a discomfort to the lower vertebrae...

606
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,998
...when leaning backward, relishing
a postprandial cigar.

607
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,038
Jacket.

608
00:42:51,844 --> 00:42:54,404
Did we discuss the canal's future
on our travels...

609
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:55,705
...if l may be so bold?

610
00:43:00,052 --> 00:43:04,011
So you want to know something
about the canal?

611
00:43:04,223 --> 00:43:05,554
lf it pleases Your Excellency.

612
00:43:05,757 --> 00:43:07,850
You're halfway up it.

613
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,789
l stand upright.

614
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:13,490
Okay, just.

615
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:15,667
l bend down...

616
00:43:16,702 --> 00:43:19,262
-...my balls are in my ears.
-Very good, sir.

617
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,201
You make your pants too tight,
Mr. Braithwaite.

618
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:36,276
Harry!

619
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,150
l've got a job.

620
00:43:43,061 --> 00:43:44,892
Shit, shit, shit!

621
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:51,100
lt's upstairs.

622
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:54,202
No. Thank you.

623
00:44:04,149 --> 00:44:07,141
''Harry,'' he says to me,
''you make beautiful pants.

624
00:44:07,352 --> 00:44:10,412
When l was a boy, l dreamed
of wearing pants like these.''

625
00:44:10,622 --> 00:44:11,646
His very words, Andy.

626
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,985
To be quite frank,
do we have to meet here?

627
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,185
lt's not very salubrious.

628
00:44:17,396 --> 00:44:18,920
Good cover, Harry.

629
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:24,159
They rent the rooms by the hour.
Cash. No questions asked.

630
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:26,166
No paper trail.

631
00:44:26,371 --> 00:44:30,171
Anyone sees you going in, you're here
to get your end away. Same as me.

632
00:44:33,745 --> 00:44:35,406
So that's it, is it?

633
00:44:35,914 --> 00:44:38,974
Half hour's téte-á-téte
about knickers.

634
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,281
What about the canal?

635
00:44:43,121 --> 00:44:45,419
Did he say anything about his trip?

636
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:47,622
He had talks, yes.

637
00:44:47,826 --> 00:44:51,284
''Constructive discussions,''
was his phrase, l believe.

638
00:44:52,831 --> 00:44:55,823
You're not gonna pay off the farm
at this rate.

639
00:45:02,441 --> 00:45:04,568
Andy, this is hard for me.

640
00:45:04,776 --> 00:45:08,212
He confides. A tailor's like a priest
in these situations.

641
00:45:08,413 --> 00:45:11,814
For me, the changing room is
as sacred as the confessional.

642
00:45:12,017 --> 00:45:14,281
Lips are sealed, eh?

643
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:19,323
Have you had a chance to make
arrangements about the farm, Andy?

644
00:45:19,524 --> 00:45:23,324
Well, the money's there,
as long as you deliver.

645
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,671
-He's selling it, Andy.
-What?

646
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:39,333
The canal.

647
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:41,611
He's selling it?

648
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:46,216
Has to. Needs the money.
Relieve the poverty. lnfrastructure.

649
00:45:46,418 --> 00:45:47,942
Who's buying?

650
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:49,717
Who's buying?

651
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:52,651
Various interested parties, l believe.

652
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:56,092
-Come on.
-He mentioned the French, the Japanese.

653
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,626
And?

654
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,263
Oh, yeah. And the Chinese.

655
00:46:00,465 --> 00:46:01,762
Harry.

656
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:03,399
Andy.

657
00:46:04,536 --> 00:46:06,197
Are you pulling my pisser?

658
00:46:06,405 --> 00:46:08,805
Not unless the president's
pulling mine.

659
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:12,272
This is fucking dynamite.
Does he always talk to you like this?

660
00:46:12,477 --> 00:46:13,774
Not always...

661
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,037
...but mostly.

662
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:17,715
Now this is for the record.
Times, names, places.

663
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,975
His actual words, if you
remember them.

664
00:46:20,185 --> 00:46:22,710
Goose it up a bit.
lt's going straight to the top.

665
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:25,685
Here we go.
What kind of Chinese, by the way?

666
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,683
You know, Chinese, like Chinese.

667
00:46:28,894 --> 00:46:32,421
Oh, fuck's sake.
l mean, mainland? Taiwan?

668
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,691
The both, Andy. The two together.

669
00:46:37,903 --> 00:46:39,234
Hand in hand.

670
00:46:39,438 --> 00:46:42,134
lt's something the president's
very proud of...

671
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,775
...bringing them together,
at the same table.

672
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:50,073
''Harry,'' he says to me, ''if it's all
l'm remembered for, then so be it.

673
00:46:50,282 --> 00:46:53,649
l brought reconciliation
to the great Chinese people...

674
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,581
...for the betterment of all mankind.''

675
00:46:55,921 --> 00:46:59,550
You've excelled. This is a better
yarn than Arthur Braithwaite.

676
00:46:59,758 --> 00:47:00,850
Are you implying--?

677
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:03,357
Doesn't matter what l think.
lt plays.

678
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,891
First installments:
Abraxas and Marta.

679
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:10,125
-lnstallments?
-Payment on results, Harry.

680
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,269
And the farm as such, Andy?

681
00:47:13,905 --> 00:47:15,338
Looking good.

682
00:47:15,941 --> 00:47:17,568
Oh, look at those tits.

683
00:47:20,812 --> 00:47:22,040
Yum-yum.

684
00:47:24,516 --> 00:47:27,713
You want to pay off the debt?
With what?

685
00:47:27,919 --> 00:47:30,217
Let's say l won the lottery, Ramon.

686
00:47:30,422 --> 00:47:33,414
And l want to buy your farm from you.

687
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:36,116
What do you mean,
you want to buy my farm?

688
00:47:36,328 --> 00:47:37,556
l don't have no farm.

689
00:47:37,763 --> 00:47:41,665
Oh, yes, you do, Ramon.
l know all about it.

690
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:44,559
Okay.

691
00:47:45,103 --> 00:47:48,539
You won the lottery, you can
pay me $3000 an acre.

692
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,971
Two. You'll be paid
direct from Europe.

693
00:47:52,177 --> 00:47:55,203
l've made the necessary arrangements.

694
00:48:01,386 --> 00:48:04,253
You won't mind if l deduct
your tailoring bill?

695
00:48:09,995 --> 00:48:11,963
lt has a bad smell.

696
00:48:12,497 --> 00:48:14,055
That would be the fish.

697
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:20,799
l'll pay you back.
l'm going to straighten out.

698
00:48:21,573 --> 00:48:24,667
Just don't resent me
for doing you a favor.

699
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:32,310
Harry, this is Panama, where no
good deed goes unpunished.

700
00:49:11,923 --> 00:49:13,083
Right.

701
00:49:14,392 --> 00:49:17,327
There's two ways we can deal
with this one, old girl.

702
00:49:17,529 --> 00:49:20,930
Sweat it out for six months,
then fall into each other's arms:

703
00:49:21,132 --> 00:49:23,930
''Darling, why didn't we ever
do this before?''

704
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:27,366
Method B, the preferred one:

705
00:49:27,572 --> 00:49:30,735
Full-on affair now.
Observing tight security all round.

706
00:49:30,942 --> 00:49:34,036
See how we like it.
lf we don't, no one's the wiser.

707
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:39,081
l don't suppose it's occurred to you
that l might prefer someone else?

708
00:49:43,154 --> 00:49:44,212
ls that a no?

709
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,284
No.

710
00:49:52,297 --> 00:49:53,958
Come and dance.

711
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,762
Oh, God, you don't dance as well,
do you?

712
00:49:58,803 --> 00:50:00,293
As well as what?

713
00:51:33,498 --> 00:51:37,229
My chaps in London are in a bit
of a spin about it.

714
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,767
l understand they're talking
to Washington.

715
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:43,600
lf the canal's being sold out,
how come we never got a whisper of it?

716
00:51:43,808 --> 00:51:45,867
l'm sure the question
is being asked...

717
00:51:46,077 --> 00:51:48,807
...and not to your credit, Nigel,
as political officer.

718
00:51:49,014 --> 00:51:50,140
What about the Americans?

719
00:51:50,348 --> 00:51:53,840
They've got billions in
surveillance. They don't know?

720
00:51:54,052 --> 00:51:57,112
Perhaps they do know about it,
but they're not telling us.

721
00:51:58,757 --> 00:52:01,021
You're very quiet, Francesca.

722
00:52:01,226 --> 00:52:05,128
What are your feelings about
Andrew's amazing discoveries?

723
00:52:05,797 --> 00:52:08,231
Well, l couldn't possibly comment.

724
00:52:09,034 --> 00:52:11,935
No insight into the Osnard methods,
l'm afraid.

725
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,432
Try not to look so furtive, Harry.

726
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:45,660
-l'm feeling a little anxious.
-How do you think l feel?

727
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,098
-Something wrong?
-Yes.

728
00:52:47,305 --> 00:52:49,330
We bombed in Washington.
Sit down.

729
00:52:49,574 --> 00:52:53,203
The Yanks say we're talking through
our asses. No Silent Opposition.

730
00:52:53,411 --> 00:52:56,244
No conspiracy to sell off the canal.
No fuck-all.

731
00:52:56,448 --> 00:52:58,973
-They can't say that.
-They just said it.

732
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,248
The Buchan material
holds no credibility.

733
00:53:05,457 --> 00:53:08,085
No credibility equals no cash.

734
00:53:08,493 --> 00:53:11,894
Without the Yanks, London will
pull the entire project.

735
00:53:12,097 --> 00:53:15,658
-Why?
-Because in matters of intelligence...

736
00:53:15,867 --> 00:53:17,391
...as in most other matters...

737
00:53:17,602 --> 00:53:21,197
...merry England sucks
on the American hind tit.

738
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,636
lt's called,
''The special relationship.''

739
00:53:24,676 --> 00:53:29,113
Mickie will be very downcast, Andy.
So will Marta.

740
00:53:29,314 --> 00:53:32,772
What about us? We both had
a good thing going here.

741
00:53:33,518 --> 00:53:35,383
l was counting on making a pension.

742
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,487
You thinking of retiring?

743
00:53:41,392 --> 00:53:43,417
Scrap heap at 45 in this game.

744
00:53:43,661 --> 00:53:46,289
lt was blue chip material.
You said so yourself.

745
00:53:46,498 --> 00:53:51,026
London needs something solid.
Documents, evidence.

746
00:53:52,637 --> 00:53:56,801
Does your wife bring home papers,
canal stuff?

747
00:53:57,308 --> 00:54:00,607
-What's that got to do with anything?
-Does she? That's all.

748
00:54:00,812 --> 00:54:02,006
lt happens.

749
00:54:07,685 --> 00:54:09,312
Take a look up its skirt.

750
00:54:16,094 --> 00:54:18,221
Come here. Come here.
Give it back.

751
00:54:20,231 --> 00:54:21,425
lt's a camera.

752
00:54:23,334 --> 00:54:27,828
One picture's worth a thousand words.
Or a thousand bucks. Tell her that.

753
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,003
-Tell her?
-Why not?

754
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:31,698
Put her on the payroll.
Double your money.

755
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:35,639
l want something in writing on
Delgado's dealings with the Chinese.

756
00:54:35,847 --> 00:54:37,007
No more bullshit.

757
00:54:37,215 --> 00:54:39,809
Louisa would never betray Delgado.

758
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:41,383
She worships the man.

759
00:54:42,854 --> 00:54:44,321
Does she know where you're at?

760
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,017
Not an inkling.

761
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:49,322
Ever tell her about your prison days?

762
00:54:49,527 --> 00:54:50,551
Not as such.

763
00:54:50,762 --> 00:54:52,286
Haul her in, Harry...

764
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:55,864
...or l might have to tell her
about Harry Pendel, the criminal.

765
00:54:56,067 --> 00:54:57,830
You stay away from her.

766
00:55:02,273 --> 00:55:04,173
Okay, l'll handle it.

767
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,713
You're rather tense tonight, Lou.

768
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:20,387
Maybe because you're peering
over my shoulder again.

769
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,093
Or maybe because l had a call
from Donna.

770
00:55:25,797 --> 00:55:26,627
Donna?

771
00:55:27,065 --> 00:55:28,225
Teddy's wife.

772
00:55:30,568 --> 00:55:33,696
She said you were seen coming
out of the Hotel Paraiso.

773
00:55:35,073 --> 00:55:39,601
l said, ''Harry's a tailor. He has
clients from all walks of life.''

774
00:55:41,045 --> 00:55:42,103
True.

775
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,814
You'd never meet them
at the Hotel Paraiso.

776
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:48,852
l had a fitting with Andy.
Andy Osnard.

777
00:55:49,053 --> 00:55:50,384
He's a bit eccentric.

778
00:55:51,522 --> 00:55:53,046
Are you seeing someone?

779
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,483
Me?

780
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:01,958
You stay out late
and you don't say where.

781
00:56:04,335 --> 00:56:07,771
You come at me like a lover and
then you don't touch me for weeks.

782
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:11,665
What's going on, Harry?

783
00:56:12,677 --> 00:56:14,304
Who's getting the rest of you?

784
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,013
Uncle Benny, l'm cornered.

785
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,815
There's nothing for it
but to tell her the truth.

786
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:21,842
She deserves the truth.

787
00:56:22,053 --> 00:56:24,544
Harry-boy, l've told you
time and again:

788
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,419
A man who tells the truth is bound
to be found out sooner or later.

789
00:56:28,626 --> 00:56:31,151
Try sincerity, that's a virtue.

790
00:56:31,362 --> 00:56:34,024
But truth, it's an affliction.

791
00:56:34,232 --> 00:56:36,257
l swear to you on my life...

792
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:38,967
...there's no other woman.

793
00:56:40,405 --> 00:56:43,499
Never has been. Never will be.

794
00:56:46,711 --> 00:56:47,837
Okay.

795
00:56:56,654 --> 00:56:58,053
Louisa?

796
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,132
l'm a thief in my own home.

797
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:48,601
But with best intentions.
With a good heart.

798
00:57:49,073 --> 00:57:51,667
For the family.
Like you did forme.

799
00:57:51,876 --> 00:57:53,002
That's true.

800
00:57:53,211 --> 00:57:55,338
You're the apple ofmy eye, Harry.

801
00:57:55,546 --> 00:57:59,107
Stay shtum, and l'll
always be there foryou.

802
00:58:00,885 --> 00:58:02,853
Harry. Harry!

803
00:58:07,158 --> 00:58:08,284
l couldn't sleep.

804
00:58:09,727 --> 00:58:13,026
What do you mean you couldn't sleep?
You were just out cold.

805
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:16,724
Busy times at the shop, Lou.

806
00:58:17,668 --> 00:58:20,034
So who is this Andy Osnard?

807
00:58:20,638 --> 00:58:23,971
-Tell me about him.
-He's become a bit of a pal...

808
00:58:24,342 --> 00:58:25,309
...as such.

809
00:58:26,811 --> 00:58:28,745
l used to be your pal...

810
00:58:28,946 --> 00:58:30,243
...''as such.''

811
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:32,941
l'd like to meet him.

812
00:58:33,151 --> 00:58:35,619
Why don't you invite him on Sunday?

813
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,215
That's Sarah's birthday.

814
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,148
Why not?

815
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:42,990
l could look into it.

816
00:58:43,494 --> 00:58:45,962
lf you don't want to call him,
l'll call him.

817
00:58:47,765 --> 00:58:48,663
Good.

818
00:59:05,983 --> 00:59:08,315
--and this season's suits
are very thin...

819
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:10,783
...and it's lined with Panama's
best fabric.

820
00:59:19,397 --> 00:59:20,557
Buchan.

821
00:59:20,832 --> 00:59:23,801
Lady Jane's. Twenty minutes.
That's two-zero minutes.

822
00:59:24,502 --> 00:59:25,764
Over and out.

823
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:14,213
He's been waiting and complaining.

824
01:00:14,552 --> 01:00:19,046
Sorry, Teddy. Jacket's ready.
Just pop into the fitting room.

825
01:00:24,462 --> 01:00:26,259
Sorry, Jaime, l need this.

826
01:00:31,903 --> 01:00:33,461
ln you go, Teddy.

827
01:00:39,243 --> 01:00:41,370
Wow! Even better than l thought.

828
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:44,013
You look like Bobby De Niro
in this jacket.

829
01:00:44,215 --> 01:00:47,412
Don't schmooze me, Harry.
What's going on?

830
01:00:47,618 --> 01:00:50,280
Little bird tells me
you paid off your overdraft.

831
01:00:50,488 --> 01:00:52,115
Business is good, Teddy.

832
01:00:52,323 --> 01:00:54,154
l smell a story.

833
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:55,723
There's no story.

834
01:00:56,594 --> 01:00:58,687
You want me to make one up?

835
01:00:58,896 --> 01:01:01,023
Don't. Louisa reads
your gossip column.

836
01:01:01,232 --> 01:01:03,223
l don't want her to know
l owed money.

837
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:05,265
Come clean.

838
01:01:05,836 --> 01:01:07,895
Probably won't run it.

839
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:11,967
l'm like that. The more l know,
the less l print.

840
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:19,046
You know l'll find out
what you're up to...

841
01:01:19,984 --> 01:01:21,212
...don't you?

842
01:01:48,112 --> 01:01:50,376
Well, l had absolutely no idea...

843
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,674
...how delightful
Panama was gonna be.

844
01:01:52,883 --> 01:01:55,283
Yes, it's beautiful country.

845
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,213
l was thinking about the people.

846
01:01:59,457 --> 01:02:02,893
Meant a lot to me,
being able to tag along today.

847
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,722
lt's been a real pleasure
to have you along, Andy.

848
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,158
Hasn't it, darling?

849
01:02:08,032 --> 01:02:10,091
Can we go and see the monkeys, Dad?

850
01:02:10,635 --> 01:02:11,829
There's a monkey island.

851
01:02:12,036 --> 01:02:14,004
-We bring bananas for them.
-Wonderful.

852
01:02:14,205 --> 01:02:16,935
-What's my birthday girl say?
-Can Andy come too?

853
01:02:17,141 --> 01:02:20,770
No, Andy needs to stay here
and keep Mommy company.

854
01:02:20,978 --> 01:02:22,377
You go with Dad.

855
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,278
ln you go.

856
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:34,185
Cast off, captain.

857
01:02:40,464 --> 01:02:41,897
So, Andy...

858
01:02:42,266 --> 01:02:45,235
...maybe you wouldn't mind
telling me what you're up to.

859
01:02:48,506 --> 01:02:49,530
Sorry?

860
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:54,210
There's something between you and my
husband, l know it. l can feel it.

861
01:02:55,212 --> 01:02:59,308
Ever since he's met you, he's
a changed man. Sneaky and secretive.

862
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:06,351
All of a sudden, l'm his enemy
and you're his friend.

863
01:03:09,126 --> 01:03:12,220
lf l didn't know him better,
l'd say you two were gay.

864
01:03:18,235 --> 01:03:20,169
Do you want it straight?

865
01:03:22,406 --> 01:03:23,532
Always.

866
01:03:23,908 --> 01:03:25,375
You'll keep it secret?

867
01:03:27,044 --> 01:03:28,033
lf l have to.

868
01:03:31,549 --> 01:03:35,212
And he's told you nothing?
Absolutely nothing?

869
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:36,981
Zero.

870
01:03:38,222 --> 01:03:40,452
lnformation is my business. Gossip.

871
01:03:40,658 --> 01:03:42,250
Harry's kind of gossip.

872
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,690
He's smart, he's down-to-earth.

873
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:47,022
He's got great contacts and no agenda.

874
01:03:47,498 --> 01:03:49,625
Are you talking about spying?

875
01:03:50,234 --> 01:03:54,193
Oh, that's much too heavy a word
for what Harry's doing.

876
01:03:55,406 --> 01:03:59,365
-Are you paying him?
-No money, l'm afraid.

877
01:03:59,577 --> 01:04:01,943
Just the honor
and privilege of service.

878
01:04:04,482 --> 01:04:08,213
ls that why he's been looking
at all my private papers?

879
01:04:08,986 --> 01:04:11,147
Oh, no. Harry.

880
01:04:11,756 --> 01:04:12,950
Oh, bless him.

881
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:16,257
That really is going too far.

882
01:04:18,162 --> 01:04:20,289
Spying on his own wife.

883
01:04:24,435 --> 01:04:25,766
l'm terribly sorry.

884
01:04:28,205 --> 01:04:31,368
Still, you are the canal, aren't you?

885
01:04:31,575 --> 01:04:34,544
You sit at Ernie Delgado's right hand.

886
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:39,072
Harry's aware that we're desperate
to know what will become of it.

887
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:44,619
The canal is always gonna run
the way it's run.

888
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:48,420
Ernie Delgado will make sure of it.

889
01:04:48,626 --> 01:04:50,116
That's as may be...

890
01:04:51,362 --> 01:04:53,057
...but it's our main artery.

891
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,290
You can't blame us if we need
constant reassurance.

892
01:04:59,003 --> 01:05:00,937
Harry's only trying to help.

893
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,068
Don't...

894
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,209
...use him.

895
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,311
l love him.

896
01:05:11,348 --> 01:05:13,213
As we both do.

897
01:05:14,084 --> 01:05:15,608
l'm going for a swim.

898
01:05:18,189 --> 01:05:19,156
-There's one.
-Where?

899
01:05:19,356 --> 01:05:20,323
-Up there.
-Oh, yeah!

900
01:05:20,524 --> 01:05:22,321
Oh, he's lovely!

901
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,727
So....

902
01:05:30,935 --> 01:05:34,234
Tell me,
how did Harry win your heart?

903
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,605
l was raised in the canal...

904
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:41,640
...around military types
and engineers like my father...

905
01:05:41,846 --> 01:05:44,212
...and l had never met anyone
like Harry.

906
01:05:44,415 --> 01:05:46,679
He treated me like a princess.

907
01:05:47,718 --> 01:05:49,413
Sent me flowers every day.

908
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:51,087
Wrote me love letters.

909
01:05:51,288 --> 01:05:55,247
Did he have to get
Arthur Braithwaite's permission?

910
01:05:56,060 --> 01:06:00,258
He called him in London.
He was on his deathbed, the poor man.

911
01:06:00,464 --> 01:06:01,829
Oh, God.

912
01:06:03,534 --> 01:06:05,695
Did he fly over for the funeral?

913
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:08,028
Arthur forbade it.

914
01:06:08,539 --> 01:06:11,997
Harry was completely wiped out.

915
01:06:12,543 --> 01:06:14,306
l'm sure he was.

916
01:06:24,221 --> 01:06:28,920
So the two of you have lived
happily ever after ever since?

917
01:06:31,428 --> 01:06:33,453
Yeah, until you came along.

918
01:06:35,966 --> 01:06:37,661
Don't you ever feel like...

919
01:06:38,569 --> 01:06:40,230
...breaking out?

920
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,601
Running wild...

921
01:06:45,609 --> 01:06:47,634
...just for the badness?

922
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,143
Never.

923
01:06:53,817 --> 01:06:55,808
Harry is my virtue.

924
01:06:57,788 --> 01:06:59,085
Without him...

925
01:07:01,592 --> 01:07:02,820
...l'd be....

926
01:07:03,027 --> 01:07:04,426
You'd be...

927
01:07:05,262 --> 01:07:07,856
...like Harry without
Arthur Braithwaite.

928
01:07:22,046 --> 01:07:24,446
Well, she's finally asleep.

929
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:28,450
l think she enjoyed her day.

930
01:07:28,986 --> 01:07:30,578
Yeah, l think so too.

931
01:07:36,126 --> 01:07:37,457
And did you?

932
01:07:38,028 --> 01:07:40,519
Yeah. Kind of.

933
01:07:41,398 --> 01:07:43,730
What did you and Andy
find to talk about?

934
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:47,369
You, mostly.

935
01:07:47,738 --> 01:07:49,933
Bit of a boring topic, wasn't it?

936
01:07:51,008 --> 01:07:54,967
You're a very surprising person,
Harry Pendel.

937
01:07:56,313 --> 01:07:58,577
After all these years?

938
01:07:59,717 --> 01:08:02,277
Just don't come between me
and Ernie Delgado.

939
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,019
My work is off-limits.
Do you understand?

940
01:08:06,223 --> 01:08:08,555
Okay, Lou. Absolutely.

941
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:10,320
Done.

942
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,498
Harry.

943
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,295
What?

944
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:26,204
Make me laugh.

945
01:08:35,753 --> 01:08:38,187
-You've got a gift for it.
-What?

946
01:08:40,057 --> 01:08:41,217
Letting go.

947
01:08:42,393 --> 01:08:46,454
-Few people can.
-You can't, or won't.

948
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,323
No.

949
01:08:48,966 --> 01:08:53,096
-l've been reading your files.
-Oh, those fucking files.

950
01:08:54,872 --> 01:08:57,306
We know too much about each other.

951
01:08:58,842 --> 01:09:00,776
Kills the romance.

952
01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:02,711
What romance?

953
01:09:03,447 --> 01:09:06,314
Oh, shit! Shit.

954
01:09:09,887 --> 01:09:10,945
Yes?

955
01:09:11,622 --> 01:09:13,681
Yeah. What?

956
01:09:15,059 --> 01:09:16,959
lt's a bit of a bad time, actually.

957
01:09:17,761 --> 01:09:20,093
l didn't know what she knew,
did l?

958
01:09:22,066 --> 01:09:24,933
Well, l'm sure you handled it
like a master.

959
01:09:25,969 --> 01:09:29,166
Look-- Hey, l had to think
on my feet, didn't l?

960
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,038
All right.

961
01:09:31,842 --> 01:09:33,332
All right, if you must.

962
01:09:34,912 --> 01:09:36,504
Rendezvous number three.

963
01:09:37,848 --> 01:09:41,079
You know where that is, don't you?
Oh, good.

964
01:09:41,752 --> 01:09:43,720
Twenty-three hundred hours.
Good.

965
01:09:45,889 --> 01:09:49,347
What warrants dragging me out of
the saddle on a Sunday night, eh?

966
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,549
Look, about Louisa.

967
01:09:50,761 --> 01:09:54,288
Some woman, Harry. l envy you.
The way she looks up to you.

968
01:09:54,498 --> 01:09:56,830
You're her moral virtue, her center.

969
01:09:57,034 --> 01:10:00,299
Just like Arthur Braithwaite
was to you, is what she said.

970
01:10:00,804 --> 01:10:02,169
l enjoyed the comparison.

971
01:10:02,372 --> 01:10:03,999
-You say anything?
-Would l ever?

972
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:07,075
Expect me to tell her that
an old Jew brought me up?

973
01:10:07,277 --> 01:10:09,245
Burned his frocks as a favor?

974
01:10:09,446 --> 01:10:11,107
Hated the old fellow, did you?

975
01:10:11,315 --> 01:10:15,115
-l know this place where we can talk.
-l loved him. l revere him.

976
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:18,686
Dressed him up as Arthur Braithwaite.
Gave him a good suit.

977
01:10:18,889 --> 01:10:21,380
''Clothes maketh the man,''
and all that.

978
01:10:51,922 --> 01:10:55,016
Come on, let's dance.
Camp it up a bit.

979
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,940
Come on. l'll lead.

980
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:23,442
So, l gather you've made
no attempt to recruit her so far.

981
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,986
As of now, that is correct.

982
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:28,283
Seemed perfectly approachable to me.

983
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:31,723
-Thought l'd have a go at her myself.
-No, don't do that.

984
01:11:32,629 --> 01:11:35,154
ls this what you came to tell me?
Lay off her?

985
01:11:35,365 --> 01:11:37,663
l came to tell you
l've had enough.

986
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:38,831
l want out.

987
01:11:39,036 --> 01:11:42,767
l don't think so. You've taken
the money, l want something for it.

988
01:11:43,407 --> 01:11:44,874
Those documents.

989
01:11:45,075 --> 01:11:47,669
Those ones that you snapped.
Did you read them?

990
01:11:47,878 --> 01:11:51,314
-l was pushed for time, Andy.
-Pension scheme for lock-keepers.

991
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:54,348
Dredging contract.
Water analysis. Zilch.

992
01:11:54,551 --> 01:11:57,111
Time to deliver.
l'm tired of your bullshit.

993
01:11:57,321 --> 01:11:58,754
l can't go on with it!

994
01:11:59,456 --> 01:12:01,287
You want me to tell Louisa...

995
01:12:01,491 --> 01:12:03,288
...about Harry the convict?

996
01:12:07,831 --> 01:12:09,765
Will you tell me what you want?

997
01:12:10,133 --> 01:12:11,157
Come here.

998
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:14,466
Keep moving. Stop acting so butch.

999
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:20,176
lf the canal's being flogged off
on presidential instructions...

1000
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:24,313
...what's the price? Who's the buyer?
When do they sign the contract?

1001
01:12:24,514 --> 01:12:28,280
How much are Delgado and the pres
creaming off for themselves?

1002
01:12:28,485 --> 01:12:29,952
-Right.
-Can't hear you.

1003
01:12:30,153 --> 01:12:32,314
-Right.
-Then there's your end of the bargain.

1004
01:12:32,522 --> 01:12:36,754
Abraxas, the Silent Opposition.
Are they going for direct action?

1005
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,123
-Direct action being in this case?
-Shootibangs.

1006
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:42,491
Raising proletarian consciousness.

1007
01:12:42,699 --> 01:12:45,463
Bombing banks, gunning down
a couple millionaires.

1008
01:12:45,669 --> 01:12:49,469
-No, not Mickie, not Marta.
-So, what the fuck are they doing?

1009
01:12:49,673 --> 01:12:53,439
Who are they buying arms from?
What are they gonna do with them?

1010
01:12:53,644 --> 01:12:56,408
They'll have to do more than
wear white shirts...

1011
01:12:56,613 --> 01:12:59,514
...and get the shit beaten
out of them by the dingbats!

1012
01:12:59,716 --> 01:13:01,616
-Come on.
-l've got to get out.

1013
01:13:01,818 --> 01:13:03,445
l can't think.

1014
01:13:04,054 --> 01:13:06,318
-l can't breathe.
-Go, Harry. Go, go, go.

1015
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:13,188
Get me some answers.
Your ass is on the line.

1016
01:13:13,397 --> 01:13:16,161
London's coming.
Get the stuff, we make you rich.

1017
01:13:16,366 --> 01:13:19,767
You don't, we tell the Pans
you've been spying for the Yanks.

1018
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:23,167
You and Louisa both.
Do you understand what l'm saying?

1019
01:13:32,582 --> 01:13:34,516
l haven't come clean with you.

1020
01:13:35,419 --> 01:13:37,319
l've been dragging my feet.

1021
01:13:37,688 --> 01:13:39,747
At Mickie's behest, l might add.

1022
01:13:40,824 --> 01:13:43,418
He has a huge arms shipment
on the way.

1023
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:46,027
But he'll pay for it
from another source.

1024
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:49,255
Oh, yeah? Who the fuck would that be?

1025
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:50,797
Won't say.

1026
01:13:51,201 --> 01:13:53,101
No, he wouldn't, would he?

1027
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:56,397
-How much?
-lt's big money, Andy.

1028
01:13:56,606 --> 01:13:59,632
''Harry,'' he says to me,
''your guys pay peanuts.

1029
01:13:59,843 --> 01:14:01,470
This is out of their league.''

1030
01:14:02,579 --> 01:14:03,705
Well...

1031
01:14:04,915 --> 01:14:07,679
...this is an interesting
development, Harry.

1032
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:10,786
-Give me a ballpark figure.
-Ten.

1033
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,684
We're talking
ten million dollars, Andy.

1034
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:15,380
Ten million dollars?

1035
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:17,148
Yeah.

1036
01:14:17,861 --> 01:14:20,455
Ten million dollars.

1037
01:14:23,266 --> 01:14:24,563
Yeah.

1038
01:14:33,944 --> 01:14:35,605
-Andrew.
-Sir.

1039
01:14:35,812 --> 01:14:38,042
The winds of fortune
blew me to Caracas...

1040
01:14:38,248 --> 01:14:41,740
...allowing me this brief stopover.
l'm on my way to Washington.

1041
01:14:41,952 --> 01:14:46,355
Our revered leader, Henry Cavendish,
is coming too. Pick up the phone.

1042
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:48,490
There's prestige at stake, you see.

1043
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:49,556
Oh, Andrew...

1044
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:54,556
...l've come all this way to look
you in the eye and ask you this:

1045
01:14:54,765 --> 01:14:59,031
Can you back it up?
Are we copper-bottomed?

1046
01:15:00,404 --> 01:15:01,666
Yes.

1047
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,276
-How much are they asking for?
-Fifteen million.

1048
01:15:07,811 --> 01:15:09,073
Fifteen.

1049
01:15:09,913 --> 01:15:12,711
lf l get it for you,
can you guarantee action?

1050
01:15:13,016 --> 01:15:14,381
Oh, absolutely.

1051
01:15:14,584 --> 01:15:16,051
Go after them, Andrew.

1052
01:15:16,253 --> 01:15:20,087
Push. The iron is hot.
Strike!

1053
01:15:24,094 --> 01:15:27,393
Sir, can l have your glass?
We are ready for landing.

1054
01:15:30,467 --> 01:15:31,661
Thank you.

1055
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:44,642
Oh, Harry. l hear that Delgado...

1056
01:15:44,848 --> 01:15:47,908
...is setting up a canal
police force...

1057
01:15:48,118 --> 01:15:50,177
...with powers to search the ships.

1058
01:15:50,387 --> 01:15:55,723
lt'll never happen. lt would kill
the drug trade, the arms trade...

1059
01:15:55,959 --> 01:15:58,120
...everything we hold dear.

1060
01:15:58,528 --> 01:16:01,190
The way it is now,
you pay your dues...

1061
01:16:01,398 --> 01:16:04,993
...you don't piss in the locks,
they don't fuck with you.

1062
01:16:05,202 --> 01:16:08,467
Does Louisa know anything
about this little plan, Harry?

1063
01:16:08,672 --> 01:16:10,230
Leave Louisa out of this.

1064
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:14,740
Take it easy, Harry.
Time you took some holiday.

1065
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:18,846
-You look fucked out.
-Maybe if you paid your bill...

1066
01:16:19,049 --> 01:16:21,745
-...l might be able to.
-Maybe you'd be healthier...

1067
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,681
...if you stuck to tailoring.

1068
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:26,218
-Listen, Teddy--
-Hey, Harry.

1069
01:16:26,857 --> 01:16:28,347
lt doesn't look right.

1070
01:16:28,558 --> 01:16:30,719
This isn't a suit,
it's a piece of shit.

1071
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:35,264
Come on, it's the first fitting.
lt can be fixed.

1072
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:37,831
l don't know.
Think l'm gonna go to Armani.

1073
01:16:38,168 --> 01:16:40,159
Get myself a proper suit.

1074
01:16:42,873 --> 01:16:45,740
He doesn't like it when
l mention Armani.

1075
01:16:45,942 --> 01:16:48,035
Harry, why you make me this shit?

1076
01:16:48,245 --> 01:16:50,270
Why can't you make
a suit like Armani?

1077
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,243
Why can't l make
a suit like Armani?

1078
01:16:55,118 --> 01:16:57,882
You think Armani can make
a suit like Harry Pendel?

1079
01:16:58,121 --> 01:16:59,383
Why not?

1080
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:03,384
Okay, fuck off. Go down the road,
buy an Armani!

1081
01:17:03,593 --> 01:17:06,118
Save yourself $1 000,
see if l care!

1082
01:17:06,329 --> 01:17:09,264
At Pendel and Braithwaite
you get Savile Row tailoring...

1083
01:17:09,466 --> 01:17:11,593
...with 400 years of tradition
behind it.

1084
01:17:11,801 --> 01:17:14,463
Down the road you get an
ltalian gents' outfitter.

1085
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:17,367
lf you don't understand,
then save your money.

1086
01:17:17,574 --> 01:17:18,939
Hey, Harry, come on.

1087
01:17:19,543 --> 01:17:22,478
The whole country's
going down the plug hole!

1088
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,670
Nobody cares!

1089
01:17:24,881 --> 01:17:27,475
Someone's got to stand up
and be counted!

1090
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:31,484
Someone has to say, ''Here l am.
This is what l stand for!''

1091
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:33,713
lmpeccable standards and...

1092
01:17:33,924 --> 01:17:35,585
...and old-fashioned integrity!

1093
01:17:35,792 --> 01:17:38,625
And if you don't like it,
you can go down the road!

1094
01:17:39,062 --> 01:17:41,121
Gentlemen, you go down that road...

1095
01:17:41,331 --> 01:17:42,764
...you can never come back.

1096
01:17:42,966 --> 01:17:46,458
When you've gone down that road
it's over, it's curtains.

1097
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:49,070
And l'm not just talking about Panama!

1098
01:17:49,272 --> 01:17:52,332
l'm talking about
the whole human race.

1099
01:18:02,252 --> 01:18:04,686
You too. Get out.

1100
01:18:09,593 --> 01:18:12,061
Harry, l was only kidding, l swear.

1101
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:16,260
lt's just a sleeve.
l swear to God.

1102
01:18:24,007 --> 01:18:25,565
Teddy came to see Mickie.

1103
01:18:25,775 --> 01:18:29,643
He brought two goons with him.
Said they were Ministry of lnterior.

1104
01:18:29,846 --> 01:18:30,938
Teddy?

1105
01:18:31,214 --> 01:18:33,011
Of course, he's the worst.

1106
01:18:33,216 --> 01:18:35,343
They pay him, the ruling families.

1107
01:18:35,552 --> 01:18:37,782
He takes money to inform
on his friends.

1108
01:18:38,121 --> 01:18:40,180
They were asking around about us.

1109
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:42,348
They came to me too.

1110
01:18:43,226 --> 01:18:46,627
Thinks we're involved in a
political thing against the system.

1111
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:48,422
You know, like the old times.

1112
01:18:48,632 --> 01:18:51,100
-You and Marta?
-You and Mickie.

1113
01:18:51,301 --> 01:18:53,098
Why would they think that?

1114
01:18:53,536 --> 01:18:54,798
Maybe you know, Harry.

1115
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:59,069
l couldn't do it again.

1116
01:19:00,076 --> 01:19:03,637
No more prison.
They break you in there.

1117
01:19:04,814 --> 01:19:08,250
You got so much courage in life.
When it's gone, it's spent.

1118
01:19:09,419 --> 01:19:10,943
l got none left.

1119
01:19:11,154 --> 01:19:14,123
l know what you mean.
l've been there, l know.

1120
01:19:17,661 --> 01:19:18,958
And they came to you?

1121
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:24,425
Big Chinese guy.
The man who beat her before.

1122
01:19:25,268 --> 01:19:29,102
-What did they do to you?
-Nothing. They wanted information.

1123
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:33,970
lf l didn't give it to them, they'd
make me look the same, both sides.

1124
01:19:34,177 --> 01:19:36,873
-What information?
-About the two of you.

1125
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,173
How often you meet,
what you talk about.

1126
01:19:39,416 --> 01:19:43,113
l want you both to get out of town.
Take a holiday.

1127
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,311
There's a fireworks festival
in Guarare.

1128
01:19:46,523 --> 01:19:49,219
You love fireworks.
The address is on the label.

1129
01:19:49,426 --> 01:19:51,417
Pete Abuleira lent it to me.

1130
01:19:51,628 --> 01:19:53,357
What are you going to do?

1131
01:19:53,563 --> 01:19:54,996
Sort it out.

1132
01:19:55,732 --> 01:19:57,529
Talk to people l know.

1133
01:20:00,603 --> 01:20:02,468
Better we go in separate cars.

1134
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:03,866
l follow you later.

1135
01:20:04,074 --> 01:20:05,871
No more drinking now.

1136
01:20:07,577 --> 01:20:09,010
Thanks, Harry.

1137
01:20:09,612 --> 01:20:10,442
Take care.

1138
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:18,583
l never lied to you, Marta.
You know that.

1139
01:20:18,788 --> 01:20:22,349
l didn't tell you everything,
but what l told you was true.

1140
01:20:22,959 --> 01:20:27,089
There's only so many people you
can do that to. Tell the truth.

1141
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:30,190
Other people are different.
They need to be....

1142
01:20:30,433 --> 01:20:31,764
Tailored.

1143
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:33,829
Helped. Yes.

1144
01:20:35,138 --> 01:20:38,107
You flatter them. You make things up.

1145
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:41,336
They start believing you, Harry.

1146
01:20:41,611 --> 01:20:44,978
Their leading man is one
Michelangelo Abraxas.

1147
01:20:45,348 --> 01:20:48,647
Known to many, l am sure,
as the elusive Pimpernel...

1148
01:20:48,852 --> 01:20:52,913
...of the popularmovement
against General Manuel Noriega.

1149
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:55,657
Abraxas is a man
ofproven integrity...

1150
01:20:55,859 --> 01:20:58,054
...skilled in clandestine warfare.

1151
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:00,286
His second in command...

1152
01:21:00,497 --> 01:21:03,432
...but l submit his equal
in skill and resolution...

1153
01:21:03,633 --> 01:21:05,260
...is code name ''Marta.''

1154
01:21:05,668 --> 01:21:09,195
Another veteran of the
anti-Noriega resistance.

1155
01:21:09,706 --> 01:21:13,073
For cover purposes, she is
employed as accountant receptionist...

1156
01:21:13,276 --> 01:21:15,767
...by our own Panamanian head agent...

1157
01:21:15,979 --> 01:21:17,913
...the redoubtable Buchan.

1158
01:21:18,615 --> 01:21:21,675
lf l may say so, Elliot,
a ''Silent Opposition''...

1159
01:21:21,885 --> 01:21:23,910
...doesn't send radio messages.

1160
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,849
Half don't possess telephones.

1161
01:21:26,055 --> 01:21:29,149
Why else would they call
themselves silent?

1162
01:21:29,359 --> 01:21:31,554
They're a life-force, not an embassy.

1163
01:21:32,762 --> 01:21:34,093
Fishermen...

1164
01:21:35,398 --> 01:21:38,629
...small farmers, peasants,
have-nots, penniless students.

1165
01:21:38,835 --> 01:21:41,395
People we wouldn't
entertain in the woodshed.

1166
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:44,333
So why should we support them, Henry?

1167
01:21:44,541 --> 01:21:46,907
Because if we don't,
someone else will.

1168
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:50,807
Because the Silent Opposition is
the new Panama in the new millennium.

1169
01:21:51,147 --> 01:21:53,342
And getting in with these chaps...

1170
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:57,145
...is the sweetest, cheapest
way of saving the canal.

1171
01:21:57,754 --> 01:22:00,655
Do you think personally,
this Abraxas is...

1172
01:22:00,857 --> 01:22:03,451
...presidential material?

1173
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:04,490
Scotty.

1174
01:22:04,727 --> 01:22:07,696
Abraxas is world-class.
Courageous...

1175
01:22:07,897 --> 01:22:10,764
...unsullied, incorruptible.

1176
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:13,834
A man to dream of
when you're shaping nations.

1177
01:22:25,548 --> 01:22:29,245
But Abraxas can't go it alone.
He needs our support now.

1178
01:22:29,452 --> 01:22:31,443
lf U.S. military assistance
is guaranteed...

1179
01:22:31,654 --> 01:22:35,055
...Abraxas and his forces will
launch an attack on the government.

1180
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:39,489
They'll commandeer the radio stations
and the Canal Administration Office.

1181
01:22:39,696 --> 01:22:42,290
Subject, of course,
to advance payment...

1182
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:44,831
...for arms, equipment
and medical supplies.

1183
01:22:46,069 --> 01:22:47,195
How much?

1184
01:22:48,304 --> 01:22:51,501
The sort of money you boys
leave under the plate, Elliot.

1185
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:56,010
-How much?
-Twenty million dollars.

1186
01:22:59,482 --> 01:23:02,280
Elliot, may l say a couple
of words, please?

1187
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:06,417
l'm only a rookie at heart.

1188
01:23:06,623 --> 01:23:11,253
l don't know too much about the ins
and outs of politics, but l know this:

1189
01:23:11,494 --> 01:23:15,931
l was the last American
commander in Panama.

1190
01:23:16,466 --> 01:23:19,902
l had the task of taking
our men out of there.

1191
01:23:21,471 --> 01:23:23,632
Only retreat of my career.

1192
01:23:27,443 --> 01:23:29,104
Broke my heart.

1193
01:23:32,282 --> 01:23:36,241
There is a missing star
on our flag, gentlemen.

1194
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:42,085
Looks to me that God has
given us a second chance here.

1195
01:23:46,195 --> 01:23:47,423
Yes?

1196
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:51,059
Sir.

1197
01:23:55,638 --> 01:23:57,105
Encrypted.

1198
01:23:57,974 --> 01:24:00,238
lt went over like ninepins.

1199
01:24:00,443 --> 01:24:02,411
Asked for 20 and guess what?

1200
01:24:02,612 --> 01:24:04,910
They beat me down to 1 5.

1201
01:24:05,114 --> 01:24:06,547
l'm on my way.

1202
01:24:06,749 --> 01:24:08,182
Press play, Andy.

1203
01:24:09,686 --> 01:24:11,620
Teddy! Teddy!

1204
01:24:11,854 --> 01:24:13,947
Why are you hassling Mickie and Marta?

1205
01:24:14,157 --> 01:24:16,250
What are they up to this time, Harry?

1206
01:24:16,459 --> 01:24:19,860
What are you up to?
Spin me one of your stories.

1207
01:24:20,063 --> 01:24:21,860
You stay away from them or else.

1208
01:24:22,065 --> 01:24:25,000
How could you fuck
that faceless half-breed?

1209
01:24:29,038 --> 01:24:30,335
No, no. Relax.

1210
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,770
You're a disgrace to that suit, Teddy.

1211
01:24:34,277 --> 01:24:36,108
-Hey.
-Louisa.

1212
01:24:38,548 --> 01:24:40,914
-There's something l must tell you.
-Okay.

1213
01:24:41,184 --> 01:24:42,310
Lou.

1214
01:24:42,518 --> 01:24:45,351
-l need to talk to you.
-Okay.

1215
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:48,284
Hello?

1216
01:24:49,525 --> 01:24:50,958
Marta?

1217
01:24:51,194 --> 01:24:54,823
Yeah, it's Louisa. l can't hear you.

1218
01:24:58,568 --> 01:25:00,468
l'll get-- Okay.

1219
01:25:01,404 --> 01:25:02,496
lt's for you.

1220
01:25:11,014 --> 01:25:12,276
lt's me.

1221
01:25:13,082 --> 01:25:16,609
Oh, Harry. l need you. Please come.

1222
01:25:20,423 --> 01:25:22,152
lt's Mickie. He--

1223
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,354
Marta?

1224
01:25:31,868 --> 01:25:34,166
-l've gotta go.
-So it's Marta?

1225
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:37,396
-All this time, under my nose.
-No, you don't understand.

1226
01:25:37,607 --> 01:25:39,973
Oh, come on, Harry. Please.

1227
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:41,636
Be a man.

1228
01:25:41,978 --> 01:25:44,845
-Well, if you love her, go.
-Yes, l do love her.

1229
01:25:46,849 --> 01:25:48,908
But l've never made love to her.

1230
01:25:49,118 --> 01:25:50,710
Get out.

1231
01:25:51,654 --> 01:25:53,315
Get out!

1232
01:25:56,325 --> 01:25:57,587
Harry.

1233
01:25:59,996 --> 01:26:01,054
Harry!

1234
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:16,375
Oh, shit!

1235
01:26:49,946 --> 01:26:52,676
Washington has agreed
that as we have the contacts...

1236
01:26:52,882 --> 01:26:56,147
...that we should undertake
the financing and arming...

1237
01:26:56,352 --> 01:26:58,252
...of the Silent Opposition.

1238
01:26:58,454 --> 01:27:02,083
And it's been agreed that that task
be undertaken by an older hand.

1239
01:27:02,291 --> 01:27:06,819
By myself, in fact. And on
a more formal basis than hitherto.

1240
01:27:07,463 --> 01:27:10,728
l dare say that'll come
as a bit of a relief to you, Andrew.

1241
01:27:10,933 --> 01:27:13,128
Equipping an army, tedious business.

1242
01:27:13,336 --> 01:27:16,328
Not the sort of task
for your mercurial brain.

1243
01:27:16,539 --> 01:27:19,167
Best left to us humble
planners and plodders, eh?

1244
01:27:19,876 --> 01:27:24,245
lt's fine in principle, Scotty.
Just one snag.

1245
01:27:24,547 --> 01:27:26,378
They won't talk to anyone but me.

1246
01:27:28,184 --> 01:27:30,709
l think you'll find that,
however shy they are...

1247
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:33,047
...they'll talk to a candid friend...

1248
01:27:33,256 --> 01:27:35,747
...who has $1 5 million
to spend on them.

1249
01:27:36,492 --> 01:27:38,119
Wouldn't you say, ambassador?

1250
01:27:38,928 --> 01:27:42,022
You know, for quite a while
l was skeptical...

1251
01:27:42,231 --> 01:27:45,496
...about this extraordinarily
silent opposition.

1252
01:27:45,701 --> 01:27:50,729
And l always thought that Mickie
Abraxas was just a harmless drunk.

1253
01:27:51,207 --> 01:27:53,368
Funny how wrong you can be.

1254
01:27:54,877 --> 01:27:59,610
Andy may have a real problem conjuring
up one of these people for you.

1255
01:28:00,049 --> 01:28:03,382
Afraid so, Scotty.
You could put it like this:

1256
01:28:03,586 --> 01:28:07,522
lf you don't go through me,
there is no Silent Opposition.

1257
01:28:07,723 --> 01:28:09,918
lt doesn't do to be too possessive.

1258
01:28:10,126 --> 01:28:13,755
We must be brave and wean them off
the Osnard teat, my boy.

1259
01:28:14,397 --> 01:28:18,800
Might l offer myself
as a go-between, so to speak...

1260
01:28:19,001 --> 01:28:22,630
...to verify Andy's dispersal
of these funds?

1261
01:28:23,239 --> 01:28:25,935
Kind of you to offer, ambassador.
Perhaps so.

1262
01:28:26,142 --> 01:28:29,043
Meanwhile, Andrew can brief me
on the details.

1263
01:28:29,245 --> 01:28:31,179
We have a lot to catch up on, eh?

1264
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:34,543
Whiskey till the small hours
in the privacy of your abode...

1265
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:37,685
...is indicated for Osnard
and Luxmore, l believe.

1266
01:28:39,655 --> 01:28:41,714
-Sure.
-Excellent, gentlemen.

1267
01:28:41,924 --> 01:28:45,155
Andrew, l take it you have
a secure safe in your apartment?

1268
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:46,851
Absolutely, sir.

1269
01:28:47,129 --> 01:28:48,221
Fort Knox.

1270
01:28:48,431 --> 01:28:49,728
Ambassador.

1271
01:28:50,166 --> 01:28:51,531
l'll get my files.

1272
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:04,874
-You are getting out, aren't you?
-Possibly.

1273
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,777
Too early to say.

1274
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:09,684
You'll have to, won't you?

1275
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:12,821
l mean, there is no
Silent Opposition, is there?

1276
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,882
-Who told you that?
-You did, just now in the meeting.

1277
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,185
You made it all up, didn't you?

1278
01:29:22,465 --> 01:29:24,296
What are you talking about?

1279
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,731
l think you're the wickedest
human being l've ever met.

1280
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,201
That was the attraction, wasn't it?

1281
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:36,139
How about a farewell fuck?

1282
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:38,171
Here in the office.

1283
01:29:38,848 --> 01:29:40,338
A knee-trembler.

1284
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:46,187
You know, l think l'm cured.

1285
01:29:47,623 --> 01:29:51,423
Excuse me, Francesca.
A private word with Andrew.

1286
01:29:51,894 --> 01:29:53,418
He's all yours.

1287
01:29:56,299 --> 01:30:00,429
My duty is to inform
the Foreign Office of this...

1288
01:30:00,703 --> 01:30:02,102
...travesty.

1289
01:30:03,572 --> 01:30:05,164
How much is your duty worth?

1290
01:30:06,642 --> 01:30:07,870
-Two million.
-One.

1291
01:30:08,077 --> 01:30:09,601
-One and a half.
-One and a quarter.

1292
01:30:09,812 --> 01:30:11,006
Done.

1293
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:13,078
Andrew.

1294
01:30:13,549 --> 01:30:14,880
Good night.

1295
01:30:42,945 --> 01:30:47,348
You got a lovely little family, Harry.
Only one thing can spoil it.

1296
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:50,418
-What's that, Uncle Benny?
-The truth, Harry.

1297
01:30:50,619 --> 01:30:52,052
That's the honest truth.

1298
01:31:00,296 --> 01:31:01,820
Esmeralda?

1299
01:31:02,631 --> 01:31:03,620
Esmeralda.

1300
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:08,895
l'm going out. Watch the children.

1301
01:31:10,039 --> 01:31:11,700
Marta!

1302
01:31:17,346 --> 01:31:19,041
Marta!

1303
01:31:33,162 --> 01:31:35,357
Oh, God!

1304
01:31:35,998 --> 01:31:37,966
l'm not imposing on you, am l?

1305
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:40,601
You're not imposing
on me in the least.

1306
01:31:43,773 --> 01:31:45,001
Who the devil's that?

1307
01:31:53,516 --> 01:31:55,006
Buchan 2. We got trouble.

1308
01:31:55,217 --> 01:31:57,947
When l get her into
the other room, get out.

1309
01:31:58,154 --> 01:32:00,452
ln the lobby,
give the concierge a dollar.

1310
01:32:00,656 --> 01:32:03,784
He'll get you a taxi to
the El Panama Hotel. Get a room.

1311
01:32:03,993 --> 01:32:05,722
A taxi? At this time of night?

1312
01:32:05,928 --> 01:32:08,761
l don't speak Spanish, Andy.
l'm unarmed.

1313
01:32:08,964 --> 01:32:10,522
Life is cheap here.

1314
01:32:10,733 --> 01:32:13,930
You can handle it.
You're a field man, aren't you?

1315
01:32:14,737 --> 01:32:16,136
What about the bags?

1316
01:32:16,338 --> 01:32:19,000
l'll guard them with my life.
Believe me.

1317
01:32:44,834 --> 01:32:46,131
Louisa.

1318
01:32:47,303 --> 01:32:50,761
-Something on your mind?
-What the fuck have you done?

1319
01:32:51,073 --> 01:32:54,770
What is all this bullshit
about Abraxas and Delgado?

1320
01:32:54,977 --> 01:32:57,946
Don't worry. lt's nothing.
lt's crap. lt's all a game.

1321
01:32:58,147 --> 01:32:59,774
-Where's Harry?
-Harry's okay.

1322
01:32:59,982 --> 01:33:03,782
-l'm gonna take care of Harry and you.
-Get your fucking hands off me!

1323
01:33:03,986 --> 01:33:05,783
Get off me.

1324
01:33:09,358 --> 01:33:10,825
Relax.

1325
01:33:11,527 --> 01:33:13,722
We both know why you're here.

1326
01:33:19,034 --> 01:33:20,296
Yeah.

1327
01:33:20,603 --> 01:33:23,163
Shit! You....

1328
01:33:27,376 --> 01:33:29,708
What have you gotten Harry into?

1329
01:33:29,912 --> 01:33:33,712
Harry got himself into this
with his own ludicrous stories.

1330
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:38,450
When the Americans take back their
canal, it'll be down to him, not me.

1331
01:33:39,622 --> 01:33:40,646
When?

1332
01:33:41,757 --> 01:33:42,746
When?

1333
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:46,857
Get out of my way!

1334
01:33:50,533 --> 01:33:52,262
l killed him, Marta.

1335
01:33:52,468 --> 01:33:54,936
l killed him with my bullshit.

1336
01:33:55,804 --> 01:33:58,102
He said the police were after him.

1337
01:33:58,307 --> 01:33:59,569
He said:

1338
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:03,168
''Tell Harry l'm sorry.''

1339
01:34:03,445 --> 01:34:06,039
And l didn't finish his suit.

1340
01:34:06,882 --> 01:34:09,578
lt would've given him
back his dignity.

1341
01:34:10,219 --> 01:34:12,312
He wouldn't have shot himself in it.

1342
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:15,012
He was always going to do it.

1343
01:34:16,959 --> 01:34:20,156
He was just looking
for a good enough excuse.

1344
01:34:41,383 --> 01:34:43,283
Shall l close his eyes?

1345
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:58,033
You must go now, Harry.

1346
01:34:59,401 --> 01:35:00,493
Go, Harry.

1347
01:35:22,958 --> 01:35:23,947
Yep.

1348
01:35:24,293 --> 01:35:26,284
Harry, my man, where have you been?

1349
01:35:26,495 --> 01:35:30,693
Louisa was here. l think she thought
l was leading you astray or something.

1350
01:35:33,736 --> 01:35:34,998
Jesus.

1351
01:35:36,071 --> 01:35:38,039
l see. Go on.

1352
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:40,838
So we have to stop all this, you hear?

1353
01:35:41,377 --> 01:35:44,972
Mickie knew nothing about it.
You know and l know l made it all up.

1354
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:48,274
lt's too late for that, old boy.
Out of ourhands.

1355
01:35:48,884 --> 01:35:51,546
A case of life imitating art.

1356
01:36:06,769 --> 01:36:08,532
Bit of a setback, sir.

1357
01:36:08,737 --> 01:36:10,762
lt's Mickie Abraxas.

1358
01:36:11,273 --> 01:36:12,831
Bullet through the head.

1359
01:36:13,842 --> 01:36:14,900
Suicide.

1360
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:18,307
Setback? Setback? On the contrary.

1361
01:36:18,514 --> 01:36:22,006
No, they'll probably claim
he killed himself in police custody.

1362
01:36:22,217 --> 01:36:26,278
That's standard euphemism for
assassinations in regimes of this ilk.

1363
01:36:26,488 --> 01:36:28,820
No, no one's going
to swallow that one.

1364
01:36:29,024 --> 01:36:30,013
No.

1365
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:34,686
''Leader of the Democratic Rebel
Movement murdered.''

1366
01:36:34,897 --> 01:36:38,833
Yes. l think we could have
the peg we're looking for, Andy.

1367
01:36:39,034 --> 01:36:41,935
l'll inform ourAmerican cousins.
Now, tell me...

1368
01:36:42,137 --> 01:36:45,334
...did you manage to resolve
that Buchan 2 situation?

1369
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:49,773
l got the distinct impression
she was in a state ofhigh anxiety.

1370
01:36:49,978 --> 01:36:54,813
You must impress on your operatives
the importance ofstaying in control.

1371
01:36:55,017 --> 01:36:56,109
Andrew?

1372
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,226
Hello, is anybody there?
l must talk to the ambassador.

1373
01:37:14,436 --> 01:37:15,494
l'm English.

1374
01:37:15,704 --> 01:37:19,003
lt's a matter of grave importance.

1375
01:37:25,781 --> 01:37:29,217
Mickie Abraxas died three hours ago.

1376
01:37:29,418 --> 01:37:32,546
Executed by a government death squad.

1377
01:37:33,155 --> 01:37:35,419
l have informed the president.

1378
01:37:35,624 --> 01:37:38,184
He has authorized us to go on in.

1379
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:41,921
We have that right under the treaty
if the canal is threatened.

1380
01:37:42,731 --> 01:37:45,723
Operation Straight Arrow
is all yours, general.

1381
01:37:45,934 --> 01:37:47,697
How soon can you be operational?

1382
01:37:47,903 --> 01:37:50,997
-Give me four hours, sir.
-That fast?

1383
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:55,206
My rapid response units
are on full alert, sir.

1384
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:58,505
Carrier Alaska is
off the coast of Panama.

1385
01:37:58,714 --> 01:38:01,581
Eight F-22 Raptors are on alert.

1386
01:38:01,784 --> 01:38:05,345
Twelve gunships.
A battalion of marines.

1387
01:38:06,822 --> 01:38:10,121
-l've got to speak to the ambassador.
-The ambassador is busy.

1388
01:38:10,325 --> 01:38:12,225
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

1389
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:13,918
Ambassador.

1390
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,330
l am Buchan.

1391
01:38:16,632 --> 01:38:21,194
l made it all up. You've got
to stop it. You see, l'm Buchan.

1392
01:38:21,403 --> 01:38:24,372
l'm sorry, but aren't you
that tailor fellow?

1393
01:38:24,573 --> 01:38:25,904
You're rather upset.

1394
01:38:26,108 --> 01:38:28,975
-Nigel, please show the gentleman out.
-Yes.

1395
01:38:29,178 --> 01:38:31,874
There is no Silent Opposition!

1396
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:35,015
Someone's gotta blow the whistle.
Might as well be me.

1397
01:38:35,217 --> 01:38:39,244
You're a diplomat. Be diplomatic.
Can't interfere at this stage.

1398
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:42,322
lt would reflect very badly.
And what could we say?

1399
01:38:42,524 --> 01:38:47,461
That some deranged tailor Johnny
told us it was all a joke?

1400
01:38:47,663 --> 01:38:48,687
Nevertheless.

1401
01:38:54,636 --> 01:38:57,298
-Darling, what--?
-l need to talk to Ernesto.

1402
01:39:04,847 --> 01:39:05,677
Andy.

1403
01:39:14,923 --> 01:39:15,855
Andy!

1404
01:39:20,996 --> 01:39:22,088
Wait!

1405
01:39:34,743 --> 01:39:36,142
Oh, Harry.

1406
01:39:49,658 --> 01:39:52,456
Well, if the ambassador's
been recalled...

1407
01:39:52,661 --> 01:39:55,061
...give me somebody
who hasn't been recalled.

1408
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:58,392
His secretary, his butler, his--

1409
01:40:00,469 --> 01:40:02,096
Come with me, Louisa.

1410
01:40:03,171 --> 01:40:05,196
We're going to see the president.

1411
01:40:17,819 --> 01:40:19,286
Shit!

1412
01:40:23,926 --> 01:40:25,826
Oh, no, no, no.

1413
01:40:26,028 --> 01:40:28,462
Come on, come on, come on.

1414
01:41:10,739 --> 01:41:12,673
What the fuck do you want?

1415
01:41:12,874 --> 01:41:17,607
l want you to come back to the embassy
and tell them it's all a mistake!

1416
01:41:18,347 --> 01:41:21,839
Harry, l've got our money here.
Yours and mine.

1417
01:41:22,050 --> 01:41:24,883
l'm trying to get out
before they close the airport.

1418
01:41:25,087 --> 01:41:29,251
l'm going straight to Switzerland.
Open numbered accounts for both of us.

1419
01:41:29,558 --> 01:41:32,152
You'll be a rich man.
Just give me a lift.

1420
01:41:32,361 --> 01:41:34,386
-We're going back.
-Get out of my way!

1421
01:41:34,596 --> 01:41:38,293
-Are you not listening to me?
-Don't be bloody annoying, Harry!

1422
01:41:40,202 --> 01:41:43,035
Shit! They're here.

1423
01:42:06,028 --> 01:42:07,086
Ambassador!

1424
01:42:09,064 --> 01:42:13,160
Will you vouch for me, my credentials?
l need to get on a plane.

1425
01:42:13,368 --> 01:42:15,962
You wish for this man to be included?

1426
01:42:16,171 --> 01:42:18,139
l've never seen him before.

1427
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:21,740
Ambassador.

1428
01:42:25,881 --> 01:42:29,942
As you can see, the airport is closed,
but palms have been greased.

1429
01:42:30,152 --> 01:42:35,089
And once our arrangement
has been concluded...

1430
01:42:35,657 --> 01:42:37,648
...you'll be free to go.

1431
01:42:53,175 --> 01:42:57,635
lt is a fabrication, Mr. President.
A pack of lies, a travesty.

1432
01:42:57,846 --> 01:43:02,078
The canal is safe, secure.
Unthreatened.

1433
01:43:02,284 --> 01:43:04,309
Call off your dogs, sir.

1434
01:43:04,519 --> 01:43:06,180
Call them off.

1435
01:43:11,827 --> 01:43:13,886
l'll walk you to your plane.

1436
01:43:17,432 --> 01:43:20,401
Could this be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship?

1437
01:43:20,602 --> 01:43:23,264
l think it desperately unlikely.

1438
01:43:27,843 --> 01:43:31,074
Mission aborted. Return to base.

1439
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:45,285
Why?

1440
01:43:45,961 --> 01:43:47,519
l don't know.

1441
01:43:49,264 --> 01:43:50,891
l thought it was a game.

1442
01:43:51,099 --> 01:43:53,033
And behind my back?

1443
01:43:53,235 --> 01:43:56,102
All those lies about
the president and Delgado?

1444
01:43:56,571 --> 01:43:59,005
Oh, yes, the lies.

1445
01:43:59,975 --> 01:44:02,842
l'm very, very sorry about the lies.

1446
01:44:06,915 --> 01:44:08,177
Louisa....

1447
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:11,646
l never did work in Savile Row, did l?

1448
01:44:11,853 --> 01:44:13,320
Not as such.

1449
01:44:14,189 --> 01:44:16,487
l learned the tailoring in prison.

1450
01:44:17,159 --> 01:44:20,560
l burnt down my Uncle Benny's
warehouse to help him out.

1451
01:44:20,762 --> 01:44:22,787
And then, when l'd done my time...

1452
01:44:23,365 --> 01:44:26,232
...Uncle Benny,
he gives me my portion...

1453
01:44:27,202 --> 01:44:29,966
...sends me out here
so l can't get into trouble.

1454
01:44:31,239 --> 01:44:33,707
l pretended he was Arthur Braithwaite.

1455
01:44:39,181 --> 01:44:41,809
You see, lying's what
you do in prison, Lou.

1456
01:44:42,751 --> 01:44:44,878
lt's instead of love, really.

1457
01:44:45,287 --> 01:44:49,018
You tell it the way it should be
since that's better than how it is...

1458
01:44:49,224 --> 01:44:50,657
...when it's that bad.

1459
01:44:50,892 --> 01:44:52,382
lf you follow me.

1460
01:44:53,295 --> 01:44:55,991
Why didn't you just tell me
from the start?

1461
01:44:58,733 --> 01:45:01,998
Because l fell in love
with you, my princess.

1462
01:45:04,706 --> 01:45:07,539
And l knew that l wasn't
good enough for you.

1463
01:45:09,077 --> 01:45:10,635
Not as l stood.

1464
01:45:13,281 --> 01:45:16,011
Harry, you are such a fool.

1465
01:45:18,186 --> 01:45:22,680
Dad, you promised to tell me a story.
Where were you?

1466
01:45:23,558 --> 01:45:25,048
Oh, Sarah.

1467
01:45:25,927 --> 01:45:27,485
l'm so sorry.

1468
01:45:30,265 --> 01:45:33,029
No need to cry about it, Dad.

1469
01:45:34,269 --> 01:45:35,463
Hi, Dad.

1470
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:36,898
Hi, Mum.

1471
01:45:40,542 --> 01:45:42,601
So, what do you want me to do?

1472
01:45:44,946 --> 01:45:46,811
What do l want you to do?

1473
01:45:48,283 --> 01:45:49,875
What you always do.

1474
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:56,080
Make breakfast.

1475
01:45:59,427 --> 01:46:01,520
Can we have pancakes?

1476
01:46:03,431 --> 01:46:05,456
-Yeah.
-You want pancakes?

1477
01:46:06,134 --> 01:46:07,465
Breakfast?

1478
01:46:19,748 --> 01:46:23,684
Well, there's two ways we can deal
with this one, my dear.

1479
01:46:23,885 --> 01:46:24,943
Ready?

1480
01:46:30,058 --> 01:46:31,787
Hooray!
