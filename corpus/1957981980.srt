A little taste of home?

1080
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:03,689
I had the water brought in.

1081
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:09,260
It's as close to the real thing
as you can get.

1082
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:15,135
Hello, Daisy.

1083
01:16:28,671 --> 01:16:29,846
Do you remember me?

1084
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:33,240
Perhaps not.

1085
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,243
It's good to see you again.

1086
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:39,159
We've seen each other
in the past,

1087
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,770

1088
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:43,033

1090

Iris is very sick.

1091
01:16:54,218 --> 01:16:56,437
They want to whisk you away
to the islands

1092
01:16:56,829 --> 01:16:58,178
to save her, right?

1093
01:16:58,831 --> 01:17:01,138
She sacrificed so much
for all of us.

1094
01:17:04,576 --> 01:17:07,884
She is strong, loving, generous.

1095
01:17:08,058 --> 01:17:09,320
She's a fighter.

1096
01:17:09,494 --> 01:17:11,627
[chuckles] And rebellious, too.

1097
01:17:12,236 --> 01:17:13,498
Yes.

1098
01:17:14,064 --> 01:17:17,328
She is everything
you would want in a mother.

1099
01:17:27,425 --> 01:17:28,644
But the truth is...

1100
01:17:30,515 --> 01:17:32,038
the painful truth is...

1101
01:17:35,346 --> 01:17:38,697
Iris no longer serves
any real purpose in this world.

1102
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:41,700
Not to herself, not to you,

1103
01:17:42,092 --> 01:17:43,397
not to anybody.

1104
01:17:45,922 --> 01:17:49,534
And I think it's best
that we just let her slip away

1105
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:52,406
and get her much deserved rest.

1106
01:17:55,409 --> 01:17:57,063
I know it sounds cruel,

1107
01:17:57,455 --> 01:18:00,327
but if you're patient with me,
I'm sure you'll understand.

1109

1110
01:18:06,029 --> 01:18:08,509
Of course. She's...

1111
01:18:10,555 --> 01:18:12,035
11 years old.

1112

You came back for her
at the right moment.

1113
01:18:20,608 --> 01:18:22,349
I wish I'd done
the same for you.

1114
01:18:24,047 --> 01:18:26,614
I, too, abandoned
my daughter on day one.

1115
01:18:27,311 --> 01:18:28,704
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

1116

It's who we are.

1117
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,232
Zara, too, will do the same.

1118
01:18:36,059 --> 01:18:38,888
And she'll find a strong,
loving fighter of a mother

1119
01:18:39,062 --> 01:18:40,324
to raise her daughter

1120
01:18:40,498 --> 01:18:42,543
until she's ready to take over.

1121

a pattern by now.

1128

I came back too late.

1129
01:19:10,223 --> 01:19:12,617
And when I returned,
and I saw what happened...

1130
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:14,750
I couldn't help myself.

1131

confessed to the murder for me.

1136
01:19:32,245 --> 01:19:34,073
She knew I couldn't survive
in their prison.

1137
01:19:34,987 --> 01:19:38,034
But what she didn't know
is that they would turn around

1138
