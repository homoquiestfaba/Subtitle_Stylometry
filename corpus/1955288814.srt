1
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,741
Hey!

2
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,609
Hey.

3
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,846
Someone's still in bed.

4
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,652
Hey, babe,
what if we stay in

5
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:29,288
for dinner tonight
and I cook?

6
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,190
Just the two of us?

7
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,092
Man:
<i> Instead of going out?</i>

8
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,861
Yeah, sure.
Whatever you want.

9
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,529
Really?

10
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,398
That's cool.

11
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,668
I have chicken.

12
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,670
- I like chicken.

13
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,538
I'm a chicken man.

14
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,560
Woman:
<i> Hi, mom.</i>

15
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:44,296
Oh, how are you?

16
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,738
Mahjong?
You don't play mahjong,

17
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,939
do you?

18
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,381
I gotta go.
Let me call you
in a little bit.

19
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,849
All right,
i love you.

20
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,417
All right. Bye.

21
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,730
Rachel?

22
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,735
Rachel?

23
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,403
Rachel?

24
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,373
Oh, my god.
Rachel?

25
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,941
Oh, um.

26
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:13,318
Woman on TV:
<i> ...San Francisco private jet</i>
<i> to Georgia...</i>

27
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,681
Hey, man,
how's it going?

28
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,750
- Man:<i> Joshy called me. </i>
- Woman:<i> Is he okay?</i>

29
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,719
Do you remember

30
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,421
when I put
the deposit down

31
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:52,491
on that house in Ojai
for his bachelor party?

32
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:56,461
Well, I guess the person
that owns the house
called, uh, joshy,

33
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,664
and they were like,
"what are gonna do?"

34
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,800
- Right.
- So, um-- so then
he called me.

35
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,468
And was like,
"what do you wanna do?"

36
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,537
'Cause you can't get
the deposit back.

37
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:08,607
And he's like,
"well...

38
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,776
We have the house."

39
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:14,313
- Are you gonna go?
- Mm, I don't know.

40
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,619
Are you stoned?

41
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,478
Hey!

42
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,781
Hey, man.

43
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,551
- How are you?

44
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,119
How are you?

45
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,488
What?

46
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,390
What the fuck
was that?

47
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,559
Be careful!

48
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,010
I was saying
"how are you?" Before.

49
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:21,913
Yeah, yeah, I know.
It just-- it obviously
wasn't the best time.

50
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,382
Yeah.

51
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,619
Joshy!

52
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,531
Joshy?

53
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,172
Joshy?

54
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,476
Hmm.

55
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,484
Dude...

56
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,489
Don't touch it.
It's a fucking
sniper rifle.

57
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,125
It's a bb gun.
See?

58
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,727
It's loaded.

59
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,095
Goddamn right it is.

60
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,503
Man:
<i> Think about what it</i>
<i> would have been like</i>

61
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:21,139
<i> as a child in 1939</i>
<i> or 1964</i>

62
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,741
to get taken
by your parents

63
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,876
to the New York
world's fair, right?

64
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,779
<i> So they take you</i>
<i> to, I don't know, say,</i>
<i> the Chilean pavilion.</i>

65
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,181
And you're
smelling Chilean food
for the first time.

66
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:31,783
You've never even
seen it before.

67
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,485
- You're seeing people dressed
in traditional Chilean garb--

68
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,587
hey, guys.

69
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:39,458
Ari? Adam?

70
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,559
I'm Eric.

71
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,064
- Oh, hey, man.
- Oh, yes, dude.

72
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,732
So funny on
the reply alls, man.

73
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,167
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Oh, thanks, man.

74
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,470
I like to set
a little tone
over email

75
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,905
just to let people know
what kind of bro
they're gonna get.

76
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,775
- No, it was hilarious.
- For sure. Tone set.

77
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:59,010
I don't know if Joshua
gave you any background
on me,

78
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,679
but I live with him
in the same housing complex.

79
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,581
<i> Lived with him.</i>

80
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,684
But that's actually what
i think this weekend's
gonna be great for.

81
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:06,918
It's, like, just
cleansing the palate.

82
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,087
<i> Keep it light,</i>
<i> keep it fun.</i>

83
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,057
Yes, keeping it light,
i think, is Paramount.

84
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,092
You brought a bunch
of board games.
Awesome.

85
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,528
Yeah, this is kind of
the big one that I'm
looking forward to.

86
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,896
"Mecha dungeon crawl,"
have you seen this?

87
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,564
No.

88
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,666
It's a really big, long
complicated co-op game.

89
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,135
<i> That it'll take</i>
<i> a couple hours to</i>
<i> go through the directions.</i>

90
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:27,672
- So it's like "cranium"?
- No, it's not like "cranium."

91
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,641
It's a lot more
complicated than that.

92
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:30,942
More like
"apples to apples"?

93
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,777
No, it's not like that
at all either.

94
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,746
We got a portion of time
that will be perfect

95
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,015
for, like, these games.
Like, you and Josh
can do that.

96
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,917
- And, like, you and I can...
- Get high?

97
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,119
- Burn it up.
- I have a one-hitter.

98
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,821
Actually, do you guys mind
not doing that in here?

99
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,789
<i> You know, I just wanna</i>
<i> be able to come in here</i>

100
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,825
and get in bed
and sleep

101
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:49,194
and not have ash
and detritus

102
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,595
and paraphernalia
everywhere.

103
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,098
Okay, no detritus
in this room.

104
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,302
I'm a backpack hip-hop kid,
you know?

105
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,704
- Oh, of course. Uh-huh.
- J5, dilated peoples,

106
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,873
- like, everybody, you know?
- Yeah, I love
tribe called quest.

107
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,842
- Stone's throw.
- Yeah, stone's throw is cool.

108
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,176
But I also like t swift,
you know?

109
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,580
- Josh:<i> Hey! </i>
- Hey, Joshua!

110
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,181
Hey, Eric.
Oh, my god!

111
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,883
Holy shit.

112
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,920
Hey. Hi.
I'm katee.

113
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,955
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming, dude.

114
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,190
- Yeah, yeah, thanks...
- Heard so much about you.

115
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,726
How are you?
You okay?

116
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,228
I don't know who you are.
I like hugging you, though.

117
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,597
- I'm katee.
- So, uh,

118
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,132
are you, like,
the property manager here?

119
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,934
- No.
- Of the prop--
no, no.

120
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,236
- No, no.
- No, I'm just--
I'm katee.

121
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,673
- Yeah, katee from Ojai.
- Katee from Ojai.

122
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,908
- Friend from Ojai.
- Just met last night.

123
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,877
Do you wanna hang out?
We're gonna get into a Cypher.

124
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,346
- I should probably go.
- Okay.

125
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,181
But you have fun.

126
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,616
Have fun.

127
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,618
- I'll walk you to your car.
- Oh.

128
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,286
- Bye.
- Katee:<i> I'm so glad</i>
<i> I got to see you.</i>

129
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,159
- Um, yeah.
- Yeah.

130
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,099
She seemed
really cool, man.

131
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,068
- Who, katee?
- Mm-hmm.

132
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,204
Yeah, she was, she is.
She is very cool.

133
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,306
-<i> How did you meet her? </i>
- I got here yesterday.

134
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,208
-<i> Right. </i>
- So I was here
before anyone else,

135
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,345
and, uh,
i had nothing to do.

136
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:16,648
- So I went to
the bar in town.
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>

137
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,883
And I don't know.
I just, like,
was at the bar

138
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,218
and she came up to me,
starting chatting,

139
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,253
and it was, like,
super easy to talk to.

140
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,189
"It was." She was
super easy to talk to.

141
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,957
Good for you, man.
I'm really happy for you.

142
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,059
Well, look, she's cool.
She really is.

143
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,762
I mean, we're not gonna
get married or anything,
but...

144
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,333
Who else are we gonna
be able to celebrate

145
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,168
this, uh,
sexual victory with?

146
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,804
Yeah, when is
everybody else coming?

147
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,774
Um, this--

148
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,876
this is
actually the crew.

149
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,078
<i> Everybody else</i>
<i> kind of flaked.</i>

150
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,647
<i> I know it's</i>
<i> only four of us.</i>
<i> Is that weird?</i>

151
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,115
No, no,
it's not weird at all.

152
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,951
I think, um-- I think
a small crew is cool.

153
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,186
Yeah, we're gonna
be like the Beatles.
We are like the Beatles.

154
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,056
- You're like John and Paul.
- I'm Ringo 'cause
i keep it light

155
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,357
and I look a little bit
like a possum.

156
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,192
And I'm George
'cause I'm stony

157
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,361
and I, you know,
can't get enough of the sun.

158
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,096
I'm, uh,
I'm George Martin.

159
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,232
Yeah, the integral
fifth beatle.

160
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,833
I love
meeting new people.

161
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,368
This guy's
got fucking blow.

162
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,003
You're dropping
squirt bombs.

163
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,105
This guy won't
get in the pool,
but he will.

164
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:17,308
- If it's weird,
say it 'cause I know...
- It's not weird.

165
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,220
Ari:
<i> Hey, what are you</i>
<i> doing over there, man?</i>

166
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,922
I'm still trying
to get the Wi-Fi to work.

167
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,691
Yeah, we're in
a cabin in Ojai.

168
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,292
The Wi-Fi's
not gonna work.

169
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,395
Yeah, but, I mean,
i can't not be accessible
on the Internet

170
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,230
and also up here with
no cell phone reception

171
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,299
- for an entire weekend.
- Who cares?
It's the weekend.

172
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,301
When I got off the 101,
i called shauna

173
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,403
and I was like, "okay,
I'm going where there's
no reception.

174
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,473
- Love you."
- Yeah, but I didn't
make that call to Marissa.

175
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,241
So she doesn't know
that I'm here

176
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,243
and she doesn't know
that I'm unreachable

177
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,946
should she be trying to call
or email me or whatever.

178
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,481
Why doesn't Marissa know
that you're here?

179
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,149
She just,
you know, decided

180
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,151
that she needed
to be somewhere else

181
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,721
that I don't live
for the time being.

182
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,057
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, man.

183
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,425
She's just basically
coming at me

184
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,161
and saying, you know,
that after 10 years almost,

185
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,362
that there's
an entire life

186
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,764
that she feels
like she's missing

187
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,966
and that she sort of
needed some space,

188
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,267
and i
responded to that

189
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,037
by being what I felt
was very attentive

190
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,338
and what she felt
was clingy.

191
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,840
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,943
It's-- it's gotta
be really hard.

193
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,945
-<i> Break-ups are tough. </i>
- It's not a break-up,

194
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,814
you know,
at this time.

195
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,282
- Okay.
- I think that
there might be

196
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,351
some benefit here to having
some friends around.

197
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,120
And maybe, you know,
we're talking about it now

198
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,088
and I'll talk
about it with Josh
as soon as I get a chance.

199
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,091
I wouldn't tell Josh
about it, I think,

200
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,327
because we're
on thin ice here.

201
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,796
There's only four of us.
No one showed up.

202
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,998
It's just that he's hurting
and he's been going
through a lot

203
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,800
and now
I'm hurting, too,

204
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,835
and I feel like we sort of
are going to relate
to each other

205
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,971
in a way that
i don't expect you to get.

206
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,174
Let's not compare
the hurt of a break-up

207
00:12:56,176 --> 00:13:00,078
or whatever it is
with what joshy
went through.

208
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,015
Okay, so everybody gets one
of these character cards.

209
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,017
And I'm now going
to go into the attack

210
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,086
and defending portion.
You ready?

211
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,121
<i> "Attack abilities</i>
<i> and attacking a monster.</i>

212
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,924
The type of symbol
shows whether it is
a melee ability

213
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,325
or a ranged attack
ability."

214
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,493
Uh, yes. Adam,
i have a question.

215
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,162
Is it-- okay,
i can answer it

216
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,329
because I think I know
what you're going to say.

217
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,265
- What?
- If you're wondering

218
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:23,201
why the part on the bottom
of your figurine
is an octagon

219
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,969
<i> and it's standing</i>
<i> on a hexagonal shape</i>

220
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,237
<i> that connects</i>
<i> to the center one,</i>

221
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,939
I promise you
we're going to
get to that

222
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,307
- very, very shortly.
- Was that your question?

223
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,109
That was not my question.
Here's my question.

224
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,478
Should we be playing
this game right now?

225
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,847
- Yeah, definitely, 100%.
- Yeah.

226
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,382
Eric;
<i> Can I just pose</i>
<i> another option?</i>

227
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,984
We go out tonight,
we go to this bar
the lone Angus.

228
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,854
I've done a bunch of research
on yelp and trip advisor.

229
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:46,090
It's a fun local bar.
It's, like, divey,
but not too divey.

230
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,358
Maybe the time
to go to the bar

231
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,493
would be, I don't know,
tomorrow afternoon

232
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,861
for happy hour
or something,

233
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,496
when, you know,
it's light out

234
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,131
and they have the windows open
and the drinks are cheaper.

235
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,166
What's the deal with you
and the windows open at a bar?

236
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,569
It's just nice
to get that bar smell
wafting out a little bit.

237
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,437
Okay, let's say we go
to the bar tonight,

238
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:03,141
have some drinks,
mellow, nothing crazy.

239
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,577
Come back here,
wake up in the morning,

240
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,045
<i> we're sitting</i>
<i> around the table,</i>

241
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,581
we are ready to settle in
to a full game.

242
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,549
Josh:
<i> Well, just to be clear,</i>

243
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,853
Adam and I have been
coveting this game
for quite some time.

244
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,888
We even actually
helped crowd fund it.

245
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,256
<i> We just opened it</i>
<i> tonight.</i>

246
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,357
Right, or we could
go to the bar,

247
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,226
and if the bar
is not cool,

248
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,494
then we could
just come back here
and play tonight.

249
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:26,331
I mean, how fun would that be?
Like a late-night game.

250
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,032
If you're serious

251
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,034
about doing it
tomorrow,

252
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,003
then, yeah,
i mean, the--

253
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,638
it's something
to consider, I guess.

254
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,007
Eric:
<i> So I have a lot planned.</i>

255
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,909
<i> We're gonna do</i>
<i> a little dinner tonight,</i>

256
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,344
<i> we're gonna</i>
<i> go to the casino,</i>

257
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,612
<i> play a little cards.</i>

258
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,580
- Josh:<i> Yeah. </i>
-<i> Yeah.</i>

259
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,916
<i> Have a bite to eat.</i>
<i> We're not gonna</i>
<i> just drink, though.</i>

260
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,285
- We're gonna have
a nice dinner.
- Welcome to the lone Angus.

261
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,153
I will be your waiter.
My name is Greg.

262
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,556
- Nice to meet you, Greg.
- Right on.

263
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,425
So I got four
Tequila shots here

264
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,929
- and a diet coke
on the rocks.
- Sweet.

265
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,464
We didn't order those
Tequila shots, though,

266
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,199
- so I think we're good.
- Well, that's, uh,

267
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,400
not what the bartender
is telling me.

268
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,335
It's okay, though.
I mean, like, we're...

269
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,170
- Yeah, we'll take them.
- Right, but we didn't
order them,

270
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,239
so I don't think
we should have to

271
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,074
- pay for them.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa,

272
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,910
speaking of which,
did you guys order
these drinks

273
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,111
that you already have
at the bar?

274
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,412
Yes, because
you weren't here, so...

275
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,180
Yeah, but there's
table service here.

276
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,249
Yeah, but you weren't here.
We waited for 15 minutes.

277
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,985
I was here. No, I've
been here since 5:00.

278
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,387
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I've been here.

279
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,390
It's okay, okay.
We'll take the shots.

280
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:28,059
- ...like every asshole does.
- Oh, we're assholes now?

281
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,394
-<i> Yeah, you're an ass... </i>
- Eric, Eric.

282
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,062
Maybe you could bring me
a windshield wiper

283
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:33,031
because you just spit
all over my fucking face!

284
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,232
Greg:
<i> Why don't you take</i>
<i> that windshield wiper</i>

285
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,301
and shove it
right up your ass?!

286
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,339
- Oh, what's up, man?
- Hey, man, how you doing?

287
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,541
Greg:
<i> That was great.</i>
<i> Hi, guys.</i>

288
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,976
You should see
your faces right now.

289
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,611
We just fucking
pranked you guys.

290
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,046
That was one
of the best ones
we've ever done.

291
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,981
You guys,
this is my boy, Greg.

292
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,549
I invited him to join us
for the weekend.

293
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,986
This is Josh, this is Ari,
this is Adam.

294
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,587
Adam, nice to meet you.
Greg.

295
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,289
Ari? Greg.

296
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,025
Josh, the man
of the hour. Greg.

297
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,360
Sit down, sit down,
sit down.

298
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,228
Thank you guys so much
for including me.

299
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,663
- Thank you so much.
- Definitely.

300
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,432
- Not a problem.
- Thank you for...

301
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:10,101
And my boy here told me
there was a bachelor party,

302
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,669
and I was just like,
"oh, can I come?"

303
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,338
He was like,
"you got it."

304
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,206
Yeah, no, I, uh--

305
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,175
it's just that, um,
i was gonna get married,

306
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,576
but I'm not anymore,

307
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,411
so we're kind of just
salvaging the weekend,

308
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,014
- and it's just for guys.
- Yeah, yeah, we're just, uh--

309
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,549
we're treating this
like a boy's weekend.

310
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,517
I thought you said that
this is a bachelor party.

311
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,986
- Um...
- You're not even
getting married?

312
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,520
Well, no, he's--
but we're treating it

313
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,356
like the fun
of a bachelor party,

314
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,157
but it's just
a boy's weekend away.

315
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,560
You know what? Yeah,
we're not even really
using that word.

316
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:38,563
- You guys break up?
- Essentially, I was
gonna get married,

317
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,732
- but now it's
not gonna happen.
- I just can't stress enough

318
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:43,067
- that we should just move on.
- It just sort of
turned into--

319
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,403
- kind of like a guy's weekend.
- Live right now
in the moment.

320
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:46,738
Hey, man,
that's all I'm doing.
That's what all I'm about.

321
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,674
Let's just do our shots
to-- to nothing.

322
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,376
- Yeah, to nothing.
- To nothing.

323
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,211
- To nothing is a great idea.
- To nothing.

324
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,346
- For the weekend.
- Fuck that bitch.

325
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,715
-<i> She doesn't deserve you. </i>
- Eric:<i> Again, not...</i>

326
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,450
- Yeah, maybe.
- So as I mentioned,

327
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:02,053
I actually invited Greg
to join us for the weekend

328
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,354
as we have
that extra room

329
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,156
because this guy
brings the party to 11.

330
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,358
Yeah, thanks so much
for having me.

331
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,693
- Well, you know...
-<i> It's so gracious</i>
<i> of you guys to include me</i>

332
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,661
on this very
special weekend.

333
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,031
I was thinking because
we have fewer people
than we thought

334
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,432
that we would
kind of spread out

335
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,100
so no one has to
share a room,

336
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,735
so we don't actually have
an extra one anymore.

337
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,805
Yeah, and, like,
since you guys are boys,

338
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,207
maybe you guys could
just share a room.

339
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,609
Ooh, oh, no,
i can't do that.

340
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,345
I can't, uh, I can't
room with somebody.

341
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,814
And trust me,
none of you want
to room with me

342
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,783
'cause I just
got diagnosed
with sleep apnea,

343
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,285
- and I gotta wear that mask.
- Yeah, dude's like bane.

344
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,722
Hello, would you like
your dick sucked?

345
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,625
- Whoa! Yeah.

346
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,160
- Classic bane joke.
- Terrible bane.

347
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,594
Let's cheers it up
to new beginnings.

348
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,296
- Ari:<i> To new beginnings. </i>
- Love it.

349
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,799
- To new beginnings, right?
- Oh, my shit's empty.

350
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,367
- You know, whatever.
- Hey, waiter,

351
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,501
why don't you
go get another drink?

352
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,304
Fuck you!

353
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,273
Ari:
<i> Excuse me, I don't want</i>
<i> to speak to no doctor!</i>

354
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,809
I want to speak
to a pharmacist!

355
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,377
Yeah, man.

356
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,345
Oh, goodness.

357
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,181
- Oh, yeah.
- Shockingly cold.

358
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,782
Greg is a trip, huh?

359
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,385
Dude, Greg
is the best!

360
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,320
I'm kind of
a big fan of him.

361
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,321
- Yeah.
- He's so intense.

362
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,423
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

363
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,625
- I'll send it to you.
What's your number?
- Please do.

364
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,527
Are you cool?

365
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,497
Yeah.

366
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,502
Oh, yeah.
I'm great, how are you?

367
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,104
I'm good, I'm good.

368
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,205
I mean, I just
wanna make sure

369
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,773
that--
that you're good

370
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:33,177
with all of-- with all of
how everything is going.

371
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,512
Yeah, yeah, no.

372
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,681
This is, um, lining up
to be a fun one.

373
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,183
It was just, like,
scurrying all around
the floor,

374
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,686
and we had, like,
an English muffin
we didn't want to--

375
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,521
Eric:
<i> You know, turtles are,</i>
<i> like, an aphrodisiac.</i>

376
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,656
You wanted
to eat the turtle?

377
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,291
Woman:<i> In retrospect,</i>
<i> you could've just</i>
<i> picked it up</i>

378
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,327
<i> by the little shell</i>
<i> on the sides</i>

379
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,695
<i> and been</i>
<i> completely okay.</i>

380
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,363
Eric:
<i> My buddy</i>
<i> will pick you up...</i>

381
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,666
...backlogs of nonsense
that go back two years.

382
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,402
Right, but why
is this the time

383
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,804
to be bringing any...

384
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,241
But wh-- but it just--
it's not even relevant

385
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,709
to what we're
talking about anymore.

386
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,778
It's not a part of what
I'm trying to discuss,

387
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,447
and to say that
it's something
that I've been

388
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:13,284
willingly or intentionally
neglecting is insane.

389
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,785
I'm happy
you guys are here.

390
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,688
- Are you kidding? Yes.
- I think we're being followed.

391
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,724
No. I'm sorry.

392
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,693
- I'm looking...
- What is happening?

393
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,428
Who are you?
Are you okay?

394
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,298
Yeah, I'm looking
for my phone.

395
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,666
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

396
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,234
Did you guys see
a phone?

397
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:33,471
- Um, did it have a case?
- Woman:<i> No.</i>

398
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,673
-<i> Ugh. </i>
- Caseless.
I haven't seen it.

399
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,276
I'm sorry,
this is Josh.

400
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,877
- Oh, hi, Josh.
- Oh, yeah, I'm Josh.

401
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,212
- I'm Jodi. Hi.
- Hey, Jodi.

402
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,181
- I'm Ari.
- Hi, Ari.

403
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,515
- How's it going?
- Oh, do you want me
to hold that for you?

404
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,917
Yes, please.
Yes, please.

405
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,252
- Can I hold it in my lungs?
- Yes, please.

406
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,488
Um, you are cold.

407
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,523
- You need a...
- How can you tell?

408
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,258
Maybe, um...

409
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,763
- I'm gonna give you
my sweater.
- Oh, well, thank you.

410
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:01,532
- You're such a gentleman.
- Oh, here.

411
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,234
- Have two.
- Thank you.
No, I don't need it.

412
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:04,769
- No, have two.
- Don't please.

413
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,572
Look what's happening.
Double the warmth.

414
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:10,241
Double gentleman attack!

415
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,210
- What?
- I'm sorry.

416
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,378
Are you guys
murderers or what?

417
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,414
No, not at all.
We are not murderers.

418
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,716
- Yeah.
-<i> What are you doing</i>
<i> here in Ojai?</i>

419
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,484
Yeah, what brings you here?
Are you local?

420
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,787
I'm here for, like, a big
birthday vacation weekend.

421
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,423
- I'm turning 30.
- Both: Wow, awesome!

422
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,391
- You're with friends?
- Yeah.

423
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,260
- Okay, cool.
- They're not cool right now.

424
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,329
They're real--
they're real shitty.

425
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,698
Well, we're having
sort of a weird--

426
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,366
not weird,
but, like, a party thing.

427
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,667
Nothing like
a weird party thing.

428
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,669
I think all party things
are kind of weird.

429
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:39,837
- Hello.
- Jodi:<i> Well, hello.</i>

430
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,305
- Hey, this is--
- hi.

431
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,407
Did someone say
"weird party thing"?

432
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,843
Hello,
my name is Adam.

433
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,546
My name is Jodi.

434
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:49,947
We are all robots.

435
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,816
Well, I'm single now,

436
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,952
so, you know, um...

437
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,488
- What the fuck
are you doing?
- Adam, really?

438
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,523
- What?
- Are you okay?

439
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,692
Well, I got a couple bars,
so I made a phone call.

440
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,861
Uh, I'm sorry to drag you
into my business.

441
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,496
Jodi:
<i> No, I actually</i>
<i> am into it.</i>

442
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,797
Yeah, 10 years of my life
just went down the shitter.

443
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,733
- We talked about this.
- No, man.

444
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,401
- We talked about that.
- Yeah, but everything's
changed now.

445
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:11,869
It's all different.
It sucks now.

446
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:15,306
- Everything's worse.
- So you and Marissa, no?

447
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,508
Yeah, no, no go.
You know, 10 years
right in the shitter.

448
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,277
It's fine, but, hey,
on the other hand,

449
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,978
Eric has found
some casino near here

450
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,714
that he says
is the best in the area.

451
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,483
- Ari:<i> Well, that sounds fun.</i>
I would go to a casino.
- There's a casino here?

452
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,451
Didn't expect you guys
to actually be
so excited about that.

453
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,986
You look so cold
and stupid, both of you.

454
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,522
Do they look
like murderers, though?

455
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,658
- Yeah.
- Here, I don't need this.

456
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,860
Thank you very much.
I don't need both, yeah.

457
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,695
Total enthusiasm
for Eric's casino idea?

458
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,797
No one just kind of thought
we were gonna go home
after this

459
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,433
and, you know,
have bedtime and...

460
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,869
- Have bedtime?
- Hey, Adam, is this...

461
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:47,004
Well, what do you call it
when it's time to go to bed?

462
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:50,341
- The time I go to bed.
- Are you okay?

463
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:52,810
Yeah, I mean, you know,
of course not, but...

464
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,545
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

465
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,714
I didn't mean
to come out here
and just blurt, I mean...

466
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,716
- No, no, that's big.
That's huge.
- I just got off the phone.

467
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,518
And looked over and I saw

468
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,453
Eric
and what's-his-name
and you guys over here,

469
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:05,456
and I just kind of
felt like I had to
say something to somebody,

470
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,957
but i
shouldn't have. I...

471
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,894
Well, look, if you need
to talk about it, you can.

472
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,098
- No, I'm good, thank you.
- Are you sure?

473
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,666
- Yes.
- I could go like that.

474
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,802
That does feel warmer,
but I'm actually...

475
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,503
And your arms
are weirdly heavy.

476
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,406
I'm a big, thick
kind of oxey Jew.

477
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,076
You kind of are.
You look like
someone's cousin

478
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:28,646
or, like, a boy from camp
who was, like, my crush.

479
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:29,880
Oh, what camp
did you go to?

480
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,449
- Really?
- Yeah.

481
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,117
Well, 'cause I went to camp
back east, so I...

482
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,052
- Me, too.
- Where?

483
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,688
- Blue star.
- Shut up.

484
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,056
I went to blue star.

485
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,492
- You shut up now.
- No, you shut up now.

486
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:43,828
- Prove it.
- Blue star
where the Jews are.

487
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,063
Yeah.

488
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,134
- Both: Hey!
- Oh, damn it!

489
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,902
Oh, snaps.

490
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,071
Guys, we're gonna
go to the casino.
Do you wanna come?

491
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,073
- Me?
-<i> Yeah, you should come.</i>

492
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,675
- Adam:<i> Yeah, we need</i>
<i> a lady luck. </i>
- The more the merrier.

493
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:59,944
I'll be
your lady luck.

494
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,046
But I really wanna
find my phone.

495
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,382
And I'm actually
kind of feeling like
i left it in my house.

496
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,550
Like, I did not even
bring it here
to begin with

497
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,419
'cause I'm chill
and I wanna unplug.

498
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:10,688
Yeah, of course.
Get out of the matrix.

499
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,523
Do you think you
would walk me down

500
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,824
just to see
if it's there?

501
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,092
I don't actually
wanna get murdered.

502
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,927
Uh, yeah, well,
i would love to,

503
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:20,398
but joshy's actually,
um, like, used to
come up here as a kid.

504
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,732
- He's knows the area
pretty well.
- We'll go to the casino.

505
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,934
You come
meet us later, right?

506
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:27,037
- You, too.
- No, I will gladly
walk you home.

507
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,574
Jodi:
<i> Did you ever hear about</i>

508
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,777
when there was
a pyramid of tampons

509
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,612
that got set on fire

510
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,113
and then pushed down
into the middle
of the lake?

511
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,681
Shut up.
That was you?

512
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,683
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, my god.

513
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,719
That thing, like,
almost burned down
a couple of boats.

514
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,020
And it stunk

515
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:45,489
because it was
like a chemical fire!

516
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:48,092
Like, what are the odds
that you as a child

517
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,994
saw the same things
that I saw as a child?

518
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:52,530
Actual same summers?

519
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:54,598
No, it's crazy.
Similar summers.

520
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,667
- Yeah.
- Similar summers.

521
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:07,711
- Tonie!
- Eric:<i> Tonie, positive vibes,</i>
<i> positive energy.</i>

522
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,548
- I should be careful.
- Adam, look at this.

523
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,949
You got exactly
what you wanted.

524
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,617
We're all sitting around
playing a game together.

525
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,619
I wanted to play,
like, a co-op game

526
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,955
that we could all
sort of just work
together as friends.

527
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,623
But we are
playing together.

528
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,827
We're all
cooperating together
against tonie here.

529
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,562
It just kind of
feels to me like--

530
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,096
like a little bit
of a monkey's paw
at this point.

531
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,132
What does that mean,
monkey's paw?

532
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:31,101
Well, like, I wished
we were all playing a game,
and now I got my wish,

533
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,904
but it's like
the saddest, weirdest,
worst version of that

534
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,040
because I'm
just losing money
and I'm stressed out.

535
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,642
So it's like if you went
to a monkey seller

536
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,578
and you said,
"hey, give me a monkey,"

537
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,546
<i> and then he just</i>
<i> gave you the hand?</i>

538
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:44,682
<i> No, I mean, I think</i>
<i> you're thinking of it</i>
<i> too literally.</i>

539
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,817
-<i> The hand is cursed. </i>
- Eric:<i> Like a leprechaun.</i>

540
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,053
<i> You know, you get them,</i>
<i> and then they fucking--</i>

541
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:50,855
-<i> they're kind of shady. </i>
- Greg:<i> I thought</i>
<i> they were shady</i>

542
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:52,490
<i> before you caught 'em,</i>
<i> but once you caught 'em,</i>

543
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:55,960
-<i> they were, like, your slave. </i>
- Well, ta-da.

544
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:58,829
This is actually--
this is amazing.

545
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,031
- Yeah.
- You should see
the place I'm staying.

546
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:04,134
It's like a--
a turquoise dealership.

547
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,137
It's like
a kidnapper shack.

548
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,839
Yeah, oh,
very much so.

549
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,608
Yeah, I'm imagining
like the sock

550
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,676
that a teenage boy
uses to, like,

551
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,879
- jerk into made
into, somehow, a house.
- Jerk off into?

552
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:17,815
That is pretty--
pretty accurate.

553
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:19,550
Ew.

554
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,819
Thanks for the, um,

555
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:24,688
walk back here.

556
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,824
It was very nice.

557
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:28,893
No, thank you.
It was, um,

558
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:32,696
so weird to meet someone
from blue star.

559
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,964
- I know.
- It's so crazy.

560
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:37,234
Yeah. You know me.

561
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:40,304
Um, I'm gonna go inside,
but I'll give you this.

562
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:42,740
- Oh.
- 'Cause I'm not a thief

563
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,142
even though I probably seem
really rough and tough,

564
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,945
I'm not a thief
and I'm not gonna
steal your sweater.

565
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,559
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

566
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,727
- Thank you.
- Yeah. No, thank you.

567
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,666
Are you waiting there
for me to get in?

568
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,668
Hmm? Yeah,
i don't wanna leave
till you get in.

569
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,269
That's so nice.

570
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,971
That's what you do.

571
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,343
Um, i--

572
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:22,947
I don't have my key.

573
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:25,616
Sorry, I forgot.

574
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:28,352
I smoked your weed,
my fault.

575
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:29,887
- Okay.
- I didn't think about

576
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:31,055
- whether or not
i had a key.
- Okay.

577
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,356
And I feel
really embarrassed.

578
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:34,758
Like, oh, some girl
i met in a bar.

579
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,927
- Come on, let's go
back to the bar.
- But I don't have my phone,

580
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,096
- and I don't have my purse.
- We're gonna go back
to the bar.

581
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,198
- There's a lot of things
to be embarrassed.
- I'm your friend.

582
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,906
Dude, this guy
used to fucking go

583
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:51,075
to the parking lots
at dead shows--

584
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:53,944
- I fucking did, man.
- And fucking run
drum circles.

585
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,779
Dude, I ran
drum circles.

586
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,982
I sold acid
for, like, five minutes,

587
00:26:57,984 --> 00:26:59,817
<i> and then I got freaked out</i>
<i> and I stopped.</i>

588
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:02,753
I saw the last
grateful dead show.

589
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:05,656
I saw the last one they did
at the meadowlands.

590
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:06,690
You were not
at the last show.

591
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,092
I was at the last show.

592
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:10,194
Don't try and hitch
onto my thing, okay?

593
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:12,129
- That's not cool.
- Joshua?

594
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,765
<i> Joshua, you seem kind of</i>
<i> down and gloomy doomy.</i>

595
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,400
- No, no.
-<i> Are you sure?</i>

596
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:18,836
- Yeah, I'm good.
- 'Cause I got the solution.

597
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:21,171
- <i> And it's more combo. </i>

598
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,340
- What did you do?
- It's called dramarama,

599
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,075
but ours is fake
and it was, like--

600
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,946
it was
the first day of my period
and I had a heavy flow.

601
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:31,115
And I put my pad in the trash
at my friend's house,

602
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:34,218
but then her French poodle
took the pad out of the trash

603
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,954
and her hot brother
saw that, like,

604
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:38,756
my pussy bleeds
or whatever.

605
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:40,924
- And it was just, like...
- It was like penthouse letters

606
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,927
- for chicks
who get their period.
- What's penthouse letters?

607
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,363
Oh, my god.

608
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,198
Hello?

609
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,935
It's super twin peaksy,

610
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,271
and I fucking hope

611
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,373
my shitty friends
took my purse.

612
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,410
Well, I don't know
what you're doing now,

613
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:01,278
but you can come hang out
with my shitty friends.

614
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,747
Uh, yeah, I'll hang out
with your shitty friends.

615
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,382
- Like, do they suck?
- Oh, yeah, they suck so bad.

616
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,451
- Cool.
- Yeah, you will
hate them.

617
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,453
And they're all
going through some
real hardcore emotional shit.

618
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,155
- Oh.
- So it'll be a good hang.

619
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:12,923
How could I resist?

620
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:16,260
You have been convicted
of the crime

621
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:19,396
of stealing
a loaf of bread!

622
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,931
Greg:
<i> No, no, please!</i>

623
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,867
You've already
burned down my
jewelry store!

624
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:29,139
Oh, god!
Holy shit!

625
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,842
<i> Ow! God, that hurt!</i>

626
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:34,178
- - Oh, but it was so good.
It was so funny.

627
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,847
Hey, it's the girl
from the bar!

628
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,215
- Hey!
- Jodi.

629
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,850
- Hi.
- Hi, Jodi. I'm Eric.

630
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,418
- Jodi?
- Hey.

631
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,320
- Greg:<i> Do you spell it</i>
<i> j-o-d-i? </i>
- You okay?

632
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,989
Here. For that,
let me kiss you

633
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,826
- like the Europeans say hello.
- Okay, okay.

634
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,328
- No, I'm just
gonna say hello...
- You are saying hello.

635
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,297
- You are saying hello,
all right?
- Oh, okay.

636
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,766
- Jodi: Hi, hi.
- Greg:<i> I get it,</i>
<i> I get it, okay.</i>

637
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,801
- You wanna smoke weed?
It's right here.
- Yes, thank you.

638
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:00,237
Very unsettling.
He's pointing
a gun at me.

639
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,039
- Jodi: I don't want that.
- It's a bb gun!

640
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,374
Oh, same thing.
It's always weird.

641
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,777
Josh, we have
some guests now.

642
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,946
<i> You still seem a little</i>
<i> boo-boo-boo-boo.</i>

643
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:11,482
- I'm fine.
- Here, can I make
a suggestion?

644
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:13,951
Oh, well, how are we
stepping it up, kemosabe?

645
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,886
The g-rock over here
is gonna shoot me...

646
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:19,056
- In the dick!
- Greg:<i> Oh, yes!</i>

647
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:21,425
Yes, he's gonna shoot me
in the dick hole.

648
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,060
I'm gonna hold the cup
on top of my head,

649
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:25,028
but then
he's gotta shoot me

650
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,031
- straight in my dinger.
- Okay, all right!

651
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,199
You really want me
to do that?

652
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,168
And if--
if the cup falls,

653
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,203
the he gets to shoot me
in my bonanza hole.

654
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:36,006
The bonanza hole?

655
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,008
You know what I think
a butt hole looks like?

656
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,444
Is it just--
i think it looks like
a chimp victim's eye.

657
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,780
Joshua, could I have
a little Harry Carey

658
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,281
play-by-play
commentary, please?

659
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,949
Oh, perfect.
That's great,
that's great.

660
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,918
Well, I was
just thinking

661
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,954
a year ago,
we were all here--

662
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:54,091
here with our ladies.

663
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:56,794
<i> You know, uh, Marissa</i>

664
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,562
<i> and shauna and--</i>

665
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:01,431
and Rachel.

666
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,369
<i> It's interesting that,</i>

667
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:09,173
I don't know.
I was just thinking
about that.

668
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,241
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I'm sorry.

669
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,544
Josh, Josh, Josh,
look at me.

670
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,412
It's not okay.

671
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,049
It's not okay
to be sad!

672
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,517
You understand?

673
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,987
You are meant to be happy.
That is who you are.

674
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,090
This sad person,
that is something

675
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,593
that you think that you are,
but you're not that!

676
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,895
If you were
meant to be sad,

677
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:34,364
being sad
would feel good.

678
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:37,034
But it doesn't, does it?
What feels good?

679
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:38,502
Being happy!

680
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:42,172
And you should feel good,
so be happy!

681
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,208
Be who you are.

682
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,478
- Sorry. I...
- No, no, no, no.

683
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,113
- I didn't mean to--
- no, no, no.

684
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:54,418
Look, you're not
allowed to apologize

685
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,120
the rest of the time
that I'm here.

686
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,260
Thank you
for that, Greg.

687
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:05,128
Eric:
<i> Yes, Greg!</i>
<i> Good pep talk!</i>

688
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,931
How about, Joshua,
that we create
some new memories?

689
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,433
- What do you mean?
-<i> Joshua,</i>

690
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:11,401
I'm about to get shot
in my dick hole for you.

691
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,503
So please just give me
a little commentary.

692
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:16,306
- Do Harry Carey.
- Uh, Greg,

693
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:20,143
now lining up
his-- his rifle.

694
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:23,914
<i> He's got it lined up</i>
<i> to shoot Eric in the penis.</i>

695
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,149
<i> If the red cup falls,</i>

696
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,952
Eric's gotta get shot
in the bonanza hole.

697
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:33,056
Right where
the chimp victim's eye is.

698
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,126
That's beautiful!
Oh, my god!

699
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,130
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

700
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,501
Oh, my god!
It didn't go in my d-hole,

701
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,203
but it clipped
my yam sack!

702
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:47,638
Oh, my god,
you clipped his sack!

703
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,406
A fucking bet is a bet.

704
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,141
The cup fell,

705
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,643
so it looks like
you're gonna be shooting me

706
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:56,079
- right in my fucking bonanza.
- All: No, no, no!

707
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,915
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah!

708
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,417
- Rules are rules.
- Adam:<i> You know, maybe--</i>

709
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,487
I mean, do you
really wanna be shot
in the bonanza?

710
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:06,390
Maybe we could
do something that
everyone is involved with.

711
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:08,425
Like, you know,
with six of us,
we could just get

712
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,360
a short campaign going
of mecha dungeon crawl.

713
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:14,598
Mecca?
Mecca dungeon cr--
like, this is islamic?

714
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,001
- No, it's, like, mechanical.
- It's a very complicated
board game.

715
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:19,369
We could just
play through it quickly

716
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,171
and with so many people,
it would go pretty fast.

717
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:22,973
I think
that it's bad for me

718
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,708
to play a game that's
very complicated
right now

719
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,644
because I smoked tons of--
ripped so much.

720
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:30,714
I had a bong and I feel
like it's not my preference
to play a game.

721
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:34,418
And I'm not gonna be able
to get there with you.

722
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,620
We could play the very,
very complicated game

723
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:38,522
that could last
six to seven hours

724
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:41,591
with a couple of strangers
who are all fucked up on pot,

725
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:45,028
or we could
go into the hot tub.

726
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,263
I'll go in the hot tub!

727
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:48,198
The lady
wants the hot tub.

728
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,967
- Hot tub.
- The gentleman
wants a hot tub.

729
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,302
- Joshy?
- Yeah, well--

730
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,538
great. Hot tub time.
Here, I'll just
take this from you.

731
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,606
Greg:
<i> Yeah, take it.</i>
<i> I don't want it.</i>

732
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,676
- Eric:<i> All right, man. </i>
- Jodi:<i> We're ready</i>
<i> for bubbles.</i>

733
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:02,279
- Oh! Okay.
- Gee, man.

734
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:04,548
- Oh, my god.
- There's a slight problem
with the hot tub.

735
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,550
It is not
currently hot.

736
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:09,252
- Oh.
- There's steam
coming out of it.

737
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,288
Well, that's just
because the water
is warmer than the air.

738
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,490
All right, well, let's
fucking party inside.

739
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,994
Uh, not so fast.
Got a satellite view of
the entire neighborhood here.

740
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,729
Found the appropriate
neighbors' hot tubs,

741
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:21,565
and I think I found
our spot right here.

742
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,333
Are you talking
about to sneak in?

743
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,668
Uh, yes, we're gonna do
a little sneaking.

744
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,503
And we're gonna do
a little dip,

745
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,438
- then we'll do
a little dash.
- And it's perfect too.

746
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,307
It's perfect 'cause
there's none of those
security stickers

747
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:33,310
on any of the gates,
so we'll get in fine.

748
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:35,445
- Oh, ho!
- I say let's do it, man.

749
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,015
Ojai is communal hot tubs.
My hot tub is your hot tub.

750
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,051
To the hot tub!

751
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:44,021
Oh, okay,
we're going right now.

752
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,747
Adam, don't you
wanna come in?

753
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,349
No, it's not my thing.

754
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,351
You just snuck in
to sit here?

755
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:16,486
Yeah, well,
i wanna be around people
to hang out.

756
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,588
But, you know,
I'll let them have their fun.
It's not really for me.

757
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,157
I'm sorry I didn't
wanna do your game.

758
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,125
That's fine.
You know, no one
wants to do it,

759
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,727
so, it's, you know,
you're just part
of the gang.

760
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,430
Yeah, well, I know
I'm a stranger

761
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,132
who's, like, on drugs
and drunk and doesn't
have any pants on,

762
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,301
but I'm wishing you
the best.

763
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,070
- I hope you're okay.
- I guess you're the first

764
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,805
of many new
pantsless women
i will soon meet.

765
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:38,108
- Ari:<i> Hey, Jodi? </i>
- Sure. Yeah.

766
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,243
- No, it's okay.
I know you wanna go in.
- I'm sorry.

767
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:43,380
You know, I do have,
like, some okay friends.

768
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:46,516
I have a friend that
i could introduce you to
tomorrow if you're interested.

769
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,585
She's nice and fun.

770
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,520
She's not that nice,
but she's pretty fun.

771
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,790
Yeah? Does she like
desperate, broken men
with nothing to offer?

772
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,659
Most American women
like that kind of thing.

773
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,661
- Eric:<i> Welcome</i>
<i> to the hot tub. </i>
- Oh!

774
00:34:57,663 --> 00:35:00,130
Eric:
<i> Welcome to</i>
<i> the hot tub, Jodi!</i>

775
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You guys hear that?

776
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,675
What?
Oh, it's probably
the fondas.

777
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:13,110
<i> They wanna join us</i>
<i> in the tub.</i>

778
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:14,744
-<i> Hey, Jodi? </i>
-<i> What?</i>

779
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:17,314
Do you have
any words about joining
the greater tub community?

780
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:20,550
Cool, fun, new,
a surprise.

781
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,419
Tonight, the evening.

782
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,788
I love it,
strangers, scared.

783
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,159
- I'm really happy.
- Yay, with friends!

784
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:31,828
Adam, let's play
your board game
in the hot tub.

785
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,330
Well, that's
obviously impossible.

786
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:34,865
Hey, Adam,
come in here, man.

787
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:38,268
- All:<i> Adam. </i>
- Adam, come on, buddy.

788
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,536
- Jodi:<i> He doesn't want to. </i>
- Greg:<i> Ari? Ari?</i>

789
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,605
Yeah?

790
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:45,275
My sister's beautiful,
and she's a dental
hygienist,

791
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,877
so she has
her own money.

792
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:49,312
That's great.

793
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,281
- Wait, why did you say that?

794
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,752
You guys heard that,
right?

795
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,787
Did you guys--
am I the only one
who heard that?

796
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,523
- I did hear that.
- It's probably, like,
the fucking--

797
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,625
- what the fuck is that?
- Like a dog or whatever.

798
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,860
Greg:<i> There is</i>
<i> a fucking murderer</i>
<i> in that bush, man.</i>

799
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:04,895
- Eric:<i> It's not a murderer. </i>
- Hey.

800
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:06,563
<i> It's Billy Baldwin.</i>

801
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,431
Ari:<i> It's fucking</i>
<i> Laura dern's chocolate lab</i>

802
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:09,833
- sneaking around.
- Hey.

803
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,601
No, dude,
I'm serious, man.
I'm fucking serious.

804
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,703
- What?
- I'm out of--
I'm getting out.

805
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:16,273
- If it's a fucking--
- all right, guys.
Joshua's weekend.

806
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:19,442
- Hey, Ari, Ari?
- Whoa, we gotta go
with Joshua.

807
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,178
- We need to talk later.
- Yeah.

808
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,183
- Just a little bit.
- Yeah, no, no, no.

809
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:28,385
I don't need to be
up all night talking--

810
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:30,820
- talking about
i don't know.
- Whatever, no, no, no.

811
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,223
Jodi:
<i> I just met</i>
<i> a bunch of strangers</i>

812
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:35,225
- <i> and I talk their ear off</i>
<i> all night and, uh-- </i>

813
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:36,960
-<i> and then I just... </i>
- But I totally understand

814
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:38,962
what you were saying before
about backpack style hip-hop.

815
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,964
I think that that
is a distinction

816
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:42,532
of a kind of hip-hop
that does not get
mentioned that much.

817
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,334
'Cause you're, like,
talib kweli,

818
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,636
black star,
tribe called quest,
de la soul.

819
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,371
I really think
that hip-hop's, like,

820
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,574
a very important part
of our culture.

821
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:53,443
- Yes, agree 100%.
- Jodi:<i> But haven't you</i>
<i> both also,</i>

822
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,679
like, been to tanglewood
to see James Taylor?

823
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:15,432
- Whoa, that's funky!
- You know what's
the funkiest?

824
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:18,902
This is the funkiest
guy we know!

825
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,371
Dude, dude, dude.
Blow that in my mouth.

826
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,241
Come on, man.

827
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:25,875
It's really funny.

828
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,544
Blow it
in my mouth, man.

829
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:29,546
- Do it, do it.
- Come on. Blow it.

830
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,353
- Wow!
- Yeah! You guys
are my band!

831
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:44,294
Here's your trumpet!

832
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:46,296
So when you think about
the basic paradoxes,

833
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,265
you know, one of them,
the bootstrap paradox,

834
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:50,967
dictates that
no matter what happens
when you go back in time,

835
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,902
<i> no matter what information</i>
<i> you take with you,</i>

836
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,371
<i> it's always been there.</i>

837
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:57,007
<i> So if you go back,</i>
<i> say, to yesterday</i>

838
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,875
to give yourself
a great stock tip,

839
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,311
that means that
there was never
a version of reality

840
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:02,879
where you didn't
receive that.

841
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,981
- This is fucking fantastic.
- Thank you, thank you.

842
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:07,350
- Amazing.
So fucking cool.
- The other version of that--

843
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,818
thanks, man.
The other version of that

844
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,520
is the grandfather
paradox,

845
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,323
which means that no matter
what happens when you go back,

846
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:16,960
it's always a version
of what was going to happen.

847
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,962
So if you go back
and your grandfather dies,

848
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,331
that doesn't prevent you
from being born.

849
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:24,434
That just means
that something else
is going to have to happen

850
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:26,536
and it always did
and you would find out

851
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,004
that who you thought
was your grandfather

852
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,506
wasn't actually
your grandfather.

853
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:31,074
But what about
Marty mcfly?

854
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:32,642
He goes back
and he takes away

855
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,910
and he starts
disappearing.

856
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,745
What you're describing
is a depiction

857
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:38,581
of time travel in,
you know, pop culture
fiction.

858
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,016
What I'm talking about
is science.

859
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:41,951
<i> Oh, you're talking about</i>
<i> something that's real.</i>

860
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,921
<i> Um, yes, I am.</i>
<i> Uh, Ari, you had</i>
<i> a question?</i>

861
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:46,656
Adam, if time travel
existed,

862
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,692
don't you think
that we would
know about it

863
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:50,593
because someone would have
come back in time
to make us aware?

864
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:53,363
Excellent point.
We're living in what's
called the Alpha timeline.

865
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:56,433
And we haven't yet arrived
at the momentous event

866
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,101
at which
everything changes
as we know it.

867
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,937
So...

868
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,772
If that's
the Alpha timeline,

869
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:05,675
- are we over here now?

870
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,045
Can I just quickly
give a quick toast

871
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:13,116
to how fucking
interesting that is?

872
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:16,086
- Yes.
- And what a fucking cool
group of people

873
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:17,954
that Joshua
has put together
here tonight

874
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:20,523
for a good, solid
fucking late-night hang?

875
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,025
Greg:
<i> Cheers to that.</i>

876
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,127
Yeah, any--
whatever you got.

877
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:25,795
- Hey, hey, there you go.
- Totally.

878
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,797
- There you go.

879
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,160
That's the weirdest way
to wake up.

880
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:33,730
Yeah, that's my way
of saying thank you

881
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:36,533
for letting me have
a seventh-grade style,

882
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:39,169
no frenching,
no touching sleepover.

883
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,639
Yeah, dude,
no worries.

884
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,875
Seventh-grade
sleepover style.

885
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:48,478
I'm sorry that I, like,

886
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,447
totally dingleberried
onto your night.

887
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,148
Are you kidding?
That was so fun.

888
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,684
You crashed here.
No big deal, dude.

889
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,853
- Yeah.
- Why is your hand
like that?

890
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:59,789
- Move your hand.
- Because I didn't
brush my teeth.

891
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,858
Well, I don't care.
Come on.

892
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,466
What time
do you think it is?

893
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:11,568
- Okay, yeah,
you should put...

894
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,942
Can-- can I use
your toothbrush?

895
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:22,178
Of course.
It's the white
and teal one.

896
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,814
It's not like
the robot alien one
that Adam has.

897
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,484
- That guy has
a dorky toothbrush?

898
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:29,486
What a shocker.

899
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:31,488
Hello?

900
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,125
Come on in, guys.

901
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,727
- Boy: I'm hungry.
- Hello?

902
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:38,828
- You're hungry?
- Yeah.

903
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,997
Josh?

904
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,166
- - You think they're
still asleep?

905
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,902
- This is a mess.
- Oh, my god.

906
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:48,204
Hey, get him over here.
Come here, come here,
come here.

907
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:50,707
Man:<i> There is somebody</i>
<i> under the coffee table.</i>

908
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,075
<i> You're right, buddy.</i>

909
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,513
- Hey.
- Hey, I'm Eric.

910
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:57,814
Hey, I'm Aaron.

911
00:41:57,816 --> 00:41:59,215
- Aaron, hi.
- Were you sleeping? Hey.

912
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:01,217
Are you okay?
You got...

913
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:03,186
- And who's this guy?
- ...A little--
that's my son.

914
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,988
Hello. Hi.
Nice to meet you.

915
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,923
- Hi, nice to meet you.

916
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:08,825
Are you--
did you get hurt?

917
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,693
- What?
- You just have a little...

918
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,096
Oh, no.
It's just allergy season.

919
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:15,298
There's like, a gun
sitting here, man.

920
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,767
Could you do me
a huge favor, man?

921
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,536
- Could we just kind of
get this area picked up?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

922
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:22,105
Do you guys-- do you want
any of this before--
I'm joking.

923
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:24,541
- I'm all right.
- Little kids love this stuff.

924
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:26,109
-<i> Okay. </i>
- Aaron:<i> Where is Josh?</i>

925
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:27,810
Josh?

926
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:29,078
He's not
under the table.

927
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,780
That's the extent
of my knowledge.

928
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,785
I found everybody,
and I cleaned

929
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,820
the fucking bleed--
no, just--

930
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:39,722
- sorry.
- Woman:<i> Ah, hey!</i>

931
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,292
- Cleaned up my nose.
- Woman:<i> How's it going?</i>

932
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:44,260
- Here they are.

933
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:46,329
- Thanks for coming.
- Nice to see you.

934
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:47,897
- Thanks for having us.
- Yeah, man.

935
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,732
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

936
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,267
- Yeah, thanks.
- What's up, dude?

937
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,736
- What's up, man?
- Fucking lumberjack?

938
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,171
Nice to see you, man.

939
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,774
Thanks for inviting us.
Sorry we just rolled up now.

940
00:42:57,776 --> 00:43:00,176
Looks like we missed
a lot of the action, but...

941
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:02,645
- Hi. I'm Jodi.
- Oh, hi.

942
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:04,314
Hey, how's it going?
I'm Anita.

943
00:43:04,316 --> 00:43:06,015
- Hi, Anita.
- Hi.

944
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,750
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

945
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,752
How do you g--
how do you know these guys?

946
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,622
I just met Ari
in the bar last night.

947
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:14,591
In the parking lot,
actually.

948
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:16,225
Yeah, we all met.
Everybody met.

949
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:18,027
Oh, so you spent
the night?

950
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,263
- Yeah, yeah. I slept.
- We took her in.

951
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,332
With a lot of liquor
in my system.

952
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:23,967
-<i> Wow! That sounds</i>
<i> like a fun time. </i>
- Little orphan.

953
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:25,168
Little stray.

954
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,803
Um, you guys hungry?

955
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:29,305
Should we, uh, keep
the breakfast train going?

956
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:30,773
You know, I'm good.
You know what, actually,

957
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,609
my friends probably
think I'm dead.

958
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:35,345
Truly, they probably think
i am like kidnapped
and chopped up,

959
00:43:35,347 --> 00:43:37,647
- so I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

960
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,315
- But, please, do your
whole thing. I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah.

961
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:41,718
- Great to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Bye.

962
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,152
- Guys.
- See you, Jodi.

963
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,288
- Bye, Jodi.
- Do you want me
to drive you?

964
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,690
No, I'm fine.
I'm gonna walk it off.

965
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:49,626
- It'd be good.
- Are you sure?

966
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,761
- I think I should
drive you home.
- No. Why?

967
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:53,997
You're-- and now
you make me-- I'm...

968
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:56,666
- No, I'm not making any...
- I feel like I crashed
your weekend.

969
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:58,635
I'm, like, literally
not trying to stay.

970
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:00,637
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

971
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,207
- Okay. Cool life experience.

972
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:06,342
- Yeah.
- Bye.

973
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:10,113
- Over the course of the day...
- Here, you can wipe that
on here.

974
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:12,348
- Hey, Jude?
- What?

975
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,817
<i> You wanna know</i>
<i> what your uncle Greg</i>
<i> does for a living?</i>

976
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,655
- What?
- I make every candy
in the whole world.

977
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:20,189
No, he's not
your uncle Greg.

978
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:23,760
If you've tasted a candy,
i made it in my kitchen.

979
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:25,361
- Jude:<i> No. </i>
- Greg:<i> Yeah.</i>

980
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:27,797
How you doing, Josh?
Are you talking to anybody?

981
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:29,365
Are you seeing
a therapist?

982
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,734
Does tonie count,
our dealer from last night?

983
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,002
Yeah, that's perfect,
yeah.

984
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,138
Drown everything
in drugs and--

985
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,273
and that's just,
like, the best...

986
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:39,308
Oh, our Blackjack
dealer last night.
We went to a casino.

987
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,711
All I hear about is, like,
the bars you guys went to,

988
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:43,980
casino you went to.
Like, has anyone
brought this up?

989
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:46,115
<i> Like, are you guys</i>
<i> discussing this at all?</i>

990
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:47,450
<i> Or are you just pretending</i>
<i> it didn't happen?</i>

991
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:49,152
I totally hear you,
but to me,

992
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:50,386
it feels like
time and place.

993
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:52,021
I'm here to do
what Joshua wants,

994
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,991
and it seems to me
like Joshua got us together

995
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:56,359
to have a fun weekend
where we can just

996
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,194
fucking cut loose
a little bit.

997
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,962
Great.
Let's all go get drunk.

998
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:02,165
Let's also
not pretend, uh,

999
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,866
that the reason
we're here

1000
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,302
isn't something that was
super traumatic
for our buddy.

1001
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:08,471
<i> Even if he's</i>
<i> going through it quietly,</i>

1002
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:10,907
even more of a reason that
it's our responsibility

1003
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,108
to bring it up
and talk about it.

1004
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,110
Uh, thanks
for chatting out here.

1005
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:16,913
Yeah, what's up, man?
You like running
interference in there?

1006
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,181
- No.
- You're, like,
a party wing man

1007
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:20,283
- who can't get serious?
- What?

1008
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:22,885
- What's going on?
- No, I'm just here
to have a good time

1009
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,021
because that's what
Joshua seems to want
to have this weekend.

1010
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:27,356
Well, I think that
the good time happened.

1011
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:30,059
- Oh, okay.
- And I happened to meet you
under a coffee table

1012
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,495
- with a fucking bloody nose.
- And I apologized about that.

1013
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:33,963
Check off crazy party night.
You got it, man.

1014
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,832
- Okay.
- Congratulations.

1015
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:37,233
- Well, congratulations
for showing up
- 100% success.

1016
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,168
- With the family.
- What does that mean?

1017
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,970
It means this was,
like, a boy's weekend.

1018
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,905
Where did it say
boy's weekend?

1019
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,508
Where did it say
bring your wife
and four-year-old son?

1020
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,444
Where'd it say not to?
I was on all the same
emails you were.

1021
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:50,079
By the way, speaking
of my wife and kid,

1022
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,981
I don't appreciate
bringing my four-year-old

1023
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:54,383
into a room
that's, like, coated
in cocaine powder

1024
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:56,786
and having to basically
pry a gun out of his hand

1025
00:45:56,788 --> 00:45:58,287
and move the bong
out of the way!

1026
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,156
You think-- you think
i would have just, like--

1027
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,390
if I knew your kid
were coming,

1028
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:02,892
I would have
laid out drugs...

1029
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:06,829
You offered him cocaine!
He is four years old!

1030
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:08,531
- As a joke!
- Yeah, I suspect
that you would've...

1031
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:10,767
My big mistake
is realizing

1032
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,369
that your son had
the same fucking lame
sense of humor as you

1033
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:14,804
- oh, yeah, that's really funny.
- And couldn't get a joke.

1034
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:17,006
Yeah, that's awesome, man.
What a cool guy.

1035
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:18,541
- But maybe
if he wants to get---
- hey, nice to meet you, buddy.

1036
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:20,343
- Nice to meet you too, man.
- You know what?

1037
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:22,178
Go fucking
do some more cocaine
and fuck yourself.

1038
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,947
All right, bud.
Good hangs!

1039
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,917
- Jude: Where are we going?
- All right, is he buckled up?

1040
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:29,018
Yes.

1041
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:41,497
- Eric:<i> There you go, baby. </i>
- Greg:<i> Yeah!</i>

1042
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:44,167
- That's a capper.
- Ooh, ditty, ditty,
ditty, ditty.

1043
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:46,302
I didn't mean to step
on your shit, Eric.

1044
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:49,372
I just feel taking mushrooms
and chilling out is, like--

1045
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:52,141
- I don't want to go anywhere.
- No. I totally get it.

1046
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,911
And you know what?
Like, we did some
boozing last night,

1047
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:56,445
and I think mushrooms
are the play.

1048
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,856
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you, bud?

1049
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:09,892
Thanks for, uh,
coming to fix this.

1050
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:11,961
Oh, no problem.
It's just an
electrical problem.

1051
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:13,596
It's not much wrong.

1052
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:15,531
Sorry, you're kind of
getting stuck

1053
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:18,301
with the only guy
who doesn't really
enjoy the hot tub.

1054
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:19,602
<i> I hear you, man.</i>

1055
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:21,437
No, but I'll get
your balances just perfect

1056
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:24,273
and you'll be
in this thing in about
an hour with your buddies.

1057
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,876
I don't really like
getting in it myself.

1058
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:30,146
You know, just because
of the amount of bacteria

1059
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:32,114
that lives
in warm still water

1060
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:33,583
and, you know, the way
that the kind of heat

1061
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:36,986
breeds a cloud
of disease that just
hovers above it.

1062
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:39,922
Yeah, well,
i guess hot tubs
aren't for everyone.

1063
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:42,358
Yeah, i--
i can agree to that.

1064
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,927
- Definitely not for me.
- It was really nice
to meet you.

1065
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:47,196
Do you mind
if I sit here with you
while you work

1066
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,932
or-- or would you
rather work alone?

1067
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,370
Yeah, whatever
you'd like.

1068
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,440
Eric:
<i> Can I take</i>
<i> a picture of you?</i>

1069
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,176
Sure.

1070
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,950
- So what happened?
- What?

1071
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:10,353
- With, uh,
what's her name?
- Oh, Rachel.

1072
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:12,989
Rachel. What'd she do?
How'd she die?

1073
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:14,523
How'd she do it,
i mean?

1074
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:17,526
Well, um,

1075
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:22,131
she-- she was cooking dinner
for him on his birthday,

1076
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,500
and he went down
to the gym

1077
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:27,403
and when he came back,
she was dead.

1078
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,372
Pull!

1079
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:32,375
-<i> That's so awful. </i>
- Yeah, it's a bummer.

1080
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:34,443
Her parents are kind of
giving him a hard time.

1081
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:36,979
Why? They think
he did something?

1082
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:38,581
I think it must be hard

1083
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:41,984
to, like,
admit that your child

1084
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:45,087
is sick like that
enough to do something, so...

1085
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,624
Oh, god, I can't believe
that I said all that stuff,

1086
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:50,259
- like...
- What stuff?

1087
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,395
Just, like,
congratulations,

1088
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:54,664
- and I called her
a fucking bitch.
- Oh, don't worry, dude.

1089
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:56,265
Joshy is--

1090
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,267
- he didn't even
register it.

1091
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,502
- He's like...
- That's what I do,
though, you know?

1092
00:48:59,504 --> 00:49:02,271
That's what I do.
I start talking,

1093
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,673
and I don't
stop talking.

1094
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:05,308
- How'd she do it?
-<i> Huh?</i>

1095
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,943
How'd she do it?
How'd she kill herself?

1096
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:08,644
Oh, I don't know if
that's the best place to...

1097
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:11,681
I gotta know.
I gotta know.

1098
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:14,617
- Well, she...
- I'm just gonna be wondering
about it the whole day,

1099
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,686
and I don't want that
to be in my mind.

1100
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:19,588
She asphyxiated herself.

1101
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,058
Oh, my god.

1102
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,492
Are you kidding me?

1103
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:25,161
What, with a bag?

1104
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:27,563
I don't wanna get
into the details, man.

1105
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:29,465
- I'm starting to feel...
-<i> I gotta know.</i>

1106
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:31,701
-<i> What, with a rope? </i>
- A belt.

1107
00:49:31,703 --> 00:49:35,438
-<i> One of his belts. </i>
- Oh, my god, his belt.

1108
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,141
Used his belt
to kill herself.

1109
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:43,112
Oh, I'm feeling so weird
in my stomach right now.

1110
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:46,315
- Yeah.
- I feel like I'm
just about to explode.

1111
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,751
- My stomach.
- ...This'll be really hard.

1112
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:52,655
- Oh, my stomach.

1113
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,590
Greg:
There's no such thing
as time travel.

1114
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:58,427
Everything is gonna
stay the way it is.

1115
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,596
You can't
correct anything.

1116
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:04,233
I can't go back
and make anything right.

1117
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:07,136
<i> They told me they were</i>
<i> a good idea to hire</i>

1118
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:09,538
<i> because they're getting</i>
<i> something pretty to look at,</i>

1119
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,641
<i> and they'd make us</i>
<i> look cooler than anybody else.</i>

1120
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:30,626
My father
went in a hot tub

1121
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,428
and started feeling
something strange
in his leg

1122
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:35,264
and a few days later,
it had grown to a boil

1123
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:36,799
the size of
a ping-pong ball.

1124
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:40,636
And my uncle
just rolled it
with a rolling pin

1125
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:43,406
and when it popped,
pus hit the ceiling.

1126
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:48,277
Wow, a disgusting story.

1127
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:51,614
You should have never
put their pictures
online, Ari!

1128
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:53,649
My marriage is over!

1129
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:56,052
Greg, Greg, Greg.

1130
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,261
Adam:<i> It was 10 years</i>
<i> of being together,</i>

1131
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:08,597
<i> and her main argument</i>
<i> was that she felt</i>

1132
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:10,533
<i> like she'd missed out</i>
<i> on her 20s.</i>

1133
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:13,302
<i> Not entirely,</i>
<i> but in a way that was scary</i>

1134
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:15,404
<i> as she started entering</i>
<i> into her 30s</i>

1135
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,740
and just, I guess,
wondered what else
was out there.

1136
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,543
Imagine the fun
when you meet
somebody like you

1137
00:51:20,545 --> 00:51:23,112
who is fully able
to commit.

1138
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:25,414
- Yeah.
- You'll have something
that you never had

1139
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,783
with this other woman,
no disrespect to
what you guys had.

1140
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:29,585
No, you can disrespect her
all you want now.

1141
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:32,288
<i> For now, the question</i>
<i> is just where do I go?</i>

1142
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,290
Repairman:
<i> You're gonna be just fine.</i>

1143
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,505
...look amazing.

1144
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:51,474
- Amazing, like,
all the time?
- Yeah.

1145
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:53,175
- Yes.
- Jodi.

1146
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:55,311
- Hey, happy birthday,
right?
- Hi.

1147
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:57,680
- Yes, it's my birthday.
- Hey, Jodi.

1148
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,415
Hey, thank you.

1149
00:51:59,417 --> 00:52:02,184
- Happy birthday to everyone.
- This is Jen and Ali.

1150
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:03,519
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1151
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:06,388
- Hi. Oh, okay.
- Hey.

1152
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:08,190
- To my happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1153
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:09,792
- Adam!
- This is Ari.

1154
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:11,293
- Jen.
- Hi.

1155
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,362
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hi, Adam.

1156
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:15,197
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1157
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:16,832
- This is Jen and Ali.
- Hi.

1158
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:17,833
- Hi.
- Jen.

1159
00:52:17,835 --> 00:52:19,668
Adam.

1160
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:20,703
- Can I talk to you
for a second?
- Sure.

1161
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:21,804
Awesome.

1162
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,539
- Am I in trouble?
- No.

1163
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:25,841
- Do you want me to sit here?
- Uh, sure, yeah. Why?

1164
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:27,843
Great.

1165
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:30,613
I've been wanting to
apply for this position
for a long time.

1166
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:32,481
I'm-- I'm Adam.

1167
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:38,554
Did-- did Jodi mention me
at all to one of you?

1168
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:40,222
No?

1169
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:41,790
Because we had
a nice little
conversation last night

1170
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,692
where she mentioned
that she had a friend

1171
00:52:43,694 --> 00:52:47,363
who she felt, like,
might sort of be
the kind of person

1172
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:50,799
who would be interested
in talking to a guy like me.

1173
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:54,236
I'm wondering
if it's you.

1174
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:56,805
<i> Or if it is you?</i>

1175
00:52:56,807 --> 00:52:58,707
Guys, we gotta
rally here, okay?

1176
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,843
- Energy is low.
- I'm good.

1177
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,344
- You're good.
- You're the only one

1178
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,446
that's fucking good
right now, Joshua.

1179
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:06,949
- Yeah.
- But this guy,
comatose Carl,

1180
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:09,785
come on, man.
We gotta get some
drinks in us, all right?

1181
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,387
Happy birthday.

1182
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:13,589
- Can I open this?
- Yeah, sure.

1183
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:16,725
Is this a cd mix?

1184
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:18,594
Yes, it is a cd mix.

1185
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:21,664
Does this mean
you have a time machine
back to 1998?

1186
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:23,732
No, I just--
my computer's really old,

1187
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:27,403
so it does have
the capabilities
of burning cds.

1188
00:53:27,405 --> 00:53:30,372
You should be more impressed
that I actually found a...

1189
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,608
- A cd?
- A blank cd, yeah.

1190
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,646
Oh, thank you so much.

1191
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:40,282
- Just my size.
- And that is from
my private collection.

1192
00:53:40,284 --> 00:53:42,952
That's a big fatty.
Thank you so much.

1193
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:46,288
It actually is
the loveliest
birthday present

1194
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:48,290
that I ever
could have asked for.

1195
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:50,759
It's very nice.

1196
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:53,462
Looking at the history
of ancient aliens,

1197
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:55,664
you have to imagine
that every visit from them

1198
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,566
- kicked off
a major new phase
- oh.

1199
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,568
In human advancement.

1200
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,704
You know,
and there's examples of it

1201
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:04,540
basically
at every huge leap

1202
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:06,575
that we've taken
as a civilization.

1203
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,844
The most notable example,
i guess, that I could reference

1204
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:11,247
- is something like
the pyramids.
- Yeah.

1205
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:12,748
I get it.
You're preaching
to the choir.

1206
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,483
There's
just clearly no way

1207
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:17,453
that normal
ancient Egyptians
could have conceived of...

1208
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:19,421
There's no way
that humans
with human hands

1209
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,390
can build
fucking pyramids.
It's crazy.

1210
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:23,926
- I'm gonna go.
- Not only have they
lasted longer

1211
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,928
than everything else
that was built around them,

1212
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,797
just they're simply not
what anything would have
looked like at the time.

1213
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:33,669
And here's the thing that's
going to blow your mind...

1214
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:37,439
- You like that?
- Yeah, it's nice.

1215
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,742
I usually button
in another direction, but...

1216
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:41,543
Shh.

1217
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:43,312
- Are we...
- Shh.

1218
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:46,048
- Almost due
for another one?
- Shh.

1219
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,017
We should have gone
to the vineyard.

1220
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:49,485
That's all I asked.

1221
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:50,953
It's, like, people think
i just come up

1222
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:52,421
with these things
arbitrarily,

1223
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:53,622
like, "let's go
to a vineyard." No.

1224
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,658
I do the research, okay?

1225
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,959
If we'd gone
to the vineyard,

1226
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,694
we wouldn't have
eaten mushrooms,

1227
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:00,596
you wouldn't have
lost your fucking mind.

1228
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:02,598
<i> It's just, like,</i>
<i> people don't listen to me.</i>

1229
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,766
<i> All I'm</i>
<i> trying to do is</i>

1230
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:07,503
<i> create a fun,</i>
<i> dynamic weekend.</i>

1231
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:10,005
I did--
i did wanna, um,

1232
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:11,507
tell you
something, though.

1233
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:13,509
Okay.

1234
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:17,946
I didn't get a chance
to tell you last night...

1235
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:20,849
But I think you
should know

1236
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:22,484
that I am married.

1237
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,854
I wanted to tell you
last night,

1238
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:27,523
but everything was
a little crazy.

1239
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:29,058
And it's hard.

1240
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:32,561
Like, when do you--
when are you supposed to
say that?

1241
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,065
Big time.

1242
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:38,100
I'm sorry, that's--
that's my fault.

1243
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:40,336
- No.
- Yeah, it's--
i should've--

1244
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:44,373
there's a million things
i should-- I should have...

1245
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:45,941
That's okay.

1246
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:49,578
It's o--
like, I get that...

1247
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,980
Definitely,
it is weird.

1248
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:54,817
And I'm, like,
holding my face.

1249
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:57,820
But it's also,
i get...

1250
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,789
Um, you know...

1251
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,959
Like, I know you.

1252
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,834
Like, I know
I've never met you,

1253
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:13,068
but I know you.

1254
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,107
Well...

1255
00:56:18,109 --> 00:56:20,075
That's, like,
very heavy shit

1256
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:23,011
to throw down
right now.

1257
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,947
Um...

1258
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:28,384
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I feel
a little embarrassed

1259
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:29,985
that your friends
all knew.

1260
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:33,722
- I feel, like, stupid.
- I'm sorry.

1261
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,859
It's probably
weirder for you
than it is for me.

1262
00:56:36,861 --> 00:56:38,727
Yeah.

1263
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,930
And I think
you're a nice person.

1264
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:46,135
And I don't really
know what else to say

1265
00:56:46,137 --> 00:56:49,004
'cause I feel,
like, very weird.

1266
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:50,906
But, anyhow,

1267
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:54,710
I do have a birthday
to celebrate.

1268
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:57,413
And you have,

1269
00:56:57,415 --> 00:57:00,682
yeah, you know.
Thanks.

1270
00:57:00,684 --> 00:57:04,153
It's cool.
You're good.

1271
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,158
- Happy birthday.
-<i> Thank you.</i>

1272
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,792
- Oh!
- Jen: Oh.

1273
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,128
- Everything's
all right, though.
-<i> I'm good, yeah, I'm good.</i>

1274
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,797
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

1275
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,799
- Do you need anything?
- Uh, nope.

1276
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,201
You want,
like, a water

1277
00:57:52,203 --> 00:57:53,836
or just, like, even
a piece of bread maybe?

1278
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:55,170
Jen:
<i> No, I don't want</i>
<i> any water.</i>

1279
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:57,139
You might wanna watch
your boots on the couch.

1280
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:59,675
We don't wanna scuff it up
and lose our deposit.

1281
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:01,210
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm really fine.

1282
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:02,811
Um...

1283
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:06,014
I'm good, yeah.

1284
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,119
Eric:
Hey, buddy.

1285
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,024
- Hey, man.
What are you doing?
- Hey.

1286
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:18,026
Oh, um, she passed out,

1287
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:21,129
so I don't want her boots
fucking up the couch

1288
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:22,965
and we lose our
security deposit.

1289
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:25,100
- So I'm taking them off.
- Yeah, that's pretty creepy.

1290
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:26,568
No, no,
it's not creepy.

1291
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:27,836
- I just...
- No, in a good way.

1292
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,671
- Oh, thanks.
- Where's your iPod?

1293
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:32,608
- Uh, why?
- Because I wanna
put music on.

1294
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,977
- Where's yours?
- I just have my iPhone,

1295
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:36,144
and it's a streaming
music service.

1296
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:37,613
I don't get
reception up here,

1297
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:39,548
so just tell me
where your iPod is.

1298
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:40,716
I mean, I'm sure
it's in my room,

1299
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:41,817
- but I don't--
- okay, great.

1300
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:43,785
But don't go
to my room. Don't...

1301
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,788
Hey, buddy,

1302
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,690
you're being a real
fucking wet blanket, okay?

1303
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,292
And it's getting
really, really tough

1304
00:58:50,294 --> 00:58:53,128
to keep everything going
with you being
a wet blanket

1305
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,963
and these ingrates
with no ideas
of their own.

1306
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:56,765
Yeah, and everyone
appreciates that,

1307
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:59,234
but, you know, like,
maybe tonight's
just a wash.

1308
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:00,936
Like, it's pretty late.
People are tired.

1309
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:03,238
We don't need music put on.
Maybe the night's just over.

1310
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,240
Trust me,
the night is not over.

1311
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,610
It doesn't matter--

1312
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:10,979
- it's just...
- What the fuck
am I doing here?

1313
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:12,548
I thought you were
taking me home.

1314
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,616
To our home.
I thought you
wanted to come here.

1315
00:59:14,618 --> 00:59:15,884
No. I thought
you were taking me--

1316
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,553
I thought you were
walking me home, my home.

1317
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:19,555
- Where's my fucking shoe?
- It's right here.

1318
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:21,223
- Did you take my shoes off?
- Just the one.

1319
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:23,158
I took it off
because it was
scuffing up the couch.

1320
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,993
- Give me that.
- As long as you
were passed out,

1321
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:26,662
- you want to get comfortable.
- You took off my shoes.

1322
00:59:26,664 --> 00:59:28,163
You're a fucking creep.
Is that what you do?

1323
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:29,331
You go to bars
and pretend like

1324
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,867
you're a charming,
artistic nerd?

1325
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:33,602
<i> And then you lure people</i>
<i> back to your house?</i>

1326
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:35,304
You know, let's not start
with the name calling.

1327
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:37,973
- And I'm not a nerd.
- No, you're not a nerd.

1328
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:39,274
- You're a fucking psychopath.
- Everything's fine.

1329
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:42,778
- Get the fuck off me!
- Are you okay?

1330
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,813
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Can I drive you home?

1331
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:46,315
- No, I don't need you
to fucking drive me.
- Oh, shit.

1332
00:59:46,317 --> 00:59:48,183
- I know how to walk.
- Ari:<i> Oh!</i>

1333
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:51,687
- It's a rental.
- You wanna
borrow a coat?

1334
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,961
- What did you do?
- I think she likes me.

1335
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,666
- Man:<i> Eric? </i>
- Hey, yes. Come on in.

1336
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:07,736
Hi. If you could just
quickly come in here.

1337
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:10,973
- How are you?
- Hey, how are you?

1338
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:13,175
I'm good. Nice to see you.
I'm Eric. Come on in.

1339
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:14,943
Greg?

1340
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:18,213
- Oh, my god.
- Eric, what did you do?

1341
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:20,015
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

1342
01:00:20,017 --> 01:00:23,218
- Greg, lights, please.
- Adam:<i> Hey, that's my iPod.</i>

1343
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:27,389
- - Gentlemen, let's welcome
to the stage,

1344
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:32,127
Kylie and crystal!

1345
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,962
- Oh, my god.
- That's right.

1346
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,765
- Hi, ladies.
Come on in!
- Hi.

1347
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:38,967
- Hi.
- Eric:<i> This is Joshua.</i>

1348
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:42,771
- It's his lucky day.
- Oh, you must be
the one getting married.

1349
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:45,173
- Eric:<i> Aw. </i>
- Congratulations!

1350
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:46,375
- Mm-wah.
- Lucky guy.

1351
01:00:46,377 --> 01:00:48,343
Wow.

1352
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:51,279
- Eric:<i> Please, unpack,</i>
<i> ladies, unpack. </i>
- Woman:<i> Okay.</i>

1353
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:54,683
Hey, will you guys
let your friend outside

1354
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:57,319
- know that we're here?
- I'm sorry. What?

1355
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:59,254
The suspicious-looking one.

1356
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:02,424
I'm sorry,
I'm not catching
a word of this.

1357
01:01:02,426 --> 01:01:05,994
I mean, suspicious
compared to the way
you guys look.

1358
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,295
- Give it a slap.
- Okay.

1359
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:09,297
- Double.

1360
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:12,768
- Do you want a dance?
- You don't have to,
you know?

1361
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:15,337
<i> You can just-- you don't</i>
<i> have to do all this.</i>
<i> You can just hang out.</i>

1362
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:16,872
It's just whatever
makes you feel
comfortable.

1363
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:18,940
I mean, I assume
you got paid either way.

1364
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:20,942
- Woman:<i> What do you want,</i>
<i> though, sweetie? </i>
- Look.

1365
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:22,678
You can dance
while you're doing it
or you can just

1366
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,247
- sit perfectly still.
- You need someone to talk to?

1367
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:27,749
- Always.
- When you have
a bunch of thoughts

1368
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:29,985
and you don't know
what to do with them,
just crush them.

1369
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:32,054
And then you align
the thoughts, you know?

1370
01:01:32,056 --> 01:01:34,022
And then you make
logic of it. Look.

1371
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,724
- You see one
thought over here.
- Yeah, totally.

1372
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:37,325
- Another thought over here.
- Yep.

1373
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:40,328
If we make four thoughts,
we can have two thoughts each.

1374
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,698
Two thoughts each, okay.

1375
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,166
You kind of look
like my boyfriend.

1376
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:46,268
- Adam:<i> I do? </i>
-<i> Yeah.</i>

1377
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:48,770
- Ladies.
- Adam:<i> You're dating</i>
<i> someone who resembles me?</i>

1378
01:01:48,772 --> 01:01:51,073
Oh, yeah.
Not only dating,
he lives with us.

1379
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:54,009
<i> He's a really good</i>
<i> step-dad to my daughter.</i>

1380
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:55,844
- You smell so good.
- How do we differ?

1381
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:57,946
I mean, does he dress like me
or does he sound like me?

1382
01:01:57,948 --> 01:02:00,449
- Oh, he's Mexican.
- Okay, that's one
crucial difference.

1383
01:02:00,451 --> 01:02:04,019
Woman:<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> I have to give her</i>
<i> Insulin shots every morning.</i>

1384
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:06,755
Adam, your music sucks.
We got to change to
a new song, buddy.

1385
01:02:06,757 --> 01:02:09,191
<i> She also has</i>
<i> a really bad</i>
<i> lung condition.</i>

1386
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:11,226
- See what we got
on the next one.
- Adam:<i> I'm sorry, what?</i>

1387
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,462
Classical?
Come on, man!

1388
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:15,797
This song sucks, too.
What's on your iPod?

1389
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:17,332
Well, you--
it's just on shuffle,

1390
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:19,267
so I don't know what's
gonna come up.

1391
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:21,837
Well, I didn't know
that when I grabbed
your shitty iPod

1392
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,238
that all the songs
would fucking blow!

1393
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,773
Yeah, it's almost like

1394
01:02:24,775 --> 01:02:27,008
when I was putting music
on my iPod a year ago,

1395
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:29,478
I wasn't thinking about
fun stripper songs!

1396
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,279
Eric:
<i> No, you didn't do that!</i>
<i> You didn't plan anything</i>

1397
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:33,348
<i> except to play</i>
<i> your fucking board game,</i>

1398
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,884
<i> just like nobody here</i>
<i> planned anything</i>
<i> except for me!</i>

1399
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:38,353
<i> I try to do</i>
<i> one nice thing</i>
<i> for everybody!</i>

1400
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:42,424
-<i> Bring strippers,</i>
<i> fucking turn this... </i>
- May I have this dance?

1401
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:14,790
Don't insult
my fucking friendship

1402
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,424
with somebody
that you don't
even know that well!

1403
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:17,859
<i> Where the fuck</i>
<i> do you even get off</i>

1404
01:03:17,861 --> 01:03:20,028
<i> coming in here</i>
<i> with this bullshit?</i>

1405
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,531
It's just-- you know what?
I don't need to stand here
and be shouted at!

1406
01:03:22,533 --> 01:03:24,266
I'll take my fucking iPod.
It's insufficient.

1407
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:26,134
I'm sorry it's not
good enough for you.

1408
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,970
Take your ball!
Go home and play
kickball by yourself

1409
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,906
- with your little dickey!
- Adam, wait up.

1410
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:33,408
Hey. No, that's fine.
He's, like, sulking.

1411
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,509
I think he needs
some company.

1412
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:36,344
No. He just wants
to go to bed.

1413
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,880
He's actually kind of lame.
And I'm not being
shady right now,

1414
01:03:38,882 --> 01:03:41,383
but I'm gonna kind of,
like, not let you go
up there right now.

1415
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:42,984
- You're not gonna
let me go by?
- No.

1416
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:46,054
Crystal! Kylie!
Let's go!<i> Vmonos.</i>

1417
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:47,889
Thank you.

1418
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:49,891
- Have a good honeymoon.
- Oh, thank you.

1419
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:51,560
I'm not getting--
aw, fuck it.

1420
01:03:51,562 --> 01:03:53,895
- Bye.
- Bye. It was good
to meet you.

1421
01:03:57,434 --> 01:04:01,336
Sorry, pal.
Sorry about that.

1422
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:05,607
Wait. I think there's
someone out there.

1423
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:07,843
<i> Look, there's</i>
<i> someone right there.</i>
<i> Look, he's running away.</i>

1424
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:09,411
- I see him. Grab the gun.
- Who the fuck is that?

1425
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:11,446
- Uh...
-<i> Oh, come on.</i>

1426
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:52,487
Hey, come out.
Come out.

1427
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:53,955
We see you, man.
We see you.

1428
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:55,891
We see you.
We fucking see you.

1429
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:57,359
- Holy shit.
- Ow! Ow!

1430
01:04:57,361 --> 01:05:00,495
All right, all right,
it's cool.

1431
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:01,930
Who the fuck
are you, man?

1432
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:04,099
Okay, it's cool.
It's just nature.

1433
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:06,334
- What?
- It's nature?

1434
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:08,904
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Oh, oh, he's running.

1435
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:11,039
- Ow!
- Josh:<i> What do we do?</i>
<i> Do we go after him?</i>

1436
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:13,074
No, no, no.
Let's fucking
let him go.

1437
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,577
- Oh. Whoa.
- What the fuck, man?

1438
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:45,440
So I wanted to,

1439
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,709
ahem, apologize

1440
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:49,611
for my behavior
last night with you.

1441
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:51,680
I was very aggressive

1442
01:05:51,682 --> 01:05:53,481
and yelling at you

1443
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:55,250
and sort of
pushing you around.

1444
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:57,686
And it wasn't cool
and so I wanted

1445
01:05:57,688 --> 01:06:00,088
to say I'm sorry
about that.

1446
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,657
Yeah, i-- I appreciate
you apologizing.

1447
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:05,126
You know,
i mean, obviously,

1448
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:06,361
I know that
my idea of fun

1449
01:06:06,363 --> 01:06:08,330
isn't the same
as everybody else's,

1450
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:10,432
<i> but the fact that</i>
<i> you can say this</i>
<i> to me now</i>

1451
01:06:10,434 --> 01:06:12,667
really is
much appreciated.

1452
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:14,636
- So thank you.
- Yeah, and you--

1453
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:17,472
- you don't have to
apologize to me.
- Okay, great.

1454
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,708
Yeah, I'm really going
through some stuff, too.

1455
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:24,179
And I just--
I'm sorry if my energy,

1456
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:26,681
especially yesterday
and last night,

1457
01:06:26,683 --> 01:06:29,718
was, you know,
getting in the way
of you having any fun.

1458
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,020
Sure. No, I appreciate
you guys both saying that.

1459
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:33,455
I think tonight is
actually gonna be

1460
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:36,658
a very cathartic release
for all of us.

1461
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,660
- Mm.
- Adam:<i> Yeah,</i>
<i> that'd be nice.</i>

1462
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,462
Just sort of relax.

1463
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:42,764
On that note,
all right.

1464
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:44,466
I'm gonna go take care
of something.

1465
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:47,202
<i> See you guys, uh,</i>
<i> for dinner.</i>

1466
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,207
I think maybe
I'm ready to get out.

1467
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:54,609
I don't wanna get
swimmer's cough
or anything.

1468
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:58,279
Yeah, let's get out.

1469
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:05,320
- Hello.
- Woman:<i> Hi.</i>

1470
01:07:05,322 --> 01:07:07,155
- Come on in.
- Are you frank?

1471
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:08,656
I am frank.
Are you...

1472
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:10,291
- I'm Isadora.
- Isadora.

1473
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:12,060
- Hi.
- Hi. Come here.

1474
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:13,628
You look great.

1475
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:16,064
This is exactly my style.
I'm not kidding.

1476
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:17,499
- Really?
- I love that you guys
have paintings.

1477
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:19,801
- That's so beautiful.
- I love paintings.

1478
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:22,137
Do you really?
I do, too.
I prefer that.

1479
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:24,272
It's like
if I see a blank wall,
it bums me out.

1480
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:25,507
- Yeah.
- This is very cool.

1481
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:27,175
- Yeah.
- Oh, it's a lot of necks.

1482
01:07:27,177 --> 01:07:29,277
- It's very...
- It's like dogs
playing poker,

1483
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:31,513
- but people.
- Right.

1484
01:07:31,515 --> 01:07:33,782
- And here are two other
works of art right here.
- This is awesome.

1485
01:07:33,784 --> 01:07:38,353
- Hi.
- Greg, Adam,
this is, uh, Isadora.

1486
01:07:38,355 --> 01:07:41,089
Hi, I'm Isadora. Hi.
Oh, nice to meet you.

1487
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:42,724
- Hi. I'm Greg.
- Greg.

1488
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:44,626
Oh, my god,
you have a twin.

1489
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:46,795
My sister's
best friend Nicky
looks a lot like you.

1490
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:49,731
- A woman? I look...
- Yeah, she's a girl.

1491
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,800
You know,
i always thought

1492
01:07:51,802 --> 01:07:54,702
that I had
ape features.

1493
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:56,371
That's how
I've always seen myself.

1494
01:07:56,373 --> 01:07:57,772
Yeah, you do,
but just, like--

1495
01:07:57,774 --> 01:07:59,707
it's like Nicky, too,
but a beautiful ape.

1496
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:01,810
Apes are
the most beautiful
creatures on this planet.

1497
01:08:01,812 --> 01:08:03,411
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

1498
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,547
You got
ape hands, too.

1499
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:07,449
I do?

1500
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:09,417
- It's a total compliment.
- I'm sorry.

1501
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:13,688
- Did I miss something?
- Oh, um, Isadora here
is a sex worker,

1502
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,423
and she's gonna
fuck us all for money.

1503
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:17,492
- Absolutely, but not nec--
- or whoever wants...

1504
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:18,860
It doesn't have to be--
if you don't wanna fuck,

1505
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:20,662
if you wanna--
i got a lot of
different holes,

1506
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:22,430
you know what I'm saying?
So don't worry about it.

1507
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,365
You can do something
with my feet or anal.

1508
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,301
Whatever you're into.
Also, I wanna say this

1509
01:08:26,303 --> 01:08:27,802
'cause I feel like
this definitely helps
when I say this

1510
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:29,304
is that do not worry
about money.

1511
01:08:29,306 --> 01:08:31,272
Please put that
out of your head
right now.

1512
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,707
Don't start tallying it up
like, "oh, can i
do this to her?"

1513
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:34,209
It's gonna add it up.
Don't worry.

1514
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:35,376
I just
wanna let you know

1515
01:08:35,378 --> 01:08:37,579
that what I'm
into doing

1516
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:40,348
is whatever you are
into doing.

1517
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:44,219
Whatever relaxes you,
makes you comfortable,
pleases you.

1518
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:45,720
Thank you for saying that.
I appreciate that a lot.

1519
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:47,322
- That is very cool of you.
- You're welcome.

1520
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:49,290
I'm gonna
take you up on that.
Thank you so much.

1521
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,759
- Hey, please do.
- I would love
to start with you

1522
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:54,596
just because I feel like,
um-- is that okay?

1523
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:56,331
- Um, I think
that would be good.
- Sure.

1524
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,800
- That'd be great.
- Can I get, um, uh,

1525
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:00,768
is there a little room
i can clean--

1526
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:02,871
- yeah.
- Not clean up.
I'm not dirty, I swear.

1527
01:09:02,873 --> 01:09:06,207
Of course you're not dirty.
Nobody would ever think
that you're dirty.

1528
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:07,742
I'll show you
to the bathroom.

1529
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:09,777
No, no.
I'll do it.

1530
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,779
- Eric:<i> Great. </i>
- Yeah.

1531
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:13,381
- Isadora: Cool.
- Okay, cool.

1532
01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:15,316
- All right.
- Right this way.

1533
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:17,152
- Great.
Thank you so much.
- Madame.

1534
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:18,887
- See you in a bit, buddy.
- God, I love this.

1535
01:09:18,889 --> 01:09:20,889
I think I'm just
gonna go for a hike.

1536
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:23,258
- This-- yeah,
this isn't for me.
- What?

1537
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,693
I know. I know.
I-- I figured it was
worth one last shot

1538
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:26,928
to see if I could
get you laid,

1539
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:28,830
but I could tell
it's not your thing.

1540
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,199
Sure, I appreciate it.
You know, it's very
nice of you

1541
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:33,668
to, you know,
be thinking of everyone's
pleasure all the time, but...

1542
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,503
She seems cool, though,
i mean, honestly...

1543
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,238
She seems great.
I think it'll be
a lot of fun

1544
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,408
for you guys
to have sex with her
one after the other.

1545
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,610
- But I'll just be outside.
-<i> Okay, buddy.</i>

1546
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:45,647
Hi, Jodi, hi.

1547
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:46,781
Hi, it's Ari.

1548
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:48,883
I know i--
I've been

1549
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,785
kind of stalking you,

1550
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:52,320
but i-- I, um...

1551
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,427
No, I know, I know.

1552
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:01,329
I was--
i gave him a, um--

1553
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:03,431
why am I blanking?
A hand job, a handy,
whatever,

1554
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:05,333
you know what I mean?
I-- and I was--

1555
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:07,402
and he was
sobbing and coming
and sobbing and coming,

1556
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:09,404
and it was so profound

1557
01:10:09,406 --> 01:10:11,539
to see what you
could do to somebody,

1558
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,374
you know, that's
not just about--
i was, like--

1559
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,343
I mean, obviously,
I'm sure he was
glad he came,

1560
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:18,580
but to know
that it was so much
more emotional than that,

1561
01:10:18,582 --> 01:10:19,948
- so-- hi.
- Hi.

1562
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:22,550
- Hi. I'm Isadora, hi. Hi.
- Hi.

1563
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:24,552
Nice to meet you.
Oh, good, this is good.

1564
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,688
- The more,
the merrier, good.
- Oh.

1565
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:29,290
- Um, all right.
- Eric:<i> So do you</i>
<i> see yourself</i>

1566
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:31,693
- as like a healer?
- Yes.

1567
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:32,794
But, like,
sex stuff too, right?

1568
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:34,929
Yes, yes, yes!
Oh, my god.

1569
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:36,931
- I love-- oh, my god,
oh, I love you.

1570
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:38,499
- I love that you
said that because...
- Ahem, uh,

1571
01:10:38,501 --> 01:10:40,635
Rachel's parents are here.
They're outside.

1572
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:42,537
- They're here now.
I'm gonna go tell Josh.
- Ari:<i> What?</i>

1573
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:44,973
Eric:
<i> But, like, you'll do,</i>
<i> like, fun stuff and...</i>

1574
01:10:44,975 --> 01:10:47,942
Isadora:
<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah,</i>
<i> anything that you need...</i>

1575
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:49,444
Joshy?

1576
01:10:49,446 --> 01:10:51,646
Joshy!

1577
01:10:51,648 --> 01:10:53,348
We gotta clean up!
We gotta clean up!

1578
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,582
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.

1579
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:56,718
- Not on my account?
- No, we...

1580
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,920
- Honestly, don't.
- We're gonna have you
go to the bathroom.

1581
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,888
-<i> We're just gonna do</i>
<i> a little cleanup. </i>
-<i> Oh, I've gone.</i>

1582
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,957
I'm very cleansed out
before I ever come to
any sort of...

1583
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:05,660
I know.
I just want you to have a--
last looks in there.

1584
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,497
Dude, the weed?
We gotta get rid
of this coke, bud.

1585
01:11:09,499 --> 01:11:10,965
- Come on.
- What are we doing?

1586
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:12,767
Ari:
<i> Sit the fuck down</i>
<i> and just be...</i>

1587
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,469
Eric:
<i> Can I just ask</i>
<i> why are we freaking out?</i>

1588
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:16,337
Ari:<i> Sit the fuck down, Eric! </i>

1589
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:17,839
Why are we freaking out
like we're in trouble?
It's just parents!

1590
01:11:17,841 --> 01:11:19,040
Please!

1591
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:24,946
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

1592
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:27,382
- Hey, joshy.
- Hi.

1593
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:29,284
- Long time.
- Yeah.

1594
01:11:29,286 --> 01:11:31,619
- It's been a while.
- We knew you were here, so...

1595
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,454
- We spoke to your mother
and, you know,
- yes.

1596
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,456
She mentioned
that you were here
and we thought...

1597
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,659
- That you were here
vacationing.
- Thought maybe it's time to...

1598
01:11:37,661 --> 01:11:40,595
- Clear the air.
- Clear the air, exactly.

1599
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:42,563
- Um, yeah.
- I have pictures for you.

1600
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:44,565
-<i> Come in and, uh, sure. </i>
- Woman:<i> Oh.</i>

1601
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:46,868
- Thank you.
- Yeah, just some
friends are here.

1602
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,603
- Oh, yeah, this is, uh...
- Should we just say hi
and then we can...?

1603
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:54,542
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1604
01:11:54,544 --> 01:11:56,978
So this is, uh,
these are Rachel's
parents.

1605
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,713
- How are you, Ari?
- Steve and Claudia.

1606
01:11:58,715 --> 01:12:01,316
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I hope we're not intruding.

1607
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:03,584
We're gonna go
for a-- a hike.

1608
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:05,386
- Um...
- Josh:<i> Yeah.</i>

1609
01:12:05,388 --> 01:12:08,956
- Okay.
- We were just talking
about a book we read.

1610
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:16,564
Have a seat.
Sorry about this.

1611
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:19,701
It's okay.

1612
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:22,537
- - What's that pink thing?

1613
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:24,605
Oh, this?

1614
01:12:24,607 --> 01:12:26,507
Uh, this is, uh--
it's Ari's.

1615
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,609
- He's trying to quit smoking.
- Oh, it's a filter thing?

1616
01:12:28,611 --> 01:12:29,844
- Yeah.
- My mother had
one of those.

1617
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:32,547
- It was fancy.
- It's supposed to help.

1618
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:34,949
Steve:
<i> First of all,</i>

1619
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:37,051
we want
to apologize to you.

1620
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:38,553
I-- I think
we were both

1621
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:40,755
so, uh, shaken,

1622
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:44,125
and I think
we took it out on you.

1623
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:47,061
Not letting you
go to the funeral,
that wasn't--

1624
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:50,798
- wasn't really right, so...
- And I hope you forgive us.

1625
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,569
Well, wow,
i mean, uh,

1626
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:58,039
honestly,
this means a lot.

1627
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:01,409
I mean, yes, sure,
yeah, I forgive you.

1628
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:03,845
I mean,
that was really--
that was hard.

1629
01:13:03,847 --> 01:13:06,547
It would help so much
if we all just talked about
what happened that day.

1630
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,783
- It would really be helpful.
- Understanding like, you know,

1631
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:10,585
-<i> the sequence of events. </i>
-<i> You spoke to her</i>
<i> right before.</i>

1632
01:13:10,587 --> 01:13:12,420
She called me on the phone.
She called me on the phone

1633
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:14,589
to ask me one of my recipes,
you know, which I love,
of course

1634
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:15,923
because I'm very proud
of my recipes.

1635
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:17,859
So help us-- help us,
Josh, please.

1636
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:19,560
Did you guys have
a fight or something
when you got home?

1637
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,763
- Was there an emotional...
- So, yeah, I got home

1638
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:24,065
and, uh, we didn't--
we talked about

1639
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:25,867
what I wanted to do
for my birthday.

1640
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:28,069
You came home
and you talked--
you talked to her?

1641
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,971
So she<i> was</i> alive
when you got back?

1642
01:13:29,973 --> 01:13:31,572
- Yeah.
-<i> This is what I'm saying.</i>

1643
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,107
This is different
from what you told
the police.

1644
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:34,776
No, I'm talking about
when I got home from work.

1645
01:13:34,778 --> 01:13:37,011
I came home from work
and we started discussing

1646
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:38,146
what I wanted to do
for my birthday

1647
01:13:38,148 --> 01:13:39,714
and then
i went to the gym.

1648
01:13:39,716 --> 01:13:41,182
This is the part of the story
that keeps changing

1649
01:13:41,184 --> 01:13:43,484
and this is
why I wanna know
what actually happened.

1650
01:13:43,486 --> 01:13:46,020
-<i> We just need</i>
<i> to know what happened. </i>
- Just tell us.

1651
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:48,790
I-- she was depressed.

1652
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:50,691
- Claudia:<i> Depressed? </i>
- She was.
She was distant and...

1653
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:53,761
No, not Rachel.
Our Rachel was not depressed.

1654
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,430
-<i> Never heard that. </i>
- Look, I tried to--

1655
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:57,932
I tried to get kind of
to the bottom of it

1656
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:01,669
and every time,
she'd mis--

1657
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:03,638
she-- she'd deflect

1658
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,773
and she wouldn't answer me.
She was on, um...

1659
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:08,443
- Drugs? Was she?
- No.

1660
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:10,511
- You guys were taking drugs?
- No, we don't take drugs.

1661
01:14:10,513 --> 01:14:12,780
It was medication,
you know, like,
antidepressants.

1662
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:15,850
Okay, you don't do drugs.
She doesn't do drugs.

1663
01:14:15,852 --> 01:14:19,654
She's taking some--
some medication
from a doctor?

1664
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:20,788
- Please tell me
from a doctor?
- Josh:<i> Yes, yes.</i>

1665
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,190
You know,
here's the thing.

1666
01:14:22,192 --> 01:14:24,692
It's just a little
convoluted for us, right?

1667
01:14:24,694 --> 01:14:26,127
And so
we actually paid

1668
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,129
for a second autopsy
to be done.

1669
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:30,698
The coroner said
that it was actually
inconclusive

1670
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,500
- for it to be suicide.
- Inconclusive.

1671
01:14:32,502 --> 01:14:34,202
- They couldn't say...
- They couldn't say for sure

1672
01:14:34,204 --> 01:14:35,536
- that it was a suicide.
- Could not say for sure.

1673
01:14:35,538 --> 01:14:37,805
So, okay,
if she's not...

1674
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:40,741
Hi. Thank you.
I really had a nice time.

1675
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:43,077
I'm kind of freaking out,
so I'm gonna probably
take off.

1676
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:44,946
Thank you, though.
I love your home.

1677
01:14:44,948 --> 01:14:46,981
So nice--
it's very pretty.

1678
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,755
- - Who is this?

1679
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:57,492
I don't know who that is.
I don't know who that is!

1680
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:58,826
- I'm sure you
don't know who that is.
- You don't know who she is?

1681
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:00,161
- No, I don't.
- 'Cause you don't party.

1682
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:01,863
- You don't party.
- You don't do drugs.

1683
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:03,998
- Let me show you something.
- Let me get this out.

1684
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,068
- You don't party.
- You don't party.

1685
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:08,236
- Steve:<i> What's that? </i>
-<i> You don't do drugs.</i>

1686
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:09,971
What is this?
You taking photos of me?

1687
01:15:09,973 --> 01:15:11,606
Claudia:
<i> How about guns?</i>
<i> That's so much fun.</i>

1688
01:15:11,608 --> 01:15:13,274
- This is a bb gun.
- Claudia:<i> Who is she?</i>

1689
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:14,976
- Steve: Who is she?
Any idea?
- So much fun

1690
01:15:14,978 --> 01:15:17,078
<i> when women strip</i>
<i> and gyrate all over you</i>

1691
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,514
when you're mourning.

1692
01:15:19,516 --> 01:15:21,115
- When you're mourning.
- Steve: Look at that.

1693
01:15:21,117 --> 01:15:23,618
Look at that.
Those marks were
made by her?

1694
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,286
- She did not
do that to herself!
-<i> She strangled herself?</i>

1695
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:27,088
- Just tell the truth!
- I am telling the truth.

1696
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:28,122
-<i> You killed our daughter! </i>
- Say the truth, Josh!

1697
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:29,690
I'm telling the truth.

1698
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,226
- I didn't fucking kill her!
- Oh, really?

1699
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,696
I knew you were
that monster.

1700
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:38,299
Do you
fucking see this?

1701
01:15:38,301 --> 01:15:42,136
-<i> What the fuck is this? </i>
- Claudia:<i> That's so we could</i>
<i> get all your lies on tape!</i>

1702
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:43,971
-<i> I haven't been lying! </i>
- Claudia:<i> You're a liar.</i>

1703
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:46,073
-<i> You're a fucking liar! </i>
- Josh:<i> Get out!</i>

1704
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:48,209
- What are you doing?
- Get out, you psychopaths.
Get out!

1705
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,711
- Get out.
Take your photos.
- Steve: We're gonna find out.

1706
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,880
<i> You can keep that!</i>
<i> That's a little souvenir.</i>

1707
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,149
- - Should we go up there?

1708
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:57,718
- Steve: We're on to you!
- Great, yeah, yeah.

1709
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:19,340
- Is everything okay?

1710
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:25,346
I don't know.
I'm just--

1711
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:28,883
I guess
I'm just, um--

1712
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:33,220
I'm tired of her.

1713
01:16:33,222 --> 01:16:35,222
I'm tired of, like--

1714
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:44,231
I'm tired of her
making me feel this way.

1715
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:46,667
You know, because--

1716
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:52,673
I don't know.
She just-- she--
this is...

1717
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,812
It's about her.

1718
01:17:02,884 --> 01:17:05,786
And, uh,

1719
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:08,656
it's been
about her and...

1720
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:12,627
I-- I guess
i don't know.
You know what?

1721
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:16,731
I'm a little--
I'm a little tired of it.

1722
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:21,302
She checks out,
and I have to fucking
deal with it!

1723
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,237
And I have to deal
with missing her

1724
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:26,007
and fucking feeling
real fuckin' sad!

1725
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:29,410
And having her
fucking parents...

1726
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,382
<i> In case</i>
<i> anyone's wondering,</i>

1727
01:17:34,384 --> 01:17:36,717
I didn't, and I hope
you fucking believe me

1728
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,185
because I didn't
murder someone.

1729
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:40,221
I didn't murder her.
I loved her very much.

1730
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,723
And then, uh,
i guess she thought

1731
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:44,925
that the best way
to return that

1732
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:48,195
would be to kill herself
on my fucking birthday!

1733
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:56,937
<i> So, I don't know.</i>

1734
01:17:56,939 --> 01:18:00,441
<i> That's what I'm left with</i>

1735
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:04,145
and-- and, uh--

1736
01:18:04,147 --> 01:18:05,946
and I'm
even sorry now.

1737
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:08,282
Like, you know, 'cause now
I'm dragging you guys in.

1738
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:10,685
I'm pulling you guys
into this shit,

1739
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,420
and you have
your own lives.

1740
01:18:12,422 --> 01:18:14,889
And everybody has
their own problems.

1741
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:16,157
And now
you have to sit here

1742
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,758
and look at me do this.

1743
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,760
It's so fucking weird.

1744
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:22,263
<i> It's so weird.</i>

1745
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,901
<i> It's so stupid.</i>

1746
01:18:26,903 --> 01:18:30,237
I'm so fucking mad
at her.

1747
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,207
I'm so mad at her.

1748
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:38,079
Well-- well,

1749
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:45,953
thanks, you know,
for coming.

1750
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:49,924
I don't know
if you guys maybe just...

1751
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:55,096
Adam, do you wanna
play your game?

1752
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,233
Yeah, if you do.

1753
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:03,938
I think that
would be pretty fun.

1754
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,073
Greg makes great
grilled cheeses.

1755
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:08,242
I do.

1756
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:10,778
- Fuck it,
let's play the game.
- Eric:<i> Let's play the game.</i>

1757
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:13,447
All right, okay.

1758
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:14,982
Here.

1759
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:29,430
You want a tissue?

1760
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:32,099
Yeah. Looks used.

1761
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:35,369
No. This is actually
Adam's, um, handkerchief

1762
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:37,171
that his grandfather
gave him in the war.

1763
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:38,973
- Oh?
- And I spit my gum
in it earlier,

1764
01:19:38,975 --> 01:19:40,474
- but it should be fine.
- Spitting his gum in it

1765
01:19:40,476 --> 01:19:42,176
is a euphemism

1766
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:45,312
for using
his grandfather's
handkerchief

1767
01:19:45,314 --> 01:19:46,413
as a cum rag.

1768
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:53,554
I got this problem.
I keep coming in my
grandfather's handkerchief.

1769
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:56,290
I don't know what to do.
You gotta help me.

1770
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:42,136
So, Joshua has just
rolled three ones,

1771
01:20:42,138 --> 01:20:45,272
which means that
we have been defeated
by the turtlesaurus.

1772
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:48,042
<i> However, the mechas</i>
<i> will stay strong.</i>

1773
01:20:48,044 --> 01:20:49,510
- Hey, Ari?
-<i> Hmm?</i>

1774
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:51,245
What we doing here, bud?

1775
01:20:51,247 --> 01:20:53,214
We're all waiting for--

1776
01:20:53,216 --> 01:20:55,616
to sign off before
we launch the attack.

1777
01:20:55,618 --> 01:20:57,618
That's very good.
You're half paying
attention,

1778
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,054
- but I like that.
- Good. I'll be right back.

1779
01:21:00,056 --> 01:21:01,455
- Okay.
- This is why
the grilled cheese is so good.

1780
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:03,424
This is what
i did into it.
Uh, uh, uh!

1781
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:06,627
- Hi.
- Greg:<i> Shit!</i>

1782
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:08,629
- Hey, man.
- Thanks for coming.

1783
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:11,498
- Oh, yeah.
- Greg:<i> What did I do?</i>

1784
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:14,335
Eric:
<i> Hey, it's Jodi</i>
<i> from the bar!</i>

1785
01:21:14,337 --> 01:21:16,904
- Jodi.
- That's right.

1786
01:21:16,906 --> 01:21:19,273
Just to catch you up,
there's been an alien
invasion.

1787
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:21,408
We are the mechas.
We are the machines.

1788
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:22,943
<i> We are fighting</i>
<i> all these monsters.</i>

1789
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:24,578
If the monsters
continue to rise up,

1790
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:27,047
specifically
the turtlesaurus,

1791
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,649
- we're fucked.
- Great.

1792
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:30,184
- I love that kind of stuff.
- Eric:<i> The turtlesaurus</i>

1793
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:32,586
has been a real
problemsaurus for us.

1794
01:21:32,588 --> 01:21:35,222
We're hoping for
a core turbo charger.

1795
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,557
Did you say
the turtlesaurus

1796
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:38,225
has been
the problemsaurus?

1797
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,494
- It's been a problem for us.
- I'm gonna focus

1798
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:42,229
on defeating
the turtlesaurus.

1799
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,498
- Ari:<i> Yeah! </i>
- Eric:<i> Yeah!</i>

1800
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:47,635
Tell me
something good!

1801
01:21:47,637 --> 01:21:50,204
I'll use my charge bomb.
I'll use that on
my next turn.

1802
01:21:50,206 --> 01:21:51,472
Greg:
<i> Should I bust out</i>
<i> a charge bomb?</i>

1803
01:21:51,474 --> 01:21:52,907
Ari:
I don't know
if you have one.

1804
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:54,074
We just needed
to have enough

1805
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:56,410
in order to dislodge
the space flicker

1806
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:58,479
- and all to team up against--
- you should, in fact,
use that charge bomb

1807
01:21:58,481 --> 01:22:00,547
because I'd love to move
at least three or four hexes

1808
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:03,050
'cause this turtlesaurus
is coming out of the side.

1809
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:04,985
<i> I think that</i>
<i> I'm gonna probably</i>

1810
01:22:04,987 --> 01:22:07,388
<i> take a break</i>
<i> from my marriage.</i>

1811
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:09,056
Greg:<i> Oh.</i>

1812
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:11,258
Okay, Eric.

1813
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,127
I shouldn't be married.
There's no reason.

1814
01:22:13,129 --> 01:22:15,963
I don't wear a ring.
I've been flirting
with women all weekend.

1815
01:22:15,965 --> 01:22:18,632
I wanna fuck other people.
So I shouldn't be married.

1816
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:22,403
So, uh, can I roll?

1817
01:22:22,405 --> 01:22:24,004
Great.

1818
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:26,006
Pass me the die.

1819
01:22:26,008 --> 01:22:28,542
It's been a--
there's a lot going on.

1820
01:22:28,544 --> 01:22:30,144
You guys are
a hot group, you know?

1821
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:32,346
15!

1822
01:22:32,348 --> 01:22:34,415
Yes!

1823
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:36,150
Jodi: He's not gonna get
anything above an eight.

1824
01:22:36,152 --> 01:22:38,585
Both: Ee!

1825
01:22:42,024 --> 01:22:43,390
If I meant to do

1826
01:22:43,392 --> 01:22:45,159
half of the things
that I did,

1827
01:22:45,161 --> 01:22:47,728
I'd be
a fucking genius, man.

1828
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:51,031
- Jodi: Cool.
- I'd be huge,
but I am what I am,

1829
01:22:51,033 --> 01:22:52,700
and that's all that I am.
I'm fine.

1830
01:22:54,437 --> 01:22:56,470
And I'll take
gen highway...

1831
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:58,138
- Eric:<i> Jen? </i>
- Greg:<i> Jen?</i>

1832
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,740
- Eric:<i> Jennifer. </i>
- Greg:<i> Jennifer!</i>

1833
01:22:59,742 --> 01:23:02,109
It's not Jennifer.
It's-- it's short
for Genesis.

1834
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:04,411
- It's a man.
- Jennifer is a regular
basic bitch, aren't you?

1835
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:06,580
It's not a woman,
and don't call me Jen.

1836
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:08,215
- Call me highway.
- Eric:<i> Okay, highway.</i>

1837
01:23:08,217 --> 01:23:10,250
Thank you so much
for coming.

1838
01:23:10,252 --> 01:23:13,287
- Eric:<i> We're finally</i>
playing the game...
- Oh, you're so welcome.

1839
01:23:13,289 --> 01:23:15,456
- You're not feeling...
- Adam:<i> This doesn't</i>
<i> seem really...</i>

1840
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:17,191
- What?
- ...Weird or anything?

1841
01:23:17,193 --> 01:23:19,059
- You're feeling weird.
- I'm feeling very weird.

1842
01:23:19,061 --> 01:23:20,461
- Yeah, it's cool.
- Okay.

1843
01:23:20,463 --> 01:23:22,262
It's okay.

1844
01:23:22,264 --> 01:23:24,131
I wouldn't have come
if I didn't want to.

1845
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:31,205
- Oh!
- Greg:<i> Oh, yes!</i>

1846
01:23:31,207 --> 01:23:33,674
- Whoa!
- Greg:
<i> Fuck, yeah, Jodi.</i>

1847
01:23:33,676 --> 01:23:35,275
Okay, guys.

1848
01:23:35,277 --> 01:23:37,344
The game basically
comes down to this roll.

1849
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:41,015
Jodi, we need
at least a 17
or the game is over.

1850
01:23:41,017 --> 01:23:42,483
Turtlesaurus
is victorious,

1851
01:23:42,485 --> 01:23:44,618
eats us, and then hides us
under his mutant shell.

1852
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:46,720
17 is pretty hard.
It's, uh--

1853
01:23:46,722 --> 01:23:49,723
out of three dice,
that's only two in 18,

1854
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:51,225
one in nine chance.

1855
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:53,027
I want victory
right now.

1856
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:55,529
This turtlesaurus
is not gonna get
into my life,

1857
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:57,197
not tonight.
Ready?

1858
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:59,133
Here we go.
Come on, Jodi.

1859
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:04,405
- - And?

1860
01:24:04,407 --> 01:24:07,708
- All: Oh.
- Fuck!

1861
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,710
Jodi:
I'm so sorry. Shit!

1862
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:11,812
Shit, man!
We played-- oh,

1863
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:14,381
<i> we've been playing</i>
<i> this fucking thing all night</i>

1864
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:16,250
and that happens?
Goddamn it!

1865
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:18,652
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Hey, Greg, Greg, Greg.

1866
01:24:18,654 --> 01:24:22,189
Well, since
it's mostly, um,

1867
01:24:22,191 --> 01:24:25,259
like, ruined,
i think I should go.

1868
01:24:25,261 --> 01:24:26,560
I'm okay.
I just had to let it out.

1869
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:28,495
Goodbye, gentlemen.

1870
01:24:28,497 --> 01:24:30,264
- Eric:<i> Bye, Jodi</i>
<i> from the game! </i>
- Bye!

1871
01:24:30,266 --> 01:24:32,132
Sorry that
i lost the game.

1872
01:24:32,134 --> 01:24:34,201
You know, it's a hard thing
to fight a bunch of robots.

1873
01:24:34,203 --> 01:24:36,336
- You did good.
- No, it's okay.

1874
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:38,639
- It's not okay.
I know I could...
- You're embarrassing me.

1875
01:24:38,641 --> 01:24:40,641
- You're embarrassing.
- We'll talk about it
in the hall.

1876
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:43,243
- Josh:<i> See you later, turd! </i>
- Bye, joshy.

1877
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:44,812
- Josh:<i> Bye. </i>
- Greg:<i> Bye, Jodi!</i>

1878
01:24:44,814 --> 01:24:47,147
- Bye, guys. Cool weekend.
- Greg:<i> Jodi, I'm on your side.</i>

1879
01:24:47,149 --> 01:24:48,782
- Whatever, Greg.
- Eric:<i> I would still argue</i>

1880
01:24:48,784 --> 01:24:50,684
that mafia is
the best board game.

1881
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:52,152
Yeah, well, mafia
is not a board game.

1882
01:24:52,154 --> 01:24:54,288
There's no board.
There's just sort of...

1883
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:56,290
- Okay. Well, then, uh...
- ...Social fun
and nonsense game.

1884
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,660
Well, good game,
asshole.

1885
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:05,132
- Good game, sore loser.
- Yeah.

1886
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,541
Yeah, i--

1887
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:35,829
okay.
No, I'm sorry.

1888
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:42,336
That is confusing.

1889
01:25:42,338 --> 01:25:43,637
Yeah.

1890
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:48,442
And whoa!

1891
01:25:48,444 --> 01:25:49,843
Okay, yeah.

1892
01:25:49,845 --> 01:25:51,445
Okay, okay.

1893
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:09,596
All right.

1894
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,637
- Hey, Joshua.
- Thanks for coming, man.

1895
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,672
I gotta say, Eric,

1896
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:20,641
this was
a really fun weekend.

1897
01:26:20,643 --> 01:26:22,342
Thank you.

1898
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:24,845
- Greg?
- Hey, I'm here.

1899
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:26,947
Be in touch,
we'll get something planned.

1900
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:29,249
I'm gonna plan a game weekend
with you, buddy.

1901
01:26:29,251 --> 01:26:31,251
- Let's do it,
a whole tournament.
- I love games now.

1902
01:26:31,253 --> 01:26:33,754
- It's your new thing.
- Yeah, so fun.

1903
01:26:33,756 --> 01:26:35,822
There's a lot
of great literature
about them online.

1904
01:26:35,824 --> 01:26:37,858
Very critical
community, so...

1905
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,593
- Hey.

1906
01:26:39,595 --> 01:26:40,894
- You, too, Adam.
- Yeah.

1907
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,962
- You, too.
- Eric: Come back.

1908
01:26:41,964 --> 01:26:43,664
Come back
and hang out.

1909
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:45,766
- Sure, yeah,
I'd love to.
- Okay.

1910
01:26:45,768 --> 01:26:47,668
- I'd love to.
- Thanks.

1911
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:49,503
Greg:
<i> I'll probably never</i>
<i> see you guys ever again,</i>

1912
01:26:49,505 --> 01:26:50,971
but that doesn't
take away from the fact

1913
01:26:50,973 --> 01:26:53,640
that this has been
one of the most important
weekends

1914
01:26:53,642 --> 01:26:55,842
of my entire life.

1915
01:26:55,844 --> 01:26:57,711
And I thank you.
I thank you for that.

1916
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:59,513
I don't know if
you guys knew this,

1917
01:26:59,515 --> 01:27:00,948
but Greg was
a bit of a mess
before he got here.

1918
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:02,816
- Ha.
- Okay.

1919
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:04,685
- Okay.
- See you, man.

1920
01:27:04,687 --> 01:27:06,453
- Josh:<i> Bye. </i>
- Bye, guys.

1921
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:09,590
Hey, guys?

1922
01:27:09,592 --> 01:27:12,893
Positive vibes,
positive energy!

1923
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:15,629
Positive vibes,
positive energy.

1924
01:27:15,631 --> 01:27:17,831
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1925
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:18,865
Okay.

1926
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:22,769
I'm gonna take off
as well.

1927
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:24,438
Sure, man.
I'll see you.

1928
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,406
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, of course, buddy.

1929
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:31,445
- Bye.
- See you.

1930
01:27:31,447 --> 01:27:32,846
Ari:
<i> Take it easy, man.</i>

1931
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:54,434
It was good
