Damn!

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,320
Parking on the wrong side
of the street?

I’m gonna go to that ATM machine
and get some cash.

16
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,520
Stay here and watch my car. I spent
a lot of money restoring this car.

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,760

Whining

28
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,240
Get in the car.
Good boy.

00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,920
Guard Code Red! Code
Red! Were under fire.

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
Repeat, were pinned down
and under fire.

36
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,560
Some partner you are.
Why didn’t you warn me, at least?

37
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,600
Guard Is this guy after the money,
or is he just pissed at your car?

38
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,440
Can you reload, please?
Thank you.

39
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,040
Gunfire Continues

My stereo.

42
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,080
Were gonna take this guy out.
You cover us,

43
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,400

to use the gun!

44
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,800
Come on, Jerry Lee!

45
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,600
Hey, come on.
Open up.

46
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,280
Come on.
Shut the door.

47
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,920
Okay, so I forgot.
Its a bulletproof window.

48
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,160
All right, you son of a bitch,
we both have armor now.

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We got him.

50
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040

I hate the running thing.

71
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,880
What, are you leavin

72
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,400
Christ, what’s with you lately?
What’s with you?

73
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,080
- We almost had that guy.
Whining

You know why cops have dogs?

75
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,200
So they don’t have to do this!
That’s the deal.

76
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,800
Management, labor.
Foreman, employee.

Boss, secretary.
I walk, you run.

Look what they did!

83
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,840
I couldn’t even sell it
to a cheese factory.

84
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,120
Hey, Dooley!
Check this out.

85
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,280
Its a modified M-16.
A company called...

86
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,240
Armaments 2000s
doin´ the retrofit.

87
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,200
Its supposed to be
for military use only.

88
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,840
- Where did you hear that?
- I saw it in a gun magazine.

89
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,760
- Did you pick that up on the street?
- Yeah.

90
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,080
- Are you supposed to be messin’ with evidence?
- No.

91
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,440
Give me that.
Go get me some coffee.

92
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,200
Well, Jerry Lee, so much
for the Brady Bill, huh?

93
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,520
- Dooley? What are you doing here?
- Hi, Captain.

94
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,960
Sighs
What happened?

95
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,240
Uh, well, there was a,
uh, equipment failure.

96
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,040
- Equipment failure?
- The bad guy had Air Jordan’s on. It was no contest.

97
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,160
What about Jerry Lee?
He needs four little Air Jordan’s too?

98
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,840
- You mean they make those for dogs?
- That was a rhetorical question.

99
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,560
You know, Captain, you should let people
know when you plan to be rhetorical,

100
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,480
cause your tone of voice
never changes.

101
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,600
- You think you’re funny?
- Sometimes.

102
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,520
- This isn’t one of those times.
- Jerry Lee, he just hit me!

103
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,040
- Quit bein’ a smart-ass. Tell
me what happened. - Again!

104
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,680
The bad guy had
a full body armor on.

105
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,360
- That should have given you the advantage.
- It was that lightweight stuff.

106
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,880
What can I tell you?
The guy had a rocket up his ass.

107
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
- What the hell is that?
- This here?

108
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,080
Uh, this was the shooters.
This is a modified M-16.

109
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,320
A company named Armaments 2000
does the retrofit.

110
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,240
Its apparently
for military use only.

111
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,920
- How do you know all that?
- I’m trying to better myself by taking night seminars.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,200
Ah, shut up, will you?
You better sit down. You look pale.

113
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,040
- Probably because you hit me.
- And give that dog there a drink of water.

114
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,200
Jerry Lee is fine,
and so am I.

115
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,080
You don’t look fine.
Sit down before you fall down.

116
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,840
- Now. Detective Harris?
- Yes.

117
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,320
- Its the smog!
- Take this to the lab and check it for prints, okay?

118
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,120
You know, Dooley,

119
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,880
every time you go someplace lately,
people try to kill you.

120
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
- Well, I’m a popular guy.
- Look, I’m serious here.

121
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,360
- You’ve lost three suspects
in three weeks! - Come-

122
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,720
- You are either out of your league...
- I am not out of my league.

123
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,800
- or you’ve lost a step.
- What are you talking about, "lost a step"?

124
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,880
You should have taken
time off after Tracy died.

125
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,520
- That has nothing to do with it, Captain.
- Oh. Are you sure?

126
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,680
Absolutely sure.

127
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,440
When was the last time
you had a physical?

128
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,960
Physical. Is that the blood pressure,
when they do the-

129
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,120
Laughs, Whimpers

130
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,640
I want you both checked out.
You understand me?

131
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,040
I obviously cant
count on you anymore.

132
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,800
Hey!
What about my car?

133
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,240
Have your detailer look at it.
He can probably rub it out.

134
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,080
Rub it out?

135
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,360
I guess I can drive it at night.
Nobody’ll see it.

136
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Come on, Jerry Lee.
Come on, get in.

137
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,360
My poor car.
Sighs

138
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,920
- Aw, he got my cup holder too.

Ah, you know what? Its my fault.

143
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,960
Woman Devon Lane, this is
my husband, Detective Dooley.

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Dooley Nice to meet you. Devon
Oh, the pleasure is all mine.

- Dooley Can we get some drinks over here?

Dooley Devon. Sorry. What’s
with the tape recorder?

148
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,720
Devon I’m a writer. I tape
everything. Tracy Devon,

149
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,320
I just want to say that I see
real potential in your work.

150
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,880
Devon Potential? Really? Tracy Oh, yeah.

151
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,680
He’s been a cop a long time. Maybe he
can help you with some of that cop stuff.

152
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,400
Devon Would you? Dooley Well,
yeah, sure. You okay, honey?

153
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,600
Tracy Ill be fine. I’ll be
back in a few minutes. Excuse me.

154
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,520
Devon
Tracy told me you read my manuscript.

155
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,040
Dooley Yeah, I did. I
didn’t read the whole thing.

156
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,960
I read the first
and the last chapter.

157
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,880
That’s really
all I had time for.

158
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,040
Devon The first and last
chapters? Dooley I gotta tell ya,

159
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,920
uh, its-
it wasn’t really that real.

160
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,720
Devon It wasn’t real? Dooley No, it wasn’t
real. I didn’t believe a lot of the-

161
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,360
all that cop stuff you have in there-
the shootouts and the bank robbery.

162
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,560
That’s not really
how it happens.

163
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,320
Devon It wasn’t real? Dooley That’s all
right. It’s your first attempt, man.

164
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,880
Don’t worry about it.
You’ll get there.

165
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:09,360
Don’t worry about it.
You’ll get there.

- Oh, uh-

168
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,040
No, he’s fine.

169
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,840
- Okay, I’m gonna increase the speed and incline.
- Why?

170
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,680
Thuds
- Well, that’s the standard test for canines, Detective.

171
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,800
Oh.

172
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,320
Jerry Lee Whining
- What?

173
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,600
I can hold the handrail.
Humans can hold the handrail.

174
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,840
All right,
all right, all right.

175
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,880
Have you noticed
any changes in him?

176
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,400
Yeah, he doesn’t chase the little chuck
wagon across the kitchen floor anymore.

177
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,000
Any loss of hearing
or smell?

178
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,720
Well, that depends on
what you mean by "any. "

179
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:54,360
Well, that depends on
what you mean by "any. "

180
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,640
Well, maybe sometimes,
a little bit.

181
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,160
- Well, there’s nothing wrong with your dog.
- Really?

182
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,360
He’s just suffering
from the effects of aging.

183
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,880
- You should slow him down a bit.
- Why?

184
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,320
Would you send your grandfather out
to try and do your job?

185
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,680
I wouldn’t send my grandfather
to microwave popcorn.

186
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,840
- So why would you send out Jerry Lee?
- Cause my grandfather’s too old.

187
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,080
- So is Jerry Lee.
- What do you mean? Look at him. He looks great.

188
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,600
Do you know that dogs are leading
longer and healthier lives these days?

189
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,640
- Where did you hear that?
- Seminar. At night. I try to better myself.

190
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,360
Oh, you’re trying to better yourself?
Maybe you should get a checkup.

191
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,800
You’ve got high blood pressure.
Your face is bright red.

192
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,760
That is a drinking problem!

193
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,880
Well, what do you know?
You’re a vet.

194
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,320
You both need to be
on special diets.

195
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,200
- The same one? - No. You should
be on a low-fat, low-sodium diet.

196
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,560
The dog needs to be on
a senior maintenance meal plan.

197
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,200
Whining
- What the hells that?

198
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,360
Lamb and rice
for older dogs.

199
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,840
It might give him some flatulence for a
week or so, but nothing to worry about.

200
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,840
Sighs Nothing for you to worry
about. I gotta live with the damn dog.

201
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,080
- You trying to be funny?
- No.

202
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,040
I forgot my wallet,
so can I write a check?

203
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,240
Do I get
any free samples?

204
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,440
Jerry Lee Whining
- Senior maintenance.

205
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,840
Hey, your day.
You checked out great.

206
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,440
You just, uh-

207
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,360
- You’re out of shape.
Whines

208
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,080
Come on. Lets go.

209
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,640
Come on.
Lets jump.

210
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,280
Barking

211
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,720
Grunts
Come on!

212
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,000
Hey, hey.
Come here, you. Come on.

213
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,920
Barking

214
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,160
Come on, just do it.

215
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,680
Ow! Ow!

216
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,200
- Come on!
Jerry Lee Whining

217
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,760
Jump, jump, jump!

218
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,000
Hey!
What are you doing on my spot?

219
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,080
Whining

220
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,640
That’s my spot.

221
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Here.

222
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,840
Whines

223
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,960
That’ll make
you feel better.

224
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,080
You all right?

225
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,520
What’s the matter
with your lamb and rice?

226
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,520
You don’t like it?
Here.

227
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,760
Huh? Here.

228
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,880
How’s that?
Nothin´,, huh?

229
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Telephone Ringing
- But this is good for us.

230
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,880
Think we should
work out every day.

231
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,085
- Very tribal.
Ringing Continues

232
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,440
- Very tribal.
Ringing Continues

233
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,760
Yeah, some insurance company you are. I
called the office three hours ago about my car-

234
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,240
Hey! Jeez!

235
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,680
Jerry Lee! Come here.
Lie down. Down.

236
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,440
Man
I just saved you 300 calories.

237
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,720
- Who is this?
- You should be drinking light beer.

238
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,760
Less filling,
and it wont slow you down.

239
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,800
And Dooley, you better pay attention
to the "wont slow you down" part.

240
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,240
I could have beat you
running backwards, old man.

241
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,480
- What do you want?
- Don’t tell me you haven’t figured it out yet, Detective.

242
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,240
Three times
in three weeks, Dooley.

243
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,040
I could have taken you out
anytime I wanted.

244
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,160
I want you to know how it feels to have
someone else control your destiny.

245
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,280
- Jerry, down!
- How it feels to have someone else destroy your life.

246
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,880
- What do you want?
- Its hard to lose a loved one.

247
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,800
Isn’t it, Dooley? But then,
sometimes life just has a way...

248
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,520
of kicking you in the face,
just when you think you’ve got it made.

249
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,440
Hey, why don’t you
come in.

250
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,320
You and I, we can have
a beer, we can chat.

251
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,240
And then
Ill bust your ass.

252
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,520
You’re in no position, literally,
to start playin´ bad guy, Dooley.

253
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,520
Growling, Barking
Motorcycle Engine Revving

254
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,160
Dooley ... about my car. Hey! Jeez!

255
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,720
- Jerry Lee! Come here. - "Chapter
Six. Spoon-fed information by our hero,

256
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,360
Detective Dooley finally
figures out he is the target.

257
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,880
But he still
has no idea why.

258
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,440
Dooley’s Voice Who is this?
- Life is about to get a little more real. "

259
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,480
Man On Tape I could have beat
you running backwards, old man.

260
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,120
Don’t tell me you haven’t
figured it out yet, Detective.

261
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,760
Three times
in three weeks, Dooley.

262
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,640
I could have taken you out
anytime I wanted.

263
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,560
Dooley Well, at least we
know now were being set up.

264
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,480
Now, if we could just keep
Byers off our back.

265
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,880
- You let me do the talkin, huh?
Jerry Lee Growls

266
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,480
Oh, am I sore.

267
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,920
Groans
Okay.

268
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,480
Dooley How are you
feelin’? Come here. Barking

269
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,480
Come on. Stay with me.
You know what, Jerry Lee?

270
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,480
That vet was wrong.
Were not getting old.

271
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,120
Were getting sexier
and better and wiser.

272
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,400
Barks

273
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,360
Chattering

274
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
Man
Everybody duck. Its Dooley.

275
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,800
Don’t listen to him.

276
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,400
Whining
- Lay down, Jerry Lee.

277
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,600
Whines
- What’s with him?

278
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,920
What?
He’s not a morning dog.

279
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Listen, last night the shooter called.
Took a shot at me.

280
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,960
- Hit my beer.
- Why didn’t you call it in?

281
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,320
I got another beer. But wait a minute,
he said something weird.

282
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,480
Something really strange. He said, "Its
hard to lose a loved one, isn’t it?"

283
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,560
- Is he talkin about Tracy?
- I don’t know.

284
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,760
Could be anything. Could be a revenge
act, it could be somebody I know.

285
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,360
- I-I-I don’t know.
- Harry Stipe. Harry Stipe.

286
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,800
He swore that he would get you
after what happened to his brother!

287
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,920
- No, Harry Stipes doin´ five to ten.
- Not anymore. He got paroled.

288
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,840
- Harry Stipe is out?
- Yeah, it just came in.

289
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,880
- Stipe is out, and nobody told me?
- Just came across my desk.

290
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,600
- Give me the parole officers name. I want his address.
- Not so fast, Dooley.

291
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,000
- Come on! Give it to me.
- Sit.

292
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,080
Whines

293
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,840
There’s some guy out there gunnin´ for you.
You’re not going anywhere alone anymore.

294
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,960
- Not this again.
- Welles, get in here.

295
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,440
- Welles?
- And bring Zeus with you!

296
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,120
- Zeus?
Snarling

297
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,000
Growling
- Hey, whoa-ho-ho!

298
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,080
Meet your new partners.

299
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,160
No way!

300
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,720
- You’re not gonna actually let them in here, are you?
- I certainly am.

301
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,520
- Detective Dooley.
- Officer Welles.

302
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,080
- Sergeant Welles now.
- Oh. Sorry, I didn’t know.

303
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,680
- Good, you two know each other.
- Yeah, we had a moment a little while ago.

304
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,680
- Before he, uh
- Coughs Mumbling

305
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,440
Look, I don’t see what that dog
has gotta do that Jerry Lee can’t do.

306
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,080
Zeus!
Speaking Dutch

307
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,000
Speaking Dutch

308
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,240
Very impressive, Welles.

309
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,120
- Dooley?
- What?

310
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,320
He was trained
in anti-terrorist tactics.

311
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,000
Could he go into a mini-mart
and pick up a six-pack of beer?

312
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,400
He attacks through windows.

313
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,720
Well, Jerry Lee
has mastered Windows 98.

314
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,880
Got his own chat room.
"Dogs for Dogs"?

315
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,360
Shouting In Dutch

316
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,440
Jerry Lee
can do that.

317
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,800
- You can do that, cant you?
Whining

318
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,440
Captain? I really don’t
think this is a good idea.

319
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,320
- I couldn’t agree more with her.
- Dooley shouldn’t even have that dog.

320
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,200
He’s not trained as a canine officer.
He’s a dog with a pet.

321
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,320
Growls
- Ooh! Aren’t we a little moody?

322
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,800
Growls
- Zeus and I can handle this case alone.

323
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,280
I got news for you. Once I get a
parolees address, this case is closed.

324
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Then I got news for you.
A parolee doesn’t even fit the profile.

325
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,480
Profile? What is this,
an Olympic moment?

326
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,960
- This is a police investigation here.
- Really? I wouldn’t have guessed.

327
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,240
You don’t need a profile
to catch a bad guy.

328
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,680
All you need is a good cop
with good instincts.

329
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,880
I’m glad you said "good cop,"
because so far, your instincts suck!

330
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,720
You two are gonna
get along great.

331
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,960
Dooley, I need to talk to you alone.
No offense, Sergeant.

332
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,160
No offense
taken, Captain.

333
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,360
See you outside,
partner.

334
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,680
Hey! If you’re
gonna ride with me,

335
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,480
get out of that uniform and
be on my desk in five minutes.

336
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,840
- "At. " He meant "at. "
- No, I meant "at. "

337
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,240
"At. "
At my desk.

338
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,400
- "At. "

339
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,440
What is wrong with you? Didn’t you go
to the sexual harassment seminar?

340
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,120
I missed that one.
I was- I was at another seminar.

341
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,160
All right, forget about it.
Shell probably be cool about it.

342
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,960
- Ah, look. Put Jerry Lee outside.
- H-He cant testify.

343
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,640
- Look, just have him wait outside.
- He can keep a secret!

344
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
- Have him wait outside!
- All right. Come on, Jerry.

345
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,120
Uh, I got a delivery
for, uh, Detective Dooley.

346
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,720
Sign, please.

347
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,160
- Uh, there’s a complementary card in there.
- Thank you.

348
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,680
I saw the vet report
today, and uh,

349
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,000
Sighs
- you need to-

350
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,360
Dooley What? Jerry Lee Whines

351
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,400
You better give
some serious th-

352
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,720
- You need to give thought to getting a newer dog.
- What?

353
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,640
- Well, one like Zeus. Yes.
- Zeus?

354
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,680
That crazy, psycho dog?
Are you kiddin’ me?

355
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,360
He wouldn’t last five minutes
with me- I’d kill him!

356
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,360
Look, he probably
doesn’t even drink.

357
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,480
I don’t need a new dog. You know what
I need is a bigger gun- one like this.

358
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,080
- Will you put that away, you idiot?
- Or one like this.

359
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,800
- Where did you get this? This-This is
L.A., not Dallas. - How about this one?

360
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,640
Look, I got a guy out there
with an M-16 takin’ shots at me,

361
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,240
and all I got...
is this.

362
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,840
Dooley, firearms, that’s not
the problem. The problem is Jerry Lee.

363
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,480
- What?
- Well, if he misses a step, you could lose your life.

364
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,800
Don’t you understand? That’s why
I’m giving you both new partners.

365
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,080
I read that vet report.

366
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,480
The vet report said you were in the best
shape you’ve ever been in your life.

367
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Alert. Responsive.

368
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,480
He’s a killer!

369
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,880
You’re a stud dog,
Jerry Lee.

370
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,360
Whines
- See?

371
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,000
You see that?
You see his sly and uncanny way?

372
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,560
He’s pretending to be
asleep so he can pounce.

373
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,560
Good boy, Jerry Lee.
Come on. Lets go.

374
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,360
Come! Jerry.

375
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,560
Hot dogs!
Hamburgers! Chili!

376
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,800
Whining

377
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,320
Hey, Dooley. These flowers
were just delivered for you.

378
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,320
Must have been
a wild night.

379
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,880
"Was last night as good for you
as it was for me?"

380
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,920
- Who gave you these?
- The delivery guy.

381
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,640
- What did he look like?
- Green pants, black belt.

382
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,800
You saw him from
the waist down, that’s it?

383
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,720
- I was sittin’ in- - What are you
doing? Touching evidence again?

384
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,120
Puttin’ your prints
all over this? Listen to me.

385
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,320
- You see these gloves? I want you to wear these things. Forever!
- Yeah.

386
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,480
- Okay.
- Take these down to the lab and have them dusted.

387
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,760
Welles Zeus! Come!
- Come on. Lets go.

388
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,080
That Welles and that stupid psycho dog
is probably sittin up at the desk.

389
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,000
You and I can go get
the bad guys ourselves.

390
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
Hey!
We were just looking for you.

391
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,960
- Weren’t we, Jerry?
- Check this out.

392
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,360
If you look at the holes,
they actually spell out something.

393
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,640
It says, "Even though
I’m older and slower,

394
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,040
I’m still the same asshole
as I was before. "

395
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,600
Very funny. That’s very funny.
You think that was funny?

396
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,000
Sighs Come on, Jerry Lee.
- Zeus!

398
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,280
I can do that.

399
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,120
All right, look.
I want to get one thing straight...

400
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,040
before we go on here,
all right?

401
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,520
What went on between
you and me is history.

402
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
Now, you have got
to let it go.

403
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,840
I don’t even think
about it anymore.

404
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,840
And neither should you.
Okay?

405
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,080
- Okay.
- What do you mean, okay?

406
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,840
- I mean okay.
- Okay, you agree with it,

407
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,160
or okay, you don’t
think about it anymore?

408
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,320
- Okay. I don’t think about it.
- How can you not think about it?

409
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,520
- You said you don’t think about it.
- Well, of course not.

410
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,760
- I mean, Im-I´mm-I´mm-
- But what? What?

411
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,600
What? You’re so irresistible,
how could I not think about it?

412
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,400
- Well-
- Because, you know, it was one night.

413
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,120
- Heat of the moment stuff.
- Absolutely right!

414
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,560
- Right.
- Get in.

416
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,800
- What was that?
- What? Nothing.

417
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,240
And you, dog, lets get one thing
straight between you and me, all right?

418
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,520
Number one: No barking,
no drooling, no f-

419
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,120
passing of gas...

420
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,600
or performing any bodily functions
in or about my car.

421
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,560
Number two: You always
sit in the back seat.

422
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,320
Number three:
Never give me any lip.

423
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,040
Growling
- That’s negotiable. That’s negotiable.

424
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,560
Just relax.
Jerry Lee, watch him.

426
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,160
Ticket!
Look at that!

427
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
I think she follows
me around.

428
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,520
Just put it in
the glove compartment.

429
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,080
Dooley! How many
parking tickets do you have?

430
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,600
- Put’em in the glove compartment and shut it.
- Do you know how to park a car?

431
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,520
- Shut it!
Camera Shutter Clicks

432
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Ugh, I’m gonna need a tetanus shot
from just sitting in this car.

433
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,360
Engine Starts Dooley Were
going to Harry Stripe’s.

434
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,240
Were going to arrest him, and you’ll
never have to see me again, all right?

435
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,120
Fine.

436
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,080
Dooley Your dog likes to look through windows?
- He attacks through windows.

437
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,000
Dooley Yeah, but can
he sing? Welles What?

438
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,720

00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,000
Welles I’m tellin´ ya, he’s
not the guy we’re lookin´ for.

442
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,000
- And how would you know that?
- Because he doesn’t fit the profile.

443
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,720
Profile. Clears Throat Welles,

444
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,880
this is a profile.

445
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,600
A profile is only good when
you’re trying to narrow down suspects.

446
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,960
We need a list
of suspects first.

447
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,400
- Its not him.
- Okay, then. Stay in the car.

448
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,280
- And you too. You stay.
Jerry Lee? Lets go. Growling

449
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,120
We are not staying
in the car.

450
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,720
- Don’t look at me like that.
- Look at you like what?

451
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,560
Not you.
Him.

452
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,760
I got a weapon.
Ill use it.

453
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,320
We are trained K-9 officers.
We don’t do "stay in the car. "

454
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,240
Why don’t you...

455
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,240
and your little puppy
go in through the back?

456
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,080
He’s not a puppy. And why do we have
to go in the back? Why don’t you?

457
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,600
- We don’t do back doors. Come on!

You know, I hear they’re
converting this to condos?

462
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,960
If we take some out
of your money market fund,

463
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,680
we can buy one of these
and use it as a rental.

464
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,880
I hear conversions
can be a great investment.

465

481

- Is that everything?

520
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,920
So, if he didn’t make it
in 30 minutes, you get free ammo?

521
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,120
Hey, you know,
I didn’t think about that.

522
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,000

Uh, he knows
its treat time.

533

- I cant believe you’re going
to feed your dog this.

534
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,320
Surest way to kill him
is with this garbage.

535
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,240
He should be eating nothing
but senior maintenance.

536
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,720
You know what? I tried that senior
maintenance. I liked it. I mean, with a beer.

You’ve lost a lot of weight.

Fat Tommy I told you guys never

668
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,760
- What was all that Kung Fu crap about?
- It wasn’t Kung Fu.

669
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,440
It was Krav Maga.
God, Dooley, get out of the 70s.

670
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,480
Zeus and I trained for two months
at the Israeli Defense Force.

Oh, yeah? What did they feed him?

Ah, "Kibbutz n´ Bits. "
Did you like that?

673
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,520
Come on, now, I know you thought that
was funny. You’re laughing inside.

674
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,480
You shouldn’t hold it in like that.

687
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,680
- I want you to stay in the car.
- What?

688
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,800
- Stay!
- I’m not a dog.

689
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,760
Well, that’s obvious. Dogs listen.
Guffaws

This time,

691
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,160

- Oh, you’re actually giving me a choice?

692
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,680
- Yeah. Front, back?
- Well take the front.

693
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,400

- I want the front.

695
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,240
- Then well take the front.
- FinI’lllll take the back.

696
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,400
- What happened to "Jerry Lee and I don’t do back doors"?
- I’m trying to compromise, dear.

697
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,480
- You want the back?
- Yes.

698
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,920
- Then well take the back.
- Fine. I’ll take the front.

699
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,040
No way! That’s what you wanted me to say,
and that’s what you wanted me to take.

700
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,640
- Well take the front.
- Fine! Take the front!

701
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,080
- I don’t care!
- Sure you don’t. We’ll take the back.

702

00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,640
Hey, Phil. What’s goin´ on here?
I thought you went legit.

707
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,800
Oh, I could bullshit you, Dooley,

- Those new guns, Phil?
- How do you like’em?

710
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,320
Well, from this point of view,
they’re quite impressive.

711
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,440
You know, Phil,
this is your third strike.

712
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,800
- They’re gonna throw away the key.
- Why do you think I’m shootin´?

713
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,360
- Its nothin´ personal.
- That’s nice to hear.

714
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,720
- That’s very caring, loving and supportive.
- I had a good mother.

715
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,960
- Zeus, stay!
Growls

716
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,400

722
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,560
- Yeah, I could set you up with something special.
- Yeah?

723
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,840
Tell me about
that M-16 retrofit.

724
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,520
Chuckles
Little too pricey for you, Dooley.

725
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,720
- You got any names?
- I didn’t ask it!

726
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,680
- You know what he looked like?
- I wasn’t looking at his face, I was looking at the money.

727
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,600
I’m sure he looked like your average,
creepy kind of gun nut.

728
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,120
- A lot like you!
- Well, Phil, you’re gonna need that sense of humor...

729
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,040
when they lock you away
for the rest of your life...

730
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,000

Cuff him.
Call for backup.

735
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,760
I’m goin´ after Phil.

736
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,320

737
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,400
Oh-oh-oh, man!

743
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,640
Oh, no.
Not the running thing again.

744
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,720
Come on!
Sighs

745
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,880
Yeah, yeah. Look at that.
Look at that bike.

746
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,480
Grunts
Come on, come on!

747
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,360

Groans
You’re under arrest!

755
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,640
You have the right
to remain unconscious.

756
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,960
Anything you dream will be held
against you in a court of law.

757
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,800
Barking
- Its about time you got here, Jerry Lee!

758
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,440
Jerry Lee?

759
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,320
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

760
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,000
Jerry Lees fine.
He only drinks water every couple days.

761
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,920
Just like a camel.

762
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,040
- Probably on his fathers side.
- That’s an interesting trait.

763
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,040
Its very efficient too.
He pees all at once.

764
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,880
Is your dog on steroids
or something?

765
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,000
- No. Why?
- I’ve never seen a dog like that not pant.

766
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,400
He’s not tired.

767
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,800
- How old is Jerry Lee?
- Oh, I don’t know.

768
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,200
Well, how long have
you two been together?

769
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,520
Its the longest relationship
I’ve ever had.

770
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,440
You’ve got everything
tied up here,

771
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,360
so we’ve got a couple of
personal things to take care of.

772
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,280
Come on.
Come on.

773
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,680
Man Ah, too bad, Dooley.
Where are the marshmallows?

774
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,160
Can somebody
give me a ride?

775
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,960
Sighs

776
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,760
Oh, this is a hill!

777
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,000

Phew!

781
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,120
You know, this isn’t a bad mode
of transportation, Jerry Lee.

782
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,720
No gasoline, no insurance.

783
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,160
No parking tickets.

784
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,200
I gotta get a little carriage seat
for you in the back, though.

785
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,680
- Hard day, huh, Jer?

I think its a good idea

824
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,200
The original.
Jer?

825
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,200
Dooley
Oh, Jer.

826
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,080
Sighs

827
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,960
Jerry Lee?

828
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,880
- What are you doing?
Whimpers Softly

829
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,040
- We cant go in this car.
Whimpers

830
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,960
Jerry Lee, you cant go.

831
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,880
You cant go to work
with me today.

832
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,280
Jerry Lee, come on.
Go inside.

833
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,360
Go inside.

834
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,480
Oh, you’re playing
Mr. Deaf, are ya?

835
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,280
Do you want a time-out?
You want a time-out?

836
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,240
Fine.
Time-out!

837
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,000
Time-outs over. Now you’re grounded.
You are grounded, young man.

838
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,920
You go up into your room, no music,
no TV, no Beethoven, no park!

839
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,880
You gotta go to the bathroom?
Backyard for you.

840
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,080
Backyard!

841
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,560
Come on!

842
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,480
I’m gonna count to three,

843
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,200
and if you’re not upstairs,
in that room,

844
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,120
you’re in big trouble.

845
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,760
Whines
- One.

846
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,680
Motorcycle Approaching
- Two.

847
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,120
Two and a half.

848
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,040
- Three! Fine!
Barks

849
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,920
Fine, go!
Run away,

850
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,480
Mr. Independent,
I- Dont-Need-Mr. Dooley!

851
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,200
Go on, Jerry Lee!
Go with your friends!

852
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,680
- Sure, grass is greener on the other side, huh?
- Who are you yelling at?

853
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,080
- Jerry Lee.
- Why?

854
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,960
Oh, Mr. Big Shot
decided to run away.

855
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,880
All right, so,
jump in the car.

856
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,360
- Well go look for him. Zeus will seek him out.
- No, no, no, no.

857
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,640
He has to come to me. That’s the prodigal
son. He’s gotta go and come back.

858
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:25,600
I would be doing him damage if I went
and chased him down the street.

859
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,120
I am not gonna do it.

860
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,720
Whistling
Jerry Lee?

861
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,840
He’s just been actin´
so weird.

862
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,840
- Did he ever run away before?
- No.

863
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,440
- He’s very sensitive.
- Just like you.

864
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,320
- I’m not sensitive. He’s sensitive. I’m
- Barking

865
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,440
I’m just moody.

866
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,400
Dooley
Jerry Lee!

867
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,160
Well, maybe Byers is right.

868
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,000
- Maybe Jerry Lee just cant cut it anymore.
- Byers said that?

869
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,640
- Yeah, more than once.
- So, that’s why he assigned us to you.

870
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,560
Yep.

871
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,240
Where is he going?

872
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:08,320
Barking Dooley There he is!

873
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,600
Welles
In front of the storage building.

874
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,520
Jerry Lee!

875
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,560
Jerry Lee,
what are you doing?

876
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,400
I’m sorry, Jerry Lee.
Did I hurt your feelings?

877
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,760
- What’s with you?
- He’s not running away, Dooley. He wants you to follow him.

878
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,960
Jerry Lee Barking

879
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,880
Zeus, come!

880
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,440
- I think he’s on to something.
- I hate stairs.

881
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,800
Jerry Lee?

882
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,280
What do you got?
He’s keying in on something.

883
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,440
Whimpering
- Okay.

884
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,480
Okay, Jerry Lee,
back off.

885
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,920
- Move out of the way.
- What are you doing?

886
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,600
I’m picking the lock.
We do it all the time.

887
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,520
That’s what worries me.

888
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,520
Sighs You have a better idea?
- Yes.

889
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,400
One of us will stake out the room from across
the hall, the other will go get a warrant.

890
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,840
Jerry Lee and I
do not do warrants.

891
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,760
Or back doors.
What else don’t you do?

892
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,280
We don’t do flavored coffee. We don’t
do aroma therapy. We don’t do raw fish.

893
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,240
- Normally known as sushi.
- Yes, we don’t do that.

894
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,880
We don’t do tofu. We don’t do collagen.
We don’t do colonics.

895
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,720
We don’t do e-mail. We don’t do head
shrinkers, group therapy, social workers.

896
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,720
We don’t do cute little doggy outfits.
We don’t do shopping.

897
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,560
- We don’t do Near Beer or little speedos.
- Thank God.

898
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,400
- And we don’t do sporks.
- I get the point. I’ll get the warrant.

899
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,120
- Don’t touch the lock.
Jerry Lee Whines

900
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,280
And we don’t do, "Ooh, is that a pimple
on your back? Can I squeeze it?"

Zeus Barks

902
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,920

can’t touch that lock. Gunshot

Jerry Lee Howling

904
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,120
- That’s it.
Howling Continues

905
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,520
You’re a good singer.

906
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,560
Howling Intensifies
- Okay, were done singing now. All right? You happy?

907
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,200
Stop it! Stop! Come on.
The bad guys gonna hear us.

908
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,920
Yeah, see? Look. I could stuff you
and put you on the wall.

909
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,840
See?
Like a moose head.

910
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,960
You know, you’re
the best dog I ever had.

911
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,000
You’re the only dog I ever had,
but you’re still the number one guy.

912
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,280
You know, this is hard
for me to say, but-

913
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,680
Whimpers
Sniffing

914
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,520
- Get away from me. Is that
you? Was that you? Whimpers

915
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,760
Oh, my God! That is rancid!
Groaning

916
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,520
Banging On Door

917
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,320
Gagging

918
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,720
- What did you eat?
Banging Continues

919
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,960
Did you just cut another one?
Did you?

920
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,160
Gagging Continues
There’s something alien in you!

921
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,880
Whew! Whew!
Whew! Whew!

922
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,680
You’re off that
lamb and rice diet!

923
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,040
Oh, God!
Coughing

924
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,080
Dooley!

925
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,720
- Oh!
Whimpering

926
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,360
Oh!
Oh!

927
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,880
What is that smell?

928
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,920
- What? What smell?
- Oh, don’t tell me you don’t have a sense of smell.

929
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,760
- My God! My eyes are watering.
- It was Jerry Lee!

930
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,680
- Stop blaming the dog.
- Honest to God, it was Jerry Lee.

931
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,080
- That is so sad, man. You need to go to a doctor.
- No!

932
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,160
- I swear! It was Jerry Lee!
Whimpers Softly

933
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,120
All right, I got the warrant.
Shoot off the lock.

934
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,560
I advise you to wait, however,
considering the gas in this room.

935
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,480
- You’re gonna blow us up.
Gunshot

936
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,400
Seek.

937
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,160
Oh, yeah,
he’s a gun nut, all right.

938
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,040
Welles
Looks like he’s some kind of writer.

939
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,080
Everything’s written
under a different name.

940
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,440
He’s got pictures of his girlfriend
or his wife hanging up.

941
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,320
What?

942
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,080
Its not his wife.
It’s mine.

Jerry Lee Whimpering

944
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,200
Welles They’re picking
up the manuscripts later.

945
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,640
So, what do you think? I mean, they’re
all cop stories. Every one of ´’em.

946
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,360
Tracy was an editor.

947
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,560
That rejection letter
she wrote was really nice.

948
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,840
Tracy was nice in every way.

949
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,920
That’s why you disappeared
that night that we, um-

950
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,160
Kissed?

951
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,080
Yes.

952
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,680
I’m sorry about that.

953
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:28,840
No, don’t be sorry. It was nothing to
apologize for. You just weren’t ready.

954
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,760
Maybe.

955
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:37,480
Dooley, you really gotta stop
blaming yourself for what happened.

956
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,720
No, I’m serious.
Listen, people die.

957
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,400
That is a fact of life.

958
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,360
You’re a really good cop.

959
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,360
And so is Jerry Lee.
You got really great instincts.

960
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,760
You know?
And they cant teach you that.

961
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,720
Trust me, I know.

962
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,120
- Thanks.
- You’re welcome.

964
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,360
- Is he gonna bite me?
- Probably.

965
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,360
You know, that dog
is very co-dependent.

966
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,040
- Can I take him in the other room?
- You can try.

967
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,760
- Zeus? Ham, cheese?
Chuckles

968
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,200
- Look what I got. Look what I got.
Growling

969
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,560
Come on. Lets go
in the other room.

970
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,480
That’s good. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

971
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,960
That’s my finger.
No, that’s my finger. That’s my finger.

972
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,720
You want a time-out?
Want a time-out? Want a time-out?

973
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,960
My finger, my finger.
Let go, let go, let go.

974
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,280
- Thank you.
- Dooley!

975
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,440
- I’m not gonna share.
- Dooley, come here!

976
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,120
- What?
- Come here.

977
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,720
- What? - This guy- This
guy is writing about you.

978
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,680
He’s got everything. He’s got the
bank shoot-out, Harry Stipe, Fat Tommy.

979
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:58,640
- Who wrote this?
- Um, I don’t know. A guy named Jeffery Barnes.

980
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,240
- Probably a fake name.
- Barnes.

981
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,440
- No.
- These all have different pen names.

982
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,560
Who’s the hero?

983
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,520
Devon Lane.

984
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,760
Right? Yeah.
Devon Lane.

985
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,800
Devon Lane.
Devon Lane.

986
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:19,480
I don’t know why I-
I know Devon Lane.

987
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,680
Devon Lane turned in
a manuscript to Tracy.

988
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,680
She rejected it,
but she wanted me to meet with him...

1157
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,520
I don’t wanna help you. You’re an idiot.
You’re a nut. You’re a jerk.

1158
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,160
You understand English,
or do I need to speak in Dutch?

1159
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,040
Zeus!
Dutch

1160
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,200
Yelling, Shouting

1161
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,080
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1162
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,520
Byers
He’s going upstairs! Let’s go!

1163
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,960
Come on, Dooley!
You can make it!

1164
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:09,520
Only two more flights,
Dooley!

1165
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,400
Jerry Lee Barking
Devon Come on, old man!

1166

Groans

1167

Jerry Lee Barking

1168
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,640
I need E.M.S. vehicles and a SWAT team
on the roof. Right away!

1169
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:41,640
You’re pathetic, Dooley!

1170
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,360
What Tracy saw in you,
Ill never know.

1171
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,360
Groaning
- You didn’t deserve her!

1172
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,680
Aah!

1173
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,040
She said my character
was strong.

1174
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,600
She said I had potential!

1175
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,000
Come on, Dooley!

1176
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,120
Come on, old man!

1177
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,560
Panting, Groaning

1178
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,960
She wrote me a letter, Dooley!
She ever write you a letter?

1179
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,920
You moron!

1180
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,440
That letter she wrote you
was a rejection letter!

1181
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,520
Rejection?

1182
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:41,680
- Aah!
- How do you like the ending to my book, Dooley?

1183
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,880
- Do it!
- Ill do it when I’m ready.

1184
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,560
Do it!

1185
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,080
Go ahead!
Do it!

1186
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,520
Shut up!

1187
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,720
I’m in control here, Dooley.

1188
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,040
This is my story,
not yours!

1189
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,560
Where do you want it?

1190
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,480
Cause I’m deciding where you
should get the next bullet.

1191
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,440
You got any preferences?

1192
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,760
Is this real enough for you,
Dooley?

1193
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:20,440
- You did it! What took you so long?
Whimpering

1194
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,920
Indistinct Shouting
- I knew you could do it, buddy.

1195
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,760
Welles, cuff him.

1196
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,640
Jerry Lee Barking

1197
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,800
Wait!
You cant have dogs in here.

1198
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,160
They’re police officers,
ma´am.

1199
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,080
They’re dogs!
Get them out of here.

1200
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,120
The California State Health Code,
section 4578, says absolutely...

1201
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:11,240
under no circumstances are dogs
allowed in the hospital.

1202
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,760
Woman On P.A.,
Indistinct

1203
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,640
Whimpers

01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,320
Barks Softly

1205
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,960
Muttering

1206
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,320
What? Come on.
Jerry Lee.

1207
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,440
Come on. Don’t slime me.
Your breath is so bad.

1208
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:08,520
What have you been eating?
Chuckling

1209
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,640
Okay. I’m okay.

1210
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,000
Don’t do that!
Groans

1211
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,200
Welles, I wanna thank you
for picking me up.

1212
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,200
Are you actually showing me
some gratitude, Dooley?

1213
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,800
- Well, yeah, I’m trying.
- Good boy.

1214
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,920
- I am not a dog.
- Yes, you are.

1215
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,840
- Dogs get treats.
- Treats?

1216
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,160
Dinner. What do you want?
Chinese or Italian?

1217
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,320
Oh, you pick.
Your choice.

1218
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,800
- Oh, you’re actually giving me a choice?
- Yes, your choice.

1219
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,000
- Well, then I pick Chinese.
- Chinese is fine.

1220
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:40,280
No, that’s what you wanted me to say.
We’re going for Italian.

1221
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,720
- Well, Italian is fine.
- You actually want Italian?

1222
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,640
- Yes.
- Then we are going for Chinese.

1223
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,960
- Chinese is fine. I don’t care.
- Yeah, sure you don’t.

1224
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,240
Works every time,
Jerry Lee.
