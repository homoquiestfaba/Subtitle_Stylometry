1
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,411
You speak English?

2
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,182
Kru po, he teaches you right?

3
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,156
Listen, I wanna
train with kru po!

4
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,159
I have cash.

5
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,371
I just wanna train.

6
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,191
What the hell man?

7
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,860
I can't take you to kru po,
if you have no skills.

8
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,386
- Hey!

9
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:42,955
Prove it!

10
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,997
Kavi fights better
when he's drunk.

11
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,600
Yeah, he's so drunk
it's almost a fair fight.

12
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,500
-He's very fast.
-No, you're very slow.

13
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,022
<i> Por favor.</i>

14
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,207
Thank you.

15
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,943
I just lost my
position as doorman.

16
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,779
-You started it.
-What?

17
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,015
You attacked me.

18
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,720
I come a long way.
I wanna train with tong po.

19
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,588
I wanna train with master po.

20
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,781
Put it back.

21
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,691
And the money.

22
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,099
You know what, keep it.

23
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,170
-All of it?
-Yeah.

24
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,873
You need it more than I do.

25
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,086
<i> You fighters from</i>
<i> around the world</i>

26
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,256
<i> have been invited to</i>
<i> train with master po.</i>

27
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,558
<i> And witness the impossible.</i>

28
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,227
<i> Now, you might think</i>
<i> that master po</i>

29
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,163
<i>has run out of the unthinkable.</i>

30
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,533
But he'd like to challenge
himself and stay creative.

31
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,568
And continue to inspire you all

32
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,937
with an infinite imagination.

33
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,140
Check it out!

34
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,468
The universe is composed
of particles.

35
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:54,039
Which are subjected to
the power of the focus.

36
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,774
Quiet mind.

37
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,742
Again I say!

38
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,811
Check it out!

39
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,236
And can I get an amen?

40
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,303
Amen!

41
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,840
That's what I'm talking
about. The fight will begin.

42
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,748
Unless first, somebody
wanna challenge master po.

43
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:42,787
You mean to tell me there's
nobody here batshit crazy enough

44
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,023
to go a couple rounds
with the master?

45
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,534
- Can I get another amen?
- Amen!

46
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,672
Let's fight.

47
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,925
The next round we
will add weapons.

48
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,926
You come here to kill me?

49
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,074
Sloane.

50
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,413
Your brother was brave,
your brother was a warrior.

51
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:27,085
Unlike you.
Such a coward.

52
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,823
Come to my home
with a gun

53
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,926
to kill me in my sleep.

54
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,079
Ladies and gentlemen
my brother Eric Sloane,

55
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,448
world champion.

56
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,721
Come on,
you do it.

57
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,290
-We're gonna do this?
-Absolutely.

58
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,492
Alright.

59
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,301
One more time, one more time.
Ready?

60
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,206
I need a drink.

61
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,482
- I'm gonna get some wine.
- Well, look who it is.

62
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,651
What brings you to
this side of town?

63
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,620
Here to see the
fabulous Eric Sloane.

64
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,756
-You look great.
-Thank you.

65
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,325
You've made a quiet
a name for yourself.

66
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,160
I'm working on it.

67
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,496
Almost a modern day warrior.

68
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:45,764
Almost.

69
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,399
Heard you won the gold.

70
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,436
--Yeah, I did.

71
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,505
So, what's next?

72
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,006
I don't know.

73
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,642
Probably expand the gym,
get some new equipment.

74
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,978
Well, I have an idea.

75
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,913
I bet you do my dear.

76
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,248
You're gonna have
to talk to Kurt

77
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,550
because he's my manager
now as well as my trainer.

78
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,685
Always looking out
for baby brother,

79
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,654
-i love that about you.
-Taking care of him?

80
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,089
Are you kidding me,
he takes care of me.

81
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,024
This kid always pushes me
in the right direction,

82
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,527
and pulls me with no
strings attached unlike

83
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,297
-some people in this game.
-Hm. Right.

84
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,699
So, who wants to go to Thailand?

85
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,835
Jesus, can you give a
guy a moment of victory?

86
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:24,969
We're having a party here.

87
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,239
-I'm talking immortality.
-Immortality.

88
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:28,239
-No rules, no ref.

89
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:31,876
Just your wit and skill
to keep you alive.

90
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,178
What do you mean no rules?

91
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,713
No wait, I heard about these
underground fights over here,

92
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,416
but, uh, what's in it for us?

93
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,852
Well 200k right now.

94
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,024
And 200 when you land.

95
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,460
And the chance to be
remembered for a lifetime.

96
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,564
Alright, now we're talking.
Keep going.

97
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,099
I've got this fighter
by the name of tong po.

98
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,402
He's an undefeated
muay thai champ.

99
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,469
And I think you can take it,

100
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,539
and make us all
a ton of cash while doing so.

101
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,642
Kurt, wanna go to Thailand?

102
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,245
You know what let's
talk about it later.

103
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,614
Let's have a drink!
It's a party!

104
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,449
<i> Just don't let her</i>
<i> get into your head.</i>

105
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,951
<i> It's not her getting</i>
<i> into my head,</i>

106
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,118
have you ever seen this
kind of cash before?

107
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,187
We could buy this place
and be set for life.

108
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,691
Eric, if you decline it's okay.

109
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,626
It's not for everyone.

110
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,963
<i> She comes in, looks</i>
<i> at you, smiles at you,</i>

111
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,297
and you fall into her trap?

112
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,398
She's a crook!

113
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,766
She's a fight promoter
Kurt, they're all crooks.

114
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:29,968
Our job is to get as much
cash load

115
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,102
as we can while I'm on top.

116
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,237
You don't know what
you're walking into.

117
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,371
Jesus Christ, Kurt,

118
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,672
you're driving me crazy
with this already.

119
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,140
You know that thai champ
should be worried about me.

120
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,376
I'm a badass, you know that?
Stop being a coward.

121
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,144
I'm looking out for
you and your career.

122
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,814
No, stay here and do what
you do best, just worry.

123
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,484
You really think you can take
the thai champ at his sport?

124
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,253
Are you that arrogant?

125
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,787
Well, I know you don't,

126
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,090
so I guess
I'll be doing this alone.

127
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,195
Thanks for the party.

128
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:05,169
-You're just gonna walk away?
-I'm walking toward a future.

129
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,941
Hey, Kurt!

130
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,144
Kurt!

131
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,515
You got something from Eric.

132
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,662
-He's fighting in a week.

133
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,603
His gold medal?

134
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,141
I gotta go to Thailand.

135
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,202
Get up!
Come on!

136
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,884
Eric! Get out!

137
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,387
Eric!

138
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,455
Eric!

139
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,567
I'm so sorry.

140
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,651
Kurt.

141
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,960
-You set him up.
-We got him the best trainer.

142
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,962
He trained his ass off.

143
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,434
Eric knew what he was
getting himself into.

144
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,603
Sometimes these
things just happen.

145
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,273
--You killed him!

146
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,144
This is on you.
This is all on you!

147
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,522
I'm just gonna say
goodbye and then I'll leave.

148
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,573
<i> Taking care of him?</i>

149
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:22,573
<i> Are you kidding me,</i>
<i> he takes care of me.</i>

150
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:22,573
<i> This kid always pushes</i>
<i> me in the right direction</i>

151
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:28,079
<i> and pulls me with</i>
<i> no strings attached.</i>

152
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:03,981
Who's this?

153
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,351
I think this is your
brother's trainer.

154
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,587
I think he may have
something for you.

155
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,701
Do you mind?
I'm training him.

156
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,043
Are you durand?
-Yes I am.

157
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,547
-This is Eric's brother.

158
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,653
-Here.

159
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,558
This is Eric's fee
for his fight.

160
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,827
He wanted you to have this.

161
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,097
If anything happened to him.

162
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,966
And of course,

163
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,138
it did.

164
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:09,313
You're making a joke.
-Do I look like I'm laughing?

165
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,016
You trained
my brother muay thai?

166
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,217
Yes I did.

167
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,719
Why would you let
him fight that monster?

168
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,054
I train people.

169
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,826
I don't tell them when to fight
and who to fight.

170
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,466
You didn't train him
well enough, did you?

171
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,875
We have to go.
Kurt! Let's go!

172
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,203
<i> I'm putting you on a</i>
<i> plane out of the country.</i>

173
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:11,208
<i> If you stay, come back,</i>
<i> you will go to jail.</i>

174
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:12,843
You get it?

175
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,111
<i> Oh, Mr. Sloane.</i>

176
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:56,854
We normally would welcome you
to master po's humble home,

177
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:59,657
but it's clear that you're
here with dubious intentions.

178
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,960
But when Michael corleone
was sitting in the restaurant

179
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:06,063
across from the two man who
attempted to kill his father,

180
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,600
many argued that he was
wrestling with his conscious

181
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:12,836
to whether or not he could
kill them in cold blood.

182
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,774
I however believe that
the decision were made

183
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:18,576
the night he visited his father.

184
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:21,045
And saw him barely
alive in the hospital.

185
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:26,250
He had no choice really.
He had to pull the trigger.

186
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,957
<i> And as for you Mr. Sloane,</i>

187
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,727
all you had to do
was pull the trigger.

188
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,933
I should have.

189
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,267
You're coming with me.

190
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,628
By going after
tong po like that,

191
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,331
you made things very
hard on yourself.

192
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,166
And on my investigation.

193
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,235
You're the only eye witness
wiling to come forward

194
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:54,071
and now you're credibility's
gonna be questioned.

195
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:55,272
Credibility?

196
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,777
Hi-ya!

197
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,812
I guess I should thank
you for saving my life.

198
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,815
I'm the one that put you there.

199
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,349
You know I have orders
to arrest you?

200
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,819
What about those guys
in the street?

201
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,687
We'll take care of them.

202
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,989
In the meantime your
brother's trainer has agreed

203
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,991
to shelter you here.

204
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:32,129
-When did that happen?
-It's just for a few days.

205
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,224
Train me to fight tong po.

206
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,038
I failed Eric.

207
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,379
What am I gonna do with you?

208
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:47,304
You're gonna help
me make this right.

209
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,333
I will train you.

210
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,405
We wake up at five.
No coffee break.

211
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,633
-What's going on?
-Forgot to numb the nerves.

212
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,708
Shh.

213
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,484
Oh, my god.
-What?

214
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,087
-What are those from?
-Training.

215
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:58,822
What kind of training
does that to you?

216
00:35:58,824 --> 00:35:59,956
Training with durand.

217
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,263
<i> Why are you putting</i>
<i> yourself through that?</i>

218
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:08,598
<i> When I'm training,</i>
<i> when I'm in that place</i>

219
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,701
the pain just
turns my brain off.

220
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,971
I don't feel anything.

221
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,610
That's good.

222
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,688
How do you feel?

223
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:34,858
-You're crazy.
-I'm crazy?

224
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,661
One more time.

225
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,245
Just give me a minute
to catch my breath.

226
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,386
Why would you do that?

227
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,256
Do you think tong po
would give you a break?

228
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:28,945
Splits?
We have more to do.

229
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,257
-You look tired.
-Are you tired?

230
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:43,793
-He gets tired so easy.
-Why don't you rest?

231
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,462
-He won't let me.

232
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,265
Let's have a coconut break.

233
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:50,667
-Coconuts!
-Coconut break!

234
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,403
You like coconuts?

235
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,114
You're supposed to try
to crack open the coconuts.

236
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,782
Let me show you.

237
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,025
Kurt.

238
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,072
I'm ready durand.

239
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:05,608
-You're ready?
-I am ready.

240
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,677
See? I am ready.

241
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:49,419
Oh. You think
you're ready? Let's get a drink.

242
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,601
Oh, he was
unlucky wasn't he?

243
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,570
- Huh?

244
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:43,206
Is there anyone that
can beat my fighter?

245
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,108
Five thousand baht.

246
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,946
If you can last two rounds
gets you 50,000 baht.

247
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:51,681
Anyone?

248
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:52,749
Anyone?

249
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:56,719
Aw.

250
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,088
Master durand.

251
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,091
- Lovely to see you again mate.

252
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:07,096
Ah, you've brought me some
more easy money have ya?

253
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,632
--I'm just messing with ya.

254
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,734
Joseph king by name.

255
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:15,605
- Joe king by nature, huh?

256
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,475
Eh, looks stuck
up this one, yeah?

257
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,610
- Yeah.
- What can I do for ya?

258
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,745
Two rounds.

259
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,386
Your funeral.

260
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,622
-5,000, two rounds?
-That's right.

261
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:35,058
-With him?
-You're ready, no?

262
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,025
This way.

263
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,694
Like I said before,
just stay put.

264
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:54,364
You cannot leave this compound.
Do you understand?

265
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,633
It's just not safe
for you out there.

266
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,968
Just come by anytime,
I'll be right here.

267
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,471
Wait a second, you said
he was in training.

268
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,640
Training for what exactly?

269
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:06,342
I'm a trainer.
That's what I do.

270
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,544
You stay away from tong po.

271
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:11,314
I'll keep him busy.
Don't worry.

272
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,850
And just stay put, okay?

273
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,285
Don't make me
bring you an ankle bracelet.

274
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,130
--Great distraction.

275
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,101
And not a distraction.

276
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,304
What are you doing here?

277
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,273
They kicked me out.

278
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,377
He's from
tong po's camp.

279
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,279
Please, come.

280
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:57,326
Just go for a second,
i need to talk to him.

281
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,931
Why did you come here?

282
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:08,371
Maybe you came here to get a
reward from the cops, right?

283
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:14,444
Or maybe you came here
because of your master,

284
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:16,946
tong po.

285
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:21,050
-Look, master durand.
-Yes?

286
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:26,789
Maybe... maybe you should
have trained Eric better.

287
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:35,858
Tell me the truth.

288
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,162
Okay, I work for tong po.

289
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:42,665
Now you work for me.
And Kurt.

290
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,868
-How am I gonna get paid?
-Get paid?

291
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:50,072
You will keep your teeth.
Laundry.

292
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,342
Stop drinking
and start to train.

293
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:55,945
You're good.

294
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,632
Not impressed by
your performance.

295
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,068
Never gonna win going back.

296
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,914
Tighter.

297
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:39,515
--Tighter.

298
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,750
Yeah, that's good.

299
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:44,387
Come from the inside.
Push up the chin.

300
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,423
Hands up, break hard.

301
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,149
If you're afraid to die
in a fight with tong po,

302
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,284
you're dead.

303
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,354
I don't want to lose two sons.

304
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:32,501
Tong po's head.

305
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,604
Tong po! Tong po!

306
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,282
Tong po!

307
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,284
Tong po!

308
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:57,386
Tong po!

309
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,221
Come on, tong po!

310
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:04,727
Tong po!
I challenge you to a fight!

311
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:12,368
Storm!

312
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,708
Let's go, bring it.

313
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:56,238
Master po has gladly
accepted your challenge.

314
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:58,374
Be prepared.

315
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:08,918
<i> Master po has gladly</i>
<i> accepted your challenge.</i>

316
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,954
<i> Eric's little brother</i>
<i> wants revenge.</i>

317
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:14,857
<i> A grudge match.</i>

318
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:30,773
<i> Tong po!</i>

319
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,608
<i> I challenge you to a fight!</i>

320
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,745
Huh?

321
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:53,629
Wattona, darling?
What seems to be the problem?

322
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,664
Your place is compromised.

323
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:57,533
Do you know what we could
do with this information

324
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:59,001
knowing that she's listening?

325
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,937
We could send her to a
much better place for us.

326
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,975
<i>It's been her crusade for years.</i>

327
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:08,811
<i> Without her,</i>
<i>none of this would be happening.</i>

328
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:17,853
Without her,
doesn't that sound ideal?

329
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,327
You want it clean or messy?

330
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:27,563
Make her an example.

331
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,125
You don't have to do this.

332
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:12,594
This is for your own good.

333
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,865
You're both under arrest.

334
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,100
You're a fugitive.

335
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,102
You're harboring a fugitive.

336
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:25,474
Love and muay thai don't mix.

337
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,990
So your girlfriend won't
let you fight tong po.

338
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:47,663
We have to get out of here.

339
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,235
Okay.

340
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,030
<i> Vous parlez francais?</i>

341
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:00,903
Hey.

342
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,971
Forgot about me?

343
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:10,846
Hey!

344
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,389
Sorry.

345
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,332
Hey!

346
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,582
Come on!

347
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,816
Whoops.

348
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,356
Let's go.

349
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,684
Just let everyone know

350
01:00:55,686 --> 01:00:57,386
initial bets can be
placed before the first round.

351
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,254
No betting during fight time.

352
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,909
A man's strength
in muay thai

353
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:24,179
is not just
his destructive capacity.

354
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:29,184
<i> There are often 30 to 50</i>
<i> deaths in the ring each year.</i>

355
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:33,455
One of those deaths
occurred not so long ago.

356
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:35,757
Right here on this spot.

357
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:40,362
Another will occur today,
right here.

358
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:43,165
Let's meet the challenger!

359
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,249
Kurt Sloane.

360
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:05,754
The brother of the last man
who died by tong po's hand.

361
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:10,992
<i> His fury over the death</i>
<i> of his brother</i>

362
01:02:10,994 --> 01:02:14,796
<i> has led to one attempt</i>
<i> at tong po's life.</i>

363
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:19,968
He wants revenge so much
that he broke out of jail

364
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:25,307
just to be here with us today
and face his formidable enemy

365
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,943
in mortal combat!

366
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,448
Ladies and gentlemen,

367
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:38,019
the undisputed champion
of all champions,

368
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:42,824
the man who defies
the laws of physics.

369
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:48,663
The man who is responsible
for more than half the deaths

370
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,433
in the ring in the
last two years,

371
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,035
usually in the first round.

372
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:58,240
- I give you tong po!

373
01:02:58,242 --> 01:02:59,541
<i> Tong po!</i>

374
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:03,545
<i> Tong po, tong po, tong po!</i>

375
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,415
<i> Tong po, tong po, tong po!</i>

376
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:10,952
<i> Tong po, tong po, tong po...</i>

377
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:31,506
You know what to do.
Don't think about anything else.

378
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:38,313
That champion's amulet has been
around his neck for too long.

379
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,950
Now you have the spirit
of muay thai in you

380
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:44,119
and he's going down.

381
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:22,524
Fighters!

382
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,175
The rounds will be progressive,

383
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,277
weapons will be added,

384
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:44,512
chosen by me.

385
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:50,151
But the first round is only on
the eight points of contact.

386
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:55,123
Ready to die...

387
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:00,295
After you.

388
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,430
Back to your corner!

389
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:11,439
Champion!

390
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:14,542
Challenger.

391
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:22,851
Fight!

392
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,058
Come on, up.

393
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:25,907
Is it done?

394
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:27,308
Half of 'em lined up.

395
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,711
<i> Anyone betting on Kurt?</i>

396
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,646
<i> Couple of guys</i>
<i> went for the odds.</i>

397
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:33,481
Just about three mil on tong po.

398
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:37,218
I'm gonna have po stretch it
out a round, even the odds.

399
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:48,063
Sit down.

400
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,101
You're doing well.

401
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:56,671
What fight are you watching?

402
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:57,739
This one, come on.

403
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:03,545
You're doing exactly
what I want, okay?

404
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:04,813
You're doing very well.

405
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:20,795
Surprise, surprise, surprise.

406
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,566
The challenger is still alive.

407
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:27,102
So let's up the ante.

408
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,705
Second stanza, glass.

409
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,881
Place your bets.

410
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:26,661
<i> Tong po, tong po,</i>
<i> tong po...</i>

411
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:08,997
Come on, get up.

412
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:14,829
Again.

413
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:37,979
Sit down.

414
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:44,485
Okay.

415
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,688
-How you doing?
-Not good.

416
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:49,056
Remember,

417
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:51,526
he's just a man.

418
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:55,296
Like you, his bones can
break and he can bleed.

419
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,865
Now go in there and take
that son of a bitch out.

420
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:02,136
Come on.

421
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:04,439
Let's go.

422
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:30,965
You're under arrest.

423
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,368
Look, you should
really check this out

424
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:35,837
before you do something stupid.

425
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,872
I've got some juice
down in Metro.

426
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:41,309
Yeah, I know all about it.
It'll come out in prosecution.

427
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,581
I'll be out in a day.

428
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:12,039
I am in a state of shock,
Sloane's heart is still beating.

429
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:17,879
He's proven himself a worthy
opponent for master po.

430
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:22,383
And with that we move
into our final round,

431
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,953
and the weapons shall
be our double swords.

432
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:40,968
Death is imminent.

433
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:58,119
Fight!

434
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,633
Get up. The swords.
Get up!

435
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:51,098
<i> Your brother was brave.</i>
<i> Your brother was a warrior.</i>

436
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:57,071
<i> Unlike you, such a coward.</i>

437
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,875
If you're afraid to die
in a fight with tong po,

438
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:03,044
you're dead.

439
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:06,013
<i> I don't want to lose two sons.</i>

440
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,019
You don't have to do this.

441
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:48,289
Come on.

442
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:14,181
You're a warrior
and he's going down.

443
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:50,151
Come on.

444
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:56,490
That's my boy.

445
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,150
Coconut.

446
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:01,455
Again, coconut!

447
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,029
Come on.

448
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:37,157
- Yeah!

449
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:55,669
This is for Eric.

450
01:23:58,700 --> 01:23:59,800
Eh!
