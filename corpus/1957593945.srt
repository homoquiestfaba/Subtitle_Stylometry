1
00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:04,541
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:16,962
(somber orchestral music)

3
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:22,336
- I desperately loved my husband

4
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:24,495
and I wanted to share everything.

5
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:27,206
I thought we were a very good team.

6
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:29,533
- [Interviewer] Around
1986, Prince Charles

7
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:33,351
resumed his relationship with
Mrs. Camilla Parker Bowles.

8
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:35,053
Were you aware of that?

9
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:36,587
- Yes.

10
00:00:36,587 --> 00:00:40,300
But I wasn't in a position
to do anything about it.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,138
I had this feeling of
being no good at anything,

12
00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:46,470
being useless and hopeless
and failed in every direction.

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,952
- [Interviewer] So, in private,

14
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:51,172
you were almost to the point
of living separate lives.

15
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:53,281
How did you cope in public?

16
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:55,912
- Charles and I had our duty to perform

17
00:00:55,912 --> 00:00:57,829
and that was paramount.

18
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:02,689
(dramatic fanfare music)

19
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:10,073
(somber orchestral music)
(photographers shouting)

20
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:10,332
(acoustic guitar music)

21
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:14,481
Charles, you can't be leaving.

22
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:15,910
- What's that funny smell?

23
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,485
- Tanning lotion, don't
change the subject.

24
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:18,775
(Charles scoffs)

25
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:21,013
Surely you're not going.

26
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:21,846
- I am.

27
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:25,861
- But this holiday has been
on our diary for months.

28
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:27,808
Are you that bored?

29
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,118
What do I tell King Juan Carlos?

30
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:30,557
He'll be so offended.

31
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:33,232
And what about the boys
after you promised?

32
00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:35,133
- Oh, for heaven's sake,
Diana, Harry's two.

33
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,187
I'll hardly be missed.

34
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:38,270
I have to go.

35
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,903
- Charles.

36
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:44,408
Charles, where do you have to go?

37
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,066
- Balmoral.

38
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,034
- Actually Scotland?

39
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,202
And who at Balmoral is so important

40
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:52,019
to make you abandon your
wife and your children.

41
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,686
- The Queen's asked me to come up.

42
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:56,204
- The Queen?

43
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:57,829
And no one else will be there?

44
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,627
- Well, I suppose there will
be a number of invited guests.

45
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:02,346
- She's going to be there, isn't she?

46
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:04,096
- My plane's waiting.

47
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:06,806
- Not this time, Charles.

48
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:08,223
Please, don't go.

49
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,989
(somber orchestral music)

50
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,138
- My dear, I have obligations.

51
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:24,590
Surely you must understand that by now.

52
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,257
- I'll be so lonely without you.

53
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:30,844
Please don't leave me.

54
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,055
- (exhales) Diana, in the past
numerous of my good friends

55
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:37,590
have extended their friendship to you,

56
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,302
but you chose not to avail yourself of it.

57
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:43,126
You wouldn't be so lonely
if you'd take advantage

58
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:46,959
of the opportunity when
it's presented to you.

59
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,833
(dramatic orchestral music)

60
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:08,996
(upbeat piano music)
(party guests chattering)

61
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:13,098
(whispering)

62
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:14,492
- Your Royal Highness,
may I have the honor

63
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:17,409
of presenting Captain James Hewitt?

64
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,122
- Your Royal Highness.

65
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:26,978
- Captain.

66
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:34,333
So, there I was, not even
nine, galloping on my pony.

67
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,144
I adored him.

68
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:37,658
His name was Romaly.

69
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:39,710
We were at Sandringham Park.

70
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,914
He stumbled, I fell and broke my arm.

71
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,126
- Oh no.

72
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:44,141
- There you have it.

73
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:46,516
I'm afraid I quite lost my nerve.

74
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:48,248
- Well, we can soon remedy that.

75
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:51,426
I happen to be a staff captain
of the household division.

76
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:53,358
The stables are my responsibility.

77
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:54,191
- Really?

78
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,439
I would so like to get over my fear.

79
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,638
The whole family ride, you know.

80
00:05:59,638 --> 00:06:01,364
All they talk of is horses.

81
00:06:01,364 --> 00:06:02,649
- I know.

82
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:04,971
I play polo against your
husband quite often.

83
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:07,723
- Of course, this would be
for my own satisfaction.

84
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:08,687
- Well, it should be simple enough

85
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:11,901
to arrange a series of lessons
for you at the barracks.

86
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:16,442
Quite convenient, I believe,
ma'am, for Kensington Palace.

87
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,359
- How kind.

88
00:06:19,017 --> 00:06:20,184
I'll ring you.

89
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:25,542
(car engine humming)

90
00:06:31,946 --> 00:06:34,388
- [Staff Member] Your Royal Highness.

91
00:06:34,388 --> 00:06:35,221
- [Diana] Goodnight, Matthew.

92
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:37,782
- [Matthew] Goodnight, ma'am.

93
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:39,254
- Is my husband in his study?

94
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:40,486
- Prince Charles telephoned, ma'am,

95
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:42,801
to say that he's been
detained at Highgrove.

96
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:43,801
- Thank you.

97
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:48,393
(somber orchestral music)

98
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,387
(children giggling)

99
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:28,102
(children giggling)

100
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:36,853
Who's hiding in my bed?

101
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:37,970
Hello, my darlings.

102
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,249
- [William] Hello, Mummy.

103
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:41,151
- Are you my little soldiers
coming to protect me?

104
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:43,201
(boys chattering)
(Diana gasps)

105
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,846
(boys chattering)

106
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:46,679
Shh.

107
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:49,333
Mummy's very tired, let's go to sleep.

108
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,368
- Yeah, but you've been
bitten on your feet.

109
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:53,201
- Oh, I love you so much.

110
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:54,953
- You've been bitten on your feet.

111
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:56,098
- Have I?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:58,574
- I'm sure it will go
away when I go to sleep.

113
00:07:58,574 --> 00:08:00,861
You should go to sleep.

114
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:02,635
- [Harry] But I want my daddy.

115
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:03,956
- Well, Daddy's not here now.

116
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:05,210
He'll be back later.

117
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,043
- [Harry] Will he stay?

118
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:07,366
- I don't know.

119
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,699
Come on, Mummy's very tired.

120
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:14,011
(birds chirping)

121
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:19,306
No, Matthew, listen to this.

122
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:24,111
"What is worth more than
half a million pounds,

123
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,860
"weighs well over a ton, and requires

124
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,145
"as much attention as William and Harry?

125
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:31,027
"Diana's wardrobe."

126
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:34,541
- Oh, they're always picking on you.

127
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,421
- Oh no, look at this.

128
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:37,817
I look absolutely dreadful.

129
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,540
Look at my nose, I look like a witch.

130
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,869
- Look at this.

131
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:42,526
Now, this is a particularly good one.

132
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:43,557
Look how slim you are.

133
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,788
Like a model in Vogue.

134
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:46,638
You look sensational.

135
00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:47,712
- Do you really think so?

136
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:48,545
- I do.

137
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:53,040
- People think all I do is shop.

138
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,904
But I have, what?

139
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:57,863
Over 200 public appearances every year.

140
00:08:57,863 --> 00:09:00,184
And every one of them expect me to look

141
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:04,401
like the British fashion
industry's most elegant mannequin.

142
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:06,766
Everywhere I go I have
photographers yelling,

143
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:08,897
"Oh, come on, Di, look up."

144
00:09:08,897 --> 00:09:10,555
"Give us a picture and
I can put my children

145
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:12,119
"through a better school."

146
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,752
It makes me feel like I'm
nothing more than a product.

147
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:17,011
- A product that sells
well, I'm afraid, ma'am.

148
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:20,095
- I'm surprised the firm
hasn't made me wear a label.

149
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:21,600
By appointment to Her Majesty the Queen.

150
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,591
(Matthew chuckles)

151
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:24,576
- But Your Royal Highness, if you aren't

152
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:25,913
on the front page, there's no one else

153
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,200
half as nice to look at.

154
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,684
- What would I do without you?

155
00:09:30,684 --> 00:09:32,017
Oh, you're back.

156
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,665
Has my husband returned
from the hunt, then?

157
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:39,458
- He'll be along shortly, ma'am.

158
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,441
- Been detained, has he?

159
00:09:41,441 --> 00:09:44,419
Nigel, I thought you were
supposed to protect my husband.

160
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,581
Or have you more pressing duties?

161
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:49,081
Like spying on me?

162
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:55,523
(upbeat orchestral music)

163
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:57,061
- [Charles] Terrible job being my wife.

164
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:59,520
Bloody awful, I imagine.

165
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,734
- (chuckles) Quite the contrary, darling.

166
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,657
Just a bit ironic that
the primary prerequisite

167
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:06,741
should be virginity. (laughs)

168
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:08,655
Given a man of your appetites.

169
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:09,982
- (chuckles) Oh, Camilla.

170
00:10:09,982 --> 00:10:12,418
- Terrible creature, who said that?

171
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:14,110
I'll behave, darling, I promise.

172
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,943
- No, don't.

173
00:10:14,943 --> 00:10:16,129
This is the only fun I ever have.

174
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:19,385
(Camilla laughs)

175
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,725
- Do you think Diana's really too involved

176
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:22,184
with her detective?

177
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:24,901
- No, she's too involved with herself.

178
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:28,074
Well, I was pressured into taking a wife.

179
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:29,846
I ended up with a schoolgirl

180
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,354
who'd benefit from a good spanking.

181
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:32,741
(Camilla laughs)

182
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:35,039
- Mustn't get excited, my pet.

183
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,136
Unless you're to stay the afternoon.

184
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:41,303
(upbeat orchestral music)
(Camilla laughing)

185
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:48,630
(Camilla groans)

186
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,842
(Charles groans)

187
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:51,751
- (laughs) Slow coach.

188
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,168
(both laugh)

189
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:56,437
- [Charles] You'll be the death of me.

190
00:10:56,437 --> 00:10:58,020
I couldn't keep up.

191
00:10:59,344 --> 00:11:02,508
- Isn't that what you're supposed
to say to your young wife?

192
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:04,576
(both laugh)

193
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,993
(both breathing heavily)

194
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,037
- Oh, if only.

195
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,691
- But she's so beautiful.

196
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:16,299
If only what?

197
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,966
- If only she could be like you.

198
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:25,196
(horse hooves clomping)

199
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:40,844
- This way, ma'am.

200
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:47,626
I selected the perfect
horse for you, ma'am.

201
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:48,959
His name's Gary.

202
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:54,790
He's gentle and really very sedate.

203
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,738
I'll give you a leg up, ma'am.

204
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:59,488
One, two, three, hup.

205
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:07,767
- [Diana] You make it seem so easy.

206
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:08,845
- [James] That's my job.

207
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:10,032
Relax your hands.

208
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:11,305
That's better.

209
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:13,894
- [Diana] And are you this
good at everything you do?

210
00:12:13,894 --> 00:12:16,383
- [James] Well, I like a challenge, ma'am.

211
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:18,443
- [Diana] Do you like
being in the military?

212
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:19,556
- [James] Love it.

213
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:21,402
It's what my father did before me.

214
00:12:21,402 --> 00:12:24,030
- But you must get transferred
from place to place.

215
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,844
Isn't that difficult for your wife?

216
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:27,732
- I'm not married.

217
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:30,014
- Your girlfriend, then.

218
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:33,690
- I regret to inform you, ma'am,
that I'm a lonely bachelor.

219
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,857
I do hope one day to be
married and have children.

220
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:42,857
(Charles and the children laughing)

221
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:46,002
- You can't get away from me. (laughs)

222
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:47,429
Whoa, I've got you, Harry.

223
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:48,262
I've got you.

224
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:49,590
You go and sleep, huh?

225
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,139
Now, Will (mumbles).
(William laughing)

226
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,778
You can't escape.

227
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:54,110
You can't escape me.

228
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,780
Run for your life, run for your life.

229
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,373
Ah-ha!

230
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:58,946
No, you can't move there.

231
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,793
We've got to catch him now.

232
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:03,020
You gotta help me get (mumbles).

233
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,283
And young Harry's going
to win the grand national.

234
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:07,790
Congratulations, Harry.

235
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,290
(upbeat orchestral music)

236
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:21,276
- Your Royal Highness, whoa.

237
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:23,872
Ah, that was brilliant, ma'am.

238
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:26,023
You're a fast learner, ma'am.

239
00:13:26,023 --> 00:13:26,856
- Am I?

240
00:13:28,978 --> 00:13:32,395
All compliments gratefully accepted, sir.

241
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,202
- You're coming along beautifully.

242
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:38,330
Remarkable progress.

243
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,663
(soft orchestral music)

244
00:13:43,338 --> 00:13:46,331
You're doing a splendid job of growing.

245
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:47,998
I'm so proud of you.

246
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,796
Plants need encouragement.

247
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:54,046
- So do people.

248
00:13:56,498 --> 00:13:59,238
My personal detective, Matthew McHale,

249
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,489
has been transferred.

250
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:04,414
But I suppose you know nothing about that.

251
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:08,581
Each time I make a friend, each
time I get close to someone,

252
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:11,135
they get sent away.

253
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:17,067
I feel so isolated.

254
00:14:22,602 --> 00:14:24,921
(horse hooves clomping)

255
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:28,421
(upbeat orchestral music)

256
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:35,640
(clapping)

257
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,165
- Brilliant, ma'am.

258
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:38,961
Simply brilliant.

259
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,117
You've done in three
months what I was sure

260
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,434
would take you six.

261
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:45,644
You should be very proud
of yourself, ma'am.

262
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:49,959
(somber orchestral music)

263
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:52,725
(Diana laughing)

264
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,150
And I love it when he
says, "Nice to see you,

265
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,187
"to see you nice."

266
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:59,187
- (laughs) I love that program.

267
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:20,961
My husband and I...

268
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:27,372
(inhales) For five years,
I have tried everything

269
00:15:27,372 --> 00:15:30,485
I can think to make him happy.

270
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:34,652
But now I've begun to realize
that I am the problem.

271
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,254
In public it's all an act.

272
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:41,837
In private he never touches me.

273
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,337
(vehicles rumbling)
(horns honking)

274
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:07,853
- I'll be off to my own room in a moment.

275
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:11,326
I'll just leave these
here for you to sign.

276
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:12,743
- I miss my boys.

277
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:14,753
I've done my duty.

278
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:16,785
I want to go home to London.

279
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:18,596
- Be reasonable, Diana.

280
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:20,996
The Queen wants us at Balmoral.

281
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:22,524
Harry and William will be there

282
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,014
and this holiday has
been planned for weeks.

283
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:28,514
(somber orchestral music)

284
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:34,592
- I am telling you that
I am tired of performing.

285
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:37,359
And how can I relax around your family?

286
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:40,717
They are always judging
me and I never measure up.

287
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:42,884
- That's your imagination.

288
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,883
- Balmoral is boring.

289
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,528
It's rainy and it's freezing.

290
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:56,023
If I suggest to turn up the heat,

291
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:59,734
your mother tells me to
put on another wooly.

292
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:01,860
- Now you're attacking my mother.

293
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,699
- You don't know what it's
like for me to be there.

294
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,539
(dramatic orchestral music)

295
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:09,967
Why won't you listen to me?

296
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,467
- [Charles] Diana!

297
00:17:13,874 --> 00:17:16,457
- I'll lower my voice, Charles.

298
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:19,357
See?

299
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:23,860
Getting hold of myself.

300
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:29,775
(suspenseful orchestral music)

301
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:36,315
Will you listen to me now?

302
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:41,323
Will you take me seriously for one moment?

303
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:44,743
- Diana, are you hurt?

304
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:47,229
(nail file clatters)

305
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:51,100
(ominous orchestral music)

306
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,100
Let me help.

307
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,322
How do you feel?

308
00:17:56,193 --> 00:17:57,526
- Feel, Charles?

309
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,357
You don't know the meaning of the word.

310
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:06,524
- I do know that I can't
bear another of your stunts.

311
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:12,550
(ominous orchestral music)

312
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:26,014
- It gave everybody a wonderful new label.

313
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:29,056
Diana's unstable, mentally unbalanced.

314
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:33,223
The best way to destroy a
personality is to isolate it.

315
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,751
When you think no one's listening to you,

316
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:39,686
you have so much pain inside that you try

317
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:43,376
to hurt yourself on the
outside because you want help.

318
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:46,936
People see it as crying
wolf or attention seeking.

319
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:48,672
They think because you're
in the media all the time

320
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:51,446
you've got enough attention,
but I was actually

321
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:54,180
crying out because I wanted to get better

322
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,924
in order to continue my
duty and my role as wife,

323
00:18:57,924 --> 00:19:00,957
mother, and Princess of Wales.

324
00:19:00,957 --> 00:19:02,280
- [Interviewer] Did
your husband understand

325
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,092
what made you hurt yourself?

326
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:07,925
- I'm getting to be a bloody bore.

327
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:14,657
I'm afraid you'll turn me
out if I keep burdening you.

328
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:16,324
- Never, my darling.

329
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,506
(Charles sighs)

330
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,548
- (exhales) I have to
face it, I've failed.

331
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,631
I keep failing miserably.

332
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:40,771
I know how to speak French,
I known how to read Arabic,

333
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:44,398
I know how to fly a plane,

334
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:46,231
I know how to be king.

335
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,607
But nothing has prepared
me to deal with a...

336
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,690
drama queen like my wife.

337
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:57,939
Oh, damn it, Camilla.

338
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:02,466
You know I'm not the
beast I'm made out to be.

339
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:06,524
Can I help it if I love you and not her?

340
00:20:06,524 --> 00:20:09,024
- You are not Diana's problem.

341
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:15,414
(somber orchestral music)

342
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:06,959
(children giggling)

343
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:19,004
(ominous orchestral music)

344
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:30,074
(Diana vomiting)

345
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:46,161
- Oh, are you all right, ma'am?

346
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,311
- I'm quite all right, Allison.

347
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,439
But this shirt is not.

348
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:55,467
Do you expect me to wear this?

349
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:56,318
Look at it?

350
00:21:56,318 --> 00:21:57,151
It's rubbish.
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

351
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:58,333
I'm really very sorry indeed.

352
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,916
- I get no support.

353
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:06,825
Thank God I have to go to
London and give a speech.

354
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,929
Gets me out of this bloody mausoleum.

355
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:09,762
Do me up.

356
00:22:14,073 --> 00:22:15,562
Can't you understand?

357
00:22:15,562 --> 00:22:19,729
It's me the press will skewer
if everything isn't perfect!

358
00:22:20,728 --> 00:22:22,954
If I'm not as dowdy as
the rest of this family,

359
00:22:22,954 --> 00:22:24,135
I'd be crucified.

360
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:27,401
(dramatic orchestral music)

361
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:29,734
(dog barks)

362
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:33,572
(dog growling)

363
00:22:37,111 --> 00:22:39,440
(crowd chattering)

364
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,440
- So, did he invite you to Portugal?

365
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,281
The Prime Minister looks
like he's in love with you.

366
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,296
What did you say to him?

367
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:49,026
- Oh, I just flirted with
him to annoy Charles.

368
00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:51,924
- Why annoy someone you don't care about?

369
00:22:51,924 --> 00:22:54,036
I think maybe you're
trying to win him back.

370
00:22:54,036 --> 00:22:57,345
- That's quite a theory, Dr. Freud.

371
00:22:57,345 --> 00:22:58,178
- Oh dear.

372
00:22:58,178 --> 00:23:01,202
I think I just shot myself in the foot.

373
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:03,468
Tell me you'll still take riding lessons.

374
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:05,012
- You're very sweet, Jay.

375
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:06,598
- Which one of them is that?

376
00:23:06,598 --> 00:23:08,440
- Ask her if she's got a friend for me.

377
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,955
- (laughs) I knew he had a hot date.

378
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,472
- [Diana] James. James?

379
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:12,446
- I would not keep her waiting, Hewitt.

380
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:14,579
- Oh, if you have a
date, I won't keep you.

381
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:15,876
- Let me speak to her,
I'll straighten her out

382
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:18,738
about you. (laughs)
- Adam!

383
00:23:18,738 --> 00:23:19,651
Sorry.

384
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:22,309
That was just a couple of
idiotic friends of mine.

385
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:25,389
And, um, I don't have a date.

386
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:26,884
- Well, I do.

387
00:23:26,884 --> 00:23:29,464
With a long hot bath.

388
00:23:29,464 --> 00:23:32,631
So, goodbye, for the third time today.

389
00:23:34,687 --> 00:23:35,937
- Sweet dreams.

390
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:39,938
(dial tone chimes)

391
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,600
(exhales)

392
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,100
(upbeat orchestral music)

393
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:10,303
(knocking on wood)

394
00:24:10,303 --> 00:24:11,136
- Charles.

395
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:12,851
Charles.

396
00:24:14,877 --> 00:24:15,877
- Oh, Diana.

397
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:18,220
- [Diana] Can I speak to you?

398
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,553
- Hm, all right.

399
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,090
Listen to this.

400
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:30,043
"In a world where size
is equated with good,

401
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:33,295
"in a world where the
traditions of centuries

402
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:37,038
"are discarded without an iota of regret,

403
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:40,140
"in a world where the
modernity of architecture

404
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,114
"is the measure of its merit,

405
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:47,496
"in a world where technology
is specifically designed

406
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:51,579
"to destroy entire
populations is called defense,

407
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,003
"in such a world we may
have to ask ourselves

408
00:24:57,003 --> 00:25:00,521
"if the small scale of the human animal

409
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:03,104
"is being left out of account."

410
00:25:07,682 --> 00:25:09,182
What do you think?

411
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,350
- Brilliant.

412
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,143
Now, Charles, I want
you to hear something.

413
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:25,696
Since we're going to the
Middle East for your birthday

414
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:27,245
and you know how they are about women,

415
00:25:27,245 --> 00:25:31,696
I've been practicing
something to say to the amir.

416
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,279
So, how about this:

417
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:39,085
Assalamualaikum, Your Royal Highness.

418
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:41,716
Well?

419
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,594
- What do you think you've just said?

420
00:25:46,594 --> 00:25:49,494
- Hello, Your Royal Highness,
may peace be with you.

421
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:52,534
- Well, actually, in polite
company it would be, um,

422
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:55,482
I'd like to mate with your cow.

423
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:56,315
- What?

424
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:58,921
- Assala-moo-alaikim.

425
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,312
- Oh God.

426
00:26:05,692 --> 00:26:07,942
(laughing)

427
00:26:11,884 --> 00:26:12,717
- Charles.

428
00:26:13,912 --> 00:26:15,482
You bloody beast!

429
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:16,878
I hate you.

430
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:18,410
I hate you!

431
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,327
I hate you.

432
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:37,846
(telephone ringing)

433
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,727
(somber orchestral music)

434
00:26:54,327 --> 00:26:57,452
- [Camilla] Charles,
darling, are you there?

435
00:26:57,452 --> 00:26:58,875
Darling?

436
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:01,042
- Just one moment, please.

437
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:05,716
(ominous orchestral music)

438
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:10,957
(door creaks)

439
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:22,468
- Identification, sir?

440
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:25,051
Thank you.

441
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:26,551
There you go, sir.

442
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,613
(fire crackling)

443
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:46,176
- Usually I abstain, but this
being a special occasion.

444
00:27:47,922 --> 00:27:49,747
- What is the special occasion?

445
00:27:49,747 --> 00:27:52,755
And why did you invite me to dinner?

446
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,563
- I thought you looked like a man

447
00:27:54,563 --> 00:27:56,749
who'd have a good appetite.

448
00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:59,666
- (chuckles) Well.

449
00:28:02,621 --> 00:28:06,121
Tell me about your trip, you and the amir.

450
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:08,834
I was very jealous.

451
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:10,146
- But you wouldn't
believe what they put on

452
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,119
for Charles's birthday.

453
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,491
I mean, even the chocolates
were coated in real gold.

454
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:18,574
The money he has is beyond imagining.

455
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:21,319
- What about your mother-in-law?

456
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:23,414
- He spends his.

457
00:28:23,414 --> 00:28:27,143
My mother-in-law roams the
palace putting lights out.

458
00:28:27,143 --> 00:28:29,300
She orders them to turn over soiled sheets

459
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,556
to save on the laundry bill.

460
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:33,258
- I don't believe it.

461
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:35,457
- It's terribly amusing.

462
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:38,457
If you don't have to live with them.

463
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,585
But, I'm being terribly naughty.

464
00:28:44,298 --> 00:28:45,381
- Don't stop.

465
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:49,453
- Do you mean with you I don't have

466
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:51,620
to be on my best behavior?

467
00:28:52,987 --> 00:28:56,212
(dishes clattering)

468
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:58,105
If you'll just leave that there.

469
00:28:58,105 --> 00:29:02,272
Thank you, I won't be needing
you anymore this evening.

470
00:29:17,684 --> 00:29:20,017
- [James] Where is everyone?

471
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,264
- Fortunately I have you to protect me.

472
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:27,764
(somber orchestral music)

473
00:29:52,772 --> 00:29:54,522
- Are you quite sure?

474
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,447
- I've never been more sure of anything.

475
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:03,709
(romantic orchestral music)

476
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:05,791
It's all right.

477
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:06,958
Really, it is.

478
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,260
- It's treason.

479
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,730
(James chuckles)

480
00:30:25,854 --> 00:30:27,521
On the other hand...

481
00:30:30,106 --> 00:30:32,773
Some things are worth dying for.

482
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:57,311
(romantic orchestral music)

483
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:01,595
You know, a commoner isn't
supposed to touch royalty

484
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:05,512
(swallows) until he's invited.

485
00:31:28,977 --> 00:31:32,727
- I've never been with
anyone but my husband.

486
00:31:34,778 --> 00:31:38,861
- You're the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

487
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,070
And to William.

488
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,207
I want to look after
you and make you happy.

489
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:50,741
(dramatic orchestral music)

490
00:32:10,921 --> 00:32:12,719
- You're spoiling me.

491
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:16,372
- Well, you don't get
promoted to Major every day.

492
00:32:16,372 --> 00:32:18,768
- (chuckles) You're very sweet.

493
00:32:18,768 --> 00:32:21,268
And you have immaculate taste.

494
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:25,988
- Well, now that we've seen them on.

495
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,291
- Okay.

496
00:32:31,703 --> 00:32:33,169
♫ Doo doo doo

497
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,555
♫ Doo doo doo doo
(Diana giggling)

498
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:40,123
♫ Doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo doo

499
00:32:40,123 --> 00:32:41,601
♫ Doo doo doo doo doo
(Diana giggling)

500
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:42,871
♫ Doo doo doo doo doo

501
00:32:42,871 --> 00:32:44,902
♫ Doo doodle-loo-doo doo doo da

502
00:32:44,902 --> 00:32:46,851
♫ Doo doo doo doo
(Diana laughs)

503
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:49,100
♫ Doodle-loo, doodle-loo, doodle-loo, doo

504
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,361
♫ Ba doom, ba doom, ba doom, ba doom

505
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:56,100
♫ Boo-rum ba dabba da dabba da dabba da

506
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,410
(Diana and James laugh)

507
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:03,549
(dramatic orchestral music)

508
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:07,716
(horse hooves clomping)
(dramatic fanfare music)

509
00:33:09,843 --> 00:33:10,676
Come on!

510
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:24,080
- [Diana] What do you mean my
marriage is like my parents'?

511
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,247
- Well, from what you said,
there are similarities.

512
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,925
Your father was 12 years
older than your mother,

513
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:32,930
and Charles is--

514
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,446
- 13 years older than me.

515
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,752
- Your father liked to grow things,

516
00:33:36,752 --> 00:33:38,285
he was a gentleman farmer.

517
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:40,452
(chuckles) And we all know how besotted

518
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,828
Charles is with his bloody garden.

519
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:44,952
(Diana laughs)

520
00:33:44,952 --> 00:33:46,996
- Mummy prefers living in the city.

521
00:33:46,996 --> 00:33:48,025
- And so do you.

522
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:49,357
- Mm.

523
00:33:49,357 --> 00:33:52,512
My parents had a ghastly marriage

524
00:33:52,512 --> 00:33:55,648
and went through a hideous divorce.

525
00:33:55,648 --> 00:33:58,530
And then Mummy lost
custody of her children.

526
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,933
(somber orchestral music)

527
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:03,847
- Well, I don't mean that.

528
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:06,264
I didn't mean to depress you.

529
00:34:07,842 --> 00:34:11,785
- I remember watching Mummy
and Daddy from my hiding place.

530
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:13,195
If they weren't at each other's throats,

531
00:34:13,195 --> 00:34:17,864
there was a frozen silence
that lasted forever.

532
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:20,409
Daddy had affairs of his own,

533
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:22,250
but in the end it was
Mummy who was made out

534
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,417
to be this villain because she
deserted him for another man.

535
00:34:27,588 --> 00:34:31,755
Daddy had more money, more
power, so he won in court.

536
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:37,268
And when Mummy left, the sun went out.

537
00:34:38,799 --> 00:34:42,949
And I never want to inflict
that pain on William and Harry.

538
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:47,759
Divorce is the most awful thing
that can happen to a child.

539
00:34:47,759 --> 00:34:49,295
And I never want to inflict that sort

540
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,295
of pain on William and Harry, never.

541
00:34:56,126 --> 00:35:00,080
- See what happens when I try
and compete with your husband?

542
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,067
I should leave all that
psychological stuff

543
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,930
to him, shouldn't I?

544
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,429
I mean, he's the intellectual, I'm--

545
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:06,346
- Athletic.

546
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:11,917
Aren't you going to ask
me which one I prefer?

547
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:27,529
(chuckles) It's a terrible cliche,

548
00:35:27,529 --> 00:35:31,117
but you did just take my breath away.

549
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:34,450
(horse hooves clomping)

550
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:38,114
- Straighten up, Dibs.

551
00:35:38,114 --> 00:35:42,888
They're looking to see if
you've got straw in your hair.

552
00:35:42,888 --> 00:35:45,721
You find this exciting, don't you?

553
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:02,419
- Thank you, Major Hewitt.

554
00:36:02,419 --> 00:36:03,252
- Ma'am.

555
00:36:21,677 --> 00:36:22,776
- Who's coming tonight?

556
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:23,702
- The regulars.

557
00:36:23,702 --> 00:36:25,611
Look, I made a few adjustments.

558
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:27,250
I hope you don't mind.

559
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,332
- You do just as you please

560
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:31,082
and I'm sure that will please me.

561
00:36:32,635 --> 00:36:35,494
- Um, over there, please.

562
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:38,570
(Charles exhales loudly)

563
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,287
- Creating a garden is like painting

564
00:36:40,287 --> 00:36:42,120
with trees and plants.

565
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,991
Sometimes I even get an idea from a dream.

566
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:50,909
- That's one of the things
I love about you, darling.

567
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,463
- Precisely why you should escape with me.

568
00:36:52,463 --> 00:36:53,620
(Camilla laughs)

569
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,674
We'll buy an island.

570
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:56,200
- Yeah.

571
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,487
You may be romantic,
but you're not a fool.

572
00:36:58,487 --> 00:37:01,347
I hardly see you abdicating
for the woman you love.

573
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:04,569
- It's true, I want to wear the crown.

574
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:06,117
If Diana and I should separate,

575
00:37:06,117 --> 00:37:07,526
I may never have the chance.

576
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:09,029
- Nonsense.

577
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:10,779
It's your birthright.

578
00:37:12,214 --> 00:37:13,578
That ridiculous creature
isn't going to prevent

579
00:37:13,578 --> 00:37:16,149
a man of your qualities from taking

580
00:37:16,149 --> 00:37:18,732
your rightful place in history.

581
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:22,875
- You always know exactly what to say.

582
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:27,813
Oh, if only I'd been more
decisive 15 years ago

583
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:30,483
and asked you to marry me.

584
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:34,982
I wouldn't have to live
with this hideous regret.

585
00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:35,815
Every day.

586
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:39,218
- Darling.

587
00:37:40,322 --> 00:37:42,322
Would you mind terribly,

588
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:46,258
you're standing on my foot.

589
00:37:46,258 --> 00:37:47,091
- Oh!

590
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:47,924
I'm so--

591
00:37:47,924 --> 00:37:49,261
- Yee hee, gets you every time.

592
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:51,364
(Charles and Camilla shouting)

593
00:37:51,364 --> 00:37:52,915
- [Charles] Into the wheelbarrow!

594
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:56,636
(Charles and Camilla laughing)

595
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:58,349
(Camilla shouting)

596
00:37:58,349 --> 00:37:59,305
(upbeat orchestral music)

597
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:01,638
- [Camilla] Slow, slow down!

598
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:04,880
Right.

599
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,463
You are a dead man!

600
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:10,975
(dramatic orchestral music)

601
00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:24,053
- [Diana] I'm at Highgrove now.

602
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:25,673
It's just as I told you.

603
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:26,796
- Not again?

604
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:28,526
- It's bad enough that she's
playing hostess in my home

605
00:38:28,526 --> 00:38:31,964
and taken my husband,
but what I really resent

606
00:38:31,964 --> 00:38:35,204
is that she can't keep her
bloody hands off my furniture.

607
00:38:35,204 --> 00:38:37,923
(upbeat orchestral music)

608
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:41,100
Why can't you be like other husbands?

609
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,582
Damn you, Charles, you're a miser!

610
00:38:44,582 --> 00:38:47,999
- I will not be spoken to in that manner.

611
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:52,260
Diana, I demand an apology.

612
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,749
Come back here at once.

613
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,249
- Battle stations.

614
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:01,264
- You pour thousands into
your precious bloody garden.

615
00:39:01,264 --> 00:39:03,348
Why won't you do
something for me for once?

616
00:39:03,348 --> 00:39:04,181
- What's the matter with you?

617
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:06,690
Now for heaven's sake, calm
down and come back inside.

618
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,043
- The only thing I ever asked from you

619
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:09,546
at Highgrove was a tennis court.

620
00:39:09,546 --> 00:39:11,110
And that's precisely why you won't let me

621
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,943
have one, isn't it?

622
00:39:11,943 --> 00:39:13,638
- Don't be ridiculous!

623
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:15,475
- Or is it a bad investment
because you're not planning

624
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:17,364
on me being around much longer?

625
00:39:17,364 --> 00:39:19,730
- I'm the one who won't
be around much longer!

626
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:24,175
(dramatic orchestral music)

627
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:26,258
Bring my car immediately.

628
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:30,558
And tell my sons I'm leaving!

629
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:34,848
(door slams)

630
00:39:34,848 --> 00:39:37,923
- So then, Prince William
climbed on top of his tank

631
00:39:37,923 --> 00:39:40,004
and said, all right men, forward.

632
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:42,115
And all the tanks moved
off along the beach.

633
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:43,963
(mimics engines roaring)

634
00:39:43,963 --> 00:39:46,489
And just then, suddenly,
Prince Harry said, "Stop!"

635
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:48,105
and everyone stopped.

636
00:39:48,105 --> 00:39:49,175
He said, "Watch out.

637
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:52,113
"The beach might be booby
trapped with mines."

638
00:39:52,113 --> 00:39:55,155
And just then, from the
other side of a hill

639
00:39:55,155 --> 00:39:57,601
came this almighty kaboom!

640
00:39:57,601 --> 00:39:58,434
- Oh no!

641
00:39:59,294 --> 00:40:02,139
- All right, darlings, we'll
finish up tomorrow, I promise.

642
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:05,341
But if you're very, very
good and go to sleep--

643
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:07,002
- And clean your teeth.

644
00:40:07,002 --> 00:40:08,242
- [Diana] Perhaps Major Hewitt will come

645
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:09,380
with us to Thorpe Park tomorrow.

646
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,296
- Jolly good.

647
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:12,026
- Yes, yes, sir, do come.

648
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:14,633
- And I want to go back
to that army place.

649
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:16,345
I want to ride in the tank again.

650
00:40:16,345 --> 00:40:17,795
When can we?

651
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:18,628
- Well.

652
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,552
Any time you want, but you
have to ask your mother first.

653
00:40:22,552 --> 00:40:23,915
- All right, enough stalling.

654
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:25,027
Off to bed, you little rogues.

655
00:40:25,027 --> 00:40:25,860
- Come on.

656
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:28,560
Hey, up.

657
00:40:34,154 --> 00:40:36,506
- I'll just tuck them into
bed, it won't take long.

658
00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:39,839
Why don't you help yourself to a brandy.

659
00:40:43,594 --> 00:40:46,511
(door clicks open)

660
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:06,170
You mean so much to me I can't
keep any secrets from you.

661
00:41:07,223 --> 00:41:08,979
You make me feel like I don't need

662
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:12,085
to play the perfect princess and yet,

663
00:41:12,085 --> 00:41:15,002
by some miracle, you still love me.

664
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,438
Sit down.

665
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:23,438
I have something I want to tell you.

666
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,110
I have bulimia.

667
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:38,744
I gorge myself with all kinds
of food and then I purge.

668
00:41:39,736 --> 00:41:42,504
Just before my wedding
day I was so insecure

669
00:41:42,504 --> 00:41:47,324
and my nerves were shattered,
so I gave up my diet

670
00:41:47,324 --> 00:41:50,574
and I ate and ate and made myself sick.

671
00:41:52,606 --> 00:41:55,057
After that it was easy.

672
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:56,974
It became an addiction.

673
00:41:58,414 --> 00:42:03,116
You feel relieved for a while
and then the guilt hits in.

674
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:06,975
And then the pattern
starts all over again.

675
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,936
- Hey, it's all right, it's all right.

676
00:42:09,936 --> 00:42:12,436
- I know I'll never be normal.

677
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,827
- What about Charles, does he know?

678
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:18,749
- Yes.

679
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:21,785
I disgust him.

680
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:29,355
Charles said that my dieting
was jeopardizing my duty.

681
00:42:31,196 --> 00:42:34,584
(somber orchestral music)

682
00:42:34,584 --> 00:42:36,015
(crying) He doesn't mean to be heartless,

683
00:42:36,015 --> 00:42:38,265
he just doesn't understand.

684
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,729
- How can I help?

685
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:55,608
- (sighs) You already have.

686
00:42:56,581 --> 00:43:00,597
For the first time in my life I feel safe

687
00:43:00,597 --> 00:43:04,347
and attractive enough
not to want to be sick.

688
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:09,174
- Whenever the time, day or
night, if you're desperate,

689
00:43:09,174 --> 00:43:10,007
call me.

690
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,613
And I'll help you find a professional.

691
00:43:13,613 --> 00:43:17,780
There must be doctors who
specialize in this sort of thing.

692
00:43:18,951 --> 00:43:22,534
I promise we can get
through this together.

693
00:43:23,379 --> 00:43:26,175
- After a person purges, certain chemicals

694
00:43:26,175 --> 00:43:28,925
are released that produce a high.

695
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:33,382
It's addictive, so the bulimic is prone

696
00:43:33,382 --> 00:43:37,549
to the same depression and
mood swings as a drug addict.

697
00:43:39,296 --> 00:43:41,039
Has anyone else in your family suffered

698
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,622
from an eating disorder
or from depression?

699
00:43:45,462 --> 00:43:46,452
Believe me, everything
you say will be taken

700
00:43:46,452 --> 00:43:48,952
into the strictest confidence.

701
00:43:50,743 --> 00:43:53,410
- My sister, Sarah, was anorexic

702
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:58,258
and my mother's brother
was a manic depressive.

703
00:43:58,258 --> 00:44:00,008
He committed suicide.

704
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:06,654
- Diana, this condition is not your fault.

705
00:44:08,453 --> 00:44:11,418
Your illness is a manifestation
of something healthy

706
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:14,001
within you that has gone wrong.

707
00:44:15,996 --> 00:44:18,746
Our job is to find it and fix it.

708
00:44:20,934 --> 00:44:24,684
So, tell me about a time
when you were happy.

709
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,914
Perhaps your childhood?

710
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:32,083
- Are you sure you have to go?

711
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:35,500
I mean, Camilla's sister's 40th birthday.

712
00:44:38,149 --> 00:44:41,663
I can't think of anything more boring.

713
00:44:41,663 --> 00:44:43,830
- It's part of my therapy.

714
00:44:45,651 --> 00:44:50,620
The doctor says if I'm to
make a complete recovery,

715
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,203
I have to confront my feelings,

716
00:44:54,578 --> 00:44:57,078
so I'm keeping up appearances.

717
00:44:58,551 --> 00:45:01,549
Besides, it confuses a rottweiler

718
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:05,651
if you act like you're not afraid of it.

719
00:45:05,651 --> 00:45:08,205
(James chuckles)

720
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:12,372
(light orchestral music)
(crowd chattering)

721
00:45:57,511 --> 00:45:59,674
Don't you think it's a bit crowded,

722
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:03,174
the three of us in this marriage, Camilla?

723
00:46:06,999 --> 00:46:08,318
- I hate being out with other women,

724
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:10,100
but I've gotta keep up
this ridiculous appearance

725
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,537
of being a bon vivant bachelor
or people get suspicious.

726
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:16,072
Every time I walk into a
room and she's not there

727
00:46:16,072 --> 00:46:17,941
it feels empty.

728
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,400
- I'm afraid for you, dear.

729
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,779
You're with the wife of
the future king of England.

730
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:26,342
I could only imagine the
consequences to your career

731
00:46:26,342 --> 00:46:28,009
if it became public.

732
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,503
Is Diana concerned about
the risk you are taking?

733
00:46:33,503 --> 00:46:35,588
- It doesn't matter, Mother.

734
00:46:35,588 --> 00:46:36,712
I have to protect her.

735
00:46:36,712 --> 00:46:40,153
- Who is going to protect you,
if you don't mind my asking.

736
00:46:40,153 --> 00:46:42,524
- [James] That's what I lie
awake at night wondering.

737
00:46:42,524 --> 00:46:45,925
- Jay, you brought girls
home to meet me before,

738
00:46:45,925 --> 00:46:47,789
but it never occurred to
me that when you finally

739
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:51,956
gave one of them your heart,
she wouldn't be attainable.

740
00:46:53,254 --> 00:46:55,116
Self-interest dictates that I should have

741
00:46:55,116 --> 00:46:59,351
at least a few grandchildren
to help me with the horses.

742
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:03,518
(gate creaks)
(footsteps tapping)

743
00:47:05,399 --> 00:47:06,940
Which room should I put her in?

744
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,043
- Mine.

745
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:11,210
(doorknocker tapping)

746
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,910
- Your Royal Highness.

747
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:19,509
- Mrs. Hewitt, I've looked
forward to meeting you.

748
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:22,342
Jay has told me so much about you.

749
00:47:23,514 --> 00:47:25,347
How he adores his mum.

750
00:47:27,294 --> 00:47:28,794
- You were superb.

751
00:47:29,644 --> 00:47:32,350
Mother loves you, she told me.

752
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,517
- If only my in-laws treated
me as well as your mother does.

753
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:39,676
You make me feel so safe.

754
00:47:43,008 --> 00:47:46,675
(romantic orchestral music)

755
00:47:54,053 --> 00:47:57,553
(Diana and James moaning)

756
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:02,088
Oh, darling.

757
00:48:05,638 --> 00:48:06,471
Oh, James.

758
00:48:08,597 --> 00:48:11,716
(James and Diana moaning)

759
00:48:11,716 --> 00:48:14,465
(Diana laughing)

760
00:48:14,465 --> 00:48:16,532
- I thought this was
a protection stake out

761
00:48:16,532 --> 00:48:17,865
against the IRA.

762
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:23,126
I'm a surveillance officer, not a voyeur.

763
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:26,278
(James moaning)

764
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:30,309
I want to know who the hell ordered this.

765
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:33,809
(James and Diana moaning)

766
00:48:47,532 --> 00:48:51,199
(romantic orchestral music)

767
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:55,085
- You have no idea how good it feels

768
00:48:55,085 --> 00:48:57,418
to be able to trust someone.

769
00:48:58,416 --> 00:48:59,833
Especially a man.

770
00:49:01,366 --> 00:49:03,616
You are so good, so strong.

771
00:49:07,503 --> 00:49:09,323
You make me feel so secure in knowing

772
00:49:09,323 --> 00:49:11,823
that my life is in your hands.

773
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,416
The incident in Klosters
which almost claimed

774
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:33,640
my husband's life also changed mine

775
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,557
in a most profound way.

776
00:49:36,815 --> 00:49:40,482
(dramatic orchestral music)

777
00:49:48,382 --> 00:49:50,759
- At approximately 2:45 this afternoon

778
00:49:50,759 --> 00:49:52,492
the Prince of Wales and the royal party

779
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:55,148
are believed to have been
trapped by an avalanche

780
00:49:55,148 --> 00:49:57,136
while on a skiing holiday in the mountains

781
00:49:57,136 --> 00:49:59,316
near Klosters in Switzerland.

782
00:49:59,316 --> 00:50:00,744
No word is yet available on injuries

783
00:50:00,744 --> 00:50:03,997
or whether Princess Diana
was with her husband.

784
00:50:03,997 --> 00:50:05,535
- [Newscaster] Thank you, Ian.

785
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:07,150
We'll continue to update this story

786
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,337
as details become available.

787
00:50:09,337 --> 00:50:12,987
At the moment, communication
with the area is interrupted.

788
00:50:12,987 --> 00:50:13,962
- If anything's happened
to him, I don't know

789
00:50:13,962 --> 00:50:15,215
what I'm going to do.

790
00:50:15,215 --> 00:50:17,458
I don't know how I'm going to carry on.

791
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:20,371
(suspenseful orchestral music)

792
00:50:20,371 --> 00:50:21,543
Sorry.

793
00:50:21,543 --> 00:50:23,893
- Oh, Diana, it'll be all right.

794
00:50:23,893 --> 00:50:24,976
It has to be.

795
00:50:26,611 --> 00:50:28,931
What could be taking so bloody long?

796
00:50:28,931 --> 00:50:31,060
(dramatic orchestral music)

797
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,965
(telephone rings)

798
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:34,914
- Hello?

799
00:50:34,914 --> 00:50:35,876
Oh, Charles!

800
00:50:35,876 --> 00:50:36,709
Thank God!

801
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:39,802
How soon can you get here?

802
00:50:41,096 --> 00:50:42,537
- But the run was patrolled.

803
00:50:42,537 --> 00:50:44,190
It was open, wasn't it?

804
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:46,232
How could that be your fault?

805
00:50:46,232 --> 00:50:48,666
It's not a crime to be adventurous.

806
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:50,543
I mean, you're an expert skier.

807
00:50:50,543 --> 00:50:53,614
- I know, but our skiing there might have

808
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:55,888
triggered the avalanche.

809
00:50:55,888 --> 00:50:58,427
The others and I jumped
clear but Patty and Hugh

810
00:50:58,427 --> 00:51:01,537
were swept over a precipice.

811
00:51:01,537 --> 00:51:03,174
Hugh was killed instantly.

812
00:51:03,174 --> 00:51:04,007
- Oh God.

813
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:07,360
How ghastly for you, darling.

814
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,379
- (exhales heavily) I feel it's my fault.

815
00:51:11,379 --> 00:51:13,802
I feel utterly responsible.

816
00:51:13,802 --> 00:51:15,690
- Charles, I forbid you to blame yourself.

817
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:17,441
It was so clearly an accident.

818
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,928
It was not your fault.

819
00:51:19,928 --> 00:51:20,928
Oh, darling.

820
00:51:21,969 --> 00:51:24,623
I wish I could put my arms
around you this very minute.

821
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,538
- There's nothing I need more.

822
00:51:27,538 --> 00:51:30,241
- You have no idea how relieved I am.

823
00:51:30,241 --> 00:51:31,609
I mean even with divorce, there's a chance

824
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:33,729
of people getting back together.

825
00:51:33,729 --> 00:51:36,391
But, well, death is so final.

826
00:51:36,391 --> 00:51:39,703
And can you imagine not even
being able to say goodbye?

827
00:51:39,703 --> 00:51:41,501
Are you there?

828
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:42,334
- Yes.

829
00:51:43,588 --> 00:51:46,367
Well, I'm glad the prince
is safe and that you phoned.

830
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:48,673
It was very thoughtful.

831
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:49,995
- I've upset you.

832
00:51:49,995 --> 00:51:51,435
Have I said something wrong?

833
00:51:51,435 --> 00:51:53,427
- No, it was just a bit of a bother,

834
00:51:53,427 --> 00:51:54,786
wondering whether you were dead or not.

835
00:51:54,786 --> 00:51:56,869
It kind of ruined my day.

836
00:51:58,704 --> 00:52:00,454
- Oh, Jay, I'm sorry.

837
00:52:01,398 --> 00:52:03,549
I didn't mean to be so...

838
00:52:03,549 --> 00:52:04,536
Charles!

839
00:52:04,536 --> 00:52:05,918
I have to go.

840
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:10,085
(connection clicks)
(dial tone chimes)

841
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,005
I was afraid I'd lost you.

842
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,422
I was so terribly worried.

843
00:52:15,422 --> 00:52:19,175
I am sorry, it must be dreadful for you.

844
00:52:19,175 --> 00:52:20,761
- I have to make sure
the Queen's been informed

845
00:52:20,761 --> 00:52:25,069
then I'd like to be
alone if you don't mind.

846
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:28,442
(somber orchestral music)

847
00:52:28,442 --> 00:52:30,411
- I won't disturb you, I won't say a word.

848
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:32,011
Allow me to be with you, please.

849
00:52:32,011 --> 00:52:33,360
Permit me to help you.

850
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,162
Let me be your wife, your comfort.

851
00:52:36,162 --> 00:52:39,367
Charles, I need to be
close to you tonight.

852
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:40,617
Please, I must!

853
00:52:42,275 --> 00:52:45,095
- Diana, you have to understand,
I need time to reflect.

854
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:46,539
This isn't about you.

855
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,547
The death of my friend is a burden

856
00:52:48,547 --> 00:52:51,713
I will have to bear for
the rest of my life.

857
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:56,246
I am in no condition to
suffer your needs tonight.

858
00:52:56,246 --> 00:53:00,413
So, if you really want to
help me, leave me alone.

859
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,407
(dramatic orchestral music)

860
00:53:14,544 --> 00:53:18,545
- The tragedy in Klosters
was a turning point for me.

861
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:21,222
From then on I started to use my position

862
00:53:21,222 --> 00:53:23,022
as Princess of Wales to draw attention

863
00:53:23,022 --> 00:53:26,810
to more serious causes
like AIDS and I spent

864
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:28,550
a great deal of time
taking William and Harry

865
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,140
to homeless shelters and teaching them

866
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,557
about people dying of cancer.

867
00:53:34,399 --> 00:53:36,811
I want my boys to have an understanding

868
00:53:36,811 --> 00:53:41,102
of people's emotions,
people's insecurities,

869
00:53:41,102 --> 00:53:43,602
and people's hopes and dreams.

870
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:47,931
There were changes in my
personal life as well.

871
00:53:47,931 --> 00:53:49,630
I'm finished.

872
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:51,889
I'm not playing the game anymore.

873
00:53:51,889 --> 00:53:54,352
I know I'm going to catch
hell from the palace,

874
00:53:54,352 --> 00:53:57,005
but I refuse to keep up
this absurd fairytale

875
00:53:57,005 --> 00:53:59,330
in public when in private
my marriage is over.

876
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:01,163
- Diana, are you sure?

877
00:54:02,412 --> 00:54:05,683
- You know, actually, I feel
quite sorry for Charles.

878
00:54:05,683 --> 00:54:09,027
From the day he was born he
had not chance at happiness.

879
00:54:09,027 --> 00:54:09,937
Can you imagine anything worse

880
00:54:09,937 --> 00:54:11,567
than your mother being the Queen?

881
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:12,855
(James snorts)

882
00:54:12,855 --> 00:54:15,808
He was lucky if he spent
an hour a day with her.

883
00:54:15,808 --> 00:54:17,966
And his father is a bully.

884
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:22,094
Prince Phillip pounded the
sensitivity out of his son.

885
00:54:22,094 --> 00:54:24,589
Charles is so emotionally arrested

886
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:27,251
it's a wonder he can relate
to William and Harry at all.

887
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:29,104
- You don't have to worry
about Wills and Harry.

888
00:54:29,104 --> 00:54:30,073
They're wonderful.

889
00:54:30,073 --> 00:54:31,931
You brought them up to
be kind and generous

890
00:54:31,931 --> 00:54:33,544
and they're a pleasure to be with.

891
00:54:33,544 --> 00:54:35,173
- Oh God, you reminded me.

892
00:54:35,173 --> 00:54:39,263
William and Harry have
made something for you.

893
00:54:39,263 --> 00:54:41,482
They are absolutely potty about you.

894
00:54:41,482 --> 00:54:43,745
(James laughs)

895
00:54:43,745 --> 00:54:45,166
See?

896
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:46,535
It's a knight playing polo.

897
00:54:46,535 --> 00:54:47,734
- Of course it is.

898
00:54:47,734 --> 00:54:50,501
- It's clever, isn't it?

899
00:54:50,501 --> 00:54:53,001
They say it's you and I agree.

900
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,873
Our shining knight.

901
00:54:57,323 --> 00:54:59,573
Lord knows, you rescued me.

902
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,071
(woman laughing)

903
00:55:05,071 --> 00:55:07,038
- I think you actually wanna get caught.

904
00:55:07,038 --> 00:55:08,205
- No, I don't.

905
00:55:09,232 --> 00:55:13,195
But I am convinced MI-5
are constantly spying.

906
00:55:13,195 --> 00:55:17,030
Storing things up against
potential enemies of the crown.

907
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:19,416
Lord knows what they have in my dossier.

908
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,853
- Are you a potential enemy, then?

909
00:55:21,853 --> 00:55:24,853
- I suppose I am if I leave Charles.

910
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:29,702
(light orchestral music)

911
00:55:36,636 --> 00:55:38,587
- [James] Leave Charles?

912
00:55:38,587 --> 00:55:40,723
You're really thinking of leaving Charles?

913
00:55:40,723 --> 00:55:43,972
- Haven't you been listening
to me these past weeks?

914
00:55:43,972 --> 00:55:45,722
I intend to be happy.

915
00:55:46,901 --> 00:55:51,502
I want to be able to spend
every night in your arms

916
00:55:51,502 --> 00:55:54,432
and to have your children.

917
00:55:54,432 --> 00:55:58,121
And I want to watch you
decorate our Christmas tree

918
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,489
in front of the fire.

919
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,326
And at midnight on New Year's Eve,

920
00:56:02,326 --> 00:56:04,576
it's you I want kissing me.

921
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:10,005
- Dibs, has anyone ever told
you you're a hopeless romantic?

922
00:56:10,005 --> 00:56:12,088
- The hopeless part, yes.

923
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:14,592
- You've really figured
all this out, haven't you?

924
00:56:14,592 --> 00:56:16,671
- I'm yours for life.

925
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:19,322
- And when did you come to that decision?

926
00:56:19,322 --> 00:56:21,938
- Right after I first saw you.

927
00:56:21,938 --> 00:56:23,188
Out of uniform.

928
00:56:30,498 --> 00:56:32,579
Don't you know that when
you save someone's life,

929
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:36,162
you're responsible for the person forever?

930
00:56:36,162 --> 00:56:39,745
(ominous orchestral music)

931
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:54,244
That's very good.

932
00:56:57,463 --> 00:56:59,655
- When is Papa coming home?

933
00:56:59,655 --> 00:57:02,508
- Darling, you know he's
on holiday in Italy.

934
00:57:02,508 --> 00:57:05,904
He'll be home soon and he
loves you very, very much.

935
00:57:05,904 --> 00:57:07,771
- Then why is he always gone?

936
00:57:07,771 --> 00:57:10,521
- I want him to take us with him.

937
00:57:13,824 --> 00:57:16,657
- "Heir To The Throne, Errant Dad.

938
00:57:17,844 --> 00:57:19,719
"He is beginning to treat his sons

939
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:22,480
"like well-fed pets who know their place

940
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,935
"in the world of their
utterly self-involved parent.

941
00:57:26,935 --> 00:57:28,468
"Certainly it must hurt William and Harry

942
00:57:28,468 --> 00:57:30,668
"to see their father more often on TV

943
00:57:30,668 --> 00:57:32,335
"than in the flesh."

944
00:57:35,482 --> 00:57:38,549
Are you neglecting my grandchildren?

945
00:57:38,549 --> 00:57:39,690
This goes on to say that you and Diana

946
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:42,940
have been apart 38 days of the last 45.

947
00:57:46,521 --> 00:57:47,604
Is that true?

948
00:57:49,287 --> 00:57:52,908
- Well, I'm not quite
certain of the exact figures.

949
00:57:52,908 --> 00:57:56,086
- How many times must I tell you children

950
00:57:56,086 --> 00:57:58,734
the monarchy is expected to be

951
00:57:58,734 --> 00:58:03,352
the embodiment of family,
stability, responsible parent.

952
00:58:03,352 --> 00:58:05,852
- Mother, you know I've tried.

953
00:58:09,538 --> 00:58:10,788
- Diana, Sarah.

954
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,784
You're taking two girls from broken homes

955
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:17,855
and look how they repay you.

956
00:58:17,855 --> 00:58:19,855
And my mother blames me.

957
00:58:20,752 --> 00:58:22,650
"Why can't your son make Diana realize

958
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:25,786
"she can not be allowed to
put her private happiness

959
00:58:25,786 --> 00:58:27,795
"before her public duty?"

960
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,995
- You've seen how she behaves.

961
00:58:29,995 --> 00:58:32,412
Deranged rantings, she's mad.

962
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:37,043
- Quite obviously we
made the wrong choice.

963
00:58:37,043 --> 00:58:39,363
Who would've foreseen it?

964
00:58:39,363 --> 00:58:41,354
Diana's never been able to grasp the fact

965
00:58:41,354 --> 00:58:43,459
that aristocratic girls are supposed

966
00:58:43,459 --> 00:58:46,209
to fall in love and fall in line.

967
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:49,384
So, Charles, I hold you responsible.

968
00:58:49,384 --> 00:58:51,224
Diana must be kept in check.

969
00:58:51,224 --> 00:58:54,457
Who knows what that flighty girl will do.

970
00:58:54,457 --> 00:58:55,653
Get your wife in hand.

971
00:58:55,653 --> 00:58:58,040
- With all due respect, how do you propose

972
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,290
that I do that?

973
00:59:01,279 --> 00:59:05,446
- Well, we'll have to make
some sort of arrangement.

974
00:59:06,288 --> 00:59:10,073
I don't expect you to give
up Mrs. Parker Bowles.

975
00:59:10,073 --> 00:59:13,073
You see now, I'm extremely
fond of her myself.

976
00:59:13,073 --> 00:59:14,476
I just don't want to see anymore reports

977
00:59:14,476 --> 00:59:17,377
about you neglecting your children.

978
00:59:17,377 --> 00:59:20,645
William will be heir to the throne.

979
00:59:20,645 --> 00:59:22,778
Do you think it wise to leave his training

980
00:59:22,778 --> 00:59:25,633
in the hands of some
silly kindergarten teacher

981
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:27,252
who can't even get through a dinner party

982
00:59:27,252 --> 00:59:29,572
without going to pieces?

983
00:59:29,572 --> 00:59:31,649
- (exhales) You're quite right.

984
00:59:31,649 --> 00:59:33,496
- Embrace the 20th century, Charles.

985
00:59:33,496 --> 00:59:34,661
Fight back.

986
00:59:34,661 --> 00:59:36,740
Use the press to your advantage.

987
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,677
(upbeat orchestral music)

988
00:59:38,677 --> 00:59:41,995
- Mother, what would you
say if I were to tell you

989
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,542
that I didn't think it too likely

990
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:46,043
that I could carry on with this marriage?

991
00:59:46,043 --> 00:59:48,380
- I'd say pull up your socks, Charles.

992
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,992
Divorce is out of the question.

993
00:59:50,992 --> 00:59:52,573
You wouldn't be able to
take the religious vows

994
00:59:52,573 --> 00:59:54,265
at your coronation.

995
00:59:54,265 --> 00:59:57,443
It would preclude your
ascending the throne.

996
00:59:57,443 --> 00:59:58,981
- So, am I to remain shackled to her

997
00:59:58,981 --> 01:00:01,339
for the rest of my life?

998
01:00:01,339 --> 01:00:03,006
- Of course you are.

999
01:00:06,824 --> 01:00:07,657
- Yes.

1000
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,551
I'm watching a spontaneous
photo opportunity.

1001
01:00:12,551 --> 01:00:13,384
Oh, Jay.

1002
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:16,587
When I think about what
this does to Wills and Harry

1003
01:00:16,587 --> 01:00:17,912
and I get so...

1004
01:00:17,912 --> 01:00:20,076
(Charles and children chattering)

1005
01:00:20,076 --> 01:00:22,173
It's a bit like a yoyo, isn't it?

1006
01:00:22,173 --> 01:00:24,328
They don't see their
father for weeks on end,

1007
01:00:24,328 --> 01:00:27,546
and when he shows up he smothers them.

1008
01:00:27,546 --> 01:00:28,379
Anyway.

1009
01:00:30,604 --> 01:00:34,021
So, Winky, what do you have on right now?

1010
01:00:35,356 --> 01:00:37,529
The silk ones that I bought you?

1011
01:00:37,529 --> 01:00:39,390
Mm, how nice.

1012
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:42,084
And did you wear them to bed last night?

1013
01:00:42,084 --> 01:00:44,156
(laughs)

1014
01:00:44,156 --> 01:00:44,989
Mm.

1015
01:00:54,714 --> 01:00:55,547
- Ooh, um!

1016
01:00:56,647 --> 01:00:58,176
Diana and I will be dining with William

1017
01:00:58,176 --> 01:00:59,825
in the sitting room this evening.

1018
01:00:59,825 --> 01:01:01,294
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir, but the princess

1019
01:01:01,294 --> 01:01:03,109
took the children
upstairs for an early bath

1020
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:04,924
about an hour ago and left instructions

1021
01:01:04,924 --> 01:01:06,275
for a tray to be sent up.

1022
01:01:06,275 --> 01:01:09,433
They've already eaten, I'm afraid.

1023
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:10,433
- Oh, I see.

1024
01:01:11,314 --> 01:01:13,228
Um, oh, very well, then.

1025
01:01:13,228 --> 01:01:14,609
Well, will you tell the boys

1026
01:01:14,609 --> 01:01:15,830
I'll be up to say goodnight in a moment?

1027
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:16,747
- Yes, sir.

1028
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:28,270
(somber orchestral music)

1029
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,807
- If only I hadn't been under the illusion

1030
01:01:34,807 --> 01:01:36,713
this was a marriage, I
wouldn't be so resentful

1031
01:01:36,713 --> 01:01:38,439
that I ended up in the throne room

1032
01:01:38,439 --> 01:01:41,939
and the bloody rottweiler got the bedroom.

1033
01:01:43,197 --> 01:01:44,030
Anyway.

1034
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:51,052
The good news is that I
spoke to my astrologer today

1035
01:01:51,052 --> 01:01:55,248
and she said that even
though I am a P.O.W.,

1036
01:01:55,248 --> 01:01:57,565
prisoner of Wales now, that one day

1037
01:01:57,565 --> 01:02:01,163
I will be allowed out
instead of divorcing,

1038
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:02,830
whatever that means.

1039
01:02:04,317 --> 01:02:07,471
But when it happens, I have big plans

1040
01:02:07,471 --> 01:02:09,721
for you, Winky, my darling.

1041
01:02:12,245 --> 01:02:14,162
- I do love you, Diana,

1042
01:02:15,323 --> 01:02:19,356
but you're the most publicly
married woman in the world.

1043
01:02:19,356 --> 01:02:21,764
I mean, if you were to
divorce Charles and marry me,

1044
01:02:21,764 --> 01:02:23,989
you'd never get Wills
and Harry away from them.

1045
01:02:23,989 --> 01:02:25,047
I could never be their father

1046
01:02:25,047 --> 01:02:27,123
and how would you cope
on a Major's salary?

1047
01:02:27,123 --> 01:02:30,374
You spend more on shoes
than I earn in a year.

1048
01:02:30,374 --> 01:02:34,624
- Oh dear, I hear a
bugle sounding retreat.

1049
01:02:34,624 --> 01:02:37,110
- No, no, I'm not sounding a retreat,

1050
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:40,360
I'm just trying to look at the reality.

1051
01:02:41,729 --> 01:02:45,329
(sighs) Why are we even bothering
to have this discussion?

1052
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:49,704
I mean, the Queen's never
going to sanction a divorce.

1053
01:02:49,704 --> 01:02:52,832
So, unless you intend
keeping me in the cupboard.

1054
01:02:52,832 --> 01:02:55,056
- Details, darling.

1055
01:02:55,056 --> 01:02:57,556
Just tell me that you love me.

1056
01:03:00,729 --> 01:03:03,312
- Of course I love you, always.

1057
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,237
- So, do you have any
plans this afternoon?

1058
01:03:09,237 --> 01:03:10,654
- I'm on duty in half an hour.

1059
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:11,498
- This weekend, then.

1060
01:03:11,498 --> 01:03:12,662
- Of course.

1061
01:03:12,662 --> 01:03:13,558
- Run away, then?

1062
01:03:13,558 --> 01:03:14,660
- No, no, I didn't mean that.

1063
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,892
- You said you were on duty.

1064
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:18,176
- Oh. (chuckles)

1065
01:03:18,176 --> 01:03:19,093
Yes, right.

1066
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:22,249
I am.

1067
01:03:26,467 --> 01:03:28,967
I look forward to the weekend.

1068
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:36,851
(dramatic orchestral music)

1069
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,221
Diana, please.

1070
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:01,766
- You usually like it when I do that.

1071
01:04:01,766 --> 01:04:03,667
Why are you doing this to me?

1072
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:05,179
- We made love all last night, didn't we?

1073
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:07,823
- Oh, so you've had your fill?

1074
01:04:07,823 --> 01:04:10,851
- I'm just tired, that's all.

1075
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:12,516
- Well, I know when I'm not wanted.

1076
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:14,056
- Oh, don't be absurd, Diana.

1077
01:04:14,056 --> 01:04:14,958
- Don't be absurd, Di.

1078
01:04:14,958 --> 01:04:16,289
Do you know who you sound like?

1079
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:17,385
- No.
- Charles!

1080
01:04:17,385 --> 01:04:20,135
(water splashes)

1081
01:04:34,888 --> 01:04:36,430
- Well done, trooper.

1082
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:38,680
- [Trooper] Thank you, sir.

1083
01:04:41,122 --> 01:04:42,455
- [Soldier] Sir.

1084
01:04:55,086 --> 01:04:56,639
- How did you get in here?

1085
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:59,056
- Don't worry, nobody saw me.

1086
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:01,268
- Don't you think you're
running a bit of a risk?

1087
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:02,101
- Yes.

1088
01:05:03,394 --> 01:05:05,883
But I behaved abominably

1089
01:05:05,883 --> 01:05:08,778
and I wanted to make it up to you.

1090
01:05:08,778 --> 01:05:11,278
(James sighs)

1091
01:05:14,298 --> 01:05:17,695
- That's terribly sweet of you, but...

1092
01:05:17,695 --> 01:05:20,112
I really think you should go.

1093
01:05:23,928 --> 01:05:25,015
- What is it?

1094
01:05:25,015 --> 01:05:26,838
What have I done now?

1095
01:05:26,838 --> 01:05:28,096
- Nothing.

1096
01:05:28,096 --> 01:05:29,513
What do you mean?

1097
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:33,929
- You've got something
to tell me, haven't you?

1098
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:34,762
- Yes.

1099
01:05:36,154 --> 01:05:37,356
- It's over.

1100
01:05:37,356 --> 01:05:39,485
You've given me the boot.

1101
01:05:39,485 --> 01:05:40,485
- No. Never.

1102
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,896
- [Diana] Then what is it?

1103
01:05:50,297 --> 01:05:53,636
- I'm being transferred to Germany.

1104
01:05:53,636 --> 01:05:55,041
- Why?

1105
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:57,277
- I'm in the army.

1106
01:05:57,277 --> 01:05:59,136
- Did you ask for it to get away from me?

1107
01:05:59,136 --> 01:06:00,865
- No, God no!

1108
01:06:00,865 --> 01:06:01,828
Why would I do that?

1109
01:06:01,828 --> 01:06:03,642
- "Oh, I'm just tired, that's all."

1110
01:06:03,642 --> 01:06:06,379
- I didn't ask for the
transfer, it just happened.

1111
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,962
- And where does that leave me?

1112
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:14,603
Tell them you won't go.

1113
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:17,686
- I have no choice, these are orders.

1114
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:20,019
- For how long.

1115
01:06:21,472 --> 01:06:22,472
- Two years.

1116
01:06:24,131 --> 01:06:27,631
(somber orchestral music)

1117
01:06:31,168 --> 01:06:33,560
Truth is, it's a marvelous assignment.

1118
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:37,043
They're giving me my own
command, a tank squadron.

1119
01:06:37,043 --> 01:06:38,869
I'd have killed for it any other time.

1120
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:41,173
It's automatic promotion.

1121
01:06:41,173 --> 01:06:42,256
I have to go.

1122
01:06:43,854 --> 01:06:46,178
And as far as my career's
concerned, I want to go.

1123
01:06:46,178 --> 01:06:49,761
My only regret, and
it's a big one, is you.

1124
01:06:50,788 --> 01:06:54,436
- I trusted you with my
heart, with everything.

1125
01:06:54,436 --> 01:06:57,852
- Diana, surely you realize
better than anyone it's my duty.

1126
01:06:57,852 --> 01:06:59,465
My only other choice is
to resign my commission

1127
01:06:59,465 --> 01:07:01,873
and then what would I be?

1128
01:07:01,873 --> 01:07:04,123
This is my career, my life.

1129
01:07:05,211 --> 01:07:08,711
- James, you were my safe place, my haven.

1130
01:07:10,722 --> 01:07:12,219
And now I'm going to be on my own again.

1131
01:07:12,219 --> 01:07:14,779
I don't know what to do.

1132
01:07:14,779 --> 01:07:16,446
I'll fall to pieces.

1133
01:07:20,449 --> 01:07:24,708
I know it sounds selfish,
but I love you so much.

1134
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:28,880
This is the worst news
I have ever received.

1135
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,463
I know I won't be able to cope.

1136
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:38,946
(somber orchestral music)

1137
01:07:38,946 --> 01:07:39,944
- Diana, my darling girl, you were

1138
01:07:39,944 --> 01:07:41,230
the one great love of my life.

1139
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,897
I adore you.

1140
01:07:42,897 --> 01:07:44,651
You mean everything to me.

1141
01:07:44,651 --> 01:07:48,734
I want to grow old with
you and die in your arms.

1142
01:07:56,479 --> 01:07:59,909
- (laughing) Oh, Camilla.

1143
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,159
(laughing)

1144
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:05,254
I fill up your tank?

1145
01:08:05,254 --> 01:08:08,587
- Yes, you do. (laughs)

1146
01:08:10,021 --> 01:08:14,061
- The trouble is I need
you several times a week.

1147
01:08:14,061 --> 01:08:16,327
- I need you all the time.

1148
01:08:16,327 --> 01:08:17,160
- Oh, God.

1149
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:20,920
Well, I'll just live inside
your trousers or something.

1150
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,317
(Camilla laughs)

1151
01:08:22,317 --> 01:08:24,028
It would be so much easier.

1152
01:08:24,028 --> 01:08:25,211
- (laughing) What are you gonna do?

1153
01:08:25,211 --> 01:08:26,706
Turn yourself into a pair of knickers?

1154
01:08:26,706 --> 01:08:29,456
(Charles laughs)

1155
01:08:32,225 --> 01:08:35,892
(dramatic orchestral music)

1156
01:08:42,315 --> 01:08:43,982
- [Charles] Oh, God.

1157
01:08:44,891 --> 01:08:47,173
Well, I'll just live inside
your trousers or something.

1158
01:08:47,173 --> 01:08:48,416
(Charles and Camilla laugh)

1159
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,368
It would be so much easier.

1160
01:08:50,368 --> 01:08:51,682
- [Camilla] (laughing)
What are you gonna do?

1161
01:08:51,682 --> 01:08:53,153
Turn yourself into a pair of knickers?

1162
01:08:53,153 --> 01:08:56,820
(Charles and Camilla laugh)

1163
01:08:57,803 --> 01:08:59,428
- [Charles] I'm so proud of you.

1164
01:08:59,428 --> 01:09:00,484
- [Camilla] Oh, don't be so silly,

1165
01:09:00,484 --> 01:09:01,786
I've never achieved anything.

1166
01:09:01,786 --> 01:09:03,149
- [Charles] Yes you have.

1167
01:09:03,149 --> 01:09:06,528
Your greatest achievement is loving me.

1168
01:09:06,528 --> 01:09:08,356
- [Camilla] Oh, darling.
(dramatic orchestral music)

1169
01:09:08,356 --> 01:09:11,178
Easier than falling off a chair.

1170
01:09:11,178 --> 01:09:13,177
- You sounded positively dreadful, Di.

1171
01:09:13,177 --> 01:09:14,159
What's up?

1172
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:17,570
- I think I may have what I
need to force a separation.

1173
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,627
If I only have the courage to use it.

1174
01:09:19,627 --> 01:09:21,154
- Oh, I'm not even going to ask what.

1175
01:09:21,154 --> 01:09:21,987
- Don't.

1176
01:09:23,197 --> 01:09:26,228
I feel like my life's caught
up in some spy thriller.

1177
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:28,728
Just call me Bond, James Bond.

1178
01:09:29,652 --> 01:09:31,902
(laughing)

1179
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:36,096
(phone ringing)

1180
01:09:36,096 --> 01:09:37,400
- [Operator] Operator.

1181
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,257
- I'd like to place a
call to Germany, please.

1182
01:09:39,257 --> 01:09:40,152
- [Operator] Number, please?

1183
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:41,735
- 0109 645 193 479.

1184
01:09:45,218 --> 01:09:46,554
- [Operator] I'll connect you.

1185
01:09:46,554 --> 01:09:47,981
(phone ringing)

1186
01:09:47,981 --> 01:09:49,097
- [Man] HQ Frankfurt.

1187
01:09:49,097 --> 01:09:52,548
- Hello, I'd like to speak to
Major James Hewitt, please.

1188
01:09:52,548 --> 01:09:55,215
(phone ringing)

1189
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:00,053
(James grunts)

1190
01:10:02,918 --> 01:10:04,198
- Major Hewitt.

1191
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:05,758
- [Diana] Winky!

1192
01:10:05,758 --> 01:10:06,758
I found you.

1193
01:10:07,935 --> 01:10:09,586
- Dibs.

1194
01:10:09,586 --> 01:10:11,220
I don't believe it.

1195
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,166
- I can't talk long, I'm at a pay phone.

1196
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:14,008
- A pay phone?

1197
01:10:14,008 --> 01:10:14,861
Why on earth are you there?

1198
01:10:14,861 --> 01:10:16,224
- Let's just say I have good cause

1199
01:10:16,224 --> 01:10:19,474
to believe my phone may be bugged.

1200
01:10:19,474 --> 01:10:22,317
I miss you, more than ever.

1201
01:10:22,317 --> 01:10:23,150
Come home?

1202
01:10:24,251 --> 01:10:26,418
Please come back to me.

1203
01:10:26,418 --> 01:10:27,251
- Hang on, Dibs.

1204
01:10:27,251 --> 01:10:29,393
I'll be back for Christmas.

1205
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:30,777
- Tell me you love me.

1206
01:10:30,777 --> 01:10:32,962
- Christmas, Dibs.

1207
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:33,795
Christmas.

1208
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,602
♫ If you're a small town banker

1209
01:10:37,602 --> 01:10:40,179
♫ Tryin' to keep a friend afloat

01:10:40,179 --> 01:10:43,996

01:10:43,996 --> 01:10:45,482
♫ Singin' what another man wrote

♫ We are down to one world

1214
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,701
♫ We're standin' in the same bread line

1215
01:10:53,701 --> 01:10:57,778

01:10:57,778 --> 01:11:00,440

1221
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:21,233

1222
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,945
(James laughs)

1223
01:11:28,853 --> 01:11:32,319
- (sighs) I'm never letting
you out of my sight again.

1224
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:36,169
(James breathing heavily)

1225
01:11:36,169 --> 01:11:40,423
- I've got to tell you, I
managed to get away on leave.

1226
01:11:40,423 --> 01:11:42,127
- You told them the Princess of Wales

1227
01:11:42,127 --> 01:11:46,294
would perish if you didn't
attend to her immediately.

1228
01:11:50,361 --> 01:11:51,918
- My squadron is one of the tank units

1229
01:11:51,918 --> 01:11:55,001
that's been alerted for Desert Storm.

1230
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:56,750
- What?

1231
01:11:57,724 --> 01:12:01,307
(ominous orchestral music)

1232
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:03,923
- [James] I've got a few
days off for Christmas

1233
01:12:03,923 --> 01:12:06,687
and then it's off to the Persian Gulf.

1234
01:12:06,687 --> 01:12:07,520
- No!

1235
01:12:10,101 --> 01:12:11,965
I won't let you!

1236
01:12:11,965 --> 01:12:15,632
(dramatic orchestral music)

1237
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:20,531
(soft orchestral music)

1238
01:12:23,136 --> 01:12:24,553
I'm sorry, Winky.

1239
01:12:26,896 --> 01:12:28,225
- For what?

1240
01:12:28,225 --> 01:12:30,475
- For the way I carried on.

1241
01:12:46,337 --> 01:12:48,269
I just can't bear the
thought of being separated

1242
01:12:48,269 --> 01:12:49,519
from you again.

1243
01:12:51,949 --> 01:12:54,949
But I know you have to do your duty.

1244
01:12:58,757 --> 01:13:01,924
- (sighs) I love you.

1245
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:09,449
- Being with you is the
most normal relationship

1246
01:13:09,449 --> 01:13:10,616
I've ever had.

1247
01:13:12,797 --> 01:13:16,964
Because you love me, I'm
able to be so much stronger.

1248
01:13:17,848 --> 01:13:19,598
Even if we are apart.

1249
01:13:22,217 --> 01:13:24,967
And I do so want to be a partner.

1250
01:13:28,067 --> 01:13:29,484
And not a burden.

1251
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:33,270
And I'm terribly proud of you.

1252
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:39,226
And even if we are separated by miles,

1253
01:13:39,226 --> 01:13:42,726
we'll be together in our hearts, won't we?

1254
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:49,135
(soft orchestral music)

1255
01:13:49,135 --> 01:13:52,383
I watch the tele day and night,

1256
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,861
hoping to catch a glimpse of you.

1257
01:13:54,861 --> 01:13:57,194
They're calling me the KPWC,

1258
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:01,764
the Kensington Palace War Correspondent.

1259
01:14:01,764 --> 01:14:05,038
Everyone's quite amazed I
know so much about tanks,

1260
01:14:05,038 --> 01:14:09,328
but why that is we'll
keep our little secret.

1261
01:14:09,328 --> 01:14:12,628
P.S. If the address on
these packages looks odd,

1262
01:14:12,628 --> 01:14:15,205
it's because I'm having my staff mail them

1263
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:17,622
from their private addresses.

1264
01:14:19,219 --> 01:14:21,636
Jay, I pray for you every day

1265
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:27,090
and the boys ask about you constantly.

1266
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:29,522
I remain extremely hopeful that you and I

1267
01:14:29,522 --> 01:14:33,689
will have a very happy life
together in the near future.

1268
01:14:35,598 --> 01:14:40,012
Because of you, darling,
I know what ever army wife

1269
01:14:40,012 --> 01:14:42,679
and girlfriend is going through.

1270
01:14:44,999 --> 01:14:48,062
I want to be of service,
so today I told Charles

1271
01:14:48,062 --> 01:14:49,760
I thought it was my
duty to go to the Gulf,

1272
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,136
boost morale, that sort of thing.

1273
01:14:53,136 --> 01:14:54,791
Naturally, Charles was worried

1274
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:56,701
that I would steal his thunder

1275
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,934
and instantly decided that he would go.

1276
01:14:58,934 --> 01:15:00,138
I asked him who he thought the men

1277
01:15:00,138 --> 01:15:02,051
would rather look at and
that made him even angrier.

1278
01:15:02,051 --> 01:15:03,239
(Charles and Diana shouting)

1279
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:05,310
We ended up in a blazing row.

1280
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:08,641
- [Charles] For the good of the country!

1281
01:15:08,641 --> 01:15:10,362
- [Diana] It's so unfair.

1282
01:15:10,362 --> 01:15:13,661
The palace thinks I'm
more popular than he is,

1283
01:15:13,661 --> 01:15:16,228
so they close ranks to protect him.

1284
01:15:16,228 --> 01:15:19,810
I wonder where I'll be when
the drawbridge comes up.

1285
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:21,310
All my love, Dibs.

1286
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:25,514
- [Adam] You'd better have a look at this.

1287
01:15:25,514 --> 01:15:27,310
- [James] Look at what?

1288
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:29,897
- "Major James Hewitt's jealous girlfriend

1289
01:15:29,897 --> 01:15:31,488
"tells us she's not the only blonde

1290
01:15:31,488 --> 01:15:33,640
"writing letters and
sending the handsome Major

1291
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,307
"gifts in the Gulf."

1292
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:38,626
- "He's also receiving
from his close friend,

1293
01:15:38,626 --> 01:15:40,588
"the Princess of Wales."

1294
01:15:40,588 --> 01:15:42,931
- [Adam] (chuckles) Nice going, Hewitt.

1295
01:15:42,931 --> 01:15:46,598
(dramatic orchestral music)

1296
01:15:49,422 --> 01:15:52,571
- Good Lord, Diana, the implication.

1297
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:53,974
- Damn the implication.

1298
01:15:53,974 --> 01:15:55,307
What girlfriend?

1299
01:15:59,186 --> 01:16:03,147
The story failed to spark
a scandal, thank God.

1300
01:16:03,147 --> 01:16:06,763
Perhaps everyone assumes
we are just close friends.

1301
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:07,596
I hope so.

1302
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:12,802
Anyway, James, we can't
let this come between us.

1303
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:18,042
Unless, of course, your
other girlfriend already has.

1304
01:16:18,042 --> 01:16:20,884
(laughs) All right, James, all right.

1305
01:16:20,884 --> 01:16:23,619
I believe you, ex-girlfriend.

1306
01:16:23,619 --> 01:16:25,119
I believe you, I do.

1307
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:27,952
(soft rock music)

1308
01:16:29,525 --> 01:16:32,701
Darling, I can't wait
for you to come home.

1309
01:16:32,701 --> 01:16:36,816
I'm playing our favorite
song and thinking of you.

1310
01:16:36,816 --> 01:16:37,649
- Diana.

1311
01:16:38,608 --> 01:16:41,695
You know I have no urge to
interfere in your private life.

1312
01:16:41,695 --> 01:16:44,540
- You've certainly made that
clear over the last 10 years.

1313
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,217
Curious remark, don't you
think, coming from a husband?

1314
01:16:47,217 --> 01:16:49,566
- Nor do I have any desire to fight.

1315
01:16:49,566 --> 01:16:51,653
I truly want our
relationship to be amicable

1316
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:53,451
for the sake of our children

1317
01:16:53,451 --> 01:16:56,400
and so that we can function
properly in our public duties

1318
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,706
for the benefit of the nation.

1319
01:16:57,706 --> 01:16:58,836
- Charles, if you're
going to make a speech--

1320
01:16:58,836 --> 01:17:00,739
- I've known about your close friendship

1321
01:17:00,739 --> 01:17:02,256
for quite some time.

1322
01:17:02,256 --> 01:17:04,104
- I have many close friends.

1323
01:17:04,104 --> 01:17:06,981
Which one specifically
are you referring to?

1324
01:17:06,981 --> 01:17:08,231
- Major Hewitt.

1325
01:17:09,307 --> 01:17:12,236
I have reason to believe we can not keep

1326
01:17:12,236 --> 01:17:15,136
the proverbial lid on this much longer.

1327
01:17:15,136 --> 01:17:17,477
If it were to be made public, it would do

1328
01:17:17,477 --> 01:17:20,129
great harm to the crown.

1329
01:17:20,129 --> 01:17:21,470
From the evidence I've heard--

1330
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,138
- Evidence?

1331
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:24,305
What evidence?

1332
01:17:25,256 --> 01:17:26,782
Am I being spied on?

1333
01:17:26,782 --> 01:17:29,402
Are my phones tapped, what?

1334
01:17:29,402 --> 01:17:30,970
Am I supposed to install a shredder?

1335
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:32,948
You certainly weren't
too careful about leaving

1336
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:35,644
you love letters from
Camilla lying around.

1337
01:17:35,644 --> 01:17:38,307
Or did I forget to tell you
that I found them at Balmoral?

1338
01:17:38,307 --> 01:17:40,083
What colossal gall!

1339
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:43,056
You lecturing me about being indiscreet.

1340
01:17:43,056 --> 01:17:46,332
- You're growing boldness is
making you reckless, Diana.

1341
01:17:46,332 --> 01:17:49,361
- I repeat, what evidence
have you, Charles?

1342
01:17:49,361 --> 01:17:50,444
- Audio tape.

1343
01:17:51,464 --> 01:17:54,047
You and the Major having at it.

1344
01:17:54,947 --> 01:17:55,780
- What?

1345
01:17:57,014 --> 01:17:59,016
And you listened?

1346
01:17:59,016 --> 01:18:00,807
- I'm aware of its contents.

1347
01:18:00,807 --> 01:18:02,886
- I want that tape, Charles.

1348
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:04,457
- I didn't say that it
was in my possession

1349
01:18:04,457 --> 01:18:06,798
or that I would ever use it.

1350
01:18:06,798 --> 01:18:10,983
We're all vulnerable to
occasional breeches of security.

1351
01:18:10,983 --> 01:18:14,976
I was recently forced to put
a scrambler on my own phone.

1352
01:18:14,976 --> 01:18:19,209
It is my constitutional
duty to defend the monarchy,

1353
01:18:19,209 --> 01:18:22,363
to avoid any potential
embarrassment to the Queen,

1354
01:18:22,363 --> 01:18:26,251
and to use all available
resources in doing so.

1355
01:18:26,251 --> 01:18:28,500
- What is it that you want, Charles?

1356
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,447
- I want you to end
this affair immediately.

1357
01:18:31,447 --> 01:18:32,280
- No.

1358
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,102
If you want to lay blame for bringing down

1359
01:18:34,102 --> 01:18:37,352
the house of Windsor, look in a mirror!

1360
01:18:39,814 --> 01:18:43,901
I love James and I'm not
going to give him up.

1361
01:18:43,901 --> 01:18:45,401
Not now, not ever.

1362
01:18:53,482 --> 01:18:56,753
(car engine humming)

1363
01:18:56,753 --> 01:18:59,420
- [Photographer] Who's in there?

1364
01:19:01,755 --> 01:19:02,922
Oh, forget it.

1365
01:19:18,395 --> 01:19:22,768
- We're like an old
married couple, aren't we?

1366
01:19:22,768 --> 01:19:23,601
- No.

1367
01:19:25,353 --> 01:19:27,686
We still talk to each other.

1368
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:34,299
- How I've missed you.

1369
01:19:34,299 --> 01:19:35,882
- That's my secret.

1370
01:19:36,937 --> 01:19:37,770
Stay away.

1371
01:19:40,215 --> 01:19:43,136
Can you believe I've been
in the service (scoffs)

1372
01:19:43,136 --> 01:19:44,523
17 years?

1373
01:19:44,523 --> 01:19:47,356
- And no one's named you Napoleon?

1374
01:19:48,727 --> 01:19:50,765
I'll have to raise an army

1375
01:19:50,765 --> 01:19:54,155
so you can have a proper command.

1376
01:19:54,155 --> 01:19:56,236
- Darling, we have to be realistic.

1377
01:19:56,236 --> 01:20:00,689
All my life all I ever wanted
was to serve my country.

1378
01:20:00,689 --> 01:20:02,584
Ever since I was a little boy,

1379
01:20:02,584 --> 01:20:06,167
all I wanted was to be
a soldier and now...

1380
01:20:07,864 --> 01:20:12,031
I'm just frightened it's
all going to be taken away.

1381
01:20:13,782 --> 01:20:15,955
- James, I know you're
worried about Charles

1382
01:20:15,955 --> 01:20:20,328
having that tape, but I have
some ammunition of my own.

1383
01:20:20,328 --> 01:20:22,078
He won't dare use it.

1384
01:20:22,976 --> 01:20:23,809
Darling.

1385
01:20:24,713 --> 01:20:27,619
We can't let this come between us.

1386
01:20:27,619 --> 01:20:31,286
- Diana, I could be
chucked out of the army.

1387
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:36,760
(somber orchestral music)

1388
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,997
What else do I know how to do?

1389
01:20:38,997 --> 01:20:40,414
Besides love you.

1390
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,419
- But you're a hero.

1391
01:20:45,811 --> 01:20:48,065
- Quite the opposite.

1392
01:20:48,065 --> 01:20:51,469
If we're exposed, I'll be ruined.

1393
01:20:51,469 --> 01:20:52,802
And so will you.

1394
01:20:56,358 --> 01:20:58,358
You know that I'm right.

1395
01:21:01,332 --> 01:21:04,906
And you wouldn't want
William and Harry to be hurt.

1396
01:21:04,906 --> 01:21:08,406
(somber orchestral music)

1397
01:21:23,441 --> 01:21:26,358
(door clicks shut)

1398
01:21:27,281 --> 01:21:30,173
- The bulimic butterfly being
crushed on the royal wheel.

1399
01:21:30,173 --> 01:21:32,161
I mean, it's revolting.

1400
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:34,714
Charles, you must let your
friends speak on your behalf.

1401
01:21:34,714 --> 01:21:37,721
- Hm, that was the first
idea proposed to me by staff.

1402
01:21:37,721 --> 01:21:39,780
But however emotionally appealing,

1403
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:42,780
it's so distasteful, so undignified.

1404
01:21:43,793 --> 01:21:45,391
And the second idea was
that we should continue

1405
01:21:45,391 --> 01:21:47,416
as if nothing had happened.

1406
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:51,217
But who would trust Diana to carry on?

1407
01:21:51,217 --> 01:21:52,431
- Honestly, I'm beside myself.

1408
01:21:52,431 --> 01:21:54,717
The book is unspeakable rubbish!

1409
01:21:54,717 --> 01:21:57,766
It paints you as cold and uncaring,

1410
01:21:57,766 --> 01:22:00,433
always putting duty before love.

1411
01:22:03,411 --> 01:22:06,900
- Clearly, I'm not incapable of love.

1412
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,650
I'm just incapable of loving her.

1413
01:22:10,589 --> 01:22:11,862
- It's an atrocious pack of lies.

1414
01:22:11,862 --> 01:22:13,831
It's so unfair.

1415
01:22:13,831 --> 01:22:16,360
Did they propose a third solution?

1416
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,163
- Yes, one that I quite like.

1417
01:22:19,163 --> 01:22:21,454
They're going to try to
increase my popularity

1418
01:22:21,454 --> 01:22:23,370
by promoting me as a statesman,

1419
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:24,964
concentrating on global concerns

1420
01:22:24,964 --> 01:22:28,007
rather than an eccentric who's championing

1421
01:22:28,007 --> 01:22:31,112
old buildings and endangered
vegetables. (chuckles)

1422
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,535
(Camilla laughs)

1423
01:22:33,535 --> 01:22:34,368
Who knows?

1424
01:22:36,129 --> 01:22:40,129
Perhaps Diana has unwittingly
done us a service.

1425
01:22:41,385 --> 01:22:42,435
Perhaps she'll end up forcing mother

1426
01:22:42,435 --> 01:22:44,518
to agree to a separation.

1427
01:22:45,673 --> 01:22:47,527
- By law, the Queen has
the right to strip you

1428
01:22:47,527 --> 01:22:49,988
of your title and your royal duties,

1429
01:22:49,988 --> 01:22:52,400
but the most onerous possibility of all

1430
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,323
is that she has the power to dismiss you

1431
01:22:54,323 --> 01:22:56,183
as the mother of William and Harry.

1432
01:22:56,183 --> 01:22:57,183
- What?
- Mm.

1433
01:22:58,124 --> 01:23:01,172
In ironclad language known
as the grand question,

1434
01:23:01,172 --> 01:23:02,977
Parliament sets forth that the sovereign

1435
01:23:02,977 --> 01:23:04,963
has the right of supervision of the heirs.

1436
01:23:04,963 --> 01:23:07,068
In this case, the princes
William and Harry,

1437
01:23:07,068 --> 01:23:09,736
even during their parents' lifetimes.

1438
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:11,256
- She can take my boys?

1439
01:23:11,256 --> 01:23:12,385
- She can.

1440
01:23:12,385 --> 01:23:13,557
She very well might.

1441
01:23:13,557 --> 01:23:14,989
We must keep this in mind when negotiating

1442
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:17,156
your separation agreement.

1443
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:23,191
If you want to take on
the Queen, count me out.

1444
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,231
It would be no contest.

1445
01:23:26,231 --> 01:23:27,715
You'd lose.

1446
01:23:27,715 --> 01:23:30,318
- My children are my top priority.

1447
01:23:30,318 --> 01:23:32,292
I don't want to do anything
or agree to anything

1448
01:23:32,292 --> 01:23:35,119
that would jeopardize my access to them.

1449
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:38,786
Without my sons, my
life isn't worth living.

1450
01:23:47,871 --> 01:23:49,863
- What on earth's going on?

1451
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:51,826
- They've done it, it's official.

1452
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:53,050
Prime Minister just
announced it on the tele.

1453
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:54,905
They've separated.

1454
01:23:54,905 --> 01:23:57,471
Better try and hold on to
your job with both hands.

1455
01:23:57,471 --> 01:23:58,466
- But what's all this?

1456
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:00,248
- Oh, his nibs is cleaning house.

1457
01:24:00,248 --> 01:24:01,863
Can't have their wedding presents turn up

1458
01:24:01,863 --> 01:24:03,518
at some flea market, can they?

1459
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:05,207
- (scoffs) What a waste.

1460
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:07,572
Selfish, every last on of them.

1461
01:24:07,572 --> 01:24:09,192
You'd think it might occur to them

1462
01:24:09,192 --> 01:24:11,908
the least they could do is
give some of this to the poor.

1463
01:24:11,908 --> 01:24:13,904
Not to mention their poor servants.

1464
01:24:13,904 --> 01:24:16,654
(fire crackling)

1465
01:24:22,831 --> 01:24:25,136
- Here's why I had to
see you straight away.

1466
01:24:25,136 --> 01:24:27,247
Andrew Morton phoned asking about you.

1467
01:24:27,247 --> 01:24:29,020
He's doing another book.

1468
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,697
He wanted my to cooperate,
and of course I said

1469
01:24:30,697 --> 01:24:32,737
absolutely not.

1470
01:24:32,737 --> 01:24:34,741
- Call him back.

1471
01:24:34,741 --> 01:24:35,574
- What?

1472
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,567
- Tell him you'll talk.

1473
01:24:38,567 --> 01:24:40,801
- Diana, are you quiet sure?

1474
01:24:40,801 --> 01:24:42,699
- I have to do something.

1475
01:24:42,699 --> 01:24:45,872
I'm fed up of being
portrayed as a basket case.

1476
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:48,622
(engine revving)

1477
01:25:02,949 --> 01:25:05,449
(dog barking)

1478
01:25:12,485 --> 01:25:13,818
- You look well.

1479
01:25:15,209 --> 01:25:17,219
- Have you managed to find anything?

1480
01:25:17,219 --> 01:25:18,737
Work, I mean.

1481
01:25:18,737 --> 01:25:19,570
- No.

1482
01:25:21,905 --> 01:25:23,938
- Does your mother blame me?

1483
01:25:23,938 --> 01:25:24,771
- No.

1484
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:27,843
- Do you?

1485
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,848
- The army dismissed 1400 men.

1486
01:25:31,848 --> 01:25:33,732
I just happened to be one of them.

1487
01:25:33,732 --> 01:25:34,927
Diana, I have to tell you something

1488
01:25:34,927 --> 01:25:39,094
that you're not gonna like,
but I don't want you to worry.

1489
01:25:42,326 --> 01:25:46,493
The news about us is going
to break at any minute and

1490
01:25:48,655 --> 01:25:50,307
we just can't keep it secret any longer,

1491
01:25:50,307 --> 01:25:52,567
so I think it would be much better if

1492
01:25:52,567 --> 01:25:56,400
it comes out the way we
both know it happened.

1493
01:25:58,179 --> 01:26:00,679
I just hope you'll understand.

1494
01:26:01,534 --> 01:26:04,489
You had to tell your story,

1495
01:26:04,489 --> 01:26:07,489
I've had to sell mine to the papers.

1496
01:26:09,544 --> 01:26:12,127
This won't hurt you, I promise.

1497
01:26:14,401 --> 01:26:17,901
(somber orchestral music)

1498
01:26:29,204 --> 01:26:30,037
I'm sorry.

1499
01:26:32,859 --> 01:26:34,442
I'm terribly sorry.

1500
01:26:44,406 --> 01:26:47,804
(engine cranks)

1501
01:26:47,804 --> 01:26:50,887
(engine accelerates)

1502
01:27:10,168 --> 01:27:14,335
- My darlings, I wanted you
to hear this from me first

1503
01:27:15,651 --> 01:27:19,651
in case any of your friends
have said something.

1504
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:22,059
There's this book.

1505
01:27:22,059 --> 01:27:23,476
- We know, Mummy.

1506
01:27:29,819 --> 01:27:33,486
They're chocolates, to
make you smile again.

1507
01:27:39,305 --> 01:27:41,388
(laughs)

1508
01:27:43,127 --> 01:27:46,658
(sentimental orchestral music)

1509
01:27:46,658 --> 01:27:47,646
- [Interviewer] A book published recently

1510
01:27:47,646 --> 01:27:51,610
claims that you were close
with a Major James Hewitt.

1511
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:54,920
How would you characterize
your relationship?

1512
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,612
- He was a great friend of
mine at a very difficult time

1513
01:27:57,612 --> 01:28:00,886
and he was always there to support me.

1514
01:28:00,886 --> 01:28:03,228
I was absolutely devastated
when this book appeared

1515
01:28:03,228 --> 01:28:06,482
because I trusted him
and because I worried

1516
01:28:06,482 --> 01:28:08,798
about the impact on my children.

1517
01:28:08,798 --> 01:28:10,510
- [Interviewer] Did your close friendship

1518
01:28:10,510 --> 01:28:12,982
ever turn into anything more?

1519
01:28:12,982 --> 01:28:14,649
- Yes, I adored him.

1520
01:28:16,117 --> 01:28:17,681
Yes, I was in love with him,

1521
01:28:17,681 --> 01:28:19,681
but I was very let down.

1522
01:28:21,023 --> 01:28:24,090
It was extremely distressing to me.

1523
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,666
I felt very betrayed.

1524
01:28:26,666 --> 01:28:29,824
Sadly, the message is that ultimately

1525
01:28:29,824 --> 01:28:33,328
one can only depend on one's self.

1526
01:28:33,328 --> 01:28:34,900
- [Interviewer] What role do you envision

1527
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:37,488
for yourself in the future?

1528
01:28:37,488 --> 01:28:39,655
Do you expect to be queen?

1529
01:28:40,701 --> 01:28:44,652
- I don't see myself being
queen of this country.

1530
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:48,819
But I'd very much like to
be queen of people's hearts.

1531
01:28:50,321 --> 01:28:52,951
- [Narrator] After 15 years of marriage,

1532
01:28:52,951 --> 01:28:54,505
the Prince and Princess of Wales

1533
01:28:54,505 --> 01:28:57,183
are now negotiating a divorce,

1534
01:28:57,183 --> 01:28:59,022
bringing to an end the fairytale

1535
01:28:59,022 --> 01:29:01,854
that captured the
imagination of the world.

1536
01:29:01,854 --> 01:29:05,521
(dramatic orchestral music)

1537
01:29:09,767 --> 01:29:13,267
