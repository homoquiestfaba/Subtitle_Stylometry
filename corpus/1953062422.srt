1
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:11,304
DR. DEXTER: As your doctor, l'm having
you continue this with the pharmacist.

2
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:17,321
DR. DEXTER: But as yourfriend,
l'm asking you to meet me halfway.

3
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:23,294
DR. DEXTER: The first step towards any
real progress is communication , Robert.

4
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:28,389
DR. DEXTER: And that's a two-way street...
lneed your help.

5
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:33,328
DR. DEXTER: You 're not just a patient.

6
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:38,308
DR. DEXTER: l made a promise to your Mother;
one l intend fully to keep.

7
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:46,409
DR. DEXTER: Anytime, day or night,
you need to talk, you call me. l'll be there for you .

8
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,464
LANDLADY: Three-thirty, back from the druggist;
l can set my watch by you .

9
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:11,299
LANDLADY: And pays his rent on time,
just like clockwork.

10
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,401
LANDLADY: l wish all my tenants could be like you .

11
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:17,404
LANDLADY: You 're a good, reliable man .
That's hard to find these days.

12
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:21,350
LANDLADY: All those pills you take.
That's not what you need.

13
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:23,411
LANDLADY: The druggist doesn 't have your cure.

14
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:27,414
LANDLADY: What you need is a good woman .

15
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,355
LANDLADY: l want you to meet my niece.

16
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:36,330
LANDLADY: She's coming here from New York.

17
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:40,394
LANDLADY: She'd be good for you . She's pretty.

18
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:45,501
LANDLADY: She doesn 't have any friends either.
And she's a good cook.

19
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:49,407
LANDLADY: She'd make you a good healthy dinner...

20
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:54,308
LANDLADY: Okay?
PlCKMAN: Alright...

21
00:05:57,302 --> 00:06:01,466
ART DEALER: Twelve noon , right on the dot.
Are you ever late, Mr. Pickman ?

22
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:03,337
ART DEALER: l have good news for you .

23
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:07,311
ART DEALER: l got you another commission ,
a bed and breakfast out in the country.

24
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:12,373
ART DEALER: This old lady is redoing her guestrooms and
wants several paintings to match her new wallpaper.

25
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,476
ART DEALER: l got herto commit to six. Six!

26
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:17,414
ART DEALER: That will pay both of our rents for
the rest of the year.

27
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:22,222
ART DEALER: But l can 't take any credit;
it's never been hard to sell a Pickman .

28
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:27,424
ART DEALER: You have quite a knack for painting those
Lighthouses and Seascapes. These old ladies love you .

29
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:31,458
ART DEALER: Here are the swatches forthe wallpaper,
so you can match the colors.

30
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:41,507
ART DEALER: What's this? This isn 't the painting
we discussed.

31
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:44,509
ART DEALER: l know this painting.

32
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:48,446
ART DEALER: This was the one rejected by that decorator --
and rightly so.

33
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:52,354
ART DEALER: This isn 't your normal work. Look at these
brush strokes...

34
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,450
ART DEALER: ...very amateurish, and there's no soul,
no emotions...

35
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:59,363
ART DEALER: My God, Pickman; that was over a month ago.

36
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:03,458
ART DEALER: Do you mean to tell me you haven 't painted
anything new since then ?

37
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:06,235
ART DEALER: This is our livelihood, Pickman .

38
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:09,364
ART DEALER: This puts us way behind. Ashcroft is expecting
four paintings, and he's not a patient man .

39
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:11,398
ART DEALER: What am l supposed to tell him?

40
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:15,311
PlCKMAN: Fine! Tell him l can 't do it anymore.

41
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:17,314
ART DEALER: Robert.

42
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:23,250
ART DEALER: Alright, Robert, l'm sorry.
Maybe l've been overworking you a bit.

43
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:26,382
ART DEALER: lt's just that the money has been so good.

44
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:31,395
ART DEALER: Alright, take some time away.
l'll stall Ashcroft for a week ortwo...

45
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:38,266
ART DEALER: Travel; go on vacation; see some new sights.

46
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:42,362
PlCKMAN: What's the point? lt all looks the same...no?

47
00:07:48,513 --> 00:07:50,504
ART DEALER: Oh, God...

48
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:06,460
DR. DEXTER: Robert? lt's Ambrose Dexter.

49
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,242
PlCKMAN: What do you want?

50
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:17,475
LANDLADY: l'm so sorry. Your doctorthought you
might be needing help.

51
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:21,382
DR. DEXTER: Robert, You missed two appointments.
l was concerned. l was worried.

52
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:23,250
PlCKMAN: l've been working.

53
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:26,449
LANDLADY: l'm very sorry, Mr. Pickman . We'll be
leaving you now.

54
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:28,482
DR. DEXTER: Working...? Robert, you 're painting again ?

55
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:30,290
DR. DEXTER: That's wonderful! What brought you around?

56
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:34,320
PlCKMAN: Doc, ljust don 't have time to get into it right now;
l have to get back to work.

57
00:12:34,365 --> 00:12:36,492
LANDLADY: Yes, of course. Sorry to have disturbed you .

58
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:41,471
DR. DEXTER: Well, Robert, you know l'm the last man in the
world that would everwant to stop you from getting back
to work...

59
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:44,236
DR. DEXTER: But, when you have the time, come on in
and make an appointment...

60
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:45,435
DR. DEXTER: You know there's always room for you
in my schedule.

61
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:48,445
PlCKMAN: Yes. l will.

62
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:31,345
ART DEALER: Well, l'll be. What are you doing here today,
Mr. Pickman ? This isn 't your usual appointment.

63
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:37,292
PlCKMAN: l need money for more paint and canvases
and supplies and stuff.

64
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:40,320
PlCKMAN: Look. Can you sell this?

65
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,493
ART DEALER: lnteresting. Where did you get this,
Mr. Pickman ?

66
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:48,330
PlCKMAN: What do you mean ? lt's mine.

67
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:50,306
ART DEALER: Yours?

68
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:52,308
PlCKMAN: Yeah. l painted it.

69
00:13:52,343 --> 00:13:54,311
ART DEALER: You 're joking with me.
PlCKMAN: No.

70
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:57,246
ART DEALER: This isn 't anything like yourwork.

71
00:13:58,282 --> 00:14:00,273
ART DEALER: l'd swearthis was the work of Goodie Hines.

72
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:01,409
PlCKMAN: No. lt's my work.

73
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:05,222
ART DEALER: l've seen my share of recreations
of Goodie's work...

74
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:07,382
ART DEALER: but this, by far, is the best l've ever seen .

75
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:11,384
PlCKMAN: No, no, no. This is not a recreation .

76
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:15,263
PlCKMAN: This is an example of my new stuff, my new work.

77
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:17,426
PlCKMAN: l don 't even know who Goodie Hines is...

78
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:22,405
ART DEALER: Don 't you ever read the papers? ''The Vicious
Visionary'', ''The Painter of Pain ''.

79
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:25,237
ART DEALER: The media had a field day with him.

80
00:14:25,276 --> 00:14:29,406
ART DEALER: You really should keep up with the news.
He killed and mutilated seven people.

81
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:35,309
ART DEALER: He cut their eyes out while they were still living.
He said they begged him to do it.

82
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:39,345
PlCKMAN: l'm sure they did... l still don 't know who he is.

83
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:45,293
ART DEALER: You should. He's up at County Hospital
with your Dr. Dexter.

84
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:47,490
ART DEALER: Ambrose Dexter is your doctor, right?

85
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:49,260
PlCKMAN: Yeah.

86
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:53,233
ART DEALER: He never mentioned Goodie?
PlCKMAN: No! l don 't even know why he would.

87
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:55,397
ART DEALER: Your Doctor kept Goodie from getting the Chair.

88
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:59,305
ART DEALER: Sometimes l think you live in a bubble.
You know that, Robert?.

89
00:14:59,343 --> 00:15:01,334
PlCKMAN: Maybe l do. ljust came by for supplies...

90
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:03,243
ART DEALER: Ever since all that horrible business...

91
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:06,409
ART DEALER: l've got people coming in here all the time trying
to pass off imitations of Goodie's work...

92
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,283
ART DEALER: ...especially of the church.

93
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:13,380
ARTDEALER: This is the best example l've seen .

94
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:16,257
ART DEALER: And you 've never seen one of
Goodie's paintings?

95
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:19,320
PlCKMAN: ljust don 't know how many times l can tell you -- no.

96
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:23,231
ART DEALER: That's simply amazing. Well, l want to show
you something.

97
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:24,495
PlCKMAN: Show me what?

98
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:28,261
ART DEALER: One of Goodie's works, of course. l've got one
of the last ones.

99
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:31,400
ART DEALER: Managed to get one before they locked them all
up as evidence.

100
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:34,411
ART DEALER: And l'm going to retire on that sale when
the time's right.

101
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:38,279
PlCKMAN: l don 't have time right now. ljust need
the supplies...

102
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:41,444
ART DEALER: l'll take care of your supplies. But come on ,
l want to show you this.

103
00:15:43,554 --> 00:15:49,288
ART DEALER: l'm embarrassed to say it, but those murders
were a real boon for sales.

104
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:57,462
ART DEALER: You know what they say: Nothing improves the
price of an artist's work more than death, or insanity.

105
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:03,297
ART DEALER: l had a feeling something was not right with
Goodie when he starting signing his paintings differently.

106
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:13,445
ART DEALER: Strange little thing, really; he began connecting
the two O's in Goodie like the sign for infinity.

107
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,326
ART DEALER: Yep. Amazing piece of work, isn 't it?

108
00:16:23,394 --> 00:16:29,424
ART DEALER: Say what you want about the material, but no
one has a right to deprive the art community of such work.

109
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:34,369
PlCKMAN: l've never seen anything like this.

110
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:40,342
ARTDEALER: This is one of his last pieces. His most radical
change in style.

111
00:16:41,312 --> 00:16:45,271
ART DEALER: Don 't stare at it too long; it'll give you one hell of
a headache.

112
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:49,309
ART DEALER: Something he does with the angles, the way
they are all wrong like that.

113
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:56,326
ART DEALER: You 'll get a pain in your head a handful of
aspirins won 't get rid of -- trust me.

114
00:16:57,395 --> 00:17:02,332
ART DEALER: Hideous and beautiful all at the
same time -- isn 't it?

115
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:06,264
PlCKMAN: l'd give anything to paint like this.

116
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:12,206
ART DEALER: He had such an incredible imagination .

117
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:18,237
ART DEALER: No matter how horrible the image, you feel as if
you know it, or should know it.

118
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:20,250
PlCKMAN: Like a forgotten nightmare...

119
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:23,253
ART DEALER: Look at the faces of the victims.

120
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:29,248
ART DEALER: The anguish is so real, and every inch of that
strange landscape holds a weight to it, a truth.

121
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:38,232
ART DEALER: As if it were drawn from a photograph
and not pulled from his imagination .

122
00:17:38,335 --> 00:17:42,294
ART DEALER: As if he were there.

123
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:49,335
ART DEALER: He would go on and on about anotherworld that
he said he was able to look upon through a secret window.

124
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:54,384
ART DEALER: He was painting like an out of control fire.

125
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:59,253
ART DEALER: At times l almost though the was afraid of what
would happen if he should stop...

126
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:03,323
ART DEALER: But nothing kept him from getting his worlds
onto canvas.

127
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,319
ART DEALER: Even when he ran out of supplies,
he found a way...

128
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:13,392
ART DEALER: When he ran out of canvases, he simply painted
overwhat was his first obsession ...

129
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:19,341
PlCKMAN: lt's the church... The church on Federal Hill.

130
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:25,281
ART DEALER: lt's almost like a watermark for any of
Goodie's final work.

131
00:18:38,362 --> 00:18:40,353
GUARD: Dr. Dexter, l'm glad to see you . l've been paging you .

132
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:41,420
DR. DEXTER: ls Doctor Meyer alright?.

133
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:43,228
GUARD: Yes.

134
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:45,258
DR. DEXTER: Was he with Goodie Hines?

135
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:47,429
GUARD: He's still down there.

136
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:56,276
DR. DEXTER: l was in the otherwing. The orderly told me....
Are you all right?

137
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:59,282
RlCHARD: Yes. l'll be fine.

138
00:18:59,283 --> 00:19:01,444
RlCHARD: lt's just a scratch; it'll heal.

139
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,453
RlCHARD: l'm not so sure about my pride.

140
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:06,320
DR. DEXTER: What happened?

141
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:12,387
RlCHARD: l wasn 't paying attention . l was concentrating on my
notes, and l let Goodie get too close...

142
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:15,226
RlCHARD: He managed to get my fountain pen from me.

143
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:17,257
DR. DEXTER: Oh, Richard..!

144
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:19,235
RlCHARD: l know, l know. l feel so foolish.

145
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,206
DR. DEXTER: That's all l need today, Goodie Hines with a pen .

146
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:26,368
DR. DEXTER: You know how hard it's going to be to
get that pen from him?

147
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,277
DR. DEXTER: We might as well be trying to unscrew
all his limbs.

148
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:32,339
RlCHARD: l'm sorry. l feel like a first year resident.

149
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:35,284
DR. DEXTER: No, the important thing is you 're all right.

LANDLADY: lgnoring sin is more of a sin than sin itself.

244
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:34,472

slowly creep into this world.

PlCKMAN: Simple...simple...simpletons...

269
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:44,442
PlCKMAN: They know nothing about art -- or creativity...

270
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:47,354
DR. DEXTER: Robert, your landlady is going to evict you !

271
00:35:47,423 --> 00:35:49,288
PlCKMAN: l can handle my landlady.

272
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:51,418
PlCKMAN: Nothing a little bit of money won 't solve -- right?

273
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:54,362
DR. DEXTER: l'm afraid not. lt's gone way beyond that.

274
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:59,265

yourself involved with...

275

PlCKMAN: l don 't have time for your games.

281
00:36:13,383 --> 00:36:14,441
DR. DEXTER: This is not a game.

282
00:36:14,484 --> 00:36:17,214
DR. DEXTER: Where did you get the ideas forthese images?

283
00:36:17,453 --> 00:36:20,286
PlCKMAN: You can call it inspiration .

284
00:36:20,323 --> 00:36:21,483
DR. DEXTER: Did Goodie Hines inspire you ?

285
00:36:22,258 --> 00:36:24,419
PlCKMAN: Goodie. Goodie. Goodie. That's the second time

289
00:36:33,469 --> 00:36:36,267
DR. DEXTER: Where did you get the ideas forthese images?

290
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:38,274
PlCKMAN: So now you call me a plagiarist!

291
00:36:38,308 --> 00:36:41,402
PlCKMAN: A plagiarist! As if l'm not capable of painting
something myself!

292
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,247
PlCKMAN: Doc...

293
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:49,281
PlCKMAN: Our relationship is over;
lneed you to leave.

294
00:36:49,452 --> 00:36:51,249
PlCKMAN: You never respected me.

295
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:56,316
PlCKMAN: And if you want these pictures of the church -- you
can have them.

296
00:36:57,327 --> 00:36:58,453
PlCKMAN: Consider it yourfinal payment.

297
00:36:58,494 --> 00:37:00,325
PlCKMAN: Please,just leave.

298
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:11,216
DR. DEXTER: Pardon me young ladies.

299
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:13,448
DR. DEXTER: l noticed something odd in the churchyard
overthere...

300
00:40:14,424 --> 00:40:16,483
DR. DEXTER: Do any of you know anything about it?

301
00:40:16,526 --> 00:40:21,463
GlRL: A nasty octopus, or a squid, or something -- right?

302
00:40:21,497 --> 00:40:25,263
GlRL: That thing is stinking up the street!

303
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:27,235
GlRL: Probably one of the boys did it.

304
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,370
DR. DEXTER: Why would they do something like that?.

305
00:40:29,372 --> 00:40:31,363
GlRL: They try to show each otherthey're not scared.

306
00:40:32,308 --> 00:40:35,243
DR. DEXTER: Scared? Of the Church?

307
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:37,379
DR. DEXTER: You girls don 't believe in ghosts -- do you ?

308
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:41,281
GlRL: Not ghosts, something worse.

309
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:43,376
GlRL: The boys put that thing in the yard to make fun of their
religion .

310
00:40:43,453 --> 00:40:46,513

311
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,257
DR. DEXTER: l don 't understand.

312
00:40:48,324 --> 00:40:50,519
DR. DEXTER: What does that thing in the yard have to do with
a Catholic Church?

313
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,454
GlRL: lt's not a Catholic Church anymore.

314
00:40:52,495 --> 00:40:54,360
GlRL: lt hasn 't been for like a hundred years.

315

00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:57,323
DR. DEXTER: Who bought it?

317
00:40:57,467 --> 00:41:01,426

318
00:41:01,471 --> 00:41:05,237

320
00:41:07,343 --> 00:41:09,277

321
00:41:09,312 --> 00:41:11,337
DR. DEXTER: You really think people are that scared of
the place?

322
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,315
GlRL: Sure. Can 't you tell by just looking at it?

323
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,284

00:42:47,343 --> 00:42:48,275

new computer system.

349

religious organization named ''Starry Wisdom''.

350
00:43:02,525 --> 00:43:05,358
DR. DEXTER: Did you say Starry Wisdom?

351
00:43:05,394 --> 00:43:08,454

00:43:09,365 --> 00:43:10,491
DR. DEXTER: Starry Wisdom...

353
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:11,528

CLERK: Can l get you a glass of water or something?

355
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,397
CLERK: You look like you 've seen a ghost.

356
00:43:19,442 --> 00:43:21,410
GOODlE: l'd wake up every day staring out the window...

357
00:43:21,444 --> 00:43:26,404
GOODlE: ...praying for something, anything, different then what
l had seen the day before.

358
00:43:32,254 --> 00:43:33,516
GOODlE: Anything.

359
00:43:35,257 --> 00:43:36,281
GOODlE: Beauty.

360
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,294
GOODlE: Horror.

361
00:43:41,263 --> 00:43:46,496
GOODlE: Anything but the same horizon , the same blue sky.

362
00:43:49,438 --> 00:43:54,501
GOODlE: But each day just ticked before me like the next...

363
00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:02,479
GOODlE: ...like a metronome.

364
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:09,347
GOODlE: Tick... Tock... Tick... Tock...

365
00:44:13,262 --> 00:44:17,221
GOODlE: Pounding the same question into my mind!

366
00:44:17,266 --> 00:44:18,324
GOODlE: Why...?!

367
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:23,395
GOODlE: Why... go on ?

368
00:44:25,307 --> 00:44:28,401
GOODlE: The only thing that would turn me back...

369
00:44:28,411 --> 00:44:34,475
GOODlE: ...was the sudden fearthat what might be next, may
be even more tedious.

370
00:44:39,422 --> 00:44:41,515
GOODlE: Then l found Starry Wisdom.

371
00:44:43,426 --> 00:44:46,259
GOODlE: Starry Wisdom holds the window...

372
00:44:46,295 --> 00:44:49,526
GOODlE: ...which shows me the world unseen .

373
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:56,238
lNTERVlEWER: Does this Starry Wisdom tell you to do things?

374
00:44:57,306 --> 00:45:00,469
GOODlE: Yes... Oh, yes.

375
00:45:03,312 --> 00:45:07,305
GOODlE: For my duties, l am rewarded.

376
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,341

lNTERVlEWER: l'm interested, Goodie...

380
00:45:23,332 --> 00:45:26,460
lNTERVlEWER: ...why do you keep referring to your creative
side as that?

381
00:45:27,369 --> 00:45:28,461
GOODlE: As what?.

382
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:30,329
lNTERVlEWER: Starry Wisdom.

383
00:45:30,406 --> 00:45:32,374
lNTERVlEWER: That's what Starry Wisdom is, isn 't it...?

384
00:45:32,408 --> 00:45:35,468
lNTERVlEWER: Your creative side? Your imagination ?

385
00:45:35,511 --> 00:45:39,242
lNTERVlEWER: Why do you choose to call it that?.

386
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:43,274
GOODlE: You think Starry Wisdom is a metaphor?

387
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:45,310
GOODlE: A simile?

388
00:45:46,322 --> 00:45:48,449
GOODlE: A fabrication of my mind?

389
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:52,393
GOODlE: Well, my mind is clear...

390
00:45:53,262 --> 00:45:55,423
GOODlE: Yours is clouded.

391
00:45:56,365 --> 00:45:59,391

00:46:07,276 --> 00:46:10,473
GOODlE: Starry Wisdom is right on the horizon , but you
can 't see it.

396
00:46:11,347 --> 00:46:13,508
GOODlE: lt's right under your nose.

397
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,411
GOODlE: Look out any window in this city and you will see it!

GOODlE: to commit to the deed that was required of me.

624
01:08:55,376 --> 01:09:00,507
GOODlE: But, then , l realized that there was no decision
to make.

625
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:06,377
GOODlE: ln a sense, it was already made by me.

626
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:12,384
GOODlE: And l was never going back to the way things were...

627
01:09:13,394 --> 01:09:15,453
GOODlE: ...before l saw the other side.

628

01:09:37,318 --> 01:09:38,444
PlCKMAN: Yes.

632
01:09:41,355 --> 01:09:50,263
GOODlE: Didn 't they free you from the torture of seeing the
same horizon , the same blue sky?

633
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,494
