00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,110
<font color=#ffff00><i>My generation,
we were born into war.</i></font>

2
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,330
<font color=#ffff00><i>Giant monsters attacked our world.</i></font>

3
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,440
<font color=#ffff00><i>We called them 'Kaiju'.</i></font>

4
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,850
<font color=#ffff00><i>They came through the breach.</i></font>

5
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:10,040
<font color=#ffff00><i>A gateway to another dimension, at
the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.</i></font>

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,900
<font color=#ffff00><i>They were sent by an alien race
on the other side...</i></font>

7
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,820
<font color=#ffff00><i>the Precursors.</i></font>

8
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,620
<font color=#ffff00><i>We fought back...</i></font>

9
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,790
<font color=#ffff00><i>built in our own monsters.</i></font>

10
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,960
<font color=#ffff00><i>Jaegers, giant robots.</i></font>

11
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,880
<font color=#ffff00><i>So big they needed
two pilots to run them.</i></font>

12
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,400
<font color=#ffff00><i>My father was one of them.</i></font>

13
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,480
<font color=#ffff00><i>He sacrificed himself
to help save the world.</i></font>

14
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,190
<font color=#ffff00><i>I am not my father.</i></font>

15
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,930
<font color=#ffff00><i>It's been 10 years since we won the
war and closed the breach.</i></font>

16
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,320
<font color=#ffff00><i>Most of the world has recovered...</i></font>

17
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,260
<font color=#ffff00><i>but few coastal cities never did.</i></font>

18
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,250
<font color=#ffff00><i>And the world is still
picking up the pieces.</i></font>

19
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,330
<font color=#ffff00><i>But some of us live
better in a broken world.</i></font>

20
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,330
<font color=#ffff00><i>And squatting in half a mansion...</i></font>

21
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,540
<font color=#ffff00><i>is better than paying for
some crappy apartment.</i></font>

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,619
<font color=#ffff00><i>Now in the relief zones
you have to get creative,</i></font>

23
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,830
<font color=#ffff00><i>you have to hustle.</i></font>

24
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,430
<font color=#ffff00><i>Somebody else might eat
your breakfast.</i></font>

25
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,710
<font color=#ffff00><i>And your cookies.</i></font>

26
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,710
<font color=#ffff00><i>And your damn hot sauce.</i></font>

27
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,240
<font color=#ffff00><i>You know out here we place a
different value on things.</i></font>

28
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,619
<font color=#ffff00><i>The Pan Pacific Defense Corps
usually looks the other way...</i></font>

29
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,880
<font color=#ffff00><i>as long as you don't go poking
around where you don't belong.</i></font>

30
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,220
<font color=#ffff00><i>Say like a, decommissioned
Jaeger scrape yard.</i></font>

31
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,930
<font color=#ffff00><i>Big risks mean big rewards...</i></font>

32
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,240
<font color=#ffff00><i>and nothing pays more
than stolen Jaegertech.</i></font>

33
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,550
<font color=#ffff00><i>Plenty of nutcases out here
trying to make their own Jaegers.</i></font>

34
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,370
<font color=#ffff00><i>But they need the parts to do it.</i></font>

35
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,290
<font color=#ffff00><i>So if you can steal what
no one else can steal...</i></font>

36
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,900
<font color=#ffff00><i>you can live like a king.</i></font>

37
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,010
<font color=#ffff00>Are you sure it's in here?</font>

38
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,090
<font color=#ffff00>Power cords are stripped before
they get decommissioned...</font>

39
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,479
<font color=#ffff00>but sometimes they miss the
tertiary plasma capacitors.</font>

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,430
<font color=#ffff00>And that's a big score.
This one is still holding the charge.</font>

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,509
<font color=#ffff00>You better hope so.</font>

42
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,199
<font color=#ffff00>OK. Just calm down.
Just not get excited.</font>

43
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,380
<font color=#ffff00>I'm just playing the odds here.</font>

44
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,739
<font color=#ffff00>You cheated Barada and while you
escaped another Chau in Hong Kong.</font>

45
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,649
<font color=#ffff00>- That was a misunderstanding.
- And stole from me, my own backyard.</font>

46
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,500
<font color=#ffff00>Now I'm stealing for you.
Cycle of life.</font>

47
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,510
<font color=#ffff00>- You good?
- You deliver...</font>

48
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,620
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah.</font>

49
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,750
<font color=#ffff00>- We good.
- Okay.</font>

50
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,270
<font color=#ffff00>- Let's get rich.
- Nice.</font>

52
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,560
<font color=#ffff00>Where is it?</font>

53
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,270
<font color=#ffff00>Hey man, uh...
Just a little situation.</font>

54
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,270
<font color=#ffff00>It says it's here.
It is supposed to be right there.</font>

55
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,480
<font color=#ffff00>Well, you know what,
Let me just figure this out.</font>

56
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,580
<font color=#ffff00>Somebody please kill this guy for me.</font>

57
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,620
<font color=#ffff00><i>Target moving.</i></font>

58
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,200
<font color=#ffff00>No, it's here. You wait, wait.
Some one else is in here.</font>

59
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,639
<font color=#ffff00>Someone else has the capacitor.
Now, let's go. Come on!</font>

60
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,940
<font color=#ffff00>Jake! Jake! Wait!</font>

61
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,590
<font color=#ffff00>Son of a.</font>

62
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,950
<font color=#ffff00>Go, go, go!</font>

63
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,520
<font color=#ffff00>Spread out.</font>

00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,080
<font color=#ffff00><i>Come on, Jake!</i></font>

65
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,700
<font color=#ffff00><i>- Boss, he went through here!
- Hurry up.</i></font>

66
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,750
<font color=#ffff00><i>I see him. I see him.</i></font>

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,760
<font color=#ffff00>Jake, Jake, Jake. Nice try.</font>

68
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,560
<font color=#ffff00>- Yeah. We're good!
- Jake.</font>

69
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,870

- Old enough to kick your ass.</font>

77
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,440
<font color=#ffff00>Let's take a second.
Back off. Back off.</font>

78
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,410
<font color=#ffff00>- You build this to yourself?
- What do you think?</font>

79
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,619
<font color=#ffff00>I think I can sell your
little toy for a whole lot of money.</font>

80
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,760
<font color=#ffff00>Scrapper is not a toy
and she is not for sale.</font>

81
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,860
<font color=#ffff00>The man holding
the pipe says yes.</font>

82
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,710
<font color=#ffff00>So listen up...</font>

83
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,180
<font color=#ffff00>- You led them here?
- It's impossible.</font>

84
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,060
<font color=#ffff00>What the hell now?</font>

85
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,200
<font color=#ffff00>Come on. Come on. Come on.</font>

86
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,840
<font color=#ffff00>Yes. It works!</font>

87
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,490
<font color=#ffff00>Hey! Get out!
What are you doing?</font>

88
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,550
<font color=#ffff00>- No no. Stop.
- Where is it?</font>

89
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,970
<font color=#ffff00>Don't touch that.
Hey! What are you doing?</font>

90
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,420
<font color=#ffff00>- Where is the other one?
- The other what?</font>

91
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,010
<font color=#ffff00>The other cray door,
A Jaeger needs two pilots.</font>

92
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,480
<font color=#ffff00>Scrapper is small enough
to run on a single neural lobe.</font>

93
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,400
<font color=#ffff00>Either you get out or you let me pilot it.</font>

94
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,990
<font color=#ffff00>- Get out.
- Screw that.</font>

95
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,600
<font color=#ffff00>- Told you she is not a toy.
- You're gonna get us killed.</font>

96
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,030
<font color=#ffff00>- I can get us out of here.
- I just got us out.</font>

97
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,120
<font color=#ffff00>Oh my God.</font>

98
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,199

101
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,940
<font color=#ffff00>Power down and exit your comm pod.</font>

102
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,719
<font color=#ffff00>No, no, don't give up.
You give up way too easy.</font>

103
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,460
<font color=#ffff00>That's what they think.</font>

104
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,690
<font color=#ffff00>Stop.</font>

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,539

108
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,050
<font color=#ffff00>Hang tighter.</font>

109
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,380
<font color=#ffff00>Seriously?</font>

110
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,750
<font color=#ffff00>Stop.</font>

111
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,989
<font color=#ffff00>See?</font>

112
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,440
<font color=#ffff00>I just outplayed with November Ajax.</font>

113
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,720
<font color=#ffff00>- No you didn't.
- I did.</font>

114
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,600
<font color=#ffff00>Didn't.</font>

115
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,630
<font color=#ffff00>OK. What do you got?
And I'm not getting out.</font>

116
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,970
<font color=#ffff00>- One of those ion cells redundant?
- No.</font>

117
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,910
<font color=#ffff00>- They are now.
- But we need that.</font>

118
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,910
<font color=#ffff00>Get up to Ajax's head.</font>

119
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,840
<font color=#ffff00>- What?
- Go!</font>

120
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,140
<font color=#ffff00><i>Power down...</i></font>

121

<font color=#ffff00><i>Eleven percent.</i></font>

124
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,470
<font color=#ffff00>How long before Ajax can
reboot its systems?</font>

125
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,580
<font color=#ffff00>About that long.</font>

126
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,290
<font color=#ffff00>Power down.
This is your final warning.</font>

127
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,060
<font color=#ffff00>Alright! Lets go.</font>

128
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,340
<font color=#ffff00>Look what you did
to my Jaeger you jerk.</font>

129
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,370
<font color=#ffff00>You should have let me pilot it.</font>

130
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,580
<font color=#ffff00>Oh like this is my fault.</font>

131
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,920
<font color=#ffff00>You compromised my command center.</font>

132
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,680
<font color=#ffff00>Wow. Your command center?
Sorry, sorry to hear that.</font>

133
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,510
<font color=#ffff00>And you had no place to come in
and try to tell me what to do.</font>

134
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,710
<font color=#ffff00>I go where I want.
This is different world.</font>

135
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,870
<font color=#ffff00>Look where we're at.</font>

136

<font color=#ffff00>Your top lip and your bottom lip

137
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:45,180

Shut up! Shut up! Conversation done.</font>

138
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,780
<font color=#ffff00>Junkyard baby.</font>

139
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,200
<font color=#ffff00>- Why did you build it?
- What happened to the shutting up?</font>

140
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,570
<font color=#ffff00>Says you wasn't gonna sell it.
What the hell was you gonna do?</font>

141
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,290
<font color=#ffff00>Rob a bank or something?</font>

142
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,220
<font color=#ffff00>I built her because one day
they are gonna come back.</font>

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,159
<font color=#ffff00>And then do I'm not
gonna be stuck waiting</font>

145
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,320
<font color=#ffff00>for some one else
to come save my ass.</font>

146
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,770
<font color=#ffff00>Not like before.</font>

147
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,630
<font color=#ffff00>You, let's go.</font>

148
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,309
<font color=#ffff00><i>I do not wanna talk about it.
It's ridiculous.</i></font>

149
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,300
<font color=#ffff00><i>I have the right to silence...</i></font>

150
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,090
<font color=#ffff00><i>Hello, Jake.</i></font>

151
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,070
<font color=#ffff00><i>Here we are again.</i></font>

152
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,710
<font color=#ffff00>Just a stretch of bad luck I figure out.</font>

153
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,410
<font color=#ffff00><i>Your father used to say
we make our own luck.</i></font>

154
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,510
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, well. Dad said a lot of things.</font>

155
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,889
<font color=#ffff00><i>You were arrested in a rogue Jaeger.</i></font>

156
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,566
<font color=#ffff00>Hold on a second. That wasn't my Jaeger.
This little kid, she's about...</font>

157
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,110
<font color=#ffff00><i>You have priors.
This is serious.</i></font>

158
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,069
<font color=#ffff00>That's why I need my big sis</font>

159
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,820
<font color=#ffff00>to help me get
the hell out of here.</font>

160
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,740
<font color=#ffff00>Just one last time.</font>

161
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,490
<font color=#ffff00><i>They are not going to
let you just walk.</i></font>

162
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,660
<font color=#ffff00><i>But there might be another way.</i></font>

163
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,260
<font color=#ffff00>OK. See, that's what I wanna
hear, let's talk about.</font>

164
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,570
<font color=#ffff00>The other way. Lay it on me.
What do I gotta do?</font>

165
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,460
<font color=#ffff00><i>Re enlist and finish what you started.</i></font>

166
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,510
<font color=#ffff00>I am not doing that.
I am too old to be a cadet.</font>

167
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,390
<font color=#ffff00><i>I don't want you to be a cadet.</i></font>

168
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,060
<font color=#ffff00><i>I want you to help train them.</i></font>

169
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,480
<font color=#ffff00>Train who? Train what?
I am not training no damn kids.</font>

170
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,780
<font color=#ffff00><i>The transport is standing by to
bring both of you to Moyulan.</i></font>

171
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,960
<font color=#ffff00>Both of us?</font>

172
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,870
<font color=#ffff00><i>You and your new recruit.</i></font>

173

<font color=#ffff00>Mako.</font>

174
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,550
<font color=#ffff00>I can't believe she
just hologramed me.</font>

177
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,579
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah. Look, I didn't have a choice.</font>

178
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,780
<font color=#ffff00>I know I get it, but why me?</font>

179
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,869
<font color=#ffff00>Why do they want me for the program?</font>

180
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,830
<font color=#ffff00>You built and piloted
your own Jaeger.</font>

181
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,960
<font color=#ffff00>These people like
that kind of stuff.</font>

182
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,340
<font color=#ffff00>So then why am I just a cadet
and you get to be a ranger.</font>

185
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,610
<font color=#ffff00>Scrapper.</font>

186
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,820
<font color=#ffff00>You gotta be kidding me.</font>

187
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,280
<font color=#ffff00>I didn't believe it when they
told me you were inbound.</font>

188
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,299
<font color=#ffff00>- How you doing, Nate?
- It's Ranger Lambert.</font>

189
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,470
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, with love.</font>

190
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,760
<font color=#ffff00>Well, This is a military base.
You remember how that works..</font>

191
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,620
<font color=#ffff00>Ranger Pentecost.</font>

192
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,999
<font color=#ffff00>- And you must be Amara Namani.
- Yes sir. Ranger, sir.</font>

193
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,610
<font color=#ffff00>Let's get you squared away.</font>

194
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,500
<font color=#ffff00>And and, try not to steal
anything while you're here.</font>

195
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,220
<font color=#ffff00>Did that haircut just call you Pentecost?</font>

196
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,760
<font color=#ffff00>As in 'Bad ass Stacker Pentecost'?</font>

197
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,370
<font color=#ffff00>Pilot of Coyote Tango, hero
of basically the whole world?</font>

198
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,600
<font color=#ffff00>- It's just a name.
- Yeah, really cool name.</font>

199
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,620
<font color=#ffff00>Simtraining starts at 0600. If
you are late, you miss the day.</font>

200
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,690
<font color=#ffff00>You fall behind,
you'll be on the next transport</font>

201
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,519
<font color=#ffff00>back to wherever they found you.</font>

202
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,910
<font color=#ffff00>That's Titan Redeemer.</font>

203
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,100
<font color=#ffff00>And Bracer Phoenix.
She is a 3 man rig.</font>

204
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,659
<font color=#ffff00>Saber Athena. I love Saber Athena.</font>

205
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,879
<font color=#ffff00>She is the fastest in the fleet.
Did you know that?</font>

206
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,560
<font color=#ffff00><i>Warning: stay clear of lift.</i></font>

207
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,160
<font color=#ffff00>Which one is yours?</font>

208
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,000
<font color=#ffff00>Gipsy.</font>

209
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,240
<font color=#ffff00>- You pilot Gipsy Avenger?
- He used to.</font>

210
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,400
<font color=#ffff00>Until his co-pilot got a better
offer in the private sector.</font>

211
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,350
<font color=#ffff00>Jules Reyes, J-Tech.</font>

212
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,540
<font color=#ffff00>Amara, cadet.</font>

213
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,770
<font color=#ffff00>Jake.</font>

214
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,210
<font color=#ffff00>- Ranger, apparently.
- Heard a lot about you, Pentecost.</font>

215
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,770
<font color=#ffff00>- You know you still hold the record.
- What record? Shut up.</font>

216
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,410
<font color=#ffff00>So how did they lure you back?
I mean it couldn't have been the pay.</font>

217
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,209
<font color=#ffff00>Oh yes, it's a long story,
but if you</font>

218
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,130
<font color=#ffff00>if you want to talk about it,
then we can meet up...</font>

219
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,480
<font color=#ffff00>She is busy.</font>

220
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,810
<font color=#ffff00>Eyes front, Pentecost.</font>

221
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,580
<font color=#ffff00>- Come on, Renata, not the face.
- Sorry man.</font>

222
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,830
<font color=#ffff00>I raise you, two shower chips.</font>

223
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,429
<font color=#ffff00>Fold, Ilya. You need all the
showers you can getting there.</font>

224
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,450
<font color=#ffff00>I have musk.
What you smell is musk.</font>

225
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,710
<font color=#ffff00>Ranger on deck.</font>

226
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,530
<font color=#ffff00><i>Audio system deactivated.</i></font>

227
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,870
<font color=#ffff00>Cadets, this is Amara Namani.</font>

228
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,180
<font color=#ffff00>She will be joining you in sim
training right and early.</font>

229
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,460
<font color=#ffff00>And this is ranger Pentecost.
He will be helping me instruct you...</font>

230
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,620
<font color=#ffff00>until I can find a new co-pilot
to replace Ranger Burke.</font>

231
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,300
<font color=#ffff00>Anything you like to add?</font>

232
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,600
<font color=#ffff00>Nothing you want to hear.</font>

233
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,860
<font color=#ffff00>Malikova, get Namani squared
in and prepped for training.</font>

234
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,910
<font color=#ffff00>- Yes sir!
- As you were.</font>

235
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,790
<font color=#ffff00>Pentecost.</font>

236
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,240
<font color=#ffff00>We are gonna be trained by a Pentecost.</font>

237
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,290
<font color=#ffff00>So? Not like he was the one who died
helping close the breach.</font>

238
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,580
<font color=#ffff00>He has never been in an combat.</font>

239
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,580
<font color=#ffff00><i>Renata, ready for round two.</i></font>

240
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,400
<font color=#ffff00><i>Yo. Ilya, do you see this?</i></font>

241
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,060
<font color=#ffff00>- So, where should I...
- Heard you built your own real Jaeger.</font>

242
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,620
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, actually Scrapper.</font>

243
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,530
<font color=#ffff00>I operated her too,
with this solo unit...</font>

244
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:07,110
<font color=#ffff00>If you want to put junk together, be
a mechanic. Moyulan is for pilots.</font>

245
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,190
<font color=#ffff00>- Hey come on. I got you.
- Thanks.</font>

246
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,350
<font color=#ffff00>Jinhai. Ou-yang Jinhai.
So you and Vik, already buddies huh?</font>

247
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,710
<font color=#ffff00>Vik is short for Viktoriya, but
you don't wanna call her that.</font>

248
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,020
<font color=#ffff00>Yo, what's her problem?</font>

249
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,580
<font color=#ffff00>Took her 3 shots to
pass the entrance test.</font>

250
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,370
<font color=#ffff00>Don't think she likes
how you landed here.</font>

251
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,470
<font color=#ffff00>Hey, it's not my fault.</font>

252
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,679
<font color=#ffff00>Recruiters never come
around back home.</font>

253
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,789
<font color=#ffff00>- Hey. Do you know any Russian?
- No.</font>

254
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,920
<font color=#ffff00>I'll teach you something.
Calms her down.</font>

255
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,280
<font color=#ffff00>Come on, let's get you squared away.</font>

256
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,590
<font color=#ffff00><i>Hemispheres out of alignment. Warning.</i></font>

257
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,930
<font color=#ffff00>- We need to reconnect.
- I know! I'm trying!</font>

258
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,970
<font color=#ffff00><i>MAGLEV deactivated.</i></font>

259
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,820
<font color=#ffff00>- I just can't get this.
- That sucked.</font>

260
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,500
<font color=#ffff00><i>Drift simulation terminated.</i></font>

261
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,640
<font color=#ffff00>AMARA FAIL
SURESH FAIL.</font>

262
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,080
<font color=#ffff00>You know, when I heard you gave
November Ajax a run for his money</font>

263
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,960
<font color=#ffff00>I thought we might have something here.
Now I'm not so sure.</font>

264
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,789
<font color=#ffff00>How am I supposed to drift in this thing?</font>

265
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,040
<font color=#ffff00>It smells like feet.</font>

266
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,650
<font color=#ffff00>I didn't ask for excuses, cadet.</font>

267
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,840
<font color=#ffff00>You put her up against Kaiju that
almost killed veteran pilots.</font>

268
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,449
<font color=#ffff00>Doesn't make any sense.</font>

269
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,010
<font color=#ffff00>Well maybe, she is not the only
one who doesn't belong here.</font>

270
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,869
<font color=#ffff00>See Nate, I know you have
a problem with me,</font>

271
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,590
<font color=#ffff00>but come on, she is just a kid.</font>

272
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,060
<font color=#ffff00>So were we. That's the point.</font>

273
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,600
<font color=#ffff00>You make stronger connections
when you are young.</font>

274
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,680
<font color=#ffff00>And that kind up on makes
a better drift pilot.</font>

275
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,340
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, I remember the pitch. Thanks.</font>

276
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,409
<font color=#ffff00>Ryoichi, Renata, you're up.</font>

277
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,930
<font color=#ffff00>Show our new recruit how it's done.</font>

278
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,310
<font color=#ffff00>What the hell are you wearing?</font>

279
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,760
<font color=#ffff00>Jules loves it. Yeah she
told me it's nice to</font>

280
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,890
<font color=#ffff00>finally have someone
with style around here.</font>

281
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,250
<font color=#ffff00>Can't blame the girl.
I am sexy.</font>

282
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,890
<font color=#ffff00>- You want a drink?
- Sure.</font>

283
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,070
<font color=#ffff00>Thanks.</font>

284
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,830
<font color=#ffff00>- Ice cream is up top.
- Yes.</font>

285
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,239
<font color=#ffff00>So one more time around huh?
Prove your old man wrong?</font>

286
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,070
<font color=#ffff00>No, I just came back to see if
your chin implant ever settled in.</font>

287
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,190
<font color=#ffff00>Oh I think it settled
in quite nicely.</font>

288
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,800
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, it's very commanding.
Kids must love it.</font>

289
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,500
<font color=#ffff00>Jake. These kids,
they look upto us.</font>

290
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,710
<font color=#ffff00>We gotta show them that
we can work together.</font>

291
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,009
<font color=#ffff00>Well... The war ended ten years ago.</font>

292
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,010
<font color=#ffff00>You might just need to let that go.
Just whoosha...</font>

293
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,680
<font color=#ffff00>After you understand,
you gotta make your...</font>

294
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,350
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah...</font>

295
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,619
<font color=#ffff00>Sorry me.</font>

296
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,879
<font color=#ffff00>You have to understand
your enemy's objective...</font>

297
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,730
<font color=#ffff00>to know you defeated them.
We still don't.</font>

298
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,020
<font color=#ffff00>No, I can help you out with that.</font>

299
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,970
<font color=#ffff00>See I'm thinking it has
something to do with them</font>

300
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,190
<font color=#ffff00>sending giant monsters to
kick the crap out of us.</font>

301
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,040
<font color=#ffff00>No, the Precursors won't
send Kaiju to flatten a</font>

302
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,846
<font color=#ffff00>few cities if they were
trying to wipe us all out.</font>

303
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,969
<font color=#ffff00>Look, me,
I don't have a problem with you man,</font>

304
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,220
<font color=#ffff00>but I had to make a choice.</font>

305
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,149
<font color=#ffff00>It was between your
pretty face and prison,</font>

306
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,790
<font color=#ffff00>I chose your pretty face.</font>

307
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,969
<font color=#ffff00>Well, I'm touched.</font>

308
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,670
<font color=#ffff00>How many damn
toppings do you need?</font>

309
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,690
<font color=#ffff00>Leave my toppings be man.
Don't mess my damn toppings.</font>

310
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,449
<font color=#ffff00>So the cadets got like what?</font>

311
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,650
<font color=#ffff00>Couple of months
before they graduate?</font>

312
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,280
<font color=#ffff00>- Six.
- OK. I tell you what...</font>

313
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,709
<font color=#ffff00>Every time you want to say
something soldiery to them,</font>

314
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,840
<font color=#ffff00>I'll just nod...</font>

315
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,979
<font color=#ffff00>or like "Yep, what he said".</font>

316
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,100
<font color=#ffff00>Then before you know it,
they get to be pilots.</font>

317
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,370
<font color=#ffff00>- And I get to get back to my life.
- Great!</font>

318
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,790
<font color=#ffff00>You may get sooner what you think.</font>

319
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,110
<font color=#ffff00>- How's come?
- Big dog and pony show tomorrow.</font>

320
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,030
<font color=#ffff00>SHAO and her team are presenting
this new drone program they have.</font>

321
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,210
<font color=#ffff00>- Could make us all obsolete.
- Sounds like my get out of jail free card.</font>

322
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,990
<font color=#ffff00>You know, you confront all you want...</font>

323
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,080
<font color=#ffff00>but you and I both know you
could have been great.</font>

324
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,190
<font color=#ffff00>She doesn't do the
whole handshaking thing.</font>

325
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,419
<font color=#ffff00>Doctor Newton Geiszler,</font>

326
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,780
<font color=#ffff00>head of research and development
for SHAO Industries.</font>

327
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,030
<font color=#ffff00>That's a nice firm grip you got there.</font>

328
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,140
<font color=#ffff00>That's a much better look on you.</font>

329
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,970
<font color=#ffff00>I guess it is better than
prison stripes. Barely.</font>

330
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,570
<font color=#ffff00>I'm sorry? Is this him?</font>

331
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,849
<font color=#ffff00>It's gotta be him. Right?
You're Stacker's kid.</font>

332
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,890
<font color=#ffff00>Hey! I am Newt. I was a
big fan of your fathers.</font>

333
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,639
<font color=#ffff00>Amazing speechwriter by the way.</font>

334
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,110
<font color=#ffff00>Do you ever hear one where
he canceled the apocalypse.</font>

335
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,020
<font color=#ffff00>- Newton.
- Hermann.</font>

336
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,650
<font color=#ffff00>I was hoping you would be tagging along.</font>

337
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,210
<font color=#ffff00>I could use your help in
an experiment I'm working on.</font>

338
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,990
<font color=#ffff00>This will only take a moment.
I know how busy you are.</font>

339
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,669
<font color=#ffff00>I do not want to impose, but...</font>

340
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,659
<font color=#ffff00>Come on. You can't
impose on me. I mean...</font>

341
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,170
<font color=#ffff00>We have been inside
each others heads right?</font>

342
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:01,049
<font color=#ffff00>We saved the world.
We have drifted with a Kaiju.</font>

343
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,889
<font color=#ffff00>You know, if we hadn't yanked that
Intel right of Kaiju's brain</font>

344
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,680
<font color=#ffff00>Raleigh would have never been
able to close the breach.</font>

345
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,120
<font color=#ffff00>That was you and that was me.</font>

346
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,679
<font color=#ffff00>Technically more me, but we can
make this quick, or...</font>

347
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,230
<font color=#ffff00>Deployment.</font>

348
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,740
<font color=#ffff00>Of Jaegers. Their deployment to battle
it takes too much time, you know</font>

349
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,690
<font color=#ffff00>The amount of damage a Kaiju
can inflict before they even...</font>

350
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,040
<font color=#ffff00>Ah here. I think I found a solution.</font>

351
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,270
<font color=#ffff00>You know I can never read
your...</font>

352
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:35,090
<font color=#ffff00>Rocket thrusters? Huh.
Yeah, no.</font>

353
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,870
<font color=#ffff00>There is no fuel in the world with
that kind of boost-to-mass ratio.</font>

354
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,900
<font color=#ffff00>Not from this world.</font>

355
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,510
<font color=#ffff00>- Now.
- Is that Kaiju blood?</font>

356
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,880
<font color=#ffff00>Exactly.</font>

357
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,019
<font color=#ffff00>I've discovered Kaiju
blood is highly reactive</font>

358
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,970
<font color=#ffff00>when it's combined with
rare earth's elements.</font>

359
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,060
<font color=#ffff00>- Cerium, lanthanum, gadolinium.
- I know that.</font>

360
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,069
<font color=#ffff00>You can't be fooling
around with stuff.</font>

361
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,176
<font color=#ffff00>You're gonna blow yourself up.</font>

362
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,820
<font color=#ffff00>No one knows more about Kaiju
morphology than you.</font>

363
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,210
<font color=#ffff00>- If you could just take a look.
- No, Hermann. I gotta stop you.</font>

364
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,990
<font color=#ffff00>Look, none of this matters.
Once my boss's drones</font>

365
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,490
<font color=#ffff00>are approved, deployment time.
This is gonna be a non issue.</font>

366
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,470
<font color=#ffff00>Within a year buddy, we're
gonna have drones everywhere.</font>

367
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,820
<font color=#ffff00>So you won't help me?</font>

368
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,019
<font color=#ffff00>Look, why don't we talk it
over dinner in my place, OK?</font>

369
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,630
<font color=#ffff00>You can finally meet Alice.</font>

370
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,740
<font color=#ffff00>I don't need a hot meal Newt. What I need
is a solution, to a specific problem.</font>

371
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,249
<font color=#ffff00>That's me. Bud,
I'm sorry. Duty calls.</font>

372
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,890
<font color=#ffff00>It's been nice catching up.</font>

373
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,080
<font color=#ffff00>Newton.</font>

374
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:44,120
<font color=#ffff00>I still get nightmares
about what we saw</font>

375
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,130
<font color=#ffff00>when we drifted with that
disgusting Kaiju brain.</font>

376
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:54,260
<font color=#ffff00>But it was hell of rush, wasn't it?</font>

377
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,950
<font color=#ffff00>I know, I'm terrible.
Yes, we shared a lab together.</font>

378
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,520
<font color=#ffff00>Oh some crazy idea about
thruster pods on a Jaeger.</font>

379
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,090
<font color=#ffff00>The man is completely harmless.</font>

380
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:39,620
<font color=#ffff00>Could you say that again, and this
time about 80 percent slower?</font>

381
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,890
<font color=#ffff00>I said, don't make me question
your loyalty. Understand?</font>

382
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,020
<font color=#ffff00>What's to question?</font>

383
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,620
<font color=#ffff00>Look I barely talk to that guy anyway.</font>

384
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,860
<font color=#ffff00>My drones are the next
step in Jaeger evolution.</font>

385
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,859
<font color=#ffff00>The system I designed process its commands</font>

386
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,780
<font color=#ffff00>through a quantum data core.</font>

387
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,720
<font color=#ffff00>This means that a single pilot can
operate the drone remotely...</font>

388
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,460
<font color=#ffff00>from anywhere in the world.</font>

389
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,910
<font color=#ffff00>As soon as the council
approves the deployment,</font>

390
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,870
<font color=#ffff00>based on Secretary General
Mori's final report...</font>

391
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,890
<font color=#ffff00>the days of struggling
to find and train drift</font>

392
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,960
<font color=#ffff00>compatible pilots will
be a thing of the past.</font>

393
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,609
<font color=#ffff00>And you think a bunch of
desk jockeys are better than us?</font>

394
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,760
<font color=#ffff00>We are not here to shut you down.</font>

395
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,360
<font color=#ffff00>Cooperation between our programs
has never been more vital.</font>

396
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,230
<font color=#ffff00>- If there are any questions?
- Yeah, I got a question.</font>

397
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,849
<font color=#ffff00>We are pilots, not a
bunch of office workers.</font>

398
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,250
<font color=#ffff00>And now we're shouting.
There is no need to shout.</font>

399
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,779
<font color=#ffff00>That was slick.</font>

400
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,360
<font color=#ffff00>So how long till they order
the shutdown so I can go home.</font>

401
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,960
<font color=#ffff00>I don't trust that tech.
Not yet at least.</font>

402
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,040
<font color=#ffff00>Oh. It looked
pretty good to me.</font>

403
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,830
<font color=#ffff00>Remote systems can be
hacked or compromised.</font>

404
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,279
<font color=#ffff00>You got the key vote right?</font>

405
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,080
<font color=#ffff00>So there you go,
it's your decision.</font>

406
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,050
<font color=#ffff00>I wish I could just
go ahead and approve them.</font>

407
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:14,470
<font color=#ffff00>Nearly half the counsel is backing Liwen.</font>

408
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,110
<font color=#ffff00>They aren't going to like my decision.</font>

409
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,329
<font color=#ffff00>Who cares what they like,</font>

410
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,850
<font color=#ffff00>and what they don't like?</font>

411
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,190
<font color=#ffff00>I tell you what?
I'm gonna go with you.</font>

412
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,560
<font color=#ffff00>For moral support. Plus I
wanna get out of this place.</font>

413
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,650
<font color=#ffff00>I'm glad you offered,
because I already requested</font>

414
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:33,509
<font color=#ffff00>Gipsy Avenger as honor guard
at the counsel summit.</font>

415
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,180
<font color=#ffff00>You know Gipsy is Nate's right.</font>

416
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,669
<font color=#ffff00>His co-pilot works for Liwen now.
He needs a new one.</font>

417
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,220
<font color=#ffff00>One that you already know
is drift compatible.</font>

418
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,750
<font color=#ffff00>Alright, I'll do it.
I've got your back.</font>

419
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,720
<font color=#ffff00>But I wanna be there when
you tell Nate, cause I</font>

420
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,870
<font color=#ffff00>just want to see his face.
He's gonna be so pissed.</font>

00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,320
<font color=#ffff00>Hey honey, I'm home.</font>

565
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:34,790
<font color=#ffff00>Sorry I'm late. Things were...</font>

566
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,700
<font color=#ffff00>Things were crazy today, with
what happened in Sydney.</font>

567
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,230
<font color=#ffff00>All those people.
It was not pretty.</font>

568
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,130
<font color=#ffff00>My boss almost got killed.
That could have been bad.</font>

569
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,110
<font color=#ffff00>Maybe I guess. I don't know.</font>

570
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,950
<font color=#ffff00>That would have been great
actually, that one is</font>

571
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,810
<font color=#ffff00>all over me. I mean I can't
get a break from her.</font>

572
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:56,210
<font color=#ffff00>I am ranting. Enough
about work and enough</font>

573
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,830
<font color=#ffff00>about her. Really I
should be focused on you.</font>

574
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,399
<font color=#ffff00>How about we have a little
fun in the bedroom?</font>

575
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,710
<font color=#ffff00>How was your day?</font>

576
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,689
<font color=#ffff00>Oh that's great.</font>

577
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,640
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah that's exciting.
What's that?</font>

578
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,420
<font color=#ffff00>A little pick-me-up?</font>

579
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:22,360
<font color=#ffff00>What can I say?
You are right by mine.</font>

580
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,680
<font color=#ffff00>They are calling it Obsidian Fury.
He's never been a rogue like this.</font>

581
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:38,369
<font color=#ffff00>News feeds they are posting
a dozen Jaegers at the memorial.</font>

582
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:40,399
<font color=#ffff00>When I die, I want
that many send me off.</font>

583
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,429
<font color=#ffff00>Your pops gonna make you work
with boobs when you wash out.</font>

584
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,220
<font color=#ffff00>Jaegers do not show up
when the boob guy does.</font>

585
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,649
<font color=#ffff00>- Your dad works with boobs?
- He is a plastic surgeon.</font>

586
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,220
<font color=#ffff00>He does not just work with...</font>

587
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,860
<font color=#ffff00>I'm not gonna wash out.
I'm gonna be a pilot.</font>

588
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:55,720
<font color=#ffff00>Still, you die, man, they post
one Jaeger on your funeral.</font>

589
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,680
<font color=#ffff00>Maybe half a Jaeger.</font>

590
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:01,379
<font color=#ffff00>I heard this is where they found Amara</font>

591
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,599
<font color=#ffff00>in half a Jaeger.</font>

592
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,150
<font color=#ffff00>It was a whole Jaeger.</font>

593
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:09,350
<font color=#ffff00>It just wasn't very big, Viktoriya.</font>

594
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,950
<font color=#ffff00>Bigger is better.</font>

595
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:20,960
<font color=#ffff00>- Kiss my ass.
- What did you say?</font>

596
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:24,220
<font color=#ffff00>Kiss my ass.
Am I saying that right?</font>

597
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,739
<font color=#ffff00>I have worked everyday in my
life to be here. You didn't do</font>

598
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,230
<font color=#ffff00>anything. You are just picked
up from street like garbage.</font>

599
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,550
<font color=#ffff00>Do you know where I learned that?</font>

600
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,800
<font color=#ffff00>- On the street, you bitch...
- Ranger on deck.</font>

601
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,569
<font color=#ffff00>- She jumped me.
- She does not belong here.</font>

602
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:48,890
<font color=#ffff00>I don't care.</font>

603
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,480
<font color=#ffff00>When I first joined the
Corps, I was like you.</font>

604
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,760
<font color=#ffff00>Worse, I was nobody.</font>

605
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:05,430
<font color=#ffff00>But that woman we lay to rest today, Mako
Mori, she said, "Whoever you are..."</font>

606
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,660
<font color=#ffff00>"the minute you enter this
program, you join a family."</font>

607
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,810
<font color=#ffff00>"And no matter what they do, no matter
how stupid they may act sometimes..."</font>

608
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,980
<font color=#ffff00>"you forgive them and you move on."</font>

609
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,960
<font color=#ffff00>So you start believing in that, in here.</font>

610
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,490
<font color=#ffff00>Then you will start
believing it in a Jaeger.</font>

611
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:31,459
<font color=#ffff00>The marshal is looking for you guys.</font>

612
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,170
<font color=#ffff00>Says Gottlieb has found something.</font>

613
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,280
<font color=#ffff00>It isn't something,
it's somewhere.</font>

614
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:42,540
<font color=#ffff00>Severnaya Zemlya,
of Siberia's tiny peninsula.</font>

615
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,440
<font color=#ffff00>- What is in Zemlya?
- Nothing anymore.</font>

616
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,650
<font color=#ffff00>A facility roughly in this location was
used to manufacture Jaeger power core...</font>

617
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,879
<font color=#ffff00>during war
but it was decommissioned years ago.</font>

618
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,520
<font color=#ffff00>Why would Mako be trying
to tell us about an</font>

619
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:56,810
<font color=#ffff00>abandoned factory in
the middle of nowhere?</font>

620
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:02,110
<font color=#ffff00>Sir, a mission to take Gipsy avenger
to see what the hell is out there.</font>

621
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,940
<font color=#ffff00><b>SEVERNAYA ZEMLYA SIBERIA</b></font>

622
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,779
<font color=#ffff00><i>Scanning.</i></font>

623
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,219
<font color=#ffff00>Looks like Mako's message was a dead end.</font>

624
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,170
<font color=#ffff00>This place is abandoned.</font>

625
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,830
<font color=#ffff00>Wait a second.</font>

626
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:46,310
<font color=#ffff00>- Getting some weird readings.
- Incoming.</font>

627
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:03,760
<font color=#ffff00>Take out his legs.</font>

628
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,950
<font color=#ffff00>We gotta get out of here.</font>

629
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,540
<font color=#ffff00>Plasma canon.</font>

630
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:29,510
<font color=#ffff00>- I think we've pissed him off.
- Good.</font>

631
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,270
<font color=#ffff00>- You remember our old move?
- Hell yeah.</font>

632
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,110
<font color=#ffff00>- He looks hurt.
- Go for his power core.</font>

633
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,740
<font color=#ffff00><i>Warning.</i></font>

634
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:47,450
<font color=#ffff00>Pilots of Obsidian Fury,
Get the hell out of your comm-pod.</font>

635
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,230
<font color=#ffff00>What the hell is that?</font>

636
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:09,939
<font color=#ffff00>It's definitely Kaiju.</font>

637
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,029
<font color=#ffff00>A secondary brain used to
control the hind quarters.</font>

638
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,160
<font color=#ffff00>- How do they get into our world?
- There hasn't been a breach in 10 years.</font>

639
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,079
<font color=#ffff00>The sensors would have pick that up.</font>

640
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,820
<font color=#ffff00>I don't think there was a breach.</font>

641
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:24,340
<font color=#ffff00>Kaiju flesh has a distinct radioactive
signature particularly to the anti-verse.</font>

642
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:27,289
<font color=#ffff00>This specimen does not.</font>

643
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:30,680
<font color=#ffff00>So... You saying that
it's from our universe.</font>

644
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:34,850
<font color=#ffff00>The genetic fingerprints indicate
terrestrial modification techniques...</font>

645
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:38,469
<font color=#ffff00>probably engineered from Kaiju
flesh left over from the war.</font>

646
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:40,910
<font color=#ffff00>Precursors didn't do this...</font>

647
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:44,330
<font color=#ffff00>Humans did.</font>

648
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:53,289
<font color=#ffff00>That punk of slimy crap
was piloting obsidian fury?</font>

649
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,480
<font color=#ffff00>We gotta get a look inside.</font>

650
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,690
<font color=#ffff00>- Inside?
- That thing is part Kaiju.</font>

651
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,299
<font color=#ffff00>Come on guys.</font>

652
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,070
<font color=#ffff00>When are we ever gonna get a chance
to see something like this again?</font>

653
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,910
<font color=#ffff00>Never, never would be good.</font>

654
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:09,300
<font color=#ffff00>- You guys can stay here, I am going.
- No I'm not. Amara!</font>

655
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,950
<font color=#ffff00>Guys, we should not be in here.</font>

656
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,300
<font color=#ffff00>It's fused all the way to the system.</font>

657
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,690
<font color=#ffff00>Like muscle tissue.</font>

658
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,650
<font color=#ffff00>That's how it was able
to move like. Cool.</font>

659
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,250
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah cool.</font>

660
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:37,810
<font color=#ffff00>Working with boobs are
sounding better and better.</font>

661
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:39,770
<font color=#ffff00>You shine the light over here.</font>

662
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:45,470
<font color=#ffff00>Yes, just pull on the
guts of that weird Kaiju.</font>

663
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,530
<font color=#ffff00>- What is it?
- I think it's some kind of...</font>

664
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,960
<font color=#ffff00>- I told you not to...
- Go get help.</font>

665
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,890
<font color=#ffff00>We are so screwed.</font>

666
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,430
<font color=#ffff00><i>The security takes over.
We are done.</i></font>

667
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,489
<font color=#ffff00>Is Jinhai OK?</font>

668
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,510
<font color=#ffff00>He's got some scar,
but yeah, he'll live.</font>

669
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,580
<font color=#ffff00>The Marshal plan on probation,
Meilin and Suresh too.</font>

670
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,770
<font color=#ffff00>- They bleak wrong, all of them are out.
- No it's not their fault.</font>

671
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:23,250
<font color=#ffff00>- I talked them into...
- Sorry, I talked to the marshal, but</font>

672
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:25,750
<font color=#ffff00>you are dismissed from the program.</font>

673
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:30,320
<font color=#ffff00>- Never belonged to here anyway.
- Really?</font>

674
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,650
<font color=#ffff00>I used to say the same
thing a long time ago.</font>

675
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,109
<font color=#ffff00>Still don't.</font>

676
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:45,570
<font color=#ffff00>- Why did you sign up?
- We were at war.</font>

677
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,169
<font color=#ffff00>My dad was leading the charge
and I thought</font>

678
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,040
<font color=#ffff00>maybe I could see more of him.</font>

679
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,710
<font color=#ffff00>Maybe even drift with him.</font>

680
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,690
<font color=#ffff00>One night me and Nate got into it.</font>

681
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,640
<font color=#ffff00>It was over something stupid. I can't
even remember what.</font>

682
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,519
<font color=#ffff00>So, I climbed in an old Mark 4</font>

683
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,709
<font color=#ffff00>just to show him,
I didn't him to be a great pilot.</font>

684
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:07,559
<font color=#ffff00>- That is pretty dumb.
- Yeah.</font>

685
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,880
<font color=#ffff00>How far did you get?</font>

686
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,100
<font color=#ffff00>- Seven steps take or leave.
- How far did you get?</font>

687
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:15,050
<font color=#ffff00>About 2 steps. And I blacked
out from the strain.</font>

688
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,800
<font color=#ffff00>And the first thing I saw when
I woke up, was my dad.</font>

689
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,670
<font color=#ffff00>He's standing right in front
of me looking stunned.</font>

690
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,000
<font color=#ffff00>What did he say?</font>

691
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,940
<font color=#ffff00>He said that I was out of the
program, he said I didn't</font>

692
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:27,710
<font color=#ffff00>deserve to be in a Jaeger.
Look he said a lot of things.</font>

693
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:33,470
<font color=#ffff00>A year later, my dad was gone.</font>

694
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,130
<font color=#ffff00>I didn't get a chance to prove him wrong.</font>

695
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:39,830
<font color=#ffff00>And more importantly, I could not
get a chance to prove it to myself.</font>

696
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,150
<font color=#ffff00>You listen to me.</font>

697
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:46,030
<font color=#ffff00>Don't let what other people
think of you define who you are.</font>

698
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,400
<font color=#ffff00>You won't like where that takes you.</font>

699
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,140
<font color=#ffff00>Do you understand?</font>

700
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,479
<font color=#ffff00>And keep your head up,</font>

701
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,710
<font color=#ffff00>then you might just be as</font>

702
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:01,020
<font color=#ffff00>good looking as me in
this type of situation.</font>

703
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,149
<font color=#ffff00>This face is set up well.</font>

704
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:05,720
<font color=#ffff00>Beauty is a burden.</font>

705
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,870
<font color=#ffff00>You will be alright.</font>

706
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:17,110
<font color=#ffff00>SHAO Industries.</font>

707
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,710
<font color=#ffff00>What?</font>

708
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:23,849
<font color=#ffff00>Obsidian Fury has tech in it
made by SHAO Industries.</font>

709
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,269
<font color=#ffff00>That's impossible.</font>

710
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,396
<font color=#ffff00>Jules and her team scanned every
centimeter of that Jaeger.</font>

711
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,520
<font color=#ffff00>Insulating meta-materials wound
counterclockwise in the shunt cabling.</font>

712
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:35,269
<font color=#ffff00>SHAO is the only company
that winds in that way.</font>

713
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:38,360
<font color=#ffff00>Amara, are you sure about what
you're telling me right now?</font>

714
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:43,280
<font color=#ffff00>I stole a ton to make scrapper.</font>

715
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,220
<font color=#ffff00>I thought it might be important.</font>

716
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,040
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah. Thank you.</font>

717
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,080
<font color=#ffff00>SHAO Industries.</font>

718
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:57,360
<font color=#ffff00>- They don't even have a bio division.
- Not that we know of.</font>

719
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,650
<font color=#ffff00>The cabling could have been
stolen, just like in Amara's</font>

720
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,659
<font color=#ffff00>Jaeger. We're gonna need more
than that to connect it to SHAO.</font>

721
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:03,760
<font color=#ffff00>What about Newt?</font>

722
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,350
<font color=#ffff00>He'd have access to internal
records and shipping manifests.</font>

723
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:09,770
<font color=#ffff00>Alright. Go see him,
keep a low profile.</font>

724
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,790
<font color=#ffff00>I have a mission? Finally.</font>

725
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,890
<font color=#ffff00>We will take over
Newt to the Marshal.</font>

726
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:18,990
<font color=#ffff00><b>SHAO INDUSTRIES.</b></font>

727
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:49,730
<font color=#ffff00>This isn't fair.</font>

728
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:56,050
<font color=#ffff00>I'm sorry. You don't deserve this.</font>

729
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:58,760
<font color=#ffff00>It was my fault.</font>

730
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,200
<font color=#ffff00>This is on me.</font>

731
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,670
<font color=#ffff00>Amara.</font>

732
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,500
<font color=#ffff00>The next Jaeger you build,</font>

733
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,540
<font color=#ffff00>make it a big one.</font>

736
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,959
<font color=#ffff00>A 100%. That's the way
that it's done. OK?</font>

737
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,930
<font color=#ffff00>I told you we could do it and we did it.</font>

738
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:47,619

- I losing up link to drone 375.</font>

739
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,739
<font color=#ffff00>Why? Figure out why.</font>

740
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:54,900
<font color=#ffff00>We will take what we know to the
council in person. Prepare transport.</font>

741
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,860
<font color=#ffff00>Give me a second.</font>

742
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,980
<font color=#ffff00>Get to Gipsy. Go!</font>

743
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:27,160
<font color=#ffff00>All pilots, man your Jaegers
and engage the hostiles.</font>

744
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:46,800
<font color=#ffff00>You can do it. You cool?
Yeah, super cool. Just stay calm.</font>

745
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,980
<font color=#ffff00>I know. I'm heading up.
On my way.</font>

746
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,610
<font color=#ffff00>Hermann, what are you doing here?
How did you get in?</font>

747
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:57,359
<font color=#ffff00>I do have PPDC credentials, and besides
everyone else seemed to be little</font>

748
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:00,320
<font color=#ffff00>bit preocupied occupied with the
killer drones your boss just set off.</font>

749
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:31,449
<font color=#ffff00>- She used you.
- No.</font>

750
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,769
<font color=#ffff00>She lured you with
money and a fancy title.</font>

751
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,739
<font color=#ffff00>And while you were
basking in the glow,</font>

752
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,850
<font color=#ffff00>she took your research
and she twisted it.</font>

753
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,859
<font color=#ffff00>Help me stop her, Newton.</font>

754
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,339
<font color=#ffff00>Help me save the world, like old times.</font>

755
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,340
<font color=#ffff00>Sorry, technically you
helped me last time.</font>

756
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:45,859
<font color=#ffff00>Let's get that straight.</font>

757
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,710
<font color=#ffff00>Fine. Help me help you save the world.
What do you say?</font>

758
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,810
<font color=#ffff00>I say... I say. Don't shoot!</font>

759
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:57,080
<font color=#ffff00>Damn it, why can't
I get this language?</font>

760
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,650
<font color=#ffff00>What is happening?</font>

761
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:04,679
<font color=#ffff00>- Are those Jaegers?
- No they are Drones of SHAO Industries.</font>

762
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,240
<font color=#ffff00>- What are they doing?
- I don't know. They just went crazy.</font>

763
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,120
<font color=#ffff00>Get back to your quarters right now.</font>

764
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,050
<font color=#ffff00>Yes sir.
Go, go, go!</font>

765
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:24,970
<font color=#ffff00>- Get the hell out of here.
- Come on, get up.</font>

766
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,110
<font color=#ffff00>Really? Now?</font>

767
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,410
<font color=#ffff00>- Come on hurry!
- Little help, Hermann?</font>

768
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:02,930
<font color=#ffff00>Learn how to use a gun.</font>

769
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,960
<font color=#ffff00>Thank you, Newton.</font>

770
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:15,680
<font color=#ffff00>You're done grabbing me,
let's take care of the drones right?</font>

771
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:21,670
<font color=#ffff00>Everyone get out of the
lab, or I'll shoot you.</font>

772
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,660
<font color=#ffff00>I'll shoot you twice.</font>

773
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,400
<font color=#ffff00>You are officially fired.
Get out.</font>

774
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:29,069
<font color=#ffff00>- What do we do? How do we stop this?
- There is a back door Hermaan.</font>

775
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:31,360
<font color=#ffff00>- To what?
- To the drone sub routine.</font>

776
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:33,540
<font color=#ffff00>I added a sub routine
just in case I wanna</font>

777
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:35,480
<font color=#ffff00>get in here and poke
around down the road.</font>

791
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:53,310
<font color=#ffff00>Why would I do this?</font>

792
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:58,590
<font color=#ffff00>Well, I guess I want it.
Normally, it's not really my style.</font>

793
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:01,789
<font color=#ffff00>I don't know. Maybe I
hate you over treating</font>

794
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:03,720

little joke of a man.</font>

795
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:07,810
<font color=#ffff00>Maybe that's why he
did it, Hermann. I did it.</font>

796
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:11,640
<font color=#ffff00>That's it. There you go.
There is the problem.</font>

totally myself these days.</font>

800
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:32,330
<font color=#ffff00>Very good, Hermann.
You figured it out.</font>

801
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,230
<font color=#ffff00>And as usual a step behind.</font>

802
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:37,949
<font color=#ffff00>Newton, you are a good man.
You must stop.</font>

803
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:39,850
<font color=#ffff00>- Hermann.
- You must stop it.</font>

804
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:43,990
<font color=#ffff00>- Please, you must fight back, Newton.
- I am not strong enough.</font>

805
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:49,550
<font color=#ffff00>He is not strong enough.
None of you is strong enough.</font>

806
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,640
<font color=#ffff00>I'm sorry, Hermann.</font>

807
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,170
<font color=#ffff00>They are in my head.</font>

808
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:05,310
<font color=#ffff00>Oh hey, boss.</font>

809
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:22,599
<font color=#ffff00>What the hell are you doing here?
I told you to get to quarters.</font>

810
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,560
<font color=#ffff00>- All the doors are blocked.
- What do we do?</font>

811
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:31,280
<font color=#ffff00>I mean 38% of your company
is fully automated.</font>

812
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:34,610
<font color=#ffff00>It really wasn't very hard to
re allocate a little over here</font>

813
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:36,469
<font color=#ffff00>and a little over there.</font>

814
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:38,950
<font color=#ffff00>And slipping a little Kaiju
surprise without you noticing.</font>

815
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,660
<font color=#ffff00>Stop. Wait. Newt has
no control over himself.</font>

816
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,639
<font color=#ffff00>It isn't him. It's the precursors.
They must have</font>

817
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,410
<font color=#ffff00>infected his mind when we
drifted with the Kaiju. Shut up.</font>

818
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,070
<font color=#ffff00>Stay here. We are gonna
try and get to Gipsy.</font>

819
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,640
<font color=#ffff00>- Are you ready for this?
- No you?</font>

820
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:13,210
<font color=#ffff00>- On three. One two...
- Hello anyone there?</font>

821
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:16,530
<font color=#ffff00>- Gottlieb?
- Jake, thank god.</font>

822
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:19,350
<font color=#ffff00>We are under attack.</font>

823
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:22,450
<font color=#ffff00>It isn't her, it isn't Liwen.
It was Newt.</font>

824
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,190
<font color=#ffff00>The precursors. They infected him.
They are controlling his mind.</font>

825
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,899
<font color=#ffff00>Gottlieb,
can you get him to disable the drones?</font>

826
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,210
<font color=#ffff00>No, he got away.</font>

827
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:36,840
<font color=#ffff00>Gottlieb, shut them down.</font>

828
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:43,250
<font color=#ffff00>- It is trying to lock you out.
- Feedback loop.</font>

829
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:55,390
<font color=#ffff00>What the hell is going on, Gottlieb?</font>

830
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:18,010
<font color=#ffff00>Gottlieb, Shut them down,
or we're gonna die.</font>

831
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,290
<font color=#ffff00>Shut them down.</font>

832
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:04,629
<font color=#ffff00>Liwen has disabled the drones.
The breaches are closed.</font>

833
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:07,200
<font color=#ffff00>I repeat the breaches are closed.</font>

834
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:12,970
<font color=#ffff00>- Oh no.
- Oh no, what?</font>

835
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,819
<font color=#ffff00>Three Kaijus have gotten through.</font>

836
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:19,050
<font color=#ffff00>South Korea, Russian coast
and the East China Sea.</font>

837
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:22,860
<font color=#ffff00>- Two Cat fours and a Cat 5.
- Copy that.</font>

838
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:26,860
<font color=#ffff00>Get back to the dome.
We need all the help we can get.</font>

839
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:32,810
<font color=#ffff00>- You guys okay?
- Yes Ma'am.</font>

840
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,639
<font color=#ffff00>What do we got?</font>

841
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,796
<font color=#ffff00>The reports are still coming in</font>

842
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:45,300
<font color=#ffff00>but the drones attacked Jaegers
in SHATTERDOME across the rim.</font>

843
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:47,020
<font color=#ffff00>Alright! How many
Jaegers do we have here?</font>

844
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,730
<font color=#ffff00>Operational? Gipsy avenger, barely.</font>

845
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,049
<font color=#ffff00>That's it?
- Yeah.</font>

846
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,780
<font color=#ffff00>We need more Jaegers up and running
or this is gonna be a short fight.</font>

847
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,830
<font color=#ffff00>Even if we can, all of our pilots
are dead or severely injured.</font>

848
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,600
<font color=#ffff00>One disaster at a time. Let's
just focus on those Jaegers.</font>

849
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:02,490
<font color=#ffff00>Namani. Come over here.</font>

850
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:09,380
<font color=#ffff00>I need you to help Jules with
the repairs. Can you do that?</font>

851
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:10,530
<font color=#ffff00>Said I was kicked out.</font>

852
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,670
<font color=#ffff00>I'm kicking you back in.</font>

853
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:16,790
<font color=#ffff00>She's pretty good at turning junk
into Jaegers. You good with that?</font>

854
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,060
<font color=#ffff00>Hell yeah.</font>

855
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,910
<font color=#ffff00>Right we got a lot work to do.
And not a lot of time.</font>

856
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,380
<font color=#ffff00>We got incoming.</font>

857
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:52,670
<font color=#ffff00>I brought some help.</font>

858
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:01,570
<font color=#ffff00>Hakuja, Shrikethorn and
the big fellow... Raijin.</font>

859
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,749
<font color=#ffff00>I took the liberty of
assigning the designations.</font>

860
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,550
<font color=#ffff00>Well the spiky guy and the
big idiot are moving away</font>

861
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,300
<font color=#ffff00>from the cities towards the ocean.
What does that mean?</font>

862
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:13,309
<font color=#ffff00>Maybe they are trying to link up
with Hakuja in the East China Sea.</font>

863
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:15,719
<font color=#ffff00>I bet Newt would know
what they are up to.</font>

864
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,140
<font color=#ffff00>If we can get it out of him.</font>

865
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,760
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah but we have to find him first.</font>

866
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,280
<font color=#ffff00>Any Jaegers closer to
those Kaijus than us?</font>

867
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,610
<font color=#ffff00>What was left of the
Chin-do and Sakhalinsk</font>

868
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,050
<font color=#ffff00>drones tried to intercept.
Emphasis on tried.</font>

869
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:31,329
<font color=#ffff00>- I am afraid we are all alone.
- There is gotta be something here...</font>

870
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:33,530
<font color=#ffff00>Something in the East China Sea.</font>

871
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:36,819
<font color=#ffff00>Maybe that's not
where they are headed.</font>

872
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:38,760
<font color=#ffff00>Pull up a map of Kaiju
movement from the war.</font>

873
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:43,060
<font color=#ffff00>- Pushing data to main display.
- Well you know something we don't?</font>

874
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,439
<font color=#ffff00>You said we need to understand
our enemy's objective,</font>

875
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,140
<font color=#ffff00>to know we've beaten them.</font>

876
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:52,069
<font color=#ffff00>What if the Kaiju weren't blindly
attacking our city during the war?</font>

877
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,760
<font color=#ffff00>What if we were just in their way?</font>

878
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,299
<font color=#ffff00>Right here.
Mount Fuji, Japan.</font>

879
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:04,110
<font color=#ffff00>Extrapolate for Hakuja,
Shrikethorn and Raijin.</font>

880
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:13,020
<font color=#ffff00>- Mount Fuji? But why?
- Rare earth elements.</font>

881
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,790
<font color=#ffff00>Mount Fuji is a volcano rich
in rare earth elements.</font>

882
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:21,319
<font color=#ffff00>Kaiju blood reacts extremely
violently with rare earth</font>

883
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,990
<font color=#ffff00>elements is the basis of my
fuel thruster experiment.</font>

884
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:26,660
<font color=#ffff00>- That sounds bad. That's bad, right?
- Very.</font>

885
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:29,720
<font color=#ffff00>Mount Fuji is active. A
geological pressure point.</font>

886
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:32,119
<font color=#ffff00>Based on their blood
to mass ratio, the</font>

887
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,520
<font color=#ffff00>Kaiju reaction would
cause a cascade event.</font>

888
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:38,300
<font color=#ffff00>Igniting the Ring of
Fire around the Pacific Rim.</font>

889
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:43,690
<font color=#ffff00>Billions of tons of toxic gas
and ash will spill into the atmosphere...</font>

890
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:45,700
<font color=#ffff00>wiping out all life.</font>

891
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:49,750
<font color=#ffff00>And finish terraforming the earth
for the Precursors.</font>

892
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,429
<font color=#ffff00>We can't let them
reach Mount Fuji.</font>

893
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:53,599
<font color=#ffff00>I'm gonna check with Jules
for the Jaeger repairs.</font>

894
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,340
<font color=#ffff00>Even if we had a hundred Jaegers,
there is no way to intercept in time.</font>

895
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:00,830
<font color=#ffff00>- What bout your thruster pods?
- No no no. They are not ready.</font>

896
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,439
<font color=#ffff00>Can they be?</font>

897
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:05,620
<font color=#ffff00>Well in theory. Maybe with your help.</font>

898
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,480
<font color=#ffff00>Gottlieb, what does that mean
'in theory'?</font>

899
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:14,950
<font color=#ffff00>Today...
it means 'yes'.</font>

900
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,610
<font color=#ffff00><i>Power partially restored in sector 2.</i></font>

901
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:03,829
<font color=#ffff00>Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo
and Bracer Phoenix are good to go.</font>

902
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:05,359
<font color=#ffff00>Not a lot to work with.</font>

903
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,270
<font color=#ffff00>Liwen keep passing fury-tech
in Gipsy that might help.</font>

904
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:13,610
<font color=#ffff00>- Prep everything we got for deployment.
- OK. Don't get yourself killed.</font>

905
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,820
<font color=#ffff00>You either.</font>

906
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,140
<font color=#ffff00>Well that's confusing.</font>

907
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,730
<font color=#ffff00>Let's just stay focused.</font>

908
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:33,229
<font color=#ffff00>We got four Jaegers against
two Category-4s and a five.</font>

909
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:34,689
<font color=#ffff00>It's better than just Gipsy.</font>

910
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:37,990
<font color=#ffff00>- We still need pilots.
- We have them.</font>

911
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:59,650
<font color=#ffff00>If my dad was here,
he would probably give you a big speech,</font>

912
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,370
<font color=#ffff00>make you feel invincible.</font>

913
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:07,249
<font color=#ffff00>I am not my father.</font>

914
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:10,280
<font color=#ffff00>I am not a hero like he was.</font>

915
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,199
<font color=#ffff00>Like Raleigh Becket</font>

916
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,570
<font color=#ffff00>and Mako Mori.</font>

917
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:18,770
<font color=#ffff00>But they didn't start out that way.</font>

918
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:23,000
<font color=#ffff00>They started out as cadets,
just like you.</font>

919
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:26,179
<font color=#ffff00>We remember them as giants
because they stood tall</font>

920
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,920
<font color=#ffff00>because they stood together.</font>

921
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:32,170
<font color=#ffff00>It does not matter who your
parents are, where you</font>

922
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:35,239
<font color=#ffff00>came from who believed
in you and who didn't.</font>

923
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,529
<font color=#ffff00>We are a family now, and we
are earth's last defense.</font>

924
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:43,550
<font color=#ffff00>This is our time. This is our
chance to make a difference.</font>

925
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:47,989
<font color=#ffff00>Now let's mount up and get
it done, do you understand?</font>

926
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:49,279
<font color=#ffff00>Yes sir.</font>

927
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,829
<font color=#ffff00>- Jaeger pilots, do you understand?
- Yes sir.</font>

928
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:55,039
<font color=#ffff00>- Do you understood?
- Yes sir.</font>

929
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,170
<font color=#ffff00>Then help me save the world.</font>

930
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:58,720
<font color=#ffff00>Let's do this.</font>

931
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:06,130
<font color=#ffff00><i>- System online.</i>
- Initiating neural handshake.</font>

932
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:10,460
<font color=#ffff00><i>- Establishing neural link.
- Amara, jump in there.</i></font>

933
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:15,299
<font color=#ffff00>Neural handshake strong and steady.</font>

934
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,990
<font color=#ffff00>So... How does it feel
to be in a real Jaeger?</font>

935
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:21,919
<font color=#ffff00>Bigger is not bad.</font>

936
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,680
<font color=#ffff00>All Jaegers, sound up.
Go and go for launch.</font>

937
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,789
<font color=#ffff00>- Guardian Bravo, go.
- Saber Athena, go.</font>

938
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:32,520
<font color=#ffff00>- Bracer Phoenix, let's go already.
- Copy that.</font>

939
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:38,300
<font color=#ffff00>- Command, we are go for launch.
- Roger, Gipsy Avenger.</font>

946
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:39,299

947
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,370
<font color=#ffff00>My grandmother used to play it for me.</font>

948
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,179
<font color=#ffff00>Keeps me calm.</font>

949
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:45,710
<font color=#ffff00>What about me?
I am not calm, man.</font>

950
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:00,150

956
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,669
<font color=#ffff00>Bracer Phoenix, on me.
We'll take Raijin.</font>

957

<font color=#ffff00>Roger that, Gipsy.</font>

958
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,050

Bravo, you take the other two.</font>

959
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,210
<font color=#ffff00>Copy that. It's our
turn to save the world.</font>

960
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:40,130
<font color=#ffff00>- Let's hope so.
- On my mark. Three, two, one, mark.</font>

energy back at you.</font>

964
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:50,410
<font color=#ffff00>Let's see it absorb this.</font>

965
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,740
<font color=#ffff00>How many buildings
can this thing take?</font>

966

<font color=#ffff00>Shrikethorn inbound.</font>

967
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,070

of the help over here.</font>

968
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,880
<font color=#ffff00>- Right Now.
- Copy that, Saber.</font>

969
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:42,330
<font color=#ffff00>- Vik, take out Shrikethorn.
- On it.</font>

<font color=#ffff00>Yeah. That's nice.
You better run.</font>

972
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:22,610
<font color=#ffff00>These things ain't that tough.</font>

973
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:36,050
<font color=#ffff00>Bracer Phoenix, watch your six.
Hostiles inbound.</font>

974

<font color=#ffff00>Copy that.</font>

975
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,680
<font color=#ffff00>OK. Giant robots again. Alright.</font>

976
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:00,960

- All Jaegers, brace for contact.</font>

983
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,260

Go, go, go. Go baby.</font>

985
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:55,740
<font color=#ffff00>Where are they going?</font>

986
01:24:52,190 --> 01:24:53,820
<font color=#ffff00>Well. He's pretty big.</font>

987

fire everything you got. On my command.</font>

989
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:48,740
<font color=#ffff00>- Guardian, stand down.

<font color=#ffff00>Go for the eyes.</font>

992
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,530
<font color=#ffff00>- Which ones?
- All of them.</font>

993
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:26,050
<font color=#ffff00>Ilya, Suresh, report.</font>

994
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:29,350
<font color=#ffff00>Do you copy?
Come on guys.</font>

995
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:33,490
<font color=#ffff00>Guardian Bravo, give me a sit rep.
You guys okay?</font>

996
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:39,400
<font color=#ffff00>Guardian is down.
I'm here in the comm-pod. Suresh...</font>

997
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:47,390
<font color=#ffff00>- Suresh didn't make it.
- Copy, Guardian.</font>

998
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:50,710
<font color=#ffff00>Just stay put. We'll send you help
as soon as we can.</font>

1001
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:02,280
<font color=#ffff00>Little bit duped, but
we are still in the fight.</font>

1002
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:06,950
<font color=#ffff00>Us too, Saber.
I mean Saber Athena sir.</font>

1003
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:10,930
<font color=#ffff00>Saber, Bracer, prepare to intercept

1006
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:21,490
<font color=#ffff00>Gipsy to Command, do you have
a tactical scan of the hostile?</font>

1007

1008
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:25,390
<font color=#ffff00>We have it Gipsy, but
it's still compiling.</font>

1009
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,800
<font color=#ffff00>No time. Can you locate the brains?</font>

1010
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:29,360
<font color=#ffff00>Hostile's central brain
mass is heavily armored.</font>

1011

able to penetrate.</font>

1012
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,009
<font color=#ffff00>What about a secondary brain?
This son of bitch has one of those?</font>

1013
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:38,029
<font color=#ffff00>Hostile has three secondary brain,
one for each component Kaiju.</font>

my lead and stay alert.</font>

1018
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:52,850
<font color=#ffff00>Fire up some of that
Fury-tech Liwen grabbed us?</font>

1019
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:54,450

Get up, Nate.</font>

1025

1026
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,630
<font color=#ffff00>Bye.</font>

1027
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:11,370
<font color=#ffff00>Liwen, is there anything
that you can do to help?</font>

1028
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,630
<font color=#ffff00>I need more time.</font>

1029
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:14,830
<font color=#ffff00>We don't have any. If the
hostile reaches Mount Fuji...</font>

1030
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:17,970
<font color=#ffff00>Understood. I'm not
gonna let that happen.</font>

1031
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,540
<font color=#ffff00>You can not operate Gipsy
without a co-pilot.</font>

1032
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:28,330

your mind apart.</font>

1033
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:35,690
<font color=#ffff00>- What do we do now?
- Regroup with the others.</font>

1034
01:31:37,570 --> 01:31:41,170
<font color=#ffff00>Gipsy Avenger, this is Amara Namani.</font>

1035
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:44,140
<font color=#ffff00>Stand by for assist.
- Amara don't.</font>

1036
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,850
<font color=#ffff00>- You won't make it.
- Shut up.</font>

1037
01:31:45,870 --> 01:31:48,820
<font color=#ffff00>- Don't. Don't.
- Shut up.</font>

1038
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:09,620
<font color=#ffff00>- I told you.
- Since when do I listen?</font>

1039
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,400
<font color=#ffff00>Amara, you're up..</font>

1040
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:14,609

enough to slow your re entry.</font>

I knew you could do it.</font>

1104

- Thank you sir.</font>

1109
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:42,560
<font color=#ffff00>Is this the part where you're gonna
give me one of those big dumb speeches?</font>

1110
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:44,550
<font color=#ffff00>Did everyone think it was
dumb, or it was just your opinion?</font>

1111
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:46,530
<font color=#ffff00>How many times did you practice
that in front of the mirror?</font>

1112
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:48,950
