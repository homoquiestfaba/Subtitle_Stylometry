1
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,885
Hey, I was thinking
about taking the horses

2
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,418
for a run
on the ridge.

3
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:20,254
Perfect. And would you
mind getting Toby, too?

4
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,990
I think
he really needs it.

5
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,691
Yeah, sounds good.

6
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,727
Cupid!

7
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,764
Cupid!

8
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,982
<i>♪ Fa-la-la-la-la,</i>
<i>la-la... ♪</i>

9
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,754
- <i>Katie!</i>
- Hey, Donna.

10
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,488
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>the stuff for me?</i>

11
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,423
Yep, I got it right here
with me in the truck.

12
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,126
<i>Do you have to meet</i>
<i>with a contractor?</i>

13
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,961
Yes, meeting with a contractor
about the train depot.

14
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,596
<i>Oh, I love you, Katie.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

15
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,731
All right.
I'll see you soon.

16
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,886
Well, well, well.

17
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,155
If it isn't the lovely
Miss Valentine here

18
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,024
to spread
some holiday cheer.

19
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:46,094
Hi, Veronica.
Can I have a hot cocoa please?

20
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,462
So, what brings you
in today?

21
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,732
Well, I've got
some salvage

22
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:52,934
from the bank restoration
for Donna,

23
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,502
and then I'm meeting
with a contractor

24
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:55,670
about moving
the old depot.

25
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,772
-Wow, moving?
-Yeah.

26
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,273
The railroads need to
widen the tracks eventually,

27
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,409
and the station's
just too close.

28
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,178
Well, it sure would be
a shame to lose it.

29
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,214
Sure would.
It's been in use for--

30
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,683
-For 80 years.
-And it was built in--

31
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,953
- 1885.
- I've mentioned it.

32
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,788
A few times.

33
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,355
How much does it cost

34
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,657
to move
a building that big?

35
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,291
Ugh, it's gonna be a lot.

36
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,394
The bad news is,
I'm talking crazy money.

37
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,098
The good news is,
we've got time,

38
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:25,833
and with grants
and fundraisings,

39
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,502
we should
just about make it.

40
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:30,104
Well, you could
always ask Santa for help.

41
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:32,206
Veronica. Be serious.

42
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,575
What?
You don't believe in Santa?

43
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:37,879
Well... it's worth a shot.

44
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:39,346
Sure is.

45
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,215
I just sent him
a letter earlier this week

46
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,850
asking for a man, so...

47
00:04:42,984 --> 00:04:44,317
- Wait!
- We'll see...

48
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,020
But what about
the actor?

49
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:47,555
Well, don't you
technically need to be paid

50
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:48,923
to be an actor?

51
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,858
Listen, the only acting
this guy did

52
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:52,927
was convincing me
that he'd split the rent.

53
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,796
Yeah, but you're still
doing better than me.

54
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:57,665
I can't imagine sitting through
another Christmas dinner

55
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:00,701
with my mom asking
why I don't have a boyfriend.

56
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:02,770
Aw.

57
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,773
Oh, well.

58
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,043
Oh, look at the time.
Hey, I gotta run.

59
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:10,812
-What do I owe you?
-Don't worry about it.

60
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:12,379
Put it towards
the train station.

61
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,048
You're the best.

62
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,343
-Hi, Donna.
-Katie!

63
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,412
Do you have some
good stuff for me?

64
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,048
Yeah, I do.

65
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,116
They're made from repurposed
wood from the old bank,

66
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,585
just north of town.

67
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,653
Oh, yes, I drive by
that all the time.

68
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,121
Yeah, they're in the middle

69
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:55,790
of a renovation right now,

70
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,025
and can you believe
they were just gonna toss out

71
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,261
all this
old great stuff?

72
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,729
I can't.
You're incredible.

73
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:03,531
You bring me
the greatest and coolest.

74
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,398
Wait till you see
what we did with the old...

75
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,568
cast iron cures
you brought last week.

76
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:10,605
-I can't wait to see 'em.
-I can't wait to show you.

77
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,840
Do you have to meet
with a contractor today?

78
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:15,209
Oh, yes. The contractor
down at the train depot.

79
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:17,278
- Mm-hm?
- Besides,

80
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,314
I better get outta here before
I buy up the whole store.

81
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,883
Well, I love
to hear that.

82
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:23,684
I just can't wait
for you to come back.

83
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,953
-Thanks, Donna.
-Oh, good luck to you today.

84
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:27,688
Thanks. Bye!

85
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,727
So, as you can see,

86
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,129
despite being vacant
a number of years,

87
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,865
the structure is still
in really good shape.

88
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:40,034
You said 1885?

89
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,903
Yes, 1885.

90
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:43,838
The property's owned
by the railroad,

91
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:46,941
but the depot is owned
and maintained by the village.

92
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:50,511
Wow, for being
as old as this is,

93
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:51,946
it's in really
good shape.

94
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,016
But, I'm sorry,
but I-- I can't move it.

95
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,217
I can't do the job.

96
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,752
Wha-- what do you mean?

97
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,787
It's just, uh,
it's just too big for me.

98
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,923
I don't have the manpower

99
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:05,192
or the equipment, you know,
to handle somethin' like this.

100
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:08,930
But I can give you
the number of a firm in town.

101
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:10,865
Shouldn't be
a problem for them.

102
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:14,001
They've moved a number
of historic buildings.

103
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:15,636
All right, excellent.

104
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,705
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

105
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,678
Hey, Mom, what's up?

106
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,279
Hey, can you do
your mom a solid?

107
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:26,781
Olivia's down
at the station

108
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,683
giving Billy
and the chief trouble again.

109
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,384
You mean she's not out
educating people

110
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:31,719
on their first amendment
rights again?

111
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,453
I just don't have time.

112
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,890
Go sort out what's going on
with my favorite granddaughter.

113
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,658
Sure. She is your only
granddaughter.

114
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,660
Yes, I know
she's my only granddaughter,

115
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:42,330

00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:36,217
Hi. I'm Chief Murphy.

128
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,586
And who might you be?

129
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,088
I'm Nicholas Claus.

130
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:44,125
Nick.

131
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,494
Nick, you've been
brought in today

132
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,830
because you were trespassing
on somebody's property...

133
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,701
dressed like Santa Claus.
Can you...

134
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:57,271
Well, I was out lookin'
for my lost reindeer.

135
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:00,841
Oh. What's its name?

136
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:03,978
-Cupid. His name is Cupid.
-Cupid?

137
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,848
Like the baby?
With the tiny bow.

138
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,350
No, no, no.

139
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:14,255
Cupid is part of my team
that makes my sleigh fly.

140
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:17,191
You know, like,
to bring toys

141
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,427
to the boys and girls
around the world?

142
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,163
You know,
milk and cookies?

143
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,597
Is this a joke?

144
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,499
Is this guy
joking right now?

145
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,234
Because I have no idea
what's going on.

146
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,837
But I do know I have better
things that I could be doing.

147
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,338
I'm pretty sure
we all have better--

148
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:33,908
Wait, what?
You arrested Santa?

149
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,945
You're going to ruin Christmas.
I'm telling everybody.

150
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:46,787
Sit tight, Santa.

151
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:50,357
Olivia, oh--
hold up now. Hold up.

152
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:53,894
-We didn't arrest anyone.
-This is so wrong.

153
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,930
You need to let him go.
Right away.

154
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,865
Give it
a second, okay?

155
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:01,335
Can someone please explain
to me what's going on here?

156
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:04,004
Police Chief Murphy
arrested Santa Claus

157
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:07,208
and is going to ruin Christmas
for people all over the world.

158
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:08,776
Olivia.

159
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:12,547
Thank you.

160
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,850
We got a phone call this
morning from Ron Montgomery.

161
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:19,019
Someone was trespassing
on his property,

162
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:22,289
so I sent Billy out
to investigate,

163
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:26,561
and he comes back with
this gentleman for questioning.

164
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:28,929
He thinks
he's Santa Claus.

165
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,831
He is Santa Claus!

166
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,834
Ho-ho-ho!
It's all right, young lady.

167
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,103
I'm just fine.
I promise.

168
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:39,574
I was just looking for
one of my reindeer.

169
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,109
Cupid, he ran off
this morning.

170
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:44,745
We need to help
find him, Aunt Katie,

171
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,947
or Santa won't be able
to deliver presents

172
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,282
all over the world.

173
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,284
Okay, okay.

174
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:55,890
Hey, Santa! When was
the last time you saw him?

175
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:59,393
Just this morning.
He ran off into town.

176
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,695
And has he
run off before?

177
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,063
Oh, yes.

178
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:05,499
Cupid does this
from time to time.

179
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,334
- Okay.
- Do you know

180
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:09,703
why I call him Cupid?

181
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,606
No. Why, Santa?

182
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,675
Well, he's drawn to love.

183
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:17,044
To bringing people together.

184
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:20,381
Every time
he runs off like this,

185
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:21,882
he always seems
to turn up

186
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,884
right where love
is blossoming.

187
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:26,253
Okay, okay.

188
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:29,323
I'm sure Chief Murphy
will keep an eye out for Cupid.

189
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,525
Isn't that right?

190
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,126
- We will.
- Mm-hm.

191
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,094
Okay, Chief, I'm sorry,
but with all due respect,

192
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,430
you really want us spending
our time running around town

193
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,533
trying to catch a mythical,
magical creature

194
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:39,767
for Santa Claus?

195
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:42,303
Don't you spend
every weekend out

196
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,706
looking for
the Abominable Snowman?

197
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,577
No, Katie, because
that would be ridiculous.

198
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,045
I spend every weekend
trying to find Sasquatch.

199
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,780
And for your information,

200
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,281
I almost got a picture
of him last weekend,

201
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:55,482
but it was too dark.

202
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:59,386
Well then, clearly, we have
the right man for the job.

203
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,789
I don't got
time for this.

204
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,090
I have some actual
police work to do.

205
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,427
I assure you,
we are going to

206
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:09,631
do everything within
our power to find Cupid.

207
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:10,764
Okay?

208
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,567
Thank you.

209
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,270
Okay... Nick.

210
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,572
Santa.

211
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,140
The homeowner isn't gonna be
pressin' any charges,

212
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:21,875
so you're gonna be
free to go.

213
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,210
However...

214
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:25,813
I think
it would be a great idea

215
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,748
if you had
a conversation

216
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,817
with a mental health
professional.

217
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:33,688
Hey, it's me, Holly,
and there goes Alan Turner

218
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,123
and the Steel Horse Band,
featuring Jackie Daniels.

219
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:38,959
And we just got
a phone call from Linda

220
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,427
over at Battle Alley Coffee.

221
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:42,029
Now get this,
she's saying that there

222
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,364
is a reindeer
on the loose.

223
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,065
She has seen it
with her own eyes.

224
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,167
Definitely not Rudolph,
there's no red nose.

225
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:49,169
But there is
a little black nose,

226
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:52,473
so be on the lookout for maybe
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen?

227
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,174
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen?

228
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,010
We're not sure,
but when you see it,

229
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,612
give the radio station
a call.

230
00:12:57,746 --> 00:12:59,480
Right now,
it's KayLyn Pace.

231
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,457
Thank you,
councilmen and women.

232
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:15,329
This depot is more
than just a pile of bricks.

233
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,131
It's our history.

234
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:21,268
Its walls chronicle
the story of Holly itself.

235
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:24,838
It's windows and floors
saw the narratives

236
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,608
of our forefathers,

237
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:30,444
as the accounts of how we
started as a community began.

238
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:35,583
Its very track
served as a conduit

239
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:39,887
to almost every family tree
on this council board.

240
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:44,191
We don't want to
merely archive it away,

241
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:47,494
like a painting
in a museum's back room.

242
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,097
We want to save it.

243
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:54,569
And most importantly,
we want to use it.

244
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:59,507
First, by relocating it
from its original place,

245
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:03,511
then restoring it
to its former glory.

246
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:08,482
And finally,
encouraging the residents

247
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:11,018
of Holly
to engage in it.

248
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,887
Just imagine
using that space for things

249
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,791
like weddings and banquets.

250
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:18,992
Classrooms
and town hall meetings.

251
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:21,228
The village
treasury just can't handle

252
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:23,598
this kind of monetary
expense at this time.

253
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:28,235
Our community is moving towards
a new and exciting future,

254
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,572
and we need
to embrace that change.

255
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:33,708
Listen, Katie, most of
city council agrees with you.

256
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:35,409
But our hands
are simply tied.

257
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:37,444
We just
don't have the money.

258
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,313
Well, there has to be
something that we can do.

259
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,881
I'm afraid
it can't be done.

260
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:45,285
The original five-year plan
was ambitious in and of itself.

261
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,756
We can't just
let them tear it down.

262
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,958
I, personally
stand with Katie.

263
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,862
Katie represents
the future of Holly, Michigan.

264
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:57,030
We have to find
a way to support

265
00:14:57,164 --> 00:15:00,769
and fund
the restoration of the depot.

266
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,237
I believe we should
make it a workable time frame

267
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,372
-to make it happen.
-Exactly.

268
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:07,908
We cannot
build a future

269
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,245
without preserving
and respecting our past.

270
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,249
If they are not inspired
by the past of our city,

271
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,719
where will they
find the strength

272
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:20,087
to fight
for our future.

273
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,556
Julius.

274
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,691
We appreciate your passion.

275
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,828
But this meeting
is adjourned.

276
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,169
Terrible.

277
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,071
You know how old this bible is?

278
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,543
So, this bible
is probably from the 1870s.

279
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,146
Oh, hey, Katie.
Come on in.

280
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,650
The council president's
waiting for you over there.

281
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:50,217
Thanks, Nicole.

282
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:53,120
Hi, Julius.

283
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:54,656
Thank you so much for coming.

284
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,156
-I think you know the senator.
-Oh, again.

285
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,792
Good to see you, Katie.

286
00:15:57,926 --> 00:15:59,259
Have a seat.

287
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:03,330
So, Julius, uh, did you see
the quote that I sent over?

288
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:06,166
I did.
And I've got some bad news.

289
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,770
Senator, do you want to
share with her what we learned?

290
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:12,774
Yeah. Unfortunately,
we were told we had five years.

291
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:16,043
And now they say
we have less than one year.

292
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,679
What happened?

293
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,814
I don't know.

294
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:21,783
Something about expanding
the tracks ahead of schedule.

295
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,150
But I spoke to the firm

296
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,853
that the village
contractor gave us.

297
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,453
They can still do it.

298
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:30,390
Unfortunately,
they want 50% down on the job

299
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:33,327
before they'll start
by the end of this year.

300
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,931
The end of this year?
That's in three weeks.

301
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,601
-I'm so sorry.
-It won't be easy.

302
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:43,671
But Katie, I think because
you have such enthusiasm,

303
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:46,139
you have the perfect
personality for this.

304
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,275
You'll get people inspired.

305
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:51,613
I can help get some of
my elected officials involved,

306
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:53,915
and I think we can get
people to come

307
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,283
and we can
have a big fundraiser.

308
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,720
A fundraiser?

309
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,089
That's a great idea.

310
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,491
-Thank you, Senator.
-Thank you, Katie.

311
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,829
I'm gonna start
my morning tomorrow

312
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:10,598
with a nice hot cup
of coffee from Battle Alley.

313
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:12,299
Battle Alley! Yes!

314
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:16,203
Caramel macchiato, or a--
or a-- or a buttered rum.

315
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:18,740
I can just
smell it right now.

316
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:21,074
I miss that smell
walkin' in there every morning.

317
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,977
I know.
It's been way too long.

318
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,846
You know what I miss? My bed.

319
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,081
I just can't wait
to get outta these boots.

320
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,317
You take care,
brother, okay?

321
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,786
You too.

322
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,987
-All right, see you later.
-Stay safe.

323
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,254
You too.

324
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,528
-Hey, Tony.
-Hey, Luke.

325
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:42,162
How's civilian life
treating you?

326
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:44,197
Honestly, I'm not
too sure yet.

327
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:47,334
I just got back home in Holly
and this is my first Christmas

328
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,970
back here in a decade.

329
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,706
Okay, well I'm not gonna
take up too much of your time.

330
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,908
We have an opening
at the Chicago firm.

331
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:56,343
Sales exec. And I think
you would be great for it.

332
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,145
Thanks, Tony, that's...

333
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,379
really nice of you.

334
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,683
Okay, well,
we lookin' at flying you out

335
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:03,250
for a tour next week.

336
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,552
I just don't know
if I could do it, though.

337
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:06,353
Look,
it's the same thing

338
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,822
as when you were
in the service, man.

339
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:10,190
Persuading people
and just talking to 'em.

340
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:12,225
You know,
I just got home, and...

341
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,462
took a job with the fire
department here in town.

342
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,231
Can you really
see me doing sales?

343
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,068
Uh, okay,
how about this, sleep on it.

344
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,236
I'm going to be in Detroit for,
like, three days next week.

345
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:25,472
We'll sit down
and have lunch,

346
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:27,575
and pop in
on you then.

347
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:30,277
Okay? And Luke,

348
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,046
I hope you're ready
to make some serious cash.

349
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:34,549
-Sure thing, Tony.
-All right.

350
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,426
- Hah-hah!
- Hey, Jeff!

351
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:48,963
No, no, no,
bring it in here, man.

352
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:50,364
Ah, you got it, baby.

353
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,267
You didn't think
we forgot about you, did you?

354
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,838
Yeah, actually,
for a minute there

355
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:59,272
I didn't think anyone
was coming to get me.

356
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:02,209
Come on.
You're Holly's hero.

357
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,211
We pull out
all the stops for you.

358
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,847
I even got
the heater fixed.

359
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,215
I didn't want you to get
a cold and everybody blames me.

360
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,250
Well, don't spoil me now.

361
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,621
I did figure my old man
would come and get me, though.

362
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:15,857
You know, he's the one
that asked me to pick you up.

363
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,725
You know,
as chief of police, he's--

364
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:19,560
-he's a real busy man.
-Yeah.

365
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:21,228
And then we got
all these last-minute

366
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,064
preparations
for the Christmas parade.

367
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,932
-Kinda hard.
-Yeah, I guess so.

368
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,635
Yeah. In fact,
speaking of your old man...

369
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,671
did you tell him
that you accepted

370
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:31,238
a position with me
at the fire department?

371
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,472
Uh...

372
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:34,008
You didn't tell him.

373
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:36,443
Ah, he's the chief
of police.

374
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:38,478
If I told him I took a job
at the fire department

375
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:40,247
he'd probably disown me.

376
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:42,215
You know,
you're probably right.

377
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,552
But I'll tell you this,
better you than me,

378
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:46,154
'cause you're the one
that's gonna tell him.

379
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,855
Not me. All right.

380
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:49,590
Let's get you home, guy.

381
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:03,336
All right.

382
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:05,940
I'll take it.

383
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,078
Thank you. Oh, shoes!

384
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:16,450
Okay.

385
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,486
Hey, what's this
I hear about you

386
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,455
breaking into a holding cell
in the police station

387
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:23,223
and giving Billy
and the chief trouble?

388
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,692
They locked up Santa Claus.

389
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:26,728
Put yourselves
in my shoes, Judy.

390
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:28,462
What would you
have done?

391
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:30,497
Okay, uh, first of all,
that is grandma to you.

392
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:33,233
And second, um,
I'd let them do their jobs?

393
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,635
Fine,
but don't look at me

394
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,336
when no one gets
presents on Christmas.

395
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,139
It was a nice
old man dressed as Santa.

396
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:40,675
So, did they
let him out?

397
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:42,375
Yes, they did.

398
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,845
Well then, great.
Christmas is saved.

399
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:46,748
Not quite.
We still have to find Cupid.

400
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:48,683
With the bow
and the arrow and the wings?

401
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:50,383
I thought we were
talking about Christmas.

402
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,285
Santa's reindeer, Cupid!

403
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,488
I know Szott's dealership
were looking for

404
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:56,289
real reindeer this year, so...

405
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,925
probably has
to do with that.

406
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,770
Val!
Luke's here!

407
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,677
- Luke!
- Welcome home, Luke.

408
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:18,613
Hi, Valerie.

409
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:21,348
Good to have you home, son.

410
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:23,618
It's good to be home, Dad.

411
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:26,154
Got dinner
all ready for you.

412
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,922
Oh, great.
I'm starving.

413
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,116
It's great, Valerie.
Thank you.

414
00:21:55,817 --> 00:22:00,487
And... I ran into,
uh, Katie, today.

415
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:03,257
Have you had a chance to call
her since you've been back?

416
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,059
No, I have not.

417
00:22:06,027 --> 00:22:08,229
I mean, I would like to,
but I don't think

418
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,931
she'd wanna talk to me.

419
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:12,233
Why wouldn't she
wanna hear from you?

420
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,035
I'm sure
she'd love to see you.

421
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:16,604
It's just complicated.

422
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:21,474
I left
to join the army.

423
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:23,443
I was young and...

424
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:25,780
it was right after
my mom passed away.

425
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:29,116
I probably could've
handled things better.

426
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:34,055
Well, if I was her,
I'd for sure want to see you.

427
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:35,923
Especially during Christmas.

428
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,726
Thanks, Valerie.

429
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,195
So, have you
thought about work?

430
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:42,964
Any idea
what you wanna do?

431
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:46,934
You know, I could always use
another officer at the station.

432
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,106
Uh...

433
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:55,977
yeah, I, uh,
I actually did find some work.

434
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:59,046
Really? Fantastic.
Whatcha doing?

435
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:04,318
Well, you see,
uh, Jeff...

436
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,822
he reached out a couple
weeks back and I, um...

437
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:12,593
I sort of...
accepted a position at the...

438
00:23:13,094 --> 00:23:15,462
-fire department.
-You what?

439
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:22,904
Chief Deckman told me
a long time ago.

440
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:25,472
-Congratulations.
-You already knew?

441
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:27,875
Of course.
This is Holly.

442
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:31,444
I have been stressing
about this all week long.

443
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:34,315
Cheers.

444
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:36,918
Welcome home.

445
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,897
Did you believe
that Santa was real today?

446
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:52,833
I honestly don't know, V.
Could be.

447
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,802
I'm gonna find Cupid.

448
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:56,837
I have no doubt you are.

449
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:58,773
Come on,
let's get you tucked in.

450
00:24:02,944 --> 00:24:04,378
Can you sing me
a song?

451
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:06,180
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe not--

452
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:09,083
Please! I'll go right to sleep
and I won't get up and bug you.

453
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:11,819
All right.

454
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,189

Hi. Usual?

473
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,896
-Please and thank you.
-Coming right up.

474
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:05,299
- Oh, hi, Luke.
- Hey.

475
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,468
Order pickup
for the fire station?

476
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:08,936
It'll be just a sec.

477
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,339
Um, Katie,
it'll be a second.

478
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:14,075
The machine
is on the fritz.

479
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,409
Thanks.

480
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:18,179
Katie...
Valentine?

481
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:21,782
Luke Murphy.

482
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:24,318
Fireman.

483
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,021
Oh... yeah.

484
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:29,156
I'm sure
your dad is thrilled.

485
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,526
He's comin' around.

486
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:35,496
Well, you always were
good at putting out fires.

487
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:37,665
Some of which
being yours.

488
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:39,633
Fair.

489
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:42,537
Well, it looks like
it's gonna be a while.

490
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,271
You wanna grab a seat?

491
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:45,606
Might as well.

492
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,374
Great.

493
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:55,015
So, how've you been, Luke?

494
00:26:55,517 --> 00:26:57,017
It's been a while.

495
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:59,353
Just trying to get
used to civilian life, really.

496
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,523
Excited to be
back home though.

497
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,659
I'm at the fire station,
workin' with Jeff and Jack.

498
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:08,095
And I am
the gofer today.

499
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:12,032
-How about you?
-Can't complain.

500
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:14,468
I've been running
the Holly Historical Society.

501
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:16,070
Figures.

502
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:17,905
What do you mean
by that?

503
00:27:18,372 --> 00:27:19,473
Come on.

504
00:27:19,608 --> 00:27:21,108
Who did you used
to drag with you

505
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:23,578
to break into
all those old buildings?

506
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:26,147
It's true.
I remember.

507
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,682
I actually think that's
pretty cool you're doing that.

508
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:30,684
Well, thank you.

509
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:32,153
You still singing?

510
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:33,721
Me? Singing?

511
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:35,689
No.

512
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:37,592
Are you kidding?
Why not?

513
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:39,561
Luke, I don't do
that anymore.

514
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,429
It's been over eight years
since I've last sung.

515
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:45,666
Why? You were always talking
about it when we were kids.

516
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,736
You won Holly Idol.

517
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:53,974
I always figured that I'd run
into you on tour somewhere.

518
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:55,042
Stop.

519
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:58,547
I'm serious, Katie.
You were really great.

520
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:00,414
Why did you stop?

521
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:05,052
I don't know.
Life, I guess.

522
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:08,055
Besides, it's not like
I could just

523
00:28:08,189 --> 00:28:10,724
run off and start
a life somewhere else.

524
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,695
I'm joking.

525
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,830
It's okay.

526
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:19,534
I probably
deserve that, anyway.

527
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:23,237
But hey,
if you still like singing,

528
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,272
-you should do it.
-I don't know.

529
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:26,974
I haven't done it
in so long,

530
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:28,643
I don't know
if I'd even like it anymore.

531
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:30,579
Hey, you say that now.

532
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:33,113
But I seem to remember
a certain bar...

533
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:35,049
that does
a karaoke night.

534
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:38,185
Not gonna happen.
Besides, I gotta run.

535
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,387
I gotta meet someone
down at the train depot.

536
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:42,957
You wouldn't wanna
tag along, would you?

537
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,291
Well, it's just
around the corner.

538
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:46,727
Come on.
You might learn somethin'.

539
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:59,507
I have not been
in this place for years.

540
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:02,476
It's a great,
historic building.

541
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:06,413
You know, Holly organically
grew around this depot.

542
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:09,483
If it weren't for that
and the railroad,

543
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:11,885
Holly might
not even exist.

544
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:14,054
Well,
what do you think, Walter?

545
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:16,857
It's a beautiful building.

546
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:18,526
I-- it's in great shape.

547
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,128
You know, I-- I left
some things out in my car.

548
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:23,831
Uh, let me go grab those,
I'll be right back.

549
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,700
Thanks, Walter.

550
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:33,140
I can tell this place
means a lot to you.

551
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,242
I just love it here.

552
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,579
All the old brickwork.

553
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:40,515
And if you
close your eyes,

554
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:43,551
you can imagine it
full of all sorts of people.

555
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:47,522
All coming home to see
their families on Christmas.

556
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,827
- Ready?
- Yeah.

557
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:57,831
Well, I have to admit it...

558
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:00,735
that was actually
pretty interesting.

559
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:04,938
Well, Holly
is a pretty interesting place,

560
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:06,508
believe it or not.

561
00:30:07,341 --> 00:30:09,511
It's just so awful
that they're gonna tear down

562
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:12,046
this train depot
before the end of the month.

563
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:14,815
Says who?

564
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:17,351
Luke, I told you.
The village.

565
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:20,421
They just don't have enough
money to relocate it right now.

566
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:23,123
Well, I get that, but...

567
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:25,392
who says you can't raise
the money on your own?

568
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:29,531
What do you expect me to do?

569
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:31,131
Rob some banks?

570
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:33,467
I don't know.

571
00:30:34,101 --> 00:30:36,170
Maybe you could
throw a big

572
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:38,506
Christmas fundraiser
or something.

573
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:44,445
Have a big party? Some bands?
Good food? Dancing?

574
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,347
There's enough
people around

575
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,849
who I'm sure would
love to chip in.

576
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:52,252
It's not a horrible idea.

577
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:54,088
It's just that
I don't know

578
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:56,023
when I'd go about
planning all that.

579
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,292
It's not like
I have much time.

580
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,361
Maybe I could help.

581
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:02,530
You?

582
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:04,532
Yeah.
Why not?

583
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,736
I did some operations
planning in the army.

584
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:10,371
And I used to throw
a pretty good party

585
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:12,172
back in high school,
didn't I?

586
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,175
You did...

587
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:18,278
but I think it's gonna have to
be a little classier than that.

588
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,049
Yeah, well, you'll have to
help me with that part, but...

589
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:25,352
I honestly think
this could work.

590
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,121
Hm.

591
00:31:27,254 --> 00:31:28,389
It's worth a shot,
don't you think?

592
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:31,559
And maybe you'll get a
Christmas miracle or something.

593
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:34,596
Yeah.

594
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:35,830
It's worth a try.

595
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:38,365
All right,
I'll look into it,

596
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:42,035
see what all needs to be done,
and where we could hold it at.

597
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:43,538
The Christmas parade
is in a couple days,

598
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:46,173
so it's gonna
have to be after that.

599
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:49,209
Well, think about it,
let me know.

600
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:52,980
Yeah.
I will.

601
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:54,481
Well, I better
get headin' out.

602
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:56,083
Told the fire chief
that I'd pick him up

603
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:58,118
some coffee
before headin' over.

604
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:00,387
I'll see you
around though?

605
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:02,524
It is
a small town after all.

606
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:09,430
<i>♪ I know how you feel</i>
<i>afraid of failing ♪</i>

607
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:14,301
<i>♪ Let me tell you</i>
<i>it's worth trying ♪</i>

608
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,141
Hey, look who's here.
The rookie.

609
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,610
What took you so long?

610
00:32:22,744 --> 00:32:25,345
- Coffee.
- Little late, aren't you?

611
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:29,617
Hey, chief,
your coffee's finally here.

612
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:31,820
What the heck
took you so long?

613
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:33,420
I'm having
caffeine fits in there.

614
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:34,789
- Sorry, sir.
- What did you do,

615
00:32:34,923 --> 00:32:36,190
grind these beans yourself?

616
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:37,491
He was at
the hairstylist, chief.

617
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,026
-The hairstylist?
-Ha-ha-ha.

618
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,695
John Cena
disappeared on us again.

619
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:42,630
Well, you guys
take care of this. Handle this.

620
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,498
We got it, chief.

621
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,601
Couple of things, rookie.

622
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:49,102
First off, E.P.A. test.
Gotta get done today.

623
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,939
Second,
I need you to find

624
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,574
the left-handed
smoke shifter for me.

625
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:54,975
Solid piece of brass
somewhere out back.

626
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:57,177
- Anything else?
- Stir the tanks.

627
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:58,979
-Stir the tanks.
-Can't let that water freeze.

628
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:02,015
All right, guys.
I get it, I get it.

629
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:04,284
Givin' the new guy
a hard time.

630
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,020
I think we gotta wax
the trucks too, don't we?

631
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:10,424
All right, boys. Game time.

632
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:14,762
Hey, by the way,
meant to ask you,

633
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:16,296
what are you
doing Saturday?

634
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,966
That's the day of
the Christmas parade,

635
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:19,734
so I was planning
on being there--

636
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:21,435
No, no, no, no, no, I don't
care what you were planning,

637
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:23,337
I'm gonna tell you
what you're gonna do.

638
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,072
Okay? You see, the engine
is gonna be in the parade.

639
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:28,810
I'm gonna be on the top
of the engine in the parade.

640
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:30,244
You understand me?

641
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:33,781
I need lights.
Green, red.

642
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:37,251
I need you to make it look like
a moving Christmas tree.

643
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:39,186
You know?

644
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:42,022
And then I sit on it,
I wave at the crowd--

645
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:43,691
- But I---
- No, no, no, no, no,

646
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:45,192
no, you don't nothing.

647
00:33:45,325 --> 00:33:48,161
No, no. You don't--
you make it Christmasy.

648
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:50,097
I sit on it.

649
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,001
People applaud and yell
and shout and I wave.

650
00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:55,402
- You won't be there.
- Okay.

651
00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:57,005
Unless you wanna
be in the crowd.

652
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:58,573
But not
on the engine.

653
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:00,340
So you-- you make sure
that you fix that up.

654
00:34:00,474 --> 00:34:03,377
Don't forget.
A moving Christmas tree.

655
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:05,613
- Sure thing.
- You got that? All righty.

656
00:34:05,747 --> 00:34:07,247
- Absolutely.
- Good.

657
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,116
Don't let me down.

658
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:33,240
Hey,.

659
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:35,075
I told you I wanted
hot chocolate. What is this?

660
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,912
-Ah, just drink it.
-Gosh.

661
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,749
Oh, hey, Luke.
How's it going?

662
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:43,851
- Jack.
- Hey, what's up, man?

663
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:47,120
Hey.
Fellas.

664
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:48,723
-Hey, Chief.
-Captain, how you doing?

665
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:50,525
What brings you here?

666
00:34:50,658 --> 00:34:53,293
Well, I saw Luke's car out in
the parking lot, and I thought,

667
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:56,598
"You know, I would stop
by and watch my only son

668
00:34:56,731 --> 00:34:59,634
betray me by signing up
with the fire department."

669
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:00,935
Sorry, Dad.

670
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:02,570
Ah, it's all right.

671
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:05,238
You guys do know why God
created police officers, right?

672
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,975
No.

673
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:08,843
So firefighters
could have heroes.

674
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:12,714
That's fair. That's fair.

675
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:14,481
Well,

676
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:17,018
if firefighting was so easy,
then they'd have cops do it.

677
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,553
- Oh.
- Right chief?

678
00:35:18,686 --> 00:35:20,387
Oh, you're kidding.

679
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:21,856
Aw, right through the heart.
You're woundin' me.

680
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,791
Hey, Luke,
do me a favor, would you?

681
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:26,426
Run these by Judy Valentine and
have her sign these permits.

682
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:28,630
I mean, I would do it,
but I'm a cop,

683
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:30,064
and I actually have
work to do.

684
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:32,199
Oh, God.

685
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:33,601
See you, Chief.

686
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:36,269
-Got some work to do.
-See you later.

687
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:38,438
Didn't you fail
the police academy?

688
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:40,307
That's messed up.

689
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,743
Hey, it's me,
Holly Hutton,

690
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:43,678
and I am here
with Katie Valentine.

691
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:46,246
President of
the Holly Historical Society,

692
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,049
also head
of the DDA.

693
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:51,552
And you're here today because
I heard there's a huge problem.

694
00:35:51,686 --> 00:35:53,387
-Can you tell us about that?
-Yes.

695
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:56,024
Holly, thank you so much
for helping us spread the word.

696
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:59,426
We are currently in dire
need of a contractor to help us

697
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,964
relocate and renovate
our beloved Holly Train Depot.

698
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:06,233
If anyone out there knows
of anyone reputable that

699
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:08,168
we can use
for this project,

700
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:09,871
we are currently
accepting bids,

701
00:36:10,004 --> 00:36:11,706
and we'd like to speak
with them as soon as possible.

702
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,574
Okay, so, you can
call the radio station

703
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,409
if you know of anyone,
if you can help.

704
00:36:15,543 --> 00:36:18,178
And if that person happens
to be attractive and--

705
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:20,380
and single, uh,
Katie, I heard you're--

706
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:21,949
you're available.

707
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,918
Your mom called.

708
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:27,655
Uh, Holly,
we can talk about this later.

709
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:30,290
Okay, well, we'll be
back with more music

710
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:32,026
with Paulina Jayne
after this.

711
00:36:42,436 --> 00:36:43,838
Carousel Acres,
this is Mady.

712
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:45,807
Yeah, hi, Mady,
this is officer Billy Mortimer

713
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,542
with the Holly Police
Department.

714
00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:49,476
Listen, I just wanted
to reach out and see if,

715
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,746
uh, you guys happen to be
missing any of your animals?

716
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,948
Because we've been
gettin' some weird sightings.

717
00:36:54,082 --> 00:36:55,550
Calls about reindeer.

718
00:36:55,683 --> 00:36:57,250
And I wanted to make sure
it wasn't one of yours.

719
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,520
Yeah, no,
I'm positive we have ours.

720
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:01,956
We actually had three
triplet goats born today.

721
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,457
Well, they sound very cute.

722
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:05,860
Yeah, all of the horses,
ducks, goats, sheep.

723
00:37:05,993 --> 00:37:08,963
Um, the foxes and
the emu, and the kangaroo.

724
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:10,230
We have everything.

725
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:11,799
Okay,
thank you very much

726
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:13,366
for your time and, uh,
tell Tammy I said hi.

727
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:16,403

735
00:37:33,855 --> 00:37:36,289
So, I think we can
put the cookie stand

736
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,992
at the end
of the parade row.

737
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:39,727
What do you think?

738
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:42,997
Hello?

739
00:37:43,131 --> 00:37:45,332
Oh, sure, mom. Yeah.

740
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,136
Okay. What's going on?

741
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:49,604
Nothing.

742
00:37:49,737 --> 00:37:51,939
I just had
a long day.

743
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:55,676
-And I ran into someone.
-Really? Who?

744
00:37:56,177 --> 00:37:58,012
- Luke.
- Oh.

745
00:37:58,846 --> 00:38:01,448
Mom, don't start.
It was nothing.

746
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:05,153
It was nice to see him
and all, but I don't know.

747
00:38:05,653 --> 00:38:07,454
It was just
a strange feeling.

748
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:09,223
Well, he was
always such a sweet boy.

749
00:38:10,024 --> 00:38:12,226
And he's become
quite a fine young man.

750
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:13,528
Did you guys
talk about going out?

751
00:38:13,661 --> 00:38:15,530
Mom! Do I need
to remind you

752
00:38:15,663 --> 00:38:17,430
that I was dating him,

753
00:38:17,565 --> 00:38:19,934
and then he up
and left town ten years ago?

754
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:21,368
It was strange.

755
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,370
Has he changed?

756
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:25,006
No.

757
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:26,808
That's the thing.

758
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:29,911
He's the same sweet, funny guy
that he was before he left.

759
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:32,312
Sweetheart,
someone that important to you

760
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:35,348
doesn't just show back up
in your life for no reason.

761
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:37,819
-You can't ignore that.
-Well, I don't know.

762
00:38:37,952 --> 00:38:40,121
There's just...
there's a lot of history there.

763
00:38:40,254 --> 00:38:42,790
Coming from the girl
obsessed with history.

764
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:44,926
That's true.

765
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:47,394
But I don't know, there's
so much going on right now.

766
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:49,697
With everything down
at the train depot,

767
00:38:49,831 --> 00:38:51,799
the last thing I need
to think about is love.

768
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:54,535
I haven't seen you
like this in years.

769
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:56,904
You're always
so focused on everyone else.

770
00:38:57,038 --> 00:38:59,073
Do something
that makes you happy.

771
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:02,844
-Oh, I'll get it.
-Thanks.

772
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:08,115
- Luke Murphy.
- Hi, Katie.

773
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:09,382
Are you following me?

774
00:39:09,884 --> 00:39:11,451
No, I'm actually here
to see your mom.

775
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:13,988
Oh. I didn't know
you liked older women.

776
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:16,557
No, it's not like that.

777
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:18,893
I'm here to get the permits
signed for the parade.

778
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,028
I'm just messin'.
Come on in.

779
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:30,905
-Luke!
-Mrs. Valentine.

780
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:32,439
So good to see you.

781
00:39:32,573 --> 00:39:35,009
-How are you?
-Good. Call me Judy.

782
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:37,444
My dad asked me to
come by and bring you these.

783
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:39,747
Perfect.
Will we see you at the parade?

784
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:41,448
-I wouldn't miss it.
-Awesome.

785
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:43,050
It is going to be
the best one ever.

786
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:46,020
Yeah, that's what
everyone keeps telling me.

787
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:48,723
Katie tells me
she ran into you earlier today.

788
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:52,059
Yeah. She even gave me
a VIP tour of the train depot.

789
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:54,262
-I bet she did.
-Yeah.

790
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:55,630
Speaking of which, Katie,

791
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:57,131
I reached out to
the banquet hall in town

792
00:39:57,265 --> 00:39:58,866
and I'm pretty sure
I can get us a spot

793
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,668
reserved for Friday
before Christmas.

794
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:02,937
-You did?
-Banquet hall? What's this?

795
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,339
Oh, we might be
holding a fundraiser

796
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:06,908
to save
the Holly Depot.

797
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:09,610
Well, not "maybe."
We're definitely doing it.

798
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:12,513
And not "fundraiser."
"Christmas gala."

799
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:15,016
Ooh, Christmas gala.
I like the sound of that.

800
00:40:15,149 --> 00:40:17,285
Luke, you didn't
have to do all that.

801
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,553
I know, I know,
but I wanted to.

802
00:40:19,987 --> 00:40:21,555
I was wondering
if maybe you wanted to

803
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:23,291
get together tomorrow,
we can go over it?

804
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:25,259
-Sure.
-Okay, great.

805
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:27,194
I just have to
figure out a few things first,

806
00:40:27,328 --> 00:40:28,596
then I can text you?

807
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:30,164
Sure,
I'll take your phone.

808
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:38,438
-Here's my number.
-Thank you.

809
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,942
Well, I will talk
to you tomorrow,

810
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:44,178
and it is very
nice to see you Mrs. V.

811
00:40:44,312 --> 00:40:45,980
Judy.

812
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,949
And why don't you stay and help
us finish decorating the tree?

813
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:50,017
Oh, I don't wanna intrude.
I'm sure you're really busy.

814
00:40:50,151 --> 00:40:52,853
No, it's no bother.
And we could use the help.

815
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:55,723
Might as well.

816
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:57,591
Well then, it's settled.
Make yourself comfortable.

817
00:41:01,162 --> 00:41:02,863
Hey, what are you
working on?

818
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:05,099
- Missing posters for Cupid.
- Who's Cupid?

819
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:07,802
Santa's reindeer, Cupid!
Haven't you heard of him?

820
00:41:07,935 --> 00:41:10,204
All right,
I know all about Cupid.

821
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:11,939
I didn't know
he was missing though.

822
00:41:12,073 --> 00:41:13,975
Santa says
he goes missing sometimes

823
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:17,311
but shows up
whenever there's true love.

824
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:19,847
Hm, well,
I'll keep a lookout for him.

825
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:22,183
-I'm Luke, by the way.
-I'm Olivia.

826
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:24,285
It's very nice
to meet you, Olivia.

827
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:26,087
How do you know
Aunt Katie?

828
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,390
We're just old friends
from a long time ago.

829
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:31,892
Are you two
in true love or what?

830
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:34,061
Olivia!

831
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:35,429
What?

832
00:41:41,802 --> 00:41:43,938
- Hey, Katie.
- Hey, Francesco.

833
00:41:44,071 --> 00:41:46,741
I think I'm gonna need
something strong today.

834
00:41:46,874 --> 00:41:48,342
Well, we have your favorites.

835
00:41:48,476 --> 00:41:50,678
We have Gianna Loren Rye
and Luca Mariano Bourbon.

836
00:41:51,078 --> 00:41:53,647
I think I'm gonna go
with my girl, Gianna Loren.

837
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:55,049
Hey, hey. Gianna.

838
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:57,084
You said it just like
the Italians do.

839
00:41:59,587 --> 00:42:01,555
<i>Parli Italiano?</i>

840
00:42:01,689 --> 00:42:04,692
<i>-Sì. Un poco.</i>
<i>-Un poco, </i> okay.

841
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:07,595
Well, I'm gonna drink
with you today.

842
00:42:07,728 --> 00:42:09,363
- Thank you.
- I mean,

843
00:42:09,497 --> 00:42:10,931
it seems like there's something
weighin' on your heart.

844
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:13,167
Well,
I ran into an old friend.

845
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:15,169
Do you remember Luke?

846
00:42:15,302 --> 00:42:16,370
The, uh,
police chief's son?

847
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:18,873
Didn't he leave,
like, ten years ago?

848
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:20,841
I think he's here to stay.

849
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:22,543
Does he know about your niece,
Olivia, and what happened?

850
00:42:23,144 --> 00:42:24,979
Yeah. I think he's heard.

851
00:42:25,112 --> 00:42:26,680
He was always like a child,

852
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:28,616
and you became
a single mother overnight.

853
00:42:30,017 --> 00:42:31,552
Yeah.

854
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:34,055
And I just-- I don't know
if he's ready for all that.

855
00:42:34,488 --> 00:42:36,023
Take it one day at a time.

856
00:42:36,924 --> 00:42:39,293
Yes, I''m gonna
take it one day at a time.

857
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,639
Hey, buddy. Hey, Cupid.

858
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:56,243
Shoot.
No, no, no, no, no. Stay.

859
00:42:58,179 --> 00:43:00,681
Hey, chief, I got him.
Uh, Cupid, the reindeer.

860
00:43:00,815 --> 00:43:02,183
He's right here

No, he's--

It's been a year
since I've been on a horse.

872
00:43:47,928 --> 00:43:49,163
Are you afraid?

873
00:43:49,763 --> 00:43:52,266
No. I'm not afraid.

874
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,902
Just-- been a while, is all.

875
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,271

You don't forget.

Yeah.

877
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,642

Well, you're not

yourself these days.

00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:43,717
Not like you, though.

892
00:44:44,586 --> 00:44:46,187

1032
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,981
So, I don't wanna

1033
00:53:34,115 --> 00:53:36,084
pat ourselves
too hard on the back yet,

1034
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:38,351
but I'm pretty sure we're
gonna be able to pull this off

1035
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:39,854
and save this old place.

1036
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:41,189
Oh, yeah?

1037
00:53:41,823 --> 00:53:43,290
- Yeah. I'm serious.
- That's great.

1038
00:53:43,423 --> 00:53:45,626
Hey. Listen, Luke.

1039
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:47,829
I can't thank you enough.

1040
00:53:48,696 --> 00:53:50,565
Everything you''ve been doing,
it's amazing.

1041
00:53:50,698 --> 00:53:52,133
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1042
00:53:52,265 --> 00:53:53,735
I'm just happy
I could help.

1043
00:53:55,268 --> 00:53:58,139
So--
do you hang out here often?

1044
00:53:59,173 --> 00:54:02,543
- Yeah.
- Uh, it's.

1045
00:54:02,677 --> 00:54:05,780
It's kinda my place.
I just-- I love it here.

1046
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:08,216
It's quiet, it's peaceful.

1047
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:10,885
No one's bothering me.

1048
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:12,385
Yeah. It's my place.

1049
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,855
Hm.

1050
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:16,157
Am I being weirder?

1051
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:17,725
No.

1052
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:19,392
Not at all.

1053
00:54:19,527 --> 00:54:21,328
You know, some girls, you know,
when they get stressed,

1054
00:54:21,461 --> 00:54:24,232
they like to--
buy fancy clothes

1055
00:54:24,364 --> 00:54:26,100
or watch
bad romance movies,

1056
00:54:26,234 --> 00:54:28,368
but you--
you like to squat

1057
00:54:28,502 --> 00:54:30,037
in old,
abandoned buildings.

1058
00:54:30,171 --> 00:54:31,471
It's totally normal.

1059
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:33,141
Okay, I'm guilty.

1060
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:35,275
I love that.

1061
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:36,544
Really?

1062
00:54:36,677 --> 00:54:38,112
Yeah, really.

1063
00:54:38,646 --> 00:54:40,515
You have a real passion.

1064
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:42,817
I love that.

1065
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,820
Hmm, well, it doesn't sound
like you love it.

1066
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:47,955
It sounds weird.

1067
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:50,725
No. You know, really.

1068
00:54:50,858 --> 00:54:53,426
I think that's something
that everybody needs.

1069
00:54:54,327 --> 00:54:55,395
Well, thank you.

1070
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,899
What about you?
What's yours?

1071
00:54:59,366 --> 00:55:00,500
My what?

1072
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:02,435
- Your passion.
- Hm.

1073
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,472
I'm not sure.

1074
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,141
Come on.

1075
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:08,475
You can't always play

1076
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:10,745
Mr. International
Man of Mystery.

1077
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:13,380
I don't know.

1078
00:55:13,514 --> 00:55:14,816
I've held so many jobs

1079
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:16,483
over the years
in the service, and...

1080
00:55:17,785 --> 00:55:19,921
nothin' ever
really clicked for me.

1081
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:21,789
There's gotta be somethin'.

1082
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:28,428
Well, you know...

1083
00:55:30,198 --> 00:55:32,800
ten years ago,
when my mom passed, uh...

1084
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:35,770
I was so lost and scared.

1085
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:39,674
I really wanted
to help her, but I couldn't.

1086
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:42,877
I just--
I never felt so powerless.

1087
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:48,348
Guess I couldn't handle it,
so I-- I left.

1088
00:55:48,481 --> 00:55:50,718
Joined the army, I just...

1089
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:53,120
tried not to give
a second thought

1090
00:55:53,254 --> 00:55:54,989
to anyone
that I was leavin' behind.

1091
00:55:56,891 --> 00:55:58,926
But I did, I--
I thought about everyone.

1092
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,129
I thought about them
all the time, my Dad.

1093
00:56:02,263 --> 00:56:03,764
I thought about you.

1094
00:56:04,832 --> 00:56:06,634
And I always
wanted to reach out, but...

1095
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:09,637
what was I gonna say?

1096
00:56:11,606 --> 00:56:13,875
I had so much guilt,

1097
00:56:14,008 --> 00:56:16,711
and I just felt like it was
something that I had to do.

1098
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,682
The only time
that I ever really...

1099
00:56:23,117 --> 00:56:25,319
truly-- felt happy.

1100
00:56:25,452 --> 00:56:28,421
Truly passionate
with what I was doing...

1101
00:56:30,825 --> 00:56:32,492
was when I was helping people.

1102
00:56:34,095 --> 00:56:35,162
Hm.

1103
00:56:36,097 --> 00:56:38,232
But we had done
natural disaster cleanup

1104
00:56:38,366 --> 00:56:39,634
for a while, and--

1105
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:41,669
those people...

1106
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:46,040
they had lost everything.

1107
00:56:46,707 --> 00:56:50,511
And just being able
to offer something to them.

1108
00:56:50,645 --> 00:56:53,681
Rescue a pet,
or even just...

1109
00:56:55,049 --> 00:56:57,351
find an old picture album
to return to them.

1110
00:56:58,152 --> 00:57:01,022
Anything to make them
feel a little bit more normal.

1111
00:57:02,924 --> 00:57:03,991
You know?

1112
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:06,994
They wouldn''t always
even say anything, but...

1113
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:10,564
you know, you-- you-- you could
see it in their eyes that...

1114
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:13,901
that it made a difference to
them.

1115
00:57:15,603 --> 00:57:17,939
Even just a-- a little bit.

1116
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:20,942
And that,

1117
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:24,812
that always
made me feel really good.

1118
00:57:27,214 --> 00:57:30,084
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

1119
00:57:31,552 --> 00:57:34,388
I guess
what I'm trying to say...

1120
00:57:35,556 --> 00:57:38,759
is that maybe I'm passionate
about helping people.

1121
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:44,198
I don't even know
if any of that made sense.

1122
00:57:45,633 --> 00:57:47,702
That made perfect sense.

1123
00:57:47,835 --> 00:57:49,537
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1124
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:53,207
Luke-- you've helped me
so much this week.

1125
00:57:53,808 --> 00:57:56,610
-Yeah.
-And I''m so thankful for that.

1126
00:58:00,147 --> 00:58:02,850
Listen, I gotta go
help my mom pack up the car

1127
00:58:02,984 --> 00:58:04,752
with the Christmas decorations.

1128
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:07,221
Need a hand?

1129
00:58:09,056 --> 00:58:11,559
I'm starting to feel
like your boss or something.

1130
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:16,297
Uh, no, no.
You should take the night off.

1131
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,232
Whatever.

1132
00:58:18,366 --> 00:58:19,467
But are you gonna go

1133
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,602
to the Christmas
parade tomorrow?

1134
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:23,104
Yeah, of course.

1135
00:58:23,237 --> 00:58:25,940
All right.
Maybe I'll see you there.

1136
00:58:26,707 --> 00:58:28,442
Absolutely.

1137
00:58:31,545 --> 00:58:34,248

seven, eight--

1140
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:52,500
Oh, God, Luke, it's sure good
to have you back.

1141
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,169
So good to be back, Dad.
I've missed you.

1142
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:57,171
I missed you
more than you know.

1143
00:58:57,772 --> 00:59:00,041
Even though
you did turn into a fireman.

1144
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:03,277
Which one?
I'm pretty sure it's Rudolph.

1145
00:59:03,411 --> 00:59:05,579
I think it's Cupid.
He's so sketchy.

1146
00:59:07,014 --> 00:59:08,849
-Is it Rudolph?
-What if it's Vixen?

1147
00:59:08,983 --> 00:59:11,085
-But you guys believe in Santa?
-Who still believe in Santa?

1148
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:13,154
Seriously,
nobody does at this age.

1149
00:59:13,287 --> 00:59:15,456
-I do.
-You do?

1150
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:17,658
Seriously guys, I dropped it,
like, five years ago.

1151
00:59:17,792 --> 00:59:19,493
-Yeah.
-What do you mean?

1152
00:59:19,627 --> 00:59:20,861
That's so babyish.

1153
00:59:20,995 --> 00:59:22,496
Like,
doesn't everybody know

1154
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,065
that it's the parents
who do it?

Here comes Santa Claus!

1159
00:59:56,997 --> 01:00:00,134
Here's Scrooge here
to present something to you.

1160
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:01,635
Oh, look at that.

1161
01:00:02,571 --> 01:00:06,240
So, you see, after travelling
with the spirits of Christmas,

1162
01:00:06,373 --> 01:00:08,776
I've made my reclamation,
and I'm here

1163
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:11,145
to celebrate Christmas
with all of you.

1164
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:13,747
And Santa,
I have a key to the huts

1165
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:15,517
of all the children in Holly,

1166
01:00:15,649 --> 01:00:16,817
and we will include
a--

1167
01:00:16,951 --> 01:00:18,219
All right, I can--

1168
01:00:18,352 --> 01:00:19,787
Countdown to light the tree?

1169
01:00:21,556 --> 01:00:23,023
On ten! Here we go.

1170
01:00:23,157 --> 01:00:26,127
Ten, nine, eight,

1171
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,863
seven, six, five,

1172
01:00:28,996 --> 01:00:32,766
four, three, two, one.

1173
01:00:38,939 --> 01:00:40,441
Who's he?

1174
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,176
That's Jack.

1175
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:43,711
Hm. Is he single?

1176
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:46,080
I believe so.

1177
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,583
And employed.

1178
01:00:48,716 --> 01:00:50,619
And not an actor.

1179
01:00:52,587 --> 01:00:55,422
Well, in that case,
he'll be mine for Valentine's.

1186
01:01:21,148 --> 01:01:23,284
when was the last time
you've been on a carriage ride?

1187
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,787
It's been a while.

1188
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:29,223
What?

1189
01:01:29,757 --> 01:01:30,991
You afraid?

1190
01:01:39,433 --> 01:01:41,368
No. I'm not.

1191
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:49,370
You're all smiles today.

1192
01:02:49,503 --> 01:02:51,272
Thanks, Veronica.

1193
01:02:51,405 --> 01:02:53,642
Okay, so, you're not
gonna tell me about

1194
01:02:53,774 --> 01:02:55,409
how the other night went?

1195
01:02:55,543 --> 01:02:57,177
Oh.

1196
01:02:57,311 --> 01:02:59,280
I didn't think you cared.

1197
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:01,882
Why wouldn't I wanna
hear about your hot date

1198
01:03:02,016 --> 01:03:03,984
with the handsome
hometown hero?

1199
01:03:04,118 --> 01:03:07,788
I'm kidding.
Veronica, it went great.

1200
01:03:08,355 --> 01:03:10,424
Yes! What did you do?

1201
01:03:10,558 --> 01:03:13,494
Oh, we just walked around town.
We went antiquing.

1202
01:03:13,628 --> 01:03:15,229
We went skiing.

1203
01:03:15,362 --> 01:03:18,132
Um, he's not that great at it,
but that's okay.

1204
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:20,735
And then we ended up
at Blackthorn for dinner.

1205
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:22,336
Oh, that sounds amazing.

1206
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:24,204
Oh, did I tell you

1207
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:26,407
I have a date
to the Christmas gala?

1208
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:29,476
You did not.
Who are you going with?

1209
01:03:30,177 --> 01:03:31,713
Remember the parade yesterday?

1210
01:03:31,845 --> 01:03:33,314
The handsome firefighter.

1211
01:03:33,447 --> 01:03:35,650
Not yours,
but the other one.

1212
01:03:35,784 --> 01:03:37,719
Are you talking
about Jack Ryan?

1213
01:03:38,218 --> 01:03:39,587
Yeah.

1214
01:03:39,721 --> 01:03:41,790
Oh!

1215
01:03:41,922 --> 01:03:43,123
He is such a sweetheart.

1216
01:03:43,257 --> 01:03:44,759
Sounds like
Santa brought you

1217
01:03:44,925 --> 01:03:46,460
everything you asked for
this year.

1218
01:03:46,594 --> 01:03:48,162
He's a triple threat.

1219
01:03:48,295 --> 01:03:51,065
He has a car,
a job, and he's cute.

1220
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,002
I guess
I was really good this year.

1221
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,171
I would say.

1222
01:03:57,304 --> 01:03:58,707
So, what do I owe you?

1223
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:00,274
Don't worry about it.

1224
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:02,409
I'm assuming
the other drink is for Luke?

1225
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:04,512
Hm. Are you sure?

1226
01:04:04,646 --> 01:04:06,914
You do give me
a lot of free coffee.

1227
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,918
I mean, it's probably
not the best for business,

1228
01:04:11,051 --> 01:04:12,687
but you pay me in gossip.

1229
01:04:13,921 --> 01:04:15,255
Well, thank you.

1230
01:04:16,957 --> 01:04:18,058
You have a good one.

1231
01:04:18,192 --> 01:04:19,460
Thanks.

1232
01:04:21,763 --> 01:04:22,996
-Ah.
-Hi, Katie.

1233
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,766
-How are you today?
-Hi, Mr. Murphy.

1234
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:26,266
I'm doing great.

1235
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,803
Um, is Luke in?
He told me to meet him here.

1236
01:04:28,936 --> 01:04:30,871
Uh, no, yeah, he is.
He's just--

1237
01:04:31,004 --> 01:04:33,874
he ran to the print shop.
He's gonna be right back.

1238
01:04:34,007 --> 01:04:35,476
Come on into the office,
have a seat.

1239
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:38,078
Um, it's a new office,
it's kinda blah.

1240
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:39,947
Maybe you can
help me decorate it?

1241
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:44,051
So--
just a few more days

1242
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:45,820
until the big
Christmas gala.

1243
01:04:45,953 --> 01:04:47,689
Yep. Friday.

1244
01:04:48,188 --> 01:04:50,290
Ah, I just hope
enough people show up.

1245
01:04:50,424 --> 01:04:51,693
I'm a little nervous.

1246
01:04:51,826 --> 01:04:53,394
It's gonna be just fine.

1247
01:04:53,528 --> 01:04:55,563
In fact,
listenin' to Luke talk,

1248
01:04:55,697 --> 01:04:57,832
he thinks you're gonna be--

1249
01:04:57,965 --> 01:04:59,734
Hi. Can I help you?

1250
01:04:59,868 --> 01:05:01,201
Yes, uh, you wouldn't happen
to be Luke Murphy's father,

1251
01:05:01,335 --> 01:05:02,936
-would you?
-I am.

1252
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,572
Okay, um,
is he around anywhere?

1253
01:05:04,706 --> 01:05:06,140
Uh, he's not.

1254
01:05:06,273 --> 01:05:08,643
Oh, man.
Sorry, hey, my name's Tony.

1255
01:05:09,076 --> 01:05:10,444
I was stationed
with Luke in Riverside.

1256
01:05:10,578 --> 01:05:12,112
Hi, Tony.
Chief Richard Murphy.

1257
01:05:12,246 --> 01:05:13,648
-Nice to meet you.
-Very nice to meet you.

1258
01:05:13,782 --> 01:05:14,915
And I'm Katie, I'm his--

1259
01:05:15,048 --> 01:05:16,618
His, uh,
girlfriend, actually.

1260
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:18,252
Oh. Lucky guy.

1261
01:05:18,385 --> 01:05:20,053
Well, Luke told me
so much about you, so I figure

1262
01:05:20,187 --> 01:05:21,790
I would stop up here
and surprise him.

1263
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:24,324
Well, you know what,
I'm glad you did.

1264
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,493
He's not here right now,
but he's on his way back.

1265
01:05:26,628 --> 01:05:28,962
And, uh, what is it
you wanted to see Luke about?

1266
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:30,497
Uh, are you
staying for Christmas?

1267
01:05:30,632 --> 01:05:32,232
No, no, no,
I'm just here on business.

1268
01:05:32,366 --> 01:05:33,967
Oh,
what kind of business you in?

1269
01:05:34,101 --> 01:05:35,469
I'm with Bluth Consulting
in Chicago.

1270
01:05:35,603 --> 01:05:37,438
I just came
to finalize some paperwork,

1271
01:05:37,572 --> 01:05:39,239
and hopefully we can get it all
sorted out before Christmas.

1272
01:05:41,643 --> 01:05:42,777
F-finalize for what?

1273
01:05:43,477 --> 01:05:45,479
Oh, we're bringing him
on board as a sales exec.

1274
01:05:46,346 --> 01:05:47,948
Yeah, oh, he''s gonna be
a natural at it, man.

1275
01:05:48,081 --> 01:05:50,017
I mean, such a way
with words this guy has.

1276
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,985
Luke, in sales?

1277
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,621
Oh, he didn't tell you?

1278
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:55,222
Oh, this is a sweet gig.

1279
01:05:55,355 --> 01:05:56,524
I mean,
we're talkin' six figures.

1280
01:05:56,658 --> 01:05:58,025
Money is no issue.

1281
01:05:58,158 --> 01:05:59,993
He'll have to
relocate to Chicago.

1282
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:01,128
I'm sorry.

1283
01:06:01,261 --> 01:06:02,797
Moving to Chicago?

1284
01:06:04,097 --> 01:06:06,200
He hasn't told you--
Um, yeah, don't worry,

1285
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,001
I looked at
a bunch of properties for him

1286
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:10,872
and everything,
and I mean-- all luxury places.

1287
01:06:11,004 --> 01:06:12,272
Nice digs.

1288
01:06:13,474 --> 01:06:17,010
Uh-- I--
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

1289
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:18,212
Katie.

1290
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,448
Oh.
Is it somethin' I said?

1291
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:23,651
Uh, no,
it's not you.

1292
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:32,125
Hey, sorry I'm late!

1293
01:06:32,259 --> 01:06:34,696
I was getting some more flyers
printed out for the big event.

1294
01:06:36,631 --> 01:06:37,699
Katie!

1295
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:40,835
Is everything all right?

1296
01:06:40,969 --> 01:06:42,169
Luke.

1297
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:44,004
I can't
talk to you right now.

1298
01:06:46,473 --> 01:06:47,441
Katie!

1299
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:06,694
Katie.

1300
01:07:06,828 --> 01:07:08,495
Look, I am really sorry
to keep calling you,

1301
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:11,265
but this is all
just a big misunderstanding.

1302
01:07:12,132 --> 01:07:14,067
I can explain it all,
I promise.

1303
01:07:16,838 --> 01:07:20,140
Please. Call me back.

1304
01:07:56,678 --> 01:07:57,845
Hey.

1305
01:07:59,614 --> 01:08:00,648
Hey.

1306
01:08:01,716 --> 01:08:03,483
Thought I might
find you here.

1307
01:08:04,184 --> 01:08:05,452
Can I have a seat?

1308
01:08:05,987 --> 01:08:07,487
Luke, what do you want?

1309
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:11,291
Just to explain things.

1310
01:08:13,995 --> 01:08:16,463
Like, explain
how you're moving to Chicago?

1311
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:20,334
Well, I don't even know
if I'm gonna be doing that.

1312
01:08:20,902 --> 01:08:22,169
Look...

1313
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:24,438
Tony is an old friend,

1314
01:08:24,572 --> 01:08:26,841
and he hit me up about
a really good job opportunity.

1315
01:08:27,642 --> 01:08:29,677
But I never told him
I was gonna be taking it.

1316
01:08:30,645 --> 01:08:32,513
He just--
came in town,

1317
01:08:32,647 --> 01:08:34,247
tried to get me to sign on.

1318
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:36,818
Well, are you gonna take it?

1319
01:08:37,952 --> 01:08:39,854
I don't know.
I don't think so.

1320
01:08:41,154 --> 01:08:42,890
I just told him
I would hear him out.

1321
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:46,594
-But that was before.
-Before what?

1322
01:08:47,795 --> 01:08:48,963
I've been
getting to spend

1323
01:08:49,097 --> 01:08:50,364
all this time with you.

1324
01:08:51,231 --> 01:08:52,499
I'm really sorry.

1325
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:54,167
No.

1326
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:55,570
No, it's my fault.

1327
01:08:56,838 --> 01:08:59,607
I should've known better,
and I should've learned.

1328
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:02,476
Luke...

1329
01:09:03,111 --> 01:09:04,846
I loved you
when we were kids.

1330
01:09:06,648 --> 01:09:08,650
And I was heartbroken
when you left.

1331
01:09:10,518 --> 01:09:12,185
But I knew
it was important...

1332
01:09:12,854 --> 01:09:13,921
and I was happy for you.

1333
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,093
And now
that you're back in my life,

1334
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:21,896
and all those feelings.

1335
01:09:22,897 --> 01:09:23,931
Like--

1336
01:09:24,565 --> 01:09:26,266
it's like
something awoke in me,

1337
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,836
and I feel
like I'm 17 again.

1338
01:09:30,705 --> 01:09:34,075
I just-- I felt like there
was so much potential there.

1339
01:09:34,207 --> 01:09:35,475
Katie.

1340
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:37,945
I feel the same way.

1341
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:40,180
I really do.

1342
01:09:40,715 --> 01:09:43,685
Luke, you don't
even know what you want.

1343
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:46,688
I need
something dependable.

1344
01:09:47,622 --> 01:09:50,792
I need someone
that's gonna be around tomorrow

1345
01:09:50,925 --> 01:09:52,259
and ten years from now.

1346
01:09:52,392 --> 01:09:54,662
You can depend on me,
I swear.

1347
01:09:57,131 --> 01:09:58,398
I gotta go.

1348
01:10:01,035 --> 01:10:02,003
Katie, wait.

1349
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:24,357
You know,
I brag about you all the time.

1350
01:10:27,494 --> 01:10:28,963
-What?
-I do.

1351
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:32,499
To all my friends.
Have I ever told you that?

1352
01:10:33,701 --> 01:10:34,769
No.

1353
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:38,005
It's because
I'm so proud of the man

1354
01:10:38,139 --> 01:10:39,107
that you have grown into be.

1355
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:40,307
Thanks, Dad.

1356
01:10:40,808 --> 01:10:43,544
Luke, you have been
all around the world.

1357
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:45,646
You have seen things

1358
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,683
and done things
I can't imagine.

1359
01:10:50,184 --> 01:10:51,652
And now
you're back home again.

1360
01:10:51,786 --> 01:10:52,754
Small town.

1361
01:10:53,453 --> 01:10:56,456
And maybe this isn't where
you thought you would end up.

1362
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:58,425
Maybe it is,
I don't know.

1363
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,460
But I do know this.

1364
01:11:01,328 --> 01:11:02,429
Just down the road,

1365
01:11:02,563 --> 01:11:04,098
there is a woman
that loves you.

1366
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:07,501
-I don''t think she wants--
-Let me finish.

1367
01:11:08,903 --> 01:11:11,139
Now, you might think
that this kind of thing

1368
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:12,907
happens all the time.

1369
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,307
Love.

1370
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:17,477
Listen to me. It doesn't.

1371
01:11:18,846 --> 01:11:20,480
And while you're sittin' here

1372
01:11:20,615 --> 01:11:22,917
thinkin' that
love is gonna pass you by,

1373
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:25,520
and I really hope
that doesn't happen.

1374
01:11:27,255 --> 01:11:28,321
Because...

1375
01:11:28,823 --> 01:11:30,423
I''ll tell you this,

1376
01:11:30,558 --> 01:11:32,459
you're not gonna
get a third chance.

1377
01:11:34,896 --> 01:11:35,963
I gotta go.

1378
01:11:41,569 --> 01:11:42,804
Hey, Dad.

1379
01:11:43,704 --> 01:11:45,372
I think
I will go to the gala.

1380
01:11:47,575 --> 01:11:48,843
There he is.

1381
01:11:50,377 --> 01:11:52,713
If you're gonna
win her back--

1382
01:11:54,182 --> 01:11:55,482
do not dress like that.

1383
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:04,025
Well, you sure as fate
can't go dressed like that.

Mom,
I don't need a new car.

1389
01:12:23,711 --> 01:12:25,580
But wouldn't it be nice
if he has any shiny and new?

1390
01:12:25,713 --> 01:12:27,081
Hey, look,
it's Santa!

1391
01:12:27,215 --> 01:12:30,450
Olivia!

1392
01:12:30,585 --> 01:12:32,220
So nice to see you.

1393
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:33,486
You too.

1394
01:12:33,621 --> 01:12:34,789
-Have you been good?
-Mhm.

1395
01:12:34,922 --> 01:12:36,324
I've got somethin' for you.

1396
01:12:36,456 --> 01:12:38,458
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1397
01:12:38,593 --> 01:12:40,761
Oh, look,
Santa got me a gift!

1398
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:42,429
Wow, where do you think
that came from?

1399
01:12:42,563 --> 01:12:44,765
-I don't know.
-Hi, Katie!

1400
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:45,967
Hi, Santa.

1401
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,568
Been staying
out of trouble I hope?

1402
01:12:47,702 --> 01:12:49,270
Oh, gosh, yes.

1403
01:12:49,402 --> 01:12:50,605
I just come here today,

1404
01:12:50,738 --> 01:12:52,640
I've got
my new set of wheels.

1405
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:55,843
-Zero money down.
-Wow.

1406
01:12:55,977 --> 01:12:58,112
I still like my sleigh.

1407
01:12:58,246 --> 01:13:00,882
Well, I know
Olivia's very happy to see you.

1408
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:03,551
That reminds me,

1409
01:13:03,684 --> 01:13:05,418
there is this young man,

1410
01:13:05,553 --> 01:13:06,921
and he was, like,

1411
01:13:07,054 --> 01:13:08,956
really eager
that I give you this letter.

1412
01:13:09,422 --> 01:13:10,691
Oh.

1413
01:13:11,859 --> 01:13:12,927
Hm.

1414
01:13:17,765 --> 01:13:19,367
<i>Ten years ago,</i>

1415
01:13:19,499 --> 01:13:20,968
<i>I told you</i>
<i>that I'd be with you forever,</i>

1416
01:13:21,102 --> 01:13:22,370
<i>and I left.</i>

1417
01:13:22,502 --> 01:13:24,071
<i>You deserve</i>

1418
01:13:24,205 --> 01:13:26,607
<i>someone that's gonna</i>
<i>be there for you.</i>

1419
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:29,310
<i>I want this whole town.</i>
<i>I want Christmas.</i>

1420
01:13:29,442 --> 01:13:30,711
<i>I want all of it.</i>

1421
01:13:32,713 --> 01:13:35,583
<i>And I want us.</i>

1422
01:13:37,385 --> 01:13:40,254
Thank you, Santa.
I've got somewhere to be.

1423
01:13:40,388 --> 01:13:42,089
-And someone to see?
-Yes.

1424
01:13:42,223 --> 01:13:44,659
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

1425
01:13:47,395 --> 01:13:48,896
Are you ready?

1426
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:52,133
I'm just nervous.
I hope everyone shows up.

1427
01:13:53,234 --> 01:13:54,501
They will.

1428
01:13:57,071 --> 01:13:58,205
Oh, Olivia!

1429
01:13:58,773 --> 01:14:00,374
Katie, you look so pretty.

1430
01:14:00,508 --> 01:14:02,442
-So do you.
-Thank you.

1431
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:34,408
I would like to introduce--
Chaplain Silvers,

1432
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:35,910
to come and lead us

1433
01:14:36,043 --> 01:14:38,145
in an invocation
for the evening.

1434
01:14:38,879 --> 01:14:40,147
Thank you very much.

1435
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:43,250
Would you please bow in prayer
together with me tonight.

1436
01:14:44,618 --> 01:14:46,420
Our gracious,
heavenly Father.

1437
01:14:46,554 --> 01:14:48,456
You are so good to us.

1438
01:14:48,589 --> 01:14:49,824
We thank you
that you are the one

1439
01:14:49,957 --> 01:14:51,692
that provides joy
in our souls,

1440
01:14:51,826 --> 01:14:54,462
the pep in our step,
and the song in our hearts.

1441
01:14:54,595 --> 01:14:56,163
And so, we gather tonight,

1442
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:59,433
as we strive
to raise the resources

1443
01:14:59,567 --> 01:15:01,969
necessary for
a relocation project

1444
01:15:02,103 --> 01:15:04,538
for the historic
Holly Union Depot.

1445
01:15:04,672 --> 01:15:06,140
Amen.

1446
01:15:23,691 --> 01:15:25,393
-Hi, Katie.
-Thank you, Richard.

1447
01:15:25,526 --> 01:15:26,627
You're welcome.

1448
01:15:27,061 --> 01:15:29,230
Hey, mom,
if you''re out there,

1449
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:30,431
could you come up here?

1450
01:15:30,564 --> 01:15:31,999
I wanna share this with you.

1451
01:15:40,207 --> 01:15:42,643
First off,
thank you all for coming.

1452
01:15:42,777 --> 01:15:44,011
Anyone that knows me knows

1453
01:15:44,145 --> 01:15:46,814
that I am such
a fan of history.

1454
01:15:46,947 --> 01:15:48,149
It's so important to me,

1455
01:15:48,282 --> 01:15:49,884
and I am humbled
to look out there

1456
01:15:50,017 --> 01:15:52,686
and see so many
that feel the same.

1457
01:15:53,522 --> 01:15:54,789
We did it!

1458
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:56,757
We raised the money!

1459
01:15:57,725 --> 01:15:59,460
Thank you all so much.

1460
01:16:03,297 --> 01:16:06,667
And now, to celebrate,
Katie will be singing us a song

1461
01:16:06,801 --> 01:16:09,904
with Aaron Turner
and the Steel Horse Band.

1462
01:16:10,037 --> 01:16:13,240
-No, no, no.
-Yes. You will be.

1463
01:16:13,374 --> 01:16:14,675

Look!

01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,101
Oh!

1524
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:39,873
Hi, Santa.

1525
01:20:49,551 --> 01:20:52,252
Good job, Cupid.
Let's go home.

1526
01:21:04,365 --> 01:21:06,033
And from your favorite
country radio station,

1527
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:08,202
I'm Holly Hutton,
and to recap:

1528
01:21:08,335 --> 01:21:10,471
Cupid has been
reunited with Santa.

1529
01:21:10,605 --> 01:21:13,708
The Holly Union Depot
has been saved and all is well

1530
01:21:13,842 --> 01:21:15,142
in the town of Holly.

1531
01:21:15,275 --> 01:21:18,412
Now, we have got
brand new music for you

1532
01:21:18,546 --> 01:21:19,781
from our very own.

1533
01:21:19,913 --> 01:21:21,415

1537
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:35,963
Hey, Santa.

1538
01:21:36,096 --> 01:21:37,398
Thanks for that
sweet deal on that ride.

1539
01:21:37,532 --> 01:21:39,567
-It's amazing.
-Oh, great.

1540
01:21:39,701 --> 01:21:41,468
Cindy in finance
is going to take care of you.

1541
01:21:41,603 --> 01:21:43,772
-You're all set.
-Look like I'm going to Utah!

1542

Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

1543
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:47,575
Santa,
I gotta tell you,

1544
01:21:47,709 --> 01:21:48,843
after one week on the job,

1545
01:21:48,976 --> 01:21:50,645
these numbers
are impressive.

1546
01:21:50,779 --> 01:21:52,413
If we can get the Easter Bunny
and the Tooth Fairy in here,

1547
01:21:52,547 --> 01:21:53,947
we could set
some new records.

1548
01:21:54,081 --> 01:21:55,416
Wow, I get
my picture on the wall?

1549
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:58,185
-Yes, sir.
