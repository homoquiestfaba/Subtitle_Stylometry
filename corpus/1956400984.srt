Ah, just like clockwork.

your pants on.

After a long day at the office,

you're tired, lots
of stress.

10

You need some place where you
can get out of your clothes

and slip into something
comfortable.

12

- Who's this?

13

- That is my wife.

14

She had a stroke
2 years ago, her 2nd.

15

She slipped into a coma.

irreversible.

mourned her, and I want to move
on with the rest of my life.

that's heartless?

life insurance from him.

- Thanks. Here, I've got another
job for you.
- Yeah.

- The wife wants to catch her
husband in the act.

she gets off on confrontations.

me to get you licensed

- Short version: I am married,
but it's not working,

166
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,451
hasn't been for a long time,
and it's not going to.

167
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,721
Still want to invite me in?

168
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:52,358
- I'll let you decide.

169
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,976
Not here.

170
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:55,287
- It's nice, cozy.

171
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:10,536
You're going to have to cut me
some slack. I'm a bit out
of practice.

172
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,742
- Max! I knew it.

173
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,782
Why? Why?

174
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:28,053
I tried everything
for you, Max.

175
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,689
What more do you want from me?

176
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,659
What?

177
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:37,129
What?
- Just relax, Mr. Gardner.

178
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,366
You've got enough problems on
your hands.

179
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,804
I'm a private
investigator. Erin.

180
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:55,180
- Erin!

181
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:59,485
- Why don't you have a seat and
relax, Mr. Gardner?

182
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,520
Take a seat.

183
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,738
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

184
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,740
- Look, don't get down on
yourself just because

185
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:26,678
some dip got caught with his
hand in the honey pot.

186
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:31,750
- I know, Jack. Maybe we just
make it too easy for them.

187
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,319
- What, do you think this guy
wasn't dirty before?

188
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:38,457
Look, I don't even get a call
unless the problem is
too big to ignore.

189
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,161
- Have you ever
cheated on your wife, Jack?

190
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:46,832
- No, not the first one.

191
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,635
Of course, we were only together
for a couple of months.

192
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:53,772
The other two,
you know, I don't know.

193
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:58,210
A couple, 3 times, maybe just
sports sex, it didn't
mean anything.

194
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:03,482
- Men are such jerks.
- It's chemical,
and in this study

195
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:08,720
they injected these women
with testosterone.

196
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:13,292
The only thing these babes
wanted to do was go out
and get laid.

197
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,196
- Do any women buy into this
load of crap?

198
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:21,400
- No, they're too busy blaming
their bitchiness on PMS.

199
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,903
- That's a good one,
ha, ha, ha.

200
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,474
- You know, I've been told I
give the best hand massage in
the whole state.

201
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:32,578
Here, give me your hand.

202
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,815
How does that feel?
- Good.

203
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:40,919
Buy me another one?

204
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,957
- No, I think
you've had enough.

205
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,392
- Oh no. What, are you
my father?

206
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,461
- If that works for you.

207
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:53,465
- My father was a bastard.

208
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,635
- So am I.

209
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:02,674
- Hmm... Jack.
- Yeah.

210
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,950
- Maybe I've had a little too
much to drink.

211
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,854
Thanks for the drink.

212
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,330
- Hey...

213
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,433
why don't you come by the office
tomorrow or the next day?

214
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:32,471
I have something for you.
It won't be like tonight.

215
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,515
That's smooth, Jack,
that's real smooth.

216
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,986
- All's fair in love and war,

217
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,758
and business is war. Don't let
anybody tell you different.

218
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,260
- So what do I have to do
to get ahead?

219
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,262
- Sleep with the boss.

220
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,032
- The boss is married.

221
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,702
- How badly do you want
to get ahead?

222
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,908
- Erin, what a surprise.
What's it been:

223
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:14,846
2-3 weeks? Mind if I sit down?
- I don't believe we know
each other.

224
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,350
I'm Dale Williams.
- I see you're working again.
- She works for me.

225
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,987
- Is that right?
What exactly do you do?

226
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,657
- We were just discussing that.

227
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,926
And if you don't mind, this is
sort of a private dinner.
- That's okay.

228
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,530
Erin owes me a dinner.
- Max, why don't I call you?

229
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,999
We could get together a little
bit later in the week, huh?

230
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:37,936
- You don't
have my phone number.
- You could give it to me.

231
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,307
- Mm. I don't think so.
- The lady said she'd call you,
so why don't you take off?

232
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,978
- How's your wife Dale?
You are married, aren't you?

233
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,380
- What business is that
of yours?

234
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,350
- It's not my business.
It's hers.
- Do you know this nut?

235
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,852
- I'm sorry, no, I don't...
- Didn't she give you a resume?

236
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,923
She must have left out
the part about working for
the detective agency.

237
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:02,628
Did you leave that out again?
- What's he talking about?
- I'm really not sure.

238
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,963
- Tell him, honey. Tell him how
the wives hire you to set up
their hubbies.

239
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:10,502
How you record them on that
microphone you've got hidden.

240
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:15,374
Where exactly do you hide
that microphone?

241
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:20,512
- Look, I was just kidding
about... you know.

242
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,581
I knew who you were
all along.

243
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,685
I was just playing
a little joke.

244
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,855
I love my wife.

245
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,499
You're fired.

246
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,776
- So, what am I having?

247
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,517
Good choice.
I hope you can afford this.

248
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,619
- What do you want, Max?
- It must have been a lot

249
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,621
of fun seeing the look on my
face the other night.

250
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,724
Do you go home, compare notes
with your friends,
have a good laugh?

251
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:09,094
- Hey, I wasn't the one
cheating on my wife.

252
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:12,964
- No, but I didn't lie. I didn't
tell you I was someone I wasn't,

253
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,668
and I didn't set you up.

254
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,759
Erin!

255
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,794

[Scared]: Ah! Ah!

260
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,978
- Don't shoot!
It's me! It's Max!

261
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,514
- You tried to kill me!

262
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,950
- What? No way!

263
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,654
- You're lying.
- Erin, put down the gun.

264
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,557
- You're lying.
- I was looking for you
to apologize.

265
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,561
I saw you run in the alleyway.

266
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,563
Look, if you don't
believe me,

267
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,731
go to the car and call
the police.

268
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:34,239
Erin. Please.

269
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:39,077
You're hurt, you're hurt.
Let me help you.

270
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,915
Erin. Erin.

271
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:47,252
Now. Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay, it's okay,

272
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,921
it's okay.

Here, it's okay.
Come on, come on.

274
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,232
I'll get you to
the hospital. Come on.

275
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,834
- Just take me home.

276
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,936
I want to go home.

277
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,713
Thanks for the ride.

278
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:18,617
- You could be in shock. Maybe I
should stay for a few minutes
just to make sure.

279
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,920
- My roommate will be home
any minute.

Hello.
- [Male voice]: Hi Erin,
who's your friend?

282
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:46,378
- I told you not to call
anymore.
[ Caller chuckles ]

- Sorry, you okay?

285
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:59,157
- It's just
an old boyfriend.

286
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,327
- Why don't you go get cleaned
up? I'll fix you a drink.

287
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,387
Your drink's
on the coffee table.

How are you feeling?

289

- Oh my God, he was trying
to kill me.

290
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:47,072
- We should call the police.
- And tell them what? I didn't
see anything.

291
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,307
- What about the car? Did you
get a good look at the car?

292
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:52,677
- Only that it was the same
colour as yours.

293
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,317
How did you know I would be at
that restaurant?

294
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:03,989
You followed me?

295
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:07,959
- I just wanted the chance to
explain about my marriage.

296
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:11,029
- Look, if you're going to give
me that bit about how your wife
doesn't understand you,

297
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,031
just do me a favour and save us
both the time, okay?

298
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:16,134
- It's more like I don't
understand her.

299
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:22,107
Over the last year or so, she's
become so paranoid, jealous.

300
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,712
I have never cheated on my wife.

301
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:32,851
You would have been the first.
- Am I supposed
to feel flattered?

302
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,820
- No. Look, I liked you.

303
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,456
You need to hear a bit.

304
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,227
My marriage has been over for
a long, long time.

305
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,998
I built our ad agency from a
struggling shop to
a top boutique.

306
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,000
Dina's the largest
shareholder.

307
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,903
- Well, sounds like you
shouldn't have any problem
getting another job.

308
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,873
- Sure, if I want to walk away
from millions of dollars.

309
00:27:54,906 --> 00:28:00,078
The agency is about
to be sold.

310
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:04,449
If we're married, I get half; if
we're divorced, not a penny.

311
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,985
That's why she hired you.

312
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,522
She needed the grounds
to sue for divorce.

313
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:14,292
- Okay. Well then Max, if your
wife's so jealous,

314
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:18,029
why doesn't she just give
you a divorce?

315
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:21,332
- I know this is going to sound
crazy, but I think she believes

316
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:25,870
that if I'm desperate enough,
I'll come crawling back to her.

317
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:30,341
You don't trust anyone, do you?

318
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:37,415
- Max, I have decoyed
52 married men.

319
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:42,787
Out of them, 49 tried to sleep
with me and everyone
had a story.

- That still leaves 3.

321
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:51,796
- One was gay. I imagine the
other two had equally
compelling reasons.

322
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,332
- So all men are lying
lecherous bastards?
- Hmm.

323
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:58,870
- What was it? A lousy marriage
or a crappy childhood?

324
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,907
- Ooh, advertising by day,
psychology by night.

325
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,956
- I guess I didn't do a very
good job at patching things up.

326
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,961
Don't suppose we could try
dinner again?

00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:30,468
- Jack has this silly policy
about dating his clients'
husbands.

328
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:33,338
- Yeah.

329
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,340
Goodnight.

330
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,375
- Goodnight.

331
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:52,390
- Erin! Erin!
Wake up, wake up!

332
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,396
Your agent is on
the phone. Get up!

333
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:03,134
She has a job for
you today!

334
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,870
Come on, come on, come on.

335
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm serious.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yahoo!

336
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:14,179
Iceberg Cove,
more chill, less fill.

337
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,619
- And cut...

338
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,922
that was great,
Erin! That's great.

339
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:27,225
- Thank you.

340
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:30,228
- I'm almost glad our lead
actress got sick.

341
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,630
I want your agent to call me,
okay? I have some other
projects coming up.

342
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,000
- Okay, great. Well, listen, I
really, really appreciate
the opportunity.

343
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,570
- Don't thank me, thank him.
He's the one who found
your photo.

344
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,605
Got to go, babe.

345
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:02,293
- You stole my headshot?
- I never said I was a choirboy.

346
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:07,031
- Well, this doesn't
change anything.

347
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:11,102
And don't expect me to
feel obligated in any way.

348
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,339
- I don't play casting couch
games. If you weren't right, you
wouldn't be here, okay?

349
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,009
- Okay.

350
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,445
- Good. How about dinner?

351
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,147
- Oh, God!

352
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,056
- That's a yes?

353
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,631
You look good as a bear.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

354
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:45,103
- Where'd you say we were
eating again?
- I didn't. It's a surprise.

355
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:50,441
- You're kidding, right?
- Look, I know this is hard for
you, but try to trust me.

356
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,519
- Wow!

357
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,660
- I've been working on it for
the past 2 years.

358
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,662
I still have lots to do.

359
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:16,200
- Oh my God, how did you ever
find this place?

360
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:20,338
- Actually, it belonged to my
grandfather about a million
years ago.

361
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,408
He was a painter.

362
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:28,212
This was his studio.

363
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,214
- Are all of these yours?

364
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,250
- Yes.

365
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,493
- You're very talented.

366
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,169
- This one is giving me
some troubles.

367
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:54,372
- I think it's coming
along beautifully.

368
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,675
Did your grandfather
teach you how to paint?

369
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:01,379
- He taught me how to see.

370
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,381
When I was 9, I could draw an
exact likeness.

371
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:06,184
You would have been impressed.

372
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,787
Everyone was,
except for my grandfather.

373
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,391
He said my drawings
were lifeless,

374
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,127
that I had missed the shadows
within the shadows.

375
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,565
You see, if I would have
drawn you then,

376
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:24,369
I would have neglected the
darkening below your cheekbone.

377
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:28,373
It's almost subliminal. And
there's the fairest highlights,

378
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:33,044
tightness in the muscle, the tug
in your laugh line.

379
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:40,785
- I was working 2 waitress jobs,
and just wasn't making
ends meet.

380
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,787
- A lot of lousy tippers?

381
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,124
- A lot of bills.

382
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:50,395
So anyway, I saw this ad
in Backstage:

383
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:54,832
good money, plenty
of time for acting.

384
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:59,404
Still, I wasn't really sure I
wanted to do it.

385
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,473
Then Jack explained to me how
normal surveillance usually
takes months.

386
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,509
It could cost a woman thousands,
and then they might

387
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:09,347
not even know for sure.
With a decoy,

388
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,683
within a few weeks, they
know for sure.

389
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,453
- What about the guy
that's say, 45,

390
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:19,891
been bald since he was 15,
married the first woman that
ever smiled at him

391
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:24,228
who somehow gains 6 dress sizes
on their honeymoon?

392
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,431
Now, out of his fantasy
steps you:

393
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,433
the kind of woman who makes
men buy beer.

394
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:34,338
Do you ever wonder that it might
be you, and not him?

395
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,642
- It's not like that, because
let me tell you something.

396
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:41,779
Women are infinitely better at
deceiving themselves
than any man.

397
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,786
I watched my mother do it,
and when he finally had the
decency to leave us,

398
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,523
I watched her crawl into a bed
and stay there for 2 years.

399
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:58,362
So yeah, yeah, I get paid to
test fidelity, and
you know what?

400
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:03,935
Most men cheat, but at least
their wives won't have
to wonder anymore.

401
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,537
- I know this is hard for you
right now,

402
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:11,442
but there are relationships
that work.

403
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:18,516
Built on trust.
- Yeah,

404
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,352
I think there's a museum
with one.

405
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:28,693
- You're a hard case,
Ms. Greer.

406
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,932
- It doesn't stop, does it Max?

407
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,169
It just never stops.

408
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,219
- I'm sorry about tonight.
- It's okay.

409
00:35:55,253 --> 00:36:00,324
- The only other time she was at
the loft, she refused to
get out of the car.

410
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,895
- Everything happens
for a reason.

411
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:08,332
- I guess
I'm not invited in.

412
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,368
- You're invited...

413
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:16,440
when you're a free man.

414
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,876
- That could be 6 months,
maybe more.

415
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,912
- It'll test your character.

416
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,624
I loved the picnic.

417
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,960
- I want to see you again.

418
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:40,398
- Make it soon.

419
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,433
Goodnight.

420
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,940
[To herself]: Erin, Erin, Erin,
what are you doing?

421
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:54,278
Jack is so going to kill me.

422
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,381
- When you break the rules, you
don't screw around, huh?
[ Knocking ]

423
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:01,919
- I meant in a couple of days.

424
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,388
What are you doing... Jack!

425
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,858
What are you doing here?
- You should check
your messages.

426
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,062
- I was out.
- So I noticed.

427
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,699
- What's up?

428
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,602
- Come on, we've got to go.
We'll talk about it in the car.

429
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,574
- Later.
- Later.

430
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,020
- Oh my God! Denise.

431
00:37:56,007 --> 00:38:00,444
- What's going on, D?
- All we know for sure is that
she was stabbed 5 times.

432
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,614
No murder weapon. The perp must
have taken it. Her pocketbook
wasn't touched,

433
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:07,718
nothing was missing from her
apartment, and there was
no sign of a break in.

434
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:12,990
We're guessing she knew him.
- It had to have been Jimmy. He
was always beating her up.

435
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,093
- Yeah, so I heard. We got an
APB out on him.
- Good.

436
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,497
- Just for the record: where
were the two of you last night
between 9 and 11?

437
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,366
- What are you, kidding?
- Come on, Deaton,
you know the drill.

438
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,903
- I can't even remember what I
had for breakfast.
- Ms. Greer?

439
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:30,007
- I was out.
- With?

440
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:34,745
- A friend.
- And your friend can
verify that?

441
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,581
- Yeah.

442
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:42,420
- Something else, Ms. Greer?
- I've been getting threatening
phone calls lately,

443
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,892
and last night someone tried to
run me down.

444
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,028
- Did you report it?

445
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:54,632
- No, I didn't see the driver.
- Did you recognize the car?

446
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,934
- No.
- Do you have any enemies you
can think of?

447
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,036
A dispute over
a parking space, anything?

448
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,605
- No.
- What about this guy, Jimmy?

449
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,809
Did you have words with him?
An argument?
- I barely even know him.

450
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,778
- All right, it may just be a
coincidence. But just to be
safe, don't go out alone.

451
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,781
My first thing tomorrow morning
I want you to come in and
fill out a report.

452
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:14,652
I'll put a trace on your
phone and Jack...
- Yeah.

453
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,788
- If you can remember what
2-buck hooker took pity
on you last night,

454
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,157
give me a call, all right?
- No, I got it now.

455
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:24,061
It was your wife.
- She's all yours.

456
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,530
- Excuse me.

457
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,532
- We have a lot to talk about,
you and I.

458
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,935
- Oh, would you give me a break,
Jack? I just found out Denise
was murdered.

459
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:34,071
- I want to know
what's going on.
- Nothing.

460
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,908
Look, I didn't want to tell you
because I was afraid you
wouldn't let me work.

461
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:41,779
- You're damn right
you're not working.
- You know...

462
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,981
You know I need the money.
- You need money?

463
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:48,819
Fine. Here.
- Come on, Jack.
- Take it.

464
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,821
- Not like that.
- It's a gift,

465
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,691
and you're staying with me until
we find this guy.

466
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,828
- This is exactly what I'm
talking about. I don't need you
to take care of me, Jack.

467
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,831
- What, did you find someone
else to do the job? Huh?

468
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:05,803
- Maybe I have.
- Oh wait, now let me guess.

469
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:08,839
His wife has an
irreversible coma.

470
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,742
- Screw you.

471
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:18,115
- I'm trying to tell you
something here, Erin. This guy
is bad news.

472
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,117
- You don't know that.
- Oh the hell I don't.

473
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:25,256
I've been dealing with scumbags
like him for 20 years.

474
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,792
- You're jealous.

475
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,027
- You're talking crazy, here, is
what you're talking now.

476
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,831
- No, you are.
You're jealous.

477
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,902
- Where you going?
- To find a cab.

478
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,272
- Just get in
the damn car.

479
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:46,510
Look, just get in the
car... please.

480
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:01,225
- I'm not going
to stop seeing him.

481
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:06,263
- Look, why don't you come
by the office

482
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:10,701
next week because I've got some
files that need to be
cleaned out?

483
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:14,905
- You know, it started out as
such a good day.

484
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,608
I got my first commercial.

485
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,311
- Ah, I guess you won't be
working for me for too much
longer then, huh?

486
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:25,916
- No, no, I didn't... I mean,
it's... it's only a local.

for my money. I should
have realized that

675

when he threatened to call off
the engagement

676
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:17,233
after my father insisted on a
prenuptial agreement.

677
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,235
But I was in love.

678
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,138
- But he signed the agreement?

679
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,707
- He had no choice. If he
refused, my father would have
cut me out of the will.

680
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,910
- So, why don't you just give
him some money and get out of
the marriage?

681

- I offered him money, Ms.
Greer, but he's refused!

682

divorce, you could get one.

in this state.

684
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:37,754
There's only four reasons for a
contested divorce and you've got
to prove them:

imprisonment--

686

wasting my money here.

my word.

of protection.

ever try to divorce him, he
would try to kill me.

Do you know that my father
was murdered,

693

Ms. Greer? He was on a
business trip,

694
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:12,155
and someone broke into his hotel
suite, and smashed

695
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:17,894
his skull in with a lamp. Max
was in the adjoining room. Slept
through the whole thing,

696
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:21,197
or so he says.

697
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:27,170
And my lawyer has filed for the
necessary papers and has issued
a temporary restraining order.

698
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:33,076
But I believe that once my
husband gets wind of this,
despite what your subordinate

699
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:36,579
may think, my husband will try
to kill me.

01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:42,023
Wait! Erin!

980
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:49,664
Wait! Ah!

981
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:52,701
- Leave me alone!
- Erin!

982
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:59,207
Erin!

983
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:09,050
Erin!

984
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:14,823
Come on, Erin.

985
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:20,695
Erin, I don't know what's
gotten into you.

986
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:25,700
I just want to talk. Tell me
what happened.

987
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:47,589
Erin, this is crazy.

988
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:50,592
Erin, wait!

989
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:55,630
Don't sell me out!

990
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,070
Erin!

991
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:33,768
Erin, why are
you hiding?

992
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:35,770
I'm not going to
hurt you.

993
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,772
This is a
big misunderstanding.

994
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:41,342
Can we just talk
about it?

995
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:44,212
This is getting ridiculous.

996
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,702
Erin!

997
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:18,446
Erin, are you hurt? Come on,
speak to me.

998
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:25,553
Ow! What are
you doing?

999
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:28,656
Erin.

1000
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:39,534
Erin!

1001
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:41,536
Erin.

1002
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:46,241
- Don't you come near me, Max!
- Erin, don't.

1003
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:50,378
- I know all about you, Max.

1004
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:53,314
You killed Denise, you
killed Parker,

1005
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:55,583
you tried to kill me.

1006
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:58,987
- That's not true.
- Last night you said you were
here, but you weren't.

1007
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:02,657
I called you back.
- I was downstairs waiting for
my lawyer.

1008
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:05,994
- Stop lying!
- No, we went to dinner, we
discussed the divorce.

1009
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:08,429
I told him I didn't care about
the money.

1010
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:10,698
I just want to be with
you. Please!

1011
01:26:10,732 --> 01:26:12,867
Put down the gun.

1012
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:15,737
[ Door shutting above ]
- Help!

1013
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:17,805
Help me!

1014
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:19,874
Over here.

1015
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:22,810
- You can justify anything here,
but not here.

1016
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,846
- Stay back, stay back.

1017
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:29,484
- Look at me. What do you feel?

1018
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:32,487
- No.

1019
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,290
- I love you.

1020
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:38,026
- Stay back.

1021
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:40,361
- Do what you have to.

1022
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:03,484
- Ah!

1023
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:13,795
- I didn't have a choice.

1024
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:17,632
She was going to
kill you.

1025
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:26,841
It's okay.

1026
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:36,484
- Yeah, you're kidding.

1027
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:38,720
- [Julie]: No, I'm not. So what
about Jack?

1028
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:41,556
- Jack took the plea bargain.
He's going to get six months.

1029
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:43,558
- Hey, I've got to go. My doctor
just walked in.

1030
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:47,395
- You are so crazy.

1031
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:50,098
- I can't help it.
- I love you.

1032
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:52,433
- Me too.
- See you first thing in the
morning, okay?

1033
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:57,505
- Okay. Bye.
- All right, bye.

1034
01:27:57,538 --> 01:28:00,074
- How's Julie doing?

1035
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,744
- She's great.
She got asked

1036
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:08,116
out by 2 doctors. She said if
she knew that, she would have
gotten stabbed months ago.

1037
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:13,354
What?

1038
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:15,456
- I just...

1039
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:18,526
if it wasn't for me,
Denise, Julie.

1040
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:21,429
- Hey, Denise brought
this on herself.

1041
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:27,101
She was blackmailing
Dina. They found the
cancelled cheques.

1042
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:31,706
- What about Parker? She
killed him to frame me,

1043
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:34,709
to keep us apart. If I'd just
made a clean break, I...

1044
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:36,711
- Max, she was sick.

1045
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:41,783
Stop beating yourself up over
this, okay?

1046
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:47,488
Thank you for not giving
up on me.

1047
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:51,426
- Thank you for not
shooting me.

1048
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:54,662
- How did you know
I wouldn't?

1049
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:59,701
- I didn't. I just knew that
if we couldn't be together,
I didn't care.

1050
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:13,014
Why didn't you shoot me?
It couldn't have been
trust, could it?

1051
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:16,050
- Maybe.

1052
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,957
Well, when I was pointing
the gun at you...

1053
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:31,532
I don't know, it didn't feel
real. I mean, it felt like I was
playing a part,

1054
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:35,470
like when I was decoying.

1055
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:38,639
And I looked at you,

1056
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:43,411
I really, really looked
at you.

1057
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:51,919
I guess I saw the light in the
shadows of the shadows.

1058
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:54,989
Now, kiss me.

1059
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:06,501
Ow! My leg.

- Ow, my leg!
- Ow, my leg!
