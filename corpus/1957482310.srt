1
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,686
{\an8}<i>Danny? Stop it.</i>

2
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:28,688
{\an8}<i>Can't you be
more gentle?</i>

3
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:32,775
{\an8}<i>You love it, don't you?
- You know I do, but...</i>

4
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:33,985
{\an8}<i>be gentle.</i>

5
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:38,556
{\an8}<i>I just get impatient.
How can we maybe get engaged</i>

6
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:41,346
{\an8}<i>and maybe get married.
I'm not sure if you're allowed.</i>

7
00:00:41,346 --> 00:00:44,579
{\an8}<i>You can be sure.
- Then prove it.</i>

8
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:46,789
{\an8}<i>Danny, I said "stop it!"</i>

9
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,317
{\an8}<i>Ow! Ooh! Ouch!</i>

10
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:52,536
{\an8}<i>Put that thing back!
- You gotta cut the zipper!</i>

11
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:54,552
{\an8}<i>Wait, here!  Let me help!</i>

12
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:56,591
{\an8}<i>No, wait, that's not it!
No, don't!</i>

13
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:00,665
{\an8}<i>Oh, yes! Yes!</i>

14
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:10,938
{\an8}<i>Yes, I coming!</i>

15
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:13,149
{\an8}<i>I'm coming!  Oh!
Talk about it!</i>

16
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:16,949
{\an8}<i>Can we stop?!
- Are you crazy?!</i>

17
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:21,323
{\an8}<i>I'm coming!
- Stop!  Will you please stop!</i>

18
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:22,575
{\an8}<i>I'm coming!
- Here! Stop it!  Stop it!</i>

19
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:30,996
{\an8}<i>You just don't understand.
You're tearing me apart</i>

20
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:33,962
{\an8}<i>with your empty promises.
That's all I ever get from you.</i>

21
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:37,048
{\an8}<i>Yeah, your kisses are hot,
but your heart is cold.</i>

22
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,217
{\an8}<i>I have got no more
tears left to cry for you.</i>

23
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:43,304
{\an8}<i>You will never be faithful
to me, I know you won't.</i>

24
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:47,651
{\an8}<i>That's not true, Jeremy.
I'll change.  I promise, I will.</i>

25
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:54,232
{\an8}<i>Hey, this your first time, lover?
- No, no, no, I've had some experience.</i>

26
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:55,563
{\an8}<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

27
00:01:55,563 --> 00:02:00,169
{\an8}Give me an extra $20 and
you're going to get the experience.

28
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,297
Hey, what's that?

29
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:23,511
Hey, did you hear that?

30
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:33,105
No! Not the car!
It's my dad's car!

31
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:06,712
Any veggie burgers left?
- Too late. Sorry, all gone.

32
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:08,848
Shit, I knew we'd
be too late.

33
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:11,809
What took you guys so long? Medical
examiner wants to see you right away.

34
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:14,398
Come on Joe.
- Oh, no.

35
00:03:14,398 --> 00:03:15,892
Come on, Joe!
We gotta go together.

36
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:17,815
I just want a cup of coffee, Sweeney.
Black, no sugar.

37
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:19,317
It's real bad this time.

38
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:21,819
The most disgusting thing
I've ever seen.

39
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:23,362
Just one more coffee...
- Joe!

40
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,198
A young boy saw the whole thing.
Come on!

41
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:29,142
Joe, we are the investigating officers
in this case.

42
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,504
Joe, we gotta go over to the
murder scene.

43
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:32,622
It's our job.

44
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:35,583
I... I... I need a cigarette,
Sweeney, please.

45
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,835
It won't be so bad,
big guy.

46
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:40,681
<i>This time he took
her brain.</i>

47
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:42,431
Oh, boy.
- Easy, Joe.

48
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,509
Popped that baby
right out of there.

49
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:51,613
It looks like he used a scoop.
You know, like for ice cream or something.

50
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:02,151
Three times this week.
You're bad, Birdwell.

51
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:04,487
25 big ones you owe me.

52
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,031
Sweeney!

53
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:11,285
Take a closer look in there.
- Hey!  Don't bother me.

54
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:14,747
Wait...

55
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,042
What's that?

56
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:35,309
Hey Blocker, take
a look at this!

57
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:36,769
So what is that?

58
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:54,484
Turn it off!

59
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:03,224
<i>It's a note...</i>

60
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:05,506
<i>A paper.
- A piece of paper?</i>

61
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:07,675
<i>It's a note?</i>

62
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:08,968
<i>What's it say?</i>

63
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:11,220
<i>I don't know! I can't read it.</i>

64
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:14,890
Some kind of funny writing
with little ducks and frogs.

65
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,894
It's Egyptian writing.
Hieroglyphics.

66
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,980
I knew that!

67
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:29,739
How you feelin', Joe?
Better?

68
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:33,034
Did you lose money again?
- Yeah...

69
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:35,870
Sorry.
- What the hell.

70
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:38,205
We're partners!

71
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:40,791
<i>Take it easy!
Easy kid!</i>

72
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:44,712
That face...
dark sunglasses...

73
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:48,105
Take it easy, buddy!  Can
you remember anything else?

74
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,831
Just the hat.
- Hat?

75
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:54,325
Yes, he had on a funny hat!
- Alright now kid just calm down.

76
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:55,949
Just a few more minutes.

77
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:58,059
Joe, go and get the book!
- Now kid...

78
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:04,023
If we showed you some pictures, do you
think you could give us a positive I.D.?

79
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:06,400
I'll try, officer.
- Alright now.

80
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:08,986
Kid...

81
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:13,949
if you recognize any one
of these pictures... speak up.

82
00:06:17,203 --> 00:06:18,120
No.

83
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,623
<i>No.  No.</i>

84
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:26,177
<i>No.  No.  No.</i>
That's not it.

85
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:29,100
<i>No.  No.
No... no.</i>

86
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:30,216
Ah! There!

87
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:33,094
There!  That's the hat!
That's the hat!

88
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,159
There! There!
Look!

89
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:38,061
Look! The hat!

90
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:40,661
The hat!  Look!

91
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:42,579
The hat!
- We see it, son!

92
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:43,538
No, no! There!
There!

93
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:45,481
No, there!
There!

94
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,490
There!
- I said we see it!

95
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:51,237
Okay, be careful with him, officer.
No brutality!

96
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:52,530
<i>The hat!</i>

97
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:54,281
He's alright.

98
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:56,075
Not a bad kid.

99
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:58,119
An Egyptian fez.

100
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:01,288
What do you make of that, Joe?

101
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:05,676
I'm gonna get Deek Taylor in on this.

102
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:09,453
Deek Taylor?
- Yeah, my partner from Vegas.

103
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:11,090
Do you remember Deek Taylor?
- Sure.

104
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:12,666
But he's in Las Vegas.

105
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:15,362
I know he's in Las Vegas.
That is the point.

106
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:18,973
There was a similar string of
murders twelve years ago in Vegas.

107
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,863
Lots of girls murdered.
Parts of their bodies taken.

108
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:23,018
Wait a second.

109
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:26,772
What kind of parts?
- The first one had her finger cut off.

110
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,956
And the second?
- Had her toes clipped off with pruning shears.

111
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:30,943
And the third?

112
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:33,070
Had her ears sawed off her head.

113
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,034
And the fourth had her
lungs cut out.

114
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:35,990
And so on and
so forth.

115
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,449
And tonight, number 19,

116
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:39,952
and she had her brains
scooped out!

117
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:41,954
I'll have the zucchini bulger burger

118
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:43,747
and bring one for my partner too.

119
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:48,145
I remember you telling me about this.
You and Deek Taylor finally caught the guy!

120
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,572
So...

121
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:50,838
what's the connection?

122
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:52,965
Well, it seems the killer

123
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,885
was using the parts for
some kind of ritual or something.

124
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:59,346
Some deranged Egyptian psycho-type,

125
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,015
by the name of...

126
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,100
Semmet Cairo.

127
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:08,063
Well Deek got tipped off... and we
went to pick the guy up and

128
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:10,191
he ran like hell.
Chased him all over the place.

129
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,086
Then Deek lost it.

130
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:14,951
He started shooting.
He shot the guy to pieces.

131
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:03,721
Yeah I remember.
You were real cut up about it.

132
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:05,935
You had a complete
nervous breakdown.

133
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:08,350
You wanna keep it down, will ya?
- Yeah, okay.

134
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,268
And then your wife left you
for that other cop.

135
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:13,489
Hey, you wanna keep it down Sweeney, please.
- Sure thing buddy.

136
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:14,770
Because of that sex problem!

137
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,446
Sweeney, will you shut up!
- Easy... Joe.

138
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,156
<i>Uh, 5-5-4.</i>

139
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:25,807
<i>Uh, 5-5-4-3-1.</i>

140
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:29,879
Hey Joe, listen to me.
I know what your problem is,

141
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,026
I know what it is.
- I'm dying to find out.

142
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:35,547
You need a wife!
Someone to come home to.

143
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:39,372
To a wife that cares.  A home.
Things that really count.

144
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,445
Without those things, my life would
be as pathetic and full of emptiness as yours.

145
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:46,805
Emptiness...
- Yeah, listen to me, Joe!

146
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:51,977
I honestly don't know how
you spend the...

147
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,157
Okay buddy.  Get a good rest.

148
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:03,447
Sweeney!
- What is it, Joe?

149
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:07,201
There's something else I gotta tell ya.
- What?

150
00:11:10,063 --> 00:11:11,607
I knew those girls.

151
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,582
What girls?

152
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,335
The girls got murdered.

153
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,171
I knew them.
- You knew them?

154
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:21,641
You knew those girls?

155
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,135
All of them.

156
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:32,101
See you back at the station, partner.
- What...

157
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:02,172
Erma, where are you?!
- I'm in the kitchen!

158
00:12:06,885 --> 00:12:10,514
Haven't I asked you a million
times to empty your ashtrays?

159
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,434
Where have you been all night?
- Another one of those murders.

160
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:18,881
Sweeney, I wish you could spend
more time at home.

161
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:23,502
We should have more quality time together.
- You know I got a job to do.

162
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:25,972
You love that job more
than me.

163
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:30,279
You'd rather look at dead people
than look at your own wife!

164
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,140
Hey, we don't get ones
like this every day.

165
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,705
You see pretty girls.
- Oh, my Erma.

166
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:39,823
You think I can't be pretty?
I do everything you ask me!

167
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:43,920
I exercise real hard!  I fix your meals
the way you ask me!

168
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,085
- Why don't you just stop...
No!  Don't say it.

169
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:50,554
Don't say it!

170
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,434
Don't you dare say it!

171
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:03,692
All in good time.
One thing at a time.

172
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:08,675
I was just gonna say...
- Don't...

173
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:50,386
Morning, Sarge.
- Morning, Mavis.

174
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:54,034
You're up early this morning.
- I haven't been to bed.

175
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:57,120
Rainy nights are slow.
I'm cold.

176
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:03,065
How about a cup of
coffee and a cuddle, huh Joe?

177
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,547
It's on the house.

178
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:09,132
Okay, Joe, sorry I forgot...

179
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:12,886
Just a cup of coffee?

180
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:18,267
Sorry, Ashley.

181
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,769
Here's your breakfast.

182
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,063
Papaya and pinto beans.

183
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,534
Real healthy.
<i>- Sergeant Sweeney Birdwell...</i>

184
00:14:25,534 --> 00:14:28,110
Oh... that's you.

185
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:31,737
Not much, Larry, pretty much the same deal.
A young girl murdered.

186
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,553
Part of the body removed from the
crime scene.

187
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,493
That's terrible, Sergeant.
- Yes it is, Larry.

188
00:14:37,102 --> 00:14:40,038
Just what was it that was missing this time?
- Her brain, Larry.

189
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,583
Her brain was gone when we got here.
- Her brain?

190
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,168
That's right, Larry.
Her brain.

191
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,819
Hey!

192
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:48,913
What are you doing? There's more!

193
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:50,857
The girl who was killed, was she pretty?

194
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:54,344
Pretty?
- I bet she was pretty, wasn't she?

195
00:14:54,678 --> 00:14:58,307
Someone sawed off the top
of her head and ripped out her brains!

196
00:14:58,307 --> 00:15:02,534
Does that sound pretty to you?!
Pretty messy is more like it!

197
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:05,002
Why are you yelling at me?

198
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:06,982
What's the matter with you?

199
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:09,412
What's the matter with me?

200
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:12,185
One...

201
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:15,657
We're homicide cops and
my partner can't stand the sight of blood.

202
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:21,114
Two... I mind out he mysteriously
knows all the victims!

203
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:26,823
And three! The only other suspect is a
guy who's been dead for twelve years.

204
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:31,298
Erma... I need some quality
time in the sack.

205
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:34,968
Wake me in a couple
of hours.

206
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,350
Are you mad at me?

207
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:45,187
What?
- Are you mad with me?

208
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:51,488
I can't understand you, you've gotta
keep fresh batteries in that thing.

209
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,411
Another one bites the dust.

210
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:04,915
Erma... just give up!

211
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:24,643
It's quittin' time, honey.

212
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:27,437
I gotta go home and
eat my oatmeal.

213
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,006
Oooh.

214
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:33,276
That's a lot of hot cereal.

215
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:38,490
SUSPECT SHOT TO PIECES!
COP HAS NERVOUS BREAKDOWN

216
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:41,201
LOSES WIFE BECAUSE
OF SEXUAL PROBLEM

217
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,806
Why don't you take
off those sunglasses?

218
00:17:46,975 --> 00:17:49,350
Okay... okay.
Don't be so rough.

219
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,436
Your face isn't the
important thing, is it?

220
00:17:56,886 --> 00:18:01,545
Well, let's freshen up a bit and
see what Mr. Zucchini has to say about it.

221
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:04,188
He's the important one,
isn't he?

222
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:12,860
You are gonna love where
this lipstick winds up, lover.

223
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:24,720
I just a splash of color.
Don't you?

224
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,518
Hey, I like kinky too.

225
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:33,313
What?

226
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:40,533
No! No!
... No!

227
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:45,742
Just what the Sam fucking Hill is
going on here?

228
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:50,605
What are we, a travel agency?
Now we buy plane tickets?

229
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,296
<i>Do you know who I
just got off the phone with?!</i>

230
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:55,794
No.
- No.

231
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,504
Do you want to guess?!

232
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:00,799
With your darling wife
and two lovely children, James and...

233
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:02,676
I hate my wife!

234
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:04,678
I hate my children!

235
00:19:05,428 --> 00:19:07,817
The commissioner, that's who!

236
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,225
Who just got off the phone with
the D.A...

237
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:11,977
who just got off the
phone with the mayor

238
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:13,979
...who just got off
the phone with the governor!

239
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:19,317
And do you want to know
what we were talking about?!

240
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:24,077
Uh... the uh...
- Uh... the murders.

241
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:27,325
The murders?  What murders?!

242
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:30,662
The murders that have been happening.
- No!

243
00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:36,215
We were talking about the
impending murders of two...

244
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:42,215
geek detectives who happen to be the
lousiest cops on the force!

245
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:54,093
<i>Try to understand...</i>

246
00:19:54,117 --> 00:19:56,521
he's been under tremendous
pressure lately.

247
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,465
<i>And who the hell authorized one
tourist class ticket from Las Vegas</i>

248
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:08,067
<i>for a certain "D. Taylor"?</i>
- He did it.

249
00:20:09,345 --> 00:20:10,227
You did?

250
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:16,592
The uh... murders resemble a series of
killings that took place in Vegas.

251
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:20,642
A number of years ago in which Deek
Taylor was the officer in cha...

252
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:24,248
Oh yeah.  Las Vegas.

253
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:29,240
It's going back to your... nervous
breakdown and your divorce.

254
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:32,928
Sexual problems.
- Oh, yeah your sexual problem.

255
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,634
We got another one!
<i>Another murder!</i>

256
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:41,016
On Maple and 40th Street.  It's a E street
hooker by the name of Mavis Keeler.

257
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:44,258
<i>Chief... No... Chief!
No you can't!</i>

258
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,667
Give me that!
You... put that thing down!

259
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:50,992
Easy... Chief.

260
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:55,413
You can shoot 'em in
the station.

261
00:20:57,968 --> 00:21:03,996
Blocker... so help me God,
this Taylor guy better be worth it

262
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:08,677
or I'll tear your head right off
your body with my bear hands!

263
00:21:45,755 --> 00:21:48,383
Aww, you're so cute!

264
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,160
My poor doggie.

265
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,486
You're shaking.
What are you scared of?

266
00:22:03,884 --> 00:22:04,785
<i>Hey!</i>

267
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:08,602
<i>Hey, what are you doing,
you bozo?</i>

268
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:11,012
<i>Let me up out of here,
I'm gonna kick your teeth in!</i>

269
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:14,743
<i>What are you doing!
What the...</i>

270
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:18,488
<i>You need some help
with your hose, you dork!</i>

271
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,969
<i>You creep!</i>
You'll pay for that blouse, you jerk!

272
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:36,696
<i>That thing make you feel big enough!</i>
Nothing... you probably!...

273
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:31,194
<i>Ahh!</i>
Blocker, no!

274
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:34,197
Joe don't do it!

275
00:23:36,574 --> 00:23:38,159
No don't, it's me, Deedee!
- What's going on...

276
00:23:38,952 --> 00:23:40,524
Joe, don't shoot me!
- Deedee, will you get off of me...

277
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:42,288
What are you doing?!

278
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:45,152
No, don't, it's me, Deedee!

279
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,836
It's me.  Deedee Taylor!

280
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,047
How'd you get in here?

281
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:53,675
Ashley let me in and
your door was open.

282
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:57,276
I was so anxious to get
here I... took an earlier plane.

283
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:00,219
Oh I talked to you on the phone.
- Right!

284
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,573
Please don't do that!

285
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:06,153
I'm sorry.

286
00:24:09,694 --> 00:24:14,696
Hi... Joe!  Hi miss.  I'll wait in the car.
And don't forget about Taylor.

287
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:18,074
I'm Taylor!

288
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,451
Taylor?
- Deedee Taylor.

289
00:24:23,204 --> 00:24:25,081
Deedee Taylor?

290
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,750
I did not recognize her...

291
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:30,670
I haven't seen you
since you were a kid.

292
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:34,382
This is Sweeney Birdwell,
my partner.

293
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:39,053
This is Deedee
Taylor, Deek's daughter.

294
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:42,362
His daughter...

295
00:24:42,362 --> 00:24:45,059
Hi!
- Hi.

296
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:51,149
So did you come with your father?
Where is he?

297
00:24:53,818 --> 00:24:55,278
He's not here.

298
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:03,244
He disappeared 18 months
ago without a trace.

299
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:05,997
I'm afraid that he's dead.

300
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,711
Could you excuse us for
a minute?

301
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,759
<i>She thinks
Deek Taylor is dead.</i>

302
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:20,178
I know.  I heard her.

303
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,266
I thought you talked
to Deek on the phone.

304
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,560
I talked to Deedee.

305
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:29,103
You hadn't talked to Deek?

306
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:31,731
<i>She said to wire
a plane ticket right away.</i>

307
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:33,900
And she would take
care of everything.

308
00:25:35,898 --> 00:25:39,989
She was always a weird kid.
- Now she's a weird big person.

309
00:25:40,782 --> 00:25:45,581
Joe... the chief said he was gonna
tear your head off your body

310
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:48,174
if this Taylor wasn't worth it.

311
00:25:48,174 --> 00:25:49,424
What does this
suggest to you?

312
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,962
That we're in deep shit.

313
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,666
I know what you're trying to do
Miss Taylor, but you've broken

314
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,789
several laws here including
impersonating an officer.

315
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,093
The ticket was made out
to "D. Taylor"

316
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:02,762
and I am a bonifide
law enforcement officer.

317
00:26:06,474 --> 00:26:10,049
That is regulated parking control.
- A meter maid.  She's a meter maid.

318
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:12,257
A meter maid?
- We're dead men, Joe.

319
00:26:12,257 --> 00:26:15,858
I can help you solve this case.
I have my father's notes and I've been...

320
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:17,482
We're taking you back to the airport.

321
00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:18,695
But there's no return
flights until tomorrow...

322
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:21,531
We'll find one!
- Get your hands off me, you jerks!

323
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:23,750
I came here to find out what
happened to my father and

324
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,292
I'm not going back until I do!

325
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:27,829
I'm gonna scream until you shut up
and listen to me!

326
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:31,473
We're not collecting dimes here, Miss Taylor,
we're tracking down a serial killer.

327
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,218
Just listen to me.

328
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:36,876
If you listen to me tonight,
I'll take a plane home tomorrow...

329
00:26:36,876 --> 00:26:40,155
Get back in the car!
- I can help you solve this case!

330
00:26:41,843 --> 00:26:45,441
I can help you solve this case!
- You're a pain in the ass!

331
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:50,518
Doesn't hurt to listen.
What do you say, Joe?

332
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:53,771
Deep, deep shit.

333
00:26:56,524 --> 00:27:00,274
Yes, Miss Birdwell, using the
state of the art behavioral

334
00:27:00,274 --> 00:27:04,797
modification systemics, we can free you
from the tyranny of tobacco

335
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:06,951
which has enslaved you
all these years.

336
00:27:07,744 --> 00:27:09,412
The choice is yours.

337
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:14,042
What do I do?

338
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:22,050
Please have a
seat, Mrs. Birdwell.

339
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:27,243
We'd like you to
watch a short presentation.

340
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:30,429
Are we quite comfortable?

341
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:32,310
Fine.

342
00:27:32,894 --> 00:27:35,813
I'll be back shortly.

343
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,435
Joe, I can't believe you
didn't recognize me.

344
00:28:51,435 --> 00:28:53,091
You and daddy were my
heroes when I was little.

345
00:28:53,091 --> 00:28:54,910
You used to be so handsome.

346
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh... excuse, pardon moi.

347
00:28:57,478 --> 00:29:00,072
I couldn't understand why you went
away so suddenly, but then daddy told me

348
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,461
about your breakdown, and your
wife divorcing you because of

349
00:29:03,461 --> 00:29:05,650
your sexual problem.
He told me all about it.

350
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:08,101
He said you hate women now.
I guess that's why, huh?

351
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:11,325
I don't hate women.
- Yes you do, Joe.

352
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:13,619
Maybe just a little.

353
00:29:14,074 --> 00:29:16,131
But when you told me about
all these murders and how they

354
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,875
match the Las Vegas killing and
the Egyptian clues

355
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:19,991
I just had to get here!

356
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:22,908
You just had to get here?
Compliments of the police department.

357
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:25,676
Yeah, because I'm sure the killing
are connected with daddy's disappearance.

358
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,550
Oh, you're sure?
- Yeah!

359
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:29,602
<i>Uh, where are you Car 107?</i>

360
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:32,007
<i>107, over, come in.</i>

361
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,785
<i>Uh, gimme...</i>
- Uh, this is 107, over.

362
00:29:34,785 --> 00:29:37,287
<i>Where the hell are you
two geeks?</i>

363
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:39,700
On the way to the airport.

364
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,786
<i>Well, there's another one at
Boxseller Park, goddamnit!</i>

365
00:29:42,786 --> 00:29:45,626
Another airport at Boxseller Park?
You sure, Chief?

366
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:47,748
Uh... oh another murder!

367
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:48,971
We're on our way!

368
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,825
<i>Pick up this Taylor guy first
who you say is gonna help us so much!</i>

369
00:29:53,562 --> 00:29:57,896
Uh, he doesn't know very much,
so we thought we'd take him back.

370
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:00,583
<i>Goddamnit, I paid for him
and I want him!</i>

371
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:05,086
<i>If you arrive here without
Taylor, I'll have you both killed!  Over!</i>

372
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:11,010
The killings are occurring closer
together now.

373
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:15,223
This one should be the
eyes and digestive tract.

374
00:30:15,556 --> 00:30:17,996
This one should be the
eyes and digestive tract.

375
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:22,274
This time he took her eyes
and digestive tract.

376
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:25,182
How do you think he did it?

377
00:30:25,206 --> 00:30:29,864
Easy.  High-powered
industrial shop vacuum.

378
00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:32,193
Sucked it right out.

379
00:30:34,202 --> 00:30:36,503
It's all like one
long string, you know?

380
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:39,526
Yank on one end and it
all comes out.

381
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:47,769
Please can I come look!
Is it like what I said?

382
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:49,080
Stay in the car!

383
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,239
Damnit!

384
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,707
Why don't you listen to her?

385
00:30:51,707 --> 00:30:55,273
Maybe we ought to worry how
we're going to explain it to the chief.

386
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:59,767
How did she know what the
missing parts would be?

387
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:01,822
We should listen to her!

388
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:06,695
Joe... take it easy.

389
00:31:08,842 --> 00:31:10,964
You knew this
one too, right?

390
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:14,003
Yeah.  Right.

391
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:16,450
Another one from Vegas.

392
00:31:17,785 --> 00:31:20,288
Betty and her boobsie twins.

393
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:24,709
Former showgirl.  Betty and I
go back a long way.

394
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:28,546
I get it.
Before TSP.

395
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,698
Before what?

396
00:31:29,944 --> 00:31:33,913
Before TSP.  The sexual problem.

397
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,642
That is the last goddamn time
I'm ever gonna hear that from anybody.

398
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:47,956
Don't hesitate.  Don't think about it!
Just do it.  Please!

399
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:50,276
Joe.  Stop it!

400
00:31:53,862 --> 00:31:55,307
<i>I'm sorry, Sweeney.</i>

401
00:31:55,307 --> 00:31:57,199
But you're an asshole!

402
00:31:57,898 --> 00:31:59,626
I was just kidding around!

403
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:04,658
When this case is over,
you and I are quits.

404
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:09,089
Oh, c'mon Joe.
<i>I was just kiddin' around.</i>

405
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:13,153
Joe... come on.

406
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:19,010
Did I hear you say that all the
victims are from Las Vegas?

407
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,006
All the victims are from Las Vegas?!
- Shh!

408
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:21,799
What?!

409
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:24,998
Then there's got to be a definite
connection to the Cairo case.

410
00:32:25,994 --> 00:32:27,480
Don't you get it?!

411
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:34,339
You see... the killer's brother was
the one that tipped my father off.

412
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,158
A guy named Jackie Cairo.

413
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:40,706
<i>A small time casino shark
into real estate.</i>

414
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:43,957
Well, Jackie discovered that his
brother Semmet was the murderer

415
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:45,637
and went straight
to the police.

416
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,735
<i>What the hell is going on here?
Jackie Cairo?  Las Vegas?</i>

417
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:50,681
Who is this person anyway?

418
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:54,680
Deedee Taylor.
Las Vegas Law Enforcement.

419
00:32:55,257 --> 00:32:59,642
Deedee... D... I thought you said...
<i>- Ah, so, here's what we've got so far.</i>

420
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:02,598
A series of murders which echo
exactly the frequency

421
00:33:02,932 --> 00:33:05,184
and M.O. of the
Las Vegas killings.

422
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:07,978
<i>All victims happen to be
from Vegas.</i>

423
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:11,592
Two weeks before your
murders began...

424
00:33:12,247 --> 00:33:16,195
word is Jackie Cairo
picked up and left Vegas.

425
00:33:16,743 --> 00:33:17,532
So?

426
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,299
He moved here!

427
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:24,600
A suspect!  A suspect! I can't
believe it, an actual suspect!

428
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,509
Chief, you don't understand.
<i>- Understand this, Blocker!</i>

429
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:31,741
I want her in charge when
you look up this Cairo guy.

430
00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:35,127
<i>You listen to her.  She'll be the
brains, you'll be the brawn.</i>

431
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,241
And the medical examiner wants to
see you in the autopsy room.  Pronto!

432
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:43,639
He says he has something
he wants to show you.

433
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:48,971
He confided in me that it
was absolutely vile.

434
00:33:50,025 --> 00:33:54,160
That's really something for the
medical examiner to say... isn't it?

435
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:59,113
<i>Great to see you here, Joe.</i>

436
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:03,516
You gotta come down more often.
This is a happy place, isn't it girls?

437
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,369
Sure is, Doctor Hooper.

438
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:08,490
We have fun, you know?
- Ha ha!

439
00:34:09,626 --> 00:34:13,864
Look at this, Joe.  You can tell by the
ragged stump on the splenic artery

440
00:34:13,864 --> 00:34:17,728
a rapid sawing motion was
used to cut this baby out.

441
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,381
I guess a hedge trimmer.

442
00:34:21,188 --> 00:34:23,511
<i>Interesting that the spleen
could be removed</i>

443
00:34:23,535 --> 00:34:26,307
without the surrounding organs
suffering any trauma.

444
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:29,018
Especially with the weapon
the killer was using.

445
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:31,896
Shows somebody knew what
they were doing.

446
00:34:33,408 --> 00:34:38,171
<i>What's this thing?</i>
- Surprise!  Ha ha ha!

447
00:34:38,171 --> 00:34:40,145
<i>Another note!</i>

448
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:48,162
Written in hieroglyphics, like the
other one.  This is a real problem.

449
00:34:48,913 --> 00:34:49,896
<i>I can decipher them.</i>

450
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:52,204
Daddy showed me how
you do it once.

451
00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:54,107
Of course.

452
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:55,831
Come on let's get out of here!

453
00:34:55,831 --> 00:34:57,902
<i>Hey, not so fast, Joe.</i>

454
00:34:58,737 --> 00:35:03,810
Today is Flo's birthday!  Kel made her
famous tomato salmon casserole.

455
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,096
Show him, Kel.

456
00:35:24,281 --> 00:35:27,878
<i>That's a 150 big ones
you owe me, Sweeney.  Hey!</i>

457
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:30,246
What happened to your lip?

458
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:32,673
<i>Hey!</i>

459
00:35:33,015 --> 00:35:34,695
What about my 150 bucks!

460
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:37,104
Monday!  Goddamnit!

461
00:35:37,556 --> 00:35:39,815
Come on!

462
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,875
You finished?

463
00:35:47,453 --> 00:35:49,056
Fuck off!

464
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:53,341
Tomato, salmon casserole...

465
00:37:14,324 --> 00:37:16,465
Don't be discouraged,
Mrs. Birdwell.

466
00:37:17,805 --> 00:37:22,239
We have alternate techniques
for difficult cases such as yours.

467
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:28,419
I'd like you to meet Henry,
your physical therapist.

468
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:34,703
Hi.

469
00:37:35,815 --> 00:37:39,093
Now, Mrs. Birdwell,
will you inhale, please?

470
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:41,961
<i>Good?</i>

471
00:37:53,222 --> 00:37:57,726
Now, Mrs. Birdwell, could
you inhale again, please?

472
00:38:06,562 --> 00:38:08,708
<i>I got it! I think I know
what they say!</i>

473
00:38:09,947 --> 00:38:13,065
It's pretty weird.
- Listen to this.

474
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:14,937
First one...

475
00:38:16,365 --> 00:38:20,983
"So shall it be,
three times seven.

476
00:38:21,461 --> 00:38:25,444
Begins to brew,
the loss of heaven."

477
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:31,109
Three times seven equals 21.

478
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,050
The total number of the
Las Vegas killings.

479
00:38:36,072 --> 00:38:40,137
<i>"Begins to brew,
the loss of heaven..."</i>

480
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,201
"Instead in blackness,
void of breath.

481
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:52,362
The weep and swallow,
endless death."

482
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:10,526
Ahh!

483
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:13,052
What's the matter
with you guys?

484
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:15,079
Ahh!

485
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:18,057
Oh for Pete's sake... shut up!

486
00:39:18,348 --> 00:39:20,017
It's only Sweeney's wife.

487
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:22,967
Who the hell is that?

488
00:39:24,499 --> 00:39:25,499
Erma...

489
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:27,461
D... Dee...

490
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:32,777
Deedee Taylor of the Las Vegas
Police.  She's working the case with us.

491
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,240
Please.

492
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:38,559
W... Wh...
What happened to you?

493
00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:42,247
Come on.

494
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:46,011
Crimey.

495
00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:48,629
What happened to her?

496
00:39:48,962 --> 00:39:50,881
That is a long story, kid.

497
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:54,718
You don't want to hear it
and I don't want to tell it.

498
00:39:57,049 --> 00:39:58,472
Hey.

499
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:00,182
Your hiccups are gone.

500
00:40:01,472 --> 00:40:04,520
You're right.
- She works every time.

501
00:40:18,826 --> 00:40:20,744
I...

502
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:25,165
I gotta get a glass
of water or something.

503
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,255
Would you...

504
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:36,135
God damn things...

505
00:40:36,426 --> 00:40:38,345
never fit!

506
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:40,347
Give me that thing.

507
00:40:41,527 --> 00:40:43,433
Go inside and play
detective.

508
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:46,687
You and that girl
find some more clues!

509
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:51,316
Super.

510
00:40:53,443 --> 00:40:54,695
Try this.

511
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:59,236
Testing, one, two, three. Testing.

512
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,076
Sound good, alright
you're on the air again.

513
00:41:01,618 --> 00:41:04,204
Thanks Joe.
You're a sweetheart.

514
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:08,167
Okay, kid.

515
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:12,337
You wanna tell me what happened?

516
00:41:13,755 --> 00:41:16,232
It doesn't make any
difference, Joe.

517
00:41:17,297 --> 00:41:19,825
Nothing makes any
difference anymore.

518
00:41:22,669 --> 00:41:25,642
She's pretty, isn't she, Joe?
- Her?

519
00:41:25,976 --> 00:41:30,113
Yes.  Admit it.
You think she's pretty.

520
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:35,110
So does Sweeney.
- Pretty ugly is more like it.

521
00:41:35,484 --> 00:41:38,397
She picks her nose,
and she hiccups, and burps.

522
00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:43,718
Oh Joe, I see right
through you.

523
00:41:44,227 --> 00:41:46,788
You're just a
romantic at heart.

524
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:50,495
That's a funny thing to call
an old woman-hater like me.

525
00:41:50,903 --> 00:41:55,297
Woman-hater? But you don't
hate me, do you, Joe?

526
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:57,216
Of course not, Erma.

527
00:41:58,276 --> 00:41:59,908
But you're not a woman.

528
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,998
No, I mean, you are not a woman
like the rest of them.

529
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:05,358
I mean, you're... you're different.

530
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:07,017
I mean you're special.

531
00:42:09,019 --> 00:42:13,159
I better get back
out in to the circus.

532
00:42:22,032 --> 00:42:24,284
What's this, Erma?

533
00:42:24,701 --> 00:42:27,496
Your favorite.
Semolina skirt sprout burgers.

534
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:32,751
Great, thank you very much, Mrs. Birdwell.
It looks so healthy.

535
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:38,090
You're welcome.

536
00:42:41,824 --> 00:42:46,798
<i>Through the loss of heaven,
swallow endless death.</i>

537
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:50,618
<i>Swallow endless death.
- That sounds like the formula.</i>

538
00:42:52,104 --> 00:42:55,274
What is so neat about
this Egyptian formula,

539
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:57,896
that some nut is killing
people for it?

540
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:00,150
Eternal life, Sweeney.

541
00:43:00,508 --> 00:43:04,019
<i>I mean the formula's thought
to place a body in a state of...</i>

542
00:43:04,366 --> 00:43:08,250
purity. Cleansing it of all earthly
contamination which will ensure

543
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:13,977
an afterlife of...
perpetual ectasy.

544
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:17,313
<i>Perpetual ecstasy?
- A parcel who is old and diseased...</i>

545
00:43:17,463 --> 00:43:21,042
they would enjoy the afterlife forever
in a young, beautiful body!

546
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:24,124
<i>But could this formula
work on the living?</i>

547
00:43:24,124 --> 00:43:26,016
<i>Well, someone's trying to see
if it does.</i>

548
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,889
But where do we start
looking for this... Jackie Cairo?

549
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:49,453
The Egyptian part of town.

550
00:43:51,038 --> 00:43:53,227
<i>Long time since we've
been down here, huh Joe?</i>

551
00:43:53,582 --> 00:43:56,947
This place gives me the heebie-jeebies.
- Yeah, me too.

552
00:43:57,294 --> 00:43:58,337
Why's that?

553
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:02,049
<i>Cops don't come down here much.
Place has its own laws.</i>

554
00:44:02,382 --> 00:44:04,259
<i>They don't want us
down here.</i>

555
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:29,056
<i>Oh, I hate this!  This happens every
time we come down here!</i>

556
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:31,162
We'll never find
Jackie Cairo here.

557
00:44:31,162 --> 00:44:31,189
Give me the phone book
with the Egypt part, Birdwell.

558
00:44:31,189 --> 00:44:33,190
Did you bring the phonebook
to Egypt Town, Birdwell?

559
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:37,298
Yeah...  there are a million
Cairo's with initial "J".

560
00:44:44,632 --> 00:44:46,585
It's a very common Egyptian name.

561
00:44:46,648 --> 00:44:48,519
But you don't have to bother.
- What do you mean?

562
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:52,283
Cairo was into all kinds of shady
land deals in Vegas.

563
00:44:52,446 --> 00:44:56,211
Well, real estate agents have to be
licensed in the states in which they operate.

564
00:44:56,388 --> 00:45:00,440
So, I traced Cairo's application and I
found his business address in Egypt Town.

565
00:45:00,774 --> 00:45:02,192
Hey.
- Of course!

566
00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:05,987
4400 Zoser Court.
The Café Nefertiti.

567
00:45:06,446 --> 00:45:08,365
Let's go!

568
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:16,623
4400 Zoser Court. The Café Nefertiti.
This is it!

569
00:45:17,578 --> 00:45:20,886
Ahh.  An automobile has arrived.

570
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:26,341
Are you ready?
- Yes, Mr. Cairo, I think so.

571
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:30,470
You got the pencil, stupid girl?!
- Yeah.  I almost forgot.

572
00:45:30,804 --> 00:45:34,099
<i>How about an order pad?</i>
- Oh yeah...

573
00:45:35,892 --> 00:45:37,936
Oh, so stupid.

574
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:47,279
Here!

575
00:45:47,696 --> 00:45:49,656
Don't forget the menus.

576
00:45:50,657 --> 00:45:53,691
Oh... thank you.
I forgot those.

577
00:45:57,622 --> 00:46:00,292
<i>You have brought me an
exquisite flower, Lober.</i>

578
00:46:01,001 --> 00:46:02,711
Perhaps the best
of all of them.

579
00:46:03,253 --> 00:46:05,964
But you must be more
careful with her.

580
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:07,757
I do not want
her bruised.

581
00:46:08,758 --> 00:46:12,220
But she is so stupid, great one.
- She is beautiful.

582
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:14,764
<i>You are fat and ugly.</i>

583
00:46:15,432 --> 00:46:18,477
I said I do not
want her bruised.

584
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:24,608
I don't know.  I don't like this.
- I don't either.

585
00:46:25,317 --> 00:46:29,496
Make sure you just look around.
You let us do the talking.

586
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,766
Aye, aye, Dick Tracy.

587
00:47:04,481 --> 00:47:09,273
Nefertiti Gourmet Drive In.
Can I... help you?

588
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:12,697
Your waitress will be right
with you.

589
00:47:21,301 --> 00:47:25,152
Look behind you towards that
corner.  Don't be obvious.

590
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,132
Shit.

591
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:36,304
I think he's staring at me.

592
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:42,977
I don't like it.
- Alright, well, look let's just take it slow.

593
00:47:42,977 --> 00:47:43,977
That's gonna be a problem.

594
00:47:44,271 --> 00:47:48,817
Remember, a problem is just an
open door to opportunity.

595
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:54,406
Something tells
me it's Jackie Cairo.

596
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:03,206
Stupid girl.

597
00:48:12,674 --> 00:48:14,801
Welcome to Café Nefertitty.

598
00:48:15,594 --> 00:48:17,178
Nefertiti.

599
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:22,955
I'm sorry.  It's my first
day on the job.  I'm... nervous.

600
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,082
That's okay.

601
00:48:25,604 --> 00:48:29,048
That's a real pretty costume.
Really adds atmosphere.

602
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:31,610
It's nice, isn't it.
<i>- It's dynamite!</i>

603
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,946
Who do I talk to about a job?
<i>Is your boss here?</i>

604
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,575
Waitress!  What's the...
King Tut Special?

605
00:48:39,504 --> 00:48:43,455
Um.  Excuse me.
I'll go see.

606
00:48:44,205 --> 00:48:47,667
Forget it!  I'll
have a burger.

607
00:48:48,209 --> 00:48:52,005
I'll have a cheeseburger, ketchup,
no onions, and a cup of black coffee.

608
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:54,382
One camel burger with
goat cheese and ketchup!

609
00:48:54,758 --> 00:48:56,718
Camel burger, goat
cheese, ketchup!

610
00:49:13,443 --> 00:49:15,487
I'll have the couscous.
- Me too.

611
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,738
Two couscous!

612
00:49:17,072 --> 00:49:20,575
Two couscous.
- Your order will be ready in just a sec.

613
00:49:20,815 --> 00:49:23,795
Ooh, wait, Miss.  Is that
your boss in the back there?

614
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:26,831
I really would like to
talk to him about a job.

615
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:28,458
Let me check.

616
00:49:36,508 --> 00:49:38,176
Ooh... I'm sorry.

617
00:49:38,468 --> 00:49:39,961
What the hell do you
think you're doing.

618
00:49:39,961 --> 00:49:41,414
I said we'll ask the questions!

619
00:49:41,704 --> 00:49:44,681
The only thing I've heard you ask
is what the King Tut Special was!

620
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:46,944
Somebody gotta
take the initiative.

621
00:49:57,445 --> 00:49:58,988
Who are those people?

622
00:49:59,823 --> 00:50:03,076
<i>Customers, I guess?</i>
- Why don't you feed them in the parking lot.

623
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,203
You know we don't like
outsiders in here.

624
00:50:06,246 --> 00:50:07,789
She is so stupid.

625
00:50:08,123 --> 00:50:09,999
And you are fat and ugly.

626
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,478
<i>They do not look
like customers to me.</i>

627
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:19,429
Nemo, Marsha. Be patience.
Their time will come.

628
00:50:19,429 --> 00:50:22,262
<i>The girl wants to ask
you about a job, Mr. Cairo.</i>

629
00:50:22,595 --> 00:50:25,348
She likes the costumes that
we have to wear.

630
00:50:25,974 --> 00:50:27,475
I think she's nice.

631
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:29,310
What should I tell her?

632
00:50:30,687 --> 00:50:32,689
Let me think, child.

633
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:47,620
Excuse me, guys.

634
00:50:48,288 --> 00:50:51,613
Hey, I talked to Mr. Cairo and he
says he needs a new waitress.

635
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:53,101
He wants to talk to you.

636
00:50:53,101 --> 00:50:55,920
That's great!
Deedee.  Deedee Taylor.

637
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:59,503
My name's Grace.
We're gonna have so much fun together!

638
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:00,607
I just know it.

639
00:51:01,004 --> 00:51:04,137
What's our boss like?
Very mysterious...

640
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:08,859
Oh he is mysterious, but he is so nice.
You know, I met him in Las Vegas

641
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:10,362
when I was really down and out.

642
00:51:10,362 --> 00:51:14,444
But then he paid for my bus ticket so
I could come up here and start my new career.

643
00:51:16,149 --> 00:51:17,609
As a waitress.

644
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:20,730
He says he's even gonna give me lessons.
- Lessons?

645
00:51:20,979 --> 00:51:22,644
Waitress lessons, ya know...
- Oh...

646
00:51:23,156 --> 00:51:24,532
No way Taylor, it's out of
the questions.

647
00:51:24,824 --> 00:51:27,356
That waitress is in danger.  I've got to
warn her and find out all I can

648
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,903
...about her boss.
She's gonna meet with him later tonight!

649
00:51:29,903 --> 00:51:31,039
- I said no way.

650
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:33,240
Here's her address.  I copied it
down for you.

651
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,367
Now I might need some backup
when I go in the motel.

652
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:37,054
Backup my butt!

653
00:51:37,411 --> 00:51:42,021
I'm staying at that motel.  I'm asking
a few questions, I'm getting a few answers.

654
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:45,014
I'm gonna find out what happened
to my father if it kills me,

655
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:49,540
and if it doesn't, I'm gonna see that
killer fry until his earwax bubbles!

656
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:56,548
And if you try and stop me, I'll tell the
chief that you interfered

657
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:59,682
in this investigation and
he'll shoot you where you stand!

658
00:52:31,266 --> 00:52:34,018
Yes, beautiful lady, how may
I be of assistance?

659
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:37,438
I would like a room, please.
- Certainly.

660
00:52:37,772 --> 00:52:39,357
That'll be $12, even.

661
00:52:45,655 --> 00:52:47,907
Anything else I could help
you with, my dear?

662
00:52:48,741 --> 00:52:51,536
Yes, I would like
something for later.

663
00:52:52,704 --> 00:52:54,789
I know exactly what you mean.

664
00:52:56,124 --> 00:52:59,752
If I may suggest this special device with...
- No! Ha...

665
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:05,174
I meant something to drink.
A cup of tea.

666
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,844
Could that nice waitress
from the restaurant bring me some?

667
00:53:08,761 --> 00:53:12,057
We don't normally offer
room service.

668
00:53:16,185 --> 00:53:19,216
But for a delicate water, even
the wind must bend.

669
00:53:19,216 --> 00:53:21,456
I will see to it personally.

670
00:53:24,277 --> 00:53:25,814
You sure you wouldn't like
the heat seeking...

671
00:53:29,741 --> 00:53:31,451
Come on...

672
00:53:37,582 --> 00:53:39,417
You creep!

673
00:53:46,299 --> 00:53:51,596
HAD NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
BIG SEXUAL PROBLEM.

674
00:53:56,184 --> 00:53:59,228
Figures.  I get
all the good ones.

675
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,373
<i>Joe's Out Call Girls, what's your pleasure?</i>
- Girl, it's Sandy.

676
00:55:16,373 --> 00:55:19,466
I've been ringing every 10 minutes
for an hour, there's nobody here

677
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:23,521
and it's raining, damn it...

678
00:55:24,063 --> 00:55:26,441
I know... many miles...

679
00:55:26,774 --> 00:55:28,109
through the snow...

680
00:55:29,796 --> 00:55:32,155
Jesus, I work in a
supermarket or something.

681
00:55:32,488 --> 00:55:35,554
Okay, I'm gonna get a cab
and come in, alright.

682
00:55:35,616 --> 00:55:37,702
<i>Oh, alright, but jesus...</i>
- Okay, bye.

683
00:55:44,751 --> 00:55:49,589
You gotta be kidding.  Two bit whore
without a quarter.  It's not my day.

684
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:56,429
Mister... do you got
a quarter?

685
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:03,019
Hey, if you don't have a quarter,
that's okay too, man.

686
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:05,331
TIME EXPIRED

687
00:57:16,092 --> 00:57:19,532
<i>Hit me!  Not like that!
- Ohh! I like it!</i>

688
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:33,151
Oh, god, she's such a pain
in the ass.

689
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:38,790
She's been in there over two hours.
- Gotta stay awake for her, Joe.

690
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:42,723
Yeah, right.  If she's killed
it'll save us a trip back out here.

691
00:57:44,078 --> 00:57:46,747
You're a warm, caring
person, Blocker.

692
00:57:47,081 --> 00:57:50,952
<i>Central to Car 107.  Come in...</i>
- Uh 107, go ahead, over.

693
00:57:50,952 --> 00:57:53,926
<i>Uh, there's been another murder
at 226 Boxholder Lane.</i>

694
00:57:53,926 --> 00:57:56,278
<i>Chief wants you guys here...</i>
- Joe, that's your address!

695
00:57:56,278 --> 00:57:58,273
That's your address, Joe!
- I know it's my address!

696
00:57:58,273 --> 00:57:59,840
We gotta get over there!

697
00:58:13,232 --> 00:58:17,236
Who is it?
- It's me, room service.

698
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:22,074
Oh, Grace.  I never
thought you'd get here.

699
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:27,121
This is such a creepy place.

700
00:58:38,341 --> 00:58:41,105
You're gonna love this one, Joe.
You're just gonna <i>love</i> it!

701
00:58:41,928 --> 00:58:42,845
Well leave me alone,
will ya?

702
00:58:42,932 --> 00:58:45,890
But this one's a blockbuster!
Two thumbs up on this one!

703
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,267
Sweeney, go check it out.
- Come on, Joe.

704
00:58:48,684 --> 00:58:50,496
Even got a note in
English this time.

705
00:58:50,496 --> 00:58:54,915
Look, I'll be right over, I promise.
- Trouble is, it doesn't make any sense.

706
00:58:55,107 --> 00:58:57,511
What do you mean?
- She's not a meter maid.

707
00:58:57,511 --> 00:58:58,258
What'd you say?

708
00:58:58,258 --> 00:59:01,572
She's a hooker,
not a meter maid.

709
00:59:01,864 --> 00:59:03,783
What the hell is
going on?!

710
00:59:23,219 --> 00:59:25,137
METER MAID
YOUR TIME IS UP!

711
00:59:26,472 --> 00:59:27,223
Where's the fire, Blocker?!

712
00:59:27,556 --> 00:59:29,337
Taylor's in trouble.
I gotta get back to the motel.

713
00:59:29,429 --> 00:59:31,636
You're the one's in trouble!
Is that your apartment house?!

714
00:59:31,636 --> 00:59:32,821
What are you getting at?

715
00:59:32,821 --> 00:59:36,472
Can anyone verify where
you were in the last 60 minutes?

716
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:37,942
Sure! Sweeney here!

717
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:42,196
He's not included.
- God, I can't talk now.  Come on, Sweeney!

718
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:43,372
Grab him!
- God damnit! Let go...

719
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:45,119
There's a girl about
to be murdered!

720
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:49,370
A girl was killed!
Sandy Kleinbacker from Las Vegas.

721
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:51,580
You knew all of them
in Las Vegas.

722
00:59:52,123 --> 00:59:55,293
Where you were under psychiatric
care after your breakdown!

723
00:59:55,595 --> 00:59:59,049
And then you move here and
the murders start all over again!

724
00:59:59,482 --> 01:00:02,188
You've always been a woman-hater
and everybody knows it!

725
01:00:02,188 --> 01:00:05,150
Bullshit!
- Is it?  Is it?!

726
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:08,658
Gwendoline told me everything.
That's why she left you.

727
01:00:08,986 --> 01:00:13,497
Oh, I know all about you, Blocker!
- Gwendolin didn't know shit!

728
01:00:13,756 --> 01:00:15,896
She kicked me when I was
down.  That's all she ever knew.

729
01:00:16,258 --> 01:00:19,343
No one deserves that silly
twat more than you!

730
01:00:21,736 --> 01:00:25,156
What did you call my wife?
- A twat!

731
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,116
Like you have down there.

732
01:00:29,368 --> 01:00:31,746
Take another one!

733
01:00:32,747 --> 01:00:33,706
Oh no you don't!

734
01:00:34,081 --> 01:00:36,284
Oh... yes I do!

735
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:40,296
Outstanding for a geek!

736
01:00:41,797 --> 01:00:43,591
Come on, Sweeney!

737
01:00:52,433 --> 01:00:53,851
103...

738
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:55,227
105...

739
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:57,938
107!
- Deedee!

740
01:00:58,272 --> 01:01:01,859
It's a briefcase.  He's got her!
- Shit!

741
01:01:03,152 --> 01:01:06,030
The address.  She gave you
the waitress' address.

742
01:01:06,184 --> 01:01:08,145
The waitress can tell us
where to find Cairo!

743
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,785
Shit!  Where did I put it?

744
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:15,184
The parking lot!
You threw it out the window!

745
01:01:19,001 --> 01:01:20,624
<i>You seem very interested...</i>

746
01:01:20,824 --> 01:01:24,094
in a poor businessman down
in Egypt Town.  Why is that?

747
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:30,054
I just wanted to apply for
a job as a waitress.

748
01:01:30,471 --> 01:01:32,390
A girl likes to know who
she's working for.

749
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:33,391
Yes.

750
01:01:34,975 --> 01:01:37,561
So our lovely Grace
has told me.

751
01:01:38,425 --> 01:01:41,857
You know, of course,
my waitresses are very special.

752
01:01:42,274 --> 01:01:45,111
They possess very special
qualities.

753
01:01:45,861 --> 01:01:47,780
I train them personally.

754
01:01:48,447 --> 01:01:51,033
Hold her!
- Hey, what are you doing?!

755
01:01:52,493 --> 01:01:54,703
We discussed special qualities.

756
01:01:55,329 --> 01:01:57,289
I must see if you have them.

757
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:59,125
Stop it!

758
01:02:01,043 --> 01:02:05,798
You will show me, child.
You will show me all.

759
01:02:16,642 --> 01:02:19,019
Unfortunately, I have a
previous appointment.

760
01:02:20,563 --> 01:02:24,525
Annoint her body...
in special oils.

761
01:02:25,693 --> 01:02:28,028
Dress her in
lovely garments.

762
01:02:30,197 --> 01:02:32,992
Then lock her ass up
until I get back.

763
01:02:36,495 --> 01:02:39,304
This is a parking ticket.
I can't believe someone just

764
01:02:39,304 --> 01:02:41,612
threw away a parking ticket...
you just ignore this thing.

765
01:02:41,612 --> 01:02:44,587
Sweeney, would you put
that down and just keep looking.

766
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:48,632
Wait! Here, here.  I found it.  Let's go!
- Okay.

767
01:02:52,136 --> 01:02:54,680
HOME OF GRACE
FUTURE WAITRESS

768
01:02:59,351 --> 01:03:01,562
It's time for your
lessons, my child.

769
01:03:01,896 --> 01:03:05,107
Mister Cairo.
Come on in.

770
01:03:23,501 --> 01:03:27,338
I'm so happy you're willing to
spend all this time with me.

771
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,309
I just hope you'll let me
show my appreciation.

772
01:03:40,893 --> 01:03:43,145
Of course, my dear.

773
01:03:53,113 --> 01:03:55,699
Come.  Come, come.

774
01:04:00,371 --> 01:04:04,458
So soft... so pale...

775
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:08,671
Like the translucent
underbelly of a lily.

776
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:13,008
Go into the bedroom,
Grace, dear.

777
01:04:14,009 --> 01:04:15,511
Put on this uniform.

778
01:04:21,308 --> 01:04:23,894
That's a pretty skimpy uniform.
- Mmm.

779
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:30,276
I don't understand, I...
- You need only understand...

780
01:04:30,818 --> 01:04:35,573
that to allow the correct processes,
to assert the autonomous natures,

781
01:04:35,864 --> 01:04:40,619
the uniform must be as unencumbering
as is humanly possible.

782
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:45,749
Trust me, my dear.

783
01:04:47,084 --> 01:04:48,752
Okay.

784
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:50,358
Now...

785
01:04:50,879 --> 01:04:55,634
put them on.  Put them on
very quickly.

786
01:05:14,737 --> 01:05:18,240
<i>Jeez.  This is dark and scary.</i>

787
01:05:19,867 --> 01:05:22,286
Get the flashlights.

788
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:30,628
Let's go.

789
01:05:45,351 --> 01:05:52,733
<i>Great!  Wonderful!  Let's go!
Once again, and, one, two, three, four...</i>

790
01:05:53,192 --> 01:05:59,406
<i>Climb. Two, three, four. To the sky!
Good!  Wonderful!  Let's stretch!</i>

791
01:05:59,901 --> 01:06:04,876
<i>Don't forget to breath!  Breath!
Two, three, one, two, three...</i>

792
01:06:04,876 --> 01:06:08,465
<i>four, step, two, three.
Four, knees high! Up!</i>

793
01:06:22,805 --> 01:06:29,730
Wonderful!  Energy, and calories
are burning! That's it! Good, people!

794
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:33,765
Keep it going people!
One, two, three, four, step!...

795
01:07:01,969 --> 01:07:04,869
<i>I'm ready, Mr. Cairo.  Should I
come out now?</i>

796
01:07:04,869 --> 01:07:09,564
Perhaps we will need to
remove... all of your garments.

797
01:07:09,685 --> 01:07:14,760
All of them.  All the better
to see your lovely buttocks.

798
01:07:15,582 --> 01:07:18,527
<i>Like my other flowers.</i>

799
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:35,210
We must begin!  Oh, yes.

800
01:07:35,669 --> 01:07:38,396
Oh just... just...

801
01:07:38,396 --> 01:07:41,302
recline on the davenport, my child.

802
01:07:41,842 --> 01:07:44,219
Recline and relax.

803
01:07:44,678 --> 01:07:48,010
While I prepare for
the documentation

804
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:52,770
of your achieving perfection
as a waitress.

805
01:07:53,896 --> 01:07:56,523
That's it.  As a waitress.

806
01:08:34,603 --> 01:08:36,188
Grace?

807
01:08:39,775 --> 01:08:42,361
Where the hell's Cairo?!
You better tell us!

808
01:08:43,195 --> 01:08:44,238
<i>That's Deedee's clothes!</i>

809
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:47,449
Where the hell is she?
Where the hell is she!

810
01:08:55,749 --> 01:08:58,877
You gotta be fucking kidding.
- I don't think they're kidding, Joe.

811
01:09:00,712 --> 01:09:03,481
They're not kidding, Joe!

812
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:08,971
Birdwell!  Shoot them!

813
01:09:09,263 --> 01:09:11,515
Can't kill women, Joe!
<i>- Start with one!</i>

814
01:09:11,849 --> 01:09:14,017
This one!
<i>Shoot this one!</i>

815
01:09:15,853 --> 01:09:17,896
<i>I want to but I can't!</i>

816
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,441
I am warning you!

817
01:09:54,641 --> 01:09:59,771
Joe, I can't believe you actually
shot those women.

818
01:09:59,947 --> 01:10:01,714
<i>Because they're pretty, is that it?</i>

819
01:10:01,858 --> 01:10:04,725
Admit it, Sweeney!
You think they're pretty!

820
01:10:04,985 --> 01:10:07,738
Erma?  What the hell are
you doing here?

821
01:10:52,699 --> 01:10:54,952
No, no!  Please, don't, please!

822
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:58,580
Just on time, Deedee.
A very important element.

823
01:11:02,793 --> 01:11:06,713
The brain.  Binds the
broth together in a jelly of fear.

824
01:11:09,967 --> 01:11:13,011
<i>Fear the poor girl felt
before I ripped it from her head.</i>

825
01:11:13,845 --> 01:11:15,389
Fear...

826
01:11:16,723 --> 01:11:18,558
like you're feeling now.

827
01:11:19,017 --> 01:11:21,053
You're the killer?
- Bingo.

828
01:11:23,063 --> 01:11:28,485
There's only one more ingredient needed.
<i>Something very special.</i>

829
01:11:30,153 --> 01:11:33,407
Luber!  Oh, thank the gods!
Help me, please!

830
01:11:33,739 --> 01:11:34,467
<i>Help me!</i>

831
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:37,137
I cannot, great one,
unless she commands me.

832
01:11:37,406 --> 01:11:40,045
Luber, get me down
you fat pig!

833
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:41,999
<i>She is not your master.
I am your master!</i>

834
01:11:42,143 --> 01:11:43,250
She is my master.

835
01:11:43,834 --> 01:11:45,043
She has always
been my master.

836
01:11:46,253 --> 01:11:49,168
<i>Besides, she never calls
me fat and ugly like you do.</i>

837
01:11:50,436 --> 01:11:54,052
I am very sensitive
about my weight problem.

838
01:12:00,851 --> 01:12:02,769
Sweeney!

839
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:07,065
You and Erma look through there!
I'm gonna look down here.

840
01:12:07,372 --> 01:12:10,777
I want to come with you, Joe!
- Sweeney, just do it!

841
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:27,210
Do you know what I need, Deedee?

842
01:12:29,171 --> 01:12:31,089
Why don't you guess.

843
01:12:32,466 --> 01:12:35,802
Tears.  Just tears.

844
01:12:37,012 --> 01:12:39,598
Tears from a virgin
taken in sorrow.

845
01:12:41,308 --> 01:12:43,643
Are you a virgin, kiddo?

846
01:12:49,733 --> 01:12:51,526
Aren't we lucky.

847
01:12:53,153 --> 01:12:54,696
Go ahead, Lober.

848
01:12:55,030 --> 01:13:00,035
She's yours... but hurt her!
Hurt her bad!

849
01:13:02,621 --> 01:13:05,980
If you think you're gonna get
tears because this bozo bounces me

850
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:07,640
you're nuts, lady.

851
01:13:08,001 --> 01:13:10,212
No tears?

852
01:13:10,587 --> 01:13:15,842
No tears!

853
01:13:17,928 --> 01:13:19,596
You wanna bet!

854
01:13:29,473 --> 01:13:30,816
Daddy!

855
01:13:31,191 --> 01:13:32,109
Gotcha!

856
01:13:33,699 --> 01:13:34,699
Oh no...

857
01:13:56,174 --> 01:13:57,717
Why?  
- Why?

858
01:13:58,009 --> 01:13:59,511
To avenge my father.

859
01:14:00,554 --> 01:14:03,515
<i>Three men killed him,
and three will pay.</i>

860
01:14:07,686 --> 01:14:10,063
Number one will be 
Uncle Jack.

861
01:14:10,605 --> 01:14:14,526
Who turned my father into
the police so he could grab the formula.

862
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:18,947
Uncle?
- Oh, are you surprised, Uncle Jack?

863
01:14:20,448 --> 01:14:24,119
Stick me away in a convent
and run away!

864
01:14:24,536 --> 01:14:26,955
Why don't you run
away from this!

865
01:14:34,321 --> 01:14:34,721
<i>Oh no.</i>

866
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:41,986
No!  The tears of infinity!
Don't do this to me!

867
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:44,832
Don't do this to me, 
you can't do this to me!

868
01:14:54,482 --> 01:14:56,359
<i>Grace, don't kill him!</i>

869
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:58,987
I'll more than kill him.
Much more than kill.

870
01:15:00,421 --> 01:15:04,908
The taste of pure blood. I've reversed
my father's formula for purification.

871
01:15:05,073 --> 01:15:09,527
The body is shriveled and the
soul is locked in hell.

872
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:13,614
Until the end of time!

873
01:15:24,721 --> 01:15:29,059
Eternal damnation city.

874
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:33,771
Daddy... Daddy, I’m here!  
Hold on, please, hold on!

875
01:16:34,124 --> 01:16:37,252
And now Deedee, time for number two.
Daddy Taylor.

876
01:16:37,585 --> 01:16:41,771
If you put him in that stuff, I swear
I'll rip your guts out with my teeth!

877
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,635
Shut up!  Now do it to her,
and do it bad!

878
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:09,806
What about!
- I can't.

879
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,432
You what?
- I'm trying, I just can't.

880
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:15,623
You make me nervous
with that weird costume...

881
01:17:15,957 --> 01:17:19,912
You spoiling everything!
I need more tears!

882
01:17:34,601 --> 01:17:36,519
That's better!

883
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:46,196
Leave my father
alone, you crazy bitch!

884
01:17:47,989 --> 01:17:55,631
Somebody... anybody... help me!

885
01:17:59,292 --> 01:18:00,210
Joe!

886
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:02,359
Get off of her, you sweaty ape!

887
01:18:02,832 --> 01:18:04,701
Or I'll blow your ass off!

888
01:18:06,601 --> 01:18:09,606
Take him, Lober!
- Yes, highness.

889
01:18:12,263 --> 01:18:14,891
Stop him... or I'll shoot.
- No matter.

890
01:18:16,976 --> 01:18:18,269
I'll kill him!

891
01:18:27,258 --> 01:18:27,940
<i>Joe!</i>

892
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:31,699
<i>Joe!  Hit him!  Hit him hard!</i>
- Right... right.

893
01:18:50,385 --> 01:18:52,512
Joe, look out!  Look...

894
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,600
Joe!

895
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:05,150
Just who the hell are you!?

896
01:19:05,483 --> 01:19:10,405
Semmet Cairo's daughter.  
<i>Welcome, Joe Blocker, number three.</i>

897
01:19:11,281 --> 01:19:13,575
My vengeance is complete.

898
01:19:26,379 --> 01:19:28,965
Instead, in blackness,

899
01:19:29,674 --> 01:19:32,719
<i>void of breath.</i>

900
01:19:32,762 --> 01:19:35,805
Weep and swallow,

901
01:19:36,181 --> 01:19:39,767
endless death!

902
01:19:40,226 --> 01:19:42,687
What the hell is
that outfit?

903
01:19:44,022 --> 01:19:45,857
Do you think she's pretty?!

904
01:19:46,733 --> 01:19:52,060
Ahh!  It is Anubis,
dreadlord of the underground!

905
01:19:52,363 --> 01:19:54,464
Deedee!
- He comes to take us, highness!

906
01:19:54,741 --> 01:19:56,107
It is not Anubis, you fool!

907
01:19:56,107 --> 01:19:57,824
Sweeney!

908
01:19:59,121 --> 01:20:01,627
Keep him down!
<i>- It is Anubis!</i>

909
01:20:01,627 --> 01:20:04,159
It is not Anubis!
- It is Anubis!

910
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:06,743
Shit it's not loaded!

911
01:20:08,796 --> 01:20:10,465
It is not Anubis!

912
01:20:10,924 --> 01:20:13,593
The fuck it is!  
And I know Anubis when I see him!

913
01:20:14,219 --> 01:20:15,803
Sweeney, shoot!

914
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:18,973
Oh no!  Oh no!

915
01:20:50,213 --> 01:20:52,215
Anybody makes a move
and she buys it.

916
01:20:52,757 --> 01:20:56,094
Ear to little ear. Don't anybody
move a muscle!

917
01:21:24,747 --> 01:21:28,167
Let the girl go!
Now!

918
01:21:39,887 --> 01:21:45,602
I said let the girl go!
Anubis commands it!

919
01:21:56,029 --> 01:21:59,198
Damnit!  Anubis says
let her go!

920
01:22:16,674 --> 01:22:19,385
Come on you guys!
This way!

921
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,356
This is for my father!

922
01:22:37,487 --> 01:22:40,261
Ow! Stop biting!

923
01:23:37,964 --> 01:23:40,007
Alright, hold it right there lady!
I'll shoot!

924
01:23:40,508 --> 01:23:44,345
Joe, you better hope I hold it!
If I take my foot off this safety,

925
01:23:44,679 --> 01:23:46,889
this crusher's gonna turn
your bimbo into apple butter.

926
01:23:51,436 --> 01:23:54,480
You're under arrest!  You
have the right to remain silent.

927
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:59,113
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

928
01:23:59,345 --> 01:24:00,642
<i>in a court of law.</i>

929
01:24:00,642 --> 01:24:03,591
You have the right to talk to
a lawyer and him present

930
01:24:03,591 --> 01:24:06,191
with you while you are
being questioned.

931
01:24:06,324 --> 01:24:07,993
Put it down!
- No!

932
01:24:08,184 --> 01:24:09,996
Not this time, no nuts!

933
01:24:10,105 --> 01:24:13,563
This time, I'm gonna really give you 
something to remember!

934
01:24:13,563 --> 01:24:17,373
Like on the side of this bitch's face
and I'll throw it to you like a frisbee!

935
01:24:18,456 --> 01:24:20,089
Sweeney, shut up!
- ...guarantee those rights...

936
01:24:20,423 --> 01:24:21,674
Shut up, Sweeney!

937
01:24:21,966 --> 01:24:24,435
I gotta read her... her rights!

938
01:24:24,677 --> 01:24:26,345
Not this time!

939
01:24:32,393 --> 01:24:36,189
Sayonara, sweetheart!
You can kiss your father in hell!

940
01:24:38,232 --> 01:24:41,877
You can kiss my ass in the same place.
You're coming with me!

941
01:24:44,197 --> 01:24:45,239
Deedee!

942
01:24:53,664 --> 01:24:55,917
Come on!  Do it!
- Give it to her!

943
01:25:13,184 --> 01:25:16,152
You can throw up any time now, pussy!
<i>It's gonna get ugly!</i>

944
01:25:17,021 --> 01:25:22,276
Oh, I wouldn't wanna miss this one!
- I'll tell you...

945
01:25:22,735 --> 01:25:24,278
Limp dick!...

946
01:25:44,257 --> 01:25:45,758
Like spring rain.

947
01:26:08,471 --> 01:26:10,793
Tomato salmon casserole.

948
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:21,521
Ha ha ha!

949
01:26:22,022 --> 01:26:23,022
Woo!
