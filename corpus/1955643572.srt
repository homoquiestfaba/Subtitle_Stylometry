          You're in high school.
          You don't have        
          a future yet.         

325
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,260
       He wasn't talking        
       about his future.        

326
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,596
     - He was talking           
       about his virginity.     
     - I was not!               

327
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,366
          Okay, I was.          

328
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,435
    My virginity haunts me.     

329
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,403
                 Bullshit.      

330
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,505
         You wear your virginity
         like a thorny crown.   

331
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,941
    See, that's one of those    
  things that you always say,   

332
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,711
       and it sounds like       
      it means something,       
        but it doesn't.         

333
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,714
        Robby, would you<i> please</i> 
        stop talking about      
        your virginity?         

334
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,516
         <i> You know what Granddad</i>
         <i> once said to me?</i>      

335
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:50,487
    He said, "People equate     
    silence with brilliance,    

336
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,524
   and stillness with depth."   

337
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,192
   Yeah, uh-huh.                

338
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:57,628
That reminds me                 
of what my grandfather          
used to say.                    

339
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,896
"Tell your Grandmother

     into some sobby confession.

             your mouth shut.

             We're not going    
             anywhere but home. 

349
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,038
      Good evening, Officer.    
      Is there a problem?

                 Pez?           

428
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,650
           ( laughs )           
           I haven't seen       
           one of these since...

429
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,819
Well, it's either Pez           
or junk, Charlie.               

430
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,821
       - Yeah?                  
       - Yeah, your call.       

431
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,957
              ( chuckles )      
              What's that smell?

432
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,427
Smells like perfume.            

433
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:02,099
     Say...                     
     you boys...                

434
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,368
you ain't kinda, you know,      
"funny," are you?               

435
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,504
           ( laughs )           

436
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:10,006
   - Huh?                       
   -<i> ( C.J. lisping )</i>           
   <i>  You're hilarious, Chaz.</i>    

437
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:14,277
         - Shit.                
         - ( laughing )         

438
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,282
You've got something            
there on your                   

439
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,618
nice, clean                     
letter jacket, Scott.           

440
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,954
Looks like lipstick.            

441
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,190
         - Right there.         
         - Mm.                  

442
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,524
            Charlie:            
              <i> Mm.</i>              

443
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:34,731
 Lipstick                      
on your dipstick               

444
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,834
 Told a tale on you.          

445
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:40,470
          ( laughing )          

446
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,140
     - It's ketchup, okay?      
     - Uh-huh.                  

447
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,542
      Well, we can't have       
        the Yale jacket         
          besmirched.           

448
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,145
        That looms large        
         in his legend.         

449
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:53,049
          My brother--          
  All-Ivy League Quarterback,   
    two years running, Yale.    

450
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,651
          - Oh, great.          
          - Yeah.               

451
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:58,221
The guys from the Browns        
and Vikes are already           
scouting him and Reebok--       

452
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:01,458
Why don't we just pull          
over and form a small           
religion around the guy?        

453
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:04,026
Maybe make him a shrine         
of ice and call it              
a night, huh?                   

454
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,029
           Hey, look,           
      all I'm saying is...      

455
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,031
         it's more than         
     a letterman's jacket.      

456
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,033
          It's, uh...           

457
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,536
     - I don't know.            
       What would call it?      
     - Holy raiment.            

458
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,738
          Yeah, okay.           

459
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:18,641
      Look, all I'm saying      
     is my brother's never      
       lost at anything.        

460
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,443
           Anything.            

461
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,246
     We call it The Streak.     

462
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,451
        You want to take a right
        up here on Cedar, Scott.

463
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,502
       ( Cadillac engine        
           rumbles )            

464
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,403
       I think those guys       
           are back.            

465
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,038
              Who?              

466
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,750
    ( Cadillac engine revs )    

467
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,519
They sure are friendly.         

468
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,597
 Scott:                         
<i> What the hell's the deal</i>       
<i> with this clown?</i>               

469
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,333
  These guys friends            
  of yours?                     

470
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:22,104
        Charlie, are they acting
        like friends of ours?   

471
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,908
         C.J.:                  
        <i> You should've</i>          
        <i> slammed on your brakes,</i>

472
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,111
  - taught those                
    fuckers a lesson.           
  - That's nice language, son.  

473
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,680
          The language          
      comes with the face.      

474
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,984
    - Know what I'm saying?     
    - Sure do.                  

475
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,554
       This is what comes       
         from the hunt.         

476
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,359
       You must have some issues
       your own self, my friend.

477
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,362
            I don't have issues.

478
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,964
     - I don't sit              
       on things that long.     
     - How'd you get yours?     

479
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,367
       Me and my brother        
       were deer hunters,       

480
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,037
     but we don't use guns;     
         Bow and arrow,         

481
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:55,672
          in the name           
         of the sport.          

482
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,673
      Chuckles, how manly.      

483
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:00,877
       I hit this deer--        
    one shot, clean through     
           the heart.           

484
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,878
        I go to gut it,         

485
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,781
        but the buck has        
        life in him yet.        

486
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,983
           He swings his antler,
           and the damned point 

487
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,686
            cuts me right here  
            and just goes--     
            whack!              

488
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,688
          I knew what           
  the old buck was thinking--   

489
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,690
      "heart for a heart."      

490
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,691
         That's the way         
      of things, isn't it?      

491
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:21,231
   - Yours?                     
   - I got this Uncle Jimmy--   

492
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,234
         tripwire vet.          

493
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:26,837
          Crazy dude--          
          'Nam zombie.          

494
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,838
    <i> Takes me trout-fishing</i>     
         <i> by moonlight.</i>         

495
00:28:28,906 --> 00:28:30,840
            He says             
     that's the best time.      

496
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,842
         What the hell          
           do I know?           

497
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,011
    So, dumb ass that I am,     
      standing too close,       

498
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,081
       Uncle Jimmy casts        
         and hooks me.          

499
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,851
    Freaked and pulled away     
      leaving half my face      
          on the line.          

500
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,853
      And that's the story      
     of me and Uncle Jimmy.     

501
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:47,390
    I call it "When You Wish    
         Upon a Scar."          

502
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:50,026
    The thing about a scar--    

503
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,429
       you shouldn't try        
          to hide it.           

504
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:54,997
       You know, wear it        
         like a badge.          

505
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,801
     That way, it takes on      
       a kind of beauty.        

506
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,171
       Chicks dig scars.        

507
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,007
         You find that          
     to be the case, C.J.?      

508
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,544
       - I'm gonna miss         
         you, Chuckster.        
       - ( laughs )             

509
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,379
     But I can't say when.      

510
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,887
         What the hell          
        are they doing?         

511
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,259
Charlie, maybe you should       
do something, being a cop       
and all?                        

512
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,297
       Oh man.  I'm off-duty    
       and way too tired to deal
       with jokers like this.   

513
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,698
<i> Just go around 'em.</i>            

514

     <i> Well, so long, Caddy.</i>     

515
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,246
        Have a nice life.

                 ( engine revs )

519
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,199
      - What do they want?      
      - What do you think       
        they want--             

520
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:39,101
       they want to drag.       
      You gonna give them       
        what they want?         

521
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,437
            ( snorts )          
            With you in the car?

522
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,840
            I think I'd like    
            to keep my license. 

523
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,842
  I told you,                   
  I'm off-duty.                 

524
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,444
  If it was me,                 
  I'd kick their asses.

00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,494
           Holy shit!           
    They're killing my Saab!    

534
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,231
             Who are these guys?

535
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,239
       - Oh shit.               
       - Scott, back off.       

536
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,812
 - Scott, we gotta              
   get in that lane!            
 - C.J.:<i> He's right this time.</i>  

537
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,747
             Robby:             
            <i> Scott!</i>             

538
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,484
    - Jesus!  Oh God!           
    - ( truck horn blaring )    

539
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,451
( tires squeal )                

540
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,354
          ( screams )           

541
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,665
( whispers )                    
Holy shit.                      

542
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,435
       Now that                 
       was excellent!           

543
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,437
  <i> Whoo!</i>                        

544
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,713
Look at my goddamn              
car, man.                       

545
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,717
               Well, perhaps now
               is a good time   
               to re-evaluate   

546
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,219
          your over-the-top     
          attachment to material
          things.               

547
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,887
        ( laughs )              

548
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,589
        I gotta hand it         
         to you, Scott,         

549
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,891
     you're one mean mother     
       behind the wheel.        

550
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,795
    Look what those crackers    
         did to my car.         

551
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,963
I told you, Scott,              
you don't mess                  
with the Caddy.                 

552
00:33:55,866 --> 00:34:02,205
      Sorry.                    

553
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,106
         Whoa.                  

554
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:06,843
   God.  I tried                
   to call my brother.          

555
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:10,613
      The lines are down.       
      That's a bad storm!       

556
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:13,649
           Don't they           
       give you some kind       
    of walkie-talkie thing?     

557
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,985
          ( chuckles )          
          Yeah, right.          

558
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,489
                We gotta get    
                to a phone.     

559
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,658
      - I'm gonna               
        call Mom and Dad.       
      - No, you're not.         

560
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,928
              Well, then you    
              call them.        

561
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,397
         I'm sure they'll listen
         to Mr. All-State.      

562
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,400
     Hey, Robby, Dad can't      
        know about this.        

563
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,401
         That's death.          
         You know that.         

564
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,936
             Yeah, I know.      

565
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,339
 Charlie:                       
<i> Must be tough being</i>            
<i> the little brother.</i>            

566
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,943
Invisible in the light          
of the hero?                    

567
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,778
          Hey Charlie,          

568
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,613
            you talk            
       like you know us.        

569
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,615
         You don't know         
           anything,            

570
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:48,450
   so enough of the backwoods   
       psychiatry, okay?        

571
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,686
       - It's just making       
         things worse.          
       - ( sighs )              

572
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,089
     You had to come all the way
     to Wisconsin to get laid?  

573
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,558
         They don't have girls  
         back at Yale?          

574
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,559
         Well, they do,         

575
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,230
      but they're all kind      
      of Jodie Foster-ish.      

576
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,599
       <i> And my man Scott?</i>       

577
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,069
      <i> Well, he likes 'em</i>       
     <i> a little road-tested.</i>     

578
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,071
        Is that the way         
      you like 'em, Scott?      

579
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,374
        A little dusty?         
        A little dirty?         
          ( chuckles )          

580
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,677
     Charlie, what the hell     
          do you care?          

581
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,648
           Waitress:            
     <i> Storm took the power.</i>     

582
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,484
         Everybody out.         

583
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,528
         What the hell          
            is that?            

584
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,571
      Okay, what the hell       
            is this?            

585
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,641
    Well, it isn't fan mail.    

586
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:48,244
          Robby:<i> Sin?</i>           

587
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,246
           What sin?            

588
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,949
           Will find<i> who</i> out?   
           What the hell does   
           that mean?           

589
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:57,153
         It means Wisconsin is  
         getting too weird      

590
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:00,390
         and I really           
        <i> really want to go home.</i>

591
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,691
        I'm just looking        
   for a ride down the road,    

592
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,361
        and I'm off-duty        
      so I don't make any       
       judgments, but...        

593
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,931
         what the hell          
      you boys been up to?      

594
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,004
               This shit ain't  
               coming off, man. 

595
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,708
Did it just get darker?         

596
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,710
        ( engine revs )         

597
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,980
                Robby:          
               <i> Okay, let's deal</i>
               <i> with it, huh?</i>   

598
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,683
          <i> What's "it"?</i>         
          <i> Who did what, and who</i>
          <i> wrote that note?</i>     

599
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,552
  The guys in the Caddy.        

600
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:31,754
    -<i> It has to be.</i>             
    - Okay, so who did what?    

601
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,656
             C.J.?              

602
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,862
Well, I did sorta               
make this one chick             
leave it in her pants.          

603
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,630
       - What did you do?       
       -<i> Chuckles--</i>             

604
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,632
      I never<i> do</i> anything.      

605
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,869
        I just said some        
      stuff and this chick      
        got all geeked.         

606
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,871
         I mean, God--          
       Wisconsin chicks?        

607
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:50,873
         So sensitive.          

608
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,344
I tried to have sex             
with that girl back             
at the bar.                     

609
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:59,616
Jesus, maybe she has            
a big, mean boyfriend           
or something, huh?              

610
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,451
                  Jealousy--    
                  it's a killer.

611
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,219
   Oh God.                      

612
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,388
          Yeah, great.          
      I come to Wisconsin       
          to get laid.          

613
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,858
        I don't get laid        
     and now I'm gonna get      
         killed for it.         

614
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:11,660
  Just calm down, Robby.        
  It's nobody's boyfriend.      

615
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,662
  This is just random shit.     

616
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,499
  The note is just a mind-game, 
  so just relax, okay?          

617
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,334
  I told you I'm gonna          
  get you home.                 

618
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,203
             Okay.              

619
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,204
         ( mockingly )          
         Gosh, Scotty,          

620
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,939
        I wish you were         
      my big brother too.       

621
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,310
                 Where are we?  

622
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,312
  At the intersection,          
  take a left.                  

623
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,314
  A couple of miles             
  and I'm out.                  

624
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,764
        Anybody got any         
          breadcrumbs?          

625
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,781
       What is the deal?        

626
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,783
        ( engine revs )         

627
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,991
       Charlie, that road       
     they're leaving open?      

628
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,460
       <i> Does that get us</i>        
           <i> anywhere?</i>           

629
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,462
               Sure.            

630
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,465
      Deeper into nowhere.      

631
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,400
          <i> And Scott?</i>           
         <i> I'm off-duty</i>

   <i> and I got a wife waiting.</i>   
           <i> Let's go.</i>           

633
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:29,037
    You guys get the feeling    
 they're leading us somewhere?  

634
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,040
     Scott, given our lack      
     of choice here,            

635
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:32,775
      I suggest we take         
      what we're given.         

636
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,776
          Charlie, you're a cop.

637
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:38,147
              What would you do?

638
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,883
   Listen to C.J.               
   Take that road               

639
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,818
   and get us                   
   the hell home.               

640
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,990
     - Charlie, let me          
       ask you a question.      
     - Shoot.                   

641
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:52,428
     Why would I want to go     
     where they want me to?     

642
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,175
            Yee-haw!            

643
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:08,176
             <i> Whoo!</i>             

644
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:10,846
Oh, that Caddy's history!       
Scott, you da man!              

645
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,782
             Yeah!              
    Those mothers are toast!    

646
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,783
  Did I not tell you?           
  Did I not?                    

647
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,786
  My brother, man,              
  he never loses.               

648
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,121
Whoo!                           
The Streak lives!               

649
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,623
          - Ha-- ahh!!          
          - Oh, Jesus!          

650

    Scott!

653
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,606
   Why are they doing this?!    

654
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,868
   All right, now that we've    
    gotten our ya-ya's out,     

655
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,772
      pull over, I'm gonna      
      put a stop to this.       

656
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,046
       - Slow down, man.        
       - ( tires squeal )       

657
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,650
        Scott, back off!        

658

  <i> Slow down, Scott!</i>

660

            Oh shit.            

663

             These fucking guys!

  <i> They're trying to kill us.</i>   

665
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:33,756
        Oh Jesus, Scott,        
   they're trying to kill us.   

666
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,761
           I'm okay, by the way.

667
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,131
          Why is this           
        happening to us?        

668
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,134
           I don't know why     
           this is happening.   

669
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,970
              I just wanted     
              a ride home.      

670
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,838
       They want us dead, Scott.

671
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,543
        They don't want         
        us dead, Robby.         

672
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,512
         They want him.         

673
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,287
         Hey, Charlie.          

674
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,324
    How come you were so hot    
   for me to drag those guys    
       in the Caddy, huh?       

675
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:10,325
      <i> And why didn't you</i>       
       <i> flash your badge</i>

     You wanted to get away     
     from them, didn't you?     

678
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,166
      Jesus Christ, Scott.      
      What are you doing?       

679
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,636
        Look, before we         
       picked up Charlie,       

680
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,072
       nobody was trying        
    to run us off the road,     

681
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,374
     nobody was scratching      
          this spooky           

682
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,010
         biblical crap          
       on the windshield.       

683
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,012
     <i> After we pick him up</i>      

684
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,983
        there's nothing         
         but this shit.         

685
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:37,486
         They want you          
         for your sins.         

686
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,156
       Isn't that right,        
            Charlie?            

687
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,659
 C.J.:                          
<i> Yeah, the message</i>              
<i> on the windshield--</i>            

688
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,661
     I'm not one to judge,      
           Chuckster,           

689
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:49,497
       but what'd you do?       

690
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:52,501
       ( brief chuckle )        
     Hey, whatever it is...     

691
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,272
     you're not dragging us     
         down with you.         

692
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,240
              No.               

693
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,342
          You're going          
         back to Yale.          

694
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,011
           ( laughs )           

695
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,013
     That's right, Charlie.     

696
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,915
    And you're staying here.    

697
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,916
         Come on, guys,         
           let's go.            

698
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,888
         Have you lost          
           your mind?           

699
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,991
    We can't just leave him     
       here for the Caddy       
          or the cold.          

700
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,093
          He's a cop.           
     Jesus, Scott-- a cop!      

701
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:20,629
                 Here's a flash,
                 chief--        

702
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,632
                 he's a bad cop.

703
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,567
       and whatever bad-cop shit
       he did to those guys     

704
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:28,070
          is between their ass  
          and his, and not mine.

705
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:30,072
Look, I say                     
we give him a ride.             

706
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:33,442
It's just a couple              
more miles.                     

707
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:35,444
                    This is not 
                    a democracy.

708

710
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,585

             Okay.              

713
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,228
         If I wanted to,        
         I could draw my weapon

          say another word about
          any of this to anyone.

745
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,369
              I'll get you home,
              Robby.            

746
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,089
      Everyone in the car       
     that thinks the storm      
           did this,            

747
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,991
        raise your hand.        

748
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,829
        Where are they?         

749
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:07,155
     - Fuck.                    
     - We can't go back,        
       we can't go forward.     

750
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:12,628
  We could take that road       
  that happens to be right      
  in front of the tree.         

751
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:18,300
       They're leading us       
      deeper into nowhere.      

752
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:20,302
       I'd rather be led        
          than caught.          

753
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:51,667
         Scott, this is         
       awfully romantic.        

754
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,736
     I know what I'm doing.     

755
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,351
           We'll wait           
       the bastards out.        

756
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:14,056
Hey, kill the engine.           
He can see our exhaust.         

757
00:48:44,754 --> 00:48:46,688
          Just keep going, baby.

758
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,790
                Just keep going.

759
00:48:53,863 --> 00:48:56,531
I mean,                         
what do they want?              
They got Charlie.               

760
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,533
           Witnesses.           

761
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,037
       They gotta get rid       
       of the witnesses.        

762
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,907
      - I didn't ask            
        to be a witness.        
      - Nobody ever does.       

763
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,377
         Man, I wonder          
       what Charlie did.        

764
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,379
<i> Whatever it was,</i>               

765
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,380
<i> I hope it was</i>                  
<i> worth it.</i>                      

766
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,217
         Where the hell         
            are we?             

767
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,486
           ( sighs )            
         We're so lost.         

768
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:20,655
   There's a map in the glove   
       compartment there.       

769
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,463
          No, no, no.           
          Come on, come on.     
          They'll see the light.

770
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,965
            I got one of these  
            fluorescent tube    
            things in here.     

771
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,638
                 Give me that.  

772
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:38,640
   Okay, the thing with maps    
       is they only help        

773
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,642
      if you have kind of       
     an idea where you are.     

774
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,277
        We have no idea         
         where we are.          

775
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:44,279
  C.J.:                         
 <i> Okay, well...</i>                 

776
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:47,249
  we'll look at the map,        
  find that really              
  spooky tree                   

777
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,251
  we drove past                 
  like three times              

778
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,255
  and then go left              
  to the rusted tractor         

779
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,657
  and then go to right          
  to that shack where           

780
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,594
   - I'm pretty sure            
     someone<i> was</i> killed.        
   - Look, will you shut up?    

781
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,596
      I'm trying to get us      
          out of here.          

782
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,564
         Where the hell         
     is the Minnesota line?     

783
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,565
We're never getting             
out of here.                    

784
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,138
 Robby:                         
<i> I can't feel</i>                   
<i> my feet.</i>                       

785
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,010
    - I can't feel my hands.    
    - Jesus Christ.             

786
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,678
<i> But, really,</i>                   

787
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,514
      I really don't want       
          to die here.          

788
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:23,651
        I mean, I really        
       don't want to die,       
      but really not here.      

789
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,254
      Robby, will you keep      
     this shit to yourself?     

790
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,525
          I was hoping          

791
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,929
       maybe by the time        
          I graduated           

792
00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,297
        -<i> there would</i>           
        <i> </i> be this girl.         
        - Oh man.               

793
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,199
<i> You know, I can</i>                
<i> almost see her face.</i>           

794
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,302
           This girl            
      who would love me...      

795
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:43,872
       without me having        
        to say anything.        

796
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:50,612
      And her laugh would       
       echo down the hall       
          after math.           

797
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:53,949
   I heard people               
   can have this thing          
   happen to them--             

798
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,919
   a moment that changes        
   their lives forever.         

799
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,690
<i> I always hoped</i>                 
<i> I'd have one of those,</i>         

800
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,726
          so I didn't           
         have to be...          

801
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:12,534
      - so me.                  
      - Nobody wants to be      
        who they are, man.      

802
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,106
         God, we all have       
         shit inside of us      
         that we wish we didn't.

803
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,108
                But we do.      

804
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,610
           And there's nothing  
           we can do about that,
           I mean--             

805
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,812
           I don't think we can 
           change that stuff.   

806
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,815
       So what's the best       
        we can hope for?        

807
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,585
                Forgiveness.    

808
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:33,054
       Well, that doesn't       
         come so easy.          

809
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,024
 Robby:                         
<i> You know what's weird?</i>         

810
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:37,692
      The last time we saw      
          that Caddy,           

811
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,594
      I think I saw a girl      
       in the back seat.        

812
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,764
    - Really?                   
    - But I couldn't            
      see her face so good.     

813
00:51:42,832 --> 00:51:45,767
           It's "well," okay?   
           You couldn't see     
           her face so<i> well.</i>    

814
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,603
           God, I hate it       
           when people do that--
           good instead of well.

815
00:51:48,671 --> 00:51:51,540
       It's like when           
       bad teachers ask you     
       "Is there any questions?"

816
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,510
          It's<i> "Are</i> there       
          any questions?"       
          I fucking hate that.  

817
00:51:57,081 --> 00:52:00,381
    Look, I've been thinking    
       about that note--        

818
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,718
       on the windshield?       

819
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,120
         Then Charlie.          
    Why after they kill him,    

820
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:06,888
         are they still         
       trying to kill us?       

821
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,290
        C.J. was right.         
       It's because we're       
           witnesses.           

822
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,960
     <i> Yeah, I know,</i>             
     <i> but why haven't they</i>      
     <i> done it already?</i>          

823
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:13,962
           You know,            
        they could have,        

824
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:16,365
    back there when we were     
      sitting by the tree.      

825
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,136
      You know, they seem       
  to be leading us someplace.   

826
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:24,506
              Why?              
           To where?            

827
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,409
        <i> Maybe they keep</i>        
      <i> coming back because</i>      

828
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,511
          they killed           
         the wrong guy.         

829
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,780
           ( scoffs )           
          Robby, man,           
     you are eating brain.      

830
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,249
        And that note--         
          about sins?           

831
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,553
 Maybe it wasn't Charlie's sin  
        they were after.        

832
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,922
        <i> You know, maybe</i>        
     <i> it was meant for us.</i>      

833
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,458
           One of us.           

834
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:48,095
          Oh, that's right.     

835
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:50,098
          Yeah, blame C.J.      

836
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,601
          The ever-handy Judas. 

837
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:56,705
          I called two guys     
          in a bar "fat."       

838
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,041
             They kill you      
             for that?          

839
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:04,079
        I don't think so,       
        which brings us back    
        to you, Roberta.        

840
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:05,680
            - Me?               
            -<i> Yeah!</i>             

841
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,850
    Maybe while your friend     
    was smoking your bone       
    in the back room            

842
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:11,519
    her gap-toothed old man     
    was plotting your           
    castration.                 

843
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:14,121
        Then why hasn't         
      he done it already?       
      You know, I think--       

844
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,925

        She's down there

01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:19,293
    She was just going along    
      for the ride, I bet.

         Now she's dead

You talk about sin.

         with those goons, okay?

982
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:33,507

 How I got the scar?            

1059
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:31,625

this Bengalese tiger

      looking for my wife.      

1124
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,937
         And I find her         
        at the roadhouse        

1125
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,407
   where I figure she's been    
  hooking up with another man.

  <i> But it wasn't another man,</i>   
         <i> it was a boy.</i>

01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,633
      - Charlie, I have         
        something to say--      
      - No, you don't.          

1130
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:30,838

         pretty little panties  

1132
01:18:33,074 --> 01:18:34,974
         in the back of a Saab. 

1133
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:37,878
              A burgundy Saab.  

1134
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:44,084
   So before I kill somebody,   

1135
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:48,488
       I gotta make sure.       

1136
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:54,528
Which one of you                
in that car took my wife?       

1137
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:57,530
Took my life from me?           

1138
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:02,235
She didn't name names,          
bless her little heart.         

1139
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,071
( chuckles )                    

1140
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:07,340
That's why I got in your car,   
I wanted to watch you boys      
behind a wheel.                 

1141
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,543
     And Robby,                 

1142
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:14,648
when I smelled my wife          
on your brother's jacket...     

1143
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:18,819
  well, game over.              

1144
01:19:21,322 --> 01:19:24,825
    Tonight could have been     
       a dream come true.       

1145
01:19:24,894 --> 01:19:28,995
     <i> If I had just gotten</i>      
<i> ol' Mr. Cream-Jeans here alone,</i>

1146
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:33,099
   I thought I'd done it too,   
     but then zipper face,      

1147
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:37,370
      he goes and puts on       
     the wrong damn jacket      
    at the wrong damn time.     

1148
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:40,006
           So we had            
      to use him as bait.       

1149
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:42,776
        <i> Do us a little</i>

       And lo and behold,       

1151
01:19:45,613 --> 01:19:49,949
  we caught ourselves a couple  
  of Minnesota dickless perch.

       Now I take yours.        

1161
01:20:24,086 --> 01:20:26,653

1162
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:29,322
           a heart for a heart. 

1163
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,926
   Charlie, stop it!            

1164
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:35,229
        -<i> Just stop it!</i>         
        - You shut up!

gonna do to me that you         
ain't already done?             

1166
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:41,334
 - Get back in the car.         
 -<i> What, what are you gonna do?</i> 

1167
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:43,636
