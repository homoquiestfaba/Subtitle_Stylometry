1
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:19,880
I, Zeus, the father of Mankind
and long its benefactor,

2
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:25,018
decreed ions ago that the time
of the Gods in the world of

3
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:31,392
Man had past. By then, I had
fathered many children, some

4
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:36,930
divine, some mortal -- all of
them possessing skills needed

5
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:42,436
to further the humans taming
of a dangerous cosmos. One of

6
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:47,241
my sons was Hercules and his
strength is spoken of to this

7
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,642
day.

8
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:57,318
However, my wife, Hera,
was jealous of Hercules...

9
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:02,690
I am Hera, wife of Zeus. I
will never understand his

10
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:06,560
fondness for his mortal
offspring, particular those

11
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:10,764
sired by others, undeserving.
Hercules was the most

12
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:17,271
offensive; his gifts wasted.
So, I vowed to murder him.

13
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,028
I am Athena, Goddess of
wisdom. Knowing of Hera's

14
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:45,165
drive to kill Hercules, and
seeing his potential, I

15
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,168
proposed sheltering him,
hoping her murderous intent

16
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:51,539
would wane. But even I could
not foresee what would

17
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,774
happen at my retreat.

18
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,863
Athena, what's the
meaning of this?

19
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,599
How do you mean, Hercules?

20
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:55,436
Why did you summon me here? My
studies, my friends, my

21
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,606
mother, they all
reside in the city.

22
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,275
Sometimes we learn most when
we are removed

23
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,376
from what we know.

24
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,145
Aw, You speak in riddles. You
always have.

25
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,582
I wish to further your
studies. To perhaps embolden

26
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,150
your physical strengths .

27
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,253
I am the son of Zeus, I have
physical strength

28
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,388
beyond all men.

29
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,492
Excuse me, Athena, is now
a good time?

30
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:22,430
Yes. Please meet Hercules.
Hercules, this is your

31
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:25,032
trainer, Pronax. He's fought
valiantly in many campaigns.

32
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,505
The mighty Hercules. Your
reputation grows.

33
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,975
As it should, my brother.
Forgive me, but I still don't

34
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,846
know why I'm here. But I
will amuse Athena. If

35
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,514
you'll excuse me.

36
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,986
You haven't told him of Hera's
anger towards him?

37
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,322
He knows her intent, but not
how close

38
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:49,657
she is to succeeding.

39
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:54,628
He would be wise to increase
his humility; hubris only

40
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:57,831
clouds ones reaction or lack
there of in matters

41
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:58,966
such as this.

42
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:04,438
I know. I fear it may one day
be his undoing. I will work to

43
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:08,842
convince him to let go his
over- chilliest attitude.

44
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,178
Your wisdom will no doubt help
him. I will prepare to

45
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,046
meet the others.

46
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,397
Why are you following me?

47
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,966
Whoo, Apologies, friend. I was
merely hoping we might travel

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,302
together. The only two
destinations for anyone out

49
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:40,073
here are the Warrior's
Training Camp.. And oblivion.

50
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,309
I'm surprised you caught me.
Not many do.

51
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,578
I can see that. I'm Thestor.

52
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,983
Dolon. I don't wish to let the
sun set before our arrival.

53
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,285
The plains can be dangerous
come nightfall.

54
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,355
Understood.
How did you come to be invited

55
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,391
to the Warrior's training
Camp?

56
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,993
I am a runner. That is what
the Gods have blessed me with.

57
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:04,632
Clearly. I am sadly a master
of no one pursuit, but wish

58
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,468
to learn more. Though I
clearly will not

59
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,102
best you on foot.

60
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,907
I was invited by a minion from
Athena herself. Apparently my

61
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,944
renown gains favor. I am
honored regardless.

62
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,681
As you should. I fought
alongside Pronax, the lead

63
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,851
trainer. What he saw in me I'm
unsure, but I certainly

64
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,719
admire his patronage.

65
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:31,124
You know I've heard rumors
that this is to be a very

66
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,627
special retreat for the.
warrior set.

67
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:36,697
All retreats are special. It
is an honor regardless.

68
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:44,271
Even if there are rumors of a
certain warrior's presence.

69
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,541
I pay no attention to
rumors and gossip.

70
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,409
Of course, Dolon...

71
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:52,946
We are already honored. To
wonder about the Gods

72
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,949
intentions and machinations is
only inviting trouble.

73
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,318
Even if we are training with
the mighty Hercules?

74
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,658
Perhaps we should run the rest
of the way.

75
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,760
Thestor... Thestor, were you
serious?

76
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:21,241
Abderus! You miserable dog!

77
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,144
Hercules! It has been
too long.

78
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,980
Yes, How many seasons have
passed since our childhood?

79
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,115
Many.

80
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,986
Oh, I have heard of your
heroics in battle. I always

81
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,055
knew you would make good.

82
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,357
High praise indeed from the
mighty Hercules.

83
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,693
Your reputation grows.

84
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:43,230
My travels are certainly
worthy of praise. Just the

85
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:47,668
beginning, let me tell you. In
fact you must already be

86
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,070
famous just for having
befriended me as a child.

87
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:50,604
I suppose...

88
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:55,342
I told Athena if she wishes my
presence here to train a new

89
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,680
generation of warriors, so be
it. I mean after all who

90
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,415
couldn't use advice from
the mighty Hercules?

91
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,252
Who indeed?

92
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:09,923
Come inside, have some drink
before your education starts.

93
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,202
Pronax.

94
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,371
Capaneous. I'm glad you came.

95
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:28,275
You summoned me. It's not
everyday one is called to the

96
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,277
warrior's retreat. Though I'm
confused as to why?

97
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,379
My abilities on the
battlefield and in the ring

98
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,315
speak for themselves. I
have no equal.

99
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:40,654
That may well be, but this is
a unique opportunity. One I

100
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,156
didn't think you
would mind indulging.

101
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,992
I respect your
accomplishments. I

102
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,394
wouldn't have bothered
traveling here if I didn't.

103
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,929
Athena is here.

104
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,531
So I heard. That can't be
the only reason.

105
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,466
Hercules is here.

106
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,403
Hercules... So I might
actually get to spar with the

107
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,339
'mighty' one himself?

108
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,207
Indeed.

109
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,375
You have done me a service,
Pronax.

110
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,977
I thought you might
be pleased.

111
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,378
Very.

112
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,316
We will start on the
training grounds at sunrise,

113
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,453
I will sleep well then.

114
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:21,228
Have the warrior's you
championed arrived?

115
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,964
Yes. The final one
just arrived.

116
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,232
Yes. The final one
just arrived.

117
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,267
It is a small compliment, but
they will most certainly be

118
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,537
kept busy. I sought out
fighters who would challenge

119
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,272
each other in many
different ways.

120
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,575
Good. I don't want any of
them, Hercules especially,

121
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:39,346
finding out the true purpose
of this ruse. Hera's treachery

122
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,781
must not find purchase here.

123
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,049
Of course.

124
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,052
Good. Then, I will check in on
you and your men at daylight.

125
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,756
Everything will go as planned.
I'm sure of it.

126
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,257
I hope so.

127
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:14,147
I summoned here today for one
Reason because you are the

128
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:21,154
very best. War is my
profession and as such, I make

129
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,958
it my concern to know who I
want fighting by my side.

130
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:29,062
Thanks to Athena's patronage,
you've been given an

131
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:32,733
opportunity to further your
training. Take a look around,

132
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:36,469
one of these men may one day.
save your life..

133
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:37,905
Let's begin.

134
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,953
Haha I don't care..

135
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,192
Stop this there will be
plenty more sparring...

136
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,094
Hercules wishes to
test his metal.

137
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:58,330
Oh I have nothing to test. No
mortal is my equal. In case

138
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,431
you hadn't heard.

139
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,067
Back away.

140
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,870
Should we stop them, Pronax?

141
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:07,139
No. Let them release their
aggression... for a moment.

142
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,165
You cannot win.

143
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,500
I will...

144
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:42,609
Alright, You won't. The sooner
you are aware of that fact,

145
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:43,242
the better.

146
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:48,414
I'll show the rest of you what
I know after we eat. I'm

147
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,683
actually thirsty. Not bad.

148
00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:59,859
Should we go after him?

149
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,028
Not if we wish to walk back
with all our limbs intact.

150
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,464
Capaneous will need to curb
his anger, or it will

151
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,133
consume him.

152
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,985
Must you antagonize everyone?

153
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,154
I assume you've been
watching me?

154
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,556
Your performance makes for
excellent theatre.

155
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,725
Do I sense you disapprove?

156
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:36,062
I want you to take this
seriously.You seem to think

157
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,031
being born of the Gods makes
you immortal.

158
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:42,334
You seem to forget, I am
as close to immortal as a

159
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:46,238
man can be. Fear not,
Athena, nothing can touch me.

160
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:51,177
Oh, how wrong you
are Hercules.

161
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,354
Capaneous...

162
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,491
Who is there?

163
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,859
It is I, Hera...

164
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,195
What trickery is this?

165
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,230
Do you not wish to rid
yourself Of Hercules?

166
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:16,635
Did he not embarrass you, rob
you of your well

167
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:17,970
earned manhood?

168
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,171
Yes.

169
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:25,244
You are a champion. A mortal
champion, your talents were

170
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,345
hard fought.

171
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,848
Hercules is but a plaything of
Zeus.

172
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:33,753
Ha, Bold words, from a bold
man. But if you wish Hercules

173
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:38,557
dead, you will have to do it
properly. And you will need

174
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,793
the proper ingredients.

175
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,428
How do you mean?

176
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,998
Just listen, my human champion
and be quick about it.

177
00:27:56,642 --> 00:28:00,112
Mighty Zeus, I have tried
reason, but other measures

178
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:03,182
must be taken if
Hercules is made to be aware

179
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:06,485
of the dangers that constantly
swirl around him.

180
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,255
I wish only the best for
my son, Athena.

181
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:15,094
Hercules is vain, proud. He
must find some measure of

182
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:18,530
humility, or he will never
even be aware of the dangers

183
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:21,600
around him, and all his skills
will be for naught.

184
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,736
I trust you to teach him.

185
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:28,775
Well there is a potion
of herbs I can concoct,

186
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:32,812
that may lessen his youthful
hubris, at least I hope.

187
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:35,614
I must try everything to
protect him from Hera,

188
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,617
and from himself, as
is your will..

189
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:44,223
Do what you will. But
know this, if anything

190
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:47,659
happens to Hercules
under your care, I will

191
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:52,498
hold you responsible. And
my punishment will be

192
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,033
most severe.

193
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,902
Yes, Zeus.

194
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,354
Hera, my heart and mind
are yours, clever Goddess.

195
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:48,087
Did you enjoy the food?

196
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,958
Ohh, Yes.. The servants
here are good, I'm

197
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:54,660
actually starting to
enjoying my time here.

198
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,029
Try this tea. It is full
of herbal extracts...

199
00:29:57,063 --> 00:30:01,067
I hope it may relax you
and perhaps open your mind.

200
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:06,072
Since when did you become a
seer, Athena?

201
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:08,240
And yet you always
have a remedy for

202
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:11,277
some malady that does
not exist. But I will

203
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,212
humor you yet again.

204
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:20,052
I simply want you to
Understand what you are

205
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:23,222
up against. You must
be free of your pride.

206
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,524
My pride serves me well.

207
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,960
Regardless, I will host a
dinner for you and the

208
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,261
others tonight.

209
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:34,533
I would not miss it. I can't
speak for the others warriors.

210
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:38,170
Enjoy your rest. I hope we
might talk again later.

211
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:41,440
Of course. Thank you..

212
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,760
Has Capaneous arrived?

213
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,264
Yes, He has. He seemed more
contrite than I

214
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,732
would have guessed.

215
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,101
I'm hosting a meal later,
To officially welcome

216
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:50,902
everyone. Please tell
the men.

217
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:51,903
Of course.

218
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,839
Will the training be the same
tomorrow?

219
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:55,041
Yes.

220
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:58,210
You are a good man, Pronax.
You will teach them well...

221
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:45,751
...So the entire food cart is
upended, gold scattered

222
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:48,587
everywhere, but because of the
sorry state of the donkey, no

223
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,055
one went near it.

224
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,895
Are you feeling well,
Hercules?

225
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,365
I am fine.

226
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,400
Perhaps you have
over indulged?

227
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:06,472
Perhaps. I will be ready
tomorrow. Good night.

228
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,776
You seem content..

229
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:11,777
Oh, I am, Pronax.

230
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:16,982
You have quite the way with
words Thestor. Too bad your

231
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:19,318
skills in battle
don't quite match.

232
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:22,654
It will be a longer day
of training tomorrow. I

233
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:25,191
recommend you take your
leave. I look forward to

234
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:28,260
your competitive spirits
taking hold in the morning.

235
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:31,463
Thank you, Pronax.I look
forward to the competition..

236
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:33,064
For its own sake.

237
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:37,669
Indeed... A competition for
the sake of competition....

238
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:43,141
A Competition for the glory of
it. And for the glory of the

239
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:46,111
Gods... sounds promising.
I encourage you to continue

240
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,313
with the idea,

241
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,381
Thank you... I will.

242
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:51,317
Good night.

243
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:20,939
I am out of sorts...
I seem to have felt this

244
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:21,940
injury all day...

245
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,645
It is fine Hercules. Rest up.
See how you feel when we start

246
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,313
sword training later.

247
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:30,348
Thanks..

248
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:39,791
It seems Hercules is only
'mighty' when it suits him. I

249
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:42,594
wonder if he is the same
in the bed chamber?

250
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:44,630
Convenient you can speak to
the man behind his back.

251
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,233
are you his protector? Or
his pet?

252
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,936
Stop this , Save it for sword
training. You will regret

253
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:52,370
wasting your energy.

254
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:55,440
You would be wise not to
challenge me or my honor.

255
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:02,413
This is most unbecoming of our
station.

256
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:05,784
True, but perhaps then you can
be the partner of Capaneous in

257
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,518
sword training.

258
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,231
I was looking for you.
How are you feeling?

259
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:22,934
Fine...

260
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:27,472
You are anything but. You were
never a good liar, even when

261
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:28,807
we were boys.

262
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,444
Abderus... I... have
lost my power.

263
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:38,416
Perhaps you are sick? Or
perhaps if you go to a seer?

264
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,453
No. I simply do not have the
strength and power I always

265
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:45,056
had... I mean I have mortal
strength, but...

266
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,726
Who wants to compete against
the sad weakness

267
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:48,593
of us mortals?

268
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,029
That is not what I meant.

269
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,931
You could have fooled me.

270
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:58,403
I know I have not bin best of
friends to you Abderus..

271
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:00,038
but I am simply just ...

272
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:01,306
Scared?

273
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:06,011
Human. And apparently. I'm
subject to the same frailties

274
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:11,950
I do not like it, Abderus... I
am not myself... I know you

275
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,885
have every right to
mock me but...

276
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:17,088
I would not do that.
You are not well, and

277
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:19,958
no matter your temperament,
It does not please

278
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:23,762
me. Now what will you do?

279
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:27,933
I will... hope. But
for now please... let

280
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:32,270
me be. I am not good
company... nor have I bin..

281
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:47,052
I know all of you are familiar
with hand and hand Combat

282
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:51,022
im sure you utilize your
skills in battle. As such,

283
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:55,060
I'm looking to go beyond
basic drills. I want to

284
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:57,763
see you utilize the
skills you do have

285
00:44:57,796 --> 00:44:59,264
and add new ones.

286
00:45:22,788 --> 00:45:25,390
Always keep a eye out
for a vulnerable point,

287
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:29,460
an Injury you can
capitalize on. Trust me

288
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:31,129
They will be looking to

289
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:32,798
find your weakness as well.

290
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:43,875
Capaneous, Abderus...

291
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:48,780
Abderus, please...

292
00:45:48,814 --> 00:45:51,516
Abderus. Your master calls
you, Perhaps you should

293
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:52,583
go to him?

294
00:45:52,617 --> 00:45:54,719
I need no man's help
to beat you.

295
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,553
Stop this..

296
00:45:58,957 --> 00:45:59,958
No

297
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,126
It was an accident...

298
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:02,727
Stop this madness..

299
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,862
You tried to kill my friend...

300
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,997
I did no such thing...
He attacked me..

301
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:10,001
He was the aggressor
You saw him, you all saw him..

302
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:13,839
Stand down to me Hercules...
stand down or fight me in a

303
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:17,809
battle of honor. It is my
right, is it not Pronax?

304
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:19,644
It is your right, Capaneous.
But...

305
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:25,616
Then it is. Yield to me.
Yield to me or fight me.

306
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:30,188
I will fight you... at any
time or place..

307
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:33,391
If you are not here, Tomorrow
morning at sunrise.

308
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:37,062
I will take it as
your coward.

309
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:40,031
I have erred in my judgment
In bringing him here.

310
00:46:40,065 --> 00:46:42,800
I am sorry Hercules.
Let me speak to him...

311
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:45,703
No, Just let me go.

312
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,815
How is Abderus?

313
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:02,620
His ribs are clearly cracked..
But his breathing appears

314
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,590
normal. He will need
much time to heal .

315
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,566
Hera... it is done,
as you said...

316
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,770
Of course it is. But we
Must ensure your victory

317
00:47:19,804 --> 00:47:21,339
and Hercules demise.

318
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,876
Victory is ensured... I can
kill him without any help...

319
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:28,980
Do not be foolish, you
will do as I say. You

320
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:33,284
will prepare another mixture
and coat your sword in it.

321
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:36,922
One touch will finish him.

322
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:38,523
But you don't
understand I can ...

323
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:45,330
No. I am telling you to do as
I say or face my wrath.

324
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:08,186
Athena, what do you wish to
discuss...

325
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,388
Your powers are gone.

326
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:11,722
How did you know?

327
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:13,758
Hera gave you a potion...

328
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,393
When?

329
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:19,830
In the tea I made for you.
Capaneous snuck in my chamber

330
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:21,967
and put it there. At
Hera's bidding.

331
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:30,841
This is all my fault. You
warned me to the dangers, but

332
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:33,044
I chose to ignore all
the signs.

333
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:36,481
And now my best friend is
wounded and I face my

334
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:37,715
doom tomorrow.

335
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,351
No. You may have
lost your powers,

336
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:43,654
but you are still a strong,
and capable man.

337
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:46,791
You have it in you
to defeat him.

338
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:49,027
I am but a shell
without my gifts.

339
00:48:49,995 --> 00:48:53,098
Don't you see, you are
so much more than

340
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:55,266
your powers. That is
what I've been trying to

341
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,269
teach you all along. It's
your heart and mind

342
00:48:58,303 --> 00:49:00,305
that dictate your success.

343
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:03,541
Without my powers
i am nothing.

344
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,745
Then you will perish . And
I along with you.

345
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,347
How do you mean?

346
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,383
Zeus instructed me to
protect you. He made it

347
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:15,453
clear, if anything should
happen to you,

348
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:17,955
my fate would be sealed.

349
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:20,325
But that is not fair.

350
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:25,496
But life is not fair Hercules.
Not for you, not for me.

351
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:29,034
Either use the powers you
have always had to

352
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:31,602
defeat Capaneous,
or we both will perish

353
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:32,903
for naught.

354
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,707
What do I do?

355
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:39,244
There is one thing that
may be in your favor...

356
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:42,880
but you must decide
how best to use it.

357
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,802
Hercules... I'm glad you came.

358
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:10,007
Abderus, I'm so sorry, for
getting you in such a state.

359
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,310
I didn't mean for you to
fight my battles.

360
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:17,548
That is what friends do.
And I will survive. But you

361
00:50:17,582 --> 00:50:18,816
must do one thing for me.

362
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,685
What is it? If I can, I will.

363
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,853
Beat him.

364
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:27,458
I'm not sure if I can. I've
bin poisoned at Hera's

365
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:31,729
request. I may never regain my
Gods given strength.

366
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:35,633
It doesn't matter. You can
beat him without it.

367
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,768
I'm not so sure...

368
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:39,570
I am.

369
00:50:39,604 --> 00:50:43,508
Capaneous is as we speak
looking to coat his sword

370
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,042
in a deadly poison.

371
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:48,012
Even better. Now listen to
me, so I may tell you

372
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,080
a strategy that will work...

373
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:12,723
Where is Hercules?

374
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:15,660
I am here.

375
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:18,363
I didn't think you would show.

376
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:22,600
I fear no man... Or should I
say the puppet of a woman.

377
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:24,835
Are you sure you both wish to
continue?

378
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:25,803
Yes.

379
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:27,004
Hurry up.

380
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,673
Capaneous has brought
his own sword,

381
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:29,774
as is his right.

382
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:32,777
Do you wish to choose your
weapon, Hercules?

383
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:37,214
These are both
sturdy and true.

384
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:40,150
Thank you, Thestor.

385
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,455
The fight will continue
until one concedes..

386
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,528
No concessions.

387
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:56,867
No concessions. So it is
asked, so it is given.

388
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:58,002
Begin...

389
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,497
Why don't you fight
like a man?!

390
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,732
Because there is a woman
behind you.

391
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:37,468
Of course if you wish
to fight me like a man.

392
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,073
What are you doing?

393
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:44,208
HERCULES!??

394
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:47,712
Your fame will no doubt rise
if you defeat the

395
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:50,448
mighty Hercules by hand..
Unless of course you wish

396
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:52,349
to be nothing more
than a villain!

397
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:11,395
Stop delaying your own
death... I am better than you!

398
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,665
Your beliefs will aid
in your demise..

399
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:43,661
You are a spoiled child and an
impotent puppet.

400
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,473
What have you done?

401
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:03,514
Hera's poisons work well
huh... I guess I should know.

402
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,585
You will not beat me...

403
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:11,021
What happened?

404
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:14,091
Be careful. His sword
is poisoned.

405
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:16,126
How did you know?

406
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:21,766
Its not important. Excuse me.

407
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:32,409
We have just witnessed
the mighty Hercules without

408
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:36,681
his might fight to victory.
This will be a tale to be told

409
00:58:36,714 --> 00:58:38,415
for the ages.

410
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:58,468
I knew you would be
victorious.

411
00:58:58,502 --> 00:59:01,471
I couldn't have done it
without your counsel... Or

412
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:05,442
your friendship thank you. I
will not disrespect

413
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,443
either again.

414
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,780
I must go see Athena, then I
will return.

415
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:14,819
Please do. Pronax has an idea
For a games competition

416
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:16,821
to honor the Gods of
Olympus. He needs

417
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:18,288
help putting it together.

418
00:59:18,322 --> 00:59:20,457
Sounds like a fine idea. I
look forward to

419
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,959
participating in that.

420
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:49,920
I should have never doubted
your wisdom, Athena.

421
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:54,058
I am sorry for all that has
happened.

422
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,094
Do not be sorry. What
I learned was valuable

423
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:59,229
And even if my power
do not return,

424
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:00,831
I know I will be fine.

425
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:05,069
I do not believe Hera's
powers can keep you

426
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,238
from accomplishing
anything you set your mind to.

427
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:11,842
As long as I have counselors
Such as you and Abderus,

428
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:16,046
I Know there is nothing I
can't overcome, because I

429
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,016
could not have done
it without you both.

430
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:22,086
Now, with your approval, I
would like to stay and

431
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,789
continue the warrior training.
I feel like I have allot

432
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:29,059
to learn. And I hear
the others have devised

433
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:31,662
some sort of competition
for Olympus...

434
01:00:31,696 --> 01:00:35,532
Very good, Hercules. I'll tell
Pronax and the others.

435
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,292
Hercules recovered his
full powers by the end of

436
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:18,195
the training. Of course
Hera's treachery was not

437
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:20,464
sated, and the coming
years would bring Hercules

438
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:23,867
woe and strife to weigh
down the most powerful

439
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:27,837
of men. But that is a
story for another time.
