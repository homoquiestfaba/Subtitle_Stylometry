And, uh, he scored three goals.

1253

I got four days to get you in shape for the final.

<i>Everyone take notes.</i>

1255
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:10,651
Sweden has been shifting
from Pyramid

1256
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:12,887
5-3-2 to 3-2-2-3.

1257

And sometimes
to <i>metodo</i> 2-3-2-3.

1258
01:18:15,892 --> 01:18:17,792
We play straight 4-2-4.

1259
01:18:17,794 --> 01:18:21,328
But if we're gonna
beat these guys

1260
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:24,965
we're gonna have to shift
formation as they do.

1261
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:26,834
<i>And this is how</i>
<i>we're gonna do it.</i>

1262
01:18:26,836 --> 01:18:30,304
If they go to 5-3-2,
then we go to 3-4-3!

1266

There's nobody

1267

Vada! Vada!

1268
01:18:40,283 --> 01:18:43,484
Everybody is here
and nobody is here!

1269
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:45,619
- Never follow. Not ever.

1270
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:47,755
- <i>But, coach, isn't that</i>
<i>their shift to 3-4-3?</i>

1271
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:51,192
- <i>No. Skoglund sweeps to start</i>
<i>Sweden's counterattack.</i>

1272
01:18:51,194 --> 01:18:52,927
<i>Didi, sweep only.</i>

1273
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:57,031
What is that? I said 4-5-1!
Didi slide over!

1274

<i>You're running the 4-5-1!</i>

1275
01:19:00,103 --> 01:19:03,571
Garrincha, roll out! You gotta
be ready for that on the wing!

1276
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:05,172
- Coach?
- <i>What?</i>

1277
01:19:05,174 --> 01:19:07,441
- I don't understand how
I'm supposed to be on the wing

1278
01:19:07,443 --> 01:19:08,876
and covering Skoglund
at the same time.

1279
01:19:08,878 --> 01:19:10,511
- Because you --

1280
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:17,618
- <i>The Swedes have the edge over
Brazil in almost every regard.</i>

1281

<i>Experience, sophistication,</i>
<i>strategy and strength</i>

1282
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:21,689
<i>and even dirty play.</i>

1283
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:23,190
<i>Last week, we saw</i>
<i>West German captain</i>

1284

<i>Fritz Walter's illustrious</i>

1285

1290
01:19:35,071 --> 01:19:37,404

<i>an impressive hat-trick</i>

1291
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:39,540

1294

- No, no.
That's not possible.

1295
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:48,983
No. Our boys will eliminate him
from the equation.

1296
01:19:48,985 --> 01:19:51,552
- <i>Coach Feola,</i>
<i>Coach Raynor's offense</i>

outsmarted West Germany,
Hungary.

1298

We will come out strong,

1302

and Brazil will panic

1303
01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:04,765
just like they did in 1950.

1304

<i>They were undisciplined then</i>

But what do you expect?
They're abnormal.

1306
01:20:11,274 --> 01:20:13,174
- You're referring
to their mixed race?

1307
01:20:13,176 --> 01:20:16,043
- No. I mean they are literally
abnormal.

1308

01:24:23,959 --> 01:24:26,226
- <i>Didi! You got Pele long!</i>

1373
01:24:28,064 --> 01:24:30,931
- <i>Run, Pele!</i>
<i>Get there! Jump!</i>

1374
01:24:38,007 --> 01:24:39,039
- I can't swim!

1375
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,207
- I got you, Pele!

1376
01:24:44,713 --> 01:24:46,346
I got you.

1377
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:50,517
- <i>Grab my hand.</i>
<i>Here you go.</i>

1378
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:56,090
[Laughing]

1379
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:57,591
- We were so close!

1380
01:24:59,628 --> 01:25:02,596
[Indistinct chatter]

1381
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,898
[laughter]

1382
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,900
- Here he comes.

1383
01:25:06,902 --> 01:25:08,368
- You see?
That's how it's done.

1384
01:25:22,685 --> 01:25:26,687
- Tomorrow you will play
for the Jules Rimet trophy.

1385
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,363
And if you play the way
you played this last week

1386
01:25:36,365 --> 01:25:37,831
you will lose.

1387
01:25:46,675 --> 01:25:48,008
And it will be my fault.

1388
01:25:53,549 --> 01:25:58,152
The truth is that
shifting formations

1389
01:25:58,154 --> 01:26:00,053
may work miracles for Sweden

1390
01:26:00,055 --> 01:26:02,823
but it is not us.

1391
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:12,866
What I saw at the hotel today

1392
01:26:12,868 --> 01:26:14,134
that's how we play.

1393
01:26:17,573 --> 01:26:20,574
They say that we don't all play
the same. It's true.

1394
01:26:22,211 --> 01:26:25,345
We certainly don't all
look the same like they do.

1395
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,814
[Faint laughter]

1396
01:26:27,816 --> 01:26:29,249
But that's what makes us
who we are.

1397
01:26:31,153 --> 01:26:32,920
We have one thing in common.

1398
01:26:32,922 --> 01:26:33,954
The ginga.

1399
01:26:33,956 --> 01:26:36,623
The joy and expression
of Brazil.

1400
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:38,892
[Murmuring]

1401
01:26:38,894 --> 01:26:40,661
So when you take
the field tomorrow

1402
01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:47,834
forget everything that
I told you this last week.

1403
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:50,637
I don't want the world to see
a bunch of scared Brazilians

1404
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:51,872
trying to play like Sweden.

1405
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:55,309
I want them to see Brazil,
just as we are.

1406
01:27:02,484 --> 01:27:05,586
I don't know if we will win

1407
01:27:09,925 --> 01:27:12,926
but I do know

1408
01:27:12,928 --> 01:27:15,896
that we will show them
a beautiful game.

1409
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:25,339
What are you all
sitting around for?

1410
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:27,374
I did not say that
practice was canceled!

1411
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:28,508
[All cheering]

1412
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:32,179
- <i>Let's go, Brazil!</i>
<i>Alright.</i>

1413
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:34,948
- <i>After a night of heavy rains,</i>
<i>it's a brisk summer morning</i>

1414
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,750
<i>with clear skies</i>
<i>here in Stockholm.</i>

1415
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,318
<i>Fine weather for football</i>

1416
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:43,056
<i>as Sweden prepares to host</i>
<i>the 1958 World Cup final.</i>

1417
01:27:43,058 --> 01:27:45,158
<i>The Nordic Titans of Europe</i>
<i>will take on</i>

1418
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,195
<i>the less-experienced</i>
<i>but ever-flamboyant Brazil.</i>

1419
01:27:48,197 --> 01:27:49,730
<i>Two teams</i>
<i>with nothing in common</i>

1420
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:51,932
<i>other than, perhaps,</i>
<i>their yellow jerseys.</i>

1421
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:53,800
<i>But of course,</i>
<i>per the King's decree</i>

1422
01:27:53,802 --> 01:27:55,736
<i>Brazil will be forced</i>
<i>to wear blue today</i>

1423
01:27:55,738 --> 01:27:57,537
<i>against the heavily-favored</i>
<i>home nation.</i>

1424
01:27:57,539 --> 01:27:59,773
<i>How many goals</i>
<i>will Sweden win by?</i>

1425
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:00,874
<i>No one can say.</i>

1426
01:28:00,876 --> 01:28:02,175
<i>But everyone agrees</i>

1427
01:28:02,177 --> 01:28:04,177
<i>Brazil will need nothing</i>
<i>short of a miracle</i>

1428
01:28:04,179 --> 01:28:06,813
<i>to take home</i>
<i>the Jules Rimet trophy.</i>

1429
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:08,815
[Instrumental music]

1430
01:28:40,849 --> 01:28:43,116
<i>Over 50,000 already</i>
<i>in attendance</i>

1431
01:28:43,118 --> 01:28:45,619
<i>and millions more tuning in</i>
<i>from around the world</i>

1432
01:28:45,621 --> 01:28:47,788
<i>for the biggest</i>
<i>sporting event on earth.</i>

1433
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:49,022
<i>No team from outside Europe</i>

1434
01:28:49,024 --> 01:28:51,625
<i>has ever won the cup</i>
<i>on European soil.</i>

1435
01:28:51,627 --> 01:28:54,294
<i>But that doesn't stop the rest</i>
<i>of the world from watching</i>

1436
01:28:54,296 --> 01:28:57,464
<i>and hoping that one day</i>
<i>that may change.</i>

1437
01:28:57,466 --> 01:29:00,100
<i>There's the King of Sweden,</i>
<i>Gustav VI Adolf</i>

1438
01:29:00,102 --> 01:29:02,135
<i>with Queen Mountbatten</i>
<i>arriving in their box.</i>

1439
01:29:02,137 --> 01:29:04,504
<i>And now the entrance</i>
<i>of our host, Team Sweden.</i>

1440
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:06,106
<i>British-born manager,</i>
<i>George Raynor,</i>

1441
01:29:06,108 --> 01:29:07,708
<i>pulled players</i>
<i>from not just Sweden</i>

1442
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,176
<i>but other European countries.</i>

1443
01:29:09,178 --> 01:29:11,211
<i>A bit of a European</i>
<i>all-star team, really.</i>

1444
01:29:11,213 --> 01:29:14,181
<i>And on the other side</i>
<i>Coach Feola and Team Brazil.</i>

1445
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:16,383
<i>And there's our young star</i>
<i>Nascimento</i>

1446
01:29:16,385 --> 01:29:19,086
<i>now being called "Pele"</i>
<i>by his teammates.</i>

1447
01:29:19,088 --> 01:29:21,655
- <i>Fofinho, it's Pele!</i>

1448
01:29:21,657 --> 01:29:23,090
- <i>But make no mistake.</i>

1449
01:29:23,092 --> 01:29:24,891
<i>Brazil will need</i>
<i>the rest of the team</i>

1450
01:29:24,893 --> 01:29:27,494
<i>to step up today against</i>
<i>the indomitable Swedes.</i>

1451
01:29:27,496 --> 01:29:30,197
<i>The entire nation</i>
<i>has shut down for the day</i>

1452
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:33,033
<i>as every Brazilian</i>
<i>from every walk of life</i>

1453
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:34,968
<i>comes together to watch</i>
<i>the big game.</i>

[Whistle blows]

1455
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:12,406
- <i>And there's</i>
<i>the starting whistle.</i>

1456
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:15,108
<i>It's Zagallo to Vava,</i>
<i>Vava to the young Nascimento</i>

1457
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:17,644
<i>back to Nilton Santos,</i>
<i>and Parling lays into him.</i>

1458
01:30:17,646 --> 01:30:20,280
<i>Watch out! Oh my.</i>
<i>No card there.</i>

1459
01:30:20,282 --> 01:30:21,848
<i>So either the referee</i>
<i>missed that one</i>

1460
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:23,483
<i>or he's going to let</i>
<i>Parling play rough.</i>

1461
01:30:23,485 --> 01:30:24,818
<i>Garrincha looking</i>
<i>for Nascimento</i>

1462
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:25,952
<i>but he's marked</i>
<i>by three yellow shirts.</i>

1463
01:30:25,954 --> 01:30:27,287
<i>Garrincha passes to Zito.</i>

1464
01:30:27,289 --> 01:30:28,855
<i>Stolen away by Skoglund!</i>

1465
01:30:28,857 --> 01:30:30,223
<i>Sweden' first possession.</i>

1466
01:30:30,225 --> 01:30:31,558

<i>calls for the shift!</i>

01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,627
<i>Here we go, the Swedes</i>
<i>moving quickly down field.</i>

1468
01:30:33,629 --> 01:30:35,762

<i>a quick touch over to Hamrin</i>

1469
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:38,231
<i>Hamrin back to Liedholm and now</i>
<i>Hamrin breaks down the right wing.</i>

1470
01:30:38,233 --> 01:30:40,500
<i>Liedholm sends it to Parling,</i>
<i>Parling punches a swift pass</i>

1471
01:30:40,502 --> 01:30:42,035
<i>through Brazil's back bone</i>
<i>and into the area.</i>

1472
01:30:42,037 --> 01:30:44,137
<i>Simonsson down the middle,</i>
<i>Hamlin with a cross hitch.</i>

1473
01:30:44,139 --> 01:30:45,772
<i>Simonsson, just wide!</i>

1474
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:48,475
<i>A brilliant attack</i>
<i>from the Nordic Titans!</i>

1475
01:30:48,477 --> 01:30:50,644
- <i>And Sweden's applying</i>
<i>pressure early on.</i>

1476
01:30:50,646 --> 01:30:52,479
<i>Gilmar will take</i>
<i>the goal kick.</i>

1477
01:30:52,481 --> 01:30:55,081
<i>Trapped by Nascimento and now</i>
<i>finally with an opportunity.</i>

1478
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:56,783
<i>And here he goes,</i>
<i>spinning his way</i>

1479
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:58,452
<i>through Liedholm and Axbom.</i>

1480
01:30:58,454 --> 01:30:59,553
- Now's the time, <i>meu filho.</i>

1481

- <i>And Pele is back</i>
<i>the other way.</i>

<i>Nascimento trying</i>
<i>to do it all on his own!</i>

<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

1484
01:31:04,426 --> 01:31:06,827
<i>A huge jolt from Parling.</i>

1485
01:31:06,829 --> 01:31:10,397
- <i>Sweden removing Pele from
the equation just as promised.</i>

1486
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:12,899
<i>They are determined</i>
<i>to stop his one-man show.</i>
