or somebody just in case
he's a total whack job, okay?

180
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:40,438
She's working all
day, but I'll call her.

181
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:42,005
Look, I gotta go.

182
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:46,183
Okay, kick some ass, okay,
and call me afterwards.

183
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:48,316
Just so I know that
everything's okay, all right?

188
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:07,770
Um, I'm outside, I think,

189
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,381
but I'm not sure this
is your building.

190
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:14,516
I, um, uh,
it doesn't look like--

191
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,647
Isobel.

192
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,432
Hey, I was just
leaving you a message.

193
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,651
Aw, sorry about that.

194
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:20,914
Is this where you live?

195
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:23,786
We have a lot of
creatives who work here,

196
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,571
photographers, internet
startups, writers.

197
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:28,399
I've been here five years now,

198
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:33,796
um, uh, my neighbor,
builds websites.

199
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,190
-Nice guy.
-[dog barks]

200
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:37,408
I don't know what to say.

201
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:39,106
You know, I might,
I'm just gonna go home.

202
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:42,805
Okay, uh, hold on
one second, one second.

203
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:47,592
[phone beeps, rings]

204
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:51,074
Chloe, can you come out front?

205
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:55,644
Uh, oh, oh, no, no, no,
carry on, my assistant.

206
00:12:55,687 --> 00:13:01,476
Uh, yeah, it's just she's, she's
kinda having second thoughts.

207
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,566
-Okay, okay.
-[beeps]

208
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:06,002
Look, I know how this looks,

209
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:09,527
but maybe you could call
somebody and have 'em come over.

210
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:12,182
Well, um, my boyfriend
knows where I am.

211
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:13,836
-Great.
-And he said he might even

212
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,143
-stop by, though.
-Okay, great, cool, yeah.

213
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:20,930
-Uh.
-How long is it gonna be?

214
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:23,411
Oh, you'll be outta
here in 15 minutes.

215
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:29,112
Um, what are the shots for?

216
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:32,463
Caribbean Waterways, it's
the biggest cruise line

217
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:33,987
in the tourism industry.

218
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:36,424
Maybe you've heard of them?

219
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:38,992
-No.
-No?

220
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,820
Well, they're huge.

221
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:41,951
Hence the money.

222
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:45,476
-Um.

I don't mean to make
you uncomfortable. Uh...

225
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:54,921
okay, [stammering] if you
don't want to, it's cool.

226
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:58,011
I mean, I'm here
now, I feel kind of--

227
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:00,143
No, no, no, no,
please, come in.

228
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,798
You're more than welcome,
Chloe's upstairs.

-Shall we?
-Chloe, Chloe?

230
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:06,976
Yeah, yeah, she's

Hey, I'm Chloe,
you must be Isobel.

237
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:47,016
-Yeah.
-So nice to meet you.

238
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,105
Wow, she's gorgeous.
[laughs]

239
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,585
You can see her in
the pictures, right?

240
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:53,370
-Totally.
-I feel really weird now.

241
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:55,503
No, no, no, no, no. No, I--
look, I totally get it.

242
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:58,506
Seriously, you're being
really smart about this.

243
00:14:58,549 --> 00:14:59,899
Thank you.

244
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,988
Why don't you
guys come inside?

245
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:03,250
After you.

246
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,818
So, how long have
you been modeling?

247
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:09,038
Oh, I'm not, I--
I teach Pilates.

248
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:10,997
Oh, do you have
your own studio, or?

249
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,650
No, I wish.

250
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:14,043
Someday, hopefully.

251
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,698
You never know, this
might open up opportunities.

252
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:17,264
Oh.

253
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,267
So, um, we have
water, we have fruit,

254
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,357
we have a betta fish
in the back. [laughs]

255
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,794
Um, anything you need,
I'm your man, okay?

256
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:27,491
Let's, let's
put some music on,

257
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:29,580
keep things nice
and relaxed, okay?

258
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:32,279
-Yeah, something sexy.

00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,760
Are you sure there's
nothing I can do for you?

261
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:36,979
You know, do you
have a bathroom?

262
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:38,415
I just need a bathroom.

263
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,027
Yeah, we have a bathroom,
it's just through there.

Thank you.

you need anything.

ISOBEL: Thank you.

268
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:58,653
Oh, what am I doing?

269
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:05,921
Okay.

270
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,792
Um, okay, why don't you
come and stand on the X here

271
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:09,011
so we can get a good frame.

272
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:11,448
-Great.
-And uh, let me take her bag.

Very natural, good, beautiful.

276
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:19,848
Over here.

277

Mm, I have no
idea what I'm doing.

278
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:24,461
No, no, no, no, you're doing
great, put your hands down.

279
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:26,463
Oh yeah, let's
lose the jacket.

280
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:27,551
Okay, um, mm.

281
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,641
You have a really
great skin tone.

282
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:33,035
-[laughing]
-And a great smile.

283

[laughing]

284
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:35,037
You want a 50?

285
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:36,647
Um, no, I'm good.

286
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:41,130
Okay, now, imagine you're on
the top deck of a cruise liner,

287
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:44,351
Caribbean Waterways, and
you're surrounded by water.

288
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:48,790
You feel free, you
feel excited, okay?

Great, relax, relax.

291
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:54,361
This feels really weird.
[laughs]

292
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:57,407
Look right, right
here, just off camera.

293
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,452
Can we lose the jacket?

294
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:00,236
Yeah, let's lose the jacket.

295
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,933
-Uh, this one?
-Yeah, yeah.

296
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:03,152
Oh. [chuckles]

297
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:06,286
Where's the last
scenic place you visited?

298
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,070
-Grand Canyon.
-What, where?

299
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:09,463
-ISOBEL: Grand Canyon.
-Good.

300
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:13,510
Okay. Now, imagine you're
there, right now, okay?

301
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,251
All right, you look lovely.

302
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:17,732
Great hair, one more, good.

303
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,170
Wow, gorgeous.

304
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:24,130
Goodbye Pilates, welcome
to your new career.

305
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,741
[laughing]

306
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,005
Thank you, Isobel.

307
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,441
I will let you know

308
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:33,922
when the client has a
cardiac over your pictures.

309
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:35,924
[laughs]
You're funny.

310
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,926
Well, whatever happens, it was
really nice to meet you both.

311
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:41,364
Yes, nice to meet you, too,
thank you so much again.

312
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:42,583

CHLOE:
Isobel, congratulations,

316
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,350
it's Chloe from the
photo shoot.

317
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:12,091
Peter was right, the
clients booked you.

318
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,527
If you wanna do the shoot,

319
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,311
we start tomorrow
at noon, same place.

320
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:17,270
Uh, please call this
number to confirm.

321
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:34,722
I am so sorry.

322
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:37,942
[sighs]

323
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:43,165
The reservation.

324
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,688
All taken care of.

325
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:47,430
I changed it until tomorrow.

326
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:49,824
And Luigi's on the way.

327
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,434
Your finest pepperoni,

328
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:55,438
that disgusting cheese
crust that you like.

329
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:58,354
-You're awesome.
-[laughing]

330
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:01,488
Now, what do you think?

331
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:07,058
I think that all you
need is a halo.

332
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:08,059
[laughing]

333
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:09,060
Come on.

334
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:11,150
What was he like, then?

335
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,064
He was, he was
actually really cool.

336
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,283
-Yeah?
-He was, yeah,

337
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:15,502
very professional,
there was an assistant,

338
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:18,200
and she was very very
nice and helpful,

339
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:21,290
and yeah, it was kinda fun.

340
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,466
And did you see any
of the pictures he took?

341
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,166
Yeah, I saw them, and I was
surprised, they were good.

342
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,603
I mean, I had no idea
what I was doing.

343
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:32,040
Babe, sometimes you
just gotta go for it.

344
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,737
Oh, I don't know,
I don't know if,

345
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:35,348
I mean, I have no
idea what I'm doing.

346
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:37,611
And I'll have to rearrange
the whole studio tomorrow,

347
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:39,961
and your mom would have to
take care of Olivia all day,

348
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:41,528
I just don't know.

349
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:46,054
Well, she's a 60-year-old
divorced woman with a blind dog,

350
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:48,099

I gotta be thin tomorrow.

You have to count to 10.

Why do angels need glitter?

371
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:07,004
Well, I guess they
need it to light our way,

372
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:10,225
'cause when they walk around,
the glitter falls off,

373

where they went.

Should we get a new one?

00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:34,213
Motherhood can be such a gift.

00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:47,400
I'm just a mom.

538
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,098
I don't do this kind of thing.

539
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:53,362
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

PETER: That fish, it's
called a betta fish.

542
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:00,369
He's happy on his own.

543
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:03,372
In fact, you try
and add someone,

544
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:07,724
turns him into a fighter,
maybe even a killer.

545
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:13,295
Now, they've been known
to tolerate tank mates,

546
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:15,384
but if they can't be friends,

547
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:22,000
the situation turns nasty fast.

548
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:25,177
And without any plants or rocks,

549
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:27,701
that means there's
nowhere to hide.

550
00:33:28,745 --> 00:33:33,446
The only hope for survival
for any new addition

551
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:38,233
is to keep its head down
and do whatever it can

552
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:44,370
to make sure that the
betta remains content.

553
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:47,068

Are you gonna kill me?

Are you gonna kill me?

558
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,999
No, I would never kill you.

559
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:07,306
You're far too beautiful.

00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:11,049
We're just gonna
take some pictures.

That's it, just like before.

Then what, you
gonna let me go home?

No, I'm not gonna clean up,

717
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:31,952
It's the same reason
that you came here for

718
00:48:31,996 --> 00:48:33,171
in the first place.

719
00:48:33,214 --> 00:48:35,521
If it's just money,
I'll get you money.

720
00:48:35,564 --> 00:48:38,132
I'll get a loan,
I'll ask my friends,

721
00:48:38,176 --> 00:48:40,221
I'll get you money,
I'll get you money.

I've been down that road.

723
00:48:42,354 --> 00:48:45,270
It's cleaner this way, trust me.

724
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,578
I'll make you agree,

725
00:48:49,622 --> 00:48:52,494
you can't, you can't
treat me like this.

726
00:48:58,457 --> 00:48:59,284
Okay.

727
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:03,853

Get that.

Yeah, good, there
you go, good girl.

So...

741
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,139
I've changed it this time,

742
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:15,229
but I'd like you to
get used to changing it

743
00:50:15,273 --> 00:50:18,406
every three or four clients.

744
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:22,323

be safe and clean.

745
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:24,760
I'm pregnant.

Of course you are.

They always say this.

748
00:50:34,205 --> 00:50:36,903
No, I really am pregnant.

Really?

750
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:41,647
If it's about the milk,
take these.

751
00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:44,389
Those'll help relax you.

My boyfriend dropped
me off yesterday,

753
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:51,831
so he knows where the studio is.

754
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,707
It's a good thing you
didn't bring him in.

755
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:02,276
What would you've
done if I did?

756
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:05,540
Taken a few shots and then...

757
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:09,370

What was what?

902

You know, they're kinda
thin walls. I think--

903
01:03:34,245 --> 01:03:36,029
I think somebody's doing
something upstairs.

904
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:37,901
So maybe you wanna
check up there.

905

Do you like your new home?

921

I'm the building
manager, Isobel.

922

Nobody knows this
place better than I do.

923
01:05:01,723 --> 01:05:05,510
I can get onto any floor
or into any apartment

924

925
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:12,386
I'm sorry you had to
spend the night in there,

it's just that, I thought
we had an understanding.

PETER: According to your profile page,

943
01:06:34,512 --> 01:06:38,342

So.

You met my daughter.

I have her on weekends.

948

01:07:51,763 --> 01:07:52,981
kids are resilient.

955
01:07:53,982 --> 01:07:55,593
She won't even remember this.

956
01:07:57,682 --> 01:07:59,292
Yes, she will.

957
01:07:59,336 --> 01:08:01,207
She'll never forget it.

958
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:02,948
PETER: She'll forgive you.

959
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:03,992
You're a good mom.

960
01:08:04,906 --> 01:08:05,951
You know,

961
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,563
no one ever got out before.

962
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:13,915
You're smart.

963
01:08:16,222 --> 01:08:17,310
I like you.

964
01:08:19,051 --> 01:08:20,966

[chuckles]

966
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,454
I told you, I know everything.

967
01:08:31,629 --> 01:08:34,501
I know where you
went to high school,

968
01:08:34,545 --> 01:08:36,286
when you had your last vacation,

969
01:08:37,156 --> 01:08:38,940
I have your Pilates schedule.

970
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:43,467
Everything in your phone
is in my computer, so...

971
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:49,037
it really does not matter
that you know where I live

972
01:08:49,081 --> 01:08:52,519
or that my real name's Patrick.

973
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:58,308
Because the people I work with,

974
01:08:59,613 --> 01:09:04,009
they also have your
information, you understand?

975
01:09:04,052 --> 01:09:09,928
It's what we call insurance,
for when I let you go.

Olivia's school, right?

978
01:09:23,942 --> 01:09:28,773
You don't want her next play
date to be with me, do you?

979
01:09:32,037 --> 01:09:33,821
Can I trust you, Isobel?

980
01:09:37,782 --> 01:09:40,350
You stay away
from my daughter.

981
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,575
Do we have a deal?

I, I have AIDS.

986

Don't worry.
I have AIDS, too.

Don't be selfish, Isobel.

You need some rest.

I need one to come here

Then you can go home, you
can be with your family.

Why should I believe you?

1065
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:53,511
Because I don't wanna
have to cut you down
