200
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,140
to read about your wife.

>> Sergeant Gregory?

203
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,070
I thought you were still

204
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,100
on the island.

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,120
>> I've been here for

206
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,170
quite a while, actually.

207
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,200
I suppose somebody upstairs

208
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,090
thought it was best.

209
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,210
>> And you remembered

>> Being a prison censor

212
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,100
does that to you.

213
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,140
I've read so many of your

214
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,140
letters, I've started feeling

215
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,200
like family after a while.

216
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,040
>> I'll always be grateful

217
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,140
to you for showing me

Other warders were

221
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,230
never so gracious.

223
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,010
to bother you.

Just wanted to let you know

that I was around and...

226
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,220
Say hello.

We--all of US--the world--

Ignore them.

increase the number of

informants in the townships.

253
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,020
All we have to do

254
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,010
is find the ringleaders.

255
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,020

257
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,020
Just do what's necessary.

all these problems might be

265
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,040
to talk to mandela, sir.

with terrorists?

you were sitting around the

I'm no reformist.

no agenda, f.W.

335
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
People on both sides

336
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,230
will listen to you.

337
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,160
At least give it some thought.

We can't afford another split

in the party, kobie.

343
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,020
It would mean the end.

344
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,090
You want a Messiah,

345
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,120

about these white civilians?

349
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,150
You know that the armed

350
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,180
struggle can't discriminate

351
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,220
between military targets

352
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,080
and soft targets.

353
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,220
>> Soft targets?

354
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,180
You mean women and children.

355

time for this to happen

365
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,040
to mandela.

It's of no consequence.

368
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,100
An enlarged prostate gland.

369
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,230
Gus gecelter did the diagnosis.

370
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,150
He's a jewboy, but they tell me

371
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,080
not a bad urologist.

372
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,140
He says he has to remove

373
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,230
part of the gland straightaway.

374

inconveniences.

382
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,130
They cannot last.

383
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,220
We must be steadfast,

He is older than both of US,

00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,230
Mr. President.

389
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,030
If he should die, he would--

390
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,020
>> it would be a Thorn

391
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,140
plucked from our flesh.

392
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,060
>> He would be a martyr.

393
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,180
His name would be a rallying

394
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,160
cry for our enemies here

395
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,140
and around the world.

396
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,140
>> You attach too much

397
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,160
importance to the man.

398
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,140
>> Mr. President...

399
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,220
Now is the time to sit down

400
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,050
with mandela.

401
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,010
>> Listen! I am the president

402
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,150
of this nation.

403
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,050
And mandela--

404
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,120
he is a terrorist.

405
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,150
Ah, he might be educated.

406
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,010
He might be a tribal

407
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,090
princeling.

408
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,190
But he has been found guilty

409
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,100
of treason against the state.

410
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,190
And you say I must sit down

411
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,090
and exchange pleasantries

412
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,030
with this man?

413
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,170
>> The presidency need not

414
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,130
become directly involved, sir.

415
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,020
The entire matter can be

416
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,090
handled quietly and discreetly.

417
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,100
>> Well, tell me how.

418
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,220
>> Mr. Mandela?

419
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,080
>> Mr. Coetsee?

420
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,050
>> No, no, no, please don't.

421
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,060
Don't bother,

422
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,030
not on my account.

423
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,010
>> I am...

424
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,030
Very seldom rendered

425
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,040
speechless, but...

426
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,200
I must confess I hardly

427
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,070
expected a visit

428
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,200
from the minister of justice.

429
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,000
To what do I owe the honor,

430
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,130
minister coetsee?

431
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,210
>> Oh, well, it's not really

432
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,110
a visit, you know.

433
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,110
It's just that I was

434
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,020
in the vicinity.

435
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,010
>> You were...

436
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,020
In the vicinity?

437
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,180
>> A friend of mine

438
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,230
down the corridor.

439
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,200
I trust you are recovering.

440
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,040
>> Oh.

441
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,000
I trust so, too.

442
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,180
>> Well, if there's anything

443
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,170
you need...

444
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,170
>> My needs are few,

445
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,020
minister coetsee,

446
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,190
and simple.

447
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,050
But chief among them is

448
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,100
the need for more information.

449
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,090
>> Yeah, well, that's

450
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,070
a difficult one, you know?

451
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,230
>> I understand.

452
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,050
>> Yes, I think you do.

453
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,200
Excuse me, Mr. Mandela.

454
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,100
I must go.

455
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,080
>> Your friend calls?

456
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,210
>> We'll meet again.

457
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,090
( Whistle blowing )

458
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,180
>> But, madiba, where are

459
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,060
they taking you?

460
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,100
>> They're giving me a little

461
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,150
peace from you fellows--

462
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,180
my own cell.

463
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,030
>> They're planning to isolate

464
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,090
you from your comrades.

465
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,220
>> Madiba, what are they up to?

466
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,080
They have a plan.

467
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,180
They must have a plan.

468
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,220
They never do anything

469
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,090
without a reason.

470
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,110
>> If they have a plan,

471
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,160
do you think they would

472
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,030
confide in me?

473
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,110
All they told me is that

474
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,020
I was being moved.

475
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,220
>> They gave you no hint?

476
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,060
No clue, madiba?

477
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,110
>> None.

478
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,020
>> And you have no suspicion?

479
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,030
>> If they hope that by

480
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,120
isolating me, they will

481
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,050
further their ambitions,

482
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,050
then they are mistaken.

483
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,040
>> I've been ordered to

484
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,020
Cape Town on government

485
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,010
business.

486
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,100
Would you like to make

487
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,030
the trip with me?

488
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,110
>> I don't think that's

489
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,130
a very funny joke, sergeant.

490
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,080
>> I'm not joking.

491
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,150
Orders...from on high.

492
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,140
♪♪

493
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,220
So...what do you think?

494
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,050
>> I had forgotten everything

495
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,080
but the details.

496
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,130
>> Would you like a cool drink?

497
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,190
Something to eat maybe?

498
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,210
>> Do you think my body

499
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,060
would stand it, sergeant?

500
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,160
>> ( Laughs )

501
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,190
I'll be back in a minute.

>> ( Speaking afrikaans )

503
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,170
>> Here you go.

504
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,210
Haven't had one of those

505
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,020
in a long time, eh?

506
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,120
>> Yes.

507
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,190
Long time.

508
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,050
Long time.

509
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,140
>> This is not

510
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,130
the visiting room.

511
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,140
What is going on?

512
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,140
>> It's all right,

513
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,120
Mrs. Mandela.

514
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,010
Please sit down.

515
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,020
Please?

516
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,190
>> Mr. Mandela, I'll call you

517
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,140
when your time is up.

518
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,190
>> Are you leaving US alone,

519
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,050
sergeant?

520
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,100
>> Government orders.

521
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,020
>> Ohh.

522
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,010
I can't believe it.

523
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,110
It's been 20 years.

524
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,030
20 years since I've held you

525
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,120
like this.

526
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
>> What is this game

527
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,110
they play now?

528
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,140
Where is the bug?

529
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,220
>> Nothing we could say

530
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,200
would surprise them.

531
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,050
For years, they have known

532
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,220
full well what we think.

533
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,170
>> ( Laughs ) Yes.

534
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,050
>> They took me on--

535
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,140
I suppose it was a picnic--

536
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,040
in Cape Town.

537
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,040
>> A what?

538
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,090
>> A ride into town.

539
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,090
I think they want me to get

540
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,170
acquainted with life

541
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,090
out there.

542
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,160
>> Oh, I think they want

543
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,190
to seduce you.

544
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,120
>> It's working.

545
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,110
>> ( Laughs )

546
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,050
>> I believe they are signaling

547
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,060
that they are ready to talk.

548
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,100
>> Oh, madiba.

549
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,210
Don't trust them.

550
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,010
>> It is a dangerous path.

551
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,180
But I must tread it.

552
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,220
Hello, Mrs. Gregory.

553
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,060
I am Nelson Mandela.

554
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,160
Thank you for inviting me

555
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,200
into your home.

556
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,060
>> Won't you...Come in,

557
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,020
Mr. Mandela?

558
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,050
( Laughter )

559
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,140
You have such a wicked

560
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,050
sense of humor, Mr. Mandela.

561
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,130
>> And you cook an excellent

562
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,030
meal, Mrs. Gregory.

563
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,110
>> Thank you.

564
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,180
>> No wonder your husband

565
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,200
reports for work

566
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,000
in such a good mood.

567
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,090
>> ( Laughs )

568
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,230
>> Can I talk now?

569
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,070
>> Hey.

570
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,030
>> What is it, young man?

571
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,070
>> Is it really true

572
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,140
you're a prince?

573
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,010
>> Yes, it is true.

574
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,040
>> I'll bet you had lots of

575
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
servants waiting on you

576
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,050
hand and foot.

577
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,140
>> Well, it wasn't quite

578
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,150
that way for me.

579
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,210
>> My father makes me

580
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,110
do chores...When I want to go

581
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,140
out and play with my friends.

582
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,180
>> Oh, my goodness.

583
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,210
>> Well, we all have

584
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,140
our chores around the house.

585
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,230
Even parents.

586
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,110
Even princes.

587
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,060
>> You had to do chores?

588
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,120
>> Of course.

589
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,070
When I was a little boy--

590
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,200
just about your age--

591
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,210
my mother sent me to the home

592
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,040
of my uncle, who was the king.

593
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,050
My father had just died,

594
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,230
and his brother the king

595
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,040
followed the custom

596
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,040
of our people and took me in.

597
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,120
Once, in the house of the king,

598
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,080
I had to go through rigorous

599
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,030
training to one day become

600
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,020
an adviser to my uncle,

601
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,120
and later to my cousin,

602
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,000
who would one day himself

603
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,010
become king.

604
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,030
>> You must've felt like the

605
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,060
luckiest boy in the whole

606
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,150
wide world.

607
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,160
>> Yes. Going to school,

608
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,030
being taught the ways

609
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,020
of the court, yes.

610
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,230
But my other duty was a big job

611
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,150
for a little person.

612
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,180
I had to iron the pants of

613
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:34,020
my uncle for each state visit

614
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,080
and ceremonial occasion.

615
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,220
Those pants had to be perfectly

616
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,180
ironed and pressed each time.

617
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,050
If they were not, I had to go

618
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,170
over and over and over them

619
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,060
until they were right.

620
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,080
>> But you were the prince.

621
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,110
Couldn't you get the servant

622
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,160
to do that for you?

623
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,050
>> No.

624
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,140
Because ironing my uncle's

625
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,040
pants was my duty,

626
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,030
and I stuck to it.

627
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,230
That is what one does when

628
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,130
one is given a responsibility

629
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,090
and a trust.

630
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:11,000
Ironing those pants taught me

631
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
to be patient.

632
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,210
And it taught me to focus

633
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,030
myself on a single task.

634
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,060
So, what do you think

635
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,190
about that?

636
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,230
>> Well...

637
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,060
I think I understand.

638
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,010
>> Good.

639
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,130
Dear minister coetsee,

640
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,100
there can be no doubt

641
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,120
in your mind that the

642
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,060
situation in our country

643
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,080
has become untenable.

644
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,200
( People shouting )

645
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,030
Strikes, agitation

646
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,230
in the streets,

647
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,190
and armed resistance

648
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,060
have not abated despite your

649
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,180
best efforts.

650
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,060
The black people of our

651
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,000
country are harboring

652
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,220
a great grievance.

653
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,040
As an executive member

654
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,020
of the a.N.C., and as

655
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,190
a patriot who loves

656
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,110
his country, I implore

657
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,090
the government to sit down

658
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,220
with members of our movement

659
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,010
and face-to-face discuss ways

660
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,140
in which we can bring an end

661
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,080
to the terrible torment and

662
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,000
suffering in South Africa.

663
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,030
>> Just give this back

664
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,200
to coetsee.

665
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,020
So, tell me--do you think

666
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,070
mandela grows desperate?

667
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,110
>> I think mandela...

668
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,000
Grows, Mr. President.

669
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,030
>> Hmm! And I say

670
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,120
mandela grows old.

671
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,120
He senses god beckoning.

672
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,020
He's running out of time,

673
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,080
and that suits US very well

674
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,220
indeed.

675
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,120
>> Mr. Mandela.

676
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,190
It's a pleasure.

677
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,010
Johann kykendal,

678
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,020
aide to the president.

679
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,150
Step inside.

680
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,060
>> The point is, Mr. Kykendal,

681
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,150
the time has come

682
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,090
for negotiations.

683
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,070
What is it that is stopping

684
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,160
your government from

685
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,060
sitting down and talking to US?

686
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,010
>> But surely, Mr. Mandela,

687
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,110
that is what we are doing,

688
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,090
isn't it?

689
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,130
>> You are a civil servant,

690
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,030
Mr. Kykendal, no more.

691
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,010
And I am not authorized

692
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:35,050
to negotiate for the a.N.C.

693
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,190
Your government must go to

694
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,150
Lusaka, or they will have to

695
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,160
invite Lusaka here.

696
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,000
>> P.w. Botha going to Lusaka?

697
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,110
Speaking to tambo?

698
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,230
( Laughs ) That's impossible...

699
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,210
And you know it.

700
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,000
>> I do not think

701
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,160
you appreciate the dynamics

702
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,050
of this meeting, Mr. Kykendal.

703
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,210
I am an executive member

704
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,080
of the a.N.C., and you are

705
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,150
a conduit.

706
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,040
It is not your place to

707
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,110
tell me what is possible

708
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,030
or not possible.

709
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,070
>> Mr. Mandela, i--

710
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,230
>> you...

711
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,020
Will understand clearly

712
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,020
three things and communicate

713
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,150
them to your masters.

714
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,140
>> I don't think you

715
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,140
appreciate where i'm--

716
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,160
>> one--

717
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,070
I am not the head of

718
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:37,220
the a.N.C., nor am I,

719
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,020
in the current instance,

720
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,050
its emissary.

721
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,130
I do what I do knowing

722
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,150
full well the risks I run

723
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,120
of being repudiated.

724
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,040
Two--we can only continue

725
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,080
this dialogue if your

726
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,170
government demonstrates

727
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,130
its willingness to take a few

728
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,230
risks of its own.

729
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,060
The road to peace is

730
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,010
precipitous, and if we are to

731
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,130
travel it together, we must

732
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,070
all share the risks involved.

733
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,220
Three--i believe that this is

734
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,180
your government's last chance

735
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,080
for a peaceful settlement

736
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,150
before...the armed struggle

737
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:20,160
reaches a point of no return.

738
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,020
Ignore it, and I believe

739
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,180
our country will be laid waste

740
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,180
in a war of attrition

741
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,020
from which no Victor

742
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,140
will emerge.

743
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,010
>> Mr. Mandela,

744
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,080
I can assure you that--

745
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,200
>> tell them.

746
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,070
>> Madiba.

747
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,060
>> Madiba.

748
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,160
>> Comrades, I wanted you

749
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,040
to know that my isolation has

750
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,150
afforded me a certain clarity.

751
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,200
>> I'm glad that you derived

752
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,060
some benefit from it,

753
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
because we haven't.

754
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,170
>> Certain developments

755
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,230
have taken place

756
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:17,030
that I must report to you.

757
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,220
>> From your isolation cell?

758
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,100
>> I wasn't always isolated.

759
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,230
>> I knew it.

760
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,020
>> Who did you see? Botha?

761
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,010
>> Coetsee.

762
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,100
>> Coetsee.

763
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,130
>> And a number of others.

764
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,200
>> You have not informed tambo

765
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,070
and the central committee?

766
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,010
>> You've gone too far, Nelson.

767
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,070
These meetings of yours

768
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,070
with this government have

769
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,140
compromised the a.N.C.

770
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,000
>> It was an opportunity,

771
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,060
and I grasped it.

772
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,170
>> Yes, but whose opportunity--

773
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,030
yours or the regime's?

774
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,060
Nelson, do you know what they

775
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,020
could do with this?

776
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,150
Every meeting you've held,

777
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,160
every contact could be turned

778
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,010
to their own benefit.

779
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,080
>> Imagine the headlines--

780
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,100
"mandela in talks

781
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,120
with government."

782
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,120
It would be a propaganda coup,

783
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,000
and at the very most, it would

784
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
split US down the middle.

785
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,040
>> I am not a child, Andrew.

786
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,200
These thoughts have obviously

787
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,220
occurred to me.

788
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,130
>> Ah, madiba, you're treading

789
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,220
on dangerous ground here.

790
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,120
>> Since when has the a.N.C.

791
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,060
Flinched from danger?

792
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,190
I speak with the regime

793
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,020
to enhance the aims

794
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,210
of our organization.

795
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,060
>> Yeah, but in secret--

796
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,110
that's the problem, madiba.

797
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,150
>> Shh, shh.

798
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,070
( Prisoners chanting,

799
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,180
whistle blowing )

800
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,170
>> I risk my reputation

801
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,160
on my strong belief that

802
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,140
the regime speaks from

803
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,120
a position of weakness.

804
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,210
We have got them on the ropes.

805
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:55,120
Now, do we fight for

806
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,020
another decade?

807
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,170
Do we spill the blood of

808
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,000
thousands more of our children

809
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,160
to achieve what can easily be

810
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,070
accomplished across a table?

811
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,070
I'll be letting tambo know

812
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,190
what I have done, and I will

813
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,130
seek his endorsement.

814
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,070
But until then, I want you

815
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,190
to know that I intend to

816
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,060
continue on this path.

Who is it who abolished

petty apartheid?

831
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,000
P.w. Botha, that's who.

832
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,060
Who drove the Cubans back

833

in Angola?

834
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,210
My army did.

835
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,210
Who fought the communists

836
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,170
in Mozambique? I did.

837
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,210
And what recognition

838
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,130
does the west give me?

839
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,080
They nag, they whinge,

840
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,090
they send me diplomatic

842
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,010
"Negotiate," they say.

843
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,100
And who must I negotiate with?

844
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,180
A bunch of blacks running amok

845
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,190
in the townships?

846
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,000
A bunch of terrorists sitting

847
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,090
in jail where they belong?

848
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,100
Look at this.

849
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,100
France, Germany, Japan--

850
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,160
they're all against me.

851
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,200
I'm telling you, gentlemen--

852
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,220
if it wasn't for Margaret

853
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,170
Thatcher and Ronald Reagan,

854
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,230
South Africa would have

855
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,100
no friends in the world at all.

856
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,230

857
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,220
a bold stroke the world wants,

858
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,230
then you may be holding

( Reporters clamoring )

868
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,230
It is therefore not

the South African government

870
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,070
which stands in the way

871
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,000
of mandela's release.

872
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,020
It is Mr. Mandela himself.

873

>> Mr. Mandela, we are

874
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,090
offering to set you free.

875
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,100
You can go home and be

876

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
immediately.

881
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,220
>> Renounce the violence

882
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,230
and you can go home.

883
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,070
That is what we can offer you.

884
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,150

885
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,090
our point of view.

to do anything.

888
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,210
He is the president, and you

889
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,150
have got his final offer.

890

891
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,200
advise president botha that

892
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,000

I think.

900
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,150
He's a logical man.

901
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,230
>> Look what he's done--

902
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,060
he's stolen the spotlight

903
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,090
from the government.

904
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,180
It's pointing directly at him

905
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,080
now, and the whole world

906
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,120
is waiting for his answer.

907
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,010

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,210
so well--will sign the bill

1153
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:33,060
into law.

1154
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,110
>> It is of no consequence!

1155
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,200
We will not be bullied!

1156
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,040
>> If it was simply a matter

1157
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,070
of being bullied, there would

1158
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,070
be no problem.

1159
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,130
I would welcome the attention.

1160
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,200
But the world has decided that

1161
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,210
South Africa doesn't exist.

1162
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:48,140
>> Then that is their delusion.

1163
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,060
>> Economic sanctions from the

1164
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,160
most powerful nation in

1165
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,180
the world is no delusion.

1166
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,210
>> Stand firm with me,

1167
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:58,100
gentlemen--

1168
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,120
for our fatherland,

1169
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,130
for god's sake.

1170
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:05,020
( People screaming )

1171
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,010
( Screaming continues )

1172
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,210
>> Winnie: Yesterday, another

1173
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,180
police informant was given

1174
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,140
the necklace of shame!

1175
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,100
Wear the uniform

1176
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,030
of our oppressors,

1177
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,090
wear the necklace of

1178
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:50,020
the people's justice!

1179
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,000
>> All: Viva!

1180
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,040
>> We have to face this

1181
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,130
government's mighty weapons

1182
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,000
of destruction to gain

1183
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,130
our freedom.

1184
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:01,160
>> All: Viva!

1185
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,230
>> Viva! We have no guns.

1186
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:08,020
Only stones, boxes of matches,

1187
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,190
and petrol.

1188
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,140
But with our boxes of matches,

1189
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,130
hand in hand together,

1190
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:15,190
we shall liberate

1191
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,080
this country!

1192
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,070
>> All: Viva!

1193
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,110
>> Winnie...

1194
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:24,150
Have you lost your mind?

1195
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,060
>> I said what needed

1196
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,220
to be said. I have no regret.

1197
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:32,110
>> Well, you should.

1198
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,190
Our movement is based on the

1199
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:38,080
moral strength of our ideas

1200
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,090
and our ideals.

1201
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,200
There is nothing moral about

1202
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,180
dousing a man with petrol

1203
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,220
and burning him to death

1204
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,010
in the middle of--

1205
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,000
>> nor is there anything moral

1206
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,120
about them pimpies,

1207
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,000
these traitors and informants

1208
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,110
in our neighborhood who have

1209
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:56,050
turned our lives in to hell.

1210
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:58,130
>> You will never, ever

1211
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:01,230
jeopardize this movement,

1212
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:06,230
our family and your life,

1213
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:10,160
with this kind of

1214
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,010
ill-conceived outburst.

1215
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,040
Do you hear me?

1216
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,130
>> Yes. I hear that you are

1217
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:18,230
telling me I cannot speak

1218
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,170
my own mind.

1219
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:23,170
>> I am telling you that

1220
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,070
you are not an individual.

1221
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:28,190
You do not speak for yourself.

1222
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,140
You speak for the African

1223
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,050
national congress.

1224
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:34,060
You speak for a cause--

1225
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,040
of freedom, justice,

1226
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:40,180
and equality for all people.

1227
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,000
And you speak

1228
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,150
for Nelson Mandela.

1229
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:47,030
And you will not bring harm

1230
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,180
or dishonor to all we have

1231
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,210
worked for with these kinds of

1232
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:56,220
incendiary and intemperate

1233
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:00,050
remarks.

1234
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,050
Are we clear?

1235
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:03,210
>> Mm.

1236
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:06,120
>> Are we clear?!

1237
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,100
>> Yes.

1238
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,150
We are.

1239
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:21,130
>> ( Grunts )

1240
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:23,010
>> Are you all right?

1241
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:25,190
>> I'm fine, fine.

1242
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,120
>> Good god, man.

1243
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,140
>> I'm afraid I'm not

1244
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,220
as strong as I pre--

1245
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,010
ohh!

1246
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,100
>> Mr. Mandela!

1247
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,030
( Blows whistle )

1248
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:44,010
>> He has tuberculosis.

1249
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,070
They have to operate.

1250
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,020
>> T.b.?

1251
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,070
>> Oh, no.

1252
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,070
>> You don't cure t.B.

1253
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,100
By operating on it.

1254
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,070
>> He has fluid on his lungs.

1255
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,120
>> Good evening, Mr. Mandela.

1256
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,060
Are you ready?

1257
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,210
>> Let's get it over with,

1258
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,070
doctor.

1259
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:07,180
( Laughs )

1260
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,000
>> Something wrong,

1261
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,150
Mr. Mandela?

1262
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:13,090
>> I was just thinking--

1263
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,070
how do I know that, under that

1264
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,200
mask of yours, you are not

1265
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,170
really president botha?

1266
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:24,020
( All laugh )

1267
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,190
Ah, sergeant.

1268
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,090
Finally, you have come

1269
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,140
to fetch me.

1270
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,100
>> Yes, I have.

1271
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,110
You're looking good.

1272
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,190
>> Thank you.

1273
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:37,030
I hope they missed me

1274
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,000
back there.

1275
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,040
>> They certainly did,

1276
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,080
I can assure you of that.

1277
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,170
>> It will be nice to see

1278
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:45,030
my old friends again.

1279
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:46,040
>> You're not going to be

1280
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,050
seeing them for a while,

1281
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:48,160
I'm afraid.

1282
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,170
>> Why?

1283
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,150
What happened?

1284
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,160
>> You're not going back

1285
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,160
to pollsmoor.

1286
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,080
Orders.

1287
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,090
>> Where are they sending me?

1288
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,080
>> You've got complete

1289
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,190
run of the house,

1290
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:49,020
including the swimming pool.

1291
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,180
There's a TV, stereo,

1292
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,100
access to as many newspapers,

1293
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,210
magazines and books

1294
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:00,020
as you like.

1295
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,210
Uncensored.

1296
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:04,000
You'll receive

1297
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,080
all your mail here--

1298
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,180
censored, I'm afraid.

1299
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,100
All the creature comforts

1300
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,020
of home, hmm?

1301
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,130
Including more frequent

1302
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:15,160
and unsupervised family visits.

1303
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,020
So...what do you think, eh?

1304
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,060
>> Tell your president

1305
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:26,130
I appreciate my new home.

1306
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,150
And he should come by

1307
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:36,060
and visit me in it sometime.

1308
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:41,230
( Knock on door )

1309
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:43,050
>> Is he ready?

1310
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,120
>> Just a minute.

1311
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,120
He'll be ready in a minute.

1312
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:52,060
Here we go--your jacket.

1313
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,080
>> First-class service.

1314
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,110
>> No, no, no, no.

1315
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:56,150
>> I like it, I like it.

1316
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:57,200
>> That tie won't work.

1317
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,090
Here.

1318
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:00,210
>> Ah, a windsor knot.

1319
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,030
I much prefer them.

1320
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:03,050
I much prefer them.

1321
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,040
>> Okay, let's go.

1322
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,150
>> Good luck.

1323
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,130
( Indistinct chatter )

1324
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,010
>> Wait, wait.

1325
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:26,030
>> What?

1326
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,120
>> Your shoelaces.

1327
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,050
>> Ah. Heh heh.

1328
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:37,210
Forgive me, I had forgotten.

1329
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:40,190
It's been 25 years since I've

1330
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:43,160
been all dressed up like this.

1331
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,010
>> Please come.

1332
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,000
>> Thank you.

1333
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,150
>> Mr. Mandela.

1334
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:51,070
Please.

1335
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,000
>> Mr. Mandela, it gives me

1336
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,010
great pleasure to introduce

1337
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:57,050
to you the president,

1338
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,130
p.w. Botha.

1339
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,180

>> Mr. President.

1341

>> Please, sit down.

1342
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,140
>> Thank you.

1343
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,010
>> Tea for you?

1344
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:06,130
>> Thank you.

1345
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,030
>> So, you're recovery from

1346
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:11,160
tuberculosis has gone well?

1347
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,030
>> Quite, thank you for asking.

1348
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,100
And you? I had heard

1349
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,190
you had had a slight--

1350
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:17,200
>> stroke, yeah.

1351
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,150
Some people seemed to think

1352
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,220
it would knock me back a bit,

1353
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,080
but I showed those young people

1354
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,200
a thing or two.

1355
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,160
You know, they call me

1356
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,040
die groot krokodil.

1357
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,100
>> ( Laughs )

1358
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,190
The big crocodile, yeah.

1359
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:33,020
>> But I prefer to think of

1360
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,200
myself as a bull.

1361
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,210
An old bull.

1362
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:39,180
And in my culture, an old bull

1363
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,140
is a powerful symbol.

1364
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,140
>> In my xhosa culture as well,

1365
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,200
Mr. President.

1366
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,080
>> Well, then, we've both

1367
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,060
shown them what a couple of

1368
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,140
old bulls can do, huh?

1369
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,150
( All laugh )

1370
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:57,030
>> We say that when you yoke

1371
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,200
two bulls together,

1372
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,090
they pull hardest when they

1373
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,150
cooperate, Mr. President.

1374
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,080
>> Yeah.

1375
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,030
Well, Mr. Mandela, I think you

1376
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,050
and I have a lot to talk about.

1377
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:14,130
>> I don't think there is

1378
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,020
anything we can't solve,

1379
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,140
Mr. President.

1380
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:20,010
>> Good.

1381
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:24,040
>> To start, I would like to

1382
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,120
discuss the possibility

1383
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,050
of releasing my compatriot

1384
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:30,000
Walter sisulu.

1385
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,060
The years have not been

1386
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,060
easy on him.

1387
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,150
>> Yes. Well, I'll have my

1388
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,160
ministers look to that matter,

1389
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,060
rest assured.

1390
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,110
Is there anything else,

1391
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,220
Mr. Mandela?

1392
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,070
>> Obviously, there are many

1393
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:49,100
matters, Mr. President.

1394
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,040
>> Good.

1395
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,070
I'm happy to have had this

1396
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,150
opportunity to meet with you,

1397
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,070
Mr. Mandela.

1398
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:56,160
You're an interesting man.

1399
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,060
>> But, sir, you can't be

1400
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,020
leaving just yet.

1401
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,040
>> I must, I'm afraid.

1402
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,020
I have pressing business

1403
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,040
elsewhere.

1404
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,170
I only wanted this to be

1405
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,000
a courtesy meeting anyway.

1406
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,180
I'm sure you will understand.

1407
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:10,110
Once again, a pleasure.

1408
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,160
>> Newscaster: A 14-year-old

1409
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,040
boy was found murdered

1410
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,130
earlier this morning in the

1411
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,030
home of Winnie Mandela.

1412
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:24,130
Authorities are conducting

1413
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:27,030
an investigation to determine

1414
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,100
the motive and responsibility

1415
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,190
for his death.

1416
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,210
Meanwhile, according to

1417
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:33,030
police, an autopsy will be

1418
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,110
performed in accordance with

1419
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,090
the ongoing investigation.

1420
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:39,080
( Newscast continues )

1421
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,160
>> It's very bad.

1422
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,170
A boy was killed in the house.

1423
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:53,000
14 years old, they say.

1424
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,200
>> Winnie--

1425
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,080
was she there?

1426
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,020
>> We don't know.

1427
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,150
>> I think you should arrange

1428
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:15,200
for her to come see me,

1429
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,220
discuss the matter.

1430
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:26,110
Winnie...

1431
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:28,060
Were you there?

1432
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,020
>> No.

1433
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,070
I was not. I told you.

1434
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,180
>> Did you know what these

1435
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,220
young men of yours were doing

1436
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,030
to the boy?

1437
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,010
>> They are not my young men.

1438
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:39,200
They are my bodyguards.

1439
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,000
>> Did you know what

1440
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,070
they were doing to--

1441
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,100
>> no. I do not want to

1442
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,020
discuss this!

1443
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,160
It has nothing to do with me.

1444
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,210
I gave that boy refuge

1445
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:50,190
in my house, that is all.

1446
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:53,070
Please, let's just leave it.

1447
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:55,180
>> I insist that you face it.

1448
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:58,110
>> I knew nothing.

1449
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:00,000
Why are you cross-examining me

1450
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,060
like this?

1451
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,170
I am innocent.

1452
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:04,140
I did not lay a hand

1453
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:07,030
on that boy.

1454
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:11,040
>> I believe you, winnie.

1455
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,040
>> I trust people too much.

1456
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,100
That has always been

1457
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,030
my problem.

1458
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:19,050
>> No. Your problem is that

1459
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,190
you trust the wrong people.

1460
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:25,010
You have to ask yourself--

1461
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:26,140
what did you do to let this

1462
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,090
evil into your house?

1463
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:30,010
This can be a political

1464
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:31,180
embarrassment, winnie.

1465
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:33,010
But first and foremost,

1466
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:34,160
it is a tragedy.

1467
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,080
A young boy was murdered.

1468
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:41,040
>> I know nothing about it.

1469
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,140
>> Winnie, listen.

1470
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,020
I have started a process

1471
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,100
the end of which cannot

1472
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,150
be predicted.

1473
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:52,080
I cannot say what tactics

1474
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,100
the regime will employ

1475
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,030
against me.

1476
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,100
I have to be constantly

1477
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,000
vigilant.

1478
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,110
This business about the boy,

1479
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:03,130
this tragedy, tugs at my mind,

1480
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,140
drags me away from where

1481
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:08,170
my mind should be.

1482
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,200
Do you understand?

1483
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,060
Do you?

1484
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,180
>> I am not like you, Nelson--

1485
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:21,090
all analysis and discipline

1486
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,080
and will.

1487
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,020
I smash into things.

1488
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:28,030
I yell, I scream, I cry.

1489
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:31,140
I make mistakes.

1490
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,230
Stompie was a mistake.

1491
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:36,060
>> That is not good enough,

1492
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:37,140
winnie.

1493
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:40,030
This was not merely a mistake.

1494
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:43,050
A boy died in your house.

1495
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:45,040
>> I know.

1496
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,040
>> These bodyguards of yours--

1497
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,190
what do they call themselves--

1498
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:50,040
the mandela football club?

1499
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,070
Get rid of them.

1500
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:54,120
>> Yes, of course. Yes.

1501
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,160
>> Try not to make

1502
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,140
any more mistakes.

1503
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:59,150
Our enemies seize on them

1504
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:02,070
and turn them against US.

1505
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:04,010
>> Please, let's not fight

1506
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:07,000
over it.

1507
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,180
I just have these few moments

1508
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,000
with you.

1509
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,100
Let's not spend them fighting.

1510
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:18,030

01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:57,060
>> All: A.N.C.! A.N.C.! A.N.C.!

1528
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,020
>> Everybody here?

1529
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,210
>> Yes.

1530
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:06,070
( Indistinct chatter )

1531
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:10,200
>> Mr. President, I'm speaking

1532
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,020
to you not only as chairman

1533
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,070
of the party and a member

1534
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:15,050
of the cabinet, but as a friend

1535
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,020
and as an admirer.

1536
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,160
We have all learned a great

1537
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,230
deal from you, sir.

1538
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,230
You are a strong,

1539
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:22,220
proud warrior, a defender

1540
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,060
of the traditions that have

1541
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:25,180
made our nation great, and--

1542
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,050
>> yes, yes, yes.

1543
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:30,080
Sit, gentlemen.

1544
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,050
That's all very fine, but you

1545
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:33,210
know and I know that you did

1546
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,040
not come all the way out here

1547
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,100
at 8:30 in the morning

1548
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,000
to flatter me.

1549
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,090
If you have something to say,

1550
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:42,150
then say it.

1551
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:48,190
>> Sir...you've had two strokes

1552
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:50,070
within the past year.

1553
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,090
You've resigned your

1554
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,180
chairmanship of

1555
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,220
the national party, where

1556
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:56,080
Mr. De klerk has replaced you.

1557
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,130
>> Not my choice.

1558
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:59,020
But go on.

1559
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:03,080
>> With respect, sir, we think

1560
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,200
you should consider playing

1561
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,130
a more--how shall I put it?

1562
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:11,010
>> You want me to resign?

1563
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:12,230
>> ( Sighs ) We think

1564
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:14,150
you should appoint

1565
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,090
an acting president,

1566
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:17,210
take a rest for a while.

1567
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:19,020
>> If you want me to resign,

1568
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,100
then say so.

1569
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,180
>> Well, at least until after

1570
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,010
the elections, sir,

1571
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:27,020
by which time you--

1572
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:30,030
>> enough! So...This is how

1573
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:32,040
you all feel, is it?

1574
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,140
Answer me.

1575
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:35,110
Who agrees with him?

1576
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:48,090
So...

1577
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:49,120
Well, let me tell you what

1578
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,070
I think of you.

1579
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:52,210
You are cowards.

1580
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:54,080
>> This isn't an argument,

1581
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,030
Mr. President.

1582
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,180
We are here to tell you

1583
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,110
that it's time to stand down.

1584
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:01,050
>> No! You stand down!

1585
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:03,100
And you! You!

1586
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,180
I should fire all of you.

1587
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:07,100
I have the right.

1588
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,160
I'm still president,

1589
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,170
you hypocrites.

1590
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,200
>> Mr. President, the country

1591
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,070
needs new leadership.

1592
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:13,230
The failure of the mandela

1593
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:15,030
talks, the failure to resolve

1594
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:16,180
the violence in the townships--

1595
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,230
>> all I need is time!

1596
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:19,070
>> And now there's evidence

1597
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:21,030
of scandal and corruption.

1598
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:23,040
Mr. President...

1599
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,180
There is an election coming up.

1600
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:30,070
You asked me to be frank.

1601
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,230
Well, then, sir...

1602
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,150
You have become a liability

1603
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:40,050
to our party.

1604
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,130
>> You go too far.

1605
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:43,030
>> Will you resign?

1606
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:50,090
>> Yes!

1607
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:52,080
Yes!

1608
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,130
I will resign.

1609
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:55,220
And tonight, I will go

1610
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,060
on television and announce

1611
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:00,020
to the world what a pack of

1612
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:03,020
liars and traitors you all are.

1613
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:04,020
I'm finished with

1614
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:05,050
with the lot of you.

1615
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,230
Liars, all of you! Liars!

1616
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:15,210
>> Congratulations,

1617
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:18,020
Mr. President.

1618
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,160
>> Good work.

1619
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,180
>> Thank you.

1620
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,220
>> Hear, hear, Mr. President.

1621
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,210
>> Well done, sir.

1622
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:50,210
>> Good evening.

1623
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:54,080
>> Good evening, Mr. President.

1624
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,170
May I introduce

1625
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:57,070
Mr. Nelson Mandela?

1626
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:59,140
>> Mr. Mandela.

1627
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,080
Good to meet you.

1628
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:05,150
>> ( Speaks afrikaans )

1629
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:07,010
>> I'd heard that you spoke

1630
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:09,110
fluent afrikaans, Mr. Mandela.

1631
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:11,010
>> I haven't had much

1632
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:13,050
practice for a while.

1633
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:14,190
>> Please. Thank you,

1634
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:16,140
minister coetsee.

1635
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:17,210
I've read some of your

1636
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:19,170
writings--

1637
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:22,170
a speech from the '50s,

1638
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:24,050
your statement prior to

1639
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:27,100
your imprisonment in 1964.

1640
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:30,130
Please.

1641
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:34,060
You are a most eloquent and

1642
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,180
passionate man, Mr. Mandela.

1643
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,130
>> Thank you.

1644
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:40,000
Let US hope that our discourse

1645
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,190
is marked more by eloquence

1646
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,150
than passion.

1647
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:46,090
>> Please, sit down.

1648
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:48,000
You understand--

1649
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,080
I make no promises.

1650
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,110
>> As long as our conversations

1651
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:54,150
take US forward.

1652
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:56,190
>> Well, then, a good sign

1653
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:58,120
of progress would be

1654
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,220
an end to the armed struggle

1655
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:01,100
on your side,

1656
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,100
a commitment to peace.

1657
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,160
>> For now, my willingness

1658
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,150
to talk is precisely the

1659
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:10,050
commitment to peace you seek.

1660
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:11,070
>> Let me put it this way--

1661
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:12,210
I want your guarantee--

1662
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:14,120
>> excuse me, Mr. President.

1663
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,170
I can offer you no guarantee

1664
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,200
of any kind.

1665
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,010
I'd have to speak with

1666
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:21,160
my colleagues first.

1667
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:24,140
>> Well, how can that work?

1668
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,210
Most of your people are

1669
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:26,230
officially banned and living

1670
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:28,080
in exile.

1671
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,210
>> Of course.

1672
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:31,060
But if that is

1673
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,090
an inconvenience, you can

1674
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:35,180
always UN-ban the a.N.C.

1675
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:37,020
And let our leaders come home

1676
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,040
so they can give you their

1677
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,130
assurances in person.

1678
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,230
>> That's impossible.

1679
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,080
At this time.

1680
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:53,020
>> At this time.

1681
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:57,120
>> I'm a realist, Mr. Mandela.

1682
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,110
Once my government commits

1683
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:01,230
itself to negotiations,

1684
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:03,040
both you and I know

1685
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,030
what the outcome must be.

1686
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:07,070
>> Free and Democratic

1687
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:10,050
elections for all the people.

1688
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:11,160
>> Mm-hmm. I am under

1689
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,040
no delusions.

1690
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,210
But I will not countenance

1691
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:16,100
power-grabbing.

1692
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:19,020
Power-sharing, yes.

1693
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,220
But not the blind abandonment

1694
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:22,190
of all power.

1695
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:24,210
>> Majority rule

1696
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:27,100
is not power-grabbing.

1697
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,180
>> No whites would be

1698
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:29,230
comfortable in a country

1699
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:31,060
dominated by blacks.

1700
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:33,120
>> For more than 300 years,

1701
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,220
you have been dominated

1702
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,190
by blacks.

1703
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:41,070
You've simply never

1704
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:44,140
acknowledged the fact.

1705
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:48,180
>> We must have some say

1706
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:50,100
in the future.

1707
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,130
>> If you are talking

1708
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:54,080
about anything less than

1709
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,020
one person, one vote, it is

1710
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:59,030
a non-negotiable item.

1711
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:00,140
>> The rest of Africa

1712
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,180
is full of the relics

1713
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:03,000
of democracies that gave

1714
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,110
one man one vote...

1715
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,220
Once.

1716
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:13,200
Mr. Mandela...

1717
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,170
Everything is negotiable.

1718
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,190
>> I'm sorry, sir.

1719
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:21,180
But what you are proposing

1720
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:23,080
is nothing less than

1721
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,010
a transparent attempt

1722
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:28,030
to maintain white control.

1723
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:30,200
>> You're being unduly cynical,

1724
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,170
Mr. Mandela.

1725
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:35,030
>> That is a matter of opinion,

1726
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,040
Mr. President.

1727
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:41,110
>> Well...we will have to

1728
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:43,030
change it, then.

1729
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,190
You and I are both going to

1730
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:47,000
have to be willing to make

1731
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,210
some compromises.

1732
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,000
If we want to set

1733
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,110
ground rules, we need to

1734
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:54,190
begin negotiations.

1735
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:00,170
>> Mr. President, I don't mean

1736
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:02,230
to flatter you when I say that

1737
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:05,160
I sense an integrity here

1738
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,010
that has not distinguished

1739
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,230
many of your predecessors.

1740
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:15,120
So, yes...

1741
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,020
I agree.

1742
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:21,150
>> Good.

1743
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:24,020
Then let's begin.

1744
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:28,070
I've crossed the point

1745
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:29,180
of no return, kobie.

1746
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,010
I've embarked on my own

1747
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:32,070
perestroika.

1748
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,000
>> Yeah. The trick now

1749
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,110
is not to suffer the same fate

1750
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:36,190
as gorbachev.

1751
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:38,080
>> Do you know that mandela

1752
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,180
was once a boxer?

1753
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:40,210
>> Yeah.

1754
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:42,000
>> He'll know that you've got

1755
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,130
to roll with the punches.

1756
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:45,160
He'll expect me to give ground,

1757
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,200
but he can't expect me

1758
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,170
to commit suicide.

1759
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,230
I will not go down in history

1760
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:52,140
as the man who destroyed

1761
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,000
his own people.

1762
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,070
>> So, marike, you and Frederik

1763
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:57,070
used to all the pomp

1764
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:58,060
and ceremony here?

1765
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,100
>> There's not as much of that

1766
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,090
around as with Mr. Botha.

1767
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:03,010
But it's been quite a year,

1768
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:04,080
thank you very much.

1769
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,100
>> I'm very proud of you,

1770
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,150
Frederik.

1771
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:08,000
>> Thank you, thank you.

1772
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
>> And when I think

1773
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,010
how I used to nag you.

1774
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:11,060
>> Don't stop nagging me now.

1775
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,190
I've come to rely on it.

1776
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:15,200
( Laughter )

1777
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,040
>> What about all the unrest,

1778
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,180
Frederik, hmm?

1779
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:19,210
Are you going to maintain--

1780
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,000
>> all part of the job.

1781
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,020
It's going to be all right.

1782
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,080
>> The people expect

1783
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,170
so much of him.

1784
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:27,070
You're only one man, Frederik.

1785
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:28,080
>> Do you remember what

1786
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,150
the reverend bingle said

1787
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:31,170
at my inauguration?

1788
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:33,170
"He who stands in the council

1789
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:35,230
chamber of god should be strong

1790
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:37,130
in his willingness to pursue

1791
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:39,210
the right course and push

1792
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:42,090
forward new reforms."

1793
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:44,140
>> It was quite a sermon.

1794
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,110
>> Yes, but from the pulpit,

1795
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:49,020
the world is a simple place.

1796
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,210
Frederik, you can't change

1797
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:52,070
the world overnight.

1798
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:55,040
I don't care what anyone says.

1799
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,160
>> It seems to me that there is

1800
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,170
a just road to be taken.

1801
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:00,090
I don't know, some people will

1802
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:01,190
hate me for what I'm going

1803
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:03,090
to do, but I have to move

1804
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:05,020
forward, and I have to believe

1805
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:06,170
that my vision of the future

1806
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:09,090
isn't simply an accident.

1807
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,130
( Overlapping chatter )

1808
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:16,070
>> Yes, yes.

1809
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:17,170
Listen to me.

1810
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:20,040
Listen! Listen!

1811
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,050
The time has come for our

1812
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:24,150
nation to take a new course,

1813
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,110
to bridge the gap between

1814
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,180
political fantasy

1815
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:30,000
and practical reality.

1816
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,060
As a result, today and

1817
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,040
henceforth, the policy of

1818
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,160
social engineering

1819
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,100
known as apartheid

1820
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,070
will cease to exist.

( Overlapping chatter )

1822
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,060
All political prisoners will

1823
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,000
have their cases reviewed,

1824
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,170
and the minister of justice

1825
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:57,200
will determine which prisoners

1826
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,210
will be freed.

1827
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:09,140

1833
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:42,170
>> Gabi.

>> Madiba.

1838
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:50,100
>> Raymond.

1839
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,080
>> See you.

1840
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,080
>> Nervous?

1841
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,220
>> It's been such a long time,

Nelson.

1843
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:01,090
Freedom--i always knew

1844
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:04,010
it would come, but...

1845
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:07,170
>> I'll be joining you soon.

1846
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,050
>> Until then?

1847
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:13,160
>> Agitate.

1848
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,130
Old lion.

1849
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:18,030

you to understand what i'm

trying to do.

1857
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,130

to US by god, Frederik.

1859
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:15,070
It's our homeland.

1860
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,100
And what you are doing

1861
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,120
frightens me.

1862
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,160
>> It is frightening,

1863
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,160
I know that.

1864
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,150
Don't you think I feel that

1865
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,150
as well?

1866
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:22,220
I have to push forward.

1867
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:24,090
If we don't share this country,

1868
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:26,010
we afrikaaners will lose it.

1869

>> It's not the sharing

1870
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,140
that frightens me.

1871
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,020
It's the anger of terre'blanche

and his people.

1873
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:32,220
You've read the reports.

1874
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:35,090
This could lead to civil war,

and that is the future.

1881
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,160
The future is where we live

1882
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,180
from now on, and we have to

1883

accustom ourselves to that

>> And we lost.

1889
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:57,160
We have to learn

from our history.

01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:20,040
that elements of the

1902
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,060
intelligence community

1903
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,080
and the army are directly

1904
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,090
involved in fomenting

1905
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:24,160
violence among the blacks.

1906
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,230
>> That is a vicious rumor

1907
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:27,220
without any basis in reality.

1908
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,060
( Reporters shouting at once )

1909
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:30,090
I'll tell you unequivocally

1910
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:31,220
there are no secret government

1911
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,140
agencies connected in any way

1912
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:35,060
with any of these incidents.

1913
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,190
You have my word on that.

1914
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:44,190
( Men shouting

1915
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:47,220
in native language )

1916
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:50,210
>> Mandela: How do you expect

1917
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:52,150
me to take these talks

1918
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:55,020
seriously when people in your

1919
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:56,120
government have armed

1920
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,200
the inkatha freedom party

1921
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,150
in kwazulu-natal?

1922
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:02,040
>> That is absolute nonsense.

1923
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,210
To what purpose?

1924
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:05,130
>> To neutralize the a.N.C.--

1925
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:06,230
what else?

1926
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:08,040
By intimidation and

1927
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,160
assassination, your people have

1928
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,150
given inkatha carte blanche

1929
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:13,040
to create havoc.

1930
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,100
>> Chief buthelezi has the

1931
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,170
overwhelming support of

1932
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,180
the majority of people

1933
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:17,180
in his province.

1934
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:18,200
He doesn't need me to whip up

1935
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,190
support for him.

1936
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:23,080
>> Then how do they have

1937
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,030
so many guns?

1938
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:26,110
>> How does the a.N.C.?

1939
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:28,020
>> Certainly not supplied

1940
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,170
by your government.

1941
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:31,040
>> Damn you, Mr. Mandela.

1942
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,070
You give a person so little

1943
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:33,150
room to maneuver.

1944
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:36,090
>> I have had very little room

1945
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:37,110
to maneuver myself

1946
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:39,010
for two decades.

1947
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:41,160
One learns to adapt.

1948
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,220
>> Those are hardly the words

1949
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:44,110
one expects from a retired

1950
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:46,030
revolutionary.

1951
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:48,040
>> Mr. President, if you expect

1952
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,070
me to go out to pasture

1953
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:51,090
upon my release--

1954
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:52,200
whenever that is--

1955
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:56,100
you are greatly mistaken.

1956
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,090
If I find conditions are

1957
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:00,100
the same as they were the day

1958
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:03,040
I was arrested, I will go back

1959
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,090
to doing precisely those things

1960
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:07,160
for which I was imprisoned.

1961
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:12,230
>> Now, that helps no one.

1962
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:16,190
>> Then UN-ban the a.N.C.

1963
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:18,150
And all other political parties

1964
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:20,120
on your banning list.

1965
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:23,070
Release the political prisoners

1966
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:26,230
and allow the exiles to return.

1967
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:29,120
>> Mr. Mandela, I will take

1968
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,220
everything that you have said

1969
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:32,020
under advisement.

1970
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:34,010
>> I know.

1971
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:36,050
No promises.

1972
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:37,230
>> De klerk: I have ordered

1973
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,110
that the prohibition of the

1974
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:41,040
African national congress,

1975
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,060
the pan-African congress,

1976
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,110
the South African communist

1977
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:46,100
party and 33 other

1978
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,210
organizations, be lifted

1979
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,140
with immediate effect.

1980
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:51,040
( Overlapping chatter )

1981
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,190
As to the position of

1982
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:55,010
Nelson Mandela, I will make

1983
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:56,060
an announcement within

1984
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,170
the next few days concerning

1985
01:19:57,170 --> 01:19:59,050
the date of his release.

1986
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:02,060
( Overlapping chatter )

1987
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:07,010
It is very important to me

1988
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,070
that discussions with

1989
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,020
the a.N.C. Begin at once.

1990
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,000
Our troubles have caused US

1991
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,110
enough pain and suffering.

1992
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:16,050
The time for negotiation

1993
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,180
has arrived.

1994
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:21,110
( Overlapping shouts )

1995
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:23,030
I can't very well carry on

1996
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:24,130
important negotiations like

1997
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:26,130
these with an inmate, can I?

1998
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:28,010
>> Release me? But--

1999
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:29,060
I mean, when?

2000
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:30,110
>> Tomorrow.

2001
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:31,170
>> Mr. President,

2002
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:33,110
tomorrow is much too soon.

2003
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:36,060
Please, delay my release.

2004
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,030
>> I beg your pardon?

2005
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:39,150
>> I don't want to appear

2006
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:41,020
ungrateful, Mr. President,

2007
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,110
but I must insist that you

2008
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:44,230
delay any plans for my release.

2009
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:47,080
>> You're joking, of course.

2010
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,030
>> I need seven days

2011
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:51,010
so my family can prepare

2012
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:52,110
for my release.

2013
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:54,100
There will be chaos out there

2014
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,110
if I simply walk out.

2015
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:57,090
>> Damn it, man,

2016
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,180
I'm freeing you!

2017
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:02,040
>> I've waited 27 years.

2018
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,180
Certainly I can wait

2019
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:05,140
seven more days.

2020
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:07,070
>> A government plane will

2021
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:09,040
take you back to Johannesburg,

2022
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,100
where you'll be officially

2023
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,010
released.

2024
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:14,200
Please sit down, Mr. Mandela.

2025
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,060
>> Mr. President...

2026
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:19,020
I will walk out of the gates

2027
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,180
of Victor verster prison

2028
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:22,170
in seven days.

2029
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:24,160
And on that date, I will

2030
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,040
personally thank all those

2031
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,000
who have looked after me.

2032
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,050
And I will greet the people

2033
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:31,120
of Cape Town.

2034
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,230
>> Look here, Mr. Mandela.

2035
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:34,030
We have already set

2036
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:35,050
your itinerary--

2037
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:36,130
>> Mr. President...

2038
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:39,060
Cape Town has been my home

2039
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,060
for nearly 30 years.

2040
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:42,220
There are people in Cape Town

2041
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:44,010
I must--

2042
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:45,110
>> but we have a schedule.

2043
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:47,190
>> Yes, Johannesburg.

2044
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:49,150
Well, I will make my own way

2045
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:51,080
back there when I choose,

2046
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,080
not when the government

2047
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,220
wants me to.

2048
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:55,220
Once I am free, I will look

2049
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:57,180
after myself.

2050
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,200
>> Mr. Mandela, we can't change

2051
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,070
plans now.

2052
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:03,070
I've already told the press.

2053
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:06,110
>> How dare you speak to the

2054
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:08,090
press without consulting me?

2055
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,020
>> I'm the president, not you!

2056
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:12,110
>> I will be released

2057
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:14,120
when I say so...

2058
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,190
And not a day sooner!

2059
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:18,170
>> Uh, Mr. President?

2060
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:21,150
Maybe we...

2061
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,040
>> All right, then.

2062
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:35,060
I will agree to Victor verster

2063
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:36,220
if you will agree

2064
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:39,010
to release tomorrow.

2065
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:49,080
>> I can accept that.

2066
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:01,040
>> Mr. Mandela, must you

2067
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,120
fight me on every issue?

2068
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,010
>> Must you, Mr. President?

2069
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,110
>> Hurry up, everybody.

2070
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:11,090
We are running late.

2071
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:13,100
>> Okay, the press will be

2072
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:15,010
waiting at the gate for you.

2073
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:17,190
Sabc-TV has asked that you

2074
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:19,010
leave the car 100 feet

2075
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:20,030
from the gate

2076
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:21,100
and walk through the gate.

2077
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,120
>> Is that what they call

2078
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,220
a photo opportunity?

2079
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:26,040

in my life, Mr. Mandela, but...

2083
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,210
You know what I want to say.

2084
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:50,060

2086

approaching the gates now.

2091
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:23,010
Yes. Yes, the crowd is

2092
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:24,060
beginning to push forward.

2093
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,080
They've waited many hours

2094
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,160
for this moment, and the

2095
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,140
world has waited many years.

2096
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:30,080

will probably take him

2152

a township near Johannesburg.

2160
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,220

It was blacks killing blacks.

2176
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,030
The evidence is clear.

2177
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:29,230

>> You have much to gain.

2188
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:45,190
The more fear you sow amongst

2189
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:46,230
the people, the more votes you

2190
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:49,050
might gain in the elections.

2191

your security establishment,

2198
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:05,120
are manipulating events.

>> All right.

2205
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,180
Appoint an independent

commission to investigate

2207

( crowd chanting )

Wait a minute.

2228
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:22,220
Hold it. We must--

01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:24,050
( chanting continues )

2230

Listen to me!

Yes, we are angry,

2233
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:31,120
and we are full of rage.

2234
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,170
And we have every right to be!

( Cheering )

2236
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:40,060
But if I am to pick up my gun

2237
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,170
and pull the trigger, I want to

2238
01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:44,070
be damn sure I'm aiming

2239
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:45,160
at the right target!

2240
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:48,130

>> Kobie.

2242

>> Hmm? Ah. As you requested,

2243
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,080
Mr. President--the results

2244
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,060
of the independent British

2245
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:58,150
investigation.

2246
01:29:58,150 --> 01:30:00,050
>> And?

2247
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:01,100
>> It confirmed the a.N.C.'S

2248
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:02,180
allegations, sir.

2249
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:05,080
The police apparently escorted

2250
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,230
the attackers into the township

2251
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:08,130
and then back out again.

>> The police?

2253
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,200
I--i can't believe that

2254
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,010
the police would--

2255
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:18,010
>> the reports are consistent.

2256
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:20,050
There were 39 people shot,

2257
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:23,030
hacked, and stabbed to death--

2258
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:24,120
among them a nine-month-old

2259
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,170
baby, a four-year old girl,

2260
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:28,120
and 24 women, one of whom

2261
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:30,150
was pregnant.

2262
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:31,230
Of the survivors, nobody would

2263
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:33,030
talk to the police.

2264
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:34,070
They are convinced that

2265
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:35,220
the authorities were involved.

2266
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:38,080
>> So, the a.N.C.

2267
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:41,030
Is not to blame.

2268
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:43,070
Mandela was right.

2269
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:45,160
We are responsible.

2270
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,050
I'm going to the township.

2271
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:56,050
>> The township?

2272
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:57,100
>> I want them to know that

2273
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:58,080
I care.

2274
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,110
>> That's not a good idea.

2275
01:30:59,110 --> 01:31:00,220
>> There's too much at stake--

2276
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:02,070
the talks, my presidency.

2277
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:03,160
>> Sir--

2278
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,150
>> I am the president

2279
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:06,000
of South Africa.

2280
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,090
I have to be there.

2281
01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:09,160
( People shouting )

2282
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:28,050
>> It's no use, Mr. President.

2283
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:31,080
We have to get out.

2284
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,070
>> Driver.

2285
01:31:39,130 --> 01:31:40,160
>> I've been a member of

2286
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:43,120
the South African police force

2287
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:46,210
for ten years.

2288
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:49,190
For five years, I've attached

2289
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:51,110
to a secret organization

2290
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:53,120
inside the police force--

2291
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:57,230
the c-10 unit.

2292
01:31:57,230 --> 01:32:01,090
We were a hit squad.

2293
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:04,040
Our job was to spy on civilian

2294
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:06,220
enemies of the state

2295
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:09,000
and to commit assassinations

2296
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,180
when ordered.

2297
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:14,070
We delivered money, arms,

2298
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,120
to buthelezi's inkatha freedom

2299
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:19,030
party, for them to use

2300
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:21,070
against the a.N.C.

2301
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:27,050
We were told that our orders

2302
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:28,190
were cleared by top

2303
01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:30,150
government people.

2304
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:32,140
>> I tell you, I knew nothing.

2305
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:34,220
>> Don't tell me that.

2306
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:36,220
No leader of a nation can claim

2307
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:38,130
that sort of ignorance.

2308
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:39,230
>> My political career is

2309
01:32:39,230 --> 01:32:41,200
staked entire on our success,

2310
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,140
Mr. Mandela.

2311
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:45,020
Why would I allow something

2312
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:46,080
like this to proceed if i--

2313
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,230
>> you chose to see

2314
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:49,010
what you wanted to--

2315
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:50,060
>> who are you to accuse me?

2316
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:52,050
I have been honest with you--

2317
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:53,050
>> you turned away from that

2318
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:54,070
which you did not want--

2319
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:55,210
>> I've staked my career on the

2320
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:57,120
success of these negotiations.

2321
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,000
Now you tell me--

2322
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,120
>> and when it was convenient,

2323
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,180
simply forgot everything

2324
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:03,010
in between.

2325
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:05,010
That is true, isn't it?

2326
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:10,050
>> Think what you will,

2327
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:13,090
Mr. Mandela.

2328
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:15,190
But I am still the president

2329
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:18,080
of South Africa, and I am

2330
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:20,060
the one who will determine

2331
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:22,110
both of our futures.

2332
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:25,090
>> You will determine nothing,

2333
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:27,120
Mr. President.

2334
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:31,160
Any leader who chooses to

2335
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:34,000
remain blind when vision is

2336
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,180
what our nation needs

2337
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:38,080
is a lost man.

2338
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,230
A lost man can never lead

2339
01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:46,220
anywhere.

2340
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:06,030
>> So what happens now?

2341
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:07,230
>> In a few days, there will be

2342
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:10,000
the usual exchanges of

2343
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,170
communique and notes between

2344
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:14,060
between our intermediaries.

2345
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:20,110
De klerk and I will engage in

2346
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:22,010
long-distance name-calling

2347
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:23,220
in the press, and after that,

2348
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,190
god only knows.

2349
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:28,010
In the meantime, perhaps you

2350
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:29,140
and I can find some time for

2351
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:31,160
ourselves at last.

2352
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:33,150
What is it, winnie?

2353
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:39,120
>> These came today.

2354
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,040
They are charging me with

2355
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,200
kidnapping and assault

2356
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:45,050
of stompie seipei.

2357
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:49,020
>> Mandela: Walter, you know

2358
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:50,150
what this case is about.

2359
01:34:50,150 --> 01:34:53,020
It is an election ploy.

2360
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:55,040
By prosecuting her, they hope

2361
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,170
to do damage to me.

2362
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:58,050
Why do you think the government

2363
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:59,230
waited so long before they

2364
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:01,070
brought her to court?

2365
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,140
>> It's a pity she's given them

2366
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:04,010
so many opportunities.

2367
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:06,070
>> Walter, we are all friends,

2368
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:07,220
but there is a line.

2369
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:09,150
>> Even within the a.N.C.,

2370
01:35:09,150 --> 01:35:10,140
there are those people--

2371
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:12,000
>> you image I care what

2372
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,230
people think?

2373
01:35:13,230 --> 01:35:16,220
She is my wife and the mother

2374
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:18,170
of my daughters.

2375
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:21,040
She has supported me

2376
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:24,020
faithfully for 30 years.

2377
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:26,170
I will not abandon her now.

2378
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:29,130
>> Madiba, you are the father

2379
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:32,000
of the nation, a symbol

2380
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,220
to the entire world.

2381
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:36,070
Our country's in turmoil,

2382
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:37,070
and the success of our

2383
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:39,090
negotiations hangs by a thread.

2384
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:44,170
>> I will be faithful to her.

2385
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:52,170
>> Madiba, I hadn't meant

2386
01:35:52,170 --> 01:35:54,100
to raise this,

2387
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,210
but there's a letter.

2388
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:59,100
Winnie wrote it.

2389
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:02,120
>> A letter?

2390
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,070
From winnie?

2391
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:06,080
>> In her own handwriting.

2392
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,140
The press, I'm afraid,

2393
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:10,020
have copies.

2394
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:11,080
I've persuaded them not to

2395
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,160
print it before the trial

2396
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:13,190
is over.

2397
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:16,170
More than that I could not do.

2398
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:18,090
>> In finding Mrs. Mandela

2399
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:19,220
guilty of kidnapping and

2400
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:21,080
assaulting 14-year-old

2401
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,070
stompie seipei, the judge

2402
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:24,230
stressed that no connection

2403
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:26,020
has been established between

2404
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:27,180
the accused and the death

2405
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:29,050
of the young boy.

2406
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:30,190
Stompie was allegedly killed

2407
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:32,140
by members of a football team

2408
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:34,180
sponsored by Mrs. Mandela,

2409
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:36,010
some of whom also acted

2410
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:37,150
as her bodyguards.

2411
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:39,050
The police still have not

2412
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:40,210
been able to establish

2413
01:36:40,210 --> 01:36:42,130
a motive for the murder

2414
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:44,120
of the young activist.

2415
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,140
Suzanne baez, sabc-TV news,

2416
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:47,230
Johannesburg.

2417
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:49,000
>> They think they have

2418
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,170
beaten me.

2419
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:52,060
I will take their verdict

2420
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:54,020
to the appellate division.

2421
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:56,210
I have been here before.

2422
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,170
>> Winnie, you are facing

2423
01:36:58,170 --> 01:37:00,130
six years in prison.

2424
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:02,050
>> Who are they to judge me?

2425
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:06,010
>> I held on so tightly to

2426
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:08,040
the belief in your innocence.

2427
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,080
>> And you can continue.

2428
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:13,120
Stompie made his choice.

2429
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,200
I could not have saved him.

2430
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,100
No one could.

2431
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:19,080
>> I didn't even consider

2432
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,210
the alternatives.

2433
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:23,170
>> Stompie was a traitor.

2434
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,100
No one could have saved him,

2435
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:26,160
Nelson.

2436
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:28,170
No one could.

2437
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:32,060
We were at war.

2438
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:34,210
>> With children?

2439
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:40,000
>> So, I am to be sacrificed?

2440
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,060
Madiba...

2441
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,180
I love you. How could you--

2442
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:55,050
>> oh...don't say those words

2443
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:59,100
to me, winnie, not now.

2444
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:02,220
Don't use that word

2445
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:04,120
to describe what our

2446
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,200
relationship has been since

2447
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:08,150
I was released from prison.

2448
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:11,060
This is the early edition

2449
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:14,150
of tomorrow's newspaper.

2450
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:17,070
Did you think I didn't know?

2451
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:20,040
That I couldn't guess?

2452
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,150
Was he just one more lapse of

2453
01:38:22,150 --> 01:38:26,020
judgment, or were there others?

2454
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:33,080
>> So...

2455
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:35,190
Will you leave...

2456
01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:38,060
Or shall I?

2457
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:44,040
>> This is your home.

2458
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,090
I will leave.

2459
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:47,230
We will make a simple

2460
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:50,010
announcement.

2461
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:53,000
