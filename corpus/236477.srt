1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:07,030
I'm totally optimistic,
totally pessimistic.

2
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:15,811
I love myself.
I can't stand myself.

3
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:18,976
No!

4
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:22,715
I'm intelligent.
I'm so dumb it scares me.

5
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:31,488
I'm strong.
I'm a weakling.

6
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:40,068
I'm so bored I'm depressed.
I'm so depressed I'm bored.

7
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:50,314
I'm filled with potential,
and I have hostile frustration.

8
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,845
Fucking lie to me!

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,481
My own fluctuations
embarrass me.

10
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,160
But whatever I am...

11
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,166
I was born to two
sixteen-year-old degenerates...

12
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,997
and I am totally flawed.

13
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,867
These are my conflicts.

14
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,236
This is my window.

15
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,400
This is my head.

16
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,635
God is love,
God is love

17
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:23,074
Praise him, praise him,
all ye little children

18
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:29,673
God is love,
God is love

19
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,653
Good morning.

20
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,815
Will?

21
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:42,419
Yes. It's not like that.
Will's a good Christian.

22
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,554
I don't trust him.

23
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,100
I didn't know
you were out here.

24
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,107
Well, I am.

25
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,235
So why don't you
take your zebra stripes...

26
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,973
back into the bedroom?

27
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,285
You're just jealous...

28
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,480
because you haven't dated
anyone in a year.

29
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,150
I would rather
play with myself...

30
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,386
until I got
raw and blistered.

31
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,155
You're disgusting.

32
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,725
Don't ever leave him
in the apartment alone.

33
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,506
She just needs
to get laid.

34
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,062
Where's the salt?

35
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,218
Hello.

36
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,224
Speaking.

37
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,361
The opening's
tomorrow night.

38
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,397
Five to 4:00.

39
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,195
Well, so far,
The Voice is coming.

40
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,365
Art Forum
should be here.

41
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,738
And I spoke to The Times.

42
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,310
Don't worry. These artists
will really move you.

43
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,649
Good.

44
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,112
See you tomorrow night.

45
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,717
What's up
with the canvases?

46
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,058
I just put it on so that...

47
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,894
you know, the dust doesn't
settle on my paintings.

48
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,230
Oh.

49
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,738
Just make sure you don't
forget to take them off.

50
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,002
I'm not inviting people
here to see nothing.

51
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,441
I know.

52
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,281
You're talented, Lilli.

53
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,263
Hello.

54
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:18,702
Hello. Lilli?
This is Grandpa Black.

55
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,901
Are you going to
visit your father bec...

56
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,081
There it is.

57
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,916
What do you think?

58
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,479
It looks nothing like me.

59
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,219
That looks exactly like you.

60
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,490
Now can you give me my money?
Because I've got to go.

61
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:51,189
You gave me water.
I can feel that I'm not high.

62
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,136
I'm looking
in the mirror,

63
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,511
and I can see
I'm not fucking high.

64
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:25,489
Charles... you're
my best friend, right?

65
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:31,026
Tell my fucking wasted wife
she's fucking high, man.

66
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,006
OK.

67
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,045
You're high.

68
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,025
I think I saw you
crossing the street earlier.

69
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,864
Right. I think
I saw you...

70
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,404
watching me cross
the street earlier.

71
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,442
I'm Morrison.

72
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,980
I'm Lilli.

73
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,918
Would you like
to have lunch with me?

74
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,894
No.

75
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,554
Why not?

76
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,065
Well, why not?
Yeah, I'm going to have lunch...

77
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,067
with some guy that
drives around in his car...

78
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,104
trying to pick up girls.
I don't think so.

79
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,607
I don't "pick up girls."

80
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,910
I don't, you know,
believe what people tell me.

81
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,616
Trust can bring
a lot of false hope.

82
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,217
And not trusting at all
can bring a lot of Ioneliness.

83
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,640
So, if we were to go out
for lunch, where would we go?

84
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,613
I have turkey and tuna...

85
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,984
but if you wanted
something else...

86
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,252
we could always stop
and pick it up.

87
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,157
Turkey and tuna.

88
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,630
So, do you normally
conduct business...

89
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,632
and serve sandwiches
out of your car?

90
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,327
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

91
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,176
What are you
so scared of?

92
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,508
Leaving my car,
leaving my apartment.

93
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,345
Germs mostly.

94
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,348
So, how do you go
on the subway?

95
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:08,086
I have never and never will
ever go anywhere near a subway.

96
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,024
You're kidding, right?

97
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,000
OK, I will split
this turkey sandwich with you...

98
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,200
if you get out
of the car.

99
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,336
- Can't leave.
- Why not?

100
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,243
- I don't want to.
- What's the big deal?

101
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,714
You can do it.
Come on.

102
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:36,521
Don't patronize me.
I'm not... totally defective.

103
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,386
Prove it.

104
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,221
Jesus Christ, thank you
for this beautiful day...

105
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,228
with the sun shining.
We have viewed thy grace.

106
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,561
Thank you for this beautiful
church, this place of worship...

107
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,895
and my sisters.

108
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:26,734
God, help us as we're striving
to do your work.

109
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,070
- Amen.
- Amen.

110
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,609
So, what did you
want to talk about?

111
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,741
Sometimes my father
slaps my butt...

112
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,718
and it makes me feel
disgusting.

113
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,755
Sometimes parents
express their affection...

114
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,987
in inappropriate ways.

115
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,265
So, you basically
use germs...

116
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,769
to distance yourself
from the world.

117
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,773
Yeah. What do you use?

118
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,934
Let me guess.

119
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,476
Your personality.

120
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,605
Funny.

121
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,273
Is that a family trait?

122
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,318
No. My family
is very normal.

123
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,516
Where do they live?

124
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,286
Well, let's see.
My father lives in Arizona.

125
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,293
He's dying
of lung cancer.

126
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,295
And my mom lives here
and works and stuff.

127
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,990
You know,
they're very normal.

128
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,337
Yeah. You just said
they were very normal twice.

129
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,166
I'm sorry
about your father.

130
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,836
So is he.

131
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:45,980
Does he do anything else that
makes you feel uncomfortable?

132
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:58,362
I bet your daddy
really loves you.

133
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,871
You're a phony asshole.

134
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:33,696
So... what do you do?

135
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,371
I drive around in my car,
and I watch people...

136
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,407
and I write down what I think
they're thinking about.

137
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,037
And I just had
a book published.

138
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,080
It's called...

139
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,747
"Notes from a Vehicle."

140
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,744
That's great.

141
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,393
I paint. I mean, I'm not,
like, a housepainter.

142
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,395
You know,
I'm doing a show.

143
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,899
Hopefully, the people that come
won't think I suck.

144
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,060
Why would they?

145
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,762
I don't know.

146
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,066
You know, overall,
I'm not impressed with people...

147
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,235
and yet, you know,
I still care what they think.

148
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,108
It's pretty fucking pathetic.

149
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,081
I don't think it matters
how successful you are.

150
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,777
You can always
feel like a failure.

151
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,988
So, are you parents supportive?

152
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,094
Yo, Reg, my brother.
What's up, man?

153
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,598
Come in my house.

154
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,259
What you want, man?
What you want?

155
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,930
I want to see you. I want to
share some time with you.

156
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,201
Come on, man.
Come in.

157
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,639
Have a seat.

158
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,271
Reggie, you're my friend,
you're my neighbor...

159
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,780
and I trust you.

160
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,977
I want an opinion, man.
My little girl's an artist.

161
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:03,351
She is talented.

162
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,255
You really think so, dad?

163
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,658
I sure do, sweetie.
Show Mr. Rich.

164
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,195
That's a girl.

165
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,302
I mean, my dad,
you know...

166
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,634
he would tell me
that he thought I was talented.

167
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,180
Well, that's the way
it should be.

168
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,501
When was the last time
you saw your father?

169
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,003
I don't know.
A year ago.

170
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,165
Don't you think
that's strange?

171
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,334
I think everything is strange.

172
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,506
So... what did your dad say
when he read your book?

173
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,048
I don't know.

174
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,417
Your dad's never
read your book, has he?

175
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,865
You think you ever know...

176
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,459
what's going on
in somebody else's head?

177
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:29,769
I think you feel people.
You get an instinct.

178
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,149
If you want, you could...

179
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,753
Come by the gallery
tomorrow night.

180
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,893
8:30.

181
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,926
No.

182
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,066
I don't really like to be
around a lot of people.

183
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,729
I'm usually alone.

184
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,082
Well, you should probably...

185
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,314
ask your dad if he's
ever read your book.

186
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,922
And thanks for
that turkey sandwich.

187
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,856
I mean, the turkey
was a little dry...

188
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,985
but it was pretty good.

189
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,030
I like talking to you.

190
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,974
I liked talking
to you, too.

191
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,518
Want me to ring up
to your daddy?

192
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:40,265
Yeah, I know.
Don't tell him who it's from.

193
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,541
Thanks.

194
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,873
Your father and I
have orchestra seats...

195
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,880
for Wagner's "Und Isolde"
tomorrow at the Met.

196
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,712
I'm so glad
you came for dinner.

197
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,252
So, are you happy
with the reviews?

198
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,379
I haven't read them.

199
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,047
Our friend Dr. Shapiro
read your book.

200
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,388
He said he thought
you seemed depressed.

201
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,394
I told him my son has always
felt deeply about things...

202
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,556
and if the doctor can only
equate depth with depression...

203
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,623
perhaps he's projecting
and to try to figure out...

204
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,169
what's wrong with him.

205
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,762
You should put
your glasses on.

206
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,573
Anyway, I did tell him
that when you were twelve...

207
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,841
you spent the month
of June in your room...

208
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,906
because you wanted to think.

209
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,509
It was just after
I passed my kidney stone.

210
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,515
You were always a Ionely kid.

211
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,793
I work in Harlem.
What are you doing up here?

212
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,265
Sure, I understand.
It's a secret.

213
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:02,309
So, if I were to go
into a store right now...

214
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,679
and buy a copy
of your book...

215
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,684
how much would you get?

216
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,578
I don't know.

217
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,122
What do you think?

218
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,488
Richard.

219
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,653
Are you working on
a second book?

220
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,825
I just finished this one.

221
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,677
Lilli, you ever felt
so much pain...

222
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,184
that you just wanted to
tear out your insides?

223
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,179
What are the odds that you'll
be able to support kids...

224
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,225
on the income from this one?

225
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,889
I don't have... kids.

226
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,764
What are you saying?

227
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:02,398
Nothing. I'm just saying
that I don't have kids.

228
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,237
I hate my family.

229
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,245
They hate me.

230
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,081
Yeah. Well, family can be
fucked, right?

231
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:28,088
I'd stick my finger
into existence...

232
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,596
And it smells of nothing.

233
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,403
Kierkegaard.

234
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:41,268
That is so funny, because I
stuck my finger up my ass once.

235
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,609
And it smelled like shit.

236
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:54,085
See, I think that you take
yourself a little too serious.

237
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,253
So, if you don't mind...

238
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,127
I'm trying to read.

239
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,462
What are you reading?

240
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,946
Dad... have you ever read...

241
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,948
Like a clock.

242
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,979
He is so... regular.

243
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,477
You know, Lilli...

244
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,950
no one's had a more fucked-up
childhood than me.

245
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,433
Hey, Shorts.

246
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,603
How was school?

247
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,373
Come here.

248
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,381
Come on. Come here.

249
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,440
Mom went out.

250
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:32,052
See, now... I never
even knew my mom.

251
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:39,887
No, she did not even love me
enough to keep me.

252
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,903
She put me up for adoption.

253
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,041
She gave me this.

254
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,339
Pretty, isn't it?
It's a butterfly.

255
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,074
Come here.

256
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:07,084
Promise daddy that you'll
wear this until the day I die.

257
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:15,533
OK? Good.

258
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,933
All right, come here close.
That's a girl.

259
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,442
Let me see.

260
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:37,447
Honey, nobody has had
a fucked-up childhood as I had.

261
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,207
Shit.

262
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,787
No, I have it.

263
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,288
I'll help you.

264
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,951
- I have it.
- I'll help you.

265
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,494
Jesus Christ.

266
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,517
You see, I can be
a gentleman.

267
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,222
I'll be there tomorrow night.

268
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,758
Come by. It'll be fun.

269
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:10,747
You see, I don't really
take myself that serious.

270
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,009
Oh! My...

271
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,573
You fuck!

272
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,029
Excuse me. Did you ever hear
of a book called...

273
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,533
"Notes from a Vehicle?"

274
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,036
Yeah. It's right behind you.

275
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,765
Thanks.

276
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,894
Look, I don't know.

277
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,555
Why don't you try
the computer section upstairs?

278
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,290
Yeah, tomorrow is great.

279
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,626
Bye.

280
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,242
He hasn't called yet.

281
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,774
That's because he's too busy
wandering subway cars.

282
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,946
I just saw him.

283
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,353
He stole my fucking necklace.

284
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,884
Do you believe in God?

285
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,656
No.

286
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:09,132
If you love yourself
and you love thy neighbor...

287
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,828
and you love God...

288
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,804
That's all you need.

289
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,812
A year ago, I tried
to kill myself.

290
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,314
But then I found God.

291
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,647
God is my salvation.

292
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,981
Listen...

293
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,147
your triangle concept...
it's great.

294
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:37,855
But I'm telling you,
he's a fucking psycho.

295
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,159
I'm not skeptical
of everyone, like you.

296
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,062
I trust what people tell me.

297
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:45,193
Maybe that's the problem.

298
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,231
It's OK.

299
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,745
Catherine, put on your pajamas.

300
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,124
New York.

301
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,088
Black, Lilli.

302
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,963
And could I also have
an address with that?

303
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,130
Hi. It's mom.

304
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,298
Hope you're going
to grandma's today...

305
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,307
for Christina's birthday.

306
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,468
I'll pay you back
the money you lent me...

307
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,977
when I get paid.

308
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,173
I promise I'll
pay you back this time.

309
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,383
Hello.

310
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:14,863
Hello, Lilli.
This is Grandpa Black.

311
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,667
Your father has refused
to go to the hospital.

312
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,672
He's refused
intravenous therapies.

313
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,038
He wants to be left alone.

314
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:31,346
Lilli, your father's
going to die.

315
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,815
Has Grandma Black visited him?

316
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,751
No. She won't go.

317
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,552
Why? Because he's adopted?

318
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,593
- What?
- Let me ask you.

319
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,594
Have you visited him at all?

320
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,357
No.

321
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,295
When you and grandma...

322
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,529
decide to pay my father,
your son, a visit...

323
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,537
you should, you know,
definitely give me a call...

324
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,096
because we can make it
a little family outing.

325
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,642
Lilli, please don't...

326
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,309
Lilli?

327
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,414
Cologne? What,
are you having an affair?

328
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,754
Catherine, don't be ridiculous.

329
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,929
How do I look?

330
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,591
You look wonderful.

331
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,100
Must you really go in
on a Saturday?

332
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,763
I have a hundred men working
on a site on Long Island.

333
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,806
I should at least show up.

334
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,181
What are you doing here?

335
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,852
I was thinking about
our conversation.

336
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,654
What about it?

337
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,656
Just that, you know,
you invited me to your show...

338
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,817
and I should have said yes.

339
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,690
You don't have to go.

340
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,530
I want to.

341
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,702
I mean...

342
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,035
Never mind.

343
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,834
No. I...

344
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,004
I want to go.

345
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,547
OK.

346
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,352
I hate this shit.

347
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,048
What shit?

348
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,552
Can I give you
a lift somewhere?

349
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,227
I'm just going to the diner
to get breakfast.

350
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,030
I make a killer omelet.

351
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:45,235
What, do you have a hotplate
in your backseat?

352
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,070
No.

353
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,874
I have a stove
at my apartment.

354
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,248
That sounds a little risky,
don't you think?

355
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,592
Do you promise
you won't attack me?

356
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,757
- I'll try.
- You'll try?

357
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,272
OK.

358
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,626
So, are you excited
about tonight?

359
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,934
I don't know.
Baring my soul to critics.

360
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,940
Let's see...

361
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,772
I think there may be
a few other adjectives...

362
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,311
I'd use to describe it.

363
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:02,953
It's so fucking hard
to become someone, you know.

364
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:07,481
You are someone.

365
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,329
Hi, Will. This is Flora.

366
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,995
You said you were
going to call last night.

367
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,039
Anyway, call me
when you get in.

368
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,527
You know,
when I was younger...

369
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,532
my dad used to sit me down...

370
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,195
he would buy me
a slice of pizza...

371
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,604
and play a Gray Davis song
to help me sort out my brain.

372
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,714
Hi, Will. This is Flora.

373
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,050
I'm going to the coffee shop
on your block...

374
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,556
in case you want
to stop by.

375
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,560
Anyway, I'll call in
to check my messages.

376
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,096
I'm looking forward
to hearing from you.

377
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,791
I knew it... when I met you.

378
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,053
I have to go to the bathroom.

379
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:55,989
OK.

380
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,989
It's around the corner.

381
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:56,846
Yeah, that's nice, sweetie.
That was really good.

382
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,615
So, what do you think, man?

383
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:01,522
That's nice. That's nice.

384
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,686
You OK, man?
You fell asleep.

385
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,526
Dude, I'm sorry, man. Why don't
you go home and get some sleep?

386
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,589
You know what?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

387
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,464
I'll check you tomorrow.

388
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,915
Shorts, come here, baby.
I want to show you something.

389
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,119
Wait right there
for just a second.

390
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,062
Did you really...

391
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,600
Honey, could you get
the cord for daddy, please?

392
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:52,402
I love you, Shorts.

393
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,411
Come on. Let's go.
In the house.

394
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,413
Hurry up.

395
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,745
Get the door for me.
Thank you.

396
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,682
Hurry up.

397
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,159
It looks like we're
going to get high, baby!

398
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:15,198
What you mean "we," paleface?

399
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,934
Jesus, look at my fucking ass.

400
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,268
I didn't see your ass
out there helping me.

401
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,331
Yeah, cold, my ass.

402
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:35,644
How could anyone
as pathetic as you...

403
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,187
with despicable parents
ever become someone?

404
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,596
Are you OK?

405
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,294
Yeah. I'll be right out.

406
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,286
I can't do this.

407
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,824
I definitely can't do this.

408
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,257
I can't do this.

409
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,396
I got to go.

410
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,344
What do you mean, you got to go?
We haven't even eaten yet.

411
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,414
I care about you.

412
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,928
I'm sorry.
I don't feel that way.

413
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,867
Fuck you, Lilli.

414
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,799
Fuck you.

415
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,279
Fuck you, too.

416
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,191
Well, you've certainly
been around a long time.

417
00:49:56,259 --> 00:50:00,992
Long enough to know
what I'm doing.

418
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:04,227
I imagine you could use
an established architect.

419
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,528
The reservations are confirmed.

420
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:11,904
- 8:00.
- Perfect.

421
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:20,313
That... was Robert Kirshenbaum.

422
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:26,886
Well, I appreciate
your introducing me.

423
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,036
- Hello.
- Hi. It's Flora.

424
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,537
Hello, Flora.

425
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,539
I wanted to talk to you.

426
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,336
I'm sorry.

427
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,338
We have a bad connection.

428
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,730
Excuse me.

429
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,104
How old do I look to you?

430
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,575
I don't know.

431
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,547
But don't worry.
I gave you the discount.

432
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,726
Mr. Wiley.

433
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,704
Is this yours?

434
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,240
No.

435
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,197
Hey.

436
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,205
You're forty-five minutes late.

437
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:11,570
Everyone was hungry.

438
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,199
I know. I'm sorry.
I missed my stop.

439
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,937
Hello.

440
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,411
- Hi, grandma.
- Hi, darling.

441
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,981
Hi, mom. Hey, you.

442
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,917
I'm taking karate lessons.

443
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,254
I hope you're not going to
wear that to work.

444
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,486
What's the big deal?

445
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,085
People wear Chinese clothing.
It's in style.

446
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,427
A receptionist
in a surgeon's office...

447
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,262
shouldn't dress like that.

448
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,530
I hope the neighbors
didn't see.

449
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,102
Happy birthday.

450
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,664
Thanks.

451
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,175
So, how are you?

452
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:50,178
- What's that?
- Nothing.

453
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,059
You stopped biting your nails.

454
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:09,030
One day I realized
I just didn't need...

455
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:12,296
to bite them anymore.
Weird, right?

456
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,964
But I could change whoever I am
whenever I want to...

457
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,634
and I can be
whoever I want to be.

458
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,973
You can't be whatever
you want to be.

459
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,706
You know what I mean.

460
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,177
Don't tie up the line.

461
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,651
Your dad still living
in Arizona?

462
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,656
He's doing great.

463
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:38,820
Yeah. He has a new house.
Right, mom?

464
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,659
Sure, he's living
the rich life...

465
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,564
but he don't give you nothing.

466
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:47,330
That's why he was
given up for adoption.

467
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:51,670
A mother can always tell
a bad seed.

468
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,767
Even his adopted mother
hates him.

469
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,244
Grandma, I'm doing OK
on my own.

470
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:58,837
Yeah, right.

471
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,748
Are you dating anyone?

472
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,013
I met a guy, but...

473
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,679
Whatever.
It didn't work out.

474
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,347
So you'll find someone new.

475
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,517
Yeah. Well, maybe
he has a friend.

476
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:14,557
So, what do you
want me to say?

477
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,577
The milk's rotten.

478
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:40,749
Shit. I need the milk
for my coffee.

479
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,918
Hey, get up.
We need some milk.

480
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,998
Charles, come on. Get up.

481
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,232
Charles.

482
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,107
Come on. Get up.

483
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,117
When's daddy coming home?

484
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:21,061
I don't know what to do!

485
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,099
I don't know
what to do! Fuck!

486
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,227
- Christina, eat.
- Why?

487
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,232
Hello.

488
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:36,642
Hello, Lilli.
It's Grandpa Black.

489
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,449
I'm here with your father.

490
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:44,248
The doctors says
it's a matter of hours.

491
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,950
What?

492
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,957
Let me talk to her.

493
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,492
Hold on.

494
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,990
- Shorts?
- Yeah.

495
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,165
Hey, you too good
for your old man?

496
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:05,975
I thought I might see you
and the butterfly.

497
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,135
You still wearing it?

498
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,145
Of course.

499
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,147
Oh! I bought the cookies.

500
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,978
Grandma got a Carvel cake.

501
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,574
Dad...

502
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,484
Lilli...

503
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,290
he can't talk that much.

504
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,853
Sorry.

505
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,929
Have a cookie.

506
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:35,766
I got them from the bakery
at the Pathmark.

507
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:38,363
Pathmark has a good bakery.

508
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,978
These cookies are terrible.

509
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,944
Don't any of you know
what's really going on?

510
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,610
What's she talking about?

511
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,320
I let my mother
talk me into lying.

512
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:02,128
My father's dying of AIDS.

513
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,359
What's she talking about?

514
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,026
I don't know.
She's crazy.

515
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,297
She's always making up
these fucking stories!

516
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:11,238
I'm making up fucking stories?
OK, that's it.

517
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:13,298
What are you doing?

518
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,071
I'm leaving.

519
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,543
I gave birth to her.

520
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,983
What else the fuck
does she want from me?

521
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,753
Hello.

522
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,756
Hello.

523
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,104
Hi. It's Flora.

524
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,936
Please leave a message
after the beep.

525
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,101
Hi, Flora.
This is Lilli.

526
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:24,112
I'm looking for your bipolar
fucking boyfriend.

527
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,308
So if you could give me
a call on my...

528
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,645
Fucking battery.
Fuck you, battery.

529
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,615
There you are.

530
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:53,161
We have to leave now.
We'll be late.

531
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,501
I'm not going.

532
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:03,971
What?

533
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,142
Catherine...

534
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,980
I haven't worked in months.

535
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,491
I got laid off.

536
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,294
I'm too old.

537
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,830
Nobody wants me.

538
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:39,531
I was wondering when you'd have
the courage to tell me.

539
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,772
What do you want me
to say, Richard?

540
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:44,472
There's nothing
more nauseating...

541
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,983
than watching a man
being swallowed by his pride.

542
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,486
Life could be really bad.
You could have cancer.

543
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:56,856
Now get your fucking binoculars.
We're going to the opera.

544
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,283
Reefer?

545
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,289
No. Pot makes me paranoid.

546
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:11,952
Can I have a slice...

547
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,292
that I can really smell?

548
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:16,627
They call this a good weed.

549
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,633
It doesn't make you
feel paranoid.

550
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,635
It makes you feel good.

551
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:57,835
Do you know which way
the Pit Bar is?

552
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:01,001
Next block, on your right,
black door.

553
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,045
Do you know what kind
of place it is?

554
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:05,080
A bar.

555
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:20,058
Do you think that I
could use your phone?

556
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,398
OK.

557
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:38,473
Hello.

558
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:42,914
Hello.

559
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,047
Hello.

560
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,254
I'm sorry that I couldn't
be honest with you.

561
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,857
I'm sorry that I'm a liar.

562
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:00,060
Lilli...

563
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,401
Because you're
a really great person...

564
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:06,066
and I was lucky to meet you.

565
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:11,640
I didn't mean what I said.

566
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:17,483
I wanted to kiss you again,
but I threw up in your bathroom.

567
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:21,289
And I thought you would think
that my breath stunk.

568
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,423
I don't care
if your breath stinks.

569
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:30,954
I'm sorry that your father
never read your book.

570
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,935
Because I did.

571
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,804
And it's really inspiring,
and you're really talented.

572
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:44,139
Where are you?

573
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:54,186
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

574
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,697
Excuse me.

575
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,363
Does a guy named Will work here?

576
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,700
What?

577
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,207
A guy named Will.
Does a guy named Will work here?

578
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,210
Yeah. He's around.

579
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,711
Hello, Lilli.

580
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,475
You just scared
the shit out of me.

581
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:29,039
Excuse me. Do you think
I could have my necklace back?

582
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,710
Is that what you came here for?

583
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,219
Yeah. My father gave it to me.

584
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,721
Do you think
you could give it back?

585
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,257
Yeah, sure.
It's in my room.

586
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,728
Well, can you bring it here?

587
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,239
You fuck.

588
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:28,868
Listen, I'll pay you
for the fucking necklace, OK?

589
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:31,606
You like the way I look?

590
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,282
Where you going?

591
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,119
Sit!

592
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,561
This is your daddy's?

593
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:58,767
I said, do you like
the way I look?

594
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:00,536
Yes.

595
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:03,840
Why the fuck would you
want to play with yourself

596
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:06,972
until you got raw and blistered
than to be with me?

597
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,145
I was kidding.

598
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:20,320
You think I'm stupid,
don't you?

599
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,863
No.

600
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:30,931
Don't you fucking lie to me!
Don't fucking lie to me!

601
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,474
Funny, huh? Stuck my finger
in my ass once...

602
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:36,773
and it smelled like shit!
Right? Huh? Right?

603
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:39,370
I don't think you're stupid.
I don't think you're stupid.

604
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,356
Touch me.
Here, touch me.

605
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,760
You want me to fuck you?

606
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:57,060
- I'd do that for you.
- No.

607
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:59,760
I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not going to hurt you.

608
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:02,599
You know, when you come about...

609
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:05,504
it's the purest form
of yourself, Lilli.

610
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:08,805
You even lie to yourself about
what you get off on, Lilli.

611
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:10,868
No! No! No!

612
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:14,040
I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not going to hurt you.

613
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,050
I'm not going to hurt you.

614
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,881
I'm not going to
fucking hurt you.

615
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:20,888
Put your fucking hands down.

616
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:28,562
Relax.

617
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,098
Let go of my fucking hands.

618
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:49,008
You shouldn't have
done that, Lilli.

619
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,530
Hi.

620
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:07,893
Are you Gapu?

621
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,598
Yeah.

622
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:18,573
We spoke on the phone.

623
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,348
Oh. About the girl?

624
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:26,353
Yeah. Did you see
which way she went?

625
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,125
No idea.

626
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:38,296
Fucking dog! This fucking bitch
is more important!

627
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,188
Sorry.

628
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,288
- Thanks.
- Reefer?

629
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,658
We didn't have to leave.

630
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:16,033
You and Wagner...
It was a little too depressing.

631
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:25,774
Lilli.

632
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:27,872
What are you doing here?

633
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,247
What's going on?

634
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:34,278
No. No, you can't be here.
Get back in your car.

635
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:36,950
You don't know
where I'm from.

636
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,956
I don't give a shit
about where you're from.

637
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:44,362
I'm scared for you to see
who I am, too.

638
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:51,069
Can we just... talk?

639
01:16:57,512 --> 01:17:00,242
My dad's not dying of cancer.

640
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,648
He's dying of AIDS.

641
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:23,429
Fuck!

642
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:42,369
Hello.

643
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,378
Come in.

644
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,762
Are you Lilli?

645
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:03,761
Yeah.

646
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:09,066
He's not going to be able
to eat that pizza.

647
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:13,240
Yeah, I know. I just...

648
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,742
I thought
he might like the smell.

649
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:26,476
He asked me to give this to you.

650
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:31,288
Thank you.

651
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:45,237
Did you get the tux?

652
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:55,543
For my show.

653
01:20:57,752 --> 01:20:59,413
What tux?

654
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:53,541
What's wrong?
Tell me what's wrong.

655
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:58,512
Just the pain.

656
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:01,879
It's just the pain.

657
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,682
When I was a kid...

658
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,688
it was all mental.

659
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:13,861
Now it's all physical.

660
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:27,241
Where are the flowers?

661
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:34,670
Don't fence the lillies.

662
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:48,323
I'm sorry, Shorts.

663
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,168
I'm sorry.

664
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:08,112
I'm glad you came to see me.

665
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:13,921
Me, too.

666
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,051
Me, too.

667
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,239
Hello.

668
01:24:11,312 --> 01:24:14,440
Hi, mom.
Can I talk to dad?

669
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,520
Hello.

670
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:21,817
We're about to eat.

671
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,619
Dad...

672
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:27,122
Dad...

673
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,130
Did you ever read my book?

674
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:34,168
I'm sorry.
I haven't had the time.

675
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:37,602
I'll try to read it
this weekend.

676
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:42,138
You just don't get it, do you?

677
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,638
That's OK.

678
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,790
You read his book.

679
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:38,799
You just can't tell him,
can you?

680
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:43,031
Competing with your son.

681
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:38,817
Hey.

682
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:47,159
What are you doing out here?

683
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:53,528
I can't believe
that you came...

684
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:56,161
and you're wearing a blazer.

685
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:00,198
And you shaved.

686
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:07,173
I was such an asshole earlier.

687
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,663
I'm going to go inside.

688
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:27,394
What? You can't go in there.

689
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:29,402
Look at all those people.

690
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,566
Well, what are you going to do,
sit out here all night long?

691
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:41,644
Lilli, if they didn't
like your paintings...

692
01:28:41,716 --> 01:28:45,083
why would they put you
in the show?

693
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:47,621
Why?

694
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,751
Because the curator
doesn't have a fucking clue.

695
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:53,919
Or you know what?
Maybe he does have a clue...

696
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:56,088
but when he was picking out
the paintings...

697
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:58,257
he was, like, sick that night
and not paying attention.

698
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,766
Or they're using my work...

699
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:01,768
to make somebody else's work
look better...

700
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:03,303
like a conspiracy.

701
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:07,932
You know, you should really
keep those thoughts to yourself.

702
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:10,637
You're starting
to make me look confident.

703
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:29,823
Are you going to... come inside?

704
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:44,003
Wait. Will you just wait here?

705
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:51,744
Lilli Black...

706
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:57,049
I'd like you to meet Anne Friar
from The New York Times.

707
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:59,552
Congratulations.

708
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:02,680
Thank you very much.

709
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:04,384
I thought you might
like to tell her...

710
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,723
a little bit
about your paintings.

711
01:31:06,794 --> 01:31:08,921
I'm sorry.
Could you excuse me?

712
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:13,400
It was very nice meeting you.

713
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:37,113
You did it.

714
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:41,625
Thank you.

715
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,132
You know,
I've spent my life...

716
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:52,263
trying not to feel...

717
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:56,470
stuffing everything
deeper and deeper inside...

718
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:00,814
Pretending.

719
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:06,616
Pretending about what?

720
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:08,746
That I feel fine...

721
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:11,951
That I'm OK.

722
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:15,325
You know, coming here,
pretending that...

723
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:19,992
That I'm OK
that my father just died.

724
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,819
I'm sorry...

725
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:45,324
about your father.

726
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:51,025
Just don't pretend
that you're not capable...

727
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,035
Because you are.

728
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,536
Maybe your parents weren't.

729
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,377
Do you know that I knew it?

730
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:16,549
I knew it when I met you.

731
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:26,764
I know.

732
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:55,387
Hi, Will. It's Flora.

733
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:59,399
I want to talk to you, so...

734
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:03,062
I'll just get the address
and stop by the bar.

735
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:06,573
OK? I'll see you soon.

736
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:08,108
Bye.
