1
00:00:56,768 --> 00:01:00,647
<i>- I'm really in here, not you.
<i>- It's my turn.

2
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:21,293
<i>Mom? Mom?

3
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:47,361
<i>What I remember most from before</i>
<i>was people's voices.</i>

4
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:52,783
<i>Kind of floating on the wind.</i>

5
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:56,787
<i>And laughing.</i>

6
00:01:58,914 --> 00:02:01,917
<i>Like everybody was in on something.</i>

7
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:07,881
<i>Like it all mattered somehow.</i>

8
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:23,981
<i>I know what I did.</i>

9
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:28,402
<i>And I don't want forgiveness,</i>
<i>from you or anybody else.</i>

10
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:33,031
<i>I don't deserve it, and with respect,</i>
<i>I'm happy here.</i>

11
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:38,245
<i>- Happy?</i>
<i>- Well, I mean, I think it's right.</i>

12
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:39,997
<i>I think I belong here.</i>

13
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:43,542
I find it interesting that you think
that you should determine...

14
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,878
...where you belong.

15
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:50,924
Now, you've spent 21 years, six
months here at Atborough.

16
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:56,305
And prior to that, one year, five
months at Wentworth Juvenile Facility.

17
00:02:56,513 --> 00:03:02,269
Yes, sir, that's correct, and I expect
to remain here as sentenced.

18
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:06,773
I'm afraid you don't
exactly have that choice.

19
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,861
The Board of Review is aware
of your record here...

20
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:14,781
...and is prepared to commute your
sentence from life to time served.

21
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:22,206
There are those who might feel that
congratulations are in order here.

22
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:24,917
So congratulations.

23
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,461
You're a free man.

24
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,202
Sorry.

25
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:06,226
Shit. Hey, hey, you.
Yeah, you. Hold up.

26
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:10,105
Wentworth. You was at Wentworth,
weren't you?

27
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,357
- Back in the day.
- Yeah.

28
00:05:12,524 --> 00:05:17,196
Damn, man, what's up, brother?
I thought you were gone for good.

29
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:21,241
Yeah. Well, they...
I guess they fixed it.

30
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,495
I'm sorry, man, I forgot your name.

31
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:26,413
- What's your name?
- Jordan.

32
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,540
Jordan! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bryan, right?

33
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:31,043
- Manuel.
- Oh, Manuel, all right.

34
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:32,920
Manuel Jordan. Yeah, yeah.

35
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:35,130
- Mackie Whittaker.
- I remember you.

36
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,507
How you doing, man?

37
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:40,010
I didn't think nobody was gonna be
seeing you again, man.

38
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:43,013
- Shit. Fuck.
- Well...

39
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,141
Hell, anyway.
Hey, welcome back, man.

40
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,268
- Well, thanks.
- All right, man.

41
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:49,603
- Okay.
- Wentworth.

42
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:53,106
- All right. Okay. I'll see you round.
- Yeah, all right, man.

43
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:55,025
Thanks. Yeah.

44
00:05:56,693 --> 00:06:00,197
Yeah, we was at Wentworth together,
man. Me and him.

45
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:02,199
Wasn't nothing but kids.

46
00:06:43,323 --> 00:06:46,994
<i>I read a book that was written</i>
<i>in the 11 th century.</i>

47
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:50,998
<i>Man said there was five steps</i>
<i>toward making amends.</i>

48
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,670
<i>The first involved</i>
<i>acknowledging what you did.</i>

49
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,631
<i>The second involved remorse.</i>

50
00:07:00,716 --> 00:07:03,552
<i>The third involved making right</i>
<i>with your neighbor.</i>

51
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,098
<i>Like if you stole his chicken, you'd</i>
<i>have to go and bring him another.</i>

52
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:11,727
<i>Only then were you able</i>
<i>to go to step four...</i>

53
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:14,771
<i>... which was making it right with God.</i>

54
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:21,403
<i>But it wasn't until step five</i>
<i>that you could really get redeemed.</i>

55
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:26,617
<i>It had to do with being in the same</i>
<i>place, in the same situation.</i>

56
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:31,830
<i>That as it goes, you'd go</i>
<i>and do something different.</i>

57
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,753
<i>Only I can't bring Abner Easely back</i>
<i>like he was some stolen chicken.</i>

58
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:42,132
<i>Certainly made sure of that</i>
<i>23 years ago.</i>

59
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:46,720
<i>And I don't believe in some God that's</i>
<i>gonna open his arms to me...</i>

60
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:49,056
<i>... even if I did.</i>

61
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:52,726
<i>So there goes steps three and four.</i>

62
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:55,729
<i>And as for step five...</i>

63
00:07:57,147 --> 00:07:59,858
<i>... time makes sure we're never</i>
<i>in the same place twice...</i>

64
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,486
<i>... no matter how much we wish it.</i>

65
00:08:04,363 --> 00:08:09,409
<i>Which is why, for me,</i>
<i>I know I'll never be redeemed.</i>

66
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:26,426
Manuel.

67
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:29,346
Manuel.

68
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:31,682
- Manuel!
- Manuel!

69
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,100
- Hey!
- Manuel!

70
00:08:33,183 --> 00:08:34,309
- Hey!
- Manuel!

71
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:39,231
Hey, man. Mackie Whittaker, man.
How you doing?

72
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:41,859
Remember Earl Whitmore?
He know you from Atborough.

73
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:43,902
- Yeah.
- Me and Whitmore and Dukie...

74
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:47,573
...got this ride in Claridge. We
need a sideman to run with Dukie...

75
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:51,326
...because he too fat. It's like
running with a couch. You know?

76
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:54,329
- I don't want anything to do with it.
- It's a liquor store.

77
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:57,416
They do cash only. The dude's
making his run in 20 minutes.

78
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:01,503
- I'm really not interested, okay?
- But you perfect for it, man.

79
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:05,340
You just fresh out, you know? It's like
a sign or something, you know?

80
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,802
And it's 8, 900 dollars each.
You know what I'm saying?

81
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:12,139
I'm not perfect for it.
I don't want anything to do with it.

82
00:09:12,347 --> 00:09:14,641
Look. You gotta now.
You're with the people now.

83
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:17,352
- I don't want anything to do with it.
- All right.

84
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,148
I remember you now. Yeah. Yeah.
You that wimpy-ass...

85
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:23,442
...crybaby motherfucker
from Wentworth.

86
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:27,529
Yeah, I remember now, man. Earl
told me about you at Atborough too.

87
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:31,200
He said you never did fight back.
He said you'd make a good sideman...

88
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,244
...because you rather take a bullet
than make a noise.

89
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:37,372
- You can do this. Listen.
- I don't have a problem with you.

90
00:09:37,581 --> 00:09:39,458
- Let me go.
- You come to my neighborhood...

91
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,169
Leave me alone.
Why don't you mind your business.

92
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:44,171
I'm gonna fuck you up, now!

93
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,599
You got a death wish or something,
man?

94
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:59,269
What's your fucking problem?

95
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:04,691
Hey, I just saved your life, man!

96
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,528
I could have sliced
your motherfucking throat!

97
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:11,740
Well, fuck you, man!

98
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:15,285
You show your face here again,
you be dead, motherfucker!

99
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:17,704
Where you going?

100
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:20,958
<i>- All right? Yeah.</i>
<i>- Fuck, man.</i>

101
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,459
Where you going?

102
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:24,586
<i>- Oh, fuck.</i>
<i>- Let's get out of here.</i>

103
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:27,965
<i>- Come on, let's go!</i>
<i>- What the fuck? Just leave it.</i>

104
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:32,344
<i>- Frank.</i>
<i>- Come on, let it go!</i>

105
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:35,514
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

106
00:11:01,498 --> 00:11:04,376
- Hello?
<i>- Where the hell you been?</i>

107
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:07,337
- I'm sorry?
<i>- Deal's a deal.</i>

108
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:10,382
<i>We had an agreement, right?</i>
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

109
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:14,845
<i>You don't have to pay to park, but you</i>
<i>have to sit because that's the rules.</i>

110
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:21,310
<i>- No, man. I don't wanna do that.</i>
<i>- Fine, fine. Suit yourself...</i>

111
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:47,044
<i>Where's Duwayne?</i>

112
00:11:47,836 --> 00:11:49,797
This is a pay phone.

113
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:54,510
<i>Turn around. Those apartment</i>
<i>buildings over there behind you...</i>

114
00:11:54,718 --> 00:11:58,806
<i>... O livia May Projects. Nobody</i>
<i>outside there called Duwayne?</i>

115
00:12:00,557 --> 00:12:02,684
Nobody anywhere.

116
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:06,480
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>
<i>All right, thanks.</i>

117
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:27,000
<i>Who is this?</i>

118
00:12:29,461 --> 00:12:32,381
<i>- You there?</i>
- Yeah.

119
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:35,092
<i>All right, let me ask you a question.</i>

120
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:39,429
<i>- Where you headed?</i>
- I'm not sure.

121
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:05,414
Hey! Hey, you!

122
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:08,542
- You Manuel Jordan?
- Yeah.

123
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:10,669
I'm Miles Evans.

124
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:21,054
You know the rules.
Take it back inside. Now. Go.

125
00:13:22,514 --> 00:13:27,102
You're with me.
Deal's a deal. Right?

126
00:13:27,978 --> 00:13:30,147
They wanna use my lot,
they know the drill.

127
00:13:30,898 --> 00:13:34,985
Park over there. In exchange,
spend 15 minutes in here.

128
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:38,530
Don't have to listen,
don't have to give a shit.

129
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:41,617
- Just have to sit.
- Listen to what?

130
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:45,871
Me. Small enough price to pay
for keeping Daddy's car safe...

131
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:49,958
...in the big bad neighborhood, right?
Inside, inside. Come on, come on.

132
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,461
You'll get to your nightclub
soon enough. Here.

133
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:58,801
Here! Don't take no shit.
Fifteen minutes, no exceptions.

134
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:02,137
We'll talk about pay
when things get quieter.

135
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:05,724
All right, everybody,
we're back on the clock.

136
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:28,539
Excuse me. He gave me
this clipboard here and...

137
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:35,921
- You work here?
- I look to keys.

138
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:38,841
- Yeah.
- My name is Señor Aguilar.

139
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:41,635
My name is Manuel Jordan.
So this guy gives me...

140
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:45,806
Duwayne is very, very bad.
Two times no show.

141
00:14:46,223 --> 00:14:50,811
- Well, I don't really know Duwayne.
- Señor Miles is very mad.

142
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:53,522
So anyway,
the guy gave me this clipboard.

143
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,859
I guess I stand here or something.

144
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:59,945
If they park here,
they have to sign that.

145
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:05,868
Hey, señor! Come on. So, what's
the old guy blabbing about tonight?

146
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:08,120
I really wouldn't have a clue.

147
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:13,876
Worse than goddamn Sunday school.
Here you go, God Boy.

148
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:16,295
All right, buddy.

149
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:22,593
Thrashing around like fish in a bucket.
But what kind of dancing is that?

150
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:27,806
David danced.
David in Second Samuel.

151
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:30,517
Chapter 6, Verse 14:

152
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:33,937
And David danced
before the Lord with all of his might.

153
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:37,858
"All of his might." Wow.

154
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:45,991
Hey. Oh, you're a new God Boy.
Hi, there, new God Boy.

155
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:50,537
- Here, you want some?
- No, thanks.

156
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:53,624
Oh, God Boy's a good boy.
Where's Duwayne?

157
00:15:54,166 --> 00:16:00,339
- I don't know Duwayne.
- I think Duwayne is burning in hell.

158
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:03,675
Somebody might hear you laughing.

159
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,935
They say that the tree that God
told Adam and Eve not to eat of...

160
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:14,853
...was the tree of knowledge.

161
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,025
In other words,
some things you shouldn't know.

162
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,115
But they ate. And you remember
what happened after that?

163
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,914
Adam and Eve saw that they
were naked and took fig leaves...

164
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:39,670
...and tried to hide
from each other and from God.

165
00:16:41,296 --> 00:16:46,885
Now, you think God doesn't know
where you are?

166
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:50,013
Know, physically?

167
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,768
But God wants to know,
where are you in your sins?

168
00:16:54,935 --> 00:16:58,814
In your recognition of your sins.

169
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:02,025
Now, he knows the answer.

170
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:06,363
He knows the answer because...

171
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:10,868
...hey, he's God.

172
00:17:12,077 --> 00:17:15,956
And God knows
that you know the answer too.

173
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:18,041
- And you do.
- Let's go.

174
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,920
- Don't you? Oh, yes.
- Oh, yes.

175
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:24,882
Oh, yes.

176
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,260
Oh, yes.

177
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:34,349
You know exactly,
exactly where you...

178
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,461
Kids. Kids.

179
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:03,796
Kids. Kids.

180
00:18:04,713 --> 00:18:06,340
Come with me.

181
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:12,304
Club goes four nights a week.
I'll need you midnight till about 6.

182
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:16,975
Or until the last of the little lambs
staggers out into the sunlight.

183
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:22,981
For pay, I got a room
at 100 dollars a month...

184
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,069
...which you can work down to nothing
if you'll help with cleaning.

185
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:31,114
What makes you think I need a room?

186
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,076
God told me.

187
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:42,084
You're carrying your damn suitcase,
man.

188
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,046
You think God talks to me?

189
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:50,342
We argue maybe,
but he don't participate.

190
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:55,806
It's all right.
I'll see him one day.

191
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:57,766
When I do...

192
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:01,979
...I'm gonna whip his holy ass.

193
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:09,862
- Why are you here?
- You called me.

194
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:15,284
I called Duwayne. I mean,
why are you here, in this city?

195
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:19,079
- I don't know.
- Payback?

196
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:21,957
- No.
- Apology?

197
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,294
I know you're supposed to be
a preacher or something...

198
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:27,796
...but where I been...
- Prison.

199
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,009
Well, it's obvious you ain't been
on tour with the Ice Capades.

200
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:35,012
It's a show.

201
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:37,181
Ice...

202
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:42,060
- Never mind.
- I've talked to preachers.

203
00:19:42,227 --> 00:19:47,191
I've talked to nuns,
and I've read some things.

204
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:51,820
I just... I don't know.
With respect, I just don't buy it.

205
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:56,033
So if I'm gonna have to believe
in something to get a bowl of soup...

206
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:58,368
...I'm not...
That's really not my bag.

207
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:01,580
I don't need you to believe.
I just need you to clean.

208
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:06,001
Señor Aguilar will show you
the supplies. Here are the keys.

209
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:10,255
Stay till the last car.
I'm going to bed.

210
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:13,050
I gotta make soup for 100
in three hours.

211
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,181
You know, you could get lucky.

212
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:22,351
God might decide to grade you
on the curve.

213
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,103
It wouldn't matter either way.

214
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:32,402
You don't know what the hell
you talking about, do you?

215
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:36,031
Why be afraid of a God
you don't believe in?

216
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:40,577
Oh, I know it seems like people
are making up shit...

217
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:45,123
...so they can feel good
about all the pain, all the cruelty...

218
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,626
...Ioss, violence, suffering, death.

219
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:52,297
Famine, bigotry, small-mindedness,
repression, depression, oppression.

220
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:55,467
Want me to keep talking?
I can go on forever with this shit.

221
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:59,388
- No, I get the point.
- The point is:

222
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,933
I believe in the lie.

223
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:08,063
Never underestimate its power.

224
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:11,150
Now, as for me, well...

225
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:16,155
...I'm lying through my teeth.

226
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:21,535
I'll see you soon.

227
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:52,107
- Hi.
- Hey.

228
00:21:52,274 --> 00:21:54,943
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

229
00:21:56,695 --> 00:22:01,617
Every night, the same thing.
Music, some smoke.

230
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:03,619
I don't know.

231
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:10,000
But to his room, nobody go inside.

232
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:53,020
Jeez.

233
00:23:53,228 --> 00:23:54,605
Oh, man.

234
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:58,317
Dude, I need waffles.

235
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:04,698
Hey, tell Paul I'm gonna
be a little late.

236
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:07,784
- Your keys, miss.
- Well, I was working all night.

237
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:12,498
I was working very hard, actually,
and getting it all together.

238
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:15,417
If you want me to,
I can take care of the last one.

239
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:19,087
- My job. Zero keys.
- All right.

240
00:24:19,254 --> 00:24:23,467
Excuse me, sorry. You're
with the community house, right?

241
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:27,221
Yeah.

242
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,600
- So you're the new guy, huh?
- Yeah, I guess.

243
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:34,144
What's up with that guy?
Preacher guy?

244
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:36,730
Oh, I wouldn't have any idea.

245
00:24:37,147 --> 00:24:41,276
I'm sorry to hassle you with this, bro.
It's just, she's usually up by now.

246
00:24:41,443 --> 00:24:45,697
I gotta get the hell out of here. Can't
wait around all day for her, you know?

247
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:50,869
These rich kids, man,
they come from the suburbs.

248
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,374
I don't know why they bother when
they spend half the time unconscious.

249
00:24:56,834 --> 00:25:02,297
Here we go. Sofia Mellinger,
55 lvy Grove Terrace.

250
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:21,191
Many nights like this.
One night, ambulance.

251
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:24,194
She very bad girl.

252
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:42,880
Come on. Get out.

253
00:25:44,173 --> 00:25:46,216
All right, all right.

254
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:50,679
Here.

255
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:57,519
- Go home.
- Yeah, yeah.

256
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:04,401
- Are you sure we didn't...?
- Go home and go to sleep.

257
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,904
Yeah.

258
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,869
Hey. You know who lives here?

259
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:18,207
Claire Mellinger.
You know, lady singer?

260
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:21,293
Had that song a while ago.

261
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:27,508
She's not as good as me, eh?

262
00:26:39,603 --> 00:26:41,605
All right. All right. All right.

263
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:54,827
- Jump ball!
- Jump ball?

264
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:56,954
- He reached around me!
- Pipe down, Don.

265
00:26:57,329 --> 00:27:00,290
You're so full of shit
you're clogging up the whole city!

266
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:03,794
Sadiki, I got reaching in on you.
I got pushing off on Ty.

267
00:27:03,961 --> 00:27:05,921
And I got team T's on all of you.

268
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:08,966
- Jump ball!
- Jump the ball.

269
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:11,385
Get the ball.

270
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:15,639
Get the ball, man.
Bring the ball.

271
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:25,584
Thank you so much.

272
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:32,925
I could help you carry your bags.

273
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:40,557
Excuse me. I could help you
carry those bags if you like.

274
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:44,853
- You want to carry my bags?
- Yes, ma'am.

275
00:28:45,646 --> 00:28:48,023
- Do I know you?
- No, ma'am.

276
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,069
- Then why you wanna carry my bags?
- I'd just like to help.

277
00:28:52,402 --> 00:28:55,364
- Just like to help?
- Yes, ma'am.

278
00:28:58,492 --> 00:29:00,494
I don't know you?

279
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:03,539
We've never spoken, no.

280
00:29:03,705 --> 00:29:06,041
So, what, you've been
following me around?

281
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:11,130
I sensed someone following me.
Was that you?

282
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:15,092
- Yes, ma'am.
- I think it's best then maybe not.

283
00:29:15,676 --> 00:29:18,637
- But thank you anyway.
- I just like to help, that's all.

284
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:19,972
- I'll get...
- Excuse me.

285
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:43,162
Hey! What the hell
you think you're doing?

286
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:45,664
No seconds till
everybody's had firsts.

287
00:29:45,831 --> 00:29:48,792
Get your scruffy ass
to the back of the line.

288
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:52,045
Manuel?

289
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:56,383
Hey! Manuel.

290
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,844
Get up here.
Make yourself useful.

291
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,853
I need to get some more soup.

292
00:30:10,147 --> 00:30:13,692
Give them one ladle,
one slice of bread.

293
00:30:19,198 --> 00:30:21,992
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

294
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:24,661
Now, how many of you think
that that means...

295
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,499
...the Lord is shepherding you
through life, answering your prayers?

296
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:34,671
Anything you ask for? How many?
Sit down, Charlie. I'm not done yet.

297
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:56,068
Yo, man, that's whack.

298
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:01,031
- Our new neighbor.
- Fools ain't right.

299
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,702
- Another damn liquor store.
- Where are we gonna play, man?

300
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:11,250
I don't know who I'm madder at,
the people who sell it or who drink it.

301
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:16,046
What about you? What about that shit
floating out your window at night?

302
00:31:20,843 --> 00:31:24,930
- It just helps me forget.
- Forget what?

303
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:30,269
Damn, you know, I don't remember.
See? It's working.

304
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,691
Come on.
You walked right into it.

305
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:42,072
Sometimes, you know,
you have to transgress a little bit...

306
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:44,241
...to help the greater good.

307
00:31:44,616 --> 00:31:47,286
You gonna lean on that lettuce
or help me get it inside?

308
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:08,765
<i>You gotta ask yourself something.</i>

309
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:14,271
Are you dancing toward
something or away from something?

310
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:19,610
In other words, are you dancing for
pleasure, or you dancing for joy?

311
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:25,240
Now, if you dancing for
pleasure, why, I can't help you.

312
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:28,285
But if you dancing for joy...

313
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,956
...then you gotta pull your head
out of your ass and look around you...

314
00:32:33,123 --> 00:32:36,794
...at the rest of the world
and the people in it.

315
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:40,088
Because if you wanna help yourself...

316
00:32:40,297 --> 00:32:41,965
...try helping somebody else.

317
00:32:42,382 --> 00:32:45,302
- She's the oldest, then?
- Yeah, that's Maria.

318
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:47,304
- She's how old?
- Pardon me?

319
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,307
- She's how old?
- She's 27.

320
00:32:51,183 --> 00:32:56,772
You smell good.
You smell like Indian take-out.

321
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,902
You smell like chutney.
I'm telling you, you do!

322
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:04,112
- You smell like...
- Miss, your keys.

323
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:07,658
Hey! It's God Boy.

324
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:10,744
- This is Dick, and that's Duwayne.
- Hi.

325
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:13,997
- You forgot your keys.
- Duwayne will watch them.

326
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:16,124
He's a very responsible man.

327
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,909
You again.

328
00:33:51,326 --> 00:33:54,997
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- You've been following me?

329
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:59,001
- No, ma'am. Waiting for you.
- Much better.

330
00:33:59,168 --> 00:34:01,837
- I don't mean it that way.
- I know what you meant.

331
00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:05,966
Honestly, I have no intentions
of harming you at all.

332
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:09,887
- Could we have a conversation?
- A conversation?

333
00:34:10,095 --> 00:34:12,890
Yes, ma'am. I brought you this.

334
00:34:14,266 --> 00:34:16,852
Now, how am I gonna
be able to carry a rose?

335
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:20,022
Maybe if I help carry the bags,
then you can carry the rose.

336
00:34:34,286 --> 00:34:36,705
Thanks again,
and thank you for the rose.

337
00:34:37,414 --> 00:34:39,791
You're welcome.

338
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:42,294
You're making me nervous now.

339
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:46,673
Oh, I'm sorry. If you prefer,
I could give you these two bags...

340
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,052
...and I could watch over
the others until you return.

341
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,722
- I need you to speak more formally.
- I'm sorry?

342
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:56,183
I'm joking.

343
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:01,438
So I'll be right here.

344
00:35:01,814 --> 00:35:03,065
Okay.

345
00:35:27,464 --> 00:35:29,925
Okay.

346
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:34,138
Take one at a time, and I'll
wait here. They're very heavy.

347
00:35:34,346 --> 00:35:38,183
Okay, sure. Well, come on.

348
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,477
- Come on?
- Come on, if you're coming.

349
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:43,230
Well, yes, ma'am.

350
00:35:56,326 --> 00:36:00,956
- You have a big family?
- No. This is for the people I cook for.

351
00:36:01,123 --> 00:36:05,878
I cook for families on the East Side.
Do cleaning, whatever they need.

352
00:36:07,546 --> 00:36:12,301
I'm a custodian now
at a community house uptown.

353
00:36:13,093 --> 00:36:15,762
- That what you wanted to tell me?
- I'm sorry?

354
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:19,141
You said you wanted
to have a conversation.

355
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:23,228
Oh, no. Yeah, well, I did.

356
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,531
Listen, I sort of need to get to work.

357
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:47,503
My brother...

358
00:36:49,046 --> 00:36:50,297
He's a statistic.

359
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:54,426
- I'm sorry.
- I know. Everybody is.

360
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:02,392
- Who's this?
- He's helping with the groceries.

361
00:37:04,061 --> 00:37:08,023
- Looks like they're all in.
- Abner, I'm fine. He's a nice man.

362
00:37:08,232 --> 00:37:10,484
Whatever, Mom.

363
00:37:12,444 --> 00:37:14,321
He's just being protective.

364
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:18,283
- You said his name is Abner?
- Yeah.

365
00:37:19,117 --> 00:37:20,953
Forgot something.

366
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,581
Oh, much better, the hat. Much!

367
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:29,962
He is one pissed off little fuck.
Gets it from me, I swear.

368
00:37:30,129 --> 00:37:33,298
- You seem okay.
- Oh, you don't know me.

369
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:40,931
I lost track. Did we have our
conversation or not?

370
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:45,227
Not really.

371
00:37:47,646 --> 00:37:52,276
Was this conversation about asking
me out? Because I'll be honest.

372
00:37:52,484 --> 00:37:56,113
Over the years,
I have lowered my standards.

373
00:37:58,657 --> 00:38:02,578
Nobody accused you of having an
overly acute sense of humor, did they?

374
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:06,248
- Me?
- My point exactly.

375
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:09,960
Yeah.

376
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:15,090
No, I'm not commonly
described as being funny.

377
00:38:16,675 --> 00:38:21,305
But it'd be great if we went
out and got something to eat...

378
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:27,394
...if you don't mind. It'd be nice,
and we, you know, we could talk.

379
00:38:27,561 --> 00:38:31,315
- Like we're doing right now.
- Sure.

380
00:38:31,482 --> 00:38:34,109
- But, maybe, you know...
- Faster.

381
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:39,364
- Okay. I'll try.
- Well, you know where I live.

382
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:43,535
Next time you come, I'll have you
lifting furniture, maybe fixing shutters.

383
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:48,332
- That's okay.
- Anyhow, thank you for the rose.

384
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,002
- You're welcome.
- Maybe I'll see you again.

385
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:55,339
Yes, ma'am. That would be great.

386
00:38:58,592 --> 00:39:01,136
- So maybe...
- Bye.

387
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:03,514
...we'll do that.

388
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:28,705
What the hell are you doing?
You gonna floss the damn thing too?

389
00:39:29,206 --> 00:39:31,250
I'm sorry?

390
00:39:32,626 --> 00:39:37,131
You are the strangest, ploddiest
motherfucker I ever met.

391
00:39:38,382 --> 00:39:40,342
Seems to be the theme
in my life lately.

392
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:44,513
Well, bring your rebar-reinforced,
concrete-filled head inside.

393
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:48,433
- I need some help with something.
- All right.

394
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:52,729
One good thing I did in my life.

395
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,483
I got the county to donate
this house to the cause.

396
00:39:57,526 --> 00:40:02,072
The basketball court next door,
the neighborhood kids borrowed it.

397
00:40:03,198 --> 00:40:08,078
But the kids, you know,
they're not zoning experts.

398
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:14,334
They get a little territorial, and
then they got a little caught.

399
00:40:15,294 --> 00:40:21,592
I promised the county I'd account for
them after school, as if any of them go.

400
00:40:22,634 --> 00:40:29,099
And now the kids gotta pay back
the construction company somehow.

401
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,605
- So, what exactly were...?
- What do I want with you?

402
00:40:35,397 --> 00:40:39,026
I was thinking that maybe we,
and by we, I mean you...

403
00:40:39,193 --> 00:40:44,156
...could come up with something for
them to do in the afternoon.

404
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,782
Where are you gonna be?

405
00:40:46,116 --> 00:40:48,785
I gotta spend some afternoons
a few cities over.

406
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:53,290
Fill in for a friend.
Won't be back for a while.

407
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:55,709
I don't know that I would
know what to do.

408
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:59,213
Talk. Shoot pool.

409
00:40:59,379 --> 00:41:01,840
You know, you were
a kid more recently than I was.

410
00:41:05,594 --> 00:41:08,180
- I don't know.
- Well, guess what.

411
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:15,145
<i>- You're already committed?</i>
- Three o'clock.

412
00:41:18,482 --> 00:41:20,526
I guess you're all here because...

413
00:41:20,692 --> 00:41:24,238
...somebody thinks it's gonna
have some kind of influence.

414
00:41:24,404 --> 00:41:28,742
Me, I don't know.
I guess we'll have to see that.

415
00:41:29,368 --> 00:41:32,663
Before I came here,
I wrote down some things.

416
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:39,169
A few things I wish somebody had told
me when I was you guys' age.

417
00:41:39,878 --> 00:41:42,714
Now that I look at it...

418
00:41:42,881 --> 00:41:45,384
...there's not anything
that profound here...

419
00:41:45,551 --> 00:41:48,345
...I have to say really. So...

420
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:54,893
Maybe I should ask you guys some
questions and then start it that way.

421
00:41:58,397 --> 00:42:01,692
- So who are you, for instance?
- Who are you?

422
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,528
- I'm sorry?
- I said, who are you?

423
00:42:08,282 --> 00:42:13,162
Okay. I'm Manuel Jordan.

424
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,752
Why did they tell you
you're coming here today?

425
00:42:20,919 --> 00:42:26,758
It was either this or we go to the woods
and do shit with trees, you know.

426
00:42:26,925 --> 00:42:31,221
Okay. With trees.

427
00:42:33,974 --> 00:42:38,228
How about you?
Excuse me, you, with the...

428
00:42:38,437 --> 00:42:40,689
...things in your head.
What's your name?

429
00:42:41,607 --> 00:42:43,484
- What is it?
- He don't wanna tell you.

430
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,403
- I'm talking to the young man here.
- I ain't young.

431
00:42:46,612 --> 00:42:49,239
What are you, 12 or 14?
You're young, I promise you.

432
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:52,493
- Old enough to know you is a joke.
- It's all a joke.

433
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:55,454
- Didn't I tell y'all this was a joke?
- Right. Yep.

434
00:42:56,663 --> 00:42:59,917
Okay, how many of
you have done time?

435
00:43:01,794 --> 00:43:04,588
Okay, so a few of you have
something in common with me.

436
00:43:05,631 --> 00:43:09,843
I spent 21 years in
a maximum-security prison.

437
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:13,263
A year and a half
in juvenile detention.

438
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:17,935
- His brother shot four guys.
- He on death row. Leavenworth.

439
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:22,439
Got six people on my block been shot.
Plus an old lady and her dog.

440
00:43:22,689 --> 00:43:24,650
- I know that dog.
- What dog?

441
00:43:24,817 --> 00:43:28,445
- Small Charlie.
- That pit bull? Got shot?

442
00:43:28,654 --> 00:43:32,658
- That dog almost bit off half my ass.
- Small Charlie!

443
00:43:34,034 --> 00:43:38,705
So a dog was shot, and six people.

444
00:43:40,707 --> 00:43:44,545
- Anybody feel anything about this?
- I do.

445
00:43:45,003 --> 00:43:49,299
I feel I'd rather be in the woods
doing shit with trees, you know?

446
00:43:53,053 --> 00:43:55,305
Hey, baby!

447
00:43:58,725 --> 00:44:01,228
She fine too! Look at that!
Look at that walk!

448
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:03,814
- Can we help you?
- I came here for my keys.

449
00:44:04,022 --> 00:44:05,482
Finally, some pussy!

450
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:10,779
You know what they say,
you are what you eat.

451
00:44:10,988 --> 00:44:14,616
Then come on over here. I'll
turn you into one big, long dick!

452
00:44:14,825 --> 00:44:16,493
- Hey.
- I don't know about that.

453
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,996
I don't wanna take any work away
from your mother.

454
00:44:19,371 --> 00:44:20,372
That's big talk.

455
00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:22,541
What you're carrying?
That's small talk.

456
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:24,334
- That's enough.
- Wanna find out?

457
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:27,588
Sorry, I already flossed this morning.

458
00:44:28,046 --> 00:44:29,882
- Hi.
- So, what do you want?

459
00:44:30,048 --> 00:44:32,759
My car keys.
I left them with Duwayne.

460
00:44:32,926 --> 00:44:35,679
- With Duwayne?
- The other night.

461
00:44:35,888 --> 00:44:38,348
You left them with me.

462
00:44:42,603 --> 00:44:45,939
No, I think I left them with Duwayne.

463
00:44:48,025 --> 00:44:51,653
Hello?
Mr. Happity Hee-haw Flippity-flop!

464
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,739
Mr. Smiley Pumpkin Head.

465
00:44:53,906 --> 00:44:57,284
I've met you three times,
and I've told you, I'm not Duwayne.

466
00:44:57,451 --> 00:44:58,869
- All right.
- Understand?

467
00:44:59,077 --> 00:45:01,872
Not that you'd remember,
the way you poison yourself.

468
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,707
Who died and made you pope?

469
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:07,377
You're a young person. You've got
means, got everything you want.

470
00:45:07,586 --> 00:45:10,380
Instead, you're just wasting space.
You know that?

471
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:12,758
That's all you are,
is a waste of space.

472
00:45:12,925 --> 00:45:16,887
- Who the fuck are you to tell me...?
- Hey! Come here! Come here!

473
00:45:17,095 --> 00:45:20,641
You stop that! You stop it!

474
00:45:20,974 --> 00:45:22,643
Why are you laughing at me?

475
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:26,355
- Why are you laughing at me?
- I'm nervous. Please.

476
00:45:26,855 --> 00:45:30,359
I'm sorry. Please. I'm really nervous.

477
00:45:32,486 --> 00:45:34,530
Please.

478
00:46:09,523 --> 00:46:10,858
Nice place.

479
00:46:13,152 --> 00:46:16,738
It's not exactly a mansion
on the hill in lvy Grove.

480
00:46:18,866 --> 00:46:20,409
I took you home.

481
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,370
Last week?

482
00:46:25,164 --> 00:46:27,457
You don't remember.

483
00:46:30,669 --> 00:46:33,630
That's pathetic.

484
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,147
- Nice place.
- Oh, yeah.

485
00:46:57,529 --> 00:46:59,490
Is anybody here?

486
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:02,784
- Hey.
- Afternoon.

487
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:05,746
Something I can do for you guys?

488
00:47:05,913 --> 00:47:10,042
Yeah, we're with the FBI. I'm Agent
Collier. This here is Agent Pross.

489
00:47:10,209 --> 00:47:12,836
We just want to ask
you a couple questions.

490
00:47:13,045 --> 00:47:16,089
- You live here?
- Yeah.

491
00:47:16,256 --> 00:47:18,801
- Anyone else live here?
- No.

492
00:47:19,051 --> 00:47:22,971
Well, there's a pastor who lives
upstairs, but not down here.

493
00:47:23,222 --> 00:47:26,183
- Do you have any ID?
- Yeah.

494
00:47:35,943 --> 00:47:41,448
This is a release paper.
I just got out of Atborough.

495
00:47:41,615 --> 00:47:45,160
- How about that?
- Know someone named John Gowen?

496
00:47:47,246 --> 00:47:52,000
There was a guy named Duwayne
that worked here before I got here...

497
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:55,045
...but I never saw what he looked like.

498
00:47:55,254 --> 00:47:58,465
- So you being a good boy?
- Yes, sir.

499
00:47:58,632 --> 00:48:00,843
Yeah, he's been a very good boy.

500
00:48:03,971 --> 00:48:05,722
Johnny Gowen.

501
00:48:06,223 --> 00:48:09,184
- He seemed like such a nice man.
- Oh?

502
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,021
Face was thinner. Had shorter hair.

503
00:48:13,772 --> 00:48:15,941
When is the last time
you saw Mr. Gowen?

504
00:48:16,775 --> 00:48:20,696
- Six months. A year maybe.
- You ever hear from him?

505
00:48:20,863 --> 00:48:24,241
Wish I did.
I had a lot of faith in that boy.

506
00:48:25,742 --> 00:48:28,579
- Thank you for your time, gentlemen.
- Yeah.

507
00:48:29,955 --> 00:48:32,040
Good day, now.

508
00:48:40,048 --> 00:48:43,260
What does it matter what he did?
Past is the past.

509
00:48:43,635 --> 00:48:45,971
But this guy Gowen is a criminal.

510
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:50,017
Crime's done. Can't go back.

511
00:48:50,601 --> 00:48:53,562
What's the use of
putting a man in jail?

512
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:57,649
- Well, he's gotta pay.
- It's society who pays.

513
00:48:57,816 --> 00:49:00,569
They pay by not having
another good man around.

514
00:49:01,862 --> 00:49:03,989
He wasn't a good man.

515
00:49:05,157 --> 00:49:07,951
- Well, can't he become a good man?
- How's that?

516
00:49:09,745 --> 00:49:12,247
How does anybody
become good, Manuel?

517
00:49:14,124 --> 00:49:17,127
I thought you spent
20-some years thinking.

518
00:49:18,337 --> 00:49:20,005
So you were right?

519
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:22,633
- About John Gowen?
- Yeah.

520
00:49:28,013 --> 00:49:31,266
Let's just say his past ran
a little faster than he did.

521
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,562
Look, you gonna stand here, or you
gonna pick up a knife and help?

522
00:49:38,065 --> 00:49:40,734
Here you go. Thank you.

523
00:49:54,998 --> 00:49:58,961
Ma'am, I know this is very difficult,
but I need you to calm down now.

524
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:02,131
You need me to calm down?

525
00:50:03,715 --> 00:50:07,761
I need you to take me to my son.

526
00:50:08,762 --> 00:50:10,055
Now!

527
00:50:26,155 --> 00:50:28,031
Abner's been shot.

528
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,177
Are you sure?

529
00:50:48,343 --> 00:50:53,891
You gotta really be sure, man. Okay?
Right here, right now, you gotta know.

530
00:50:55,142 --> 00:50:56,977
Oh, man.

531
00:50:57,769 --> 00:51:02,399
All right. I'll call you back.
Yeah, give me an hour.

532
00:51:07,154 --> 00:51:09,656
It was Genie Tucker.

533
00:51:10,449 --> 00:51:13,327
He's gonna pay for this.

534
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:50,072
- My fault.
- Any of you guys seen God Boy?

535
00:51:50,322 --> 00:51:52,950
- Who?
- I'm sorry.

536
00:51:54,368 --> 00:51:56,161
- Do that shit again.
- Supposed to be here.

537
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,914
- Do what shit again?
- Now, that's good.

538
00:52:00,165 --> 00:52:03,085
He'll be okay, but I wouldn't worry.

539
00:52:06,505 --> 00:52:09,007
Hey, Miss Easely.

540
00:52:09,216 --> 00:52:11,927
We know who did it.
It was Genie Tucker.

541
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:15,764
- So?
- So we're gonna fix it.

542
00:52:19,852 --> 00:52:22,312
You're still here.

543
00:52:24,189 --> 00:52:25,357
Come on.

544
00:52:29,027 --> 00:52:32,030
<i>That's the one good thing about
bullet wounds, Ms. Isley.</i>

545
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:36,243
First of all, it's Easely.
My last name is Easely.

546
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,830
"They're sterile." And he chuckles.

547
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:42,499
"So we're leaving it in.

548
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:47,546
He may set off a few metal detectors,
but that's a small price to pay."

549
00:52:48,547 --> 00:52:51,008
Small price.

550
00:52:51,884 --> 00:52:56,138
My son has a bullet in his lung.
You haven't touched your pasta thing.

551
00:52:56,305 --> 00:52:59,808
No, I don't really want it.

552
00:53:04,563 --> 00:53:07,107
And the worst part, he's proud of it.

553
00:53:07,608 --> 00:53:10,527
It's like a game to him.

554
00:53:11,278 --> 00:53:13,322
See, it's his friends.

555
00:53:13,906 --> 00:53:16,033
It's his friends.

556
00:53:25,876 --> 00:53:28,504
I should have done things different.

557
00:53:30,923 --> 00:53:34,551
- I was just trying to deal.
- Deal with what?

558
00:53:37,221 --> 00:53:38,555
Living.

559
00:53:40,516 --> 00:53:42,351
So now look.

560
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:47,147
I'm in a hospital cafeteria with
someone whose name I don't know.

561
00:53:48,941 --> 00:53:54,404
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I guess I should probably go.

562
00:53:54,613 --> 00:53:56,240
Who sent you?

563
00:53:58,867 --> 00:54:00,494
I'm not what you think I am.

564
00:54:07,042 --> 00:54:09,586
I don't care.

565
00:54:10,629 --> 00:54:14,883
See, the fact is...

566
00:54:21,974 --> 00:54:26,436
...I'm late for something I'm
supposed to be doing right now.

567
00:54:30,983 --> 00:54:35,362
There's a flower and everything.

568
00:54:36,071 --> 00:54:37,990
So you know...

569
00:54:38,699 --> 00:54:41,618
...take care of yourself.

570
00:54:44,121 --> 00:54:48,542
- What the hell was that?
- I'm sorry.

571
00:54:48,709 --> 00:54:53,255
You can't smile when you do it.
You gotta be all stoic like, "I'm sorry."

572
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:56,425
"I'm sorry."
How about that one?

573
00:54:56,592 --> 00:55:01,180
You gotta fuck up your hair a little.
It's already pretty fucked up.

574
00:55:03,307 --> 00:55:05,559
I'm sorry I'm late.

575
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,481
- You are being so ridiculous.
- Listen to me.

576
00:55:11,273 --> 00:55:15,194
- I'm serious. You think this is funny?
- You gotta lighten up a little bit.

577
00:55:15,402 --> 00:55:18,530
- What do you think you're doing?
- Having a good time, laughing.

578
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:21,200
- It's not a place to have fun.
- Well, I'm sorry.

579
00:55:21,408 --> 00:55:25,162
You were late, and we were
just hanging out, waiting for you.

580
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:29,333
What is that? Your icy stare
you learned in prison or something?

581
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,668
What?

582
00:55:33,212 --> 00:55:38,008
Are you here on earth with me?
Hello? Hello, insane man.

583
00:55:58,278 --> 00:56:01,448
- Killed a guy.
- Why don't you get out of here.

584
00:56:01,615 --> 00:56:05,160
- I heard about your lecture.
- I told you to get out of here.

585
00:56:17,506 --> 00:56:21,343
- I wanted to thank you.
- Thank me?

586
00:56:22,386 --> 00:56:24,471
For bringing me home.

587
00:56:26,765 --> 00:56:28,225
The other day.

588
00:56:29,268 --> 00:56:32,146
- Why do you do that to yourself?
- What?

589
00:56:33,105 --> 00:56:37,192
- In there, in that place at night.
- It's just dancing.

590
00:56:38,026 --> 00:56:41,071
Why are you trying to kill yourself?

591
00:56:42,072 --> 00:56:44,199
Are you hungry?

592
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:48,078
- What are you talking about?
- I'll make you lunch.

593
00:56:49,705 --> 00:56:54,460
- I make a mean frittata.
- Well, I don't know what that is...

594
00:56:54,668 --> 00:56:58,172
...but I don't think so.
- Why not?

595
00:56:58,338 --> 00:57:01,758
You haven't been paying attention.
We don't get along so well.

596
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:03,469
So?

597
00:57:07,347 --> 00:57:08,640
Please?

598
00:57:16,523 --> 00:57:19,359
- Where are you from?
- Piscine.

599
00:57:19,526 --> 00:57:24,531
- Where's that?
- It's just this little town in Illinois.

600
00:57:24,698 --> 00:57:26,742
Your parents there?

601
00:57:28,076 --> 00:57:30,287
What's your mom,
some sort of singer?

602
00:57:30,454 --> 00:57:33,123
Was. The bank guy's only
letting us stay here...

603
00:57:33,332 --> 00:57:35,793
...because he liked her music
in college.

604
00:57:42,841 --> 00:57:44,468
Oh, here.

605
00:57:50,724 --> 00:57:55,187
Like it? We call it
"Early American Foreclosure."

606
00:57:55,395 --> 00:57:58,273
It's on the cover of
<i>Architectural Digest.</i>

607
00:57:58,899 --> 00:58:01,652
- Sofia?
- I'm busy!

608
00:58:01,819 --> 00:58:03,487
Sofia?

609
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:06,281
We could have a blind butler.
It wouldn't matter.

610
00:58:06,448 --> 00:58:09,535
He could always find her,
and there's no furniture to trip on.

611
00:58:09,743 --> 00:58:11,370
Where were you?

612
00:58:12,246 --> 00:58:15,499
There's an ex-con
coming up to kill you!

613
00:58:15,707 --> 00:58:17,292
What?

614
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,419
Sofia!

615
00:58:19,586 --> 00:58:23,215
- Where's my yellow towel?
- It's in the wash.

616
00:58:23,423 --> 00:58:26,176
- What?
- I washed it with the others.

617
00:58:26,552 --> 00:58:27,845
What?

618
00:58:29,888 --> 00:58:32,599
Nice, raising a 42-year-old child,
isn't it?

619
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,852
Sofia?

620
00:58:35,394 --> 00:58:37,187
Looks 60, huh?

621
00:58:37,354 --> 00:58:39,857
Tell her. It'll make her feel good.

622
00:58:40,941 --> 00:58:42,568
Are you making food?

623
00:58:42,776 --> 00:58:45,571
It's like living with
someone out of "Cats."

624
00:58:45,779 --> 00:58:49,491
It's a musical? "Cats"?
It's an '80s thing.

625
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:52,494
The '80s were a decade?

626
00:58:53,537 --> 00:58:55,622
I'm hungry.

627
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,629
By the way, if you decide
you can't make it in free society...

628
00:59:02,796 --> 00:59:04,882
...and you feel the urge to kill again...

629
00:59:05,257 --> 00:59:07,885
- What are you making?
- Frittatas.

630
00:59:08,343 --> 00:59:11,180
- I want ketchup.
- I know.

631
00:59:28,447 --> 00:59:30,157
Images.

632
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,452
What do you mean?

633
00:59:40,459 --> 00:59:42,920
I mostly just remember images.

634
00:59:45,631 --> 00:59:46,965
Like pictures.

635
00:59:50,886 --> 00:59:53,180
There were three of us.

636
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:58,852
Ripple and Roundabout.

637
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:01,396
Roundabout? Righteous?

638
01:00:02,815 --> 01:00:03,941
I was Righteous.

639
01:00:04,316 --> 01:00:06,318
Let's do it.

640
01:00:09,446 --> 01:00:10,989
You good, Righteous?

641
01:00:11,365 --> 01:00:13,283
I remember his face.

642
01:00:14,993 --> 01:00:16,703
Why were you doing it?

643
01:00:20,415 --> 01:00:22,334
I think...

644
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,718
Manuel?

645
01:00:34,763 --> 01:00:37,975
<i>- I think I was angry.</i>
<i>- Manuel.</i>

646
01:00:38,308 --> 01:00:42,271
Yeah. I remember his face.

647
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:47,025
<i>He kind of turned and...</i>

648
01:00:47,401 --> 01:00:49,611
Give him the fucking cash!
Do it!

649
01:00:51,488 --> 01:00:52,948
He was looking at me.

650
01:00:53,907 --> 01:00:55,784
<i>He was looking at me so strange.</i>

651
01:00:55,951 --> 01:00:57,661
Do what he says!
Stop looking at him!

652
01:00:57,828 --> 01:01:00,455
- Give him the fucking cash now!
- What are you doing?

653
01:01:00,622 --> 01:01:03,333
<i>I remember his face.</i>

654
01:01:04,877 --> 01:01:07,754
He just kept looking at me.

655
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:10,007
And I...

656
01:01:11,717 --> 01:01:14,011
...was looking at him.

657
01:01:14,887 --> 01:01:16,889
And he just looked at me so funny.

658
01:01:19,892 --> 01:01:20,934
What are you doing?

659
01:01:21,351 --> 01:01:24,354
He looked at me like
he knew something I didn't know.

660
01:01:38,118 --> 01:01:39,536
I did it.

661
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:51,548
It was like something was
just passing through me.

662
01:01:56,804 --> 01:01:58,847
I don't understand.

663
01:02:01,433 --> 01:02:02,810
Fuck!

664
01:02:02,976 --> 01:02:05,479
- Righteous.
- Oh, fuck.

665
01:02:05,896 --> 01:02:07,606
<i>We gotta get</i>
<i>the fuck out of here.</i>

666
01:02:07,815 --> 01:02:11,318
- Come on! Just leave him, okay?
- Let's just fucking go, man!

667
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:22,079
<i>Manuel?</i>

668
01:02:23,997 --> 01:02:26,416
<i>It seemed like it took...</i>

669
01:02:28,168 --> 01:02:30,587
<i>... just a few seconds...</i>

670
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,761
...and forever.

671
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:41,932
It's...

672
01:02:43,183 --> 01:02:44,935
...terrible.

673
01:03:11,628 --> 01:03:14,423
Hey. Sleeping Beauty?

674
01:03:16,008 --> 01:03:17,801
You got a phone call.

675
01:03:17,968 --> 01:03:20,053
Somebody named Adele.

676
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,849
- She's on the phone?
- A little while ago.

677
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:26,685
She wanted to know
if you were free tomorrow.

678
01:03:26,852 --> 01:03:31,523
I told her yeah, until midnight.
Then your dick turns to a pumpkin.

679
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,529
She asked for the custodian.

680
01:03:37,696 --> 01:03:39,990
Like she didn't know your name.

681
01:03:41,825 --> 01:03:44,995
Sorry, but I was a little sleepy,
you know, and...

682
01:03:45,954 --> 01:03:48,415
So I told her it was Duwayne.

683
01:03:49,082 --> 01:03:51,710
I figured you had your reasons
for not telling her.

684
01:03:53,587 --> 01:03:55,798
This Adele...

685
01:03:56,757 --> 01:03:59,468
...is she by any chance
Adele Easely?

686
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:04,181
Hey, man, you're my tenant.
You think I don't do my homework?

687
01:04:08,602 --> 01:04:11,230
Look, jack,
I don't care what you did.

688
01:04:11,688 --> 01:04:15,734
I mean, sometimes
I wish I could've done the same thing.

689
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:20,697
- No, you don't.
- I said, "wish," not "did."

690
01:04:24,034 --> 01:04:27,871
All right.
I didn't mean to trivialize.

691
01:04:28,622 --> 01:04:30,207
The club goes in 45 minutes.

692
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:34,503
You gonna be there, or do I have
to start dialing phone booths?

693
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:38,674
Manuel, what's done's done.

694
01:04:41,552 --> 01:04:43,595
I need an answer.

695
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:48,016
- I'll be there.
- Good because I won't.

696
01:04:52,312 --> 01:04:54,064
I got an aunt.

697
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:58,485
She's dying of tuberculosis.
I gotta go and be with her...

698
01:04:59,319 --> 01:05:02,573
...do the funeral thing.
It shouldn't be long.

699
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:05,075
You'll be in charge till I get back.

700
01:05:06,201 --> 01:05:07,995
Miles?

701
01:05:12,332 --> 01:05:14,084
You'll do fine.

702
01:05:14,626 --> 01:05:16,211
Don't worry about it.

703
01:05:17,129 --> 01:05:19,506
You're no John Gowen.

704
01:05:23,844 --> 01:05:23,927
I went on a date the other night.
It was a blind date...

705
01:05:23,927 --> 01:05:26,722
I went on a date the other night.
It was a blind date...

706
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:28,765
...but it didn't start as a blind date.

707
01:05:28,932 --> 01:05:32,269
Just when the girl saw me,
she popped her eyes out.

708
01:05:34,771 --> 01:05:37,065
She was a real princess. She...

709
01:05:37,232 --> 01:05:39,776
I tried drinking champagne
out of her slipper...

710
01:05:39,943 --> 01:05:42,196
...but I nearly choked
on the Odor-Eater.

711
01:05:48,035 --> 01:05:50,996
He just seems like an evil fog.

712
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:53,332
Thank you.

713
01:05:53,874 --> 01:05:56,543
Like, I couldn't even...

714
01:05:56,710 --> 01:06:02,049
...imagine a person with an actual face
who could do something like that.

715
01:06:03,801 --> 01:06:06,553
I heard he was beaten in Atborough.

716
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,722
They said he'd die.

717
01:06:11,308 --> 01:06:14,186
He probably did
if there's any justice.

718
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,699
- Do you think there is?
- For criminals.

719
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:34,039
Not for the rest of us.
Unless there's a God and then...

720
01:06:35,082 --> 01:06:36,667
Well...

721
01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:41,088
Then all bets are off.

722
01:06:43,382 --> 01:06:46,301
- Do you think there is a God?
- No, thank God.

723
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:48,387
Because I've done some bad things.

724
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:54,017
But I always thought that if I
put a good child out into the world...

725
01:06:57,437 --> 01:07:00,691
But I don't see that I did that.

726
01:07:01,108 --> 01:07:03,402
So I don't know what to do.

727
01:07:05,445 --> 01:07:08,282
Abner gets
out of the hospital tomorrow.

728
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,702
He won't listen to me.

729
01:07:13,871 --> 01:07:15,873
And he has no real men.

730
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,250
Anywhere.

731
01:07:18,959 --> 01:07:22,880
At all. Which leaves only
his friends, and they're...

732
01:07:24,339 --> 01:07:26,258
Well, you saw them.

733
01:07:27,426 --> 01:07:30,846
But if you're asking me to talk to him,
I don't know about that.

734
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:33,682
Well, they've got something planned...

735
01:07:34,475 --> 01:07:36,226
...on the guy who shot him.

736
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:42,733
I really think
I'm the wrong person to ask.

737
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,401
Duwayne.

738
01:07:47,821 --> 01:07:49,990
I don't know where else to turn.

739
01:08:00,793 --> 01:08:02,294
Okay.

740
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:32,991
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>God made me the way I am.</i>

741
01:08:34,117 --> 01:08:36,245
<i>Or whoever did it.</i>

742
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:42,334
<i>I'm certainly not proud of who I am.</i>

743
01:08:51,135 --> 01:08:54,471
<i>We're all capable of anything.</i>
<i>I know that now.</i>

744
01:08:57,057 --> 01:08:59,726
<i>Me? I could have been anything.</i>

745
01:09:01,895 --> 01:09:04,815
<i>Farmer, businessman.</i>

746
01:09:04,982 --> 01:09:07,359
<i>Just one more body</i>
<i>out of the billions.</i>

747
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:11,530
What are you thinking about?

748
01:09:13,365 --> 01:09:15,033
I don't know.

749
01:09:16,243 --> 01:09:18,036
Gravity.

750
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:20,455
Yeah, well...

751
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:23,000
...don't last long.

752
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:43,770
<i>I know what you think you'll feel.</i>

753
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:46,523
It's not like that.

754
01:09:49,193 --> 01:09:52,529
You think it's gonna make the world
a better place afterward?

755
01:09:54,865 --> 01:09:57,534
Do you think it's gonna
make you any better?

756
01:09:57,868 --> 01:09:59,286
I'm wearing his bullet.

757
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:01,997
You didn't answer my question.

758
01:10:02,206 --> 01:10:05,876
I know you're a friend of my mom,
but what's right is right.

759
01:10:07,252 --> 01:10:10,547
- According to who?
- What are you talking about?

760
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,467
What are you fucking talking about?

761
01:10:15,135 --> 01:10:17,304
You can save him.

762
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:19,473
Are you fucking deaf?

763
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:23,352
He shot me. He wants me dead.

764
01:10:25,896 --> 01:10:27,606
If I don't get him, he'll get me.

765
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,860
- What about your mother?
- Look, this ain't about her.

766
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:35,364
- All right, I got plans.
- Abner? Can I ask you a question?

767
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,908
Who were you named after?

768
01:10:38,075 --> 01:10:41,370
My dead uncle. What's your problem?

769
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:42,955
I knew your uncle.

770
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:46,875
- Bullshit.
- Really.

771
01:10:51,171 --> 01:10:55,509
- Yeah, why are you into this?
- Because I care about your mother...

772
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:57,261
...and she cares about you.

773
01:10:57,427 --> 01:11:01,014
Yeah, you care about yourself.
You're just like everyone else.

774
01:11:36,341 --> 01:11:38,385
I don't know.

775
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:50,063
- Come on.
- Come on, boy.

776
01:11:50,397 --> 01:11:53,442
What? Roll, man! Let's go!

777
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,500
Yo, yo, Abner, chill.
The cops, bro.

778
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:11,710
Let's get out of here, man.
Come on.

779
01:12:40,697 --> 01:12:43,325
- Hey.
- "Hey"? What do you mean, "hey"?

780
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:46,411
- What happened?
- Nothing. He was lucky.

781
01:12:46,578 --> 01:12:49,164
- Who?
- Genie Tucker.

782
01:12:49,373 --> 01:12:51,625
He heard I was coming.
He totally split. Gone.

783
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,085
What do you mean?

784
01:12:53,293 --> 01:12:55,587
He ran. He heard
I was coming, and he split.

785
01:12:55,754 --> 01:12:57,673
- What are you talking about?
- What do...?

786
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:01,260
You stand here and talk to me.
Tell me what you're talking about.

787
01:13:01,468 --> 01:13:04,388
- No! I'm fine! Everything's over!
- I don't believe you.

788
01:13:04,555 --> 01:13:06,765
- Mom, it is over.
- We have been sitting here...

789
01:13:07,141 --> 01:13:10,394
Nothing happened. He ran.
He heard I was coming, and he left.

790
01:13:10,561 --> 01:13:14,314
Him and all of his friends, okay?
Dude left town. It's over.

791
01:13:14,565 --> 01:13:16,692
What do you mean,
"dude left town"?

792
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:20,028
What is this?
"The Wild, Wild West"?

793
01:13:20,445 --> 01:13:23,282
Abner! Come in here and talk to me!

794
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:26,326
Mom, I just told you, it is over.

795
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:29,580
Not a big deal.
Look, Mr. Rogers, he can go home.

796
01:13:29,746 --> 01:13:32,082
Nothing happened. All right?

797
01:13:32,249 --> 01:13:35,294
Here. Everything's done. It's over.

798
01:13:35,669 --> 01:13:38,755
Okay?
Now, I may be a little while.

799
01:13:39,089 --> 01:13:41,383
I don't know if you want
to do the bone dance.

800
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:45,179
Everything's fine. All right?
I'll see you later.

801
01:13:57,774 --> 01:13:59,735
I'm sorry.

802
01:14:06,658 --> 01:14:10,037
- It's complicated.
- Oh, no kidding.

803
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:13,582
Men. Oh, God.

804
01:14:29,848 --> 01:14:31,558
See...

805
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:38,357
God.

806
01:14:43,153 --> 01:14:46,573
- I'm not who you think I am.
- Neither am I.

807
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:51,203
- No, you don't understand.
- You seriously don't know me.

808
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:53,747
I wish you wouldn't say that.

809
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:01,547
What are you looking at?

810
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:06,635
Duwayne?

811
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,849
Did somebody hurt you?

812
01:15:21,191 --> 01:15:23,610
It doesn't matter, does it?

813
01:15:29,241 --> 01:15:31,743
- I really need you to help me.
- How?

814
01:15:55,893 --> 01:15:59,646
I just... I need you.
I just need you to help me.

815
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:01,732
It's okay.

816
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:06,361
- What's okay?
- Whatever.

817
01:16:15,245 --> 01:16:17,247
It's okay.

818
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:20,167
Don't worry.

819
01:16:20,459 --> 01:16:22,711
Baby, don't worry.

820
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:29,862
- Have you seen Miles around?
- Señor Miles is gone.

821
01:17:30,028 --> 01:17:31,697
What do you mean, "gone"?
Where?

822
01:17:31,864 --> 01:17:35,993
Hey, God Boy! Hey, God Boy!
I need your help.

823
01:17:41,373 --> 01:17:45,335
Sorry to do this to you again, bro. I got
two guys who called in sick tonight.

824
01:17:45,502 --> 01:17:49,756
She's been puking, and she's
been asking for God Boy.

825
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:53,677
Hey!

826
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:56,889
Why don't you get up and go home.

827
01:17:57,431 --> 01:17:59,766
- I can't.
- Why not?

828
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:05,689
Because we got evicted.

829
01:18:07,065 --> 01:18:08,025
Come on.

830
01:18:17,117 --> 01:18:18,952
You should sleep.

831
01:18:19,786 --> 01:18:23,624
- You smell like sex.
- Well, you smell like puke.

832
01:18:30,714 --> 01:18:32,090
Miles.

833
01:18:46,939 --> 01:18:48,607
Miles.

834
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:53,570
- What do you want?
- I need to talk.

835
01:18:53,737 --> 01:18:55,405
Well, hurry up.

836
01:18:59,409 --> 01:19:00,911
Miles?

837
01:19:02,788 --> 01:19:04,373
Miles?

838
01:19:04,998 --> 01:19:07,960
- What do you want to talk about?
- Adele.

839
01:19:08,168 --> 01:19:11,588
- What about Adele?
- I got weak and I crossed the line.

840
01:19:11,755 --> 01:19:15,092
- I just wanted to help her and then...
- You needed too much from her.

841
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:18,554
- What do you mean?
- That's why you came back, Manuel.

842
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,807
Not to help her,
to ask for forgiveness.

843
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:26,645
- I want to help her.
- Lie to others, Manuel.

844
01:19:26,812 --> 01:19:28,814
Don't lie to yourself.

845
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:34,528
Miles. Wait a minute!

846
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:37,531
Sorry. I can't help you.

847
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:39,491
You're on your own.

848
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:42,494
Miles?

849
01:19:46,123 --> 01:19:48,459
My name is John.

850
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:26,747
<i>It might not make any sense, but...</i>

851
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,918
...instead of thinking
about what he did...

852
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:34,797
...try thinking about what he did for
you. That's the important thing.

853
01:20:35,839 --> 01:20:38,467
You're saying this guy
was on the run the whole time?

854
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:40,636
- He lied to us.
- Yeah.

855
01:20:40,844 --> 01:20:43,430
- For real.
- I think it's kind of cool, though.

856
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:49,102
Dude never said nothing about who
he was. I just assumed he was for real.

857
01:20:49,812 --> 01:20:52,481
Well, one thing you can assume
is that he was...

858
01:20:52,648 --> 01:20:55,734
...sincere about what he said to you.
I mean, that's...

859
01:20:55,943 --> 01:20:58,153
- People mess up, you know?
- What about you?

860
01:20:58,487 --> 01:20:59,905
What do you mean?
What about me?

861
01:21:00,113 --> 01:21:03,492
We gonna have to sit here and listen
to you bullshit us too now?

862
01:21:03,951 --> 01:21:07,830
No, you don't have to sit here and
listen to me bullshit you. I'm leaving.

863
01:21:08,789 --> 01:21:10,249
How come?

864
01:21:10,791 --> 01:21:14,128
Because I messed up,
and I gotta pay for it.

865
01:21:14,545 --> 01:21:16,463
What, you going back to jail?

866
01:21:17,548 --> 01:21:18,841
No, I'm just going away.

867
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:21,510
- Where?
- I don't know.

868
01:21:24,721 --> 01:21:27,599
- What time is it?
- Afternoon.

869
01:21:27,766 --> 01:21:29,768
It's like 3:30.

870
01:21:29,977 --> 01:21:34,731
- You look like shit, girl.
- That's "shit, woman" to you.

871
01:21:51,331 --> 01:21:54,626
So, player, tell me
how it really went down.

872
01:21:54,793 --> 01:21:58,922
I just said, "Yo. Please get off me.
Please. You're not good."

873
01:21:59,089 --> 01:22:01,758
- Stop lying, man.
- Word is bond.

874
01:22:02,885 --> 01:22:05,596
Lee had, like, two beers
and he's drunk.

875
01:22:05,762 --> 01:22:07,931
You know Raul don't drink.

876
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:09,975
Hey, guys.

877
01:22:10,267 --> 01:22:11,977
What's up?

878
01:22:13,187 --> 01:22:15,230
Oh, thanks.

879
01:22:21,904 --> 01:22:23,697
How much you owe
these guys anyway?

880
01:22:23,906 --> 01:22:26,617
Constructors? Like 4000.

881
01:22:26,783 --> 01:22:31,121
- Man. Why we gotta give it to them?
- Because you owe it to them.

882
01:22:31,288 --> 01:22:34,124
Like we need another
liquor store around here?

883
01:22:36,668 --> 01:22:38,170
Shut up!

884
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:40,589
Crazy.

885
01:22:41,131 --> 01:22:43,050
So, what happens now?

886
01:22:51,391 --> 01:22:53,101
<i>To Adele Easely:</i>

887
01:22:54,812 --> 01:22:57,648
<i>I keep thinking about what you said.</i>

888
01:22:57,815 --> 01:23:01,985
<i>About how your brother Abner,</i>
<i>to you, is now just a statistic.</i>

889
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:06,657
<i>Well, for 23 years,</i>
<i>I've been carrying a weight.</i>

890
01:23:06,824 --> 01:23:11,245
<i>And for 23 years, I never knew</i>
<i>how I could possibly release it.</i>

891
01:23:12,162 --> 01:23:15,874
<i>I thought it would be</i>
<i>b y making myself known to you.</i>

892
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:19,878
<i>Telling you who I was</i>
<i>and apologizing.</i>

893
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:24,758
<i>I had a fantasy</i>
<i>that I could help things.</i>

894
01:23:24,967 --> 01:23:27,344
<i>As if b y doing some number</i>
<i>of good things now...</i>

895
01:23:27,678 --> 01:23:30,973
<i>... it could make up</i>
<i>for one very bad thing then.</i>

896
01:23:33,016 --> 01:23:36,186
<i>But I think that b y telling you</i>
<i>who I am...</i>

897
01:23:37,187 --> 01:23:40,607
<i>... I would only be helping myself.</i>

898
01:23:41,859 --> 01:23:44,695
<i>But I'm too weak to carry this weight.</i>

899
01:23:45,362 --> 01:23:48,699
<i>And I need you to know</i>
<i>how sorry I am.</i>

900
01:23:50,993 --> 01:23:54,288
<i>I'm a murderer and a coward.</i>

901
01:23:55,956 --> 01:23:59,001
<i>And I will always remain</i>
<i>these things.</i>

902
01:24:12,389 --> 01:24:15,434
<i>I read a book once on redemption.</i>

903
01:24:16,977 --> 01:24:21,023
<i>A man said there were five steps</i>
<i>toward making amends.</i>

904
01:24:22,774 --> 01:24:26,111
<i>The first involved</i>
<i>acknowledging what you did.</i>

905
01:24:26,778 --> 01:24:29,156
<i>The second involved remorse.</i>

906
01:24:30,115 --> 01:24:32,993
<i>The third involved making right</i>
<i>with your neighbor.</i>

907
01:24:33,452 --> 01:24:36,830
<i>Only then were you able</i>
<i>to go to step four...</i>

908
01:24:37,498 --> 01:24:40,167
<i>... which was making it right with God.</i>

909
01:24:41,168 --> 01:24:45,798
<i>Only I can't bring Abner Easely back</i>
<i>like he's some stolen chicken.</i>

910
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:50,052
<i>Certainly made sure</i>
<i>of that 23 years ago.</i>

911
01:24:50,969 --> 01:24:52,930
<i>And I don't believe in some God...</i>

912
01:24:53,138 --> 01:24:56,099
<i>... that's gonna open his arms to me</i>
<i>even if I did.</i>

913
01:24:57,059 --> 01:25:00,020
<i>So there go steps three and four.</i>

914
01:25:02,105 --> 01:25:04,399
<i>And as for step five...</i>

915
01:25:04,983 --> 01:25:07,861
<i>... time makes sure we're never</i>
<i>in the same place twice...</i>

916
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:10,155
<i>... no matter how much we wish it.</i>

917
01:25:13,116 --> 01:25:16,954
<i>Which is why, for me,</i>
<i>I know I'll never be redeemed.</i>

918
01:25:54,408 --> 01:25:57,244
What goes around comes
around, motherfucker!

919
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:00,289
Abner!

920
01:26:00,914 --> 01:26:03,792
- Put the gun down!
- What the fuck are you doing?

921
01:26:03,959 --> 01:26:07,421
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Abner, put the gun down.

922
01:26:07,796 --> 01:26:09,381
Don't be stupid.

923
01:26:09,548 --> 01:26:12,342
He shot me, all right?
He shot me!

924
01:26:12,509 --> 01:26:15,262
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does!

925
01:26:15,429 --> 01:26:19,850
- Just put it down!
- No! He's done! He's dead!

926
01:26:20,017 --> 01:26:21,977
It's not worth it, trust me.

927
01:26:24,897 --> 01:26:26,482
What are you fucking doing?

928
01:26:27,524 --> 01:26:30,527
- Abner, put the gun down.
- Like you're gonna pull that.

929
01:26:30,861 --> 01:26:32,362
- Yes, I will.
- Bullshit!

930
01:26:32,529 --> 01:26:33,530
Yes, I will.

931
01:26:33,864 --> 01:26:37,034
I'm putting him in the dumpster!
You better shoot me, or it's him!

932
01:26:37,201 --> 01:26:38,952
I don't care about him!

933
01:26:39,453 --> 01:26:42,789
- No. Fuck that. Back off!
<i>- Manuel.</i>

934
01:26:42,956 --> 01:26:44,958
- Don't come any closer!
- You listen to me!

935
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:47,586
- Listen to me!
- Get the fuck away from me!

936
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,129
Stop! Stop!

937
01:26:49,296 --> 01:26:50,464
No! No!

938
01:26:52,049 --> 01:26:53,509
Stop!

939
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:02,017
Don't let him get away! Stop!
Get the fuck off me!

940
01:27:02,226 --> 01:27:03,602
What are you doing?

941
01:27:06,647 --> 01:27:10,025
He fucking got away!
What the fuck?

942
01:27:10,192 --> 01:27:12,569
Shit!
Why did you get involved in this?

943
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:14,613
He was gonna shoot me!

944
01:27:16,073 --> 01:27:19,827
Goddamn it!
What's your problem?

945
01:27:21,078 --> 01:27:22,538
Abner.

946
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:25,624
What the hell?

947
01:27:31,505 --> 01:27:33,215
What the hell?

948
01:27:34,925 --> 01:27:37,386
Shit. Shit!

949
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:39,555
Oh, fuck!

950
01:27:41,932 --> 01:27:43,350
Shit!

951
01:27:44,476 --> 01:27:47,354
- Abner!
- No, no, no, no.

952
01:27:47,563 --> 01:27:49,481
- Abner?
- Mom? Ma?

953
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:54,278
Abner. Are you okay?
Are you okay?

954
01:27:54,444 --> 01:27:56,029
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay, Mom.

955
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:58,949
- Oh, God!
- He jumped in front.

956
01:28:00,117 --> 01:28:01,493
- Is he okay, Mom?
- I'm sorry.

957
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:03,537
- Don't you say a word!
- Mom?

958
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:06,331
Wait here. Keep him warm.

959
01:28:06,957 --> 01:28:08,333
Ma!

960
01:28:11,962 --> 01:28:14,548
Help! Somebody!

961
01:28:16,467 --> 01:28:18,093
Help!

962
01:28:18,302 --> 01:28:19,928
Ma!

963
01:28:20,596 --> 01:28:23,182
- Mom.
- Help me!

964
01:28:44,661 --> 01:28:46,622
<i>Manuel.</i>

965
01:28:53,754 --> 01:28:55,672
Manuel.

966
01:29:04,765 --> 01:29:06,683
<i>Manuel.</i>

967
01:29:14,483 --> 01:29:14,525
Manuel Jordan.

968
01:29:14,525 --> 01:29:16,485
Manuel Jordan.

969
01:29:18,278 --> 01:29:22,449
- How long have I been in here?
- Two days.

970
01:29:45,389 --> 01:29:47,516
You saved me.

971
01:29:50,018 --> 01:29:52,271
You brought me here.

972
01:29:53,564 --> 01:29:55,274
Why?

973
01:29:55,607 --> 01:29:57,484
I don't know, Manuel.

974
01:29:58,152 --> 01:30:00,112
Doctor says you're gonna be fine.

975
01:30:02,364 --> 01:30:06,201
Some clothes, a little bit of money.

976
01:30:07,578 --> 01:30:09,121
I'm not staying.

977
01:30:10,581 --> 01:30:13,083
I just needed to see you're okay.

978
01:30:14,751 --> 01:30:17,546
See that I didn't waste my energy...

979
01:30:18,088 --> 01:30:20,424
...and I wanted to say goodbye.

980
01:30:24,761 --> 01:30:26,805
Can I come see you?

981
01:30:28,765 --> 01:30:30,726
No. Please.

982
01:30:34,104 --> 01:30:36,190
Please don't ever come
to see me. Ever.

983
01:30:36,398 --> 01:30:38,525
This is my town. It's my home.

984
01:30:40,194 --> 01:30:42,362
You got the rest of the world.

985
01:31:24,154 --> 01:31:26,698
- What?
- I can't.

986
01:31:26,865 --> 01:31:28,826
What do you mean, you can't?

987
01:31:30,202 --> 01:31:32,079
You've got to.

988
01:31:32,538 --> 01:31:35,582
These kids like you.
You make them laugh.

989
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:37,459
So?

990
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:42,131
So I think that's important.

991
01:31:42,673 --> 01:31:44,842
Yeah, but I don't know anything.

992
01:31:45,175 --> 01:31:47,427
- The routine...
- Hell, just make something up.

993
01:31:47,636 --> 01:31:49,721
It doesn't really matter.

994
01:31:50,347 --> 01:31:52,266
Just stop whining and do it.

995
01:31:52,474 --> 01:31:55,602
Just figure it out together.
They get you.

996
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,355
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

997
01:31:58,605 --> 01:32:01,733
Well, neither do I,
but you'll think of something, okay?

998
01:32:06,196 --> 01:32:07,573
Are you coming back?

999
01:32:09,533 --> 01:32:11,493
I don't know.

1000
01:32:14,204 --> 01:32:16,456
You'll be fine.

1001
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:41,959
Hey, how are you?

1002
01:33:42,292 --> 01:33:45,337
- It's 15 bucks.
