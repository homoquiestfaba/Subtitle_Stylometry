1087
01:22:00,455 --> 01:22:02,455
David?

1088
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:09,022
David, I brought you
some clothes that I found in my--

1089
01:22:09,032 --> 01:22:13,282
In my father's closet
that I thought might fit you.

[Horn honks]

1092
01:24:04,933 --> 01:24:07,738
It's nice to get out of the city.

1093
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:11,669
[Laughs]

1094
01:24:14,661 --> 01:24:16,661
Listen. Um...

1095
01:24:18,788 --> 01:24:20,788
I think that...

1096
01:24:22,084 --> 01:24:25,371
we just go in tomorrow
like nothing happened.

1097
01:24:25,381 --> 01:24:26,939
And...

1098
01:24:26,949 --> 01:24:30,811
like everything is like it was.

1099
01:24:48,772 --> 01:24:50,772
Bye, David.

1100
01:24:52,868 --> 01:24:55,356
Everything will be fine.

1101
01:24:57,796 --> 01:24:59,796
Yeah.

1102

Hey, G, it's, uh-- It's pretty early, man.

1107
01:25:48,547 --> 01:25:51,288
I, uh-- I was just calling
to see how you were doing.

1108
01:25:51,298 --> 01:25:54,201
I, um-- Oh, I thought
maybe later we could, uh--

1109
01:25:54,211 --> 01:25:56,217
We could grab some lunch.

1110
01:25:56,227 --> 01:25:59,896
Anyway, all right, Garret,
give me a call. Bye.

[Music plays]

1113
01:26:50,913 --> 01:26:53,591
Rebecca [Narrating]:
The apartment was not so much an apartment,

1114
01:26:53,601 --> 01:26:57,399
as a monument to a good life
and a better fortune.

1115
01:26:57,409 --> 01:26:59,735
The owner was a man of stature,

1116
01:26:59,745 --> 01:27:01,975
handsome,
with an articulate wit.

1117
01:27:01,985 --> 01:27:04,057
A bull among calves.

1118
01:27:04,161 --> 01:27:07,903
An arrogant, ego-driven,
misogynist bull

1119
01:27:08,001 --> 01:27:11,863
that she would carefully lead
to the slaughter.

1120
01:27:11,873 --> 01:27:14,583
It could have all been
so easily avoided.

1121
01:27:14,593 --> 01:27:18,302
If he had only taken
a moment, one moment,

1122
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,143
he would've seen
the blueprint for his demise.

1123
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:22,423
Rebecca:
David?

1124
01:27:22,433 --> 01:27:24,119
You didn't maybe,
possibly have a chance

1125
01:27:24,129 --> 01:27:25,751
to look at the story
I gave you, did you?

1126
01:27:25,761 --> 01:27:27,350
David:
Aw, shit.

1127
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,109
But I am gonna burn
through a stack of reading

1128
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:30,774
as soon as I get home.

1129
01:27:30,784 --> 01:27:34,070
Rebecca [Narrating]:
But she knew he wouldn't bother.

1130
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,638
Of course not.

1131
01:27:35,648 --> 01:27:37,783
A man who basked
in the reflected glow

1132
01:27:37,793 --> 01:27:39,734
of those with real talent,

1133
01:27:39,744 --> 01:27:41,910
getting rich
off the blood and sweat

1134
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,694
and torment
of those he represented.

1135
01:27:44,704 --> 01:27:46,262
Surely he'd never take the time

1136
01:27:46,272 --> 01:27:48,598
to read a story
from an unknown writer.

1137
01:27:48,608 --> 01:27:51,286
David?
I have Andrew Dunlap for you.

1138
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:53,206
She chose a name at random

1139
01:27:53,216 --> 01:27:55,254
and stamped it at
the bottom of a title page.

1140
01:27:55,264 --> 01:27:58,038
Why on earth would you
put me on the phone with him?

1141
01:27:58,048 --> 01:28:01,621
The actors weren't hard
to find in a city full of starving artists.

1142
01:28:01,631 --> 01:28:03,631
Hi.

1143
01:28:03,648 --> 01:28:05,046
Hard to believe
what they would do

1144
01:28:05,056 --> 01:28:06,997
to show the extent
of their talent.

1145
01:28:07,007 --> 01:28:08,438
Soll?

1146
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:12,613
I'm coming to your place
as soon as I'm done here.

1147
01:28:14,017 --> 01:28:19,457
Poor bastards had no idea
what they were getting themselves into.

1148
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:22,325
Hey-- Hey, Ellsworth,
how are you?

1149
01:28:22,335 --> 01:28:25,460
The irony of it was that
it was all his idea really.

1150
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:28,105
She did exactly
as he suggested.

1151
01:28:28,127 --> 01:28:29,493
[Woman laughing]

1152
01:28:29,503 --> 01:28:31,190
David:
Call somebody at The New Yorker.

1153
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,205
I got some renewal thing.

1154
01:28:33,215 --> 01:28:34,229
Rebecca:
He's a writer.

1155
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:35,733
The one that you told
to write a story

1156
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:37,365
about himself writing a story.

1157
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:39,669
Rebecca [Narrating]:
And that's exactly what she did.

1158
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:43,705
She wrote a story
about herself writing a story.

1159
01:28:46,559 --> 01:28:49,557
All that was left
was to follow his own words.

1160
01:28:49,567 --> 01:28:53,141
The advice she'd hear
him scream countless times.

1161
01:28:53,151 --> 01:28:55,125
Make. Me.

1162
01:28:55,135 --> 01:28:57,207
- Make me care.
- Care.

1163
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:00,724
Man:
Find what you need, sweetheart?

1164
01:29:00,734 --> 01:29:02,734
Oh, yes, thank you.

1165
01:29:08,574 --> 01:29:11,957
Renting a place
across the street made it easy.

1166
01:29:11,967 --> 01:29:13,812
She learned his every move.

1167
01:29:13,822 --> 01:29:17,588
- Predicted his every thought.

[Techno music playing over stereo]

1169
01:29:19,934 --> 01:29:22,100
Rebecca:
David? Oh, my God!

1170
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:24,372
I can't hear you. I'm in a club.

1171
01:29:24,382 --> 01:29:26,804
She knew there would be victims.

1172
01:29:26,814 --> 01:29:29,814
Victims he could have easily saved.

1173
01:29:29,917 --> 01:29:32,884
Victims of his own arrogance.

1174
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:36,662
And then...

1175
01:29:36,766 --> 01:29:38,806
with a stranger's hand,

1176
01:29:38,909 --> 01:29:40,909
she pushed him...

1177
01:29:40,989 --> 01:29:43,454
right onto the killing floor.

1178
01:30:06,653 --> 01:30:09,235
She would become
his number one client.

1179
01:30:09,245 --> 01:30:11,955
She'd call the shots
from her cabin in Maine

1180
01:30:11,965 --> 01:30:14,005
in her fucking bathrobe.

1181
01:30:15,165 --> 01:30:18,034
What happened next
was his choice.

1182
01:30:18,141 --> 01:30:22,331
But live or die,
they'd go together.
