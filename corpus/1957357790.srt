183
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,474
People, I will not sit here,

184
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,040
and let you denigrate
a three time MVP,

185
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,609
first ballot Hall of Famer,

186
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,107
with a .317 batting
average, 508 home runs,

187
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,120
and 1,345 RBIs.

188
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,282
Mays was better.

189
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,550
Bullshit! If The Rock hadn't
blown out his shoulder,

190
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,029
he woulda blown away
all of Mays' records!

191
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,503
If Mays hadn't played
in Candlestick Park...

192
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,771
Oh, gimme a break! If my aunt
had balls, she'd be my uncle!

193
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,030
Kirby, Kirby! Who was
better, Mays or Framaggio?

194
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,393
Mantle.

195
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,061
Anyway, I've invited The Rock

196
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,910
to come over here and
meet all of us this afternoon.

197
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,632
Oh no, I can't
meet anyone today.

198
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,880
I'm going to go take my friend

199
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,002
to her egg extraction.

200
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,214
Her what?

201
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,052
Well, see, my friend's
having problems conceiving,

202
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,143
and so she's gonna
get her eggs collected,

203
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,509
and then artificially seminated.

204
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,247
(stammers) Okay,
fine, fine, fine.

205
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,272
If you wanna go to an egg
hunt rather than meeting

206
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,034
the greatest ball player
of our generation...

207
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,419
Second best.

208
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,164
Boss, what makes you
think you're gonna take a guy

209
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,185
that struck out 3,000
times on the field,

210
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,994
and 4,000 times off
it, and get him work?

211
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,985
Just as there are
teflon politicians,

212
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,361
there are also teflon athletes.

213
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,400
The Rock happens
to be one of 'em.

214
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,725
In fact, I've already
lined up not one,

215
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,871
not two, but three

216
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,067
job offers.

217
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,308
(organ plays "Charge")

218
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,105
Thanks for the audition, Dick.

219
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,807
Hey, anything for The Rock.

220
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,799
- Ah, he appreciates it, too.
- Yeah, no problem.

221
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:03,047
Okay, Rock,

222
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,385
here's the way
this is gonna work.

223
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,247
You follow the
action on the monitor,

224
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,319
I'll do the play-by-play,

225
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,917
you do the color commentary

226
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,129
with some interesting anecdotes.

227
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,057
It's that simple.

228
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,964
You know, I'm, I'm
a little nervous, guys,

229
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,526
'cause I don't really relate
to today's ballplayers.

230
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:19,565
Both: Don't worry about
that. Don't worry about it...

231
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,372
The key here, the
key here, Rock, just...

232
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,774
Both: Be yourself.

233
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,695
Dick: Just be yourself.

234
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,929
That's the best way to do it.

235
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,171
Let's try one, and let's roll.

236
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,635
- He's gonna be great.
- Okay.

237
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,937
Glassine pitches to Hundley,

238
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,138
and it's a line drive to
left field for a base hit.

239
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,280
Gilkey rounds third,
heading for home.

240
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,306
Here's Klesko's
throw. Gilkey slides,

241
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,251
and he's out at the plate!

242
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,088
That was a great
throw by Klesko!

243
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,394
You had a great arm!

244
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,360
Well, thanks, but, uh,

245
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,025
my arm was much
stronger than fat boy here.

246
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,755
(chuckle) You remember
when I picked McCarver's ass

247
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,371
off second in the Series?

248
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,772
See, I was playing right field,

249
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,174
and Brock hit a single,
and I threw behind him...

250
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,046
Well, you had a great arm,
Rock, no question about it.

251
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,841
But, the way Klesko is hitting,

252
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:03,606
someday he may approach
some of your records.

253
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,406
Well, sure, but that's because
today's pitching's for shit.

254
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,713
See, first of all,

255
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,048
they bring these
kids up to the bigs

256
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,487
before their nuts have dropped.

257
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:15,091
And then, these aluminum
bats are for pussies.

258
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,564
And, worst of all,

259
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,332
the strike zone
is a fucking joke.

260
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,232
There are these
band-box ballparks, and...

261
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:23,764
L-Look at this guy.

262
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,799
I mean, h-he makes
3,000,000 dollars,

263
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,665
he's, he's not even running!

264

Look at those lines!

269
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,853
Yeah, look at it.
It's not even moving.

270
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,952
He's been here two
hours, signed six cards,

271
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,354
and taken seven breaks!

272
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,376
Eh, it just takes him a
little while to get going.

273
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,792
- Thanks.
- (sigh)

274
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:51,194
Hey, Rock. I told my
son you were my idol.

275

story about you.

Hello, Rock.

Hi, son.

279
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,334
Now remember,

Yeah, look at him!

284
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:07,882
If he breathes on him again,

285
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:08,907
he'll turn to stone!

286
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,081
Baseball misses you, Rock.

287
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,782

get back into the game?

288

Not interested.

289
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,246
Can't relate to today's players.

290
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,924
I told my son about every
home run you ever hit.

291
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,993
I even told him about the time

292
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,648
you hit a buck 98
in the '63 series.

293

00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,543
It's the great
American wet dream!

536
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,265
This is unbelievable.

537
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,680
Why?

538
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,791
Doesn't your friend pay
for the sperm for her in vitro?

539
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,750
Uh, maybe a little.

540
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,752
Not 5,000 dollars.

541
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,354
Well, maybe if she
paid a little more,

542
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,616
she'd give birth to a
future Hall of Famer.

543
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,485
(scoff) I can't believe
that you talked

544
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,423
Rocky Framaggio into doing this.

545
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:44,658
Stanley: Rita...

546
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,333
Both: You never have
to talk men into doing this.

547
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,203
Here it is.

548
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,395
All Pac-10,

549
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,466
all American,

550
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,440
and there's plenty more
where that came from.

551
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,774
Ew, I don't have to be here.

552
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,149
Oh, just 'cause you
haven't gotten any

553
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,684
since the Carter administration!

554
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,212
(laugh) No, Kirby. It's because

555
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,507
I have high standards
when it comes to men.

556
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,749
All you need is an
inflatable doll with a pulse.

557
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,275
Yeah, right, that's why you
sit at home on Friday nights,

558
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,551
watching the Lifetime
channel with your cats!

559
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,694
Why does the idea of

560
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,815
getting pregnant without
having to deal with men

561
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,830
suddenly seem so appealing?

562
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:21,892
(clicks tongue)

563
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:25,732
Wait a minute...

564
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,567
they make 'em with pulses now?

565
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,073
Oh shit!

566
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,774
I have to call Wilt by 6:00.

567
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,014
♪ ♪

568
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:34,972
Um...

569
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,740
Arliss, we gotta talk.

570
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,747
Man to man.

571
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,051
Yeah, sure.

572
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,647
What's the matter?

573
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:44,725
You're healing pretty good.

574
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,050
It's the first time in a while

575
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,358
I haven't seen you looking
like George Chuvalo. (chuckle)

576
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,120
(chuckle) Um, well see,

577
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,228
Cheetah's been training
for the Betty Clocker fight.

578
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:55,828
No sex for two weeks.

579
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,864
You know, and I got this
massive case of blue balls.

580
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:00,872
Yeah...

581
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:02,532
You know, I love Cheetah.

582
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,681
But, to tell you the truth,

583
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,395
I hope she gets knocked out.

584
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,540
What?

585
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,405
I mean, I-I-I don't want
her to get hurt. I just...

586
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,384
I hope she loses
the fight, for my sake.

587
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,743
You know? Because if she wins

588
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,781
this fight, she's liable
to get a title shot.

589
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:16,677
I mean (laughs),

590
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,978
I might not get any
pussy for a year!

591
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,691
(chuckles) Phew!

592
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,290
Yeah...

593
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,285
Yeah, yeah.

594
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,757
Um...

595
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,830
I don't know what to tell you.

596
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,025
Uh...

597
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,800
(chuckle) That's okay.

598
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,505
You know, it's just...
It feels good to...

599
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,738
be able to talk about it.

600
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,403
That's what I'm here for.

601
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,705
(back slapping)

602
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,184
Do you know what
time he'll be back?

603
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,150
It's a rather personal matter.

604
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,345
Uh, could you tell him,

605
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,316
or whoever
represents Mr. Costner

606
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,985
to get in touch with Arliss
Michaels Management?

607
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,489
No, we're not a film management.

608
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,927
We represent athletes,

609
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:02,991
but we have a very interesting
proposition for Mr. Costner.

610
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,132
Yes.

611
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,697
Rita Wu.

612
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,195
Thank you.

613
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,806
- What is this?
- Uh, hey, that's, that's per...

614
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:10,735
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

615
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,472
Denzel Washington, Yo-Yo Ma,

616
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,307
George Stephanopoulos,
Tom Selleck, Jim Carrey?

617
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:17,413
My friend heard about your
service, and she thought,

618
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,612
why an anonymous donor?
Why not a made-to-order man?

619
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,378
Your friend has
quite a wish list!

620
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,516
Yeah, well, she tends to favor

621
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,717
intellectual aptitude,
taste, and talent.

622
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,783
Your friend?

623
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:26,747
My friend.

624
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:27,948
(phone ringing)

625
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,794
Arliss Michaels Management.

626
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,016
Yeah, one second.

627
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,160
It's your trainer.

628
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,485
Uh, schedule me a cardiovascular
workout for Thursday.

629
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,640
No, not your personal trainer.

630
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:38,261
Your horse trainer.

631
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,560
(snorts like a horse)

632
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,233
What?

633
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,937
Arliss: He's sterile!?

634
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,772
He sure is.

635
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,567
He's packing less ammo
than a conscientious objector.

636
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,380
Are you sure?

637
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,542
Wait! He's only been
with mares, right?

638
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,911
Maybe he's into stallions?

639
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,110
(chuckles) Sorry.

640
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,481
Infertile is as infertile does.

641
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,750
Wha...

642
00:22:01,052 --> 00:22:02,552
Bye bye, guy.

643
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,986
You know, when Khrushchev
came to this country back in '58,

644
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,734
you know who he told
Ike he wanted to meet?

645
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,574
Mickey Mouse,

646
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,272
Kim Novak,

647
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,233
and me.

648
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,271
(chuckles)

649
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:19,766
How come you're not at the lab?

650
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,138
That's why I'm
here, Arliss. Uh...

651
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,937
We have to talk.

652
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,109
I can't do it anymore.

653
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:27,778
Oh, sure you can!

654
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:28,953
I got you that new video.

655
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,954
"Sex Trek, The
Next Penetration."

656
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,846
(laughs) No, it's
not the problem.

657
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,988
I-I just need to pull
out of our little venture.

658
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,024
Pull out? You're joking!

659
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:39,419
Rock, you're okay, aren't you?

660
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,196
I used to say I didn't
want a job in baseball

661
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,431
because I couldn't
relate to today's players,

662
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,497
but that was bullshit.

663
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,125
I called every club and
asked for a job, and...

664
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,441
none of them would
gimme a chance

665
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:52,668
because they knew
I'd show up drunk.

666
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:54,667
Well, I guess after
seeing the TV thing,

667
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:56,139
somebody in New York must've

668
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,538
felt sorry for me or something

669
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,709
'cause I got a call
from the big club

670
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,078
telling me they'd give me a shot

671
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,346
as a hitting instructor.

672
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,584
That is if I stay clean.

673
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,049
New York?

674
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:07,147
Yeah.

675
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,719
That's great! That's great!

676
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,658
Well, it may be my last chance.

677
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,634
I don't wanna mess
it up, except I...

678
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,063
Except what?

679
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,799
Well, except, I'm
a little scared about

680
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,125
checking into a clinic.

681
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,673
The Rock in rehab.

682
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,535
Shit. (chuckles)

683
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:26,644
What'll people think?

684
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,539
I think it might help
a lot of other people.

685
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,014
Well, maybe. (chuckles)

686
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,109
Oh, one more thing.

687
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,210
No, no, no.

688
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,721
I'll pay for it.

689
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:39,282
I'll make it part of your deal.

690
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:41,845
You'll still make my deal?

691
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:43,954
On the house!

692
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,629
Hell, I'm not gonna
let you trust an agent!

693
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,657
(snorts, laughs)

694
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,100
Thanks.

695
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:51,331
Oh, I...

696
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:52,556
I brought you something.

697
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:55,428
("Chinatown" theme plays)

698
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,670
I don't know if you
were really in the ballpark

699
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,296
on that day or not, but...

700
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,072
that was. (chuckle)

701
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,810
That's my 500th home run ball.

702
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,905
Thanks.

703
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,250
No, thank you.

704
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,245
You...

705
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,976
Really helped me a
lot when I needed it.

706
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,192
Was that you?

707
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,153
Oh, hell.

708
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,791
I meant to call you,
but I forgot your number.

709
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,257
(chuckles)

710
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,364
It's nine.

711
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,027
Good bye, kid.

712
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,439
Arliss: For most us,

713
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,744
the dream of becoming a champion

714
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,676
remains a fantasy.

715
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,841
But for a special few,

716
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,280
it is very much a reality.

717
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,876
We cheer them.

718
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,178
We live through them.

719
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,449
Athletes are our last warriors.

720
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,822
Alright! Yes!

721
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,157
Two. Three.

722
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:52,061
Stay down! Stay down,
honey. Stay down.

723
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,473
- Stay down.
- That's it. That's it.

724
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,091
She's out! She's out!

725
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,590
Yes! Yes!

726
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,231
We leased equipment,

727
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,896
not to mention
refunding our receipts

728
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,425
from the shopping network.

729
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,539
And what are we supposed to do

730
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,897
with 200 sperm decanters?

731
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,199
Use them as jelly jars?

732
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,470
Spit cups for chewing tobacco?

733
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,839
Jesus Christ, we're out
of pocket 50 grand at least!

734
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,708
(music continues)

735
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,659
(knocking)

736
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,001
I'm leaving.

737
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,395
Oh, okay. Have a good night.

738
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,098
Are you okay?

739
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,739
Fine!

740
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,636
Arliss, you are such a fan.

741
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,352
(crowd murmuring)

742
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:53,254
Announcer: Rocky's been stuck on
home run number 499 for almost a week.

743
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,518
Pascual gets the
sign. Here's the pitch.

744
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:56,817
(bat hitting ball)

745
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,888
There's a long drive,
deep to right, way back.

746
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,328
Arliss: My name
is Arliss Michaels.

747
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,404
I represent athletes.

748
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,772
These are my stories.

749
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:10,971
Announcer: Holy cow, Rocky Framaggio
has just hit home run number 500.

750
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,866
And this crowd is going crazy.

751
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:14,437
They're fighting for the ball.

752
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,166
And some youngster's
gonna have himself

753
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,781
one heck of a souvenir.

754
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,812
(crowd noise fades)

755
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,878
