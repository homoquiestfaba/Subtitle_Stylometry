1
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,612
Yes?

2
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,716
How long?

3
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,163
Let me help you.

4
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,468
All right.

5
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,003
<i>- I'm not...</i>
- -<i> I'm trusting you now.</i>

6
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,739
<i>This is... this is...
you know...</i>

7
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,574
<i>husband and wife kind of...</i>

8
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,243
<i>Look at that.</i>

9
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,411
Look at all this juicy juice.

10
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,447
Cut it all off.

11
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,415
Wait, stop.
Stop smiling for a second.

12
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,918
- Okay. -I just wanna
comb your mustache.

13
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,625
<i>Are you excited
to meet Roger Payne?</i>

14
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,126
<i>Yeah, I'm very excited.</i>

15
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,395
- <i> Real live man,  Roger Payne.
- </i> -<i> I'm nervous.</i>

16
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,397
What're you nervous about?

17
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,433
For this week, for tomorrow.

18
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:52,137
<i>Darling, nobody's expecting you
to be some kind of expert--</i>

19
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,705
You don't expect me.

20
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,240
- No, no...
- I expect them to be.

21
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,575
Why shouldn't they
expect me to be?

22
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,076
Well, they are experts.

23
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,445
<i>You're a writer.</i>

24
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,317
I'm kinda nervous about
the book too, you know.

25
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,885
- Really?
- -<i> Well, I mean...</i>

26
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,321
<i>What do most couples do
on a honeymoon anyways?</i>

27
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,156
<i>They stay in their room, right?</i>

28
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,318
All we need is a bed.

29
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,061
Or desk.

30
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,063
Or a chair with a floor.

31
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,435
<i>You know what,
do you want me to go quickly</i>

32
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,636
<i>or do you want me
to do a good job?</i>

33
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,138
<i>I want you to do
a really good job.</i>

34
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,906
<i>- That's what I thought.
- And do it quickly.</i>

35
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,141
Look up.

36
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,103
How's it feel to be married?

37
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,264
<i>January 19th.</i>

38
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,967
<i>Fifty four degrees south.</i>

39
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,740
<i>I swear, Argentina already feels
like the bottom of the world.</i>

40
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,857
<i>But it's where the journey
begins for most explorers.</i>

41
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,649
<i>What draws us here?</i>

42
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,439
<i>For Dr. Payne, it's the
siren call of the whales.</i>

43
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,792
<i>He was the first to hear
their songs as songs.</i>

44
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,962
<i>The first to record them.</i>

45
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,365
<i>We're following
their migration south,</i>

46
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,300
<i>before the Antarctic
winter sets in.</i>

47
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,437
<i>It's mostly scientists,</i>

48
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,805
<i>but there are few others.</i>

49
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:35,874
<i>Family,</i>

50
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,542
<i>friends,</i>

51
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,611
<i>and us.</i>

52
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,017
Seriously, it's one of
the roughest seas in the world.

53
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,038
- Really?
- Yeah.

54
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:49,888
Whoa.

55
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,490
- What?
- -There he is.

56
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,658
That's Roger Payne.

57
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,660
He brought
his wife with him too?

58
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:57,102
Yeah, that's his wife, Lisa.

59
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,668
- Right at the red light.
- Right, right, right.

60
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,036
And then take a left.

61
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,238
Okay.

62
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,372
Follow the arrows.

63
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,042
Don't, don't just
follow the arrows.

64
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:13,078
- The arrows don't lead directly to the room.
-Oh, this way.

65
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,846
Okay, this looks better.

66
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,351
- Bed and...
- The honeymoon suite.

67
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,789
Bunk beds.

68
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,924
It's bunk beds.

69
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,226
No one gets bunk beds.

70
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,464
Look at that.

71
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,466
Is that another person's room?

72
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,801
Probably not.

73
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,904
Yes, it is.

74
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,672
So we're sharing
the bathroom, huh?

75
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,973
With a stranger.

76
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:42,974
Very luxurious...

77
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,544
It'll just be you, me,
and a stranger.

78
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,012
I'm so sorry, babe.

79
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,380
It's fine.

80
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,682
But if we are staying
in this room,

81
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,250
then I get the top bunk.

82
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,686
Yeah.

83
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,789
<i>Come here, silly. Come here.</i>

84
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,666
Gather round, please.

85
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:45,337
If you could please move a little
forward, that's it, thanks.

86
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,506
Okay, welcome to your life boat.

87
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:50,742
This will be our baby
in the glaciers

88
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,879
if we need to get off the ship
very, very fast.

89
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:59,751
Inside, it has food, water,
even sea-sickness tablets.

90
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:04,256
Everything we need is right here.
Radio transponders

91
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:10,529
and fishing lines, whatever you can
imagine, is right inside this boat.

92
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,064
Even it has food
and such things.

93
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:16,735
We have more than enough food
for everyone on board.

94
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,674
If we die when this ship
goes down, it's your fault.

95
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,544
Okay, I'll take
full responsibly.

96
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,507
Just lay on top.

97
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,216
We'll spend a few days,

98
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,052
go out the Beagle Channel
and actually go north,

99
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,388
north east through
the straits of Lemaire.

100
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,391
We're gonna go up here,
come off the continental shelf

101
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,792
into the deep water,

102
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,761
and do about 800 miles

103
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,563
across the southern ocean

104
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:35,266
towards the very northern tip
of the Antarctic peninsula.

105
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,236
If we can, we'll get
into the Weddell Sea.

106
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,571
This is where
Shackleton got stuck.

107
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,006
This is where
Shackleton got stuck.

108
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:45,577
The Weddell Sea is the heart
of the largest area of pack ice

109
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,546
that's generated anywhere
around the Antarctic.

110
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,746
The songs of humpback whales
were more beautiful then,

111
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:26,251
in the same years that The Beatles
were writing songs, than they are now.

112
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,786
They were more evocative.

113
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,954
They brought tears to your eyes.

114
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,723
I don't think
they do that anymore.

115
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:32,824
But they did that.

116
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,292
Why? Why could that be?

117
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,694
I have no idea.

118
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:39,097
Isn't it true that if you speed up
the sound of the humpback whale

119
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,099
that it actually sounds
little bit like a birdsong?

120
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,769
It does, it actually sounds a lot like,
if you slow it down, a birdsong.

121
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,771
It says, "Paul is dead."

122
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:14,759
Hey.

123
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,529
Where are you going?

124
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,830
I'm just going upstairs.

125
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,001
Okay. I'll come with you.

126
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,204
No. No, stay. Sleep, sleep.

127
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,706
You look so beautiful.
Go back to sleep.

128
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,675
What are you gonna go do?

129
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,210
I'm gonna go talk to Roger.

130
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,045
Just work stuff. It's boring.

131
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,580
- Okay.
- Okay.

132
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,283
I'll be back soon.

133
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,785
Love you.

134
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,661
This was a symbolic act to him
because his handkerchief

135
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:54,799
was one of two things he had that reminded
him that he'd once been a civilized man.

136
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,081
The other thing...

137
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:16,648
There's something about these
penguin couples that's so domestic.

138
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:22,353
They groom each other,
they smack each other, they...

139
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,722
They hold hands
while they're walking.

140
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,693
Or make babies.

141
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,133
Okay.

142
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,601
What're you trying to say?

143
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,404
Nothing.

144
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,973
We would probably
make cute babies though.

145
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,138
<i>February 3rd.</i>

146
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,740
<i>Sixty two degrees south.</i>

147
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,810
<i>The details of home</i>

148
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,678
<i>fall away.</i>

149
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,881
<i>Out here,</i>

150
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,550
<i>there's no Sunday or Monday.</i>

151
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,620
<i>No balance between
day and night.</i>

152
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:37,996
<i>A kind of prolonged twilight
sets in the further south we go.</i>

153
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,868
<i>This is it.</i>

154
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,373
<i>The world falls away.</i>

155
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,843
<i>There really is
no second chance.</i>

156
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,849
Oh shit. We're late.

157
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,551
It's fine, sweetheart.

158
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,721
Well, it's fine, but it's
not, you know, perfect

159
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,723
because they're gonna be
sitting up there waiting for us.

160
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,260
No, I think dinner on this
boat is a very fluid thing.

161
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,561
Hey, relax.

162
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,831
Why don't you go
pull the car around?

163
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,767
Look, I'm gonna go up and I'm
gonna keep them company, okay?

164
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,402
Five minutes, okay?

165
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,670
I'll see you up there.

166
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,818
Me, again.

167
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,100
What do you want?

168
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,023
I want my wife.

169
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,298
Just go up without me, okay?

170
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,699
Don't wait for me.

171
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,703
Okay.

172
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,640
See you up there.

173
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,151
...thing that he can
take from the land.

174
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,320
And also on a bit of
a hunting expedition

175
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,554
which is his pastime.

176
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,290
And while he is there
he is, uh...

177
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:51,429
confronted by nature and also by
what's left of his capitalist soul.

178
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,900
But I also think that
the explorer represents

179
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,736
someone who is still at least
in touch with the natural world.

180
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,939
And someone who is going out to
cross or to walk to the South Pole

181
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:05,376
is someone who has the opportunity
to experience something

182
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,844
bigger than themselves.

183
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,080
And that has value.
Don't you think?

184
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:12,416
But they're always men, I mean,
these people, why is that?

185
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,985
No, no, I don't think
they're always men.

186
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,187
They're almost always men,
I would have to agree

187
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:23,628
and there is a lot of it that's devoted to
this obsession with geographical prizes.

188
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,396
I find that
a bit tiresome, you know.

189
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:30,968
Then, you'd need more and more modifiers
to describe what this is a first of.

190
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,940
Would you try to attract media
attention to whale research

191
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,643
and to coral and
acidification of the ocean?

192
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,578
Awareness is important,
very important.

193
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,450
And I've tried to attract it to, in a way
that is concerned with solving that problem.

194
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,985
See you guys later.

195
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,421
And the problem of an that
explorer is to just get there

196
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,857
and then say that
he or she has been there.

197
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:57,628
And I've never quite understood
that fully, I mean...

198
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,797
<i>I, you know, Columbus didn't...</i>

199
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,697
<i>Going to Antarctica?</i>

200
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,699
Yeah, it's good.

201
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,167
- It's exciting.
- What about our honeymoon?

202
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,568
Well, that is our honeymoon.

203
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,620
<i>To, um...</i>

204
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,923
<i>Adventure Antarctica</i>

205
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,324
<i>and your work.</i>

206
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:04,262
To writing about a place and then
getting the opportunity to go there.

207
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,593
That's really interesting.

208
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,361
So they actually land or
do they just swoop down--

209
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:41,165
No, no, they land. They do this
thousands of times, they enlarge wounds

210
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:44,201
until you get a whale which has, I
don't know, six or eight wounds

211
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:46,504
- down its middle.
- It's a good way to put it.

212
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:49,607
Collecting places,
collecting locations.

213
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,575
We're obsessed
with categorizing and...

214
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:54,445
They will fly down,
land on the back of the whale,

215
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:56,614
bite a hole in the whale,

216
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,382
and then fly off
with a hunk of meat.

217
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:01,385
You don't usually accompany Roger
on his trips though, right?

218
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:02,753
No, no, I don't.

219
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:05,589
I've been once to Patagonia
where he goes every year.

220
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,291
For his Right Whale study.

221
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,093
And I was feeling miserable.

222
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,163
The sun never shone.

223
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,464
It was windy.

224
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,099
I feel a bit, uh...

225
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,468
You know, out of place.

226
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,305
And, um, all the more so
because Peter seems

227
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,374
very much in his element

228
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,043
and I sometimes feel like
I don't know where to fit into.

229
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:29,880
But, you know, it's all well and
good, We're having a good time.

230
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,494
Oh, God.

231
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,064
Doctor?

232
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,565
Hello.

233
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:02,833
Take a seat, please.

234
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,772
Oh.

235
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,111
Relax. Just relax.

236
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:33,197
Yeah. And is this a path
of where whales feed?

237
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,366
Like, you were pointing out
to me the...

238
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,950
Ah, that's not bad.

239
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:40,824
I mean, let's face it, we don't
often get a chance to see this.

240
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:45,663
Hey, there you are.

241
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,744
See the whales?

242
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:49,900
Yeah, I saw them.

243
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,168
It was beautiful.

244
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,172
Why didn't you come get me?

245
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,041
Babe.

246
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,779
Roger went through an entire
book about Antarctic pattern.

247
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:05,215
Page after page. What am I gonna do?
Interrupt him in the middle?

248
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,617
I'm glad you're here though.

249
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,019
I'm glad you got to see them.

250
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:35,012
Um, I wanna sit
at the table with Roger,

251
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:37,681
before the seat's taken.
Can we go in?

252
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:38,949
- Can we go in?
- Okay.

253
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,250
Okay, come on.

254
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,019
Yeah?

255
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,555
You know, you go,
save me a seat, though.

256
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,292
- Are you sure?
- Will you save me a seat?

257
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:49,560
I'll save you a seat.

258
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:09,480
You think it can make any difference that
the sound was at this end of the boat

259
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:11,181
and the engines were
at this end of the boat

260
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,751
and the whales were
possibly out here?

261
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:17,154
The engines are not the source
that makes the loud noise.

262
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,555
It's the propeller itself.

263
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:21,925
Oh, okay. So, if we were
in a small boat...

264
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,861
I've read that chapter
of your book

265
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:27,097
and in the 60s, weren't you lying down
in your boat listening to them at night?

266
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,768
Oh, yeah, that's with everything
turned off, and that's a sailboat.

267
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,302
Right.

268
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:35,305
I think probably they did hear it.
They could have heard

269
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:38,509
some of which you were doing,
very, very faintly.

270
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:41,211
The other trouble is, the
moment we're asking to hear it

271
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,881
is just as part of its head
is breaking the surface.

272
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:46,116
And that's generating
a lot of noise.

273
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,952
So, I mean the conditions are...

274
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,687
No, no, it's good,
it's good, I like it.

275
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:53,290
The conditions are
certainly not favorable...

276
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,592
- Yeah.
- ...for the possibility.

277
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:59,663
If everything was completely quiet and
stopped and we're not moving forward

278
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:03,500
and we were in some little harbor somewhere
away from the ocean traffic noises...

279
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,439
Lighter trouble?

280
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,977
Pretty much always.

281
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:56,446
I thought there was
no smoking on this boat.

282
00:31:58,616 --> 00:31:59,896
I didn't hear that.

283
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,555
I'm... I'm Chloe.

284
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,391
Chloe Harrison.

285
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,193
Captain Emerson.

286
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,681
Well, I probably shouldn't
be smoking anyway.

287
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,418
Why is that, I mean,

288
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,887
aside from the obvious?

289
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,537
<i>The black and white
is their camouflage</i>

290
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:56,640
<i>in this fairly gray,
black-white environment.</i>

291
00:32:56,642 --> 00:33:00,911
And if one adult
walks away from its nest

292
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:04,948
and leaves the egg exposed,
and a skua comes in,

293
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,618
the immediate birds right next
to it might peck at the skua.

294
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,187
But they're not
getting off their egg.

295
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:13,423
So, if you were dumb enough to
get off your egg, tough luck.

296
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:16,727
These guys actually do lay
two eggs, these rockhoppers.

297
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:21,231
...what attracts them, and sometimes
they just have minutes to eat

298
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,434
then bigger vultures
come and kick them out...

299
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,913
Look at them up there.

300
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,649
Chatting away.

301
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:42,853
Peter's really enjoying
being here. I can tell.

302
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,625
Probably getting in to practice
for his next big journey.

303
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,294
Good place to start.

304
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,898
You and Roger have
such a great...

305
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,700
rapport.

306
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,738
Yeah, well, that's, um, 'cause
we've been married a long time.

307
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,907
You'll be there soon,
you wait.

308
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,844
What are you going to do
when, um...

309
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:11,286
when Peter goes off on this next
big venture he's going to have?

310
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,884
- Which one?
- Oh, the book deal.

311
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,352
Walking to the poles.

312
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,860
Next year.

313
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:20,991
Book deal?

314
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,274
You know about this, don't you?

315
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,699
Book deal, yeah, it's uh...

316
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,637
It's great.

317
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,744
Um...

318
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,081
I think I'm gonna
go back to the boat.

319
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,186
So I'll see you back there later.
Whoo!

320
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:49,579
Hey.

321
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,848
Hey. I need to talk to you.

322
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:52,983
Um...

323
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,938
Is there any way to
get off this boat?

324
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,390
Uh... no.

325
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:02,592
We're underway
in about 15 minutes.

326
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,770
I need a... I need a room.
I need a different room.

327
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,439
I need a new room.

328
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,711
We, uh, we don't have
any spare cabins.

329
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,529
Listen,

330
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,498
I'll have a word
with the steward.

331
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,700
Maybe we can
move somebody around.

332
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,504
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

333
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:09,526
Chloe?

334
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,734
What the fuck?

335
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,006
Chloe?

336
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,447
Chloe?

337
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:31,815
What is going on?

338
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:34,150
Hey, don't ignore me.
What's going on?

339
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,686
Where'd you go?

340
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:40,357
I come back and
all your stuff is missing?

341
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:42,125
Why are you
treating me like this?

342
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,650
When were you gonna tell me?

343
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,903
About the book deal?

344
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,043
Were you just gonna wait
until you were already gone

345
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:01,325
to tell me about it?

346
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,648
I made a mistake.

347
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,182
Do you know what it feels like

348
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:09,944
to find out about something
like that from somebody else?

349
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,489
I mean, how could you?

350
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,971
How dare you not...

351
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,993
tell me first?

352
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,630
It involves me.

353
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:25,001
How do you think that you
going away for a whole year

354
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:29,239
doesn't involve me directly
enough to ask me about it?

355
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:31,841
Right, no,
that makes total sense.

356
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:33,143
I didn't wanna tell anyone else.

357
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,545
Lisa and Roger asked me
what my next project--

358
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:37,213
It doesn't matter.

359
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,949
It's about the fact that you
wouldn't even discuss it with me.

360
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,484
I was gonna discuss it with you.

361
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,287
You were gonna... You know what?
It's too fucking late!

362
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,923
- Yeah, because they asked me--
- It's too late!

363
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,925
You know when you should've
discussed it with me?

364
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,727
Before you told
other people about it.

365
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:52,962
Well, they asked me what my next
piece of work was gonna be.

366
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:55,665
What am I gonna say, "I got
nothin' I'm working on."

367
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,067
And you know what,
this really sucks

368
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:58,702
'cause I was gonna
surprise you with it

369
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,970
because you're gonna be
a huge fucking part of it.

370
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:02,372
A huge part of it.

371
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:05,175
Remember Scott, in his last days,
how he wrote letters to his wife.

372
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,343
We were gonna do that.

373
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,585
Scott died in Antarctica.

374
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,781
I don't even factor...

375
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,484
- into your...
- Oh, babe.

376
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,319
Stop. Stop it!

377
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:17,687
Honey, just stop.

378
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,923
Stop. God! Peter!

379
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,892
You don't even see me!

380
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,857
Yeah, I just don't know
how this is gonna work.

381
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,672
Really?

382
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,075
Really, that's how you feel?

383
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,381
Can I just talk for a second?

384
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:46,216
Can I just... Can we
just back up?

385
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:49,352
Because things have gotten
a little bit extreme.

386
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,788
I'm really, really sorry

387
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,358
that you found out about this and that you
feel that I was deceiving you in any way.

388
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,394
But, please...

389
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,729
Chloe, it's not what you think.

390
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,811
I don't know what I want.

391
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,402
I just know that I need space.

392
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:11,508
Come on.

393
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,042
I need space.

394
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,445
Just give me that.

395
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,360
Chlo...

396
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,262
Chloe.

397
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,790
Oh, yeah, you're right.

398
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,758
Your move?

399
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,794
Yeah, no. Yeah it is.

400
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:39,896
Oh, no, no.

401
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,303
Um...

402
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:50,039
It's your turn still.
You have another, um...

403
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,008
Perfect, perfect.
So I can use that...

404
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,076
Hey.

405
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,143
Hey.

406
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,014
Um... I think you have
another move.

407
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,516
I need to talk to you, okay?

408
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:01,184
Look.

409
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,919
I'm in the middle
of something right now.

410
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:05,822
I wanna talk to you too,
but we'll do it later, okay?

411
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,061
Is that your move?

412
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,796
Yeah, that one's blocking...

413
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,058
Hey, Chloe.

414
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,460
Hey.

415
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,409
Did you do that?

416
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,164
Yeah.

417
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,833
That's beautiful.

418
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:53,269
- Thank you.
- Yeah, looks just like Jaime.

419
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,439
- You think?
- Yeah, I do.

420
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:57,640
He must've been thrilled.

421
00:42:57,642 --> 00:42:59,542
Yeah, I think he liked it.

422
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:00,877
I think I'm gonna
give it to him.

423
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:02,745
Good. Good.

424
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,280
Anyway, I have to go.

425
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,683
Okay.

426
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:02,639
Small.

427
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:09,946
Backwards?

428
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:28,231
Yes.

429
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,267
Good job.

430
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,572
Who's next?

431
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:38,107
John's next.

432
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:37,333
- Farm boy?
- Yeah, farm boy.

433
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:38,495
Landlocked.

434
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,737
That's right.

435
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:44,340
Landlocked farm boy
ends up at sea.

436
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:48,745
Well, I shouldn't think it was
the first time it's happened.

437
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:50,747
Hmm.

438
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,649
Ever married?

439
00:45:58,188 --> 00:45:59,255
Yeah.

440
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:03,326
I was, once.

441
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,330
What was her name?

442
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:12,101
Doesn't really matter,
does it? I...

443
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,372
Not anymore.

444
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:55,545
I can't...

445
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:26,442
Come in.

446
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,745
It's me. Can I still come in?

447
00:47:29,747 --> 00:47:31,581
Sure.

448
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,483
- Can I sit down?
- Yeah, what's up?

449
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:37,053
Just wanted to chat.

450
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:38,335
About what?

451
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:40,523
Just missed you.

452
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,962
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's...

453
00:47:45,964 --> 00:47:47,296
Everything's fine.

454
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,504
- I feel I owe you an explanation.
- Okay.

455
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:59,075
Things got a little bit
out of control earlier.

456
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:01,344
It was just
a big misunderstanding.

457
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,579
To be honest,

458
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:05,581
I think you over reacted before I
had a chance to really explain.

459
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:10,887
Look, Peter, did you come here to
apologize or tell me how to behave?

460
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:13,956
Chlo, can we just cut through
some of these problems

461
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:15,925
and deal with them
when we get home?

462
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:17,193
No.

463
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:18,527
Why not?

464
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,529
Well...

465
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:24,467
Because it's not
just about the book deal.

466
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:27,536
- Okay, I mean...
- Is that what you thought?

467
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:30,940
Oh, my God, Chloe, okay.
So what else is it about?

468
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,912
- Come here.
- Peter, come on.

469
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:39,115
- Come here.
- Stop it. Peter. Stop.

470
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:41,484
- Baby, I miss you so much.
- Peter!

471
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:43,753
I'm sorry, it doesn't
work like that.

472
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:47,356
I mean, let's be honest, you
didn't come in here to apologize.

473
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,025
You didn't come in here to say,

474
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:51,761
"Oh, I feel terrible, I want to
know what you're going through."

475
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:55,731
You think I'm being childish,
you think this is a game.

476
00:48:57,669 --> 00:49:00,436
You aren't going to trek
across the poles anyway.

477
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:03,906
What do you mean?

478
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:09,278
- What do you mean?
- You're a writer, Peter.

479
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,515
- So? -You won't be able
to write about the poles.

480
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:16,886
- Fuck you! -Crossing them yourself?
I mean...

481
00:49:16,888 --> 00:49:19,388
You don't think I see you, you
don't think I'm a good husband,

482
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,123
you don't think I can go
to the North or South Pole,

483
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,793
you don't have any fucking faith in me.
So what is this about?

484
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:25,695
Are you leaving me?
Is that what this is about?

485
00:49:25,697 --> 00:49:28,931
Are you leaving me? Just be honest?
Just, what's...

486
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,754
<i>They want me to go to Antarctica
for a few weeks, maybe a month.</i>

487
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,716
And I said,
"That's simply unacceptable,

488
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:22,785
I won't go anywhere
without my wife."

489
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,589
You said that?

490
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,593
Yeah.

491
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,146
Can I come in?

492
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,967
Chloe, are you okay?

493
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,777
Hey, come on, it's okay.

494
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,013
You're gonna be okay.

495
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:47,616
Let's go inside.

496
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:59,461
You're going to be sick.
Bathroom? Bed?

497
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,231
- Bed.
- Okay, here we go.

498
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,834
Okay, here.

499
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:08,771
Here, let's get this off.

500
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:42,945
<i>You pass through it,
you get on the other side,</i>

501
00:59:42,947 --> 00:59:47,849
and things are different. I...

502
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,586
You're just different.

503
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:56,091
Seems kind of lonely
out here. That's all.

504
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,528
Sometimes.

505
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:07,569
Do you ever get homesick?

506
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:15,010
You know, I do. I do.

507
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:20,916
But at some point, you have to
choose what's important to you.

508
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,385
And I made my choice.

509
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,699
From the point down to the end,
you can see the wind.

510
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:21,103
- Yeah. -There's another
pair of binoculars.

511
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:31,480
Beautiful scenery, breathtaking.

512
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:32,581
It is.

513
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,283
You never get tired of it.

514
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:37,919
You ever trekked through
a country like this?

515
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:41,022
Yeah, it can be tough.

516
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,995
What's the weather forecast,
the next few days?

517
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:48,497
It's good, it's nice.

518
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:50,665
Though I don't trust
the forecast.

519
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:54,603
It's like anything in life,
I guess, always changing, right?

520
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,206
Yeah, I suppose so.

521
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:01,009
So, what are we going to do? We're going to
go out through this passage, right here?

522
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:02,711
Yeah, right this way and around.

523
01:03:02,713 --> 01:03:06,281
We don't want to hose ourselves
into any new problems.

524
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:07,349
Yeah.

525
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:12,053
I trust that you will
steer clear of any danger.

526
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:16,391
I will.

527
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,626
- Hey.
- Hey.

528
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,562
- What's up?
- It's a good movie.

529
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,272
Brought you an apple.

530
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:47,542
You brought that for me?

531
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,818
I don't know,
I just brought it with me.

532
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:52,614
Um...

533
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:55,150
Thanks for taking care of me
the other night.

534
01:05:55,152 --> 01:05:56,584
You're welcome.

535
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:58,687
You're feeling better?

536
01:05:58,689 --> 01:06:00,588
Yeah, I feel much better.

537
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,227
You look great.

538
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:11,599
Thank you.

539
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:16,171
Well, I'm going to let you get
back to <i>Life In The Water.</i>

540
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:19,007
- You okay?
- Yeah!

541
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:20,308
Everything's fine.

542
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,610
I'm just going to go.

543
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:58,206
<i>Peter? Peter!</i>

544
01:08:28,572 --> 01:08:30,004
<i>I'm here, Chloe.</i>

545
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:24,492
Peter?

546
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:50,752
<i>The Poles have pulled at me
for as long as I can remember.</i>

547
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:56,591
<i>Ever since I was a kid, reading
about the great explorers.</i>

548
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:03,164
<i>Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott.</i>

549
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,069
<i>They were all drawn here.</i>

550
01:10:14,578 --> 01:10:17,111
<i>I don't know what
I was hoping to find.</i>

551
01:10:17,113 --> 01:10:18,613
<i>But it's not out here.</i>

552
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:21,916
<i>It's inside.</i>

553
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,253
<i>Just between us.</i>

554
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,190
<i>It's her.</i>

555
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,496
<i>It's us.</i>

556
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:42,237
<i>There's no book.</i>

557
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,240
<i>No walking to the poles.</i>

558
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:51,346
<i>It was just me
wanting to be something more.</i>

559
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,422
<i>And she's right.</i>

560
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:07,762
<i>I really didn't see her.</i>

561
01:11:15,338 --> 01:11:16,871
<i>But I want to.</i>

562
01:15:06,436 --> 01:15:08,102
<i>February 23rd.</i>

563
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:12,940
<i>Sixty eight degrees south.</i>

564
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:18,212
<i>Antarctic summer.</i>
