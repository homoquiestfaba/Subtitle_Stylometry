2
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:22,563
I soId my souI to the deviI,
the price was cheap.

3
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,858
It was coId on this IeveI,
it was twice as deep.

4
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,279
It's 2:00, I'm just about to hit the streets.

5
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,574
UntiI I knock off this rock, I don't get to eat.

6
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,202
Sometimes it's like that's
the onIy reason why I hustIe,

7
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,706
to step on toes, strong-arm
and show a little muscle.

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,460
Ain't no reaI dough,
that's why a nigga feeIs so frustrated.

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,129
I hate it seeing bitch niggas that made it.

10
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,132
And I'm robbin' niggas
just as broke as myseIf.

11
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,427
Fuckin' with Queens
ain't too good for a nigga's heaIth.

12
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,971
Where's the wealth? lt ain't in New York.

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,892
I gots to make my rounds
and do whatever for the dollar.

14
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,312
Fuck 'em. You know me. Charlie Grant.

Let's go, man! Get in the car, man!

lt was the best time of our lives.

18
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,081
Getting money was all we ever did.

19
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,043
Niggas Ioved the wee hours.

Me and Bundy, Bunds that is,

00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,895
We, Iike, make it happen.

26
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,773
Since kids,
we was like Butch and Sundance.

27
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,402
Outlaw niggas,
doing anything to get the dough.

28

We in the diamonds, yo.
Tonight we're celebratin'.

30
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,033
What the fuck would Knowledge

31
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,661
-All right, all right.
-Man, shut the fuck up.

32
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,914
Listen, Mark, you dump the car.
You know what l'm sayin'?

33
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,042
Mark, too.
He was the "whatever" type nigga.

34
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,629
The type of nigga that wouId do anything
at any given time.

35
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,132
A live wire.
You need niggas Iike that around.

36
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,634
-Dump that motherfucker.
-All right. Shut the fuck up, man.

37
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,720
BIack. He was just some dumb-ass nigga

38
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,514
we used to smoke trees with
and crackjokes on.

39
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:11,059
I knew he was a fuckin' probIem
as soon as KnowIedge put him down.

40
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,812
Listen, man, if you gonna dump
this motherfucker, dump it.

41
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,772
-All right, yo.
-Now, pull over.

00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,982
All right, man.

00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,868
Hey, yo, you said
you were gonna ditch this motherfucker.

44
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,787
-Ditch it, man.
-All right. You got it. All right.

45
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,798
We went straight to Tommy's house
afterwards out in Jamaica Estates

46
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,258
just to cooI out for a minute.

47
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,763
I mean, I Iove this nigga's crib, man.

Now, now, son.

52
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,569
That shit was raw, kid.

53
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,656
Splattered homegirl up against
the motherfuckin' glass and all that shit.

54
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,495
-What the fuck is that?
-What the fuck is this?

55
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,290
You can kiss my ass.

56
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,878

62
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,065

00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,568

Now, Kisha, Kisha was a bad motherfucker.

69
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,257
Tall, dark skin. Some big-ass tits.

70
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,969
Look like a ghetto Naomi Campbell
and shit. A dime for real.

00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,095
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

72
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:14,349
Let's start counting this money, man,

00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,358
Come on, dun.

00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,863
Now, say "sorry"
'cause you hurt my feelings.

75
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,450
This nigga serious?

76
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,619
Tommy, what is going on?
And why y'all makin' so much noise?

77
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,330
lt's these niggas right here.

78
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,249
Sorry. That's my fault.

00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,798
Yo, l'm about to go

00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,843
-See y'all niggas tomorrow.
-Yeah, l'm here.

83
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,081
This shit keeps going off.

84
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,670
Hi. l'm Kurt Loder with MTV news.

85
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,048
There have been aIarming reports
from London and Berlin

86
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,426
of a new form of heroin being soId
in underground hip-hop cIubs and raves

87
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,802
aII across Europe.

88
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,930
This better not be no bitch.

89
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,563
-Hello. What's the deal?
-Who is this?

90
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,691
-And who is this?
-This is Kisha.

91
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,652
Why the fuck are you paging my man?

92
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,779
Who, Tommy?

93
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,199
-You know who l'm talking about.
-Oh, what's up, Kish?

94
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,369
Yo, Tommy tells me everything about you.
What's going on?

95
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,620
It's reported that this heroin

96
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,790
is dramaticaIIy more potent
than previous forms of the drug.

97
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,335
So much more, the user need only
appIy the drug externaIIy on the skin

98
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,670
to be affected.

99
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,964
US DEA fears the drug
is on its way to this country

100
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,092
via various conduits in Jamaica
and throughout the West Indies.

101
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,426
We'II have more on the story as it breaks.

102
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,012
That's the news for now.
Stay tuned for more later here on MTV.

103
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:27,148
Cut the bullshit, all right?
Are you fucking Tommy, or what?

104
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,777
Well, not exactly, you see. l'm only 1 6.

105
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,905
So Tommy said we couldn't fuck yet.

106
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,866
But l did suck his dick
the night before last.

107
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,076
You what?

108
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,663
l said l sucked his dick
the night before last.

109
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,791
My crib was out in St. Albans still,

110
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,420
not too far from where we grew up,
right by the Vet's hospitaI.

111
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,922
I mean, it's not Iike Tommy's crib
or nothing

112
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,757
but I Iove Iiving around the way.

113
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,803
All right, all right. lt's okay. lt's okay.

114
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,888
Ti? That's my girl.

115
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,934
l met her out in Baltimore when me
and Bunds first started flippin' birds.

116
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,020
We had Kenya this past year.

117
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,356
Yo, when shit gets crazy, it's them.
They keep me sane.

118
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,443
I been knowing Tommy
ever since I was 1 1 years oId.

119
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,987
He showed me how to tongue kiss

120
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,406
We were like best friends.

121
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,284
Sorry things ain't working out for you two.

122
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:23,455

00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,464

126
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:41,806
Mama's gonna get you.
l won't let Daddy torture you no more.

127
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:47,103
-You talk too loud on the phone.
-What you talkin' about?

128
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,357
'Cause l heard you
whispering to Bundy about last night.

129
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,902
-What the fuck is you talking about?
-Who the hell is Kionna, Tommy?

130
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,321
-Kionna who?
-Oh, you dumb now?

131
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,908
-You know who l'm talking about.

132
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:04,663

Sin, l mean, seriously, why can't we
just start a business or something?

135
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,337
l mean, Kenya needs you.

136
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,590
What the fuck's supposed to happen to us
if you get caught? What, what?

137
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,926
What, visits? Phone calls?

138

What you think l'm gonna be
doing out here, nothing?

139
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,055

l told you plenty of times,
Tommy does not give a fuck about you.

142
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,815
You cannot trust him. You know that.

143
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,650
Look, Tommy, l just spoke to the girl.

144
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,027
She not only told me she know you

145
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,863
but that she sucked
your little black ding-a-ling last night.

146
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,283
-So, what you got to say now, huh?
-The bitch is lying.

00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,983
You know, that's my dawg.
We like real brothers and shit.

181
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,945
Oh, the dope game.
Now you wanna fuck with dope.

182
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,116
That's where the money's at, baby.

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,120
lt seem like that's all
you wanna talk about is drugs.

184
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,707

185
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,502
-Gotta have more than one hustle.

00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,506
l call you my nigga
because l got love for you.

00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,469
Ain't no money like dope money.

00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,890
Son, you sound stupid right now.

189
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,559
You're not even hearing me right now, man.

00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,739
You sound like wifey talking, man.

194
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,617
You might as well pack it up.
Fuck it. Stay home, man.

195
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,746

Bitches will fuck your whole shit up.

196
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,001
What type of nigga

197
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,089
How much you think
we could make off that shit?

198
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,889
After shit goes down, we usuaIIy
went to Mark's Grandma's to get it on.

199
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,432
Count the money, whatever.

200
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,477
Mark's basement
was one fucked-up spot, you know.

201
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,479
But that was our spot.

202
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,066
Hook us up with some weed, man.
l wanna get dizzy, man.

203
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,859
What's up with putting us on?

204
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,947
Wise and Lakid,
they wanted to be Iike us so bad.

205
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:53,117
They was too young, but Bunds kept these
IittIe niggas around aII the time, man.

206
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,954
They was young thugs in training and shit.

207
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,665
Anyway, what's up with that blunt, dawg?

208
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,460
That's what l'm talking about, man.
Some of that weed.

motherfucking heat off that couch.

213
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:21,646
He was one of those PhD niggas, though.
A pIayer-hatin' dickhead.

214
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,773
You know I had to fuck with him, right?

KnowIedge. He was a for reaI grimy nigga.

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,902
I never reaIIy trusted him.

231

He the type of nigga
that's just too smart for his own good.

00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,699
A shysty-ass nigga.

00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,785
Yo, shit must've got funky

00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,250
motherfucking news flash came on
showing the whole shit.

236
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,503
You know we had to give it to
a couple of security guards in the club.

237
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,882
-But, yo, your man, your man.
-Who, BIack?

238
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,634

l heard the nigga was trying to act like
he wanted to stick Sincere or some shit.

242
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,981
Bunds hated to be fucked with

243
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,817
but he reaIIy hated
when niggas fucked with me even worse.

244

The big vacation is what you owe me.

437
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,572
Watch this right here.

438
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,409
You see eyesore? This is the ghetto.

439
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:56,038
Our kingdom starts here.
A fierce operation.

440
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,540
l'm gonna start a fierce operation.

441
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:03,003
These are the ghetto, not a slum. See?

442
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,964
This is the island where l grew up.

443
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:16,767
You have to be the fittest of the fittest
in the sea to survive.

444
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,021
A man can live like a king in America.

445
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,065
This is the island l come from.

446
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,400
-You understand that really?
-Yeah.

447
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,111
l almost feel everything for them.

448
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,697
l feel everything for them. Sayin'?

449
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,785
l have tried my best,
but things gotta change. Sayin'?

450
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:39,289
But anyway, don't worry about it. Sayin'?

451
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:44,378
We come to Jamaica to celebrate
the rebirth of Kingston's finest.

452
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,762
Jamaica Gates, huh?

453
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,598

a fat Jamaican pussy tonight.

454
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:00,227
-You can handle it?
-Nah, you keep the fat ones, baby.

455
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:05,273
Pussy here make your dick
get hard like Rottweiler.

456
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,400
You know what l'm saying?

457
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,239
Hey, yo, Ti!

458
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,160
Yo, Tionne! Where you at?

459
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,920
That thing would look real nice
over my bed.

460
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,673
lt would. lt's got all your colors.
lt's your color scheme.

461
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,175
Tommy probably wouldn't like it anyway.

462
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,137
Hey, Ti, thanks for coming.

463
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,889
l know you don't really know me
that well and all.

464
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,100
l hate to burden you, but...

465
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,645
lt's not a burden. lt's cool. What's wrong?

466
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,690
l'm sayin' l just...
l feel like l don't have any hope.

467
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,817
l can't seem to get this nigga
away from me.

468
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,528
l know he's the worst type of nigga to have,
but yet...

469
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,739
-But yet what?
-l don't know.

470
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:57,284
l keep hoping that maybe one day
he'll be more like Sincere.

471
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,288
You know? More into life. More into me.
You know. You have that.

472
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,956
Kisha, l'm gonna just be honest with you.

473
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,500
Tommy's not gonna be shit but what he is.

474
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,044
You just have to understand.

475
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:11,131
Certain types of people accept
the bad in life, and that's cool with them.

476
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,676
l hate to say it, but you're right, you know?

477
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,803
lt just hurts to be alone, you know?

478
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:21,224
And the only thing l have is fucked up.
ls that all there is?

479
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,559
Kisha, you got life.

480
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,145
You are breathing.
You're healthy. Fuck that nigga.

481
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,065
You don't need no nigga
to make you feel like you're whole.

482
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,108
But you and Sincere are so happy.

483
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:34,446
But don't mistake it.
l'm happy with Sincere because l'm happy.

484
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,991
lf l wasn't happy with him,
then l'd have to do what l have to do.

485
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,577
You have to do the same for you.

486
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,704
l don't know what that is.

487
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,998
l mean, l think you'll be all right.

488
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,460
You're just going to have to
take it one day at a time.

489
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,629
-Yeah.
-You know. That's all l can think.

490
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,350

You got it, Wise and Lakid.

653
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,998
Bunds was the best
at makin' a bad situation worse.

654
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,166
He wouId corrupt anyone he couId
to get over.

655
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,669
As Iong as he knew
how to controI niggas' minds,

How the fuck'd you get this number?

679
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,756
Your bitch gave me the number.
What the fuck you talking about?

680
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,966
Tommy, that's my word.

681
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,595
If y'aII don't get that baiI money,
you gonna see what time it is.

682
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,431
That's your word? Nigga, suck my dick.

683
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,687
-What's up with Knowledge?
-Fuck Knowledge.

Before we break out,
l gotta holler at you before we bounce.

700
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,534
What's the deal?

701
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:30,706
Son, a nigga like me

702
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,750
You know what l'm sayin'?

703
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,545
Remember, l said l came down here
to check niggas in the whole notch

704
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,380
especially you, son.

705
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,050
l brought a present
and the whole shit from my man.

706
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,969
Your man? What's that?

707
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:53,312
-Knowledge.
-Knowledge?

708
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,602
Come on, man! Get in the fuckin' car!

709
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:25,422
The more and more
I was reading the Minister's book,

710
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:29,551
the more I reaIized how fucked up
our whoIe thought process was.

711
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,554
I mean, we aII have knowIedge of seIf

712
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,432
but stiII, we was actin' Iike fuckin' idiots.

713
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:42,147
Now, more than ever,
I couId see error in our ways.

714
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:46,276
It seemed time had flipped shit
to a new fuckin' page.

715
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,322
Yo, yo. Chill, chill, chill.

716
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,663
That nigga's fuckin' crazy, yo!

717
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,374
You should have seen him.
He dissed their whole click.

718
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,959
Now, if that was me,

719
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,171
l would have bodied the niggas
soon as they said somethin'.

720
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:10,092
Fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
You was right there and didn't say shit.

721
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:13,387
l'm surprised you had nuts
to pull that piece of shit.

722
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,764
What the fuck you talkin' about?

723
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,307
lf it wasn't for me,

724
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,519
Umbrook and Casa would have
pushed your wig back, nigga. Word up.

725
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,023
Don't even try to front.

726
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:29,236
Yo, l seen how shook you was
when them niggas showed up.

727
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,698
Know what l mean?
You was prayin' shit didn't happen.

728
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:38,287
You know, l seen you after we left.
You was ready to cry like a bitch.

729
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:41,623
-Uh-huh!
-You think l ain't see that, yo?

730
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:46,086
Yo, when those niggas pulled out,
son looked mad hurt.

731
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,922
Know what l mean? Yo, don't front.

732
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:53,302
What, you don't want me to pull your
bitch-ass card in front of Bunds?

733
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,512
Fuck it. Just keep it real.

734
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,975
Yo, l know you not gonna let this nigga
talk to you like that. What's goin' on?

735
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,728
Nah, bitch nigga ain't no bitch to me.

736
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,820
That's what the fuck
l'm talkin' about, nigga. What?

737
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,990
Some real shit now. What?

738
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:18,952
Chill, chill. Bitches, chill before you
fuck around and make a mistake.

739
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,622
Ain't no mistakes.
This motherfuckerjust talk too much.

740
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,332
l had to shut him the fuck up.

741
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,532
After Wise got smoked,

742
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,493
Bunds was so drunk and high
he just stayed there,

743
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,537
feeIin' Iike he had enough.

744
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,122
And it was his fauIt that Wise got hit.

745
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,375
He couId have easiIy deaded
the whoIe argument.

746
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:09,378
But Bunds, he's an instigator for reaI.

747
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,588
So now he's like, "Fuck it."

748
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,840
Tommy was at the end of his rope.

749
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,969
Keep your arms where l can see 'em.
Cuff him.

750
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,179
You have the right to remain silent.

751
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,558
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

752
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,147
Do you understand these rights
as l have read them?

753
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,115
...six nine.

754
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,955
T.R. Jacobs.

755
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:47,666
What's your aliases?

756
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,210
Sincere.

757
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,558
Close door!

758
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:29,124
Yo.

759
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,293

Department of Corrections inmate.

760
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,545
-Tommy Brown.
-Yeah, l accept.

761
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:37,049
What's up, Sin? What's goin' on?

762
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,260
Who this? Bunds?
What's the deal, my nigga?

763
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:45,390
Fucked up. l need some help, yo.

764
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,977
Yo, l told you l wasn't
fuckin' with you no more, man.

765
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:53,273
-What part you don't understand?
-Yeah, l know.

766
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,150
l got arrested on some bullshit last night.

767
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:58,111
l gotta get outta here
before my prints come back.

768
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:01,365
Take that shit to Ox, man. Tell him it's his.

769
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,993
The rest of that... l'm in Decatur, man.

770
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:09,122
Remember, dawg, you my nigga.
Don't let me down.

771
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:12,459
No doubt, baby. l got you.
Don't even worry it. Peace.

772
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:13,585
One.

773
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,134
Cannot believe you.

774
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,763
Bullshit clot...

775
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:29,101
l don't wanna watch
some bumba clot no more.

776
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,813
l put my trust in them.
Now we're gonna lose it.

777
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,710
l don't wanna watch them no more.

778
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,840
Sorry Ras clot, no?

779
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:10,517

780
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,671
A bumba clot war, hmm?

Wanna ramp with me?

782
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,476
Come on!

783
01:02:56,981 --> 01:03:00,650
Who wanna test me? Come on! Come on!

784
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,241
Don't know who l bumba clot ramp with.

785

Wanna know me?

786
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:14,080

lt's me, the bumba clot Ox!

796
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:44,462
When l finally got to Ox house,
yo, there was cops everywhere.

797
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,047
I seen that nigga Iaid out,

798
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:49,676
the fuckin' top dog
with his throat slit from ear to ear.

799
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,177
Damn.

800
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:55,056
You know, l drove around Queens for,
Iike, an hour-and-a-haIf in a daze.

801
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,893
FinaIIy, I drove up to RochdaIe Projects.

802
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,562
Me and Bunds used to hang out there
back in the days.

803
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,606
That's where all the bitches was.

804
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:06,401
Yo, when I waIked through,
l saw my man Shorty out there pumpin'.

805
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,987
Shorty was, like, 12 goin' on 20.

806
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,364
A reaI Ioser-type nigga, you know?

807
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,408
No hope for the future at aII.

808
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:17,704
To him, it wasn't reaIistic that he
was ever gonna make it out the projects.

809
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,331
And he was right.

810
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,126
-What up, Shorty?
-What up?

811
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,755
Man. Niggas up mad early

01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:35,055

01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,184
-What you was doin'?
-Shot this nigga, man.

817
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:43,605
l got it still burnin'. Shit's just gettin' hot.

818
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:46,066
See? Just gotta hold the shit down.

819
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,902
Know what l'm sayin'?
Got the bulletproof vest.

820
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:56,284
-Yo, damn, man.
-Shit's just hot.

821
01:05:56,369 --> 01:06:00,163
Don't let these niggas out here
steer you wrong, man.

822
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,875
See them niggas on the corner over there?

823
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,379
-They're gonna be out here forever.
-All right, peace.

824
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:12,300
-Yo, man. Fuckin' with guns.
-lt's all right.

825
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,680
When you fuck with guns, Shorty...

826
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:21,935
lt's always the coolest niggas that
fuck around and get murdered, you know?

827
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,566
lt's a war out here.

828
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,403
Mad niggas is dyin'.

829
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,656
-You don't want that shit to be you, right?
-Nah.

830
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,993
l know you gonna hold it down, though.
You know what l mean?

831
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:39,869
Just be careful, man.

832
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:43,081
These niggas out here
ain't even really worth it.

833
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,751
You're an ill nigga, though.
l like your style, son.

834
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,921
Shorty, l'm a go, so, all right?

835
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,757
Look in your pocket.

836
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,178
That's you. That's from me, baby.

837
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,640
Just make sure you rise above
all this madness out here.

838
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,767
Mind elevation, man.

839
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:06,312
Fuck that petty shit. You don't need it.

840
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,857
For real. All right?

841
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:11,192
-All right.
-All right, all right. My nigga.

842
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,469
You're out, dickhead. Open the gate.

843
01:07:56,655 --> 01:08:00,075
Bunds was an animaI out the cage, for reaI.

844
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,577
But he went around the way
to Iay at his stepmom's crib

845
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:04,537
and get his pIans together.

846
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:08,249
And that's where life as he knew it
came to an end.

847
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,835
All right. All right, here we go.

848
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:18,009
Yeah. Right there. Try that one on.

849
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:20,678
There it is, man.

850
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:23,056
What's you, a coach or somethin'?

851
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,684
You ain't from around here.

852
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,480
l'm Roger. How you doin', Tommy?

853
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,028
l just came lookin' for you, man.

854
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,280
Lookin' for me for what?

855
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:43,201
When l heard that the police
finally had you in custody

856
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:46,788
l wanted to come down
and just meet you in person.

857
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:49,457
Don't get nervous. A lot of agents here.

858
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:54,712
What l think you should do is
just pay attention and listen to me.

859
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,632
Listen to what l'm gonna tell ya.

860
01:08:57,716 --> 01:08:59,801
l'm gonna give you a choice, man.

861
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:02,512
-Oh, l got a choice?
-Yeah, you got a choice.

862
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:06,516
l'm gonna offer you some freedom.

863
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,311
You know you're in a lot of trouble.

864
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,647
Without us, you go to jail.

865
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:16,484
You go to jail forever. You understand?

866
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,195
So who l gotta blast?

867
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,739
He calls himself the Minister.

868
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:26,035
lt's yourjob to get into his organization
and learn his ways.

869
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,997
On New Year's Eve
he's having the biggest gathering,

870
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:33,001
World's Day of Reckoning,
at the Armory in Harlem.

871
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:36,254
On that very night,
you will terminate this fucker.

872
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:41,676
We'll do everything in our power
to give you all the help that's necessary.

873
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,471
But be warned,
we've got a lot of operatives in place.

874
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:49,267
lf you show any weakness
or if you betray us,

875
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:52,770
it'll be your resignation.

876
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,148
You understand?

877
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,360
Yeah, l understand.

878
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,946
Don't fuck around, Bunds.

879
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:13,041
l was thinking, l know it's your boy
and l hate to keep bringing it up,

880
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:16,711
but seriously,
we need to start thinking about us.

881
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:20,632
This shit's too dangerous now.

882
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,717
lt's not safe anymore.

883
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:26,679
Ti, l feel like it's time for us
to go away from here.

884
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:29,224
l been thinkin' about it for a long time.

885
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:30,642
Where will we go?

886
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,902
Ti, let's go to Africa.

887
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,404
Shit, nigga, please. Be for real.

888
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:46,407
Yo, l never been more serious in my life.

889
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:50,119
l mean, we been to the islands.
We been everywhere.

890
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:52,247
Who says we can't go to Africa?

891
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:57,460
l mean, but... l don't know.

892
01:10:57,544 --> 01:11:00,546
-Africa's far.
-So what?

893
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:04,008
l'm sayin', just think about us.
That's all we ever talk about.

894
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:08,513
That's our dream, to go to our homeland
where our roots are.

895
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:14,435
Fuck it, man. You know what l'm sayin'?
Like, forget about money. Fuck everything.

896
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,731
lt's a chance of a lifetime.
lf me and you went, and the baby...

897
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:22,986
Just think.

898
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:26,072
Maybe it's the right thing to do, maybe not.

899
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,662
Well, l'll think about it.

900
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:34,998
l will think about it.

901
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,168
Bunds was supposed to
take out the Minister.

902
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:43,589
ApparentIy, they needed a nigga to do it
for pubIicity or somethin'.

903
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:45,633
Tommy was perfect.

904
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,177
He had to start from the bottom, though.

905
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:51,222
You know, reaIIy take
it serious with the reIigion.

906
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:54,350
He had to study and reaIIy be a part of it

907
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:57,520
'cause it wasn't gonna be easy
to get cIose to the Minister.

908
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:05,236
Meanwhile, Knowledge and Shameek
started scheming

909
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,280
on how they was gonna find Bundy,

910
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,907
you know, for a IittIe payback visit.

911
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,327
KnowIedge knew where Kisha Iived,

912
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:14,912
so he knew Tommy wouIdn't be far behind.

913
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:22,337
Oddly enough,
the more Tommy got into character

914
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:25,340
the more, you know,
the truth was Iike the Iight.

915
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:29,886
No matter what cIouds are true,
eventuaIIy the sun wiII come out

916
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:33,264
and you cannot stop the sun from shining.

917
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:39,062
For the first time
the sun was finaIIy shinin' on Bundy.

918
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,958
Oh, shit!
What the fuck are y'all doin' in my house?

919
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,961
Relax, shorty.
Nobody here to fuck with you.

920
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:10,718
Then get your stank ass out my house
and take your broke-ass niggas with you.

921
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,096
We just here looking for this nigga.
That all.

922
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:17,141
We was hopin' maybe Sin
could tell us where to find his ass.

923
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,645
Oh, shit.

924
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,072
Don't worry, shortstop. We're on our way.

925
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:34,784
Just tell Sin Father Sha came by. That all.

926
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:38,496
We don't want to worry the guy,
but we really need to find this fucker.

927
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,456
l'm fuckin' serious.

928
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:45,294
Care, my niggas.

929
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:47,672
Hey, yo, peace, shorty.

930
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,219
You stay cool. Don't hurt nobody.

931
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,653
I get a phone caII from niggas,
Iike, early this evening.

932
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:13,698
l can't believe it.
He want me to meet him up in Harlem.

933
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:18,119
I don't even know what's goin' on.
First, how the fuck he get outta jaiI?

934
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:21,038
Maybe this nigga gave me up
to get out, you know?

935
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:24,333
It couId be a setup.
You couId never teII with this nigga.

936
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:29,005
I mean, Bunds is my dawg, but this nigga,
man, is hard to teII sometimes.

937
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:31,424
He could be ill when he wanna be.

938
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:33,217
Yo, Bunds. What up, nigga?

939
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:38,055
-What scheme you up to now?
-How you doin', Sin?

940
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,640
l'm all right. What's up?

941
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:42,977
l been tryin' to call you.
How come you ain't call me back?

942
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:48,065
Ain't hard to tell.
My life's in a whole 'nother direction, dawg.

943
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:52,236
l could see that. Yo, you know
l'm not gonna leave you though, right?

944
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:56,157
Yo, l thought you was up the river, man.

945
01:14:56,241 --> 01:15:00,161
l didn't know what to do.
l went to Ox house, yo.

946
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,915
Then l call Mark,
and l'm a-tell him what happened.

947
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,750
l didn't get no response.

948
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:10,505
Heard about Ox. Know what l'm sayin'?

949
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:13,883
But you want to know somethin' though,
Sin?

950
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:18,179
You was always right, dawg.
You know what l'm sayin'?

951
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:21,641
We was on the road to destruction
from the beginning.

952
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:24,018
Wasn't tryin' to hear it, though, you know?

953
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:27,438
But now, you know,
the Minister showed us the right path.

954
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,692
-Try and take that path?
-What happened to "fuck followers"

955
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:34,737
and "no purpose"
and all your issues and shit?

956
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:38,449
Listen, dawg,
we all make mistakes, especially me.

957
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,953
But if you've got a chance to make it right,
make it right.

958
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,706
l got that from you.

959
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,833
l feel it's the only way.

960
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:52,004
l don't feel a need to play
the whole part in the entire movement

961
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:56,842
but, yo, if you just raise your family right,
if l just live righteously,

962
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,844
l be all right.

963
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:01,764
Yo, my whole life is dedicated to change.

964
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:03,891
Yo, l'm goin' to Africa.

965
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,476
-Word?
-Word.

966
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:07,395
Africa?

967
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:11,023
Gonna take some time out
to reflect on the things that's happenin',

968
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:14,902
you know, between you, me,
the whole world.

969
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,322
That's ill, son. That's ill.

970
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:22,994
What can l say but,
you know, congratulations.

971
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:26,080
Good luck on your trip to the motherland.

972
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:28,124
Good luck, Bunds.

973
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:32,587
l hope everything is right with you
and the Minister as well, all right?

974
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,755
What you want me to do
with the car and all that?

975
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,383
All your shit. What you want me to do?

976
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:41,012
l ain't gonna really need none of that.
You know what l'm sayin'?

977
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:43,931
Accept it as a gift.

978
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,891
-Take it to the heart.
-D.

979
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:47,393
-One.
-One.

980
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:11,876
Now, remember,
the dope has to be secured in that office.

981
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:17,131
lt's extremely important
that he's found with shit on the premises.

982
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:21,052
Our people are all in place.
Spread the word.

983
01:17:27,267 --> 01:17:28,809
Hey, slick.

984
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:33,314
Do not attempt to get a brain on this.
You hear me?

985
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:35,316
Under no circumstances

986
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:39,153
is the Minister to make that speech.

987
01:17:42,532 --> 01:17:45,034
l want it real messy. No mistakes.

988
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:47,745
You copy that?

989
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:54,919
Yeah, l copy that.

990
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,090
You're my nigga, man. You're my nigga.

991
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:23,698
-Yo, Ti.
-l'm in here, Sin.

992
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,785
Why you sittin' over here in the dark?

993
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,454
What happen?

994
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,457
When l got home,
there was some niggas in the house.

995
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,253
They said they were lookin' for you.

996
01:18:37,337 --> 01:18:39,880
One of 'em, he said his name was Sha.

997
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:43,050
But l think he was lookin' for Tommy.

998
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,428
-Did they touch you?
-No.

999
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:48,264
l got scared, so l just pulled out.

1000
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:53,018
But they left quietly.
l mean, they didn't do anything.

1001
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:55,354
But l've just been sittin' here.

1002
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:00,526
They dead, all right?

1003
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:04,530
-They are dead.
-No, Sin. Mm-mm. You gotta promise.

1004
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:09,326
You gotta promise me that you'll just say,
"Fuck this shit" and leave it alone.

1005
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,079
You gotta swear
that you will not go lookin' for them.

1006
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:16,000
l can't take this shit no more.
We should just do what you said.

1007
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:19,587
You forget about Tommy, forget about
all this shit and start thinkin' about us.

1008
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:22,506
Let's just do what you said.
Let's just split and go to Africa.

1009
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,008
We should just go.

1010
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,385
-All right then.
-We should just go.

1011
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,971
We're gonna go, okay? We'll go.

1012
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:41,525
l don't know how you can stay out here.
Shit gettin' crazier every day.

1013
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:46,447
Word, me, my wifey, little C,
we all out, man.

1014
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:50,034
Yo, you goin' to Africa?
You gonna stop fuckin' with weed?

1015
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:54,079
l don't even fuck with no more chronic.
l don't need none of that shit no more.

1016
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:58,292
-This is the shit, l'm tellin' you.
-You one lucky nigga, boy.

1017
01:19:58,376 --> 01:20:01,796
Long-ass flight, too.
l ain't never comin' back.

1018
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,799
That's what l was thinkin' about,
never comin' back. Word!

1019
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,980
You my nigga, all right?
Get with you on that.

1020
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,525
-All right. Yeah.
-Tell Chaka my love, all right?

1021
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:24,652
-All right. Peace.
-Chill, nigga.

1022
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:27,947
Man, it's crazy out here, man.
That's why l broke out for a minute.

1023
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,740
-All right. Word up.
-Straight up.

1024
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:32,576
-Yo, what up?
-Sin, what's up, baby?

1025
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:36,372
-How you? How you been?
-l'm maintaining. Looking good.

1026
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:38,541
-You got the little one, huh?
-Yeah.

1027
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:41,627
-She got me baby-sittin' right now.
-That's real.

1028
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:46,090
-You all right, though? Lookin' good.
-Yeah. You know how it is.

1029
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,551
-l know it's crazy out here.
-Oh, yeah.

1030
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:52,179
Yo, l'm gettin' ready to blow, dun.

1031
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:54,181
-Oh, word. All right. Sure.
-Peace, man. Peace.

1032
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:58,853
-What's up, baby pop?
-Yo, what up, Black? Funny-ass nigger.

1033
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:01,939
-Fuck is up, nigga?
-Remember that shit from the basement?

1034
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,615
-Stupid motherfuckers!
-Fuck outta here, yo!

1035
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,992
Take this, man!

1036
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:39,977
Ti, l got shot.

1037
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,854
-What?
-Yeah.

1038
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:44,231
Coming out the barber shop,
this nigga shot me in my leg.

1039
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,275
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

1040
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:47,568
Oh, my God!

1041
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:50,613
-l had to shoot these two other niggas.
-What?

1042
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:53,991
-The nigga that shot me, l killed that nigga.
-What?

1043
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:59,663
l don't give a fuck, though.
We still gonna go.

1044
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:02,499
Ain't nothin' stoppin' us from leavin'.
l don't give a fuck no more.

1045
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:03,667
We goin'.

1046
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:22,394
-Yo?
-What up, cat daddy?

1047
01:22:23,563 --> 01:22:25,981
-It's KnowIedge.
-Fuck is up?

1048
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:29,276
-What's the verdict?
-Biggie just got hit with some joints.

1049
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:31,445
Ain't even gonna see Iife for a minute.

1050
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:35,491
Damn. Yo, that nigga can't Iive, son.

1051
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,702
You know l know where
Tommy bitch Iive at, right?

1052
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:42,414
-Yeah?
-35 Westchester.

1053
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:45,125
Son, l'm a-go see that piece.

1054
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:49,713
Let that bitch Tommy know
what's reaI up in the battIefieId, for you.

1055
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:53,050
Get that bitch.
Bring that nigga out in the front.

1056
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:57,554
No doubt. Stay up, baby.
Hold your head. One.

1057
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:47,730
Come on. Let's bring it. All right!

1058
01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:55,571
AII praises due to the
one and true living God!

1059
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:57,906
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1060
01:23:57,991 --> 01:24:02,703
This is a great day today!
A great and festive day!

1061
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:05,622
You are a beautifuI peopIe,

1062
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:09,001
a peopIe deserving of a savior.

1063
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:30,564
l want you to secure the west wing.
You two move out.

1064
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:37,279
...a God who loves you and l so much

1065
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:42,159
that he would
cIimb a mountain 40 miIes high

1066
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:45,037
just to save one of you.

1067
01:24:46,539 --> 01:24:47,664
Go.

1068
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:04,932
Right? He said, "Let my peopIe go!"

1069
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:12,397
He said, "Wicked, Iet my peopIe go!"

1070
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:21,073
He saved the day.
This time, he is right in our midst.

1071
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:22,991
Who is he? Say it!

1072
01:25:56,901 --> 01:25:58,902
l knew you were coming

1073
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,988
so l sent everyone away

1074
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:04,324
because l believed
my final moment was at hand.

1075
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,704
Before you pull that trigger

1076
01:26:08,788 --> 01:26:10,664
and take my life

1077
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,959
l would like the chance
to tell you some things

1078
01:26:14,043 --> 01:26:18,672
perhaps to think about after l am gone.

1079
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:20,966
Don't worry about me stallin'.

1080
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:25,554
My people have orders to leave me
to my studies for another 1 5 minutes.

1081
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:28,849
l will only take five.

1082
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:31,226
Can you bear with me?

1083
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:32,936
Will you?

1084
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,355
Then make up your mind.

1085
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:43,530
Today marks the change of not only
a new year, but a new millennium.

1086
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:45,157
Take a look around.

1087
01:26:45,241 --> 01:26:50,704
The majority of the youth roam the streets
deaIing in drugs, sex and vioIence,

1088
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:53,874
thinking these things
have no real effect on life.

1089
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:56,585
Crimes without real punishment.

1090
01:26:56,669 --> 01:27:01,757
An uncaring, unfeeIing generation
without knowIedge of seIf.

1091
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:06,094
This is the future of our nation,
the future of our people.

1092
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:09,389
Do you think hatred and evil
will go unpunished?

1093
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:13,018
The world is now feeling the heat

1094
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:17,439
from flames it has kept burning
since the beginning of civilization.

1095
01:27:17,523 --> 01:27:19,733
You represent that fire.

1096
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:23,153
You and l are just a small part
of God's plan.

1097
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:29,284
The evil men of this world
have appIied every method possibIe

1098
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:31,161
to deceive its occupants

1099
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:36,833
and each time with greater success
than anticipated.

1100
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:39,419
But no more.

1101
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:43,090
Tonight, with this new millennium,

1102
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:46,343
God will begin to overcome this evil.

1103
01:27:54,894 --> 01:27:57,562
I represent the truth to the peopIe.

1104
01:27:57,647 --> 01:28:00,274
Without truth, nothing is sacred.

1105
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:03,068
The lie, that's what the devil is all about.

1106
01:28:03,152 --> 01:28:05,988
You know that. That's why you're here.

1107
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:08,031
What the hell?

1108
01:28:09,909 --> 01:28:15,163
The truth is, we all play a grave role
in our own destruction.

1109
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,458
Your money.

1110
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:19,960
Your lifestyles.

1111
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:23,463
The things that people value
and covet so dearly

1112
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,300
are the bait that lures them out of the light.

1113
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:31,680
Turn over, bitch.

1114
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:36,143
Where the fuck is that bitch-ass nigga at?

1115
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:37,477
Huh? Bitch!

1116
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:39,646
Through the love of others

1117
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:41,231
l have power.

1118
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:44,067
The truth gives me this.

1119
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:47,112
Those that fear me send you here,

1120
01:28:47,196 --> 01:28:49,656
here to murder all that l say.

1121
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:56,538
They use what you fear against you.

1122
01:28:57,915 --> 01:29:01,084
Your fear of death.
Your fear of imprisonment.

1123
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:03,086
Oh, shit! You fuckin'...

1124
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:07,758
Where in this world
is anyone safe from death?

1125
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:10,594
You see the lies you've been told?

1126
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:13,597
The path you take is not your own.

1127
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:19,311
Now you turn around, bitch!
Punk-ass motherfucker!

1128
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:23,190
Look what you did to me!
l hate you! l hate you!

1129
01:29:23,274 --> 01:29:26,360
Have you ever thought about
how precious a life is?

1130
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,654
How difficult it is to create?

1131
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:34,785
How loosely and easily
it has been for you to take away?

1132
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:35,994
Ten!

1133
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,245
Brother, help me.

1134
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:38,413
Nine!

1135
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:39,706
Help me to do what's right.

1136
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:40,874
Eight!

1137
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:43,043
Help me to stop
the slaughter of our children.

1138
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:46,505
-Seven!
-Help me to put an end to the disrespect

1139
01:29:46,589 --> 01:29:50,550
and the dishonor of our most
valuable resource, the black woman.

1140
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:53,595
-Six!
-Help me to put an end

1141
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:58,392
to the destruction of the young mind
through the use of drugs, alcohol.

1142
01:29:58,476 --> 01:29:59,726
Five!

1143
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,896
Help me to build up
a population of great thinkers.

1144
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:04,064
Four!

1145
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:08,360
People who create change
through thoughtfulness and spirituality.

1146
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:09,569
Three!

1147
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:11,530
Will you choose that truth?

1148
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:13,073
Will you?

1149
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:14,199
Two!

1150
01:30:14,283 --> 01:30:16,618
Will you choose the light
over the darkness?

1151
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:18,203
One!

1152
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,671
Once l found out the clock was tickin'.

1153
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:29,756
See the Glock. Stick it.

1154
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:34,219
KiIIing, 'cause revenge
is aII they can think about in the end.

1155
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:36,096
But I'm going for the binge.

1156
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:38,598
Burn tiII I singe.

1157
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:40,934
Fuck outta this!

1158
01:30:41,018 --> 01:30:43,812
FaII by myseIf, die by myseIf.

1159
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:45,355
PIays the tricks.

1160
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:49,484
And if you don't know
what it's goin' to be in the end...

1161
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:53,697
T minus three, two, one. Amen.

1162
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:57,826
-Drop the gun!
-Hold it. Stay where you are.

1163
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:00,704
Will you choose life?

01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:06,585
lt's time, man.

1166
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:10,422
lt's time.

1167
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:28,231
When I opened my eyes,
l couldn't believe it.

1168
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:29,774
Africa, for reaI.

1169
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:32,444
I feIt Iike I never reaIIy seen cIouds before.

1171
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:37,073
the trees a different coIor green.

1172
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,658
And the peopIe, too.

1173
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:41,745
The peopIe were beautifuI. It feIt right.

1174
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:44,915
It was harmony, Iike I wasn't far from home.

1175
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:50,629
Everybody together, me, Tionne, Kenya.

1176
01:31:50,713 --> 01:31:53,924

It's Iike a whoIe new beginning.

01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,923
Yo. You ever been in love?

-No. You?
-No.

That's right. So what you goin' do?

You know how you do it, baby.
