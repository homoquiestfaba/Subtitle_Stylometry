STRETCH: What?

180
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:05,366
You know, nightly after shows,

181
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,003
he would find a groupie
from the crowd, select her,

182
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:12,039
cast his wizardry spell on her
and bring her backstage

183
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,808
where he would take
two fingers and stretch
her butthole apart...

fruit or vegetable.

That is not true.

00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:22,883
Yes, it is so.
- No, no, it's not.

188
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,752
That's-- I'm called
"Stretch" because I'm tall.

189
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,420
Could I have some sugar?

190

ANNIE: To me,
it sounds like you're ashamed

192
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:32,092

thing to hold in your body.

193

Let's get rid of it!

194

Let's do
a shame-expelling exercise.

00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:12,225
Hello!

343
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:16,564
I'm picking up an order.

344
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:25,339
Oh, there's
no-fucking-body here, man.

345
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,810
What shall I do?

346
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,815
Those look a little past due.

347
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,316
What'd you said?

348
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,753
"Check the cash register."

349
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:40,487
I'm not a thief.

350
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,422
British food is horrible.

351
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,558
Eughhh.

352
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:47,260
Stop it, nobody's behind me.

353
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:50,330
They should be though,
know what I'm saying? [chuckles]

354
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:52,900
What is this here?

355
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:54,802
Looks like I found the location

356
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:58,438
of where Stretch's girlfriend's
been keeping his nuts

357
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,708
and all her previous boyfriends'
as well.

358
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:07,481
Dare me? Send me 20 bucks
to my cash app, Venmo or PayPal

359
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:09,550
and I will eat a Covic egg.

360
00:19:11,753 --> 00:19:14,254
Got that pay notificache.

361
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,557
I'll put this Covic
egg in my face.

362
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:21,562
[mumbles] Oh, it's not good.

363
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:23,330
WOMAN: Hello? Excuse me.

364
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,600
Hey, sorry, we're closed.

365
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,969
Oh, um... [mumbles indistinctly]
WOMAN: Excuse me.

366
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:30,303
You can't be back there!
ANNIE: Oh, no, no, no.

367
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,572
Sorry, you need to leave.

368
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:32,774
ANNIE: Delivery!
WOMAN: You need to--

369
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,677
ANNIE: I'm not a normal person.
WOMAN: Oh, shit, sorry.

370
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,845
That's my fault.
I should have cancelled it.

371
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:39,514
ANNIE: Yeah, probably.
WOMAN: I'm sorry.

372
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:41,214
Wait, you're not gonna give
me some food?

373
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,984
WOMAN: We've had a really busy
night. I'll sort out a refund.

374
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:46,319
ANNIE: Not very socially
distance safe, just sayin',
you know.

375
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,588
WOMAN: Apologies.

376
00:19:47,622 --> 00:19:49,423
ANNIE: Whatever.

377
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,858
At least I got a snack.

378
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:52,192
WOMAN: Hey!

379
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:55,730
Have you got a car?

380
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:57,632
ANNIE: If you're trying to steal
one of my kidneys,

381
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:58,766
I wouldn't bother,

382
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,735
because those things
don't barely work.

383
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:03,370
Listen, I just need you to take
my friend somewhere nearby,

384
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,906
the usual guy let us down.

385
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:06,007
It won't take long.

386
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,975
ANNIE: People do
that, let you down.

387
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:13,380
Listen, it needs to stay
between us, OK?

388
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,616
I'll pay you extra
but don't mention...

389
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,819
not a word to
anybody, OK, promise?

390
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:19,053
ANNIE: I promise, yeah...

391
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:21,756
She's sleeping. I'll just
wake her up.
ANNIE: ...totally.

392
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:26,426
[softly] Angela, Angela,
sweetheart.

393
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,530
Angela, come on, lovely.
That's it, good girl.

394
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:31,331
Come on. Let's get up.

395
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,633
Are you OK?

396
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,267
That's it, good girl.

397
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:36,671
OK. You're OK.

398
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:40,508
OK, Angela, this lady's gonna
just take you to some
friends, OK?

399
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:43,811
ANNIE: Nope!
WOMAN: Please, wait, wait!

400
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:46,446
I'm just desperate.
Wait a minute, please.

401
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,882
ANNIE: No, lady.

402
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,484
Look, please, look, I really
need you to do this for me.

403
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,754
ANNIE: What is this,
some human-trafficking shit?

404
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:54,354
She's not safe here, please--
ANNIE: No shit!

405
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,890
Half an hour at most.
- ANNIE: Somethin's up here.

406
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,357
WOMAN: Please!
ANNIE: No.

407
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,960
WOMAN: Look, wait, stop, look...
[paper rustles]

408
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,933
You know, a lot of people
don't know this about me

409
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:08,903
but I'm actually a
really good person.

410
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:12,439
Lean against the car
for a second. I just gotta
get my key out here.

411
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:13,808
[car alarm chirps]
- Alright!

412
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:17,612
Welcome to the Band Car,
Angela - it's your first ride.

413
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,547
Put her little feeters in there.

414
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,516
Oh, great! Good girl.

415
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,885
It's OK, we're safe.

416
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:25,820
Oh, no, no, no, Angela.

417
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:27,688
You gotta stay inside for me.

418
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:30,423
OK, Angela, don't worry.
Just sit back.

419
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:33,661
And there we go.

420
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:36,864
Let me get a pen,
cos I'm taking a trip with--

421
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:39,033
Fuck! Come on.

422
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,636
Yeah, it's alright.
You stay in there.

423
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:43,704
I'm gonna put
the child-locks on.

424
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,874
OK, this is Angela.

425
00:21:46,908 --> 00:21:52,013
Her and I are taking a trip
to 214 Timberline Way.

426
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:54,682
RINGTONE: ♪ Hey, Amar,

- Oh, shit.

427
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,918
♪ It's me, Gemma
I know you're alone. ♪

428
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:58,820
I don't fucking
need this, Stretch.

429
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:01,856
Suck it, bro. I'm busy.

430
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:05,693
What, pray tell, is
at 214 Timberline Way?

431
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:09,897
Is it a blood sex orgy?
[distorted echo]

432
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:15,069
Is it an adrenochrome-harvesting
Tupperware party?

433
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:21,976
Will the Queen be there
selecting innocent
children to eat?

434
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:26,080
You're being awfully
tight-lipped.

435
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:27,949
But let's go...

436
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:29,684
We're cruising down the street
[rhythmic beats under]

437
00:22:29,717 --> 00:22:31,752
Looking for a bad brow

438
00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:34,822
Bad bro, get him in the backseat

439
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:36,924
Me and Angela want the skeet

440
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,426
Yes, we do,
Yes, we do

441

I said, yes, we do - I do too

442
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:45,666
What the fuck could
the smell be?

443
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,636
That is trying to arrest me

444
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:51,404
Pull over, it's the smell police

445
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:54,075
Yo, somebody help me, please.

Oh, fuck! This

She's fucking shitting.

I can hear it, I can taste it.

450
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:06,354

Hey, I'm fine.

the mainstream media that

686
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:49,443
you think you're anti-fascist.
STRETCH: What the fuck
are you doing?

687
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:50,678
But you're actually a fascist

688
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:53,280

Killing 'em like OJ.

1234
01:07:58,713 --> 01:08:03,350
If the glove does not fit,
you must acquit.

Drew O'Neill,
I know how he feels.

1261
01:09:47,387 --> 01:09:49,991
They don't call him
Drew "O'Kneel" for nothing,

1262
01:09:50,024 --> 01:09:51,759
you know what I'm saying.

Amar, I'mma tell you what.

1272
01:10:19,754 --> 01:10:22,456
There's a willow in your butt,

1273

better pull that out.

1274
01:10:23,891 --> 01:10:26,661

knows well that George Keeler
is a booty feeler.

1292
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:23,651
And Faith Kiggundu,
she really needs her

I haven't seen
this compost in so long.

look out for the ball ham.

1333

That's the ham that you
eat of some guy's balls.

1334
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:32,914
It's kind of gross
but it's a delicacy, y'all.

In Las Vegas, with Ben Mahoney.

1353
01:14:28,235 --> 01:14:31,105
I'm not sure
anymore, Dana Degan.

1354
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:34,075
I'm just trying to get
some dude to eat it.

1355
01:14:34,976 --> 01:14:36,811

01:14:56,097 --> 01:14:58,299
Dan Martin, he'll be there too,

1364
01:14:58,332 --> 01:15:01,268
and he'll be cum-cum farting,

1365
01:15:01,802 --> 01:15:04,638
Ahh! There's a cat, Peter Rudd.

1366

Look out, Peter Rudd
and Dan Hawkins.

1367
