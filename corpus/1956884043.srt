and retreated to a hidden

Only in modern times

to have a basis in fact,

The mountains of Ararat.

The head waters of the

History calls this the

Like the 1799 unearthing

our understanding of the Bible.

We didn't have any idea
that these even existed.

was archaeologists,

traveling through
layers of time,

57
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:09,145
who, in the 1850s, unearthed
cuneiform clay tablets

58

containing an ancient
story about a great flood.

00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:15,543
The Epic of Gilgamesh,

60
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:19,199
which has similarities

"for the earth is filled with
violence because of them."

66
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,998
- The story of Noah is told
many times in the Quran.

67
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,043
In the story itself,

68
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,437
Noah is informed that there's
gonna be a great flood.

69
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,613
After many years of
preaching to his people,

70
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:46,356
very few followers actually
believed in him and his message.

71
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,708
And so, he was informed
by God to build this ark.

yourself an ark of cypress wood.

"to destroy all life

00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,425
- What prompts the deity,
Yahweh, the god of the Bible,

78
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:12,730
to send the flood?

79
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:13,644
It has nothing to do with,

80
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,864
that the humans are procreating,

81
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:18,040
and creating noises

- The rains started falling.

86
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:30,705
And also the water
started gushing up.

from a comparative perspective,

is that we see it

That something happened,

00:07:56,954 --> 00:08:00,610
Ararat was seized from its
ancestral home in Armenia,

176
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:02,743
and given to Turkey.

177
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:05,702
Now, it rises majestically,
across the border,

178
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,704
a constant reminder.

179
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:10,620
- This is why we have
pain in our heart.

180
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:14,406
Because, our symbol
was taken from us,

181
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,672
without considering the
will of Armenian people.

182
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:22,327
It was in Armenia where
Noah constructed temple,

183
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:26,157
It was in Armenia where he
made his first sacrifice.

184
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:31,032
If you take out Ararat
from Armenia mythology,

185
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:33,687
Armenia will cease
to be Armenia.

186
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,689
- This is not a normal
part of the world.

187
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,560
This is a hostile
part of the world.

188
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:38,996
- [Spear] It's a
demilitarized zone.

189
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,694
It's highly classified.

190
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:42,347
- We had the PKK.

191
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:44,567
We have the Turkish army.

192
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:46,613
Needless to say, they
don't like one another.

193
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:49,572
[artillery fire]

194
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:52,270
- [Voiceover] In the decades
long conflict with Turkey,

195
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:54,621
the PKK controls the mountain.

196
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:59,277
- The PKK view themselves
as freedom fighters.

197
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:01,018
They represent the people.

198
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,368
They once had land, they
no longer have lands.

199
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:06,502
They believe they're fighting
for a righteous cause.

200
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,722
- You walk into a context
where there's a war zone.

201
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:12,639
You're on a mountain, dominated
and controlled by the Kurds.

202
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:14,815
At the same time,
you're in a country,

203
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:17,339
and the mountain
exists in that country,

204
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:20,821
that is under the sovereignty
of the Turkish authorities.

205
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:23,519
- [Voiceover] With
the dissolution of
the Ottoman Empire,

206
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,042
after World War I,

207
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:28,306
the treaty of Severa guaranteed
a homeland for the Kurds,

208
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,091
until the treaty was dismissed,

209
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:33,747
after the Turkish War
of Independence in 1923.

210
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,271
And hostilities escalated.

211
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,708
In 1945, the Kurds petitioned

212
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:42,364
the newly formed United
Nations for a sovereign state,

213
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:43,931
and received

214
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:45,280
nothing.

215
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:50,633
So, Iraq, Iran, Syria,
Armenia, and Turkey

216
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:54,028
all have chunks of, what
should have been, Kurdistan.

217
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:55,638
- That's why
they're so militant.

218
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:56,770
They want their
own country back.

219
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,206
I understand that.

220
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:59,990
- These are freedom
fighters, in there own eyes,

221
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,557
for what's legally always been,

222
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,080
and should have been, theirs.

223
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:06,301
- In years past, we have
been directed by the PKK,

224
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:07,519
through our Kurdish partners,

225
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,565
to exit the mountain.

226
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,654
- And you know once you
get on that mountain,

227
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:13,613
no one really is
going to help you.

228
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,397
The military doesn't
go where you go.

229
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,660
- We had Turkish
commandos with us,

230
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:21,316
until they decided they
didn't want to go any higher.

231
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,230
- You're on your own.

232
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:23,448
If someone wants to kidnap you,

233
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:24,667
they want to shoot you,

234
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,191
they have every
freedom to do it.

235
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,671
[gunshot]

236
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,940
- [Voiceover] But, for those
searching for Noah's Ark,

237
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:39,987
there is no other destination.

238
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,644
[fast drumming]

239
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,353
- They call me Cowboy.

240
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,921
I came over, and
agreed to set up,

241
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:03,097
and make sure everybody
got to the top,

242
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,620
make sure the equipment works,

243
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,405
make sure the food is here.

244
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:09,669
Deal with political
problems that we have.

245
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:14,935
- We're going up to drill.

246
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:21,593
My hope is that, yes,
indeed, we find it.

247
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:22,899
- Word.

248
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,560
- I think we're supposed to
look for things like this.

249
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:41,744
- I think there's
so much evidence,

250
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,703
that it's irresponsible
not to look.

251
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:50,274
- We are built to
explore, find and reveal.

252
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:52,668
It's just a part of who we are,

253
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,802
from Marco Polo to
Christopher Columbus.

254
00:11:58,674 --> 00:11:59,893
- It's a great team.

255
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,633
I look at them all like
brothers, you know?

256
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,771
- For me, the past
five years has been,

257
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:11,208
really a mirror into my soul.

258
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,123
Why am I doing this
year after year?

259
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:16,605
Why am I risking life and
limb to look for something

260
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:20,174
that we have no conclusive
evidence actually exists?

261
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:28,791
- The quest to find the
ark starts with my faith.

262
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:30,010
It started with my faith.

263
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:32,534
It started with a
calling that I felt.

264
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:35,450
- We have come together
to meet this challenge of

265
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:38,061
scientifically
examining, investigating,

266
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:39,671
and revealing to the world,

267
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:43,719
the evidence that may exist for
Noah's ark on that mountain.

268
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,679
- Last year, it was
an amazing trip.

269
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:49,551
Being able to work with my son,

270
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,553
on top of a mountain.

271
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:53,511
We work and play well together.

272
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:54,991
And we added value to the trip,

273
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:58,125
because we were able to
Frankenstein stuff together.

274
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:00,605
And that's what you have
to do in a place like this.

275
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,565
- None of these things
are labeled, of course.

276
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:14,315
We had an active volcano

277
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:17,709
on a fault line,
within recorded history

278
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:20,060
that's demolished
multiple civilizations.

279
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:22,845
And, then to think,

280
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:24,151
okay, there's something
that's gonna be suspended

281
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:25,630
in a 60 foot deep glacier,

282
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:27,197
that breaks off and
falls into a gorge

283
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:30,113
twice as deep as
the Grand Canyon.

284
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:32,072
There's different arguments
about how old the earth is,

285
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:35,292
whether it's 6,000, or
60 million years old.

286
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:40,210
And, even if it's the young-
smaller model, the fact
that and a matter what

287
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,212
if it's concrete
wood, bathed in,

288
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:46,173
who knows what kind
of chemical pitch,

289
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:47,565
if there's a splinter up there,

290
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,524
I'd come to the point where,

291
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:50,742
if there's a splinter
of wood up there,

292
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:51,656
it will be by the hand of God,

293
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,963
let alone some intact anomaly.

294
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,487
- I've had my worst nights
of my life on that mountain.

295
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,663
I've frozen on that mountain.

296
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:01,144
I've been bloody
on that mountain.

297
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:04,017
You sit in your tent,
and the wind is whipping,

298
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,757
and hitting the flaps.

299
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:06,933
You're eating your granola bar,

300
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:07,977
which you're gonna
throw up anyway,

301
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,587
because you're so nauseated.

302
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,589
It's just an
unpleasant place to be,

303
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,418
and sometimes you question
the sanity of just doing it.

304
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:16,116
- You know you're taking
your life in your hands

305
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,596
when you go on that mountain.

306
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,598
So, it has to be a cause bigger,

307
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,731
and greater than yourself

308
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,733
to motivate you to do that.

309
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:25,908
- I expect

310
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:30,695
something amazing on this trip.

311
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:32,872
I think there's
gonna be a transfer

312
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,482
from what I got,

313
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:36,876
and this is all
spiritual in nature,

314
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,488
what I received was word that

315
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:42,882
I was going to
receive something.

316
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,493
And, I was gonna be
giving something to God.

317
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,713
How could I not come?

318
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:52,630
- Finding the ark would indicate

319
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:56,852
that God, actually,
has intervened

320
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,334
with man.

321
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:03,598
And that has a profound impact.

322
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:06,906
People that have
thought this through

323
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,952
are scared to death
to find it to be true.

324
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,040
- Then you realize,

325
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,129
if you do see these
rotten timbers

326
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:17,090
of this boat, sticking out
of the ancient optics of ice,

327
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:18,830
it could change everything.

328
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:21,398
It could change the whole
perception of the Bible.

329
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,835
It could change
people's thought process

330
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,663
about where they came from,

331
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:27,274
who they are.

332
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:32,714
- Do you believe the entire
Bible is to be taken literally?

333
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:35,108
- Well, if it's
history, as Genesis is,

334
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,153
it's written as typical
historical narrative,

335
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,198
you take it as history.

336
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:39,460
If it's --

337
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:40,765
- Part of the root
of the fascination

338
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:41,679
of the story of Noah's
flood is, first of all,

339
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,072
it's a really good story.

340
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,813
I mean, it's an epic tale.

341
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:50,036
It has all the elements
of a good story.

342
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,995
But, there's particular
branches of Christian theology

343
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,692
that have basically
embraced the idea

344
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:56,651
of viewing the Bible as
a literal, historical,

345
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:58,740
and complete record of
the history of the world.

346
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:01,873
- It sounds as though you
believe your world view,

347
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,701
which is a literal
interpretation

348
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,834
of most parts of the Bible,

349
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:07,488
is correct.

350
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,403
- The conflict between
science and religion,

351
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:11,666
that is often portrayed
in the media today,

352
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,233
I think , is actually
better portrayed

353
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:15,975
as a conflict, within religion,
over how to view science.

354
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,151
- There are some difference
between Jews and Christians,

355
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:20,675
in the way that they relate
to the story of Noah,

356
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:22,372
and the way Muslims do.

357
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,071
- Everyone, whether they're
Muslim, or Jewish, or Christian,

358
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:27,160
the three accounts
that have the ark

359
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:29,684
in their religious documents,

360
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:33,035
all believe that the ark exists,

361
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,169
because their founding
documents say it does.

362
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:38,127
- I believe that
historical texts

363
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:40,608
are all part of the
human knowledge.

364
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:43,698
And, the human knowledge
is all based on both

365
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:45,308
the religious texts,

366
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:47,267
and the things that
they saw in nature,

367
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,878
and the things they were
told by their elders.

368
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:54,056
- [Voiceover] Hundreds of
cultures throughout the world

369
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,320
share the same legend
of a catastrophic flood

370
00:16:57,364 --> 00:17:00,628
that destroyed most of mankind.

371
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,023
In 95%, the flood
was world-wide.

372
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:09,419
In 88%, a certain
family was favored.

373
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:13,467
In 70%, survival was
by means of a boat.

374
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,037
In 67%, animals were also saved.

375
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,476
In 35%, birds were
sent out from the boat.

376
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:28,177
And in 9%, exactly eight
people were spared.

377
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:32,138
- And, rather than
immediately dismissing

378
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,878
a literal world-wide flood,

379
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:36,577
just suppose that, maybe,

380
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,971
actually, that this is
speaking of real events.

381
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:42,496
- If the biblical
stories in Genesis

382
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,368
are literally true, and
historically accurate,

383
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:47,109
you basically have to throw away

384
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,155
geology, and all the
physics, and chemistry,

385
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,070
and math, and biology
that it's built upon,

386
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,245
to embrace that view.

387
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:54,116
- Being a flood over
the entire earth.

388
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,639
And, those that
take that literally,

389
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:58,990
are kind of bound to
understanding it, in that way,

390
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:01,254
even if it contradicts science.

391
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:04,866
Where as Muslims, we're kind
of bound to accept science,

392
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:06,085
whatever that says,

393
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,695
and then reconcile
that with the text.

394
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:10,741
- We know for
certain, geologically,

395
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:14,093
that before 5,000 years ago,

396
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:17,618
there were enormous
amounts of rainfall,

397
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:20,664
where a great deal of water
would have accumulated,

398
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,579
and a major flood
would have occurred.

399
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,146
There is no question about it,

400
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,714
because we see the evidence
of this in the rock, itself.

401
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:29,499
- So, when you come at it from
a Christian point of view,

402
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,545
I don't think you should
be closed to the possiblity

403
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:34,417
that Genesis is
actually just simply

404
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:35,810
describing what happened.

405
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:37,420
- In which case,

406
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,944
validating your faith relies
on the reality of that story,

407
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,120
as a global flood,

408
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,296
and that it ended up on Ararat.

409
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,700
- This is my father place.

410
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:59,312
My father was put
his tent down here.

411
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:01,792
This is my grandfather
places also.

412
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:04,839
I remember, my mother
would say to me,

413
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:06,232
"Come, I have to wash you",

414
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:08,321
but I always run away.

415
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:09,800
And, there she was,
come behind me,

416
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:12,542
take my arm, and then hit me,

417
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,588
"Come here, you very dirty,

418
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:15,980
"I have to clean you".

419
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,286
It was like this.

420
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,635
[laughs]

421
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,333
Yeah, it was like this.

422
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:21,682
[sheep bawling]

423
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:23,292
- [Voiceover] Every season,

424
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:26,774
Kurdish shepherds lead their
flocks above the desert heat.

425
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:31,735
To graze in pastures fed
by the melting ice cap.

426
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:35,696
The warmer the summer,

427
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:38,002
the greater the exposure,

428
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:41,658
leading to the most
intriguing of local legends.

429
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,675
- [Voiceover] Throughout
the 1800s, they came.

430
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:02,505
In 1856, local boy, Haji
Yearam, and his father,

431
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,638
were hired by three
unbelieving scientists

432
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:07,075
to take them up to the ark.

433
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:08,729
When the scientists
saw the vessel,

434
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:12,036
they flew into a rage, and
attempted to destroy it.

435
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,256
- They took a blood oath,

436
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,432
that if any one of the three
ever revealed the truth,

437
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,564
the other two would kill him.

438
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:19,043
- [Voiceover] Some
50 years later,

439
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:21,220
one of the scientists gave
a deathbed confession,

440
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,744
which corroborated
Haji Yearam's story.

441
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:26,312
- [Voiceover] In July, 1955,

442
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:29,576
Fernand Nevara, traveling
with his son, Rafael,

443
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:31,752
climbed Mount Ararat.

444
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:35,582
Rafael saw the ark
first, in a crevasse.

445
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,671
After lowering himself
into the crevasse,

446
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:40,326
and using a pick axe to
chop through the ice,

447
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,763
"I found wood!" he called.

448
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:44,634
Yes, Nevarra had found wood.

449
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:46,767
But, was it a piece of the ark?

450
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,073
- [Voiceover] Testing
proved it wasn't old enough.

451
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,771
The wood was from
the 8th century,

452
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:53,600
4,000 years after Noah's time.

453
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:56,820
But, what was the wood doing
on the slopes of Ararat?

454
00:20:57,865 --> 00:20:59,170
- What I have listed here,

455
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:00,737
are four reports of the
ark with the door off,

456
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:03,566
seven reports of
one end broken off,

457
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,176
18 reports of sticking
out of the ice --

458
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,613
- [Voiceover] In 1883,

459
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,441
reports issued by a
Turkish commission,

460
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,834
investigating avalanches
on Mount Ararat,

461
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:12,575
detailed that they
had seen Noah's ark

462
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,621
protruding from a glacier.

463
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:15,926
- [Voiceover] Prince
Nouri declared

464
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,015
that he had found the
ark, high on Ararat,

465
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,800
that he walked within its walls,

466
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:20,975
and that it's measurements

467
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:23,934
were exactly as
described in the Bible.

468
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,719
- [Voiceover] There are nine
reports of a melt-water pond,

469
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:27,982
eight reports
sitting on a ledge,

470
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:30,245
10 reports of a ravine,
valley, gully --

471
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,552
- [Voiceover] In 1902, as a boy,

472
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:34,423
Armenian, George Hagopian,

473
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:36,033
was taken to the
ark by his uncle.

474
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:37,600
- [Voiceover] You saw
it how many times?

475
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:38,688
- [George] Twice.

476
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:39,385
- [Voiceover] Twice?

477
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:40,255
- [George] Mm hmm.

478
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:42,823
- [Voiceover] In 1916,

479
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:45,260
Russian aviator,
Vladamir Roskovitsky

480
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,044
described how he saw the ark,

481
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:50,134
while on a flight
over Mount Ararat.

482
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:51,527
The czar sent soldiers
up the mountain

483
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:53,660
to confirm the sighting.

484
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:55,096
They brought back photographs,

485
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:57,664
displaying hundreds
of rooms with cages.

486
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:00,710
But, the Bolshevik Revolution
occurred shortly thereafter,

487
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,712
and the photographs
were destroyed.

488
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:08,283
- [Davis] You could see
a large vessel there,

489
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,460
laying on its side --

490
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,680
- These guys didn't even
know what they had seen.

491
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:14,637
They just described it to us.

492
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:16,422
They realized it
was a huge boat.

493
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:18,119
- He said he saw this object,

494
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:19,642
this murky object in the snow,

495
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:23,646
and he said it looked like
timbers from Noah's ark.

496
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,779
- [Davis] And then, off
to the left back here,

497
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:28,825
is the part that broke off.

498
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:32,655
And it is laying slightly down.

499
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:34,918
You could see in the back of it.

500
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,922
- Of all the people that have
said they've seen Noah's Ark,

501
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:42,622
Ed Davis has the most
reliable eye-witness account.

502
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:46,756
- He had been there as part of
the Army Corps of Engineers,

503
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,367
building roads.

504
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,283
He rescued the grandson of
one of the Kurdish chieftains.

505
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:54,677
- The only way that they
could say thank you,

506
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:58,942
was to share with them their
most precious possession,

507
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:01,205
which was the remains
of Noah's Ark.

508
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,686
- He got within about
a hundred yards of it.

509
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,558
Storm kept them
from getting closer,

510
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:08,343
but he viewed it with
the army field glasses.

511
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,824
- Comes back after the war,
tells a few people about it.

512
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:13,261
I find out about it, I go
give him a lie detector test,

513
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:14,741
we give him three
lie detector tests.

514
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:16,177
He passes all three of them.

515
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,744
- He passed one
with flying colors.

516
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:19,572
- I mean, you just
can't dismiss this.

517
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:22,705
- Okay, three reports
of a stream and a pond.

518
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:25,926
The point is, we
have so many reports,

519
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:27,449
and many of them
say the same things.

520
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:29,320
- [Voiceover] They describe

On land, we can

they might have layers of ash

00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:19,660
It's glaciated,

697
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:22,706
and will have been even
more heavily glaciated,

698
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,622
back in the ice ages.
and that

699
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:29,670
The action of those glaciers
is to remove material,

700
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:30,932
all the rocks and boulders,

701
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:33,413
and carry them down the slope.

702
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:36,851
And that's reflecting
the erosive processes

703
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,461
that have occurred.

704
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:40,681
- So, this is base camp.

705
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:42,596
We're about 10,000 feet.

706
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,511
Camp two is, what?

707
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:46,948
1,000 meter?"
- 1,00 meters up.

708
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,342
- 1,000 meters up.

709
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:51,735
- Yesterday was our easiest day.

710
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:52,301
Took us about --

711
00:31:52,345 --> 00:31:53,607
[gunshot]

712
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,609
Took us about six hours

713
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:56,566
- There's some gunfire.

714
00:31:57,828 --> 00:32:00,048
- Yeah, we just heard some ...

715
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:03,530
... just heard some gunfire.

716
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:04,618
Just right up above us, there,

717
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:06,750
so somewhere ...

718
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:07,577
That's interesting.

719
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:08,796
- You get the feeling

720
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,451
this is not a place
you wanna get hurt.

721
00:32:11,494 --> 00:32:14,149
This is not the place you
wanna do something stupid.

722
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:16,586
Because, it's a
long way to help.

723
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:24,768
Not a great environment
for anything to go wrong.

724
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:26,422
- [Voiceover] So, Jim's
hurt, he's busted up,

725
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:27,989
can't move.

726
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:30,687
- [Voiceover] It nearly killed
him, nearly took his life.

727
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:32,602
- Jim Irwin was a
dedicated astronaut,

728
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:33,734
a very fine man,

729
00:32:33,777 --> 00:32:37,651
a highly reasoned individual.

730
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:40,001
He worked very hard on
the Apollo 15 mission.

731
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:43,048
- [Irwin] Dave, an extraordinary
television picture, here.

732
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:45,528
Okay, Huston as I

733
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:48,662
stand out here, in the
wonders of the unknown,

734
00:32:48,705 --> 00:32:50,881
at Hadley, I grow to realize,

735
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:55,538
there's a fundamental
truth to our nature.

736
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:57,105
Man must explore.

737
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:00,543
And this is exploration
at its greatest.

738
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:03,851
It was just a very
significant time in my life,

739
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:05,374
to be on another world.

740
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:08,421
A world where there's no life,

741
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:10,727
there was no sound,

742
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:11,946
there was no sky,

743
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,774
just looking up into
the blackness of space.

744
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:17,517
Looking up and marveling
at the beauty of the earth.

745
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,998
And, there it was, in
the blackness of space,

746
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,087
but, so small that I could
hold it between my fingers,

747
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,045
like a little marble.

748
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,743
In a spiritual sense,
I felt magnified.

749
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:30,530
Because, I was holding
God's special creation

750
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:31,661
between my fingers,

751
00:33:31,705 --> 00:33:33,185
and really seeing
it with his eyes.

752
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:36,144
- [Voiceover] Splashdown,
we have splashdown.

753
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:37,754
- His mission on Earth,

754
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:41,541
after being an astronaut
on the Apollo mission 15,

755
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:44,457
is to find Noah's Ark.

756
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,069
- He said, "You know, I'm
planning a trip to Mount Ararat,

757
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:49,157
"to look for Noah's Ark,

758
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:50,419
do you think you'd want to go?"

759
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:53,596
- Here was a man who
stood on the moon,

760
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,424
and he said that wasn't
the greatest achievement

761
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:56,338
of his life.

762
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:57,861
Standing on Mount Ararat was.

763
00:33:57,905 --> 00:34:00,951
- He was disappointed, of
course, when he'd come down,

764
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:03,867
but, keep going back,
year after year.

765
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:05,913
- He just wanted to
find out the truth.

766
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:10,700
[Armenian music]

767
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:11,788
- So, today, we're
gonna move camp,

768
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:14,226
and go on up to 4200.

769
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:16,663
And spend a couple of
nights there to acclimate.

770
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:18,795
And then, on the way
up to the summit.

771
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:30,764
[Armenian music]

772
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:36,639
- I found an anomaly, organic,

773
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,598
on Mount Ararat.

774
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:40,513
- He says, "There's
two rectangular forms,

775
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:43,037
"up on that
mountain,under the ice.

776
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,604
"I've seen them,

777
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:47,128
"on this special satellite
imaging that we got

778
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,478
"that can penetrate ice."

779
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:52,829
- It's a man-made
object, organic.

780
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:56,659
It's not a rock structure,
or anything like that.

781
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:58,574
How it got there, I don't know.

782
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:01,142
And that's not for
me to find out,

783
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:02,752
it's for whoever goes
up there and does it.

784
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:05,364
But, it's definitely
a man-made object.

785
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,148
- Mr. X was

786
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:11,892
a man who worked for NASA,

787
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:15,156
and had access to a radar

788
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,767
that could penetrate the ground,

789
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:19,160
and go into the ice.

790
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:22,598
- My relationship with
the man we call Mr. X

791
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:24,383
goes back about six years,

792
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:27,299
to the beginning of
our current project.

793
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:28,648
- Said, "Well,

794
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:30,693
" actually it's up there
on the eastern plateau."

795
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:32,782
- It is, in fact,
the leads he gave us,

796
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:35,263
that lead us to
the site we're at.

797
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:36,351
- [Mr. X] It's in two pieces,

798
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,657
now it's three,

799
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,833
because the glacier's
moving all the time.

800
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:40,964
- And when the glaciers move,

801
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,053
they start grinding things up.

802
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:45,578
- And, I feel whatever
this object is,

803
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:48,276
here in the next
four to five years,

804
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,801
probably, that will be the
end of the exploration,

805
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:54,674
because it will be
pretty well crushed.

806
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,589
- He's also helped me
with a project in Israel,

807
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:58,678
not just on Mount Ararat.

808
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:01,724
So, I've had a secondary type of

809
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:05,554
means of testing his accuracy.

810
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:08,427
We actually have dug, and
been able to determine things.

811
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,692
- There is photographs, taken
by a branch of the government,

812
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:14,520
years ago.

813
00:36:14,563 --> 00:36:17,523
- [Voiceover] During the
late 50s and early 60s,

814
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,873
the American spy plane, the U-2,

815
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:22,658
was making its global
reconnaissance missions

816
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,530
for military intelligence.

817
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,793
Many of the flights
passed over Ararat,

818
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,055
on their way to Russia,

819
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:29,796
and a number of pilots
reported seeing,

820
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,973
what looked like, a ship,
locked in the ice below.

821
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:36,977
- Irwin and I stood at the front
of Incirlik Air Force Base,

822
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,545
and the commanding general
came out to the gate,

823
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:40,894
and knew Irwin.

824
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:43,940
They knew each other
from times past.

825
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:46,204
And Jim said,

826
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:49,511
"Yeah, we're here
looking for Noah's Ark".

827
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:50,947
And the guy said, "Well,
I've seen the ark."

828
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:55,169
And, I said, "What?"

829
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,738
And Jim's face was
incredulous as well.

830
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:01,219
And he said, "Yeah, I've
got pictures of it".

831
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:03,612
And we said, "Well,
let's see them".

832
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:05,135
He said, "Oh, no.

833
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:06,789
"It's all classified."

834
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,750
- [Voiceover] For decades, the
pictures remained classified

835
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:15,320
but then, in 1995, the CIA
finally released the photos.

836
00:37:15,363 --> 00:37:17,931
- The photographs are
taken way back when,

837
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:21,935
were U-2 and SR-71,

838
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:25,721
which one I looked at,
probably was a U-2.

839
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:28,246
I couldn't find nothing that
didn't look like a rock.

840
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:30,987
- This report came
from here in 1917.

841
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:32,728
They came over from Russia,

842
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:34,208
and they went up
and took it apart.

843
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,514
I mean, there was
so much intrigue,

844
00:37:35,557 --> 00:37:38,560
and shadows.

845
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:43,348
- In 1980, I served onboard
the U.S. nuclear submarine,

846
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:45,611
U.S.S. Casimir Pulaski.

847
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:49,832
As sonar supervisor, I
carried top secret clearance,

848
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:53,532
and was in charge of
classified material.

849
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:54,750
- Somebody would say,
"I have pictures,

850
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:56,143
"here's the documentation."

851
00:37:56,186 --> 00:37:57,623
- In the year 1968,

852
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:00,190
a friend and I were
employed at the Smithsonian,

853
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:03,455
in the vertebrate and
paleontology section,

854
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:04,630
and they had some photographs,

855
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:06,240
which I went over and looked at,

856
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,199
arranged on a table, that had
been taken from a balloon,

857
00:38:09,243 --> 00:38:10,810
they told me,

858
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:14,379
showing a ship-like
object down in some ice.

859
00:38:14,422 --> 00:38:16,990
- Mount Ararat had
been experiencing

860
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:20,210
the warmest weather on record.

861
00:38:20,254 --> 00:38:24,302
As a result, the ice on
the top of the mountain

862
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,521
began to melt.

863
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:28,131
Lo and behold,

864
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:30,351
there sat a large ship.

865
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,657
- They, pretty well, came out,

866
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,007
and told everybody to
keep their mouth shut.

867
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:39,752
- The U.S. military science,
and intelligence community

868
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:41,580
were in complete agreement,

869
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:44,365
that this was, in
fact, Noah's Ark.

870
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:45,497
- Many, many people
believe the Ark

871
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,281
has already been found.

872
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,064
It's a done deal.

873
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:49,588
- [Voiceover] In 1959,

874
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,764
a mysterious boat-shaped object

875
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:55,028
was photographed by a
Turkish reconnaissance pilot.

876
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:57,987
A team of Turkish
explorers and scientists

877
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:59,641
examined the object,

878
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:01,730
and discovered that its
dimensions were indeed

879
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:03,645
near those of the Ark,

880
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:06,474
as stated in the Bible.

881
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:13,568
The September 5, 1960
issue of Life Magazine

882
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:15,309
carried the story.

883
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:20,401
Then, in 1977, Ron Wyatt,
an amateur archaeologist,

884
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:22,882
inspected the site
with a metal detector.

885
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:24,579
- [White] What we
actually have found,

886
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:27,539
is physical evidence
that this is a boat.

887
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:31,586
My personal feeling is,
that it is Noah's Ark.

888
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,587
- Is that Noah's Ark?

889
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:33,893
No. What is it?

890
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:37,418
It's the push-up in
the earth of Riolite.

891
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:40,552
And that was established
by a geologist.

892
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:41,814
- And, there have been people

893
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:43,555
that have been up and
down Mount Ararat,

894
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:45,208
and have come back,
and told lies.

895
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:47,472
There have been movies filmed

896
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:49,387
that have been
outright deception.

897
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,215
Back in March, Noah's Ark
Ministries International,

898
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:53,478
or NAMI,

899
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:56,132
claimed to have found
and entered Noah's Ark.

900
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:57,395
- I mean, they had film footage,

901
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:59,788
and they were inside
the mountain, in a cave.

902
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:02,051
And, they were knocking
on these wooden panels.

903
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:04,097
So, Don was really
intrigued with this.

904
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,403
"Is this real, is this genuine?

905
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:06,447
"I must find out."

906
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:09,232
So, that is the reason he went.

907
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:10,843
- [Voiceover] Donald
Mackenzie was described

908
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:12,801
as a Scottish Indian Jones,

909
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:15,500
who had been to Turkey's
Mount Ararat many times,

910
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:17,502
in search of proof
of Noah's Ark.

911
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:19,678
But, in 2010, he
failed to return

912
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:22,289
from a trip up the mountain.

913
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:24,465
- Went with the intention of

914
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,685
getting answers
to his questions,

915
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:28,556
and then, he simply disappeared.

916
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,688
- Inside of a cave,

917
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:31,559
they found the
remains of the ark.

918
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,518
What's it doing in a cave?

919
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:35,824
Noah didn't drive
the ark into a cave.

920
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:37,522
- They build that stuff.

921
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:39,262
They talked to people that said,

922
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:42,091
"Yeah, they had us up there,
carpenters doing this,

923
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:44,006
"They said this was
gonna be a Noah's Ark,

924
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:47,575
for a film,

925
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:48,620
a movie set."

926
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:49,534
- "Oh, yes, yes, yes."

927
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:50,796
"Everybody knew, yes, yes.

928
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,580
"There were paid money
to carry the wood up

929
00:40:52,624 --> 00:40:53,538
"to the mountain,

930
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:55,757
"and construct the false ark.

931
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:57,672
"Yes, yes, oh yes."

932
00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:59,282
- I think it probably
got to the certain point

933
00:40:59,326 --> 00:41:02,024
to where they had so
much invested in it,

934
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:04,636
that they couldn't admit that,

935
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,681
eh, this could be a hoax.

936
00:41:06,725 --> 00:41:08,596
- If it's God's will
that I don't see

937
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,380
the answers to my questions,

938
00:41:10,424 --> 00:41:12,470
then I accept that.

939
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:13,906
I must accept that.

940
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,564
But we don't know what God's
will is for the future.

941
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:23,176
So, we just continue seeking.

942
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:25,700
- Here comes our
gear on the horses.

943
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:27,833
Up to camp two, at 4200 meters.

944
00:41:27,876 --> 00:41:29,791
So, I'm getting out of the way.

945
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,751
Here goes the last horse.

946
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:37,799
They are much more faster

947
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,585
than we are.

948
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:42,717
But the Kurds

949
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,197
can keep up with them,

950
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:47,679
at the horse's pace.

951
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,855
Plus they smoke.

952
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,336
I don't know how they do it.

953
00:41:57,776 --> 00:42:01,040
No wonder they call
this Agri Dagh,

954
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,433
The Painful Mountain.

955
00:42:03,477 --> 00:42:05,261
And, I can tell you,

956
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:06,654
that it is.

957
00:42:09,614 --> 00:42:11,093
- At 4200 camp,

958
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:14,096
it was almost like the
environment really changed.

959
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:18,666
We went from rocky
slopes, and what have you,

960
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,972
to really rocky.

961
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:26,631
Not even hardly a level
place to put a tent.

962
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:34,160
Like being on the surface of
a Star Trek moon, out there.

963
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:38,773
It really felt like you
were on a different planet.

964
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:48,609
I did have some fears
the first night.

965
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:51,220
When we first got up
there, what happened?

966
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:52,395
A guy had already fallen,

967
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,354
and broken his
shoulder and his leg.

968
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:57,618
- The Kurds around here
tend to yell a lot.

969
00:42:57,662 --> 00:43:00,621
But this was a
gut-wrenching scream.

970
00:43:00,665 --> 00:43:02,101
Several of them.

971
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:06,018
- We got a guy who fell down
the ravine, on the snow.

972
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:07,672
Looks like he's got a
compound break in his leg.

973
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:08,934
We're back at camp,

974
00:43:08,977 --> 00:43:10,544
trying to find stuff
to make a stretcher.

975
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,719
He's a big fella.

976
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:12,633
We're gonna bring you
along for the ride.

977
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:15,201
[man yelling]

978
00:43:15,244 --> 00:43:18,596
[yelling in a foreign language]

979
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:20,859
- [Will] Gotta get to the
rock, It's most steady.

980
00:43:27,213 --> 00:43:28,344
- He's got it, he's a doctor.

981
00:43:41,793 --> 00:43:43,316
- [Jose] It's coming.

982
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,534
Yeah,

983
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:45,535
Okay?

984
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:47,755
Just stay warm, are you warm?

985
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:49,365
Okay.

986
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:51,672
He was very uncomfortable
with his shoulder dislocated.

987
00:43:51,716 --> 00:43:52,847
I tried to set it.

988
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:54,893
But shoulders are
very difficult to set.

989
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:56,285
I tried once, I
told him, "no more",

990
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:59,637
because it will just

991
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,160
knock you out with pain.

992
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:02,378
- So, what we're waiting for,

993
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:04,554
is a military
helicopter to come.

994
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:07,079
At the moment the
visibility is good,

995
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:09,559
but in these conditions,
you never know

996
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:11,170
when the helicopter arrives,

997
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:13,215
it may cloud over, and
we'll have to wait.

998
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:16,436
- A helicopter here is not
normally supposed to happen.

999
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:19,700
Because, any one, of a
number of fighting factions,

1000
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:20,919
could shoot it down.

1001
00:44:20,962 --> 00:44:22,877
- The weather just
started clouding up,

1002
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:24,574
and there was zero viz.

1003
00:44:24,618 --> 00:44:27,795
So, after about an
hour of loiter time,

1004
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:32,104
they decided that they'd have
to move the casualty down.

1005
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:34,410
They were going towards 3200,

1006
00:44:34,454 --> 00:44:36,804
but there's another place
between here and 3200,

1007
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:38,545
only about a quarter
of the way down,

1008
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:40,590
and the helicopter was
able to land there.

1009
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:42,941
- So, a big fella.

1010
00:44:42,984 --> 00:44:45,030
He had, not very good equipment.

1011
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:45,944
He was alone.

1012
00:44:45,987 --> 00:44:47,554
- He did not have crampons on.

1013
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:50,426
- Physically, not in
the best of conditions

1014
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,950
to be doing something like this.

1015
00:44:51,993 --> 00:44:52,951
He must have lost his footing,

1016
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:54,735
and it cost him.

1017
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:59,697
[helicopter taking off]

1018
00:45:08,488 --> 00:45:11,491
- On the top of that mountain,
life slows down a lot.

1019
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:13,536
You have time to think.

1020
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,756
But, when you have that
time to really reflect,

1021
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,802
and to chew on stuff,

1022
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:20,065
and you run out of the
simple little decisions

1023
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:21,544
that you have to
make in a busy life,

1024
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:23,677
and all you are left
with is the big stuff,

1025
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,811
you have the chance to,
kinda, explore that,

1026
00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:29,727
if not with others,
at least personally.

1027
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:36,516
[thunder rolls]

1028
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:43,131
[thunder claps]

1029
00:45:43,175 --> 00:45:47,527
[ice hitting the ground]

1030
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:50,573
[horses neighing]

1031
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,776
- Snowed last night.

1032
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:23,519
It either blew off, or
started melting already.

1033
00:46:23,563 --> 00:46:25,347
It's very beautiful up here.

1034
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:26,740
It was kind of windy last night,

1035
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,394
but the wind has
died down, yet again.

1036
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:29,699
Feeling good.

1037
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:32,615
I think we're starting
to physically get ready

1038
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:33,965
for the next part of the climb,

1039
00:46:34,008 --> 00:46:36,924
which is going up to the top.

1040
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:40,362
- What is hopeful, is that
there is enough ice up there

1041
00:46:40,406 --> 00:46:43,148
to entomb

1042
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:45,411
a vessel of quite some size.

1043
00:46:45,454 --> 00:46:47,326
I think that most
people would agree

1044
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:48,849
that we could be dealing with

1045
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:51,460
a hundred feet of ice,
or more, in some areas.

1046
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:55,813
So, it could be saved
for all of perpetuity,

1047
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:57,989
somewhere to have a woolly
mammoth would be saved,

1048
00:46:58,032 --> 00:47:01,557
after digging that up in
the Siberian wilderness.

1049
00:47:01,601 --> 00:47:03,124
So, that's the theory, at least.

1050
00:47:03,168 --> 00:47:04,778
- For remnant wood
to be preserved

1051
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,824
for long amounts of time,

1052
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:09,870
generally you need an
oxygen free environment.

1053
00:47:09,914 --> 00:47:11,959
You need that piece
of wood to be locked

1054
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:14,744
or entombed in
sediments, like in a bog,

1055
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:16,659
or underneath a lot
of marine sediments,

1056
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:18,618
that is oxygen free.

1057
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:20,663
Because when you have
oxygen in an environment,

1058
00:47:20,707 --> 00:47:22,796
you have fungi, and you
have bacteria, that,

1059
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,538
once that organism
dies, that tree dies,

1060
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:27,757
bacteria and fungi
are gonna attack,

1061
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:30,630
and start eating and
decomposing that piece of wood.

1062
00:47:30,673 --> 00:47:31,936
- What we don't know,

1063
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:34,677
is how long the ark was
exposed to the elements

1064
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:36,418
prior to being entombed in ice.

1065
00:47:36,462 --> 00:47:39,073
- If organic material, or
wood, or other features

1066
00:47:39,117 --> 00:47:40,422
was locked in the ice,

1067
00:47:40,466 --> 00:47:42,424
and remained cold and dry,

1068
00:47:42,468 --> 00:47:44,339
it would have the potential
to last very long.

1069
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,341
- There's no reason
to think that wood

1070
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:48,778
of any kind of density or size,

1071
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:51,303
wouldn't be able to
survive, locked in ice

1072
00:47:51,346 --> 00:47:53,479
for 4,360 years.

1073
00:47:53,522 --> 00:47:56,264
I mean we have the frozen
mammoths in Siberia,

1074
00:47:56,308 --> 00:47:58,527
and if you believe
evolutionary time scales,

1075
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,703
they've been there
for 25,000 years.

1076
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:02,444
- I think the only
slam dunk that we have

1077
00:48:02,488 --> 00:48:05,012
is that we've just gotta
drill something up.

1078
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:07,101
And it's gotta be wood.

1079
00:48:10,757 --> 00:48:13,542
- 1:00 breakfast,
2-2:30 departure?

1080
00:48:13,586 --> 00:48:15,370
- Yeah, 2:30, or so, departure.

1081
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:16,632
That seems to usually work.

1082
00:48:16,676 --> 00:48:18,852
Now, my biggest concern is,

1083
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,723
I'm not too worried about
what's happening up top,

1084
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:22,682
but if you see a lot of
clouds come up from below,

1085
00:48:22,725 --> 00:48:24,336
that may cause us to delay.

1086
00:48:24,379 --> 00:48:26,599
But, if it's clear below,

1087
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:27,687
but cloudy up top, I'm
not as worried about that.

1088
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:28,688
'Cause it usually blows over.

1089
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:30,603
But, if it's coming from below,

1090
00:48:31,647 --> 00:48:35,216
then that could be a less
than ideal day, to start.

1091
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:40,178
- It's trending about
10 to 15 degrees colder

1092
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:41,831
than I've ever seen it.

1093
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:43,877
That little plaque up
there, that shiny thing,

1094
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,139
that's actually a commemorative.

1095
00:48:45,183 --> 00:48:47,359
There was a Iranian
climber that disappeared

1096
00:48:47,402 --> 00:48:48,099
a couple years ago.

1097
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:49,622
They never found him.

1098
00:48:49,665 --> 00:48:51,189
- Right before you make
your ascent up the mountain,

1099
00:48:51,232 --> 00:48:53,539
they have that plaque up there,
of all the people who died.

1100
00:48:53,582 --> 00:48:55,236
And that was terrifying for me.

1101
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,022
I was like, "Is my name
gonna be on that plaque?

1102
00:48:58,065 --> 00:49:00,502
"What am I doing here?"

1103
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:02,678
Those kind of emotions
run through you.

1104
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:04,637
And then the fact that you think

1105
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,117
you may just die
from the Kurd food

1106
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,206
always crosses your mind.

1107
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:13,254
[singing in a foreign language]

1108
00:49:17,693 --> 00:49:20,914
Basically, whatever they put
in front of me, I'd eat it.

1109
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,655
Who knows what it was.

1110
00:49:22,698 --> 00:49:24,309
- It's gonna be

1111
00:49:24,352 --> 00:49:26,050
and adventure, I think,
for me, at least.

1112
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:27,703
I've been eating, drinking well.

1113
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:34,145
I think going up is gonna be

1114
00:49:34,188 --> 00:49:35,015
a whole lot different

1115
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:36,364
at that altitude.

1116
00:49:36,408 --> 00:49:37,713
I'm not used to it.

1117
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:46,853
- [Aaron] We got up about 1 a.m.

1118
00:49:46,896 --> 00:49:48,507
We packed up, had
a light breakfast

1119
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,204
that the Kurds prepared for us.

1120
00:49:51,814 --> 00:49:55,905
And, about 3 a.m. we started
to make for the summit.

1121
00:49:57,168 --> 00:49:58,996
It's dark, it's cold,

1122
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,780
you got your headlamps on.

1123
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:02,564
You want to be back
in your sleeping bag.

1124
00:50:02,608 --> 00:50:05,219
You know you're gonna have to
climb this trail in the dark.

1125
00:50:05,263 --> 00:50:06,481
You can't see.

1126
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:07,961
These steps are steep.

1127
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,790
The journey from 14,000
feet, to nearly 17,000 feet,

1128
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:13,575
this is the steepest
part of the climb.

1129
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:29,548
Somewhere between
15,000 and 16,000 feet,

1130
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:31,376
altitude hit me.

1131
00:50:31,419 --> 00:50:33,465
And I was really fatigued.

1132
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,731
I was tired, I was slowing down.

1133
00:50:38,774 --> 00:50:41,864
I was getting nauseous, and
actually stopped to throw up.

1134
00:50:45,216 --> 00:50:47,044
My hands are completely numb.

1135
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:48,523
- [Will] Cold or just tired?

1136
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,134
Or both?

1137
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:50,786
- I think the lack of oxygen.

1138
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,092
- [Will] Yeah.

1139
00:50:54,399 --> 00:50:55,704
- [Bill] Look at the
mountain's shadow now.

1140
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:58,664

that's gorgeous.

six in the morning,

1142

and the sun had just
started coming up,

1143
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:03,843
and I turned around,

1144
00:51:03,886 --> 00:51:06,324
and I saw the shadow
of Ararat below me.

1145
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,543
It really inspired me to say,

1146
00:51:08,587 --> 00:51:10,415

00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:04,893
And I was stirred.

1219
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:07,200
- This is a place that very
few people have ever been.

1220
00:54:08,114 --> 00:54:11,596
This is a place where
civilization started again.

1221
00:54:12,466 --> 00:54:14,860
And, it was, you know,

1222
00:54:14,903 --> 00:54:16,644
just chills were all over me.

1223
00:54:16,688 --> 00:54:18,559
- I couldn't say a
word, I was like,

1224
00:54:18,603 --> 00:54:20,039
"I'm really here.

1225
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:21,780
"This is awesome".

1226
00:54:21,823 --> 00:54:23,303
♪ And you breathe it

1227
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:24,522
♪ It's unforgettable

1228
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:26,175
♪ When you know it

1229
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:27,525
♪ Once you know it

1230
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:29,004
♪ And you hold it

1231
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:30,658
♪ It's unforgettable.

1232
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:34,140
- The ark has a very,
very strong pull to it.

1233
00:54:34,183 --> 00:54:36,577
I think, if one is not careful,
it can become an obsession.

1234
00:54:36,621 --> 00:54:39,450
- Part of you wants
to fold the dream up,

1235
00:54:39,493 --> 00:54:42,453
just put it away, and think,
"Why am I wasting my time?"

1236
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,498
But there's still a part of you,

1237
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:46,892
that's always looking
for this sliver of hope.

1238
00:54:46,935 --> 00:54:48,154
- [sighs]

1239
00:54:48,197 --> 00:54:51,723
Well, we look for
more information,

1240
00:54:52,811 --> 00:54:55,379
and we take the leads
that we're given,

1241
00:54:56,554 --> 00:54:57,729
and we work with them.

1242
00:54:57,772 --> 00:55:00,558
- I'm not religious,
and that sense that

1243
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:04,562
I'm gonna have my emotions
put me somewhere there,

1244
00:55:04,605 --> 00:55:08,130
I do it strictly
technical and scientific.

1245
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,219
And, if I say there's
something there,

1246
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:11,612
it's there.

1247
00:55:11,656 --> 00:55:13,135
Period.

1248
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,357
- Based on the GPS coordinates
given to us by Mr X

1249
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,707
in 2009, and then in 2010,

1250
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:21,361
what we did, was
we set up a grid,

1251
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:24,930
and started surveying with
the ground penetrating radar.

1252
00:55:24,973 --> 00:55:27,498
Knowing this is in ice
area, in a locked glacier,

1253
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:31,893
we concluded GPR was the
go-to investigation tool.

1254
00:55:31,937 --> 00:55:34,200
What ground
penetrating radar does,

1255
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:36,811
it sends continuous bursts
of short wave length

1256
00:55:36,855 --> 00:55:39,292
electromagnetic energy
into the ground.

1257
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,555
It basically penetrates the ice,

1258
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,123
and when it bounces off
something that's either harder,

1259
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:45,167
or of a different material,

1260
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:46,517
it will reflect.

1261
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,780
This is the bedrock, down here.

1262
00:55:48,823 --> 00:55:51,130
This is the ice, up in here.

1263
00:55:51,173 --> 00:55:53,350
And, as you see,
this green circles

1264
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:56,483
around a very unique-looking
straight line,

1265
00:55:56,527 --> 00:56:00,182
that's at an angle of
approximately 30 degrees

1266
00:56:00,226 --> 00:56:01,619
to the horizontal.

1267
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:03,360
These two anomalies
were symmetric,

1268
00:56:03,403 --> 00:56:05,187
in other words, almost
like they would be,

1269
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:07,233
this shape in the ice.

1270
00:56:09,714 --> 00:56:13,326
So, the results of
2010 were promising.

1271
00:56:16,285 --> 00:56:19,114
In 2011 we did
all the red lines.

1272
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:20,638
This data we collected
in order to get

1273
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:23,510
more of a three dimensional
diagram of what was there.

1274
00:56:23,554 --> 00:56:25,556
The bedrock is gonna be blue.

1275
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,558
This is all filled
with ice above it,

1276
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:29,603
where the grey is.

1277
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:32,258
And then, the pink things
are basically the anomalies

1278
00:56:32,301 --> 00:56:33,520
that are in the ice, itself.

1279
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:35,566
If you take three
dimensional data,

1280
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:37,350
you get a little bit better idea

1281
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:40,527
of how that would
look in reality.

1282
00:56:40,571 --> 00:56:42,529
- I felt like we had a fairly

1283
00:56:42,573 --> 00:56:44,792
strong expedition in 2011.

1284
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:47,621
We had good support
from the Kurdistine.

1285
00:56:47,665 --> 00:56:50,058
We had the ground
penetrating radar,

1286
00:56:50,102 --> 00:56:51,756
and we were prepared to dig,

1287
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:54,323
and made an attempt at
one of the dig locations

1288
00:56:54,367 --> 00:56:57,501
that we were told, "This
is where you need to go".

1289
00:56:57,544 --> 00:56:59,590
We spent another 10
days trying to dig down

1290
00:56:59,633 --> 00:57:01,113
to this location,

1291
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:02,897
but we were inexperienced
in how to make that happen.

1292
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:05,465
So, we didn't have the right
kind of hoists, and so forth,

1293
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:06,727
to help us in the process,

1294
00:57:06,771 --> 00:57:08,512
and so we failed,
during our permit time,

1295
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:10,992
to get down deep, to where
we thought we needed to be.

1296
00:57:11,036 --> 00:57:13,604
- We would go back and
talk to Mr. X, and say,

1297
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:14,779
"Okay, where were we?

1298
00:57:14,822 --> 00:57:16,389
"Were we close, were we not?"

1299
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,392
In this 2011 work, he said
"You're right next to it".

1300
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,612
- 2012 we came back,
more prepared than ever.

1301
00:57:22,613 --> 00:57:24,223
We had a great plan.

1302
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:26,704
Assembled, I think,
a rock star team.

1303
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:28,923
- 2012, we found more anomalies,

1304
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:31,709
in this case, because we did
three dimensional techniques,

1305
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:34,625
it was easier to take slices,

1306
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:36,496
both horizontally
and vertically,

1307
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,455
so we could see
more information.

1308
00:57:38,498 --> 00:57:41,066
I was looking, initially,
at these red zones,

1309
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:43,677
as being the areas
to go concentrate on.

1310
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:47,594
And, we see this, sort of,
red and yellow square area,

1311
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:48,856
and we're thinking
that is interesting,

1312
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,206
because it keeps showing up

1313
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:54,514
at the 30 to 40 foot range.

1314
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:56,037
And we say,

1315
00:57:56,081 --> 00:57:57,125
"Okay, we have satellite
imagery saying it's there.

1316
00:57:57,169 --> 00:57:58,300
"We have an anomaly there.

1317
00:57:58,344 --> 00:57:59,737
"we have all this information."

1318
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,434
So, we're thinking
that's probably

1319
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,001
the best place to excavate.

1320
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:04,219
- Anomaly here, here, and here,

1321
00:58:04,263 --> 00:58:05,525
at the depths that
the satellite said.

1322
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:08,006
We've got two for two
confirmations, so far.

1323
00:58:08,049 --> 00:58:10,878
Let's go ahead and
drill for the first one,

1324
00:58:10,922 --> 00:58:12,663
the closest one to the surface.

1325
00:58:12,706 --> 00:58:13,881
So, we get the drill out,

1326
00:58:13,925 --> 00:58:15,492
and we start going down,

1327
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:17,450
and right at the
32 foot mark, we --

1328
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,669
[imitates drill
hitting something]

1329
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:19,626
I'm on one side of
the drill, we felt it,

1330
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:20,888
and we hit something hard.

1331
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:23,543
- And then, John Bryant
came down, and said,

1332
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:25,023
"Okay, hold.

1333
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:26,503
"We think we're at it.

1334
00:58:26,546 --> 00:58:28,330
"All you gotta do is
take a dig team up there,

1335
00:58:28,374 --> 00:58:30,768
"and put the tent
over the drill bit,

1336
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:32,987
"and you guys will work
your way down to it.

1337
00:58:33,031 --> 00:58:34,467
"You'll find it 34 meters down."

1338
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,686
- We got a team
of Kurds cutting,

1339
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:37,165
we got a team of
Americans cutting.

1340
00:58:37,209 --> 00:58:39,124
We're switching because
communication is important

1341
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:40,560
with chainsaws in small spaces.

1342
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:43,563
- So, for ten days, we
chopped away at this.

1343
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:46,958
Taking this thing apart, one
core drill bit at a time,

1344
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:48,568
which is very to meter long.

1345
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:50,570
- So the hole is growing,

1346
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:52,224
because we were going
one meter a day,

1347
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:54,400
which is the length
of each auger bit.

1348
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:56,445
So, taking off a meter is
like our victory trophy.

1349
00:58:56,489 --> 00:58:57,577
We have achieved our goal.

1350
00:58:57,621 --> 00:58:59,100
- Randall Price was with us,

1351
00:58:59,144 --> 00:59:01,276
and we were doing core
samples out of this

1352
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,235
eight foot by eight foot hole.

1353
00:59:03,278 --> 00:59:05,716
- With every meter, we
got more and more excited.

1354
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:07,369
- Hopes were just really high.

1355
00:59:07,413 --> 00:59:09,241
We knew all we have to do
was get down to this object.

1356
00:59:09,284 --> 00:59:10,721
- [Will] We knew we
were on the brink of,

1357
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:14,681
what could be, the greatest
archaeology discovery so far,

1358
00:59:14,725 --> 00:59:16,161
or of all time, for that matter.

1359
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:18,293
- [Holt] So, we decided,
since the sun was going down,

1360
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:19,556
let's wait 'til tomorrow,

1361
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:20,774
it'll be better for the cameras.

1362
00:59:20,818 --> 00:59:22,776
Let's just make this
big reveal tomorrow.

1363
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,256
I remember going
to bed that night,

1364
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:27,215
and just laying in the
tent, and just thinking

1365
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:29,609
how this is gonna
change my life,

1366
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:33,744
and change, really,
so many things.

1367
00:59:33,787 --> 00:59:36,398
- And, the night
before, thinking, "This
is gonna be great!"

1368
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:37,617
- The next morning, we got up.

1369
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,097
We all went over
to the meal tent,

1370
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,098
just pumped up,

1371
00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:42,187
patting each other on the back.

1372
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,884
Talking abut this great moment

1373
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:45,538
that we were gonna be a part of.

1374
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,844
So, I got down
into the hole and,

1375
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:49,629
cut away the last meter.

1376
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:53,372
And, just as we were working
that last block out --

1377
00:59:53,415 --> 00:59:54,939
- The last auger, with
the bit on the end,

1378
00:59:54,982 --> 00:59:55,853
fell over.

1379
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:58,769
- Just fell over, on the ice.

1380
00:59:58,812 --> 01:00:00,640
- But, it's supposed to be
stuck into something, right?

1381
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:03,251
I was on the drill, I
remember feeling it.

1382
01:00:03,295 --> 01:00:04,818
We all looked at each other,
like "Nothing happened".

1383
01:00:04,862 --> 01:00:05,732
Oh!

1384
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:08,648
What now?

1385
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:10,171
- I remember picking it
up, and looking inside it,

1386
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:13,087
and it was chock full of ice.

1387
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:17,048
And, just, disappointment,
just, all over me.

1388
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:19,616
I wanted just to set it
back down in the hole again.

1389
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:22,314
I didn't wanna be a
part of this bad moment,

1390
01:00:22,357 --> 01:00:24,359
where, of course,
everybody's wondering

1391
01:00:24,403 --> 01:00:25,970
what is going on.

1392
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:29,147
We didn't really say much,

1393
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:30,278
we just set it over to
the side, and we thought,

1394
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:32,498
well maybe we were
off, obviously,

1395
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:34,718
that's not stuck
in the object but,

1396
01:00:34,761 --> 01:00:37,111
ground penetrating radar seems
to think it's this far deep,

1397
01:00:37,155 --> 01:00:38,722
so maybe we're just
off a couple feet,

1398
01:00:38,765 --> 01:00:41,028
so we dug another
couple layers out.

1399
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:43,596
- We dug down past it, and
there was nothing there.

1400
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,207
- Then we had them drop the
drill bits down into the hole.

1401
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:48,601
We began to just punch holes

1402
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,124
all around the bottom,

1403
01:00:50,168 --> 01:00:52,344
just thinking, "Maybe
we'll pull up something."

1404
01:00:52,387 --> 01:00:53,911
- I remember drilling
five meters --

1405
01:00:55,042 --> 01:00:56,609
Three meters?

1406
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,611
I know there were meters in
every possible direction.

1407
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,569
- Nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing.

1408
01:01:00,613 --> 01:01:02,963
- Everybody's heart
just plummeted.

1409
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:04,704
We went from the night before,

1410
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,532
giving testimonies on how
we really felt the Lord

1411
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:07,707
directing us all here,

1412
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:08,839
and how everything
had gone so well,

1413
01:01:08,882 --> 01:01:10,536
and this was the biggest
expedition to date.

1414
01:01:10,579 --> 01:01:13,060
And we had all the right
people, and the right equipment.

1415
01:01:13,104 --> 01:01:14,496
It had gone so well.

1416
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:17,674
- From being, what I
thought, just hours before,

1417
01:01:17,717 --> 01:01:21,678
was gonna be just a big
highlight of my life,

1418
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:23,027
to this huge disappointment.

1419
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:24,593
In this case, three years prior

1420
01:01:24,637 --> 01:01:26,595
of freezing cold temperatures,

1421
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:29,163
unbelievable
weather, devastation,

1422
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:30,730
people being hurt.

1423
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,514
And, you're so ready,

1424
01:01:32,558 --> 01:01:34,995
and it just, it wasn't there.

1425
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:36,127
- We got full grown men crying.

1426
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:37,432
They've staked a lot,

1427
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:41,001
emotionally, in their
fields of study.

1428
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:42,046
- I climbed out of the hole,

1429
01:01:42,089 --> 01:01:43,700
I grabbed my pack,

1430
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:45,266
and I just walked down
the mountain that day.

1431
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:47,573
- Had it been there,
we would have found it,

1432
01:01:47,616 --> 01:01:48,617
but it wasn't.

1433
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:49,967
And that led to an emotional --

1434
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:50,794
[imitates crashing sound]

1435
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:52,665
and down they went.

1436
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,885
And, after we cleaned
things up, down we went.

1437
01:01:54,928 --> 01:01:56,538
- We're not done yet.

1438
01:01:56,582 --> 01:01:58,105
We're just taking
a bit of a break.

1439
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:08,072
- I'm excited.

1440
01:02:08,115 --> 01:02:10,727
This new, special ground
penetrating radar,

1441
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:14,382
that is supposed to
be specific for ice.

1442
01:02:14,426 --> 01:02:15,732
- [Holt] We're gonna put all
the lessons we've learned,

1443
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:17,168
from these five years,

1444
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:19,431
be more prepared,
better technology.

1445
01:02:19,474 --> 01:02:21,694
We have, basically,
secret GPS coordinates,

1446
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:22,695
- Just downloaded the GPS data,

1447
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,957
that's a good sign.

1448
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:25,829
- We're gonna finally
hit, what we have missed

1449
01:02:25,872 --> 01:02:26,830
in previous years.

1450
01:02:26,873 --> 01:02:28,048
- This excites me.

1451
01:02:28,092 --> 01:02:30,311
We've built special
drills, this year.

1452
01:02:30,355 --> 01:02:33,097
And special corers to be
able to pull this stuff out.

1453
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,447
[drilling]

1454
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,535
I know how to drill.

1455
01:02:36,578 --> 01:02:38,015
My people know how to drill.

1456
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:39,799
I want to find organic matter.

1457
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:41,583
- Every year that I go up
to the Eastern Plateau,

1458
01:02:41,627 --> 01:02:44,673
I walk down Shok-mok Peak, and
look down at the Ahora Gorge,

1459
01:02:44,717 --> 01:02:46,458
and think, "This is
where you need to go".

1460
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:49,113
You never feel like you've
finished the ark search,

1461
01:02:49,156 --> 01:02:51,245
if you don't get down
into the Ahora Gorge.

1462
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:52,464
We've never had the
kind of permissions

1463
01:02:52,507 --> 01:02:53,944
that we've had,
to get this close.

1464
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:56,642
- This year we
will either prove,

1465
01:02:56,685 --> 01:03:00,951
the "Yes, it is here",
or "No, it is not".

1466
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:03,780
- Good morning from high camp.

1467
01:03:03,823 --> 01:03:05,564
It's about 5:45 in the morning.

1468
01:03:05,607 --> 01:03:06,652
On our first full day, here.

1469
01:03:06,695 --> 01:03:09,046
We slept pretty
well, last night.

1470
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:10,743
We were able to put in a well,

1471
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,138
and get the chainsaw, generator,

1472
01:03:14,181 --> 01:03:16,401
and several other things
started yesterday.

1473
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:18,533
This morning, we're gonna try
and set up the big gear tent.

1474
01:03:18,577 --> 01:03:20,622
The wind is

1475
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:22,450
not at all, which
is quite unusual,

1476
01:03:22,494 --> 01:03:23,843
so we want to take
advantage of that,

1477
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:26,367
just to get somewhere
to have the equipment,

1478
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:27,542
and a kitchen, and
get out of the wind,

1479
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:29,370
when it starts back up again.

1480
01:03:29,414 --> 01:03:30,894
Looks like it's gonna
be a beautiful morning.

1481
01:03:30,937 --> 01:03:32,069
See you out there.

1482
01:03:33,592 --> 01:03:34,636
Right here?

1483
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,203
I think that sounds good.

1484
01:03:47,388 --> 01:03:51,610
- We've organized most of
the expedition's equipment,

1485
01:03:51,653 --> 01:03:53,438
and, this afternoon,
after lunch,

1486
01:03:53,481 --> 01:03:54,569
which we're about to head up to,

1487
01:03:54,613 --> 01:03:55,832
we hope to start drilling.

1488
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:57,398
Here we go.

1489
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:59,792
- [Bill] We won't be doing
that for about an hour.

1490
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,663
Let's see, it's now 12:10.

1491
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:05,885
- This will be the
real practical part
of the dissertation.

1492
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:07,452
- Yep.

1493
01:04:07,495 --> 01:04:09,758
Let's see, it's now 12:10,

1494
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:10,977
probably about 1:00 sir.

1495
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:12,413
The would be the
time to get ready.

1496
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:13,893
- A lot of people
were on the mountain

1497
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:14,981
for different reasons,

1498
01:04:15,025 --> 01:04:16,635
my reason to be on the mountain,

1499
01:04:16,678 --> 01:04:19,072
was I wanted my
portion of it to be

1500
01:04:19,116 --> 01:04:21,814
as scientifically
accurate as possible,

1501
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,729
so that when the
scientific community

1502
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:25,426
looked at our expedition,

1503
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:28,516
they could say this
was done according to

1504
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,736
good science, and
not junk science.

1505
01:04:30,779 --> 01:04:33,260
Drill and hit wood.

1506
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:35,523
That's what we're
gonna do today.

1507
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:37,743
Speak it into existence,
that's what I always say.

1508
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:38,744
- Okay.

1509
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:43,575
- If the ark is truly intact,

1510
01:04:43,618 --> 01:04:46,012
it'll be approximately
45 foot high.

1511
01:04:46,056 --> 01:04:48,710
- [Voiceover] "The ark
is to be 30 cubits high,

1512
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:52,236
"300 cubits long,
and 50 cubits wide."

1513
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:53,759
- What is a cubit?

1514
01:04:53,802 --> 01:04:56,544
A cubit, historically,
has been recognized,

1515
01:04:56,588 --> 01:04:58,938
generally, as the
length from the elbow,

1516
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:02,724
to the end of the index finger
of the reigning monarch.

1517
01:05:02,768 --> 01:05:04,683
We've averaged the
historical values,

1518
01:05:04,726 --> 01:05:08,600
and come up with 20.5
inches for a cubit.

1519
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:10,863
Which means that
the original ark

1520
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,691
was 500 feet long,

1521
01:05:12,734 --> 01:05:16,477
86 feet wide, 52 feet high.

1522
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:19,698
God said to Noah,

1523
01:05:19,741 --> 01:05:22,092
"Rooms are to be
placed in the ark".

1524
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:23,658
There would be three levels.

1525
01:05:23,702 --> 01:05:26,357
Bulkheads were a vital
part of the structure,

1526
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,359
these room dividers,

1527
01:05:28,402 --> 01:05:32,232
which encompass the
dimension and the hull,

1528
01:05:32,276 --> 01:05:34,365
and some of the floor levels.

1529
01:05:34,408 --> 01:05:37,150
And that gives it a
superior structure.

1530
01:05:37,194 --> 01:05:39,413
- "And build under our eyes,

1531
01:05:39,457 --> 01:05:41,589
"and according to
our inspiration,

1532
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:44,941
"the ark that shall save thee,
and those who follow thee.

1533
01:05:44,984 --> 01:05:47,117
"And do not appeal to
me on behalf of those

1534
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,901
"who are bent on evil doing.

1535
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,209
"For, behold, they are
destined to be drowned."

1536
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:58,737
[wind blowing]

1537
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:05,744
[chainsaw running]

1538
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:09,400
- The guys are gonna start
drilling, Bill, Will, to Bruce.

1539
01:06:09,443 --> 01:06:13,012
And, Jose and I are gonna
start completing this grade,

1540
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:14,927
and make sure this
is all in alignment.

1541
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,060
We're just gonna hit
all though this area,

1542
01:06:17,103 --> 01:06:19,714
and see what we can
come up with today.

1543
01:06:19,758 --> 01:06:21,325
But, we got a good
work day today,

1544
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:23,675
we're gonna take
advantage of it.

1545
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:26,025
- Howdy friends from the U.S.A.

1546
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:29,115
We've come to drill
with Bill and Will.

1547
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:29,768
Woohoo!

1548
01:06:29,811 --> 01:06:33,728
[intense drums]

1549
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:45,566
- [Will] Got it.
- [Bill] Lock it.

1550
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:49,353
[mumbling]

1551
01:06:53,574 --> 01:06:58,710
[drilling]

1552
01:07:11,462 --> 01:07:13,246
- The first thing you
gonna hit on Noah's Ark

1553
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:14,813
is not gonna be wood.

1554
01:07:16,728 --> 01:07:18,860
It's gonna bituminous materials.

1555
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:23,561
Bituminous, meaning
something black and gooey.

1556
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:26,520
An oil based product.

1557
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:29,088
The Bible's clear,

1558
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:32,657
inside and out of Noah's
Ark was covered in pitch.

1559
01:07:37,749 --> 01:07:38,750
So, it'd probably
gonna be something

1560
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:40,621
that's ingrained in the wood,

1561
01:07:40,665 --> 01:07:43,450
and so if you hit it,

1562
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:45,278
it should show you some.

1563
01:07:57,595 --> 01:07:58,726
What I had decided to do,

1564
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,989
is everything that
came out of the hole,

1565
01:08:01,033 --> 01:08:04,123
I was gonna put it
in a pan, heat it up,

1566
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:06,082
and see if any of it melted.

1567
01:08:15,003 --> 01:08:17,005
All bituminous materials

1568
01:08:17,049 --> 01:08:18,572
are temperature susceptible,

1569
01:08:18,616 --> 01:08:21,445
meaning, at a very low
range, they'll melt,

1570
01:08:21,488 --> 01:08:23,664
or they'll become gooey.

1571
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,449
Well, the foil is melting.

1572
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,800
Looks like all rocks.

1573
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:34,066
We did a quick field test,

1574
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,894
just to verify, to make
sure that we weren't

1575
01:08:35,937 --> 01:08:37,678
looking at something
than just bedrock.

1576
01:08:37,722 --> 01:08:38,940
- So, it's just gravel.

1577
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:41,117
- This was verification that

1578
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,119
where we were last
year, is, in fact,

1579
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:44,294
not where we wanna be.

1580
01:08:44,337 --> 01:08:45,773
- Now, we're moving
on th the next spot.

1581
01:08:45,817 --> 01:08:48,733
And, we'll keep doing
that, until time runs out,

1582
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:50,735
and Lord willing, we'll find it

1583
01:08:50,778 --> 01:08:52,389
before our time runs out.

1584
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:56,132
[chopping]

1585
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:07,621
- Today is August 14,

1586
01:09:07,665 --> 01:09:10,755
and hopefully it's a day that
will be remembered in history

1587
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:13,714
as a great day to commemorate

1588
01:09:13,758 --> 01:09:16,543
what was done, thousands
and thousands of years ago.

1589
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:18,284
That God flooded the earth,

1590
01:09:18,328 --> 01:09:20,721
preserved eight people,

1591
01:09:20,765 --> 01:09:23,855
so that the earth
could be repopulated.

1592
01:09:23,898 --> 01:09:27,337
I hope and pray that
today is the day.

1593
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,730
- Because, now time
is of the essence,

1594
01:09:29,774 --> 01:09:31,863
we have to get this right.

1595
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:34,387
We can't just be pock-marking
around on this ice.

1596
01:09:34,431 --> 01:09:36,563
We need to know
precisely where to go,

1597
01:09:36,607 --> 01:09:39,436
and we're gonna see
if we can hit wood.

1598
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:42,700
- This is the RB-1 hole.

1599
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:46,530
Good news, we didn't get stuck.

1600
01:09:46,573 --> 01:09:49,272
So, another hole accomplished.

1601
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:52,753
So far, negative
results, we'll see,

1602
01:09:52,797 --> 01:09:54,538
collecting samples, labeling it,

1603
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:56,757
and then we'll move
on the the next hole.

1604
01:09:56,801 --> 01:09:58,106
- [Jose] We drill, we drill.

1605
01:09:58,150 --> 01:09:59,760
It breaks my heart
to see these guys --

1606
01:10:00,631 --> 01:10:01,719
We get our hopes
up, and we drill,

1607
01:10:01,762 --> 01:10:04,156
and then, to miss, every time.

1608
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,114
Because I feel like
I'm letting them down.

1609
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:07,594
I tell them, "Drill
here, we see something".

1610
01:10:07,638 --> 01:10:08,682
And, when we don't hit it,

1611
01:10:08,726 --> 01:10:11,032
they're going down 17 meters and

1612
01:10:11,076 --> 01:10:13,905
19 1/2 meters, and they're
not hitting anything.

1613
01:10:19,258 --> 01:10:20,433
We keep seeing anomalies,

1614
01:10:20,477 --> 01:10:22,261
but for some reason,
every time we drill,

1615
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:23,915
we don't hit anything.

1616
01:10:25,003 --> 01:10:27,875
With all the ice, we get
a lot of false readings.

1617
01:10:33,446 --> 01:10:35,405
It's like I'm making them
do all that extra work,

1618
01:10:35,448 --> 01:10:38,321
and I do feel like all that
weight is on my shoulders.

1619
01:10:41,498 --> 01:10:42,977
I know, deep down in my heart,

1620
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:44,849
the ark is laying
up here somewhere.

1621
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:55,729
[thunder rolls]

1622
01:10:56,948 --> 01:10:58,210
- One thing I've learned,

1623
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,429
the weather can change
very quickly here,

1624
01:10:59,472 --> 01:11:01,518
from sunny to freezing rain.

1625
01:11:02,736 --> 01:11:05,609
Socked in by fog and clouds.

1626
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:10,178
[wind howling]

1627
01:11:11,571 --> 01:11:15,923
[intense drums]

1628
01:11:42,646 --> 01:11:44,822
- [Will] Our energy
is pretty low.

1629
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:46,563
We've been up here a long time.

1630
01:11:50,784 --> 01:11:55,746
[phone ringing]

1631
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,575
- We were able to get
three more holes in today.

1632
01:11:58,618 --> 01:12:00,968
They were between
13 and 14 meters.

1633
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:03,797
Unfortunately, we didn't come
up with anything exciting.

1634
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:06,191
- [Don] That's a
big disappointment,
but I understand.

1635
01:12:06,234 --> 01:12:07,888
Just proceed with the drilling,

1636
01:12:07,932 --> 01:12:11,414
and extending it per Dr. Bryant.

1637
01:12:13,677 --> 01:12:15,722
That's about all that
can be done, right now.

1638
01:12:15,766 --> 01:12:16,854
- [Will] Will do.

1639
01:12:16,897 --> 01:12:18,029
- We appreciate it.

1640
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:19,596
- Alright, thank you.

1641
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:20,771
Bye.

1642
01:12:26,777 --> 01:12:30,041
- Today we've
drilled three bores,

1643
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:33,697
and in those three, we went
all the way to bedrock.

1644
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,612
The drilling went great,

1645
01:12:35,655 --> 01:12:38,832
but, unfortunately, we
didn't have positive results,

1646
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:40,530
what we're looking for.

1647
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:44,011
- [Aaronl] The air
is much thinner.

1648
01:12:44,055 --> 01:12:45,230
Breathing is hard.

1649
01:12:47,754 --> 01:12:49,539
That takes its toll.

1650
01:12:59,244 --> 01:13:01,072
- [Bruce] I do have a
hard time breathing.

1651
01:13:03,422 --> 01:13:06,077
Working conditions
yesterday was,

1652
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,644
miserable for me.

1653
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:11,561
[wind howling]

1654
01:13:19,917 --> 01:13:21,919
I'm still not
acclimated up here.

1655
01:13:27,751 --> 01:13:29,579
- [Will] We're able to get
the three holes in today,

1656
01:13:29,622 --> 01:13:30,841
and then a storm came in,

1657
01:13:30,884 --> 01:13:32,625
we just got pounded with about

1658
01:13:32,669 --> 01:13:36,977
six inches of 1/4 to
1/2 inch hail, snow,

1659
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:37,848
with lightening.

1660
01:13:37,891 --> 01:13:40,198
[thunder claps]

1661
01:13:40,241 --> 01:13:42,592
- We put a lot of effort into
working earlier in the day,

1662
01:13:42,635 --> 01:13:45,246
so we got our three
holes drilled,

1663
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:46,465
which was our goal.

1664
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:48,424
- Yeah, we'll see what happens.

1665
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:50,643
Probably some cards tonight.

1666
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:51,818
- Probably so.

1667
01:13:51,862 --> 01:13:56,170
[hail hitting the ground]

1668
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,682
- I'm real excited
that Dr. Bryant's here.

1669
01:14:29,726 --> 01:14:31,031
he already got
here before we did.

1670
01:14:31,075 --> 01:14:32,555
- How you doing?

1671
01:14:32,598 --> 01:14:33,860
Good to see you, Adam.

1672
01:14:33,904 --> 01:14:34,557
- Adam.

1673
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,732
- How you doing man?

1674
01:14:35,775 --> 01:14:36,297
- Come here to eat breakfast.

1675
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:38,343
- Alright.

1676
01:14:38,386 --> 01:14:39,692
- Hey Bryant.

1677
01:14:39,736 --> 01:14:41,172
Good to see you.

1678
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:54,968
- Can I get this pack for you?

1679
01:14:55,012 --> 01:14:55,839
- [Bryant] How you doing?

1680
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:57,405
I couldn't wait to get here.

1681
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:03,586
- Having other people
around boosts the morale.

1682
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:04,761
I like that.

1683
01:15:04,804 --> 01:15:07,981
[camp chatter]

1684
01:15:22,866 --> 01:15:25,477
- The perspective of where you
are, here, is unbelievable.

1685
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:30,961
- [Jose] I could show
you the 3-D data.

1686
01:15:32,179 --> 01:15:33,180
There it is.

1687
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:35,313
- Okay.

1688
01:15:37,097 --> 01:15:37,924
- [Jose] A lot of noisy data,

1689
01:15:37,968 --> 01:15:39,883
but it seems to ...

1690
01:15:42,276 --> 01:15:44,452
- This is a very
interesting shape.

1691
01:15:46,237 --> 01:15:48,544
- [Aaron] So what's
the possibility that
that could be wood?

1692
01:15:48,587 --> 01:15:50,807
- Well, based upon the
knowledge that we have

1693
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:53,549
of what was here,
an ancient ship,

1694
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:57,901
and knowing that trees
don't grow at 17,000 feet,

1695
01:15:57,944 --> 01:15:59,729
nor even at above 11,000,

1696
01:15:59,772 --> 01:16:02,732
the tree line's
usually 11,000 feet,

1697
01:16:02,775 --> 01:16:06,562
would dictate, and say
to me, that was a boat.

1698
01:16:06,605 --> 01:16:08,868
But, it doesn't say
boat on the GPS,

1699
01:16:08,912 --> 01:16:12,132
it says reflection of a pattern
of interesting material.

1700
01:16:12,176 --> 01:16:13,133
That's why we're
gonna go drill it.

1701
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:14,613
- And I see those layers.

1702
01:16:14,657 --> 01:16:15,571
- Yeah.

1703
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:18,530
- [Bryant] Ice lays down flat.

1704
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,053
And, as it lays down flat,

1705
01:16:20,097 --> 01:16:22,534
it will take the
contour of the ground.

1706
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,668
But, anything that's oblique,
or got an angle to it,

1707
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:28,496
from my experience,
can't be ice.

1708
01:16:40,987 --> 01:16:43,903
- So, Bruce was
examining this piece

1709
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:46,123
that came out of
the boring, RB-7.

1710
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:48,647
And, what he has found,

1711
01:16:48,691 --> 01:16:52,564
he was using his
fire sample test,

1712
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,000
the ASTM test,

1713
01:16:54,044 --> 01:16:55,959
and, go ahead and tell
them what you found, Bruce.

1714
01:16:56,002 --> 01:16:57,700
- Well, I was heating
everything up,

1715
01:16:57,743 --> 01:17:00,528
and I noticed that this
thing was starting to melt,

1716
01:17:00,572 --> 01:17:03,140
which indicates a
bituminous material,

1717
01:17:03,183 --> 01:17:05,795
or an asphalt or
petroleum based material.

1718
01:17:05,838 --> 01:17:09,450
So, with discretion, I
said, "Whoa, wait a minute."

1719
01:17:09,494 --> 01:17:11,714
This could be something that
we could get to a real lab,

1720
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:13,629
and get some real data on.

1721
01:17:13,672 --> 01:17:14,891
- [Bryant] What I see, as well,

1722
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:16,762
is there's some fibrous
edges along the side,

1723
01:17:16,806 --> 01:17:21,201
which means that, to me,
it's not a mineral material.

1724
01:17:21,245 --> 01:17:22,899
- [Bruce] Like you're
looking at a piece of

1725
01:17:22,942 --> 01:17:24,727
asphalt felt paper.

1726
01:17:26,293 --> 01:17:29,557
- They did hit something,
at about 50 feet.

1727
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:30,733
- [Bruce] Send it
to a laboratory.

1728
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:31,995
They'll be able
to break it down,

1729
01:17:32,038 --> 01:17:34,127
and tell us what kind
of material it is.

1730
01:17:34,171 --> 01:17:34,780
- Okay.

1731
01:17:34,824 --> 01:17:36,739
Thank you.

1732
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:39,785
- [Bruce] It'll be quite
rare for an organic material

1733
01:17:39,829 --> 01:17:42,396
to be this high up
on this mountain.

1734
01:17:50,927 --> 01:17:54,974
[intense music]

1735
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:31,794
[laboratory chatter]

1736
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:56,079
- Strange.

1737
01:18:56,122 --> 01:18:57,820
It almost looks like a crystal.

1738
01:18:57,863 --> 01:18:59,299
- When you're looking
at in a microscope,

1739
01:18:59,343 --> 01:19:02,520
and here's this vitreous,
refractive material

1740
01:19:02,563 --> 01:19:03,782
that's not a rock.

1741
01:19:03,826 --> 01:19:06,785
It looks like a piece
of amber, almost.

1742
01:19:10,441 --> 01:19:12,791
It's not wood fiber,

1743
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:16,664
but it would fit
resin, perfectly.

1744
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:19,755
It's something translucent,

1745
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,540
almost crystalline,

1746
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:25,761
exactly what I
thought pitch was.

1747
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:29,286
If I had imagined
something exciting,

1748
01:19:29,329 --> 01:19:30,591
it would be hard
to do it better.

1749
01:19:30,635 --> 01:19:32,550
It's very encouraging.

1750
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:35,292
We need more, and I'm ready.

1751
01:19:35,335 --> 01:19:36,641
I want the big piece.

1752
01:19:39,862 --> 01:19:40,776
- [Holt] It's very encouraging.

1753
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,168
I'm excited about it,

1754
01:19:42,212 --> 01:19:43,735
but it's not enough.

1755
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:44,954
We need to have more of this.

1756
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:46,694
We need to find more samples.

1757
01:19:46,738 --> 01:19:50,437
We just have to keep pushing
forward, and hope for the best.

1758
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:55,268
- It's all over the mountain.

1759
01:19:55,312 --> 01:19:58,097
I don't believe you're going
to find a gigantic ark,

1760
01:19:58,141 --> 01:19:59,664
you're going to
find chunks of it.

1761
01:19:59,707 --> 01:20:02,232
Some will be in
the Abba Glacier,

1762
01:20:02,275 --> 01:20:04,495
some may be in the Ahora Gorge.

1763
01:20:04,538 --> 01:20:06,976
- I've always been curios
about the Ahora Gorge.

1764
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:10,022
And the stories of, there's
an object in the Ahora Gorge.

1765
01:20:10,066 --> 01:20:11,719
- Portions of the
Ahora Gorge, itself,

1766
01:20:11,763 --> 01:20:13,547
are not accessible.

1767
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:15,898
- [Holt] The Ahora Gorge is
just riddled with crevasses,

1768
01:20:15,941 --> 01:20:18,770
which are areas of the glacier
that have collapsed away.

1769
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:19,945
- The void, basically,

1770
01:20:19,989 --> 01:20:21,773
where the ice is sliding
off the mountain.

1771
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,558
- For a crevasse to form,
you do have to have movement.

1772
01:20:25,385 --> 01:20:28,084
You are exceeding the
strength of the ice,

1773
01:20:28,127 --> 01:20:30,347
and that could be
exceeding that,

1774
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:34,003
either in shear, or in
tension, or in compression.

1775
01:20:34,046 --> 01:20:35,265
When we see crevasses,

1776
01:20:35,308 --> 01:20:37,963
it is evidence that some
motion has occurred.

1777
01:20:40,313 --> 01:20:41,967
And it's occurred in a way

1778
01:20:42,011 --> 01:20:45,318
that imposed stresses that
exceeded the strength.

1779
01:20:46,624 --> 01:20:47,755
- [Voiceover] Always moving.

1780
01:20:47,799 --> 01:20:50,584
With some, hundreds
of feet deep.

1781
01:20:50,628 --> 01:20:52,760
Entering the crevasses offer
some of the team a unique,

1782
01:20:52,804 --> 01:20:56,025
but dangerous perspective
to the bedrock below.

1783
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:08,820
With time running out,

1784
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,518
others prepare for an
equally perilous descent

1785
01:21:11,562 --> 01:21:13,651
into the Ahora Gorge.

1786
01:21:13,694 --> 01:21:15,740
- It's a very dangerous place,

1787
01:21:15,783 --> 01:21:16,828
Ahora Gorge.

1788
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:24,749
- Here we are at
the western plateau.

1789
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:26,707
We're about to go exploring,

1790
01:21:26,751 --> 01:21:29,145
and try to get in the
gorge as far as we can.

1791
01:21:34,411 --> 01:21:36,717
We plan to go down,
as best we can,

1792
01:21:36,761 --> 01:21:38,415
and route-find.

1793
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,201
And then, up and out of
the way of any rock fall,

1794
01:21:42,245 --> 01:21:44,987
or any danger, and still
keep some stable snow.

1795
01:21:45,813 --> 01:21:46,858
Here we go.

1796
01:21:48,773 --> 01:21:49,687
Belay me!

1797
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,655
Getting some crevasses here!

1798
01:22:02,743 --> 01:22:04,789
I think if we go left,
it we'll be better.

1799
01:22:06,878 --> 01:22:11,230
[drilling]

1800
01:22:15,713 --> 01:22:18,063
- We're not going down
any further, are we?

1801
01:22:18,107 --> 01:22:20,587
We went down what we did
yesterday on the anomaly,

1802
01:22:20,631 --> 01:22:22,676
I hit something hard,

1803
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,809
but it wasn't gravel,

1804
01:22:24,852 --> 01:22:26,593
and the bit got stuck.

1805
01:22:26,637 --> 01:22:28,204
- We're hitting something.

1806
01:22:28,247 --> 01:22:29,901
We're hitting resistance.

1807
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:33,383
What we don't know, is
what it is we're hitting.

1808
01:22:33,426 --> 01:22:36,995
The scans and satellite says
there's something there.

1809
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:39,650
And the people from that are
saying there's something there.

1810
01:22:39,693 --> 01:22:42,174
And we say, we're drilling,
we're hitting something hard.

1811
01:22:42,218 --> 01:22:45,482
- Is there wood, is it rock,
what is it that we're hitting

1812
01:22:45,525 --> 01:22:46,396
when we drill?

1813
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:47,397
Because we're hitting something,

1814
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,659
but we don't know what it is.

1815
01:22:48,702 --> 01:22:50,661
- Until we get the
core, we don't know.

1816
01:22:51,618 --> 01:22:53,620
But, we're not giving up yet.

1817
01:22:53,664 --> 01:22:56,145
We'll be able to identify
with the diamond cores

1818
01:22:56,188 --> 01:22:58,016
that we've got
coming from China.

1819
01:23:08,592 --> 01:23:09,985
- What we're trying to do is,

1820
01:23:10,028 --> 01:23:11,508
based on the information,

1821
01:23:11,551 --> 01:23:13,423
drill core, so that
we can retrieve,

1822
01:23:14,511 --> 01:23:15,860
a far more substantial sample

1823
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:18,341
with the drill coring
tool that we have.

1824
01:23:18,384 --> 01:23:21,561
What we have here, is the drill.

1825
01:23:21,605 --> 01:23:23,172
This is it.

1826
01:23:23,215 --> 01:23:24,912
It's a coring bit,

1827
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:28,046
diamond tipped,

1828
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:29,221
goes on the auger,

1829
01:23:29,265 --> 01:23:31,223
hopefully we can
get some samples.

1830
01:23:31,267 --> 01:23:33,486
There's a lip on each side.

1831
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:35,184
And, as it goes down,

1832
01:23:35,227 --> 01:23:38,317
the material is pulled down,
inside here, 'til it stops.

1833
01:23:38,361 --> 01:23:39,449
And, they pull it out,

1834
01:23:39,492 --> 01:23:40,624
and then they take this off,

1835
01:23:40,667 --> 01:23:42,060
and they pop it through
the hollow part.

1836
01:23:42,104 --> 01:23:44,802
And they get a nice,
kinda like this,

1837
01:23:44,845 --> 01:23:48,414
they get a nice core of
whatever we're trying to core.

1838
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:49,459
- Let's go!

1839
01:23:49,502 --> 01:23:50,764
Let's go find an ark.

1840
01:23:50,808 --> 01:23:52,505
- We need him up there.

1841
01:23:56,292 --> 01:23:58,076
- [Voiceover] As the
days get shorter,

1842
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,253
the climbing window on
Ararat begins to close.

1843
01:24:02,341 --> 01:24:04,300
The permit from the
Turkish government

1844
01:24:04,343 --> 01:24:06,737
is for a clearly defined time,

1845
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:09,870
to protect lives
from the unexpected,

1846
01:24:09,914 --> 01:24:12,612
that comes with the
change of seasons.

1847
01:24:14,527 --> 01:24:15,963
Finishing up the uh..

1848
01:24:16,703 --> 01:24:18,749
- Finishing up
our time, up here.

1849
01:24:22,448 --> 01:24:24,059
- Yeah, we're supposed to
have another three days

1850
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:25,582
before this starts up.

1851
01:24:27,323 --> 01:24:29,194
We'll see about that.

1852
01:24:29,238 --> 01:24:32,632
Hopefully the guys who are
trying to head up to help us,

1853
01:24:32,676 --> 01:24:35,026
are doing okay at 4200.

1854
01:24:44,557 --> 01:24:45,950
- It's Wednesday the 28th.

1855
01:24:45,993 --> 01:24:48,822
Getting ready to start
a new day of drilling.

1856
01:24:48,866 --> 01:24:51,651
First thing off, is we're
gonna get the generator going.

1857
01:24:51,695 --> 01:24:53,740
Get our stuff charging.

1858
01:24:53,784 --> 01:24:57,788
We had quite a snow
yesterday evening.

1859
01:24:58,702 --> 01:25:00,791
We've got good weather.

1860
01:25:00,834 --> 01:25:03,359
And, hopefully,
it should go well.

1861
01:25:03,402 --> 01:25:04,969
- We've been sent
up a reinforcement

1862
01:25:05,012 --> 01:25:06,623
with a fancy drill bit,

1863
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:08,146
out of China, or somewhere.

1864
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:09,147
We're hoping to get down.

1865
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:11,584
We've re-dug RB-7,

1866
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:13,673
which is where we
pulled the flake out

1867
01:25:13,717 --> 01:25:15,588
of whatever that was.

1868
01:25:15,632 --> 01:25:17,547
They've asked us to
penetrate through

1869
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:21,159
the fluvial flow or rock,
or whatever it is on top,

1870
01:25:21,203 --> 01:25:22,682
try and get a better sample.

1871
01:25:22,726 --> 01:25:24,467
We will lower down into place,

1872
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:25,555
hook up the motor,

1873
01:25:25,598 --> 01:25:28,079
grind on it a little bit,

1874
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,037
and get something done.

1875
01:25:37,784 --> 01:25:39,134
- We did running belays,

1876
01:25:39,177 --> 01:25:41,005
trying to find a good
vantage point into the gorge.

1877
01:25:41,048 --> 01:25:42,963
Finally we did.

1878
01:25:43,007 --> 01:25:44,530
After five years,

1879
01:25:44,574 --> 01:25:48,621
I'm finally standing on the
western edge of Ahora Gorge,

1880
01:25:48,665 --> 01:25:49,970
here on Mount Ararat.

1881
01:25:52,538 --> 01:25:54,758
Let me give you a shot
of what that looks like.

1882
01:25:58,544 --> 01:26:01,547
As you can see, it's
full of crevasses.

1883
01:26:01,591 --> 01:26:04,724
It's a fast moving glacier.

1884
01:26:04,768 --> 01:26:08,815
This is really crazy crevasse

1885
01:26:10,121 --> 01:26:12,036
in the center of this gorge.

1886
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:13,777
And, if the ark had come to rest

1887
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:16,040
anywhere near the lip
of the Ahora Gorge,

1888
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:17,781
It would be chewed up

1889
01:26:25,745 --> 01:26:29,662
You stare right into
those huge crevasses,

1890
01:26:29,706 --> 01:26:32,622
and you say, "There's
just no way".

1891
01:26:32,665 --> 01:26:34,363
If it is anywhere in the gorge,

1892
01:26:34,406 --> 01:26:35,799
it's got to be lower down.

1893
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:41,587
- My primary goal,
at the summit,

1894
01:26:41,631 --> 01:26:43,372
was to get two drill cores.

1895
01:26:43,415 --> 01:26:47,506
And, we were able to get two
cores within three hours.

1896
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,116
But, they were
covered in, of course,

1897
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,727
all the mud from the coring.

1898
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:52,207
I just said to the boys,

1899
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,470
"Let's not tamper
with the samples.

1900

"Let's let the scientists
look at the samples.

"What it is, it is.

1902
01:26:58,256 --> 01:26:59,562
"We'll find out
when we get down."

1903
01:26:59,605 --> 01:27:01,738
- The got the core,
he came back down.

1904
01:27:01,781 --> 01:27:03,043
That was his purpose,

1905
01:27:03,087 --> 01:27:06,656
and he did exactly what
he was supposed to do.

1906
01:27:06,699 --> 01:27:07,613
- I had one task.

1907
01:27:07,657 --> 01:27:09,833
I believe that I
accomplished it,

1908
01:27:09,876 --> 01:27:12,139
and I'm happy for that.

1909
01:27:12,183 --> 01:27:13,576
- This is the core.

1910
01:27:14,881 --> 01:27:17,493
This is obviously basalt.

1911
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:18,581
What were we hitting?

1912
01:27:18,624 --> 01:27:19,930
We were hitting basalt.

1913
01:27:19,973 --> 01:27:21,148
Now we know.

1914
01:27:21,192 --> 01:27:23,325
What we were looking
for is not there.

1915
01:27:32,638 --> 01:27:34,684
- [Voiceover] Thomas
Edison once said,

1916
01:27:35,685 --> 01:27:37,556
"I have not failed,

1917
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:41,386
"I have just found 10,000
ways that won't work."

1918
01:27:42,605 --> 01:27:44,520
Failure is a teacher.

1919
01:27:45,564 --> 01:27:47,523
Just a stepping stone

1920
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,177
on the road to success.

1921
01:27:52,963 --> 01:27:54,051
- Okay.

1922
01:27:56,619 --> 01:27:57,968
Dr. Bryant and I

1923
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:02,146
has agreed that

1924
01:28:03,234 --> 01:28:04,714
it's done.

1925
01:28:04,757 --> 01:28:06,542
We have to call it finished.

1926
01:28:09,109 --> 01:28:12,156
Doesn't mean it's the final
chapter in search for the ark.

1927
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:14,419
- Just because we
don't find something,

1928
01:28:14,463 --> 01:28:15,986
doesn't mean it's not here.

1929
01:28:16,029 --> 01:28:18,423
It means it's more
difficult to find.

1930
01:28:18,467 --> 01:28:20,904
Today is not the
chapter closing day,

1931
01:28:20,947 --> 01:28:23,646
it's just another day that
we can add more information

1932
01:28:23,689 --> 01:28:25,256
to the components that we have,

1933
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,779
and build upon that.

1934
01:28:30,043 --> 01:28:33,220
- We drilled, we got cores,

1935
01:28:33,264 --> 01:28:35,658
and the evidence
was very negative.

1936
01:28:35,701 --> 01:28:37,094
We don't understand why.

1937
01:28:40,793 --> 01:28:42,491
- [Kevin] We've exhausted
all of our options

1938
01:28:42,534 --> 01:28:43,709
at this particular time,

1939
01:28:43,753 --> 01:28:45,755
with the technology
that we have available,

1940
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:48,801
and the time that
we have available.

1941
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:52,370
- We're off.

1942
01:28:54,764 --> 01:28:55,895
- Yes, disappointment,

1943
01:28:55,939 --> 01:28:57,636
but that's not the
important thing.

1944
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,509
The important thing is finding
out what the facts are.

1945
01:29:00,552 --> 01:29:01,727
And if we've accomplished that,

1946
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:03,076
then that's good.

1947
01:29:04,556 --> 01:29:06,732
- [Voiceover] Few
things are as universal

1948
01:29:06,776 --> 01:29:09,605
as man's need for exploration.

1949
01:29:12,956 --> 01:29:16,089
Something ingrained in our DNA

1950
01:29:16,133 --> 01:29:18,265
calls us to search.

1951
01:29:18,309 --> 01:29:19,484
To find.

1952
01:29:25,751 --> 01:29:28,841
To discover things
unknown about our past,

1953
01:29:29,712 --> 01:29:32,976
which then become our
guide for the future.

[Talking in foreign language]

1955
01:29:40,026 --> 01:29:41,027
It's a long walk.

1956
01:29:41,854 --> 01:29:42,551
It is a long walk.

1957
01:29:42,594 --> 01:29:44,161
For thousands of years,

1958
01:29:44,204 --> 01:29:47,033
man has embarked on
this incredible journey

1959
01:29:47,077 --> 01:29:48,513
of discovery.

1960
01:29:50,472 --> 01:29:51,603
And in doing so,

1961
01:29:51,647 --> 01:29:54,301
ultimately finds himself.

1962
01:29:59,263 --> 01:30:00,786
- [Aaron] We may
find it one day.

1963
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:02,179
We may find it next year.

1964
01:30:02,222 --> 01:30:03,963
But, us being together,

1965
01:30:04,007 --> 01:30:06,531
and our journey up
there, and back,

1966
01:30:06,575 --> 01:30:09,621
and how that changed our
lives is really the story.

1967
01:30:11,536 --> 01:30:13,756
- [Kevin] So, for me, it's
really been a journey of

1968
01:30:13,799 --> 01:30:17,020
trying to discover what's in
my heart, what motivates me.

1969
01:30:17,063 --> 01:30:20,327
I feel very happy without
even discovering the ark.

1970
01:30:22,155 --> 01:30:23,548
- When you're coming
down the mountain,

1971
01:30:23,592 --> 01:30:25,594
a lot of things are
rolling through your mind.

1972
01:30:27,596 --> 01:30:29,119
Were we successful?

1973
01:30:29,162 --> 01:30:30,599
Did we come up with anything

1974
01:30:30,642 --> 01:30:32,514
to take us further
down the road?

1975
01:30:32,557 --> 01:30:35,517
In my mind, scientifically,

1976
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,736
did we just waste
a lot of money?

1977
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:40,478
Did we waste a lot of time,
and risk people's lives?

1978
01:30:41,392 --> 01:30:43,525
But, there were times
I just felt like,

1979
01:30:43,568 --> 01:30:46,179
"Wow, I'm as closest to
heaven I can be on Earth.

1980
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:49,879
I do feel like

1981
01:30:49,922 --> 01:30:51,794
I had a mountain top
experience with the Lord.

1982
01:30:53,012 --> 01:30:54,666
- When you come back down,
and you didn't find it,

1983
01:30:54,710 --> 01:30:57,234
it's kinda like going to
the Superbowl and losing.

1984
01:30:57,277 --> 01:30:59,932
You're still a player,
you still gave it all,

1985
01:30:59,976 --> 01:31:01,586
you left it all on the field,

1986
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:04,676
but you just didn't win.

1987
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,678
- [Holt] The expedition
was not a disappointment.

1988
01:31:10,813 --> 01:31:14,077
We scientifically ruled
out the eastern plateau.

1989
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,209
And we got our team down safely.

1990
01:31:19,082 --> 01:31:20,475
- [Bruce] We did it together.

1991
01:31:22,302 --> 01:31:23,652
I could not have made it

1992
01:31:23,695 --> 01:31:26,219
without the guys
that I climbed with.

1993
01:31:27,394 --> 01:31:29,092
- The men I've been
on this expedition,

1994
01:31:29,135 --> 01:31:30,702
you can get deep with them,

1995
01:31:30,746 --> 01:31:32,008
and that's what you
look for in life.

1996
01:31:34,924 --> 01:31:36,752
- Very glad to be
back down here,

1997
01:31:36,795 --> 01:31:39,755
I need to get my strength back.

1998
01:31:42,409 --> 01:31:43,585
- Eat!

1999
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:47,545
- The ark, to me,
represents a dream.

2000
01:31:47,589 --> 01:31:49,242
If you want it,

2001
01:31:49,286 --> 01:31:51,593
and you feel called to it,

2002
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:52,768
go do it.

2003
01:31:52,811 --> 01:31:55,031
- The most emotional
experience for me

2004
01:31:56,075 --> 01:31:57,686
was the summoning.

2005
01:31:59,731 --> 01:32:02,038
I was overwhelmed with it.

2006
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:04,649
I'm gonna get
emotional right now,

2007
01:32:04,693 --> 01:32:08,740
because it was a
goal I set out to do.

2008
01:32:09,785 --> 01:32:12,744
And God blessed me
to be able to do it.

2009
01:32:13,919 --> 01:32:16,835
And I knew, even if we
didn't find the ark,

2010
01:32:16,879 --> 01:32:19,142
just climbing a mountain
of that magnitude

2011
01:32:20,665 --> 01:32:21,971
is something I'm gonna remember,

2012
01:32:22,014 --> 01:32:23,929
and my family's gonna remember

2013
01:32:23,973 --> 01:32:25,409
for the rest of our lives.

2014
01:32:25,452 --> 01:32:27,237
- I may not have
found Noah's Ark,

2015
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:31,154
but, I found, I think,
something much more important,

2016
01:32:31,197 --> 01:32:33,809
and much more
lasting, and that is,

2017
01:32:33,852 --> 01:32:35,071
I believe that,

2018
01:32:35,114 --> 01:32:37,073
in the process of trying
to discover the ark,

2019
01:32:37,116 --> 01:32:38,553
I've discovered
more about myself,

2020
01:32:38,596 --> 01:32:40,424
and I discovered more about God.

2021
01:32:40,467 --> 01:32:41,991
- There will be a time

2022
01:32:42,034 --> 01:32:44,080
that structure will be revealed.

2023
01:32:45,211 --> 01:32:47,126
It's there.

2024
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:50,260
It's been there for a purpose,
and for a certain time.

2025
01:32:50,303 --> 01:32:51,609
It will be revealed.

2026
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:55,178
- [Voiceover] Why would
God want you to find the ark?

2027
01:32:55,221 --> 01:32:57,180
- [Will] I don't know that
he wants us to find the ark,

2028
01:32:57,223 --> 01:33:00,444
but I am fairly convinced
that he wants us to look.

2029
01:33:00,487 --> 01:33:01,967
And in that sense, yeah,

2030
01:33:02,011 --> 01:33:05,014
it's very much more about
the journey, than discovery.

2031
01:33:05,057 --> 01:33:07,103
- [Holt] With the Kurdish men,

2032
01:33:07,146 --> 01:33:09,279
it's some of the closest
friendships I've got.

2033
01:33:09,322 --> 01:33:10,497
I mean, when you go through

2034
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:12,195
what we've gone
through together,

2035
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:15,590
it does something to
you to make you close.

2036
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:22,814
- [Voiceover] As the shepherds
return with their flocks,

2037
01:33:25,469 --> 01:33:27,993
and families prepare
for the winter ahead,

2038
01:33:30,387 --> 01:33:32,258
the beliefs they hold

2039
01:33:32,302 --> 01:33:34,434
remain unchallenged.

2040
01:33:36,567 --> 01:33:37,916
- I'll never regret
being able to say,

2041
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,439
"I've been there,
I've done that.

2042
01:33:39,483 --> 01:33:41,180
"I stood up there
on the mountain.

2043
01:33:41,224 --> 01:33:42,704
"I've looked for Noah's Ark."

2044
01:33:42,747 --> 01:33:44,314
- The hunger's still there.

2045
01:33:44,357 --> 01:33:46,664
It's still something that
needs to be searched for.

2046
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:47,534
- Will we find it?

2047
01:33:47,578 --> 01:33:48,274
I don't know.

2048
01:33:48,318 --> 01:33:49,536
Will it be found?

2049
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:51,190
I don't know that it's
there to be found.

2050
01:33:51,234 --> 01:33:52,061
Does it exist?

2051
01:33:52,104 --> 01:33:53,671
Yes, I believe that.

2052
01:33:53,715 --> 01:33:56,195
Does that change whether or not
we should be looking for it?

2053
01:33:58,328 --> 01:34:00,460

♪ Yeah-et-et, whoah

2073
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:08,267
♪ Yeah-et-et, whoah

2074
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:11,575
♪ Yeah-et-et, whoah

2075
01:35:12,097 --> 01:35:13,272
- I don't think it matters

2076
01:35:13,316 --> 01:35:14,883
whether or not you
could ever find the ark.

2077
01:35:14,926 --> 01:35:15,840
I think the value today is,

2078
01:35:15,884 --> 01:35:17,842
what could it teach us about

2079
01:35:17,886 --> 01:35:21,237
our responsibility
to safeguard creation

2080
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,805
the way Noah in the story
safeguarded creation.

2081
01:35:23,848 --> 01:35:25,545
Brought all the animals
through the flood.

2082
01:35:25,589 --> 01:35:28,026
You look at what's happening
to the earth today,

2083
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:30,376
in terms of the
massive extinction
event that's going on,

2084
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:31,943
on our watch,

2085
01:35:31,987 --> 01:35:35,077
and we're not doing the job
that Noah was tasked with doing.

2086
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:37,775
So, to me, the resonance and
value of the story today,

2087
01:35:37,819 --> 01:35:40,125
is that it's a powerful message

2088
01:35:40,169 --> 01:35:43,738
about what our responsibilities
are to safeguard creation.

2089
01:35:44,434 --> 01:35:47,089
♪ Life is a race we run

2090
01:35:47,132 --> 01:35:49,744
