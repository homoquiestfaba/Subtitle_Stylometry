00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,886
You don't know that.
No, I do.

357
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,166
You don't know that.

358
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,005
I do very much know that, in the
sense that I don't intend to apply.

359
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,201
What?

360
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,767
I don't think that it's the
place for me right now, Dad.

361
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,400
Okay. All right, fine. You want
to spread your wings a little...

362
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,688
get out of the city,
go to school somewhere else.

363
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,161
I totally support that. All
you had to do was tell me.

364
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,241
Where do you want to go?

365
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,244
What's the list?
It's a short list.

366
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,447
Great. I like it. Focus.

367
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,570
L'mma hit you with a super
short list, man, becauseifs“.

368
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,085
There's nothing on it.

(SIGHS)

370
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,607
There's...

371
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,848
I'm confused, because
there's not a list--

372
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,921
Dad?

373
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,521
Mmm-hmm?

374
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,040
I want to take a year off.

375
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,964
I would like to do
exactly what you just said.

376
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,690
I want to spread my wings.

377
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,080
You want to spread your
wings, that's great.

378
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,651
But you can't spread your
wings and fly to nowhere.

379
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,450
Plans change.
No, they don't.

380
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,205
No, they don't.
Plans don't change.

381
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,561
We had a plan,
itchanged.

382
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,051
It's disorienting at first.
No.

383
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,326
You can't change the plan...

384
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,369
unless you check with the people
who are financing the plan...

385
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,443
which is,
last time I checked,

386
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,965
your mother and I. Okay?

387
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,245
Dad, we could sit here and just have
this conversation about plans...

388
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,811
but for now,
let's call it a night.

389
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,405
Let's not even
clean up, right?

390
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,641
Let's come back tomorrow.

391
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,086
Let's reboot
the whole energy,

392
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,525
the whole tone
of this puppy...

393
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,641
and we'll kill it, man.

394
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,290
Team Daley!
Not tonight, tomorrow.

395
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,441
Hey, Team Daley?

396
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,567
Yeah?
Stop talking.

397
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,641
Okay-

398
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,086
You're gonna clean up.
I'm gonna go to bed.

399
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,720
And then we're gonna finish
this conversation tomorrow.

400
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,521
(MUSIC PLAYING)

401
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,091
Yeah! Get some!

402
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,161
Get some!

403
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,163
That's it. Yeah.

404
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,006
Hi.

405
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,368
I'm Larry Daley. I'm head
of the Night Program.

406
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,251
I know who you are.
You're the security guard.

407
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,124
Yeah, also head of
the Night Program.

408
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,840
I'm doing some research...

409
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,280
and I was wondering
if you could help me out.

410
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,443
Mmm. Night guard
doing research.

411
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,010
Ooh la-la!

412
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,401
Yeah.

413
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,011
Uh, I'm just
looking for anything

414
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,889
that you might have on
the tablet ofAhkmenrah.

415
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,007
Center aisle.

416
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,322
Great. Halfway down,
stacks on your left.

417
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,005
(GROANS)

418
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,287
Get it!

419
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,970
So...

420
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,527
what makes you so curious
about the tablet?

421
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,371
Oh! Just, uh...

422
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,291
Just a hobby, you know?
Kind of an interest of mine.

423
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,771
I wish I could
talk to these guys.

424
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,485
Well, you can't.

425
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,561
Yeah.

426
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,005
Because they're dead.

427
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,081
Right.

428
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,409
But, uh, look at that one.

429
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,925
Looks like a kid, huh?

430
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,881

431

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

432
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,405
You didn't know him,
did you?

433
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,002
C.J Fredericks.

434
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,571
He worked here.

435
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,649
He worked here?
Yeah, when he grew up.

436
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,881
No.
Yeah.

437
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,849
He was a night guard.

438
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,331
Same as you.

439
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,328
Wait a minute. C.J.

440
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,929

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,645

442
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,485
Sexiest night guard
we ever had.

443
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,483
Present company included.

444
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,722
Boy, could that man move.

00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,681
Hey, Cecil.

448
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,685
My God, it's been years!

449
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,285
You look like
you're doing pretty good.

450
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,363
I've still got it, pal.

451
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,601
What are you doing here?

452
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,360
I need to talk to you
about the tablet.

453
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,329
What the heck is
Short Stack doing here?

454
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,404
Hey, Gus.
You're looking well.

455
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,607
Reginald.

456
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,122
Are you here to
frame us again?

457
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,850
Send us back
to the slammer?

458
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,968
I didn't frame you.
You were actually stealing.

459
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,929
And I was the one that got
you out of jail, so...

460
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,082
Yeah.
We've got a nice life here.

461
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,322
The past is the past.
We've moved on.

462
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,641
I don't think
this guy's moved on.

463
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,484
Listen to him,
monkey face.

464
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,041
REGINALD: We've put all that
tablet stuff behind us, Larry.

465
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,281
It's old news.

466
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,245
Besides, we really never knew
anything about that old tablet.

467
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,726
We just worked there.

468
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,450
Something's up with it.

469
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,009
I told you,
I can't help you.

470
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,531
Maybe this kid can.

471
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,841
Maybe we'd better talk alone.

472
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,647
CECIL: Expedition like that
is a pretty amazing thing...

473
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,285
for a 12-year-old boy.

474
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,363
I tried to move on...

475
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,251
but there was something
about that tablet.

476
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,007
It's turning green,
like some sort of corrosion.

477
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,407
And something's happening
to Teddy and Dexter...

478
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,647
Jed and Octavius.

479
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,404
They're all acting weird.

480
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,961
It's like the green rust
is affecting them.

481
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,809
"The end will come."

482
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,041
What?

483
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,485
The locals, they warned us.

484
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,291
They begged us to
leave that tomb alone.

485
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,523
I thought it meant
the end of the world.

486
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,131
But maybe it meant
the end...

487
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,765
End of the magic?

488
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,961
We should have listened.

489
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,325
Should have listened.

490
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,563
Instead, we shipped Ahk and
the tablet off to New York...

491
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,569
and his folks
to England.

492
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,000
Wait. Wait.

493
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,924
Ahkmenrah's parents
are in England?

494
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,923
It was a joint expedition.

495
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,321
Some of the artifacts
stayed in Egypt.

496
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,286
The rest was divided up between
New York and the British Museum.

497
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,326
Ahk said that his father knew
the secrets of the tablet.

498
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,250
I think I have
to go talk to him.

499
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,050
I need you to listen to me.
Uh...

500
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,323
Our esteemed chairwoman
asked for my resignation.

501
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,768
She said, since the Night
Program was my brainchild...

502
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,491
that the buck starts
and stops with me.

503
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,608
I can fix it.
How?

504
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,004
I need you to let me take the
tablet and Ahkmenrah to London.

505
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,167
Sorry.
I'm just processing that.

go with me on this.

Are you gonna mug me?
What?

Just be prepared.

523
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,163

Of course it is!

is what happens. What?

Okay. It's all right.

1763
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,689
Go ahead. One last slap.

1764
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:28,723
Yeah, I felt that was there
for a long time, too.

1765
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,001
(MOUTHING) Thank you.

1766
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,524
Who would have ever thought?

1767
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,604
I'm wax, she's polyurethane.

1768
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,922
But somehow, it worked.
(CHUCKLES)

1769
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,047
(SIGHS)

1770
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,530
I guess this is it.

1771
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:14,761
Indeed.

1772
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:18,203
And I know young Nick
will do great things.

1773
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,085
Yeah, he's, uh...

1774
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,125
ready to take on the world
all by himself.

1775
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,203
Then you've done your job.

1776
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,963
You've done your job.

1777
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,488
It's time for
your next adventure.

1778
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,283
I have no idea what
I'm gonna do tomorrow.

1779
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,882
How exciting.

1780
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,925
Bye, Teddy.

1781
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,249
Farewell, Lawrence.

1782
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,480
Bully!
(SCREAMS)

1783
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,409
(LAUGHING)
Got you!

1784
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,763
Smile, my boy.

1785
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,089
It's sunrise.

1786
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,328
Hey.
Hey. You good?

1787
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,847
Yeah, I am.
Good.

1788
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,761
So, Ibiza?

1789
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,841
Yeah. Uh...

1790
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,210
The whole DJ thing, Dad...

1791
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,442
I don't know if that's
the thing for me...

1792
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,648
I just know that
it's the next thing.

1793
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,564
After that,
maybe college.

1794
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:55,281
I'm figuring it
all out, you know?

1795
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,961
Sounds like a plan.

1796
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,484
I should get back to Mom's,
or something.

1797
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,971
Okay-

1798
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,521
I love you.

1799
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,810
I love you, too.

1800
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,481
All right.

1801
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,491
I'm not gonna let you go.

1802
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,802
(CHUCKLES) Okay.
I'll see you later.

1803
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,520
<i>DR. MCPHEE: Three years,
no Larry Daley.</i>

1804
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:05,207
<i>He was the one that took the
fall for me, got me my job back.</i>

1805
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,124
I heard he went
back to school,

1806
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,202
got his degree,
became a teacher.

1807
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,441
I'm very glad.

1808
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,444
Well, when he heard about
this traveling exhibition...

1809
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,723
Larry insisted that I deliver
this to you personally.

1810
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:22,965
Ah! The infamous, supposedly
magic, glowing tablet.

1811
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,407
Larry Daley and
his fanciful tales.

1812
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,324
Larry said
you could be trusted.

1813
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,405
What do you mean?

1814
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,565
(WHISPERING) With the top
secret knowledge.

1815
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,721
What are you doing?

1816
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,924
I'm winking.
You're blinking.

1817
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,043
No, I wink with both eyes.

1818
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,201
That's blinking.

1819
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,328
It doesn't matter,
because right now...

1820
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,925
you better get ready!

1821
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,286
For what?

1822
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,401
For this.

1823
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,161
It does glow.

1824
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,601
Uh-huh.

1825
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,841
(CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

1826
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,604
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1827
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,327
Come on.

1828
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:14,321
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

1829
01:29:58,240 --> 01:29:59,401
Sorry.

1830
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,085
Go ahead.

1831
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,685
Have fun-fun, Dum Dum.

1832
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,765
(CHATTERING)

1833
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,205
Ah!

1834
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,041
Stay!

1835
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,690
I'm not going anywhere.

1836
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,286
Stay!

1837
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,885
I'm not going anywhere!

1838
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,885
(SCRATCHING)
