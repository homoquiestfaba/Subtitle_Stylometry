- Just gonna sit here?
- Oh no, I have evidence scans

183
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:34,500
- to go through.
- All right, have fun with those.

184
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:38,237
I will, and tell Ramirez
I haven't forgotten he owes me.

185
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,106
I'll tell Ferris you say hi.

186
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,341
Don't.

187
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,910
(telephone ringing)

188
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:49,181
- Hey.
- Hey.

189
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:50,816
You learn anything useful?
You've been down there

190
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:53,385
- long enough.
- All right, well, not really.

191
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,488
You don't know
what killed this guy?

192
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:58,457
No, they don't know.

193
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,393
Also, they haven't figured out
who he is from any databases.

194
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:03,329
Yeah, well that's what
they pay us the big bucks for,

195
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:05,231
- right?
- I mean, what'd you suss out

196
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,132
from the evidence report?

197
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:10,135
Well, besides that notebook,

198
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:12,371
our John Doe had on him
the following:

199
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,373
a camping pass
for the Angeles Mountains

200
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,175
and a business card.

201
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,544
I mean, no wallet, no phone,
but on the backside of the card

202
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,446
there's a set of coordinates.

203
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:21,947
Well, where are the coordinates?

204
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:23,315
Up in the mountains
in the forest

205
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:25,251
about two hours out.

206
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:27,286
And who's the card from?

207
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:28,988
Jensen Networking Solutions.

208
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:31,123
I looked him up, he's in town.

209
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:33,225
Well, Jensen sounds good
for tomorrow, yeah.

210
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:37,029
- I'll pick you up?
- All right, sounds good.

211
00:10:37,062 --> 00:10:38,831
(beeping)

212
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:41,200
(exhales heavily)

213
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:48,207
(engine whirring)

214
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:56,448
Uh, how much further
till we get there, Sam?

215
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:58,851
Couple minutes.

216
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:01,587
Do I just stay straight?

217
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,057
Yeah, stay straight, Keller.

218
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,192
Just making sure
we're on the same page.

219
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:11,196
What are you talking about?

220
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,898
Ready to work?

221
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,570
You wanna smell my breath, Mom?

222
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:20,539
Okay, I'll back off.

223
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:22,441
Yeah, whatever.

224
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,510
Take a left on the next block.

225
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,145
Aye, aye, captain.

226
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:29,181
(knocking)

227
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:31,383
- Hi, are you Michael Jensen?
- Yes.

228
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:33,352
I'm Detective Sam Morris,
and me and my partner would like

229
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:35,354
to ask you a couple questions
if that's all right.

230
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:37,523
Sure, come in, detectives.

231
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:47,866
Have a seat.

232
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:53,105
What can I do for you,
detectives?

233
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:55,207
We're working on a John Doe.

234
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,542
This man died two days ago.

235
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:58,110
We're trying to get
a positive ID.

236
00:11:58,143 --> 00:11:59,912
Do you mind
looking at a picture?

237
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:02,014
Okay.

238
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:06,385
No, sorry, I don't know him.

239
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:09,656
Can you think of a reason
he would have your card?

240
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:11,623
Well...

241
00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:14,026
I work freelance.

242
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:16,095
I have a decent amount
of clients.

243
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:18,497
Perhaps one of them
recommended me to him?

244
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:24,169
I'd give you my client list
if you like.

245
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,271
How long you been taking photos?

246
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:30,142
Oh, well, many, many years.

247
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:34,246
I used to shoot on film,
so that shows my age.

248
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,148
So, what kind
of freelance work do you do?

249
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:39,184
Network infrastructure
and storage solutions.

250
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:42,020
So, that's like, um,
servers and stuff?

251
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:44,256
Yep, you got it.

252
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:46,693
If you remember anything else,
could you give us a call,

253
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:49,294
- Mr. Jensen?
- Of course.

254
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:54,400
Have a good night, sir.

255
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:57,369
I'm gonna check out Jensen's
social pages later.

256
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:59,505
Hey, you think we can
get up in the mountains tonight?

257
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:02,107
What, now?

258
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:04,977
- I... it's dark.
- So?

259
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,714
Well, so... I mean, Jules wouldn't
be too thrilled about that.

260
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:09,415
I told her today
would be a quick one.

261
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:11,083
Mm, I don't think your wife
should be interfering

262
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:12,418
in police business.

263
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:15,421
Well, you could
tell her that yourself.

264
00:13:15,454 --> 00:13:17,289
Would you like to
come to dinner tonight?

265
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:18,725
She would love to see you.

266
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:20,660
No, I'm good, thanks.

267
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:23,028
- You sure?
- Yes.

268
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:24,697
All right, Sam, tell me when.

269
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:26,432
All right.

270
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:29,001
(glugging)

271
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,173
- That's good, thanks.
- All right.

272
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:36,676
Jules, do you want some red
or do you want your white?

273
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,412
Oh, I'll just take a glass
of, uh, whatever Sam brought.

274
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:42,548
- Thanks for having me, Jules.
- Oh, sweetie, of course.

275
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:44,416
You're like family.

276
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:50,255
So, what should we cheers to?

277
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:55,994
- The future?
- oh, so dramatic.

278
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:59,598
How about we, uh, cheers to
the bottom of the bottle?

279
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:01,600
- Yeah.
- That works.

280
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,039
- The future, Keller?
- Hey.

281
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:10,275
I'm with my two favorite women,
and by the way, Sam,

282
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,678
Jules and I are
gonna start a family soon,

283
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,413
so yeah, the future's
looking pretty bright.

284
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:17,082
You are so corny, babe.

285
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:19,251
Well, I'm happy
to have what I have.

286
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:22,187
All right, we get it,
your life is super and great.

287
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:23,756
(chuckling)

288
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,592
So, Sam, I heard you might be
looking for a new place.

289
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,361
Did you find one yet?

290
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:31,129
Um, no.

291
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,766
I mean, I like where I am.

292
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,467
Well, are you sure?
Because I actually found

293
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,236
some spots in this area.

294
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,338
- Jules.
- John.

295
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,576
I like my dark and gloomy cave
just fine.

296
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:48,748
Okay, just saying.

297
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:50,516
And I'm just saying,
maybe you should

298
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:54,253
stop spending so much time
on those real estate sites.

299
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:55,822
What? I don't.

300
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:58,725
- How much time we talking?
- Like an hour in the morning

301
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:01,761
and an hour before bed.

302
00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:04,596
- That's not a lot, right?
- No, um,

303
00:15:04,631 --> 00:15:07,466
that's perfectly healthy.

304
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:09,769
(snickering)

305
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:12,337
(water streaming)

306
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:18,544
Listen, Sam.

307
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:20,078
I know that John
is your partner,

308
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:22,481
but you can talk to me, too.

309
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:24,316
What, you mean like girl talk?

310
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:25,551
I mean, you don't have
to give me a list

311
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:28,287
of everyone you ever slept with,
but yeah.

312
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,290
I appreciate that, but, uh,

313
00:15:31,323 --> 00:15:34,159
yeah, I mean, I'm good, I, um...

314
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:35,862
Time heals and all that shit,
you know?

315
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:38,765
Yeah, but the "all that shit"
is the part I'm offering.

316
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:40,432
So, just goddamn call me.

317
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:42,669
Yeah?

318
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:44,704
Yes, ma'am.

319
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:47,439
(birds chirping)

320
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:49,341
You have one new voicemail

321
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:52,712
from June 27th.

322
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:55,648
Hey, sis,
it's coming up on a year,

323
00:15:55,682 --> 00:16:00,218
and, well, Mom wanted us both
to come back home.

324
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:02,120
It could be
just for the weekend,

325
00:16:02,154 --> 00:16:03,856
or whatever you can do.

326
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,792
Love you, Sam, bye.

327
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:07,159
(beep)

328
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:21,239
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.

329
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,875
Ah.

330
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:24,777
Got a camera?

331
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:27,412
- Right here.
- Ah, thank you.

332
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,314
So, what's the camera for?

333
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:31,149
For documentation.

334
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:32,852
Unless you think you can
remember every little detail

335
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:35,688
we see up there, which, uh,
judging from the past,

336
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:37,155
I'm thinking that's a hard no.

337
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:38,523
(chuckling)

338
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:40,359
The camera will show
that I'm usually right.

339
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:43,295
Ah, the camera will
show what it shows.

340
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:44,664
You wanna drive and do your job?

341
00:16:44,697 --> 00:16:45,898
All right, got it.

342
00:16:45,932 --> 00:16:55,875

Oh, God, I'm getting old.

Hey, you're not
that much older than me,

353
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:29,709
so just...

354
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:32,577
That's my excuse,
I mean, what's yours?

355
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:34,681
I mean... was I the one
huffing and puffing,

356
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:37,249
and dragging my toes?

to see a good asset,
