1
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,852
<i>I've been born-again
my whole life.</i>

2
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,773
<i>Accepting Jesus into your heart
and getting saved is a big decision...</i>

3
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,484
<i>... especially for a three-year-old.</i>

4
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:56,200
<i>My faith taught me that everything
was a part of God's plan.</i>

5
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,746
<i>Mom said that he even had a reason
for taking my father to heaven.</i>

6
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:05,209
<i>She explained
that Daddy was with the angels.</i>

7
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,754
<i>Well, I wanted
to be with the angels, too.</i>

8
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,717
<i>But God had other plans.</i>

9
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,971
<i>Jesus became
the center of my life.</i>

10
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,182
I still don't think
he's supposed to be white.

11
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,727
- I was watching this thing on television--
- Of course, he's white.

12
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,563
Gosh. Sometimes I think
my brother's retarded, too.

13
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,316
No, your brother's not retarded.

14
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,529
<i>I was a member in good standing
of the Christian Jewels.</i>

15
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,906
<i>It's sort of like
a girl gang for Jesus.</i>

16
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,950
Don't kill your baby!

17
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,372
Lillian Cummings.

18
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,415
<i>My mom was finally named
the number one</i>

19
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:49,086
<i>Christian interior decorator
for the entire region.</i>

20
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,507
<i>And in spite of living
in what the Bible calls "the end times,"</i>

21
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,884
<i>my future was looking bright.</i>

22
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,554
<i>I had the perfect Christian boyfriend.</i>

23
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:04,226
<i>And I was about to be a senior
at a really good Christian school.</i>

24
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,793
<i>Two weeks before
summer vacation ended,</i>

25
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,503
<i>everything changed.</i>

26
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,175
<i>My boyfriend and I
played this game</i>

27
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,760
<i>of telling each other
secrets underwater.</i>

28
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,181
<i>It's lame, I know.</i>

29
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,808
<i>But this wasn 't exactly
the MTV Beach House.</i>

30
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:48,061
Okay, now my turn.

31
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,230
Okay, ready?

32
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,260
Mary!

33
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,847
<i>Maybe it was
because I was drowning,</i>

34
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,558
<i>or the shock
of Dean's confession...</i>

35
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,646
<i>... but at that moment,
I had a vision.</i>

36
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,071
Dean needs you now.

37
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,698
You must do all you can
to help him.

38
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,999
It's just a little bump, Mom.
I'm totally fine.

39
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,918
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

40
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,380
<i>Mom was away at the Christian
Community Leader's Convention</i>

41
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,592
<i>in Orlando with Pastor Skip--
the principal of my school.</i>

42
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,595
<i>- Honey?
- Mom.</i>

43
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,348
You didn't tell me
Pastor Skip was so nice.

44
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,475
<i>Yeah, everybody loves him.</i>

45
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:12,062
We've been talking about setting up
our own fellowship programs

46
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,064
<i>when I get back to Cherry Hill.</i>

47
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,442
<i>- I have to go.
- Come and get it.</i>

48
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,986
<i>Come and get it.</i>

49
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,446
Love you.

50
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,115
<i>- I love you, too.
- Bye.</i>

51
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,535
What's shaking, Skip?

52
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,176
<i>How could my boyfriend be gay?</i>

53
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,803
<i>He's, like,
the best Christian I know.</i>

54
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:48,265
<i>He's an athlete who's
constantly strengthening himself--</i>

55
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,393
<i>physically, creatively,
and spiritually for the Lord.</i>

56
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,647
Thank you, Jesus.

57
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:02,654
<i>Why had he been stricken
with such a spiritually toxic affliction?</i>

58
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:10,287
<i>I figured I needed to take
the most direct approach to saving him.</i>

59
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,623
<i>I mean,
it was Christ's will and all.</i>

60
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:16,210
Jesus spoke to you?
In person?

61
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,794
He trusts me.

62
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,507
Okay? You're just gonna
have to trust me, too.

63
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,222
- Just kiss me, okay?
- Okay.

64
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,017
<i>Dean and I worked diligently
on his problem</i>

65
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,977
<i>for the rest of the summer.</i>

66
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,646
Anything yet?

67
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:41,985
Now?

68
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,115
Are you sure this isn't a sin?

69
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,036
<i>I was pretty sure
what we were doing wasn't a sin,</i>

70
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,164
<i>but not sure enough
to give Dean what he really needed.</i>

71
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:58,794
<i>I needed spiritual guidance
or a sign or something, and quick.</i>

72
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,011
<i>Hilary Faye seemed to have
a spiritual solution for every problem.</i>

73
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,681
Christian girls have got to know
how to protect themselves.

74
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:15,394
I mean, sure, Jesus could restore
my physical and spiritual virginity,

75
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:19,314
especially if I lost it
to some rapist, but...

76
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,858
who wants that?

77
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:26,196
I'm saving myself until marriage,
and I'll use force if necessary.

78
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,411
What's all that about
restoring your virginity?

79
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,454
I mean, physically,
you're a virgin once.

80
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:38,667
Yeah, and it's not about reversing
the violation of your blessed womb.

81
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,420
It's about Jesus
granting you a virginal heart.

82
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,589
That way, you're pure again.

83
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,549
Do it.

84
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,887
<i>My next move was clear.</i>

85
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,430
Nice.

86
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,807
You're getting the hang of it.

87
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,793
How are you doing?
What's going on?

88
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,808
What's going on?

89
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,117
<i>Sure, it was a radical step,</i>

90
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,746
<i>but why else had Jesus
directed me to the gun range?</i>

91
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,665
Thank you, Jesus.

92
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:19,184
<i>Having asked Jesus to restore
my emotional and spiritual virginity</i>

93
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,436
<i>in exchange for curing Dean,</i>

94
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,898
<i>I started my senior year
with all of that behind me.</i>

95
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,736
This new van is amazing.

96
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,655
Thanks.

97
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,326
It's official.

98
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,037
The Christian Jewels--
I bought one for everybody.

99
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,707
Pin it on.
I wanna see it.

100
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,213
It's terrific, Hilary Faye.
Thank you.

101
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,298
You're welcome.

102
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,761
Hi, Roland.
How was your summer?

103
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,347
- What?
- Your summer, how was it?

104
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,602
Well, I went rollerblading,
water-skiing, learned to kickbox.

105
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,061
You know, the usual.

106
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:07,024
Why do you have to make people feel so
awkward about your differently-abledness?

107
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,401
I'm sorry, I really don't know
what's gotten into him.

108
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,029
<i>Here's the latest from Godflight.</i>

109
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,198
I love these guys.

110
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,743
They are totally
Jesus-centric and gorgeous.

111
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,664
<i>Veronica was
adopted by her parents</i>

112
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,375
<i>when they were
missionaries in Vietnam.</i>

113
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,337
<i>Hilary Faye sees her
as an example of God's will</i>

114
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,548
<i>triumphing over
a savage, godless nation.</i>

115
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,801
So what do you think
of the new ride?

116
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,763
You're so lucky, Hilary Faye.

117
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,225
Yeah, I could've had
a Lexus gold edition, you know.

118
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,853
Roland is blessed
with such a thoughtful sister.

119
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:48,649
In countries like China, Hilary Faye
probably would've been killed at birth.

120
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,902
And then where
would you be, Roland?

121
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:53,195
China.

122
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,158
Welcome.

123
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,910
You're one of us now.

124
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,247
- What?!
- Come on, pin it on.

125
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,464
You guys, I'm not gonna have
any time to warm up now.

126
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,966
- You will.
- Where's Dean?

127
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,051
He knows I have to sing
at assembly this morning.

128
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,428
He's coming.

129
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,139
Can you go check?
Move him along a little bit?

130
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,307
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

131
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,433
Not a problem.

132
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,987
Is Dean ready?

133
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,488
I...

134
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,449
I found this
under Dean's bed last night.

135
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:45,414
He's on his way
to Mercy House this morning.

136
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,499
He could be gone a long time.

137
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,294
We thought you should know.

138
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,129
But...

139
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,007
I'm so sorry, Mary.

140
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,342
Let's go.

141
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,392
Is he coming out, or not?

142
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,145
Not.

143
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,481
<i>Mercy House
is a Christian treatment facility</i>

144
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,443
<i>where they deal with
everything from drug abuse,</i>

145
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:19,990
<i>to alcoholism, to de-gayification,
and unwed mothers.</i>

146
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,830
I need to tell you guys something.

147
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:35,214
What? It wasn't like it was
some kind of secret.

148
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,716
The guy was like
a one-man gay pride parade.

149
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,478
You know, we've never
had a gay at American Eagle.

150
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,231
We're not gonna
tell anyone, okay?

151
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,357
Sure.

152
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,527
Hilary Faye.

153
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,073
- You promised me.
- Yeah, that's fine.

154
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,908
What if you had married him?

155
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,952
The gayness would be
passed on to your children.

156
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:16,046
<i>Cassandra Edelstein was the only
Jewish to ever attend American Eagles.</i>

157
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,341
<i>She transferred in last year
amid rumors that she was a stripper.</i>

158
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:23,095
<i>Everyone wanted to get her saved,
especially Hilary Faye.</i>

159
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,224
Hi, Cass.
Welcome back.

160
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:33,021
Smoking isn't just bad for you,
it's bad for all of us.

161
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,815
Secondhand smoke kills.

162
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,025
I'm counting on it.

163
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:40,946
Oh, my gosh!
Hilary Faye, are you okay?!

164
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,283
I bet she doesn't even have
a handicap permit for her car.

165
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,120
And I'm right!

166
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,416
Oh, my God.

167
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,967
Come on. We don't want to be late
for homeroom, okay?

168
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,143
Let's get to class.

169
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,687
- Hi, Matt.
- Hey.

170
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,115
- I'm a Jewel.
- Oh, it's awesome!

171
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,125
Hey, guys, guess what?

172
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:38,170
I think Jesus appeared to me
in my fish tank, and he--

173
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,923
It's okay, it didn't move.

174
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,634
The tank's kinda dirty
and most of the fish are dead,

175
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,135
but my mom said if you guys--

176
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,637
Okay, Tia, thanks.

177
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,681
- I'll see you after class.
- I'll talk to you guys after class.

178
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:54,102
I hope you all
let God use you as a vessel

179
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,355
for his divine plan this summer.

180
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,484
I'm sure by now most of you
have noticed the beautiful billboard

181
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,778
designed and painted
by our own Hilary Faye

182
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,571
and donated by her father.

183
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:05,948
Thank you.

184
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,200
Mary helped.

185
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:14,164
And speaking of new additions, class.
I'd like you to welcome Patrick Wheeler.

186
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:23,674
<i>Most of the boys in school looked
like NASA employees, not Patrick.</i>

187
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,217
<i>There had to be a catch.</i>

188
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,719
Patrick is Pastor Skip's son.

189
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:31,056
He's been in South America
doing missionary work with his mother,

190
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,517
and this summer
he just completed a world tour

191
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,269
with the Christian
skateboard association.

192
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,353
Nice.

193
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,730
Out there hitting the board
for the Lord?

194
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,108
Is nothing sacred to you people?

195
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,527
Before this morning's assembly,

196
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:47,906
why don't we catch up
on what everyone did this summer?

197
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:51,785
Mary, let's start with you.

198
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,138
All right, everyone.

199
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:15,350
put your hands together
for the Christian Jewels!

200
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:25,569
Some of the words to myself
would make the clouds disappear

201
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:31,825
If you were gone,
what would I become?

202
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:35,913
You're so good to me

203
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,206
I mean that.

204
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:41,752
Oh, clarity

205
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,922
Dear God

206
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,883
A little piece of Heaven

207
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:52,054
A little piece of Heaven
in my world

208
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,390
So, I figured they would've
sent you to a special school by now.

209
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,809
This is a special school.

210
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,480
No.

211
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,486
I fell out of a tree
when I was nine.

212
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,112
Hilary Faye found me.

213
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,199
She calls it
the miracle that saved my life.

214
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,034
The miracle
you could've used

215
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,662
would've been not falling out
of the tree in the first place.

216
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,165
Sorry.

217
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,168
Is that why
you're behind a year?

218
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,131
Yeah.

219
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,968
We should get back inside.

220
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:37,975
Nice.

221
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,855
- You want a push?
- Thanks.

222
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:50,529
If you stare at my ass again.
I will push you off a cliff.

223
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,889
Thank you, Jesus.
Amen.

224
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,354
All right!

225
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:32,196
Welcome to
the first assembly of the year!

226
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,865
Give it up.
The Lord Jesus is in the house!

227
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:46,001
Let's get our Christ on.
Let's kick it Jesus style.

228
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,712
Y'all wanna walk
with the ultimate rebel, right?

229
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,715
The ultimate CEO.
The biggest celebrity of them all.

230
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,885
Who's down with G.O.D?

231
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:57,387
I'm down with the G.O.D!
That's right!

232
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,519
Jesus Rules!
Jesus Rules!

233
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:16,949
Let's pray.

234
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,744
Lord, we're gonna have
an awesome school year

235
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,371
here at American Eagles
Christian High...

236
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:25,332
<i>I know I'm not supposed
to ask for specifics, Lord,</i>

237
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:29,294
<i>like when I prayed for an expensive car
and got the handicapper van instead,</i>

238
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:32,005
<i>but I want this to be
the best year ever.</i>

239
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,215
<i>And between you and me...</i>

240
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,218
<i>... I think you'll agree
I totally deserve it.</i>

241
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,721
<i>Thank you for sparing me from
the eternal hellfires of damnation.</i>

242
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,724
<i>I'm sorry I let that Promise Maker guy
touch me in the rectory.</i>

243
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:45,894
<i>Daddy still hasn 't stopped drinking,
but I know you're working on it.</i>

244
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,938
<i>And I really want to be a Jewel.</i>

245
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,441
<i>I wonder if rollerboy's paralyzed
everywhere below the waist.</i>

246
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,444
<i>Oh, yeah, she digs me.</i>

247
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:57,072
<i>Please, Jesus,
don 't let Dad humiliate me.</i>

248
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,491
Those Jesus freaks
are on to something.

249
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:02,119
<i>Especially in front of her.</i>

250
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:06,039
<i>About Dean and I,
I thought we had a deal.</i>

251
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,126
<i>Why is he at Mercy House?</i>

252
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,589
<i>You did restore me, right?</i>

253
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,426
And keep our president safe.

254
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:19,803
Amen.

255
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:25,142
Now, who wants to come down here
and give their heart to the Lord?

256
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,979
Who wants to start the year
off right and get saved?

257
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,690
A lot of temptations
over the summer.

258
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:35,152
I bet some of you folks
backslid just a little.

259
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,487
Who wants to recommit
themselves to the Lord?

260
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:40,324
There we go!
All right.

261
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:43,660
All right.
Praise Jesus.

262
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:45,996
Fantastic.

263
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,081
Praise Jesus.
Come on down.

264
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:51,210
- There you go.
- Awesome.

265
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,677
Welcome home.
Welcome home to Jesus.

266
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,305
Welcome to his home.
Jesus loves you.

267
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,352
Praise Jesus.
Accept him into your heart.

268
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,278
Hallelujah!

269
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,701
Hallelujah!
Bear witness.

270
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,912
She's speaking
God's love language, folks!

271
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:32,376
Oh, my God.
The Jew girl's speaking in tongues!

272
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:35,170
She's gonna show her boobs.
Thank you, Jesus.

273
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:36,880
<i>She is!
She's gonna show her boobs!</i>

274
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:40,759
Mahh possie is a hot pooosie!

275
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:42,719
Mahh hotta pooosie!

276
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,806
Mahh possie is a hot pooosie!

277
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:49,852
Mahh possie is a hot pooosie!

278
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:52,187
She's saying
she's got a hot--

279
00:21:54,565 --> 00:22:01,238
<i>After that, Cassandra's status
went from a cautionary tale to legend.</i>

280
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,033
<i>It seemed like there was no act
too vulgar to get her expelled.</i>

281
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,119
<i>The more she acted out...</i>

282
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:10,789
<i>... the more Hilary Faye
wanted to get her saved.</i>

283
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:15,711
I am totally glad she wasn't expelled.
Her actions are such a cry for help.

284
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,797
She may not know this now,
but she is like--

285
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:22,551
she's like that much closer
to accepting Jesus in her heart, right?

286
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:26,805
Seriously, she could be some poor savage
in some remote jungle somewhere

287
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:30,100
who will never know the Lord
and who will never go to Heaven, ever.

288
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:34,730
I think that's why God has missionaries
like Patrick to spread his word.

289
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,776
Yeah.
What's up, guys?

290
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:42,529
- You're Mary, right?
- Here's your board.

291
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:44,323
- Thanks, bro.
- Yeah.

292
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,117
You played the keyboard
during assembly. That was really cool.

293
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,952
- Thanks.
- Isn't she great?

294
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:53,332
She knows just how to compliment my
vocal stylings without overpowering them.

295
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,628
We were just talking about
all your missionary work, it's so great.

296
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:01,465
So, like, what part of the world
has the worst heathens?

297
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,091
'Cause I'm so interested in that.

298
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:07,679
Honestly, I couldn't say.
Mostly, I just stuck to skating.

299
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:10,891
No, but how many of them
did you actually save, do you think?

300
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,143
Guys, I totally scored
some free stuff for you.

301
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:14,561
Thank you, Tia.

302
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:16,813
Piss off, asshole!

303
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,191
And another thing--
no more muffin for you.

304
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,193
The muffin shop is closed!

305
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,945
- Come on.
- Oh, my gosh.

306
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:26,323
She is in worse shape
than I ever could have imagined, right?

307
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:28,992
We need to show her
just how cool we Christians can be.

308
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,537
- Totally.
- Let's start the laughing.

309
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:34,206
Now!

310
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,337
Cass, come join us.
We're just--

311
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,925
Do you wanna go wait in the van again?
Do you know these are new pants!

312
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,886
You're handicapped,
but get it together.

313
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:52,558
Hey, Roland,
how about we get outta here.

314
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,060
and you can give me
a little spin in that thing?

315
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,563
Release his parking brake,
Hilary "Fake."

316
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,691
You smell like Tia's dad.
Have you been drinking?

317
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:01,817
Come on. Careful.

318
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:06,196
I'm having a vision
of the Virgin Mary.

319
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,865
Cassandra, are you all right?

320
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,868
What she needs to do
is accept Jesus into her heart.

321
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,744
I think what she needs
is a ride home.

322
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,496
- I'll take her.
- I'll help you, then.

323
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,873
Come on, Cassandra.

324
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,041
No, no, let go of the pizza.

325
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,419
Get off of me!

326
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:24,006
Helping Patrick
haul Cassandra out of the mall

327
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,884
was like the most perfect
God-centered moment.

328
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:30,053
You really learn a lot about a boy
when you're servicing the Lord.

329
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,222
Hilary Faye, I can see your pad.

330
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:35,058
- I can see a little bit of it right--
- Quit it!

331
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:40,063
Slowly raise up through the knees,
still bent at the waist, and roll to standing.

332
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,148
Good.

333
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,108
And twist and hold.

334
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,195
Come on.
Keep holding.

335
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,323
I know what you're looking at, Mary.

336
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:50,908
And Jesus does, too,

337
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:07,674
<i>After a threatening letter
from the State Board of Education,</i>

338
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:11,136
<i>they finally broke down
and created a Sex-Ed class.</i>

339
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,388
<i>A little too late, I might add.</i>

340
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,058
So, it's all about
populating the planet.

341
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:20,229
And good Christians don't
get jiggy with it until they're married.

342
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:21,772
Lights.

343
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,235
Yes, Mary.

344
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:35,202
Is it possible Jesus might need us
to do his will by, you know, not waiting?

345
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,332
Of course,
he wants us to wait.

346
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:43,418
I don't think I get
what you mean, Mary.

347
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,422
I don't know.

348
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:51,343
<i>Which variety of bass
is not indigenous to North America?</i>

349
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:52,970
- B--small mouth.
- Peacock.

350
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:56,515
<i>- Large mouth?
- I'm sorry. That's incorrect.</i>

351
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,559
<i>This religious figure
was best known</i>

352
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,895
<i>for offering to God
a sacrifice of one of his sons.</i>

353
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,689
<i>- Moses!
- Brenda.</i>

354
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,191
<i>I--I'm guessing Abraham?</i>

355
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,318
<i>- That's correct.
- Oh, really?</i>

356
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,572
<i>- Congratulations. Well done.
- I hate this show.</i>

357
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,824
<i>Coming up on Lifetime,</i>

358
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:17,327
<i>Valerie Bertinelli
stars in "Bitter Harvest"--</i>

359
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:20,372
<i>a sensitive portrayal
of one woman's struggle with cancer.</i>

360
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:22,040
This looks good.

361
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,794
<i>There was a feeling
of twilight in the air...</i>

362
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,840
<i>... all honeydew and lilac.</i>

363
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:32,092
<i>God wasn't just
smiling down on me...</i>

364
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,679
<i>... he was jumping up and cheering.</i>

365
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,098
<i>And then, well...</i>

366
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,143
<i>... I thought I was pregnant.</i>

367
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,936
<i>I'd been throwing up every morning</i>

368
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,522
<i>and hadn't had my period
in two months.</i>

369
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:47,941
<i>So I took a home pregnancy test.</i>

370
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:49,401
<i>What happened?</i>

371
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,698
<i>I found out I wasn't pregnant.</i>

372
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,160
<i>It was the cancer.</i>

373
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:03,207
She found all that out
from a home pregnancy test?

374
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:08,378
<i>Valerie's struggles made me realize
that my problems weren't so bad.</i>

375
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,882
<i>Dean was getting help,
and I still had the Jewels.</i>

376
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,717
<i>I was gonna be okay.</i>

377
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:34,696
- You work here, too?
- Yeah, I'm saving up for a car.

378
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,407
When I get one I can
come pick you up and stuff.

379
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:39,827
You okay?

380
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,454
Yeah, it's just really hot in here.

381
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,915
- I'll see you later.
- Promise?

382
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:54,132
Please let it be cancer.
Please let it be cancer.

383
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:31,336
The test mentions something
about a possible false positive.

384
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:39,052
Do you have anything
later on Monday?

385
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:46,768
3:00?
No, no, I can make that.

386
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:50,731
I have my leadership meeting
tonight after work.

387
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:56,069
- You're not wearing that, are you?
- Why not?

388
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:57,696
You just can't, Mom.

389
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,408
You're right,
it's too hot for a sweater.

390
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:06,914
- I'll see you later.
- Bye, hon.

391
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:14,004
Hey, Mary.
Sorry to hear about Dean's faggotry.

392
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:16,673
- What?!
- See you at P, circle?

393
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:27,768
Can I talk to you?

394
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,273
What's going on?

395
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,692
You promised me.

396
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:41,615
It's hard.

397
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:45,035
But I think this is the only way
we can actually help Dean.

398
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:48,330
Don't you think?

399
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:51,375
Come on.
You're not born a gay.

400
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,001
You're born-again.

401
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:55,587
I don't know
what I think anymore.

402
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:57,881
I've gotta go.

403
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,384
Wait. Don't you need me
to give you a ride home?

404
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:01,927
Not today, Hil.

405
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,389
Okay. Well, tonight
at the prayer circle meeting then, okay?

406
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,311
Prayer circle meeting
at my house at 7:00.

407
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:14,398
I'm conducting it
for Mary's gay boyfriend Dean.

408
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:30,080
What?

409
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,750
You know where a guy
can get some smokes?

410
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,100
What's the matter?

411
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:52,477
Scared to be seen
in public with a stripper?

412
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:55,063
No. Scared of being seen
with a cripple?

413
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:56,565
I've been seen with worse.

414
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,776
Hilary Faye's gonna freak out
when I'm not there waiting for her.

415
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:00,986
Who cares?

416
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:04,990
It's just that I don't
get out much on my own.

417
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:09,453
- I'm not really a stripper.
- I'm not really a Christian.

418
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:14,458
So, how did you
end up at American Eagle?

419
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,502
I mean, you're Jewish, right?

420
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:19,087
Well, after I got expelled
from my last school,

421
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,465
it was either here
or home schooling.

422
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:25,844
I figured I could handle
these freaks better than my parents.

423
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,804
Lucky me.

424
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:32,893
- Are you playing footsies with me?
- Wheelies.

425
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,146
Hey, isn't that...

426
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,651
What is she doing downtown?

427
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:44,196
There's only one reason Christian girls
come down to the Planned Parenthood.

428
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,282
- She's planting a pipe bomb?!
- Okay, two reasons.

429
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,826
With Dean?!

430
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:51,453
I think there's a better chance
of that pipe bomb.

431
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:58,043
I... I should get home.

432
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:03,048
Yeah, you should.

433
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,576
Shit.

434
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,127
Fuck.

435
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,599
Goddamn.

436
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:43,524
And we pray for all the perverts, Lord,
but especially for Dean,

437
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:46,652
whom at this time,
just hasn't found the right girl.

438
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:52,074
We join together and beg you
to rid him of his unnatural perversions.

439
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,618
May you lead him
out of the darkness, Lord,

440
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:57,287
and into your divine light.

441
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:58,664
Amen.

442
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:02,292
That was good.
That felt really nice.

443
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:05,087
Thank you so much
for that good prayer.

444
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,214
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

445
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:10,425
How are you? So good to see you.
We've been waiting for you.

446
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:14,012
We were just finishing up, so if you
have anything else you wanna add.

447
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:15,931
Jesus is still listening.

448
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:18,308
Jesus isn't listening, Hilary Faye.

449
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,229
I did everything I could to save Dean,
and he still ended up at Mercy House.

450
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:23,313
Let's take a breath--

451
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:25,983
What can they say and do
that I haven't already done!

452
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:27,109
Don't embarrass me!

453
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:29,361
We have to pray about this.
Prayer works!

454
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:33,365
- It's been medically proven.
- Just lay off of me, Hilary!

455
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:34,491
Wait a second.

456
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,369
Give me that.

457
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,206
You could pollute the Jewels
and everything we stand for.

458
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:45,002
And I can't have that.
Good-bye.

459
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:48,755
I hope you know
that this is all a waste of time.

460
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:59,933
I just got off the phone
with Hilary Faye.

461
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:03,395
Wow! Can she be
an uppity whootie-who.

462
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:09,401
What's the matter?

463
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:11,028
Nothing.

464
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,572
Come on.

465
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,540
Why do you think Dean's parents
sent him away so fast?

466
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:26,293
They probably thought
they couldn't handle it by themselves.

467
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:30,047
Having a child
is like owning a car--

468
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:32,966
I can change the oil,
fill the gas tank,

469
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,719
take it to a carwash,
but if the carburetor broke.

470
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:38,138
I wouldn't have a clue
as to how to fix it.

471
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:41,725
What are you saying--you'd actually
send me to a place like Mercy House?

472
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:44,353
Mary, please don't tell me
you're a lesbian.

473
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:51,568
Should I be worried about you?

474
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:55,697
I don't need to
worry about you... do I?

475
00:35:58,283 --> 00:35:59,451
No.

476
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:06,708
<i>My mom just compared me to a car,</i>

477
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:09,378
<i>so me having a baby</i>

478
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:13,090
<i>definitely falls into the category
of things she couldn't handle.</i>

479
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:17,970
<i>A week after prom
and two days after I turned eighteen,</i>

480
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:20,848
<i>I was going to join
the unwed mothers club.</i>

481
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:24,685
Dean, I'm really sorry
about what we did.

482
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:27,980
I mean, we should've
at least used protection.

483
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:29,815
<i>But you're the only person
I've been with.</i>

484
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:32,442
<i>- No, I know that.
- I don't have anything.</i>

485
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:34,611
It's just--
Dean, I really...

486
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:36,905
<i>I need to tell you something.</i>

487
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:39,950
- Hey, governor.
- Hi, Mitch.

488
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:44,454
<i>- Mitch?
- He's my roommate.</i>

489
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:46,707
He's here for
the same reason as me.

490
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,458
<i>He even ran away from home
to San Francisco.</i>

491
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,836
He's like the worst one here.

492
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:53,714
<i>- You better be careful.
- I'm gonna beat this.</i>

493
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:56,008
According to the brochure,
hundreds of others have.

494
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,051
<i>What were you gonna say?</i>

495
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:03,015
Nothing. Just...

496
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,352
I wanted to know
if you'd be out by prom.

497
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,980
<i>- Wild horses couldn't stop me.
- Mercy House residents--</i>

498
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:12,357
I gotta go. We're doing
a Christian haunted house.

499
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,567
<i>Happy Halloween.</i>

500
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:21,366
Let's go, let's go.
Let's pick it up.

501
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:26,997
Nice costume.

502
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,290
Thanks.

503
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:32,336
'Cause we have the same...

504
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:40,135
If you don't let go, I'll tell everybody
you touch me inappropriately

505
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:41,970
while helping me in the bathroom.

506
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:44,973
- Is that supposed to embarrass me?
- I'm tired of you pushing me around.

507
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:48,060
Well, maybe I'm tired
of pushing you around.

508
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:49,937
He's all yours!

509
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,147
Thanks.
Call me later, okay?

510
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:54,566
He doesn't appreciate
one thing you do for him.

511
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:57,569
Without the strength and love
that Jesus provides me,

512
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:00,113
do you really think Cassandra's
gonna be able to take care of him?

513
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,448
No way.

514
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:03,325
She's just gonna
end up hurting him.

515
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:06,370
By the look of the bruises
on his neck, she already has.

516
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:07,746
Tia, please.

517
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:09,748
What are you supposed to be?

518
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:11,834
A roller skate.

519
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,962
I've got something to show you.

520
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,213
You do?

521
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:27,266
You didn't just do this
for the parking permit, did you?

522
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:28,517
Pretty much.

523
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:33,146
<i>In the meantime,
I was trying to find a new religion</i>

524
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,524
<i>or a new God or whatever,</i>

525
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:39,444
<i>but to tell you the truth,
they were all kind of freaking me out.</i>

526
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:44,950
<i>I mean, sure, they can't all be right,
but they can 't all be wrong, right?</i>

527
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:56,837
You know, the whole
crystal thing is so felt up.

528
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,423
Don't you have a church
to desecrate or something?

529
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:01,466
Roland and I saw you
sneaking out of the clinic.

530
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:04,636
Kudos on the Bono shades,
by the way.

531
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:07,639
I was distributing pamphlets.

532
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:10,893
I was trying to prevent
girls like you from making a mistake.

533
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,270
Thank you.

534
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:16,315
After we win
the costume contest,

535
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:19,401
we'll distribute religious tracts
to the kids instead of candy.

536
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:22,237
- Good one.
- That's awesome.

537
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:23,363
Hey, ladies.

538
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:26,783
- Sorry. You got a second?
- Yeah.

539
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:29,119
Listen, I'm concerned about Mary.

540
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:30,704
Something's going on.

541
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,206
Yeah, me too.

542
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:36,460
Well, she's part of your posse,
and I think that you could help her.

543
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:40,464
I'm gonna need you to be a warrior
out on the front lines for Jesus.

544
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:42,174
You mean like shoot her?

545
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:48,096
No, no, I was thinking
of something a little less gangsta.

546
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,142
I need someone who's spiritually armed
to help guide her back to her faith,

547
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,811
to love and care
that only Jesus can supply.

548
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,980
- You down with that?
- Yeah, I'm down with that.

549
00:39:57,064 --> 00:40:00,651
She's pretty vulnerable right now,
so I'm gonna need you to be extra gentle.

550
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:04,696
- Hurry! Hurry! Come on!
- I'm going! I'm going!

551
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,198
- Get her!
- Come on, Tia!

552
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,868
Stuff her in here!
Hurry up! Hurry Up!

553
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:15,999
In the name of Jesus Christ.

554
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:18,168
I command you,
leave the body of this servant of God.

555
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,879
You're performing
an exorcism on me?! Get off me!

556
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:22,798
Where are you going?
Get back here!

557
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:24,716
We've gotta
get rid of the evil in you.

558
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,552
- It's God's will!
- God's will?

559
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:29,805
- Christ died for your sins!
- Okay, wait a second.

560
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:32,015
Are you not gonna accept
our intervention?

561
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,350
You mean kidnapping? No!

562
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:35,686
You are backsliding
into the flames of hell.

563
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:38,772
You've become a magnet for sin.
We've all witnessed it.

564
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:41,233
Sure.
Veronica acting all pure.

565
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,861
What about last spring break
at the Promise Maker's rally?

566
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:47,781
You are making accusations
as we're trying to save your soul?

567
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:50,242
Mary, turn away from Satan.

568
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:52,995
Jesus--he loves you.

569
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:56,540
You don't know
the first thing about love.

570
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:59,710
I am filled with Christ's love!

571
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:03,172
You are just jealous
of my success in the Lord.

572
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:07,176
This is not a weapon, you idiot.

573
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:20,731
What, did they send you to
strap me on the back of your scooter?

574
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:24,151
Scooter?
Mary, this is a Vespa.

575
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,321
And I don't know
what you're talking about. Hop on.

576
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:30,824
I'd rather walk.

577
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:32,409
Suit yourself.

578
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:40,083
She actually tried to exorcise you?

579
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:41,168
Yeah.

580
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,420
That was nice of her, I guess.

581
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:47,633
The way things have been going.
I probably should've let her.

582
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:50,427
Listen, Mary...

583
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:54,932
I want you to know that I don't think
Dean's sick or anything.

584
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:57,518
- Yeah, right.
- No, really.

585
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:00,896
Mercy House doesn't really exist
for the people who get sent there.

586
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:03,565
It exists more for the people
who do the sending.

587
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:06,985
So why were you at Hilary Faye's
when she was praying for Dean?

588
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:10,447
Honestly...

589
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:14,326
I thought you'd be there.

590
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:25,170
Well, thank you
for the ride, Patrick.

591
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:26,588
Any time.

592
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,972
Do you wanna go out sometime?

593
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:39,643
What--are you gonna
take me out on your scooter?

594
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:43,313
Come on.
I'm, like, totally adorable.

595
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:46,066
Besides,
it would drive Hilary Faye crazy.

596
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:53,198
I can't.
I'm not dating right now.

597
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:56,827
What about tomorrow night?
Will you be dating then?

598
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:01,248
Good night, Patrick.

599
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:04,334
Thank you so much.

600
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:07,171
You guys are so sweet.
You know what?

601
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,673
We need to...

602
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:13,760
We need to take a moment

603
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:15,971
and think about those people
who aren't as fortunate

604
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:18,056
to have the body of Christ
in their life right now.

605
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,810
So, let's...
let's pray for Mary.

606
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:23,896
<i>Lucky for me, at our school,</i>

607
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:28,108
<i>teen pregnancy was about as common
as the flesh-eating virus.</i>

608
00:43:28,192 --> 00:43:29,860
<i>No one really
seemed to catch on.</i>

609
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:31,028
All right, students...

610
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,905
<i>Except Cassandra.</i>

611
00:43:32,988 --> 00:43:35,991
... and we're going to continue
with the Beatitudes.

612
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:38,160
- Let's--Mary?
- Could I have a bathroom pass?

613
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:39,578
- Sure.
- Thanks.

614
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,331
Blessed are those who are persecuted
because of righteousness,

615
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:44,666
for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.

616
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,586
Blessed are you when people
insult you, persecute you,

617
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:50,714
and falsely say all kinds of evil
against you because of me.

618
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,222
Excuse me.

619
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:03,560
It doesn't bother you to have
people smoking around you?

620
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:05,103
It's so bad for the baby.

621
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,899
I'm not pregnant, okay?

622
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:13,195
So, what's your plan?
It's too late for the big A.

623
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:17,741
You look like a smuggler.
I know somewhere you could sell it.

624
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:19,284
I'm not gonna sell my...

625
00:44:27,084 --> 00:44:28,585
It's Dean's, isn't it?

626
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:33,549
You can't do this on your own.

627
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,301
Yes, I can.

628
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:39,805
No, you can't.

629
00:44:48,272 --> 00:44:49,982
I thought I was helping him.

630
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:53,986
I thought it was...

631
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:56,864
... what Jesus wanted me to do.

632
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,202
That's pretty stupid, right?

633
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:05,706
It's not stupid.

634
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:08,584
- Yes, it is.
- It's not stupid.

635
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:20,053
If you're interested.

636
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:23,140
I know some people
who would pay a lot of money

637
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:25,309
to take naked pictures of you
in a family way.

638
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:28,312
Oh, yeah?
How much money?

639
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:32,357
You need to get out of here.

640
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:37,112
Are we cutting?

641
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:47,331
- Should you be driving?
- What is it with you people?

642
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:49,833
You don't think
we can do anything, do you?

643
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:52,878
No, I mean, you don't have
your license, do you?

644
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,004
No.

645
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:03,430
Here. Years of shoplifting
have taught me how to hide a bundle.

646
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:09,144
Did I ever tell you about the time
that I shoplifted a frozen turkey

647
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:13,065
out of a Piggly Wiggly wearing only
a tube top and some daisy dukes?

648
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:25,869
I can't pay for all of this.

649
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:29,164
Compliments of Hilary Faye.

650
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:39,800
So, Patrick asked you out,
and you turned him down?

651
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:43,053
The boy is a tomcat,
even if he is a big J.C. freak.

652
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:47,808
And, double-plus bonus.
I'm pretty sure he's not a mo.

653
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:50,978
He's Pastor Skip's son,
and I'm about to pop a baby out.

654
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:54,064
I should tell Patrick to act gay.
Maybe then he'd get a little action.

655
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:55,941
Nice, very nice.

656
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:02,072
Does it ever bother you
that he can't walk?

657
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:03,740
He can't walk?!

658
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:08,287
No, I mean
it must be tricky, that's all.

659
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,705
I don't care.

660
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:13,959
- He gets me, and I get him.
- Cool.

661
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:16,295
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello.

662
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:17,504
Check this out.

663
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:20,757
I got a candy bar
and a whole nickel.

664
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:21,884
Oh, Jesus.

665
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:25,095
Don't look now, but bitch face
is here with your boyfriend.

666
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:28,265
Hey, guys.

667
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:30,642
Merry Christmas.

668
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:35,606
What's wrong with her?

669
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:37,608
It's nothing.

670
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:42,237
I just get this really left-out feeling
around Christmas time, you know?

671
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:43,947
Jewish.

672
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:47,326
Well, if you decided
to accept Christ into your heart,

673
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:50,579
then you and your people
could join in on the fun, too.

674
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:53,499
We should go.

675
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:55,584
Bye, guys.

676
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:59,463
- Wait!
- What?

677
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:02,925
- You're right.
- I am?

678
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:04,927
I wanna join in on the fun.

679
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,054
I don't want
a Hanukkah bush this year.

680
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:09,097
I want a Christmas tree.

681
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:11,808
- You're kidding me again, right?
- I wanna get saved.

682
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:15,604
I want a relationship
with Jesus Christ, for real.

683
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:19,441
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

684
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:24,029
Okay. This is gonna
be pretty intense, Patrick.

685
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:27,699
I don't have all of
my equipment with me, but...

686
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:30,661
Okay, sit down.

687
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:35,999
First of all. we need to have you
confess all of your sins out loud.

688
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,001
Well, there's all the swears.

689
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:40,963
I mean, I have
a pretty goddamn dirty mouth.

690
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:44,007
And then there's the sex.
I mean, are we counting oral?

691
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:47,761
So, Christmas shopping
with Hilary Faye?

692
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:52,140
No, no, I just
ran into her here, honestly.

693
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:54,393
She's helping me pick out
some last-minute gifts.

694
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:59,439
- Come here. Sorry.
- What are you doing, Patrick?

695
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:01,191
I just wanna see what's in here.

696
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:02,609
- But--
- No, no, come on.

697
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:05,195
- We're not allowed...
- Just for a second.

698
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:09,366
- I don't think we should be in here.
- Yes, we should definitely be in here.

699
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:35,976
It's incredible.

700
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:51,033
I like you, Mary.

701
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:53,911
I really do.

702
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:56,079
Why?

703
00:49:57,998 --> 00:49:59,166
You're beautiful.

704
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:02,085
And you speak for yourself.

705
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:04,630
God gave us all free will,

706
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:08,509
and that day
at Hilary Faye's prayer circle,

707
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:10,469
you weren't afraid to use it.

708
00:50:11,553 --> 00:50:12,888
You inspired me.

709
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:17,184
You amaze me, Mary.

710
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,444
This is a bad idea.
I knew it.

711
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:31,114
- Wait a minute.
- You're not my type, Patrick.

712
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:32,950
Why?
Why not?

713
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:35,244
I'm sorry.

714
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:38,288
Mary, wait.

715
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:45,963
Thanks.

716
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,225
So, I duct taped a piece of rotten bacon
inside Hilary Faye's locker.

717
00:50:58,308 --> 00:50:59,434
That's disgusting.

718
00:50:59,518 --> 00:51:02,813
She made me listen to
the entire Elms CD on her iPOD.

719
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:04,857
I didn't ask you to get saved.

720
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,275
Anyway, it's not a big deal.

721
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:08,694
Last year I got saved
so I could go on a ski trip.

722
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:10,320
Oh, my God!

723
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:13,991
How do you feel?

724
00:51:14,032 --> 00:51:16,451
I'm a whole new girl, Hay Faye.

725
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:19,496
I told you!
How great is Jesus?

726
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,712
About that, I've decided
to devote my life to Satan instead.

727
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:28,797
Thanks, though!

728
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:30,632
What?

729
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:37,514
Who beefed?

730
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:42,394
She was found to be pregnant
through the Holy Spirit.

731
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:44,980
When he had contemplated this,
an angel of the Lord

732
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:48,901
appeared to him in a dream
and said, "Joseph, son of David,

733
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:51,612
"do not be afraid
to take Mary as your wife

734
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:56,200
"because the child conceived in her
is from the Holy Spirit.

735
00:51:56,241 --> 00:52:00,245
Behold, a virgin shall conceive
and bear a son."

736
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:02,498
<i>I know this is,
like, totally wrong,</i>

737
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:05,542
<i>but don't you ever wonder
if she made the whole thing up?</i>

738
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:08,086
<i>I mean, you have to admit
it's a good one.</i>

739
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,548
<i>It's not like anyone could use
virgin birth as an excuse again.</i>

740
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:15,302
<i>I don't really think she made it up,</i>

741
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:17,554
<i>but I could understand
why a girl would.</i>

742
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:20,974
Quit being so stingy.

743
00:52:21,058 --> 00:52:23,727
What? They're my
Valentine's Day chocolates.

744
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:27,231
Hilary Faye, you bought them
for yourself, so it doesn't count.

745
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:30,901
You still have that?

746
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:33,487
I haven't decided
if I wanna give it to him yet.

747
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,280
Well, you better decide fast.

748
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:43,121
Happy Valentine's Day.

749
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:46,083
- Thank you.
- I made it myself.

750
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:53,090
It's a dumb idea anyway.

751
00:53:19,575 --> 00:53:22,578
Mary's been going through
a lot of changes this year, and...

752
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:24,872
a relationship is the last thing
she needs right now.

753
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,333
Yeah, you're
the relationship expert.

754
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,587
You and Mom
don't even talk any more.

755
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,797
That's because your mom
has her missionary position,

756
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:36,884
and I have my responsibilities
running the school, and--

757
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:39,303
Mom told me
everything this summer.

758
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,972
Why didn't you just get divorced
when she wanted to?

759
00:53:43,974 --> 00:53:46,310
Because divorce
is not part of God's plan.

760
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:49,730
Dad, you need to think of a new plan.

761
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:55,652
I thought you were
at your meeting with Pastor Skip.

762
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:57,654
It got cancelled.

763
00:53:57,696 --> 00:54:01,450
Again?
That's, like, three times this week?

764
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:02,576
Four.

765
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:08,457
Well, do you wanna
talk about it?

766
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,376
I think this one's
between me and Jesus.

767
00:54:13,212 --> 00:54:15,631
But do you wanna talk?

768
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:16,840
No.

769
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:24,181
I keep trying to remind myself

770
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:27,392
that when Jesus shuts a door,
he opens a window.

771
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:30,479
Yeah, so we have something
we can jump out of.

772
00:54:40,656 --> 00:54:43,534
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.</i>

773
00:54:43,575 --> 00:54:47,996
I'm trying to get the board to okay
this new youth outreach program--

774
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:53,377
you get the kids into the church
via rock music concerts.

775
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:57,714
One of the board members says,
"Hey, I can't tell the difference

776
00:54:57,756 --> 00:55:01,301
between Christian rock
and secular rock anymore."

777
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:04,638
And I said, "Dude, exactly."

778
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:07,558
You get their attention, and then
you hit them with the message,

779
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,935
and boom,
you've saved another soul.

780
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:11,728
- Skip.
- What?

781
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,230
I don't care.

782
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:15,941
- You don't care?
- I've missed you.

783
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:18,277
I've missed our meetings.

784
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:23,115
I feel good when I'm with you.
I think you feel good, too.

785
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:31,665
I've missed you, too, yeah.

786
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:36,170
I wonder why God would give us
these feelings of happiness,

787
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:40,090
if what we're doing is wrong.

788
00:55:40,132 --> 00:55:42,259
What are we doing, Lillian?

789
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:45,137
We haven't done anything
to be ashamed of, Skip.

790
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,685
Is this how people
turn away from Christ's teachings?

791
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:52,978
I mean, I...

792
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:58,484
All the...
all the bible study I've done,

793
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:02,196
all the preaching
I've done to the kids, and...

794
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:08,660
... all the prayers
for forgiveness I've prayed, and...

795
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:15,834
All I can think about is...

796
00:56:17,294 --> 00:56:19,087
... kissing you.

797
00:56:20,422 --> 00:56:23,175
I want--
I want to kiss you.

798
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:28,764
Then kiss me.

799
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:48,200
<i>By Easter, it seemed Jesus
had answered my mom's prayers,</i>

800
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:51,912
<i>and she was as happy as she was
when she first got back from Orlando.</i>

801
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:54,998
I'm probably gonna be late tonight
'cause I have my meeting.

802
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,960
I know. What, are you
meeting twice a week now?

803
00:56:58,043 --> 00:56:59,670
Or petrol, you could do petrol.

804
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:05,717
<i>Pastor Skip suggested Patrick take
more interest in school activities.</i>

805
00:57:06,677 --> 00:57:09,680
<i>He said that by focusing
his energies on the Lord,</i>

806
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:12,182
<i>he would have less time
to think about dating.</i>

807
00:57:13,308 --> 00:57:18,188
<i>Or I should say, he would have
less time to think about dating me.</i>

808
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:30,659
Now, that's what I call
being hung on a cross.

809
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:44,548
Patrick and I and everyone--
we're gonna go grab some food.

810
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:47,634
- If you guys wanna come, that'd be cool.
- We're going to DQ.

811
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:51,597
So we can watch Hilary Faye
try and get into your Easter basket?

812
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:52,764
No, thanks.

813
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:57,936
Cassandra, it's not too late to achieve
a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.

814
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,732
Eternal damnation's
not fit for anyone, not even you.

815
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:03,275
- Right?
- Good one.

816
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:05,903
I should kick your fat,
Christian ass right now.

817
00:58:05,986 --> 00:58:07,946
Really? Do you know
that I could get you expelled

818
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:10,199
for that type of language, Edelstein?

819
00:58:10,282 --> 00:58:12,951
- And I'm not even fat, okay?!
- Your head is fat!

820
00:58:13,035 --> 00:58:14,703
And your ass is fat!

821
00:58:14,786 --> 00:58:16,246
- Whatever!
- It's like she's retarded!

822
00:58:16,288 --> 00:58:18,957
I'm two months away from getting
outta here without anyone knowing.

823
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:23,670
Just... it's hard,
but cool it, okay?

824
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:26,423
Next time,
the bitch is going down.

825
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:28,717
I'm sorry.

826
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,636
I wanna show you something.

827
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:35,807
It's a sonogram I took a while ago.

828
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:38,560
I'm having a little girl.

829
00:58:39,228 --> 00:58:40,979
You sure you're not having
a sea monkey?

830
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:43,482
- Yeah.
- She's beautiful.

831
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:46,902
You think it's safe
to keep this in your locker?

832
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:48,821
- Safer than at home.
- Let's go.

833
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:55,118
I don't really get how someone
so pretty can be so... ugly.

834
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,495
She wasn't always pretty.

835
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:59,623
My parents didn't want two handicapped
kids, and she was the easy fix.

836
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:01,375
What do you mean
"handicapped?"

837
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:02,584
Before we moved to Cherry Hill,

838
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:04,795
before the fat camps
and Tetracycline,

839
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:06,713
her outside matched her inside.

840
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:17,307
Oh, my God.

841
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:22,312
- Just make sure you put this back.
- I'll take care of it tonight.

842
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:24,231
- What are you doing with that?
- Nothing.

843
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:26,525
Well, well, well.

844
00:59:27,693 --> 00:59:28,986
If it isn't the heathens.

845
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:32,364
Burn in hell,
you narrow-minded, tacky-ass bitch.

846
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:36,451
<i>Burn in hell,
you narrow-minded--</i>

847
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:38,495
- She doesn't mean it.
- Yes, I do!

848
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:40,998
You're gonna be expelled for sure
for threatening me!

849
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:48,630
<i>Pastor Skip put us on work detail
for Hilary Faye's prom committee.</i>

850
00:59:48,714 --> 00:59:50,674
You better be wearing
underpants this time.

851
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:52,593
<i>A particularly cruel punishment.</i>

852
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,511
No, seriously, move it higher.

853
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:57,431
- Higher!
- You're doing a great job.

854
00:59:57,514 --> 00:59:59,349
It's looking really phat.

855
00:59:59,391 --> 01:00:00,809
I'm so glad.

856
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:05,147
Hey, Mary,
you need some help?

857
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:08,025
- Sure, thanks.
- I'll come to you.

858
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:17,034
So, listen, I was wondering,
what are you doing the night of prom?

859
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:19,119
Why?
Are you asking me to prom?

860
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:20,245
Maybe.

861
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:24,750
- Okay.
- Okay?

862
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:26,752
Yeah, okay,
I'll go with you.

863
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:28,462
As friends.

864
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,551
Okay, as friends.

865
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:36,803
I thought you were gonna
ask Patrick to the prom.

866
01:00:36,887 --> 01:00:38,555
Tia, would you just shut up?

867
01:00:38,597 --> 01:00:40,849
Do you wanna go back to being
invisible girl with bad hair?

868
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:42,559
That could easily happen.

869
01:00:42,643 --> 01:00:45,354
Just don't ask stupid questions!

870
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:46,772
Did you take care of business?

871
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:51,193
Now, where are you going?

872
01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:55,113
You can tacky-up prom
on your own, because I quit.

873
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:57,491
Oh, my gosh.
You can't quit.

874
01:00:57,574 --> 01:01:00,452
Watch me.
Watch me walking away.

875
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:02,246
Watch me
walking away from Jesus.

876
01:01:02,788 --> 01:01:03,789
What?!

877
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:06,375
Yes, this is she.
Who is this?

878
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:09,127
Are you serious?

879
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:13,382
Thank you so much.

880
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:19,137
Godflight has agreed to perform
at our prom! Can you believe that?!

881
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:21,932
Prayer works for everything!
I told you.

882
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:26,061
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm so excited.

883
01:01:26,145 --> 01:01:28,272
Now she's never gonna shut up.

884
01:01:28,939 --> 01:01:31,400
Give her about ten minutes.

885
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:51,962
Turn them off!
Turn them off now, please!

886
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:53,213
Turn them...

887
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,428
What?

888
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:01,305
It's not fair.

889
01:02:01,346 --> 01:02:05,392
I am trying to be a good Christian
and a living example of Christ's love,

890
01:02:05,476 --> 01:02:08,896
and I have done nothing
but bust my buns for those sinners.

891
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:11,482
And you know that Cassandra
and Mary are behind this.

892
01:02:11,523 --> 01:02:12,941
Do you have proof?

893
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:16,278
I gave you proof before,
and you did not do one thing about it.

894
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:20,991
Those who did this will not escape
the eyes of God, Hilary Faye.

895
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,502
Please, Lord, don't leave me alone.

896
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:34,713
They need to know
that what they've done is wrong.

897
01:02:39,384 --> 01:02:43,388
Please, Lord, please.
Just tell me what I need to do.

898
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:53,941
Listen, by the end of the week
we're out of here.

899
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:56,693
- She can't do anything.
- No, I know.

900
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:00,405
What's going on?

901
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:02,366
Oh, my God.

902
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:05,285
- Somebody call the police.
- Can you believe it?

903
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:09,957
No way.
This is screwed up.

904
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,668
Oh, my God.

905
01:03:13,544 --> 01:03:15,963
Holy crap!

906
01:03:19,675 --> 01:03:21,009
- That's sad.
- Turn away. Turn away.

907
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,015
All right. Everybody,
let's get to our classes, please.

908
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:29,685
- You two come in with me.
- What?

909
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:34,398
Unacceptable.
I can't even concentrate today.

910
01:03:39,278 --> 01:03:40,904
Get to class, ladies. Go on.

911
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:46,326
What?!
That's not mine!

912
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:56,420
- Pastor Skip.
- Anything else?

913
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:08,432
No, nothing more.

914
01:04:14,813 --> 01:04:16,106
What is that?

915
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:23,155
- Someone get the nurse!
- Just hang on.

916
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:26,950
I can't believe
we were friends with her.

917
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:31,330
You have everything,
Hilary Faye.

918
01:04:32,164 --> 01:04:33,957
What are you afraid of?

919
01:04:36,335 --> 01:04:39,838
So you offered up
your virginity to save Dean?

920
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:44,092
Because Jesus told you to?

921
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:48,138
- Anything else?
- No.

922
01:04:48,972 --> 01:04:51,475
Can I have a word with you?

923
01:04:57,105 --> 01:04:58,857
What's the matter, Skip?

924
01:04:58,941 --> 01:05:00,984
You didn't know
that she was pregnant?

925
01:05:01,735 --> 01:05:04,738
I thought she was stress eating,
I didn't want her to get a complex.

926
01:05:04,822 --> 01:05:09,201
You are so blinded by this...
that you can't even see it.

927
01:05:10,202 --> 01:05:11,578
Let me spell it out to you.

928
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:17,543
God is punishing us for our sin
by getting our attention through Mary.

929
01:05:17,626 --> 01:05:19,044
That doesn't even make sense.

930
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:22,214
And the longer we lived in sin,
the worse things got for her.

931
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:25,342
And what's worse is we're not
spiritually right with the Lord,

932
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:28,178
and we are not fit to help her.

933
01:05:33,392 --> 01:05:36,353
Dean has been here
for almost a year, okay?

934
01:05:36,395 --> 01:05:38,188
They can help her.

935
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:41,358
I wanna think about it.

936
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:45,737
If you're not gonna send her
to get the help she needs.

937
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:47,614
I can't see you any more.

938
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:51,243
Cassandra, wait!

939
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:54,204
He expelled me!
Can you believe that?!

940
01:05:54,246 --> 01:05:57,082
And the one time
I didn't do anything.

941
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,667
Well, I'll go with you.

942
01:06:02,212 --> 01:06:04,381
I can't deal with this right now,
I have to go.

943
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:06,800
Wait!

944
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:16,602
I don't have a ride.

945
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:06,587
Please help me find him.

946
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:23,896
You know where a girl
can get some smokes?

947
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:35,866
You never fold things.

948
01:08:35,908 --> 01:08:38,368
Well, I'm folding now.

949
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:40,704
I'm not going to Mercy House.

950
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:43,165
We agreed
that this is for the best.

951
01:08:43,248 --> 01:08:44,500
We?!
Who's we?

952
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:48,212
Pastor Skip said this child needs
to be raised by a mother and a father.

953
01:08:48,295 --> 01:08:50,005
So I don't even get a say in this?

954
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:52,758
You're not prepared
to raise this child by yourself!

955
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:58,806
Something like this could
ruin the rest of your life.

956
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,937
So, what,
did I ruin yours, Mom?

957
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,855
Don't talk like that.

958
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:14,780
It looks so perfect.

959
01:09:14,863 --> 01:09:16,865
Just like the picture that I brought in.

960
01:09:16,949 --> 01:09:18,033
Thank you.

961
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:22,746
Crap.

962
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:26,917
I'm sorry, but it's been declined.
Do you have another card?

963
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:32,548
I knew it.

964
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:36,969
Listen, I'm really sorry
I ditched you yesterday.

965
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:39,346
Look, this year has been great.

966
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:44,601
Before you, it was all about Hilary Faye
dragging my ass around all the time.

967
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:47,855
When you left yesterday,
I stuck on my own.

968
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:50,774
And it was okay.

969
01:09:52,151 --> 01:09:53,652
So...

970
01:09:53,735 --> 01:09:59,074
So I realized that I might
just be relying on you

971
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:02,578
the same way
I was relying on Hilary Faye.

972
01:10:02,661 --> 01:10:06,790
I don't wanna be the guy who's
with the girl because he needs her.

973
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:10,669
I wanna be the guy who's
with the girl because he wants her.

974
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:14,047
And I want you.

975
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:17,759
I want you, too.

976
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:24,766
And I thought it was all about the sex.

977
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:27,144
Oh, well, that too.

978
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,524
Look, I have
this crazy idea about tonight.

979
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:43,035
Mary, Roland's on the phone.

980
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:45,245
I got it.

981
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:48,999
What's going on?

982
01:10:56,715 --> 01:10:59,927
- Hello. Where you headed?
- Lombard and Kale, please.

983
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:12,231
You guys look incredible.

984
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:15,317
You're not really
going to prom, are you?

985
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,905
Don't get angry,
but I got you a really sexy dress.

986
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:23,700
Hilary Faye's gonna call the cops
if we show up at her prom.

987
01:11:23,784 --> 01:11:24,993
No, she won't.

988
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:26,411
See, I've been snagging
all her credit card bills

989
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:29,289
so she wouldn't find out about
all the charges we made, right?

990
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:30,332
Look at this.

991
01:11:30,415 --> 01:11:33,335
She charged a bunch
of spray paint at Home Depot

992
01:11:33,418 --> 01:11:35,212
at 3 A.M. on the morning of the attack.

993
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:36,755
Now we have proof.

994
01:11:36,797 --> 01:11:39,216
We have every right
to be at that prom.

995
01:11:42,135 --> 01:11:45,931
Oh, yeah.
We've got another surprise for you.

996
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:14,459
So cute.

997
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:17,671
I got yellow and red
'cause I didn't know which one...

998
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:19,089
But, Patrick...

999
01:12:22,384 --> 01:12:24,887
It really doesn't matter to me.

1000
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:28,265
Are you sure?

1001
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:33,103
Yeah.

1002
01:12:51,914 --> 01:12:53,248
Red. Right.

1003
01:12:53,332 --> 01:12:57,628
I can't believe that you guys
did all of this for me.

1004
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:59,087
So, you in?

1005
01:13:02,758 --> 01:13:03,800
I'm in.

1006
01:13:04,426 --> 01:13:06,595
I knew Mary was hiding something.

1007
01:13:06,678 --> 01:13:11,308
To imagine her humping that pervert
makes me sick to my stomach.

1008
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:13,685
- Gross.
- And Roland still hasn't shown up.

1009
01:13:13,811 --> 01:13:16,355
I can't believe your own brother
calls you the "C" word.

1010
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:18,899
I can't believe we have to go
to the prom in this van.

1011
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:21,527
Yeah, well, get over it, okay?

1012
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:25,113
When I tried to pay for my hair, my
credit card was mysteriously maxed out,

1013
01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:28,450
and the limo guy wouldn't take
a personal check. Get off my back!

1014
01:13:28,534 --> 01:13:30,536
It's bad enough we don't have dates.

1015
01:13:30,619 --> 01:13:32,871
Hey, let me try that tiara on.

1016
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:34,498
Lay off the tiara, Tia!

1017
01:13:42,631 --> 01:13:44,800
Your pimple hardly shows,
Hilary Faye.

1018
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:47,094
Come on, Tia!
Let's get the lead out!

1019
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:48,971
Let's go.
We're gonna be late.

1020
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:51,473
Coming.

1021
01:13:51,557 --> 01:13:53,559
- Okay?
- You look beautiful.

1022
01:13:53,642 --> 01:13:54,977
You can hardly see that thing.

1023
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:57,354
Can you stop bringing it up?
Thank you.

1024
01:13:57,437 --> 01:14:00,357
Let's go. Come on, Tia.
Walk fast.

1025
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:02,234
Run.

1026
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:05,529
<i>Name the most recognizable
figure in the world.</i>

1027
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:07,197
Jesus Christ.

1028
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:09,741
<i>- Madonna?
- Jesus Christ.</i>

1029
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:12,953
<i>Newborns bond with their mothers
during the first three what?</i>

1030
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:15,080
<i>- Minutes.
- Months.</i>

1031
01:14:15,164 --> 01:14:17,791
<i>No! The correct answer is minutes.</i>

1032
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:19,042
<i>In "The Wizard of Oz,"</i>

1033
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:22,838
<i>Dorothy clicks her heels
three times and says what?</i>

1034
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:24,173
<i>Charlene.</i>

1035
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:42,733
Are you ready?

1036
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:45,611
- Sure.
- Sure.

1037
01:14:45,694 --> 01:14:46,737
Why are they here?

1038
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:04,439
Praise Jesus, everybody!
Jesus loves you!

1039
01:16:06,275 --> 01:16:08,986
We're taking a short break.
We'll be back in ten.

1040
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:18,162
We will inherit the earth.
Praise Jesus.

1041
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:23,000
On behalf
of the prom committee.

1042
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:24,918
I wanna thank
each and every one of you

1043
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:28,338
for making our "Light of the World"
prom a huge success.

1044
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,132
Give yourself a round of applause.

1045
01:16:32,593 --> 01:16:36,763
But on a sadder note--
I don't want to dampen the evening--

1046
01:16:36,847 --> 01:16:39,224
but the students
who were responsible

1047
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:43,812
for the attacks on our school
have infiltrated our prom.

1048
01:16:46,064 --> 01:16:47,941
Pastor Skip?

1049
01:16:48,025 --> 01:16:50,944
Mary Cummings and Cassandra Edelstein
have crashed our prom.

1050
01:16:51,028 --> 01:16:53,238
- Could you please...
- Maybe we should get out of here.

1051
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:54,656
We're not going anywhere.

1052
01:16:56,909 --> 01:17:01,038
Roland, where have you been?
I've been very worried about you.

1053
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:02,539
You look like you survived.

1054
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:05,876
- Excuse me.
- Finally.

1055
01:17:06,418 --> 01:17:07,628
All right. Chill out, everybody.

1056
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,339
I don't think these students
are here to do us any harm.

1057
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:12,758
- What? Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

1058
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:16,553
I think the Christian thing to do
would be to let them stay.

1059
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:18,889
The Christian thing to do?

1060
01:17:18,931 --> 01:17:21,892
I've been doing
the Christian thing my entire life.

1061
01:17:21,934 --> 01:17:26,063
I did not have sex with a gay
and try and blame it on Jesus.

1062
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:29,733
- Just cool it, Hil.
- Shut up, you fornicator.

1063
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:32,569
And I did not hack into
the school's computer system

1064
01:17:32,653 --> 01:17:35,697
and cover our walls
with that blasphemous graffiti, either.

1065
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:39,201
You planted that paint on Cassandra
and Mary to get them kicked out of school.

1066
01:17:40,994 --> 01:17:42,454
That's such a lie.

1067
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:44,748
Oh, please.

1068
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:46,124
And what does this prove,

1069
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:49,545
except the fact that you stole
my credit card to charge the paint...

1070
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:53,632
... and the clothes
from Maternity Girl.

1071
01:17:55,592 --> 01:17:58,512
Yeah, she's right, Roland.
Anybody could've made these charges.

1072
01:17:58,595 --> 01:18:02,558
Oh, yeah? You swear to God
you didn't frame us, Hilary Faye?

1073
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:04,852
No, I will not.

1074
01:18:04,935 --> 01:18:06,520
You can't swear, can you?

1075
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:08,397
Go ahead, swear it.

1076
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,066
Come on, Hil. Swear before God
and everyone else.

1077
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,076
All right, I swear.

1078
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:25,539
I swear to God
I did not graffiti our school.

1079
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:29,001
Are you guys happy?

1080
01:18:30,127 --> 01:18:31,879
Oh, yes, you did, Hilary Faye.

1081
01:18:33,005 --> 01:18:35,632
I found this crammed up
under her seat.

1082
01:18:36,884 --> 01:18:37,926
What?

1083
01:18:39,178 --> 01:18:41,221
It's got your signature,
Hilary Faye.

1084
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:47,936
Come on, Veronica.
Let's go.

1085
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,229
Let me go!

1086
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:53,275
You are nothing but a big fake!

1087
01:18:57,696 --> 01:18:59,364
I think you should go, Hilary.

1088
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:03,994
Step aside, please.

1089
01:19:04,036 --> 01:19:05,662
- Hil--
- Get away from me!

1090
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:07,581
- You really should go now.
- You go!

1091
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:10,417
I designed
these decorations here!

1092
01:19:10,501 --> 01:19:12,544
And my father
donated the refreshments!

1093
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:14,922
And I got Godflight onstage, okay?!

1094
01:19:15,005 --> 01:19:19,176
And I was just doing this
because Jesus told me to. He did!

1095
01:19:19,218 --> 01:19:23,055
Now, you, get out of my way!
All of you, get out of my way!

1096
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:44,409
Get out of my way, you freaks!

1097
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:08,267
I'll go get Patrick and Mary.

1098
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:15,190
What are you--
What are you doing here?

1099
01:20:16,817 --> 01:20:18,318
I'm going to my prom.

1100
01:20:19,611 --> 01:20:22,239
What, did Mercy House
let you just borrow the van?

1101
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:29,413
Not exactly. We sort of led a rebellion
and swiped it. You're pregnant?

1102
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:32,040
Look, I really...

1103
01:20:33,584 --> 01:20:35,752
I wanted to tell you, but--

1104
01:20:35,836 --> 01:20:37,921
On the first time?

1105
01:20:38,922 --> 01:20:39,923
Yeah.

1106
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:46,638
That is so awesome.

1107
01:20:48,098 --> 01:20:49,558
Yeah?

1108
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,106
There's something
I wanna tell you, too.

1109
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,984
He's your life-partner, right?

1110
01:21:01,528 --> 01:21:02,905
Prom date.

1111
01:21:04,615 --> 01:21:06,074
It's really nice to see you.

1112
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:10,787
- Dean, this is Patrick.
- Nice to meet you.

1113
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:11,997
Excuse me, Mary.

1114
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:15,501
Listen, son, I suggest you
and your friends get back in the van,

1115
01:21:15,584 --> 01:21:18,921
and back to Mercy House as quick
as you can before you're all arrested.

1116
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:21,256
We've had enough
excitement here for tonight.

1117
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:22,382
We're not leaving.

1118
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,053
What you and your friends have done
is not cool in the eyes of God.

1119
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:29,097
- Jesus, Dad, stop it.
- Patrick, this is not a gray area.

1120
01:21:29,181 --> 01:21:32,392
- Dad, it's all a gray area.
- The Bible is black and white!

1121
01:21:32,476 --> 01:21:35,437
Stop it!
Would you listen to yourself?

1122
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:36,647
I don't need this from you now.

1123
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,190
We've been kicked out
of our homes and schools,

1124
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:39,691
and now we're gonna
be kicked out of Mercy House?

1125
01:21:39,775 --> 01:21:41,318
There's nowhere left for us to go.

1126
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,404
I'm supposed to be here.

1127
01:21:45,364 --> 01:21:47,825
This is my prom.
I wanna spend it with my friends.

1128
01:21:47,908 --> 01:21:52,704
There's no room for moral ambiguity here.
The Bible is very clear about this.

1129
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:54,498
So everything that doesn't fit

1130
01:21:54,581 --> 01:21:57,793
into some stupid idea
of what you think God wants

1131
01:21:57,876 --> 01:22:01,171
you just try to hide
or fix or get rid of?

1132
01:22:01,839 --> 01:22:04,383
It's just all too much to live up to.

1133
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:09,388
No one fits in 100% of the time.

1134
01:22:10,806 --> 01:22:12,307
Not even you.

1135
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,309
I know that, Mary.

1136
01:22:14,393 --> 01:22:19,314
I know in my heart
that Jesus still loves me.

1137
01:22:19,398 --> 01:22:23,527
Why would God
make us all so different...

1138
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:26,196
... if he wanted us to be the same?

1139
01:22:31,368 --> 01:22:32,703
Nowwhat?

1140
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:04,359
Save the heathens, Hilary Faye.

1141
01:23:06,778 --> 01:23:09,281
Be a warrior, Hilary Faye!

1142
01:23:10,657 --> 01:23:13,410
Sacrifice everything, Hilary Faye!

1143
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:23,045
And here's your big,
fat, stupid reward!

1144
01:23:24,505 --> 01:23:25,506
Oh, my God.

1145
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:30,219
- I think I'm feeling kind of woozy.
- What?

1146
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:34,890
Somebody call an ambulance.

1147
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:37,392
That was so awesome, Hilary Faye!

1148
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:46,235
Jesus Christ!

1149
01:24:09,675 --> 01:24:13,637
- You okay?
- No, Roland.

1150
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:19,101
I crashed my van into Jesus, okay?!
I have a pimple the size of Jupiter!

1151
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:20,894
I am not okay!

1152
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:23,147
This is...

1153
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:27,484
... not how I wanted
to remember my prom.

1154
01:24:29,403 --> 01:24:32,698
This is not how I wanted
to remember my life.

1155
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:35,701
Well, maybe we could fix it...

1156
01:24:36,577 --> 01:24:38,704
... with some glue or something.

1157
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:41,248
I am so sorry, Roland.

1158
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:44,334
I shouldn't have ratted you out
in front of everyone.

1159
01:24:45,377 --> 01:24:47,963
I would have probably
done the same thing.

1160
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:52,843
Do you think
Jesus still loves me, Roland?

1161
01:24:52,885 --> 01:24:54,428
Probably not.

1162
01:24:58,182 --> 01:25:00,184
Yeah, sure.

1163
01:25:02,644 --> 01:25:05,230
Hey, she's over here!

1164
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:09,651
- I'm okay.
- Come on.

1165
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:14,740
- Don't worry. I won't bite.
- Thank you.

1166
01:25:15,324 --> 01:25:17,326
- It's gonna be okay.
- Thank you.

1167
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:39,765
I only got room for one of you.

1168
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:42,142
- I'm the father.
- I'm the boyfriend.

1169
01:25:42,226 --> 01:25:43,685
I'm his boyfriend.

1170
01:25:43,769 --> 01:25:46,104
That's nice, but I still
only got room for one of you.

1171
01:25:46,188 --> 01:25:47,815
Starting the party without me?

1172
01:25:48,774 --> 01:25:50,234
Are you okay?

1173
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:55,531
You didn't ruin my life, Mary.

1174
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:00,244
Breathe, baby.
Good girl.

1175
01:26:05,123 --> 01:26:06,375
Just keep breathing.

1176
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:09,253
Good girl.
You're gonna be fine.

1177
01:26:12,214 --> 01:26:15,384
<i>Okay, I'm pretty sure
this isn't what Jesus had in mind</i>

1178
01:26:15,467 --> 01:26:17,261
<i>when he said, "Help Dean."</i>

1179
01:26:18,595 --> 01:26:20,305
<i>Look, don't be too harsh.</i>

1180
01:26:20,389 --> 01:26:23,225
<i>I'm not the first person
to ever get the message screwed up.</i>

1181
01:26:23,308 --> 01:26:24,601
She's perfect.

1182
01:26:25,352 --> 01:26:29,690
<i>Looking at her,
it's like life is too amazing</i>

1183
01:26:29,773 --> 01:26:33,569
<i>to be this random and meaningless
consequence of the universe.</i>

1184
01:26:34,278 --> 01:26:36,071
<i>There had to be a God...</i>

1185
01:26:36,155 --> 01:26:38,240
<i>or something out there.</i>

1186
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:40,784
<i>Something inside.</i>

1187
01:26:40,826 --> 01:26:43,537
<i>You just have to feel it.</i>

1188
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:47,374
Do you want to hold her?

1189
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:24,995
Do you want to hold her, Dean?

1190
01:27:36,173 --> 01:27:39,134
<i>I mean, really,
when you think about it--</i>

1191
01:27:39,218 --> 01:27:40,719
<i>what wouId Jesus do?</i>

1192
01:27:41,887 --> 01:27:42,888
<i>I don't know...</i>

1193
01:27:43,764 --> 01:27:48,727
<i>... but in the meantime we'll be trying
to figure it out... together.</i>
