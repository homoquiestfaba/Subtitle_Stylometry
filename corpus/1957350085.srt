SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON

1063
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,732
FOR THEM TO PROJECT
THEIR FEELINGS

1064
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:38,387
ONTO A FICTITIOUS FRIEND.

1065
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,390
THERE'S NOTHING
ANYONE COULD'VE DONE.

1066
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:43,218
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT NOW.

1067
00:45:43,262 --> 00:45:44,742
YEAH, BUT...

1068
00:45:46,439 --> 00:45:48,963
RECONCILING OUR EMOTIONS

1069
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:50,530
AND OUR FEELINGS
OF INADEQUACY

1070
00:45:50,573 --> 00:45:56,231
WITH OUR LOGICAL, PRACTICAL
WAY OF THINKING--

1071
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,930
THAT'S THE HARD PART.

1072
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:02,760
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
MR. ALEXANDER

1073
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:04,239
I WAS ALREADY SEEING YOU?

1074
00:46:04,283 --> 00:46:07,416
I DON'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING
THAT HAPPENS IN THIS OFFICE.

1075
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,983
I TOOK AN OATH.

1076
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,421
N-NOTHING AT ALL?

1077
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:14,554
IF YOU DECIDED
TO UNDERLINE PASSAGES

1078
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:15,903
IN CATCHER IN THE RYE

1079
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:17,644
AND TOLD ME YOU WERE GOING
TO SHOOT THE PRESIDENT,

1080
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,820
I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

1081
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,780
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

1082
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,651
PLANNING ON KILLING
THE PRESIDENT?

1083
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:26,522
[LAUGHS] NO.

1084
00:46:26,566 --> 00:46:27,741
NO. IT'S JUST THAT...

1085
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:32,746
I THINK THAT YOU HAVE
ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT.

1086
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:47,892
SO YOU SAY RAND WAS ACTING
STRANGE THE LAST FEW WEEKS?

1087
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:49,371
YEAH. IT WAS WEIRD.

1088
00:46:49,415 --> 00:46:51,373
HE BOUGHT--YOU KNOW,
HE WAS BUYING

1089
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:54,202
DEPRESSING BOOKS
AND VIDEOS AND...

1090
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:55,595
WAS RAND DRINKING
RATHER HEAVILY

1091
00:46:55,638 --> 00:46:56,639
THE LAST NIGHT YOU SAW HIM?

1092
00:46:56,683 --> 00:46:59,077
THAT'D BE A BIG YES, SIR.

1093
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,295
REALLY?

1094
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:02,689
WOULD YOU SAY HE HAD
A PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL?

1095
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:03,690
YOU MEAN GETTING IT?

1096
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:05,431
[LAUGHS]

1097
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:07,563
JUST A LITTLE JOKE.
SORRY. UM...

1098
00:47:07,607 --> 00:47:09,522
DID HE HAVE A PROBLEM?

1099
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:10,915
I DON'T REALLY KNOW,

1100
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:12,351
BUT, CHRIS,

1101
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:14,005
YOU KNEW HIM
A LOT BETTER THAN I DID.

1102
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:16,659
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1103
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:18,574
WELL, UH, I MEAN,
MAYBE, YEAH.

1104
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:21,055
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU KNEW
RAND SINCE THE FIFTH GRADE.

1105
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:24,798
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
I DID SAY THAT,

1106
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,930
BUT, YOU KNOW,
COLLEGE, PEOPLE--

1107
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:26,887
FRIENDS KIND OF
DRIFT APART.

1108
00:47:26,931 --> 00:47:30,586
WE WERE STILL
LIKE THAT, BUT...

1109
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:31,674
OVER THE LAST YEAR,

1110
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:35,113
RAND AND CHRIS
BECAME LIKE BROTHERS.

1111
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:36,070
BROTHERS.

1112
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:38,638
WAS HE UPSET THAT NIGHT?

1113
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:40,596
WELL, I, UM...

1114
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,859
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

1115
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:43,643
CHRIS, YOU WERE WITH HIM
A LOT MORE THAT NIGHT.

1116
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:46,211
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1117
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,082
HE, UH...

1118
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:51,259
HE GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH
HIS GIRLFRIEND NATALIE,

1119
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:52,957
AND, UH...

1120
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,349
SHE'S FROM CANADA.

1121
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:56,482
IS SHE CANADIAN?

1122
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,179
YEAH.

1123
00:47:58,223 --> 00:47:59,964
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO CANADA?

1124
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:01,487
NO.

1125
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:03,271
NATALIE BRODER.

1126
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:04,577
WE HAVEN'T LOCATED HER YET.

1127
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,795
Tim: SHE CAME BY YESTERDAY
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

1128
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,754
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK
HER MOM'S HOUSE, EH?

1129
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:11,845
YOU WERE SAYING
SOMETHING ABOUT A FIGHT?

1130
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,064
UH...

1131
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:14,195
YEAH, I MEAN, WELL...

1132
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:16,458
NATALIE TOLD RAND
THAT SHE WAS PREGNANT,

1133
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:18,591
AND RAND
WAS REALLY DRUNK,

1134
00:48:18,634 --> 00:48:19,809
AND HE GOT VERY UPSET.

1135
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:21,202
HE THOUGHT
IT WASN'T HIS,

1136
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:23,857
SO HE PUSHED HER,
AND SHE FELL DOWN.

1137
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,207
CHRIS TRIED TO BREAK IT UP.

1138
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:28,775
REALLY?

1139
00:48:28,818 --> 00:48:30,298
YEAH, WELL,
I GUESS SO, BUT--

1140
00:48:30,342 --> 00:48:32,431
YOU SHOULDN'T
PUSH GIRLS AROUND, SIR.

1141
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:34,607
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THEY'RE PREGNANT, GUYS.

1142
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,435
YEAH, WELL,
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN MY BOY

1143
00:48:36,478 --> 00:48:38,567
JUMP RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE FRAY--

1144
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:39,612
BA-KOW! BAM!

1145
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:40,569
WOULD'VE TAKEN HIM, TOO,

1146
00:48:40,613 --> 00:48:44,182
IF RAND DIDN'T
COLD-COCK HIM.

1147
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:46,575
IT WAS NOTHING AT ALL.

1148
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:48,577
I ASSUME THERE WERE
WITNESSES.

1149
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:51,450
OH, YEAH.
THE WHOLE PARTY SAW IT.

1150
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:53,582
RAND HAD NO RIGHT
TO EMBARRASS YOU LIKE THAT

1151
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:54,540
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

1152
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:55,584
HE DIDN'T EMBARRASS ME.

1153
00:48:55,628 --> 00:48:57,630
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

1154
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,458
WELL, HE--HE LEFT.

1155
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:00,807
I MEAN, THAT'S
THE LAST I SAW HIM.

1156
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:04,419
YEAH, BUT YOU WENT RUNNING
RIGHT AFTER HIM TO--

1157
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:05,768
OH.

1158
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:07,814
FORGET SOMETHING?

1159
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:10,338
NO, NO. NOT REALLY.
I MEAN, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

1160
00:49:10,382 --> 00:49:11,774
I MEAN, I RAN AFTER HIM,
AND HE WAS GONE.

1161
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:14,212
LIKE I SAID, THE LAST TIME
I SAW HIM WAS AT THE PARTY.

1162
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:16,823
HOW SOON AFTER RAND LEFT
DID YOU GO AFTER HIM?

1163
00:49:16,866 --> 00:49:20,218
MY BOY WENT LOOKING
TO KICK SOME ASS.

1164
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:21,697
RIGHT AFTER.

1165
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:23,090
RIGHT AFTER?

1166
00:49:23,134 --> 00:49:24,918
BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM?

1167
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,094
WAS RAND ON THE TRACK TEAM?
HE JUST VANISHED?

1168
00:49:27,138 --> 00:49:30,619
MAYBE HE WAS ABDUCTED
BY SOME FUCKING ALIENS.

1169
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:32,447
OK, MAYBE IT WASN'T
RIGHT AFTER, BUT--

1170
00:49:32,491 --> 00:49:34,406
TIM, YOU WERE THERE.

1171
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:37,539
I MEAN, I PROBABLY TOOK
A MINUTE OR TWO

1172
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,193
TO MAKE SURE
NATALIE WAS OK.

1173
00:49:39,237 --> 00:49:40,716
WELL, WHICH WAS IT?
RIGHT AFTER?

1174
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,022
ONE MINUTE?
TWO MINUTES? WHAT?

1175
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:46,070
I--I DON'T--YOU KNOW,
IT WAS PROBABLY A MINUTE.

1176
00:49:46,418 --> 00:49:48,986
DID YOU GO UP
TO THE DELL THAT NIGHT?

1177
00:49:49,638 --> 00:49:50,813
NO. NO.

1178
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:52,554
YOU SURE?

1179
00:49:52,598 --> 00:49:56,558
YOU SEEM TO BE HAVING
A LAPSITATION OF MEMORY.

1180
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:04,610
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER THEM, BUDDY.

1181
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:05,741
EXCUSE ME?

1182
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:07,047
HEY, I DON'T MIND
TELLING THEM ANYTHING.

1183
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:09,049
HE HAS HIS RIGHTS.

1184
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:10,659
HE SHOULD HAVE
HIS LAWYER PRESENT.

1185
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:13,793
WELL, WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT...

1186
00:50:13,836 --> 00:50:15,534
COUNSELOR.

1187
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:20,582
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

1188
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:25,848
IS THIS NATALIE?

1189
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:27,850
THAT--THAT IS NATALIE
RIGHT TH--

1190
00:50:27,894 --> 00:50:29,461
I'M SORRY.
WHERE DO YOU...

1191
00:50:29,504 --> 00:50:30,679
WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT PICTURE?

1192
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:33,291
WE FISHED IT OUT OF
THE RIVER THIS MORNING.

1193
00:50:33,334 --> 00:50:35,684
IT WAS PROBABLY
ON YOUR BUDDY.

1194
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:38,687
Tim: HEY...

1195
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:39,906
THIS IS DONE, RIGHT?

1196
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:41,864
BUT I GOT TO GET ACROSS
CAMPUS FOR A CLASS.

1197
00:50:41,908 --> 00:50:44,128
YOU GUYS MIND JUST
POPPING ME OVER THERE?

1198
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:46,260
YEAH, SURE.
COME WITH US.

1199
00:51:05,236 --> 00:51:08,630
I'M REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT CHRIS.

1200
00:51:08,674 --> 00:51:10,023
WE ALL ARE.

1201
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,677
I MEAN...

1202
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,721
FIRST, THIS WHOLE THING

1203
00:51:12,765 --> 00:51:14,201
WITH GETTING WAIT-LISTED
AT HARVARD.

1204
00:51:14,245 --> 00:51:17,552
HE'S COMPLETELY
OBSESSIVE ABOUT IT.

1205
00:51:17,596 --> 00:51:20,555
AND NOW WITH RAND,
I MEAN...

1206
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:22,035
I REALLY WANT
TO HELP HIM THROUGH IT,

1207
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,646
BUT HE WON'T EVEN
TALK WITH ME ABOUT IT.

1208
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,778
WELL, AT LEAST
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY

1209
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:27,867
ABOUT THE WHOLE WAIT-LIST
THING ANYMORE.

1210
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:28,824
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1211
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:30,348
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

1212
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:31,697
TELL ME WHAT?

1213
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,959
ABOUT THE 4.0.

1214
00:51:33,002 --> 00:51:34,482
IF YOUR ROOMMATE
COMMITS SUICIDE,

1215
00:51:34,526 --> 00:51:38,182
YOU GET AN AUTOMATIC 4.0
FOR THE SEMESTER.

1216
00:51:38,225 --> 00:51:39,139
HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?

1217
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:40,793
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
JUST A MYTH.

1218
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:43,578
SO DID I, UNTIL
THEY OFFERED IT TO ME.

1219
00:51:43,622 --> 00:51:45,928
SO CHRIS TOOK IT?

1220
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:48,366
WOW. THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE HIM.

1221
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:51,978
DID HE EVER TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THIS WHOLE 4.0 THING BEFORE?

1222
00:51:52,021 --> 00:51:53,588
UH...

1223
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:55,329
I DON'T KNOW. HE MAY
HAVE MENTIONED IT

1224
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:57,418
A LONG TIME AGO.

1225
00:51:57,679 --> 00:51:59,464
BEFORE RAND KILLED HIMSELF?

1226
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:02,293
OK, IF HE DID
MENTION IT,

1227
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:04,556
HE WAS COMPLETELY
JOKING.

1228
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:06,427
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

1229
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:11,563
JUST--

1230
00:52:11,606 --> 00:52:12,738
JUST TRY AND FOLLOW ME
ON THIS, ALL RIGHT?

1231
00:52:12,781 --> 00:52:16,785
HIS WHOLE LIFE,
ALL CHRIS HAS EVER WANTED

1232
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:18,657
WAS TO GET INTO HARVARD.

1233
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,398
THEN, HIS GRADES,

01:08:27,712 --> 01:08:29,105
YOU MIND ME SMOKING?

1582
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:31,324
I'D RATHER YOU NOT.

1583
01:08:33,718 --> 01:08:35,546
DID CHRIS SEEM
SURPRISED,

1584
01:08:35,589 --> 01:08:37,113
SHOCKED?

1585
01:08:37,156 --> 01:08:38,288
NO.

1586
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:41,726
IT WAS MORE LIKE
HE WAS RESIGNED TO THE FACT.

1587
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:44,511
MAYBE LIKE
HE ALREADY KNEW IT?

1588
01:08:44,555 --> 01:08:46,513
HMM.

1589
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,559
MAYBE.

1590
01:09:00,919 --> 01:09:02,921
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

1591
01:09:02,964 --> 01:09:05,097
WALKING AROUND.

1592
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,578
HEY,
WHAT'S WITH THE GUN?

1593
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:09,188
WE NEED TO TALK.

1594
01:09:09,232 --> 01:09:11,147
NO, WE DON'T.
PUT DOWN THE GUN.

1595
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:11,930
THIS?

1596
01:09:11,973 --> 01:09:14,933
IT'S NOT LOADED.

1597
01:09:17,718 --> 01:09:20,460
I REALLY FUCKED UP,
CHRIS.

1598
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:22,549
I KNOW WHAT
YOU MUST BE THINKING.

1599
01:09:22,593 --> 01:09:24,595
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M THINKING.

1600
01:09:24,638 --> 01:09:25,639
I CAN EXPLAIN.

1601
01:09:25,683 --> 01:09:27,250
I CAN EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING.

1602
01:09:27,293 --> 01:09:30,818
REMEMBER THAT STORY
I TOLD YOU ABOUT RAND?

1603
01:09:30,862 --> 01:09:32,255
THE PROM, THE HOOKER?

1604
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:34,082
YEAH? SO?

1605
01:09:34,561 --> 01:09:36,259
IT WASN'T RAND.

1606
01:09:36,302 --> 01:09:38,174
IT WAS ME. I DID THAT.

1607
01:09:38,217 --> 01:09:40,219
BUT SEE,
WHAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU,

1608
01:09:40,263 --> 01:09:42,613
IS SHE CAME CRAWLING
BACK TO ME A WEEK LATER.

1609
01:09:42,656 --> 01:09:43,744
I WAS JUST TESTING HER.

1610
01:09:43,788 --> 01:09:45,485
I LIKE TO DO THAT.
I LIKE TO PUSH PEOPLE.

1611
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:47,313
SEE HOW MUCH
I CAN GET AWAY WITH

1612
01:09:47,357 --> 01:09:49,097
AND STILL HAVE THEM
WANT TO BE MY FRIEND.

1613
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:51,143
RAND WASYOUR FRIEND.

1614
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,450
I FUCKING HATED RAND.

1615
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:56,583
HE WAS MEAN
TO EVERYBODY.

1616
01:09:57,062 --> 01:09:59,630
YOU KNOW
HE ALWAYS HATED YOU.

1617
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:02,285
"SCHOLARSHIP BOY."

1618
01:10:02,328 --> 01:10:04,330
EVERYTHING WAS ALWAYS
HANDED TO RAND AND I.

1619
01:10:04,374 --> 01:10:06,811
WE HAD MONEY, DUDE.
WE HAD CASH.

1620
01:10:06,854 --> 01:10:08,508
CHICKS.

1621
01:10:08,552 --> 01:10:10,510
GRADES.

1622
01:10:10,815 --> 01:10:13,165
AND THEN YOU COME ALONG.

1623
01:10:13,557 --> 01:10:16,299
AND YOU DO
ALMOST AS WELL AS US,

1624
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:17,256
MAYBE EVEN BETTER,

1625
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,518
AND THAT
DROVE RAND CRAZY.

1626
01:10:18,562 --> 01:10:21,042
YOU COME FROM NOTHING
AND DO BETTER THAN US?

1627
01:10:21,086 --> 01:10:22,000
OH, MY GOD.

1628
01:10:22,043 --> 01:10:23,436
I DIDN'T CARE.

1629
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,351
I DIDN'T CARE.

1630
01:10:26,439 --> 01:10:28,267
HE USED TO JOKE
ALL THE TIME

1631
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:29,964
ABOUT HOW EASY
IT WOULD BE

1632
01:10:30,008 --> 01:10:31,488
TO GET YOU...

1633
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:33,751
TO KILL YOURSELF...

1634
01:10:33,794 --> 01:10:36,188
SO THAT 
HEWOULD GET A 4.0.

1635
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,451
SO THAT WE--HIM AND I...

1636
01:10:38,495 --> 01:10:40,148
WOULD BOTH GET 4.0.

1637
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:41,498
ISN'T IT IRONIC?

1638
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:43,064
DON'T YOU THINK?

1639
01:10:43,108 --> 01:10:44,718
A LITTLE?

1640
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,679
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
TRUSTED ANYBODY

1641
01:10:48,722 --> 01:10:50,724
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

1642
01:10:52,813 --> 01:10:54,946
I'M JUST A CASUALTY
OF THE UPPER CLASS,

1643
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:56,469
AND THEN THIS THING
COMES ALONG,

1644
01:10:56,513 --> 01:10:58,297
THAT COMPLETELY
AND TOTALLY RELIES

1645
01:10:58,341 --> 01:10:59,907
ON US TRUSTING
EACH OTHER.

1646
01:10:59,951 --> 01:11:01,300
AND YOU TRUST ME,

1647
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:02,519
AND I, DUDE,

1648
01:11:02,562 --> 01:11:05,173
I TOTALLY, COMPLETELY
GIVE YOU ALL MY TRUST.

1649
01:11:05,783 --> 01:11:08,438
I NEVER HAD ANYBODY
LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE.

1650
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:09,526
AND SEE THAT'S WHY--

1651
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:10,831
THAT'S WHY
I KEPT PUSHING YOU,

1652
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:14,705
AND YOU STUCK WITH ME
ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

1653
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:18,883
GOD.

1654
01:11:18,926 --> 01:11:22,713
I'VE NEVER HAD ANYBODY
LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE.

1655
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:25,585
WHY EMMA?

1656
01:11:28,936 --> 01:11:30,068
WELL...

1657
01:11:30,111 --> 01:11:32,723
I DIDN'T DO IT
TO HURT YOU.

1658
01:11:33,463 --> 01:11:35,508
DON'T YOU SEE?
IT WAS A TEST.

1659
01:11:35,552 --> 01:11:36,683
I MEAN, THAT, MAN,

1660
01:11:36,727 --> 01:11:38,468
WAS JUST THE FINAL TEST
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

1661
01:11:38,511 --> 01:11:41,122
YOU ARE REALLY SICK.

1662
01:11:43,473 --> 01:11:45,170
I KNOW.

1663
01:11:45,475 --> 01:11:46,606
I KNOW, AND I'M SORRY.

1664
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:50,741
SEE, I'VE NEVER HAD
A REAL FRIEND BEFORE.

1665
01:11:50,784 --> 01:11:53,613
WHY CAN'T I EVER BE HAPPY
WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE?

1666
01:11:53,657 --> 01:11:55,223
YOU KNOW WHY?
IT'S 'CAUSE OF MY DAD--

1667
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:56,355
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THIS.

1668
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:58,444
NO, NO, SEE,
I DON'T THINK...

1669
01:11:58,488 --> 01:12:01,578
YOU UNDERSTAND
THE SITUATION HERE!

1670
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:03,406
I--GOD! I'M TIRED.

1671
01:12:03,449 --> 01:12:05,495
I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE.

1672
01:12:05,538 --> 01:12:07,671
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

1673
01:12:07,714 --> 01:12:08,672
THERE'S
A SITUATION HERE.

1674
01:12:08,715 --> 01:12:11,631
THEY CAN'T FIND
RAND'S BODY!

1675
01:12:11,675 --> 01:12:13,590
GOD DAMN IT!

1676
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:15,766
YOU WANNA GO TO HARVARD?

1677
01:12:15,809 --> 01:12:17,550
YOU WANT A 4.0.

1678
01:12:17,594 --> 01:12:21,598
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A FUCKIN' 4-0.

1679
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,385
TIM.

1680
01:12:26,994 --> 01:12:29,649
GIVE ME THE GUN.

1681
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:41,922
IT'S OK.

1682
01:12:41,966 --> 01:12:44,360
IT'S OK.

1683
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:46,927
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS
TOGETHER.

1684
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:49,365
YOU KNOW, USED TO BE...

1685
01:12:49,408 --> 01:12:52,716
THAT ALL YOU NEEDED TO GET
A GOOD JOB IN THIS COUNTRY

1686
01:12:52,759 --> 01:12:55,109
WAS A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

1687
01:12:55,153 --> 01:12:56,197
NO, SIR.

1688
01:12:56,241 --> 01:12:58,939
THEN YOU HAD TO HAVE
A COLLEGE DEGREE.

1689
01:12:58,983 --> 01:13:00,419
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

1690
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:01,942
THEN IT WAS A MASTER'S.

1691
01:13:01,986 --> 01:13:05,293
HELL, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU CAN GET AFTER THAT.

1692
01:13:05,337 --> 01:13:07,165
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, FELLAS?

1693
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:09,428
I MEAN,
THE REALBOTTOM LINE--

1694
01:13:09,472 --> 01:13:13,171
WHAT THE LIBERAL MEDIA
WILL NOT TELL YOU.

1695
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:15,216
THE HUMAN BRAIN...

1696
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,522
WEIGHS THE SAME TODAY

1697
01:13:16,566 --> 01:13:20,700
AS IT DID 150 YEARS AGO.

1698
01:13:21,048 --> 01:13:23,355
MAKES YOU THINK, HUH?

1699
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:26,358
HERE'S OUR BOY.

1700
01:13:27,185 --> 01:13:29,535
Shipper:
HOW YOU DOING, MR. MASON?

1701
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:30,493
DETECTIVES.

1702
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:32,451
WHERE YOU GOING
IN SUCH A HURRY?

1703
01:13:32,495 --> 01:13:33,452
GOT FINALS TO GET TO.

1704
01:13:33,496 --> 01:13:35,585
WELL, IT CAN WAIT.
WE NEED TO TALK.

1705
01:13:35,628 --> 01:13:37,500
Amato: YOU WANNA TAKE
A RIDE IN THE CAR?

1706
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:39,327
WHAT, IN THIS?
NO, I'M FINE HERE.

1707
01:13:39,371 --> 01:13:41,504
I'LL BE HONEST,
CHRIS, ALL RIGHT?

1708
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:43,114
I THINK--
NO. CORRECTION.

1709
01:13:43,157 --> 01:13:46,160
I KNOWYOU HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH RAND'S DEATH.

1710
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:46,987
EXCUSE ME.

1711
01:13:47,031 --> 01:13:48,598
HAVE THEY FOUND
THE BODY?

1712
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:49,773
NO.

1713
01:13:49,816 --> 01:13:51,992
SO IT'S NOT A DEATH.
IT'S A MISSING PERSON.

1714
01:13:52,036 --> 01:13:53,472
Shipper:
WHY DID YOU TELL US

1715
01:13:53,516 --> 01:13:56,388
ALL THOSE DEPRESSING BOOKS,
VIDEOS, AND CDs WERE RAND'S?

1716
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,476
HEY, LISTEN TO ME,

1717
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,477
I GOT 3
STORE FUCKIN' CLERKS

1718
01:13:58,521 --> 01:13:59,957
SAYS YOU BOUGHT
THE MOTHERFUCKERS.

1719
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,567
WE GOT RECEIPTS,
ONE WITH YOUR BANK CARD.

1720
01:14:01,611 --> 01:14:03,613
NOW HOW DO YOU
EXPLAIN THAT?

1721
01:14:03,656 --> 01:14:04,483
HE'S CLEAN.

1722
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:05,484
TIM RAN OUT OF CASH,

1723
01:14:05,528 --> 01:14:07,268
AND HIS CREDIT CARD
GOT REJECTED,

1724
01:14:07,312 --> 01:14:08,661
SO I PAID
FOR EVERYTHING.

1725
01:14:08,705 --> 01:14:09,836
DO NOT LIE TO HIM.

1726
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,316
TIM RAN OUT OF CASH?

1727
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:13,449
HIS FATHER OWNS HALF THIS STATE.
GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK.

1728
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:14,362
HEY, IT'S THE TRUTH.

1729
01:14:14,406 --> 01:14:15,799
WHY DON'T YOU
GO QUESTION TIM?

1730
01:14:15,842 --> 01:14:17,235
WHAT ABOUT THE PARTY?

1731
01:14:17,278 --> 01:14:19,498
TIM SAID YOU RAN AFTER RAND
AND NO ONE SAW YOU AGAIN.

1732
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:20,543
HE WAS LYING.

1733
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:21,500
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THIS FRENCH GIRLIE?

1734
01:14:21,544 --> 01:14:23,154
SHE'S NOT FRENCH,
SHE'S CANADIAN.

1735
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:24,634
WHAT THE FUCK
IS THE DIFFERENCE?

1736
01:14:24,677 --> 01:14:26,505
SHE'S FRENCH CANADIAN.
WHAT DO I CARE?

1737
01:14:26,549 --> 01:14:27,941
SHE'S FROM TORONTO.

1738
01:14:27,985 --> 01:14:29,247
ALL YOUR FRIENDS SEEM LIKE
THEY'RE COMMITTING SUICIDE.

1739
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:31,118
I WOULD GET A LITTLE BIT
OF A COMPLEX WITH THAT.

1740
01:14:31,162 --> 01:14:32,511
WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH RAND'S BODY?

1741
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:34,905
DID YOU CUT HIM UP
INTO LITTLE FUCKING PIECES?

1742
01:14:34,948 --> 01:14:36,515
YOU SEE A SHRINK?

1743
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:37,429
HMM. AREN'T WE ALL?

1744
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:38,386
Ernie:
CUT HER UP?

1745
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:39,518
THAT SHRINK
MUST KNOW SOMETHING.

1746
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:41,433
OR MAYBE YOU FUCKING
CONFESSED TO HER.

1747
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,218
YOU'RE PRETTY SET ON GETTING
INTO HARVARD, AREN'T YOU?

1748
01:14:44,262 --> 01:14:45,524
WELL, IT HAS CROSSED
MY MIND.

1749
01:14:45,568 --> 01:14:47,091
WHY, ARE YOU
GENTLEMEN ALUMNI?

1750
01:14:47,134 --> 01:14:48,962
THAT'S REAL
FUCKIN' FUNNY, IDIOT.

1751
01:14:49,006 --> 01:14:50,137
DO YOU SMOKE?

1752
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:51,748
ARE YOU GUYS CONCERNED
ABOUT MY HEALTH NOW?

1753
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:53,619
YEAH, WELL, HEY,
