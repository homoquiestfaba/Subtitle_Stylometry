doesn't necessarily mean

How'd you know they were
plain clothes officers?

Detective McKenzie, rest
in peace, approached me.

496
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:06,454
Though they were
both asking for ID,

497
00:26:06,486 --> 00:26:09,123
Detective McKenzie
seemed overly aggressive

498
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:11,760
for it to be
identification check.

499
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:16,130
Then I spoke in
code to his partner

500
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:19,501
and I asked him if a call
had come in from central.

501
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:23,471
He glanced over at me as
if he knew the language.

502
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:27,041
That's when Detective
McKenzie remained stoic

503
00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:28,909
and things got confrontational.

504
00:26:28,943 --> 00:26:30,578
You said confrontational.

with stated to me verbatim

Detective Mackenzie must've felt

509
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:45,092
that he was directing his
frustration towards him.

510
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:49,631
That's when he stated
back to my friend,

511
00:26:49,664 --> 00:26:53,033
watch your fucking mouth
before I crack you in it.

512
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:54,903
I stated to him, you think
that badge grants you the merit

513
00:26:54,936 --> 00:26:57,839
to talk to people that way?

514
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:02,811
Detective McKenzie's
face remained aloof

515
00:27:02,843 --> 00:27:05,647
as if he had already
made his future decision.

516
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,585
While all of this is happening,
I'm still looking for my ID.

517
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:13,821
I tell him that it must be in
the truck across the street.

518
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:16,758
He glances over
it, but to no avail

519
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:20,595
did any of them
take the initiative

520
00:27:20,628 --> 00:27:24,866
to validate my reasoning for
the identification delay.

521
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:33,475
At that time his partner...

522
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:39,947
he notices my backup weapon
and he yells out gun.

523
00:27:41,815 --> 00:27:44,685
And I said to him, I'm a cop.

524
00:27:44,718 --> 00:27:47,855
Don't shoot. I'm a cop.
That's what I said.

525
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:53,261
Detective McKenzie
takes out his firearm

526
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:54,829
and he fires two shots at me.

527
00:27:54,861 --> 00:27:56,630
One hitting me in my body armor

528
00:27:56,664 --> 00:27:59,167
and the second one
penetrating in my hip.

529
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:03,270
I then returned fire
striking Detective McKenzie

530
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:05,974
while I'm on the ground.
Two shots.

00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:15,582

because you got a badge</i>

00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:44,144
<i>let's you talk to
people like that?</i>

540
00:28:44,177 --> 00:28:46,046
<i>Gives you the merit to
speak to people like that?</i>

CHRIS: <i>Don't
shoot, I'm a cop.</i>

543
00:28:48,949 --> 00:28:51,652
<i>That's what I said.
I'm a cop.</i>

SUSAN: Has anyone got
word back from Chris?

549
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:29,756
Today he went for
his I.A.D. interview.

550
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,225
Oh, that's right.

551
00:29:31,257 --> 00:29:33,126
Yeah, not today.
We spoke yesterday.

552
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:35,729
I said we'd all come
by to cheer him up.

553
00:29:35,763 --> 00:29:37,698
You gotta see how they're
rioting in different cities

554
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:39,667
'cause unarmed black
men are being killed.

555
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:41,602
Fucking crazy.

556
00:29:41,636 --> 00:29:43,071
It's scary because
there's so many good cops

557
00:29:43,103 --> 00:29:44,805
out here honoring the badge.

558
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,240
Yeah, it's true.

559
00:29:46,273 --> 00:29:47,975
It may sound crazy but
the good ones are looked

560
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:49,844
at even worse than the
ones abusing the badge

561
00:29:49,877 --> 00:29:52,180
and that's because
we turn an open eye

562
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:53,715
instead of doing
something about it.

563
00:29:53,747 --> 00:29:56,650
Look, don't get me wrong.

564
00:29:56,684 --> 00:29:58,853
Some of these perps
that we arrest,

565
00:29:58,886 --> 00:30:00,053
you wanna turn an open eye

566
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:01,656
and put your hands
and feet on them.

567
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:03,624
Yeah I would if I was
into that type of force.

568
00:30:03,657 --> 00:30:05,693
Those would be the ones that
are your rapist and molesters.

569
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:07,195
You don't kill them.

570
00:30:07,227 --> 00:30:08,763
That's true.

571
00:30:08,795 --> 00:30:11,765
You know, it's a
gift and a curse.

572
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:13,801
Hey, what time we
headed over to Chris'?

573
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,402
I need to get home
to prepare dinner.

574
00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:18,106

being that it's Friday.

00:30:24,177 --> 00:30:26,179
Oh my God, I still can't
believe what happened.

580
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:27,648
Yeah, it's bullshit.

581

not violate though.

- Straight up.
- Yo, man.

Listen, I don't agree with
half of this shit out here.

593
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,276
But I listen.

- What's popping, man?

Suave come home?

- Damn.
- Short.

604
00:31:12,926 --> 00:31:14,728
- Three?
- That's what it is.

605

Shit, he'll be home soon.

I know your ass was shook when
them shots ran out though.

607
00:31:19,867 --> 00:31:22,170
It take you to say
something like that, right?

608
00:31:22,203 --> 00:31:25,173

protect and serve me.

Ponder that before you answer
and bring me a real case.

You know they're talking about

627
00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:22,096
trying to bring charges
up against you, right?

628
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:23,898
Yeah, tell me about it.

629
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:27,234
My lawyer told me
something like that.

630
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:29,102
Also told me not
to worry about it.

631
00:32:29,136 --> 00:32:30,805
I don't get it.

today is a new day.

Is it?

your deepest sympathy

639

and made peace with God,

640
00:32:45,552 --> 00:32:48,523

that will eventually go away.

- Amen.
- Yeah, that's true.

642
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:54,094
So how did the
I.A.D. briefing go?

643
00:32:55,995 --> 00:32:57,799
Better than I anticipated.

644
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:00,200
Yeah, you know the
drill, you know.

645
00:33:00,234 --> 00:33:03,870
What happened before
the fatal shot?

646
00:33:03,904 --> 00:33:05,940
What they really
wanted to know was

647
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:08,109
at what point in time did
I state that I was a cop?

648
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:10,343
DETECTIVE: That's exactly
what they wanted to hear.

649
00:33:10,377 --> 00:33:12,413
Everything else was
circumstantial to the ears.

650
00:33:12,446 --> 00:33:13,981
CHRIS: You know it.

651
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:15,416
Yeah, I'm just happy you
wore your body armor.

652
00:33:15,448 --> 00:33:17,150
Yeah, well you're gonna have
to thank Jackie for that

653
00:33:17,184 --> 00:33:20,421
because she makes me wear it,
ugh, everywhere besides bed.

654
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:22,924
Damn right 'cause
you never know.

655
00:33:22,956 --> 00:33:26,026
Well, I'd say she just
proved a point, huh?

656
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,462
Enough said.

657
00:33:28,494 --> 00:33:30,298
It's just ridiculous
because you know,

658
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:34,534
we take this job with the
notion to protect people.

659
00:33:34,568 --> 00:33:37,238
Then we, as cops
have to come home

660
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:41,975
and hear our child ask us do
white cops hate black people.

661
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:43,477
CHRIS: It's crazy.

662
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,313
JACKIE: That's what she
said to us the other day.

663
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:46,848
- Are you serious?
- Man, now that hurts.

664
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,149
And what's sad is that
not every white cops

665
00:33:49,183 --> 00:33:50,251
have those hateful feelings.

666
00:33:50,283 --> 00:33:54,354
The moral of it all is that
we have a job to uphold,

667
00:33:54,388 --> 00:33:58,259
and before we go out there
and perform our duties,

668
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:00,360
get down on our knees and
you thank God for waking up.

669

00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:03,131
We kiss our loved ones.

671
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,533

at the end of the day

that we are gonna make it
home one way or another.

good to see you.

see you to the range?

Officer Peter McKenzie

774
00:40:18,672 --> 00:40:21,742
when we observed two
African American males

775
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:24,912
coming out of the bodega
on ninth and 40th Avenue,

776
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:28,915
who appeared to be
loud and disturbing.

777
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:30,818
At that point, we jumped
out of our unmarked cruiser

778
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:32,753
and approached the two men.

779
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,356
When you say
appeared to be loud,

780
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:39,759
can you amplify a little
more on what appeared means?

781
00:40:40,993 --> 00:40:43,963
Sure.
They were talking loud.

782
00:40:43,996 --> 00:40:45,965
At that point I started
performing a warrant check

783
00:40:45,998 --> 00:40:48,735

Officer McKenzie tried

784
00:40:48,768 --> 00:40:51,971

acting belligerent

786

and crazy and refused to
surrender his identification.

787
00:40:58,045 --> 00:41:00,813
And at that point I happened
to notice his firearm.

788

I alerted Peter and
we both drew our guns

789
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,018
and ordered Chris Jones
to lie on the ground.

790
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:07,421
At that point, it
looked like Chris Jones

791
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:08,955
was going for his
gun and that's when

792
00:41:08,989 --> 00:41:11,458

fired striking Jones.

that he was an officer?

No.

at no point in time,

797
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:31,911

state to the best

798

of your knowledge
that he was a cop?

observed Officer Chris Jones

performing a routine stop.

01:00:52,705 --> 01:00:54,139
Thank you, Mommy.

1240
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:58,176
Did you pack my money
in my bag for my trip?

1241
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,779
Yes, I have.

1242
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:02,114
You have badgered me about it

1243
01:01:02,147 --> 01:01:04,683
morning, noon
and night, little girl.

1244
01:01:04,717 --> 01:01:07,153
SABRINA: You're
the best, Mommy.

1245
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:08,620
Okay, and you're the
best seven year old.

1246
01:01:08,654 --> 01:01:10,223
Chris!

1247
01:01:13,259 --> 01:01:16,696
CHRIS: Hey baby, did
you see what I saw?

1248
01:01:16,728 --> 01:01:18,697
Who the hell is knocking
at the door like?

1249
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:20,600
JACKIE: Officers.

1250
01:01:20,632 --> 01:01:21,967
OFFICER: Hello.

1251
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,769
JACKIE: Wait, hey.
Chris.

1252
01:01:24,802 --> 01:01:27,639
CHRIS: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold up. Come here, baby.

1253
01:01:27,672 --> 01:01:28,940
What's the problem?

1254
01:01:28,973 --> 01:01:31,776
Good morning.
My name is Detective Jack Mullen

1255
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,645
and this is my partner
Detective Keith Edwards.

1256
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:36,115
No, I didn't ask you your names.
I asked you why you're here.

1257
01:01:36,147 --> 01:01:38,617
I'm sorry, but we
don't make the rules.

1258
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:40,719
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

1259
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:42,721
Respect you as one of us.

1260
01:01:42,755 --> 01:01:44,724
With that being said.

1261
01:01:44,757 --> 01:01:46,259
We won't treat you any
less than your rank

1262
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:50,061
and we won't handcuff you.

1263
01:01:50,094 --> 01:01:53,565
What is Detective Chris
Jones being charged for?

1264
01:01:53,598 --> 01:01:55,301
We don't know. Our orders were
only to bring him in.

1265
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:56,668
That's all we know, Sargent.

1266
01:01:56,701 --> 01:01:57,837
That's all you know?

1267
01:01:57,869 --> 01:01:59,739
(SCOFFS) This is some bullshit.

1268
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,743
This... this is ridiculous.

1269
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,110
Hey, hey, shh.

1270
01:02:05,143 --> 01:02:06,712
It's okay.

1271
01:02:06,744 --> 01:02:08,681
Don't you worry.
Look.

1272
01:02:08,714 --> 01:02:10,650
Hey, don't you worry.

1273
01:02:10,683 --> 01:02:12,585
You know what to do.

1274
01:02:13,217 --> 01:02:15,788
Don't touch me, man.

1275
01:02:20,793 --> 01:02:23,029
Yo, how you feel about
that situation, Jay?

1276
01:02:23,061 --> 01:02:24,764
What they trying to give
you some stupid ass payout

1277
01:02:24,797 --> 01:02:26,732
for some mental
anguish or something?

1278
01:02:26,764 --> 01:02:28,000
Yeah, I wish.

1279
01:02:28,032 --> 01:02:31,103
Look, all he worried about is
me never missing a day's work.

1280
01:02:31,136 --> 01:02:33,005
Yo, you know what my boss
had the nerve to say to me

1281
01:02:33,038 --> 01:02:34,206
the other day?

1282
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,975
Watch the people
you keep around you

1283
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:37,776
because if you miss
another day at work,

1284
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:40,279
I'ma have to find
somebody to replace you.

1285
01:02:40,311 --> 01:02:42,848
Typical plantation talk, see.

1286
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,551
I hate that cracker.
Word to my mother.

1287
01:02:45,217 --> 01:02:46,919
It ain't all what it seems.

1288
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:48,186
Read the newspaper.

1289
01:02:48,219 --> 01:02:50,255
What the fuck he talking
about read the newspaper?

1290
01:02:50,288 --> 01:02:52,223
Everybody know that
they lock Chris up

1291
01:02:52,257 --> 01:02:54,927
for killing that devil.

1292
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,862
Could they even do that?
Ain't he a police officer?

1293
01:02:56,895 --> 01:02:58,163
JUSTICE: Easy.
Just do it.

1294
01:02:58,197 --> 01:02:59,298
Exactly.

1295
01:02:59,331 --> 01:03:01,299
Shit ain't gonna be real to them
until we start murdering

1296
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:03,269
these motherfucking
crackers, man.

1297
01:03:03,302 --> 01:03:05,838
Start shooting them
unarmed white kids.

1298
01:03:05,871 --> 01:03:08,741
Yeah, you ain't never lie.
Them some wicked folks.

1299
01:03:08,773 --> 01:03:11,643
Yeah, I was looking at this
Farrakhan video last night.

1300
01:03:11,677 --> 01:03:13,946
Like basically he went on to say

1301
01:03:13,978 --> 01:03:16,748
how if the legal justice
system fucked up,

1302
01:03:16,781 --> 01:03:18,984
the next step is to
result in violence.

1303
01:03:19,018 --> 01:03:20,753
Listen.

1304
01:03:20,786 --> 01:03:23,222
I don't never agree
with nothing he say,

1305
01:03:23,255 --> 01:03:24,924
but I can honestly say

1306
01:03:24,956 --> 01:03:27,359
I definitely agree
with this one right here.

1307
01:03:27,393 --> 01:03:28,828
I fucks with Farrakhan, man.

1308
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:29,862
- Fuck that.
- Yeah word.

1309
01:03:29,895 --> 01:03:31,096
Before I got my flag, I
had knowledge of self.

1310
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:33,833
He was always dropping bombs
about racism and them devils,

1311
01:03:33,866 --> 01:03:37,670
but then when his man
Khalid Muhammad got smoked

1312
01:03:37,703 --> 01:03:40,373
and he didn't respond, that's
when I fell back on him.

1313
01:03:40,406 --> 01:03:43,342
Yeah, I heard about
that with Khalid.

1314
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:45,744
I fucked with Khalid,
but that's like me

1315
01:03:45,777 --> 01:03:47,779
not riding out for
the peoples, man.

1316
01:03:47,813 --> 01:03:49,415
Never would I do that.

1317
01:03:49,447 --> 01:03:50,850
JUSTICE: All right,
cuz, you see?

1318
01:03:50,882 --> 01:03:52,717
(MAN WHISTLING)

1319
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,019
What up, cuz?

1320
01:03:54,052 --> 01:03:55,654
JUSTICE: What up, OG?
BLUE: What's happening?

1321
01:03:55,688 --> 01:03:57,390
- DU: Cuz, what's up?
- What's happening?

1322
01:03:57,422 --> 01:03:59,125
Justice, let me holla
at you right quick.

1323
01:03:59,157 --> 01:04:00,659
Come on, let's talk about it.

1324
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,170
Oh, boy.

1325
01:04:17,775 --> 01:04:18,978
KIMBERLY: Daddy.

1326
01:04:19,011 --> 01:04:22,380
Hey, princess.
Woo, how was your day?

1327
01:04:22,413 --> 01:04:23,948
Good.

1328
01:04:23,982 --> 01:04:25,750
Mommy made a surprise for you.

1329
01:04:25,784 --> 01:04:27,386
She did?

1330
01:04:27,418 --> 01:04:31,891
Yup, but you have to promise me
you won't tell her I told you.

1331
01:04:31,924 --> 01:04:33,192
Oh, I don't know.

1332
01:04:33,225 --> 01:04:34,893
You know, we don't keep
secrets around here.

1333
01:04:34,927 --> 01:04:36,696
You know that.

1334
01:04:36,728 --> 01:04:38,763
Aw.

1335
01:04:38,797 --> 01:04:41,233
Okay, you can tell me.
What is it?

1336
01:04:41,266 --> 01:04:42,368
KIMBERLY: Red velvet cake.

1337
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,036
What?

1338
01:04:44,069 --> 01:04:45,804
My favorite.

1339
01:04:45,837 --> 01:04:48,773
Kimberly, where are you?

1340
01:04:48,806 --> 01:04:50,909
I should have known
when she disappeared.

1341
01:04:50,942 --> 01:04:53,745
- Hey baby. How was your day?
- Hi.

1342
01:04:53,779 --> 01:04:55,014
Interesting.

1343
01:04:55,047 --> 01:04:56,115
All right, well get cleaned up.

1344
01:04:56,147 --> 01:04:57,882
Dinner is ready.

1345
01:04:57,915 --> 01:05:00,452
Okay, I'm hungry.
Papa's hungry.

1346
01:05:00,485 --> 01:05:01,821
Oh, and another thing.

1347
01:05:01,853 --> 01:05:03,089
Yeah?

1348
01:05:03,121 --> 01:05:04,924
I'll just tell you at the table.

1349
01:05:04,956 --> 01:05:06,391
Oh, okay.

1350
01:05:06,424 --> 01:05:08,993
Kimberly, come.
Help me set the table, okay?

1351
01:05:09,027 --> 01:05:10,128
KIMBERLY: Okay.

1352
01:05:10,161 --> 01:05:11,263
WIFE: Okay.

1353
01:05:20,105 --> 01:05:22,275
Oh, man.

1354
01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:40,192
You didn't tell your father
what we made for him, did you?

1355
01:05:40,225 --> 01:05:41,927
Huh?

1356
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:44,295
Kimberly?

1357
01:05:44,328 --> 01:05:47,365
I tried to keep it a
secret, but it's hard.

1358
01:05:47,398 --> 01:05:49,502
Daddy gets everything out of me.

1359
01:05:49,534 --> 01:05:51,971
Your father is your
kryptonite to Superman.

1360
01:05:52,003 --> 01:05:53,772
What's that?

1361
01:05:53,806 --> 01:05:55,307
What's that?

(SING SONG) That's I love you!

1363
01:06:00,846 --> 01:06:03,081
All right, before we can eat,
it's your turn to say grace.

1364
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:05,284
Okay.

1365
01:06:06,819 --> 01:06:09,522
Thank you, God, for this
good food Mommy cooked.

1366
01:06:09,554 --> 01:06:11,991
Oh, and the red
velvet cake for Daddy.

1367
01:06:12,023 --> 01:06:16,228
Yaaay!
Oh boy, this looks delicious.

cut my chicken?

WIFE: Sure, just
pass your plate.

1372
01:06:23,435 --> 01:06:25,571
I'm not the cupcake.
You're the cupcake.

women in the whole world.

you wanna tell me?

I have nothing to say.

1380
01:06:52,364 --> 01:06:55,367
I just wanna ask you
how you're feeling.

1381
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,069
It seems like you have
a lot on your mind.

1382
01:06:57,101 --> 01:06:58,436
Yeah.

1383
01:06:58,469 --> 01:07:00,473
I can tell this guy
thinks I'm against him.

1384
01:07:01,473 --> 01:07:03,509
Try not to let it worry you.

1385
01:07:03,542 --> 01:07:06,277
Like you always say to me.
You have your strategy.

1386
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:08,479
Mm-hm. But I think in this case,

1387
01:07:08,513 --> 01:07:11,951
it flares up some
extenuating circumstances.

01:07:17,188 --> 01:07:19,891
You know, at no point
in the interview

1391
01:07:19,924 --> 01:07:25,196
did Officer Mitchell refer to
Detective Jones as an officer.

1392
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:27,565
And two he never
discharged his weapon.

1393
01:07:27,598 --> 01:07:29,534
Why wouldn't he
discharge his weapon?

1394

I don't know what to tell
you when it comes to that.

1395

Yeah, selective memory.

1396
01:07:36,241 --> 01:07:38,277
A lot of these young
cops are never screened

1397
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:40,112
for mental evaluation.

1398
01:07:40,145 --> 01:07:41,647
They've been bullied as kids

1399
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:43,882
or they're just
fucking closet racist.

1400
01:07:44,949 --> 01:07:46,918

01:15:52,603 --> 01:15:54,673
So the blood sample
is from a human,

1586
01:15:54,705 --> 01:15:56,641
not an animal, corrrect?

1587
01:15:56,673 --> 01:15:58,910
That is correct.

1588
01:16:04,548 --> 01:16:05,417
The only problem is

1589
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:08,086
that person's name
isn't in our system.

That is correct.

1591
01:16:11,655 --> 01:16:12,923
Do me a favor.

1592
01:16:12,956 --> 01:16:16,061
Have it run through
an NCIC check.

1593
01:16:16,093 --> 01:16:17,428
Something might come up.

1594
01:16:17,462 --> 01:16:18,763
Got it.

1595
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:28,807
You didn't think I fucking had
it like that you cocksucker.

1596
01:16:28,839 --> 01:16:30,542
You got this one, partner.
I'll see you outside.

1597
01:16:30,575 --> 01:16:31,610

Yeah, don't worry.

01:17:02,574 --> 01:17:04,109
Appreciate it.

1602

Got you now, fuck boy.

1605
01:17:15,186 --> 01:17:16,755
Fuck you.

a fucking child.

01:17:27,699 --> 01:17:29,500
- Get the fuck out.

JOHN: Fucking take
a piss every five minutes.

1610
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:34,638
Yeah, just leave
my door open.

1611
01:17:34,672 --> 01:17:36,008
Fucking jerk off.

Oh.

1616
01:17:46,884 --> 01:17:48,786
Oh, fuck.

1617
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,088

- All right, man.

1618
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:50,989

JOSH: Maybe if we
didn't fucking day drink,

1620
01:17:54,292 --> 01:17:55,994
I wouldn't have to piss so bad.

1622
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:01,098
Look at this, you

01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:02,834
JOSH: Just relax.

1624
01:18:02,868 --> 01:18:04,236
Look, I'm just gonna tell
him my brother's a cop

got in the fucking back.

1631
01:18:13,945 --> 01:18:15,280
What you got?

1632
01:18:15,312 --> 01:18:17,748
It looks like we're having
a little party here.

1633
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:19,650
JOHN: I was telling him
that we gotta get back

1634
01:18:19,683 --> 01:18:21,119
to the house
for my mother's dinner.

1635
01:18:21,151 --> 01:18:22,686

Let me see some ID,

on the sidewalk.

1638

You see a sign that says fucking
bathroom on the wall?

Oh no, Officer,
I'm so sorry, man.

1640
01:18:31,929 --> 01:18:33,063
My brother.

1641
01:18:33,097 --> 01:18:34,666
My brother's a police officer.

What's your brother's name?

01:18:36,935 --> 01:18:38,102
Kevin McKenzie.

1644
01:18:40,271 --> 01:18:42,706
As in Detective McKenzie,
brother to Peter?

1645
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:44,643
Yes, sir.

1646
01:18:44,676 --> 01:18:46,044
I'm sorry for your loss.

1647
01:18:46,076 --> 01:18:47,745
Peter was a friend.

1648
01:18:47,779 --> 01:18:50,014
- That was hard news.
- JOSH: Yeah.

1649
01:18:50,048 --> 01:18:52,751
All right, so,
so can we go now?

1650
01:18:52,784 --> 01:18:54,052
OFFICER: All right,
here's what we can do.

1651
01:18:54,084 --> 01:18:55,753
If there's nothing
in the car

1652
01:18:55,786 --> 01:18:58,557
and your identifications
come back clear,

1653
01:18:58,589 --> 01:18:59,790
this never happened,
okay?

1654
01:19:00,691 --> 01:19:01,825
Okay, cool.

1655
01:19:01,859 --> 01:19:03,594
No, no, why can't
we just go now?

1656
01:19:03,628 --> 01:19:04,663
We're already
running late.

1657
01:19:04,695 --> 01:19:05,963
It's still procedure.

1658
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:06,932

Step out of the car.

1659

sympathize with your loss.

Come on, man.

1667
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:08,259
DETECTIVE: It's being printed.

1668
01:20:08,293 --> 01:20:10,061
All right, do me a favor.
Take Detective McKenzie

1669
01:20:10,093 --> 01:20:11,362
over to see Officer Fuller.

1670
01:20:11,396 --> 01:20:12,931
All right.

1671
01:20:12,963 --> 01:20:14,732
Detective, sorry for your loss.

1672
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:16,034
Your brother and I
were good friends.

1673
01:20:16,968 --> 01:20:18,837
Thank you.
Appreciate that.

1674
01:20:19,904 --> 01:20:22,107
What's Josh
being charged with?

1675
01:20:22,139 --> 01:20:24,976
Right now we didn't
put him through.

1676
01:20:25,008 --> 01:20:28,045
All in good faith
because you're his brother.

1677
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:30,215
They found two guns
in the back of a car

1678
01:20:30,248 --> 01:20:32,717
owned by a guy named
John Macintosh.

1679
01:20:32,749 --> 01:20:34,785
The car isn't under
your brother's name.

1680
01:20:35,719 --> 01:20:37,222
You see where I'm
going with this?

1681
01:20:37,254 --> 01:20:39,824
I see. Where's John
being held now?

1682
01:20:39,856 --> 01:20:41,158
John took a run
for it at the scene.

1683
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:42,793
He got away.

1684
01:20:43,695 --> 01:20:44,728
Okay.

1685
01:20:44,762 --> 01:20:45,897
Thank you.

1686
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:47,132
Can I get a minute
with him?

1687
01:20:48,165 --> 01:20:49,433
Sure. Take your time.

1688
01:20:49,467 --> 01:20:50,902

joking with you?

I really didn't know there were
any guns in the car.

believe this.

01:24:24,315 --> 01:24:26,084
Is that that nigga Du breaking
the truce, my nigga?

1759
01:24:26,116 --> 01:24:27,150
What's up?

1760
01:24:27,183 --> 01:24:28,319
Yo, yo, I'm hit, my nigga.

1761
01:24:28,352 --> 01:24:29,554
Yo. Yo!

1762
01:24:29,587 --> 01:24:31,089
- Ah.
- TRIGGER: Get him out of here.

1763
01:24:31,121 --> 01:24:32,356
Get him out of here.

01:24:38,228 --> 01:24:40,664
Oh, oh, oh.
Put that fucking gun down.

1766
01:24:40,697 --> 01:24:42,234
Put that gun down.

You wanna tell me something?

No.

1775
01:25:35,753 --> 01:25:38,089
I think you're a lying scumbag.

1776
01:25:38,121 --> 01:25:40,057
The fuck you talking about?

1777
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:42,694
You can tell me now or you
can tell the judge later.

1778
01:25:42,727 --> 01:25:44,529
All right listen, I already
fucking told you everything.

1779
01:25:44,562 --> 01:25:46,030
- Okay?
- You don't fucking tell me now,

1780
01:25:46,062 --> 01:25:47,665
you'll never see your
wife and son again.

1781
01:25:49,499 --> 01:25:52,102
You know, fuck you
and fuck that nigger cop.

1782
01:25:52,736 --> 01:25:54,137
Listen.

1783
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:55,472
Listen, Mitchell.

1784
01:25:55,505 --> 01:25:57,307
You tell me what
the fuck happened

1785
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:59,311
on the night of June 16th.

1786
01:25:59,744 --> 01:26:01,045
Tell me.

1787
01:26:01,078 --> 01:26:02,612
I already fucking
told you everything.

1788
01:26:02,646 --> 01:26:04,316
I said tell me.

1789
01:26:13,523 --> 01:26:15,426
Weak, man.

1790
01:26:15,459 --> 01:26:17,462
Yo, take care of
yourself out there today.

1791
01:26:17,495 --> 01:26:20,098
CAPTAIN: Detective, can
I talk to you for a sec?

1792
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:21,699
Hey, Cap.

1793
01:26:21,731 --> 01:26:22,732
Of course.

1794
01:26:26,603 --> 01:26:29,106
I'm sure you already know
about the big commotion

1795
01:26:29,139 --> 01:26:31,109
that took place in
your old neighborhood

1796
01:26:31,142 --> 01:26:34,078
between 110th precinct
and the two rebel gangs.

1797
01:26:34,111 --> 01:26:35,613
The bloods and the crips.

1798
01:26:35,646 --> 01:26:37,549
Yeah, I see where
this is going, Cap.

1799
01:26:39,549 --> 01:26:41,386
To make a long story short.

1800
01:26:41,419 --> 01:26:43,421
I just got off the
phone with the 110th

1801
01:26:44,454 --> 01:26:46,023
and they're asking for your help

1802
01:26:46,057 --> 01:26:47,592
in retrieving the
radio that was taken

1803
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:50,160
during that big incident
between them and the two gangs.

1804
01:26:52,295 --> 01:26:54,598
Cap, what makes them think
that I could get it back?

1805
01:26:54,632 --> 01:26:56,467
That's not what they're saying.

1806
01:26:56,499 --> 01:26:58,602
It's only a request
with a strong hope

1807
01:26:58,636 --> 01:27:02,673
that you'll be able to make
that radio materialize for them.

1808
01:27:04,374 --> 01:27:06,209
You puttin' me at
great risk, Cap,

1809
01:27:06,243 --> 01:27:08,612
but if that's what you're
asking me to do then...

1810
01:27:08,646 --> 01:27:10,581
I mean, technically I've
been relieved of my duties.

1811
01:27:10,614 --> 01:27:12,417
I'm supposed to be on
desk duty right now.

1812
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:14,519
I explained that to them.

1813
01:27:14,552 --> 01:27:16,154
That's one.

1814
01:27:16,187 --> 01:27:19,791
And two I would never compromise
nor negotiate your safety.

1815
01:27:19,824 --> 01:27:21,793
You know that.

1816
01:27:21,825 --> 01:27:26,130
This is again, it's a
request all in good faith.

1817
01:27:28,465 --> 01:27:31,334
All right, Cap.

1818
01:27:31,368 --> 01:27:33,571
If that's what you
want me to do then...

1819
01:27:34,672 --> 01:27:35,839
I'm good.

1820
01:27:35,873 --> 01:27:37,808
- Can I go now?
- Yes.

1821
01:27:37,842 --> 01:27:39,110
No.

1822
01:27:42,213 --> 01:27:46,117
Never let the sickness
like race or religion

1823
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:50,154
of another man's mind be
your crutch for deviating

1824
01:27:50,187 --> 01:27:53,625
from the moral obligation
you still hold to that badge.

1825
01:27:55,558 --> 01:27:57,829
We all took an oath.

1826
01:27:57,861 --> 01:28:00,464
We all share.

1827
01:28:00,498 --> 01:28:04,134
Now I don't agree
with a lot of politics

1828
01:28:04,168 --> 01:28:07,072
or policies that
our badge protects,

1829
01:28:07,804 --> 01:28:09,440
but I don't make the rules.

1830
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,442
I just follow them.

1831
01:28:15,478 --> 01:28:17,081
You got it, Cap.

1832
01:28:17,615 --> 01:28:19,684
You got it.

1833
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,709
ASH: How you holding up?

1834
01:28:45,743 --> 01:28:48,212
Good, Ash.

1835
01:28:48,245 --> 01:28:49,781
I'm okay.
Seen better days.

1836
01:28:51,182 --> 01:28:52,350
How's mom?

1837
01:28:53,183 --> 01:28:54,284
I miss you so much.

1838
01:28:54,317 --> 01:28:56,320
KENNY: Come on, Ash.
Don't cry.

1839
01:28:56,352 --> 01:28:57,788
You gon' make me cry.

1840
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:59,789
I'm sorry.

1841
01:28:59,822 --> 01:29:01,426
Ma's fine.

1842
01:29:02,426 --> 01:29:04,395
Cries a lot.

1843
01:29:04,428 --> 01:29:06,664
We saw you on the news
and she just broke down.

1844
01:29:10,366 --> 01:29:13,236
Had to do what I did.

1845
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:16,206
Couldn't keep coming home
looking Ma in the face

1846
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:19,644
and just not doing
anything about it.

1847
01:29:19,677 --> 01:29:21,746
Then on top of that them
cops is sitting there

1848
01:29:21,779 --> 01:29:24,715
laughing at us like
they making fun of us.

1849
01:29:25,982 --> 01:29:27,584
I'm not mad at all.

1850
01:29:28,552 --> 01:29:29,687
I just wish it could've happened

1851
01:29:29,719 --> 01:29:31,422
where you didn't get caught.

1852
01:29:31,454 --> 01:29:33,256
Honestly, once I
made peace with God,

1853
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:34,859
getting caught was the
least of my worries.

1854
01:29:37,393 --> 01:29:38,929
I'm okay.

1855
01:29:40,396 --> 01:29:42,600
I miss Michael, but I ain't
want him to die in vain.

1856
01:29:42,633 --> 01:29:43,935
You know?

1857
01:29:46,236 --> 01:29:48,371
Hey, remember when
we was younger

1858
01:29:48,405 --> 01:29:50,741
and we would go to Nana's house?

1859
01:29:50,773 --> 01:29:52,243
She'll make that chocolate cake

1860
01:29:52,276 --> 01:29:54,212
and let us mix the
icing off the blender.

1861
01:29:54,245 --> 01:29:55,580
You remember that?

1862
01:29:55,612 --> 01:29:57,447
I remember.

1863
01:29:57,481 --> 01:29:59,317
You and Michael
used to fight over

1864
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:03,721
who would get the bowl
and Nana would give it to me

1865
01:30:03,754 --> 01:30:07,759
to be fair by not giving
it to neither of you.

1866
01:30:08,825 --> 01:30:09,960
Only if you knew
that I used to start

1867
01:30:09,994 --> 01:30:12,230
with Michael on purpose
'cause you was the little one

1868
01:30:12,262 --> 01:30:14,397
so you would never
beat us to the punch.

1869
01:30:14,431 --> 01:30:16,267
For real?

1870
01:30:16,299 --> 01:30:17,534
Yeah, for real.

1871
01:30:19,535 --> 01:30:21,004
OFFICER: Visit's over.

1872
01:30:21,038 --> 01:30:22,639
- Don't go. Not yet.
- KENNY: I have to.

1873
01:30:22,673 --> 01:30:24,942
I have to, Ash, all right,
but kiss Mommy for me.

1874
01:30:24,975 --> 01:30:26,677
Tell her I love her, okay.

1875
01:30:26,709 --> 01:30:27,944
- They can't break me.
- ASH: I love you.

1876
01:30:27,977 --> 01:30:29,312
All right, I'mma be all right.

1877
01:30:29,346 --> 01:30:30,380
ASH: Please don't
hurt my brother.

1878
01:30:30,414 --> 01:30:31,449
I love you.

1879
01:30:31,481 --> 01:30:32,515
I love you, Ashley.

1880
01:30:32,548 --> 01:30:33,584
Remember that.

1881
01:30:46,629 --> 01:30:48,565
I'm only doing this
'cause of you, Blue.

1882
01:30:48,598 --> 01:30:50,368
This better not be no bullshit.

1883
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:52,570
I got you, C.

1884
01:31:09,352 --> 01:31:10,754
Check this out, my nigga.

1885
01:31:11,754 --> 01:31:12,856
I don't talk to police.

1886
01:31:12,889 --> 01:31:15,392
I don't fuck with police.

1887
01:31:15,426 --> 01:31:17,895
Only reason I'm doing this
is 'cause you from the hood.

1888
01:31:17,928 --> 01:31:20,531
Niggas say you 100
so speak on it.

1889
01:31:21,831 --> 01:31:23,366
Now Croft, I appreciate
you taking out

1890
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,303
the time to meet with me.

1891
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:29,806
Now there was an incident
that allegedly occurred

1892
01:31:30,907 --> 01:31:32,509
between the crips
and two detectives

1893
01:31:32,543 --> 01:31:34,011
from the 12th precinct,

1894
01:31:34,044 --> 01:31:36,480
which led to a man being shot

1895
01:31:36,512 --> 01:31:38,782
and a police radio being taken.

1896
01:31:40,817 --> 01:31:42,852
What this shit's about a radio?

1897
01:31:42,886 --> 01:31:43,920
A motherfucking radio?

1898
01:31:43,954 --> 01:31:46,291
What, somebody told you
I was there or some shit?

1899
01:31:46,589 --> 01:31:47,624
Hey.

1900
01:31:47,657 --> 01:31:49,627
Is this a set up
or some bullshit?

1901
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:51,329
- What's going on?
- Hold up, I'm alone.

1902
01:31:51,361 --> 01:31:53,364
- I'm alone.
- Yeah cuz, what I don't get

1903
01:31:53,396 --> 01:31:54,431
is why the fuck you worried

1904
01:31:54,464 --> 01:31:56,433
about them cracker's
radio so much?

1905
01:31:56,467 --> 01:31:58,969
Aren't they trying to
send you to prison?

1906
01:31:59,002 --> 01:32:02,740
You know, I asked myself
the same question.

1907
01:32:02,772 --> 01:32:04,874
Why the fuck am I standing with
these people in the battle,

1908
01:32:04,907 --> 01:32:06,643
but I'm alone in the war?

1909
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:09,446
And you're right.

1910
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:10,682
You're fucking right.

1911
01:32:13,917 --> 01:32:17,321
It's 'cause I took an
oath as you both did.

1912
01:32:18,554 --> 01:32:20,391
Now we may not agree
with all the things

1913
01:32:20,423 --> 01:32:22,493
that happened under that color,

1914
01:32:22,526 --> 01:32:25,096
but we still find a
way to protect it,

1915
01:32:25,129 --> 01:32:28,999
which means having a truce
with them red ghost bloods.

1916
01:32:29,031 --> 01:32:31,002
That's to help
things along the way.

1917
01:32:33,102 --> 01:32:34,838
We do what we gotta.

1918
01:32:37,106 --> 01:32:40,543
I need your help.

1919
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:44,348
Either I come and get it or
they gonna come and get it

1920
01:32:45,581 --> 01:32:47,084
and you and I both
know only two things

1921
01:32:47,116 --> 01:32:49,820
are gonna happen if they come.

1922
01:32:49,852 --> 01:32:51,788
That's injustice and injustice.

1923
01:32:51,821 --> 01:32:54,991
Neither's good for business
or for the community.

1924
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,995
Check this out, my nigga.

1925
01:33:00,463 --> 01:33:03,100
I believe you give
respect, you get respect.

1926
01:33:04,802 --> 01:33:07,804
You had a lot of balls coming
here just fucking with me.

1927
01:33:08,905 --> 01:33:10,507
So I'm gonna do what I can do.

1928
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:12,075
I put that on the set.

1929
01:33:13,776 --> 01:33:15,645
Like I said.

1930
01:33:15,678 --> 01:33:17,882
Thank you for taking the
time out to meet with me.

1931
01:33:19,215 --> 01:33:20,517
Yeah.

1932
01:33:20,918 --> 01:33:22,520
I think we done.

1933
01:33:22,553 --> 01:33:23,788
Keep moving.

1934
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:39,536
What you think, Croft?

1935
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:41,038
Fuck the police, man.

1936
01:33:41,838 --> 01:33:43,540
Fuck 'em.

1937
01:33:50,813 --> 01:33:52,650
I want you to listen to this.

1938
01:33:52,682 --> 01:33:55,084
Check this out.

1939
01:33:55,118 --> 01:33:56,853
DAVID: I had an idea
that he was a cop

1940
01:33:56,887 --> 01:33:59,924
once he asked us
why did you stop us

1941
01:33:59,956 --> 01:34:03,828
and did a call come
in from central.

1942
01:34:03,861 --> 01:34:05,663
He said he was a
cop the whole time.

1943
01:34:05,695 --> 01:34:08,565
Wanted to go get his wallet
from a jeep across the street.

1944
01:34:12,669 --> 01:34:14,505
Mind fucker, huh?

1945
01:34:14,538 --> 01:34:16,139
Got that scumbag.

1946
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:18,441
LAWYER: You heard it.

1947
01:34:18,476 --> 01:34:20,811
I'm demanding a dismissal
and for my client

1948
01:34:20,843 --> 01:34:23,614
to be placed on full, active
duty effective immediately.

1949
01:34:25,715 --> 01:34:28,052
LAWYER: All charges
are hereby dropped

1950
01:34:28,084 --> 01:34:29,953
and you are placed back
on full active duty

1951
01:34:29,986 --> 01:34:32,556
as a detective
effective immediately.

1952
01:34:36,759 --> 01:34:38,695
CHRIS: Hey, thank you
for being there for me.

1953
01:34:38,728 --> 01:34:40,164
I'm trying.

1954
01:34:48,137 --> 01:34:50,607
Detective Jones, are you
planning on filing a defamation

1955
01:34:50,641 --> 01:34:52,276
of character lawsuit
against the city?

1956
01:34:52,308 --> 01:34:54,210
No comment at this time.

1957
01:34:54,244 --> 01:34:55,779
Thank you.

1958
01:34:55,812 --> 01:34:58,149
What, if anything, did you
learn from all of this?

1959
01:34:59,749 --> 01:35:00,950
Say something.

1960
01:35:00,984 --> 01:35:02,219
I can't.

1961
01:35:03,553 --> 01:35:06,523
You know, I really
enjoy being a detective

1962
01:35:06,557 --> 01:35:11,061
and despite all of
our differences, okay,

1963
01:35:11,093 --> 01:35:13,196
most of all our legal
justice system works

1964
01:35:13,230 --> 01:35:15,766
once we held them accountable
for their actions.

1965
01:35:15,798 --> 01:35:16,900
Thank you.

1966
01:35:16,933 --> 01:35:17,834
Anything else you
wanna share with us?

1967
01:35:17,869 --> 01:35:19,270
CHRIS: No, thank you.
Excuse us, please.

1968
01:35:19,303 --> 01:35:20,638
Thank you.

1969
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:22,740
REPORTER: Detective,
one more question.

1970
01:36:20,864 --> 01:36:22,900
<i>And the world will never rise</i>

1971
01:36:22,932 --> 01:36:26,035
<i>to its full moral,</i>

1972
01:36:26,069 --> 01:36:29,874
<i>or political, or</i>
even social maturity,

1973
01:36:31,074 --> 01:36:35,346
<i>until racism is</i>
totally eradicated.

1974
01:36:35,379 --> 01:36:39,083
Well, it may be true that
morality cannot be legislated,

1975
01:36:39,115 --> 01:36:42,319
but behavior can be regulated.

1976
01:36:42,352 --> 01:36:46,691
It may be true that the law
cannot change the heart,

1977
01:36:47,691 --> 01:36:51,695
but it can restrain
the heartless.

1978
01:36:51,727 --> 01:36:55,231
It may be true that the law
can't make a man love me,

1979
01:36:55,264 --> 01:36:58,267
but it can restrain
him from lynching me

1980
01:36:58,301 --> 01:37:02,205
and I think that is
pretty important also.

1981
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:06,843
And so while the law may not
change the hearts of men,

1982
01:37:06,877 --> 01:37:10,647
it does change the habits of men

1983
01:37:10,681 --> 01:37:12,817
if it's vigorously enforced.
