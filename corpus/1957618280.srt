1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,269
(cattle lowing) (glass shattering)

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:04,270
(whooshing)

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,273
(crickets chirping)

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:11,578
(waves crashing)

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,559
(water spraying)

6
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:43,743
(car engine revving)

7
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:01,594
Gimme, uh, gimme,

8
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,997
Gimme.

9
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,665
Gimme, gimme, uh-- If you don't like it.

10
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,001
You know where the door is at.

11
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,804
Gimme, gimme the Elite.

12
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:11,638
Yeah.

13
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,040
The Elite?

14
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,243
Yeah.

15
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,978
Nah, gimme the Works.

16
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,047
But you're gonna vacuum the car, right?

17
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,282
I'm not gonna pay 12 bucks

18
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,217
and not have the damn car vacuumed.

19
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,051
Yeah.

20
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:26,953
Yeah, what?

21
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,254
We vacuum.

22
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,155
Read the sign.

23
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:33,960
Oh.

24
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,563
Yeah, gimme the Works.

25
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,233
12 bucks for a lousy wash.

26
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:48,908
Hey!

27
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,213
Vacuum, right?

28
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,749
(Jimmy scoffs)

29
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,821
(slow jazz music)

30
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,339
- [Jimmy] Man, it's colder than shit out here, Art.

31
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,307
I mean, what's this all about, anyway?

32
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,042
You ain't gonna catch nothin'.

33
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,777
We could've met in a bar or something.

34
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,651
Jimmy, I think I got a way for us to make a lot of money.

35
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,520
(scoffs) Yeah, right. A lot of money.

36
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,354
- [Jimmy] Uh huh.

37
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,823
Hey don't laugh.

38
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,725
500 grand, each.

39
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,093
Man, why don't you tell it to that fish out there, okay?

40
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,629
Jimmy, I am serious.

41
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,765
I'm through with that shit, Art, I told you.

42
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,034
I got it all figured. I'm done, man.

43
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,571
It's a sweet caper, it's a very sweet caper.

44
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,706
It'll be me four of us, so musically speaking,

45
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,574
it's a quartet.

46
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:29,809
A what?

47
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,345
This is enough, okay?

48
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,379
Just, just listen--

49
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,948
I've done my time, Art.

50
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,616
I'm through.

51
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,785
Look, nobody gets hurt.

52
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,486
I got the seed money saved.

53
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,723
Man, this is ready to happen.

54
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,557
Look at you man.

55
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,963
Hey, you tell me you wanna work in that car wash

56
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,164
the rest of your life.

57
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:53,833
Jimmy, I want.

58
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,471
I need somebody I can trust, man.

59
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,505
I need you.

60
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,743
Look, just hear me out all right.

61
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,577
Hey dinner.

62
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,713
Let me buy you dinner.

63
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,847
You want me to buy you dinner?

64
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,782
Come on, we'll talk.

65
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:10,617
What'll be?

66
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,552
Popeyes!

67
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,053
Brown's Chicken!

68
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,322
Screw it, we'll shoot the one.

69
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,457
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

70
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,227
(airplane soaring)

71
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,401
(police car siren wailing)

72
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,082
(bluesy jazz music)

73
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,862
I think the cap makes it.

74
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,263
I gotta guy who altered it.

75
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,731
Michigan Avenue quality.

76
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,233
That's a really spiffy suit.

77
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,101
Very professional.

78
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:02,902
But.

79
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,938
What? Lots.

80
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,674
Could you be specific?

81
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,009
First, you guys are traveling damn near 400 miles

82
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:10,943
back and forth.

83
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,412
That's a lot of exposure.

84
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,781
We're up there for hours before they even figure out

85
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,948
what's going down.

86
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,250
And it's only minutes from the border.

87
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,685
By plane. Right!

88
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:19,986
They won't be expecting that.

89
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,920
I don't know Aurthur.

90
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,522
And then there's your buddy.

91
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,323
Jimmy.

92
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,694
I remember him.

93
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,861
What do you remember?

94
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,096
Jimmy Fuqua.

95
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,764
Point guard, little guy, quick hands.

96
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,232
With Illinois, there was a couple of years

97
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,335
when they were half way decent.

98
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,270
'79, '80, somewhere along in there.

99
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,005
Yeah? Yeah.

100
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,607
He took 10 grand to shave points and he got caught.

101
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,110
Big fucking Michigan game.

102
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,612
Bulu bulu and he's bounced out of school.

103
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:47,847
In and out of the joint every since.

104
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,549
A drug thing-- Years ago.

105
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,983
Whatever, that ain't the issue.

106
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,518
What is?

107
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,421
The issue is he sold out his teammates.

108
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,756
His partners.

109
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,324
I met Jimmy in the hole.

110
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,326
I trust Jimmy Fuqua with my life!

111
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,527
He's a fuck up!

112
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,196
He was just a kid!

113
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,164
I've been shot at by younger.

114
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:05,998
Mike.

115
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,203
We all have our price.

116
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,207
I was set up.

117
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,208
Sure, sure, right.

118
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,010
Arthur, don't go and piss me off.

119
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,048
Mike.

120
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,685
The why is not the issue.

121
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,454
What is,

122
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,891
is they took your shield and your pension.

123
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,728
Believe me, I appreciate the difficulty there must be

124
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,564
in finding gainful employment with that kind of record.

125
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,836
Especially in security related fields.

126
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,611
Proceed, Mr. Bledsoe.

127
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,483
(water splashing)

128
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,525
(bluesy ambient music)

129
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,939
That house up on Barry where I live.

130
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,474
I know that phone was bugged.

131
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:58,377
You picked the phone up, it'd crack and hiss and pop.

132
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,514
That's why I couldn't sell my sketches.

133
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,382
We got buried.

134
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,218
It was Nixon, it was--

135
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,319
That's too easy Art.

136
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:07,987
What's easy?

137
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,355
That conspiracy shit.

138
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,457
I mean, it's like believing in God, ain't it?

139
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,361
You know when I was a kid, about 10 or 11,

140
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,196
it was right after Dr. King was shot.

141
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,698
Yeah, now who do you think ordered that?

142
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,499
See the FBI was all over him.

143
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,001
Relax man.

144
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,003
You're right but that's not my point.

145
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,609
Now the city sent them, I don't even know who they were man.

146
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,344
These officials, white guys,

147
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,445
into the neighborhoods,

148
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,513
to try to calm things down.

149
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,148
Now most of this was just people you know,

150
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,284
standing up, getting shit off their chest.

151
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,420
But these guys were very polite, you know.

152
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,623
They would nod, take a few notes.

153
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,359
Say things like, oh that's a very valid point.

154
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,728
You know, same ole same ole.

155
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,129
But one time,

156
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,998
this cat came in, brother.

157
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,567
Stood up, looks these white guys right in the eye

158
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,403
and says, we want what you got.

159
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,640
And that scared them Art.

160
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,308
Scared the shit of 'em.

161
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,843
I mean you could feel it man.

162
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,046
It wasn't tension, it was like some prime evil force.

163
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,649
And you know, you knew right then,

164
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,917
that there was no way in hell

165
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,085
these cats were gonna give up shit.

166
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,186
(alarm buzzing)

167
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,021
Right.

168
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,561
- [Art] Okay, so they didn't have the mahogany desk

169
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,597
but those are the white haired dudes, man.

170
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,798
(alarm buzzing)

171
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,366
The corporate structure, political structure.

172
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,568
- [Jimmy] I know that but man,

173
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,069
but that's not what I said, okay.

174
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:31,771
Yeah?

175
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,439
- [Jessica] It's me.

176
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,208
What?

177
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,243
For this?

178
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,744
She'll be an asset man.

179
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,779
She's quick.

180
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,113
We need a female.

181
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,182
That's not what she's here for man.

182
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,984
Jimmy, will you just ease up?

183
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,189
Hi. Hey, hey.

184
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,457
Mmm. Mmm.

185
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,760
You remember Jimmy Fuqua?

186
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,895
Sure, hi. Hey.

187
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,398
- [Art] Mike, how did you get up?

188
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,599
Front door was open.

189
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,402
Sorry.

190
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,873
Yeah, Mike Quinn, Jessica Sutter.

191
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:08,808
- [Jessica] Hi.

192
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,711
And uh, Jimmy Fuqua, Mike Quinn.

193
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,346
Yeah.

194
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,180
Yeah, what?

195
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,953
Hey look, we all come here with clean slates, right?

196
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,722
Tabula rasa, all of us.

197
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,892
If anybody's got a problem with that, get out now.

198
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,895
(soft upbeat music)

199
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,203
Okay now look, I haven't told you everything.

200
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,170
Some stuff can wait.

201
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,905
And I want it to stay that way.

202
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,975
What is something happens to you Aurthur?

203
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,778
Nothing's gonna happen to me, right Mike?

204
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,748
(upbeat jazz music)

205
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,519
The timing at the banks is critical.

206
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,122
We gotta get 'em in and out.

207
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,923
So that he can make the 10:15.

208
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,227
- [Jessica] This train from Chicago, this can't be right.

209
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,528
What?

210
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:03,929
Well, it's six hours by car

211
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:04,764
to this place in Michigan, right?

212
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,931
Right.

213
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,733
Okay, well it's almost nine by train.

214
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,704
That's cause it stops everywhere.

215
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,040
In Hammond, Gary, where I pick up Mike,

216
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,144
Michigan City, Benton Harbor, everywhere.

217
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,212
Mike and I will beat it back by hours.

218
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,048
Okay, Arthur, you've done your homework.

219
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,016
Pretty impressive stuff on paper.

220
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,419
Of course, you realize the whole thing blows up

221
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,721
if anyone part of a, what's his face,

222
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,289
the uh, chauffer. Blackwell.

223
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,857
Yeah, the chauffer.

224
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,792
Blackwell.

225
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,660
Yeah, geez, what are ya, deaf?

226
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,462
All right, what I'm saying is,

227
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,397
that is Blackwell is full of shit,

228
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,399
it's lights out, party over.

229
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,303
I'm sure he's right.

230
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,337
Why?

231
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,006
I don't know, my gut.

232
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:47,807
Anything else?

233
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:51,811
Go on, tell him Art.

234
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,414
What?

235
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,684
Well, we're both into the music.

236
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,152
The music?

237
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,488
Yeah, you know, jazz.

238
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,491
Be-Bop & Beyond.

239
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,227
It's a bonding kind of a thing, like they're in a club.

240
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,061
Uh ha. Yeah.

241
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,064
Look, it's not often you meet somebody

242
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,834
who has both Agharta and Pangaea.

243
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,268
Aren't those diseases?

244
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,504
No, they're two Miles Davis albums.

245
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,972
(Mike laughing)

246
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,173
No, it's makes sense.

247
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,475
Why don't you just listen to Art?

248
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,977
Look.

249
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,346
How many people have a Miles album?

250
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,747
Not many right.

251
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,882
And those that do,

252
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,184
they're into the acoustic stuff.

253
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,520
They hate the acid funk stuff.

254
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,922
Those of us that like it are few and far between.

255
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,824
Jimmy, you understand me on this?

256
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,127
Guess it must be fate.

257
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,930
Yeah, it's a club all right.

258
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,268
(bluesy jazz music)

259
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,604
- [Arthur] Jessie and I go to the house, first.

260
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,807
We set it up, then we meet you guys at the airport.

261
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,609
Then we all go back to the house together.

262
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,244
- [Aurthur] Right.

263
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,512
- [Mike] I don't don't understand why you spend $400 a night

264
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,746
on a beach house.

265
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,715
Wail till you see this place.

266
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,717
Nobody's gonna bother us up there.

267
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,552
And it's equal distance to the train station

268
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,621
to the airport, it's perfect.

269
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,956
- [Mike] Better have a jacuzzi for 400 bucks.

270
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,858
Mike this is it.

271
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,928
Look, if the deal goes belly up,

272
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,130
at least we'll be going out in style, right?

273
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,466
Okay, enough of this house talk.

274
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,234
When do I get to meet Charlie Blackwell.

275
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,636
Don't be so anxious.

276
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,937
Why, you said he was cute.

277
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,177
Tomorrow.

278
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:35,181
He's um, he's a regular on Thursdays after work.

279
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,284
I'm working so I'll be there too.

280
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,685
Good, you'll get to watch.

281
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,453
You know, I knew this wouldn't be difficult for you.

282
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,055
No, it's fun.

283
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,790
(Mike laughing)

284
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,059
Just make sure you get that car phone number.

285
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,661
I'll get it.

286
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,462
Even if I have to-- Are we done?

287
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,433
I mean once we get car phone number, then we go.

288
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:59,405
Then we go.

289
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:01,740
Why is it I get the feeling you just do not like me?

290
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,641
I never said that.

291
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,044
Well, you didn't have to say it.

292
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,880
(traffic passing)

293
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,516
You know, Art would give you the world

294
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,450
and you treat him like shit. Look, you know what?

295
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,918
You know nothing about it.

296
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,887
Art and I have got an arrangement, that's that.

297
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,489
I think it stinks.

298
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,425
Well, Art Bledsoe is a grown up

299
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,893
and he can make his own decisions.

300
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,262
He's a kid, he's like an innocent little child.

301
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,064
Not like you.

302
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,200
Not like you?

303
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,536
Well you see, we have something in common.

304
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,307
(scoffs) Shit baby, we ain't got a damn thing in common.

305
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:37,810
Jimmy.

306
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,549
I think you're lying.

307
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,719
Art won't mind.

308
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,426
You been to jail baby?

309
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,499
Yeah, I've been to jail.

310
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,001
Not weeks, real time. I can handle it.

311
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,969
This ain't no misdemeanor shit girl,

312
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,504
this is the real deal.

313
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,675
Jessica, tell me something.

314
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:10,943
What?

315
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,111
Why are you doing this?

316
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,253
'Cause I gotta get the hell out of here.

317
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,727
Hey, this is perfect huh?

318
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,031
Yeah, that looks like a suitcase, Art.

319
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,198
Jimmy, we're heading up near the bar.

320
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,500
You wanna get dropped somewhere?

321
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,935
Nah man, I'll walk.

322
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,935
I'll catch you around midnight.

323
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:37,770
Right.

324
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:39,805
Jessica. Yeah?

325
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,974
Good luck.

326
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,376
I'll see ya Jimmy.

327
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,913
Hey Art man, you gotta minute?

328
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:48,747
Gotta go Jimmy.

329
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,558
(upbeat music)

330
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,193
Hey Art? Yeah Charlie.

331
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,228
One more for my new friend here, too.

332
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:06,598
(upbeat music)

333
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,599
I'm way ahead of ya.

334
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,071
Art, I wanna introduce you to a very,

335
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,539
very good friend of mine.

336
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,476
Baby, what'd you say your name was again?

337
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,811
Oh thanks a lot.

338
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,713
(laughing) It's been a long day, baby.

339
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:22,781
- [Jessica] Jessie.

340
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,416
Jessica, that's right.

341
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,519
I knew it was like a Janice or a Jezebel or something.

342
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,921
Jezebel!

343
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,889
Yeah, well you're betting a thousand there.

344
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,891
Well this is my man Art.

345
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,427
Gotta record collection even bigger than mine.

346
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,229
Wow. No shit.

347
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,063
Hmm. Right Art?

348
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,231
Hey, no joke.

349
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,569
What's this for man?

350
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,038
On the house Charlie, enjoy.

351
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,241
(upbeat jazz music)

352
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,242
Thank you.

353
00:16:56,548 --> 00:17:00,452
(Charlie and Jessica laughing)

354
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,821
(upbeat jazz music)

355
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,790
Ew, I love this song.

356
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,258
I'mma go dance.

357
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,393
I'll be right back, um.

358
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,829
I'm sorry, what'd you say your name was again champ?

359
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,098
I deserve that, all right.

360
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,466
Yeah.

361
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,469
(upbeat jazz music)

362
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,091
Art, we'll get that.

363
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,627
Baby got some major back.

364
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,328
Fine, very fine.

365
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,631
Whew and titties too.

366
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,799
Look at those things.

367
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,336
Art man, you're suppose to be on my side, you know?

368
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,137
Guy to guy?

369
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,607
I am.

370
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,610
(upbeat jazz music)

371
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,089
Arthur, I really admire you, keeping your cool like this.

372
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,157
My girlfriend up there, I would go through the fucking roof.

373
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,592
She's getting her brains fucked out even--

374
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,860
Quinn man!

375
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,762
Smack you through the goddamn roof. (laughs)

376
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,030
I betcha she's taking it up the keister right about now.

377
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,098
Quinn, would you shut the fuck up all right?

378
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:19,932
Hey Fuqua, give it a rest.

379
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,200
Shut the fuck up!

380
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
Aurthur knows I'm just busting his--

381
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,835
Damn!

382
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,869
(Mike laughing)

383
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,637
We go way back, don't we Art?

384
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,873
Yeah.

385
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,041
25 years.

386
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,444
1968.

387
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,446
Right, 1968.

388
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,917
Busted Art at the convention at Grant Park.

389
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,753
Fucking hippies, yippies, yippy doo dahs everywhere.

390
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,256
(Mike laughs)

391
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,825
It wasn't the park.

392
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,327
Yeah, it was.

393
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,795
No it wasn't.

394
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,096
Of course, it was.

395
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,264
No Mike.

396
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,632
Where the hell was it then?

397
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,102
Monroe Street, in front of the Palmer House.

398
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,637
No. Yeah.

399
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,471
You sure?

400
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,641
Mike, I'm surprised.

401
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,379
Well, I busted somebody at Grant Park.

402
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,048
1968, my rookie year.

403
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,053
Aurthur, who'd they end up nominating again?

404
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,789
Humphrey.

405
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,624
There she is.

406
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,759
- [Mike] Well she looks happy.

407
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:33,572
Got it.

408
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,909
Man, it was just like you said.

409
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,710
The number were in the black book.

410
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,412
And I found this guy a shit load of cash.

411
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,246
And Blackwell?

412
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,150
Sleeping like a baby, hmm.

413
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,023
(car engine humming)

414
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,524
Can we get some breakfast now?

415
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,146
Mike, can we have a minute?

416
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:14,980
- [Mike] Sure.

417
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,292
What?

418
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,561
- [Art] You know.

419
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,396
What?

420
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,465
- [Art] Is that appropriate?

421
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,299
What?

422
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,535
Put your leg down.

423
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,569
Bullshit, make me.

424
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,470
Do it now.

425
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,176
Art Bledsoe, are you jealous?

426
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,945
Look, just 'cause you ball half the civilized world,

427
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,680
doesn't mean you gotta advertise it.

428
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,284
(sighs) Shh, relax baby.

429
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,087
Come on, you know you're the only one for me.

430
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,321
I just want-- Me.

431
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,525
You're gonna be the best of me.

432
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:04,029
Only old men worry about dying baby.

433
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,931
And you guys can drive the van.

434
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,807
It may not be my place Aurthur,

435
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,243
but I'd smack the shit out of her.

436
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,416
(slow jazz music)

437
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,007
- [Jimmy] Having second thoughts?

438
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,444
No.

439
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,945
- [Jimmy] You okay man?

440
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,947
Yeah, everything's cool. Cool.

441
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:00,385
It's just ah, it's just hitting me, you know.

442
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,354
Like, this is gonna go.

443
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,422
- [Jimmy] Yes, it is.

444
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,157
I'm thinking like,

445
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:07,726
what could happen.

446
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,164
What it really means Jimmy.

447
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,833
Art thanks.

448
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,102
For what?

449
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,639
You didn't have to cut me in on this.

450
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,941
Quinn, that's what everybody thinks right?

451
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,676
- [Art] Jimmy, I never doubted you.

452
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,645
Never you know.

453
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,114
Yeah.

454
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,482
- [Art] I know you're there man.

455
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,316
Till the end.

456
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,118
But still.

457
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,124
Is that it?

458
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,493
The shoes and the cap are inside.

459
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,165
I'm there man.

460
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,573
You can count on me mother fucker.

461
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,480
My friend.

462
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,688
(bluesy jazz music)

463
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,667
- [Woman On PA] May I have your attention please?

464
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:26,004
(faint talking over PA)

465
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,144
Where's Charles?

466
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,612
Charles is sick today ma'am.

467
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:34,813
My name is Lewis.

468
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,651
(Jill clears throat)

469
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,707
(airplane soaring)

470
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,589
(cars engines humming)

471
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:27,132
Ma'am, I'm going to have to stop for some gas.

472
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,867
(signal light chiming)

473
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,269
Couldn't you have done that before?

474
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,637
- [Jimmy] Sorry ma'am.

475
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,640
(upbeat jazz music)

476
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,607
What are. (murmuring)

477
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,741
I want you to shut up.

478
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,644
(rapid jazz music)

479
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:40,138
Please don't hurt me, please, please!

480
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:40,972
(woman yelling)

481
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,908
Oh come on, move!

482
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,643
(muffled talking)

483
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,545
(rapid jazz music)

484
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,554
(muffled yelling)

485
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,457
(rapid jazz music)

486
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,533
You're all right, you're all right.

487
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,634
It's okay.

488
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,005
We do not want to hurt you.

489
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,379
(Jimmy grunting)

490
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,684
I'm going to give you something to read.

491
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,620
(rapid jazz music)

492
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,960
Dad, I'm okay.

493
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,896
(rapid jazz music)

494
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,535
(gun bangs)

495
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,437
He was gonna make me.

496
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,972
What the fuck's wrong with you?

497
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,146
- [Art] What was that?

498
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,648
- [Mike] The blindfold came off Aurthur.

499
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,682
The ballgame would have been over before it began.

500
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,018
This ape shot the kid. Oh man.

501
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,786
Oh Jesus.

502
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,021
Well, that's it, there's no turning back now.

503
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,023
Art, we gotta calla an ambulance or something.

504
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,092
He's-- Jessie, the man's dead.

505
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,760
Art. What?

506
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,295
This is wrong man.

507
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,297
Well exactly what do you propose, Jimmy?

508
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:19,170
I don't know.

509
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,005
Come on.

510
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,845
(pensive jazz music)

511
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:39,591
Lock it up.

512
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,565
We don't have to love each other.

513
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,001
The pay off is in 36 hours.

514
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,703
If you're in, you're in.

515
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,004
And you play by my rules.

516
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,439
Now, what's it gonna be Mike?

517
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,007
I'm fine.

518
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:56,841
It's uh.

519
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:00,512
Jimmy?

520
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,183
I'm all right.

521
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:08,787
I'll see you at the airport.

522
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:26,037
(van engine revving)

523
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,154
- [Mike] Well?

524
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:45,924
For now.

525
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,393
For now, then.

526
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,131
(car engine revving)

527
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:11,316
(police siren wailing) (cars honking)

528
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,137
(faint chattering)

529
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,462
(tape ripping)

530
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,235
(phone ringing) Yeah?

531
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,069
It's me.

532
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,193
Mr. Luce? Yeah?

533
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,260
You have a telephone call.

534
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,094
Thanks Mariam.

535
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,664
Yes?

536
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,865
Mr. Luce?

537
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,366
Yes.

538
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,535
I'm calling about your daughter.

539
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:38,336
Yes.

540
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:40,939
10 seconds.

541
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,180
- [Jimmy] There's something I want you to listen to.

542
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,952
- [Jill] Dad, I'm okay.

543
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,989
For 10 million dollars, I'll be released, safe and unharmed.

544
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,326
If you cooperate fully, they promise not to hurt me.

545
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:04,696
Listen to the instructions and follow them to the letter.

546
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,233
I love you dad. (shaky breathing)

547
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,835
Do you understand?

548
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,036
Yes.

549
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,372
You will arrange to have one million dollars

550
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,741
in small unmarked bills waiting for you

551
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,844
at the following 10 banks.

552
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:20,945
Loot branches only.

553
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,382
I suggest you get a pencil and paper.

554
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:29,220
(suspenseful jazz music)

555
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,544
- [Art] Are you gonna talk to me or what?

556
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,116
Jessie, what could I do?

557
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,285
Jimmy's right Art, it was wrong to kill him.

558
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,287
I didn't pull the trigger.

559
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,855
Yeah, but you brought Quinn in.

560
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,658
Take a look in the mirror.

561
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,827
I don't see any saints around here, do you?

562
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,698
Yeah, well you didn't have to kill him.

563
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,099
Don't you think I know that?

564
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,370
Damn, I liked Charlie.

565
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,073
Oh yeah. (laughs)

566
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,342
What do you mean?

567
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,476
Art, I know you.

568
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,212
You think you do. No, I do.

569
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,650
You think you do.

570
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,923
(plane soaring)

571
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,196
That's close enough. Tomorrow morning.

572
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,030
It's your call. All right.

573
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,700
(faint talking)

574
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,710
Any news yet? No.

575
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,211
You laid it out for the pilot?

576
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,613
Yeah, we're back in two days.

577
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:03,981
In the morning, in Chicago. All right.

578
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:06,417
In the evening Toronto. Right.

579
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,619
Half now, half then. Good.

580
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,093
(van engine puttering)

581
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,695
(Jill murmuring)

582
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,897
(Jill grunting)

583
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,265
- [Jessica] All right.

584
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:55,666
What I tell you Jimmy, huh?

585
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,237
Hey Art, this is cool.

586
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,448
(Jill murmuring)

587
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,584
- [Jessica] (whistling) Told ya, as big as a church.

588
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,889
- [Jimmy] Yeah, I could have spent my summer vacations here.

589
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,995
Despite some obvious limitations,

590
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,431
I think you're gonna find this quite comfortable.

591
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,069
Look, we're not gonna terrorize you.

592
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,538
Lock you in the closet for two weeks.

593
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:36,441
We're not Satanist, we're not demented.

594
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,409
This is about money.

595
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,648
Look, you'll get fed three times a day.

596
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,317
We'll get you magazines.

597
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,953
All you have to do is stay in here,

598
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:52,190
be quiet, be still, rest.

599
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,860
You make it sound like some sort of retreat.

600
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,562
That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

601
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,866
This whole thing will be over in just a couple of days.

602
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,201
- [Jimmy] Art, it's the news.

603
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,213
(water trickling)

604
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,158
(door closes)

605
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,060
- [Reporter] The story this hour is the reported kidnapping

606
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,263
of the daughter of one of Chicago's wealthiest families.

607
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,232
Jill Luce, the 20-year-old daughter

608
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,534
of financier Morgan Luc Junior,

609
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,437
was abducted early this morning at O'Hare Airport.

610
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,539
As Luce had just arrived from Tokyo

611
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,741
where she has spent the last semester studying

612
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,277
at the American University in Tokyo.

613
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,347
The demands of the kidnappers are not known at this time.

614
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,783
In a related story, the Luce's chauffer Charles Blackwell

615
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,019
was found murdered this morning in a remote section

616
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,354
of Busee Woods.

617
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,955
Blackwell, aged 25,

618
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:00,691
was scheduled to pick up Jill Luce at O'Hare.

619
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,578
(door slams)

620
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,314
(waves crashing)

621
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:27,818
It's fitting huh?

622
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,390
It's like the world ends right here.

623
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,224
Or begins.

624
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,699
Jimmy, about Blackwell- Hey.

625
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,167
Nothing you can do my friend.

626
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:45,836
Yeah.

627
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,840
Where did this come from Art?

628
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,841
What?

629
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:51,676
This.

630
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:52,944
This whole thing, man.

631
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,045
Seriously? Yeah.

632
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,516
It's weird man, it came to me in a dream.

633
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:01,485
A dream?

634
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,689
In a dream, I'm on a beach.

635
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,791
Not like this, the Caribbean beach.

636
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,794
Blue water everywhere.

637
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,532
And I'm digging this tunnel with my hands.

638
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,035
I stop because in the distance,

639
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,637
I see somebody on a horse.

640
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:24,742
They gallop over and it turns out it's a knight.

641
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,143
You know, like King Aurthur?

642
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,347
Complete with a mace, the whole thing.

643
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,984
He gallops over and he doesn't say anything.

644
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,621
So I say, you know.

645
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,557
You must be hot in that suit.

646
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,492
(Jimmy laughing)

647
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,227
He flips up his visor thingy.

648
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,730
And it's Joe Stalin.

649
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,532
The Russian? Yeah, the dictator.

650
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:54,138
Stalin says, where are all the peasants?

651
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,240
And I say, there are no peasants here.

652
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,944
Too bad, says Stalin.

653
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,911
I ask why.

654
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,614
And he says,

655
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,884
because before you slaughter them,

656
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,953
they could build this damn tunnel for you.

657
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,588
Think about that.

658
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,722
And he gallops away.

659
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:13,891
So I think about it.

660
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,361
And I turn around and behind me now

661
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,630
is this huge brick wall.

662
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,699
It goes on forever, even over the water.

663
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,201
And there's music coming.

664
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,439
It's Miles, he's playing Some Day My Prince Will Come.

665
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,642
I run up to the wall and I put my ear against it.

666
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,413
I listen and there's big party going on.

667
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,947
There was no way I'd get to it.

668
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,884
And the graffiti says,

669
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:42,586
take.

670
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,357
You are the chosen prince.

671
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,258
Take it all.

672
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,727
Signed J.S.

673
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,964
Then I woke up.

674
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,332
We're here because of that?

675
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,103
The very next day, Charlie Blackwell comes into the bar.

676
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:00,938
We talk.

677
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,173
First, it's about the music.

678
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,076
Then he tells me about this gig with Luce,

679
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,343
the kid being away at school.

680
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:07,578
He lays it out man.

681
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,613
Everything, he tells me everything.

682
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:17,455
In my head, the whole time, I got this picture of Joe Stalin

683
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,324
on that stupid horse, saying take.

684
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,661
You're the chosen prince, take it al.

685
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:27,698
You dream much Jimmy?

686
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:31,736
You gotta sleep to dream.

687
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,773
(waves crashing)

688
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,890
(jazz music)

689
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,432
Arthur, do you ever not listen to that noise?

690
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:04,735
(laughs) You know, we gotta work on you Mike.

691
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,505
Seriously. (jazz music)

692
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,141
Hey Mike.

693
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:17,581
I'd do it again, if that's what you're asking.

694
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:19,917
Yeah.

695
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,319
(jazz music)

696
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,490
We're playing for keeps Arthur.

697
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,528
If the colored kid sees me, we're made.

698
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,362
It's over.

699
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,134
I was wondering, I--

700
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,170
Do I feel bad that I popped the kid?

701
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:41,939
No.

702
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,474
I didn't make the world.

703
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,876
(jazz music)

704
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,626
(door squeaks)

705
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:15,940
Dinner.

706
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,291
There are a thousand ways

707
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,628
a woman can get undressed.

708
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:45,436
Simple.

709
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:56,013
Very simple. (Jill grunting)

710
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,920
Art says to, keep the door open man.

711
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:10,861
What?

712
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,364
Nothing's going on.

713
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,342
Please help me.

714
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,080
I'm scared. (sobbing)

715
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,915
Let me go.

716
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,686
My father, they'll be a reward if you help me.

717
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:40,224
Please. (sobbing)

718
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,560
Why are you doing this?

719
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,263
Is it just for the money?

720
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:54,238
If he tries that shit again, scream.

721
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:03,981
What if he does something to that girl?

722
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,215
Have you thought about that?

723
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:06,550
We're way behind going back Jimmy.

724
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,185
You told me that nobody was gonna get hurt.

725
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,987
Who do you think I am?

726
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,390
I'm not God, man.

727
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,060
Art, this ain't you man.

728
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,835
All right Jimmy, look.

729
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,572
I'm a lot closer to 50 than I am to 40, you know.

730
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:31,942
I'm old man.

731
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,211
What do I got?

732
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:39,116
I tend a little bar, I forge a few documents.

733
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,417
What kind of life is that?

734
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,089
I need this Jimmy.

735
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:47,891
I need it.

736
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,763
And I'm not gonna let Quinn or anybody screw it up for me.

737
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,993
(pensive jazz music)

738
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,733
I'm watching you man.

739
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:07,204
(pensive jazz music)

740
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:12,676
Here.

741
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,313
The tunnel, I figure you've got,

742
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,984
45 seconds to look for the wire.

743
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:23,720
That ain't a hell of a lot of time.

744
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,389
Maybe you have a minute.

745
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,590
Don't count on it.

746
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,092
'Cause they're gonna be tailing him.

747
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,526
Ready.

748
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,829
Okay baby, you're just going for newspapers right?

749
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,398
Magazines for the kid, stuff like that?

750
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,232
Yeah, I know.

751
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,467
Nothing else?

752
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,701
Yes Art, I think I can handle that.

753
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:51,749
(papers flopping)

754
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,549
Shit.

755
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:58,689
Here.

756
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,224
Let me.

757
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:01,492
No, I'm fine, thank you.

758
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:02,326
I got it.

759
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,765
Some pretty heavy reading here.

760
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:09,600
Yeah.

761
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,102
Well thank you uh.

762
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:14,671
Thanks.

763
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,142
Well.

764
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:25,883
Hi again.

765
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,585
Hi.

766
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:30,220
That's a lot of newspaper. Yeah.

767
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,356
There's a bookstore down town

768
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,324
if you're just looking for stuff to read.

769
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:38,729
No, um, just my family and I like to keep up

770
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,198
with what's going on, current events and stuff.

771
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:42,332
Y'all have friends up here?

772
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,835
Yeah, no, hmm hmm.

773
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:45,669
Hmm hmm.

774
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,973
We're staying a friend's summer place.

775
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:50,874
Oh yeah? Hmm hmm.

776
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:51,708
Where?

777
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,212
Um, by the lake.

778
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:56,446
That's beautiful property up there.

779
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:57,714
Yeah.

780
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:58,482
Not many tourists this time of year, though.

781
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,850
Hmm hmm, nope.

782
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,489
Sort of like a family retreat.

783
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,626
- [Cashier] That's be $6.39.

784
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:19,503
Here.

785
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,737
I got it.

786
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:22,839
Look, there's really no need for you to um.

787
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,741
No problem, lead on.

788
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,448
So you're from Chicago, huh?

789
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:32,683
I didn't say I was from Chicago.

790
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,917
I know.

791
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,452
It's just your van has Illinois plates.

792
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:38,622
Most people up there from Illinois are from Chicago.

793
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,556
Right.

794
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:40,791
If they were Indiana plates,

795
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,692
I'd say you were from Indianapolis.

796
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:44,528
Yeah right.

797
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,463
I guess that's why I'm a cop.

798
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,031
I'm putting stuff like that together all the time.

799
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:48,999
Oh good for you.

800
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,336
Well thank you.

801
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,971
No, the job's undone.

802
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,542
Okay.

803
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,183
(door slams)

804
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,518
Thank you, you've been a great help.

805
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:09,353
My name's Ray.

806
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:11,455
Ray Higgs.

807
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:14,324
Uh, Jessica.

808
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,892
Uh, Jessie.

809
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,361
Nice to meet ya, Jessie.

810
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:19,029
Likewise, Ray.

811
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,330
Yet again, thank you.

812
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,467
Uh, excuse me, Jessie.

813
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,002
Yeah. But uh.

814
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,671
I couldn't help but notice you're not wearing a ring.

815
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,674
I was just wondering if there's a boyfriend or not,

816
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,110
I'm wondering if you'd like to go out.

817
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,213
You mean on a date?

818
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,583
Something funny about that?

819
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,086
No, no, not funny, I--

820
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,155
Most people date in the big city.

821
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,623
Well yeah, of course.

822
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:50,027
But, just not with us hicks from the sticks.

823
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:52,863
Well, Ray, look, I'm flattered really.

824
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,499
It's just that you caught me by surprise, that's all.

825
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,567
Well then?

826
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:01,872
Um, I'd love to but we're leaving tomorrow.

827
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,507
Really.

828
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,341
Yeah?

829
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:06,209
Really.

830
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,981
Is something wrong Ray?

831
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:13,483
Right is right.

832
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,388
Well next time, I'd love to, seriously.

833
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:22,893
Be good now.

834
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,608
I'm telling you, he suspects something.

835
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:39,843
Something.

836
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:41,078
- [Art] You were flirting with him.

837
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:44,481
I was not, this time, I was, no, I wasn't.

838
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,549
Mike?

839
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,584
Chicago copy is hitting on her.

840
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:49,619
Some hick, I don't know.

841
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,288
I'm telling you, Art I'm fucking scared man.

842
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:52,222
You should have seen his eyes.

843
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,024
He was fucking weird

844
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,459
I'm telling you.

845
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,627
You just freaked Jessie, because it was a cop, that's all.

846
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:59,896
Yeah, Jimmy's right.

847
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:00,931
It's a long day.

848
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:02,666
Waiting is the hard part.

849
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,702
We'll cool out, have an early dinner, get some sleep.

850
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:06,937
Why don't you go upstairs.

851
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,339
And take a bath, relax the muscles.

852
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,574
Come on, it's all right.

853
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:11,641
Have a drink, a couple of drinks.

854
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:12,976
Yeah, I'm out of pot.

855
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,188
(swanky jazz music)

856
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,659
- [Jimmy] Yeah?

857
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,061
Jimmy.

858
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:34,064
(swanky jazz music)

859
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:39,803
What do you want Jessica?

860
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:40,771
(swanky jazz music)

861
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:43,106
Why don't you like me Jimmy?

862
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:45,041
Hmm?

863
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,245
What did I ever do?

864
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,214
Tell me Jimmy, what did I do?

865
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:54,184
(swanky jazz music)

866
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,624
I just want you to like me Jimmy.

867
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,759
(swanky jazz music)

868
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,928
I mean really like me.

869
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,830
Jessie-- I like you.

870
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,300
(Jessica murmuring)

871
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,969
(lips smacking)

872
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,075
What?

873
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,242
You smell like scotch, huh?

874
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,547
Yeah, I checked out the liquor cabinet.

875
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:24,815
Come on. What?

876
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,349
Come on. Jimmy what?

877
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,617
Come on.

878
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:29,052
Come on.

879
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,053
No!

880
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,888
Come on. (yells) Jimmy it's cold!

881
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,123
Damn right, it's cold.

882
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,258
Always think you're so fucking cool, don't you.

883
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,462
Tell me something Jimmy, why are you doing this?

884
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,263
That's a damn good question Jessica.

885
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:45,235
(Jessica grunts)

886
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:46,036
Shit.

887
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:56,346
Jimmy, you're all wet.

888
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,848
Your girlfriend.

889
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,449
- [Art] What do you mean?

890
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,517
She's wasted.

891
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:01,985
No, no, just a couple of drinks.

892
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:05,021
She's-- No, in my room wasted.

893
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,389
What do you mean, what did you do?

894
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:07,624
I did nothing.

895
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,326
You would. Fuck you man.

896
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,795
We need her man. Yeah, she'll be there.

897
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,296
She'll come through.

898
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,197
It's just this thing with the cop, threw her off.

899
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:15,131
She's all right.

900
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,566
You can't see it, can you?

901
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,602
It's in your face and you can't see it Art.

902
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:21,905
Number one, this animal just about fucked everything.

903
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:22,939
Easy guys.

904
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:23,940
All right, Jimmy Fuqua.

905
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,442
Come on, right here, right now.

906
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,177
Come on, mother fucker, right here.

907
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,313
Mike, put the gun down!

908
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:32,883
What's a matter, shit head?

909
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:33,683
You ain't shit without that gun, right?

910
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:34,885
You ain't got nothing.

911
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,353
You are making this so easy. Nothing.

912
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:37,854
What's a matter with you guys?

913
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:41,258
Pay off is in 24 hours, less.

914
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,326
We don't need this punk Aurthur.

915
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,528
Wrong!

916
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:45,362
No, no, you can't trust this mother fucker,

917
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:46,196
that's what it is.

918
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,831
Jimmy, shut up!

919
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,901
Look Mike, you got the gun.

920
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:55,005
You got the gun, but you shoot Jimmy, it's over.

921
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,306
Now you think about that.

922
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:02,946
Mike, Mike in 36 hours, we're in South America.

923
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,348
We go our separate ways, 36 hours.

924
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,625
Jimmy, let it go.

925
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:20,897
Jimmy, for me, please let it go.

926
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:28,505
For you Art.

927
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,553
(Art sighing)

928
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:51,294
(pensive jazz music)

929
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,913
- [Art] Listen carefully.

930
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,748
Your daughter's safety depends on this.

931
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,249
I wanna talk to Jill.

932
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:14,718
Have your driver let you off

933
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:17,787
at the LaSalle and Van Buren elevator train stop.

934
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:20,223
Take the train north to Washington.

935
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,360
Get off, cross the street and go into the subway.

936
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,327
You'll see a--

937
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:27,831
(subway trains whirring)

938
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:31,868
W-K-2-S-W-B-D.

939
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,771
B-A-J-M-3.

940
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,374
Open that door.

941
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,809
There'll be a long narrow car, follow it.

942
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,978
(vehicles whirring)

943
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,680
Watching you at all locations.

944
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,951
At no time, make no attempt to communicate with anyone.

945
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,120
If you deviate from these instructions in any way,

946
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,422
you put your daughter in grave jeopardy.

947
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:55,859
(subway trains whirring)

948
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,728
Okay Mike, here we go.

949
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:02,165
(pensive music)

950
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:08,571
(intense jazz music) (subway trains whirring)

951
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:48,037
(footsteps stomping)

952
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:59,149
(train brakes squealing)

953
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:31,881
(rhythmic drums banging)

954
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:51,528
(intense jazz music)

955
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:24,260
(glass breaks)

956
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,363
(intense jazz music)

957
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:03,232
(alarm buzzing)

958
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,276
Um, my name is Dupont.

959
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,944
I'm suppose to pick something up.

960
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:20,216
(alarm buzzing)

961
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:37,667
(door squeaks)

962
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,336
Jimmy, uh.

963
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,507
About last night, I-- No.

964
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:19,275
I get it.

965
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:23,446
All that matters now baby is today.

966
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:27,316
(cars honking)

967
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:01,350
- [Jessica] They'll be waiting for him at the banks.

968
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,986
They won't know which one he's going to first.

969
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,433
Right now, he's at Continental Trust.

970
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,672
He's gotta stay in plain sight.

971
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,409
(overlapping chattering)

972
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,511
They're not warned, he couldn't leave the lobby.

973
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,614
They're gonna pump him for information.

974
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:33,249
Yeah, but Luce won't mess up now.

975
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:35,785
Not after meeting Quinn.

976
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,661
Most of those guys, those rich guys, I mean.

977
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:50,099
They usually get what they want, don't they?

978
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:50,933
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

979
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:53,369
You bet your luck.

980
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:57,874
(overlapping chattering)

981
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,711
One million dollars.

982
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:32,808
Art follows Luce to the second bank

983
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:35,378
where Quinn picks him up.

984
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:45,988
(cars honking)

985
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,591
That's brilliant.

986
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:50,560
I'm thinking that we're going to 10 banks

987
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,029
and we're really just going to one or two.

988
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:54,931
It's simple but that is brilliant.

989
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:03,906
Art's a visionary.

990
01:04:05,841 --> 01:04:06,676
A genius maybe.

991
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:09,779
In a fucked up kind of way.

992
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:48,017
Now the feds gotta think that he's moving on.

993
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,453
- [Jessica] To the third bank.

994
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:57,593
(overlapping chattering)

995
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:36,265
- [Jimmy] 30, 40 seconds of confusion and Luce on the fray.

996
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:41,937
(overlapping chattering)

997
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,653
That's gotta be a first.

998
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:00,189
When are thieves ever not greedy?

999
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:03,225
(pensive jazz music)

1000
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:46,729
(train bells chiming) (intense jazz music)

1001
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:09,585
(train whistles)

1002
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,655
(car engine humming)

1003
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:32,174
Well?

1004
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:33,108
What happened, how'd it go?

1005
01:08:33,108 --> 01:08:34,043
Jimmy, we hit every note.

1006
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:35,845
Hmm, baby it was beautiful.

1007
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:37,346
It as smooth.

1008
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:40,382
See, if Mike approves, you know it was cool.

1009
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:42,351
Ew Jimmy, you should have seen that case.

1010
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,320
I just wanted to grab it and run like hell.

1011
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,521
Didn't you Mike?

1012
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:47,423
- [Jimmy] What about Luce?

1013
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,959
Hey, he did everything we told him to.

1014
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,294
Once we lost the wire, he was ours.

1015
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,864
I'm telling you, this thing ran like a Swiss clock, man.

1016
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:55,998
Yeah, but don't forge the money.

1017
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:56,999
You don't have that yet Art.

1018
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:59,001
Baby, the money, I do not forget.

1019
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,670
(Jessica laughs)

1020
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:08,878
(gun clip snapping)

1021
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:14,316
- [Mike] You leave soon.

1022
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:16,785
- [Jimmy] Yeah, I know.

1023
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:19,088
Make sure you bring back the money.

1024
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:21,524
Quinn, if you touch that girl.

1025
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:28,931
I just want you to know.

1026
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:33,536
Jimmy, you wanna know something?

1027
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:34,570
- [Jimmy] What's that?

1028
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:37,173
That Michigan game.

1029
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,475
I had money on you guys.

1030
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:41,610
(laughs) Is that right?

1031
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:45,548
You know, I've been hearing that same shit for 14 years.

1032
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:47,383
You and everybody in the city of Chicago

1033
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:48,551
had money on that game.

1034
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,489
Hey, I'm not liking what I'm seeing here.

1035
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:57,026
I'll ignore it this time.

1036
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,494
This will cheer you guys up.

1037
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:02,831
Rio de Janeiro via Toronto.

1038
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:04,166
First class.

1039
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:08,504
Hours, gentlemen, hours.

1040
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:12,708
(waves crashing)

1041
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:23,752
Hey Jimmy, you all right?

1042
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:25,754
(scoffs) Yeah.

1043
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,557
Yeah, I'm all right.

1044
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:50,045
It's been 15 minutes, baby.

1045
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:52,548
You ready?

1046
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,385
Let's rock and roll.

1047
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:24,913
Mr. Luce?

1048
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:28,450
Mr. Luce.

1049
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:32,888
Mr. Luce.

1050
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:35,024
I've done everything you people want.

1051
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:36,859
Where's Jill, I want to see my daughter.

1052
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,661
That's where we're going.

1053
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,770
(suspenseful music)

1054
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,635
Now I want you to follow me out.

1055
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,203
I thought you'd be gone by now.

1056
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:24,239
Jessie?

1057
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:27,309
You don't look so good.

1058
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:28,744
I mean, you look good but.

1059
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:29,545
You know.

1060
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:31,480
Ray.

1061
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,451
This is my Uncle Art.

1062
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,487
Sir. Art's just in from Chicago.

1063
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,990
We gotta get a move on now, Uncle Art, come on.

1064
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:42,825
Wait.

1065
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:47,830
Are you Morgan Luce?

1066
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:58,974
Both of you, come with me.

1067
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:08,717
Shit.

1068
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:12,521
I feel like I won the damn lottery.

1069
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:13,856
Look, maybe we can make a deal, Ray.

1070
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:15,023
Deal?

1071
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:17,359
Look, I'm in the driver seat here darling.

1072
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:20,929
I'm taking that bag and I'm gonna drive like hell.

1073
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,631
Figure to be in Canada by day break.

1074
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:24,366
And you are coming with me.

1075
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,235
I'll treat you real fine.

1076
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,536
Ray, what about the guy.

1077
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,705
What are we gonna do about Luce?

1078
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:30,773
We'll have to kill him.

1079
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:31,673
I mean I'll do it.

1080
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:32,775
But you know.

1081
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:34,643
Shit, uh. We'll dump the body.

1082
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:35,878
We're gonna go-- I can't do this.

1083
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,112
Look, I'll take care of that, too.

1084
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,313
No, I can't do this.

1085
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:40,282
Jessica, two million dollars don't just drop

1086
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:41,784
in your lap every day!

1087
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:42,618
No Ray!

1088
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:44,052
You're coming!

1089
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:45,387
And I'm gonna fuck you.

1090
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:46,522
I'm gonna fuck you.

1091
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:47,990
You got it? You asshole.

1092
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:49,758
Watch how easy this is, huh.

1093
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,660
(Jessica grunting)

1094
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:56,665
- [Jessica] No, ow. (grunting)

1095
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:58,967
Okay, 441.

1096
01:13:58,967 --> 01:13:59,868
- [Morgan] What do you need?

1097
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,671
Down on your knees sir.

1098
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:03,472
Look, if it's the money, you can--

1099
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,073
On your damn knees!

1100
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:05,908
Please.

1101
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:08,644
My God, no.

1102
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:11,013
Ray, don'!

1103
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:12,581
Shut up. (gun bangs)

1104
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:14,783
(Jessica crying)

1105
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,185
Don't cry over him darling.

1106
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:18,787
I'm sure he lived a real sweet life.

1107
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:22,157
Pretty little blonde girlfriends, lots of rich food.

1108
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:23,425
He did okay.

1109
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:24,726
Big house, nice car.

1110
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:27,062
You bastard!

1111
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:28,897
I know you like me.

1112
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:30,132
I can tell at the market.

1113
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:35,404
(Jessica grunting)

1114
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:38,941
Now, that's a shame.

1115
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:39,775
Drop it.

1116
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,311
Easy.

1117
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:45,180
Now.

1118
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:48,150
Jimmy, thank God.

1119
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,751
I thought you were gone.

1120
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,687
Now, let's talk this out.

1121
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,089
When he didn't cuff you, I knew he was after the money.

1122
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,991
- [Jessica] Jesus, he shot Luce right there.

1123
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,126
(laughs) Figure how this looks.

1124
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,695
Shut the fuck up.

1125
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:00,863
Who are they gonna believe?

1126
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:02,030
They're gonna believe you killed him.

1127
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,233
I'm an officer of the law.

1128
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:05,167
Who the hell are you?

1129
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:07,569
Shut up and let me think.

1130
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:09,037
I'll say you took my gun.

1131
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:10,372
Jimmy, what are we gonna do?

1132
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:11,740
I'm telling-- Shut up man!

1133
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:13,642
(men scuffling and grunting)

1134
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:15,978
(gun bangs)

1135
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:24,453
Fucking cop.

1136
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:28,724
Can you believe this shit? (crying)

1137
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,399
Luce didn't deserve this.

1138
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:38,267
Come on baby.

1139
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:41,303
Jessica!

1140
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:43,272
Come on.

1141
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,974
(labored breathing)

1142
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:46,808
Jessie.

1143
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:54,016
(Jessica sobbing)

1144
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,214
- [Art] What do you think Mike?

1145
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:34,156
About the pictures.

1146
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:36,625
Original.

1147
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:41,863
I'm sorry Mike.

1148
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:43,765
It's just a whole lot of money.

1149
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,135
(gun bangs)

1150
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,348
(loud knocking)

1151
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:00,682
Help!

1152
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:02,351
Somebody let me out!

1153
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:14,363
Let me out! (banging)

1154
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:17,032
(Jill grunting)

1155
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:32,848
(van engine puttering)

1156
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:47,362
Come here, come here.

1157
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:48,196
(Jessica sobbing)

1158
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:49,264
Hold on, wait a minute.

1159
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:50,198
Baby, something's wrong.

1160
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:51,533
- [Art] Both of you freeze.

1161
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,936
What's going on Art?

1162
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:57,372
- [Art] I'm taking it all Jimmy.

1163
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:58,340
- [Jessica] Art, this isn't right.

1164
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,574
We can't leave Jimmy.

1165
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:01,910
- [Art] You're not coming Jessica.

1166
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:02,878
Where's Luce?

1167
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:04,279
He's dead Art.

1168
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:05,347
It's finished.

1169
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:06,381
- [Art] No, it's not.

1170
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:09,151
Not if that bag is full of money.

1171
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:14,189
Now Jimmy, you take that gun.

1172
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,058
Take it out slowly.

1173
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:17,292
Take it out!

1174
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:20,395
And throw it as far as you can into the woods.

1175
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:21,196
Throw it.

1176
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:26,668
Now, slowly, bring me that bag.

1177
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:28,904
Bring it to me.

1178
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,209
That's far enough, put it down.

1179
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:41,683
Where's Quinn?

1180
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:42,884
- [Art] Dead too.

1181
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:43,819
Open the bag.

1182
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:46,088
Open it!

1183
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,525
Now back off.

1184
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:52,627
Back off!

1185
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:00,802
You have to kill us too, Art.

1186
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,471
I know that Jimmy.

1187
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:08,543
You can't do this man.

1188
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,812
Don't you begin to lecture me.

1189
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:15,817
Art no! (guns banging)

1190
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:22,424
(Jessica sobbing)

1191
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,258
Huh?

1192
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,760
What are you doing?

1193
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:28,263
Not me right?

1194
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:29,865
(gun bangs) (Jessica yells)

1195
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:31,867
(guns banging)

1196
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:32,701
Jimmy!

1197
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:39,307
Jimmy! (sobbing)

1198
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:40,842
Oh God. Shh.

1199
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:45,180
(Jessica sobbing and yelling)

1200
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,582
Shh. (Jessica yelling)

1201
01:19:47,582 --> 01:19:49,351
Shh, all right.

1202
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:51,253
It's all right.

1203
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:52,521
I'm sorry baby.

1204
01:19:53,655 --> 01:19:54,489
I'm sorry.

1205
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:58,593
(Jessica grunting)

1206
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:36,198
(suspenseful music)

1207
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:53,315
Jill.

1208
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:55,584
You okay?

1209
01:20:58,253 --> 01:20:59,855
Jill, it's over.

1210
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,489
You bastard, if you're gonna kill me, just kill me.

1211
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:02,324
Wait.

1212
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:03,625
(Jill grunting)

1213
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:06,428
I said wait a minute, God damn it.

1214
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:08,530
Come on.

1215
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,502
The keys are in the van, now take it and get out.

1216
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:15,337
God.

1217
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:17,739
Your father.

1218
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:20,508
He's dead.

1219
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:25,914
Daddy. (sobs)

1220
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:27,415
How can you sleep?

1221
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:31,553
What?

1222
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:43,031
(pensive jazz music)

1223
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:53,808
(waves crashing)

1224
01:21:57,145 --> 01:22:00,181
(pensive jazz music)

1225
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:31,379
It's too bad you're gonna miss that boat.

1226
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:37,852
Jimmy.

1227
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:41,289
Art.

1228
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,161
We can split this.

1229
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:47,929
We can share a ride, it's a 40 footer.

1230
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:48,763
No.

1231
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:54,903
Well, what do you want to do?

1232
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:56,471
I ought to waste your ass right here.

1233
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,342
Don't even think about it.

1234
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:03,011
Throw it away.

1235
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:10,719
You had this planned from the start, didn't you?

1236
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,755
From day one.

1237
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:14,723
- [Jimmy] You're a fucking piece of shit, Art,

1238
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:15,657
you know that.

1239
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,158
It's a shitty world, Jimmy.

1240
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:18,860
I learned that.

1241
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,528
Look, you think I was gonna put up with this bullshit

1242
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:22,230
for a lousy 500,000 grand?

1243
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:25,333
I trusted you.

1244
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:28,236
I know.

1245
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:32,974
Don't do it.

1246
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,045
You don't understand Jimmy.

1247
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:39,414
I got to.

1248
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:40,782
Don't do it.

1249
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:43,118
(gun bangs)

1250
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:50,091
(Jimmy grunting)

1251
01:23:58,266 --> 01:24:03,004
Oh shit. (grunting)

1252
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:11,379
(Jimmy laughing)

1253
01:24:16,351 --> 01:24:19,087
(waves crashing)

1254
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:24,292
(Jimmy gasping)

1255
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:36,504
(Jimmy heavily sighs)

1256
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:42,010
(waves crashing)

1257
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:01,596
(pensive jazz music)
