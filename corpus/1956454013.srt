2
00:01:57,428 --> 00:01:59,362
Like, it's coming!

3
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:01,430
Come on, gang. Down here.

4
00:02:01,432 --> 00:02:02,765
Are you sure, Fred?

5
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:04,734
It doesn't look
very safe down there.

6
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:08,404
It's gotta be better
than what's out there.

7
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:10,874
Where? Where?
Where? Where?

8
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:11,674
Out there.

9
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:14,077
- No.
- Werewolf.

10
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:24,790
You guys hide in the alley.
I'll go get help.

11
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:36,969
It's a dead end.

12
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:40,737
Or it's gonna be for us. Look!

13
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:47,278
What are we going to do?

14
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:53,019
What we always do, Daphne.

15
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:56,622
Solve this mystery.

16
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:08,432
Yes!

17
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:09,734
Just as I thought.

18
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,704
Old man Wither's son,
young man Withers.

19
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:15,106
- Of course.
- Great job, Fred.

20
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:19,777
Once again, you and the Mystery
Machine have saved the day.

21
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:21,579
But what about
the other monsters?

22
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:23,548
I think it's time
to round 'em up.

23
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,684
But first...

24
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:51,576
Now, for a little Monster Mash.

And now, for the unmasking.

40
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:07,020
Of course,
it's the whole Withers family.

41
00:05:07,022 --> 00:05:09,256
And we would've
gotten away with it, too,

42
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:11,758
if it weren't
for you meddling kids.

43
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,363
- Great going, Freddie.
- We all did it together.

44
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:16,863
We're awesome.

45
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:19,168
And don't forget
the Mystery Machine.

46
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:20,633
Thank you.

47
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:28,510
No!

48
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:33,548
No!

49
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,716
Freddie! Freddie!

50
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:38,588
Mystery Machine!
Where are you?

51
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:41,555
Freddie, are you okay?

52
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:43,991
Yeah. I... I must've dozed off.

53
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:46,927
I had a terrible dream that
I lost the Mystery Machine.

54
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,264
Oh, man, what a nightmare.

55
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,703
Um, Freddie.
The Mystery Machine is gone.

56
00:05:57,374 --> 00:06:00,543
Ah, that's right. I sold it.

57
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:04,912
Don't worry, Fred.

58
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:06,114
You aren't
the only one depressed

59
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,483
about Mystery Inc.
closing up shop.

60
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:13,922
I've got an entire section on my <i>Big
Blog of Mysteries</i> called <i>Unsolved Capers.</i>

61
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:16,792
And I guess, now, they'll
forever remain unsolved.

62
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:20,529
Which, to be honest,
makes me a little crazy.

63
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:26,435
- You have a blog?
- Yes.

64
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:29,873
Which you know,
because you've all subscribed, right?

65
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,678
Listen, I know things
haven't been the same

66
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,214
since the sheriff lectured us
about staying out of trouble.

67
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:42,617
Uh, of course, some things
haven't changed at all.

68
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:45,921
Forty-one, 42.

69
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:48,623
Forty-two sandwiches.

70
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,693
I bet I can eat 'em
in 42 seconds.

71
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:53,096
Forty-one.

72
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,698
Well, I don't know
about you guys.

73
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,767
But I'm itching
to solve a mystery.

74
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:01,437
But we don't have
a mystery to solve.

75
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,372
Maybe we solved them all.

76
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:05,808
<i>Eye-witnesses report a
mysterious, ghost-like creature</i>

77
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,677
<i>that floated through the scene,</i>

78
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:11,180
<i>promising horrible doom and
destruction to all onlookers.</i>

79
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,282
They say
the vegetable cannery's

80
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:16,319
haunted by a laughing
green gargantuan.

81
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:19,355
That's true. Every night
the ancient ghost materializes

82
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:22,692
and asks passers-by
how to program a VCR.

83
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:26,064
- What's a VCR?
- I don't know.

84
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,898
Well, gang,

85
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,800
looks like we've got
an embarrassment of riches.

86
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:33,537
Nope. No, siree.

87
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:36,206
The sheriff told us
to stay out of trouble.

88
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,674
From now on,
the only mystery I care about

89
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:40,244
is how to get
the rest of the ketchup

90
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:41,612
out of this bottle.

91
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:43,781
Yeah.

92
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:47,117
- Ketchup.
- But Shaggy...

93
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:48,485
No buts.

94
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:51,622
We've been to every haunted
house, park and carnival

95
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:54,558
north, south, east and west
of the Mississippi.

96
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,695
- Plus the Mississippi.
- Oh, yeah, the Riverboat Wraith.

97
00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:01,365
Well, we've had it up to here.

98
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:04,868
I guess we have used you
as live bait a few times.

99
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,271
A few times, daily.

100
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:10,007
Well, maybe you do
deserve a break.

101
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:13,311
Okay, Shaggy and Scooby,
you've made your point.

102
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:14,345
No more mysteries.

103
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:17,147
Ah-ah-ah-ah,
we've heard that before.

104
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:19,317
We're gonna need
more than that.

105
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,187
Raise your right hands
and swear.

106
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:24,690
- That's a menu.
- Oh, they know.

107
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:26,790
Repeat after me.

108
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,825
We, like, solemnly swear,

109
00:08:28,827 --> 00:08:32,263
to, like, not solve
any more mysteries, man.

110
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:34,165
We, like, solemnly swear,

111
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:37,135
to, like, not solve
any more mysteries, man.

112
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:41,406
And a promise is like a promise
that can't be unpromised

113
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:46,144
unless the promiser,
gets permission from the promisee.

114
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:47,946
You dig?

115
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:51,416
And a promise is
like a promise that can't be unpromised

116
00:08:51,418 --> 00:08:54,486
unless the promiser...

117
00:08:56,957 --> 00:08:58,691
Uh... Yeah.

118
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:00,359
Court adjourned.

119
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:03,962
All right. It's official.

120
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:06,398
Mystery Inc.
is closed for business.

121
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,169
Good. Best to leave the mystery
solving for the professionals.

122
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:11,769
You guys have been
running around,

123
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:13,138
looking for trouble
for so long,

124
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,541
you've forgotten
how to just be kids.

125
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:17,042
Opening lemonade stands,

126
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:19,445
playing kick the can,
talent shows in the barns,

127
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:22,915
sock hops,
potato sack races, eh?

128
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,850
He's not wrong.

129
00:09:24,852 --> 00:09:28,187
- About the sock hops?
- About everything.

130
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:31,890
What you need to do is treat
yourself to a vacation.

131
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:35,194
Get away from the city.
Go have some fun.

132
00:09:35,196 --> 00:09:38,397
You know, that sounds
like a great idea.

133
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,735
Maybe it'll take
my mind off of her.

134
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:43,802
- Seconded.
- Where could we go?

135
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:46,205
Oh, I know.
Maybe an amusement park.

136
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:46,939
No!

137
00:09:46,941 --> 00:09:49,074
No way, no how.

138
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:51,877
No amusement parks
that ended up being haunted.

139
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,812
Or zoos with demon animals.

140
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:56,148
- No...
- Opera phantoms.

141
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,086
Right. In fact, no theaters
with phantoms of any kind.

142
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:01,521
We're gonna stay right here

143
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:04,823
and watch our favorite show
on that TV.

144
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:09,963
Hello, sweeties.
It's me, Elvira.

145
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:13,133
Your spook-tacular hostess
with the mostest.

146
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:15,035
Back with more
cinematic turkeys

147
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:18,171
that really put
the horrible in horror.

148
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:20,373
I never understood
why you two chickens

149
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,942
love watching
these terrible movies.

150
00:10:22,944 --> 00:10:24,978
Because these cheesy monsters
are the only kind

151
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,913
that Scoob and I
aren't afraid of.

152
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:28,915
Cheese.

153
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:33,253
Okay, before we start tonight's
monstrous marathon of mediocre movies,

154
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:36,122
I got a spine-tingling
treat for you.

155
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:38,592
My spine's tingling already.

156
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:44,831
An anonymous sponsor has offered
to provide my most fang-tastic fan

157
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,933
an all expense-paid vacation

158
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:50,037
to a tropical paradise.

159
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,473
Hey! An island retreat
sounds fun.

160
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:53,907
It sure does.

161
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:56,344
Like, nothing bad's ever
happened in paradise.

162
00:10:56,346 --> 00:10:59,180
I'd wish you good fortune,
but you're already out

163
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:02,350
'cause I've seen our next
movie, <i>Predator Jones.</i>

164
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:04,618
It'll take
your breath away.

165
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,755
If you're lucky.

166
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:16,567
Drum roll, please.

167
00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:25,239
Ladies and gentlemen,
my agent.

168
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:29,143
Uh, where was I?

169
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:31,179
Oh, right. The hapless rube...

170
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:34,716
Uh, I mean,
vacation winner is...

171
00:11:34,718 --> 00:11:36,086
Is the suspense killing you?

172
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,489
Con-bat-ulations to...

173
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,259
Shaggy Rogers.

174
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:48,764
Shaggy is allowed to bring up
to three guests along with him.

175
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:50,000
And one pet.

176
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,701
Pet? Really?

177
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,903
Uh... Oh, that's
what it says here, folks.

178
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:58,608
All right, after the break,
I'll answer your questions.

179
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,710
See you soon, sweeties.

180
00:12:00,712 --> 00:12:04,212
We're going on vacation! We're going on vacation!

181
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:07,015
Huh. That's awfully convenient.

182
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,351
I... Uh, no. Never mind.

183
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:13,288
We promised not to look for another
mystery and I keep my promises.

184
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,427
I choose to believe
it is in no way mysterious.

185
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:20,730
Yeah, I guess you're right.

186
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,665
I wonder when we get to go.

187
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,135
No mystery there.

188
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:26,335
Like, right now.

189
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:28,640
Yeah, now.

190
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:38,181
Man, I could get used to island life.

191
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:39,850
How about you, Scoob?

192
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:42,153
Yeah, it's the best.

193
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:47,891
Yep. It sure is nice
out here on the open sea.

194
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,092
No mysteries,
no worries.

195
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:52,565
What?

196
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:55,466
Ah! It's not there.

197
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:58,469
There is absolutely
nothing mysterious going on.

198
00:12:58,471 --> 00:12:59,536
Nothing.

199
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:01,170
Whew. Yeah,
you promised the sheriff,

200
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:03,206
not to mention
Shaggy and Scooby.

201
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,908
Hey, Fred, what are you doing?

202
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,810
Me? Uh, nothing.

203
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:09,513
Not thinking about the stuff that
I promised not to think about.

204
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:11,915
You?
You guys good?

205
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,650
Don't worry, Fred.
We get it.

206
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:16,286
It's hard to think about
anything but solving mysteries.

207
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:18,121
Why, I was about to
try and solve the mystery

208
00:13:18,123 --> 00:13:20,357
of how all these trees
in this tropical paradise

209
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,092
don't look tropical at all.

210
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:25,028
But then I reminded her that
we promised Scooby and Shaggy

211
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,798
we wouldn't
solve any mysteries.

212
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,966
Big or small.

213
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:30,200
I mean,
look how happy they are.

214
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:37,140
I know.

215
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:38,442
Why don't we ask
the ferry captain

216
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,310
how long
before we reach the island?

217
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:42,947
Then all we'll need to worry about
is how much fun we're having.

218
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:44,216
Great idea.

219
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:49,119
Excuse me, Captain.

220
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,556
Where did you say this island
was that we're going to?

221
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:55,762
The darkest reaches of Davy Jones's
Locker, if you ask me.

222
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:59,130
Oh-kay.

223
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:01,466
And I thought
I was having a bad day.

224
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:04,536
You seem scared, sir.
Are you all right?

225
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:07,105
I'm past scared or all right.

226
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,340
Tomorrow is my last trip
to the island

227
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:12,644
on account
of... the zombies.

228
00:14:12,646 --> 00:14:15,146
Gee... If I cared
about solving mysteries,

229
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:17,148
I might be thinking
about that other time

230
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,050
we went to an island
filled with zombies.

231
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:22,688
It's too bad I'm no longer
using my <i>Big Blog of Mysteries.</i>

232
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,991
Why one might find such
information about that encounter

233
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:28,393
on the "unsolved" page.

234
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:30,462
But, of course,
there's no need to do that.

235
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:32,998
I'm sure when the captain
refers to zombies,

236
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,600
he's just using slang.

237
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:36,936
He's probably
just talking about them.

238
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:45,109
I think we may have reached
our sausage limit for the day.

239
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:46,280
I agree.

240
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:56,388
We're here.
But mind you,

241
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,491
I'll be returning tomorrow
for the last time.

242
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:02,261
Just before
the sun sets low.

243
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:05,199
You'd be wise
to be back aboard.

244
00:15:05,801 --> 00:15:07,335
Or else...

245
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,270
Or else we'll have
way too much fun.

246
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:12,371
Am I right, gang?

247
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:13,709
Thanks for the ride.

248
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:22,916
See, it actually
does look tropical.

249
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:24,451
No need to worry at all.

250
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:27,420
And look,
native islanders.

251
00:15:27,422 --> 00:15:30,692
I bet they're here to give
us a real island greeting.

252
00:15:31,526 --> 00:15:33,927
Hi, I'm Fred. And, uh...

253
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:36,365
Get out.

254
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:38,698
Hmm, that's odd.

255
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,734
Did he just say
to get out?

256
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:42,602
I choose to believe that it's
some sort of island greeting,

257
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:44,437
- like <i>aloha.</i>
- Gotcha.

258
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:46,408
Get out to you too.

259
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:48,475
Get out.

260
00:15:48,477 --> 00:15:50,845
Yes. Get out, everyone.

261
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:53,382
Oh, so friendly.
I just love island life.

262
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:56,917
Get out.

263
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,252
Thanks. That's what
we're trying to do.

264
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:01,589
Get out
and get to relaxing.

265
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:04,259
Yeah, uh, get to relaxing.

266
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:08,129
Get out.

267
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:09,563
You must go
before it's too late.

268
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:11,866
The island is infested
with zombies.

269
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:16,003
And if you don't leave,
you could become one too.

270
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:18,541
Did you say zombies?

271
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:24,779
Well, then if I was a person that
was curious about such phenomena

272
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:27,149
I'd probably
want to investigate that.

273
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:30,718
But since I'm not,
I guess I'll, uh...

274
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,888
I'll just go now.

275
00:16:35,658 --> 00:16:36,693
Tourists.

276
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:02,251
This is a terrible van.

277
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,353
I'm just saying
as vans go,

278
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:06,655
this one's pretty basic.

279
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,924
One color, no flower decals,

280
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:11,493
no name written on the side,
I mean...

281
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:13,096
What's it even called?

282
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,531
The van.

283
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:16,867
Mmm-hmm.

284
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,637
Hmm. Boy, can
those two relax.

285
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:26,809
Yeah, I guess small talk
isn't our thing, is it?

286
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,677
Usually we're trying
to figure out

287
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,948
how to escape some monster
or who did what, where.

288
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,418
We've never really
just sat around and talked.

289
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,887
Well, maybe we should start.

290
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,257
Who saw
the big game last night?

291
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:47,497
So, Velma,

292
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,365
uh, what's your
favorite thing to do

293
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,835
besides solving mysteries?

294
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,905
There is nothing else.

295
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,388
Scooby, how are you, buddy?

296
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:14,624
Look out!

297
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,311
- That's weird.
- What, Velma?

298
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:38,315
It looks as though someone
deliberately cut this tree down

299
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,184
and pushed it
into the road.

300
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:43,387
And from the looks of it,
it seems like they used something sharp.

301
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,623
Like a claw.

302
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,258
Hmm?

303
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,494
Uh, like something we don't
have to worry about.

304
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,032
Absolutely. I mean,
trees fall all the time.

305
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,668
Even trees made out of...

306
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,002
- Plastic?
- Listen!

307
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,637
Dudes, I know
there's mysterious stuff

308
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,073
around every corner,

309
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,676
but you promised.

310
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,476
You're right, Shaggy.

311
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,113
And we are going to keep
our promise no matter what.

312
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,048
Right, gang?

313
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,150
Right. No matter what.

314
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,952
Right. No matter what.

315
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:15,220
Good.

316
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,424
Now, how about
we get back to that vacation?

317
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,833
Anybody else hear that?

318
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,739
Sorry, that's my phone.

319
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:39,178
Anyway, looks like something's
slashed my van's tire.

320
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,912
- Good.
- What?

321
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,248
Uh... Nothing.

322
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,949
Eh, probably some sharp rocks.

323
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:47,219
- Or claws. I mean, a nail.
- Mmm-hmm.

324
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:48,988
Hmm.

325
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,257
Right. Nothing
out of the ordinary.

326
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,759
I guess we'll just have to
hike the rest of the way.

327
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:56,594
Ah! What a great way
to start a vacation.

328
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,132
Right, gang?

329
00:19:59,066 --> 00:19:59,967
Yes.

330
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:03,470
This is really going great.

331
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:20,186
Moonstar Island Resort?

332
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:21,620
Haven't we stayed here before?

333
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:24,090
I'm sure it's just
part of a chain.

334
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:26,959
I think Daphne's
thinking of Moonscar.

335
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:29,495
The island we visited
with the zombies.

336
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:31,932
And the cat people. And danger.

337
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:34,435
The island
that's clearly not this one.

338
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:40,740
Say,

339
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:42,175
are you guys suggesting

340
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:44,476
that there's something
mysterious going on here?

341
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:45,845
- No.
- Not at all.

342
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:47,914
- She was just, uh...
- Reminiscing.

343
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:51,351
Yeah, about that summer when I
was working at that TV station

344
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:52,519
<i>for my school project.</i>

345
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:54,220
<i>Like, yeah, we know.</i>

346
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:55,655
<i>I was determined</i>

347
00:20:55,657 --> 00:20:57,524
<i>to find an actual
supernatural case</i>

348
00:20:57,526 --> 00:20:59,292
<i>not just another guy in a mask.</i>

349
00:20:59,294 --> 00:21:01,094
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

350
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:04,731
<i>We searched everywhere,
including Moonscar Island.</i>

351
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,466
<i>Like,
we know all this.</i>

352
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:09,136
<i>There we met a series
of very unusual people.</i>

353
00:21:09,138 --> 00:21:11,405
<i>Lena, Simone, Jacques,</i>

354
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:13,540
<i>and who could forget
Snakebite Scrubbs.</i>

355
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:14,908
<i>Not us.</i>

356
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,676
<i>'Cause, like,
we were there.</i>

357
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:18,279
<i>We arrived at a house</i>

358
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:20,880
<i>that looked
a lot like this hotel.</i>

359
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:23,184
<i>But then we were
attacked by zombies.</i>

360
00:21:23,186 --> 00:21:24,885
<i>But we found out
that the zombies</i>

361
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:26,954
<i>were actually victims
of the cat people.</i>

362
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:28,990
<i>who had been draining innocent
bystanders of their life force</i>

363
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:32,093
<i>in order to stay alive
for over 200 years.</i>

364
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:33,394
<i>Right.</i>

365
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:35,363
<i>The cat people
were originally villagers</i>

366
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:37,631
<i>who survived the pirate
Morgan Moonscar</i>

367
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:40,835
<i>when he landed on the island
to bury his treasure.</i>

368
00:21:40,837 --> 00:21:44,138
<i>The villagers had called
upon their cat-god or something</i>

369
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,706
<i>to get revenge.</i>

370
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,542
<i>So he changed them
into werecats.</i>

371
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:49,478
<i>Werecats.</i>

372
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:53,147
<i>They were going to
steal our life-force, too.</i>

373
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:55,783
<i>Something they could only do
during the harvest moon.</i>

374
00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:59,123
<i>But we were able to stop them
and they melted into nothing.</i>

375
00:22:01,724 --> 00:22:03,824
You know, I was
never really satisfied

376
00:22:03,826 --> 00:22:05,626
with how that whole thing
turned out.

377
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:06,927
Since we're back,

378
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:08,964
we could break
this thing wide open.

379
00:22:08,966 --> 00:22:11,835
Break? As in break a promise?

380
00:22:13,103 --> 00:22:17,739
Besides, this says Moonstar.
Not Moonscar.

381
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:20,308
Plus, did you see
the palm trees and the sand?

382
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,613
The only thing we have to do
on this island, man, is relax.

383
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:44,866
It's beautiful.

384
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:47,738
Thank you.
It's my pride and joy.

385
00:22:48,772 --> 00:22:50,039
And you are?

386
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,408
I'm Shaggy Rogers,
the contest winner.

387
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,110
Shaggy Rogers?

388
00:22:54,112 --> 00:22:55,044
Wonderful name.

389
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:57,313
I'm Alan,
the hotel manager.

390
00:22:57,315 --> 00:22:58,713
We've been expecting you.

391
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:02,285
Welcome to
Moonstar Island Resort.

392
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:03,986
Why don't you
sign our guest book,

393
00:23:03,988 --> 00:23:05,620
while I check you in.

394
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:06,891
Happily.

395
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:13,996
Hmm. I'm sure there's a
perfectly reasonable explanation

396
00:23:13,998 --> 00:23:15,932
for the guestbook pages
being ripped out.

397
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:17,102
Isn't there, Alan?

398
00:23:18,103 --> 00:23:19,137
Moths.

399
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:23,373
Now, if you'll follow me,

400
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,807
here at Moonstar,

401
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,943
we take pride
in our luxury accommodations,

402
00:23:26,945 --> 00:23:28,845
and the safety
of our guests.

403
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:30,113
As you can see,

404
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:32,048
we have the highest
security standards

405
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,151
to make sure you have
a pleasant stay.

406
00:23:34,153 --> 00:23:36,786
Wow. That's a lot of cameras.

407
00:23:36,788 --> 00:23:39,456
Only for your protection,
I assure you.

408
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,325
Why would we
need protection?

409
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:44,660
Gee, Fred, it sounds like you're
asking about something mysterious.

410
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:47,397
You wouldn't be doing
that, now, would you?

411
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,299
No, Shaggy, not at all.

412
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:50,801
Just curious.

413
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:52,803
This is my wonderful staff.

414
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:57,007
The finest of the fine.
The cream of the crop, as they say.

415
00:23:57,009 --> 00:24:01,278
That's Jack, Linda,
Mona and Bugbite Stubbs.

416
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,715
They'll be here to help you,
should the need arise.

417
00:24:04,717 --> 00:24:06,618
Why, those names
don't sound at all

418
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,886
like the other names
from the other island adventure

419
00:24:08,888 --> 00:24:10,287
that we're not talking about.

420
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:13,290
Well, when you hear
something suspicious,

421
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:16,461
I guess the best thing to do
is ignore it.

422
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:22,067
Huh? Everyone seems so...

423
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:24,135
Attractive?

424
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:26,072
Yes, well,
that's because we have...

425
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:30,243
standards.

426
00:24:36,782 --> 00:24:38,116
But soft!

427
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:40,885
What light
through yonder window breaks?

428
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:44,422
It is the east,
and you are the sun.

429
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:46,659
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

430
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:49,796
Oh! Nice to meet you too.

431
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,934
Say, you wouldn't happen to have a
place to eat around here, would you?

432
00:24:55,936 --> 00:24:59,405
All this excitement
has me and my buddy famished.

433
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:02,308
Yes, and it's all free.

434
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,708
Free?

435
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,811
Yes, and we serve only the
finest of fine cuisine.

436
00:25:06,813 --> 00:25:08,447
Including...

437
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:12,119
an unlimited supply
of gold wrapped Scooby snacks.

438
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,587
Am I in heaven?

439
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,191
Yes, and heaven
is just offstage right.

440
00:25:19,193 --> 00:25:20,794
All you can eat.

441
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:27,766
We'll take that as a challenge.

442
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:32,139
- Right, Scooby-Doo?
- Challenge accepted.

443
00:26:02,003 --> 00:26:04,704
Now, are there any
questions, concerns?

444
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:08,375
- Ow!
- I don't know, Daphne, any concerns?

445
00:26:08,377 --> 00:26:10,910
Maybe about what might
be on the island?

446
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:13,446
Something lurking
in the shadows?

447
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,048
But we are not worried.

448
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,549
Not even a little bit curious

449
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:19,519
about what the ferry captain
told us on the way here.

450
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:21,187
And what is that?

451
00:26:21,189 --> 00:26:23,189
Oh, he mentioned
something about the island

452
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:25,327
being filled with zombies.

453
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,966
We mustn't talk about that.

454
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:36,404
It is the island's, uh,
greatest mystery.

455
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:38,238
Mystery.

456
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:40,741
Which means...

457
00:26:40,743 --> 00:26:44,846
Maybe we should, uh,
join the guys for some food.

458
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:51,485
Oh, boy.

459
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:54,155
I think I hurt my neck on that
last go-around on the buffet.

460
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:57,958
Well, might I suggest
a nice, relaxing massage?

461
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,226
Yes, you might.

462
00:26:59,228 --> 00:27:01,862
I'm up for anything
nice and relaxing.

463
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:03,230
Me too.

464
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:06,167
Excellent.
We've got a five star masseuse,

465
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:10,438
who will work any knots
out of your food-laden bodies.

466
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,439
Uh, shiatsu?

467
00:27:11,441 --> 00:27:13,242
No, Great Dane.

468
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:19,080
This bathrobe is the comfiest
thing I have ever felt.

469
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:20,451
What do you think, Scoob?

470
00:27:21,785 --> 00:27:23,052
Uh-huh.

471
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:31,526
Wow. This is nice.

472
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:35,532
I can feel the years of fear and
anxiety floating away already.

473
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,604
Look, Scooby-Doo,
our masseuses are here.

474
00:27:42,606 --> 00:27:45,642
It's time to loosen up
the old muscles.

475
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,011
Oh, fabo.

476
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:00,055
I know, not much to look at.

477
00:28:00,057 --> 00:28:02,560
You really have your work
cut out for you, huh?

478
00:28:06,664 --> 00:28:09,601
Wow! Your hands
are really cold, dude.

479
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:13,003
Ooh, freezing.

480
00:28:19,477 --> 00:28:22,612
Scooby, I know that the gang
is having a hard time

481
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:24,946
not jumping at shadows
and solving mysteries,

482
00:28:24,948 --> 00:28:26,716
but I think
it's for the best.

483
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:28,117
Maybe... Aah!

484
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:30,088
They should get a massage, too.

485
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:33,489
Ow! A little softer, would you?

486
00:28:33,491 --> 00:28:36,626
I have really sensitive skin
due to over nutrition.

487
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:38,630
Not me. Dig in.

488
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:41,164
Ow!

489
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,900
Just a little lighter, please.

490
00:28:42,902 --> 00:28:45,501
I'm extremely fragile.

491
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:49,642
Zombies!

492
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:51,209
Zombies?

493
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:06,022
And over here,

494
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:08,792
we have our shuffleboard room,
pool room,

495
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:10,262
and finally, garage.

496
00:29:10,763 --> 00:29:12,061
Jeepers.

497
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:13,931
You sure have
thought of everything.

498
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:17,100
Yes, and we have
so much more in store.

499
00:29:23,844 --> 00:29:25,211
No, it couldn't be.

500
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:30,681
Sure sounds like her,
but it's not.

501
00:29:30,683 --> 00:29:34,284
It just can't be.
All right, hold on, Fred.

502
00:29:37,156 --> 00:29:40,224
Don't open that door.
You promised.

503
00:29:50,303 --> 00:29:52,204
Huh?

504
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,208
Are you all right?

505
00:29:57,911 --> 00:29:59,544
Massage. Attack.

506
00:29:59,546 --> 00:30:00,747
Cold hands.

507
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:08,686
I'm afraid your friend must have
hurt himself during the fall.

508
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:10,788
I can't understand
a word he's saying.

509
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,826
No. They're saying
that during their massage,

510
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:17,662
two zombies appeared and
attacked them with cold hands.

511
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:21,499
How could you
possibly know that?

512
00:30:21,501 --> 00:30:24,304
Oh, I'm fluent
in panic-Shaggy and Scooby.

513
00:30:25,472 --> 00:30:26,672
Zombies?

514
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:28,807
Then the legend is true.
We've...

515
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:32,011
Got a case of someone who has
an overactive imagination.

516
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:33,779
- Huh?
- Huh?

517
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:36,281
You heard the part
about the zombie, right?

518
00:30:36,283 --> 00:30:38,517
Of course,
but as a woman of science,

519
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,920
I know there is
no such thing as...

520
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,588
"zombies."

521
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,055
There isn't?

522
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:45,524
No, of course not.

523
00:30:45,526 --> 00:30:47,826
So it stands to reason
that what you saw

524
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:49,495
wasn't a zombie at all.

525
00:30:49,497 --> 00:30:51,263
But what else
could it have been?

526
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,599
Well, since it was
at the spa,

527
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:57,871
I can only assume it was probably
other guests with mud masks on.

528
00:30:57,873 --> 00:31:00,072
Mud masks? Really?

529
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:01,574
It does make more sense

530
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:03,910
than flesh-eating,
undead monsters.

531
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:05,146
Mm-hmm.

532
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:07,279
Ugh.

533
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:09,615
Daphne's right,
it was probably nothing.

534
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,418
I mean, if there was
a real zombie lurking around,

535
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,589
Scooby and Shaggy
would be nowhere near...

536
00:31:15,591 --> 00:31:17,958
Hey! Where's Scooby and Shaggy?

537
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,159
Like, I know
where this is going, buddy.

538
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:22,762
First, there's nothing
and then...

539
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:23,964
There's something.

540
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,264
Exactly.

541
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:27,132
I say we hide out here.

542
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:29,402
And only venture out
to grab some food.

543
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:30,770
Speaking of which,

544
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:33,907
I've got my emergency
hiding snack satchel

545
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:35,508
for just such an occasion.

546
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,911
Good thinking, Shaggy.

547
00:31:37,913 --> 00:31:41,314
I know. Like, no one
will ever find us down here.

548
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:51,660
Ow!

549
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:00,402
Oh?

550
00:32:01,804 --> 00:32:04,672
Hey! Haven't we
been here before?

551
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:05,875
Hmm?

552
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:09,812
Cat people.

553
00:32:10,947 --> 00:32:12,113
Cat people?

554
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:13,414
But that doesn't
make any sense.

555
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:15,282
We're on a completely
different island.

556
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,919
Huh?

557
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:20,287
Scooby-Doo,

558
00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:22,289
please tell me
that's your stomach.

559
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:23,493
Uh-uh.

560
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,699
Not again.

561
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:42,944
Scooby? Shaggy?

562
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:44,946
How long are we going
to keep this promise

563
00:32:44,948 --> 00:32:46,748
to not solve any mysteries?

564
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,483
I mean, there's a lot of strange
things happening around here.

565
00:32:49,485 --> 00:32:52,954
And I'm dying to figure out
what is going on.

566
00:32:52,956 --> 00:32:53,955
Bad choice of words.

567
00:32:53,957 --> 00:32:55,424
You're choosing words

568
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:57,826
and I'm barely
keeping it together over here.

569
00:32:57,828 --> 00:33:02,064
I mean, did you see the way the
staff reacted to the word "zombie"?

570
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:03,832
I know.

571
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:06,702
But we can't let
Scooby and Shaggy down.

572
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:09,138
They've followed us
through a million mysteries.

573
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,774
The least we can do is stick our
heads in the sand and avoid this one.

574
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:16,478
I know you're right,
but it's so hard.

575
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,081
Maybe after we find
Scooby and Shaggy

576
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,449
we can occupy our minds
with something else.

577
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:22,051
Like shuffleboard

578
00:33:22,053 --> 00:33:25,353
or whatever you're
supposed to do on vacation.

579
00:33:25,355 --> 00:33:27,190
Sounds like a plan, Velma.

580
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:29,293
Scooby! Shaggy!

581
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:34,362
Scoob! Shaggy!

582
00:33:57,689 --> 00:33:58,556
Huh?

583
00:34:01,193 --> 00:34:02,825
Find anything,
Freddie?

584
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:04,660
Nothing.

585
00:34:04,662 --> 00:34:06,429
She's not out there at all.

586
00:34:06,431 --> 00:34:08,065
It's just a trick of the light.

587
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:10,934
- She?
- Uh, I mean they.

588
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:12,401
They're not out there.

589
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:14,138
Did I say she?

590
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,471
That's weird.

591
00:34:15,473 --> 00:34:17,875
But, no, not like,
this is a mystery weird.

592
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,781
That should do it.

593
00:34:23,783 --> 00:34:25,481
What's gotten into you two?

594
00:34:25,483 --> 00:34:27,217
Like, what we've been saying.

595
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,318
Zombies. They're everywhere.

596
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,621
Zombies?

597
00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:32,856
We must run. Hide.

598
00:34:32,858 --> 00:34:35,092
Boys. We've already
been through this.

599
00:34:35,094 --> 00:34:37,995
There's no proof that zombies
are haunting the island.

600
00:34:37,997 --> 00:34:39,530
Let's be reasonable.

601
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:43,936
It's coming from outside.

602
00:34:59,186 --> 00:35:01,052
Do those look like mud masks?

603
00:35:01,054 --> 00:35:02,319
Kind of.

604
00:35:02,321 --> 00:35:04,090
What are we going to do?
We're doomed.

605
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:07,391
Uh...
Let me try that again.

606
00:35:07,393 --> 00:35:10,561
What are we going to do?
We're doomed!

607
00:35:10,563 --> 00:35:11,863
So much better.

608
00:35:15,135 --> 00:35:18,303
I'm sorry,
I must have fainted.

609
00:35:18,305 --> 00:35:19,637
What are we going to do?

610
00:35:21,508 --> 00:35:24,309
I was wondering
if there was any dessert or...

611
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:26,911
Dessert? At a time like this?

612
00:35:26,913 --> 00:35:29,480
There's a horde of zombies
outside this hotel

613
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:31,115
and you want to eat
chocolate pudding?

614
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:33,585
Chocolate pudding?
That sounds great.

615
00:35:33,587 --> 00:35:36,188
- I'll take one.
- Me too.

616
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,526
How can you think
of eating at a time like this?

617
00:35:40,061 --> 00:35:40,993
Yeah.

618
00:35:40,995 --> 00:35:41,963
Don't think...

619
00:35:42,929 --> 00:35:44,230
do.

620
00:35:44,232 --> 00:35:46,831
- We don't even have pudding.
- We brought our own.

621
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:50,002
Regardless, the zombies
are gonna be here any second.

622
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,076
Or, maybe minute.

623
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:02,413
Half hour, tops.

624
00:36:02,415 --> 00:36:05,383
Aren't you
professional mystery-solvers?

625
00:36:05,385 --> 00:36:08,487
Can't you solve the mystery
that's happening right outside?

626
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:11,523
We'd really,
really love to help.

627
00:36:11,525 --> 00:36:13,459
But we promised
Scooby and Shaggy

628
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:15,661
that we wouldn't
solve any more mysteries.

629
00:36:15,663 --> 00:36:19,565
And a promise is a promise
is a promise.

630
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:20,968
Remember, guys?

631
00:36:22,837 --> 00:36:26,805
I mean, uh, the only thing
that could break a promise

632
00:36:26,807 --> 00:36:29,242
is the person that they
promised the promise to

633
00:36:29,244 --> 00:36:32,178
saying that they could
break the promise.

634
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,846
I get it. I don't.

635
00:36:33,848 --> 00:36:36,349
That's right. The people
that made us promise

636
00:36:36,351 --> 00:36:39,718
just have to say it's okay
for us to break that promise.

637
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,521
What? Who cares about promises?

638
00:36:42,523 --> 00:36:44,357
There are zombies outside.

639
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:45,625
We care.

640
00:36:45,627 --> 00:36:47,426
We made Shaggy
and Scooby a promise

641
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:49,396
and we're gonna stand by it.

642
00:36:51,366 --> 00:36:53,669
Oh!

643
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,407
We hereby exercise
the takesies-baksies clause

644
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:02,008
to release you of the promise
to stop solving mysteries.

645
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,544
- Oh, thank you, guys.
- Oh, finally.

646
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:07,214
Wonderful.

647
00:37:07,216 --> 00:37:09,482
Now, the zombies!

648
00:37:09,484 --> 00:37:10,684
First things first,

649
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,253
we need to secure
the perimeter.

650
00:37:12,255 --> 00:37:14,487
- I'll get the doors and windows.
- And Fred...

651
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:18,159
I know. It's trap time.

652
00:37:53,263 --> 00:37:54,862
Lucky for us,

653
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:57,265
zombies aren't the fastest
movers in the world.

654
00:38:00,503 --> 00:38:02,337
Um, should we be worried?

655
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:05,541
Negative. Everything is
going exactly to plan.

656
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:13,647
- It's quiet.
- Maybe they're sleeping.

657
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:15,683
I get sleepy when I eat turkey.

658
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:18,889
Maybe they ate
some turkey brains?

659
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:30,565
Oh, no! They're all
pushing on the front door.

660
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:31,733
Right where we want them.

661
00:38:31,735 --> 00:38:33,070
Now, Fred!

662
00:38:43,381 --> 00:38:44,414
You did it.

663
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:46,950
I can't believe that worked.

664
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:58,494
Say, do you smell something?

665
00:38:58,496 --> 00:39:00,764
Mm. Smells like barbeque.

666
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:03,598
Fire!

667
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,612
What's happening
to the zombies?

668
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:18,681
They're... They're melting.

669
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:20,983
Uh-huh. Just as I thought.

670
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:22,618
These aren't zombies.

671
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,789
They're witches.

672
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:27,657
'Cause melting.

673
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,727
No? Nobody else?

674
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:31,930
Okay.

675
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:38,569
Jack is a zombie?

676
00:39:38,571 --> 00:39:40,805
He's not the only one.

677
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:43,273
Mona? Linda?

678
00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:46,543
I'm aghast.
Aghast, I tell you.

679
00:39:46,545 --> 00:39:49,279
No, Alan,
I don't think you are.

680
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:50,646
What do you mean, Velma?

681
00:39:50,648 --> 00:39:52,149
It should be obvious.

682
00:39:52,151 --> 00:39:54,184
Would you like
to start us off, Daphne?

683
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:55,618
My pleasure.

684
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,622
It first started when Shaggy
and Scooby won that contest.

685
00:39:58,624 --> 00:40:00,724
<i>It was way too coincidental,</i>

686
00:40:00,726 --> 00:40:02,659
<i>and in fact,
was probably planned.</i>

687
00:40:02,661 --> 00:40:05,095
<i>And then the trees
leading up to the island,</i>

688
00:40:05,097 --> 00:40:06,964
<i>looked like they'd be
more at home in a swamp</i>

689
00:40:06,966 --> 00:40:09,032
<i>than in a tropical paradise.</i>

690
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:11,569
But there are palm trees
on this island.

691
00:40:11,571 --> 00:40:12,803
How do you explain that?

692
00:40:12,805 --> 00:40:14,071
Plastic palm trees.

693
00:40:14,073 --> 00:40:15,939
And then,
remember when we arrived?

694
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:19,511
and Mona couldn't help telling
Shaggy and Scooby, "Yes, and..."

695
00:40:19,513 --> 00:40:22,880
<i>That's an improv technique
taught in acting classes.</i>

696
00:40:22,882 --> 00:40:24,516
Yes, and...

697
00:40:24,518 --> 00:40:26,717
<i>she also told them
the buffet was stage right.</i>

698
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,652
Which is also a theater term.

699
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:30,054
That's right.

700
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:32,056
And when Jack
quoted Shakespeare to Daphne

701
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:35,360
it was from one of the most common
monologues used for theater auditions.

702
00:40:35,362 --> 00:40:36,660
But soft!

703
00:40:36,662 --> 00:40:38,897
What light
through yonder window breaks?

704
00:40:38,899 --> 00:40:42,066
Plus everyone
was way too good-looking.

705
00:40:42,068 --> 00:40:45,503
The men have perfect jaws,
the girls perfect hair.

706
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:47,105
It's almost too perfect.

707
00:40:47,107 --> 00:40:49,174
And don't forget the cameras.

708
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:50,241
That's right.

709
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:52,110
There were cameras
all over the hotel.

710
00:40:52,112 --> 00:40:54,714
And the most
important clue.

711
00:40:55,348 --> 00:40:56,582
The guest book.

712
00:40:57,784 --> 00:40:59,317
There were pages
ripped out of it.

713
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:02,187
Pages that had the signatures
of previous guests,

714
00:41:02,189 --> 00:41:04,189
including us.

715
00:41:04,191 --> 00:41:06,124
Uh-huh.

716
00:41:06,126 --> 00:41:08,327
This isn't
a tropical island at all.

717
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:10,462
This is Moonscar Island.

718
00:41:10,464 --> 00:41:12,697
Or as I called it in my blog,

719
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:14,933
Zombie Island.

720
00:41:14,935 --> 00:41:18,337
But the name of the hotel,
it's totally different.

721
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:19,939
Not exactly.

722
00:41:19,941 --> 00:41:21,507
They changed one letter

723
00:41:21,509 --> 00:41:23,741
and they didn't even
do that very well.

724
00:41:23,743 --> 00:41:25,678
So what does that all mean?

725
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,148
Isn't it obvious?

726
00:41:29,016 --> 00:41:31,383
That this isn't just a hotel,

727
00:41:31,385 --> 00:41:32,585
this is a location,

728
00:41:32,587 --> 00:41:34,320
and we are in...

729
00:41:34,322 --> 00:41:35,421
A movie.

730
00:41:35,423 --> 00:41:38,159
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

731
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:44,298
You ruined everything.
Everything.

732
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:49,001
Thanks?

733
00:41:49,003 --> 00:41:50,370
Thank you.

734
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:53,105
You're right, Velma.
This is a movie.

735
00:41:53,107 --> 00:41:55,808
And I'm not just
Alan, the hotel manager,

736
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:59,147
I'm Alan, the film director.

737
00:42:00,582 --> 00:42:02,082
Alan Smithee?

738
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:04,985
Sure. And this was
to be my greatest masterpiece.

739
00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:07,721
Something that felt true,
that felt real.

740
00:42:07,723 --> 00:42:09,689
But now, it's ruined.

741
00:42:09,691 --> 00:42:11,224
Forever.

742
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:18,865
But why us?

743
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:22,035
Well, as you know, the only thing
studios care about these days

744
00:42:22,037 --> 00:42:25,238
are franchises, like those
found-footage horror movies

745
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,274
that spawn a bazillion sequels.

746
00:42:27,276 --> 00:42:29,209
So I thought
I could do my own.

747
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:31,712
In my research
for the next big thing,

748
00:42:31,714 --> 00:42:33,748
I happened upon your website,

749
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,982
the <i>Big Blog of Mysteries.</i>

750
00:42:35,984 --> 00:42:37,420
We have a blog?

751
00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:40,554
What?

752
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:42,292
As I was saying...

753
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,161
<i>There is a section</i>
<i>called</i> Unsolved Capers.

754
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:50,164
The most popular part,
if I don't mind saying so.

755
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:53,567
<i>And in it, it has all this
stuff about a reluctant werewolf,</i>

756
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:56,771
<i>and the tale of Zombie Island.</i>

757
00:42:56,773 --> 00:42:58,639
But Zombie Island
wasn't unsolved.

758
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:00,141
The cat people disintegrated

759
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:02,510
while the zombies went back
to an eternal rest.

760
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:04,578
There is nothing
about what you just said

761
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,714
that sounds solved.

762
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,716
But you only
used the zombies.

763
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,916
What about the cat people?

764
00:43:08,918 --> 00:43:10,851
Cat people, werewolves...

765
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:12,987
Those costumes
are too expensive.

766
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:14,589
Zombies, however,

767
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:17,325
are as cheap as a bucket
of plastic prosthetic makeup.

768
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:19,695
So I decided to make a movie.

769
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,329
But first I had to figure out

770
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:23,465
how to get you
back to the island.

771
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:27,068
<i>I'd read about Shaggy and
Scooby's love of TV's Elvira.</i>

772
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,836
<i>The horror hostess
with the mostest.</i>

773
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:31,306
<i>And since all Hollywood
weirdos know each other,</i>

774
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,475
<i>I called her up
and asked her to help sell</i>

775
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,244
<i>the whole vacation
getaway ruse.</i>

776
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,680
<i>You're the anonymous sponsor.</i>

777
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:39,947
Guilty as charged.

778
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:42,084
Then I needed
to introduce the zombies

779
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,186
in a way that would
put the audience on edge,

780
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:47,222
but not convince you guys
of the coming threat.

781
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:50,659
So you cut the tree down
to block our way here.

782
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,028
And slash the tour van's tires.

783
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,963
Uh, no, actually.

784
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,098
I don't know what that was.

785
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,399
Another mystery.

786
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,837
Maybe, just maybe
an unsolved one.

787
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,739
Uh, yeah, well...

788
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:06,509
<i>The first time I had the zombies
attack, was at the spa.</i>

789
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:08,243
<i>But I was hoping
to have a sequence</i>

790
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:09,746
<i>of being chased by the zombies,</i>

791
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:12,280
<i>maybe a grand finale
involving the hotel.</i>

792
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,816
But no,

793
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,285
you figured a way to trap my
zombies before I could finish.

794
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:18,086
I would've
gotten away with it, too,

795
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,856
if it wasn't
for you meddling kids

796
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:22,958
and your incredible talent
for solving mysteries.

797
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:29,432
Months of research
down the drain,

798
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:32,568
I even found this weird little
pendant on the island

799
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,636
I thought was a good omen

800
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:35,104
that the movie
was going to happen.

801
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,840
Simone's pendant?

802
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:38,708
Fat lot of good that did me.

803
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,343
Well, it wasn't very nice.

804
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:42,011
You had us all pretty worried

805
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,113
that something nefarious
was going on.

806
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:46,015
Yeah, and come to find out

807
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,453
the only thing nefarious
was you.

808
00:44:51,624 --> 00:44:54,190
I'm sorry. I truly am.

809
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,093
I thought
with your amazing performances,

810
00:44:57,095 --> 00:44:59,128
your good looks...

811
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:03,300
Well...
I suppose so.

812
00:45:03,302 --> 00:45:05,134
...and comedic timing...

813
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:07,071
All right! High five.

814
00:45:09,175 --> 00:45:11,575
...it really was going
to be an amazing movie.

815
00:45:11,577 --> 00:45:15,112
But now, I'll never be
able to finish the film.

816
00:45:15,114 --> 00:45:17,716
Oh, no.

817
00:45:25,124 --> 00:45:26,490
Don't cry, Alan.

818
00:45:26,492 --> 00:45:28,158
I mean, what you did was wrong,

819
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,196
but we can still
do the movie.

820
00:45:30,797 --> 00:45:32,129
We can?

821
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:34,565
Of course, we can.
How hard can it be?

822
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:37,167
Memorize a few lines here,
look scared there.

823
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:39,102
- Uh, you mean it?
- Why not?

824
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:41,473
We are supposed
to be having fun, after all.

825
00:45:41,475 --> 00:45:43,675
And that will give me time
to finally figure out

826
00:45:43,677 --> 00:45:46,143
the "white whale"
of <i>Unsolved Capers.</i>

827
00:45:46,145 --> 00:45:49,279
The mystery
of Zombie Island.

828
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:51,048
Then, ladies and gentlemen,

829
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:53,286
let's make a movie.

830
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:57,691
Few tears gets them every time.

831
00:46:09,102 --> 00:46:10,768
Hollywood.

832
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:13,638
In this scene, you discover
the treasure of Morgan Moonscar

833
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,774
and must open it,
in order to return

834
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:19,812
the evil zombie spirits
back from whence they came.

835
00:46:19,814 --> 00:46:21,513
That's not how the story goes.

836
00:46:21,515 --> 00:46:24,182
The zombies were just victims
of the cat-people.

837
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:28,052
Hello? "Based" on a true story.

838
00:46:28,054 --> 00:46:30,723
Uh, is it just me,
or now that Velma

839
00:46:30,725 --> 00:46:34,058
can solve mysteries again she's,
sort of, looking for one everywhere?

840
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,363
One time, I swore off gluten
for a year, and after that,

841
00:46:37,365 --> 00:46:41,300
I ate more gluten in a day
than I had my entire life!

842
00:46:41,302 --> 00:46:42,670
I think this is like that.

843
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:45,606
What's "gluten"?

844
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:49,275
Now, it's cold out.

845
00:46:49,277 --> 00:46:50,809
You're wet and shivering.

846
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:54,549
But we're not... wet.

847
00:47:05,761 --> 00:47:06,627
Action!

848
00:47:24,379 --> 00:47:26,348
It's her! She's back!

849
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,020
Oh, I've missed you so much!

850
00:47:34,022 --> 00:47:35,157
Mm.

851
00:47:36,391 --> 00:47:37,924
I can't believe it.

852
00:47:37,926 --> 00:47:41,094
I can't believe it's you,
where have you been?

853
00:47:41,096 --> 00:47:43,296
Freddie, are you okay?

854
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:47,667
Uh, Fred, that's not
the real Mystery Machine.

855
00:47:47,669 --> 00:47:48,936
You don't know.

856
00:47:48,938 --> 00:47:52,305
Maybe she got stronger,
and broke out to find me!

857
00:47:52,307 --> 00:47:53,810
Afraid not, Fred.

858
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,784
Fred, gang, meet Seaver.
He's our stuntman.

859
00:48:03,786 --> 00:48:04,885
Howdy.

860
00:48:04,887 --> 00:48:06,687
Seaver had this beautiful
piece of machinery

861
00:48:06,689 --> 00:48:08,422
built for the climax
of the film.

862
00:48:08,424 --> 00:48:11,425
We're gonna jump this thing
over the hotel

863
00:48:11,427 --> 00:48:13,796
while being chased
by a zombie hoard!

864
00:48:14,597 --> 00:48:16,162
Whoa!

865
00:48:17,734 --> 00:48:20,501
Yep! I've been driving it
back and forth over the island

866
00:48:20,503 --> 00:48:23,070
since we came in
on that ferry yesterday.

867
00:48:23,072 --> 00:48:24,338
The ferry?

868
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,907
Ha! I thought
I was hallucinating!

869
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:28,309
Why didn't you tell us?

870
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:29,877
Because of the promise.

871
00:48:29,879 --> 00:48:32,279
I was so desperate
to solve a mystery,

872
00:48:32,281 --> 00:48:35,282
I started thinking
I was just making one up!

873
00:48:35,284 --> 00:48:37,251
I almost thought
I was going crazy!

874
00:48:37,253 --> 00:48:40,055
But now that I know
I'm not going crazy...

875
00:48:40,057 --> 00:48:41,288
can I drive it?

876
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,858
No, you may not.

877
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,863
It takes a trained professional
to drive this thing.

878
00:48:47,865 --> 00:48:52,534
But... you can ride shotgun while
I park it in the ferry overnight.

879
00:48:52,536 --> 00:48:54,136
Cool!

880
00:48:54,138 --> 00:48:57,171
I'll let you boys handle that
while we head to our next scene.

881
00:48:57,173 --> 00:48:58,507
What's our next scene?

882
00:48:58,509 --> 00:49:01,177
Oh, you'll see.

883
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,685
And, action!

884
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:10,986
I'm hungry.

885
00:49:10,988 --> 00:49:14,189
Nah, no, no, no. Scooby, no.
The line is "I'm scared."

886
00:49:14,191 --> 00:49:15,259
Try it again.

887
00:49:16,894 --> 00:49:19,162
I'm hungry.

888
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,998
No, no, Scoobs.
It's "I'm scared."

889
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,434
The line is "I'm scared."

890
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:27,839
I'm...

891
00:49:29,107 --> 00:49:29,974
hungry.

892
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:34,476
It's not "I'm hungry,"
It's "I'm sca..."

893
00:49:34,478 --> 00:49:36,746
What? Uh-huh.

894
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:39,615
Okay, Scooby, you know what?
I just found out...

895
00:49:39,617 --> 00:49:40,817
there's no more food.

896
00:49:40,819 --> 00:49:44,754
I repeat,
there is no more food.

897
00:49:44,756 --> 00:49:45,822
I'm...

898
00:49:45,824 --> 00:49:46,825
scared!

899
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:48,727
Perfect!

900
00:49:50,161 --> 00:49:53,162
All right, Seaver.
Just run straight through the glass.

901
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:57,633
This action camera will capture
everything in perfect high definition.

902
00:49:57,635 --> 00:49:59,268
Fred, what do you think
you're doing?

903
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:03,306
I appreciate Seaver and all,
but I don't need a stuntman.

904
00:50:03,308 --> 00:50:04,774
I can do my own stunts.

905
00:50:04,776 --> 00:50:06,977
I'm a man of action, after all.

906
00:50:06,979 --> 00:50:11,048
No, Fred, you're a man
with an ascot.

907
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,850
There's a huge difference.

908
00:50:12,852 --> 00:50:16,754
Listen, I really appreciate your
commitment to the role, Fred.

909
00:50:16,756 --> 00:50:19,857
But, what would happen
if you got hurt, huh?

910
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:21,125
You're one of the stars.

911
00:50:21,127 --> 00:50:24,595
If you couldn't continue,
the movie would be over.

912
00:50:24,597 --> 00:50:26,230
I guess you're right. I...

913
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,165
I am pretty important.

914
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:29,767
Of course I'm right.

915
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:32,268
I'm Alan Smithee. Have you seen
how many movies I've done?

916
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:33,937
- No.
- Well, it's a lot.

917
00:50:33,939 --> 00:50:36,974
There's a whole bunch of them.
You have to trust me, Fred.

918
00:50:36,976 --> 00:50:37,943
You ready, Seaver?

919
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,980
And, action!

920
00:50:42,982 --> 00:50:44,450
- Oh!
- Fred, don't!

921
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:48,186
Ugh!

922
00:50:50,022 --> 00:50:50,890
Ugh!

923
00:50:51,991 --> 00:50:53,891
Missed it. Oh.

924
00:50:53,893 --> 00:50:54,760
Medic!

925
00:50:57,563 --> 00:50:59,596
Boss, we have a problem.

926
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,565
What kind of problem?

927
00:51:05,138 --> 00:51:06,570
Ahhh!

928
00:51:06,572 --> 00:51:09,375
Like, I think we had
a wardrobe malfunction.

929
00:51:10,844 --> 00:51:12,476
Wardrobe!

930
00:51:12,478 --> 00:51:15,814
We're going to need
bigger pants.

931
00:51:15,816 --> 00:51:18,049
In this scene,
the zombies have you cornered.

932
00:51:18,051 --> 00:51:21,318
All you need to do
is stand there and look scared.

933
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,319
Let's practice.

934
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:24,357
Okay. Look scared.

935
00:51:28,495 --> 00:51:30,361
Yeah, sure.
I'll fix it in post.

936
00:51:30,363 --> 00:51:31,930
Places, everyone!

937
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:41,541
Action!

938
00:51:51,418 --> 00:51:52,485
Look out!

939
00:51:59,694 --> 00:52:00,560
Oh!

940
00:52:02,697 --> 00:52:04,532
Alan, are you all right?

941
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:09,735
Uh, yeah. But, what happened?

942
00:52:09,737 --> 00:52:12,771
It looks like someone
deliberately cut the rope.

943
00:52:12,773 --> 00:52:13,639
But, why?

944
00:52:13,641 --> 00:52:15,007
And is that...

945
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:16,243
cat hair?

946
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:18,544
The palm tree.
Simone's pendant.

947
00:52:18,546 --> 00:52:21,480
This is it, Velma!
One of the unsolved capers!

948
00:52:21,482 --> 00:52:24,317
It's happening. I have to go!

949
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,685
Fred, I don't think she's okay.

950
00:52:26,687 --> 00:52:28,654
We've got bigger problems,
Daphne.

951
00:52:28,656 --> 00:52:31,191
It looks like we have
another mystery on our hands!

952
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:32,524
Uh, could you say that again?

953
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:34,393
Maybe with a little more oomph?

954
00:52:34,395 --> 00:52:36,528
Um, sure.

955
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:37,696
Well, gang...

956
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:39,034
Hold on, hold on,
I'm not ready.

957
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,767
Okay, I'm good.

958
00:52:40,769 --> 00:52:44,037
In three, two, one.

959
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:48,409
Well, gang, it looks like we have
another mystery on our hands.

960
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:53,914
Cut! That was great.
Really great.

961
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:54,783
Next scene.

962
00:53:15,837 --> 00:53:16,670
Ugh!

963
00:53:16,672 --> 00:53:18,838
Velma, Velma! Are you okay?

964
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,640
I'm better than okay.

965
00:53:20,642 --> 00:53:24,511
I'm finally going to get to the
bottom of the Zombie Island Mystery!

966
00:53:24,513 --> 00:53:25,880
But we already have!

967
00:53:25,882 --> 00:53:28,249
It was just a movie
Alan wanted us to be in.

968
00:53:28,251 --> 00:53:31,419
Keep up, Blake.
Not that Zombie Island.

969
00:53:31,421 --> 00:53:32,753
The other one.

970
00:53:32,755 --> 00:53:34,355
The one where
the cat-people appeared

971
00:53:34,357 --> 00:53:35,656
and tried to suck
our life-force!

972
00:53:35,658 --> 00:53:37,358
There is no way they were real!

973
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,627
It defies the laws of science.

974
00:53:39,629 --> 00:53:42,430
But it was, Velma!
We were there!

975
00:53:42,432 --> 00:53:44,699
No. It's got to be
something else.

976
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:46,033
Something rational.

977
00:53:46,035 --> 00:53:48,169
And now that they're back,
this is my chance

978
00:53:48,171 --> 00:53:52,707
to find out what is really going
on or my name isn't Velma Garbo.

979
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:54,475
Your name is Velma Dinkley.

980
00:53:54,477 --> 00:53:57,145
Not since I became
a movie star.

981
00:53:57,147 --> 00:53:58,014
Velma!

982
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:01,017
Wait, the cat people are back?

983
00:54:05,521 --> 00:54:07,555
I know you're out there.

984
00:54:07,557 --> 00:54:10,227
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty.

985
00:54:17,334 --> 00:54:19,500
Okay, this is the last shot
of the day.

986
00:54:19,502 --> 00:54:21,370
The magic hour!

987
00:54:21,372 --> 00:54:23,839
We'll start up the weather machine
and have the zombies attack.

988
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:26,210
All you have to do
is run the other way, okay?

989
00:54:29,313 --> 00:54:31,213
Run, run!

990
00:54:31,215 --> 00:54:32,082
Run!

991
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,788
Shaggy!

992
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:44,128
It's just a cat, Scoob.
Nothing to be worried about.

993
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:50,801
Like, nevermind!

994
00:54:58,243 --> 00:54:59,110
Whoa!

995
00:55:12,924 --> 00:55:14,757
I know I should
be freaking out,

996
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:18,129
but this is adding some serious
production value to the picture!

997
00:55:21,566 --> 00:55:23,032
Ahhh!

998
00:55:30,775 --> 00:55:32,176
Stay back.

999
00:55:32,178 --> 00:55:33,643
Ugh, stay back!

1000
00:55:33,645 --> 00:55:34,879
I'm allergic!

1001
00:55:36,614 --> 00:55:38,815
Sorry, boss. We quit.

1002
00:55:43,721 --> 00:55:46,323
What? Come back,
you can't just leave!

1003
00:55:46,325 --> 00:55:49,328
What about the art?
What about sacrifice?

1004
00:56:03,642 --> 00:56:05,211
We can't keep this up.

1005
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,382
Are those cats?

1006
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:13,451
No. Those are...

1007
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,985
cat-people!

1008
00:56:14,987 --> 00:56:15,855
Uh-oh.

1009
00:56:19,658 --> 00:56:21,060
We have to get out of here.

1010
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,661
No! We have to finish the film!

1011
00:56:24,663 --> 00:56:26,064
The film?

1012
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:27,599
We're being attacked
by immortal cat-people

1013
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:29,167
and you're worried
about the film?

1014
00:56:29,169 --> 00:56:32,205
Who cares? There's gotta
be a way off this island!

1015
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,739
The ferry.

1016
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:36,841
Yes.

1017
00:56:36,843 --> 00:56:38,243
I'll meet you there.

1018
00:56:38,245 --> 00:56:40,711
He's right.
The last ferry leaves at dusk.

1019
00:56:40,713 --> 00:56:43,982
If we hurry, we can get on it,
and get off the island!

1020
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,083
Come on!

1021
00:56:55,463 --> 00:56:56,394
Alan?

1022
00:56:56,396 --> 00:56:58,631
Oh, no! What did you do?

1023
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,902
We can't leave.

1024
00:57:03,904 --> 00:57:06,372
Not until we finish this movie.

1025
00:57:06,374 --> 00:57:08,773
We have to finish!

1026
00:57:11,945 --> 00:57:13,379
Alan's lost it.

1027
00:57:13,381 --> 00:57:16,250
And we've lost our only way
off this island.

1028
00:57:22,557 --> 00:57:23,721
No!

1029
00:57:23,723 --> 00:57:25,291
I won't lose another one.
Not again.

1030
00:57:25,293 --> 00:57:28,296
Not this time.
Not this time!

1031
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,765
Fred, don't!

1032
00:57:33,901 --> 00:57:35,201
Well, I'll be!

1033
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:37,405
Maybe he'll be a stuntman yet!

1034
00:57:40,308 --> 00:57:43,010
Don't worry, baby.
Freddie's here.

1035
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,223
I don't see him!

1036
00:58:13,275 --> 00:58:15,609
Everyone, get in
the Mystery Machine.

1037
00:58:15,611 --> 00:58:16,478
Hurry!

1038
00:58:32,595 --> 00:58:34,294
Don't worry about me.

1039
00:58:34,296 --> 00:58:37,864
Someone grab a camera
and film this!

1040
00:58:42,538 --> 00:58:44,507
Freddie, do something!

1041
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,588
Why would the cat-people
need Simone's pendant?

1042
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,390
Why, indeed.

1043
00:59:02,392 --> 00:59:03,393
Hmm.

1044
00:59:06,663 --> 00:59:08,464
Like, they're gaining on us!

1045
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:13,167
Uh-oh, what was that?

1046
00:59:13,169 --> 00:59:15,539
Bad luck. Real bad luck!

1047
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,107
Ahhh!

1048
00:59:24,847 --> 00:59:26,315
Look out!

1049
00:59:26,317 --> 00:59:27,183
Thanks.

1050
00:59:28,117 --> 00:59:30,186
Fred, "U" turn. Now!

1051
00:59:51,241 --> 00:59:52,109
Ugh!

1052
00:59:57,414 --> 00:59:58,282
Ugh!

1053
01:00:03,354 --> 01:00:04,221
Ahhh!

1054
01:00:27,545 --> 01:00:28,678
What now?

1055
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,914
There's only one way
out of this, Fred.

1056
01:00:32,183 --> 01:00:33,649
Do you think I can?

1057
01:00:33,651 --> 01:00:35,387
I know you can.

1058
01:00:46,264 --> 01:00:48,866
Freddie, what are you doing?

1059
01:00:48,868 --> 01:00:50,368
Hold on, gang.

1060
01:00:51,771 --> 01:00:53,972
Oh, I need an exterior shot.

1061
01:01:01,913 --> 01:01:03,045
- Whoa!
- Yikes!

1062
01:01:03,047 --> 01:01:04,115
Ahhh!

1063
01:01:34,648 --> 01:01:36,180
Yes!

1064
01:01:36,182 --> 01:01:39,051
That was amazing!
Let's do it again.

1065
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,285
Way to go, Fred!

1066
01:01:41,287 --> 01:01:43,588
You were both fast and furious,

1067
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:45,557
and thanks to my
high-flying drone,

1068
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:47,958
we got the whole thing
for the movie!

1069
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,529
I think there are bigger things
to worry about than the movie.

1070
01:01:51,531 --> 01:01:52,399
Look!

1071
01:01:53,533 --> 01:01:55,966
Hurry, everyone!
Head for the hotel!

1094
01:04:16,279 --> 01:04:20,648
Welcome to Moonstar Island Resort's
finest dining establishment.

1095
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:22,917
For the discerning
immortal Cat Person,

1096
01:04:22,919 --> 01:04:27,388
we have the finest fish caught
within the surrounding swamps.

1097
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,158
Please take a seat.

1098
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:36,430
A wonderful
treat for you to eat.

1099
01:04:36,432 --> 01:04:38,699
Bon appetit.

1100
01:04:38,701 --> 01:04:40,303
It rhymes.

1101
01:04:40,838 --> 01:04:42,403
Blech!

1102
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:47,543
Like, what kind of cat
doesn't like fish?

1103
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:07,865
Looks like they're on a roll.

1104
01:05:12,236 --> 01:05:14,137
Where did you come from?

1105
01:05:17,241 --> 01:05:18,475
Come on, guys.

1106
01:05:22,413 --> 01:05:25,081
What do we do now?
They'll be after us in no time.

1107
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:26,951
We need a good place to hide.

1108
01:05:28,585 --> 01:05:30,585
Why is everyone looking at us?

1109
01:05:30,587 --> 01:05:31,788
How rude.

1110
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:34,757
Because, you two
are the best hiders we know.

1111
01:05:34,759 --> 01:05:36,993
Good point.

1112
01:05:36,995 --> 01:05:38,797
I think we know just the place.

1113
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:44,434
Everyone in, quick!

1114
01:05:44,436 --> 01:05:48,004
Are we sure about this?

1115
01:05:48,006 --> 01:05:49,307
Sure enough.

1116
01:06:05,724 --> 01:06:06,856
Where are we?

1117
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:08,357
I remember this.

1118
01:06:08,359 --> 01:06:10,693
This is where the Cat People
tried to siphon our life force,

1119
01:06:10,695 --> 01:06:12,395
the last time we were here.

1120
01:06:12,397 --> 01:06:15,398
But, we stopped them, remember?
Maybe these are...

1121
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,867
relatives?

1122
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:18,736
Maybe, maybe not.

1123
01:06:18,738 --> 01:06:21,504
Nothing ever felt right
about our previous adventure

1124
01:06:21,506 --> 01:06:23,707
but I could never
figure out why.

1125
01:06:23,709 --> 01:06:26,277
Hey, Scoobs. Move around
here, get some footage.

1126
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,918
You okay, Scoob?

1127
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,285
Yeah.

1128
01:06:36,287 --> 01:06:39,423
Now, why is there a hole in
the middle of this cave?

1129
01:06:39,425 --> 01:06:41,158
Why are there holes everywhere?

1130
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,661
It looks like someone's
been digging for something.

1131
01:06:44,663 --> 01:06:47,531
Maybe the Cat People
needed a litter box.

1132
01:06:47,533 --> 01:06:50,467
They must be looking for
Moonscar's lost treasure.

1133
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:54,271
But, why would mystical immortal
creatures need a treasure?

1134
01:06:54,273 --> 01:06:56,207
My question, exactly.

1135
01:06:56,209 --> 01:06:57,407
Look at this.

1136
01:06:57,409 --> 01:06:59,144
It's the moondial.

1137
01:06:59,146 --> 01:07:02,312
The Cat People were waiting
for the harvest moon to rise

1138
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:04,314
in order to steal
our life force.

1139
01:07:04,316 --> 01:07:06,050
That's weird.

1140
01:07:06,052 --> 01:07:09,053
The cat symbol on the moondial
looks just like Alan's pendant.

1141
01:07:09,055 --> 01:07:12,422
That's all well and good
but if the Cat People are real,

1142
01:07:12,424 --> 01:07:14,826
then the rest of
the legend is true too.

1143
01:07:14,828 --> 01:07:16,961
If we don't
get out of here, we're dead,

1144
01:07:16,963 --> 01:07:20,634
or at least undead which
also sounds pretty bad.

1145
01:07:25,172 --> 01:07:27,305
Hmm.

1146
01:07:27,307 --> 01:07:31,676
I think I figured out what's going on
with the Cat People and more importantly,

1147
01:07:31,678 --> 01:07:33,778
I think I know
how to stop them.

1148
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:36,581
But it's too late,
the harvest moon has risen.

1149
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:39,384
That means we're all
going to turn into zombies.

1150
01:07:39,386 --> 01:07:41,319
This once,
I think you're right.

1151
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:50,859
Brain.

1152
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:13,882
I need brain.

1153
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,421
No, stay back.

1154
01:09:21,823 --> 01:09:24,591
Stop. We didn't know
the curse was real.

1155
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:26,728
It wasn't even my idea.

1156
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:32,465
As I suspected.

1157
01:09:32,467 --> 01:09:35,970
The greeters and the ferry captain from
when we first arrived on the island.

1158
01:09:35,972 --> 01:09:38,673
What? You're
not zombies at all.

1159
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,644
And, you aren't
soul sucking Cat People.

1160
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:48,115
Bravo! Bravo!

1161
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:51,052
I really couldn't
ask for a better performance.

1162
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:53,154
That was amazing.

1163
01:09:53,156 --> 01:09:55,390
I didn't
know you had it in you.

1164
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:56,524
But how?

1165
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,160
Well, it was easy, really.

1166
01:09:58,162 --> 01:10:00,528
After we found out
they were making the movie,

1167
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:04,732
I figured whoever was trying to sabotage
the film must be doing it for a reason.

1168
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:09,603
When we saw the holes in the cavern
and the pedestal, it all made sense.

1169
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:13,241
Someone from the island must be
looking for Moonscar's treasure.

1170
01:10:13,243 --> 01:10:16,211
And who were the only people
that were on the island

1171
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:18,013
but not part of the movie?

1172
01:10:18,015 --> 01:10:19,414
These three.

1173
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:21,683
But, how did you know they'd be
frightened by the zombies?

1174
01:10:21,685 --> 01:10:25,887
Well, if they were so convinced
that Moonscar's treasure existed,

1175
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:27,456
which of course it doesn't,

1176
01:10:27,458 --> 01:10:30,625
they must on some level
believe in the curse.

1177
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:33,929
So, we left a pendant to draw
them further into the crypt.

1178
01:10:33,931 --> 01:10:37,032
And dressed as zombies
to scare them into my trap.

1179
01:10:37,034 --> 01:10:39,534
Which totally
worked by the way.

1180
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:41,005
But, the gold?

1181
01:10:42,172 --> 01:10:45,141
Good old gold foil
wrapped Scooby Snacks

courtesy of
Alan Smithee productions.

1183
01:10:50,315 --> 01:10:53,249
There are still a
few things I don't understand.

1184
01:10:53,251 --> 01:10:54,616
Just a few?

1185
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:57,552
Yeah, like how
did they control the cats?

1186
01:10:57,554 --> 01:11:02,825
With this. The four of them used a cat whistle
to guide them into doing their bidding.

1187
01:11:02,827 --> 01:11:05,461
Four? There's only three of us.

1188
01:11:05,463 --> 01:11:07,697
Like, no way!

1189
01:11:07,699 --> 01:11:11,200
There's the scary black cat, the one that
punctured the roof of the Mystery Machine.

1190
01:11:11,202 --> 01:11:13,671
That attacked
us in the hallway.

1191
01:11:15,273 --> 01:11:18,209
Scooby, tight close-up.
This big, right here.

1192
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:23,312
Maybe, just maybe,

1193
01:11:23,314 --> 01:11:26,483
<i>there really is an immortal
Cat Person left on the island.</i>

1194
01:11:26,485 --> 01:11:29,886
Maybe you didn't stop them all
the last time you were here.

1195
01:11:29,888 --> 01:11:32,822
<i>Maybe, they still exist.</i>

1196
01:11:32,824 --> 01:11:36,826
Roaming the island
for their next victim.

1197
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:41,999
Save that tape. That was money.

1198
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:43,900
Mmm-hmm.

1199
01:11:43,902 --> 01:11:45,936
I know what you're thinking.

1200
01:11:45,938 --> 01:11:49,707
I'm not saying that because based on
a true story will sell more tickets.

1201
01:11:51,177 --> 01:11:53,277
Yeah, you're right.
That's exactly what I'm saying

1202
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:55,611
and it's gonna
go right under the title.

1203
01:12:00,753 --> 01:12:04,290
And, here are your
escorts right on time.

1204
01:12:06,826 --> 01:12:10,060
We would have gotten away with
it too, if it wasn't for you...

1205
01:12:10,062 --> 01:12:13,398
- you...
- Meddling whippersnappers.

1206
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:18,303
And don't forget talented film
director, Alan Smithee.

1207
01:12:18,305 --> 01:12:19,803
We haven't forgotten.

1208
01:12:19,805 --> 01:12:21,872
You'll get yours, Smithee.

1209
01:12:21,874 --> 01:12:24,875
I'm sure I will.
But not before you.

1210
01:12:24,877 --> 01:12:28,912
Have fun serving
15 to eternity in prison, lady.

1211
01:12:28,914 --> 01:12:32,517
Ugh, and I got so
close to finishing this film.

1212
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:35,086
All I needed was
a boffo finale.

1213
01:12:35,088 --> 01:12:37,422
At least,
you gave it a try, Alan.

1214
01:12:38,592 --> 01:12:41,261
Tickles!

1215
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:54,072
Would you look at that?
I wonder what they are doing.

1216
01:12:54,074 --> 01:12:59,110
The legend stated that the cats were
the guardians of Moonscar's treasure.

1217
01:12:59,112 --> 01:13:01,047
Maybe...

1218
01:13:01,516 --> 01:13:02,883
Oh!

1219
01:13:09,257 --> 01:13:10,690
Could it be?

1220
01:13:11,526 --> 01:13:12,690
Oh, boy!

1221
01:13:12,692 --> 01:13:14,493
It's gold!

1222
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,728
I can't believe it.

1223
01:13:19,634 --> 01:13:21,100
I'm rich!

1224
01:13:21,102 --> 01:13:23,469
Like, really, really rich.

1225
01:13:23,471 --> 01:13:28,073
With all that gold,
you can make a sequel or maybe a trilogy.

1226
01:13:28,075 --> 01:13:31,377
Yeah, a trilogy.

1227
01:13:31,379 --> 01:13:35,416
Are you kidding me? After this flick,
I'm done with the movie business.

1228
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:40,085
But I thought
directing was your dream?

1229
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:42,188
I've got a new dream.

1230
01:13:42,190 --> 01:13:46,892
One involving retirement on a tropical
island where no one gives you notes,

1231
01:13:46,894 --> 01:13:51,331
and bets your future
on a weekend box office.

1232
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:54,534
It's been a pleasure working with you
kids, it really has,

1233
01:13:54,536 --> 01:13:56,238
but I'm retired.

1234
01:13:58,806 --> 01:14:01,141
What a vacation, huh, gang?

1235
01:14:01,143 --> 01:14:03,412
Maybe the best vacation ever.

1236
01:14:04,379 --> 01:14:05,744
How so, Velma?

1237
01:14:05,746 --> 01:14:09,182
I finally get to cross off one
of my unsolved capers.

1238
01:14:09,184 --> 01:14:11,952
Unsolved? But, the Cat People
from last time...

1239
01:14:11,954 --> 01:14:14,888
...must be the same people looking
for the treasure this time.

1240
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:16,923
And the original zombies?

1241
01:14:16,925 --> 01:14:19,459
Swamp gas.

1242
01:14:19,461 --> 01:14:22,829
I think it's best
to let her have this one, Fred.

1243
01:14:22,831 --> 01:14:25,165
Point is,
we can't stop solving crimes

1244
01:14:25,167 --> 01:14:28,001
because we might get hurt
or step on some toes.

1245
01:14:28,003 --> 01:14:29,970
It is in our blood.

1246
01:14:29,972 --> 01:14:32,839
It is our destiny.

1247
01:14:32,841 --> 01:14:34,741
You know, Velma's right.

1248
01:14:34,743 --> 01:14:37,877
We should never have made you guys
promise to not be who you are.

1249
01:14:37,879 --> 01:14:39,614
Yeah.

1250
01:14:39,616 --> 01:14:42,148
Besides, without burning off
calories running from monsters,

1251
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:44,418
I think I gained a whole pound.

1252
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:47,255
Who knew being afraid
was such good exercise.

1253
01:14:47,257 --> 01:14:50,059
So what do you say, gang?
Mystery Inc. forever?

1254
01:14:53,196 --> 01:14:54,528
Freddie?

1255
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:57,498
Of course, I'm in.
But if we're gonna do this,

1256
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,067
we're gonna need
the real Mystery Machine.

1257
01:15:00,069 --> 01:15:03,504
Ah! I should have never sold
it in the first place.

1258
01:15:03,506 --> 01:15:06,274
And we'll do whatever
we can to get it back.

1259
01:15:06,276 --> 01:15:07,410
Mm-hmm.

1260
01:15:08,444 --> 01:15:09,445
Then...

1261
01:15:12,081 --> 01:15:14,616
Mystery Inc. forever!

1262
01:15:15,952 --> 01:15:18,587
Oh, I can't believe it!

1263
01:15:18,589 --> 01:15:20,888
Sheriff,
what are you doing here?

1264
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:23,924
When I heard about some teenagers
and a dog getting into a mess

1265
01:15:23,926 --> 01:15:25,360
with some crooks
dressed up as cats,

1266
01:15:25,362 --> 01:15:27,828
I thought I'd come
take a look-see.

1267
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:29,298
Turns out, I was right.

1268
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,832
You kids are solving
mysteries again, aren't you?

1269
01:15:31,834 --> 01:15:34,835
I thought we'd agreed you
weren't gonna do that anymore.

1270
01:15:34,837 --> 01:15:37,773
But, Sheriff...

1271
01:15:37,775 --> 01:15:39,907
We just have to
solve mysteries.

1272
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:41,743
It's the only thing
we're good at.

1273
01:15:43,647 --> 01:15:47,883
Why won't you let us be who we were
meant to be?

1274
01:15:47,885 --> 01:15:50,185
You know, you don't
need to cry, Daphne.

1275
01:15:50,187 --> 01:15:52,487
I'm sure you can
do something else.

1276
01:15:52,489 --> 01:15:55,891
But there is nothing else.

1277
01:15:55,893 --> 01:15:58,293
It's our life's work.

1278
01:16:02,734 --> 01:16:05,300
Uh...

1279
01:16:05,302 --> 01:16:07,402
Well I guess if you have to.

1280
01:16:07,404 --> 01:16:08,538
Thanks, Sheriff.

1281
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:11,973
And a few tears
gets 'em every time.

1282
01:16:11,975 --> 01:16:15,143
Well, since I can't
talk you out of it,

1283
01:16:15,145 --> 01:16:18,281
all I can do is
tell you to be careful.

1284
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:20,115
There are a lot
of people out there

1285
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,318
that won't take too kindly to
you meddling in their business.

1286
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,520
Understood. Thanks, Sheriff.

1287
01:16:24,522 --> 01:16:26,955
All right, then. Why don't
I give you a lift home?

1288
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:28,391
Maybe in a little bit.

1289
01:16:28,393 --> 01:16:31,363
Like, being a zombie
works up an appetite.

1290
01:16:32,097 --> 01:16:33,898
It sure does.

1291
01:16:39,003 --> 01:16:41,938
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

1292
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:04,294
Hello, my little freaks.

1293
01:17:04,296 --> 01:17:06,296
Welcome back to the show.

1294
01:17:06,298 --> 01:17:10,367
Next up, we have a zombie flick
that's sure to make you meow for more.

1295
01:17:10,369 --> 01:17:13,203
Hold onto your
tails as we watch,

1296
01:17:13,205 --> 01:17:17,708
<i>"Zombie Teenagers and
The Island of Doom."</i>

1297
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:21,680
Ugh, seriously?
I mean, that's the title?

1298
01:17:23,315 --> 01:17:25,349
Right.

1299
01:17:25,351 --> 01:17:29,286
<i>On an island
surrounded by water...</i>

1300
01:17:29,288 --> 01:17:31,856
<i>A group of gullible teenagers</i>

1301
01:17:31,858 --> 01:17:34,091
<i>will face a terror</i>

1302
01:17:34,093 --> 01:17:37,562
<i>that isn't human.</i>

1303
01:17:37,564 --> 01:17:39,265
And... action!

1304
01:17:40,132 --> 01:17:42,834
- I'm hungry.
- Cut!

1305
01:17:42,836 --> 01:17:44,034
I'm hungry.

1306
01:17:44,036 --> 01:17:45,403
Hungry.

1307
01:17:45,405 --> 01:17:46,972
Hungry.

1308
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:51,810
Hungry.

1309
01:17:51,812 --> 01:17:52,976
Hungry.

1310
01:17:52,978 --> 01:17:54,779
Hungry.

1311
01:17:54,781 --> 01:17:56,616
I'm...

1312
01:17:58,885 --> 01:18:00,785
hungry.

1313
01:18:00,787 --> 01:18:02,255
Cut!

1314
01:18:02,923 --> 01:18:05,390
Action!

1315
01:18:05,392 --> 01:18:09,160
Cut!
Ugh, Fred, not again.

1316
01:18:09,162 --> 01:18:11,162
- Action!
- Like, listen.

1317
01:18:11,164 --> 01:18:13,398
I know there's mysterious stuff
around every...

1318
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,136
Cut, cut!
You ruined everything. Everything!

1319
01:18:23,443 --> 01:18:26,745
Zoinks!

1320
01:18:26,747 --> 01:18:27,780
Uh-oh.

1321
01:18:29,451 --> 01:18:34,451
