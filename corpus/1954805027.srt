00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,043
Tracy, did you see a phone...

519
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,084
Trace?

520
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,419
<i>Tracy?</i>

521
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,754
She was just here.

522
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,517
She came back with me, right?

523
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,584
Yes.

524
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,685
Did anybody see her go anywhere?

525
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,459
I didn't.
Maybe she went to the bathroom.

526
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,399
She wouldn't go to the bathroom
without saying something to somebody.

527
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,993
Tracy! We'll go look for her.

528
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,740
Let's find a can and a hose and
get the fuel out of these cars.

529
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,241
[ALEX] How are we doing?

530
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,286
Tastes like shit.

531
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,221
Yeah, I'll get you mouthwash
later, but how much gas we got?

532
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,282
Not enough. Fuck! Really?

533
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,056
Did you find the gas key?

534
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:16,098
It would help if I knew
what it looked like.

535
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,795
Well, the car by the pumps
is empty, so is yours.

536
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,732
Of the cars here, I got maybe
two and a half gallons combined.

537
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:27,072
They put it all in Jack's car. Just gonna
have to see how much I can get out of Noah's.

538
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,704
Any luck finding Tracy?

539
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,179
No.

540
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,244
How about a phone?

541
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,445
No one's found one yet.

542
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,146
Jesus Christ, they have
to have a fucking phone...

543
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,747
they have a internet site,
for Christ's sake.

544
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,157
Goddamn it!

545
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,718
Okay, look, even if Noah's car
has four gallons in it...

546
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,821
that still leaves us
less than half a tank...

547
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,364
which gets us about halfway
back, and then we're done.

548
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,403
So what do you want to do?
You want to stay here?

549
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,598
No!

550
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:00,768
But I'm not so sure I want
to be out there, either.

551
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:05,542
What if it's just some crazy guy thats
running around, killing people?

552
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,105
You think it's a crazy guy?

553
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,582
I don't know.

554
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,726
Well, if it's a crazy
guy, it's the cleanest,

555
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:12,339
quietest crazy guy
I've ever seen.

556
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,754
I haven't seen any blood,
no sign of struggle.

557
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,621
Yeah, I know.

558
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,594
I wish it was a crazy guy, because
I can fuck up a crazy guy.

559
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,829
But I don't think
that's what it is.

560
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:33,107
Sam, I need to know
you're with me.

561
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,508
I'm with you.

562
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,841
Okay. Yeah.

563
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,852
What do you think of Noah?

564
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,256
Dude, he's creepy as fuck.

565
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,418
Weird. Right?

566
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,722
Yeah.

567
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,334
[SAM] Any luck, Jack?

568
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,401
No... nothing.

569
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,551
[ELLA] He's gone!

570
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,280
What's wrong? What's wrong?

571
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,756
No, no, no,
look at me, look at me.

572
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,724
Who's gone? Noah.

573
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:28,161
We were just walking behind the
house, and calling for Tracy...

574
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,893
and I just took my eyes
off him for a second.

575
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,162
He's gone.

576
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,226
No one else was there
when it happened.

577
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,572
Fuck... okay,
everybody inside, okay?

578
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,475
Inside? Dude, we gotta go.
Inside, let's not bullshit.

579
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,706
Look, Jack, man, we gotta leave.

580
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,214
Not fucking now!
Jack, we need to go!

581
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,479
Alex, goddamn it! I'm not fucking
leaving without Tracy, all right!

582
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,712
All right.

583
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,652
Do you fucking hear me! Yeah!

584
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,589
Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay.

585
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,626
I'm sorry. Okay.

586
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,286
I'm sorry. It's okay.

587
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,354
So damn sorry. Okay, all right,
come on, we're going inside.

588
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,627
Okay, we're going inside.
Everybody inside, let's go.

589
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,793
I just need a minute, okay?

590
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,336
Yeah.

591
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,874
( DOOR CLOSES)

592
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:32,925
Okay, we obviously
have a situation here.

593
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,760
That may be the single biggest
understatement I've ever heard.

594
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,596
Lucas!
Dude, I'm with him on this one.

595
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,697
Okay, so what do we know?

596
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:51,777
We know that it looks as if
everyone that was here is now gone.

597
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,543
They all left in a hurry.

598
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,845
Yes, good, yeah.

599
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,648
We know that all
the animals have gone...

600
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:02,282
and that it's way hotter at this
time of year than it should be.

601
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,952
So, what can cause all that?

602
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:08,930
Okay, what can make everything
disappear, including the insects?

603
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:13,628
Um, look, a poisonous gas cloud,
a chemical spill...

604
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,728
No, there'd be dead bodies
all over the place.

605
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,899
There'd be insects and birds
and critters everywhere.

606
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,637
Not necessarily.

607
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:27,513
I mean, sometimes, you know, when birds sense
something bad is coming, like an earthquake.

608
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:32,577
You know, maybe whatever happened here, they
figured it out ahead of time and took off.

609
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,386
Okay, that's possible, yeah.

610
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,792
Yeah, like they ran ahead of it,
like in a forest fire or something.

611
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:44,321
Okay, look, if it was something
man-made, like a poisonous gas cloud...

612
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:48,837
then that would explain why everyone
who was here left in such a hurry.

613
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:54,406
I mean, it was an emergency
and they were evacuated.

614
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:58,914
So Noah and Tracy were evacuated...
Claire? That's what you think?

615
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:04,942
Look, I know everyone's upset, but I
really think we need to get out of here.

616
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:09,490
And if what Claire says is right, that the
people who were here before got evacuated...

617
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,584
we need to leave.

618
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,424
What about Tracy and Noah?

619
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,358
I don't know.

620
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:24,330
I don't know, but how does staying here
and having the same thing happen to us...

621
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,965
how does that help them...

622
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,636
In any way?

623
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,744
How much gas did you salvage?

624
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:36,682
About half a tank.

625
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:40,814
About a half a tank, well,
that's not enough.

626
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,052
It's not enough
to get help or to escape.

627
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,560
It's enough to get away.

628
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,028
Unless whatever it is we're dealing
with here covers hundreds of miles...

629
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:53,501
in which case, we'd be feeding ourselves
to it, and then no, it's not.

630
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,411
Let's put it to a vote.

631
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,739
All in favor of leaving.

632
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,857
Staying.

633
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,832
Looks like we're staying.

634
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,395
Okay, then.

635
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,070
I think this is a mistake.

636
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:39,910
I know. I hope you're wrong.

637
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,008
Me, too.

638
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:47,649
Let's lock all the
windows and doors.

639
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,124
We stay together.

640
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:55,426
If anybody has to go to the bathroom,
they take two people with them.

641
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:58,092
We don't take our eyes
off each other... ever.

642
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,798
Okay?

643
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,744
<i>( SOFT MUSIC CONTINUES)</i>

644
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,880
I'm worried about Tracy.

645
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,713
I know.

646
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:53,186
That's why I'm trying
to distract you.

647
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:58,694
All right, so give me
two cards, please.

648
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,189
( LAUGHS)

649
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:10,536
I will bet you that shot
of whiskey...

650
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:13,234
and...

651
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,039
( CLEARS THROAT)

652
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,773
this shoe.

653
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,147
What, are we playing
strip poker now?

654
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,708
Told you I was gonna distract
you, didn't I?

655
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:24,809
A shoe, you say.

656
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,515
A... shoe.

657
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,720
Penny ante.

658
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:38,164
I will see your bet,
and I will raise you...

659
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,900
a shot of Irish pride.

660
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,697
And...

661
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,874
the shirt off my back.

662
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,711
<i>Hm, muscles.</i>

663
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:58,083
Very small ones,
but they are there.

664
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,247
Okay. This region.

665
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:06,057
All right, all right, I will see
your bet, and I will raise you...

666
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,332
my panties.

667
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,701
How did you get
your panties off?

668
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:25,645
I came prepared.

669
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,079
Your turn.

670
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,217
Okay.

671
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,791
Okay.

672
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:43,854
I will call.

673
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:47,027
Not until you get your underwear
on this counter, you don't.

674
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,698
Can't you wait and see
if you've won the hand or not?

675
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,638
Ha! No.

676
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,800
Fine.

677
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,111
But you cannot have my dignity.

678
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,878
I want your dignity, boy.
I want your drawers.

679
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,286
(GIGGLES)

680
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:11,287
So can I have one of these,
even if I win?

681
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,730
Hello?

Help me! He's gone!
Oh, god, he's... he's gone!

685
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,339
It's okay.
We were just sitting there.

686
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:39,013
He was just talking, and he just
disappeared behind the...

687
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,316
Fuck me.

Okay, careful,
you're gonna cut yourself.
