1
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,717
Let's make somethin' together.

2
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,145
It's the king.

3
00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:05,475
The king, the king,
the king, the king.

4
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,091
Oh, jump shot. Go on.

5
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:09,254
He's heating up.

6
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:11,214
Watch out, Sian. Move.

7
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:13,383
He's on fire.

8
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:14,801
Oh, you're on a game?
I got next.

9
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,791
Too late, Dru.
I already called it.

10
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:20,098
You couldn't grab us no cereal?

11
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:21,349
Do I look like your maid?

12
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:24,310
Nah. One of you farted.

13
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,395
Pause the game, LeBron.

14
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:27,535
I will, right after I...

15
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:29,615
Slam dunk.

16
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:32,452
Yo!
- Yo!

17
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:37,490
Oh, my bad.

18
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,242
It's not even funny.

19
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:40,785
That's funny.

20
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:42,370
Boys...

21
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,955
What...?
- Sup, Coach.

22
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:45,748
Sup, Coach. -DRU: Hi, Dad.
- Sup, Coach.

23
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:47,250
Hey, Coach. -Y'all get ready for the game.

24
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,127
I want to get to Salvation Army early.

25
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:50,378
And clean this mess up.

26
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:51,588
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:54,924
Hurry up.
- Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

28
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,024
Right there.

29
00:02:58,686 --> 00:02:59,971
Nah, for real.

30
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,222
One of y'all stink.

31
00:03:01,322 --> 00:03:02,682
Y'all gotta get that checked out.

32
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,100
Yo, no.

33
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,768
It was Lil Dru.
I think it was Lil Dru.

34
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:09,268
Don't point at me now.
- Nah, it was Dru.

35
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:20,623
Whoo!

36
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,455
That's all right, Sian.
Go get back.

37
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:27,555
Back in there.

38
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,500
Three-pointer, three-pointer,

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
take the three-pointer.

40
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,719
Yeah.

41
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,724
Take the open shot.

42
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,847
Yeah, boy.
- That's how you do it.

43
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:45,266
Yeah. Yeah.

44
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:46,684
I love what I see out there.

45
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:49,062
I love it, a lot of chemistry
between the team.

46
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,188
I like what I'm seeing.

47
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:51,481
We were losing this game,

48
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:52,899
now we're winning this game, right?

49
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,318
Remember, it's not how
you start the game...

50
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:57,153
It's how you finish the game.

51
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:59,030
All right,
guys, let's go.

52
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,323
One, two, three.

53
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:02,423
Shooting Stars!

54
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:15,553
Let's go, Shooting Stars!

55
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,648
Let's go,
Shooting Stars!

56
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:21,177
Let's go, Shooting Stars!

57
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:23,317
Let's go,
Shooting Stars!

58
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:25,223
Hell yeah.

59
00:04:25,323 --> 00:04:26,599
When I make it to the league.

60
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,934
I'ma have a big ass pool in the back...

61
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,186
...and I'ma swim in that bitch every day,

62
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,146
sucker!

63
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:34,246
Sorry, Mama.

64
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:35,775
When I make it to the league.

65
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,527
I'ma put an arcade in my joint.

66
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,737
Huge 40-inch big-screen and everything.

67
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:41,837
That's gonna be tight.

68
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:43,199
We can all build cribs next to each other,

69
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:44,784
build tunnels under 'em
so we can hang out,

70
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,494
like, all the time.
- Why will we need tunnels...

71
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:48,371
...if you live right next door, fool.

72
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:49,872
You know, like the Batcave.

73
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:50,999
Oh, snap.

74
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,584
We should put a big ass basketball court...

75
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:54,684
...down there, too.

76
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,095
What'd we do now?

77
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,174
I don't know what it is...

78
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:03,294
...but y'all are gonna do something
special together.

79
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:05,054
Mm, that's right.

80
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:07,557
You know what? Y'all remind me
of a song I need to play,

81
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:09,267
something for y'all to think about.

82
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:10,977
No. No,
no. -This is a beautiful song.

83
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,562
Oh, you know what song we should do?

84
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:14,147
What's that song? By Biggie?
- Oh, yeah.

85
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,398
We should play Biggie.

86
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:17,498
There's no Biggie.

87
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,915
Your dad's musical taste is trash.

88
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:34,751
But when I make it to the league.

89
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,669
I'ma get a bunch of records...

90
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,088
...and I'm also gonna get a tattoo.

91
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,548
That'd be phat.

92
00:05:40,648 --> 00:05:43,538
Don't worry, Sian,
you already fat.

93
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:46,437
Besides, tattoos are stupid.

94
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,195
We need to hurry before Ma get back.

95
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,039
Can't rush art, brother.

96
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,784
Heard y'all finna start high school.

97
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:10,495
Yeah. Can't wait. Buchtel.

98
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:12,997
Yeah. I went there.

99
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:16,125
Slept through most of my classes though,

100
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:17,710
but game night?

101
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,128
It was on.

102
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,839
Squad get all the hoes.

103
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,434
For real?
- Oh, yeah.

104
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:26,803
Sit still, dumbass,

105
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:29,708
fore this lion end up cross-eyed.

106
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:40,975
Oh, shit. Let's wrap this up
later, big dawg. -All right.

107
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:42,235
Tat?

108
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,529
I know you ain't puttin'
no prison ink on my son.

109
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,990
I'm sorry, we-we was just...
- I swear to God. Tat!

110
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,325
I told you about this.
Bron, get back here.

111
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:50,159
Tat!

112
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:52,259
Boy.

113
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:03,756
Gotta come home some time
and that belt gonna be waitin'!

114
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,267
Come on, Mama.

115
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:59,679
What's good, y'all?
- Oh, what's good, bro?

116
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:03,399
Bro, what are you doing?

117
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:06,152
That's only gonna make your arms longer.

118
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,695
Yo, I grew a half inch just this month,

119
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:10,615
so kiss my ass.

120
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:12,715
Whoo.

121
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:15,119
Yo, is that a tattoo?

122
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:17,219
Yeah, check it out.

123
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:19,999
What is it? -Damn.
- Is that a cow?

124
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,918
It's a lion. He ain't done yet.

125
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:23,753
Cause it look like a cow.

126
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:26,913
What the hell would I get a cow for?

127
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:28,800
Hey, where y'all goin'?

128
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,177
Heading over to Buchtel.
- Yeah, y'all should come.

129
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,097
Ain't nobody tryin' to go
to school in the summer, Dad.

130
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:36,015
Well, it's about to be all y'all's school,

131
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:41,045
and if anybody'd benefit from
meeting Coach Sams, it's you.

132
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:43,439
Boy, what...?

133
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,733
What... what is that?

134
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,833
A cow?

135
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,739
I told you, I told you.
- Yeah. -Come on.

136
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,199
That is definitely a cow.

137
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,742
Yeah, I'd cover that up with something.

138
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:57,503
Tell me that ain't Sian.

139
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,707
Man, that fool don't look nothin' like me.

140
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,125
Oh, shit.

141
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,043
Yo, he got them chubby cheeks
and everything.

142
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,143
Dang.

143
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,346
Relax.

144
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,841
Whoa.
- Whoa.

145
00:09:09,941 --> 00:09:11,801
Dang.
- It's huge.

146
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,901
Hey.
- Yo.

147
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:15,952
That scoreboard.

148
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,643
Boys like what you see?

149
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:22,743
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,649
That's what I want to hear.

151
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,484
1930s,

152
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:31,112
white folks moved to Akron...

153
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:34,157
...just so their kids could attend Buchtel.

154
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:37,062
They called it the Pearl of Ohio.

155
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:41,289
Everything was white and pristine.

156
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:43,389
You believe that?

157
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,419
But now we here.

158
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,379
Academic excellence...

159
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:53,101
...and we still got one helluva
basketball program.

160
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:56,346
And that's why we value all the talent...

161
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,681
...you boys are gonna bring to this school.

162
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:02,096
And I'm not just talking about varsity.

163
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,113
We need leaders on JV, too.

164
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:07,231
Wait, what? JV?

165
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:09,275
Junior varsity.
- I know what it is.

166
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,403
Don't worry.

167
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:14,113
We'll put some meat on them bones...

168
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,158
...and in a few years, few inches,

169
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:19,118
and you gonna be rolling with the big dogs.

170
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,218
All right, bruh.

171
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,503
He goes up for the slam. Bang!

172
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:30,603
Another one.

173
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:35,969
Man...

174
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,553
...the hell with Buchtel.

175
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:39,653
Huh?

176
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:42,746
I said forget Buchtel.
Place sucks.

177
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:44,686
Man, why you trippin'?
It was cool.

178
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:47,480
Yeah, for you. You ain't gotta
worry about your spot.

179
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,233
Plus Coach Sams practically
drooling over Uncle Willie.

180
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,734
Man, that's cause I'm raw.

181
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:55,313
You over there downloading
raw porn on his computer.

182
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:57,073
If I wanted porn

183
00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:59,867
I'd just ask your mama
to mail me some more pictures.

184
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,869
Yo, that's not cool, bro.

185
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:03,246
She just cooked us dinner last week.

186
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,707
Yo, yo, yo, yeah, whoa.

187
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:06,708
Y'all hearing me?

188
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:08,793
Buchtel ain't gonna play me.

189
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:11,287
He ain't say that.
- Yes, he did.

190
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:12,964
The man ain't never seen me ball.

191
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:14,340
That's some bullshit.

192
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,593
Come on, man,
it ain't even that serious.

193
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:17,927
What's more serious...

194
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:19,887
...than Buchtel trying
to break up the Fab Four?

195
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:21,598
We supposed to play together.

196
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,308
Maybe if you stopped
wildin' out on your pops,

197
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:26,227
he'll talk to Coach Sams for you.

198
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:28,104
My pops?

199
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:30,315
Can't you see they was
both conspiring against me?

200
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:33,818
They shook hands right in front of me.

201
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:35,486
Look, if we want to play together.

202
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:39,156
Buchtel's the only school in our district.

203
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,117
What other choice we got?

204
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:44,120
And we'll still be
on the same team. -Mm-hmm.

205
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,080
Only thing is you'll be JV.

206
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,835
You know, ballin' with the other munchkins.

207
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,657
Keith Debrot?

208
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:22,757
No.

209
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,661
Dambrot.

210
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,761
Who are you?

211
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:28,164
Dru Joyce.

212
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:29,832
I just need a second, Coach.

213
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:32,001
You're on the team here?
- Nah.

214
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:33,336
Not yet.

215
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,838
But I could be if you're lucky.

216
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:38,403
Tryouts aren't until October.

217
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:39,884
Well, are you gonna give me a chance?

218
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:42,845
No, like a real chance.
For varsity.

219
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,398
Varsity.

220
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:58,695
What the hell you think you're doing?

221
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:00,613
I don't have time for this.

222
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,033
I-I just started this job like 45 minutes ago.

223
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,703
Yeah, I know.

224
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:07,870
I read all about it.

225
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,497
Is that right?

226
00:13:09,597 --> 00:13:10,748
Yeah.

227
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:12,875
I know what you're thinking.

228
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:14,877
You're thinking like everyone else:

229
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,504
too short, too small,

230
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:19,579
not enough meat on my bones, right?

231
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:28,391
Maybe you go on home
and eat your Wheaties.

232
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:30,268
Maybe you'll luck
and, uh, have a growth spurt.

233
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:32,695
But what if I don't?

234
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,692
What if I get old and stay short,

235
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,235
just like you.

236
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:42,939
Yeah, well, then maybe
it's just not in the cards.

237
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,365
You know what, kid,
why don't you take a hike, huh?

238
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:46,409
Kind of like how coaching college...

239
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:49,144
...wasn't in the cards for you?

240
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:52,206
I checked you out.

241
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:56,044
Head coach, Central Michigan,
'91 to'93?

242
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:58,421
You were fired, right?
Somethin' you said?

243
00:13:58,521 --> 00:14:00,340
No, well, that wasn't...
I mean, I-I never...

244
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,841
Look, look, it's all good.

245
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,301
I understand.

246
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:07,736
Sucks when people judge you
before knowin' you, huh?

247
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,186
You played against the Fab Five, right?

248
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,938
Greatest college lineup ever:

249
00:14:15,038 --> 00:14:18,232
Howard, Rose, Webber...

250
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,443
I know who the Fab Five are.

251
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,543
Well...

252
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:26,366
Me and my boys...

253
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,951
...we call ourselves the Fab Four.

254
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:31,371
Let's go, Shooting Stars! -

255
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,707
We been ballin' with each other
since we was, like, ten.

256
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,168
We can win you a state championship.

257
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:39,268
Guaranteed.

258
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:43,314
You sure are a cocky
little bastard, aren't you?

259
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:53,733
Yo.

260
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:55,311
Man, where you been at?

261
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,411
I was at St. V's.

262
00:14:57,504 --> 00:14:59,315
The Catholic school? For what?

263
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:00,692
Yeah, there's a new coach over there.

264
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,860
NCAA dude.

265
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,987
He legit.

266
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:05,363
All right, that's good for them,

267
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:06,823
but we goin' to Buchtel.

268
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,992
They ain't letting me play
varsity so I ain't going.

269
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:11,452
But we're supposed to play together.

270
00:15:11,552 --> 00:15:13,830
Y'all didn't seem to mind
that I'm the odd man out.

271
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,164
I ain't wasting away on JV.

272
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:16,708
I'm better than that and y'all know it.

273
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:19,377
Yeah, we know,
but Catholic school?

274
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:20,795
They got scholarships.

275
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:22,755
If we all stick together,
maybe we could get some.

276
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,466
They got a lot of white folks,
too, in case you forgot.

277
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:30,156
I ain't runnin' for class
president, I'm goin' to ball.

278
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,140
And you serious?

279
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,850
Dead serious.

280
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,020
You really willing to walk away
from Buchtel?

281
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,521
They got championships, my dawg.

282
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,356
And girls.

283
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:42,751
I mean, what's St. V's got?

284
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:45,445
A coach who believes in me.

285
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,280
Bro, we believe in you.

286
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,015
Well, you don't set the roster.

287
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,374
I mean...

288
00:15:58,474 --> 00:16:01,511
...what's St. V's mascot anyway?

289
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:04,931
The Irish.

290
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:10,178
So...

291
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:12,573
...we'd be the Black Irish?

292
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:15,767
Yo, that's trash.

293
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,644
Nah, man.

294
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,812
Them snow bunnies might be
hittin' though.

295
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:25,097
Man, y'all know if we do this,
our parents are gonna trip out.

296
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:29,447
Buchtel was the plan. We agreed.

297
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:31,699
You said Buchtel was the plan.

298
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,785
Yeah, because it'd make the most sense.

299
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:36,537
Yeah, so you can get a job there
while Bron, Sian, Willie,

300
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:39,666
they get to play varsity,
while I'm on JV. Right?

301
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,043
Who cares about me?
- No. No.

302
00:16:42,143 --> 00:16:43,336
It's not about that.

303
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,587
You were the one who said...

304
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:46,798
...we was gonna do something special.

305
00:16:46,898 --> 00:16:49,092
How we supposed to do that
if we ain't even together?

306
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:51,644
Let's-let's reason this out.

307
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,389
All of you want to go to St. V's?

308
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:55,598
We just want to play together, Dad.

309
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,517
Willie's talkin' to Illya.

310
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:01,017
And-and Bron,
he's talking with his moms.

311
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:04,941
Dad, Coach Dambrot,
he's a real coach.

312
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,276
His squad played the Fab Five.

313
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:07,944
Plus he said he'd ask them to enroll us...

314
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:12,209
...with full scholarships
if we all just say yes.

315
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:18,121
I'll talk to your mom about it.

316
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:20,456
All right, bet.

317
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:22,556
Thanks, Dad.

318
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:25,837
Come on, bro.

319
00:17:25,937 --> 00:17:28,923
What are you gonna tell Coach Sams?

320
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:30,174
The truth I guess.

321
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:32,274
Does it matter?

322
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:34,727
No.

323
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,349
No matter what you say, we're
gonna be labelled sellouts.

324
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:42,228
This is a Buchtel town.

325
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,063
We just living in it.

326
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,982
Look at you.

327
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:48,443
Pose for me one more time.

328
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,320
Come on, pose, Denzel.

329
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
Mama, this ain't funny.

330
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,471
Shittin' me it ain't.

331
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:56,918
Oh, don't be all shy now.

332
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,919
You asked for this.

333
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,991
Go ahead.

334
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,550
Knock 'em dead, baby.

335
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,906
All right, looking good.

336
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:28,942
Stop.

337
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,277
Oh, my goodness, look at y'all.

338
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,820
Okay, now tell me.

339
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,198
Which one of y'all
is supposed to be Carlton?

340
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:36,699
Ma, stop.
- Is it you? Is it you?

341
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,835
Is it you?
- Stop, stop.

342
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,838
Man, with your cheatin' ass.

343
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:15,465
She let you copy off her test?

344
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:18,625
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

345
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:25,558
'Ey. I know this is trials but
that's all just a technicality.

346
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:26,809
Be the Fab Four.

347
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:28,945
Show 'em how it's done.

348
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,482
Oh, shit.

349
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:33,733
Black people.

350
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,833
Where y'all been at?

351
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:38,663
Right over left.

352
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,454
So, how come we never see y'all
in church?

353
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:50,124
Chapel ain't required for varsity seniors.

354
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:53,261
Jermaine, team captain.

355
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:56,889
That's Marlon, Malik, Jake.

356
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,862
And back there is Chris.
- Switch.

357
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,390
Well, um, this Sian,

358
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,058
that's Bron.

359
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:08,518
Lil Dru, and I'm...

360
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:10,618
Willie McGee.

361
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,181
One of the best players in the city, right?

362
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:15,858
Well, in this gym,
you're just another freshman.

363
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,611
Dambrot recruited us.

364
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,711
Dambrot's a burnout.

365
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:22,198
Y'all know why he landed here, right?

366
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:24,678
I'm surprised you even came.

367
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,418
Heads up.

368
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:30,373
Okay.

369
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:32,750
When I was your age, I...

370
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,210
...well, hated being in high school...

371
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,546
...and now that I'm back,
I hate it even more.

372
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:40,725
So if I gonna be here,
I'm gonna win.

373
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:43,469
I don't give a shit if you started last year,

374
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,637
or you got a scholarship...

375
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,724
...or if your uncle is Michael Jordan.

376
00:21:47,824 --> 00:21:50,560
If you're weak or lazy,
you ain't makin' the team.

377
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,395
If you're slow,
you ain't makin' the team.

378
00:21:52,495 --> 00:21:54,822
If you suck, you're out.

379
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:57,900
For everyone left,

380
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,689
the next four hours will tell us
who makes it and who breaks it.

381
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:03,990
Coop, it's all yours.

382
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,810
Everybody on the line. Let's go.

383
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:10,622
Let's move. Hustle up.

384
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:12,790
Three-point line, back.
Half-court line, back.

385
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,460
Three-point line, back.
Baseline, back. Go!

386
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:30,683
Touch the line, touch the line!

387
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,720
* So what if that I'm cheatin'? * -Let's go!

388
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,645
Touch it with your fingers!
With your fingers!

389
00:22:40,618 --> 00:22:42,362
Yo, is this tryouts or Fight Club?

390
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:46,115
Dru, what's up with your boy?

391
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:48,215
Any of you tired?

392
00:22:48,793 --> 00:22:50,793
Worn out?

393
00:22:51,212 --> 00:22:52,538
Fatigued?

394
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,082
Maybe you're hungry.

395
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:57,327
If that's the case,
get out of my gym!

396
00:22:59,637 --> 00:23:01,637
Suicides. Again.

397
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:07,226
Burpees!

398
00:23:08,938 --> 00:23:10,938
Again!

399
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:12,809
Come on, hustle up!

400
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:14,909
Again.

401
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:21,526
You're slacking, team!

402
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:23,027
All right, gentlemen,
bear crawl.

403
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:26,527
Bear crawl now and you stand tall later.

404
00:23:31,586 --> 00:23:33,162
Yo, if that was tryouts.

405
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:36,824
I don't even want to think about
actual practice.

406
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:38,209
I'd rather quit school and join the Marines...

407
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:39,502
...then do that shit again.

408
00:23:39,602 --> 00:23:40,753
Maybe Buchtel will take us back.

409
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:43,631
Oh, my God,
listen to y'all, man.

410
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:45,425
We made the team, right?

411
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:47,525
So stop trippin'.

412
00:23:47,614 --> 00:23:49,262
The only reason why we here
is 'cause you a midget.

413
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,222
Now we all gotta suffer.

414
00:23:51,322 --> 00:23:54,225
No, we came here 'cause we the Fab Four.

415
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:56,019
You think them hatin'-ass seniors...

416
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,521
...and coach cuckoo bird give
a shit about the Fab Four?

417
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:01,596
Dude threw a basketball at my head.

418
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:05,945
What's up, man?
I've been waiting in the car...

419
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,864
...for, like, ten minutes.

420
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:10,199
Oh, oh, s-sorry, man.

421
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:13,359
I would ask y'all how it went but...

422
00:24:14,337 --> 00:24:16,414
All right, come on,
I can't be late for work, man.

423
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:18,041
Come on. We gotta go.

424
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:23,071
And if any of y'all want a ride,
y'all better come on, too.

425
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,384
Hey, listen.

426
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:30,219
Let it play out, a'ight?

427
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,387
It's day one.

428
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:34,757
It'll get better when the season starts.

429
00:24:34,857 --> 00:24:36,351
Yo, this is some bullshit.

430
00:24:36,451 --> 00:24:38,311
What'd you say?
- This is some bullshit.

431
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:41,481
Grab the ball!

432
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:43,775
How we benchwarmin' while
Romeo Travis, of all people,

433
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,610
gets to start for Central?

434
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,689
I still owe him an ass whoopin'
for stealin' my J's.

435
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:51,741
He beat yo ass. I was there.

436
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:54,460
Ha.
- He did beat your ass.

437
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:56,829
What you lookin' at, munchkin?

438
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,916
Yo, Coach! Yo, Coach, put me in!

439
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:01,251
I don't think coach heard you, dawg.

440
00:25:01,351 --> 00:25:03,044
Jermaine!
- For the 15th time.

441
00:25:03,144 --> 00:25:06,581
You keep yellin' at him,
he ain't never gonna play us.

442
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:09,401
They're not very good, huh?
- No.

443
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:12,937
Hey!
- Goddamn it!

444
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:17,525
Marlon. Marlon, come on in.

445
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:19,477
Get your soft ass down.

446
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:21,854
Uh, Willie, you're in the game.

447
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:23,356
Oh, me?
- Let's go.

448
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,483
Yo, yo, go, go! -Go!

449
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,443
Hey, yo, Unc! Hey, Unc!

450
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:28,945
Let's go, Unc!

451
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:30,905
Come on, come on, press it up.

452
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:32,532
Come on, Willie,
get over it. -Come on, Irish.

453
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:35,267
He right there, he right there!

454
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,996
Let's go, Willie.
- Pass the ball, pass the ball.

455
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:39,622
Give him the ball!

456
00:25:39,722 --> 00:25:41,040
Hey, pass him the ball. Pass it.

457
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,750
Come on, man.
- Come on, man.

458
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,127
This some bullshit.

459
00:25:44,227 --> 00:25:45,962
They ain't passing Willie the ball.

460
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:47,547
He ain't gettin' no love.
- Why you holding onto it?

461
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,340
Shut up, Dru.

462
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,883
Just shut up.

463
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,844
Give it to three-four!
- All right now.

464
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:54,971
Defense, Willie!

465
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:56,514
Yo, yo.
- Yeah, Willie.

466
00:25:56,614 --> 00:25:58,614
There he is, yeah.

467
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:09,235
Ain't no way you ain't makin'
the rotation after tonight.

468
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:10,903
Just sayin', if they would've
put you in earlier,

469
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,196
we would've won.

470
00:26:12,296 --> 00:26:13,948
You was the only one playin' D.

471
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:15,241
Man, if we all was out there,

472
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,819
we would've been blew they ass out.

473
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,469
So y'all got something to say?

474
00:26:20,588 --> 00:26:22,123
Nobody was talkin' to you.

475
00:26:22,223 --> 00:26:23,416
If you got a problem with the rotation,

476
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:25,501
go ahead and take it up with coach.

477
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:27,003
But that's right.

478
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:28,504
'Cause he don't want
to hear shit you gotta say.

479
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:30,840
We ain't come to not play.
- But y'all ain't special.

480
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,717
You pay your dues just like we had to,

481
00:26:32,817 --> 00:26:34,344
like everybody.

482
00:26:34,444 --> 00:26:36,179
And if you don't like it,
then quit.

483
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:38,348
Y'all ain't doin' nothin' else
out there other than losin'.

484
00:26:38,448 --> 00:26:39,766
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

485
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:41,434
What'd you say?

486
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:42,518
Oh, you heard me.

487
00:26:42,618 --> 00:26:43,853
Yeah, you deaf?

488
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:45,229
Want me to say it louder,
Mr. seven points,

489
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:46,856
five rebounds, four turnovers?

490
00:26:46,956 --> 00:26:48,191
The season hasn't even started yet...

491
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:49,692
...and I'm already sick of these punks.

492
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:51,361
Man, what?
- What'd you say?

493
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:53,363
Hold on. All right,
all right, all right, all right.

494
00:26:53,463 --> 00:26:54,739
So y'all think you're better than us, right?

495
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,699
Duh.
- For sure.

496
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,534
So meet here tomorrow at 4:00...

497
00:26:58,634 --> 00:26:59,953
...and then we'll see what's up.

498
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:02,413
Man, girls volleyball practice is at 4:00.

499
00:27:02,513 --> 00:27:03,706
How do you know that?

500
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:05,875
How you not?

501
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:08,127
I mean,
Bettes Park is always open.

502
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,227
If y'all ain't scared.

503
00:27:11,139 --> 00:27:13,349
Y'all versus the Fab Four.

504
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,562
Oh.

505
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:28,898
I didn't think you guys
were gonna show up.

506
00:27:28,998 --> 00:27:30,400
Why?

507
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Ain't nobody scared.

508
00:27:35,997 --> 00:27:37,407
Those matchin' shirts is cute.

509
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:40,567
Well, you gotta earn these, playboy.

510
00:27:41,252 --> 00:27:44,747
Hey, James Podeski.

511
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:47,750
But, uh, you can call me Jimmy.

512
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,230
Cap said I'm your fifth man?

513
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,591
First to 21?

514
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:56,691
Let's do it.

515
00:27:58,102 --> 00:28:00,102
We up.

516
00:28:02,732 --> 00:28:05,143
Get up. Hey!

517
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:06,894
Yeah.
- Set me up, set me up.

518
00:28:06,994 --> 00:28:07,854
Swing, swing, swing. Yep.

519
00:28:07,954 --> 00:28:09,272
Nah, it's mine.

520
00:28:09,372 --> 00:28:11,182
Oh!

521
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:13,282
Push it!

522
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:15,778
Oh, get... take that.
- Oh, hey, Willie, Willie,

523
00:28:15,878 --> 00:28:17,280
you got it, you got it.

524
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,791
Oh, my goodness.
- Hey!

525
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:22,619
What up, Cap?

526
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:24,120
Willie McGee.

527
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,956
You know I'm about to go left
and dunk this, right?

528
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:29,056
Watch this, my nigga...

529
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:33,671
You are my sons!
- Oh-ho.

530
00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:35,131
Little ass freshman.

531
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:37,231
Go.
- Get up.

532
00:28:39,978 --> 00:28:42,055
Oh, my God!

533
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:43,264
Wow, that kid's a freshman.

534
00:28:43,364 --> 00:28:44,307
I've never seen anything like that.

535
00:28:44,407 --> 00:28:45,516
Hey, what should I do?

536
00:28:45,616 --> 00:28:48,336
You're doing it, man.
Keep it up.

537
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:20,176
Pass the rock. Damn, I'm open.

538
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:21,386
You don't have shit.

539
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:24,546
Man, they got us down 14-10.
Wake up.

540
00:29:40,955 --> 00:29:42,782
Was that gunfire?

541
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,325
So what,
they shootin' over there.

542
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:47,230
We shootin' over here.
Game point.

543
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:18,568
Yeah.

544
00:30:18,668 --> 00:30:19,736
Yeah, Akron style, man!
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

545
00:30:19,836 --> 00:30:20,903
Yeah, yeah.

546
00:30:21,003 --> 00:30:23,003
Good game, Sian.
- Yeah.

547
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:25,665
Yo, Coach.

548
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:28,834
You hungry?

549
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:35,752
Well, they obviously never get
tired of playing basketball.

550
00:30:35,852 --> 00:30:37,086
What else do they do?

551
00:30:37,186 --> 00:30:38,796
Oh, sometimes they play video games.

552
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:40,896
Thank you.
- Coach,

553
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:42,592
basketball video games.

554
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:44,692
Yeah, that is true.

555
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:47,597
Well, they show a lot of passion.

556
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:48,765
Especially Dru.

557
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:50,558
Yeah, my boy can be a bit of a hothead.

558
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:53,269
The other boys put him
in check though, you know.

559
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:56,022
They all kind of balance
each other out like that.

560
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:57,315
Guess I'm lucky.

561
00:30:57,415 --> 00:30:59,150
What do you mean?

562
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,818
I was just trying to find good kids.

563
00:31:00,918 --> 00:31:04,572
I wasn't trying to make the best
AAU team when they were young.

564
00:31:04,672 --> 00:31:05,949
Willie...

565
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:08,952
I first saw Willie at a YMCA game.

566
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:10,370
He was amazing.

567
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,791
He was crossing over kids twice his size.

568
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:16,376
Both his parents...

569
00:31:16,476 --> 00:31:19,420
...addicts in Chicago.

570
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,882
His big brother Illya took him in...

571
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:26,961
...and became his legal guardian
at the age of 18.

572
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:28,888
Saved his little brother's life.

573
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,515
Geez.

574
00:31:30,615 --> 00:31:34,852
Sian... I go to church with
Sian's dad, um, Lee Cotton.

575
00:31:34,952 --> 00:31:38,106
You know, we just wanted Sian
to work off a little bit of...

576
00:31:38,206 --> 00:31:40,108
...a little bit of his baby fat.

577
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,651
I hear you.

578
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:45,571
My boy, Dru? Dru was born
with basketball in his blood.

579
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:51,002
I used to read John Wooden's
book to him in his crib.

580
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:55,373
Now it doesn't hurt that he was so tall,

581
00:31:55,473 --> 00:31:58,251
but I picked LeBron because he had skills...

582
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:00,637
...and was a-a good kid.

583
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:03,006
His mom, she gotta work.

584
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:05,258
She can't always be there,
she gotta pull down shifts...

585
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:09,304
...so she just wants a spot
where he can be safe,

586
00:32:09,404 --> 00:32:12,682
stay busy and not get in any trouble.

587
00:32:12,782 --> 00:32:16,728
If they have the-the opportunity
to keep playing together,

588
00:32:16,828 --> 00:32:18,855
it's gonna be special.

589
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:20,398
Listen, thank you.

590
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:23,026
Thanks for coming over
and-and checking on the boys.

591
00:32:23,126 --> 00:32:24,527
Well, I should be thanking you.

592
00:32:24,627 --> 00:32:26,571
I was trying to keep them humble.

593
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:28,406
Good luck with that.

594
00:32:28,506 --> 00:32:30,950
We play St. V's ball today, right?

595
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,410
All right, all in on three.

596
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,671
One, two, three.
- All in.

597
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:37,957
Willie McGee voted

598
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:41,044
Mr. Basketball Youth League
Ohio Valley last year...

599
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:43,864
...gets his first start tonight.

600
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:46,597
Willie!

601
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:00,396
It's hard to believe...

602
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:03,399
...he was just an eighth grader last season.

603
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:05,526
He really contributed to St. Vincent's...

604
00:33:05,626 --> 00:33:07,403
...young basketball season so far.
- Time! Ref, time out!

605
00:33:07,503 --> 00:33:09,280
What? -
- Come on, come on.

606
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,240
Hustle in.
- Come on, boys, focus.

607
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,617
Jake, what's your problem?

608
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:14,243
You're not even in position,
okay? -Huh?

609
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:16,079
Uh, LeBron. You're in the game.
Let's go.

610
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:18,559
Come on, come on, play ball.

611
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:27,305
You go, baby!

612
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:34,222
There we go, they got Willie
and LeBron in the game,

613
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:35,682
they gonna kill.

614
00:33:35,782 --> 00:33:37,392
This is crap!
Let's see what happens, huh?

615
00:33:37,492 --> 00:33:40,311
This is ridiculous!

616
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:42,272
Jake, stop the ball!

617
00:33:42,372 --> 00:33:44,372
Yeah, let's go!

618
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,204
Oh, boy. Wow.

619
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh, that was special.

620
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,251
Time out!

621
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:05,962
LeBron James slams!

622
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:07,380
Ah, let's try this.

623
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,007
Come here.

624
00:34:09,107 --> 00:34:11,676
Take a seat.
It's all right, take a seat.

625
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:14,095
Sit down, sit down. Here we go.

626
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:15,555
Lil Dru, you're in the game.

627
00:34:15,655 --> 00:34:17,265
Let's go.
Come on, come on, check in.

628
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:18,474
Get in this game!

629
00:34:18,574 --> 00:34:20,810
Sian, get on the court.
Let's go.

630
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,978
Play ball.

631
00:34:22,078 --> 00:34:23,438
And Dambrot is doubling down...

632
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:25,648
...putting two more freshmen in the game.

633
00:34:25,748 --> 00:34:27,958
Sian Cotton and Dru Joyce.

634
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:32,344
It's not how you start the game...!

635
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:34,955
Let's finish it!

636
00:34:46,636 --> 00:34:48,671
Dambrot. Dambrot.

637
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:51,633
Dambrot! What the hell?!

638
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:53,885
They're freshmen!
- Let's go, let's go.

639
00:34:53,985 --> 00:34:56,262
My son is a senior.
I want him playing.

640
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,430
Playing a freshman.

641
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,140
What is this, Hoop It Up?

642
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,517
We usually give more playing
time to the upperclassmen.

643
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:02,727
It-it's a policy.

644
00:35:02,827 --> 00:35:05,887
Yeah, well,
policy doesn't win games.

645
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:25,262
He's a freshman! Take it out!

646
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,719
A steal from Cotton.

647
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:31,816
Outlet passes to Joyce.

648
00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:37,418
Off the backboard
and James slams it home!

649
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:41,391
Look, I don't think I'm overstating...

650
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:42,642
...that we way be seeing the beginnings...

651
00:35:42,742 --> 00:35:45,395
...of something special here in Akron.

652
00:35:45,495 --> 00:35:48,130
That's how these freshman play!

653
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,269
Yeah? -Spencer Keizler from The Chronicle.

654
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:27,395
Well, thanks, Coach.

655
00:36:27,495 --> 00:36:28,813
Um, what's it like coaching...

656
00:36:28,913 --> 00:36:30,982
...the best high school
player in the country?

657
00:36:31,082 --> 00:36:33,082
Who, LeBron?

658
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:34,569
Yeah, best player, my ass.

659
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:37,389
Kid's always loafing on defense.

660
00:36:44,921 --> 00:36:46,623
Max Winter from The Post.
- Hey, Max.

661
00:36:46,723 --> 00:36:48,166
What about you, Coach?
You thinking about returning...

662
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:49,834
...back to college any time soon?

663
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:52,629
I'm right in the middle of a
season with this crazy bunch,

664
00:36:52,729 --> 00:36:54,339
so, uh...

665
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:58,774
Yeah. Hell yeah, I'm thinking
about it all the time.

666
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,366
This the last doughnut.

667
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:22,825
You want half?
- It's all you.

668
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:25,370
I'm good.
I'm tryin' to watch my weight.

669
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,537
Mmm.

670
00:37:26,637 --> 00:37:28,847
Watch your weight do what?

671
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:30,792
What you mean, 'Do what,' man?

672
00:37:30,892 --> 00:37:32,627
You watching your weight. What? Do what?

673
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:35,277
I'm tryin' to eat better, man.

674
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:37,471
Hey, guys!

675
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:42,465
How's it feel to be pimping for St. Vincent?

676
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:54,607
Gonna be a brick next time,

677
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:57,257
you get on the coaching staff.

678
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:11,666
Uh, Mr. Wahl?
- I'm on deadline. What?

679
00:38:11,766 --> 00:38:13,126
60 seconds to run something by you?

680
00:38:13,226 --> 00:38:15,628
I'll be at my office in 30 so talk twice as fast.

681
00:38:15,728 --> 00:38:17,130
'After a forfeit from Buchtel,

682
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,382
'St. Vincent-St. Mary's finished
its undefeated season...

683
00:38:19,482 --> 00:38:22,552
...with a 73-55 win over Greenview
High for the state title.'

684
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:24,220
This is high school basketball?

685
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,180
My old rival high school, sir.

686
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,558
Feels like filler for the kid's
magazine. Anything else?

687
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:30,184
The star players were four freshmen.

688
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:32,645
I think one in particular
could be the next Jordan.

689
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:33,688
Kobe Bryant's the next Jordan.

690
00:38:33,788 --> 00:38:35,231
So maybe he's the next Kobe?

691
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:37,809
Kobe's too young to have a next.

692
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:40,374
Keep me posted on wonder boy.

693
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:41,446
What's his name anyway?

694
00:38:41,546 --> 00:38:42,697
Hey, yo, Bron.

695
00:38:42,797 --> 00:38:44,532
Check this out, my dawg.

696
00:38:44,632 --> 00:38:47,377
Hmm?
- Looking like that, man.

697
00:38:48,336 --> 00:38:50,913
Um... we ain't order this.

698
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:52,665
My manager went to St. V's.
Says enjoy.

699
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:55,927
It's on the house, baby.

700
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:57,712
Oh...

701
00:38:57,812 --> 00:38:59,422
Yo, by all means,

702
00:38:59,522 --> 00:39:02,327
this year finna be straight fire.

703
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:03,927
Facts.
- Hey.

704
00:39:04,027 --> 00:39:05,553
I know y'all seen her checkin' me out.

705
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:07,096
Man, she was checkin' me out.

706
00:39:07,196 --> 00:39:08,890
Y'all ain't got no game though.

707
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,643
Unlike y'all, I get girls.

708
00:39:11,743 --> 00:39:13,436
Since when?

709
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:15,536
Melody.

710
00:39:16,155 --> 00:39:17,565
Bro, y'all just hugged that one time.

711
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:19,275
Was it Melody from seventh grade?

712
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:20,818
Yo, you're still on that?

713
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:22,278
He's still on that.
- Talkin' about the girl...

714
00:39:22,378 --> 00:39:23,446
...from seventh grade.

715
00:39:23,546 --> 00:39:25,546
Hey, shut up.

716
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:29,953
Yo...

717
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:31,454
Oh, yo!

718
00:39:31,554 --> 00:39:32,789
Nah.
- What up?

719
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:34,123
Illya'd never lets you drive his joint.

720
00:39:34,223 --> 00:39:36,918
You right, but it ain't his whip no more.

721
00:39:37,018 --> 00:39:38,544
You heard he got a new car, right?

722
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:40,644
Know what that mean.

723
00:39:41,222 --> 00:39:43,222
We in business!

724
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:37,395
Last year is last year.

725
00:40:37,495 --> 00:40:40,523
Doesn't do shit for us anymore
but put a big target on our ass.

726
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:42,692
If we don't win at all,
they'll say it's a fluke.

727
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:43,943
And it'll be a fluke.

728
00:40:44,043 --> 00:40:46,933
Maybe you see some new faces here.

729
00:40:47,038 --> 00:40:48,573
This is Mr. Travis,
who did us the favor...

730
00:40:48,673 --> 00:40:52,285
...of getting expelled again so
that he could be here with us.

731
00:40:52,385 --> 00:40:54,203
What you lookin' at, munchkin?

732
00:40:54,303 --> 00:40:57,373
Lucky for him, I value good
defense over bad behavior,

733
00:40:57,473 --> 00:40:59,473
so, listen up, Romeo,

734
00:40:59,545 --> 00:41:01,961
pull any shit on my team,

735
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:04,505
you consider yourself permanently retired.

736
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:06,007
Oh, this here is Coach Dru.

737
00:41:06,107 --> 00:41:07,967
Some of you all know him,
I think.

738
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:09,427
We need him on the schedule...

739
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:10,803
Wait, whoa, ho, ho, ho.

740
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,139
No, he's not gonna save you all.

741
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,265
Right?

742
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:15,433
We're gonna win it all...

743
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:17,685
...because you're gonna
work your asses off.

744
00:41:17,785 --> 00:41:19,687
That's how this works.
All right?

745
00:41:19,787 --> 00:41:20,939
Let's go.

746
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,732
Come on, bring it in on three.

747
00:41:22,832 --> 00:41:24,957
One, two, three.
- All in!

748
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:30,997
Man, why...

749
00:41:31,073 --> 00:41:32,992
Why you slide? Why you slide?

750
00:41:33,092 --> 00:41:34,744
Watch out.

751
00:41:34,844 --> 00:41:37,005
You watch out.

752
00:41:41,134 --> 00:41:43,294
It's not that he really
broke another kid's jaw?

753
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:46,214
Man, do we even know
he broke the first kid's jaw?

754
00:41:46,314 --> 00:41:49,884
Well, he here now so he had
to break somebody's jaw.

755
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:51,984
Let's go say somethin'.

756
00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:54,180
Hell no.

757
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,807
We can't keep ignoring him.

758
00:41:55,907 --> 00:41:57,350
What we gonna do on the court,
sign language?

759
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,185
What's wrong with that?

760
00:41:59,285 --> 00:42:00,770
Man, let's just go say wussup.

761
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:03,590
Yo, stop acting scary.
- Hey, yo.

762
00:42:04,907 --> 00:42:07,026
Food don't got much seasonin' on it, but...

763
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:09,070
...you gonna get used to it.

764
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,655
What y'all want, man?

765
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:14,617
Look, bro, we on the same team,
so we might as well talk.

766
00:42:14,717 --> 00:42:15,910
You can save all that fake shit.

767
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,370
See? I told y'all this career criminal...

768
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,913
...wasn't worth our time.

769
00:42:19,013 --> 00:42:20,456
You lucky you got them little
dress shoes on...

770
00:42:20,556 --> 00:42:21,708
...or I'd take them, too.

771
00:42:21,808 --> 00:42:23,334
Yo, I'd like to see you try.
- Dru.

772
00:42:23,434 --> 00:42:25,434
Dru. Chill.

773
00:42:26,262 --> 00:42:29,257
Look, dawg,
we got a good thing goin'.

774
00:42:29,357 --> 00:42:33,607
All we want to know is
if you tryin' to mess it up.

775
00:42:44,906 --> 00:42:46,691
I tried.

776
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:48,943
I guess, but...

777
00:42:49,043 --> 00:42:50,903
You can't be serious.

778
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:52,697
See he wasn't gonna eat it.

779
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:54,797
Oh, your fat ass.

780
00:42:58,169 --> 00:43:01,456
Sian Cotton!

781
00:43:01,556 --> 00:43:03,556
Yeah, yeah.

782
00:43:03,607 --> 00:43:05,607
Willie McGee!

783
00:43:09,013 --> 00:43:10,798
Dru Joyce!

784
00:43:10,898 --> 00:43:14,469
Romeo Travis!

785
00:43:14,569 --> 00:43:18,356
LeBron James!

786
00:43:25,613 --> 00:43:27,613
I can't hear you.

787
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:35,531
And it's a capacity
crowd here tonight in Akron.

788
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:38,451
This place is bursting at the seams...

789
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:40,370
Pass the ball.
Pass the ball, Dru.

790
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,246
...as defending state champions St. V's...

791
00:43:42,346 --> 00:43:44,207
...takes on perennial powerhouse Massillon.

792
00:43:44,307 --> 00:43:45,875
Hey, Dru!

793
00:43:45,975 --> 00:43:48,002
Pass the ball next time!
He was wide open!

794
00:43:48,102 --> 00:43:49,712
Yo, listen to your pop, midget.

795
00:43:49,812 --> 00:43:50,797
Kiss my ass.

796
00:43:50,897 --> 00:43:53,192
Can't nobody bend that low.

797
00:43:54,225 --> 00:43:56,135
Ooh, Travis blocks the shot.

798
00:43:56,235 --> 00:43:58,179
LeBron James grabs the rebound.

799
00:43:58,279 --> 00:44:03,059
That looks like he's going coast-to-coast!

800
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:08,031
And that's what
we call a guaranteed bucket.

801
00:44:10,575 --> 00:44:12,986
H-Have you ever
heard the story of King Arthur?

802
00:44:13,086 --> 00:44:14,946
Yes, sir.

803
00:44:15,046 --> 00:44:17,407
The boy that would be king.

804
00:44:17,507 --> 00:44:19,450
Yeah, Bob, I mean,
the score is so lopsided,

805
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,911
the starting five are resting on the bench...

806
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:23,746
...and some of the reserves
get a go at the Tigers.

807
00:44:23,846 --> 00:44:25,665
Bro, it's gonna be so many
chicks at that party.

808
00:44:25,765 --> 00:44:27,166
I'm telling you.

809
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:29,752
I got two of their cheerleaders'
numbers before the game.

810
00:44:29,852 --> 00:44:31,588
And their team sucks.

811
00:44:31,688 --> 00:44:32,922
They want us there.

812
00:44:33,022 --> 00:44:34,882
And it's gonna be packed out.

813
00:44:34,982 --> 00:44:36,217
I don't know, man.

814
00:44:36,317 --> 00:44:37,802
Yo, what's the point of bein' popular...

815
00:44:37,902 --> 00:44:40,221
...if we just gonna hang out
all night at Dru's playin' 2K...

816
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:42,307
...and wait for Girls Gone Wild
commercials to come on?

817
00:44:42,407 --> 00:44:44,767
I like Girls Gone Wild.
- Huh.

818
00:44:44,867 --> 00:44:46,102
E pluribus unum, nigga.

819
00:44:46,202 --> 00:44:48,202
Seize the day.

820
00:44:48,946 --> 00:44:51,156
I say we go to that bitch.

821
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:57,030
All right, so,
maybe this was a good idea.

822
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,573
Told you.

823
00:44:58,673 --> 00:45:00,673
Come on.

824
00:45:24,857 --> 00:45:26,857
LeBron James.

825
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:30,563
Tequila or... vodka.
- How are you?

826
00:45:30,663 --> 00:45:32,663
Vodka.

827
00:45:59,017 --> 00:46:01,017
Excuse me, miss.

828
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:03,473
You was at the game tonight?

829
00:46:08,276 --> 00:46:11,863
Okay, I gotta be trippin'.

830
00:46:27,128 --> 00:46:29,338
I'm gonna catch you later.

831
00:46:30,715 --> 00:46:32,715
Oh!

832
00:46:32,842 --> 00:46:35,003
Yo, for real?!
- I-I'm so sorry.

833
00:46:35,103 --> 00:46:37,680
Ya think? Agh!

834
00:46:43,853 --> 00:46:45,853
Oh.

835
00:46:46,064 --> 00:46:47,390
I'm-I'm so sorry.

836
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,142
I did not mean to do that.
- Look, it's fine.

837
00:46:49,242 --> 00:46:51,019
Just leave me alone.

838
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,521
Here. Take it.

839
00:46:53,621 --> 00:46:55,621
Please.

840
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,902
St. V's?

841
00:47:00,002 --> 00:47:01,571
Pretty far from home.

842
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:05,158
N-Nah, it's just my boy drove... -It's cool.

843
00:47:05,258 --> 00:47:06,784
I go to Buchtel.

844
00:47:06,884 --> 00:47:09,009
My cousin invited me out.

845
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:11,077
Buchtel, huh?

846
00:47:11,673 --> 00:47:13,124
Yeah, why?

847
00:47:13,224 --> 00:47:15,126
They don't like me too much over there.

848
00:47:15,226 --> 00:47:18,201
Why, you throw drinks on them, too?

849
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:22,725
Nah, just you.

850
00:47:28,856 --> 00:47:31,526
Well, you got some nerve.

851
00:47:36,864 --> 00:47:39,492
I'm Savannah.

852
00:47:40,201 --> 00:47:42,201
I know.

853
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,250
Mm.

854
00:47:49,836 --> 00:47:51,613
Hmm.

855
00:47:51,713 --> 00:47:54,040
This is what you call...

856
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,750
...a hangover!

857
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,850
Why you yellin'?

858
00:47:58,678 --> 00:48:01,738
Play stupid games,
win stupid prizes.

859
00:48:07,895 --> 00:48:10,265
Okay, Don Juan.

860
00:48:10,365 --> 00:48:12,692
Who's the girl?

861
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,610
Your hand.

862
00:48:17,739 --> 00:48:19,949
Her name's Savannah.

863
00:48:21,075 --> 00:48:23,486
Savannah?

864
00:48:23,586 --> 00:48:24,445
Hmm.

865
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:26,739
She cute?

866
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:28,839
What you think?

867
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:32,120
I don't know,
you kinda goofy looking.

868
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,871
I don't know what you might attract.

869
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:35,865
Ma.

870
00:48:35,965 --> 00:48:38,175
I'm just playin' with you.

871
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,304
You know you handsome.

872
00:48:44,265 --> 00:48:45,383
Drink up.

873
00:48:45,483 --> 00:48:47,935
You're gonna need it.

874
00:48:49,103 --> 00:48:52,632
Can I borrow your car
next weekend to take her out?

875
00:48:52,732 --> 00:48:56,019
Sorry, baby, I picked up some
night shifts next weekend.

876
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:58,738
It's okay, I'll figure it out.

877
00:49:01,616 --> 00:49:04,110
I don't know why you had
to keep asking for more bread.

878
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,612
They told you the kitchen was closed.

879
00:49:05,712 --> 00:49:07,530
They wasn't gonna do nothin'
but throw it away.

880
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,907
I want my full dining experience
with my leftovers.

881
00:49:10,007 --> 00:49:12,085
Okay, whatever.

882
00:49:18,132 --> 00:49:20,418
Let me see.

883
00:49:20,518 --> 00:49:23,153
You know I got the magic touch.

884
00:49:23,304 --> 00:49:25,431
You know I-I got this.

885
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:32,311
There you go.

886
00:49:33,064 --> 00:49:34,390
Nice try,
but you don't get points...

887
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:37,594
...for opening my door after I already tried.

888
00:49:37,694 --> 00:49:39,312
You a hater.

889
00:49:39,412 --> 00:49:41,412
Yeah.

890
00:49:51,082 --> 00:49:52,241
Really?

891
00:49:52,341 --> 00:49:54,202
This is not my car.

892
00:49:54,302 --> 00:49:56,037
It's my boy Willie's.
- Mm.

893
00:49:56,137 --> 00:49:58,464
Mm-hmm.
- It sucks.

894
00:50:02,802 --> 00:50:06,032
I'm sorry.
Let's just give it a minute.

895
00:50:32,957 --> 00:50:35,660
And we're always in the fight!

896
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,121
You can't get us,
we're always in the fight!

897
00:50:38,221 --> 00:50:40,957
Yeah, we are Buchtel
and we're always in the fight!

898
00:50:41,057 --> 00:50:42,375
There they go.

899
00:50:42,475 --> 00:50:45,795
You can't get us,
we're always in the fight!

900
00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:47,088
We are Buchtel...!

901
00:50:47,188 --> 00:50:48,256
LeBron is a sellout!

902
00:50:48,356 --> 00:50:50,133
Who you calling a sellout, Tony?

903
00:50:50,233 --> 00:50:52,953
You still owe me $100! Sit down!

904
00:50:54,687 --> 00:50:55,888
Hey, fellas, let's focus.

905
00:50:55,988 --> 00:50:58,308
Let's pay no mind to all this bullshit.

906
00:50:58,408 --> 00:51:00,727
These the same dudes
who called us sellouts.

907
00:51:00,827 --> 00:51:03,972
Same dudes who tried to put me on JV.

908
00:51:04,572 --> 00:51:07,025
I ain't losin' tonight.

909
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,125
Period.

910
00:51:25,093 --> 00:51:26,336
Come on, now!

911
00:51:26,436 --> 00:51:28,379
Come on, call that foul!
You blind?

912
00:51:28,479 --> 00:51:29,380
Daydreaming!

913
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,480
Ah, no, no, no!

914
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,350
Come on!

915
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:40,231
Time out! Bring it in.

916
00:51:41,818 --> 00:51:45,480
Yeah, we are Buchtel
and we're always in the fight!

917
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,190
Taking a walk! Get in here!

918
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:48,650
You got pride.

919
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,986
We gonna let these people
over here disrespect us?

920
00:51:52,086 --> 00:51:53,237
No, we're not.

921
00:51:53,337 --> 00:51:54,447
It's a mismatch out there.

922
00:51:54,547 --> 00:51:55,865
You're too small and-and the refs,

923
00:51:55,965 --> 00:51:59,960
they're swallowing the whistle,
so take a break.

924
00:52:01,295 --> 00:52:02,664
Sit down, Dru.

925
00:52:02,764 --> 00:52:05,583
All in on three.
One, two, three.

926
00:52:05,683 --> 00:52:07,683
All in.

927
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:13,049
Dru, what are you doing?

928
00:52:13,149 --> 00:52:14,592
Lock in, boy.

929
00:52:14,692 --> 00:52:16,803
Oh, Dru Joyce is checking into the game.

930
00:52:16,903 --> 00:52:19,180
Diminutive would be
a vast understatement.

931
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,445
He's all of five feet,
two inches tall. -Sit down.

932
00:52:27,697 --> 00:52:29,822
Dru, that's not the play!

933
00:52:33,328 --> 00:52:34,904
He's not bashful
either. Those guys are on him.

934
00:52:35,004 --> 00:52:38,234
They're flying at him.
He doesn't care.

935
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:45,748
No, no!

936
00:52:45,848 --> 00:52:48,084
Long three by Dru Joyce.

937
00:52:48,184 --> 00:52:50,184
And he stuck it again.

938
00:52:50,277 --> 00:52:53,590
You almost couldn't see him
shoot it, and he stuck it.

939
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:56,580
Got to be proud of the little guy.

940
00:52:59,687 --> 00:53:02,015
Oh, no, don't shoot that.

941
00:53:02,115 --> 00:53:04,225
Dru Joyce gets open deep in the corner...

942
00:53:04,325 --> 00:53:06,269
...and he'd done it again.

943
00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:08,605
Dru Joyce has the fans
here today -He's hot, he's hot.

944
00:53:08,705 --> 00:53:13,465
just in disbelief at his
ability to shoot the basketball.

945
00:53:16,913 --> 00:53:18,698
This looks like the Irish...

946
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:20,366
...just want to pass it around the outside...

947
00:53:20,466 --> 00:53:22,466
...and look for the...

948
00:53:24,003 --> 00:53:25,455
Is he's shooting that or throwing it?

949
00:53:25,555 --> 00:53:27,790
He's catching it, his feet set...

950
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:29,918
...and he just knocked it down.
That's five of them.

951
00:53:30,018 --> 00:53:33,588
Here we go. Five for five.
- Five for five.

952
00:53:40,228 --> 00:53:42,263
He's gonna try another one.

953
00:53:42,363 --> 00:53:44,363
Check this out.

954
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:47,977
Six for six, Dru Joyce.

955
00:53:48,077 --> 00:53:52,315
He had 18 points
in six minutes of court time.

956
00:53:52,415 --> 00:53:54,400
Well, but he's...
he's pretty big today.

957
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,735
Six for six from behind...

958
00:53:55,835 --> 00:53:57,946
...the three-point.
- No question about it.

959
00:53:58,046 --> 00:54:01,783
18 points for Dru Joyce
to lead everyone in scoring...

960
00:54:01,883 --> 00:54:05,253
...for Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary.

961
00:54:08,631 --> 00:54:10,631
Good game.

962
00:54:31,154 --> 00:54:33,523
Good game, guys.
Everybody on the bus.

963
00:54:33,623 --> 00:54:35,858
Yeah. Rat-a-tat-tat.

964
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:40,803
Boy, you wet them fools up.
That's what I'm talking about.

965
00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:57,130
Where you going? You thought you
wasn't gonna see us again.

966
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,923
Not gonna deal with y'all
right now, man, move.

967
00:54:59,023 --> 00:55:01,828
I'm talking to you.
- Sellout ass.

968
00:55:02,101 --> 00:55:03,553
Where's the rest of your cheap ass team?

969
00:55:03,653 --> 00:55:05,096
Yo, that's Romeo.

970
00:55:05,196 --> 00:55:07,916
That's Romeo.
- Yo, Dru, hold up.

971
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:11,651
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo!

972
00:55:12,737 --> 00:55:14,230
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

973
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,608
What is wrong with you?

974
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:18,985
That was stupid.
- Man, what?

975
00:55:19,085 --> 00:55:20,236
You out here having
Ultimate Fighting Championships...

976
00:55:20,336 --> 00:55:22,030
...by yoself.
- Literally, bro.

977
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:23,823
You didn't have to do that shit, bro.

978
00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:26,473
Huh. We beat they ass, though.

979
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:28,286
Oh, my God.

980
00:55:28,386 --> 00:55:32,824
I know y'all seen Dru come
through with the Falcon Punch.

981
00:55:32,924 --> 00:55:34,959
Yeah, but who were they, though?

982
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:36,419
Don't worry about it.
They was nobody.

983
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:39,494
Yeah, nobody till we beat they ass.

984
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,843
LeBron. Six-six, yep.

985
00:55:43,943 --> 00:55:46,387
And he ain't even done growing.

986
00:55:46,487 --> 00:55:47,931
Yes.

987
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:50,058
Special. Very, very special.

988
00:55:50,158 --> 00:55:51,684
Well, just come,
come and see for yourself.

989
00:55:51,784 --> 00:55:54,278
His next game is this Friday.

990
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:58,107
A-All right, now.

991
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,442
Yes.

992
00:55:59,542 --> 00:56:01,542
Thank you. Good night.

993
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,914
So, who was that?

994
00:56:13,014 --> 00:56:14,499
That was Sports Illustrated.

995
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:17,202
They want to do a story on LeBron.

996
00:56:17,302 --> 00:56:19,302
Mm-hmm.

997
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:21,047
We have a big deal now.

998
00:56:21,147 --> 00:56:22,465
Well, look at that.

999
00:56:22,565 --> 00:56:24,726
My baby's a celebrity.

1000
00:56:27,228 --> 00:56:29,305
Yeah.

1001
00:56:29,405 --> 00:56:31,349
Guess you raised a baller.

1002
00:56:31,449 --> 00:56:33,449
Mm.

1003
00:56:39,824 --> 00:56:41,818
Coach, Coach. How long
you playing LeBron tonight?

1004
00:56:41,918 --> 00:56:43,486
The whole game? Half game?

1005
00:56:43,586 --> 00:56:45,321
Max, what don't you ask Coach
Dru a couple of these questions.

1006
00:56:45,421 --> 00:56:47,115
I got a game to win.

1007
00:56:47,215 --> 00:56:49,367
Hey, how you feeling
about coaching your son...

1008
00:56:49,467 --> 00:56:50,618
...in the championship game tonight?

1009
00:56:50,718 --> 00:56:52,161
I'm just an assistant,

1010
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:53,955
but I think we're getting
used to the dynamic. You know?

1011
00:56:54,055 --> 00:56:55,415
Yeah, you're gonna have to, right,

1012
00:56:55,515 --> 00:56:57,792
with Coach Dambrot
going back to college ball.

1013
00:56:57,892 --> 00:57:00,503
Where do you get your information from?

1014
00:57:00,603 --> 00:57:01,921
You leaving, Coach?

1015
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:03,715
No, don't listen...
- Yeah. Hell yeah.

1016
00:57:03,815 --> 00:57:05,008
University of Akron.

1017
00:57:05,108 --> 00:57:07,635
Deals done.
Tonight's the last game.

1018
00:57:07,735 --> 00:57:09,554
Is this not true?

1019
00:57:09,654 --> 00:57:11,347
What's with the questions?

1020
00:57:11,447 --> 00:57:12,515
Damn it.

1021
00:57:12,615 --> 00:57:15,151
Locker room, right now.

1022
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:21,908
Let's go!

1023
00:57:23,409 --> 00:57:24,819
Ball!

1024
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:27,864
No, he didn't touch him!

1025
00:57:27,964 --> 00:57:31,200
The 2001 Ohio State Championship...

1026
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,078
...is underway and St. Vincent-St. Mary's,

1027
00:57:34,178 --> 00:57:36,372
led by LeBron James,
are dominating.

1028
00:57:36,472 --> 00:57:38,800
Will you listen?

1029
00:57:39,592 --> 00:57:40,877
Listen to me.

1030
00:57:40,977 --> 00:57:43,867
Screen, screen, screen,
back, back.

1031
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:47,675
No, don't shoot that...

1032
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,594
Okay, okay.

1033
00:57:49,694 --> 00:57:51,220
Okay, get back.

1034
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,764
Yeah, the team is
playing with more individual...

1035
00:57:52,864 --> 00:57:55,391
...streetball style tonight.

1036
00:57:55,491 --> 00:57:57,060
Yeah, I agree.

1037
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,478
There's been a lot of showboating,

1038
00:57:58,578 --> 00:58:00,939
which is uncharacteristic
for a Dambrot team.

1039
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:03,066
Coach, why don't you try...

1040
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:04,817
...and talk some sense
into one of your boys, huh?

1041
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:06,027
They're not listening.

1042
00:58:06,127 --> 00:58:07,403
What's he doing over here?

1043
00:58:07,503 --> 00:58:09,447
This is ridiculous.
I gotta call time.

1044
00:58:09,547 --> 00:58:11,547
Dru!

1045
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:12,909
Time! Time!

1046
00:58:13,009 --> 00:58:14,327
Time.

1047
00:58:14,427 --> 00:58:15,912
Dru, Dru, what are you doing?

1048
00:58:16,012 --> 00:58:17,747
We got a game plan.
What are you doing?

1049
00:58:17,847 --> 00:58:20,291
One play, not one play we practiced.

1050
00:58:20,391 --> 00:58:21,709
You know, you...

1051
00:58:21,809 --> 00:58:24,587
You got some goddamn nerve,
Lil Dru.

1052
00:58:24,687 --> 00:58:26,687
I got a nerve?

1053
00:58:27,515 --> 00:58:29,842
We ain't run not one of
your plays this whole night...

1054
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:30,885
...and we still winning.

1055
00:58:30,985 --> 00:58:32,595
There's a game plan, Dru.

1056
00:58:32,695 --> 00:58:33,930
No, no, stop with the game plan shit.

1057
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:36,057
We don't need you,
we never needed you.

1058
00:58:36,157 --> 00:58:37,308
You just been riding our coattails...

1059
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:38,518
...ever since you got here.

1060
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:40,186
Dru. -Just so you could get your ticket out.

1061
00:58:40,286 --> 00:58:42,647
Yeah, yeah, but I worked
my ass off to build you up.

1062
00:58:42,747 --> 00:58:45,858
Nah, Coach,
you just got in the way.

1063
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,360
Now, if you want to leave...

1064
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,987
...cool, leave.

1065
00:58:49,087 --> 00:58:53,507
'Cause I promise, don't nobody
care around here, man.

1066
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:56,911
Bye. See ya. Sayonara.
- This is ridiculous.

1067
00:58:57,011 --> 00:58:58,413
C-Coach.
- Hey, Coach. Coach.

1068
00:58:58,513 --> 00:58:59,706
No, I'm not putting up with this shit.

1069
00:58:59,806 --> 00:59:01,806
Coach.

1070
00:59:01,874 --> 00:59:04,627
Coach, wait.

1071
00:59:04,727 --> 00:59:05,712
There's six minutes left.

1072
00:59:05,812 --> 00:59:07,937
It's a championship game.

1073
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:12,350
Coach.

1074
00:59:12,894 --> 00:59:14,137
Coach... -I'm not going to be disrespected...

1075
00:59:14,237 --> 00:59:15,597
...by a bunch of teenagers.

1076
00:59:15,697 --> 00:59:17,140
What do you expect?

1077
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,935
They look up to you,
and you're walking out on them.

1078
00:59:21,035 --> 00:59:22,812
So you want me to get 'em in a circle...

1079
00:59:22,912 --> 00:59:24,856
...and all hold hands and have a good cry?

1080
00:59:24,956 --> 00:59:26,956
I have an opportunity.

1081
00:59:27,742 --> 00:59:28,985
They'll get over this.

1082
00:59:29,085 --> 00:59:30,737
Most of these boys been getting over it...

1083
00:59:30,837 --> 00:59:32,363
...their entire lives.

1084
00:59:32,463 --> 00:59:34,407
Every time someone gets close to them,

1085
00:59:34,507 --> 00:59:38,119
they end up leaving,
abandoning them.

1086
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:41,497
Every single person that matters
to them has left.

1087
00:59:41,597 --> 00:59:43,597
Except you.

1088
00:59:44,175 --> 00:59:45,835
Coach, I tried to keep them humble.

1089
00:59:45,935 --> 00:59:48,755
You said it was going to be hard but...

1090
00:59:48,855 --> 00:59:52,340
...they're so damn good and they know it.

1091
00:59:52,558 --> 00:59:55,753
Just make sure that
doesn't tear them apart.

1092
00:59:55,853 --> 00:59:57,853
Hmm?

1093
00:59:57,904 --> 01:00:00,108
Got six minutes.

1094
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:10,076
Yeah. Heard he planned it all along.

1095
01:00:10,994 --> 01:00:13,196
Yeah, but what's he going to do?
Not go?

1096
01:00:13,296 --> 01:00:15,031
Screw that, Uncle Willie.

1097
01:00:15,131 --> 01:00:18,776
We the reason why he got a shot
in the first place.

1098
01:00:18,876 --> 01:00:20,787
Oh, Dru,
this shit not funny, bro.

1099
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:22,887
It's a serious matter.

1100
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:26,709
Bro, how can y'all be serious
with this comedy playin' out?

1101
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:30,046
Yo, stop tryin' to act hard!

1102
01:00:30,146 --> 01:00:32,146
With your soft ass.

1103
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:35,385
Man, stop making me laugh.

1104
01:00:35,485 --> 01:00:36,552
Yo.
- Oh.

1105
01:00:36,652 --> 01:00:38,554
Yo, what you doin'? Focus.

1106
01:00:38,654 --> 01:00:40,890
Stop worryin' about us.

1107
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:41,933
Yo, sit down.
- A'ight.

1108
01:00:42,033 --> 01:00:44,033
Oh, he mad.

1109
01:00:53,828 --> 01:00:56,781
Hey, yo, check this out.
Check this out.

1110
01:00:56,881 --> 01:00:58,881
That's my foot.

1111
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:03,579
How is that your foot?
I was standin' right behind him.

1112
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:06,332
Man, Ray Charles could see that
that's my lean chocolate calf.

1113
01:01:06,432 --> 01:01:09,252
That is not your ashy ass calf.

1114
01:01:09,352 --> 01:01:10,962
Ain't nothin' lean about that calf.

1115
01:01:11,062 --> 01:01:13,187
What y'all talking about?

1116
01:01:14,515 --> 01:01:17,176
I see it, I guess.

1117
01:01:17,276 --> 01:01:19,929
Yeah. Thanks, Ms. Gloria.

1118
01:01:20,029 --> 01:01:22,181
Bro, you can't tell she was bein' sarcastic?

1119
01:01:22,281 --> 01:01:24,281
Dang.
- What...?

1120
01:01:24,374 --> 01:01:27,312
Hey. Stop, st-stop it.
- Get him, Dru. Get him. Hit him.

1121
01:01:27,412 --> 01:01:29,272
Man, you hit hard for a little man.

1122
01:01:29,372 --> 01:01:30,607
Ma, can we buy your car...

1123
01:01:30,707 --> 01:01:32,900
...so we don't have to cram
into Willie's bucket?

1124
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,203
Sure, baby.

1125
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,873
Yo.

1126
01:01:46,973 --> 01:01:48,583
Yeah. Oh, damn.

1127
01:01:48,683 --> 01:01:50,710
Hold on.
- Yo!

1128
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:53,212
Oh, yo, this is art.

1129
01:01:53,312 --> 01:01:55,798
We in the front,
We in the front.

1130
01:01:55,898 --> 01:01:58,051
Get in the back.

1131
01:01:58,151 --> 01:02:00,616
Yeah, try to sit in the back.

1132
01:02:06,734 --> 01:02:08,774
How'd you pull this off?

1133
01:02:09,237 --> 01:02:10,813
I took out a loan.

1134
01:02:10,913 --> 01:02:14,058
They know we're gonna be good for it.

1135
01:02:17,745 --> 01:02:19,745
Check out your ride.

1136
01:02:25,128 --> 01:02:26,996
Man, this shit clean, dawg.

1137
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:29,082
Wait, you got a DVD playing here.

1138
01:02:29,182 --> 01:02:31,000
LeBron, yo, let's ride.
Let's get out of here.

1139
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,168
Wait, hold up, hold up, hold up.

1140
01:02:32,268 --> 01:02:34,268
What about my car?

1141
01:02:35,388 --> 01:02:38,041
Bro, no, no, ain't nobody
gonna steal that shit, bro.

1142
01:02:38,141 --> 01:02:39,884
Yeah, laugh now, laugh now.

1143
01:02:39,984 --> 01:02:43,304
Just don't forget, when y'all
needed a ride somewhere.

1144
01:02:43,404 --> 01:02:45,139
Who was there for y'all?
Uncle Willie.

1145
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:47,239
Uncle Willie.

1146
01:02:53,781 --> 01:02:55,024
LeBron.

1147
01:02:55,124 --> 01:02:57,124
He's here. LeBron.

1148
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:02,498
Okay, kids, squeeze in.

1149
01:03:11,049 --> 01:03:12,584
LeBron.
- Hey.

1150
01:03:12,684 --> 01:03:14,586
You a fan of Wes Unseld?

1151
01:03:14,686 --> 01:03:16,921
Washington Bullets?
You kiddin' me. Of course.

1152
01:03:17,021 --> 01:03:18,298
This is for you.

1153
01:03:18,398 --> 01:03:20,174
This real?
- Of course it's real.

1154
01:03:20,274 --> 01:03:21,884
It's vintage, from 1976.

1155
01:03:21,984 --> 01:03:23,136
Now it's yours.
- Dang.

1156
01:03:23,236 --> 01:03:24,512
Man, thank you. Appreciate that.

1157
01:03:24,612 --> 01:03:26,431
Yeah, you... hey,
you mind taking a picture?

1158
01:03:26,531 --> 01:03:28,141
Uh, sure.
- All right, great.

1159
01:03:28,241 --> 01:03:31,561
Hey, would you take our picture?

1160
01:03:31,661 --> 01:03:33,479
Please? Come on.

1161
01:03:33,579 --> 01:03:36,065
Oh, thank you so much.
- Yeah.

1162
01:03:36,165 --> 01:03:38,165
All right.

1163
01:03:41,704 --> 01:03:43,489
Thank you very much.

1164
01:03:43,589 --> 01:03:47,839
All right, thank you.
- Hey, man, nice to meet you.

1165
01:03:48,878 --> 01:03:51,589
Hi. What'd you get?

1166
01:03:53,383 --> 01:03:54,792
Cookies and cream.

1167
01:03:54,892 --> 01:03:56,461
Yeah, and it's half melted.

1168
01:03:56,561 --> 01:03:58,922
Still good,
it's just ice cream soup.

1169
01:03:59,022 --> 01:04:01,572
Are you done being famous now?

1170
01:04:02,433 --> 01:04:05,408
Done with your little attitude now?

1171
01:04:05,687 --> 01:04:07,687
Maybe.

1172
01:04:07,759 --> 01:04:09,857
Your food's in the car.

1173
01:04:11,067 --> 01:04:14,304
I think it would be
a really smart choice, you know.

1174
01:04:14,404 --> 01:04:17,379
I'm sorry,
you said something, babe.

1175
01:04:18,533 --> 01:04:21,694
What I was trying to say is that
the class is only 200 bucks...

1176
01:04:21,794 --> 01:04:23,279
...and it's supposed to be really good...

1177
01:04:23,379 --> 01:04:25,281
...and you should check it out.

1178
01:04:25,381 --> 01:04:26,574
Okay.

1179
01:04:26,674 --> 01:04:29,794
What do I need to take an SAT for?

1180
01:04:31,004 --> 01:04:32,330
What if you blow your knee out or...?

1181
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:34,791
Hey, don't put that on me.

1182
01:04:34,891 --> 01:04:36,000
Don't do that.

1183
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,544
I'm just saying.
- I'm just sayin'.

1184
01:04:38,644 --> 01:04:41,214
I'm going to be making millions
right out the gate.

1185
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:43,216
I definitely don't need college.

1186
01:04:43,316 --> 01:04:45,316
You don't either.

1187
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:48,179
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

1188
01:04:48,279 --> 01:04:50,574
It means you hit the lotto.

1189
01:04:51,316 --> 01:04:53,860
Oh, I did, did I?

1190
01:04:54,902 --> 01:04:56,521
Oh, wait, I just...

1191
01:04:56,621 --> 01:04:58,815
Hey, everybody,
I just hit the lottery.

1192
01:04:58,915 --> 01:05:00,191
Savannah, that came out.

1193
01:05:00,291 --> 01:05:02,527
No, no, no, 'cause my boyfriend
is LeBron James.

1194
01:05:02,627 --> 01:05:04,445
I mean,
I had to buy his ice cream...

1195
01:05:04,545 --> 01:05:06,114
'cause he didn't have no cash.

1196
01:05:06,214 --> 01:05:07,615
But in a couple years?

1197
01:05:07,715 --> 01:05:10,368
Bling, bling, hoe.
Gold diggers, stand up.

1198
01:05:10,468 --> 01:05:11,744
Savannah, I was just sayin'...

1199
01:05:11,844 --> 01:05:13,788
I know exactly what you were saying...

1200
01:05:13,888 --> 01:05:15,790
'cause you've been saying it
for a while now.

1201
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:18,334
I mean, look at you,
you ain't even in the NBA yet,

1202
01:05:18,434 --> 01:05:19,836
but I can't tell.

1203
01:05:19,936 --> 01:05:24,016
What's it going to be like
when you actually are?

1204
01:05:27,727 --> 01:05:29,929
Ain't nothin' about me gonna change.

1205
01:05:30,029 --> 01:05:32,181
I'm still me.

1206
01:05:32,281 --> 01:05:34,281
Are you?

1207
01:05:36,444 --> 01:05:39,355
You're good at basketball.

1208
01:05:39,455 --> 01:05:43,693
LeBron, you're great,
but if you don't check yourself,

1209
01:05:43,793 --> 01:05:45,903
basketball is gonna be all that you have.

1210
01:05:46,003 --> 01:05:47,864
Basketball is gonna be all that you have.

1211
01:05:47,964 --> 01:05:51,449
Basketball is gonna be all that you have.

1212
01:06:00,218 --> 01:06:02,218
Coach!

1213
01:06:02,804 --> 01:06:05,548
All right.
All right, all right, I get it.

1214
01:06:05,648 --> 01:06:06,716
Listen up.

1215
01:06:06,816 --> 01:06:09,177
Now, I know everybody thinks y'all are...

1216
01:06:09,277 --> 01:06:10,929
God's gift to basketball, right?

1217
01:06:11,029 --> 01:06:12,347
But we got to get ready.

1218
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:15,717
I don't need to get ready
'cause I stay ready.

1219
01:06:15,817 --> 01:06:18,353
I hope so,
'cause this ain't last year.

1220
01:06:18,453 --> 01:06:20,355
We ain't playing for no state championship.

1221
01:06:20,455 --> 01:06:22,231
We're playing for number one in the nation.

1222
01:06:22,331 --> 01:06:27,236
So if you thought last year's
schedule was hard, think again.

1223
01:06:27,336 --> 01:06:28,655
We ran through that.

1224
01:06:28,755 --> 01:06:30,239
Well, now a whole country
going to be watching,

1225
01:06:30,339 --> 01:06:32,241
and we got Oak Hill
next month, remember?

1226
01:06:32,341 --> 01:06:35,745
The consensus number one team.

1227
01:06:35,845 --> 01:06:38,905
Basically,
it's a bunch of all-stars.

1228
01:06:40,883 --> 01:06:45,680
I suggest you do not let this
go to your heads.

1229
01:07:08,244 --> 01:07:12,919
Came to tell you, you know,
welcome to the family, dawg.

1230
01:07:15,752 --> 01:07:19,152
Fab Four is now officially the Fab Five.

1231
01:08:01,589 --> 01:08:03,458
What does La Quinta even mean?

1232
01:08:03,558 --> 01:08:07,337
It means you failed Spanish, Negro.

1233
01:08:07,437 --> 01:08:09,339
Yeah, we came a long way
from selling duct tape.

1234
01:08:09,439 --> 01:08:11,507
Man, jerseys sure look a lot better, too.

1235
01:08:11,607 --> 01:08:13,760
Y'all sold duct tape for uniforms?

1236
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:15,136
We came from the struggle, dawg.

1237
01:08:15,236 --> 01:08:16,471
Struggle?

1238
01:08:16,571 --> 01:08:19,886
I had to break a kid's jaw to get here.

1239
01:08:22,276 --> 01:08:23,811
Y'all really believe that shit?

1240
01:08:23,911 --> 01:08:25,521
But I told these fools
that was some bullshit.

1241
01:08:25,621 --> 01:08:28,066
Man, it's the crazy eyes you got, you know.

1242
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:30,193
No, but look, though,
if we beat these dudes,

1243
01:08:30,293 --> 01:08:31,736
we're going to be number one.

1244
01:08:31,836 --> 01:08:33,780
Like legit,
the best team in America.

1245
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,532
We already the best team.
- Nah, dawg.

1246
01:08:36,632 --> 01:08:39,452
Like Ric Flair said,
to beat a man...

1247
01:08:39,552 --> 01:08:41,996
You gotta be the man!

1248
01:08:42,096 --> 01:08:44,096
Whoo!

1249
01:08:49,804 --> 01:08:51,047
Oh, shit.

1250
01:08:51,147 --> 01:08:52,715
Oh, what's up?
- Yo...

1251
01:08:52,815 --> 01:08:54,217
I just got invited to a party...

1252
01:08:54,317 --> 01:08:56,552
...and they said half the league
is goin' to be there.

1253
01:08:56,652 --> 01:09:00,056
Hey, y'all got to cover for me.

1254
01:09:00,156 --> 01:09:02,156
I'll be back.

1255
01:09:03,151 --> 01:09:04,969
Bro.

1256
01:09:05,069 --> 01:09:07,069
All right, bro.

1257
01:09:20,835 --> 01:09:22,287
The Fighting Irish are going...

1258
01:09:22,387 --> 01:09:23,454
...to have their hands full here tonight...

1259
01:09:23,554 --> 01:09:24,914
...with Oak Hill Academy.

1260
01:09:25,014 --> 01:09:26,499
They've been called The Hoop factory.

1261
01:09:26,599 --> 01:09:27,917
NBA High, and, of course,

1262
01:09:28,017 --> 01:09:31,462
the number one team
in America by USA Today.

1263
01:09:31,562 --> 01:09:33,089
And, boy, are they loaded.

1264
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:36,175
Boasting a starting lineup
filled with top 100 recruits,

1265
01:09:36,275 --> 01:09:41,630
including the number one recruit
in the nation, Carmelo Anthony.

1266
01:09:56,621 --> 01:09:58,323
What's going on?
Are you all right?

1267
01:09:58,423 --> 01:10:01,993
Yeah, it's just the pizza from last night.

1268
01:10:02,377 --> 01:10:05,496
Yeah, it was pepperoni.

1269
01:10:05,596 --> 01:10:08,996
He was in the bathroom all night, Coach.

1270
01:10:09,467 --> 01:10:12,412
Well, maybe you should sit out this game.

1271
01:10:12,512 --> 01:10:14,255
No, I'm good.

1272
01:10:14,355 --> 01:10:15,632
For real, I'm fine.

1273
01:10:15,732 --> 01:10:17,508
Oak Hills' Carmelo Anthony...

1274
01:10:17,608 --> 01:10:18,843
...and St. V's LeBron James...

1275
01:10:18,943 --> 01:10:20,595
...are both leading their teams in scoring.

1276
01:10:20,695 --> 01:10:21,888
Well, we are going to see...

1277
01:10:21,988 --> 01:10:24,098
...both of these young men in the NBA,

1278
01:10:24,198 --> 01:10:27,435
and one of them is going
to have bragging rights...

1279
01:10:27,535 --> 01:10:29,830
...when this game comes up.

1280
01:10:31,364 --> 01:10:32,941
Yeah, up until this game.

1281
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:36,611
St. V's hasn't really faced any adversity.

1282
01:10:43,084 --> 01:10:45,084
Hey, yo, steal.

1283
01:10:45,181 --> 01:10:47,205
Wow, Willie McGee
really picking up the slack...

1284
01:10:47,305 --> 01:10:50,033
...for the Irish here in the third.

1285
01:10:50,133 --> 01:10:52,001
With all the hype surrounding
LeBron James,

1286
01:10:52,101 --> 01:10:53,461
this is a bit of a disappointing debut...

1287
01:10:53,561 --> 01:10:55,213
...on the big stage for him today.

1288
01:10:55,313 --> 01:10:57,313
Go, go!

1289
01:10:59,726 --> 01:11:01,728
Push, push.

1290
01:11:03,438 --> 01:11:05,098
A great game,

1291
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:07,809
but, tonight,
Oak Hill just wanted it more.

1292
01:11:07,909 --> 01:11:10,186
I agree.
LeBron James and the Irish...

1293
01:11:10,286 --> 01:11:13,022
...looked good at times,
but ultimately came up short.

1294
01:11:13,122 --> 01:11:15,566
Final score Oak Hill 77.

1295
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:18,619
St. Vincent-St. Mary's 66.

1296
01:11:26,294 --> 01:11:29,014
Let me talk to you for a minute.

1297
01:11:43,686 --> 01:11:46,097
I want you to take today,

1298
01:11:46,197 --> 01:11:49,817
how you played and the outcome...

1299
01:11:51,778 --> 01:11:54,072
...and learn from it.

1300
01:11:54,864 --> 01:11:57,650
You are a special player.

1301
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,611
The whole world already knows it.

1302
01:11:59,711 --> 01:12:02,447
You are going to have
to deal with distractions...

1303
01:12:02,547 --> 01:12:04,741
...these other boys are not going
to have to deal with.

1304
01:12:04,841 --> 01:12:06,841
I'm just being real.

1305
01:12:09,379 --> 01:12:14,751
How successful you become
depends entirely...

1306
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:17,231
...on how well you manage...

1307
01:12:18,513 --> 01:12:20,513
...the pressure.

1308
01:12:22,767 --> 01:12:24,344
We're definitely blessed.

1309
01:12:24,444 --> 01:12:26,512
I mean, this is the third year
in a row going back to state.

1310
01:12:26,612 --> 01:12:27,931
And I know with these guys behind me,

1311
01:12:28,031 --> 01:12:29,265
we can make it a three-peat.

1312
01:12:29,365 --> 01:12:32,595
Listen, Dru,
take the ball back up top.

1313
01:12:33,027 --> 01:12:36,522
Uh, well, yeah, you know,
it-it's the chemistry we got.

1314
01:12:36,622 --> 01:12:41,212
I know where LeBron gonna be
before he even gets there.

1315
01:12:45,331 --> 01:12:46,866
No, no, no.

1316
01:12:46,966 --> 01:12:48,785
Run it back.
What you-what you looking at?

1317
01:12:48,885 --> 01:12:50,161
W-Willie flashed out to the wing.

1318
01:12:50,261 --> 01:12:51,454
I thought I could get it to him. -Willie?

1319
01:12:51,554 --> 01:12:54,274
They play ain't for Willie, son.

1320
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:56,668
Well, we've been playin'
basketball together...

1321
01:12:56,768 --> 01:12:58,127
...since we were ten.

1322
01:12:58,227 --> 01:13:00,388
It's like, natural.

1323
01:13:01,139 --> 01:13:02,632
Uh, coming from where I'm from.

1324
01:13:02,732 --> 01:13:05,301
I-it's crazy to see how
tight-knit everyone was.

1325
01:13:05,401 --> 01:13:07,637
And then they just kind of folded me in,

1326
01:13:07,737 --> 01:13:09,138
made me a part of the family,

1327
01:13:09,238 --> 01:13:12,893
'cause that's what this feels like, family.

1328
01:13:13,067 --> 01:13:14,519
Coach, Rome wasn't cuttin' fast enough.

1329
01:13:14,619 --> 01:13:16,020
Yo, I was right there.
You just wanted to shoot that...

1330
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,855
I don't want to hear that.

1331
01:13:17,955 --> 01:13:19,857
Even when we're not on the
court, we're always together.

1332
01:13:19,957 --> 01:13:22,652
That's how it's always been.

1333
01:13:22,752 --> 01:13:25,488
LeBron's this big star now,
but to us,

1334
01:13:25,588 --> 01:13:26,948
it feels like nothing's changed.

1335
01:13:27,048 --> 01:13:28,700
You acting like you don't understand...

1336
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,243
...simple concepts!

1337
01:13:30,343 --> 01:13:32,036
Hello!

1338
01:13:32,136 --> 01:13:34,330
When the down screen come from LeBron,

1339
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:36,457
give him the ball.

1340
01:13:36,557 --> 01:13:38,835
Great. Okay,
I think that's good.

1341
01:13:38,935 --> 01:13:40,044
Thank you so much, guys.

1342
01:13:40,144 --> 01:13:42,144
Thanks.
- Thank you.

1343
01:13:47,894 --> 01:13:49,053
Uh, you see that there?

1344
01:13:49,153 --> 01:13:50,638
That is pure joy there.

1345
01:13:50,738 --> 01:13:52,974
They're just taking every opportunity here...

1346
01:13:53,074 --> 01:13:54,976
...and spinning it into pure gold.

1347
01:13:55,076 --> 01:13:57,645
And they're a good team,
but this is unexpected.

1348
01:13:57,745 --> 01:14:00,064
The fans are going nuts.

1349
01:14:00,164 --> 01:14:01,899
Well, with the ten point lead...

1350
01:14:01,999 --> 01:14:05,059
...and growing, it's like,
no wonder.

1351
01:14:05,787 --> 01:14:08,031
You suck! You suck! You suck!

1352
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:11,534
You suck! You suck!
You suck!

1353
01:14:11,634 --> 01:14:12,869
Watch out, watch out,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1354
01:14:12,969 --> 01:14:14,829
Ball.

1355
01:14:14,929 --> 01:14:16,969
That ain't no foul, ref?

1356
01:14:17,021 --> 01:14:18,625
Ain't no foul, no foul,
keep playing.

1357
01:14:18,725 --> 01:14:21,494
No foul, keep playing,
keep playing.

1358
01:14:21,594 --> 01:14:23,087
Pass the ball.

1359
01:14:23,187 --> 01:14:26,417
You ain't gotta do it all by yourself.

1360
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:30,762
Roger Bacon...!

1361
01:14:30,862 --> 01:14:32,862
Let's go!

1362
01:14:32,934 --> 01:14:34,934
Move the ball!

1363
01:14:36,442 --> 01:14:38,853
Roger Bacon, that's right!

1364
01:14:38,953 --> 01:14:40,063
That's terrible court spacing.

1365
01:14:40,163 --> 01:14:42,231
Ball, pass the ball.

1366
01:14:42,331 --> 01:14:44,067
You ain't gotta do it all by yourself.

1367
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:45,485
Yo, time.

1368
01:14:45,585 --> 01:14:47,070
No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

1369
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:48,404
Get open. You're no help.

1370
01:14:48,504 --> 01:14:50,156
I've been open this whole time.
- Get open.

1371
01:14:50,256 --> 01:14:51,574
Hey, I don't want to hear none of that.

1372
01:14:51,674 --> 01:14:53,674
Get over here.

1373
01:14:53,742 --> 01:14:56,579
Bro, we about to blow it
against Roger got-damn Bacon.

1374
01:14:56,679 --> 01:14:59,582
How we gettin' beat by a team
named after a breakfast meat?

1375
01:14:59,682 --> 01:15:01,834
Cut the talk, pay attention.

1376
01:15:01,934 --> 01:15:04,399
We could still win this game.

1377
01:15:05,763 --> 01:15:06,923
All in on three.

1378
01:15:07,023 --> 01:15:08,925
One, two, three.
- All in.

1379
01:15:09,025 --> 01:15:10,802
Pass the ball.

1380
01:15:10,902 --> 01:15:13,187
Man, play some defense.

1381
01:15:20,069 --> 01:15:21,854
What the hell, bruh!

1382
01:15:21,954 --> 01:15:24,023
Focus on your game, Dru!

1383
01:15:24,123 --> 01:15:26,442
Sorry, can't all be 23.

1384
01:15:26,542 --> 01:15:28,542
Watch your mouth.

1385
01:15:34,959 --> 01:15:36,160
You supposed to switch that.

1386
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,870
I'm only helping.
You need to get back.

1387
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:38,955
Shut the fuck up, Chosen One.

1388
01:15:39,055 --> 01:15:40,206
What'd you say to me?

1389
01:15:40,306 --> 01:15:41,416
You got ears.
Get out of my face, bro.

1390
01:15:41,516 --> 01:15:42,834
Don't be mad at me...

1391
01:15:42,934 --> 01:15:45,787
'cause you ain't tall enough to make it pro.

1392
01:15:45,887 --> 01:15:48,131
Huh?
- You stop pushing me.

1393
01:15:48,231 --> 01:15:49,924
Hey, hey, guys, cut it out,
cut it out, cut it out.

1394
01:15:50,024 --> 01:15:53,169
You gonna mess around and get a tech.

1395
01:15:56,606 --> 01:15:58,474
12 green.

1396
01:15:58,574 --> 01:16:00,810
Come on, man, think.

1397
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:01,936
You're costing us the game, Dru.

1398
01:16:02,036 --> 01:16:03,146
Get off of me, bro.

1399
01:16:03,246 --> 01:16:04,647
Dru!

1400
01:16:04,747 --> 01:16:06,441
Get over here!

1401
01:16:06,541 --> 01:16:07,859
Hey, LeBron.

1402
01:16:07,959 --> 01:16:09,959
Damn, get over here.

1403
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:18,077
Are we really gonna lose this game?

1404
01:16:18,177 --> 01:16:21,577
Think we might have lost more than that.

1405
01:17:19,188 --> 01:17:22,150
Man, this shit ain't fun no more.

1406
01:17:49,594 --> 01:17:50,954
Yo.

1407
01:17:51,054 --> 01:17:53,881
After midnight again, man.

1408
01:17:53,981 --> 01:17:55,981
A couple more.

1409
01:18:00,647 --> 01:18:02,682
All right, what's going on, man?

1410
01:18:02,782 --> 01:18:05,068
What's up?

1411
01:18:10,531 --> 01:18:12,575
When we was kids...

1412
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:20,480
...I had size and skills over everybody.

1413
01:18:24,962 --> 01:18:27,957
But it's like...

1414
01:18:28,057 --> 01:18:32,136
...they got better and I just stayed the same.

1415
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:42,230
What happens if nobody wants me?

1416
01:18:42,855 --> 01:18:45,233
Get up, man.

1417
01:18:48,069 --> 01:18:49,520
Let me ask you something,
why you think the boys...

1418
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:53,955
...been calling you Uncle Willie
since y'all was 11?

1419
01:18:54,617 --> 01:18:57,228
What's that got to do with anything?

1420
01:18:57,328 --> 01:18:59,656
You a leader, Willie.

1421
01:18:59,756 --> 01:19:01,991
Just 'cause you ain't leading
down the path you thought,

1422
01:19:02,091 --> 01:19:05,151
does not mean you ain't on your way.

1423
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:11,215
You hear what I'm saying?

1424
01:19:16,431 --> 01:19:21,191
You're a whole lot more than
just basketball, little bro.

1425
01:19:31,946 --> 01:19:33,564
What you doing here?

1426
01:19:33,664 --> 01:19:35,783
Nice to see you, too.

1427
01:19:38,703 --> 01:19:40,113
You should be proud.

1428
01:19:40,213 --> 01:19:42,508
You guys had a good season.

1429
01:19:42,915 --> 01:19:43,992
You boys are looking good.

1430
01:19:44,092 --> 01:19:46,092
When are we not?

1431
01:19:47,003 --> 01:19:49,043
Roger Bacon ring a bell?

1432
01:19:49,505 --> 01:19:50,915
You come here to break my balls?

1433
01:19:51,015 --> 01:19:53,015
Only partly.

1434
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:56,058
My point guard graduates this year.

1435
01:19:58,806 --> 01:20:00,967
You want me to come play for you?

1436
01:20:01,067 --> 01:20:02,385
You're a good player, Dru.

1437
01:20:02,485 --> 01:20:04,887
I enjoyed coaching you.

1438
01:20:04,987 --> 01:20:09,152
So much you dipped out on us
first chance you got.

1439
01:20:16,491 --> 01:20:18,276
I wanted back in college ball.

1440
01:20:18,376 --> 01:20:20,756
I saw my shot and I took it.

1441
01:20:20,847 --> 01:20:23,567
Not going to apologize for that.

1442
01:20:27,835 --> 01:20:31,789
It doesn't mean I'm blind
to what you boys did for me.

1443
01:20:31,889 --> 01:20:33,041
Or that I forgot what I was doing...

1444
01:20:33,141 --> 01:20:36,286
...in this school in the first place.

1445
01:20:36,344 --> 01:20:38,171
It's not like I left you high and dry.

1446
01:20:38,271 --> 01:20:40,821
I knew you'd be in good hands.

1447
01:20:41,182 --> 01:20:44,127
I wanted to make great players out of you.

1448
01:20:44,227 --> 01:20:46,227
And I did.

1449
01:20:47,397 --> 01:20:50,358
Your dad wants to make great men.

1450
01:20:51,192 --> 01:20:53,742
That'll last you a lot longer.

1451
01:20:54,112 --> 01:20:56,239
Don't forget that.

1452
01:20:59,367 --> 01:21:01,367
Give me a call.

1453
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:23,132
So we just ain't gonna talk to each other...

1454
01:21:23,232 --> 01:21:25,310
...for the whole season?

1455
01:21:31,065 --> 01:21:33,776
I got somethin' to say.

1456
01:21:43,619 --> 01:21:47,991
Look, I came here to play ball,

1457
01:21:48,091 --> 01:21:49,534
to put in work.

1458
01:21:49,634 --> 01:21:53,588
So while I'm here,
that's what I plan to do.

1459
01:21:56,424 --> 01:22:00,762
Before practice, after practice,
it's whatever.

1460
01:22:01,971 --> 01:22:06,476
But when we get on that court,
it's strictly business.

1461
01:22:07,769 --> 01:22:09,769
You feel me?

1462
01:22:11,731 --> 01:22:13,731
Yeah.

1463
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,900
All right.

1464
01:22:16,486 --> 01:22:19,801
Well, we got Oak Hill next month, so...

1465
01:22:23,451 --> 01:22:25,953
So we do what we gotta do.

1466
01:22:40,927 --> 01:22:42,754
A high school game here in Cleveland...

1467
01:22:42,854 --> 01:22:45,590
...has attracted a crowd
of 10,000 here tonight.

1468
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:47,759
But it's not just any high school game.

1469
01:22:47,859 --> 01:22:49,469
It's phenom LeBron James...

1470
01:22:49,569 --> 01:22:52,347
...against the number one ranked
team in the country, Oak Hill.

1471
01:22:52,447 --> 01:22:55,642
LeBron mania goes national here tonight.

1472
01:22:55,742 --> 01:22:57,602
He's one of those teenage phenoms...

1473
01:22:57,702 --> 01:22:59,562
...that come along in their given sport...

1474
01:22:59,662 --> 01:23:01,522
...and are so gifted and all I know is...

1475
01:23:01,622 --> 01:23:04,817
...if he's half as good
as all I've heard about him,

1476
01:23:04,917 --> 01:23:08,147
he is going to be one special athlete.

1477
01:24:36,376 --> 01:24:38,376
Good game, man.

1478
01:24:42,423 --> 01:24:44,375
LeBron, can we have a word with you?

1479
01:24:44,475 --> 01:24:46,002
Oh, no, yeah, of course.

1480
01:24:46,102 --> 01:24:47,503
Love you.

1481
01:24:47,603 --> 01:24:49,172
You've been on the cover
of Sports Illustrated.

1482
01:24:49,272 --> 01:24:51,007
ESPN and USA Today.

1483
01:24:51,107 --> 01:24:52,508
That must be a bit surreal.

1484
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,344
What do you think?
Is it too much pressure for you?

1485
01:24:54,444 --> 01:24:55,929
No, no, it's never no pressure.

1486
01:24:56,029 --> 01:24:57,430
No, I just come in there,
play my game,

1487
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:59,390
and get my teammates involved.

1488
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:01,017
You know,
when I'm with my boys, man.

1489
01:25:01,117 --> 01:25:03,853
I'm always focused like no other. For real.

1490
01:25:03,953 --> 01:25:06,648
And tonight, we played the
number one team in the country.

1491
01:25:06,748 --> 01:25:10,193
We gave it our all, 110%,
like we do every other night.

1492
01:25:10,293 --> 01:25:11,444
We all do it together.

1493
01:25:11,544 --> 01:25:12,570
Well, congrats.

1494
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:15,581
Enjoy the win.
- Thank you.

1495
01:25:36,686 --> 01:25:38,896
What happen, somebody die?

1496
01:25:42,317 --> 01:25:44,102
A bribe? That's bullshit.

1497
01:25:44,202 --> 01:25:45,561
It's what they're claiming.

1498
01:25:45,661 --> 01:25:47,480
It was a jersey
a random dude just gave me.

1499
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,816
a vintage jersey worth $1,800.

1500
01:25:49,916 --> 01:25:51,734
How the hell is he supposed to know that?

1501
01:25:51,834 --> 01:25:53,444
Regardless, it was over
the permissible limits...

1502
01:25:53,544 --> 01:25:55,947
...set by OHSAA.
- It was from a fan.

1503
01:25:56,047 --> 01:25:58,074
Not a coach,
not a booster. A fan.

1504
01:25:58,174 --> 01:26:01,995
Besides, all the players get sponsored gear.

1505
01:26:02,095 --> 01:26:05,415
If the donor isn't a family
member, it's considered a bribe.

1506
01:26:05,515 --> 01:26:07,667
But it was just some random dude.

1507
01:26:07,767 --> 01:26:09,127
This is witch hunt, Dave.

1508
01:26:09,227 --> 01:26:12,463
There's been some very generous
alumni endowments...

1509
01:26:12,563 --> 01:26:14,924
...since these boys
stepped foot on this campus.

1510
01:26:15,024 --> 01:26:16,926
Don't you think we owe him our support?

1511
01:26:17,026 --> 01:26:19,929
The only thing that St. V
owes anyone is a good education,

1512
01:26:20,029 --> 01:26:21,681
and-and the look of a high school player...

1513
01:26:21,781 --> 01:26:23,725
...driving a Hummer doesn't help.

1514
01:26:23,825 --> 01:26:26,644
Please, no disrespect.

1515
01:26:26,744 --> 01:26:29,439
And, yes, I know what this is.

1516
01:26:29,539 --> 01:26:32,283
Look, it's not my call.

1517
01:26:33,242 --> 01:26:36,321
LeBron, you're suspended
for the rest of the season,

1518
01:26:36,421 --> 01:26:37,780
pending appeal.

1519
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,782
Are you serious?
- No, you know this isn't right.

1520
01:26:39,882 --> 01:26:40,992
Mom.
- You can go to the games,

1521
01:26:41,092 --> 01:26:42,285
but you're not allowed to suit up...

1522
01:26:42,385 --> 01:26:43,661
...or interact with the players?

1523
01:26:43,761 --> 01:26:46,039
For all intents and purposes,

1524
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:49,369
you're not a part of the team anymore.

1525
01:26:55,098 --> 01:26:57,141
He's just a kid.

1526
01:26:59,143 --> 01:27:02,263
Just... Let's go.

1527
01:27:02,363 --> 01:27:04,363
Come on, let's go.

1528
01:27:06,859 --> 01:27:10,021
A controversial Ohio High School
Athletic Association...

1529
01:27:10,121 --> 01:27:14,651
...ruling today involving
basketball phenom LeBron James.

1530
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:18,821
This ruling means not only
is LeBron James ineligible...

1531
01:27:18,921 --> 01:27:20,406
...for the remainder of the season,

1532
01:27:20,506 --> 01:27:22,992
it means the Fighting Irish must forfeit...

1533
01:27:23,092 --> 01:27:27,088
...the big win last week over rival Buchtel.

1534
01:27:27,755 --> 01:27:30,583
Here's the OHSAA commissioner,
Clair Muscaro.

1535
01:27:30,683 --> 01:27:35,964
The OHSAA is not persecuting
one student athlete.

1536
01:27:36,064 --> 01:27:40,843
Rather, we are protecting every
student athlete on every team.

1537
01:27:40,943 --> 01:27:42,943
Bullshit.

1538
01:27:49,277 --> 01:27:50,687
Yo, Bron.

1539
01:27:50,787 --> 01:27:52,772
It's Unc checking up on you.

1540
01:27:52,872 --> 01:27:55,252
Illya told me to save it up.

1541
01:27:55,992 --> 01:28:01,007
I'm just letting you know, man,
we got your back, all right?

1542
01:28:01,331 --> 01:28:03,783
Yo, big dawg.

1543
01:28:03,883 --> 01:28:05,368
Just calling to check on you.

1544
01:28:05,468 --> 01:28:09,289
Um, you know, you know,
we gonna get through this.

1545
01:28:09,389 --> 01:28:11,389
Don't stress it.

1546
01:28:13,176 --> 01:28:14,586
Hey, yo, Bron,
I heard what happened, man.

1547
01:28:14,686 --> 01:28:16,045
That's some bullshit.

1548
01:28:16,145 --> 01:28:18,590
Forget Clair,
or whatever his name is.

1549
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:21,059
Just hit me back, bro.

1550
01:28:56,844 --> 01:28:58,922
Listen up, listen up.

1551
01:28:59,022 --> 01:29:01,299
Y'all know who ain't here, right?

1552
01:29:01,399 --> 01:29:03,259
But we here. We here.

1553
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:06,095
It don't matter that
everybody written us off...

1554
01:29:06,195 --> 01:29:08,222
...because we know what we capable of.

1555
01:29:08,322 --> 01:29:10,099
So, let's go out there
and show these fools...

1556
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:11,893
...that we're more than just one player.

1557
01:29:11,993 --> 01:29:13,436
A'ight? A'ight?

1558
01:29:13,536 --> 01:29:14,812
More than just one player.

1559
01:29:14,912 --> 01:29:16,773
A'ight, all in on three.

1560
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:19,108
One, two, three.
- All in!

1561
01:29:19,208 --> 01:29:22,195
Tonight St. V's goes
against Canton McKinley.

1562
01:29:22,295 --> 01:29:23,529
Both teams need this game...

1563
01:29:23,629 --> 01:29:27,114
...to continue to the state championship.

1564
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:29,535
Yeah, and the whole
state of Ohio is aware tonight

1565
01:29:29,635 --> 01:29:33,706
LeBron James will not be on the court.

1566
01:29:33,806 --> 01:29:35,208
You know,
this is when the phrase,

1567
01:29:35,308 --> 01:29:38,283
'Next man up' becomes all too real.

1568
01:29:43,224 --> 01:29:44,968
And tonight, we'll see...

1569
01:29:45,068 --> 01:29:47,804
...how this St. Vincent team fares
without their centerpiece.

1570
01:29:47,904 --> 01:29:49,904
Let's go, green!

1571
01:29:56,195 --> 01:29:58,195
To Romeo!

1572
01:30:03,828 --> 01:30:05,953
There we go, there we go.

1573
01:30:20,928 --> 01:30:23,138
Come on, come on, come on.

1574
01:30:29,437 --> 01:30:31,437
Yeah!

1575
01:30:33,316 --> 01:30:35,316
Oh, yeah, Willie.

1576
01:30:43,451 --> 01:30:44,444
Time out.
- Time, time.

1577
01:30:44,544 --> 01:30:46,029
Ref!

1578
01:30:46,129 --> 01:30:50,033
Ooh, ooh, here we go, Bulldogs,
here we go, ooh, ooh!

1579
01:30:50,133 --> 01:30:53,369
Here we go, Bulldogs,
here we go, ooh, ooh!

1580
01:30:53,469 --> 01:30:56,080
Here we go, Irish, here we go!

1581
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:59,292
Here we go, Irish,
here we go!

1582
01:30:59,392 --> 01:31:03,179
Here we go, Bulldogs,
here we go, ooh, ooh!

1583
01:31:33,251 --> 01:31:34,452
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
come on, LeBron.

1584
01:31:34,552 --> 01:31:36,204
You know you can't.
- Come on, Coach Coop.

1585
01:31:36,304 --> 01:31:39,279
You'll get us in trouble,
all right?

1586
01:31:40,174 --> 01:31:43,234
I'm sorry, brother.
Come on, chin up.

1587
01:32:04,741 --> 01:32:06,192
You ain't going to say hi?

1588
01:32:06,292 --> 01:32:08,292
Hey, Ma.

1589
01:32:23,384 --> 01:32:25,384
How was the game?

1590
01:32:30,767 --> 01:32:32,844
What you watching?

1591
01:32:32,944 --> 01:32:35,146
I taped my stories.

1592
01:32:37,523 --> 01:32:39,523
They won.

1593
01:32:39,599 --> 01:32:41,599
They goin' to state.

1594
01:32:42,362 --> 01:32:44,362
'They'?

1595
01:32:45,073 --> 01:32:47,453
I ain't on the team no more.

1596
01:32:49,285 --> 01:32:51,285
Hmm.

1597
01:32:55,458 --> 01:32:57,243
Did you have friends in high school?

1598
01:32:57,343 --> 01:33:01,664
I had friends just like everybody else.

1599
01:33:01,764 --> 01:33:05,385
Nah, I mean like friends.

1600
01:33:09,472 --> 01:33:13,184
Yeah, I had a few.

1601
01:33:13,935 --> 01:33:16,485
You still talk to any of them?

1602
01:33:17,605 --> 01:33:19,605
Nah.

1603
01:33:19,983 --> 01:33:22,235
Not really.

1604
01:33:28,074 --> 01:33:31,474
That's just how life is sometimes, baby.

1605
01:33:33,162 --> 01:33:36,324
You go to school,
you got your crew...

1606
01:33:36,424 --> 01:33:41,609
...and you can't imagine what life
would be like without them.

1607
01:33:42,046 --> 01:33:46,175
Then you graduate or you move or...

1608
01:33:47,468 --> 01:33:52,473
The real world hits you,
gets in the way.

1609
01:33:55,643 --> 01:33:58,363
And you just kind of grow apart.

1610
01:33:59,731 --> 01:34:01,731
It happens.

1611
01:34:03,818 --> 01:34:07,048
It's really not what I wanted to hear.

1612
01:34:09,657 --> 01:34:11,657
I know.

1613
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:15,380
But that don't change how it is.

1614
01:34:19,167 --> 01:34:24,497
What's important is that
when you look back...

1615
01:34:24,597 --> 01:34:28,592
...did you make the time
you had together count?

1616
01:34:30,595 --> 01:34:33,570
Did you give it everything you got?

1617
01:34:40,855 --> 01:34:42,140
Mr. James.

1618
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,350
I'm sure you're aware that the association...

1619
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:49,022
...has no bearing on your
eligibility for the NBA draft.

1620
01:34:49,122 --> 01:34:51,122
Yes, sir.

1621
01:34:52,575 --> 01:34:55,278
I have to be honest with you then.

1622
01:34:55,378 --> 01:34:59,288
I'm a little puzzled why we're all here today.

1623
01:34:59,499 --> 01:35:01,784
You're on the very brink
of wealth and fame...

1624
01:35:01,884 --> 01:35:06,164
...and by your own admission, you
don't plan to attend college.

1625
01:35:06,264 --> 01:35:10,877
I can't see how missing
one high school basketball game...

1626
01:35:10,977 --> 01:35:13,129
...will affect your future in any way.

1627
01:35:13,229 --> 01:35:15,229
It won't, sir.

1628
01:35:15,765 --> 01:35:17,967
You understand that presenting
yourself here today...

1629
01:35:18,067 --> 01:35:20,470
...puts us under no obligation
to reinstate you.

1630
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:21,804
Yes, ma'am.

1631
01:35:21,904 --> 01:35:24,641
It's just...

1632
01:35:24,741 --> 01:35:28,736
...right now I'm not
thinking about the future.

1633
01:35:29,445 --> 01:35:32,080
I'm thinking about my brothers.

1634
01:35:32,573 --> 01:35:35,693
And they made it all the way
to state without me.

1635
01:35:35,793 --> 01:35:37,904
So this is just a vanity play...

1636
01:35:38,004 --> 01:35:41,574
...so you can be in
the championship game?

1637
01:35:41,749 --> 01:35:43,576
No, ma'am.

1638
01:35:43,676 --> 01:35:46,736
It wouldn't matter what game it was.

1639
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:52,719
I moved ten times before I was 12.

1640
01:35:55,763 --> 01:35:57,849
All I had is my mom.

1641
01:36:00,018 --> 01:36:03,503
She's the only thing consistent,
you know?

1642
01:36:05,565 --> 01:36:07,565
And...

1643
01:36:07,734 --> 01:36:09,310
...this crazy coach...

1644
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:12,272
...who kept quoting
John Wooden found me.

1645
01:36:12,372 --> 01:36:16,017
One of the only men in my life
that I could look up to.

1646
01:36:16,117 --> 01:36:18,361
He put me on the Shooting Stars...

1647
01:36:18,461 --> 01:36:21,521
...where I met Dru, Sian and Willie.

1648
01:36:22,373 --> 01:36:26,198
And, man, we'd hoop all day
except for school.

1649
01:36:28,629 --> 01:36:31,541
Uh... spend nights playing video games...

1650
01:36:31,641 --> 01:36:35,381
...and doing it all over again the next day.

1651
01:36:37,347 --> 01:36:41,968
It wasn't nothing special
really about it, but...

1652
01:36:42,068 --> 01:36:44,854
...it was special to me.

1653
01:36:45,938 --> 01:36:51,644
Then we went to St. V's
and met Coach Dambrot.

1654
01:36:51,744 --> 01:36:53,062
And, man, he was tough,

1655
01:36:53,162 --> 01:36:57,157
but he helped me become
the player who I am now.

1656
01:36:58,618 --> 01:37:02,071
People keep telling me that
my life's about to change...

1657
01:37:02,171 --> 01:37:04,171
...and...

1658
01:37:05,625 --> 01:37:07,625
...they probably right.

1659
01:37:09,253 --> 01:37:11,506
In a year..,.

1660
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:15,480
...I might not be the same person.

1661
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:21,424
So if I have to pay a fine,
change my jersey number,

1662
01:37:21,524 --> 01:37:25,637
do community service,
I'll do it.

1663
01:37:25,737 --> 01:37:27,777
Just tell me what to do.

1664
01:37:30,358 --> 01:37:33,144
But please...

1665
01:37:33,244 --> 01:37:37,409
...let me play with my best friends
one last time.

1666
01:38:09,022 --> 01:38:11,307
What's up, bruh?

1667
01:38:11,407 --> 01:38:13,518
Yo, what's up?

1668
01:38:13,618 --> 01:38:17,358
Hey, Bron. -It's good to have you back, bro.

1669
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:31,983
I heard you cried in front of the board.

1670
01:38:32,462 --> 01:38:34,462
Like a 220-pound baby.

1671
01:38:37,925 --> 01:38:39,925
Bro.
- My boy.

1672
01:38:40,094 --> 01:38:44,082
What's good, bro?
- What's up, B? -What's up, man?

1673
01:38:44,182 --> 01:38:45,675
Look who came crawlin' back.

1674
01:38:45,775 --> 01:38:47,760
It's just sad when you see shit like that.

1675
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:48,970
Ain't it sad, Rome?

1676
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:50,513
It's definitely sad.

1677
01:38:50,613 --> 01:38:52,682
Shut up, y'all.

1678
01:38:52,782 --> 01:38:55,077
Ready to hoop?
- Hell, yeah.

1679
01:38:58,946 --> 01:39:01,024
Well, Bob,
it's been an absolute pleasure...

1680
01:39:01,124 --> 01:39:02,650
...covering four years of basketball...

1681
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:05,069
...with the St. Vincent- St. Mary's team...

1682
01:39:05,169 --> 01:39:09,929
...and of course, the Akron phenom
himself, LeBron James.

1683
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:11,409
I think everyone's hoping...

1684
01:39:11,509 --> 01:39:13,036
...for a storybook ending.

1685
01:39:13,136 --> 01:39:16,039
A low scoring game as we
come to the end of the quarter.

1686
01:39:16,139 --> 01:39:20,304
We now go into halftime
with St. V's down by five.

1687
01:39:24,889 --> 01:39:26,591
Tonight you have the chance to go down...

1688
01:39:26,691 --> 01:39:31,536
...as the greatest high school team
in basketball history.

1689
01:39:31,896 --> 01:39:33,896
But...

1690
01:39:34,482 --> 01:39:37,894
I want you to take a minute.

1691
01:39:37,994 --> 01:39:40,738
Try to grasp this thing.

1692
01:39:41,656 --> 01:39:45,493
This opportunity that we've been given.

1693
01:39:45,994 --> 01:39:48,780
I can tell you...

1694
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,075
...when you look back
at this time in your lives,

1695
01:39:52,175 --> 01:39:56,079
it won't be about stats,

1696
01:39:56,179 --> 01:39:58,581
accolades, the X's and O's.

1697
01:39:58,681 --> 01:40:02,506
It's not about
winning the state championship.

1698
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:05,524
It'll be that person next to you.

1699
01:40:06,222 --> 01:40:08,383
And no matter how you spin it,

1700
01:40:08,483 --> 01:40:12,053
this is my last time coaching some of you.

1701
01:40:12,770 --> 01:40:15,265
More importantly,
this is the last time...

1702
01:40:15,365 --> 01:40:18,935
...that this team will ever play together.

1703
01:40:19,861 --> 01:40:24,536
Ask yourselves, what are
you going to do with that time?

1704
01:40:56,898 --> 01:40:58,898
What's up?

1705
01:40:59,651 --> 01:41:02,637
Coach, I think it's time for me to come out.

1706
01:41:02,737 --> 01:41:05,797
'Cause it's time for Jimmy to go in.

1707
01:41:07,909 --> 01:41:09,027
All right.

1708
01:41:09,127 --> 01:41:10,361
Let's do it.

1709
01:41:10,461 --> 01:41:12,071
In on three.

1710
01:41:12,171 --> 01:41:14,211
One, two, three.
- Do it!

1711
01:41:14,791 --> 01:41:16,791
Get it, boy.

1712
01:42:50,762 --> 01:42:52,972
Jimmy Podeski!

1713
01:43:00,688 --> 01:43:02,599
Why they gotta play this song?

1714
01:43:02,699 --> 01:43:05,101
Are you cryin'
- No shit, I'm cryin'.

1715
01:43:05,201 --> 01:43:08,271
'Cause I got a heart
unlike you cold ass bastards.

1716
01:43:08,371 --> 01:43:11,091
It's all right there, big fella.

1717
01:43:11,366 --> 01:43:12,984
You guys ready?

1718
01:43:13,084 --> 01:43:17,164
Thought you guys were walking
with your families.

1719
01:43:17,872 --> 01:43:19,872
We are.

1720
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:42,790
It's crazy.

1721
01:44:45,835 --> 01:44:47,870
Man, you abandoning us, Coach?

1722
01:44:47,970 --> 01:44:48,913
what y'all doing out here?

1723
01:44:49,013 --> 01:44:50,748
You know the party's in there.

1724
01:44:50,848 --> 01:44:52,959
Nah, last time we checked,
the party was in here.

1725
01:44:53,059 --> 01:44:55,503
Yeah, but you can't play
none of that whack ass music.

1726
01:44:55,603 --> 01:44:57,413
Whack ass music?

1727
01:44:57,513 --> 01:45:00,488
How have I failed you all so badly?

1728
01:45:02,977 --> 01:45:05,138
What do you know about this, Coach?

1729
01:45:05,238 --> 01:45:06,848
Y'all have to get in the back.

1730
01:45:06,948 --> 01:45:08,975
Yes. Y'all don't know nothing
about no music.

1731
01:45:09,075 --> 01:45:11,144
Hey, Willie,
what you doing, man?

1732
01:45:11,244 --> 01:45:12,645
Oh, my goodness.
- I got this, I got this.

1733
01:45:12,745 --> 01:45:14,230
Y'all stink.
- Coach, I got it.

1734
01:45:14,330 --> 01:45:15,398
No!

1735
01:45:15,498 --> 01:45:17,233
No, you ain't...

1736
01:45:17,333 --> 01:45:19,333
What y'all doin', baby?
