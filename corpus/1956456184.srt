Don't start any sentence with:
"As a female..."

78

I'm in a single-income
household,

91
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:59,513

our second baby, Taylor.

(CHUCKLING):
Yeah. Thanks.

95
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:06,436
So there's just
a lot of expenses

96
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:09,606
at home right now, and...
I think it's time for a raise.

97
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:11,942
I see.

98
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:14,695
This is actually
very exciting to me.

99
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:17,072
- Really? Great.
- Because what you're describing

100
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:20,575
is the most clear-cut example
of the classic sexist argument

101
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:22,744
for the advancement of men
in the workplace.

102
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:24,746
You're asking for a raise
not because of

103
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:26,164
any work-related contribution
you've made,

104
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,125
but simply because
you have a family.

105
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:31,044
And that's why, in the 1950s,
family men were promoted

106
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:32,796
over the women
they worked with.

107
00:04:32,798 --> 00:04:34,381
I've never encountered it,
actually,

108
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:36,717
in such a clean, teachable way.

109
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:39,052
I don't think that's at all
what's happening.

110
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:40,595
I can't give you a raise, Gabe.

111
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:42,848
- It's like giving a raise to a drug addict.
- What?

112
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,558
Well, your situations
are virtually identical.

113
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,268
A drug addict makes
certain decisions

114
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,270
outside of work
for their sense of self

115
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:50,230
and comfort,
and then the addiction

116
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:52,983
demands more time, more energy,
more money, just like a child.

117
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:55,360
- My child's like a drug problem?
- Exactly.

118
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,154
You want special treatment.
I'm sure you can see

119
00:04:57,156 --> 00:05:00,240
how unfair that would be
to a single man or-or woman.

There are no women
on this staff.

121

- Gabe.
- And the reason there aren't any women

122
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:04,953
is because you hate women.

123
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:07,122

174

about this job?

176

Your submission came
from Margaret Yang

177
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,752
at Human Resources.

178
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:19,004
At the chemical plant
where I work,

179
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,589
there is a corkboard...

180
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:22,174
you know,
where people hang notices

181
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,426
for bikes, futons,
missing cats...

182
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:26,511
and one day, I saw a notice

183
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,930
for a company-sponsored
essay contest

184
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:32,058
where the prize was you could
meet any executive you want.

185
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,643
- An essay contest?
- Yes.

186
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:35,437
To meet an executive, like...

187
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,022
the head of the chemical plant?

188
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,523
Yes, I think that's what

189
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,317
you could have picked,
traditionally.

190
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,068
- But you didn't?
- No.

191
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,571
I picked Vernon Gleason,
the chief operating officer

192
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:47,157
for all of Mainline Chemical,
which owns my plant,

193

but also owns Comtech,
which owns this network,

194
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:52,204

this interview?

- Yep.
- And you have no experience in comedy?

199
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,380
No.
No, I'm obsessed with comedy.

ask a chemist.

KATHERINE: After all the years,
the decades

344
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,959
I've put into that show,
can you believe it?

345
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:32,794
As a matter of fact, I can.

346
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,796
They're all a bunch of idiots.

347
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:36,881
I mean, this is the cyclical
nature of late-night TV.

348
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,759
There are gonna be highs,
and there are gonna be slumps.

349
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:42,845
This particular slump
has lasted for over a decade.

350
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:45,098
- What?
- The show hasn't been good for years.

351
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,186
Wow. I'm glad your candor's
still intact.

352
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:56,818
Sorry.

353
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,320
But if you felt this way,
why, for God's sake,

354
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:00,655
didn't you say something?

355
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:02,448
I thought you knew
and didn't care.

356
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,866
- No.
- Are you sure?

357
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,451
Walter, I have invested
in precisely

358
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:07,829
two things my entire life:
you and this show.

359
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:09,539
I won't lose it now.
I can't.

Then you have to fight again.

361
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:14,002
Something you haven't had to do
for a long, long time.

362
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:17,380
WALTER:
They want to replace you.

363
00:14:17,382 --> 00:14:19,424
But they can't replace you

364
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,594
if everyone loves you.

I'm a stand-up.

370

I didn't even start my set
till 10:00 last night.

371
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,781
Yeah, why did Brad want us here
so early anyway?

372
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,158
That makes me kind of nervous.

373
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,118
You're nervous?
That's surprising.

374
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,121
Brad's assistant said he saw
Caroline Morton here yesterday.

375
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:53,835
Caroline Morton? Why would the
head of the network come here?

376
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:12,352
Well, hopefully, they don't lay
everybody off, you know?

377
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,437
- I need this job.
- They did fire Gabe.

378
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:16,981
- Hey, babe.
- Gabe should have been fired years ago.

379
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,317
He once went home early
because he had a "bad bagel."

380
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,860
Hey, dickhead,
I shared an office

381
00:15:20,862 --> 00:15:22,654
with that guy for 17 years.

382
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:25,198
- Oh, I heard he got hired at Kimmel.
- Fuck him.

383
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,991
I thought you said Kimmel
wasn't hiring.

384
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,077
Guys, there's a lot of reasons
Caroline could be here.

385
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:30,953
Maybe she wants
to sleep with me.

386
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:33,414
Hey, man, it's a little early
in the morning for you to be

510
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,639
- Oh, wow.
- How's your girlfriend?

511
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:01,933
Good. Really good. Yeah,
she just got this new job,

512
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,392
so she's a little emotional.

513
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:04,518
- She misses me.
- Well, she's gonna be

514
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,062
seeing a lot more of you now,

515
00:20:06,064 --> 00:20:07,438
'cause you're fired.
Could you see him out?

516
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,231
Now, this is what's
gonna happen.

517
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,734
From this moment forth,
none of you has a life.

518
00:20:11,736 --> 00:20:14,403
You have no wives,
no girlfriends, no kids.

519
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:15,947
You have only this.

520
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,615
You live this show.

521
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,241
You breathe this show.

522
00:20:19,243 --> 00:20:22,078
When you masturbate,
you think about this show.

523
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,913
You're finally going to earn
those big, fat paychecks

524
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:25,873
that have been paying
for your divorces

525
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,208
and gym memberships
you clearly never use.

526
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,709
Think about
why the show is bad,

527
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:30,378
and come up with ways
to fix it.

528
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,966
And, Eight, sit on a chair
tomorrow, for God's sake!

529
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:36,342
Okay.

530
00:20:36,344 --> 00:20:37,885
So...

531
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:40,721
Can I take
the fired man's seat?

532
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:42,473
We're all gonna be out of jobs.

533
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,808
I'm gonna have to move
to Long Island City,

534
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,351
probably sell all my clothes.

535
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:47,269
- Don't be so dramatic.
- Oh, how would you know?

536
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:48,646
You don't even have
nice clothes.

537
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,231
Okay, it's not
all that surprising.

538
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,649
Any of your friends talk
about the show anymore?

539
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:52,942
No, it's a relic.
Okay? There's no buzz

540
00:20:52,944 --> 00:20:54,443
- about it at all.
- No. - TOM: Hey.

541
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:56,070
It's not a relic, okay?
She is an icon.

542
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:57,321
I mean,
it would take them a month

543
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,572
just to remove
all of her Emmys.

544
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,116
Well, you know, who knows?

545
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:01,534
Maybe Little Miss
Chemical Plant can help us.

546
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:03,202
TOM: Please, don't even
joke about that.

547
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:04,954
You know what, Reynolds?
Give me one of your Xanaxes.

548
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:06,122
No, I need all my Xannies
now that I'm in the poorhouse.

549
00:21:06,124 --> 00:21:09,250
Molly Patel!
Molly Patel,

550
00:21:09,252 --> 00:21:12,253
- the quality control specialist.
- TOM: Oh, my God.

551
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:14,714
MANCUSO: Hobbies include
ruining our lives.

552
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:17,216
TOM: I don't think she's worked
a day in television.

553
00:21:17,218 --> 00:21:18,926
You know, I think
she's a pathological liar.

554
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:21,429
I wish I was a woman of color
so I could just get

555
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:23,139
any job I want
with zero qualifications.

556
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:25,266
We talked about this.
You can't say that.

557
00:21:25,268 --> 00:21:27,977
(CHUCKLING)

558
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:29,353
Hey, man.

559
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,355
You remember, uh,
Molly from earlier?

560
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,774
Yes. She told everyone
the show was bad.

561
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:36,736
That's her. You'll be sharing
an office with her.

562
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:38,740
Brad? Brad. Brad?

563
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:43,200
This is nice. Who's that?

564
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,910
That's the guy
whose desk you're taking.

565
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:47,079
He was fired last week.

566
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:49,500
He was my best friend.

567
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:03,596
So...
you must be pretty new, too.

568
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:05,058
You don't have any stuff.

569
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:09,101
Oh, I-I've been here 27 years.

570
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:11,939
In case I get fired, I don't
want to get too comfortable.

571
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,359
So, are you gonna tell me
about your day?

572
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:19,153
It was a bit like
trying to mount

573
00:22:19,155 --> 00:22:20,529
a prison production
of Hamlet.

574
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:22,198
But at least prisoners
get sunlight

575
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,742
- and exercise once a day.
- (LAUGHS)

576
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,702
That sounds very promising.

577
00:22:26,704 --> 00:22:28,871
You always worked best
with a captive audience.

578
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:31,415
(LAUGHS)

579
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,459
Right now it is
a hostile environment

580
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:35,711
in which to be
an educated white male.

581
00:22:35,713 --> 00:22:38,380
I mean, it's staggering
how unfair it is, okay?

582
00:22:38,382 --> 00:22:40,716
Staggering.

583
00:22:40,718 --> 00:22:42,384
Yeah, they completely
overlooked my brother.

584
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:43,969
All right.

585
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:45,346
She's, like, a diversity hire
or something.

586
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:46,806
Man, she'll be here 13 weeks.

587
00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:48,601
She's, like,
a single mom or something.

588
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:52,520
Hey.

589
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:54,188
I'm not a single mom,
by the way.

590
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,439
I just look like one.

591
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,066
And I guess I dress like one.

592
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:59,527
No, I...
I-I wasn't talking about you.

593
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:01,612
- Then who were you talking about?
- Uh, my...

594
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,280
cleaning lady.

595
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:04,992
Your brother lost a job
to your housekeeper?

596
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:07,409
- Yep.
- Whatever.

597
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:08,869
Just so you know,
I'd rather be

598
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:10,329
a diversity hire
than a nepotism hire.

599
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:12,039
'Cause at least
I had to beat out

600
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,499
every minority and woman
to get here.

601
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:17,211
You just had to be born.

602
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:19,880
TOM: Hey, you know, one of my
grandparents was an immigrant.

603
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:21,757
This documentary was insane.

604
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,217
It said, basically,
we're all covered

605
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:25,052
in, like, tiny bugs and...

606
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:27,265
- Oh.
- No cupcakes today.

607
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:41,360
So, Molly, what is your deal?

608
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:44,488
Well, I am from central
Pennsylvania. I love to laugh.

609
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,532
No, boring.
Like, what do you hate?

610
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:48,993
What neighborhood do you
live in? Who are you fucking?

611
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:51,829
Uh, I, uh... I hate injustice.

612
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,330
(TOM SCOFFS)

613
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,708
I live with my aunt
and uncle in Queens.

614
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,960
And I'm not sleeping
with anybody.

615
00:23:57,962 --> 00:24:00,045
- Where'd you go to school?
- Luzerne Community College.

616
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:02,006
- Loser Community College?
- (LAUGHTER)

617
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:04,175
- Luzerne.
- Oh, 'cause it really sounded like you said "loser."

618
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:06,385
- Yeah, but why would I say that?
- Don't listen to them.

619
00:24:06,387 --> 00:24:08,554
I dropped out of high school
and worked at the docks.

620
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:10,389
That's why I write
so many jokes about seagulls.

621
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:12,600
So, what is the stage like?
I cannot wait to see it.

622
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:14,518
We're not allowed on the stage.
Only Brad and Tom.

623
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,312
TOM: Yeah,
I'm head monologue writer.

624
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:18,772
You are? 'Cause you hadn't
mentioned it in ten minutes.

625
00:24:18,774 --> 00:24:20,149
- I was worried.
- (LAUGHS)

626
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:21,567
Wait, so you all write
on the show,

627
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:23,154
and you've never been
to the stage?

628
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:25,696
Okay. Okay.

629
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,531
This is how it works.

630
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,158
The writers are supposed

631
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,493
- to get here at 10:00.
- Good morning.

632
00:24:31,495 --> 00:24:33,495
I usually get here at 9:00.

633
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:35,206
Then we go into our offices
and read

634
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,916
the newspaper headlines
for joke ideas.

635
00:24:36,918 --> 00:24:39,793
Some of us are a little more
focused than others.

636
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:41,879
Then we submit our jokes to
Brad, who makes his selects.

637
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,839
That's what makes it
in the show.

638
00:24:43,841 --> 00:24:45,382
- Here you go.
- I usually get some good stuff in there.

639
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,926
Ah!

640
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:48,260
Then we meet up
in the writers' room

641
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:49,887
to go over Brad's selects.

642
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:52,348
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- Oh, kiss my ass!

643
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,308
Then at 6:30,
the show starts taping,

644
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,684
and we all watch.

645
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:58,604
And that is how we make
a TV show.

646
00:24:58,606 --> 00:25:01,941
So you never interact with her
once the entire day?

647
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:04,237
Until yesterday, most of us
hadn't even met her.

648
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:08,489
- (TOILET FLUSHES)
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

649
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:09,740
I thought this was
the women's room.

650
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,367
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

651
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:12,826
You're right. It is...
it is the women's room.

652
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:14,328
We just... we haven't had
a woman here

653
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,206
in, like, ever,
so yeah, we use it.

654
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,832
Doesn't Katherine mind?

655
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:20,292
You kidding me?
No, she doesn't come in here.

656
00:25:20,294 --> 00:25:21,669
She has her own bathroom.

657
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:23,837
We actually...
we-we come in here to...

658
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:25,589
to take a shit.

659
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:29,551
I don't understand anything
about this job.

660
00:25:29,553 --> 00:25:32,054
Well, you're right about
not being allowed on set.

661
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:33,389
It's fucked up.

662
00:25:33,391 --> 00:25:35,140
So, why don't you say
something?

663
00:25:35,142 --> 00:25:37,309
(LAUGHS) Like,
"See Something, Say Something"?

664
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:39,311
Because it's not
airport security, Molly.

665
00:25:39,313 --> 00:25:40,813
It's a TV show.

666
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:45,317
And she's not the, uh,
classy role model

667
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:47,780
you've been watching
on TV for 20 years.

668
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:52,032
Hey, you know... you know what?

669
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:54,159
I'm doing stand-up
tomorrow night, all right?

670
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:55,703
Come see me.

671
00:25:55,705 --> 00:25:57,748
We'll get a drink after.

672
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,294

673
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:03,752
(DOOR CLOSES)

674
00:26:03,754 --> 00:26:05,129
Okay.
Let's get going, everybody.

675
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,964
One, you're up.

676
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:09,466
I have an idea entitled
"Hollywood Zoo."

677
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,635
It's animals
that look like celebrities.

678
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:14,888
- No.
- And... or celebrities that look like animals?

679
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,849
Can I? Okay.

680
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,270
"Shrimp My Ride."

681
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,062
"Fancy Pelosi."

682
00:26:22,064 --> 00:26:24,815
"Celebrity Fitted-Sheet
Folding Challenge."

683
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,358
Yeah, we worked
on that together.

684
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,651
It's where we have you
and a celebrity race

685
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:28,986
to fold a fitted sheet.

686
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,988
(CHUCKLES)
You know what? Forget it.

687
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,532
Can I just remind
everybody here

688
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:37,119
that the stakes
could not be higher.

689
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:38,787
- Two, go.
- Uh, okay.

690
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:40,539
So, the Miss America pageant

691
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,499
and the Westminster Dog Show
are both the same week.

692
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,335
So I thought,
why not combine the two?

693
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:45,961
We ask the girls
to run around in a circle,

694
00:26:45,963 --> 00:26:48,130
and we ask the dogs
their take on immigration.

695
00:26:48,132 --> 00:26:50,424
Oh, the Miss America pageant.

696
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:52,551
The scholarship competition
where it's still appropriate

697
00:26:52,553 --> 00:26:54,303
to ask a beautiful teenager
from Tampa

698
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:55,679
who can't afford college

699
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,723
but who can afford
breast implants

700
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:59,099
about world peace.

701
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:00,059
No, we're not gonna be
doing that.

702
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:01,143
Where's John Phillips?

703
00:27:01,145 --> 00:27:02,061
I want to hear his pitches.

704
00:27:02,063 --> 00:27:04,607
- Um...
- Um...

705
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:07,232
What?

706
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:10,819
Uh, John died in 2012.

707
00:27:10,821 --> 00:27:12,446
John's dead?
Are you kidding me?

708
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:15,157
About the death
of our coworker? No.

709
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:16,700
Oh, that's terrible.

710
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:19,119
- He was so funny.
- Yeah.

711
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:20,996
Eight, what?

712
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:23,415
First of all,
I'm very sorry for your loss.

713
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:25,167
He sounded like
an incredible person.

714
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:27,544
Second, I'm really honored

715
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,588
to be presenting my ideas
here today.

716
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,632
Oh, God, I wish I was
John Phillips.

717
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:33,509
So, I thought I would
take a step back

718
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:35,260
and see what wasn't working.

719
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:37,137
This is what I do
at quality control

720
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:39,390
at the chemical plant, and I
thought I would do that here.

721
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,851
The headline of my analysis
is "Complacency."

722
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:45,521
And I noticed that there's
three major areas

723
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:47,314
where there could be
a lot of improvement.

724
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:49,441
The first is your
overall unwillingness to do

725
00:27:49,443 --> 00:27:51,318
high-concept recurring bits...
you know, where you have to

726
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,112
physically leave the studio.

727
00:27:53,114 --> 00:27:55,322
Those are the ones that can
go viral if executed well.

728
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:59,284
The second is your total lack
of presence on social media.

729
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:01,662
You seem to have contempt
for it, which feels ill-advised

730
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,289
because most of your audience
is watching on their phones.

731
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,417
The third:
I think people get very excited

732
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,210
when you share your beliefs.

733
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:10,212
So, what you just said
about the Miss America pageant,

734
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:11,839
that was awesome.

735
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:13,841
When you reveal those kind
of strong opinions,

736
00:28:13,843 --> 00:28:16,009
it's when you really
come alive as a performer.

737
00:28:16,011 --> 00:28:18,512
That's when I come alive
as a performer?

738
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:20,305
- Yeah.
- Can I see that?

739
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:22,226
Absolutely.

740
00:28:23,978 --> 00:28:25,894
I just want to say,
I'm no longer attached

741
00:28:25,896 --> 00:28:27,563
to this idea
in any shape or form.

742
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:29,982

746

Oh, I don't have one.

747
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,912

have any new ideas or jokes?

No.

I've been doing this job

for nearly 30 years,
and I know what works.

751
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:51,378
And I'll tell you
what doesn't work:

752
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,422
an absurdly confident newcomer
coming in, criticizing my show

753
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:56,717
and giving me her assessment
of my comic persona

754
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:59,636
without doing the hard work of
presenting me with solutions.

755
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:01,680
This-this room is a ship.

They don't want smart comedy.

what they want.

of abortion in it.

One of the writers, everybody.

1186
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:05,620
- Hi.
- How would you describe Molly?

1187
00:46:05,622 --> 00:46:07,288
Molly? Molly...

1188
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,082
Molly is... (GROANS)

1189
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:12,335
She said I was
the vibrant splash of color

1190
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:15,171
on the gray canvas
of our writing staff.

1191
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:16,672
I was really touched.

1192
00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:18,007
- Mm.
- And then she said something to me

1193
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,258
- that I will never forget.
- Mm-hmm.

1194
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,718
She said to me that,

1195
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,595
despite our very different
backgrounds,

1196
00:46:22,597 --> 00:46:24,597
that I reminded her

1197
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:26,807
- of a younger her.
- Younger me.

1198
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:27,892
- ROBIN: Isn't that wonderful?

- Huge. (LAUGHS)
- Mm...

1201
00:46:32,148 --> 00:46:34,023
You know what? Everybody's
gonna want to get this.

- Let's get a picture

1203
00:46:35,902 --> 00:46:39,028
of Katherine and her beautiful

1204
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,530
- Molly.
- ROBIN: Molly.

Thank you.

1209
00:46:48,957 --> 00:46:51,207
Yeah, it's pretty good.

Oh, I think it's going
beautifully.

But it's still early.

00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:05,388
You want to come over?

1216
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,848
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Oh, excuse me.

- Thank you.

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

1220
00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:15,982
Wait, really?

1221
00:47:15,984 --> 00:47:18,568
(LAUGHING): No, I just set that
before I came over.

1222
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,194
- Very funny. Very, very funny.
- Come on.

1224
00:47:22,824 --> 00:47:24,073
- Hey.
- I guess everybody can get

1225

invited to this party.

(CHUCKLES)
Uh, I would like

1227
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:28,869
to introduce you two
to Danny Tennant.

1228
00:47:28,871 --> 00:47:30,746
- Danny, Walter Lovell.
- Hey, man.

1229
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:32,164
How you doing, Walter?

1230
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:33,416
- And, of course...
- Wow.

1231
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:35,084
- Katherine Newbury.
- Wow.

1232
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,460
Classiest couple
in New York City

1233
00:47:36,462 --> 00:47:38,004
since Diane Sawyer
and Mike Nichols.

1234
00:47:38,006 --> 00:47:39,714
Danny here...
very funny, very famous,

1235
00:47:39,716 --> 00:47:41,757
and currently,
every female coed

1236
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:43,551
in the United States
wants to lose

1237
00:47:43,553 --> 00:47:45,678
- their virginity to him.
- Stop. That's... Just half.

1238
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,555
- Well, that's gonna keep you busy.
- Mm.

1239
00:47:47,557 --> 00:47:49,932
And, Katherine, I'm sorry,
I have to say, I am such a fan.

1240
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:52,310
I mean, you were such an
inspiration for me growing up.

1241
00:47:52,312 --> 00:47:54,312
And your comedy is so smart.

1242
00:47:54,314 --> 00:47:55,938
You know, I'll-I'll be watching
your show, and I have to, like,

1243
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,440
look up half the words you say.
(LAUGHS)

1244
00:47:57,442 --> 00:47:59,692
(CHUCKLES)
That's so kind.

1245
00:47:59,694 --> 00:48:02,653
Did you take a shit
in anyone's shoes yet?

1246
00:48:02,655 --> 00:48:04,322
- Um...
- You know, from your stand-up.

1247
00:48:04,324 --> 00:48:06,240
When you're at parties,
you like to take a shit

1248
00:48:06,242 --> 00:48:07,783
- in other people's shoes.
- (LAUGHTER)

1249
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:09,660
That's from the special.
You saw the special.

1250
00:48:09,662 --> 00:48:10,786
- BILLY: Yeah, well...
- DANIEL: Remember that?

1251
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:12,913
- Diarrhea!
- (LAUGHTER)

1252
00:48:12,915 --> 00:48:15,416
Did you enjoy talking
to my writing staff?

1253
00:48:15,418 --> 00:48:18,502
- Yes. Talented guys.
- They are.

1254
00:48:18,504 --> 00:48:20,546
Charlie Fain, especially.

1255
00:48:20,548 --> 00:48:23,966
So, Danny, what's next for you?
Prank show on MTV?

1256
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:25,885
Or an arena tour
sponsored by an energy drink?

1257
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:27,345
(CHUCKLES)
No, I think, actually,

1258
00:48:27,347 --> 00:48:29,180
I'm gonna take
a little bit of time off,

1259
00:48:29,182 --> 00:48:31,098
you know,
and work on some new material

1260
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,809
and just kind of kick around
some new ideas and stuff.

1261
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:35,478
You're at the height
of your stand-up career,

1262
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,148
and you're stopping
to kick around ideas?

1263
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,902
Yeah.

1264
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:44,737
Oh.

1265
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:46,614
Daniel Tennant?!

1266
00:48:46,616 --> 00:48:49,909
You're replacing me
with Daniel fucking Tennant?!

1267
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:51,535
We're in negotiations with him.
Thank you, Margaret.

1268
00:48:51,537 --> 00:48:52,912
You cannot do this.

1269
00:48:52,914 --> 00:48:54,580
We are working
on something back there.

1270
00:48:54,582 --> 00:48:56,707
- You have to give us a chance.
- You had a chance.

1271
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:59,251
That's what ten years
of ratings decline is.

1272
00:48:59,253 --> 00:49:00,961
Look, you can make it easy
for yourself.

1273
00:49:00,963 --> 00:49:02,963
You can welcome him in,
make it seem like

1274
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:04,382
you were part of the decision.

1275
00:49:04,384 --> 00:49:05,758
Or it can be hard.

1276
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,301
The choice is
entirely up to you.

1277
00:49:07,303 --> 00:49:09,220
Believe me,
I take no pleasure in this.

1278
00:49:09,222 --> 00:49:11,013
Oh, for God's sake,
do me the courtesy

1279
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:13,015
of at least not lying
to my face.

1280
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:15,476
(LAUGHING): Fine. I take a
great deal of pleasure in this.

1281
00:49:15,478 --> 00:49:18,521
Katherine, did you ever wonder
if I think you're funny?

1282
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:20,064
No.

1283
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:21,524
Do you think I should think
you're funny,

1284
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:22,942
as president of the network
you're on?

1285
00:49:22,944 --> 00:49:25,653
I've seen six presidents
of this network

1286
00:49:25,655 --> 00:49:27,405
come and go
while I've been here.

1287
00:49:27,407 --> 00:49:30,574
Somalian fucking warlords
have more job stability.

1288
00:49:30,576 --> 00:49:32,451
You didn't answer my question.

1289
00:49:32,453 --> 00:49:35,830
If you're asking me if I've
ever respected your taste,

1290
00:49:35,832 --> 00:49:38,332
then the answer, Caroline,
is no.

1291
00:49:38,334 --> 00:49:41,168
And if you want
to replace me with a meme...

1292
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,129
a T-shirt of a man
who hides his xenophobia

1293
00:49:43,131 --> 00:49:44,880
and, by the way,
his hatred of women

1294
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:47,675
behind a congenial
frat-boy persona...

1295
00:49:47,677 --> 00:49:49,760
just to make yourself
seem relevant,

1296
00:49:49,762 --> 00:49:51,637
then, by all means,
you go ahead.

1297
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:54,100

destroy the show that I built.

You remember how kids

used to have those, like,
little games in their pocket.

Where are you going?

1304

Oh, uh, Four and I have
that charity comedy event.

1305

- I'm the emcee.
- Well, you're not going.

I'm so sorry. I have to go.
It starts in 30 minutes,

1307

and there would be no one
to replace me.

And who's going to be
replacing you here?

Four's not going.

1311

- Molly, it's not worth it.
- I would listen to that.

1312
00:50:39,604 --> 00:50:41,272
That's pretty good advice.

1313
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,150
I have stayed late
every single night this month.

1314
00:50:46,152 --> 00:50:47,985
It's for a charity.

1315
00:50:47,987 --> 00:50:50,404
- I'm sorry, I'm very torn.
- Well, you shouldn't be torn,

1316
00:50:50,406 --> 00:50:52,323
and you shouldn't be letting me
know that you're torn.

1317
00:50:52,325 --> 00:50:54,116
You can't just download
your emotional state onto me

1318
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:56,952
and hope that your honesty
will somehow exonerate you.

00:50:59,081 --> 00:51:00,706

Uh, it's-it's
"upload your emotional state."

1322
00:51:02,794 --> 00:51:04,585
So, if, um...
if you take something

1323
00:51:04,587 --> 00:51:05,920
off the Internet,
that's "download."

1324
00:51:05,922 --> 00:51:07,838
If you put something on,
that's "upload."

were the Internet...

here to be with you guys.

I got fired, and, um,

1351
00:52:18,286 --> 00:52:20,035
I didn't think
that was possible.

1352
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:23,372
I mean, look at me, guys.

1353
00:52:23,374 --> 00:52:27,042
Look. I am a dark-skinned
Indian woman.

1354
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:28,878
- Aren't I un-fireable?
- (LAUGHTER)

1355
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,589
I mean, I'm a token,
for God's sakes. You don't...

1356
00:52:31,591 --> 00:52:33,382
Why is this for lung cancer?

1357
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,801
I think the emcee girl's dad
died from it.

1358
00:52:35,803 --> 00:52:38,345
- Who's the emcee?
- I think she works at Colbert.

1359
00:52:38,347 --> 00:52:40,264
- She works for me.
- MOLLY: See, now

1360
00:52:40,266 --> 00:52:42,182
I'm convincing myself that
I-I should've been fired.

1361
00:52:42,184 --> 00:52:43,851
- (LAUGHTER)
- Thank you so much for being here, and thank you

1362
00:52:43,853 --> 00:52:45,352
for coming out
for this great cause.

1363
00:52:45,354 --> 00:52:48,691
Let's keep it going.
Our next performer is...

1364
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:56,697
Our next performer, uh, uh...

1365
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:59,325
Okay, this is surprising
for a-a variety of reasons.

1366
00:52:59,327 --> 00:53:02,411
Our next performer is
Katherine Newbury, everyone.

1369
00:53:06,918 --> 00:53:09,043
Thanks.
Thank you. Thank you.

1370
00:53:09,045 --> 00:53:10,836
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1371
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:12,089
Thank you very much.

1372
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,591
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1373
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:16,969
Thank you. Now shut up.

1374
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:19,678
So, I joined Twitter.

1375
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,597
I didn't want to.
My publicist made me.

1376
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,058
And... (SIGHS)
I was okay at first.

1377
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,101
I was... with the twittering
and the tweeting,

1378
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:28,020
but do you know
where it lost me?

1379
00:53:28,022 --> 00:53:31,023
Fave-ing. Fave-ing.

1380
00:53:31,025 --> 00:53:34,902
Because "fave" is short
for "favorite," right?

1381
00:53:34,904 --> 00:53:37,947
But you can only have
one favorite.

1382
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,573
You can only have one.

1383
00:53:39,575 --> 00:53:41,661
You can't have lots
of favorites. It's stupid.

1384
00:53:43,204 --> 00:53:44,453
F-Faves. Faves.

1385
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,455
They can't all be
your favorite.

1386
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:47,959
It's stupid.

1387
00:53:51,879 --> 00:53:56,382
Lot of Twitter fans
in the audience tonight, I see.

1388
00:53:56,384 --> 00:53:59,470
So, that's not working.

1389
00:54:02,348 --> 00:54:05,265
Well, shit, guys.

1390
00:54:05,267 --> 00:54:08,479
I don't know.
I just don't know.

1391
00:54:10,064 --> 00:54:12,189
I guess that's why

1392
00:54:12,191 --> 00:54:15,359
they're taking my show
away from me.

1393
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:17,945
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

1394
00:54:17,947 --> 00:54:19,991
Yeah, that's happening.

1395
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,912
They're taking my show away,
and the thing is...

1396
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:33,877
The thing is,
if they take my show away,

1397
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:37,633
I do not know
what I am going to do.

1398
00:54:39,593 --> 00:54:42,722
I am a woman in my 50s
in Hollywood.

1399
00:54:44,682 --> 00:54:46,765
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

1400
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:50,354
In Hollywood,
what am I going to do?

1401
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:56,485
You know what? I've got it.

1402
00:54:58,446 --> 00:55:00,362
I could play
Sean Penn's grandmother

1403
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:02,656
in the movie where he
is married to Emma Stone.

1404

- (LAUGHTER)
- His childhood sweetheart.

1405
00:55:05,786 --> 00:55:07,494
It's so unfair.

1406
00:55:07,496 --> 00:55:09,455
I mean, Tom Cruise
is the same age as me.

1407
00:55:09,457 --> 00:55:11,040
We're the same age.

1408
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:12,791
He gets to fight the Mummy.
I am the Mummy.

1409
00:55:12,793 --> 00:55:14,293
- (LAUGHING)
- You know what? No, no, no.

1410
00:55:14,295 --> 00:55:15,836
I'm too old to play the Mummy.

1411
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:17,671
They'd get Anne Hathaway in
to play the Mummy

1412
00:55:17,673 --> 00:55:19,173
and put, like,
Mummy makeup on her.

1413
00:55:19,175 --> 00:55:20,591
- (LAUGHTER)
- I'm probably gonna have to have

1414
00:55:20,593 --> 00:55:22,301
a facelift
just to do voice work.

1415
00:55:22,303 --> 00:55:24,845
I'm gonna have to have, like,
Botox and lip filler

1416
00:55:24,847 --> 00:55:28,640
just to play the voice of a
wise old tree in a Pixar movie.

1417
00:55:28,642 --> 00:55:30,392
- (LAUGHTER)
- You know when you're watching

1418
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:32,728
an awards show, and they play
people off with music?

1419
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,772
You know, when they've gone on
for too long?

1420
00:55:34,774 --> 00:55:36,523
I feel like that's what they're
doing to my life right now.

1421
00:55:36,525 --> 00:55:38,984
They're just,
"Get off. Time to die.

"Just fuck off.

"Take that old face
and just go.

This is my fault.

You were too scared to tell me
what you really think,

00:56:36,585 --> 00:56:38,796
and I think I was too scared
to hear the truth.

1446
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:44,716
I am the only woman in
late-night network television,

1447

but I have been doing the same
format and the same jokes...

hell, even the same cadences...
as some of these other guys.

So, what are you saying?

1450
00:56:53,769 --> 00:56:54,935
You want more jokes
about female issues?

00:56:54,937 --> 00:56:56,270
No, Seven, I-I'm not asking you

1452
00:56:56,272 --> 00:56:58,021
to write me a tight five
on menstruation.

1453
00:56:58,023 --> 00:57:00,357
I just want to say only things
I can talk about.

Nothing is off-limits.
If you think it's funny,

I don't care
how personal it is.

I am a 56-year-old Englishwoman

about me, come and talk to me.

I swear I will not
scream at you.

I want it to be specific,
and I want it to be political.

I'm gonna do the abortion joke
tomorrow, and, Seven,

1463

she's writing monologue jokes
with you.

how to write jokes overnight.

(CHUCKLES) No. I hate
to break this to you, Seven,

1468
00:57:30,222 --> 00:57:31,930
but you're not gonna be
teaching anything,

1469
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:34,099
because I want someone
who doesn't think in exactly

1470

the same way as everyone else
in the goddamn room.

1471

monologue jokes with you.

obsessed with women's sex lives

1493
00:58:24,193 --> 00:58:25,901
To be honest,

1494
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:28,320
you're a little old
and a little white.

1495
00:58:28,322 --> 00:58:30,572
Okay. Those are facts.

1496
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,785
What the fuck can I do
about that?

1497
00:58:34,453 --> 00:58:37,704
So, recently,
someone accused me of being,

1498
00:58:37,706 --> 00:58:40,999
quote, "a little bit old
and a little bit white."

1499
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:44,044
To which I responded:
"I'm very old and very white."

1500
00:58:44,046 --> 00:58:46,713
- I never do things halfway.
- (LAUGHTER)

1501
00:58:46,715 --> 00:58:48,757
But what can a person like me
do about that?

1502
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:51,218
If I try and fix it,
I can come across

1503
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,595
as trying to be some sort
of white savior.

1504
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:55,389
Then I decided
I was okay with that,

1505
00:58:55,391 --> 00:58:59,184
so let me introduce you
to a new series on Tonight:

1506
00:58:59,186 --> 00:59:01,353
"Katherine Newbury:

1507
00:59:01,355 --> 00:59:03,689
My name is Katherine Newbury.
Do you watch my show?

1508
00:59:03,691 --> 00:59:05,023
- No.
- Nah.

1509
00:59:05,025 --> 00:59:08,193
Okay.
Well, that's demoralizing.

1510
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:10,737
Could you tell me if there's
been any instance recently

1511
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:12,906
where you feel that you've been
treated differently

1512
00:59:12,908 --> 00:59:14,574
because of the way you look?

1513
00:59:14,576 --> 00:59:17,244
- Yeah.
- I feel like I can never hail a cab.

1514
00:59:17,246 --> 00:59:19,705
You feel like you can

an interesting term:

2193
01:28:04,972 --> 01:28:07,931
"slut-shaming."

2194
01:28:07,933 --> 01:28:11,768
My supporters have said
that if I were a man,

2195
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:13,770
I wouldn't be subject
to this kind of scrutiny.

2196
01:28:13,772 --> 01:28:15,564
Well, here's what I think.

2197
01:28:15,566 --> 01:28:17,774
If it were a man doing this,
it would be reprehensible,

2198
01:28:17,776 --> 01:28:19,860
but guess what...
it's a woman doing it,

2199
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:22,112
and it's still reprehensible.

2200
01:28:22,114 --> 01:28:26,116
And none of this
would even matter

2201
01:28:26,118 --> 01:28:28,452
if I were not so...

2202
01:28:28,454 --> 01:28:33,623

with such high standards

2203

my career by it.

have no one else in my life,
so...

2208
01:28:55,022 --> 01:28:56,730
...so when this happened,

2209
01:28:56,732 --> 01:28:58,732
I felt worse
than I have ever felt.

2210
01:28:58,734 --> 01:29:00,901
