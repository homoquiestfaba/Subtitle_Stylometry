00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:33,134
Well, there are seven questions.

111
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,135

112
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,603

118
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:42,844

119
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:43,778

120
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,646
Okay, in 10 minutes we'll be

121

122
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,592
and you'll be sad and
I'll be the bitch.

123
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:51,484
So can we please just fall
apart somewhere private.

124
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,597
- Al, it's just seven questions.
- Like a normal couple.

125
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,731

kill each other.

127
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,137

134
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:15,085

four tomorrow, three Sunday,

138
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,660
or we could do it
the other way around.

139
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:26,020

we go back to L.A. happy,

you know, together.

141
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,189

00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,076
It's a dream.

185
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,612
[Carly] When did
you guys get married?

186
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,547
Eight long years ago.

187
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,617
No, you're so young.

188
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,887
Yeah, we were 16, it was Texas.

189
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,155
Oh.

190
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,690
Well you have such
a beautiful face.

191
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,692
Is that what you do in L.A?

192
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:45,926
Have a face?

193
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,297
No, I meant model or act or.

194
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:51,432
Yeah, she does.

195
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:54,769
She's an actress or starting
out anyway, right baby?

196
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,037
Yep.

197
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,171
I guess that's it.

198
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,907
Oh, oh, did you see the
Ferris wheel on your way in?

199
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,809
The Brians set it
up every summer.

200
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,310
Wine, picnics.

201
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:05,055
Yeah, no, I was hoping we
could hit that on Sunday,

202
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:05,913
on our way back home.

203
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,782
If we're not divorced.

204
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,050
That's why we're here.

205
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,184
Jesus.

206
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,054
Yeah, we're just
sorting some things out.

207
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,321
Okay.

208
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:17,792
If you need anything,
you have our numbers.

209
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,560
[Walker] Thanks.

210
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:21,228
[Carly] Good night.

211
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:22,262
Night.

212
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,702
God, I need a bath.

213
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,918
(insects chirping)

214
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,729
Hey, how are they?

215
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,765
Oh, he's a sweetheart.

216
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,334
She's ahh, she's beautiful.

217
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:01,235
[Ben] Yeah.

218
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,436
Yeah.

219
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,039
This sounds bad, but you can
tell she's the kind of girl

220
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,641
that just thinks she's too
good for him, you know?

221
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,243
Yeah, yeah, I know the kind.

222
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,044
[Carly] Really?

223
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,011
Yeah, for sure, like beautiful,

224
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,714
thinks they're too
good for their fiances.

225
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,649
Yeah, why do I
get the sense that

226
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:18,719
in your case it's actually true.

227
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:19,653
I have no idea.

228
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,055
No?

229
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,088
Okay then.

230
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,426
Hey.

231
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,229
(gentle music)

232
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,153
Hey.

233
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:53,921
[Albee] I'm in the bath.

234
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,689
Well, I know that.

235
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,158
You want some champagne?

236
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:58,459
No.

237
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,328
(gentle music)

238
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,966
[Walker] What's going on?

239
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:09,203
Walker, what happens
if it doesn't work?

240
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:13,073
(gentle music)

241
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:15,342
Why do you keep asking me that?

242
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:19,346
[Albee] Just walk me through it.

243
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:24,351
Well, we break up, I guess.

244
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:26,954
I don't know, we finish it.

245
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,856
It's like you said, right.

246
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,725
But I think if we got
through this last month,

247
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,795
I think we can get
through anything.

248
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,231
(gentle music)

249
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:42,342
We would be okay, right?

250
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,369
I mean,

251
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:47,241
you would be okay.

252
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,843
(gentle music)

253
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:54,848
(insects chirping)

254
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,170
(both laughing)

255
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,004
Shut up.

256
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,105
Really though.

257
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,306
I am.

258
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,542
I'm really happy.

259
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:22,843
[Carly] Me too.

260
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,845
Let's not change that, yeah.

261
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,247
Let's just always have fun.

262
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,082
Yeah, I'd like that.

263
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:33,320
Hey, I was thinking

264
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:38,993
maybe we should have them
over for lunch, the guests.

265
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,794
You said that she was a dick.

266
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,263
No, they're just young.

267
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:44,932
I think they're having
relationship problems.

268
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,534
What about our rule?

269
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:47,868
No hang with the guests.

270
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:48,802
[Carly] Yeah, you hate rules.

271
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,271
Yeah I do, I'm a rebel.

272
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:51,071
(both laughing)

273
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,006
[Carly] Yeah.

274
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,440
Oh but seriously though,

275
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:55,553
bad relationships are
contagious, we don't want that.

276
00:12:55,577 --> 00:12:57,478
That's silly, it's one meal.

277
00:12:57,512 --> 00:13:00,147
I love that you care about them,

278
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,150
but maybe they're not
supposed be together.

279
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,885
Maybe they are.

280
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,987
Well then they will be.

281
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,525
(gentle music)

282
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,077
[Walker] Hey.

283
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,613
Is there no WiFi here?

284
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:34,948
Seriously, there's no
service and no WiFi.

285
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,184
Did I not mention that?

286
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,118
You sure?

287
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,621
It must have slipped my mind.

288
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:40,997
But there are bears here,
what if something happens?

289
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,190
Babe, if you get
attacked by a bear,

290
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,059
who the hell are you calling?

291
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,061
The bear police.

292
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,997
(both laughing)

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,935
I don't know why you
didn't just get twin beds,

294
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,937
that couch looks shitty.

295
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,974
Well because I am an optimist.

296
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,419
I'm not there.

297
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:13,453
Okay.

298
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:16,890
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:20,127
No, that's, that's okay.

300
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,330
It's okay.

301
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,001
Sleep tight.

302
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:02,903
(birds chirping)

303
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:14,047
(gentle music)

304
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,022
Al?

305
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:25,225
(gentle upbeat music)

306
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,503
(birds chirping)

307
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:38,172
(gentle upbeat music)

308
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:40,608
(birds chirping)

309
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:43,477
(gentle upbeat music)

310
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:44,511
Shit.

311
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:19,112
(cellphone vibrating)

312
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:22,249
(gentle upbeat music)

313
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:52,145
Hey.

314
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,113
Hey.

315
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,047
Is that alter coming?

316
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,526
You think you might
finish it this week?

317
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,550
Yeah.

318
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,351
Maybe.

319
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,153
Yeah.

320
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,288
Hey, any of that for me?

321
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,321
Nope.

322
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:04,826
Oh wait, wait, wait,

323
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,794
let me run that down.

324
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:08,763
I don't trust you.

325
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,667
Love you, Babe.

326
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,302
(gentle music)

327
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,582
(birds chirping)

328
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:56,209
Got it.

329
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,380
Okay.

330
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,418
Shall we do this?

331
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:11,191
All right, let's see.

332
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,327
It says, "Creating a
sense of space and peace

333
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,228
"between you and your spouse.

334
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,599
"Ask each other the
following question.

335
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:19,534
"Remember, there are no
right or wrong answers.

336
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,335
"There are just contra."

337
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,203
Look it's basically just saying

338
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:23,905
that we need to be super honest

339
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:25,272
and we already agreed that we're

340
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,374
gonna do that, right?
- Let's just go.

341
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,176
Yeah.

342
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:31,178
I'm gonna.

343
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:44,792
So, Albee, what was the first
thing that drew you to me?

344
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:46,628
So like, what did
you like about me?

345
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:47,595
Oh is that what that means?

346
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:49,238
Why are you being
so pissy this morning?

347
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,566
I don't know, why are
you being so stupid?

348
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,511
First thing that comes to mind,

349
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:57,237
just whatever
attracted you to me.

350
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,271
Oh my God.

351
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,275
Al.

352
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:04,646
Al.

353
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,848
Hold on, I'm thinking.

354
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:08,315
That you liked me, I guess.

355
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,517
[Walker] That I liked you.

356
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,785
Sure.

357
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:13,453
That I liked you,
are you being serious?

358
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:14,932
So, I could have
been a serial killer,

359
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:15,966
but as long as I liked you.

360
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,525
God, that's so dramatic.

361
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,198
Also, you said there
are no wrong answers.

362
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:20,728
No.

363
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:21,972
No, you actually used to say
really nice things about me.

364
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,296
Okay, fine, I liked your laugh.

365
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,297
Is that better?

366
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,298
God, it was so long ago.

367
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,266
Well, shit, I remember.

368
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,735
You remember meeting me?

369
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:28,936
Yeah.

370
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,279
Yeah, I'm gonna sound
like an idiot now,

371
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,806
but of course I remember

372
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,474
the first time I
saw you so clearly.

373
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,245
Fine.

374
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:43,851
Fine, yeah, you were in the
TV room of the big house

375
00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:46,988
and you had this blue, like,
right past the knees, dress.

376
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:49,590
Right, and you got it dirty,
which you got in trouble for.

377
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:51,592
And obviously that
made you so mad

378
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:55,228
and you were just
pretty, you know,

379
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:56,130
but it was more than that,

380
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:57,306
there was something
special about you.

381
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,365
Special?

382
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:58,966
I'm being serious Al,

383
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,901
there was something

384
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:01,011
important about you.
- Oh my God, Walker.

385
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:01,869
I could see it even then.

386
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:02,503
We were 12.

387
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:03,638
So.

388
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:05,448
So the only way that I
could have been special to you

389
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:06,974
is if I was made of candy.

390
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:09,019
I mean, when you're young
like that, you get crushes,

391
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:11,913
then they're just stupid
little, nothing crushes.

392
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:14,314
It's just that usually
people grow out of them.

393
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,993
The thing is that we were
idiots and we got married.

394
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:17,985
No, no, no, we were so happy.

395
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:20,320
No, you just saw
some girl in a dress

396
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,589
and came all over yourself,

397
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:23,500
like every other stupid
idiot boy in that place.

398
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:25,660
So by that thinking then
a bunch of boys liked you?

399
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:27,528
Yeah, sure, lucky me.

400
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:29,362
Yeah, well you chose me.

401
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,874
So whether you want
to admit it or not,

402
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,233
there was something that
you did like about me.

403
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,540
Or you were just the
first one that asked.

404
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:44,244
(gentle music)

405
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:48,381
Why do you act like
this just never worked?

406
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:52,385
Is this done?

407
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,622
I answered your
question, this is done.

408
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,655
Really?

409
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,392
(gentle music)

410
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:18,679
Hey, can we?

411
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:19,713
Al.

412
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:22,816
Albee.

413
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,856
(car engine revving)

414
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,491
(gentle music)

415
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,668
(birds chirping)

416
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:43,336
(gentle music)

417
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:50,111
Well what happened?

418
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:51,546
They weren't home.

419
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,948
Yeah, I thought I'd go
grab yourself from Joan.

420
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,092
Do you need anything from town?

421
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:56,416
Oh, just my dress.

422
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,418
And you are not seeing that.

423
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,353
[Ben] Okay, I'll be right back.

424
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,857
Don't go make any
new friends, okay.

425
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,526
(gentle music)

426
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:28,481
Hey, just me.

427
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:32,053
Oh, hey, sorry, I was
just checking this out

428
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:34,622
and you know, you might wanna.

429
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:39,727
You know, I noticed that you're

430
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,129
using framing
lumber for the deck

431
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:44,532
and you're gonna want
some thicker posts,

432
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:46,466
if you want to keep
this thing level.

433
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,769
And you're gonna need some
more materials as well.

434
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,539
When did you want
this thing done?

435
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:53,507
Oh, two weeks.

436
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:56,744
Oh, well, I can
help you if you want.

437
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:59,580
Just that this is
a bit of a mess.

438
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:02,482
It is?

439
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:03,516
Yeah.

440
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:07,955
No, of course you
don't need to do that.

441
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:09,633
It's not a problem,
it's a pretty easy job,

442
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:11,525
if you know what you're doing.

443
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:14,528
You don't say.

444
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:18,599
(birds chirping)

445
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:25,039
You're married, is
this just what it's like?

446
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,841
Oh, no, not yet.

447
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:29,644
I mean, that's what all
this is for, but no.

448
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:30,677
Oh.

449
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,515
She's not always like that.

450
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:35,683
We were good.

451
00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:37,450
You know, we were really
good at the start,

452
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:39,720
and then we weren't, she wasn't.

453
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:42,189
[Carly] Do you know why?

454
00:23:42,223 --> 00:23:45,559
I figured it's 'cause
she got to know me better.

455
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:47,460
She just had a tough
time growing up.

456
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,532
My parents were a
bit of a nightmare.

457
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:52,566
So I get that.

458
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:56,436
No, it was a foster home.

459
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,839
That's where we met.

460
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,676
Oh, so you lived together?

461
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:04,812
No, no, it was a group home.

462
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:06,914
She got adopted and yeah.

463
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:11,585
The guy that adopted her,

464
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,121
he's got a nice seat in
hell waiting for him.

465
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:18,725
Yeah.

466
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,228
What about you?

467
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:22,630
Are you happy?

468
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:27,500
I'm not dumb.

469
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:32,239
I told her I look after her,
I promised her I would, so,

470
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:33,273
I will.

471
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,611
(birds chirping)

472
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,055
(gentle music)

473
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:55,196
Morning Joan.

474
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:56,197
Hey.

475
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,874
Just grabbing some
lumber for the wedding.

476
00:24:57,898 --> 00:24:59,533
Oh cool, how's the build coming?

477
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,936
Oh, you know, I think
it's getting pretty close.

478
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:03,137
Awesome.

479
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,173
Then I guess you
have time for a beer.

480
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:26,293
Beer for breakfast.

481
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:27,828
You're having one.

482
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:29,163
It's Saturday.

483
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,765
Let's think of more reasons.

484
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:32,099
Okay.

485
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:34,235
Big weekend or something?

486
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,670
Something.

487
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:38,239
I'm Ben, by the way.

488
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:40,708
Ben, did I look
like I wanted to chat?

489
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:41,918
'Cause if so, I'll
change what I'm doing.

490
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:43,644
Hey, I'm happy to go.

491
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:45,913
It's just kind of early
for you to be hitting on me.

492
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:47,848
[Ben] No, you're not my type.

493
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:49,683
This is just me being friendly.

494
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:53,988
That is usually my experience
with older men and bars.

495
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:55,056
So friendly.

496
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:59,794
Okay, fine, maybe you
looked a little lonely.

497
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:01,362
Think you can fix it?

498
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:03,664
[Ben] So you're
flirting with me now.

499
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:06,100
This is just me being friendly.

500
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:11,572
(cellphone vibrating)

501
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,085
Hey Ben, will you
tell your fiance that

502
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:16,853
I'm done with the alterations.
I'll come by tomorrow.

503
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:18,679
[Ben] Thank you, Joan.

504
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:19,613
Get you anything else?

505
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:20,681
No, this is good.

506
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:22,850
You can put it on his tab.

507
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:29,723
Relax, she's
staying at the cabin.

508
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:34,628
(gentle upbeat music)

509
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,699
(birds chirping)

510
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:42,002
(gentle upbeat music)

511
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:47,108
Walker.

512
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:47,908
Hey.

513
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:48,742
What is this?

514
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:50,177
What's it look like?

515
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:51,254
You said we never have fun.

516
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,013
This is us having fun.

517
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:55,015
And I brought your favorite.

518
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,650
This is so you.

519
00:26:56,684 --> 00:26:57,985
Yeah it is.

520
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,329
All right, we're gonna
lift this thing on three.

521
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:00,154
You ready?

522
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:01,755
One, two, three.

523
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,391
Look at you muscles.

524
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:05,993
Yeah, actually I
could use some help.

525
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:07,261
Oh yeah.

526
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,738
You know, I think I'm
carrying this by myself.

527
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:09,296
Where should we
launch this, here?

528
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,731
Maybe over here?

529
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:11,732
I don't know, maybe
by the lake somewhere.

530
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,868
Yeah, it's starting
to get a little heavy.

531
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:15,936
Oh, you sure you don't
want me to push this out?

532
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,105
Hey, I'm from
Texas too, you know.

533
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:21,275
Walker, what is that?

534
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:25,012
Oh yeah, I thought we
could do a couple questions

535
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,814
while we were having fun.

536
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:29,783
Oh you did, you sly, sly boy.

537
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:31,285
Can't run away on a boat.

538
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,453
Oh no.

539
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:33,787
No, Albee.

540
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:34,755
Albee, Albee, Albee.

541
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:36,423
Yeah, well, have a nice trip.

542
00:27:36,457 --> 00:27:38,792
Okay baby, you know this
isn't gonna stop me.

543
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:40,227
I'm sorry, what?

544
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:41,896
What'd you say?
- All right, all right,

545
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:43,797
let's do it.

546
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,232
Here we are, question two.

547
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:48,235
"Start by thanking your
partner for their time."

548
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,470
I'll start.

549
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:51,338
Thank you Albee for
taking this time.

550
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:52,483
Yeah, you wanna say it back?

551
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:53,440
No, I'm good.

552
00:27:53,474 --> 00:27:55,809
All right, well, you know,

553
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:59,046
I heard that canoeing makes
the heart grow fonder.

554
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,848
Actually it's rowing.

555
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,883
Rowing makes the
heart grow fonder.

556
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:05,686
You look a little hungry.

557
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,321
Oh.

558
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,499
- What even is that?
- Oh, that's on me.

559
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:10,501
[Albee] I'm sorry, which
one of us played baseball.

560
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:11,801
All right, they're
bringing in the reliever.

561
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:12,726
Is your arm okay?

562
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,494
- Ready?
- What's going on?

563
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:14,828
(laughing)

564
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:15,796
What are you trying to kill me?

565
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,798
You gotta catch that.

566
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:19,466
She's calling for a fastball.

567
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,868
Oh, that was high and outside.

568
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:21,769
You can do better.

569
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:24,371
What are you gonna
throw walks all day?

570
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:27,509
(gentle upbeat music)

571
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:29,843
(birds chirping)

572
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:33,515
(gentle upbeat music)

573
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:35,449
You sure you don't
want to come out here?

574
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,119
You're on your own buddy.

575
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:42,389
(gentle upbeat music)

576
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:49,129
Yeah, that's right, bring it in.

577
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:53,100
Walker, where are you going?

578
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,836
[Walker] I got the
whole lake ahead of me.

579
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:56,870
Walker.

580
00:28:58,339 --> 00:28:59,339
Walker.

581
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:02,008
Walker.

582
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:06,514
(birds chirping)

583
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:09,950
(cellphone vibrating)

584
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:23,430
Hey, the cabin lady
came by the lake

585
00:29:23,464 --> 00:29:25,567
and invited us to
lunch, and I said, yes.

586
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Why?

587
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:29,446
Because what else
was I supposed to say?

588
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,470
Nothing.

589
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:32,806
[Ben] Why would you do that?

590
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,675
We talked about this.

591
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,577
Because it's the
right thing to do.

592
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,012
Also, it just kind
of slipped out.

593
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:42,082
Look, I had this really
awkward thing with her today.

594
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:43,317
What thing?

595
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,190
Oh, at the bar, just
kind of feeling her out.

596
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:46,420
What?

597
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,365
[Ben] Just see how much of
an asshole she was, you know?

598
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:49,390
Not really.

599
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:51,825
And don't call her that,
we don't even know her.

600
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,327
It wasn't weird.

601
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,904
I was just curious to see what
she was gonna do to this guy

602
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:56,930
to see if he could trust her.

603
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:57,964
That's all.

604
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:03,337
And here you're telling
me not to interfere.

605
00:30:04,938 --> 00:30:06,440
It's one lunch.

606
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,951
Besides I figured you
want me to make up

607
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:09,310
for being such a bitch
last night.

608
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:11,011
Sure, sounds good.

609
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:16,083
Look, we'll just eat quick

610
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:18,586
and we'll just get
'em outta here, yeah.

611
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,221
(gentle music)

612
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,193
(birds chirping)

613
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:27,861
Oh God, maybe
this was a mistake.

614
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:29,496
It was your idea.

615
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,366
Why are you being so weird?

616
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,501
Hi.

617
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:36,103
This is Ben.

618
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:38,005
Walker, Albee.

619
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:40,074
Nice to meet you.

620
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:41,275
Again.

621
00:30:41,308 --> 00:30:43,911
He told me he
met you, how funny?

622
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,980
Yeah, it's so funny,
he didn't mention you.

623
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:48,650
[Ben] Well, you
weren't exactly chatty.

624
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:50,217
Funny, you didn't
mention it either.

625
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,219
Because it wasn't
very memorable.

626
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:53,954
It's simple.

627
00:30:53,987 --> 00:30:55,533
Oh, that's not gluten free,
if that's still a thing.

628
00:30:55,557 --> 00:30:56,357
It looks good, Babe.

629
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,224
Wine?

630
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:58,158
I'll have some.

631
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:00,260
That's very friendly of you.

632
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:02,630
Walker, some wine?

633
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:03,897
You got anything stronger?

634
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,533
[Ben] Yeah, I do, be right back.

635
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,368
Stronger?

636
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:09,002
Like you said, it's a party.

637
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:10,204
Here you go man.

638
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:12,206
Cheers.
(glasses clinking)

639
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:16,443
[Albee] So, you guys
are getting married?

640
00:31:16,477 --> 00:31:17,478
[Ben] That's the plan.

641
00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:19,980
Oh, we're gonna do it
right here, actually,

642
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:21,649
if we can get the
altar finished in time.

643
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:22,617
[Ben] Well that's easy,

644
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,251
'cause I used to do
carpentry in L.A. so.

645
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:26,186
[Carly] He was in a
band, weren't you, Babe.

646
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:28,021
They were amazing.

647
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:29,022
[Albee] They were?

648
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,693
So what is here, anyway, camp?

649
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:34,428
[Carly] That's the plan,
yeah, a little summer camp.

650
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:36,664
You know, once we
get it fixed up.

651
00:31:36,698 --> 00:31:40,200
Oh, it was Ben's idea to use
it as an Airbnb first though.

652
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:41,612
[Albee] If you need to fix it,
Walker could help you.

653
00:31:41,636 --> 00:31:43,505
He loves broken shit.

654
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:48,442
(birds chirping)

655
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,082
What's going on?

656
00:31:55,115 --> 00:31:56,417
What?

657
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,051
Fuck you, what are you doing?

658
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:59,162
[Walker] Just eating lunch.

659
00:31:59,186 --> 00:32:01,030
By the way this pasta salad
is so good, thank you.

660
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:02,590
Okay, you're mad.

661
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:05,034
We were supposed to be
doing something else

662
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:06,469
and I changed the
plan, so he's upset.

663
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:08,037
I'm so sorry, I
didn't mean to intrude.

664
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:10,173
Oh no, don't apologize
please, it's completely fine.

665
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:12,299
You don't look fine,
Walker, you look mad, own it.

666
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:13,200
Maybe just leave him alone.

667
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:14,435
Baby, I thought honesty

668
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,069
was the point of
this weekend, right?

669
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,673
So just say
something, get angry.

670
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:23,043
It was a book, it's
some $5 piece of shit,

671
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:24,120
that's supposed
to make us happy.

672
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:26,313
It's called, "Seven
Questions to Grow a Spine."

673
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:27,346
Yep.

674
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:31,084
I'm sorry, he's just determined

675
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:33,020
to make me look like an asshole.

676
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:36,724
Okay, fine, we'll do the book.

677
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:38,067
I'm really sorry
about lunch, you guys.

678
00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:38,760
Let's go at Walker.

679
00:32:38,793 --> 00:32:39,993
I'm good.

680
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,472
Walker, I said we
could do the book.

681
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,231
Your point is made, let's go.

682
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:45,504
Maybe you're right, you know,

683
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,468
maybe they are just
seven dumb questions.

684
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:49,112
You know, I think
those books are great.

685
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:51,014
We did marriage classes
in the spring, right Ben?

686
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:52,239
Babe, no.

687
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:53,484
I know it can be uncomfortable,

688
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:54,785
but we found it to
be very helpful.

689
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:55,610
I'm sure you did.

690
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:57,110
Walker, let's go.

691
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,781
Well, we could always do
a few questions together

692
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:01,148
if that helps?

693
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:03,083
[Ben] Carly, no.

694
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:06,086
Look, it's clear that you
all are in a very hard place,

695
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,690
but maybe that's why you came
here so we could help you.

696
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:10,224
Maybe she's right.

697
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:11,535
Walker, you really wanna
do this in front of them?

698
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,527
Think about that.

699
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,128
You know me so well, do I?

700
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,001
Great, I'll grab the book.

701
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:29,452
Walker, hey, what the actual
fuck, why would you do that?

702
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:30,612
What?

703
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:32,523
You wanna hang, I wanna do
the book, perfect solution.

704
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:33,347
No, I did not come here,

705
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,047
so the Anne of
fucking Green Gables

706
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:34,348
would be our marriage counselor.

707
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:35,550
Why?

708
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,293
Well, I don't wanna embarrass
you in front of anyone.

709
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:38,318
Well, that's a first.

710
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:40,555
See, this is great, we're
already making progress.

711
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:48,328
Look, I get it, and
I love your concern,

712
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:50,063
but this isn't our place.

713
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:52,275
Well, I grew up learning to
help people when they need it.

714
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:54,702
She doesn't need your
help, she needs an exorcist.

715
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:56,136
Then he does.

716
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:57,805
And I disagree.

717
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,349
Do you know that they
were foster kids?

718
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:00,474
How could I know that?

719
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:02,309
Look, that's awful, I'm sorry.

720
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:03,611
It is awful.

721
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:05,085
He said she had a
terrible childhood,

722
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:07,447
which just makes so much sense.

723
00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:11,285
You know, people like
her, they're just scared.

724
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:15,088
No, Carly, no, she's not
scared, she's a fucking monster.

725
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:16,724
Believe me when I say this,

726
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:19,126
I dated girls like
her for 20 years.

727
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:24,566
I think it's the
right thing to do.

728
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,099
Well, I don't.

729
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:29,637
Then I'm asking you to
do this one thing for me.

730
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:31,471
It is that important.

731
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:37,745
Can you do that for me please?

732
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:40,881
Yeah.

733
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:44,752
(gentle music)

734
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:20,387
[Albee] Vape, neat.

735
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,923
You know, all the
kids are doing it.

736
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:23,758
Yeah, you gotta let that kid go.

737
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,793
Just fucking end it.

738
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:27,160
[Albee] Good chat.

739
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:28,505
Listen, I'm gonna be nice to you

740
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:30,230
because Carly wants me to be,

741
00:35:30,263 --> 00:35:32,175
but I just want you to know
you're a fucking asshole.

742
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,802
Seriously, this whole, "Mean
Girl" bullshit is tacky.

743
00:35:34,836 --> 00:35:36,303
Yeah, well coming from the guy

744
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:37,848
who looks like a backup
singer for Lenny Kravitz,

745
00:35:37,872 --> 00:35:38,673
I think I'll live.

746
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:39,907
Fuck you.

747
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:41,701
By the way, I also
think you're an asshole.

748
00:35:50,985 --> 00:35:54,221
(birds chirping)

749
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:06,266
Do I just start?

750
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:06,968
[Ben] What are we doing?

751
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:10,270
Just one question please, Ben.

752
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:12,607
Okay, so, it says, "The
goal of this question

753
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,207
"is to clear old wounds that.

754
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:17,210
(cellphone vibrating)

755
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:19,614
"To clear old wounds
that might have become."

756
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:21,314
(cellphone vibrating)

757
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,315
Do you wanna get that?

758
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:23,885
No, that would be rude.

759
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:24,786
But I will do the
reading for you, Babe,

760
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:27,622
that was never really
your strong suit.

761
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:29,657
So, skip that,

762
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:33,293
"Looking at your partner,
tell them the first time

763
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:35,295
"you felt wounded by them."

764
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:38,231
Wounded, oh, another winner.

765
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:40,300
Wounded anyone?

766
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,302
Well, why don't we go first?

767
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:44,539
Why are we doing this?

768
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:49,242
Okay, fine, fine.

769
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,319
[Carly] I can go
first if you want.

770
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:51,311
No, you don't have to go first.

771
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:51,913
Can somebody go?

772
00:36:51,946 --> 00:36:53,380
Okay, I got it, okay.

773
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:55,414
All right.

774
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:57,661
Remember that table
I made for you,

775
00:36:57,685 --> 00:36:58,485
like a couple months in?

776
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,554
[Carly] The side table?

777
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:01,656
Yeah, it was like the
first thing I made you.

778
00:37:01,689 --> 00:37:03,390
And it's kind of dumb,

779
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:05,660
but when I gave it
to you, you laughed.

780
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:08,328
I don't remember that.

781
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:09,396
I love that table.

782
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:11,041
[Ben] Yeah to put that
fucking doily thing on it.

783
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:12,734
Maybe, I wouldn't
pick it out myself,

784
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:15,670
but hey, I love it now.

785
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,238
I don't know why
this bothering me.

786
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,241
It's because you cared.

787
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,014
Yeah, I had no idea.

788
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:29,249
Well, this is a
good fucking book.

789
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,553
Okay wait, she laughed
at your woodwork,

790
00:37:32,587 --> 00:37:34,055
are you fucking kidding me?

791
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,355
It was important to him.

792
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:36,057
It's woodwork.

793
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,625
What are you six?

794
00:37:37,658 --> 00:37:39,302
[Ben] Well, I'm sorry we're
not as miserable as you.

795
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:40,504
Seems like you're halfway there.

796
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:42,405
God, like what is hers gonna
be, that you don't recycle?

797
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:43,765
I thought we were fucked up.

798
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:45,365
Look, I appreciate the honesty.

799
00:37:45,398 --> 00:37:46,333
I told you, Babe.

800
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:48,069
That was not honesty,
that was bullshit.

801
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:49,637
Okay, people hurt each other.

802
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,404
Yeah, well not
everybody clearly.

803
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,783
Okay, fine, people who love
each other hurt each other.

804
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:53,641
How about that?

805
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:54,842
How does he hurt you?

806
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:56,053
[Ben] And you want us to believe

807
00:37:56,077 --> 00:37:56,911
that you are in
love with him, yeah?

808
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:57,955
Hey, do you think
she'd be wounded,

809
00:37:57,979 --> 00:37:59,781
if I told her how you
hit on me this morning?

810
00:37:59,814 --> 00:38:01,816
Nice try, I already
told her I spoke to you.

811
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:02,382
And you know what?

812
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:03,584
I wasn't hitting on you,

813
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:05,428
I was feeling you had to see
if you were cheating on him.

814
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:06,654
You bought that?

815
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:07,822
Good for you.

816
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:09,389
Yeah, she did
because we have trust,

817
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:10,868
something you wouldn't
fucking understand.

818
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:12,093
Calm down.

819
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:14,427
Yeah, Ben, what's
got you riled up.

820
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,330
Actually, I wanna talk to
the fiance for a second.

821
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:19,801
You trust him?

822
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:22,069
Yes, 100%, that's
why I'm marrying him.

823
00:38:22,103 --> 00:38:23,403
Really?

824
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:24,939
I mean, he's a good looking guy,

825
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:26,349
that must have been a real
catch for a girl like you.

826
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:27,518
Don't you talk to her like that.

827
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:29,677
The kind of guy that you
overlooked some issues for,

828
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,112
you know what I mean?

829
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:33,080
You're just being mean.

830
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:34,949
It makes you wonder
though, doesn't it?

831
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:35,883
What about me, Albee?

832
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,084
[Albee] What about you?

833
00:38:37,118 --> 00:38:38,495
What's the worst
thing ever did to you?

834
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,419
It's easy, you're a liar.

835
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:40,555
It's what I hate about you.

836
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:41,421
You're lying right now.

837
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:42,422
What?

838
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:43,090
You can't do that

839
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:43,991
I don't lie.

840
00:38:44,025 --> 00:38:45,065
How can you even say that?

841
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:47,094
It's my question,
I don't need to explain it.

842
00:38:47,128 --> 00:38:48,437
[Ben] You know
what your problem is?

843
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:49,864
Oh, please enlighten us.

844
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:51,966
Everything is a compromise.

845
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,902
You don't realize that no
one gets what they want.

846
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:56,436
Maybe you don't.

847
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:57,781
Don't change the
subject, just answer me.

848
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:58,906
Okay, fine.

849
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,009
I'll answer you by doing
yours for you, how about that?

850
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:06,514
So when could I possibly
have hurt Walker?

851
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:08,015
Oh, I've got one.

852
00:39:08,616 --> 00:39:10,151
It was our honeymoon.

853
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:12,119
You remember that, right Walker?

854
00:39:12,153 --> 00:39:15,990
You took me to that shitty
motel in beautiful Jersey.

855
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:18,491
This was the one time in my life

856
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:21,596
that I was maybe interested
in the idea of sex.

857
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:25,398
And Walker here had a problem
rising to the challenge.

858
00:39:25,432 --> 00:39:26,466
So what did I do?

859
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:29,469
Did I kiss him and
make it better?

860
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:30,972
Did I work him up?

861
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:33,875
No.

862
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:35,877
I made him cry.

863
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,144
Isn't that right, Walk?

864
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:38,522
He probably had
too much to drink.

865
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:39,412
It happens all the time.

866
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:40,548
Sure does.

867
00:39:40,581 --> 00:39:41,782
That's not the point.

868
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:43,084
I'm cruel and I know it.

869
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:45,052
So how does that
make him a liar, huh?

870
00:39:45,086 --> 00:39:46,020
You're crazy.

871
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:47,755
Because he's sitting
here married to me,

872
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:49,156
acting like I'm not.

873
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,057
Why?

874
00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:51,826
Because I love you Albee.

875
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:53,493
There it is.

876
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:54,795
You can't Walker.

877
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:56,206
You might think you
do, but you don't.

878
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,198
[Carly] Pretty sure he does.

879
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:58,498
Oh, thanks cabin lady.

880
00:39:58,532 --> 00:39:59,432
We've known you for what?

881
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:00,167
Three hours.
- What are you

882
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:01,501
talking about Albee?

883
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:03,971
Everything I do is
for you, everything.

884
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:05,640
I moved to L.A. for you.

885
00:40:05,673 --> 00:40:07,775
Okay, that's for us
because I love you.

886
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:09,176
How can you even say that?

887
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,320
Look at you, you're so mad,

888
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:11,989
you look like you wanna put
your hand through a wall.

889
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:12,780
But what are you gonna do?

890
00:40:12,813 --> 00:40:13,748
Nothing.

891
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:15,092
You're just gonna tell
me that you love me

892
00:40:15,116 --> 00:40:16,217
when you should hate me.

893
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,251
God fucking dammit,

894
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:19,452
would you just turn this
stupid piece of shit off?

895
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:20,788
Or what?
You'll cry.

896
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:22,455
What is wrong with you?

897
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:23,758
I warned you.

898
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:28,696
Fuck it, last question.

899
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:29,830
[Albee] Shoot.

900
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:31,799
Did you ever love me or is this

901
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:32,943
just so you could get away from?

902
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:34,168
Don't, Walker.

903
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:36,737
Then fucking answer me.

904
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:38,749
Fine, did I come here thinking

905
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:41,676
that fucking a plate of cheese
and a book is gonna fix this?

906
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:43,544
No, idiot, I didn't.

907
00:40:43,577 --> 00:40:46,446
(gentle music)

908
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:52,118
Walker.

909
00:40:53,054 --> 00:40:55,957
(gentle music)

910
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,757
Fuck.

911
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:57,692
Walker.

912
00:40:57,725 --> 00:40:59,160
Walker, no.

913
00:40:59,193 --> 00:41:01,162
Walker, don't you dare.

914
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:02,630
I swear to God.

915
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:05,766
Oh my God.

916
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,570
What did you do?

917
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:11,572
What I should've done
eight goddamn years ago.

918
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:13,975
I didn't have a phone
eight years ago, asshole.

919
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:15,009
Are you crying?

920
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:17,645
No, you owe me a new phone.

921
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:18,722
What the fuck, you're
crying over a phone?

922
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:19,580
Fuck you.

923
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:21,749
Were you ever gonna
try to fix this?

924
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:22,926
Huh, did you have any
intention of trying

925
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,885
to make this better?
- No, never.

926
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:26,620
I don't know if
that makes you happy

927
00:41:26,654 --> 00:41:28,789
or I don't know what you
thought was gonna happen.

928
00:41:28,823 --> 00:41:30,157
Do you love me, Albee?

929
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:33,694
(gentle music)

930
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,665
Did you ever even like me?

931
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,969
Actually, I asked you answered.

932
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,607
- Walker.
- Go.

933
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,510
(gentle music)

934
00:41:53,914 --> 00:41:56,217
I need you to stop
saying that, okay.

935
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,152
Because I know that.

936
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:00,063
[Ben] Could you please
stop cleaning for one second?

937
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:04,625
I can put things away
and talk at the same time.

938
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:07,328
I did not mean for
things to go this way.

939
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:09,230
[Ben] Yeah, I know
but I told you.

940
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:10,698
I warned you.

941
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:13,100
Okay, I get it, you
know that kind of girl.

942
00:42:13,134 --> 00:42:15,970
Well, I know that kind of
boy and I felt bad for him.

943
00:42:16,003 --> 00:42:19,040
Honey, I love you, I do, okay.

944
00:42:19,073 --> 00:42:22,243
But this whole saving
people bullshit, it's just.

945
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:25,946
Okay, I'm sorry, forget it.

946
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,649
I'm just gonna go
get some work done.

947
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:30,651
What a nice idea.

948
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:33,554

Hey, you beat me to it.

982
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:43,964
I got the croissants
that you like.

983
00:47:43,997 --> 00:47:45,032
Thanks.

984
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:47,000
This is for the guests.

985
00:47:48,135 --> 00:47:49,537
[Ben] That's optimistic.

986
00:47:50,672 --> 00:47:52,873
Hey, are we okay?

987
00:47:53,407 --> 00:47:55,209
Yeah, I'm tired.

988
00:47:56,343 --> 00:47:59,380
Look, I know you were
trying to do a good thing.

989
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:00,347
And I was being a dick.

990
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:04,118
I was saying things
that I didn't even mean.

991
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:06,521
Okay, I'm gonna be better.

992
00:48:06,554 --> 00:48:07,554
I love you.

993
00:48:11,693 --> 00:48:13,394
I love you too.

994
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:15,996
Joan is coming over
later to fit the dress.

995
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:17,398
So you need to be
out of the house.

996
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:18,633
Okay.

997
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:21,569
I'll just hop in the shower
and I'll go work on the deck.

998
00:48:22,704 --> 00:48:23,704
Okay.

999
00:48:36,984 --> 00:48:39,920
(door knocking)

1000
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:50,464
[Carly] Hey guys, breakfast.

1001
00:49:05,078 --> 00:49:06,346
Have you seen Walker?

1002
00:49:07,347 --> 00:49:08,982
He didn't come home?

1003
00:49:09,016 --> 00:49:10,050
I hoped that...

1004
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,385
We'd break up.

1005
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:13,521
'Cause that's what happened.

1006
00:49:13,555 --> 00:49:15,623
God, Albee, I'm so sorry.

1007
00:49:15,657 --> 00:49:16,657
Don't be.

1008
00:49:17,759 --> 00:49:19,092
It doesn't mean
anything, anyway.

1009
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:20,360
What time is checkout?

1010
00:49:20,394 --> 00:49:22,429
- Three, but.
- Okay, great.

1011
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:27,100
(gentle music)

1012
00:50:44,646 --> 00:50:45,613
Shit.

1013
00:50:45,647 --> 00:50:48,315
(gentle music)

1014
00:51:02,195 --> 00:51:04,331
I'm working tonight,
if you wanna come down.

1015
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:07,702
Joan, is it ugly?

1016
00:51:07,735 --> 00:51:08,803
What?

1017
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:10,304
No, it's Mom's dress.

1018
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:11,447
You wanted to wear
this for 30 years.

1019
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:12,707
I know.

1020
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,851
Okay, I promise you
get the fit, right.

1021
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:16,443
No, it's not that I just.

1022
00:51:16,476 --> 00:51:18,478
Can I ask you something?

1023
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:23,818
Is this a good idea?

1024
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,522
I'm really asking.

1025
00:51:27,555 --> 00:51:28,790
I want you to be honest.

1026
00:51:28,823 --> 00:51:29,900
I realize I never
asked you before.

1027
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:33,193
And then I just started thinking

1028
00:51:33,226 --> 00:51:35,663
like maybe I never asked myself.

1029
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:39,499
All right, well
you're not a fucking idiot.

1030
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:41,669
Two like caveats,

1031
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:44,906
A, I know shit all
about dating men, so.

1032
00:51:44,939 --> 00:51:47,274
I knew there was a
reason I never asked you.

1033
00:51:47,307 --> 00:51:48,509
Exactly.

1034
00:51:48,543 --> 00:51:51,111
Does he make you happy?

1035
00:51:51,913 --> 00:51:53,548
That's all that really matters.

1036
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:55,650
I think so.

1037
00:51:57,518 --> 00:51:59,219
But if I'm being honest,

1038
00:51:59,252 --> 00:52:00,387
really honest,

1039
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:02,890
I don't know.

1040
00:52:02,924 --> 00:52:04,391
It's not like this clean thing.

1041
00:52:04,424 --> 00:52:06,493
The boy, the one
who's staying here,

1042
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,162
I think he would literally
die for his wife.

1043
00:52:09,196 --> 00:52:10,306
Okay, well that's just sad.

1044
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:11,566
Is it?

1045
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,233
Ben won't even finish the altar.

1046
00:52:13,266 --> 00:52:15,302
It's been weeks
and it is literally

1047
00:52:15,335 --> 00:52:16,938
the place we're
supposed to stand

1048
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:21,776
and say our vows to each other
and he just won't finish it.

1049
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:22,809
He won't.

1050
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:26,681
Well, what did you expect?

1051
00:52:26,714 --> 00:52:28,816
I'm not being mean, but
he's kind of a fuck boy.

1052
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,652
How is that not mean?

1053
00:52:30,685 --> 00:52:32,319
Okay, Cinderella.

1054
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:36,658
I'm just saying that he's
an ex musician from L.A.

1055
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:38,960
who ran away to the woods.

1056
00:52:38,993 --> 00:52:41,529
Are you really surprised
he's not a grownup yet?

1057
00:52:41,562 --> 00:52:44,832
I'm not saying he won't be, but.

1058
00:52:46,734 --> 00:52:47,734
Right.

1059
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:51,371
You did say be honest.

1060
00:52:53,608 --> 00:52:56,376
(birds chirping)

1061
00:53:25,272 --> 00:53:27,307
(Ben laughing)

1062
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,340
Hey man.

1063
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,612
[Walker] Hey,
sorry, I just kind of.

1064
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:32,890
Finished the
whole fucking thing.

1065
00:53:32,914 --> 00:53:33,914
[Walker] Yeah.

1066
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:38,318
Shit, hey, did Carly see this?

1067
00:53:38,351 --> 00:53:40,822
I haven't really seen anyone.

1068
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:45,560
What, did you run away
from home or something?

1069
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:49,396
It's over between Albee and me.

1070
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:51,364
I finished it or she did.

1071
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:53,500
Maybe we both did,
I don't really know.

1072
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:56,604
Holy shit, like it's done, done?

1073
00:53:56,637 --> 00:53:57,637
Yep.

1074
00:53:58,305 --> 00:53:59,774
Hey, you know what that is?

1075
00:53:59,807 --> 00:54:01,475
That is great fucking news.

1076
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:03,020
You know what great
fucking news needs.

1077
00:54:03,044 --> 00:54:04,044
Ah.

1078
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,052
Hey, come on.

1079
00:54:11,085 --> 00:54:13,353
You're a younger looking kid,
you're not gonna be lonely.

1080
00:54:13,386 --> 00:54:14,555
All right, trust me.

1081
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:16,423
Shit, I almost envy you.

1082
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:19,794
(birds chirping)

1083
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,366
Hey, you know,
I saw that you guys

1084
00:54:26,399 --> 00:54:28,311
have some work that needs
to get done around here,

1085
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:30,080
you know, some stuff for
the wedding and whatnot,

1086
00:54:30,104 --> 00:54:30,972
I thought maybe I could.

1087
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:32,640
[Ben] What are you
looking for a job?

1088
00:54:32,673 --> 00:54:34,542
More a place to stay.

1089
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,579
Dude, if you tell Carly
that I built this thing.

1090
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:40,524
You can stay here for
the rest of your fucking life.

1091
00:54:40,548 --> 00:54:41,983
I mean, you're
out of the Airbnb,

1092
00:54:42,016 --> 00:54:43,794
but you can stay at the
shit cabin that we have.

1093
00:54:43,818 --> 00:54:44,986
I don't care.

1094
00:54:45,019 --> 00:54:48,055
Look, trust me,
I know it sucks right now,

1095
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:50,758
but this is the best day
of your fucking life.

1096
00:54:51,424 --> 00:54:54,294
(birds chirping)

1097
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,573
Hey, that was a real dick
move of you to not come home.

1098
00:55:29,597 --> 00:55:31,866
Well, I didn't wanna see you.

1099
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,509
People don't run not
to be chased, Walker.

1100
00:55:41,542 --> 00:55:42,743
I should know.

1101
00:55:44,145 --> 00:55:45,445
We can't end like that.

1102
00:55:45,478 --> 00:55:46,747
[Walker] Why not?

1103
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:48,158
Because we didn't even
do your stupid book.

1104
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:50,350
We still can, if you want to.

1105
00:55:53,888 --> 00:55:55,723
Hey, I read your notes.

1106
00:55:55,756 --> 00:55:56,891
I get it now.

1107
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:00,161
Okay, so what, that's it,

1108
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:03,430
one stupid fight and it's done?

1109
00:56:03,764 --> 00:56:04,665
Al.

1110
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:06,634
Walker, you threw
my phone in a lake.

1111
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,011
I got mad, you can't
hate me for that.

1112
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:11,471
I don't hate you
Albee, you know that.

1113
00:56:11,505 --> 00:56:13,174
I'm embarrassed, you know.

1114
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:16,177
I've been telling you this
whole time to be honest

1115
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,210
and you were.

1116
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:20,480
You know, it was me
who wasn't listening,

1117
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:24,051
but I get it now, and it's okay.

1118
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,557
It fucking, it's okay.

1119
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:43,603
You should go.

1120
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:46,107
I want you to.

1121
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,675
What about you?

1122
00:56:48,075 --> 00:56:50,645
I'm gonna stay here at the camp.

1123
00:56:50,678 --> 00:56:51,913
Yeah.

1124
00:56:51,946 --> 00:56:53,590
Okay, maybe Hansel and
Gretel will adopt you.

1125
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:55,448
I'm serious, Al.

1126
00:56:55,482 --> 00:56:57,952
[Albee] Walker, no,
what about the car?

1127
00:56:57,985 --> 00:56:58,985
Take it.

1128
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:02,422
All your stuff is in L.A.

1129
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:05,593
It's yours, you could
sell it if you want,

1130
00:57:05,626 --> 00:57:07,094
I don't really care.

1131
00:57:08,129 --> 00:57:10,531
I'll help you pay rent as
long as you need me to.

1132
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:12,967
Can we just please not turn
this into another fight?

1133
00:57:15,703 --> 00:57:17,605
Look, you're gonna be good.

1134
00:57:17,638 --> 00:57:19,149
You're gonna be better than
good, you're gonna be great.

1135
00:57:19,173 --> 00:57:20,173
You're you.

1136
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:26,847
God, of course,
you're fucking nice.

Hey.

1154
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:22,730
Hi.

1155
00:59:24,632 --> 00:59:27,968
I was on my way out of town
and I found these in my car.

1156
00:59:29,036 --> 00:59:30,938
Walker needs them.

1157
00:59:30,971 --> 00:59:32,840
He forgets to take
them all the time,

1158
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:35,376
but he gets really
sick if he doesn't so.

1159
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:36,644
Okay.

1160
00:59:38,312 --> 00:59:41,082
Hey, are you all right?

1161
00:59:41,115 --> 00:59:42,716
I heard that.

1162
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,386
Oh, I'm sure you guys
think this is great.

1163
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:47,822
No, I truly just wanted to help.

1164
00:59:47,855 --> 00:59:52,126
Look, you hated me from
the moment you saw me

1165
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:55,162
and I don't think
you were wrong too.

1166
00:59:56,063 --> 00:59:56,964
Can I be honest?

1167
00:59:56,997 --> 00:59:58,241
Let's don't do this right now.

1168
00:59:58,265 --> 00:59:59,233
Go ahead.

1169
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:01,368
I know you had a rough
time growing up, okay.

1170
01:00:01,402 --> 01:00:03,237
And that kinda shit
can leave a mark.

1171
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,438
What?

1172
01:00:04,472 --> 01:00:07,341
[Ben] The foster thing, it
sounded awful and I'm sorry.

1173
01:00:08,209 --> 01:00:09,677
He told you?

1174
01:00:10,177 --> 01:00:11,779
All right, what
we're trying to say is,

1175
01:00:11,812 --> 01:00:15,416
we know that the foster
system isn't great.

1176
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:16,917
Oh, what the fuck?

1177
01:00:16,951 --> 01:00:18,719
Walker just told
me a little bit.

1178
01:00:18,752 --> 01:00:19,854
Oh, fuck you, he did.

1179
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:22,123
He was just trying to
explain to me what happened

1180
01:00:22,156 --> 01:00:23,324
between you guys.

1181
01:00:23,357 --> 01:00:24,859
Look I hope that.
- No, no, no.

1182
01:00:24,892 --> 01:00:30,064
Like you're just some like
hermit lady in the woods

1183
01:00:30,097 --> 01:00:33,934
with a fucking bullshit
fiance, all right.

1184
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:36,036
I don't know what he told you,

1185
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,906
but you don't fucking
know shit about me.

1186
01:00:44,345 --> 01:00:45,946
I'll be right back.

1187

Oh, hey, sorry.

1192
01:01:24,818 --> 01:01:27,021
I'm just getting my
final stuff outta here.

1193
01:01:27,755 --> 01:01:29,490
[Carly] Walker,
listen, I'm so sorry.

1194
01:01:29,524 --> 01:01:32,059
I think I really messed up.

1195
01:01:32,092 --> 01:01:35,829
I told Albee what you said
about the foster thing.

1196
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:37,965
I was just trying to help.
- Did you?

1197
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:39,533
Yeah.

1198
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:45,004
Shit.

1199
01:01:46,173 --> 01:01:47,341
Do you know where she is?

1200
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:48,486
I don't know,
she just drove off.

1201
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:49,376
I'm so sorry.

1202
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:50,978
No, it's not your fault.

1203
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,114
Fuck.

1204
01:01:54,148 --> 01:01:55,883
Are there any buses in town?

1205
01:01:55,916 --> 01:01:56,951
I gotta get back to L.A.

1206
01:01:56,984 --> 01:01:58,520

The day that we met,

1414
01:15:43,077 --> 01:15:44,979
you were wearing a hat.

1415
01:15:46,847 --> 01:15:50,651
And it was just
like neon yellow,

1416
01:15:50,684 --> 01:15:51,828
like they was scared
you were gonna

1417
01:15:51,852 --> 01:15:54,922
run into traffic or something.

1418
01:15:54,955 --> 01:15:56,657
And I had just gotten in trouble

1419
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:58,926
for not wanting to
play with anyone.

1420
01:15:58,959 --> 01:16:00,294
Very surprising.

1421
01:16:03,097 --> 01:16:07,001
And I dunno, you came in and
you just sat down with me

1422
01:16:07,034 --> 01:16:08,078
and then you took your hat off

1423
01:16:08,102 --> 01:16:10,371
and it looked like you fucking

1424
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:12,339
cut your hair with a
lawn mower or something.

1425
01:16:12,373 --> 01:16:16,110
And all the other kids
started making fun of you

1426
01:16:16,143 --> 01:16:18,712
and you didn't care.

1427
01:16:20,648 --> 01:16:24,819
You didn't care at all,
you just talked with me

1428
01:16:24,852 --> 01:16:27,588
like we were old
friends or something.

1429
01:16:29,857 --> 01:16:33,694
That was the first thing
that I liked about you.

1430
01:16:33,727 --> 01:16:36,263
You didn't run
away from anything.

1431
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:43,871
So if you're gonna go, please
take that story with you,

1432
01:16:43,904 --> 01:16:47,775
and not the one that I
said, because I lied.

1433
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:54,148
Okay, Walker, you're not
too weak or too nice.

1434
01:16:55,182 --> 01:16:57,885
I mean, you're not perfect, but,

1435
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:03,858
I don't know, it's
like all this time,

1436
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:08,329
I've just needed you to
see the ugliness in me.

1437
01:17:08,362 --> 01:17:12,766
Because what if you don't
and then I believe you

1438
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,836
and I let go, and
then you see me.

1439
01:17:17,037 --> 01:17:18,739
I'm not saying that
it makes sense,

1440
01:17:18,772 --> 01:17:21,876
but I swear, it's like
the minute that you left,

1441
01:17:21,909 --> 01:17:25,346
I understood, like I fucking
woke up or something.

1442
01:17:25,379 --> 01:17:29,683
And could you please
say something?

1443
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:40,294
Walker you wanted me
to be honest and talk,

1444
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:42,763
and now I am, and I
don't know what to say

1445
01:17:42,796 --> 01:17:45,432
because you're the only person
that I've ever been close to.

1446
01:17:45,466 --> 01:17:49,937
And I know that I'm shitty
at it, but God, I love you.

1447
01:17:51,739 --> 01:17:53,841
I love you so much.

1448
01:17:53,874 --> 01:17:56,810

1449
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,084
