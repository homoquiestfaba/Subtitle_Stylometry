And it was county jail.

176
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:05,467
The whole thing was bogus.

177
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,701
That is nothing
to be ashamed of.

178
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:09,404
I think it's important to get
a little roughed up by life.

179
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:11,206
Get some perspective.
It's my philosophy.

180
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,375
Your philosophy sucks.

182
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:23,086
How come it smells like
those, uh, little cheap,

183
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:25,754
you know, pine tree
air-freshener things?

SAMMY:
Jesus Christ, it's awful, right?

185
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:30,158
I keep telling Eddie, "You
gotta get rid of that crap."

186
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:31,092
Eddie's my brother.

187
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:33,061
I'm covering for him
with the cab today.

188
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:35,064
- CASPER: That's Eddie?
- SAMMY: Yeah. Hey. Ha, ha.

189
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:36,231
This is his cab.

190
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:37,199
Usually, I drive a sedan.

191
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:40,937
Eddie's getting laser eye
surgery. Finally.

192
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,339
Getting in a cab with this guy
is like a death wish.

193
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:44,873
[LAUGHS]

194
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:46,876
Anyway, I gotta switch out
this ID though

195
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:47,909
because I can't show them

196
00:09:47,943 --> 00:09:50,245
from the cops, when driving
a cab's a racket.

197
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:53,416
SAMMY: Some days, I wake up
and wanna be in a new business.

198
00:09:53,982 --> 00:09:57,319
Instead of being in this hot box
all damn day, breaking my back.

199
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:59,054
This guy's cool,
but as a general rule,

200
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:01,289
always make sure the cabby
is the same in the picture.

201
00:10:01,322 --> 00:10:03,091
That's true.
Watch out for gypsy cabbies.

202
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,227
Someone unregistered cabs
do all kinds of shit.

203
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,528
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

204
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:08,364
I know some drivers
who pick up a tourist,

205
00:10:08,397 --> 00:10:11,033
take him for half-an-hour drive
and then gonna go four blocks.

206
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:12,134
Like a tour in the city.

207
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:15,204
Oh, better a tour in a city
than a millionaire tour.

208
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,805
I don't know that.

209
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,108
Ever heard
of the millionaire tour?

210
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:20,009
No.

211
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:21,244
- Ooh.
- Ooh, that's bad.

212
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:22,211
Yeah?

213
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:24,246
Starts down at Mexico,
Puerto Rico, Brazil.

214
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,548
They're doing that locally now.

215
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:26,949
Get to the juicy part.

216
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:28,483
Some guys hang out
at the airport.

217
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:30,153
They wait for a cab driver
to pick up

218
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:31,387
somebody that looks rich.

219
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:33,488
And so they pull a gun
on Richie Rich

220
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:35,825
and they took him
and the cabby for a ride.

221
00:10:35,857 --> 00:10:37,993
They stop at every ATM
on the way.

222
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:40,363
Make the guy to draw cash
from credit cards, debit cards,

223
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:42,230
everything
until he gets declined.

224
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:44,399
Squeezed the life out
of the poor bastard.

225
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:46,970
Now, this guy's got no mercy,
but they got time.

226
00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:51,140
You hear about this thing?

227
00:10:52,106 --> 00:10:54,177
Hmm? Yeah,
I heard about things like that.

228
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,945
I know it's called
the millionaire tour.

229
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:57,179
- Millionaire tour, yeah.
- Huh.

230
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:58,915
And it's here in town?

231
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:00,182
- Yeah.
- SAMMY: In the city?

232
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:03,852
Well, that's great. I thought
you guys are from out of town.

233
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:05,288
We go back and forth for work.

234
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:06,889
We wouldn't have
to travel so much

235
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:08,157
if the economy weren't fucked.

236
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,193
Oh, what is it with you
and the fucking economy?

237
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:11,827
What did the economy
ever do to you?

238
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,361
Nothing.
That's the point right there.

239
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:15,096
SAMMY:
Yeah, I get that shit.

240
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:17,332
Yeah, you know, I'm just tired
of being pushed around,

241
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:18,400
working for the man.

242
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,569
And if I had my own cash,
I wouldn't even be here.

243
00:11:20,602 --> 00:11:23,138
I'd be my own boss.
Like this guy.

244
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:25,975
This guy? What do you
have against this guy?

245
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:27,310
What did he ever do to you, huh?

246
00:11:27,342 --> 00:11:29,245
BILLIE: Nothing.
I just feel like I know him.

247
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:30,947
Fancy suit, fancy watch.

248
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,348
The people got no respect
for somebody

249
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:34,883
that doesn't make
a lot of money.

250
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,452
You have no idea who I am
and you talk too much.

251
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:40,056
Oh, yeah?
So how much do you earn a year?

252
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:41,324
None of your fucking business.

253
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:42,858
Oh, that fucking much, huh?

254
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:44,493
Come on, man.
He said, Waterfront Plaza.

255
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:46,995
You know what, ahem,
forget about the plaza.

256
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:48,498
Get off here
and, uh, drop me off.

257
00:11:49,163 --> 00:11:50,499
- What?
- GREG: I'm getting out.

258
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:51,634
I've had enough.

259
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,168
Come on, man.
We're just talking.

260
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:54,503
Ah, he wants to get out.
Let him.

261
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:56,504
- Am I getting off this exit?
- Yes. Right here.

262
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:57,639
All right.

263
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:58,975

264
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:00,408
I stepped into the wrong cab.

265
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:01,644
Yeah, you sure did.

266
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:04,180
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

267
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:06,048
- Hands on the wheel.
- Okay, take it easy.

268
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:07,483
- No stopping.
- What are you doing?

269
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:08,650
What do you want from me?

270
00:12:08,683 --> 00:12:10,318
I wanna get to know you
a bit better.

271
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:11,453
Gregory Jane Newman,

272
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:14,189
426 Pine Drive
Santa Rosa, California.

273
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:17,293
Ooh, thank God you got rid
of that mustache, dude.

274
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:18,628
It's a little
presumptuous of you

275
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,929
to give other people
fashion advice, sexy.

276
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,932
Oh, that's you?
That's disgusting.

277
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,100
She's right.

278
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:27,336
Take the money. If that's
what you want, just take it.

279
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:29,372
Of, thank you. That's very
generous of you, man.

280
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:31,374
Yeah, but he's generous
with a gun in their face.

281
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,343
Hey, hands on the wheel
or brains on the windshield.

282
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:36,978
- Your call.
- SAMMY: All right.

283
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:40,415
- Count them.
- Tss, nada. Fifty-two bucks.

284
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:42,550
And it's barely enough
for the ride.

285
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,586
I guess we're gonna have
to stop at an ATM.

286
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,221
Give me your cell phone.

287
00:12:46,254 --> 00:12:47,623
- Give me your phone.
- All right.

288
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:50,058
Hurry up.
It's not a fucking game.

289
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:55,998
- Got his intention.
- CASPER: Thank you.

290
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,267
Like I said, we need to make a
withdrawal from your account.

291
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:00,503
Your account.

292
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:02,070
Why are you doing this?

293
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:04,240
We will get to the why,
we have a long ride ahead.

294
00:13:04,273 --> 00:13:05,641
Now let's first focus
on the how.

295
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:07,442
Here's what we're gonna do:
go to an ATM

296
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,345
and you're gonna withdraw
the maximum amount

297
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,047
from your credit
and debit cards.

298
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,548
$400 at most ATMs.

299
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:14,383
You've got my wallet.
You've got my cards.

300
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,518
Why do you need me?

301
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:16,719
Good question.
The guy's smart.

302
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:19,322
You see, we don't want our faces
to end up on <i>Dateline</i>

304
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,324
We're not that photogenic.

Huh, speak for yourself, sexy.

306
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:25,661
Are you done?
Can we get started?

308
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:29,664
We didn't even tell Greg the
most important part of the tour.

309
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:31,668
- Which part?
- The getting shot part.

310
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:34,669
Oh, yeah. That's the part
that people always fuck up.

311
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:37,605
Okay, so, Greg, listen.
This is very, very important.

312
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,608
You try to run, we shoot you.

313
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,610
You try to make a scene,
we shoot you.

00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:44,046
You fuck around with
all kinds of brilliant things...

315
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:45,213
We will shoot you.

316
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:46,214
It goes for you too.

317
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:48,350
You take hands off
the steering wheel again,

318
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:49,518
you unfasten
your seat belt,

319
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:51,220
you open your door
without permission,

320
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:53,355
you will be scrubbing your blood
off the dashboard.

321
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:55,257
- I promise you.
- I got it.

322
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:57,092
You're not gonna call dispatch.

323
00:13:58,124 --> 00:13:58,528
- No.
- CASPER: No?

324
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,629
- That's right.
- Okay.

325
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:03,365
I don't know where I'm going.

326
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:05,367
Okay, turn a right, make a left

327
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,302
gonna pull up at the ATM
around the corner.

328
00:14:07,336 --> 00:14:09,371
Are we clear on how this works?

329
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,640
What can I do
to make you not do this?

00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:15,445

Four ATM withdrawals,
$1600 and not getting shot,

333
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:21,483
priceless.

334
00:14:22,585 --> 00:14:25,120
If you have any doubt
that I will shoot you, Greg,

336
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,091

- SAMMY: Okay.

Just pull over right here.

00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,626
Genesis Holy Water
from the River Jordan.

861
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:09,062
We bottle it in the Holy Land
and ship it to Kentucky.

862
00:40:09,096 --> 00:40:10,231
There's a huge market for it.

863
00:40:10,898 --> 00:40:12,633
I do the legwork,
I go to churches,

864
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:13,968
and I give them the sales pitch.

865
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:15,603
Okay, let's hear it.

866
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:19,907
You wanna hear the sales pitch?

867
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,175
Like your life depends on it.

868
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:22,376
I usually set up the meeting...

869
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:24,945
I don't wanna hear how you
do it, I wanna hear the pitch.

870
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:27,247
- Pretend you're Greg Newman...
- Patron saint of liars.

871
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,983
Like you're Greg Newman
from Sta. Rosa.

872
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:31,085
- I am Greg Newman.
- Okay, that's good.

873
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:33,721
- It's becoming more authentic...
- I'm not feeling it.

874
00:40:33,753 --> 00:40:34,755
Shut up.

875
00:40:36,155 --> 00:40:37,157
All right, look, I'll...

876
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:39,893
Okay, I'll give you
the short sales pitch but...

877
00:40:41,128 --> 00:40:43,631
You know, I change it, it's
different if you're Catholic.

878
00:40:43,664 --> 00:40:45,667
- Or Baptist or Methodist...
- Let's go Catholic.

879
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,902
Catholic.

880
00:40:49,302 --> 00:40:50,304
Okay.

881
00:41:07,855 --> 00:41:11,291
They say salesmanship
is 99 percent perspiration

882
00:41:11,324 --> 00:41:12,859
and 1 percent inspiration.

883
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:17,731
For me,
it's the other way around.

884
00:41:18,965 --> 00:41:21,001
Look, when it comes
to sincere marketing

885
00:41:21,434 --> 00:41:23,670
inspiration heal lost souls.

886
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:26,673
Thirsty souls.

887
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:30,344
You see,
they quench their thirst

888
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:31,679
with the wrong substances.

889
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,414
They sell supplements
for everything today,

890
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:37,851
but they still haven't cured
deficiencies of spirit.

891
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:42,856
What folks need is vitamin water

892
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:44,291
of a much greater nature.

893
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:47,961
I submit to you what every
Catholic family should have,

894
00:41:47,994 --> 00:41:49,262
holy water in the home.

895
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:52,232
And it is the role of the Church
to put it there.

896
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:56,269
Some people say the Church
has fallen from grace.

897
00:41:56,936 --> 00:41:59,039
No, sir. That's a lie.

898
00:42:00,807 --> 00:42:02,710
They say
there's a crisis of faith.

899
00:42:02,742 --> 00:42:05,078
I say there's always been
a crisis of faith.

900
00:42:06,213 --> 00:42:08,682
There's too many forces working
against the side of heaven.

901
00:42:09,248 --> 00:42:11,284
Too much heresy
is blocking the airwaves.

902
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:15,189
Good people are deeply lost
in the realms of the unholy.

903
00:42:16,123 --> 00:42:18,259
Forgive them for they know not
what they do. No, sir.

904
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,662
That just won't cut it.

905
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:24,230
We can forgive them,
but we cannot forgive ourselves

906
00:42:24,264 --> 00:42:25,432
for not showing them the way.

907
00:42:25,465 --> 00:42:28,335
They go with the flow, we have
a different flow to offer.

908
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:31,739
And it is a mighty
and holy river.

909
00:42:35,876 --> 00:42:38,880
Genesis Holy Water
from the River Jordan.

910
00:42:40,012 --> 00:42:42,349
The Church had not only
endorse it, but sell it.

911
00:42:43,217 --> 00:42:44,218
Wholesale.

912
00:42:45,952 --> 00:42:47,954
Believers will crossover
to our side

913
00:42:47,987 --> 00:42:49,422
as those who crossed
the River Jordan

914
00:42:49,456 --> 00:42:51,893
to hear the Lord preach
and they were healed.

915
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:55,228
When the enemies of the Lord
sought to capture him,

916
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:57,932
Jesus took refuge
in the River Jordan.

917
00:42:58,865 --> 00:43:01,034
Where John
had first baptized him.

918
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:04,771
When all people were baptized,
and Jesus was at prayer,

919
00:43:04,804 --> 00:43:08,241
the skies opened
and the Holy Spirit descended.

920
00:43:09,342 --> 00:43:10,344

921
00:43:11,512 --> 00:43:12,714
Chapter 3.

922
00:43:15,014 --> 00:43:16,016
Verse 21.

923
00:43:19,987 --> 00:43:22,923
- Are you fucking serious?
- He knows his lines.

924
00:43:23,523 --> 00:43:25,259
- You got a Bible here, test it?
- No.

925
00:43:25,826 --> 00:43:27,360
So then you are the fool

926
00:43:27,393 --> 00:43:29,229
who walketh in the darkness.

927
00:43:29,262 --> 00:43:30,264
Book of Casper.

928
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:33,967
Chapter 3, verse 9.

929
00:43:35,168 --> 00:43:36,469
It sounds good to me.

930
00:43:36,503 --> 00:43:38,205
Of course it sounds good.

931
00:43:38,237 --> 00:43:39,873
He's a con artist.

932
00:43:39,907 --> 00:43:41,375
And he's brilliant at it,
hat's off.

933
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,811
Nobody talks the talk like that
unless they do it for a living.

934
00:43:44,844 --> 00:43:46,846
Con artists do.

935
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,182
That's why he managed to steal
4 million from the Roman.

936
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:52,318
He can Jesus me
till the Holy Cows come home.

937
00:43:52,351 --> 00:43:54,054
I ain't buying it for a second.

938
00:44:01,027 --> 00:44:02,028
I kind of wanna listen.

939
00:44:03,063 --> 00:44:05,266
No, you don't wanna listen,
you wanna believe,

940
00:44:05,298 --> 00:44:07,967
because you feel guilty cause
he's gonna die for his sins.

941
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:09,970
I just don't want him to die
if he ain't Julius.

942
00:44:10,003 --> 00:44:12,873
Yes, and Julius knows that,
he's trying to make you believe.

943
00:44:12,905 --> 00:44:14,307
I know
how this whole thing works.

944
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,010
I got a friend,
she's a phone sex operator.

945
00:44:17,043 --> 00:44:18,945
She can make you
believe anything.

946
00:44:19,246 --> 00:44:21,148
You want it
to be all hot and wet?

947
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:22,316
She's cumming.

948
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:23,951
You want to have sex
with a Martian?

949
00:44:23,983 --> 00:44:26,219
You can feel
the little green antennas

950
00:44:26,253 --> 00:44:27,988
crawling all over your skin.

951
00:44:28,021 --> 00:44:30,458
And she can sell you holy water
just like Julius Jacks here.

952
00:44:31,057 --> 00:44:33,893
And you'll buy it,
because you're a believer.

953
00:44:33,927 --> 00:44:34,929
Idiot.

954
00:44:37,496 --> 00:44:39,366
Everything I said is true.

955
00:44:42,969 --> 00:44:44,070
You want a mock trial?

956
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:45,939
Okay, you got it.

Ooh, an apple.

Mm-hm. Where's
your holy water, salesman?

960
00:44:57,284 --> 00:44:59,487
Where are your samples?
Your holy Bible?

961
00:45:00,454 --> 00:45:02,590
Your brochures? Where are they?

962
00:45:04,123 --> 00:45:06,292
- I don't have them on me.
- Big fucking surprise.

963
00:45:06,326 --> 00:45:08,329
If this guy is a holy water
salesman, I'm the pope.

964
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:11,030
- Where's your stuff?
- I'm not in town to sell.

965
00:45:11,063 --> 00:45:12,098
You're in town

966
00:45:12,532 --> 00:45:14,934

with Mrs. Jacks.

I have a meeting
with Elmer Jonas.

00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,913
He's a famous TV evangelist,

SAMMY:
Yeah, I know that guy.

972
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:29,550
Is it on Channel 40 or something
like the Salvation Network?

Take the Oak Valley exit.

974
00:45:31,617 --> 00:45:33,855
Turn right and shut the fuck up!

975
00:45:34,153 --> 00:45:35,889
Elmer Jonas, isn't that that guy

976
00:45:35,922 --> 00:45:38,925
that said God has a special
place in hell for gay people.

977
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:40,126
Yes, he's a bigot,

978
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,297
but he's also watched by 4
million Americans every Sunday.

979
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:45,431
And he's staying
at the Waterfront...

980
00:45:45,465 --> 00:45:47,134
So you're going
for a business meeting

981
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:48,935
without your
business materials, hmm.

982
00:45:49,936 --> 00:45:51,605
I already met him
and gave him a full pitch.

983
00:45:51,637 --> 00:45:52,940
This is a follow-up.

984
00:45:52,972 --> 00:45:54,942
So what if you run into
his colleagues

985
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:57,411
and they are thirsty
for your holy water, no samples?

986
00:45:57,443 --> 00:45:59,179
Look, I met him in April,

987
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:01,414
my boss wanted him to endorse
our water in his show.

988
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:04,018
- I spent the weekend with him.
- So what's the meeting for?

about something personal.

Take your time,
think of something good.

992
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:12,992
I had his number in
the cell phone that you broke.

993
00:46:13,025 --> 00:46:14,027
We're getting to the Roman

994
00:46:14,061 --> 00:46:16,063
and he doesn't wanna hear
any bullshit story.

995
00:46:16,096 --> 00:46:17,664
- Trust me.
- GREG: It's a personal point.

996
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:20,968
I need money.

997
00:46:21,934 --> 00:46:23,036
Four million from the Roman
wasn't enough?

998
00:46:27,306 --> 00:46:28,308
He can kill me.

999
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:32,914
I probably deserve everything
that's coming to me.

Bravo. Well done.

So, basically, I learned

1370
01:08:41,707 --> 01:08:44,244
everything I needed to know
from the driver.

1371
01:08:44,777 --> 01:08:45,911
You know, some cab drivers,

1372
01:08:45,944 --> 01:08:47,513
they're always talking,
never shut up.

get into the cab,</i>

1375
01:08:54,086 --> 01:08:55,588
<i>but his two guys hadn't.</i>

1376
01:09:00,658 --> 01:09:02,627
<i>Now if I switch places
with the cabbie,</i>

1377
01:09:02,661 --> 01:09:05,297
<i>the Roman's boys
would lead me right to you.</i>

1378
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:24,617
<i>All I needed
was a stand in for me.</i>

1379
01:09:25,016 --> 01:09:27,019
<i>Huh, sure,
I mean, it's a long shot</i>

1380
01:09:27,051 --> 01:09:28,054
<i>but it's my only chance.</i>

1381
01:09:28,487 --> 01:09:30,523
<i>And you know what, I got lucky</i>

1382
01:09:30,555 --> 01:09:32,324

I found our boy Greg.</i>

01:10:05,556 --> 01:10:06,559
What a day.

01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:23,842
We're going for a ride.

1389
01:10:28,913 --> 01:10:31,016
- Do I have a choice?
- SAMMY: No.

1390
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:34,353
Get in. All right.

Let's go.

1392
01:11:08,686 --> 01:11:10,622
You know, I have to get

01:11:15,461 --> 01:11:17,195
I got a call
from those folks in Arizona.

1395
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:18,530
I have to go out there.

1396
01:11:20,164 --> 01:11:21,967
I'm sorry but I got to do it.

1397
01:11:23,868 --> 01:11:26,938
It's one last meeting

It's never done.

What are you gonna do
about Greg?

01:12:03,975 --> 01:12:06,144
- We're going for a ride.
- You can't.

1402
01:12:07,145 --> 01:12:08,214
You know that I have to.

1403
01:12:09,113 --> 01:12:10,215
Not this time.

I know.

1413
01:13:13,845 --> 01:13:15,780
I'm talking about the situation
with your mother.

1414
01:13:26,658 --> 01:13:28,060
Could I ask you
to do something for me?

1415
01:13:31,997 --> 01:13:33,566
Would you give a message
to my mother?

1416
01:13:38,302 --> 01:13:39,305
Just tell her...

1417
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:44,543
That I never lost my faith.

1418
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:49,248
Tell her I love her.

1419
01:13:52,184 --> 01:13:53,185
She was right.

1420
01:13:56,688 --> 01:13:57,989
That I never lost my faith.

1421
01:13:59,123 --> 01:14:00,760
I think I can do that for you.

Greg Newman from Santa Rosa.

1423
01:14:10,135 --> 01:14:11,637

Hell, she made me who I am.

1427

With just the two of us.

1428
01:14:27,351 --> 01:14:28,720
Then things turned.

1429
01:14:30,855 --> 01:14:31,957
I had to cut her loose.

1430
01:14:36,694 --> 01:14:38,930
You see, Greg,
we have a lot more in common

1431
01:14:38,963 --> 01:14:40,699
than just our taste in suits.

1432
01:15:25,743 --> 01:15:26,845
Listen to me very carefully.
