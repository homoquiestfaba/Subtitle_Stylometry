1
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,338
<i>I, Mordecai.</i>

2
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:41,976
<i>Everyone has their story.</i>

3
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:46,514
<i>I was born</i>
<i>July 27th, 1933,</i>

4
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:49,751
<i>in Janów Podlaski, Poland.</i>

5
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,786
<i>My father tells me</i>

6
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,421
<i>it was a very hot day.</i>

7
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,828
Yohanan!

8
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,710
Mordecai!

9
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:37,164
Jakub! Jakub!

10
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:47,775
Ssh!

11
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,466
Oh, boy.

12
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:08,756
What now?

13
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,393
- What?
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>

14
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:15,863
- Yeah, hello-- Marvin?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

15
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:18,398
What? I can't hear
what you're saying.

16
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,400
I can't take it anymore.
I'm picking you up.

17
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,269
We're getting you
a new phone.

18
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,939
<i>No, don't come.</i>
<i>I'm busy now.</i>

19
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:27,041
I'm on my way, Dad.

20
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:31,478
Look, Ryan, the cigars need
more time to age.

21
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:34,015
<i>Marvin,</i>
<i>you're running out of cash.</i>

22
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,316
<i>You can't hold out forever.</i>

23
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,586
Okay, I gotta go,
I'll see you later.

24
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:53,000
Mrs. Gomez!

25
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:55,302
Mrs. Gomez! <i>Qué paso?</i>

26
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,671
<i>"Qué pasó?"</i>
<i>Qué tú piensas?</i>

27
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,806
It's your crazy father again.

28
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,476
Mom! What's going on?

29
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,646
- Go ask him.
- Dad!

30
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,658
What the fuck?!

31
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,866
Dad! Dad!

32
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,603
What for you sneak up
on me like that?

33
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,138
What the hell are you doing?

34
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,539
Your mother,
she can't step into

35
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,406
the tub to take shower,

36
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,342
so we make walk-in shower.

37
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,779
Yeah-- so you have
a jackhammer?!

38
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:41,249
Well, this place is
built like bunker, all cement.

39
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,450
What you want me to use,
hammer and chisel?

40
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:44,852
- Maybe a toothpick?
- No, I want you

41
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:47,054
- to call a plumber.
- I am a plumber!

42
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:48,790
You retired 15 years ago.

43
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:50,625
How are you and Mom
supposed to wash

44
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,160
while you build this thing?

45
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,995
Mrs. Gomez, nice lady,

46
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,063
we use her bathroom.

47
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:39,106
Mom!

48
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,280
Mom!

49
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,951
What is your yelling
at your mother?!

50
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,086
- I raised you!
- I know, but he's--

51
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,889
--and I almost died
giving birth to you.

52
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,624
You have huge head.

53
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,659
I know.
All I wanted to do

54
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:00,427
was come here,
take him to the mall,

55
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,729
and buy him a new phone.

56
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:03,664
That's it.
This is what I get.

57
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:06,067
Okay, I go with you.

58
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,802
Well, he's on a mission
in there right now,

59
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,503
I don't think he's gonna
really listen to you.

60
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:10,838
We'll see about that.

61
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:13,140
Mordecai,
we're going to the mall,

62
00:06:13,274 --> 00:06:15,375
or no hanky-panky.

63
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:18,546
Okay, go get ready.

64
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,383
Okay, we get ready.

65
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:28,455
Okay, we get ready.

66
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,258
Yeah, but I could--
I could fix this.

67
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,626
I could put some more...

68
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,094
- Dad.
- ...electrical tape on it.

69
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,662
- That's what I'll do.
- Dad, face facts.

70
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,364
The phone is dead.

71
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,399
You should bury
the Jeep with that phone.

72
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,770
- "Ha-ha."
- How about that other Jeep?

73
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:44,939
That Nazi shit car
of yours, huh?

74
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,741
Going to rain, Mordecai.

75
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,542
What rain?
Where's the rain?

76
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:57,785
Ugh!

77
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,521
Great-- Dad, I thought
you were gonna get a new window.

78
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,590
Who needs new window? Here.

79
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,825
Perhaps when the--
the big cigar deal

80
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,661
actually happens,
then I get the window,

81
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,529
- and maybe new car with it.
- All right, we're not

82
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:09,997
having this conversation
right now.

83
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:12,533
I ask for the...
report on the... loan.

84
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,969
There's water
on floor back here.

85
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,772
Talk about being big shot
in the cigar business, huh,

86
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,774
now here in the making,
and you say nothing.

87
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,442
- Please, please.
- Nothing, not even an update.

88
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,145
Fine, you want an update?
Next week, we get

89
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,913
a new batch of samples,
then we'll know.

90
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:27,915
- It's not plumbing.
- Water on the floor--

91
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:29,550
Look what happened
in all my life.

92
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:30,851
Huh? Look what I do for him,

93
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:32,520
after he's shown
no respect for me.

94
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,288
- My-- My own son!
- "Respect."

95
00:07:34,422 --> 00:07:36,691
- Where's my update?
- Enough with the two of you.

96
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:39,492
Car floor is full of water.

97
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:42,029
Marvin, pull the plug.

98
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:44,565
- I'm drowning back here.
- Oh, my God.

99
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:53,473
Brighten up,
this is light here, we go now.

100
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:01,015
I get my war reparations
check from Germany,

101
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,416
I go buy brassiere.

102
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,051
How come you get
reparations check,

103
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:05,286
and I get shit?

104
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,787
Because I suffered

105
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,923
more than you,
that's mine.

106
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:12,059
How many times
I have to say it?

107
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:14,128
What is she talkin'...

108
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,035
Ahh.

109
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,636
- What do you think?
- No-no-no, this is not--

110
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,205
- Pretty cool, right?
- Not for me.

111
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,007
It's all right, come on,
you're gonna be all right.

112
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,608
- We got the phone right here.
- Marvin, Marvin--

113
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:29,043
I don't know
how to use iPhone.

114
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,911
- I got landline.
- If you don't like it,

115
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:32,513
you wanna give it back,
we'll get another one.

116
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:33,848
- No--
- Yeah, but I want you

117
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,316
- to look at this, look.
- No.

118
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,884
Come on.
All right.

119
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:38,686
I'm gonna go get some help.
Don't go anywhere.

120
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,321
I don't...

121
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,156
Marv...

122
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,695
That's going to allow us
to add some depth to our image,

123
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,664
like this... see?

124
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,420
See, in a digital world,
we create our own reality.

125
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,923
And through technology,
we create anything we want to.

126
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:18,659
We can make it real,
make it come to life.

127
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:21,062
Just something that existed
in our minds today

128
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:24,865
is now being shared
with the world, instantly.

129
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,136
And here is
a perfect opportunity

130
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,705
for me to show you exactly
what I was talking about.

131
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,574
Oh!

132
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,143
Oh, my!

133
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,014
That is all I have

134
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,183
for all of you today.
Thank you so much for coming,

135
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,351
and I hope to see you
next time.

136
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,822
Hey, there.
Are you interested

137
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,024
in a course in digital art?

138
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,460
Digital art?

139
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,395
Thought this was phone store.

140
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:55,896
Yeah...

141
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,998
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

142
00:09:58,132 --> 00:09:59,534
Sorry.

143
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,202
- Wanna know a secret?
- Yeah.

144
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,904
- Sometimes I don't either.
- Yeah.

145
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,508
- I'm Nina, by the way.
- Nina.

146
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,876
My son, he wants me
to use an iPhone.

147
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:12,613
But I happy with my old
flippy phone for calling.

148
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,682
It's been with me

149
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,484
through all my plumbing years.

150
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,018
Are you having trouble

151
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:19,820
hearing who you're
talking to on that thing?

152
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,355
I have trouble
hearing, period.

153
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:24,024
Dad, there you are,
don't wander off, please.

154
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:25,693
Come here, I want you
to meet somebody.

155
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,863
This is Jared,
he's an iPhone specialist.

156
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,532
Pleased to make
your acquaintance, sir.

157
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,966
What's up, Nina?

158
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,603
Oh, hi, uh,
are you already together?

159
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,671
Oh, not in a retail
sort of sense.

160
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,674
I actually have another class
I have to get to anyway, so--

161
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,077
but good luck
with your phone.

162
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,679
Mr. Samel, I present to you
the state-of-the-art

163
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,616
of the state-of-the-art,
the new iPhone.

164
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,884
So what cost this phone

165
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,752
- with no buttons?
- Dad, you see

166
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,555
these kids in the blue shirts--
you know what they call them?

167
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:54,989
- What?
- Prodigies.

168
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,824
- Because they're so smart.
- Oh, boy.

169
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,326
Him? He don't look
like Einstein to me.

170
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,563
- Dad, don't be rude, please.
- Rude? Why don't you show

171
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,063
some respect yourself, huh?

172
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:04,865
I don't want to come here
in the first place.

173
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,401
I get the fuck out of here.

174
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,438
Your card, Mr. Samel.

175
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:13,908
<i>No bueno.</i>

176
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:19,180
Should've gone
straight home. Here.

177
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,243
Netta? Hon?

178
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,811
Hi, I think she has

179
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:52,746
a "welcome home" present
for you in there.

180
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,748
Let me take a quick sniff.

181
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,051
Oh, boy. How was it
with your family?

182
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,386
Don't even ask.
I get to the apartment,

183
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:02,256
and there is smoke
billowing out of the door.

184
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,225
- Smoke?
- Right, sorry, not smoke,

185
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,760
it was plaster dust,
to be more specific.

186
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,096
And a lot of it.
Everywhere.

187
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,998
And that's just
the beginning of it.

188
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,601
Then he's dragging me there...

189
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,005
And then he's like this--

190
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:22,176
"Hello? Hello? How are ya?"

191
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,746
"Hello?
Can ya get me up there."

192
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,248
Look at your dad.
Look at your dad.

193
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:28,849
He screams at me
inside of the store

194
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,619
and storms out.

195
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,319
But you still love him.

196
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:34,188
I'm just concerned

197
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:37,191
that he's gonna continue
to get himself into trouble.

198
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,493
You should just
move them in here.

199
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,229
What part of
"jackhammering the bathtub"

200
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:44,231
- didn't you understand?
- You don't know.

201
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:47,101
He might do a really good job
on the bathroom.

202
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,303
You know what?
If he wants to be included

203
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,139
in your big deal,
include him.

204
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,475
I'm getting the hang of this.

205
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,749
You are a horrible father.

206
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,384
It runs in the family.

207
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,088
I'll do it right,
I'll get it right.

208
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,060
Here you go, Mr. Schwartz.

209
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:17,398
Well, that's it for now.

210
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:20,134
See you next month
at the Survivors' Meeting,

211
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:24,071
where we will celebrate
Ida Brown's 100th birthday.

212
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,841
From Auschwitz to Aventura.

213
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,943
Happy Birthday, Ida.

214
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:38,052
This party is going
to be so amazing.

215
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,820
How does it feel
to be almost 100

216
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,889
with everything
that you've been through?

217
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:44,825
Ah, I was
just about your age

218
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,094
when I went into the camps.

219
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,962
But I chose
not to let that

220
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,566
define how I live my life.

221
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,738
If I did, it would dishonor
my parents and my sister.

222
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,573
Survivors have
to tell our stories

223
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:02,544
to young people like you,
so it never happens again.

224
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:05,279
<i>Good morning, Point East!</i>

225
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,481
<i>The bus for</i>
<i>the bingo tournament is leaving</i>

226
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,416
<i>in 15 minutes.</i>

227
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:10,851
--even talking about?

228
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:14,455
Why, hello,
Mr. and Mrs. Samel.

229
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:17,091
Mr. Samel,
I was hoping to see you.

230
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:20,027
I want you to enter
the bocce ball tournament

231
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,163
at our annual community
festival next month.

232
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:26,668
Thank you, Mrs. Campbell,
but I no play bocce ball.

233
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:30,471
Oh, but Mordecai,
it's going to be so much fun.

234
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:34,408
You know, I was quite
an athlete when I was younger.

235
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:38,379
Oh, I can tell.
So strong.

236
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:40,682
Did you ever play
anything professionally?

237
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:44,284
Enough of this nonsense,
I only going to tell this once.

238
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:46,821
You stay away from my man.

239
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:49,022
You buried
two husbands already.

240
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:52,226
You're not stealing this one.
Mordecai, we go.

241
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,862
I think that
bocce's not for me.

242
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,896
Now listen to me,
you don't talk

243
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,464
to that crazy shiksa.

244
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,400
She was schtupping
Mr. Longstein.

245
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,736
He tried from heart attack
on the spot.

246
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,872
What are you--
meshuggeneh?

247
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,540
We married 50 years.

248
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:07,975
Every lady in the street,
you think I'm schtupping them?

249
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,678
I'm going to tell you
something now.

250
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:12,747
My brothers and sisters,

251
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,982
they warned me
about you.

252
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:18,185
No-no-no, they warned you
about the guy before me.

253
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,655
The one with the mustache.
What's wrong with you?

254
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,089
Nothing, I hungry,

255
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,858
- let's go eat.
- Me too.

256
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:01,495
Oh-- what you doing
with that thing?

257
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,964
It's an iPhone.
From Marvin.

258
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,236
Oh, Mordecai,
I don't want that in this house.

259
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:12,841
You see how people
stare at that thing.

260
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,008
That brainwashing device,

261
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,311
like Stalin.

262
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:20,582
There's no buttons.
I don't--

263
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:22,349
I don't understand,
there's no buttons.

264
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:24,351
I don't care,
I want you

265
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,119
call Marvin
in the morning

266
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:29,524
and tell him...
take that thing back.

267
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,127
I said I take this thing back.

268
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,396
When I say "never,"
I mean "never."

269
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,601
Einstein, Mr. Einstein.

270
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:41,134
- This-- This a return.
- What?

271
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,070
Dad, this is a person.

272
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,973
- Really? A return?
- No, no.

273
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,608
We're here to get
my father a few lessons.

274
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:48,208
- Sign him up.
- No-- no! No lessons.

275
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:49,677
- A few lessons.
- I take no lessons.

276
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:52,012
I teach myself painting.
I teach myself plumbing.

277
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,347
No lessons.

278
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,449
Mr. Samel,
Nina's starting

279
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,820
a group lesson over there
in about ten minutes,

280
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:00,555
if you wanna check it out.

281
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,123
No, no group lesson.

282
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:05,527
I get the fuck out of here.

283
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,335
Oh, Nina.

284
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:17,605
I just thought,
maybe instead of doing

285
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:19,574
group lessons
for your phone, that...

286
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,676
maybe you'll wanna do
private lessons instead.

287
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,011
Lessons no good, no.

288
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,913
Well, what about with me?

289
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,180
Just... I'll teach you.

290
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:30,117
- One on one.
- You?

291
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,254
My manager might not be
okay with it, though,

292
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,624
so... can you keep a secret?

293
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:39,459
In Yiddish, secret,
that's my middle name.

294
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:42,129
- Hah.
- Okay then.

295
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,734
All right, all right,
I show up...

296
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:48,636
for the lesson.

297
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,039
I forgot to mention to you,
there is a fee.

298
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,508
A fee? What fee?

299
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:56,711
Pretzel dog.
With hot mustard.

300
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,211
Ah.

301
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:02,149
With mustard.

302
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,619
- And hit Save.
- So this is...

303
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,921
these are buttons,
but they're really not buttons,

304
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:08,623
but they're buttons anyway?

305
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:12,125
Yeah, that's
pretty much the idea...

306
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,107
Oh, my God.

307
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,557
Hello? Marvin?

308
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,993
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>
<i>I'm watching the babies.</i>

309
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,360
Yeah?

310
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,730
Yeah, this is
first iPhone call.

311
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:50,397
I'm having first lesson

312
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,000
- with Einstein Nina.
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>

313
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,602
Oh, but Marvin, please,
don't tell your mother.

314
00:18:58,673 --> 00:19:01,776
May I say you...
you have value

315
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:04,244
far more than pretzels.

316
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,115
Thank you, Mr. Samel.

317
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,816
I'm Mordecai.

318
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,250
- Mordecai.
- Yeah.

319
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:12,185
<i>Mr. Mordecai Samel.</i>

320
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,522
<i>Paging Mr. Mordecai Samel.</i>

321
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,593
- Isn't that you?
- Yeah.

322
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:26,134
So, it wasn't a heart attack.

323
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:27,902
Here's the thing, Dad.

324
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:29,537
The doctor...

325
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:32,140
thinks that
she has a form of dementia.

326
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,473
You know what that is?

327
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:35,610
It means that her mind...

328
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:37,779
isn't working like it used to.

329
00:19:37,912 --> 00:19:39,580
Yeah, so, whose is?

330
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:43,785
Dad...

331
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:47,287
it means that
some days she'll be fine.

332
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:48,990
And others, she won't.

333
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:50,692
There's a name for it.

334
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,960
- You can read about it.
- Look.

335
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:54,696
Ali-Holmes fight.

336
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:57,197
We watched that
when you were little boy.

337
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,833
<i>...in Las Vegas, Nevada.</i>

338
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,502
<i>That's the end</i>
<i>of round number seven.</i>

339
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,005
Eh, shame.

340
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:07,307
Ali...
he's too old to fight.

341
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:09,309
He used to be so strong.

342
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:11,045
Now, look.

343
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:12,847
<i>...and to see a man</i>
<i>that's just kind of</i>

344
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,282
<i>trying to...</i>
<i>looks to me, hang on</i>

345
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,051
<i>and keep the thing going</i>

346
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:19,187
- <i>for one more time.</i>
- Dad.

347
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,221
Mom can't really be alone,

348
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,691
- you understand?
- Yeah.

349
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:27,895
You okay?

350
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,500
I'll be back.

351
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:46,581
Huh.

352
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:49,449
Days like this,
I miss Siberia.

353
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,755
<i>Ali's taking some fisticuffs.</i>

354
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:38,993
How's your mom?

355
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:40,928
She's fine,
nothing to worry about.

356
00:22:41,062 --> 00:22:42,730
Well, thank God.

357
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:45,398
You have to be shaken up,
are you all right?

358
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:48,736
Yeah, I'm fine.
What's all this?

359
00:22:49,804 --> 00:22:51,038
Yeah, don't worry about it,

360
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:53,074
we can talk about it
another time.

361
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:55,375
Well, no, I can see
that you're stressed out.

362
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,477
Just tell me, what is it?

363
00:22:57,612 --> 00:22:59,379
Well, it...

364
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:00,815
is what it looks like, Marvin.

365
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:04,051
It's bills,
and this-- this?--

366
00:23:04,185 --> 00:23:06,053
is a credit card
I didn't even know we had

367
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:08,823
- that's completely maxed out.
- Well, I had to have cash

368
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:10,524
to keep the factory open, okay?

369
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:12,727
It's 0% for 18 months,
we're gonna be fine.

370
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,998
No-- we didn't pay
our mortgage last month, Marvin.

371
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:19,133
We have two baby girls,
I don't sleep.

372
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,335
Look, this is a cash flow
problem, that's all.

373
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,004
Every business goes
through this.

374
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:26,107
No, every business doesn't
borrow a lot of money

375
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,642
from your father.

376
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:29,176
You have to keep him
up to speed.

377
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,312
Why can't you talk to him?

378
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,915
Because he'll jinx it!

379
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:35,683
What?

380
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:37,518
He'll jinx the deal.

381
00:23:37,652 --> 00:23:40,487
- Jinx, like bad luck?
- Yes!

382
00:23:41,856 --> 00:23:44,091
When I was
about 16 years old,

383
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:46,994
we were all in the basement,
playing poker.

384
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:49,397
Marvin, action on you.

385
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,132
<i>So I look at my hand.</i>

386
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:52,600
<i>And I've got pocket jacks</i>

387
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,368
<i>and another jack on the board,</i>

388
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:55,703
<i>which gives me</i>
<i>three of a kind.</i>

389
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:57,338
<i>Now, this is</i>
<i>the kind of hand</i>

390
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,674
<i>that I'm all set to win,</i>
<i>right out of the gate.</i>

391
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:01,075
<i>- And who walks in?</i>
<i>-</i> I raise.

392
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,576
<i>- My father.</i>
- Marvin!

393
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,079
- I call.
- I'm in a hand, Pop!

394
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:06,948
<i>Right then,</i>
<i>I should've known better.</i>

395
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:09,417
<i>But what?</i>
<i>Another jack.</i>

396
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,052
<i>Four of a kind,</i>
<i>I can't lose.</i>

397
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:12,653
<i>-</i> I call.
<i>- I call.</i>

398
00:24:12,787 --> 00:24:14,088
<i>Now, he might have a flush,</i>

399
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:15,856
<i>but if he does,</i>
<i>he's toast.</i>

400
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,658
<i>Four of a kind is</i>
<i>still the better hand.</i>

401
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:19,760
<i>- And I know it.</i>
- I raise.

402
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:21,929
Ooh, Marvin,
that's a lot of money.

403
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:23,731
- <i>And the trap is set.</i>
- I'm all in.

404
00:24:23,864 --> 00:24:26,033
<i>And his money is now</i>
<i>gonna be mine.</i>

405
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:29,236
<i>I call.</i>
<i>It's in the bank, right?</i>

406
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,938
<i>Not even my dad could ruin this.</i>

407
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:32,873
<i>- Show me the money, right?</i>
<i>-</i> Quad jacks.

408
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:35,109
- There ya go.
- <i>Wouldn't you know it?</i>

409
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:36,711
What?!

410
00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:38,980
<i>He pulled a double</i>
<i>inside straight flush</i>

411
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:41,248
<i>- against four jacks!</i>
<i>-</i> How do you lose that?!

412
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:43,384
<i>But that doesn't happen!</i>

413
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:45,953
<i>It's mathematically</i>
<i>impossible in poker.</i>

414
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:48,356
<i>It's never happened</i>
<i>in the history of poker, ever.</i>

415
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,192
You know the difference
between me and my son?

416
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:53,794
I a plumber.
I turn shit into money.

417
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:55,930
You turn money into shit.

418
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:58,498
<i>That's just one example</i>
<i>of many, many,</i>

419
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:01,469
<i>of my dad, the jinx.</i>

420
00:25:03,204 --> 00:25:06,207
Honey, Marvin,
this is childish.

421
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,344
Your father has helped you
in every way.

422
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:12,146
Please...

423
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:16,650
talk to him,
and no more credit cards.

424
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:19,787
We have babies to feed.

425
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:33,801
What you laughing?
That, uh...

426
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:36,704
that cartoon is
too violent for me.

427
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:38,572
You know,
booming the wall.

428
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:41,075
- Boom, I don't like that--
- You want I should change?

429
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,411
Yeah, please.

430
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:45,613
But don't put on that news.

431
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:47,481
All right,
all right, no news.

432
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:49,617
No news is good news.

433
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,118
Yeah.

434
00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:05,399
What? What "screensaver"?

435
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:07,536
I got new kind of popcorn.

436
00:26:07,668 --> 00:26:09,737
You try some.

437
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,607
Yeah, that...
that's special popcorn.

438
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:16,310
What you think?

439
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:17,845
It's good.

440
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:19,346
You don't even eat it.

441
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,115
No, it looks good.

442
00:26:29,524 --> 00:26:32,493
Hi, eh, hello, Mrs. Gomez.

443
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,028
What now, Mordecai?

444
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:36,864
I wonder if you could
keep an eye on Fela

445
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:39,633
for a little while.
Occasionally.

446
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:43,104
The doctor says
she can't be alone.

447
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:48,242
I do it... for Fela.

448
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,278
All right, thank--
thank you very much.

449
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:53,414
So, here's the picture
you told me to bring

450
00:26:53,548 --> 00:26:54,815
for the screen.

451
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:57,084
- is this your family?
- Yeah.

452
00:26:57,218 --> 00:26:58,719
It's in Poland.

453
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:01,021
Yeah, this is me
at six years.

454
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:03,757
These are my two aunts,

455
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:06,293
who always played with me.

456
00:27:06,427 --> 00:27:08,129
And my two brothers,

457
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:09,663
Moshe and Avram.

458
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:11,699
Moshe, he died during the war,

459
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:13,834
and Avram still
live in Israel,

460
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:16,003
and my Uncle Marek,
with the fiddle.

461
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:19,541
He always play,
even during the worst of times.

462
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:21,408
This is my father.

463
00:27:23,612 --> 00:27:25,179
Where is your mother?

464
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,148
Well, she was sick
inside the house,

465
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:29,683
and this was only day
that the photo person

466
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:31,886
was in the area.

467
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:36,223
You know, I can't remember
my mother's face.

468
00:27:36,357 --> 00:27:38,893
- At all?
- No.

469
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:41,563
This the only picture
of my family.

470
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:43,297
We had to leave everything.

471
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,966
It was 1939.
It was the world war.

472
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,868
You heard of Hitler?

473
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:50,171
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

474
00:27:50,304 --> 00:27:51,805
Nice guy, hm?

475
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:54,576
So, my village,
Janów Podlaski,

476
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,143
they-- they didn't know it,

477
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:58,746
but Hitler was making
this deal with Stalin--

478
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:01,215
That's the squinty guy
with the big mustache?

479
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,950
Another wonderful fella.

480
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:06,921
They decide to split Poland
like a watermelon, hm?

481
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:10,659
Now, my town was in the east,
on the Russian border.

482
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:15,062
Now, this was lucky because
Hitler invaded from the west.

483
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:17,998
And then unlucky, 'cause
Russia invaded from the east.

484
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:19,967
Right into my village.

485
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,036
This give us front row seats

486
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:24,171
to the beginning
of World War II.

487
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:33,948
<i>I don't really remember</i>

488
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:35,816
<i>my childhood.</i>

489
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,520
<i>But this day, I never forget.</i>

490
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:44,626
<i>I never saw a plane or a tank</i>
<i>before in my life.</i>

491
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:49,930
<i>What is war to a young boy?</i>

492
00:28:58,105 --> 00:29:00,307
<i>It was all very exciting.</i>

493
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:03,477
<i>Now, we have known</i>
<i>the neighbor our whole lives.</i>

494
00:29:03,612 --> 00:29:07,815
<i>So, no big deal</i>
<i>to get the ball back.</i>

495
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:10,784
<i>But then...</i>

496
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:15,690
- Papa!
- <i>I did not understand</i>

497
00:29:15,823 --> 00:29:17,258
<i>what was happening.</i>

498
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:19,193
<i>The mean neighbor</i>

499
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:21,128
<i>chases me</i>
<i>into my father's arms,</i>

500
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:24,031
<i>and yells,</i>
<i>"Get your Jew rat son</i>

501
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:27,034
<i>"the hell off my property!</i>

502
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,836
<i>"When the Nazis come,</i>

503
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:31,573
<i>I will feed you</i>
<i>to Hitler myself."</i>

504
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:33,207
<i>My father made up his mind</i>

505
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,943
<i>that we had to leave right now.</i>

506
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:37,778
<i>But where will we go?</i>

507
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:40,715
<i>The Russians are no better</i>
<i>about Jews being rounded up.</i>

508
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:43,585
<i>"I say, you're crazy,</i>
<i>we can't leave now!</i>

509
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:45,319
<i>"This home is the only one</i>

510
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,722
<i>our family has ever known,</i>
<i>for generations."</i>

511
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:52,727
<i>"We leave tonight.</i>
<i>We cross the River Bug</i>

512
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,461
<i>and reach Soviet territory."</i>

513
00:29:54,596 --> 00:29:57,131
<i>"But how will you know</i>
<i>it will be better?"</i>

514
00:29:57,264 --> 00:29:59,967
<i>"We don't know</i>
<i>it will be better.</i>

515
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,069
<i>"But we pray that it will.</i>

516
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:06,040
<i>"Eventually, we hope</i>
<i>we can make it to Palestine,</i>

517
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:08,610
<i>and maybe America."</i>

518
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:10,578
<i>So, my father always told</i>
<i>the story that,</i>

519
00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:13,782
if my ball never bounced
into the mean neighbor's yard,

520
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:15,784
we would never have left.

521
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:17,719
But your family did
leave, right?

522
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:19,654
Except the aunties
and uncles, yeah.

523
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:22,557
They were going to wait
until the young one was better,

524
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:26,594
and then follow, but, um...

525
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:28,896
we never saw them.

526
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:31,165
They were sent to Treblinka.

527
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:34,034
You know Treblinka?

528
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:37,104
- The Nazi death camp?
- I've...

529
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,407
I've heard of it.

530
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,744
Anyway, we found
the records of my aunts

531
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:45,513
when we made a trip to Poland.

532
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:48,148
But, um...

533
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:51,018
they never made it out.

534
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,824
But here I am, still.

535
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:58,926
I miss plumbing
and painting, too bad.

536
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,861
I miss going out on the town

537
00:31:00,994 --> 00:31:02,896
and music
from the old days.

538
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,266
And my tuchus has shrunk
too skinny for my pants,

539
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,737
but too bad!

540
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:11,205
But I am alive!

541
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:13,941
Yeah.

542
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:18,045
<i>Good afternoon, Point East!</i>

543
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:21,081
<i>This is your last chance</i>
<i>for pool jazz-ercise!</i>

544
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:23,250
Honey, she makes me crazy.

545
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:25,252
She just asked

546
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:27,789
if we'd register the girls
for kindergarten.

547
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:30,190
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Nah, that's what I said.

548
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:33,227
I was like, please, can we just
enjoy our babies as babies

549
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,462
before we start buying
prom dresses?

550
00:31:35,597 --> 00:31:37,331
What is that?

551
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:41,301
Looks like a big giant hole
in the ground.

552
00:31:43,103 --> 00:31:45,673
- With my father in it.
- Yup.

553
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:49,977
What do you think
he's doing?

554
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,378
Well, Marvin,

555
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:53,882
I think he is
just being your dad.

556
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:56,818
Why don't you go
check on him?

557
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,419
The girls and I will
go see Fela.

558
00:31:58,553 --> 00:32:00,789
- I wanna go with you.
- No! Talk to him.

559
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:03,691
Be patient.
Don't yell.

560
00:32:03,825 --> 00:32:05,894
Be an adult, and...

561
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:07,961
have fun.

562
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:25,914
Hey.

563
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:27,582
What you doing?

564
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:29,818
Digging for worms
for a fishing expedition.

565
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,419
What do you think I'm doing?
Those motherfucks,

566
00:32:32,554 --> 00:32:34,589
they wanted to hire
a plumbing company.

567
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:36,624
Told them I'll do it better
and for half the price.

568
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:38,358
I'm a plumber.

569
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:41,295
- You need any help?
- Ergh, yeah.

570
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:43,397
Give me the pipe wrench there.

571
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:45,934
No-no-no,
not the crescent wrench,

572
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:47,702
the pipe wrench,
there, there.

573
00:32:47,836 --> 00:32:50,270
Ahh, you don't know the tools.

574
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,746
Oy... all right.

575
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,750
All right,
now give me the...

576
00:33:02,884 --> 00:33:04,117
Channellock.

577
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:05,653
I don't know
what a Channellock is.

578
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:07,722
You don't know? Here.
That one there.

579
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:10,057
That's a Channellock, see, huh?
You don't know nothing.

580
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,559
Well, how would I?
The only time you let me

581
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:13,126
come on a plumbing trip
with you,

582
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,963
you fired me
after ten minutes.

583
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:16,463
Because you were incompetent.

584
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:18,065
I was seven!

585
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:19,901
Heh, I was
in Siberian orphanage

586
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:22,570
when I was seven years old, huh?
Hard life for you, huh?

587
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:24,371
I know how much
you've done for me, Dad,

588
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:26,139
but you know what?
You're a little rough

589
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:28,843
- on me sometimes.
- Ah, you don't know from rough.

590
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:30,177
Give me the endcap there.

591
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,646
What's an endcap?

592
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:35,617
Endcap, endcap, yeah,
see this? Yeah.

593
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,417
I raised a schlemiel.

594
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:39,521
You know, Dad, I didn't
come here to fight with you.

595
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:41,121
I actually thought
I'd update you

596
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:42,924
on the cigar deal.

597
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:44,826
Something good maybe?

598
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,562
Well... not yet, I mean,

599
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:50,130
the cigars are rolled,
but the tobacco

600
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:52,065
hasn't cured yet.
We have to wait a little longer.

601
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,433
- How much longer?
- We don't know.

602
00:33:53,568 --> 00:33:55,102
We don't know,
but we know that

603
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:56,604
we're onto something
really special here.

604
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:58,338
The only problem is
that the buyer doesn't

605
00:33:58,472 --> 00:33:59,841
wanna take our business
until the cigars are

606
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:02,710
- on the shelves.
- Yeah, well, I don't blame him.

607
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:04,044
So, you're so close.

608
00:34:04,177 --> 00:34:05,379
Put your cigars
on the shelf,

609
00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:06,848
who's gonna
know the difference?

610
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:08,282
Everyone knows the difference.

611
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:09,784
It's the taste.
Everyone knows the taste.

612
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,553
- Smoke tastes like smoke.
- Oh, my God.

613
00:34:11,686 --> 00:34:13,788
You wait for
special smoke, huh?

614
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:16,156
While you wait for
different-tasting smoke,

615
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,892
bills go unpaid.

616
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:19,493
This is asinine.

617
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:21,061
I mortgaged
my condo for you.

618
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:22,997
I know you did, Dad,
and I thank you.

619
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,866
I have been paying
the interest.

620
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:28,603
Ay, what about I don't wait
for that different smoke?

621
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,071
- That's not gonna happen.
- Ah, but... what if?

622
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:33,440
Huh? Can you pay
the workers?

623
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:35,409
Can you keep
the lights on?

624
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:37,712
Can you stay in business?

625
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:39,413
Ugh! You see?

626
00:34:39,547 --> 00:34:41,381
You ask my opinion,
I'd've given instruction.

627
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:43,551
But no, what,
the whole thing's in the toilet?

628
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:45,853
This is a fucking crazy way
of doing business.

629
00:34:45,987 --> 00:34:47,689
You know that?

630
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:50,825
Look at what you did,
you nudnik!

631
00:35:07,508 --> 00:35:09,811
I wish to talk to you
about our son.

632
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:12,112
He don't respect me.

633
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,550
What could I have done
wrong, huh?

634
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:22,489
If he only knew what I did
to make his childhood better?

635
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,695
No, it is so far from home.

636
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:30,497
Is too-large ocean

637
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:32,900
to cross going to America.

638
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:37,170
This is intercoastal waterway.

639
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:39,107
Manmade by dredging.

640
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:43,044
This is not Atlantic...

641
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:44,746
Fela?

642
00:35:46,413 --> 00:35:48,683
It's your husband
speaking to you.

643
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:55,690
I was just...

644
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,827
yeah, well,
would be nice

645
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:02,396
to someday have shower.

646
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:06,400
I'm waiting
for the shower pan.

647
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:41,301
Whoo!

648
00:36:45,238 --> 00:36:46,708
Come on, everybody!

649
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:48,341
Together!

650
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:50,978
And left and down!

651
00:36:51,112 --> 00:36:53,047
And right
and down!

652
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:55,415
Together! And down.

653
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,451
All right--
keep going!

654
00:36:57,585 --> 00:36:59,854
Iris, you look great
out there!

655
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:02,557
Come on, everyone,
keep that energy up!

656
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,492
You all are doing
so amazing out there.

657
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:07,695
Tuesday, there are
free samples at the grocery.

658
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:10,230
- So we go there now.
- Mordecai, I think

659
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:12,066
it's time we changed up
your routine.

660
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,234
- What do you mean, you know?
- Take out your phone taxi app.

661
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:16,904
My phone--

662
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:19,540
I-I-I don't know...

663
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:23,276
It's time you lived a little.

664
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,345
Oh...

665
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:46,734
Aah!

666
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:53,875
What do you think
about these shirts, Mordecai?

667
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:55,275
Ah, a shirt's a shirt.

668
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:56,677
I'm 80 years old.

669
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:59,213
Nobody cares
what clothes I wear.

670
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:19,734
So, after almost
my whole life as an orphan,

671
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,569
I turned 19, I went
searching for my family,

672
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:23,470
and I find them.
My father, he comes to me,

673
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:25,106
and he says,
"Meet your new mommy,

674
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,574
"meet your new sister.

675
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:27,708
We're going to Israel."

676
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:29,342
I say,
"What is Israel?"

677
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,444
He said, "This is
the Jewish homeland.

678
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:32,847
"It's a beautiful country.

679
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,017
"Palm trees.
The Mediterranean Sea.

680
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,752
It's nice weather."

681
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:40,788
- Sounds like a nice change.
- Eh, that's what I thought.

682
00:38:40,922 --> 00:38:43,157
But, when we arrive,
after six week travel,

683
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:45,325
they hand me a rifle,
they put me in the front lines

684
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:48,395
of the 1956
Arab-Israeli War.

685
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:50,865
I don't even know
who I'm fighting.

686
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:52,667
Oh, my God, Mordecai,
that's terrible.

687
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,335
- I'm so sorry that you--
- Oh, no-no-no-no...

688
00:38:55,468 --> 00:38:57,337
no, I'm not complaining.

689
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,140
No, no, look at
where we are now, huh?

690
00:38:59,273 --> 00:39:03,845
It's a beautiful city.
Beautiful art, huh?

691
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:09,050
So... why you never talk
about yourself?

692
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:10,785
Huh?

693
00:39:12,653 --> 00:39:14,689
I wish I could do
work like this.

694
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:17,490
But my paintings don't exist
in the real world.

695
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:21,829
They're all digital.
In the cloud.

696
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:23,965
I am painter.

697
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:26,399
Mordecai, you never told me
you were an artist.

698
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:28,870
Nah, well,
it's easier than iPhone.

699
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,948
Mr. Samel.

700
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:43,184
Oh, hi, Jerry.

701
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:45,253
It's Jared, Mr. Samel.

702
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,288
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, you know

703
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,923
Ray's Original?

704
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:51,125
Right across
from Pretzelmaker?

705
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:52,660
Right across from Taffy Swirl?

706
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:54,328
Have you ever stood
in the exact spot

707
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:55,930
where all three smells collide?

708
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:58,498
I stopped smelling
in my 70s.

709
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,902
It was--
It was a joke, Mr. Samel.

710
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,402
Oh...

711
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:04,338
Check it out.

712
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:06,707
I'm doing a set
at the Tea & Poets.

713
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:10,344
- You might wanna come?
- You're standing up?

714
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:12,513
Yeah, for as long as
they let me.

715
00:40:13,614 --> 00:40:14,849
So, where's Nina?

716
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:16,617
Nina-- she's
at her other gig.

717
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:19,587
Volunteering at
the Jewish Community Center.

718
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,822
I no know she work there.

719
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,660
- Why the JCC?
- I don't know.

720
00:40:25,793 --> 00:40:27,962
Anyway, she said
you gotta get some tunes

721
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:30,463
back in your life.
Follow me.

722
00:40:30,598 --> 00:40:33,668
Have you ever road-tested
a pair of Beats?

723
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:35,636
- What is that?
- Are you kidding?

724
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,672
You-- You've never--

725
00:40:37,805 --> 00:40:40,675
holy shit, may I see
your phone, Mr. Samel?

726
00:40:42,243 --> 00:40:43,476
It's-- I Mordecai.

727
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:45,046
Mordecai, I imagine

728
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:46,614
- you're a classical music man?
- Yeah.

729
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:48,649
But I--
I prefer klezmer.

730
00:40:48,783 --> 00:40:50,518
This is old Jewish music,

731
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:52,386
mostly gone by now.

732
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,755
No such thing as gone
on the internet.

733
00:40:57,024 --> 00:40:58,326
Listen, Mordecai.

734
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,227
Yeah.

735
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:05,633
Ooh...

736
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:13,040
Ooh!

737
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:17,278
Oh, this is
like morning sunrise

738
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:19,947
over the fucking
wheat fields!

739
00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:34,829
Mordecai?

740
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:37,098
You have to pay for that!

741
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:47,041
...bocce ball tournament?

742
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:50,277
How great is...

743
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:52,046
I can't hear you.

744
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:02,256
What is this?

745
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,558
Oh!

746
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:11,932
Hello, this Siri?

747
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:13,868
<i>What can I help you with?</i>

748
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:19,440
Oh, hello.

749
00:42:19,573 --> 00:42:21,475
- You are Siri?
- <i>Yes, I'm Siri.</i>

750
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:22,943
<i>Here to help.</i>

751
00:42:23,077 --> 00:42:24,779
Oh, Siri,
that's a nice name.

752
00:42:24,912 --> 00:42:27,681
- How are you today?
- <i>I'm fine, thank you.</i>

753
00:42:27,815 --> 00:42:30,184
Your friend Nina,
she tell me to call you.

754
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:32,620
Maybe you can take me
to this place.

755
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:36,924
1293 Bantam Avenue, Miami.

756
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:41,162
<i>Getting directions</i>
<i>to 1293 Bantam Avenue, Miami.</i>

757
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:44,899
<i>May I say-- you have</i>
<i>a beautiful voice.</i>

758
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:47,668
<i>I keep this secret,</i>
<i>because my wife don't know.</i>

759
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:49,837
<i>She get jealous.</i>

760
00:42:56,511 --> 00:42:57,878
Mordecai, you made it.

761
00:42:58,012 --> 00:43:01,282
Ah, I take phone taxi
all by myself.

762
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:03,050
So proud of you.

763
00:43:03,184 --> 00:43:04,418
Come on in.

764
00:43:04,553 --> 00:43:06,487
So... this is yours?

765
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,090
- Yes.
- Ahh.

766
00:43:09,223 --> 00:43:11,826
You need painter?
I'm a painter.

767
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:13,627
Well, then let's get started.

768
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:15,530
- This way.
- Yeah.

769
00:43:55,002 --> 00:43:56,971
Oh, my God, Mordecai,
this is beautiful.

770
00:43:57,104 --> 00:43:58,806
- What do you think?
- I love it.

771
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:00,441
- Yeah?
- I mean,

772
00:44:00,575 --> 00:44:02,109
you told me you painted,
but I didn't know you painted

773
00:44:02,243 --> 00:44:03,911
- like this--
- Oh, I paint houses.

774
00:44:04,044 --> 00:44:06,581
- You're an artist.
- Yeah-- no, oh,

775
00:44:06,714 --> 00:44:08,849
no, I-- well,
I used to make paintings,

776
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:10,885
but this is
a first mural.

777
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:13,454
- So, I teach you...
- I teach you.

778
00:44:13,588 --> 00:44:16,390
- That's a deal.
- That's a deal.

779
00:44:55,664 --> 00:44:57,298
Netta?

780
00:44:58,533 --> 00:45:00,234
Hey.

781
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,303
Pedro delivered these
this morning.

782
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:06,173
Well, guess there's
no time like the present.

783
00:45:23,857 --> 00:45:25,459
Here we go.

784
00:45:39,273 --> 00:45:42,109
Smells good.
What do you think?

785
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:55,322
Marvin, honey,
what do you think?

786
00:45:56,357 --> 00:45:59,293
It's not ready.

787
00:46:01,495 --> 00:46:03,931
And your dad's here.

788
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:07,434
- Ah, Netta.
- Dad, what're you doing here?

789
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:10,804
Well, I wish to go to this--
what you call it--

790
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:13,007
stand-up comic event tonight.

791
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,109
- What?
- So, uh...

792
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:17,211
Mrs. Gomez, she has a date
with this weaselly man,

793
00:46:17,344 --> 00:46:20,080
so I got the problem
with your mother.

794
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:22,349
- What's the problem?
- Well...

795
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:25,319
can she come here
this evening for a while?

796
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:27,187
And maybe she help
with the children.

797
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,923
Dad, I prefer to be here
when Mom's here, okay?

798
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:32,493
And besides,
tonight is my big cigar event.

799
00:46:32,627 --> 00:46:34,795
Your event... you mean,

800
00:46:34,928 --> 00:46:36,430
when you make big speeches
about cigars

801
00:46:36,564 --> 00:46:38,533
and give 'em out
for nothing like an imbecile,

802
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:42,269
and then everybody drinks
brandy, which you also pay for?

803
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,838
Yeah, that's about
exactly right.

804
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:47,074
Except that it's bourbon.
I'll tell you what.

805
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:49,143
I'll make you a deal:
you don't talk

806
00:46:49,276 --> 00:46:51,011
about the cigar business
for 24 hours,

807
00:46:51,145 --> 00:46:52,781
- and I'll make it happen.
- You got it.

808
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:54,315
I go get her.

809
00:46:54,448 --> 00:46:56,950
But can you get her here
by, like, 6:00?

810
00:46:57,084 --> 00:46:59,386
Mordecai... ha-ha.

811
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:02,856
How long I supposed to be
waiting in that phone taxi?

812
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,559
All right--
there she is, I go.

813
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:07,796
Marvin, no!
I have my monthly

814
00:47:07,928 --> 00:47:10,831
Mommy and Me
dinner tonight.

815
00:47:10,964 --> 00:47:13,067
Hi!

816
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,968
That's my girl.

817
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:17,672
- Hi!
- More beautiful than always.

818
00:47:17,806 --> 00:47:19,507
You too!

819
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:21,743
Where are those babies now?

820
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:23,745
Sleeping.

821
00:47:23,877 --> 00:47:27,381
I-I go find them,
I go inside.

822
00:47:29,049 --> 00:47:31,686
And now, next comic,

823
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,789
welcome Jared Barrett.

824
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:39,594
Yeah!

825
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:45,866
Hi, uh...

826
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:48,068
there's a lot of people here.

827
00:47:52,072 --> 00:47:54,709
All these people for you.

828
00:47:54,843 --> 00:47:56,910
Yeah, that's good.

829
00:47:57,044 --> 00:47:58,646
Shit!

830
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,347
What is? What?

831
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:03,083
You see the man over there
with the suit jacket on?

832
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:05,587
See, the bigger guy?

833
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,154
That's Fernando Vasquez.

834
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:08,823
He's a potential buyer
for my company.

835
00:48:08,956 --> 00:48:10,357
I did not know
he was coming tonight.

836
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:13,494
Yeah? It's good for you
I say hello.

837
00:48:13,628 --> 00:48:15,797
No, Ma,
he's a potential buyer!

838
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:18,365
Yeah, a sales opportunity.

839
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:20,602
I say hello.

840
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,469
Marvin, what's up, bro?

841
00:48:22,604 --> 00:48:24,171
- Hey.
- How you doin', guy?

842
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:25,840
- How you doin', man?
- Yeah, good to see you.

843
00:48:25,973 --> 00:48:27,776
- Ton of people here to see ya.
- Thank you so much.

844
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:29,143
Hi, how are you, hello.

845
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:30,712
Hi, thank you so much
for coming.

846
00:48:30,845 --> 00:48:33,046
Thank you...

847
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,915
Marvin, you see

848
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:36,651
who your mother is
walking up to?

849
00:48:36,785 --> 00:48:38,986
That guy Fernando,
he may look like a schlub,

850
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,421
but he is a fucking killer.

851
00:48:40,555 --> 00:48:43,223
Hello, I am
Marvin Samel's mother.

852
00:48:43,357 --> 00:48:44,793
- Oh.
- Oy.

853
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:46,795
I wanna
thank everyone for coming out

854
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:48,295
to Empire Social tonight.

855
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:50,998
It's an important night,
and I wanna introduce

856
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:53,167
my friend and yours,

857
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,968
from Fumore Cigar Company,

858
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:57,539
Mr. Marvin Samel.

859
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:08,215
Thank you very much, Ryan,
thank you for putting

860
00:49:08,348 --> 00:49:09,751
this night together.
I really appreciate it.

861
00:49:09,884 --> 00:49:12,654
...on NPR, they're saying
that the digital age

862
00:49:12,787 --> 00:49:15,723
is making the human
attention span shorter.

863
00:49:16,891 --> 00:49:20,494
Hey! I hear this joint has
great craft beers.

864
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:24,131
So, I don't know
what they're talkin' about.

865
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:26,266
Okay, tough crowd, uh...

866
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,402
- You suck!
- Oh, what else to say...

867
00:49:28,536 --> 00:49:30,070
All right,
the third cigar

868
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:32,272
we're gonna smoke tonight,
the wrapper is

869
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:36,143
a medium dark broadleaf
grown in Ecuador.

870
00:49:36,276 --> 00:49:39,681
I'm sorry, no, it's--
it's a San Andreas negra

871
00:49:39,814 --> 00:49:41,248
grown in Nicaragua.

872
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:43,651
- That what he meant to say.
- Okay.

873
00:49:43,785 --> 00:49:45,452
He's struggling.

874
00:49:47,689 --> 00:49:49,958
So, uh... God,

875
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:51,659
- uh...
- Marvin.

876
00:49:51,793 --> 00:49:54,896
So everyone has enjoyed
your cigars for many years,

877
00:49:55,028 --> 00:49:57,565
and you know, we wanna know
how you got into the business.

878
00:49:57,699 --> 00:49:59,333
I mean, you brought your mom
with you tonight,

879
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:02,236
and I think it's great--
is this a family business?

880
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:04,004
Is that you started in cigars?

881
00:50:04,137 --> 00:50:06,240
Are you kidding me?
My father was a plumber.

882
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:09,076
And also house painter,
painted houses.

883
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:12,179
Yes, and a painter.
Sometimes both at once.

884
00:50:12,312 --> 00:50:14,849
I heard that guy
talking about how he...

885
00:50:14,983 --> 00:50:16,183
hates his mother?

886
00:50:16,316 --> 00:50:18,452
Uh...

887
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:23,457
- Oy vey.
- You suck!

888
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:25,492
I go help Jerry.

889
00:50:25,627 --> 00:50:27,060
What?

890
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:29,597
- Don't worry.
- No-- Mordecai!

891
00:50:29,731 --> 00:50:31,365
- I hear--
- Jerry!

892
00:50:31,498 --> 00:50:33,233
Yeah?

893
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:36,604
Hey, Jerry,
what are you doing?

894
00:50:36,738 --> 00:50:38,405
Uh, dying.

895
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,807
Oh.

896
00:50:39,941 --> 00:50:42,777
Why don't you talk
about something that you know?

897
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:44,211
Do you have a funny story?

898
00:50:44,344 --> 00:50:48,148
Um, my mom's printer
jammed last night.

899
00:50:48,282 --> 00:50:51,084
Well, I show you.

900
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,089
Hello? I Mordecai.

901
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:57,959
I tell you story.

902
00:50:58,091 --> 00:51:00,695
You might like.

903
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:03,932
I was once a plumber
in Canarsie, Brooklyn.

904
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:09,202
So I'm finishing installation
of the sink for Mrs. Green.

905
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:12,874
- She says to me--
- Beautiful job, Mordecai.

906
00:51:13,007 --> 00:51:14,909
Tell me,
you know where I can find

907
00:51:15,043 --> 00:51:16,476
a good house painter?

908
00:51:16,611 --> 00:51:18,913
I wanna paint the whole house,
the whole thing.

909
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:20,582
Ooh.
I say, Mrs. Green,

910
00:51:20,715 --> 00:51:21,883
I paint it too.

911
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:24,418
I will paint all four
of your apartments,

912
00:51:24,552 --> 00:51:27,287
Including the basement.
I'll give you a good price.

913
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:30,058
She says to me,
"But, Mordecai,

914
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:33,160
you are plumber.
You are not a painter."

915
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:36,564
So I think for, mm...

916
00:51:36,698 --> 00:51:39,266
all right, if you don't
want to use me,

917
00:51:39,399 --> 00:51:41,401
perhaps you should call
my brother Martin,

918
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:43,337
who is a very good painter.

919
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,707
The best painter
in all of Canarsie, Brooklyn.

920
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,408
You have a brother?

921
00:51:48,543 --> 00:51:50,812
Of course.
All my life.

922
00:51:50,945 --> 00:51:52,680
So she says, "All right,

923
00:51:52,814 --> 00:51:54,448
"give me the number
of your brother Martin,

924
00:51:54,582 --> 00:51:56,517
I will call him."
So, I run back home--

925
00:51:56,651 --> 00:51:59,219
So my father comes home,
he says, "If Mrs. Green...

926
00:51:59,353 --> 00:52:02,456
"calls your line,
looking for Martin the Painter,

927
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,626
you give to me the phone."

928
00:52:04,759 --> 00:52:06,628
I'm looking at him,
like, Martin the Painter,

929
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:08,395
I don't understand.
He says, "Don't ask

930
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:11,599
- no fucking questions!"
- Don't ask-- Don't ask!

931
00:52:11,733 --> 00:52:13,534
"Mrs. Green calls?
To me you give the phone."

932
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:15,202
- Mm.
- Of course, so now,

933
00:52:15,335 --> 00:52:16,671
it's ringing,
and he's chasing after me,

934
00:52:16,804 --> 00:52:19,107
"Pick up,
pick up your phone!"

935
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:21,075
So, I'm terrified,
I'm panicked,

936
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,543
I answer the phone, "Hello?"

937
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:25,312
So, I look at my father.

938
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:27,649
I'm like, "Really, Dad,
Martin the Painter?"

939
00:52:27,782 --> 00:52:29,584
He smacks me before
he takes the phone.

940
00:52:29,717 --> 00:52:32,820
He says, "Yes, yes,
Mordecai is my brother."

941
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:34,656
Yes, I can come over
and give estimate.

942
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:36,524
And then he looks at me,
and he winks,

943
00:52:36,658 --> 00:52:38,325
and he says,
"Oh, directions?

944
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:41,062
No, it's all right,
Mordecai's here, I ask him."

945
00:52:44,398 --> 00:52:46,100
- So...
- I get out...

946
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:47,769
of my green
plumbing uniform,

947
00:52:47,902 --> 00:52:51,005
and I put on the white pants
and the white shirt,

948
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:53,240
and I steal my son's hat

949
00:52:53,373 --> 00:52:54,909
and run back
to Mrs. Green.

950
00:52:55,043 --> 00:52:57,210
I come in the door, I say,

951
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:00,247
hello, Mrs. Green,
I am Martin the Painter.

952
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,618
My God, you look
just like your brother.

953
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:06,154
I say, of course,
we are twins.

954
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:11,025
This is all a true story.

955
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:12,827
- Ma, am I right?
- Please, now,

956
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,563
don't even remind me.

957
00:53:15,697 --> 00:53:17,165
So, the next week--

958
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:19,266
Martin, Martin, quick!

959
00:53:19,399 --> 00:53:21,169
Call your brother Mordecai!

960
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:22,670
There's a flood in the basement!

961
00:53:22,804 --> 00:53:24,539
Don't worry, I'll take care
of it right away!

962
00:53:24,672 --> 00:53:27,207
No, no, Martin,
you are the painter!

963
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,376
I need Mordecai the Plumber!

964
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:32,046
- I was-- I'll go get him.
- Oy.

965
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,115
In comes my father,
still got the white

966
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:36,316
painters' pants on,
goes to big plumber's pants,

967
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,186
and bang,
he's out the door again.

968
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:40,487
And she says,
"But where is Martin?

969
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:42,322
He not finished yet!"

970
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:45,593
No, that's all right.
He'll be back tomorrow.

971
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:48,295
Meanwhile, I'll fix
your flood today, huh?

972
00:53:50,932 --> 00:53:53,735
And that's
how he made a living.

973
00:53:53,868 --> 00:53:55,268
For 20 years.

974
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:57,572
So I was plumber, painter,

975
00:53:57,705 --> 00:53:59,974
Mordecai,
Martin Samel.

976
00:54:00,108 --> 00:54:03,410
Two phone lines,
two business cards, two names.

977
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:05,213
And no one in Canarsie

978
00:54:05,345 --> 00:54:07,615
ever knew the difference
for 20 years.

979
00:54:07,749 --> 00:54:09,817
And until this moment,
right now,

980
00:54:09,951 --> 00:54:12,385
no one until this day
ever found out.

981
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:19,927
I like this.

982
00:54:20,061 --> 00:54:22,230
- I send Maria...
- Uh-huh?

983
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:24,098
my recipe for couscous...

984
00:54:24,232 --> 00:54:26,500
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- But that's secret.

985
00:54:26,634 --> 00:54:28,569
Okay, no-no, she's gonna do
a great job with that.

986
00:54:28,703 --> 00:54:32,073
And let me tell you,
Fernando, you no worry

987
00:54:32,206 --> 00:54:35,176
about these other cigar guys

988
00:54:35,308 --> 00:54:37,812
wishing to buy
Marvin's company.

989
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:40,715
First of all,
that only rumor.

990
00:54:40,848 --> 00:54:43,951
- Oh.
- And I going to tell Marvin

991
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:46,486
you're mensch, okay?

992
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:48,790
Thank you, Fela.

993
00:54:48,923 --> 00:54:50,525
- Don't worry.
- Good to see you.

994
00:54:50,658 --> 00:54:52,727
I will not worry.
I've had a delightful time

995
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,630
- with your mother all night.
- We talking so much.

996
00:54:55,763 --> 00:54:57,732
I'm thinking that maybe...

997
00:54:57,865 --> 00:55:00,201
let's close this deal
and buy your company.

998
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:02,335
Marvin, this is smart man.

999
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:04,071
Whoa, great,
yeah, absolutely.

1000
00:55:04,205 --> 00:55:06,674
I'll have my attorney
set up the meeting.

1001
00:55:06,808 --> 00:55:08,475
- Okay, great.
- Huh?

1002
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:11,279
- You see how smart?
- Fela, you are a gem.

1003
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:12,947
Oh, you too.

1004
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,448
- Okay, love to Maria, right?
- Take care.

1005
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:16,918
And I'll be
seeing you very soon.

1006
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:19,520
- Yes, Fernando, thank you.
- All right.

1007
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:22,657
What did you say to him?

1008
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,424
Him our friend now, you know?

1009
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,427
Sometimes Yiddish
help out better

1010
00:55:27,562 --> 00:55:30,665
than fancy degree
from college.

1011
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:33,500
I guess so.
I guess so.

1012
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:35,870
I tired now.
We go home now.

1013
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:37,538
- Okay, come on.
- We go home now.

1014
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:39,140
Anybody else
you wanna talk to?

1015
00:55:39,273 --> 00:55:40,808
- No, done.
- Okay.

1016
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,689
Fela?

1017
00:55:56,224 --> 00:55:57,959
Fela?

1018
00:56:03,798 --> 00:56:05,666
Fela?

1019
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,086
- <i>Hey, Dad.</i>
- Hey, Marvin?

1020
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:26,453
Is your mother there?

1021
00:56:26,587 --> 00:56:28,488
Is she still with you?

1022
00:56:28,623 --> 00:56:30,925
<i>It's me, Mordecai.</i>

1023
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,392
<i>It was amazing.</i>

1024
00:56:32,526 --> 00:56:33,895
<i>Mom got us the deal!</i>

1025
00:56:34,028 --> 00:56:35,963
- What?
- <i>The cigar deal!</i>

1026
00:56:36,097 --> 00:56:38,498
<i>It's a lock. They're not waiting</i>
<i>until the cigars are ready.</i>

1027
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:40,701
<i>They want the company now.</i>

1028
00:56:40,835 --> 00:56:43,170
Well, congratulations!

1029
00:56:43,304 --> 00:56:46,173
Why don't you come here,
and you'll celebrate?

1030
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:47,975
<i>Listen, it's late.</i>

1031
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:49,911
<i>I thought it would be nice</i>
<i>for Mom to spend the night</i>

1032
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:51,746
<i>and see the girls</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

1033
00:56:51,879 --> 00:56:54,949
But we not spend
the night apart, never.

1034
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:58,019
<i>Okay, love you, Dad.</i>

1035
00:57:22,543 --> 00:57:23,978
<i>"When the Nazis come,</i>

1036
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:26,180
<i>I will feed you</i>
<i>to Hitler myself."</i>

1037
00:57:30,217 --> 00:57:31,786
Ugh.

1038
00:59:08,049 --> 00:59:09,183
Mama?

1039
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:13,421
Mama!

1040
00:59:21,996 --> 00:59:24,765
Mama!

1041
01:00:01,635 --> 01:00:03,671
Fela.

1042
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,276
You just came back just now?

1043
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:10,911
Yeah.

1044
01:00:11,045 --> 01:00:12,947
- Oh.
- Mordecai,

1045
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,216
what's going on with you?

1046
01:00:18,652 --> 01:00:20,721
Ah, it's...
old memories,

1047
01:00:20,855 --> 01:00:23,290
I... think too much.

1048
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:26,961
Mm. Fela...

1049
01:00:28,395 --> 01:00:31,365
sit down.
Sit here.

1050
01:00:35,336 --> 01:00:37,404
I...

1051
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:40,575
Fela...

1052
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:42,343
I have a confession.

1053
01:00:45,246 --> 01:00:48,816
I kept iPhone
against your wishes.

1054
01:00:50,151 --> 01:00:52,621
Also, I...

1055
01:00:52,753 --> 01:00:55,524
I take lessons.
For learning.

1056
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:57,224
That's where I go

1057
01:00:57,358 --> 01:00:59,260
when I'm on my own.

1058
01:01:03,598 --> 01:01:05,399
Look, I feel...

1059
01:01:05,534 --> 01:01:07,434
like I'm becoming old man.

1060
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:11,372
This, I'm not ready for this.

1061
01:01:11,506 --> 01:01:13,974
I not ready to be old man.

1062
01:01:15,376 --> 01:01:18,245
Yeah, but, Mordecai...

1063
01:01:18,379 --> 01:01:21,348
you are old man.

1064
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:23,350
Huh?

1065
01:01:25,452 --> 01:01:27,755
That why you spending
all that time

1066
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:31,058
with the dark-haired lady?

1067
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:33,928
Oh, yeah, I...

1068
01:01:34,061 --> 01:01:37,031
I saw those lessons.

1069
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:40,734
Second floor, by pretzels.

1070
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:43,437
But only lessons.

1071
01:01:43,572 --> 01:01:46,173
Yes, only, yes.

1072
01:01:46,307 --> 01:01:48,142
Yeah!

1073
01:01:48,275 --> 01:01:50,411
Oh, yeah,
yeah-yeah-yeah...

1074
01:01:50,545 --> 01:01:52,346
it's only lessons.

1075
01:01:52,479 --> 01:01:54,481
That's all.

1076
01:01:54,616 --> 01:01:57,851
- Yeah, good.
- Uh-huh.

1077
01:01:57,985 --> 01:02:00,487
Because you know
something, Mordecai,

1078
01:02:00,622 --> 01:02:02,256
I love you.

1079
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:04,391
I love you too.
Thank you.

1080
01:02:06,293 --> 01:02:08,095
No-no, it's nice
you take me to big deal.

1081
01:02:08,229 --> 01:02:09,930
- But I no understand--
- Because it's a done deal.

1082
01:02:10,064 --> 01:02:12,199
Netta was right, I couldn't've
gotten here without you.

1083
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:14,268
- That right?
- Dad, what I'm trying

1084
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:16,638
to tell you,
is that I trust you.

1085
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:18,739
Yeah, but I--
I no understand.

1086
01:02:18,872 --> 01:02:20,975
The buyer was waiting
for the new cigar,

1087
01:02:21,108 --> 01:02:22,876
but now they don't have to?

1088
01:02:24,311 --> 01:02:26,113
Well, I don't know
what to tell ya.

1089
01:02:26,247 --> 01:02:28,650
Maybe they changed their mind,
I mean, that happens.

1090
01:02:28,782 --> 01:02:30,985
Oh, this is
too good to be true.

1091
01:02:31,118 --> 01:02:33,454
This is a crazy business.
You watch out.

1092
01:02:33,588 --> 01:02:36,658
Dad, maybe this trust thing
goes both ways.

1093
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:39,827
- Eh.
- Whoa, where are you going?

1094
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,295
I'm going
to the meeting with you.

1095
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:43,264
- I pick up my check.
- No, I need to do

1096
01:02:43,397 --> 01:02:44,798
this part on my own,
you wait here.

1097
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:46,400
After it's over,
we'll go to a nice,

1098
01:02:46,534 --> 01:02:48,802
- celebratory lunch, okay?
- I thought you trust me.

1099
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:52,139
I trust you,
just not that much.

1100
01:02:52,273 --> 01:02:54,074
Hm.

1101
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:57,044
All right, all right,
I go take a piss.

1102
01:03:14,696 --> 01:03:16,897
Oy, never turn 80.

1103
01:03:17,031 --> 01:03:20,467
Huh? Piss three times
during "Jeopardy."

1104
01:03:22,336 --> 01:03:24,171
You work
in the fancy office, hm?

1105
01:03:24,305 --> 01:03:26,907
My son,
he owns a cigar company.

1106
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:29,310
Fancy big-fish company's
going to buy.

1107
01:03:29,443 --> 01:03:30,578
Today, finally.

1108
01:03:30,712 --> 01:03:31,746
It was taking forever.

1109
01:03:31,879 --> 01:03:33,247
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1110
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,983
We had to wait
for the tobacco to be okay.

1111
01:03:36,116 --> 01:03:37,686
- Oh.
- So we wait and wait

1112
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:39,019
and wait
on the tobacco,

1113
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:40,655
until we almost go broke.

1114
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:43,792
We were hanging on
by the skin of our fingernails.

1115
01:03:43,924 --> 01:03:46,393
We could've gone kaput.

1116
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:47,961
Huh.

1117
01:03:48,095 --> 01:03:50,130
They literally pulled
the deal off the table.

1118
01:03:50,264 --> 01:03:51,865
<i>What?!</i>
<i>Why? What did they say?</i>

1119
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:54,669
I don't know, something about
bringing us another offer.

1120
01:03:54,803 --> 01:03:56,437
<i>What happened?</i>

1121
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:58,807
Netta, it's me, Mordecai.

1122
01:03:58,939 --> 01:04:00,608
Who knows?
Who knows what happened?

1123
01:04:00,742 --> 01:04:03,477
Huh? This cigar business is
a crazy way to make a living.

1124
01:04:03,611 --> 01:04:07,047
You. You happened.
You're a jinx.

1125
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:09,483
It was a done deal,
and your mere presence

1126
01:04:09,617 --> 01:04:11,820
fucked the cosmic tumblers,
again!

1127
01:04:11,952 --> 01:04:14,988
- <i>Marvin!</i>
- Yeah, Marvin!

1128
01:04:16,357 --> 01:04:17,891
What's going on
with you today?

1129
01:04:18,025 --> 01:04:20,361
You seem... down.

1130
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:24,566
Nah, nothing, eh...

1131
01:04:25,866 --> 01:04:28,035
I just feel like...

1132
01:04:29,704 --> 01:04:31,606
disappointment to my family.

1133
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:36,343
My wife, she believes
I'm a liar.

1134
01:04:36,477 --> 01:04:39,781
My son, he imagines
I'm a jinx on his life.

1135
01:04:39,913 --> 01:04:41,982
Why is that?

1136
01:04:43,585 --> 01:04:45,252
Well, years ago,

1137
01:04:45,386 --> 01:04:48,857
he bring me to a head shrinker
to find out.

1138
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:50,891
And the head shrinker...

1139
01:04:51,024 --> 01:04:54,361
he says since
I never had a childhood,

1140
01:04:54,495 --> 01:04:56,598
I don't want childhood
for my son.

1141
01:04:56,731 --> 01:04:58,733
I tell him to fuck off.

1142
01:04:58,867 --> 01:05:00,835
Of course you did.

1143
01:05:00,968 --> 01:05:02,469
Mm.

1144
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:05,439
But he's right.

1145
01:05:05,573 --> 01:05:08,242
I probably hard
on Marvin, I know.

1146
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:12,079
I just wanted him to have
better life than I had.

1147
01:05:13,615 --> 01:05:15,449
- That's all.
- Well, maybe

1148
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:17,585
you can tap
into what it was missing.

1149
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:19,486
Like, what is something

1150
01:05:19,621 --> 01:05:21,589
that you've always wanted to do,
since you were a kid,

1151
01:05:21,723 --> 01:05:23,924
but never got the chance to?

1152
01:05:25,392 --> 01:05:26,927
Ah.

1153
01:05:27,961 --> 01:05:29,463
You know...

1154
01:05:29,597 --> 01:05:33,300
I have inspiration now
to make more art.

1155
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:38,338
I would also like to remember
the face of my mother.

1156
01:05:44,612 --> 01:05:47,549
Okay, then... you work
on being a kid again

1157
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:50,217
so that you can remember
your mother's face

1158
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,986
and become
a better father to your son.

1159
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:55,924
You think that would work?

1160
01:05:56,758 --> 01:05:59,226
I think that "vould vork."

1161
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:05,466
- There you go, sir.
- Thank you very much.

1162
01:06:08,101 --> 01:06:10,337
...and I don't know
what that mean.

1163
01:06:10,471 --> 01:06:13,407
- I wanted two...
- Oh, thanks.

1164
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:15,643
So, uh, Dad...

1165
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:18,312
what's with the ice cream?

1166
01:06:18,445 --> 01:06:21,081
Ice cream? Makes you feel
like a kid again.

1167
01:06:21,215 --> 01:06:23,083
- Huh?
- What?

1168
01:06:23,217 --> 01:06:25,787
Ice cream,
it make you feel young.

1169
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,188
- Ice cream make me feel young.
- Ya big--

1170
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:31,559
married to a big baby
make me feel young.

1171
01:06:32,961 --> 01:06:34,328
Martin?

1172
01:06:34,461 --> 01:06:36,564
I-I would recognize

1173
01:06:36,698 --> 01:06:38,365
that hat anywhere.

1174
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:41,769
It's Mrs. Green,
from Canarsie!

1175
01:06:41,903 --> 01:06:44,238
Oh, yeah, Mrs. Green.

1176
01:06:44,371 --> 01:06:46,674
This other brother, Mordecai.

1177
01:06:46,808 --> 01:06:50,812
Oh, Mordecai,
it's so good to see you.

1178
01:06:50,945 --> 01:06:53,548
Oh, my goodness, oh, my--

1179
01:06:53,681 --> 01:06:55,115
and little Marvin,

1180
01:06:55,249 --> 01:06:58,151
you were just a little boy
the last time I saw you.

1181
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,957
So, tell me,
what are you doing here?

1182
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:05,760
Well, we live here,
in Point East.

1183
01:07:05,894 --> 01:07:07,695
I live next door!

1184
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:09,162
In Williams Island.

1185
01:07:09,296 --> 01:07:11,231
- What do you know?
- We're neighbors again.

1186
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:13,166
- After all these years.
- Yeah, yeah.

1187
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:16,336
Mordecai, tell me...

1188
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:19,206
how's your brother Martin?

1189
01:07:19,339 --> 01:07:21,375
Martin? Oh.

1190
01:07:21,509 --> 01:07:23,711
Not so good.
He dead.

1191
01:07:23,845 --> 01:07:25,312
Oh!

1192
01:07:25,445 --> 01:07:27,682
Oh... my beautiful Martin.

1193
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:29,449
Well, listen,
we-- we have to go,

1194
01:07:29,584 --> 01:07:31,051
because we have
an appointment,

1195
01:07:31,184 --> 01:07:33,621
very important.
We must go now, come on.

1196
01:07:33,755 --> 01:07:36,356
Yeah, we go-- sorry.
Goodbye, Mrs. Green.

1197
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:37,625
Goodbye.

1198
01:07:37,759 --> 01:07:39,426
Why would you tell
that nice little old lady

1199
01:07:39,561 --> 01:07:41,461
that your twin imaginary
brother is dead?

1200
01:07:41,596 --> 01:07:43,163
- It's mean!
- I'm retired.

1201
01:07:43,297 --> 01:07:45,232
Why do I have to go on
living this lie?

1202
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:47,301
Shut the fuck up,
eat your ice cream.

1203
01:07:47,434 --> 01:07:49,403
Good boy, come on.

1204
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:04,852
What?

1205
01:08:04,986 --> 01:08:06,253
Yeah, I talking to you,

1206
01:08:06,386 --> 01:08:08,121
you no pay attention to me.

1207
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:09,857
Oh, sorry-sorry-sorry.

1208
01:08:09,991 --> 01:08:12,794
I was, um, busy with, um...

1209
01:08:13,962 --> 01:08:15,530
Take a look.

1210
01:08:21,636 --> 01:08:24,304
You make me look so young.

1211
01:08:42,857 --> 01:08:44,491
Hm?

1212
01:08:46,527 --> 01:08:48,462
Heh, that's me.

1213
01:08:48,596 --> 01:08:51,666
I'm Mordecai.
I'm the exhibitionist, yeah.

1214
01:08:51,799 --> 01:08:55,837
Ho! Nina!
Jared, don't go away!

1215
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:58,006
I'm exhibitionist!

1216
01:08:58,138 --> 01:09:00,708
I don't know,
I don't...

1217
01:09:00,842 --> 01:09:02,977
Super Mordecai.
You're looking all spry.

1218
01:09:03,111 --> 01:09:06,080
Yeah, it's a nice day--
here, take a look, huh?

1219
01:09:06,213 --> 01:09:07,982
I-- I exhibitionist.

1220
01:09:08,116 --> 01:09:10,150
- Exhibitionist.
- Yeah.

1221
01:09:10,283 --> 01:09:12,319
- I don't think that's--
- Sure, you are.

1222
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:14,589
I'll remember
to avert my eyes.

1223
01:09:14,722 --> 01:09:16,691
Oh! I'm having a party,
you should come.

1224
01:09:16,824 --> 01:09:19,426
I don't remember the last time
I went to a party.

1225
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,830
Well, we'll see.
I very busy, handing out flyers.

1226
01:09:23,865 --> 01:09:25,767
Hello in there!

1227
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,467
I see you!

1228
01:09:27,602 --> 01:09:29,804
Here.

1229
01:09:29,937 --> 01:09:32,073
- Huh?
- Art?

1230
01:09:32,205 --> 01:09:35,943
There's a brand new style of art
called "geezer art."

1231
01:09:36,077 --> 01:09:38,146
You may be interested, huh?

1232
01:09:38,278 --> 01:09:40,148
Oh, don't throw away.

1233
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,917
This may be worth
something someday, huh?

1234
01:09:43,051 --> 01:09:44,719
Eh?

1235
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,562
Hello.

1236
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:46,279
Mama.

1237
01:10:48,281 --> 01:10:51,152
There's a party later today.

1238
01:10:51,284 --> 01:10:53,187
At Jerry Einstein's place.

1239
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,989
You know who he is.

1240
01:10:55,123 --> 01:10:57,191
One of the Einsteins, yeah.

1241
01:10:57,324 --> 01:10:59,660
So I want you should
come with me.

1242
01:11:00,795 --> 01:11:03,263
- No.
- Yeah, yeah, come on.

1243
01:11:03,396 --> 01:11:06,601
- I do.
- Yeah, you know, Mordecai...

1244
01:11:06,734 --> 01:11:10,004
ah, no,
I-I very tired tonight.

1245
01:11:10,138 --> 01:11:12,073
Maybe another time, though.

1246
01:11:12,206 --> 01:11:14,242
All right, okay.

1247
01:11:14,374 --> 01:11:16,343
No, we'll watch
television together.

1248
01:11:16,476 --> 01:11:18,212
- You want grape?
- Thank you.

1249
01:11:18,345 --> 01:11:20,548
That one look good.

1250
01:11:24,919 --> 01:11:27,320
Okay, you know,
you-you go,

1251
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:30,423
but you only stay
one hour, right?

1252
01:11:30,558 --> 01:11:32,860
This is okay for me, to go?

1253
01:11:32,994 --> 01:11:34,461
Yeah.

1254
01:11:34,595 --> 01:11:36,463
But only one hour.

1255
01:11:36,597 --> 01:11:38,266
I promise, one hour.

1256
01:12:18,206 --> 01:12:20,440
Mordecai?

1257
01:12:30,618 --> 01:12:31,986
When I was your age,

1258
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:35,056
I drove barge
on the Dead Sea in Israel.

1259
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:37,825
1957, 1970.

1260
01:12:37,959 --> 01:12:41,896
Elvis Presley comes and goes,
I'm driving the barge.

1261
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:44,599
Vietnam War,
it comes and goes,

1262
01:12:44,732 --> 01:12:46,868
I'm still driving the barge.

1263
01:12:47,001 --> 01:12:48,970
They get the man
on the moon, yeah,

1264
01:12:49,103 --> 01:12:51,172
I'm still driving barge.

1265
01:12:52,974 --> 01:12:55,442
Only vacation I get
is in 1967,

1266
01:12:55,576 --> 01:12:58,145
and that was to fight
in the Six-Day War.

1267
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:01,682
I don't even get
a whole week, hmm?

1268
01:13:01,816 --> 01:13:04,585
Only six days?

1269
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,954
I need a longer war.

1270
01:13:07,088 --> 01:13:09,523
Mordecai, no talking,
just smoking.

1271
01:13:09,657 --> 01:13:12,326
Oh...

1272
01:13:12,492 --> 01:13:14,562
Last time I smoked,
it was hashish.

1273
01:13:14,695 --> 01:13:16,330
I was driving army truck

1274
01:13:16,463 --> 01:13:17,965
right across Egypt.

1275
01:13:22,303 --> 01:13:23,571
<i>It's a big drop</i>

1276
01:13:23,704 --> 01:13:25,106
<i>if you get this one wrong.</i>

1277
01:13:25,239 --> 01:13:27,575
<i>I know, I'm just...</i>

1278
01:14:05,613 --> 01:14:07,682
<i>...the home side</i>
<i>has something going now,</i>

1279
01:14:07,815 --> 01:14:09,750
<i>and the crowd is loving it.</i>

1280
01:14:12,887 --> 01:14:14,622
<i>It's the bottom</i>
<i>of the eighth inning,</i>

1281
01:14:14,755 --> 01:14:17,558
<i>and so far it's been</i>
<i>a very tight game.</i>

1282
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:20,828
Mrs. Samel, wait!

1283
01:14:20,962 --> 01:14:23,064
Stay there!
Wait!

1284
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:34,408
It's interesting,
you are this young girl

1285
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:36,444
who is interested
in the older generation.

1286
01:14:36,577 --> 01:14:38,612
You're very special girl, Nina.

1287
01:14:38,746 --> 01:14:40,548
Very special.

1288
01:14:40,681 --> 01:14:42,416
I'm really not, so--

1289
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:44,518
I say you are,
so you are.

1290
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:48,488
You are the nicest girl
I ever met

1291
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:50,624
in the entire world.

1292
01:14:53,027 --> 01:14:55,096
Listen...

1293
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:58,699
there is something
I've been meaning to tell you

1294
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:01,936
- for a while.
- Yeah?

1295
01:15:02,069 --> 01:15:03,804
Mm-hm?

1296
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,814
So, what is this?

1297
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:17,518
My grandfather.

1298
01:15:25,459 --> 01:15:27,361
You know...

1299
01:15:27,495 --> 01:15:29,163
I left my phone...

1300
01:15:29,296 --> 01:15:31,599
No, just...

1301
01:15:36,704 --> 01:15:39,273
my grandfather was
an SS officer.

1302
01:15:42,076 --> 01:15:45,179
He was a guard at Treblinka.

1303
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:50,785
He died a couple months ago...

1304
01:15:50,918 --> 01:15:53,220
I came home
from school to...

1305
01:15:53,354 --> 01:15:56,123
help my mom and dad
with his house.

1306
01:15:57,725 --> 01:16:00,161
There was
a box in his basement.

1307
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:02,196
A hidden locker.

1308
01:16:02,329 --> 01:16:06,133
And it had his documents
in it, a uniform.

1309
01:16:08,102 --> 01:16:10,539
Your parents,
they knew this?

1310
01:16:10,671 --> 01:16:12,640
My mom didn't.

1311
01:16:14,075 --> 01:16:16,511
And my dad, I mean,
he says he didn't know,

1312
01:16:16,644 --> 01:16:18,879
but it was his father.

1313
01:16:19,914 --> 01:16:21,949
How could he not?

1314
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:26,053
And then I met you, and...

1315
01:16:26,187 --> 01:16:27,788
you told me
how your aunts didn't

1316
01:16:27,922 --> 01:16:29,790
survive Treblinka.

1317
01:16:30,559 --> 01:16:32,693
The Jewish Center.

1318
01:16:34,628 --> 01:16:36,531
Mm.

1319
01:16:36,664 --> 01:16:40,234
800,000 Jews
they took to Treblinka.

1320
01:16:40,367 --> 01:16:43,070
Only a few dozen got out.

1321
01:16:46,307 --> 01:16:49,043
You're young, see?

1322
01:16:50,344 --> 01:16:52,379
It's your curse.

1323
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:56,784
I don't know how you could
understand anyway.

1324
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:00,589
You can't.

1325
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:02,256
No.

1326
01:17:02,389 --> 01:17:04,125
My dad found me.

1327
01:17:06,193 --> 01:17:08,262
He contacted me.

1328
01:17:08,395 --> 01:17:10,397
And...

1329
01:17:10,532 --> 01:17:12,500
he's coming here soon to...

1330
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:14,668
reconnect.

1331
01:17:14,802 --> 01:17:17,138
I don't know what to do.

1332
01:17:17,938 --> 01:17:19,673
Ask your phone.

1333
01:17:21,742 --> 01:17:23,244
Mordecai!

1334
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:28,315
Mordecai!
Messages.

1335
01:17:28,449 --> 01:17:31,352
On your phone.
It's about your wife.

1336
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:36,056
So, you've seen
a swelling in the brain...

1337
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:40,261
She'll be fine.

1338
01:17:41,729 --> 01:17:44,899
Mr. Samel, she's resting.

1339
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,402
Apparently
a car sideswiped her,

1340
01:17:48,537 --> 01:17:50,304
and she took a hard fall.

1341
01:17:51,205 --> 01:17:52,607
She's got a fractured arm,

1342
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,008
and we'll check
for a concussion,

1343
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:56,511
but I think she dodged
a bullet here.

1344
01:17:56,645 --> 01:17:59,146
Any idea why she was wandering

1345
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,216
on Biscayne Boulevard
in a nightgown?

1346
01:18:02,349 --> 01:18:04,553
Because...

1347
01:18:04,685 --> 01:18:06,754
I wasn't there.

1348
01:18:09,524 --> 01:18:13,060
Dad... can I talk to you
for a second in the hallway?

1349
01:18:21,603 --> 01:18:23,037
Dad, what were you doing?

1350
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:25,706
Where did you go?
You smell like a keg.

1351
01:18:25,839 --> 01:18:28,075
I was at the Einstein party.

1352
01:18:28,209 --> 01:18:29,644
The what?!

1353
01:18:29,777 --> 01:18:31,111
You know, the...

1354
01:18:31,245 --> 01:18:33,214
The-- The sales kid
Jared and Nina?

1355
01:18:33,347 --> 01:18:35,849
- Mm-hm.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

1356
01:18:35,983 --> 01:18:37,785
Dad, these are not
your friends.

1357
01:18:37,918 --> 01:18:40,988
Okay? I pay them
to teach you.

1358
01:18:41,989 --> 01:18:44,792
That's right, I pay Nina
to give you iPhone lessons,

1359
01:18:44,925 --> 01:18:46,427
okay, not to get you wasted

1360
01:18:46,561 --> 01:18:48,996
and have you out so Mom can
go wandering in the dark

1361
01:18:49,129 --> 01:18:50,731
and get hit by a car!

1362
01:18:50,864 --> 01:18:52,800
We're lucky
she wasn't killed.

1363
01:18:54,802 --> 01:18:57,238
Look, you're
an 80-year-old man.

1364
01:18:57,371 --> 01:18:59,373
Act like it.

1365
01:19:01,676 --> 01:19:03,578
I'll tell you something else.

1366
01:19:03,712 --> 01:19:05,246
The deal?

1367
01:19:05,379 --> 01:19:09,049
I'm gonna take the shitty deal
that they came back with.

1368
01:19:09,183 --> 01:19:11,085
Okay? So I can
pay you back

1369
01:19:11,218 --> 01:19:14,188
and not have to worry
about this shit anymore.

1370
01:19:32,873 --> 01:19:35,242
Oh, Fela...

1371
01:19:35,376 --> 01:19:37,311
what happened?

1372
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:45,219
I told you
I'd be back soon.

1373
01:19:47,555 --> 01:19:49,990
Why didn't you stay home?

1374
01:19:51,859 --> 01:19:54,028
Why didn't I?

1375
01:19:55,462 --> 01:19:58,832
Fela... I need you.

1376
01:20:08,777 --> 01:20:10,911
Mama.

1377
01:20:13,615 --> 01:20:16,050
I feel so...

1378
01:20:18,586 --> 01:20:20,387
sorry.

1379
01:20:40,608 --> 01:20:43,944
Ooh... mm.

1380
01:20:49,116 --> 01:20:52,152
Oh, ay-yi-yi-yi...

1381
01:20:54,522 --> 01:20:56,423
Mm-hm.

1382
01:21:22,349 --> 01:21:24,885
Marvin pay you to check on me?

1383
01:21:25,018 --> 01:21:26,887
How's your wife?

1384
01:21:28,455 --> 01:21:30,391
I tried calling.

1385
01:21:34,629 --> 01:21:36,930
Okay, he did pay me.

1386
01:21:37,064 --> 01:21:39,601
But only for the lessons.

1387
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:45,038
Mordecai, please,
I trust you.

1388
01:21:45,172 --> 01:21:46,940
Okay, and--
and you're my friend.

1389
01:21:47,074 --> 01:21:49,143
The money didn't buy that.

1390
01:21:50,444 --> 01:21:52,913
I don't know
any other way to say it.

1391
01:21:59,953 --> 01:22:02,956
Look, you should go.

1392
01:22:04,659 --> 01:22:06,594
My dad's here.

1393
01:22:06,728 --> 01:22:08,630
I know that it's selfish,
and I know that

1394
01:22:08,763 --> 01:22:10,931
the timing is terrible, but...

1395
01:22:12,966 --> 01:22:15,570
I need you, Mordecai.

1396
01:22:21,676 --> 01:22:23,912
Mordecai.

1397
01:22:24,044 --> 01:22:26,113
Let her in.

1398
01:22:29,983 --> 01:22:32,419
Come in, come in.

1399
01:22:36,056 --> 01:22:38,325
Now, looking at you...

1400
01:22:39,694 --> 01:22:42,429
I stupid old woman.

1401
01:22:44,298 --> 01:22:46,066
I jealous of you.

1402
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,268
And you--
you beautiful.

1403
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:50,839
But you just child.

1404
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:54,174
Well, and also no competition.

1405
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:57,010
Rumors at the mall say
you're a force of nature.

1406
01:22:57,144 --> 01:22:58,880
Oh-oh.

1407
01:22:59,012 --> 01:23:01,181
Okay.

1408
01:23:04,151 --> 01:23:07,020
So, Nina,
I hear your grandfather

1409
01:23:07,154 --> 01:23:09,557
was bigshot Nazi.

1410
01:23:14,094 --> 01:23:16,263
I don't know what to say.

1411
01:23:18,967 --> 01:23:21,034
Give me your hand.

1412
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:26,206
Must've been
so hard for you

1413
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:29,009
to find out what he did.

1414
01:23:29,142 --> 01:23:31,178
And if your father

1415
01:23:31,311 --> 01:23:34,214
is telling you the truth,

1416
01:23:34,348 --> 01:23:38,318
must have been
very hard for him, too.

1417
01:23:42,289 --> 01:23:44,759
I never really thought
about it like that.

1418
01:23:46,059 --> 01:23:48,295
Oh, yeah, you know...

1419
01:23:48,428 --> 01:23:51,231
sometimes I thinking
it's good to put yourself

1420
01:23:51,365 --> 01:23:54,134
in other one's shoes.

1421
01:23:56,738 --> 01:23:58,740
You want coffee?

1422
01:24:12,854 --> 01:24:14,856
She's awesome.

1423
01:24:14,989 --> 01:24:17,157
Yeah.

1424
01:24:23,463 --> 01:24:25,633
Will you come with me?

1425
01:24:28,335 --> 01:24:30,605
Mordecai, go!

1426
01:24:30,738 --> 01:24:32,941
All right.

1427
01:24:48,288 --> 01:24:50,024
- I can't do this.
- No, no-no-no--

1428
01:24:50,157 --> 01:24:51,659
- Maybe we should go.
- No!

1429
01:24:51,793 --> 01:24:53,260
I work on being a kid

1430
01:24:53,393 --> 01:24:54,729
and a father to my son.

1431
01:24:54,862 --> 01:24:56,598
Now you work
on being a grownup

1432
01:24:56,731 --> 01:24:59,266
and a daughter
to your father.

1433
01:25:00,902 --> 01:25:02,770
Mm.

1434
01:25:36,871 --> 01:25:38,706
How's Mom?

1435
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,608
She's, um...

1436
01:25:42,142 --> 01:25:43,511
she misses you.

1437
01:25:45,847 --> 01:25:48,215
Does she believe you?

1438
01:25:51,519 --> 01:25:54,589
Yes, after we talked.

1439
01:25:58,926 --> 01:26:01,129
All these people...

1440
01:26:02,429 --> 01:26:05,432
the people who were
affected most by our...

1441
01:26:07,001 --> 01:26:08,770
history?

1442
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:16,010
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's welcome to the stage

1443
01:26:16,144 --> 01:26:17,411
our guest of honor,

1444
01:26:17,545 --> 01:26:21,983
who is one century old today!

1445
01:26:22,116 --> 01:26:24,986
Ms. Ida Brown!

1446
01:26:32,894 --> 01:26:36,329
First, I want to thank
everyone for coming.

1447
01:26:37,464 --> 01:26:41,334
I think that,
in a strange way...

1448
01:26:41,468 --> 01:26:44,237
the thing
that binds us together

1449
01:26:44,371 --> 01:26:46,473
is our shared suffering.

1450
01:26:47,508 --> 01:26:50,111
The pain of our past.

1451
01:26:50,243 --> 01:26:52,947
The pain
of our people's history.

1452
01:26:53,081 --> 01:26:57,384
Yes, the war was terrible.

1453
01:26:58,753 --> 01:27:00,387
Yes...

1454
01:27:00,521 --> 01:27:03,290
we lost friends...

1455
01:27:03,423 --> 01:27:06,094
family...

1456
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:07,628
whole communities,

1457
01:27:07,762 --> 01:27:09,329
but for those of us
who are left,

1458
01:27:09,463 --> 01:27:11,699
the greatest condemnation
of Hitler...

1459
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:15,036
is not just
to survive and grieve,

1460
01:27:15,169 --> 01:27:17,270
not just to remember,

1461
01:27:17,404 --> 01:27:22,242
but to bless this life
we were given.

1462
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:25,046
And to dance.

1463
01:27:25,179 --> 01:27:27,915
L'chaim!

1464
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:35,455
That's my friend Mordecai
right there.

1465
01:27:38,358 --> 01:27:40,528
It's... feasible

1466
01:27:40,661 --> 01:27:42,997
that his aunts were
killed by Granddad.

1467
01:27:50,303 --> 01:27:52,640
<i>I have been</i>
<i>traveling back and forth</i>

1468
01:27:52,774 --> 01:27:55,643
<i>to Estelí for three years now</i>
<i>for this plant.</i>

1469
01:28:01,048 --> 01:28:04,051
<i>Now, you guys know</i>
<i>the time, the sweat,</i>

1470
01:28:04,185 --> 01:28:07,287
<i>the love that goes</i>
<i>into making a great cigar.</i>

1471
01:28:14,061 --> 01:28:17,364
<i>This time,</i>
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

1472
01:28:18,431 --> 01:28:23,137
<i>So, guys, friends, competitors,</i>

1473
01:28:23,271 --> 01:28:25,006
<i>what do you think?</i>

1474
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:27,809
Is this cigar a symphony?

1475
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:31,245
Sorry, Marvin,
this cigar just isn't ready.

1476
01:28:31,378 --> 01:28:32,747
Take the deal now, buddy.

1477
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,049
But here's the thing,
as cigar makers,

1478
01:28:35,183 --> 01:28:37,384
we don't really think
about "the endgame"

1479
01:28:37,518 --> 01:28:40,288
in terms of making money.
'Cause this is a passion.

1480
01:28:44,391 --> 01:28:47,662
Marvin! It's your father!

1481
01:28:47,795 --> 01:28:51,364
Netta, please,
please, no-- please!

1482
01:28:53,167 --> 01:28:54,669
Hey, Mordecai?

1483
01:28:54,802 --> 01:28:57,404
- <i>Hello, Marv-- Netta?</i>
- Yeah.

1484
01:28:57,538 --> 01:28:58,873
What's going on?

1485
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:00,508
My father's calling,
it's all right, so--

1486
01:29:00,641 --> 01:29:02,710
You know, in another
three, six months,

1487
01:29:02,844 --> 01:29:04,679
you'll have something here.

1488
01:29:04,812 --> 01:29:07,014
Okay, so what?

1489
01:29:08,216 --> 01:29:11,285
Marvin,
uh, maybe you should start

1490
01:29:11,418 --> 01:29:13,621
with signing the orange tabs.

1491
01:29:15,323 --> 01:29:16,991
Yeah.

1492
01:29:35,977 --> 01:29:37,545
Marvin?

1493
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:45,052
Hey, psst.

1494
01:29:50,124 --> 01:29:52,727
Um... would you all
just excuse me

1495
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:54,896
for just a moment, please?

1496
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:57,464
What the hell are
you doing here?

1497
01:29:57,598 --> 01:29:59,133
No, wait-wait-wait.

1498
01:29:59,267 --> 01:30:01,802
All right.
Netta tells me

1499
01:30:01,936 --> 01:30:03,403
the deal you're making
is on Thursday.

1500
01:30:03,537 --> 01:30:04,872
- so I come in--
- Dad.

1501
01:30:05,006 --> 01:30:06,774
No-no-no-no,
this is what I have to say.

1502
01:30:06,908 --> 01:30:08,709
I go to the bank
this morning.

1503
01:30:08,843 --> 01:30:10,578
Who knew the condo was
worth so much?

1504
01:30:10,711 --> 01:30:13,114
I take out a second mortgage.

1505
01:30:13,247 --> 01:30:14,849
For a rainy day.

1506
01:30:14,982 --> 01:30:17,685
Or for the unsuspecting jinx
of the cigar investment.

1507
01:30:17,818 --> 01:30:20,453
Also, it's possible

1508
01:30:20,588 --> 01:30:22,356
I'm proud of you.

1509
01:30:22,489 --> 01:30:24,424
It is a possibility.

1510
01:30:25,326 --> 01:30:27,128
Hm?

1511
01:30:32,667 --> 01:30:34,635
Hey, everybody, um...

1512
01:30:34,769 --> 01:30:36,570
I'd love to just take a second,
if you don't mind,

1513
01:30:36,704 --> 01:30:38,606
to introduce my father.

1514
01:30:38,739 --> 01:30:41,208
This is
Mordecai Samel.

1515
01:30:49,951 --> 01:30:53,087
Hey, are we gonna
get this done?

1516
01:30:55,623 --> 01:30:59,126
Actually,
I don't think we can.

1517
01:31:01,062 --> 01:31:04,298
How close are we to having
the best damn cigar of the year?

1518
01:31:04,432 --> 01:31:05,967
Oh, yeah-- very close.

1519
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:08,336
Very close,
and once we have

1520
01:31:08,468 --> 01:31:10,538
the best damn cigar
of the year,

1521
01:31:10,671 --> 01:31:12,740
that's gonna cause
a lot of buzz, isn't it?

1522
01:31:12,873 --> 01:31:15,643
- Yeah, all that buzzing.
- Lot of buzzing.

1523
01:31:15,776 --> 01:31:17,511
I was under the impression

1524
01:31:17,645 --> 01:31:20,147
that you didn't have
the funds to wait it out.

1525
01:31:20,281 --> 01:31:22,249
Well, I think you were under
the wrong impression.

1526
01:31:22,383 --> 01:31:25,653
So, if you do wanna return
to the original deal structure,

1527
01:31:25,786 --> 01:31:28,756
we're gonna need to know
in the next 48 hours?

1528
01:31:28,889 --> 01:31:31,192
Yeah, no, 48 hours.

1529
01:31:37,932 --> 01:31:41,202
Mordecai, you got
so many calls on this thing.

1530
01:31:41,335 --> 01:31:44,038
You know, first crazy guy
from art gallery,

1531
01:31:44,171 --> 01:31:47,675
then Nina, then Jared,
who's coming here.

1532
01:31:47,808 --> 01:31:49,510
- What?
- Yeah.

1533
01:31:52,446 --> 01:31:55,082
You're gonna be a no-show
to your own exhibition?

1534
01:31:55,216 --> 01:31:58,185
No, I no leave Fela
alone at night.

1535
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:00,721
- She don't want me to come.
- Then why are we here?

1536
01:32:00,855 --> 01:32:03,057
Why'd she tell us to come?

1537
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:04,625
Fela?

1538
01:32:04,759 --> 01:32:07,328
Come on, get changed.

1539
01:32:07,461 --> 01:32:09,830
- You sure?
- Yeah, I sure.

1540
01:32:09,964 --> 01:32:11,866
You don't-- You don't--

1541
01:32:11,999 --> 01:32:13,467
- Ah.
- You want...

1542
01:32:43,798 --> 01:32:45,534
I come.

1543
01:32:45,666 --> 01:32:48,202
Yes, welcome.

1544
01:32:49,538 --> 01:32:51,806
This is my first art viewing.

1545
01:32:51,939 --> 01:32:55,009
Yeah, well, don't be nervous,
it's mine too.

1546
01:32:56,545 --> 01:32:59,680
Maybe we could meet
for lunch someday, huh?

1547
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:02,249
Yes, okay.

1548
01:33:03,484 --> 01:33:05,886
I view your art now.

1549
01:33:06,921 --> 01:33:08,489
But my art is over here.

1550
01:33:08,622 --> 01:33:10,291
I know!

1551
01:33:27,875 --> 01:33:30,478
Fela, where's Mrs. Gomez?

1552
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:32,547
How you get here?

1553
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,181
What, you take phone taxi?

1554
01:33:34,315 --> 01:33:36,283
I... took a Marvin taxi.

1555
01:33:36,417 --> 01:33:38,587
I took a Netta taxi.

1556
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:40,354
Marvin.

1557
01:33:40,488 --> 01:33:41,922
I'm glad you came.

1558
01:33:42,056 --> 01:33:44,625
I'm glad I came too, Dad.

1559
01:33:44,758 --> 01:33:46,794
Come here.

1560
01:33:48,896 --> 01:33:52,099
Dad, thank you
for everything you did for us.

1561
01:33:52,233 --> 01:33:54,068
It meant a lot.

1562
01:33:54,201 --> 01:33:56,437
Listen, I--
I wish to know about the deal,

1563
01:33:56,571 --> 01:33:59,574
but, um, with respect,
you don't have to say.

1564
01:33:59,707 --> 01:34:01,543
Dad, you should know
about the deal.

1565
01:34:01,675 --> 01:34:03,277
I gave them
two days to respond.

1566
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:06,413
They responded in two hours!
I didn't get to the parking lot!

1567
01:34:06,548 --> 01:34:09,183
- You mean they buy?
- "They buy"? They buy big.

1568
01:34:09,316 --> 01:34:11,085
They buy big!

1569
01:34:11,218 --> 01:34:12,686
Mr. Mordecai!

1570
01:34:13,754 --> 01:34:15,055
- You ready?
- Huh?

1571
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:17,224
- You ready?
- Oh, Nina, Jared.

1572
01:34:17,358 --> 01:34:19,660
I've never been
more happy in my life.

1573
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:27,034
Ladies and gentlemen,

1574
01:34:27,168 --> 01:34:29,303
can I have
your attention please?

1575
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:36,243
To the man
who has taught me...

1576
01:34:36,377 --> 01:34:38,245
so much.

1577
01:34:39,747 --> 01:34:41,448
I am so proud to present

1578
01:34:41,583 --> 01:34:44,785
Mordecai Samel's
Art History.

1579
01:34:44,919 --> 01:34:48,022
And Einsteins--
if you will, please.

1580
01:34:54,929 --> 01:34:57,131
Bravo.

1581
01:35:05,973 --> 01:35:07,942
Speech, Mordecai, speech!

1582
01:35:13,881 --> 01:35:16,383
You see?
We teach each other.

1583
01:35:16,518 --> 01:35:18,919
That's what friends do.

1584
01:35:31,398 --> 01:35:33,067
Well...

1585
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:36,770
now, the first thing
I would like to say is that

1586
01:35:36,904 --> 01:35:40,441
I talk too much.

1587
01:35:40,575 --> 01:35:42,510
Then I, you know...

1588
01:35:42,644 --> 01:35:44,311
I look around.

1589
01:35:44,445 --> 01:35:45,879
And I see...

1590
01:35:46,013 --> 01:35:49,149
...it's nice to be young.

1591
01:35:50,685 --> 01:35:52,820
It's nice to be old.

1592
01:35:54,188 --> 01:35:57,559
It's nice to have phone
with no buttons.

1593
01:36:02,697 --> 01:36:04,733
Also, it's...

1594
01:36:04,865 --> 01:36:06,500
it's nice to have family.

1595
01:36:13,307 --> 01:36:15,175
It's nice to have friends.

1596
01:36:43,638 --> 01:36:46,073
Mama.

1597
01:36:53,247 --> 01:36:54,683
L'chaim!

1598
01:36:54,815 --> 01:36:57,418
L'chaim!

1599
01:37:03,558 --> 01:37:06,193
Wonderful! Well done!

1600
01:37:06,327 --> 01:37:09,897
You see what I told you?
It always works out.

1601
01:37:15,804 --> 01:37:19,173
Fela? Fela?

1602
01:37:27,682 --> 01:37:29,350
Fela?

1603
01:37:29,483 --> 01:37:31,485
Fela? Fela?

1604
01:37:32,886 --> 01:37:34,455
It's me.

1605
01:37:35,623 --> 01:37:37,559
It's your husband.

1606
01:37:38,859 --> 01:37:40,427
Mordecai.

1607
01:37:41,629 --> 01:37:43,397
Where are you going?

1608
01:37:51,673 --> 01:37:53,974
I don't know.

1609
01:37:55,409 --> 01:37:57,478
Okay.

1610
01:37:57,612 --> 01:37:59,480
I'll go with you.

1611
01:37:59,614 --> 01:38:01,181
Come, I go with you.

1612
01:38:01,315 --> 01:38:03,785
- You-You...
- Yeah.

1613
01:38:03,917 --> 01:38:05,787
Come on.

1614
01:38:05,919 --> 01:38:07,354
Thank you.

1615
01:38:09,923 --> 01:38:12,292
- Mordecai?
- Yeah?

1616
01:38:13,595 --> 01:38:16,163
Yeah, let's go home.

1617
01:38:16,296 --> 01:38:18,098
Me.

1618
01:40:46,146 --> 01:40:47,682
- Oh.
- Do it one more time.

1619
01:40:51,118 --> 01:40:52,520
- That's good.
- That's good.

1620
01:40:52,654 --> 01:40:54,956
You know what?
When I was your age,

1621
01:40:55,088 --> 01:40:56,390
I grow up...

1622
01:40:56,524 --> 01:40:58,993
you know what I was wearing?

1623
01:40:59,126 --> 01:41:00,995
Diaper...

1624
01:41:01,128 --> 01:41:03,965
from a sack of potatoes!

1625
01:41:04,097 --> 01:41:09,069
I was sleeping
in a hole on straw.

1626
01:41:09,202 --> 01:41:11,438
I didn't have a house.

1627
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:15,309
I was always hungry.

1628
01:41:15,442 --> 01:41:17,377
I didn't have a mommy.

1629
01:41:17,512 --> 01:41:20,048
- No?
- No.

1630
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:22,717
I don't believe in dreams,

1631
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:26,453
but this is
like a dream come true.

1632
01:41:27,689 --> 01:41:30,490
I have two grandkids
from my son,

1633
01:41:30,625 --> 01:41:34,161
I have five grandchildren
from my daughter.

1634
01:41:35,462 --> 01:41:38,600
And... work out
very good for me.

1635
01:41:38,733 --> 01:41:41,101
That's the story,
my friend.
