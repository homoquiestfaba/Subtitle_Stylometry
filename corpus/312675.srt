00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,375
But inside, I was screaming,
"That's Dave Chappelle!"

(DAVE LAUGHlNG)

167
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,545
Hi.
CAMERAMAN: Hi.

168
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,715
CAMERAMAN:
How's it going? Yeah.
Do you wanna come in?

169
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:20,883
Come on in.

170
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,961
I really don't know what
to take to a rap party,
Block Party.

171
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,366
I knew I should have
bought a thong.

172
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,202
(RAPPlNG)
I'm trying to catch the beat

173
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,565
I need to catch the beat

174
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,232
I need to catch the beat

175
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,809
I need to catch the beat

176
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,245
Now, throw your
motherfucking hands,
get them high

177
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,942
Throw them high, get them high

178
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,981
And all the girls
pass the weed
to your motherfucking man

Get them high, get them high
Come on, get

180

Keep them high,
keep them high, yeah

182
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,128
And if you're losing your high
then smoke again

183
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,253
Keep them high

184
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,926
Now, my flow is in the pocket
like wallets

185
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,992
I got the bounce
like hydraulics

186
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,732
I can't call it,
I got the swerve
like alcoholics

187
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,865
My freshman year,
I was going through
hella problems

188
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,967
Till I built up the nerve
to drop my ass up
out of college

189
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,979
My teacher said I'm a loser,
I told her
why don't you kill me

190
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,312
I give a fuck if you feel me
I'm gonna follow my heart

191
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,080
And if you follow the charts
or the plaques or the stacks

192

You ain't gotta
guess who's back, you see

193
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,383
I'm so shy
you thought I was bashful

194
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,052

will bash your skull

And I will cut your girl

And I don't usually smoke,
but pass the 'dro

Hey, yo, ain't you
meet that chick at the
conference with your mom?

the bougie behavior

fuck with the Internet

I like you, man, I tell you.

233

I'll take that. You want
to come see a rap concert
I'm throwing?

234
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,597
When?
It's in Brooklyn
on Saturday.

235
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:16,965
Sorry, I can't do that.

236
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,162
I'll get you on the bus.

on a bus.

Canada? You trying to
dodge the war?

rap music, but...

240

No, it's not a question
of liking.

I don't hear well enough
to catch the words.

You know, I got
the concert jump-off
this weekend.

243
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,813
Oh, do you?
I can get you there.

244
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,356
Hell, yeah.
If you get me there, I'll go.

245

no difference to me.

You'll go?
Yeah.

we get you there? I ain't
gonna send you on a donkey.

This a bad coat.
Yeah.

to a rap concert?

264
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,235
Now, this is
the popular stuff?
Yeah.

00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,504
All right.
This is current styles.

266

(lMlTATlNG PlMP)
Look here, bitch.

267
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,085
I'm gonna tell you this
and I'm gonna
tell you this once.

268
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,020
I want my goddamn money.

269
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,556
Tell your wife I said hi.
I can't wait to meet her.

270
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,850
What's she like?

271
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,189
She's the shit.
Red hair, big tits.

272
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,593
Red hair and big titties?
All right,
I'll keep an eye out.

273
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,632
Get her drunk,
she'll show them.
Really?

274
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,326
All right, make sure
we have beer at the concert.

275
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,028
This place is called
HaHa's Pizza, right?

276
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,596
Back in the day,
it was started
by some hippies.

277
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:07,712
And they had certain
pizza toppings that made you
laugh. Get my drift?

278
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,349
You ordered a mushroom pizza
at this place back in '71,

279
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,411
chances were
you were gonna hallucinate.

280
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,817
(RAPPlNG) Keep them high

281
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,083
Brooklyn, make some noise.

282
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,928
I rolled up on you guys
completely by chance.

283
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,061
What are the odds
that I'd be shooting
the beginning?

284
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,297
It's God.
I'm shooting a concert movie.

285
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,600
That's God.
That's God, man.

286
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,039
I'm trying to think,
how am I gonna get
people to come?

287
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:40,010
And all of a sudden,
a marching band
crosses the street.

288
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,444
How perfect is that?

289
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,208
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

290
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,183
I'm standing here
with a piece of black history.

291
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:51,188
The first black man
named Milsapp, right here,
ladies and gentlemen.

292
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:55,291
And not only
is his name Milsapp,
but he's also the director

293
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:59,422
of Central State University's
band we got here.

294
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,431
This is not any old band
though, is it?

295
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,559
No, it isn't.
This the drum line.

296
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,864
Mr. Milsapp?
Yes.

297
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,235
All right, how do y'all travel
when you travel?

298
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,866
Very carefully.

299
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,306
We travel by charter bus.

300
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,468
By charter bus?

301
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,444
We gotta have a huddle, guys.
Come on, let's huddle up
real quick.

302
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,311
Look, man. All right,
say I chartered y'all
a bus, right?

303
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,842
Would you all come play
at my concert, Block Party,
in New York?

304
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,216
I don't have a problem
with it.
The whole band?

305
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,417
Yeah, yeah,
with two buses, right?
Yeah.

306
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,119
It's not gonna be more
than two buses, is it?

307
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,286
No, it won't be more
than two buses.

308
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,223
Yeah, man, come on,
rep southwest Ohio, man.

309
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,891
Yes, we would.
You'll do it?

310
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:35,991
Yes, we would.

311
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,592
Is there a compensation,
or what?

312
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,639
Compensation?
It comes with a sandwich.

313
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,900
Will there be snacks?

314
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,532
Oh, there'll be snacks.
We got...

315
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,976
Don't we got snacks
in the budget?
This is a low-budget movie.

316
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,206
You know how Steven Spielberg

317
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,180
have all them trucks
and stuff?
Got the hookup.

318
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,479
DAVE: This is it.
We pulled up
in a minivan, baby.

319
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,813
We're working
on a tight budget.

320
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:57,720
You have to go through the
channels, right? Run it up the
flagpole, that type of thing.

321
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,419
Yeah, and that would
be done expediently.
That could be done.

322
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,121
And now we're just caught up
in a little bureaucracy.

323
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:08,462
Now, how hot would it be
if these kids got a chance
to come through Bed-Stuy,

324
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,795
beating them drums,
playing them horns?

325
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,099
The whole neighborhood

in the gutter, but an angel
broken in seven pieces.

389
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,748
I turned to him,
who was not my husband
at the time,

390
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,822
and I said,
"It's an omen. It's a sign.

00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,122
"I'm to marry you,
of all people."

And I did. I married him.

394
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,027
I put that angel
back together again.

395
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:38,432
But after I did, we found
the original, of which there
may be thousands of them.

396
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,405

was wrecked and vandalized

Rap music, yeah.

494
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,832
His name was Russell Mack.

495
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:35,600
He was a vaudevillian
song-and-dance man.

496
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,066
And I was born in...

497
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,675
They took me home
from the hospital.
I was born in Los Angeles,

498
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,648
and my father built his home
in Beverly Hills.

499
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:50,580
He wanted to negotiate films
with the Germans.

500
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:54,113
But when he realized,
when he saw that
they were, "Heil, Hitler, "

501
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,921
and all of that,

502
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,859
of course, that was a no-go.

503
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,890
They got shit in there,
like, there's a hole

504
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,765
that they look through,
like a pipe,

505
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,266
and the pipe is pointing
directly at a clock tower.

506
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,635
So, like, if it's like,
"What time is it?"

There's some wild shit
in there.

This is called
the Airplane Room,
what you're in now.

510
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:24,186
My son named this room
the Airplane Room.

511
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:29,050
He had a tent.
He lived in a tent. He was 15.

512
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,494
And all the airplanes
flying over to LaGuardia

513
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,464
fly over this building.

514
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,197
What is painted black here

515
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,364
appears to be the bottom.
MAN: Yeah.

516
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,266
So this whole thing floats
over these mirrors.

517
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,569
Whoa!
So from that corner,

518
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,640
it's a very good illusion
in the morning,

519
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,512
because you'll see
clouds underneath it.

520

Oh, yeah, yeah,
I see what you mean.

521
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,120
And there's nothing up here
to give scale,

522
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:01,589
so when people walk by,
they ask me
if this is about this big.

523
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,628
You know, from the street,

524
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:07,426
they don't know how big it is
until I'm up there.

525
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,026
Then they accuse me
of witchcraft.

526
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:16,036
I want to give
and donate myself
to two endeavors in life.

527
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,840
One is cancer, one is animals.

528
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,675
I intend to take a course
at LaGuardia College

529
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,716
as a veterinary technician.

530
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,515
And between that and my life

531
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,846
isn't as young
as perhaps I may look.

532
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,758
But I intend to live
to probably about 400,

533
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,857
as I am also a witch,
but a good witch.

534
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,424
And I only want happiness
for mankind,

535
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:46,561
not to create chaos

536
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,368
and to be angry at everyone,

537
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,272
but to be happy around them.

538
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,576
That is my aim in life.

To give happiness
to the world.

it kind of had
some sort of meaning.

00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:53,923
Rather attack and not react

996
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,989
Back the beats,
it don't reflect
on how many records get sold

997
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,500
On sex, drugs,
and rock and roll

998
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,160
Whether your project
gets put on hold

999
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,104
In the real world
We just people with ideas

1000
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,232
They just like me and you
When the smoke and camera
disappear

1001
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,370
In the real world
It's bigger than all these
fake-ass records

1002
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,415
When poor folks
got the millions
and my sisters get respect

1003
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,508
If you check, one, two
My word of advice to you
is just relax

1004
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:18,486
Just do what you got to do
If that don't work
then here's the facts

1005
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:21,615
If you a fighter, rider,
biter, flame-igniter,
crowd-exciter

1006
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,126
Or you wanna just get high,
then just say it

1007
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:28,654
But then if you a liar,
liar, pants on fire
Wolf-crier, agent with a wire

1008
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:31,292
I'm gonna know it
when I play it
Say it

1009
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:36,261
What it bigger than?

1010
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,500
It's bigger than hip-hop
Hip-hop, hip-hop

1011
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,849
Who shot 2Pac?
If we don't get them,
they gonna get us all

1012
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:49,784
I'm down for running up on
them crackers In the city hall

1013
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:52,413
We ride for y'all
All my dawgs, stay real

1014
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,116
Nigga, don't think
your record deal

1015
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,624
Gonna feed your seeds
and pay your bills

1016
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:56,784
Because they're not

1017
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,055
MCs get a little bit of love
And think they hot

1018
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,619
Talking about
how much money they got

1019
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,255
Nigga, all y'all records
sound the same

1020
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:06,530
I sick of that fake thug,
R&B, rap scenario
All day on the radio

1021
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:07,968
Same scenes in the video

1022
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,939
Monotonous material
Y'all don't hear me, though

1023
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,340
These record labels
sling our tapes like dope

1024
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,105
You can be next in line
and signed

1025
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,112
and still be writing rhymes
and broke

1026
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,344
You rather have a Lexus
or justice?
A dream or some substance?

1027
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,910
A Beemer,
a necklace or freedom?

1028
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,287
See, a nigga like me
don't player-hate
I just stay awake

1029
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:31,088
This is real hip-hop,
and it don't stop

1030
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,220
Till we get them crackers
off our block

1031
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:36,459
They call it hip-hop
Hip-hop, hip-hop

1032
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:39,624
It's bigger than

1033
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,259
What?

1034
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:44,963
What it bigger than?

1035
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:49,336
Hip-hop, hip-hop
What it bigger than?

1036
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,203
What it bigger than?

1037
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:52,303
It bigger than

1038
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,013
hip-hop, hip-hop

1039
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:01,753
D.P.'s got that crazy shit
we keep it crunked up

1040
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,794
Come on, blaze this shit

1041
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:08,888
D.P.'s got that crazy shit
We keep it crunked up

1042
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,432
Brooklyn, we love you.

1043
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,029
Thank y'all.

1044
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,899
Free Aaron Patterson.

1045
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,494
DAVE: Look at that.
Look at that.
All right, all right.

1046
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,565
Ready? This is
for Dead Prez right here.

1047
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:20,439
This is especially
for Dead Prez.

1048
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:21,800
Pow!

1049
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:26,514
The most revolutionary shoe
known to man.
Ya basta!

1050
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,710
Who knew that?
Ya basta.
Ya basta.

1051
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:30,844
Enough is enough,
motherfuckers.

1052
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,217
You need to get us
in a skit, Dave.

1053
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,759
You know what I'm saying?
We can do this.

1054
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:39,227
We can do this.
I'll dance all day.

1055
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,960
How many people
in the audience can MC?

1056
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:46,798
Nine hundred MCs.

1057
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,567
Mr. T.

1058
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,006
Bring up Mr. T.

1059
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:55,834
I wanna battle you.

1060
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,436
(lMlTATlNG MR. T)
I pity you, fool.

1061
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:01,048
I pity the fool
that tries to battle
Dave Chappelle.

1062
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,809
Where's your time machine
parked?

1063
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,687
He got a Mohawk, man.

1064
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:11,022
Come on, man,
you weigh more than me.
God damn!

1065
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,923
I pity the fool!

1066
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,421
Drink the milk, B.A.

1067
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,060
Here's the kicker.

1068
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,103
I'm not giving you a mike.
Good luck!

1069
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,671
You know, I'm from DC,
where y'all are from.

1070
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,675
You from DC? For real?

1071
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:27,732
You know,
we rough it off down there.

1072
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,506
He said he's roughing off.

1073
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,877
Does that mean that I should
wash my hands?

1074
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,844
He's roughing off!

1075
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,109
Vaseline!

1076
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,245
See, roughing off
is when we take the mike.

1077
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,115
All right, hold on.
All right! Take it easy!

1078
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:42,020
You know I got security,
nigga. I'll get you yoked.

1079
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:43,252
I will get you...

1080
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,590
I'm worth too much money now,
motherfucker.

1081
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,256
There's snipers on the roof,
all kinds of shit!

1082
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,293
That's right, Mr. T.
I pity the fool!

1083
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,166
I pity the fool
that fuck with me.

1084
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:58,634
What's up, BK?

1085
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,841
Yo. It's like this.

1086
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,642
This my homie here,
he's from DC, right?

1087
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,581
(RAPPlNG) Yo, son.
What's up with that bald head?

1088
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,624
I think you got to get
something new
or you'll be dead

1089
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,886
Yo, Dave,
I ain't gonna do you like that

1090
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,394
'Cause I'm gonna come to you
real fat with a bat

1091
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:22,124
Yo, I'm rapping like this
'cause I don't
really freestyle

1092
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,724
I'm rapping like this
'cause I've traveled
many miles

1093
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:27,599
"Please to meet you, " I holler
"I'll see you at the gate"

1094
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:30,398
After that, yeah
That shit's gonna be late

1095
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,671
Time out, everybody.

1096
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:36,769
First of all, don't ever boo
a rapper on this stage.

1097
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:40,612
The way that he rhymed "gate"
with "late" is genius!

1098
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:44,378
And if you can't see that,
there's something wrong
with you!

1099
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,680
Anybody can rhyme like that.

1100
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:49,491
You got nice shoes.

1101
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:51,354
Nigga's got blues.

1102
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,586
New York City.

1103
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:57,099
Something about big titties.
You could just do that
all day.

1104
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:00,358
Bring back on that beat!

1105
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,127
Uh!

1106
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,431
Time out, time out, time out!

1107
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,736
Why everybody got to go "uh"
before they freestyle? Uh!

1108
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:09,901
Uh!

1109
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,073
All right, go ahead.
Bring that beat back.
Bring that beat back!

1110
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,277
I didn't forget about you!

1111
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:16,780
(RAPPlNG) It's time
to go to school

1112
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,481
Like Mr. T said,
"I pity the fool!"
