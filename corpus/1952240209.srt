Besides ap'tis political forces.

The machinery was already here.

Will you tell me where you been? 
Liar! As I'm sick!

'Listen to me! We finished!

To gather and have 
gone, when I get back home.

00:02:15,064 --> 00:02:18,515 
If you find your guitar, 
will burn!

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,896 
Why do you treat it? 
You bastard!

00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:43,339 
You hear a siren, Paian? 
I'll call because of you.

Good morning, Mr Detective. 
It ran ... 

28 
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,838 
Did you know that according to 
California law ... 

29 
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:27,593 
... it's illegal to talk

-Will you give me a call? 
-I say for your safety. 

34 
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:51,539 
It is dangerous to drive 
and talking on his phone. 

35 
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:55,458 
Any discussion can 
wait until you go home. 

36 
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:02,923 
Put the hood on the car. 
It's cold in the desert. 

37 
00:04:06,975 --> 00:04:10,309 
-Can I go?

Put the pacemaker,

-Will he succeed. 
-It is more powerful than us.

00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:20,703 
This trauma is

-Why do you say?

The entry wound

75 
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,104

She burned the brain.

77

-Too late, mate! Or too early. 

85 
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:46,143 
-Want to try? 
- Maybe tomorrow. Okay? 

86

88 
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:00,824 
Broke it again? 

89 
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,892 
Jake, where the hell are you? 

90 
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,181 
Sorry, boss. 
I lost time. 

91 
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:05,604 
-Jesus! Again? 
- Be right away. 

92 
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,148 
-Are you sleeping? 
-I am the door. The address? 

93 
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,489 
Avenue Flower 565 ... 
Do you know the address? 

94 
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:20,667 
Yeah, I know. I walked away. 

95 
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:07,091 
Writers, wake up! 

96 
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,382 
I sleep. 

97 
00:13:10,682 --> 00:13:13,802 
The newspaper writes 
the girl died. 

98 
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:18,474 
For the daughter of a diplomat? 
What say? 

99 
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:21,770 
That I lived at the time 
the accident. 

100 
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:25,315 
Witnesses swear 
that was attacked. 

101 
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:30,193 
He spoke to Mobile 
was too abstract. 

102 
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,540 
It is in a morgue 
of Collins. Talk to her. 

103 
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:37,749 
For the girl? 

104 
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:42,247 
You will say something 
not in my report. 

105 
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:45,213 
Or that Collins has not 
in the autopsy. 

106 
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:50,307 
Is the daughter of some ... 
Her parents want answers. 

107 
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:21,628 
Still not receiving a signal; 

108 
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:25,628 
Maybe it's time 
to withdraw the television.

Come. 

117 
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:46,177

It is not pretty, Mandy; 

120 
00:15:58,195 --> 00:16:01,279 
Silence! 
This is the best! 

121 
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:06,073 
It will make noise. 

122 
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:09,995 
You have no signal? 

123 
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:15,954

It is out-attack.

134

For his daughter 
the diplomat in question? 

135 
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:51,046 
You will do routine questions. 
First you have to find? 

136 
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,497 
The victim bore some 
unexplained scars? 

137 
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:04,133 
Hole in the front without 
exit wound and bullet? 

138 
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,768 
In what part you kidding me? 

139 
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:13,100 
We identify unexplained 
events. 

140 
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,237 
Mrs Summers was 
a simple accident. 

141 
00:19:20,537 --> 00:19:23,206 
He spoke on the mobile, 
when done. 

142 
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:26,827 
The cell-triggered it? 
- Thus I believe. 

143 
00:19:27,336 --> 00:19:30,456 
I do not know what it was. 
I do not use mobile. 

144 
00:19:30,714 --> 00:19:35,127 
-Where is your mobile? 
Pota-the coroner. 

145 
00:19:35,428 --> 00:19:38,263 
I am sure

146 
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:40,679 
The cell is important ... 

147 
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:43,721 
-Dr Josephine Summers; 
-What you want, please? 

148 
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,555 
-National Security. 
-You should contact us. 

149 
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:50,942 
We need your help. 
It is extremely urgent. 

150 
00:19:51,153 --> 00:19:55,400 
Excuse me. 
Interrupted our conversation. 

151 
00:19:56,283 --> 00:20:01,622 
Paian is an extremely 
urgent matter of national security. 

152 
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:04,876 
I am sure 
you understand. 

153 
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:10,961 
Find the phone. 

154 
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,598 
His niece, your X pump,

You have arrived. 

158 
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:12,527 
You have five seconds, 
From the exit to the vehicle. 

159 
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:15,192 
What? 

160 
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:18,323 
Last warning. 
Exit From the car now.

-Prepare for extermination. 
-Really? 

163 
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:29,089 
I do fun? Wait! 

164 
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,933 
-Why do you have a gun? 
-Don 't worry about it. 

165 
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:51,526 
Of course I am worried! 
Gun is! 

166 
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:58,869 
-Are you okay? 
-Yes. 

167 
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:02,368 
-Where is Nana? 
-He took his uncle Paul. 

168 
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:17,308 
It should give me 
the gun. 

169 
00:22:19,895 --> 00:22:22,102 
Why? 

170 
00:22:24,901 --> 00:22:28,104 
Let's say that you would do 
to feel more comfortable. 

171 
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:38,618 
Tell me what happened here. 

172 
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,787 
Jake came to build 
satellite. 

173 
00:22:43,254 --> 00:22:47,797 
I ran and walked. 
Screamed something about armed robots. 

174 
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:54,465 
I do not know what I saw. 

175 
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:58,973 
The dish became 
a remote-controlled. 

176 
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:03,062 
-What do you mean? 
-Pompot! 

177 
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,150 
The satellite dish 
missing. 

178 
00:23:15,747 --> 00:23:17,870 
My God! 

179 
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:22,414 
We find a cell phone! 

180 
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:26,458 
-What, X pump; 
-Get in! 

181 
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:37,550 
Air Force Base 'Edwards 
California 

182 
00:23:52,995 --> 00:23:58,072 
Colonel Weston. 
You requested map extraterrestrial life. 

183 
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:02,208 
4 weeks ago, I located 
anomaly in the infrared waves. 

184 
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,919 
Usual, but this time, 
the incidence was 980 nanometers. 

185 
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:11,969 
Alerts are sent 
through ERLAP or TINYTIM ... 

186 
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:17,144 
The other machine takes 
the signal and there is communication. 

187 
00:24:17,605 --> 00:24:20,725 
Usually we take infrared 
Marks From the universe. Right? 

188 
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:23,065 
This was different. 

189 
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:26,854 
We believe, that I believe 
found that goal. 

190 
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:30,650 
Communicate? 

191 
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:44,626 
It seems to have turned 
two months ago. 

192 
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:49,593 
Why did you say 
Returned AP'TON war? 

193 
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:53,969 
-Did you know? 
- No. 

194 
00:25:01,193 --> 00:25:04,360 
Mention murder 
Street Mojave. 

195 
00:25:05,823 --> 00:25:07,946 
Received. Go. 

196 
00:25:09,118 --> 00:25:10,992 
What happened again? 
SUBrip-TIMING [GMTeam] 

197 
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,640 
Book a while back, guys. 
Do not leave, I want to talk. 

198 
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,664 
In-shot? 
-Mandy, go to the car. 

199 
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:59,120 
The car flew by. 

200 
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:06,634 
-What? Someone pulled? 
- No, the car pushed him out. 

201 
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:13,384 
-Where is that car now? 
- She left, I guess. 

202 
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:20,276 
-Did you see what the result? 
-Nobody. She left alone. 

203 
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:37,291 
Uncle X pump, what happens? 

204 
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,419 
Damn! Tell me what happens! 
Do not be so overprotective! 

205 
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:51,017 
-You 're like your mother. 
-You know something, right? 

206 
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:54,638 
I have to say something. 
I will not make assumptions. 

207 
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,140 
They are robots, terrorists, 
remotely? 

208 
00:26:59,445 --> 00:27:03,443 
I am trained in 
unmanned aircraft. 

209 
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:06,321 
They are systems 
high automation. 

210 
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:11,447 
See? Will get in trouble, 
if you rush to conclude. 

211 
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:15,868 
At least do something. 
Better than you do. 

212 
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,703 
Mandy, I do not freak out. 

213 
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:22,628 
Stop the car! 

214 
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:33,352 
What are you sitting? Bring her back! 

215 
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:48,906 
Sorry I don 't 
I called when I returned. 

216 
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,043 
I had trouble, right? 

217 
00:27:58,258 --> 00:28:00,583 
I did not want to say this. 

218 
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:05,545 
I was not ready to see you. 

219 
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:08,675 
The issue is not are you. 

220 
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:12,848 
Something happens 
I do not feel safe. 

221 
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:18,066 
Enter and the two instruments. 

222 
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,814 
Get in the car. 

223 
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,163 
-What happened? 
-You want to stun my accent? 

224 
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:40,458 
The cell was important 
information. Have you yet? 

225 
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:44,091 
I was looking in the FBI 
a couple of hours. 

226 
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:47,925 
-They took it? 
-No find it. Weird, huh? 

227 
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,851 
We looked at the office, though. 

228 
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:58,814 
I have to run. 
Waiting for some more body. 

229 
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:04,778 
-Uncle, they found the car. 
-Go back and come immediately. 

230 
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:12,126 
What would you say to going out 
for lunch next week? 

231 
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,087 
I'll call you. 

232 
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:17,362 
-It looks like a normal phone. 
- Just leave it. 

233 
00:30:17,991 --> 00:30:20,564 
Put it in the gun cabinet. 

234 
00:30:21,578 --> 00:30:23,736 
In the glove box. 

235 
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:36,842 
In I-14 and Sierra, black SUV. 
He hit a pedestrian and left. 

236 
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:40,135 
Description of the driver? 

237 
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:47,557 
The jeep! 

238 
00:30:57,324 --> 00:30:58,984 
Stop! 

239 
00:31:08,378 --> 00:31:10,417 
Code 30! 

240 
00:31:11,172 --> 00:31:13,746 
Chase a black SUV. 

241 
00:31:17,221 --> 00:31:19,297 
I aid immediately! 

242 
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:28,312 
Stay in the car! 

243 
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:36,027 
Get From the vehicle! 

244 
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:43,243 
Last warning! 
Get From the vehicle immediately! 

245 
00:31:50,965 --> 00:31:53,124 
Writers, get in the car! 

246 
00:31:58,723 --> 00:32:01,345 
Go! Sanidose it, X pump! 

247 
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,793 
Damn! 

248 
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:36,093 
I think we lost. 

249 
00:33:10,926 --> 00:33:12,883 
Damn! 

250 
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:19,758 
Close-up! 
-I! 

251 
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:23,353 
-What does it say? 
-I do not know! Not talking robot! 

252 
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,059 
Get out! 

253 
00:33:33,283 --> 00:33:34,991 
The mobile! 

254 
00:33:35,452 --> 00:33:37,990 
The mobile wants! 
Drop it! 

255 
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,549 
Get out fast! 

256 
00:33:59,102 --> 00:34:00,894 
Get in! 

257 
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:25,495 
Here Mary Neinter to base. 

258 
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:29,250 
I want to send team 
to get the phone. 

259 
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:33,136 
Do not be afraid. We took 
From the Table SUV. 

260 
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:37,388 
-Why? 
-You will not hurt us. 

261 
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:44,226 
-Do you know? "Any theory? 
-Called TPA. 

262 
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:49,066 
Remote-controlled 
Pompot predators. 

263 
00:34:49,531 --> 00:34:53,280 
It is a combination 
engineering and electronics. 

264 
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:56,408 
Timed-kill. 
-Right. 

265 
00:34:56,789 --> 00:35:00,372 
-It is a terrorist attack? 
-Approx. 

266 
00:35:25,486 --> 00:35:28,820 
Van Paimpergk very 
Your impressive dossier. 

267 
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,607 
You tell us what happens? 

268 
00:35:32,244 --> 00:35:36,076 
You are the policeman who 
talked with Dr. Summers. 

269 
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,616 
-Is he here? 
-Yes. 

270 
00:35:39,126 --> 00:35:43,539 
They saw a vehicle and a satellite 
plate to transform. 

271 
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:46,165 
Follow me. 

272 
00:35:56,812 --> 00:36:00,395 
Dr. Joe Summers, from here 
Jake Van Paimpergk. 

273 
00:36:00,816 --> 00:36:03,307 
You have to say much 
you two. 

274 
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:11,448 
The robots are coordinated with 
machine remote control. 

275 
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:15,572 
And serve 
a common purpose. 

276 
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,452 
We need to know 
what is that purpose. 

277 
00:36:20,837 --> 00:36:24,088 
You said the satellite 
plate was robots. 

278 
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:27,508 
-The car. 
The cell-to girl? 

279 
00:36:27,845 --> 00:36:32,009 
We have a safe place 
by bulletproof steel ... 

280 
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,515 
... kept 
by armed soldiers. 

281 
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:43,194 
Tell me something. 
Where do they come? 

282 
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:47,822 
We build them. 

283 
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:54,029 
July '47 ... Aircraft crash 
shot in the desert of Mexico. 

284 
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,579 
In-Posgouel? 
-Right. 

285 
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:59,711 
The source of modern 
technology ... 

286 
00:37:00,004 --> 00:37:02,626 
What we learned AP'TI crash 
gave us the tools ... 

287 
00:37:02,882 --> 00:37:06,049 
... to build 
current machines. 

288 
00:37:07,095 --> 00:37:10,879 
We know, however, that 
build an army. 

289 
00:37:11,517 --> 00:37:16,013 
In other words, you say that all these 
is our fault? 

290 
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:19,146 
All started 
the Pyramids. 

291 
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:22,521 
Pyramids, Ptolemies, 
solar systems ... 

292 
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:27,897 
HDTV, 
DVD, microwave ... 

293 
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,993 
Tell them to sign. 

294 
00:37:31,288 --> 00:37:34,455 
Two weeks ago, when 
who attacked the machines ... 

295 
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,285 
... spotted the infrared signal 
from astronomical sources. 

296 
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:42,008 
-Extraterrestrial source, ie; 
-Exactly. 

297 
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:48,259 
-RC, namely; 
-Exactly. 

298 
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:52,849 
So I am here. 

299 
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:56,762 
The Van is an expert Paimpergk 
in unmanned aircraft. 

300 
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:03,397 
Is piloting the Predator MQ1 
and Harvester MQ9 ... 

301 
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:07,234 
... in more than thirty 
reconnaissance. 

302 
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,827 
In Iraq, Pakistan 
and Afghanistan. 

303 
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,499 
Here because he knows about 
Remote-controlled machines ... 

304 
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,168 
... than anyone else 
the planet. 

305 
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,302 
What happens? 

306 
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:29,056 
Excuse me. 

307 
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:41,149 
The list indicates pentaselidi 
transformations throughout the world. 

308 
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:44,691 
Miramare, Las Vegas 
Camp Springs, Baghdad ... 

309 
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:50,529 
All these cities have 
such as military bases here. 

310 
00:39:02,928 --> 00:39:04,755 
What the hell is that? 

311 
00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:14,853 
What was that? 

312 
00:39:15,942 --> 00:39:19,145 
Sound-explosion. 
-There was an explosion sound. 

313 
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:25,275 
They are the ones. 

314 
00:39:32,835 --> 00:39:34,662 
-Where are they? 
In North-Gate. 

315 
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:36,670 
All forces 
the Main Gate! 

316 
00:39:36,922 --> 00:39:38,962 
The helicopter attack! Now! 

317 
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:50,979 
Airbase 'Edwards! 
We attack! 

318 
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:52,813 
We support! 

319 
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:58,900 
Let's go 
From the building! 

320 
00:39:59,446 --> 00:40:01,570 
It is remote controlled! 

321 
00:40:01,907 --> 00:40:06,237 
Giving out Remote 
points to research missions. 

322 
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:10,080 
-He explored the water. 
- You have a plan? 

323 
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:15,292 
"I have! Out From the room! 
-We do not know what they do outside. 

324 
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:20,258 
-Destroying forces. 
-The soldiers dispersed. 

325 
00:40:21,136 --> 00:40:24,885 
-And then? 
-There will be greater invasion. 

326 
00:40:31,522 --> 00:40:34,607 
Edward in Pendleton. 
M'akouei anyone? 

327 
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,655 
We are on our own! 
Run! 

328 
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:50,616 
Jake, the unmanned 
to fly ... 

329 
00:40:51,586 --> 00:40:54,789 
If the enemy uses 
such against us ... 

330 
00:40:55,131 --> 00:40:58,216 
-How to defend? 
In-system involvement. 

331 
00:40:59,594 --> 00:41:03,094 
-I block the signal. 
-And so you do not communicate. 

332 
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:07,467 
As television 
the remote control. 

333 
00:41:07,728 --> 00:41:09,934 
Presses, 
change the channel. 

334 
00:41:10,356 --> 00:41:13,523 
If you put something in front 
AP'TIN TV, it is nothing. 

335 
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,611 
We have a wireless system 
involvement in the control tower. 

336 
00:41:16,779 --> 00:41:18,819 
-How do you know? 
-There was. 

337 
00:41:19,032 --> 00:41:21,819 

338 
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:24,906 
-I come with you. 
-You stay here. 

339 
00:41:25,622 --> 00:41:27,579 
I will stay with her. 

340 
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:31,000 
Uncle, you're not my father. 
We come together. 

341 
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:37,337 
We are constantly 
behind me, okay? Go. 

342 
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:48,979 
We must go to the tower 
and to block the signal. 

343 
00:41:50,357 --> 00:41:52,515 
You will not catch a word! 

344 
00:42:20,556 --> 00:42:22,347 
Ready? 

345 
00:42:29,607 --> 00:42:32,774 
We attack! 
Aid! Now! 

346 
00:42:33,903 --> 00:42:37,070 
Here Basis' Edwards! 
Hear? 

347 
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:49,117 
-To the distract. 
-If you block the signal? 

348 
00:42:49,545 --> 00:42:54,089 
I can tell you in theory. 
You have to kill. 

349 
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,719 
This connection. 

350 
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,010 
-Who will lead? 
-I. 

351 
00:43:00,265 --> 00:43:03,765 
-Are you a pilot? 
-Not only you experience. 

352 
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,971 
-Will post them the army. 
-I can do. 

353 
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:12,479 
Let's do it! Jake, 
You and I in the control tower. 

354 
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:14,943 
We talk to me 
the symbol of engagement. 

355 
00:43:15,114 --> 00:43:17,237 
-Who will initiate the attention? 
-I. 

356 
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:21,950 
Can. It will block the signal 
and you will drive the helicopter. 

357 
00:43:22,247 --> 00:43:23,955 
-Are you sure? 
-Yes. 

358 
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:26,372 
Madison, Do your very best! 

359 
00:43:26,752 --> 00:43:29,539 
I'll send signal 
AP'TON control tower. 

360 
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:33,005 
-What brand? 
-I know. 

361 
00:43:37,138 --> 00:43:38,716 
Take care. 

362 
00:43:39,057 --> 00:43:40,800 
Good luck to all. 

363 
00:43:43,728 --> 00:43:48,022 
-Are you sure that you? 
-Nice is to die heroically. 

364 
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,650 
-Be careful. 
-And you. 

365 
00:44:15,429 --> 00:44:18,596 
Writers such as bike! 

366 
00:44:21,644 --> 00:44:23,886 
Damn! 
There should be! 

367 
00:44:33,114 --> 00:44:35,191 
Go on the roof! 

368 
00:44:54,596 --> 00:44:56,635 
Run, Mandy! 

369 
00:45:02,062 --> 00:45:04,138 
Go, baby! 

370 
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:24,209 
Where is it? 

371 
00:45:50,906 --> 00:45:55,200 
I know to use them. 
As to''load''label. 

372 
00:45:55,703 --> 00:45:59,286 
-Quick, Joe! 
-Don 'distraction. 

373 
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:02,869 
-Hurry! 
-Be quiet! With worry! 

374 
00:46:03,253 --> 00:46:06,788 
-You talk! Send the signal! 
-Even talking! 

375 
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,378 
Take this ntenekofefale! 

376 
00:46:16,308 --> 00:46:18,348 
'S label. 

377 
00:46:21,939 --> 00:46:24,015 
Comes in the control tower! 

378 
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,190 
-Get down! 
-What is this? 

379 
00:46:36,538 --> 00:46:38,827 
He comes to the tower. 
You hear? 

380 
00:46:39,124 --> 00:46:42,494 
If you come to the tower, 
will send a signal! Tell him! 

381 
00:46:43,337 --> 00:46:46,504 
X pump, do not let 
come to the tower! 

382 
00:46:47,675 --> 00:46:49,882 
Do not come to the tower! 

383 
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,888 
Get AP'TON tower now! 

384 
00:47:02,566 --> 00:47:05,484 
Writers, to see! 
Go! 

385 
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:11,699 
Damn! 

386 
00:47:15,288 --> 00:47:17,364 
You have one minute! 

387 
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:21,036 
-How long, Joe? 
-I do not know. 

388 
00:47:34,767 --> 00:47:37,971 
Jake, if m'akous, 
to find Mandy. 

389 
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,516 
Keep an eye on. 

390 
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,991 
The signal blocked! 

391 
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,702 
Writers, come on! 

392 
00:49:02,736 --> 00:49:06,402 
All computers in the world 
closed temporarily. 

393 
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,294 
The machines with chips 
destroyed. 

394 
00:49:27,847 --> 00:49:30,053 
We were happy. 

395 
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:39,474 
Relieved, at least. 

396 
00:50:10,893 --> 00:50:12,969 
How are you? 

397 
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:15,812 
Well. 

398 
00:50:22,447 --> 00:50:26,397 
-I will miss it. 
-Me too. 

399 
00:50:35,252 --> 00:50:40,958 
In thought his son. 
He wanted the best for you. 

400 
00:50:46,556 --> 00:50:49,972 
Sorry I did not come 
to see where I went. 

401 
00:50:51,728 --> 00:50:55,180 
- I had to come. 
-Never mind. 

402 
00:50:59,862 --> 00:51:02,946 
-Where are we going? 
-To dance. 

403 
00:51:05,868 --> 00:51:08,656 
I've never been good 
in dance. 

404 
00:51:08,997 --> 00:51:12,947 
Shoot, kill giant 
robots and not dance? 

405 
00:51:13,501 --> 00:51:15,328 
I told you. 
SUBrip-TIMING [GMTeam] 

406 
00:51:24,722 --> 00:51:28,340 
-Are you okay? 
"Yes, I start to habit. 

407 
00:51:29,602 --> 00:51:32,176 
Are you okay, I mean. 

408 
00:51:35,317 --> 00:51:37,938 
Yes, I think so. 

409 
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:43,815 
Only I do not know 
what happened there. 

410 
00:51:45,327 --> 00:51:49,657 
Usually I say, 
when dancing with a girl. 

411 
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:53,541 
X-orefeis with many? 
-Too many! 

412 
00:51:54,253 --> 00:51:58,002 
Thus explains the extraordinary 
Your dancing skills. 

413 
00:51:58,425 --> 00:52:01,426 
Give me a few minutes 
and will be hell to pay. 

414 
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,009 
Will you set foot! 

415 
00:52:12,231 --> 00:52:15,434 
I had a platoon of men 
under my command. 

416 
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:21,571 
We had a convoy 
out AP'TI Basri. 

417 
00:52:24,911 --> 00:52:28,660 
We have reached a turning 
street. 

418 
00:52:30,209 --> 00:52:33,376 
We threw a rocket 
a home. 

419 
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:36,382 
He hit the ground 
just below us. 

420 
00:52:39,469 --> 00:52:43,134 
I said to my men 
to remain motionless ... 

421 
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,132 
... and ran home. 

422 
00:52:48,436 --> 00:52:52,517 
'Acted very quickly. 
It was an ambush. 

423 
00:52:56,528 --> 00:53:01,238 
I went home and I was looking 
that we shot. 

424 
00:53:03,828 --> 00:53:07,328 
One group fired 
against my husband. 

425 
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:12,921 
I heard the shots ... 

426 
00:53:13,588 --> 00:53:16,839 
... and I went out 
as fast as I could. 

427 
00:53:18,677 --> 00:53:22,722 
Until we get all 
my men were dead. 

428 
00:53:24,392 --> 00:53:28,342 
You did what you believed 
that is correct, right? 

429 
00:54:58,034 --> 00:54:59,991 
What is this? 

430 
00:55:02,914 --> 00:55:05,037 
Earthquake? 

431 
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:09,118 
I think not. 
Better get dressed. 

432 
00:55:49,756 --> 00:55:52,045 
Jake, what happens? 

433 
00:55:52,592 --> 00:55:54,336 
Not stop the signal. 

434 
00:55:54,678 --> 00:55:56,635 
What do you mean? 

435 
00:56:04,229 --> 00:56:06,388 
They are coming machinery. 

436 
00:56:13,906 --> 00:56:16,908 
Stay here! 
'I am coming soon! 

437 
00:56:30,257 --> 00:56:33,461 
-Where did you get? 
-It is for''rainy day''. 

438 
00:57:08,423 --> 00:57:10,582 
Madison, come on! 

439 
00:57:23,147 --> 00:57:24,855 
Get in!

00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,485 
Go! Go! 
SUBrip-TIMING [GMTeam] 

441 
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:34,148 
What happened, Joe? 
I think I won. 

442 
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,286 
-It seems not. 
-What does that mean? 

443 
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:43,574 
It destroyed the 
quickly. 

444 
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,620 
Not our fault. 
Met their goal. 

445 
00:57:46,923 --> 00:57:49,877 
Do you see any military? 
No! 

446 
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:53,545 
All systems and 
communications have been interrupted. 

447 
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:57,341 
Networks, defense ... 
Off! 

448 
00:57:58,936 --> 00:58:02,139 
-We are our own. 
- We got company! 

449 
00:58:06,736 --> 00:58:10,686 
-What is this? Push throttle, Joe! 
-I have sanidosei! 

450 
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:23,542 
-You can run, Joe? 
-Try! 

451 
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:36,508 
Saving! 

452 
00:58:38,144 --> 00:58:41,893 
-We must go from Town. 
-Go into the desert. 

453 
00:58:57,331 --> 00:58:59,455 
They have understood everything. 

454 
00:59:09,094 --> 00:59:11,502 
They took over the planet. 

455 
00:59:55,185 --> 00:59:59,017 
You're fine. 
Do courage. 

456 
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,066 
Everything will be fine. 
You can do it. 

457 
01:00:11,703 --> 01:00:13,779 
Missed, right? 

458 
01:00:14,122 --> 01:00:17,325 
Everything will be fine. 
Do courage. 

459 
01:00:19,795 --> 01:00:21,289 
Over here! 

460 
01:00:23,048 --> 01:00:25,207 
Come get up. 

461 
01:00:31,182 --> 01:00:33,139 
Madison, get the gun. 

462 
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:36,553 
Get into the van. 

463 
01:00:43,779 --> 01:00:45,736 
Let's get outta here. 

464 
01:00:49,368 --> 01:00:52,571 
-Go to Bannon. 
-Just get out of here. 

465 
01:00:52,955 --> 01:00:55,956 
-Jake will be okay? 
-Fine. 

466 
01:00:56,584 --> 01:01:00,582 
Lucy comes to help 
take care of 'Amy. 

467 
01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:04,127 
The 'Amy was my classmate. 
How? 

468 
01:01:04,468 --> 01:01:07,671 
Great. If physicians 
not had a pacemaker put ... 

469 
01:01:07,888 --> 01:01:10,806 
... would not be with us 
to see the end of the world. 

470 
01:01:17,648 --> 01:01:19,641 
We have to draw. 

471 
01:01:21,486 --> 01:01:23,562 
Bite them. 

472 
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:29,656 
Count to three. 
Ready? 

473 
01:01:30,162 --> 01:01:32,534 
On three? 
Or as you say three? 

474 
01:01:32,915 --> 01:01:37,043 
1.2 and after I take. 
Okay? Ready? 

475 
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,207 
One ... Two ... 

476 
01:01:43,426 --> 01:01:45,335 
Three ... 

477 
01:01:47,972 --> 01:01:51,673 
Quits! 
Almost came out, Joe! 

478 
01:01:54,897 --> 01:01:57,518 
You're fine. 

479 
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:04,021 
Do courage, Joe. 
We will tie. 

480 
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,649 
We will stop 
bleeding. 

481 
01:02:10,413 --> 01:02:13,331 
Hold it. 
Everything will be fine. 

482 
01:02:15,085 --> 01:02:16,994 
Everything will be fine. 

483 
01:02:49,205 --> 01:02:52,372 
-What is this place? 
-They destroyed my city. 

484 
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:54,915 
The leveled. 

485 
01:02:55,253 --> 01:02:58,420 
We have refugee camps 
until you see what we do. 

486 
01:02:58,715 --> 01:03:02,630 
We are many. 'Men, 
women and children ... And families. 

487 
01:03:09,643 --> 01:03:11,221 
And if we find? 

488 
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:15,103 
This will be done sooner or later. 
But expect the best. 

489 
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:18,312 
We are prepared 
for the worst. 

490 
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:22,820 
Th'aftoktonisoume. 

491 
01:03:24,409 --> 01:03:28,074 
If they are, will die 
on our own terms. 

492 
01:03:35,629 --> 01:03:40,292 
Do not be afraid. We carried - 
theimenoi. You will not come this far. 

493 
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:44,878 
All you hungry? 

494 
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:08,237 
Dr. Summers, what is the difference 
between aliens and Alien; 

495 
01:04:08,707 --> 01:04:11,957 
Good question. 
Thanks for the respect. 

496 
01:04:12,335 --> 01:04:16,036 
The best way 
to describe the ... 

497 
01:04:17,257 --> 01:04:20,958 
An alien attack 
as a friend. 

498 
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,259 
Eventually, 
the conflict ... 

499 
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:28,591 
wonder how ... 
would defeat. 

500 
01:04:31,105 --> 01:04:35,898 
This Alien attacked 
as an enemy. 

501 
01:04:37,028 --> 01:04:40,195 
And I could 
understand anything. 

502 
01:04:42,409 --> 01:04:45,778 
The aliens attack 
of defense. 

503 
01:04:46,205 --> 01:04:49,372 
The Alien attack without 
challenge ... Cold. 

504 
01:04:50,251 --> 01:04:54,201 
- I think so. 
-Sorry about the beans. 

505 
01:04:54,631 --> 01:04:57,834 
When I was mayor paretheta 
the best meals. 

506 
01:04:58,176 --> 01:05:00,216 
Now, what is the canned. 

507 
01:05:02,472 --> 01:05:07,016 
Ate when I was 
student ... The love you! 

508 
01:05:08,979 --> 01:05:13,440 
You know why we are so 
''lucky''; Why us now? 

509 
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:18,857 
-Why they came, Dr. Summers? 
-This is the big question. 

510 
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:24,115 
For natural resources 
air, water ... 

511 
01:05:26,164 --> 01:05:29,000 
I saw something to put 
water. 

512 
01:05:31,003 --> 01:05:33,209 
Contaminate water. 

513 
01:05:36,717 --> 01:05:38,924 
We are destroying. 

514 
01:05:43,725 --> 01:05:45,931 
Mayor! 

515 
01:05:46,937 --> 01:05:50,982 
Something moves in the chest! 
My God! The pacemaker! 

516 
01:06:38,075 --> 01:06:40,862 
Only I see death. 

517 
01:06:44,206 --> 01:06:49,545 
It should be obvious as possible. 
We must survive. 

518 
01:06:53,466 --> 01:06:57,381 
Look ... Destroyed 
almost everything. 

519 
01:07:00,432 --> 01:07:04,097 
What next? 
Our water? 

520 
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,846 
Not if we get 
first in the water. 

521 
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:10,224 
What does this mean? 

522 
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:16,314 
Our resources are getting less. 
Without water, you th'antexoume much. 

523 
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:20,161 
We must survive. 

524 
01:07:23,457 --> 01:07:26,956 
Is it right ... If you get out alive 
in this invasion ... 

525 
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:30,498 
... all the natural resources 
disappear. 

526 
01:07:33,259 --> 01:07:35,715 
You have a plan? 

527 
01:07:40,642 --> 01:07:43,809 
The aqueduct 
Los Angeles. 

528 
01:07:51,278 --> 01:07:54,232 
Come, have a job. 

529 
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:12,214 
The water supply system 
of L. Angeles brings water ... 

530 
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:15,594 
... the only, 
340 miles away ... 

531 
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:19,429 
... and AP'TIN Valley-Owens, 
240 miles away. 

532 
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:23,852 
-On entering the city? 
-From here. 

533 
01:08:24,647 --> 01:08:28,396 
Three separate sources of water. 
About 70% of drinking water. 

534 
01:08:28,735 --> 01:08:31,938 
-How far is it from here? 
-About three hours. 

535 
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,447 
-We see, though. 
-We will follow the pipeline. 

536 
01:08:35,826 --> 01:08:38,282 
Goes south, From the Mojave. 

537 
01:08:38,912 --> 01:08:41,486 
You will have, of course, 
roof ... 

538 
01:08:41,874 --> 01:08:45,623 
When we come, 
how to destroy? 

539 
01:08:47,088 --> 01:08:50,208 
-How many have dynamite? 
-About two hundred. 

540 
01:08:50,925 --> 01:08:54,211 
- Guns? 
- We have a small arsenal. 

541 
01:08:55,597 --> 01:08:59,642 
We'll take what we have. 
The women will stay here. 

542 
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:03,600 
If you want to stay with 
their families, you understand. 

543 
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:06,015 
"I will come. 
-Me too. 

544 
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,815 
-Joe, got injured. 
-A little hack is. 

545 
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:12,315 
-You come too. 
-Are you sure? 

546 
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:18,114 
The bastards killed her uncle 
me. You will lose nothing with. 

547 
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:26,996 
We are seven. More, 
it attracted attention. 

548 
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:31,006 
We'll go on foot. 
Low and fast. 

549 
01:09:31,344 --> 01:09:33,420 
We will be together. 

550 
01:09:37,892 --> 01:09:40,218 
Let's get ready. 

551 
01:09:54,368 --> 01:09:56,112 
Is that all? 

552 
01:10:02,043 --> 01:10:05,377 
-Joe, you know what? 
- No, but I learn quickly. 

553 
01:10:05,797 --> 01:10:09,629 
Do not aim. 
Madison carefully. 

554 
01:10:12,012 --> 01:10:15,179 
- Ready everyone? 
-If you're ready and you. 

555 
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:26,066 
-How long is the pipeline? 
-Approximately 270 meters. 

556 
01:10:26,444 --> 01:10:30,988 
There is an opening right 
just before the wire. 

557 
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:46,672 
Everyone OK? 
Joe, how is the leg? 

558 
01:10:47,008 --> 01:10:50,009 
I can not s'efcharistiso 
quite. Well I am. 

559 
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:53,796 
- Any idea where we are? 
- Out AP'TI Santa Klarita. 

560 
01:10:54,349 --> 01:10:57,019 
More From the hill is 
the freeway 405. 

561 
01:10:57,311 --> 01:10:58,971 
Then, the Kaskeints. 

562 
01:10:59,396 --> 01:11:01,519 
Continue. 
Joe, you can walk? 

563 
01:11:01,815 --> 01:11:03,476 
Well I am. 

564 
01:11:17,582 --> 01:11:19,705 
Low! 

565 
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:24,456 
Quiet. 

566 
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:30,468 
They understood that a 
will enter the pipeline. 

567 
01:11:30,888 --> 01:11:34,721 
-Close all the hiding places. 
-What do we do now? 

568 
01:11:36,102 --> 01:11:39,554 
-Follow plan. 
-Uncovered? Crazy? 

569 
01:11:39,898 --> 01:11:42,056 
Do you have any better suggestion? 

570 
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:46,317 
Come on, come on. 

571 
01:12:03,215 --> 01:12:06,299 
-If you do not succeed? 
-We will succeed. 

572 
01:12:06,677 --> 01:12:09,464 
-Joe, how is the leg? 
-I press on the nose! 

573 
01:12:10,014 --> 01:12:13,964 
-How have we come? 
-A few miles away. 

574 
01:12:14,643 --> 01:12:17,479 
It's miracle 
not encountered any so far. 

575 
01:12:17,814 --> 01:12:19,687 
Luck is on our side. 

576 
01:12:40,254 --> 01:12:45,249 
Idiots, I must see 
doctor. How walking around like this? 

577 
01:12:46,052 --> 01:12:49,468 
Not walking around. Thanks 
to cover. 

578 
01:12:50,682 --> 01:12:53,304 
-Wounded; 
-A hack is. 

579 
01:12:53,685 --> 01:12:56,176 
The rest of the team 
was not so lucky. 

580 
01:12:58,983 --> 01:13:03,312 
The Task Force. We wanted to go 
gaiopoiisis factory. 

581 
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:06,105 
Unfortunately, the plan failed. 
We detected. 

582 
01:13:06,407 --> 01:13:09,492 
-What works gaiopoiisis? 
-Do not you know? 

583 
01:13:11,997 --> 01:13:16,410 
-Who are you? 
Van-Paimpergk and my friends. 

584 
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:20,293 
We went to the aqueduct. 
Contaminate water. 

585 
01:13:20,673 --> 01:13:25,002 
I do not just pollute. 
This will improve for them. 

586 
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:28,722 
Water is simply 
part of the equation. 

587 
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:33,601 
Transform the world 
the atmosphere temperature. 

588 
01:13:34,187 --> 01:13:36,394 
Surveying, 
ecology, everything. 

589 
01:13:36,648 --> 01:13:39,519 
-How do you know? 
-The Russians had captured one. 

590 
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:43,443 
The tortured until he revealed 
codes of memory. 

591 
01:13:44,531 --> 01:13:47,782 
How-torturing a machine? 
-I wish I knew. 

592 
01:13:48,411 --> 01:13:52,658 
It affects the motherboard, 
kid's hard disk. 

593 
01:13:53,332 --> 01:13:56,666 
I do not give a damn 
what the Russians. 

594 
01:13:57,128 --> 01:13:59,121 
All I know ... 

595 
01:13:59,839 --> 01:14:03,672 
They fight to death 
or destroy themselves. 

596 
01:14:04,469 --> 01:14:07,257 
How many stations gaiopoiisis 
there? 

597 
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:11,388 
World; Nine. 
The three already off. 

598 
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:14,847 
In Japan, the House garia 
and South Africa. 

599 
01:14:15,147 --> 01:14:18,018 
We will traverse 
fourth. 

600 
01:14:18,276 --> 01:14:21,859 
-Where are they? 
Four-mile From the L. Angeles. 

601 
01:14:23,657 --> 01:14:28,118 
They use their power, 
to create other machines. 

602 
01:14:29,329 --> 01:14:33,162 
Disabling channels, 
stop playback. 

603 
01:14:34,084 --> 01:14:38,165 
We will reduce the number of 
at best. 

604 
01:14:39,632 --> 01:14:43,844 
War-damage. 
-By now, it's carnage. 

605 
01:14:44,304 --> 01:14:48,847 
-What do we do now? 
-Changes to the draft. 

606 
01:15:41,281 --> 01:15:43,607 
Damn! Fire! 

607 
01:16:29,041 --> 01:16:31,117 
Perfect! 

608 
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:43,548 
Yesterday was more 
one hundred groups. 

609 
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:46,547 
The attack failed us 
and divided. 

610 
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,135 
We seek 
our team. 

611 
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:52,641 
We discovered that 
if you shoot in the chest ... 

612 
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:55,646 
... destroyed instantly. 

613 
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:02,736 
Blow up half the building. 
The other half contains butane. 

614 
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:07,195 
It is sufficient to provoke 
explosion ... Volunteers? 

615 
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:10,246 
Show readiness to go back. 

616 
01:17:11,169 --> 01:17:14,254 
If you go, 
we have hope. 

617 
01:17:14,756 --> 01:17:18,968 
If you blow up the factory, 
might have a chance. 

618 
01:17:21,263 --> 01:17:23,422 
We will remain in the plan. 

619 
01:17:25,184 --> 01:17:28,139 
Jake, what's the plan? 

620 
01:17:31,024 --> 01:17:33,147 
I got an idea. 

621 
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:07,435 
How are you? 

622 
01:19:01,996 --> 01:19:04,155 
We have ten seconds. 

623 
01:19:05,709 --> 01:19:07,618 
Go. 

624 
01:19:08,086 --> 01:19:11,337 
Get out of here. 
Run as fast as you can. 

625 
01:19:11,757 --> 01:19:13,999 
-Madison, we can go. 
-You s'afino.
