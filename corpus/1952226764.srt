00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:05,861
[projector whirring]

2
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,408
- [sighs]

3
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:18,503
[pencil scratching]

4
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,034
[typewriter rattling]

5
00:01:54,781 --> 00:02:02,153
[air whooshing]

6
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,315
- <i>Dos passos.</i>

7
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,420
Wow, um...

8
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,007
No, I'm incredibly
flattered, obviously.

9
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,528
I just...

10
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,898
I would never have made
that comparison.

11
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,835
Although, I guess
I can see what you're saying,

12
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,738
'cause I mean, I did, obviously,
internalize a lot of that stuff.

13
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,402
The book is very...
it's classical.

14
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,673
But I mean,
it's also experimental.

15
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,839
It's a very strange novel.

16
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:05,908
I wasn't setting out to write
like any of the great writers.

17
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,351
But I did want
to distinguish myself

18
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:11,221
from the, you know,
the Franzens and the...

19
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:15,284
Lethams and the Eggerses
and the Fosters, Wallace.

20
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,855
I mean, look, I'm not
talking shit about those guys.

21
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,559
They're... I suppose
they're very good.

22
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,589
I don't read them,

23
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:25,161
but I sort of feel like...

24
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,332
Well, I sort of feel like
the novel, my novel,

25
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,432
is very complicated.

26
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,170
No, totally.

27
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,942
Oh, you're right.

28
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,314
Yeah, that's a lot of messages.

29
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,818
Not one phone call?

30
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,412
Well, you should just...
I mean, I don't care.

31
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,616
Fire her.

32
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,455
I mean, that's... accountants
are accountants, you know?

33
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,552
Like, you can...
I don't know.

34
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,656
I just... I don't even...

35
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,792
I don't even want to...

36
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,096
I don't care.

37
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,568
I don't want to...
I don't want to know.

38
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,504
I mean, I don't mean to be
cold or anything, but...

39
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,439
Yeah.

40
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,840
Yes.

41
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,835
Yeah, it's actually been
an amazing morning, yeah.

42
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,973
I mean, I've gotten
a lot of work done.

43
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,917
I think that I'm... you know,
I don't want to jinx anything,

44
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,112
but I think I'm sort of...

45
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,680
you know,
I think I'm getting there.

46
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,658
Yeah, I think...
I mean...

47
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,250
Look, we'll hit the deadline
or we won't.

48
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,661
I mean, it's like, you've said
that a hundred times, so...

49
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,427
Yeah.

50
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,401
[sighs]

51
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,812
Um, yes, I'm calling
for a Mr. Fuckface.

52
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,838
[laughing]

53
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:43,849
What's up, man?

54
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,373
I'm good.
I'm good.

55
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,646
How are you?

56
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,381
That's...
yeah, it has.

57
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,979
It's been a long time.

58
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,014
Dude...

59
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,118
I'm just...
hey, how are you?

60
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:59,689
I'm really... I don't know
how to answer that question.

61
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,393
Um, so no,
I just need to tell you...

62
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,992
like, I don't know, like...

63
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,025
apropos of nothing,

64
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,164
I was in a closet today,
and I found...

65
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:10,004
do you remember that old
tweed jacket I used to wear

66
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,477
for every second
of every day?

67
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,072
So I found that jacket,
and I pulled it out,

68
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,105
and there was a clinking
in the pockets.

69
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,412
And I reached in the pockets,

70
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,419
and there were these
six little airplane bottles

71
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:24,856
of potato vodka
that you gave to me

72
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,324
right before
my first book tour.

73
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,486
And I just...
I never drank them.

74
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,587
I wanted to save them
for a special occasion.

75
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,098
Anyway, what are you...

76
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,499
what are you doing tonight?

77
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,730
I just think
we need to hang out.

78
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,034
Like, it's been...
it's been...

79
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,032
well, let me just ask you,
like, have you eaten?

80
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,171
I'm fucking starving to death,
literally.

81
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,441
Yeah, I just...

82
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,676
Are you... you still work
in the same place, right?

83
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:54,050
'Cause I was thinking you could
drive maybe by Taste of India

84
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,214
and grab some Indian food
and bring it over.

85
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,916
I just feel like Indian food.

86
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,085
I haven't eaten anything today,
except, like, I took a...

87
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:06,064
I had a weird, like,
a bizarre brie incident

88
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,330
that I will describe to you
in detail.

89
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,806
But, yeah, like, so can you
go by Taste of India and...

90
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,966
Perfect.

91
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,497
I always get
the chicken tikka masala.

92
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,342
Yeah, and, like,
the saag paneer is really good.

93
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,439
And I like
the mulligatawny soup.

94
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,347
And make sure they...

95
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,908
I mean, make sure
there's chicken in it,

96
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,317
just 'cause the other...

97
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,446
yeah, it's daal,
I think it's called.

98
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,047
Anyway, it's really,
really good.

99
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,455
And then just get
whatever you want

100
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,016
and, you know,
some naan or whatever.

101
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,528
And I'll... it's totally my treat.

102
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,688
I just
can't wait to see you.

103
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,291
And we will crack
the potato vodka bottles

104
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,825
and sort of
make a night of it.

105
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,394
All right, cool.

106
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,838
Well, I can't wait to see you,
and I'll see you very soon.

107
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,069
Okay, bye.

108
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,183
Dude.

109
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,741
- Hey.
- Hey.

110
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,914
Welcome.
- Thanks.

111
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:07,051
- Um, I ate the couch
'cause I was starving, so...

112
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,391
But we can have this too.

113
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,591
- I...

114
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,606
I think
you're a terrible friend.

115
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,040
- [laughs]

116
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,043
I know.

117
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,044
I think you're...

118
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,272
- You're an asshole.

119
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,441
You've always been...

120
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,781
You've always been
a total asshole

121
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,287
and a really terrible friend.

122
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,917
Um...

123
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,297
I, uh...

124
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:11,015
- It's just sort of about this
sense that a lot of people get,

125
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,354
a lot of people my age get,

126
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,120
who are sort of
in their early, mid-30s

127
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,324
of sort of going through life
performing a role, you know,

128
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,626
that you're sort of...

129
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,599
that you're just sort of...

130
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,398
you know, you're trying
to seem like something.

131
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,699
And I don't know...

132
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,434
It's hard to describe, I guess,

133
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,305
but that's more or less
what it's about.

134
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,708
And it's very personal.

135
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,234
It has a lot to do
with where I've been

136
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,439
in the last...

137
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,380
- So you're proud of it?
You're really...

138
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,144
- Yes, I'm very proud of it.

139
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,515
I'm glad it's out there.

140
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,885
I mean, I don't expect it
to ever be as popular

141
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,618
as the first book,
but I kind of...

142
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,183
I think this is my...
this book is sort of

143
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:51,060
my attempt to make peace
with that

144
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,292
and to say
that it's okay with me.

145
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,596
- And I mean,
I guess along the same lines,

146
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,468
I mean, this being
your second novel,

147
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,698
I mean, what was the...

148
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,900
- Third novel.

149
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,499
There was another.
There was a second.

150
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,510
This is the third...

151
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,671
<i>Dumb Show</i> is the third novel.

152
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:10,148
The second novel
was <i>Hoarse Salute.</i>

153
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,548
Actually, here, it's...

154
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:16,351
That's my copy for the reading,
but I'll get you a copy of it.

155
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,515
You know, I was so...

156
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,752
we got so much attention
for that first novel

157
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,054
and for the,
you know, the movie,

158
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,355
though the movie
never came out

159
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,297
and all the other sort of deals
that came along with it.

160
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,028
I really wanted
to write something experimental

161
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,504
and really try and do something

162
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,666
new and different
and be shocking,

163
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,176
if that's what it took,
you know?

164
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,370
And what I discovered

165
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,380
was that nobody
really was interested

166
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,110
in that gesture.

167
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,883
And so there is a huge stack
of those books in my house...

168
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,354
- Oh, no.

169
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,378
- I think it's good,

170
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,550
but then again,
I don't know.

171
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,150
Anyway, I'll get you one.

172
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,854
- Oh, please.
No, please, yeah.

173
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,795
I mean, if it's not out there,
definitely.

174
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,320
That's great.

175
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,731
Yay, well, I don't want to
take up too much of your time.

176
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,702
- I have nothing else to do.

177
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,137
- Oh, that's got to be a joke.

178
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,198
- No, I wish it were a joke,

179
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,674
but there's nothing else
for me to do.

180
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,177
- Got to rehearse
for the...

181
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,542
for the lecture,
I'm sure.

182
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,911
Can I, um,
off the record,

183
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,075
do you have a girlfriend?

184
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,678
- Um, no, I don't.

185
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,054
That's very encouraging of you
to have asked that, though.

186
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,581
Thank you.

187
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,323
The idea to have a girlfriend
is pretty... it's refreshing.

188
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,853
Hadn't thought
about that for a while.

189
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,457
- Well, if they smell your hair,
they might want to...

190
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,367
- That's right,
'cause Aveda products, yeah.

191
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,530
Although, today it'll probably
smell just like sort of,

192
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,233
you know, motel...

193
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,740
- Generic shampoo.
- Motel shampoo.

194
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,106
- The title is "Shampoo."

195
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,906
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

196
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,311
Wow, um, well, I don't want to,
you know, bore you

197
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,507
with any more silly questions.

198
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,913
- Please,
it's not boring at all.

199
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,679
It's really...
it's very... it's refreshing.

200
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,347
- Well, I'm so thrilled
to come to your lecture.

201
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,950
If there's ever a huge fan,
that is I.

202
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,357
I am your biggest fan.

203
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,919
I mean, I'll be there tonight
with, you know, a sign...

204
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,021
- Oh, excellent.

205
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,362
- A big copy
of your book cover, yeah.

206
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,699
- Is it gonna say, like,
"John 3:15" or whatever?

207
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,931
- Yeah, definitely,
Bible verses, all the way.

208
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,098
Yeah, well...

209
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,129
- The Bible of novels.

210
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,165
- Yes.
[laughs]

211
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,143
I'll be dressed
as Mary Magdalene, so...

212
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,611
- Oh, good.

213
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,581
I'm sure you'll be easy to spot,
although kids today...

214
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,742
- Yeah, well, yeah.

215
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,376
They say they see me in chips,
you know?

216
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,613
- [laughs]

217
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,053
- Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.

218
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,613
- My pleasure.
Thank you.

219
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:32,749
Thanks for your interest.

220
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,850
- Oh, of course.
Any time.

221
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:34,951
Yeah.

222
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,859
And off the record,
I'd date you.

223
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,420
- Aw.

224
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,692
- Okay, yeah, I would, yeah.

225
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,597
- Yeah, make sure
that's off the record.

226
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,864
Don't want that
getting around.

227
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,303
- Well, yay, well,
thank you so much for your time.

228
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,396
- Yeah, thank you.

229
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,600
- Can I get a hug from you,

230
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,541
'cause I feel like
I kind of know you.

231
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,441
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

232
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,445
- Thanks.

233
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,446
Yay.

234
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,243
Well, thank you.

235
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,749
- Thank you.
- Oh.

236
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,750
You're a good hugger.

237
00:11:58,784 --> 00:11:59,751
- Um, thank you.

238
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,810
- Wait, wait,
before I go,

239
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,617
can I get this copy signed?

240
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:04,714
- Yeah, yeah.

241
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,225
- My boyfriend's
a huge fan and...

242
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,283
- Your... oh, really?

243
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,522
- Yeah, he, yeah,
loves your work.

244
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,394
I think
if he doesn't have to work,

245
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,591
he'll come
to the lecture too.

246
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,690
We'll both be, "Whoo!"

247
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,066
- Aw, awesome.

248
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,266
- Like a pro.

249
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,968
Thank you so much.
- Oh, thank you very much.

250
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:23,975
- Thank you.

251
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,374
- Um, see you tonight?

252
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,402
- Yeah, all right.
Thank you.

253
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,413
Thank you.
- All right.

254
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,278
- Bye.
- Bye.

255
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:46,023
[pencil scratching]

256
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,940
Boyfriend.

257
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,949

258
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:11,981

260
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,648

00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,375
[horse chuffs]

262
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,672
- Hey, there.

263
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,145
- Hey.

264
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,114
- Is Dylan home?

265
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,845
- No, I haven't seen him.

266
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,115
- Could you
do me a favor?

267
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,519
- Yeah.

268
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,113
- Could you
put these inside for me?

269
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,455
- Uh, sure.

270
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,403
Is that a gun?

271
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,409
- Yeah.

272
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,901
Cougar.

273
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,277
See you.

274
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,179
- See you.

275
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,136
Hello?

276
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:27,554
[engine rumbling]

277
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,149
Surprise!

278
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,428
[laughs]

279
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,557
- I think, uh...
I had a feeling you'd be here.

280
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,898
I think it was
the Prius blocking my driveway

281
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,903
that tipped me off.

282
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:05,926
- Right.
Oh, yeah, sorry.

283
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:06,995
Sorry about that.

284
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,301
Your gate was locked,

285
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,865
so I just figured
I would leave my car up there

286
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:15,846
and vault the fence
like an Olympic athlete.

287
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,644
You should've been there.

288
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,445
- Well, do you want to come in,

289
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,455
or do you want
to keep sitting in pinesap?

290
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,024
- Uh, well, I'll come in.

291
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:31,985
Right.

292
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,249
This is sort of
an awkward question,

293
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:04,422
but does sap
come out of jeans?

294
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,090
- Yeah.

295
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,565
You have to soak them
in vegetable oil,

296
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,364
and kerosene
will get it out too.

297
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,133
- Okay.

298
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,572
Um...

299
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,308
This is a really nice place.

300
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,371
Is this all wood?

301
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,145
- It's all wood.

302
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,651
- Um, it's really...

303
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,278
I mean, it's pretty out here.

304
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,118
It's...

305
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,090
a little remote.

306
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,252
You know, I had to...

307
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,454
I was giving...

308
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,861
I was doing a reading
at Whitman College,

309
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,264
and I figured
eastern Washington,

310
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,166
you live in eastern Washington.

311
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,399
I figured I would just,
you know... how, you know...

312
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,100
I would just come here
after the reading.

313
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,369
And, you know,
it seemed like

314
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,240
it was in the same
neighborhood-ish, and so I...

315
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,245
- You know Walla Walla's
four hours away from here.

316
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,268
- Yeah.

317
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,010
Yes,
almost exactly four hours,

318
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,917
as I learned
on the four-hour drive

319
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:04,080
from Walla Walla
to here.

320
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,386
Um...

321
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,120
But, you know,
it was a nice drive.

322
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,422
It was pretty.

323
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,951
People talk about
eastern Washington

324
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,487
like it's some kind of
fucking hell on earth,

325
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,932
but I thought it was
actually quite pretty.

326
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,430
Um...

327
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,672
That's a lot
of logs out there.

328
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:33,481
Again, the wood theme.

329
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,542
- We're in the woods.

330
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:38,420
- Yes, literally.

331
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,890
But yeah, I just...

332
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,018
you know, I'm not in eastern
Washington all that often,

333
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,550
as you may or may not know.

334
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,462
But I just figured...
I don't know...

335
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:49,058
I really... thought
I was gonna be here,

336
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,762
you know, you lived here,

337
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,396
and I just thought
it would be nice to...

338
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,004
- How'd you find the place?

339
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,271
- Uh...

340
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:04,908
I went to your office
looking for you,

341
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,781
'cause that was
the address I had.

342
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:10,015
And...

343
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,991
they told me
where you live with, like...

344
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,788
I could've been anybody.

345
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:21,823
I still got really, incredibly,
super-embarrassingly lost.

346
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,650
- Do you want
something to drink?

347
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,553
- Yes.

348
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,557
That would be great.

349
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,388
Anything
would be really good.

350
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,593
- I've got beer
or heavy cream.

351
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,157
- Hm.

352
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,896
Let's...
I'll start with beer.

353
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,063
And then we'll just
sort of see how it goes.

354
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,808
Thank you.

355
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,611
Um...

356
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:22,457
So I was in here earlier
before you showed up.

357
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,688
I came inside.

358
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:24,717
I've been here for a while.

359
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,857
And I was outside,
sitting there,

360
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,562
and your friend

361
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,696
with the horse
and the gun,

362
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:38,107
he gave me that bag and said,
"Please put it inside."

363
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,474
He didn't actually say "please."

364
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,536
And he didn't give it to me
so much as throw it

365
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,411
around where I was,
but I got it.

366
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,814
And I came inside
and put it down,

367
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,182
and that was all.

368
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,086
I just...
and I went back out.

369
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,383
- It's fine.

370
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,947
- Okay, I just, you know...

371
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:59,089
like, I didn't want to just be
taking liberties and stuff.

372
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,927
- Well, I'm sorry I wasn't here
when you got here.

373
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,730
I was out shooting pictures
for an article.

374
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,032
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

375
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:10,508
Um, you are a photographer also?

376
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:16,003
- I'm everything
at this paper.

377
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,483
- It's good to be everything.

378
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,249
- What was the story?

379
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,279
- Log jam.

380
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,502
You hungry?

381
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,508
- Yes.

382
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,534
I'm incredibly hungry.

383
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,056
Are you hungry?

384
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,356
- Yeah.

385
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,210
- These aren't normal beans
either, are they?

386
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,945
They're not...
I mean...

387
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:30,421
- Well, they're regular beans.

388
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,802
The thing
about having a beard...

389
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,573
food everywhere.

390
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,672
- Instant leftovers.
- Instant leftovers.

391
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:00,446
And you smell it
on your mustache the next day,

392
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,180
which can be good...

393
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,414
- I guess
it depends on the food.

394
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,581
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

395
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,820
You want to probably
have to think about food

396
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,087
in a totally different way.

397
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,355
- Yeah, well,
and you have to...

398
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:14,024
- You think about not just
the smell of the moment

399
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,556
but the longevity of the smell.

400
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,795
- And I really
have to be careful

401
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,667
not to smear it
all over my face,

402
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,035
like I usually do.

403
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,061
- Yeah.

404
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,668
Yeah, I mean,
a typical night for me,

405
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,703
I'll just smear a jar of
peanut butter all over my body

406
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,772
and let the cats lick it off.

407
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,975
- Yeah, yeah.

408
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,814
- It's a good night.
- Mm-hmm.

409
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,880
You still have that cat,
that black one?

410
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,185
- No.

411
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,624
- What happened?

412
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,821
- [sighs]

413
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,659
Um...
[clears throat]

414
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:50,225
Well, it...

415
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,997
Technically,
she committed suicide.

416
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,334
- [laughing]

417
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,736
- I mean,
I don't think that cats do.

418
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:55,967
I don't think
that cats can.

419
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,941
It's just,
the cat fell out of a window

420
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,877
that, I mean, technically, she
couldn't have fallen out of.

421
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,504
She had to have jumped.

422
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:03,878
But I don't know.

423
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,883
It was... I mean,
it was really sad,

424
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:09,216
but it was also
strangely embarrassing.

425
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:12,121
And the people at the,
you know,

426
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,751
the animal control
were really, like...

427
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,283
they were really accusatory.

428
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,420
But it's not like I didn't take
care of the cat, you know?

429
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,953
I really...
- You really loved that cat.

430
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:20,965
- I loved that cat.

431
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,728
But, yeah.

432
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,531
She is...
she's gone.

433
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,935
- That's too bad.

434
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,166
- Well,
it's probably better off.

435
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:38,312
Um, yeah, dark
and also incredibly quiet.

436
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,476
- Yeah.

437
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:44,113
- It's, I mean...
it's scary.

438
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,352
For me, it's unsettling

439
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,986
just 'cause I never have,
you know...

440
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,690
I've never been out of the city
for very long.

441
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,029
- It definitely
took some getting used to.

442
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,694
But you know,
you get used to it.

443
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,328
You definitely
get used to the quiet

444
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:04,069
and the dark and...

445
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,669
I've made some friends
with the local wildlife.

446
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:10,442
- [chuckles]

447
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:14,213
What kind of animals do you have
to encounter around here?

448
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:18,188
'Cause I read a thing
that said black bear, you know?

449
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,384
- Black bears are...
they're dangerous.

450
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,824
I won't lie to you.

451
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,919
- Thank you.

452
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:24,929
For that,
I thank you.

453
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:25,952
- I mean, they will...

454
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,157
- If not
for the pork and beans.

455
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,756
- They will kill you
as soon as look at you.

456
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,290
- Yeah, 'cause they're bears.

457
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,132
- And oftentimes,
they won't look at you at all.

458
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,831
They'll just...
they'll kill you without...

459
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,533
no look, swipe.

460
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,473
But they usually hide
in the mountains.

461
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,443
And they don't come out
unless there's no food

462
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,637
up in the mountains.

463
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:44,512
And so, I mean,
the bears kind of keep clear.

464
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,814
And we keep our doors shut,
and we throw away any...

465
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:48,978
we don't let food set out.

466
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,012
And there are rules
of living in the forest.

467
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:57,323
And, you know, you don't lie,
say, covered with peanut butter.

468
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,557
- Um, okay.
Fair enough.

469
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,087
- Oh, and there are big cats.

470
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,600
And there are, like,
mountain lions and cougars.

471
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,500
- That guy with the gun...

472
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,868
- Jim.
- Jim.

473
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:07,929
He had a gun.

474
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,304
He had a rifle
across his lap.

475
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,899
And I was like, "Hey."

476
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,810
You know, I was like,
"Hey, fella, is that a gun?"

477
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,575
- Yeah, Jim's pretty great.

478
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,013
He's very unique.

479
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,243
He's a great guy.

480
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,412
I mean, hopefully
you'll get to know him

481
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:26,048
if you decide to stick around,
but...

482
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,558
- Um, I would love
to stick around.

483
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,356
- Yeah, you should.
I mean, it's too dark to...

484
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:31,589
You're not
gonna find your way.

485
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:32,596
- Yeah.

486
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,961
I mean, broad daylight,

487
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,761
there's no way I could
find my way back to my car

488
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,028
at this point.

489
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,296
But he said...
Yeah, he's like...

490
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,099
I said, "Is that a gun,"
and he's like, "Yeah."

491
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,867
And he just said, "Cougar."

492
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,897
- [laughing]

493
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,705
- Which, I assume,
means that...

494
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,540
I mean, that's probably
not the name of his gun.

495
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,012
- He thought
that was your name.

496
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,241
- [laughs]

497
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,146
That is my spirit name

498
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,411
and my spirit animal.

499
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,419
- Yeah.

500
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:58,616
- Yeah, so there's a cougar
on the loose?

501
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:01,056
- Yeah, they keep him
in captivia.

502
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,424
Captivia.
I said "captivia."

503
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,428
- I drive a captivia.

504
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,020
- Bridge to Captivia?

505
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,862
Great book.

506
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,868
No, the cougars are...
they live here.

507
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,802
They live in the mountains,
and they live around.

508
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,465
Again, like bears,
if they feel threatened

509
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:19,169
or hungry, they'll come after
something with two legs,

510
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,668
but generally, they don't.

511
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,205
- Any old thing
with two legs?

512
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,548
- Yeah.

513
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,452
Mostly toddlers.

514
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:31,682
- Well, toddlers are delicious.

515
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,747
- They are delicious.

516
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,587
Actually, the sausage...

517
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,186
- Toddler,
roasted red pepper, and corn.

518
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,822
- That's what
they raise 'em for out here.

519
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,080
- So there's one thing
I've been wanting to ask you

520
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,607
ever since I got in here.

521
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,713
Where is the other antler?

522
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,882
- [laughs]

523
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,690
- And did you...
I mean, did you bag this beast?

524
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,126
I mean,
look at the bone fragments,

525
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,151
and there's hair on there.

526
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,493
- That's not my handiwork.

527
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,863
- You could never
have done this when I knew you.

528
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,231
- No, I didn't do it.

529
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,997
- Where did you...
you didn't find it, did you?

530
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,129
- I found it, yeah.

531
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,433
- And it's attached
to the skull.

532
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,871
I guess I always
sort of assumed

533
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,932
that it just sort of started
right there on the scalp.

534
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,603
- Well, hunters
are brutal sometimes.

535
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:28,976
They don't stuff
all of their kills.

536
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:33,211
They sometimes just hack it
to pieces in the woods.

537
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,479
- Wow.
- Yeah.

538
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,316
- And drink the blood.
You've done that, right?

539
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,651
You've hunted and stuff?

540
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,849
Did you drink the blood?

541
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,948
- Yeah.

542
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,424
- Was it awesome?

543
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,051
[laughs]

544
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:46,962
- No, I've never...
I haven't gone out hunting.

545
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:50,399
- Well...

546
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,595
well, you'll be a man one day.

547
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,625
You can do that.

548
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,506
I'm a little concerned
with the fact

549
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,540
that you have so many
different kinds of beer.

550
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:09,985
But I guess that's just
the way it is in the country.

551
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,747
- Well, this doesn't seem like
you have much concern for...

552
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,454
- I know.
I mean, I'm getting over it.

553
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:23,525
Well, here's to, you know,
everything being good again.

554
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,780
- I don't... you know,
I don't want you to think

555
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:45,220
that everything's all right.

556
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,190
I know it's...
it's good to see you,

557
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,556
and I'm glad
that you made it,

558
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:52,461
and I'm glad that, you know,
we had sausage and beans

559
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,727
and everything, but...

560
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,704
I...

561
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,707
I think you're still an asshole,
you know?

562
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,655
I'm gonna go outside
and think.

563
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,055
I need some air.

564
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,162
[door closes]

565
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:58,352
[wood splitting]

566
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:00,781
That was good.

567
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:15,201
- I've never seen anyone
doing that in real life before.

568
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,365
- It's called splitting wood.

569
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,635
You want to help?

570
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:22,612
- Um, it's not that
I don't want to...

571
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:23,614
exactly.

572
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:24,637
- Yeah.

573
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,912
Hey, you met Jim yesterday,
right?

574
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,111
- Yeah.
- Eric, Jim, Jim, Eric.

575
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,450
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey, man.

576
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,353
- Hey, did you want some coffee?

577
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,086
I think
there's some in the cupboard

578
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,559
if you want to make some.

579
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,562
- Uh, okay.

580
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,803
Are you gonna split
all of those logs?

581
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:47,929
- Yep.

582
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:53,274
We had to cut this tree up
the other day.

583
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,370
And now we're gonna burn it...
just out of spite.

584
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:59,042
- Sometimes that's
the best thing you can do.

585
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:03,417
I'd love to help,
but I only brought this, so...

586
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:06,582
it just seems like it would be
an insult to everybody.

587
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,182
I'll make the coffee.

588
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,989
- All right.

589
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,723
- Are you guys
drinking coffee?

590
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,856
- Yeah, I'll have some.
- I'm good.

591
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,730
- Okay.

592
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,269
- Thanks, Eric.
- Yeah.

593
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,512
- Yeah!

594
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,072
I own you.

595
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,640
- Do it.

596
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,244
- You ever wonder
what it would be like

597
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,046
to bury an axe
into somebody's head?

598
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,983
- Sure.

599
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:11,455
That's natural.

600
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,047
- I just
think about it sometimes.

601
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:21,721
- I say
we just fucking burn it.

602
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,852
- Yeah, or blow it up.

603
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,088
Can we get
explosives in town?

604
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,357
- Mm-hmm.

605
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,533
What would Dracula do?

606
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,068
Nothing.

607
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,770
- Probably nothing,
yeah, he'd probably...

608
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,778
- Do absolutely nothing.
- Turn into a bat, at best.

609
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:42,870
- And leave.

610
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:43,880
- Yeah, he'd...

611
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,212
- Make like Dracula
and leave.

612
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,347
- Yeah.

613
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,099
- This doesn't
make any sense.

614
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,527
[sighs]

615
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:13,826
Um, so could you make a...

616
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,805
like a burl clock
out of that

617
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,206
even though
it isn't technically driftwood?

618
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,369
- Yeah, that's kind of
what I planned to do.

619
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,174
Actually,
there's one inside there.

620
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,737
- You just have to find it.
- Yeah.

621
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,249
- That's the sculpted...
- I've got to... I've got to...

622
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:29,878
I've got to make sure that
I get it out of the wood intact.

623
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,184
- Um, well, I was just
in there reading the book

624
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,054
about spiders
and their kin,

625
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,683
and I got
a little creeped out,

626
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,421
so I thought
maybe I'd go for a walk.

627
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,088
So anything good
to see around here?

628
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,357
- Yeah, you know what?

629
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:44,094
There's a path
down to the river right there.

630
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,101
It just goes right down.

631
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,261
You have
to stay to the right,

632
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,292
but just...
you'll see it.

633
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,464
It'll take you
to the river.

634
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,909
- And...

635
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,002
Jim, did you say
there was a cougar around?

636
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,104
- Yeah, he's around.

637
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,842
- Uh, is it likely

638
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,875
that I'm going
to run into him or anything?

639
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:05,685
- Well, if you do, scream.

640
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,247
- Yeah, make yourself...

641
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,691
just make yourself
big and loud.

642
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:13,788
Just make... just, like,
stand as tall as you can.

643
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:14,855
Right?

644
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,093
- Yeah.

645
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,191
- Really?

646
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,462
Just if I see it anywhere,

647
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:19,901
just be really...

648
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,838
I don't want to maybe just,
like... I don't know...

649
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,135
- Well, you could run.

650
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,801
- Yeah, but the cougar
can run really fast.

651
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,105
- Yeah, you don't want to run.

652
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:30,238
- Well, you know,
you're damned if you do...

653
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,475
- Right.

654
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,641
- They're hard to predict.

655
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,277
But I think,
you know, big...

656
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:38,948
- Loud.
- Loud.

657
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,651
- Um, all right,
maybe I should stay in

658
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,922
and read some more
about spiders.

659
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,258
- It's a freaky book.
I don't know.

660
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,422
- Yeah.

661
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:47,794
I mean, what are the odds?

662
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,890
It's a big river.

663
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,094
- Yeah.

664
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,159
- There's no way of knowing.

665
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,260
- Cougars
don't like water.

666
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:54,532
Cats don't like water.

667
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,097
They tend
to stay away from rivers.

668
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,666
- Especially
if they have rabies.

669
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,200
You know,
rabies is just hydrophobia,

670
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,805
fear of water.

671
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,008
- That's not true.
- Okay.

672
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,881
Well, I'm gonna go down there
and check it out.

673
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,408
- Have a good time.
- All right.

674
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,552
Stay to the right?

675
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,895
- Yeah, to the right.

676
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,956
Just follow the...

677
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,024
- My right?

678
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,365
- Yeah, well,
not your right now.

679
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,562
Turn around
and to your right.

680
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,866
- Okay.
- Yeah, now to your right.

681
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,372
- Okay.

682
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,842
- Just stay on the path...

683
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,366
of righteousness.

684
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,623
- Nice axe work there, buddy.

685
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,255
You want to trade
in a minute?

686
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,354
- Yes.

687
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,158
- Well, tough shit.

688
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:41,895
[making robot stomping sounds]

689
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,235
Rrr...

690
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:48,335
I have the strength
of ten trees.

691
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:43,233
- Chopping wood all day.

692
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:46,668
That's... good.

693
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,171
Nice.

694
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,341
What are you doing?

695
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,349
- I don't know.

696
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:00,680
- What are you, gay?

697
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:02,309
- Yeah, probably.

698
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,589
Play a little T-ball,
little stickball.

699
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,467
Jesus.

700
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,666
What the fuck...

701
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,834
- I'm gonna fuck this rock up.

702
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:27,309
Do it,
do it, do it.

703
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,868
Do it.

704
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,347
- Here's a good rock.

705
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:38,150
- Hey, who wants to join
the polar bear club?

706
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,055
- Thought the cougar got you.

707
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,082
- That cougar
was no match for me.

708
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,586
What's happening?
- How you doing?

709
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,962
- Hey, I'm not doing anything,
just checking out your river.

710
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,330
- Yeah, it's pretty nice, huh?

711
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,767
- It is, you know,
for a river.

712
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,930
I mean,
I've seen better, not many.

713
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:56,337
- Do you want
to skip some rocks?

714
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,398
- Yes, I tried
to do that earlier.

715
00:47:58,442 --> 00:47:59,670
It didn't
work out that well.

716
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,009
I don't think
I ever gained that technique.

717
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,673
Maybe it was just
the poor rock selection.

718
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,807
- Yeah, that's probably it.

719
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,874
- I'm sure
that's what it is.

720
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,442
My technique
is obviously flawless.

721
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,351
- I'd blame the rocks.

722
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:17,156
- It's a poor musician
who blames his tools.

723
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,388
Something like that.

724
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,487
I'm working on it.
I'm not ready yet.

725
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,054
What have you guys
been up to?

726
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,896
- Chopping wood all day.

727
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,903
[somber guitar music]

728
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:34,935
# #

729
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,448
- Hey, Dylan,
did you get those books?

730
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,184
- They're in the green bag,
actually.

731
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,555
- Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

732
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,319
- This one's really good.

733
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:28,194
- The women...
or <i>Women.</i>

734
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:29,493
- Yeah.

735
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:31,023
- You've read Bukowski,
haven't you?

736
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:35,562
- Uh, yeah, yes.

737
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:39,063
Not extensively,
but I've read some Bukowski.

738
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,474
- You should read more.

739
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,742
He's the Shakespeare of
drinking, fucking, and puking.

740
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:45,805
- [laughs]

741
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,111
I think that's...

742
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,742
I think that's probably true,
actually.

743
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:50,912
Although, you know, there
is some drinking and fucking

744
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,444
in Shakespeare,

745
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,855
not a lot of puking.

746
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,485
- That's where he comes in.

747
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:05,097
- Yeah, I mean, I really...

748
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:08,798
I have to admit
that I sort of...

749
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,501
I had a Bukowski period.

750
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,032
- Bew-kowski.

751
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,738
- Where you liked Bukowski?

752
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,178
- Well, I mean...

753
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:18,374
I don't know.

754
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,905
I guess I just sort of
go back and forth,

755
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:24,819
'cause I feel like he was
a drunk and a, like, wife beater

756
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:28,291
and a, like,
total degenerate slob.

757
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,259
But he did dedicate
his life to writing,

758
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:35,026
so you got to admire
at least his dedication.

759
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,362
But there's
moments in the poems

760
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,231
that are really
pretty beautiful.

761
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:39,360
I mean, whatever.

762
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,030
I haven't really read...

763
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:43,096
I haven't read all of it,
'cause I don't think you can.

764
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,539
I think, like,
you could start today

765
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,405
and never read everything
he ever wrote.

766
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,608
Fuck.

767
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:55,084
That's some...
that plum brandy is pretty good.

768
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:56,881
- I brought another,
my friend.

769
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,887
- All right.

770
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:00,355
- I'll match your tongue.

771
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,325
- So how did you get into...

772
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:09,060
how were you introduced
to Bukowski, Jim?

773
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,259
- Friend of mine.

774
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,791
We were younger.

775
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:13,803
- Yeah.

776
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,168
- He read everything.

777
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,365
I don't read that much,

778
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,271
so everything he read
back in high school

779
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:21,209
I've been reading
one book at a time per year.

780
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,644
So he's an easy read.

781
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,581
I mean...

782
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,106
I don't like
to read that much,

783
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,244
but I do like...

784
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,255
he keeps it pretty simple,
so...

785
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:35,258
- One book per year
or one book at a time...

786
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,817
- I usually finish a book a year
and start about three.

787
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,352
I always find myself
able to finish Bukowski

788
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,228
because he doesn't fuck around.

789
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,562
There's no...
nothing.

790
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,965
I can understand
what he's saying.

791
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:46,764
- There's no even compound
sentences, really.

792
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,065
- Yeah.

793
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,573
- Which is pretty good,
actually, if you can do that.

794
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,472
- I think he's good.

795
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:56,673
- Yeah, I mean,
I had real problem with him

796
00:51:56,713 --> 00:52:01,480
at a certain point, 'cause
I thought it was, you know,

797
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:03,076
artless.

798
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,612
But now that's sort of
what I like about him.

799
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,681
- He's got something.

800
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,454
- He's got cirrhosis
of the liver.

801
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,461
- Well, he did.

802
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:12,860
- Yeah.

803
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:15,456
- Got to have something.

804
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:17,763
So what do you do, man?

805
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:22,033
- Um, I write books.

806
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:23,539
- That's what Dylan told me.

807
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,473
He told me you wrote words.

808
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:26,806
- I do write words, largely.

809
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,140
I specialize in words.

810
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:31,170
But when they come
all together,

811
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:34,274
they turn into books,
when it goes correctly.

812
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,081
And I usually finish about one
every two years.

813
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,678
- If you're writing
or if you're reading?

814
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:40,656
- Writing.
I read a few more.

815
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:44,421
- You write
about twice what I read.

816
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:45,428
- Or half.

817
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,191
I write half
of what you read.

818
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,629
- You got me on that one.

819
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,792
- I'm not a math magician,
but...

820
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,927
- Another to mass magicians,
mass magicians.

821
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,494
- To the mass magicians.

822
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,938
And all night long,

823
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:00,534
I was just trying to, like,
you know, saying charming things

824
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:04,035
to get her to sort of notice
that I was sitting next to her,

825
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,810
but she just never did, the
whole night, the whole night.

826
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,841
And it was like ten hours.

827
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:10,375
- But she was sitting
this close to you?

828
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,718
- Yes, and I think maybe
one time she looked over

829
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,316
and went like this

830
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,019
and then went back over
to her boyfriend.

831
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:21,497
And I was just, like,
feeling increasingly alienated

832
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,396
and dislocated and just, like...

833
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,661
I don't know.

834
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,601
The way my life was
at that point was very bizarre.

835
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:31,198
And anyway,
she stood up at one point

836
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,368
and was talking to somebody else
that was passing by

837
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,570
'cause it was just a night...

838
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,011
everybody in this bar
was, like, really famous

839
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,949
with the exception of myself
and maybe one or two waiters.

840
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:46,547
And she stood up at one point,
and she had...

841
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:51,152
I mean, her ass was right there
in front of my face,

842
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:53,025
like, it couldn't...

843
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:57,557
Like, my face could've been
inside her ass,

844
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,364
'cause it was
that close to me.

845
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,963
And she stood there for
what felt like... I don't know...

846
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:05,338
like a half an hour
talking to this person.

847
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:08,310
And her ass paid more
attention to me than she did

848
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:09,676
the whole night long.

849
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:12,341
And I was looking at it,
and, I mean, I felt weird

850
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,543
'cause her boyfriend
was right there.

851
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:15,983
And I didn't...
I mean...

852
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,281
But then again,
at the same time,

853
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,117
it's Liv Tyler's ass,

854
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:23,285
you know, like literally
right in front of my face.

855
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:27,285
And I was staring at it
because it was hypnotic.

856
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,991
And I just didn't...
I just had...

857
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,795
there was nothing
I could do

858
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:36,773
but look deep, deep into
the soul of Liv Tyler's ass,

859
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:37,932
which was at eye...

860
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:39,339
we were making eye contact.

861
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,741
If her ass had eyes,

862
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:44,304
I would've been looking deep,
deep into her eyes.

863
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:47,976
And then she sat down
next to me,

864
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:50,748
and I felt like
I had a secret from her

865
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,755
that I didn't know how to tell.

866
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,814
And it was really awkward.

867
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:56,382
And, you know,
sooner or later,

868
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,758
she gave me another, like...

869
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,626
And then her boyfriend
gave me a look

870
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,598
that I couldn't
really quite decipher,

871
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,623
like, it was...
like maybe he knew.

872
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:06,329
But I'm sure he looks
at her ass all the time.

873
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,337
He probably gets tired
of looking at it, actually.

874
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:11,101
So there I was,
and that was the night.

875
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,440
And I just sort of felt
like that was the level

876
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,206
that I had reached in life.

877
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,874
Like, I got to be at the table
with Liz Tyler,

878
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:21,145
but I only got
to talk to her ass.

879
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:25,553
- Have a telepathic conversation
with her butt hole.

880
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,647
- Now, did...

881
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,319
- Teach her how to smile
and use a period.

882
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,327
- [laughing]

883
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:32,555
- That's what I'm talking about.

884
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:33,721
- Yeah, a little punctuation.

885
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,230
- That's true.

886
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:37,790
Is there any more...

887
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,495
Serbian.

888
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,163
- It's not Serbian, dude.

889
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:44,298
All right, this is
to Liv Tyler's asshole.

890
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,903
- I feel like
I shouldn't drink to it,

891
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:52,210
'cause it's like violating
a friendship or something.

892
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:53,237
- Shut up.

893
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,773
[glasses clank]

894
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,649
Shut up.
Shut up.

895
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:03,489
- God!
Fuck.

896
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,461
I wish I knew
some Polack jokes.

897
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:07,793
I think
that would liven the mood.

898
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,857
- Yep.

899
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,391
- What's black and white
and has a dirty name?

900
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,336
- What?

901
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,600
- Sister Mary Fuckface.

902
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:21,736
- [laughing]

903
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,040
- I can never remember a joke.

904
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,013
- I can't either.

905
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,380
- I always... but that's something
I really wish I knew how to do

906
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,384
is tell jokes,

907
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,851
but I just
could never do it.

908
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,787
Play jokes... or tell jokes
and play an instrument.

909
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,289
I could never do
either one of those.

910
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:35,689
- You could play.

911
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:39,684
- I really, really can't,

912
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,664
as Dylan
will happily tell you.

913
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,235
Don't get me started
on this administration

914
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:57,678
and the immigration policies,

915
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:00,547
because I didn't come here
to talk about politics.

916
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,073
I came here to drink.

917
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:03,915
- What did you...
- I came here to drank.

918
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,318
- Drank.

919
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,549
- And I'm gon' drank.

920
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:07,920
- Drank.

921
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,221
- I'm here to drank,
and I'm gon' drank.

922
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,249
- I came here to drink.

923
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,353
- I came here to drink
plum brandy

924
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:17,856
from Serbo-Croatian territories.

925
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,028
- I thought you weren't
gonna talk politics.

926
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:21,593
- It's inevitable.

927
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:25,335
It's...
it's ineluctable.

928
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,672
- Now you're just
making up words.

929
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:29,075
- It's incontrovertible.

930
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,707
[laughing]

00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:38,721

933
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,665
- You guys
are fucking boring me.

934
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:56,468
- I thought
that was just the music.

935
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,474
- Yeah,
maybe that's what it was.

936
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,240
- Uh, don't eat those.
Those are terrible.

937
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:08,273
- Those are ends.
Those are ends and pieces.

938
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,285
- Dog food.

939
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,877
- Tits and vits.

940
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,046
- Give me it.

941
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,953
- What do you guys wanna do?

942
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,891
- I want to rock.

943
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:20,384
- I think we should try
to catch that cougar tonight.

944
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,022
- Yeah, I agree.

945
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,363
[guitar plucking]

946
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,393
- Have you not learned
a new Spanish guitar riff

947
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,735
in the last 2 years?

948
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:31,069
- I'm serious.

949
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,075
I think we should get
that fucking cougar tonight.

950
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:34,076
- Shut up, man.

951
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,101
Did you know...

952
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:38,909
that he has only ever
played that on the guitar?

953
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,007
That's the only thing
he can play.

954
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,178
That's one more thing
than I can play, in fairness.

955
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,482
But goddamn.

956
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,252
- And it makes me
really popular at bullfights.

957
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,359
- I think I'm gonna take
two more shots of that

958
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:58,390
and go find that cougar.

959
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,958
- We're not hunting
a cougar tonight.

960
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:04,804
- I'm gonna do it.

00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,173
[snacks crumbling]

00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,734

- [laughing]

964
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,873
- Hammer-on.
You like the hammer-on.

965
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,852
- What is this?

966
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,218
I spent about an hour trying to
figure this out earlier today.

967
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:20,244
- It's a puzzle.

968
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,986
- I know it's a puzzle.

969
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,618
- Dude...

970
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,994
- I'm not trying to be...

971
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,089
a dick.

972
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,724
I'm not trying to,
like, bring...

973
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:31,995
- What is wrong?

974
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:35,801
- I'm not, but I mean,
even you can recognize

975
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,567
the irony
of you being a journalist.

976
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,040
- There's nothing ironic
about that.

977
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,373
- It's literally
the definition of irony.

978
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,776
- Right.

979
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:44,803
- You're a journalist,
and you flunked journalism.

980
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,405
- I didn't flunk.
- That's all I'm saying.

981
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,677
It's great.
It's a triumph.

982
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,582
- I didn't flunk.
I took a W-.

983
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,280
- Right, you got
a zero in it.

984
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:52,948
That's not flunking,
I guess.

985
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:55,822
- I withdrew
with seven weeks.

986
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:58,691
I withdrew a W-
in the semester.

987
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,719
It was perfectly legal.

988
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,787
And I got an incomplete.

989
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,230
- And what happens
to an incomplete?

990
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,291
What happens to an incomplete
if you don't make it up?

991
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:07,565
It turns into a 0.0.

992
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,970
I only say that 'cause it
happened to me like 20 times

993
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:11,997
before I dropped out of college.

994
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,702
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

995
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,233
- I'm not ashamed of it.
I didn't flunk.

996
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,041
- Then why are you
so fucking uptight about it?

997
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,241
You're a journalist,
and you deserve congratulations.

998
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,909
- You're totally
attacking me about this.

999
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,975
It's completely false,
and you're being hypocrit...

1000
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,543
You're the fucking one
who's like...

1001
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,452
You're the fucking hypocrite.

1002
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:27,581
You're the hypocrite.

1003
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,114
You're the one
who fucking came in here

1004
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:30,819
all about Charles Bukowski.

1005
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,259
I love Bukowski.

1006
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,819
How many hours
did I have to listen to you

1007
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:35,728
talk about how much
you fucking hated Bukowski?

1008
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:38,063
"I hate Bukowski.
Oh, Bukowski.

1009
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:41,264
"Anybody who reads Bukowski
is a fucking subliterate

1011

who doesn't deserve to breathe
the air we all breathe."

1012
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:49,241
How... like, you just went off
about Bukowski

1013
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:50,472
and how much you hate him.

1014
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:52,276
- Fuck you both!

1015
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,282
- You shut up!

1016
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,908
- Let's go hunt this cougar.

1017
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,251
I'm serious.

1018
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,348
- What, you want to go
hunt the cougar right now?

1019
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,450
- Yeah, let's fucking go.

1020
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,619
- All right.
- Let's go.

1021
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,322
- Fucking let's go.
- All right.

1022
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,668
- I'm bringing this.

1023
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:15,534
- Do it.

1024
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:16,595
- Get a flashlight.

1025
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,573
- Fuck you.

1026
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:43,656
[heavy breathing]

1027
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,670
- It's fucking cold.

1028
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,682
It's fucking dark.

1029
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,707
- Shh!

1030
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,878
- So how much do you know
about cougars, for real?

1031
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,720
- They're more scared of us
than we are of them.

1032
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:10,385
- That's what they say
about every animal,

1033
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:11,916
and yet animals
kill people every day.

1034
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,953
- Yeah, bec...
shut up.

1035
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:16,430
- I mean, can...
they can...

1036
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:20,732
So let's say there's a cougar
right over there.

1037
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,738
You have to pretend
you know what I'm talking about

1038
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:26,139
because I'm pointing,
and it's pitch black.

1039
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:29,770
It can see us, right,
'cause it has night vision?

1040
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:31,837
I'd say that puts us
at a disadvantage.

1041
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:35,078
- God, this is ridiculous.

1042
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:38,451
- What is it...
how does a cougar...

1043
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:39,955
how does a cougar kill?

1044
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:44,483
Does it, like... does it swipe you
with its massive paw, or...

1045
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,119
- Shut up.

1046
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,823
- Does it eat you alive

1047
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:50,025
and show you
your own beating heart

1048
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,193
while you're still dying?

1049
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,226
I'm only asking
because I want to know.

1050
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:20,756
- You know,
cougars out here?

1051
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,492
- Yeah.

1052
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:26,434
- Those are
the least of your worries.

1053
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,767
You got to watch out
for black bears.

1054
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,432
Those things are mean too.

1055
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,100
They don't
kill you right away.

1056
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:36,202
They'll tear off a limb and just
wait for you to bleed out

1057
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,008
and just watch you
and play with you.

1058
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:39,344
And you can only hope

1059
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:41,179
that the cougars get to you
first out here, man.

1060
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:42,980
Black bears are the worst.
They'll fuck you up.

1061
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,782
- You're fucking with me.
None of that's true.

1062
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,550
You said before,
black bears are no big deal.

1063
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:48,614
- Yeah, they're no big deal
if you're not around them.

1064
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,286
They're no big deal if they're
behind, like, glass...

1065
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,998
Or dead.

1066
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:03,028
- Well, yeah,
not that much of a big deal

1067
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,768
if it's behind glass or dead.

1068
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,036
- Except werewolves.

1069
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,442
And zombies are bad.

1070
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:12,675
- And Frankensteins.

1071
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:16,549
- Even those are undead, but...

1072
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:19,384
- Have you ever seen
an undead black bear?

1073
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:21,219
- Not yet.

1074
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:23,521
- What about...

1075
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,993
What about Edgar Winter's
<i>Frankenstein?</i>

1076
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,495
- If we run in to Edgar Winter,

1077
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,055
you have my permission
to kill him and eat him.

1078
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,158
- I'm gonna play with him first.

1079
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:33,463
- I'd advise against it.

1080
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:35,163
- I'm not ripping off
his fret hand, though.

1081
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,569
That would be...
- That's just mean.

1082
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,164
- That would be
a crime against humanity.

1083
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,072
- That's just mean.

1084
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:46,213
- Is it Edgar Winter,
or who's the other Winter?

1085
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:47,216
- Shelley?

1086
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,581
- Shelley...
[laughs]

1087
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:49,607
- Shh!

1088
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:01,826
- Okay, so the trail
sort of ends here.

1089
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:04,526
We've kind of
got to blaze our own.

1090
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,467
What we're gonna do
is hop over this log

1091
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:09,562
and take a left
and jump over these trees.

1092
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,733
There's a little barbed wire,
so watch out.

1093
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:18,805
- [laughing]

1094
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,179
Okay, I know...

1095
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:22,241
- I'm glad you guys
think this is fucking funny,

1096
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:23,650
but this cougar is smart,

1097
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,278
and I think
he's following us.

1098
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,152
So if you want
to live through this,

1099
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:28,952
you'll do what I say.

1100
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,318
Get down.

1101
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:09,923
Get down.

1102
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:14,129
I think
we're almost there.

1103
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,570
I've seen him
up on this ridge before.

1104
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:17,663
- Uh...

1105
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,766
- We're gonna flank him
to the left.

1106
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,505
Be really quiet.

1107
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,638
Follow me.

1108
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,288
- Did he just say "flank him"?

1109
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:37,986
- Yeah, I just realized
that the cougar was the mascot

1110
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:39,494
of my junior high school.

1111
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:42,053
I'm not sure
how I feel about this anymore.

1112
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,563
We should follow him.
- Yeah.

1113
01:06:58,314 --> 01:06:59,645
- Have any more of that brandy?

1114
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:00,671
Did you bring the brandy?

1115
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:03,514
- Uh, I dropped it...

1116
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:06,419
back a ways when
we were crossing that ravine.

1117
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:19,833
- Fuck.
This is the wrong place.

1118
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:20,858
- What?
- What?

1119
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:21,961
- Wrong ridge.

1120
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:23,904
We got to...

1121
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:25,531
We got to turn...
- The ridge.

1122
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:28,236
- I can smell...

1123
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:31,212
- Fuck.

1124
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,715
- Dude...

1125
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:35,512
- Yeah.

1126
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,519
- We'll never get to Mordor
at this rate.

1127
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,418
- [laughs]

1128
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:58,771
- It's like the word
"douchebag," you know?

1129
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:01,402
Like, everybody says it again,
and that's great,

1130
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,708
but we live in a relatively
douche-free world.

1131
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:04,940
- Yeah, nobody douches.

1132
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:07,710
- Shut your fucking mouths
and keep up with me.

1133
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,342
- Okay.
- All right.

1134
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:24,324
- Well, if you're French,
douching makes a lot of sense.

1135
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,391
- Yeah, that's true.
That's just good policy.

1136
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,561
- I said, "Shut the fuck up!"

1137
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,264
- Okay, okay, okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1138
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:30,670
- Put the gun down.
Jesus Christ.

1139
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,833
- You two fuckers stay here
and don't follow me.

1140
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,810
I could give a shit
what happens to you.

1141
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,290
- He just pointed a gun...
- Yeah.

1142
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,157
- At you.
- At you.

1143
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:53,218
- You were laughing.

1144
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:54,320
- He pointed...

1145
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:55,523
- Jim, be careful.

1146
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,259
I think there might be
a cougar out there.

1147
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:01,730
That's weird.
That's unusual.

1148
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,897
That's the first time that's
happened to me in a while...

1149
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:06,567
with a gun being pointed at me
by some weird dude.

1150
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,236
- Uh, where did he go?

1151
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,016
- Um...

1152
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,780
- That was really...
I was a little scared.

1153
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,344
- Yeah, well, it's weird,

1154
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:21,322
like when a gun
gets pointed at you

1155
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:26,192
and the person holding it
looks like they might actually

1156
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:28,594
want to kill you...

1157
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:30,223
Is he always like that?

1158
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:32,200
- He's intense, you know?

1159
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,725
- He's a little intense.

1160
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:42,168
Well, at least it's freezing.

1161
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,701
- Yeah.

1162
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:46,214
- Um, do you know
where we are?

1163
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:48,546
- No, I have no idea.

1164
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:52,111
- Well, that's good.

1165
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:55,749
Hey, um, you know
what this reminds me of?

1166
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:58,055
This reminds me of that time
we stayed up all night drinking

1167
01:09:58,093 --> 01:09:59,924
and then went out in the forest
to hunt a cougar.

1168
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:03,796
- [laughing]

1169
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:06,357
I remember that.

1170
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:42,864
I think I've just been dumped.

1171
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,066
- You mean
by a heterosexual male friend?

1172
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,165
- I know.
It's weird.

1173
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,835
Has that ever happened to you?

1174
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,276
- I think I would remember.

1175
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:54,009
[chuckling]

1176
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,631

# #

1178
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:35,215
- Yeah, I've always wondered
about, you know, like,

1179
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:38,090
noise-canceling headphones,
that technology.

1180
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,119
I don't understand
why they can't just use it

1181
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:44,690
for a house or a car
or something.

1182
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,291
You should do that here.

1183
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:47,802
- Or a person.

1184
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:50,202
- [laughs]

1185
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,206
Yeah.

1186
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,400
- I would love that.

1187
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,068
- I'm sorry, dude.
Are you trying to sleep?

1188
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:57,237
- Noise-canceling technology
for people.

1189
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,807
[mimics white noise]

1190
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,681
That would be so great.

1191
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,620
- That would be great.

1192
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,623
- Hey, Eric.
[mimics white noise]

1193
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:13,617
- [laughing]

1194
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:16,187
Okay.

1195
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:24,468
Oh, um, geography question:

1196
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:27,964
do you know
the capital of Thailand?

1197
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,070
- Don't.

1198
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:37,313
- That was not...
I totally wouldn't.

1199
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,320
- I'm serious.

1200
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,049
- I'm serious too.

1201
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:44,150
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.

1202
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:47,424
[laughing]

1203
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:29,427
Doing the crossy, eh?

1204
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:38,338
I got to say, man,

1205
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:42,111
this is a pretty
amazing life you have here.

1206
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:44,244
It's really...

1207
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:45,651
it's really unexpected,

1208
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,712
but it's really, like...
it's impressive.

1209
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,951
It's really beautiful.

1210
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,289
I mean, even the air.

1211
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:53,226
- You're so full of shit.

1212
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:05,122
- Why is this shit
always so fucking hard?

1213
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,530
All right.

1214
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:46,532
[chortles]

1215
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:49,305
Um...

1216
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:52,871
so we should, you know,
do this again sometime.

1217
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,940
- Yeah, yeah.

1218
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:57,577
Hey, next time,
let me know,

1219
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:59,587
and I'll get
a parking pass for you.

1220
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:01,782
- Okay, that would be great.

1221
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,188
Excellent.

1222
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,819
All right, well, that's
something to look forward to.

1223
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:07,556
- Safe drive.
- All right, see you.
