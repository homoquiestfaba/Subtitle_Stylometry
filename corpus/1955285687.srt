1
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:36,068
Where's the damn negotiator?

2
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,870
-They said 10 minutes.
-10 minutes?

3
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,906
They're all gonna be
dead in 10 minutes.

4
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:42,875
Sir, I think we got company.

5
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,119
What the hell
is he doing here?

6
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:57,056
I don't know. Son of a bitch
thinks he's a hero now.

7
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:11,770
Well, he's gonna
get us all ki...

8
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,942
Look out, Jack!

9
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,244
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

10
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,448
Get down!

11
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,918
No, Jack! No!

12
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:43,502
No!

13
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,104
Jack!

14
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,605
Jack!

15
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,173
Don't leave me, Jack!

16
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,709
Don't leave me! Jack!

17
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:51,710
No!

18
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,545
No!

19
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:59,051
No!

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,987
No!

21
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,623
Cut! Cut! No!

22
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,358
That's a cut!
Cut! Cut! Cut!

23
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,526
Are those the lines?

24
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,862
Is that the script?
Give...

25
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,530
Colton!

26
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,631
Hey, man, are you okay?

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,233
I think I hurt my back.

28
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,135
You were so good, man.

29
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,170
I know why I quit acting now.

30
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,072
Yeah. Everything looked
just fine to me.

31
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,740
You looked fine to me.

32
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,809
Let me rub that back for you.

33
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:25,177
-Good job, Marty.
-Come on.

34
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:27,179
Come on. Come on. Let
me rub that for you.

35
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:28,180
What happened to the scene?

36
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,314
What happened to the comedy?

37
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,083
Well, I changed
a few things, kid.

38
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,584
You changed some things?

39
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,419
You can't do that. Were
you gonna tell anyone?

40
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,522
Well, you know, I...
Wasn't working for me.

41
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,657
It might be
a little too funny.

42
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:40,225
Yeah, it was too funny.
Yeah.

43
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,894
Too funny? It's
supposed to be funny.

44
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,496
It's a comedy.
It's called "Clown Cops."

45
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:45,564
Yeah, well, my friend...

46
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,432
You came out of
a pizza cop car.

47
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,401
My friend just got shot, Joshie.

48
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,170
It's a flesh wound.
He lives.

49
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,771
Yeah. I mean,
you seen the scene.

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,773
Have you read the scene?
Have you read the script?

51
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,208
Yeah, I have,
but my character hasn't.

52
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:57,843
You know, in my opinion,

53
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,012
it should be
more serious, I think.

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,181
You think? No, you're
not paid to think.

55
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,416
You're paid to act,
I'm paid to direct,

56
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,118
and it's
not going well.

57
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,719
I'm gonna have
to tell the studio.

58
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,855
I don't want to have
to tell the studio.

59
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,623
No.
Joshie, no, no, no.

60
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,026
You know what it is?
I'm... I'm crashing.

61
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,227
That's the problem.
I'm crashing.

62
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:16,562
-Are you okay?
-Low blood sugar!

63
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,696
Chair!

64
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:20,532
Chair! Chair! Chair!

65
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,568
I'm telling you, I'm no good...
Where's Kyle?

66
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,636
Maybe I need a salad
or something. Kyle!

67
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,038
-Kyle!
-Yes, Mr. West.

68
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,639
Kyle! Lips! Lips!
Quickly! Quickly!

69
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,544
Well, okay.
Kyle, where's that salad,

70
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,213
the kale salad from Lou's?

71
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,647
There was a problem,
Mr. West.

72
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,915
A problem?

73
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,550
Your credit card
maybe was declined.

74
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,919
-Who knows? I don't...
-What?

75
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,588
This is very lovely.

76
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,090
Just go get some food.

77
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,125
Get your blood sugar into
just a nice comfy place...

78
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,460
-I need something.
-Thank you.

79
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,162
-And then you come back here...
-Thank you.

80
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,130
And then read the freaking
scene as scripted!

81
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,165
I promise. I pro...

82
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,166
This is nice.

83
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,801
This is
a nice sport coat.

84
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:56,835
Barney's?
Where's this from?

85
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,103
It's from my grandfather.

86
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,338
It's beautiful,
really beautiful,

87
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,006
-lovely.
-I'm sorry I snapped.

88
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,441
It's okay.
It happens.

89
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,276
-Just read the scene.
-It's moviemaking. Okay.

90
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,644
All right, people,
we're resetting!

91
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:06,912
Back to one!

92
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,847
I'll be better!
I'll be better.

93
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,749
I swear I'll be better.
What happened?

94
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:13,185
What happened with the credit
card? How'd it get declined?

95
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:16,455
Well, there were several
suspicious charges...

96
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,990
What?
In Fort Lauderdale.

97
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,525
Fort Lauderdale? Who's
in Fort Lauderdale? I...

98
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,695
Gee. Look, just call
the credit card company.

99
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,696
Approve the charges.

100
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,765
Get my kale salad,
and do s...

101
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,434
You're so muscular.

102
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:30,702
-Yeah.
-Looks nice.

103
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,703
You're working out.

104
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,038
-Sort of.
-Good. Okay.

105
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,172
Yeah.

106
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,141
I'm not.

107
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,296
<i>Fort Lauderdale?</i>

108
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,830
Fort Lauderdale?

109
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,198
Who said I was
in Fort Lauderdale?

110
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,900
Your best friends,
Amex and Visa.

111
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,535
Hey, will you pass me
that mango colada?

112
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,003
Hey!

113
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,205
<i>That's not code name
for a science book?</i>

114
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,206
Mango colada?

115
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,641
No, it's a beverage.

116
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,678
Well, that's alcohol,
and it's Friday.

117
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,913
I'm 21, and I'm parched.

118
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,248
Besides, we didn't
have class today,

119
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,649
so we have
a three-day weekend.

120
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,184
Some of us
went to the beach,

121
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,485
so stop freakin' out.

122
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,421
I'm not freakin' out,
okay? Look,

123
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,057
I'm supposed to be looking after
you while your mother's gone.

124
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,492
<i>How am I supposed to do
that when I can't find you?</i>

125
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,861
I'm not 10. I don't have
to tell you everything.

126
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,163
<i>Well, you know what?</i>

127
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,899
You do, as long
as I'm paying for it.

128
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,267
<i>I'm fine,</i>

129
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,502
and I don't need
my stepdad babysitting me.

130
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,671
You're not checking up
on Mom every day

131
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,441
while she's halfway across the world
on some yoga retreat, are you?

132
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,675
<i>Hey, you know what, Raya?</i>

133
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,010
You're not your mother, okay?

134
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,179
And she had a very
tough year last year.

135
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,180
You know that.

136
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,581
My mom's gonna be fine.

137
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,951
And, no, you're right.
I wasn't there.

138
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,255
I was stuck in a library for 72
hours studying for finals week,

139
00:05:57,324 --> 00:06:01,126
being responsible, which is why
you can trust me now, Colt.

140
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,427
I do trust you, Raya,

141
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,429
and I know you could
take care of yourself.

142
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,465
I know
you're responsible.

143
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,633
And, Raya...

144
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,969
you can call me Dad.

145
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,406
My God.

146
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:15,407
My God.

147
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:19,878
My God.

148
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,079
Raya?

149
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,821
What just happened?

150
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,323
Nothing good.

151
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,836
They're here.

152
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,614
Lavalantula!

153
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,116
Run!

154
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:19,371
Watch out!

155
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,714
God! Raya!

156
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,849
Casey!

157
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,951
-Casey!
-Raya!

158
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
Help me!

159
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,021
No!

160
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,725
Casey!
Casey!

161
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,964
We have to go!

162
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,844
<i>Hey, this is Raya.
Leave me a message.</i>

163
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,078
<i>Bye.</i>

164
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,714
Raya, call me back.
It's your dad.

165
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,382
This is Lisa Johnson,

166
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,152
and I am here in the downtown
district of Fort Lauderdale

167
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:10,021
after massive sinkholes
all over the city

168
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,257
have birthed another wave
of lavalantulas.

169
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,559
And almost a year ago
to the day

170
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,828
where they first
wreaked havoc on Los Angeles.

171
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,531
The big question on
everyone's mind right now

172
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,433
is when will the military
take action?

173
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:26,605
Or does Florida
need Colton West?

174
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,841
This is Lisa Johnson signing off
from downtown Fort Lauderdale.

175
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,510
I'm not
doing this again.

176
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,852
Hey, did you feel that?

177
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,420
No.

178
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,923
Hey, man, this is
not California.

179
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,292
Things do not shake
like this in Florida.

180
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,628
Not outside of South
Beach, anyway.

181
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,629
Are you all right?

182
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,297
Army helicopters, shaking!

183
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,232
I'm having a bad déjà vu.

184
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,034
No, you're not.

185
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,736
Were you on the phone
with somebody?

186
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,304
Yeah, my daughter, Raya.

187
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,540
-Where's she at?
-Fort Lauderdale.

188
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:05,977
Man, I heard that's where the
epicenter of all this mess is.

189
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,381
Come on, Colton.
What would Red Rocket do, man?

190
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,127
Where are those guns
you were working on?

191
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,565
You okay?

192
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:32,304
This is a modified XM25 Counter
Defilade Target Engagement System,

193
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:35,974
specially designed to shoot
armor-piercing 50-millimeter rounds

194
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,643
and my favorite,
liquid-nitrogen bombés.

195
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,846
The Army likes
to call this...

196
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:45,984
the Punisher.

197
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,286
And Swiss Army knife
in the clip.

198
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,621
But with
our modifications,

199
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,257
I call her
a cold day in Hell.

200
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,526
Have you tested it?

201
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,528
Nope, but she's
pretty as hell.

202
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,164
Mr. West, they're calling
everyone back to set.

203
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,099
Go ahead.

204
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,034
We're not going
back to set, Kyle.

205
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,970
Excuse me? When you
signed up for this,

206
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,438
you knew what it
was gonna entail,

207
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,006
didn't you?
Yes, Mr. West.

208
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,175
And you said it was okay
with you, didn't you?

209
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,510
Yes, Mr. West.
So I gotta know, punk,

210
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,347
are you in,
or are you out?

211
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,549
If it means I can stop
getting your salads

212
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,518
and start shooting spiders, Mr.
West, then I am all in.

213
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,854
Wait.
Who's shooting spiders?

214
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,156
No, the only thing we're
doing is shooting a scene,

215
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,158
a very large,
expensive scene

216
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,394
that's going tens of thousands of
dollars over budget every minute.

217
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,996
Calm down, Joshie.

218
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,631
Here's the deal.

219
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,199
I'm gonna go
take a whiz,

220
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:37,035
and then you and I,
Mr. Director,

221
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,304
we're gonna make
movie magic.

222
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:42,574
Okay. Sounds good.

223
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,511
I have a good
feeling about this.

224
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,079
Let's do it!

225
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,148
Get my bag.

226
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,349
Okay.

227
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:54,653
I can't.
I can't. I can't.

228
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,522
No, no, no. Not again.
Not again.

229
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,057
Not again.
Well...

230
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,926
you have to.

231
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,328
Just one more time.

232
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:06,164
You all better be be safe.

233
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,733
Safe is our middle name.

234
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:13,171
Okay, everyone,
we're back in two minutes.

235
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,907
Get the helicopter
back up in the air.

236
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,742
We can't do that.

237
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,577
Why the hell not?

238
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,279
Colton just,
hijacked it.

239
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,415
No!

240
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,584
Colton!

241
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,530
You know I'm gonna get
fired for this, Mr. West.

242
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,465
You know you're gonna
get a Purple Heart

243
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,100
for this, Lester.
Anything?

244
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,703
No. The circuits
are probably overloaded.

245
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,204
Keep dialing, Kyle.

246
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:47,706
Hey, Colt, Colt, Colt!

247
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,607
We got trouble down there!
Take a look!

248
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,078
<i>You're crazy.</i>

249
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,914
<i>This is as far
as I go, Mr. West.</i>

250
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,787
My God.

251
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,123
My God, this is not happening!

252
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,124
Damn it.

253
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,559
-Casey...
-I know. I know.

254
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,561
We have to keep it together.

255
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,330
No! We have to get
out of here, all of us.

256
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,631
The others.
We have to go.

257
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,266
They're at the bar!

258
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,302
Okay, you know, I don't feel
so good after that flight.

259
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,436
Just what are we gonna do?

260
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,738
We gotta help
every man, woman,

261
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:20,805
and child in that order.

262
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,107
Gotta get everybody
outta here,

263
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,241
and we haven't even
tested these yet.

264
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,244
-Shoot it!
-Gun's not working!

265
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:27,812
-It should work!
-No, it isn't.

266
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,481
If it was working,
I would have done it!

267
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,949
Shoot it!

268
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,952
Yeah. Yeah!

269
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,420
You okay, Mr. West?

270
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,255
Hell to the yeah, baby!

271
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,256
Yeah!

272
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,324
Gun works.

273
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,126
Go easy on the explosives, man.

274
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,427
Just use the 50 millimeter
rounds.

275
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,595
There's only 100 per round.

276
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,597
Don't tell me what to do.

277
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:46,765
-Kyle.
-Yeah?

278
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,966
You got a stepfather,
don't you?

279
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,801
Depends on who you ask,
but yeah.

280
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,202
Do you call him Dad?

281
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,470
Yeah. Sometimes.

282
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,872
If I was
your stepfather,

283
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,607
would you call me Dad?
Yeah.

284
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:56,674
-You would?
-Yeah.

285
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:57,675
-Really?
-Yeah.

286
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,110
Now go get us
a vehicle!

287
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,545
Okay, Dad.

288
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,715
Ho!

289
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,484
We're going in!

290
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,888
-We have to hurry.
-I know.

291
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,724
-My God.
-The music's still on.

292
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,058
Where's Jen and Claudia?

293
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,059
I don't know.

294
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,628
Maybe they left before us.

295
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,196
Without telling us?
I'm really worried.

296
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,632
Me, too. We have to get
everyone out of here.

297
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,633
-Hey, guys!
-Hey, guys!

298
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,168
Hey!
Guys!

299
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,170
Listen to us!
Stop the music!

300
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,838
Lavalantulas are coming!

301
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:27,839
What?

302
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:28,873
Lavalantulas!

303
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,041
Never heard of 'em!

304
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,076
-They're coming!
-Cool,

305
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,379
but I don't have
that record yet!

306
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,713
I can't play what I don't have!

307
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,382
-No! No!
-Listen to me!

308
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,417
You have to clear
everyone out of here!

309
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:41,920
What?

310
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,488
The city's on fire!

311
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,356
Hear that?!

312
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,524
Yes.

313
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:49,694
This city is on fire!

314
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,262
-No! No!
-No!

315
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,364
No! That's not what I meant!

316
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,000
Cut the music!

317
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,368
Cut the music!

318
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,206
God.

319
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,413
Come on! Raya!

320
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,248
Everybody has to leave!

321
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,383
Daniella!

322
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,953
Please!
Get it off!

323
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,256
Come on!

324
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,575
Help me!

325
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:43,948
We gotta split up.

326
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,083
Not a good idea.

327
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,217
I said split up.

328
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:47,418
Not a good idea.

329
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:48,419
Just do it!

330
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,588
Yeah, I said it before.

331
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,669
You lookin' for something, pig?

332
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:05,670
Pig?

333
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,139
No. A pig? A cop?

334
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,808
No, no, no.
I'm not a cop.

335
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,977
Help! Help me!
Help me, please!

336
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,612
Okay, pig cop,

337
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,180
you can die, too.

338
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,149
<i>Makes no matter
to me, pendejo.</i>

339
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,617
<i>"Pendejo"?</i>

340
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,619
No, no, no, no,
you gotta listen to me.

341
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,254
There's spiders
all over the city

342
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,123
w-with flames coming
out of their mouth.

343
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,992
Flames coming out of
their mouths! I mean,

344
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:30,962
look, if we don't
all get out of here,

345
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,964
we're gonna be corpses,
believe me.

346
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,701
Or not.

347
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,471
Come with me!

348
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,614
Hey! Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey,

349
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,982
Who dat?
Who dat? Who dat?

350
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,550
Say hello to my little friend!

351
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,685
<i>¿cómo se llamo?</i>

352
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,386
I'm Dave.
Nice to meet you.

353
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,621
<i>Mi hermana tiene cataro.</i>

354
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,789
What?

355
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:58,790
I'm American!

356
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,124
I didn't know.

357
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,193
Run, Dave!

358
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,227
I owe you my life!

359
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,729
Let's go!

360
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,837
Dave!

361
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,072
Wait up, man.

362
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,640
Have some of this!

363
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,376
Have some of this, some of
this, and some of that!

364
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,045
Have some of this and
some of this and some of that!

365
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,347
They dead?

366
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,048
I don't know.

367
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,550
Damn!

368
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,822
Get it off!

369
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,056
-Can't get it off!
-Come on! Come on!

370
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,091
Let's go!

371
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,528
Man, it's a tad breezy out here.

372
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:41,099
Yeah, we gotta Kyle Reese
this situation ASAP.

373
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,443
-Where the hell is he?
-I don't know.

374
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:56,136
It's so hot out here, I could
fry an egg on my face.

375
00:16:56,137 --> 00:16:57,849
-Nice ride, Kyle.
-Get out.

376
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,050
He's driving, Switek.
Let's go.

377
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,418
-Come on.
-Your stuff's in the back!

378
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:01,786
Thank you, Detective Gina.

379
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,355
Yeah. You're in the back.
Let me have it.

380
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:06,724
Let's go.

381
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,765
Wait.
Where are we going?

382
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,766
I can't run anymore!

383
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,200
We have to get out of here!

384
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:18,770
Daniella?

385
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:19,937
I'm fine.

386
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,939
I just got burned
back at the club.

387
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,207
Wait.

388
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:26,711
What?

389
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,745
It's nothing.

390
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,280
It's just
slightly burned.

391
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,082
We have to get you
some medication.

392
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,083
Screw the medication!

393
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,751
What are we gonna do?

394
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,489
I have an idea.

395
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,091
Where are you going?

396
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,996
How we doing back there, Kyle?

397
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,498
Well, there's nothing yet,

398
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,834
but I did find her
on that "Find My Phone" app,

399
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,335
and she's still
in Fort Lauderdale.

400
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,238
Hey, hey, hey! Castillo finds
out, we're both busted again.

401
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,240
All right.
First, we save Raya.

402
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,742
Then we save Florida.

403
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,777
Yeah? You save Raya.

404
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,079
You save Florida.

405
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,113
You save California.

406
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,347
Who's gonna save us?

407
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,417
We did it in LA.
We'll do it here.

408
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,320
We get this wrong,
we're gonna get a burn notice.

409
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,861
What is this place?

410
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,263
Hello!

411
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,467
What is this?
This is sick,

412
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,635
exactly what we need.
Hey, hey, hey!

413
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,338
Don't touch that, man! What you
doing? That's nothing to play with!

414
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:30,341
Okay, that's loaded with super-cold,
compressed liquid nitrogen.

415
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,277
I use it for house parties. Nah, I use
it to freeze the crap out of spiders,

416
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,613
so please just put it down before
you hurt somebody. Put it down.

417
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,282
My gosh!
Hey!

418
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:39,784
-I just said put it down!
-Hey!

419
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,978
This is a workplace, TJ!
Safety first!

420
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:43,383
I know. I just told 'em...
You good, bro?

421
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:44,622
I told 'em to put it down.

422
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,691
Yo, I look like I got
eight legs and spit lava?

423
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,025
Sorry. I'm sorry.

424
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,527
What the hell
they doing here anyway?

425
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,212
I don't know. They just
let themselves in.

426
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,197
-We really need a car.
-Yeah?

427
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,899
Well, that's
a $10,000 deposit

428
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,421
and a three-month
waiting list.

429
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:58,002
-Deposit?
-Yes.

430
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,671
Lavalantulas are
tearing up the entire city.

431
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,540
Yo, she right, TJ.

432
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,475
Probably be a four-month
waiting list.

433
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,644
What?
Did you just hear her?

434
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,646
We all have
to get out of here!

435
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:09,914
We all heard her.

436
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,816
Half my family's
from Los Angeles.

437
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:16,020
They were all killed by the
lavalantulas, rest their souls.

438
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,055
That's why I made this gun.

439
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,824
True. Now bye, Felicias.

440
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:23,094
Yeah, well, my stepfather was
the guy who killed them all, okay?

441
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,999
Wait a minute.
Colton West?

442
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,200
That's your father?

443
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,235
Stepfather, and yes.

444
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,703
-Really?
-Really.

445
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,539
Yo, that man's a legend.

446
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,574
He's the reason I made this gun.
Ain't that right, Brick?

447
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:39,510
Yo, "Swamp Justice,"
crazy movie.

448
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,280
Crazy movie. Crazy...

449
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,447
Hey, yo,
what's wrong with her?

450
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,216
She was burned by the spiders.

451
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,417
She really needs help,

452
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,586
so are you guys
gonna help us or what?

453
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:50,922
Please.

454
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,591
Yo, duck. Brick!

455
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,943
Stop!

456
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,147
Is there a problem, officer?

457
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,549
You can't get through this way.
You have to turn back.

458
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,784
Hey, yo,
what's up, M.P.s?

459
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:20,952
We need to get
to Fort Lauderdale.

460
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,953
That's not possible.

461
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,054
Listen, officer...

462
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,655
Get back inside the car, sir.

463
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,923
We have a serious
lavalantula outbreak.

464
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,959
I know.
That's why we're here.

465
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,961
No one can get through. All the
roads have been closed off.

466
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,463
Look, I don't know if
you fellas watch the news,

467
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,399
but we took care of these
guys in Los Angeles.

468
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,635
My name is Colton West,
authorized movie star.

469
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,737
I know who you are,
Mr. West.

470
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,339
I don't care if you're the
President of the United States.

471
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,241
No one's getting through.

472
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,742
What the heck are those?

473
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,444
Guns!
For killing spiders!

474
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:47,645
All right,
everyone freeze.

475
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,280
Hands up in the air.
Nobody move.

476
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:53,351
Officers! Look!

477
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,487
<i>Get down!</i>

478
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:58,856
<i>Give me the gun!</i>

479
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,825
Give me the gun!
Hurry up!

480
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,927
God!

481
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>Go!</i>

482
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:05,763
<i>Gun! Give me the gun!</i>

483
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,431
Come on, man!
Get us out of here!

484
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:11,702
<i>Man!</i>

485
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,210
<i>-Look out!
-Okay, let's go.</i>

486
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:21,979
<i>Yo, fool, be careful!</i>

487
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,215
<i>My God!
My God! Hurry!</i>

488
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,017
<i>That's what
I'm talking about, boy!</i>

489
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,451
<i>Let's go.</i>

490
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,195
<i>If we keep driving
in the Glades like this,</i>

491
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:41,632
<i>we are going
to get stuck.</i>

492
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,044
Damn!

493
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:54,845
I hate being right.

494
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,084
Phone call!

495
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,020
Phone call!
Phone call!

496
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,555
It's Wyatt.

497
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:06,157
Probably asking for money.

498
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,431
Wyatt? Wyatt?

499
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,000
<i>Dad. Dad, are you
hearing the news?</i>

500
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:19,403
Yeah. Thank God, son.
You're okay. Thank God.

501
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,772
<i>It's happening again in Florida.
I am freaking out right now.</i>

502
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,408
No, no, no. Wait. What do you
mean, son? What do you mean,

503
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,043
you're freaking out? Why
are you freaking out?

504
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,179
<i>"Why?" What do you mean,
why? You're in Florida.</i>

505
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,680
<i>Raya is in Florida.
What...</i>

506
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:30,881
Wait. Where are you?

507
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,717
I'm... I'm on a movie set.

508
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,418
I'm not in the jungle.

509
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,687
I'm not stuck in the Everglades,

510
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:39,123
and... and I'm not
chasing lavalantulas.

511
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,691
<i>Who said anything
about the Everglades?</i>

512
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,893
I didn't say...
Nothing. I'm just...

513
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,695
Nothing, son.
Just...

514
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:46,564
I'm okay.
Raya's okay.

515
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,799
We're all fine. We're
gonna get out of here.

516
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,967
Give my love to your mom.

517
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,869
I love you very much, Wyatt.

518
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:53,738
<i>Okay, Dad.
I love you, too.</i>

519
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,473
And I'll see you soon.

520
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,741
<i>Okay.</i>

521
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,242
<i>Bye.</i>

522
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,046
So you can get
a video chat from Wyatt,

523
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:05,316
but can't get ahold of Raya.

524
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,085
Technology. Go figure.

525
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:10,488
Technology and the
fricking Everglades, man.

526
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,456
I'm... I've had enough
of this place, man.

527
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,558
Where's my can of Raid?

528
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:18,396
I'm hot, and I'm thirsty,
and I'm tired.

529
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,498
Kyle, you just
left the car.

530
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,666
Okay.

531
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,603
Dead end,
multiple directions.

532
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:26,604
Plan D?

533
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:27,905
Why Florida?

534
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,440
You ever wonder why Florida?

535
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:32,843
No! I mean, all the
crazy crap that happens

536
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,179
in this country
happens in this state!

537
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,616
A man ate another man
on the side of the freeway.

538
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:42,787
I mean, a couple had to remove their
time machine from their driveway.

539
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,322
A time machine
from their driveway!

540
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,691
Just last month,
a man was arrested

541
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,661
for having sex
with an alligator.

542
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,797
No offense, Florida!

543
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,099
But I'm surprised it
didn't happen here first!

544
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,168
A man and an alligator? Really?

545
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:58,169
Yeah, yeah.

546
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,603
Looked it up on the Internet,

547
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:00,805
one of those sites.

548
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:01,806
Don't go there.

549
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:15,186
Marty, if that's you, I'm
gonna shoot you in the foot.

550
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:16,454
What do you expect, man?

551
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,222
We're outside of
a floating house.

552
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,857
What kind of a house is this?

553
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,859
I don't know.

554
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,828
I'm sure they got a boat,
and that's what we need.

555
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,830
They don't even
have a yard. God.

556
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,232
All right.

557
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,201
Split up. Hey, man, I
don't want to split up.

558
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,902
Every time we split up,
what happens?

559
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,338
Like in the damn movies, man.
I don't want to split up.

560
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:35,840
Marty, help me out.

561
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,508
Just go around.

562
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,176
Come on, man.
Let's go around.

563
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,178
The dude said split up, man.
Go around.

564
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,514
Go ahead.

565
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,585
Still alive.

566
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:11,942
Quiet.

567
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,177
You see?

568
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:17,882
Over there on my wood crapper.

569
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,084
Over there.

570
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,055
I see you.

571
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,802
Boy, you smell purty.

572
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,137
Where are we going?

573
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,572
Anywhere these spiders ain't.

574
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:44,108
-Where's that?
-Pittsburgh.

575
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,410
We ain't never been
to Pittsburgh before.

576
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,045
What are you even
talking about?

577
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,914
Slow down, TJ!

578
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,248
What is that?

579
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:53,050
The road!

580
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,719
Great! Now what?

581
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:56,987
Stay here.

582
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:02,660
Brick, how we gonna
get around that?

583
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:03,661
I don't know.

584
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:04,662
Yeah, this hole...

585
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,497
Look out!

586
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,499
Look up!

587
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:09,600
Let's do this!

588
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,109
Damn.

589
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,579
No.

590
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:22,580
I'm out.

591
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:23,747
My God.

592
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,449
Me, too, bro. Damn.

593
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,118
Sh...

594
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,787
-Back up!
-Go!

595
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:30,854
-Go!
-Go!

596
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,156
-Hey, get us outta here!
-Go!

597
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,924
Hey!

598
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,426
I got a plan.

599
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:37,695
You colder than a
penguin's toenail.

600
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,600
Yeah.

601
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:44,602
-My God.
-Look at that.

602
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,537
That is amazing.

603
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,606
Yo, but we out
of liquid nitrogen.

604
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,874
How the hell we supposed
to get more of that now?

605
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,943
The school
at the medical lab.

606
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,845
-What school?
-Miami North University

607
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,447
just a few miles
down the road.

608
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,881
We go there.

609
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,383
Yo, what's the mascot?

610
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:02,019
I... I don't know.
I'm a medical student.

611
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:04,655
But they keep a stockpile
of it for experiments.

612
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,290
I do not like this idea.

613
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,891
I like it.

614
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,293
TJ!

615
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:12,062
Yo, I do not
like this idea!

616
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,731
What the heck was that?

617
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,566
My.
It's a little girl.

618
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,701
No, no, no!
They're okay! They're okay!

619
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,370
He's okay.

620
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,805
We're being hunted.

621
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,676
What that was
was the first wave.

622
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:26,744
What do you mean,
"first wave"?

623
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,246
Well, first there were them,

624
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:32,416
snakehead frankenfish.

625
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,853
Then everybody got crazy
about them Burmese pythons.

626
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:36,987
Aha.

627
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,222
And now we got,

628
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,024
-lavalantulas.
-Yeah.

629
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:43,227
Don't they know how delicate
our ecosystem is out here?

630
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:45,996
All right. How do we
get to Fort Lauderdale?

631
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:49,166
Well, I'd say your best bet...

632
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,502
is I-95.

633
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,703
Jeez!

634
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:54,405
National Guard
closed it.

635
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,573
Well, can you get
us across anyway?

636
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:57,841
Can we just take
that boat right there?

637
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,543
That boat's got
a flat tire.

638
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:01,912
Strange things
have been happening.

639
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,213
I ain't been
out there in weeks.

640
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:04,581
Why is that?

641
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,050
Well, about two weeks ago,

642
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,886
the manatees started
beaching themselves.

643
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:10,554
Didn't think
much of it.

644
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:12,690
Then all of a sudden,
these outcroppings

645
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:14,358
started to rise from the Glades.

646
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,760
Look, I appreciate your
passion for this stuff,

647
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,229
but we got a
life-and-death situation.

648
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,299
Mister, you're talking to
Florida's number one gator man.

649
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:25,536
Name's Jim Dundee.

650
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,872
But, hey, strawberry, you
can call me Alligator.

651
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,642
Alligator Dundee?

652
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:32,910
What?

653
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:35,079
Well, it's like,

654
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,414
Alligator Dundee,
it's kind of like...

655
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:38,582
Kind of like what?

656
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:40,951
Well, it's quite similar to...

657
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,320
Like a superhero doing his
thing. Yeah, you know.

658
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,788
It's nothing!
It's nothing!

659
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,924
Look, can you get us across?

660
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,425
You wanna get across?

661
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:49,893
Then you talk to me.

662
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:51,328
But I thought that's
what we were doing.

663
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,830
-Do what?
-Talking to you.

664
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,064
I'm talking to you
to talk to me.

665
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,632
-Yeah, I know.
-I said you talk to me.

666
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:57,434
No, I understand that.
Then who you talking to?

667
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,069
I'm... Nothing.
I apologize.

668
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,004
Do you have a boat
that works?

669
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,140
-Do I have a boat that works?
-Yeah.

670
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:05,075
Sure. Follow me.

671
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,628
It's deserted.

672
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:26,363
There must have
been an evacuation.

673
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,365
If there was an evacuation,

674
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,034
then either spiders are
coming, or they're here.

675
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,304
We need to get in and out
as quickly as possible.

676
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:36,206
Help her.
We need to talk.

677
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,341
Okay.

678
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:39,343
Your friend,
was she burned or bit?

679
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,178
I don't know. Why.

680
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,480
Your father, Colton, he didn't
tell you what happened in LA?

681
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:45,115
I mean, I know what
everyone else knows,

682
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:46,950
but my family doesn't
like to talk about it.

683
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,386
No, I heard some crazy stuff that
happened when people got bit.

684
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,654
Like what?

685
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:52,322
I don't know.
I'm not from LA,

686
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,158
so I don't know. I'm
not even... Like what?

687
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:57,661
I heard
that if you got bit,

688
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,696
you become a host
to baby spiders,

689
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:02,065
like, thousands of 'em.
Like, they just,

690
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,333
you know, burst
out of your body.

691
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:04,334
You know what I'm saying?

692
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,505
That's what I heard,
all right?

693
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,808
She got burned,
okay?

694
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:16,847
So is that
little strawberry

695
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,515
a real close friend
of yours?

696
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,184
Yeah, yeah,
just a distant relative.

697
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,185
I'm right here.

698
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,353
I can hear you.

699
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,922
There you go! Look
at that right there.

700
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,156
There's an outcropping.

701
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,658
Boy, I ain't ever seen anything

702
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:28,859
like that
in my whole life.

703
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,260
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

704
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,595
Didn't I just say that?
Yeah.

705
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:34,198
Hey, Colton, what do
you think that is?

706
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:37,100
Hell of a coincidence.

707
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,269
All right!

708
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,407
Lavalantulas!
Over there! Over there!

709
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:45,375
Come on! Get some of this!
Come on! Come on!

710
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:46,543
On the crapper!
On the crapper!

711
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,612
I want some of this!

712
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:49,913
Hey!
Get down!

713
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,482
Off to the boat!

714
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:53,817
To the boat!

715
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,886
Let's go!

716
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:57,554
Have ever seen them
do this before?!

717
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,623
It's a new breed!
Get in the boat!

718
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:03,627
Just get in the boat! Yah!

719
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,629
-Gator.
-Dundee?

720
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:06,730
Yeah!

721
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,498
Get that knife
behind you!

722
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,667
Hey!
Kill that thing, man!

723
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:13,637
You okay?
I'm okay.

724
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:14,638
I got you.

725
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:15,639
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

726
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,307
I got you.

727
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,742
-No, I feel secure.
-You do.

728
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:20,477
-No, I feel safe.
-There's one!

729
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,647
Come on, man!

730
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:26,116
Get us out of here, man!
Go! Go! Go!

731
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:37,961
I mean, we were stuck
inside a ring of lava!

732
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:42,132
But we sure taught
those guys something.

733
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:44,468
We gave them two cents,
okay?

734
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,770
We took the fight
to those suckers!

735
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:49,039
Wait. Is this where
my highly paid star is?

736
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,707
Taking the fight
to these things?

737
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,342
I ain't saying anything.

738
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,611
Here come the cavalry!

739
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,612
Come on, guys.

740
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,316
Where's Colton West?

741
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:02,352
Good. Are you guys
here to evacuate us?

742
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,955
I am Colonel Nathan R. Jester

743
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:07,190
with the Army
Corps of Engineers,

744
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,360
and I'm looking
for a Colton West.

745
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,362
I was told he was here.

746
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,165
Can you tell me where I
might find Colton West?

747
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,000
Well, I could think
of a few places.

748
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:18,001
Well, name one.

749
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,170
The unemployment office.

750
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:21,371
How 'bout another?

751
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,073
The studio blacklist.

752
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:24,174
Yeah.

753
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:25,809
-All right.
-Where are you going?

754
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:27,811
Let's set up a mobile
command station right here!

755
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,146
No. No.
Move out!

756
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:31,214
No one's going in there!

757
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,750
That is a hot set!
That's a hot set!

758
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:36,320
That's movie talk for
you can't move anything.

759
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,721
It's movie talk.

760
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,156
Studio blacklist?

761
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,158
You think this is funny?

762
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:43,160
Colonel Jester,
I don't think

763
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,929
there's anything funny
about this at all.

764
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:47,698
Colonel Jester...

765
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:50,734
is a little bit funny.

766
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,402
It's a little bit funny,
yeah.

767
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,371
You know, I do not
like your attitude.

768
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,673
You know, no one does.

769
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,241
That's what makes me
a good director.

770
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,010
So are you here
to evacuate us or what?

771
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,212
Well, we'll talk
about that.

772
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:04,181
But right now,
for the fourth time,

773
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,884
I'm gonna ask you, can you tell
me where I can find Colton?

774
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:16,093
This is a matter
of national security.

775
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,260
General...

776
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,295
Colonel.

777
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:19,296
Colonel...

778
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:20,897
he could be on a fan boat

779
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:23,133
in the middle of the
Everglades for all I know.

780
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,417
What's happening?
How's Gator?

781
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:42,786
Not good, man.

782
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,221
Jim's dead, Colton.

783
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,557
I think I can save him!

784
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:48,792
<i>-Come on!
-I stopped the bleeding,</i>

785
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,579
<i>or he ran out of blood,
one of the two.</i>

786
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,475
He's gone, yo.

787
00:33:52,476 --> 00:33:53,797
Do you even know
where you're going?

788
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,298
<i>Kyle, we're in a swamp.</i>

789
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,734
Of course I don't know
where we're going.

790
00:33:57,803 --> 00:34:00,670
Wait.

791
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:01,738
Got it.

792
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,440
Thank...

793
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:04,674
Go that way!

794
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:10,814
No, no, no, no, no.

795
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,416
That way!

796
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:31,238
A'ight, where they at?

797
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,803
Where they at?
Where we at?

798
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:34,938
What's up, man?

799
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:36,640
Hey, yo, Brick.

800
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,542
Don't lose these.

801
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,444
Okay.

802
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,648
Are you okay, girl?

803
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:48,285
I think my burn is
making me feel sick.

804
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,654
Okay. You're gonna
be fine, okay?

805
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:51,955
Man.

806
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:54,124
Hey, guys,

807
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:55,826
it's a cold room.

808
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,828
Come on.
In here.

809
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:01,198
Okay.

810
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,199
Okay.

811
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,200
Okay.

812
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,303
Damn, it's cold in here.

813
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:09,506
It has to be to
keep things fresh.

814
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:14,811
We got 'em.

815
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:18,315
Come on.

816
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,552
Is everybody okay?

817
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,821
Jim's
still dead, man.

818
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,023
I meant you girls!

819
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:28,391
I'm fine.

820
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,727
Where the hell are we, Kyle?

821
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:31,995
Give me a second.

822
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:38,535
By my calculations,

823
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,837
we're about 40 miles west
of Fort Lauderdale.

824
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:43,507
That's not good enough!
We gotta get to Raya!

825
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,175
Well, she's...
Hey, wait.

826
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:46,576
She's at her school.

827
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,879
Wait a minute! Why would
she go to her school?

828
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,580
Because she wants
to be a geologist.

829
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,582
All right, we gotta
get to that school.

830
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,518
What about...
What about Alligator,

831
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:55,919
who died of natural causes?

832
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,787
That's what he
would have wanted.

833
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:59,689
He's a swamp man.

834
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:00,924
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

835
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,292
News flash.

836
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:05,028
We are in the middle
of nowhere!

837
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,531
Hear that?

838
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,267
People?

839
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,868
I smell popcorn.

840
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,907
And I'm gonna eat it.

841
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:19,442
She's been with us for 20 years!

842
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,477
That's right.

843
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:24,214
Green!
We call her Mean Green.

844
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:26,383
She ain't the biggest,

845
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:30,921
but she's the meanest captive
alligator in the Everglades!

846
00:36:37,592 --> 00:36:39,526
It's an alligator show.

847
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:44,334
That's not part of the show.

848
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,437
Keep going! Go!

849
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,506
Move! Move! Move!
Keep going!

850
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,275
Come on!

851
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,185
Come on!
Keep moving, everyone!

852
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:04,955
Move!

853
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,856
Keep moving!
Keep moving!

854
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,992
Keep moving!

855
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,495
Move it! Move it!

856
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,832
Move! Move it!

857
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,200
Yo, let's load the guns up, bro.
Where the guns at?

858
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,335
Don't you have 'em?

859
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,036
Man, do I look like I got 'em?

860
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,438
No.

861
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:22,939
Dude, I told you
to get 'em from the truck.

862
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:23,974
That ain't
what you said.

863
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,342
Man, yeah, I did, man.

864
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,943
You told me to help
what's-his-face here!

865
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,211
-No, I didn't, man!
-Okay, enough!

866
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:30,880
I'll grab the guns.

867
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:34,150
All right, I'll help you if
that's what you trying to do.

868
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:53,937
Back away from the lavalantula.

869
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,757
It's not doing anything.

870
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:14,791
What is happening?

871
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,426
Why isn't it attacking me?

872
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:17,673
It's like it doesn't see you.

873
00:38:17,674 --> 00:38:21,097
It's the cold.
That has to be it.

874
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:24,301
We're so cold that it
doesn't see us a-as living.

875
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:27,270
You mean, because I'm freezing,
it sees me as a chair?

876
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,872
Nah, it probably
sees me as a chair.

877
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,874
It probably sees you
as like a couch or something.

878
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,877
Whatever. So as long as we
are cold, we're safe?

879
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,879
Well, we're gonna die
if we stay in here,

880
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,014
and we're gonna die
if we go out there.

881
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,016
Man, wish we had guns
right now.

882
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,018
But maybe if we keep our body
temperature cold enough,

883
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,720
we can go get the guns.

884
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,622
With the liquid nitrogen tanks.

885
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:48,325
Like they use in cryotherapy.

886
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:50,327
-Cryo-what? What...
-Therapy. It's the use

887
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,896
of really low temperatures
in medical treatments.

888
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,297
That's it.

889
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:57,167
I don't like this idea.

890
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:59,903
I do not like this idea.

891
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,183
You saved my life!

892
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,417
Thank you!

893
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:15,652
My pleasure.
You know who I am,

894
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:16,986
don't you?

895
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:19,189
You recognize me
from movies and television?

896
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,557
What about, Red Rocket?

897
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,658
"Hey, I'm the Red Rocket!"

898
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:24,094
Or... Or, "There's Hell to Pay!"

899
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,862
What about the condom
commercial in the nineties?

900
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:27,364
"This isn't mine.
It's too big!"

901
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,932
No? What about,
"Hey, nice pants."

902
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,367
Nice pants?
"Nice tattoo."

903
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,001
He doesn't know who
you are, Colton! Sorry!

904
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,837
Okay. I'm just trying
to talk to the man.

905
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,840
That chopper,
do you know who owns it?

906
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,174
Zed.
Zed. Where's Zed?

907
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:40,210
Zed's dead, man.
Zed's dead.

908
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:41,211
Well, do you know
how to fly it?

909
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:42,278
Not a lick!

910
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:43,580
Okay! Do you mind if we take it?

911
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:44,581
-If it works!
-If it works?

912
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,049
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

913
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:47,283
What's going through
your mind, Colton West?

914
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,119
A little flick
I did in the nineties

915
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,253
called "Air Bandits."
Big hit.

916
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:52,021
That was 20 years ago.

917
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,391
It was three hours training.
They cut the scene.

918
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,693
That's not a plan A.
What's your plan B?

919
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:57,727
I'll catch you later.

920
00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:58,762
I'll catch you later.

921
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,196
-You know that one?
-Yeah, yeah!

922
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,464
Catch you later!
Catch you later.

923
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:02,732
He remembers!
Catch you...

924
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:04,134
Colton, you can't fly
that chopper!

925
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,403
You got 847-to-3 odds.

926
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:07,971
Never tell me the odds!

927
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,806
And it was
four hours training!

928
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,475
And 25 years ago...

929
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:18,415
Yo, I'm so cold,

930
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:21,251
I could hug
a lavalantula right now.

931
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,952
Okay, that should
be enough.

932
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,988
Yeah, we should
be cold enough.

933
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,623
We just gotta head
to the truck

934
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,491
and grab the guns, okay?
Okay.

935
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,460
But we gotta move slow.

936
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:31,728
Give me the keys.

937
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:33,630
I put 'em on the table.

938
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,432
What the... Why?

939
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,966
I didn't want
to lose 'em.

940
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:41,070
Okay, let's go, but slowly.

941
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,573
Moving faster will raise our
body temps too quickly.

942
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:46,276
And mine rises much faster
than the rest of y'all's.

943
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:54,350
Okay, TJ and I will
go out there.

944
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,252
Brick, stay with Daniella.

945
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:58,455
It's safer in here. And then
once we reload the guns,

946
00:40:58,523 --> 00:40:59,456
we'll come back
for you.

947
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:00,790
Nuh.

948
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,525
Let's go.
Come on.

949
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:04,761
Hey, yo, two words!

950
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,196
Don't die.

951
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,265
-Come on.
-Let's go.

952
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:12,869
Stay over there.

953
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:14,204
You gonna be good.

954
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,508
Expensive.

955
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:19,509
All right.

956
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:20,810
Okay.

957
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,679
Button, button.
Who's got the button?

958
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,815
<i>-Too low.
-No. No.</i>

959
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,317
Yes. Yes.

960
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,022
Aha.

961
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,527
Just like I remember.

962
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:49,405
Well, fellas, I think I'm gonna be
pretty good at this flying thing.

963
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:51,841
Hey! Hey!

964
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,044
You want my opinion on that?

965
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,713
Okay?

966
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,382
Just a little bump
in the road, ladies.

967
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:03,086
Kyle, I'm gonna need you to keep
an eye on Raya's coordinates.

968
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,687
You're gonna be my GPS.

969
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,723
I'm gonna need you
to keep us in the air!

970
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:07,724
You're my pilot!

971
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,593
Piece of cake.

972
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:01,578
Okay.

973
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:03,112
Where they go?

974
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:05,481
Okay. Almost there.

975
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,677
Okay.

976
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,012
Get the door.

977
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,780
I am

978
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:21,724
Go! Go!

979
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:23,693
Run!

980
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:25,662
Go, go, go!

981
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:56,426
Man, I hope they made it.

982
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:58,394
Brick, can you
please look at my burn?

983
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,663
I feel really weird,
like I'm gonna...

984
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:03,232
Like I'm gonna hurl
or something.

985
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:04,367
Yo, I'm a mechanic.

986
00:45:04,436 --> 00:45:06,202
I work on cars,
not spider burns.

987
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:07,437
Brick, please?

988
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:11,340
All right.

989
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,451
-What?
-Nothing.

990
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,919
Nothing. It looks good.

991
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:24,554
I don't know what it
was like before,

992
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:26,089
but you gonna be all right.

993
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:27,590
It doesn't hurt
as bad as before.

994
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:29,092
I think the cold is helping it.

995
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:35,098
Hoo.

996
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,766
Snap!

997
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:39,302
My...

998
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,104
No!

999
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:42,638
Get out of here.

1000
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:45,875
Open the door! No.

1001
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:50,546
Come on.

1002
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:52,982
No!

1003
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:54,751
Come on!

1004
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:55,785
Hey!

1005
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:57,754
-Move!
-What happened?

1006
00:45:57,822 --> 00:45:58,921
-Move!
-Raya, no.

1007
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,156
Where's Daniella?

1008
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:01,591
Raya. Raya.
She ain't gonna make it!

1009
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:02,592
-What? No!
-Take her! Go!

1010
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,760
Raya, no!
Raya, come on!

1011
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:05,161
-We can't leave her!
-No! Come on!

1012
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,133
We're right above her!

1013
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,501
I'm gonna take her down.

1014
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:12,935
She's moving faster!

1015
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:14,137
That could only mean...

1016
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:16,105
-She's in trouble.
-Man.

1017
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:17,974
Are you sure you
can land this thing?

1018
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:19,976
Never underestimate me,
Marty.

1019
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:21,410
You know that.

1020
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:35,091
Brick, my gun's jammed.

1021
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:38,127
Brick, save your ammo, man!

1022
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:42,698
Brick!

1023
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:45,768
There's way
too many of 'em.

1024
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:48,104
They're too lava,
too lantula!

1025
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:49,438
Get outta here.

1026
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:51,440
Brick! No, man! No!

1027
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:52,942
-We have to go, TJ!
-No.

1028
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:55,645
Let's do this!

1029
00:47:02,187 --> 00:47:04,320
Man, I don't want to die today.

1030
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,291
We're not gonna die. We just
have to keep it together.

1031
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:08,291
Brick's gone, okay?
Brick's gone.

1032
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:09,692
Listen to me.

1033
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:10,993
Listen to me.

1034
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:12,695
I lost
my best friend, too.

1035
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:16,999
But we're gonna
get out of here, okay?

1036
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:18,401
I promise.

1037
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:30,179
-Wait.
-Okay.

1038
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:37,720
Okay.

1039
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:51,460
Go, go, go!

1040
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:52,995
Go, go! Go, go, go!

1041
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:54,263
Keep going! Keep going!

1042
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:55,965
Don't wait for me!
Keep going.

1043
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:03,739
Where's the gun?

1044
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:06,309
It's still in the
kitchen right now.

1045
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:11,180
My God.

1046
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:14,417
Damn it.

1047
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:17,653
God.

1048
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:19,188
-Come on!
-I'm coming.

1049
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:20,589
Leave us alone.

1050
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:35,371
No, no, no.

1051
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:41,944
<i>-What are we gonna do?
-They're everywhere.</i>

1052
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,369
Hey!

1053
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:14,243
Colton!

1054
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:19,749
Yes! Yeah!

1055
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:20,750
Hey.

1056
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:24,153
Wait. Wait.

1057
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:25,221
Wait. Wait.

1058
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:26,756
Raya! You got a boyfriend.

1059
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:27,923
-Raya.
-Colton!

1060
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:29,825
Ho ho.

1061
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:31,160
Thank goodness.
You're okay.

1062
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:33,696
Daniella's dead.
Everyone's dead.

1063
00:50:33,765 --> 00:50:35,164
I'm so sorry.

1064
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:37,333
I'm so sorry, honey.
I promise you,

1065
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:38,501
everything's
gonna be okay.

1066
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:40,036
I didn't think
you'd come.

1067
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:42,238
Well, if you would answer
your phone once in a while.

1068
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:43,739
What do you mean,
I wouldn't come?

1069
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:45,775
How could I not
come back for you?

1070
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:48,511
You're my daughter.

1071
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,713
It's gonna be okay.
That ain't true.

1072
00:50:50,782 --> 00:50:51,747
Ain't nothing gonna be okay.

1073
00:50:51,816 --> 00:50:52,882
Who's he?

1074
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,351
That's TJ.
Saved my life.

1075
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,286
Yo, I'm a great fan,
man, a big fan.

1076
00:50:57,355 --> 00:50:59,755
Thanks for coming for us, man.
I got a gun!

1077
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:01,390
I made a gun,
and you inspired it.

1078
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:03,426
It's in there. I'm gonna
go get it for you.

1079
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:04,794
Okay, you can thank us later.

1080
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:06,595
Right now we are not
out of the woods yet.

1081
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:08,631
We've got to find her
and kill her.

1082
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,599
-Find who?
-These are just babies.

1083
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:11,734
The mama's
hiding somewhere.

1084
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:13,636
When this happened
in Los Angeles,

1085
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:16,372
the good Dr. Von Struble gave
us a thermal image of the city.

1086
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:17,606
We were able to find her.

1087
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:19,041
I can do that.

1088
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,910
Thermal, spectral,
infrared.

1089
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:23,379
Last semester, I did my
thesis on global drought

1090
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:24,814
and raising
global temperatures.

1091
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:27,249
We had access to all the
satellite information.

1092
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:28,250
Show us, honey.

1093
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,653
Just follow me.

1094
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,822
You got a cool-ass daughter, Mr.
West.

1095
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,323
Don't even think about it.
I...

1096
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:35,758
I don't want it
crossing your mind.

1097
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:37,293
How you know...
You got me?

1098
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:38,828
Can...

1099
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:40,496
Okay.
All right.

1100
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:42,164
So we gotta get that chopper
operational. Can you do it?

1101
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:44,567
Come on, man. What happens
every time we split up?

1102
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:45,568
Weird stuff happens.

1103
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:46,769
Come on, Marty.

1104
00:51:46,838 --> 00:51:48,304
How 'bout we split up
temporarily?

1105
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,973
I get the chopper,
and I'll meet you out front.

1106
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:53,275
-Great idea.
-All right? Cool.

1107
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:05,321
Go!

1108
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:17,099
Sir. We think we've
located Colton West.

1109
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:19,001
Well, get him on the line.

1110
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,769
What did you do to my set?

1111
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:22,104
You wrecked my set!
Wait.

1112
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:23,439
Did I hear you correctly?

1113
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:24,807
Did you find that S.O.B.?

1114
00:52:24,876 --> 00:52:26,876
Did you find them?
Are they okay?

1115
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:28,944
Will you get these morons
out of my office?

1116
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:29,979
Yes, sir.

1117
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,480
Wait! This is crazy!

1118
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:33,849
You can't take me off
my own movie set, General!

1119
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:36,485
It is Colonel, and this is
now a military operation.

1120
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:39,388
I can do whatever
the hell I want to do.

1121
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:41,957
Now, Private, please get
these people out of my face!

1122
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:45,628
Don't you touch me!

1123
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:47,830
I'm gonna go
under my own accord.

1124
00:52:47,899 --> 00:52:49,031
Humph!

1125
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,133
Don't let me
die on "Clown Cops"!

1126
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:52,868
This can't be my last movie.

1127
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:55,738
We're so overbudget.

1128
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:00,576
Something like this?

1129
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:02,411
Exactly like that.

1130
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,513
Now zoom in on Miami.

1131
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,650
Brilliant.

1132
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:09,852
And you thought I was
only partying, Colt.

1133
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:11,587
When did I say that?

1134
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:14,757
I never said that. I never
said you were only partying.

1135
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:18,060
So that's it? You think
that's the mamalantula?

1136
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:21,830
That is one massive heat
signature under Miami.

1137
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:24,233
Whatever it is, it is huge.

1138
00:53:24,302 --> 00:53:26,268
What, the mamalantula?

1139
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:30,039
No, no, no, no.
That's much, much bigger.

1140
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:32,508
That's no mamalantula.

1141
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:37,346
That's a freaking
gargantulantula.

1142
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:39,548
Mamalantulantula.

1143
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:42,451
What?

1144
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,186
The... The mama tarantula?

1145
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:46,288
No. Gargantulantula.

1146
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:47,556
Gorgantulantula?

1147
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:48,557
What? Is it...

1148
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,359
Gor... The gorgantula? No.

1149
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:52,695
Yes... No, it's a gargantulantula.

1150
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:54,964
-It's a gor...
-Mormalantula?

1151
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:57,700
-With an "O"?
-No, with a G-A-R, gar.

1152
00:53:57,768 --> 00:53:59,101
-Gargan... Gargantu...
-Gargar...

1153
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,102
-Gargantula.
-Gargan...

1154
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:01,237
What's the last part?

1155
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:03,739
-Say it slow. Just say...
-Gargan...

1156
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:05,374
It's very, very bad.
It's very bad.

1157
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:13,616
That's the government.

1158
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,117
How do you know that?

1159
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:19,955
'Cause it's ringing
really weird.

1160
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:22,124
Hello.

1161
00:54:22,193 --> 00:54:23,259
Colton West?

1162
00:54:23,327 --> 00:54:24,593
Speaking.

1163
00:54:24,662 --> 00:54:26,962
<i>Yeah, this is,
Colonel Nathan R. Jester.</i>

1164
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:29,431
You are familiar with the
situation down in Florida?

1165
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,967
Yeah, slightly.

1166
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:35,004
<i>Yeah, well,
you are the only one</i>

1167
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:36,905
<i>that has successfully
dealt with these things...</i>

1168
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:37,973
I'm sorry.

1169
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:42,011
And, I need your help,
and I need your team.

1170
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,012
<i>Great.</i>

1171
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,847
Then come pick us up.

1172
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:47,616
No can do. You're
located in a hot zone.

1173
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:49,285
Yeah, in a hot zone.

1174
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:51,287
Believe me, I been
through this before.

1175
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:54,123
-I know you have.
-I know you have.

1176
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:56,792
Well, I got an idea.
If you listen to me, I...

1177
00:54:56,861 --> 00:54:58,494
No, you listen to me,
General.

1178
00:54:58,562 --> 00:54:59,995
It's Colonel.

1179
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:02,298
Colonel, you listen to me.

1180
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:03,832
<i>You position your satellites</i>

1181
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:06,969
for a thermal image
of Miami stat.

1182
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:09,371
You found her.

1183
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,373
<i>I found something,
'cause this one</i>

1184
00:55:11,442 --> 00:55:14,043
makes the one in LA
look like a flea.

1185
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:17,179
So we find her,

1186
00:55:17,248 --> 00:55:19,181
<i>we root her out,</i>

1187
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,683
and we blow her up.

1188
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:21,817
<i>I'm no expert,</i>

1189
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:24,186
but the heat signature
on this one

1190
00:55:24,255 --> 00:55:26,121
is like something
I've never seen before.

1191
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,156
<i>It worked once.</i>

1192
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:28,891
It'll work again.

1193
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:33,195
We strike hard,
we strike first,

1194
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:35,064
and we show no mercy.

1195
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:38,667
No, these aren't
like the ones in L.A.

1196
00:55:38,736 --> 00:55:40,569
They're bigger.

1197
00:55:40,638 --> 00:55:43,138
They're hotter.

1198
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:45,507
They're nastier.

1199
00:55:45,576 --> 00:55:48,243
So what are you suggesting,
that we just,

1200
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:50,179
simply do nothing and move on?

1201
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:53,582
Suggesting you
don't piss it off.

1202
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:55,718
I don't want you
and your... your friends

1203
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:58,420
to do anything real stupid
like the last time.

1204
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:01,357
I don't have friends.

1205
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:04,193
I got family.

1206
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:07,262
<i>Well, I got bombs,
so you and your family</i>

1207
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:08,864
can just stay tight.

1208
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:10,566
<i>We'll check out your map.</i>

1209
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:12,601
We'll get a confirmation to you.

1210
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,236
Don't hang up on me.

1211
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:24,713
They want us to sit tight.

1212
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:27,916
Sit tight? How can anyone
sit tight right now?

1213
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:31,286
They're gonna get us all killed.

1214
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:34,857
Colton, this is the U.S.
military we're talking about.

1215
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:38,927
Kyle, you know I have
a problem with authority.

1216
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:50,139
Nobody, nobody knows
these spiders

1217
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:50,139
like I know these spiders.

1218
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:54,977
Colonel, thermal images are up.

1219
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:01,884
He's right.

1220
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:03,986
Whatever that is,
it's huge.

1221
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:08,056
That is the behemoth
of all spiders.

1222
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,925
Get CENTCOM on the line.

1223
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:11,627
We're gonna smoke her out.

1224
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:14,430
Then we're gonna
light her ass up.

1225
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:19,134
We're gonna light her ass up.

1226
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:20,736
What happened to the chopper?

1227
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:22,638
-We can't get to the chopper!
-Why not?

1228
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:23,906
Remember when I told you
that every time

1229
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:25,574
we split up, weird
stuff happens?

1230
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:26,642
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1231
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,510
Well, I was
on my way to the...

1232
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,146
-Right.
-And all of a sudden...

1233
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:35,918
And...

1234
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:39,354
-And then what?
-Marshmallows.

1235
00:57:39,423 --> 00:57:41,190
So what do we do?

1236
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:42,925
Does anybody have a car?

1237
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:43,926
I do.

1238
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:45,694
-Brilliant!
-Go.

1239
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,134
I don't understand
why we can't just sit back

1240
00:57:52,203 --> 00:57:53,669
and let the military
handle this.

1241
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:55,003
'Cause they don't know.

1242
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:56,605
And they don't know.

1243
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:58,640
You keep saying that.
What don't they know?

1244
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:01,310
They haven't ridden on the back of
one of these things like I have,

1245
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:02,544
And he has.

1246
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:04,012
And they haven't
looked in the eyes

1247
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:05,681
of one of these
things like I have.

1248
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:06,682
And he has.

1249
00:58:08,385 --> 00:58:09,718
TJ...

1250
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:14,656
I think you made a wrong turn.

1251
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:16,158
Yo, yo, chill out.

1252
00:58:16,227 --> 00:58:19,027
<i>This is my hood, a'ight?</i>

1253
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:20,195
We're dead.

1254
00:58:20,264 --> 00:58:21,630
What's happening?!

1255
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:23,332
TJ, shut the hell
up, and get down!

1256
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:26,735
They're shooting at us!

1257
00:58:26,804 --> 00:58:28,303
<i>They're not shooting at us.</i>

1258
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:29,471
<i>Let's go.</i>

1259
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:31,686
Get 'em!

1260
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:34,542
<i>Let's go!</i>

1261
00:58:34,543 --> 00:58:36,695
-There's so many of 'em!
-No! No! No!

1262
00:58:36,696 --> 00:58:38,647
-Are you Colton West?
-Damn skippy.

1263
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,118
"Red Rocket."

1264
00:58:44,965 --> 00:58:46,132
Crazy movie, man.

1265
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:48,830
<i>Yeah. They should have
continued the franchise.</i>

1266
00:58:50,978 --> 00:58:51,326
Look out, man!

1267
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:52,995
Come on!

1268
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:54,713
What are you doing
with my punk-ass brother?

1269
00:58:54,714 --> 00:58:57,299
Who you calling punk-ass, man?
We over here saving Florida.

1270
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:59,868
'Bout to get medieval on y'all.

1271
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:01,470
Dad, get back
in the house, man!

1272
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:02,871
You two stand back.

1273
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,174
I'm gonna show you boys
how it's done.

1274
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:18,620
-What is that, sir?
-Fire retardant.

1275
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:21,223
Well, whatever the hell it is,
it chased them the hell away.

1276
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:23,058
-You have any more of it?
-I'm out.

1277
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:24,028
I'm out of ammo.

1278
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:25,660
Everybody back in the house.

1279
00:59:25,661 --> 00:59:27,496
-All right. Come on.
-When they return...

1280
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:29,398
-Go in, Pops. Go in.
-They're gonna be pissed.

1281
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:33,168
<i>This is Delta One.</i>

1282
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:34,503
<i>Target is in sight.</i>

1283
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:36,805
<i>-We have missile lock.
-Copy that.</i>

1284
00:59:36,874 --> 00:59:38,640
<i>Operation Alpha Foxtrot
is a full go.</i>

1285
00:59:38,709 --> 00:59:39,641
<i>Roger that.</i>

1286
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,143
Let her have it, boys.

1287
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:52,888
We have direct hit, sir.

1288
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:56,024
Well, that should
wake her ass up?

1289
01:00:02,399 --> 01:00:03,732
Greetings.

1290
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:14,509
It's... It's a nice night,
all things considering.

1291
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:16,745
Yeah. It's all right.

1292
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:21,783
I loved "Straight
Out of Compton."

1293
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,051
What?

1294
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,855
Yeah, I know he's busy,
busy destroying this entire city.

1295
01:00:26,924 --> 01:00:29,858
He doesn't know
what he's dealing with.

1296
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:31,727
Now put him
on the damn phone.

1297
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:33,195
What do you want?

1298
01:00:33,263 --> 01:00:35,764
The little spiders,
they don't matter.

1299
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:38,867
It's the big one,
the gargantulantula.

1300
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:40,869
You kill it, and
you kill 'em all.

1301
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,905
-Who's he talking to?
-Well, if it's that easy,

1302
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,274
why don't you just
get some bug spray?

1303
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:48,143
I've done this before.

1304
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:51,747
These lavalantulas, they're
not like the last ones,

1305
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:55,384
and this big one,
it's got so much heat,

1306
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:57,819
no weapon can come close to it.

1307
01:00:57,888 --> 01:00:59,788
<i>-I'm about to prove you wrong.
-Really?</i>

1308
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:03,825
Who's hungry?

1309
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:06,728
Really, Mom, who could
eat at a time like this?

1310
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:09,898
A man's got to eat. Now shut your
mouth, and put some food in it

1311
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:12,501
before I slap you upside
the head, damn boy!

1312
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:14,102
What's wrong with you?

1313
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,971
You don't question your
mama in front of guests.

1314
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,172
I was just saying
I wasn't hungry.

1315
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:18,173
Well, make your butt hungry.

1316
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:22,411
Lord, is this what it takes
for a mama to get her kids

1317
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:26,314
back in the house at the same time,
a damn lavalantula invasion?

1318
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:27,849
Hell, if I'd have known that,

1319
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:29,899
I'd have called up them
lavalantulas years ago.

1320
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,954
Woman, what's wrong with you?
You can't call no lavalantula.

1321
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,823
Don't tell me what
I can and can't do.

1322
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:38,660
I got Colton West up in my
house, a real movie star.

1323
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:40,495
That's very kind of you, ma'am,
and completely accurate.

1324
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:41,596
Don't interrupt me,
movie star.

1325
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:43,699
You need to eat, too.

1326
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:44,933
Look skinnier than
you did 20 years ago

1327
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:46,968
in that "Crimson Flyer" movie.

1328
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,037
It's actually called
"Red Rocket,"

1329
01:01:49,106 --> 01:01:50,672
and it was a huge hit.

1330
01:01:50,741 --> 01:01:52,107
That's the potatoes.

1331
01:01:52,176 --> 01:01:54,643
Elizabeth, you know
them potatoes give me gas.

1332
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:57,646
You gonna eat some potatoes,
or I'm gonna make you wear 'em.

1333
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:02,150
Sir, can you tell me again

1334
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:05,053
what was that material that you were
shooting out of your leaf blower?

1335
01:02:05,122 --> 01:02:07,289
-Fire retardant?
-Really?

1336
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:08,690
Yeah, it's
ammonium phosphate.

1337
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:11,326
That's right.
Girl got a brain.

1338
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:14,029
TJ, why can't you find
a girl like that?

1339
01:02:14,098 --> 01:02:15,664
What are you
talking about, Pops?

1340
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,165
I do. She... She right here,
ain't she?

1341
01:02:21,305 --> 01:02:23,805
Hal, where do you
get that stuff?

1342
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:25,974
Pops used to work
for a fire department.

1343
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:27,342
-Really?
-Yeah.

1344
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:28,810
30 years.

1345
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:30,345
You know, I played
a psychologically

1346
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:31,880
complicated fireman
with a drinking problem

1347
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:34,082
in the hit film, "Scorcher."

1348
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:36,218
I didn't really care
for that movie very much.

1349
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:37,519
Really?

1350
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:39,187
They should have consulted
a real fireman.

1351
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:43,058
And the fire, that computer-generated
crap, man, that just looked silly.

1352
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:44,159
Well, it's Hollywood, Hal.

1353
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:45,360
You know, I just read 'em.

1354
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:46,428
I don't write 'em.

1355
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:48,563
But, anyway,
do you have any more

1356
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:50,532
of that stuff down
at the station?

1357
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:53,001
Hell if I know, man.
I ain't been to the station

1358
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,770
since they cut
my damn pension.

1359
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:58,039
But I can tell you where they
got a load of it, though.

1360
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,040
Where?

1361
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,777
At the airfield,
at the Forest Service.

1362
01:03:01,845 --> 01:03:04,179
That's where we drop it out
of planes for forest fires.

1363
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:06,548
Know anybody who could
fly one of those planes?

1364
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:07,883
You're looking at him.

1365
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:11,720
First job I had when
I got out the Air Force.

1366
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:14,256
Really?

1367
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:18,026
Colton, is there
something on your mind?

1368
01:03:18,095 --> 01:03:21,630
I'm thinking.

1369
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:25,133
Now, one of those planes, we'd
never get close enough to drop it.

1370
01:03:25,202 --> 01:03:28,436
That big one, the heat
coming off of it,

1371
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:30,205
would explode
the plane immediately.

1372
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:32,240
Yeah, or if we even
try to get close,

1373
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,276
she'll shoot that cilica
garbage or whatever that is,

1374
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:36,278
and we would fry.

1375
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:39,314
At the school, when we
were being attacked,

1376
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:40,649
the spiders didn't see us.

1377
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:42,551
She's right.
We got so cold in there.

1378
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:43,952
We lowered our body temperature

1379
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:45,987
enough that we were
invisible to them.

1380
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:47,289
Really?

1381
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:51,760
So have you got any guys

1382
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:55,297
who could help us load
one of those planes?

1383
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:56,298
Not a problem.

1384
01:03:56,366 --> 01:04:00,335
And have you got any guys
who can get us to that airfield?

1385
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:01,736
Not a problem.

1386
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:03,772
And how do you feel
about helping me

1387
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:06,074
beat that thing and
saving this city?

1388
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,176
Not a problem.

1389
01:04:08,245 --> 01:04:10,078
Good.

1390
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:14,416
Then let's extinguish the bitch.

1391
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:20,689
Heavenly Father.

1392
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:22,123
-What?
-Breaking news.

1393
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:25,260
<i>Live pictures coming in
now from downtown Miami</i>

1394
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:26,695
<i>-at Imagination Stadium.
-Damn.</i>

1395
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:28,496
<i>We can now see
what the military</i>

1396
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:30,932
<i>has been targeting
with those airstrikes.</i>

1397
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:34,436
<i>My goodness.
It's a giant lavalantula.</i>

1398
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:37,005
<i>The entire stadium
has been reduced to rubble.</i>

1399
01:04:47,584 --> 01:04:49,885
Let's move out.

1400
01:04:49,953 --> 01:04:53,889
Well, that sure as hell
ain't no itsy-bitsy spider.

1401
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:55,891
She's really big, sir.

1402
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:58,660
Blow her up.

1403
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:00,829
<i>Target is live.
Proceed and destroy.</i>

1404
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:03,732
<i>Roger that. All right, fellas,
you heard the man.</i>

1405
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,567
<i>Let's go light her up.</i>

1406
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,412
Tommy's hit!
We're too close!

1407
01:05:17,481 --> 01:05:19,381
<i>Pull up! Pull up!</i>

1408
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,186
It's not working, sir!

1409
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,588
Nothing is getting through!

1410
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:37,766
Gimme, gimme. I'm gonna
maintenance these.

1411
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:39,834
Thanks a lot.
Yes, yes.

1412
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:43,038
Colton!
Arni!

1413
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:45,073
What the hell are you
do... Zip it, Colton!

1414
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:48,076
You were a pain in the ass when your
career was going in the toilet,

1415
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:49,911
and you're a bigger
pain in the ass now!

1416
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,579
That's what you risked
your life for to tell me?

1417
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:53,848
I know what you're up to.
Are you out of your mind?!

1418
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:55,050
No, I've never been clearer.

1419
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,284
I think I found
a higher calling.

1420
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:58,053
Higher calling, my ass.

1421
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,689
You want to waltz into cities
and save millions,

1422
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:02,223
you go through me.

1423
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,125
I'm your agent!

1424
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:06,094
-You think Hollywood pays well?
-Yeah.

1425
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:08,263
Well, wait'll we hit up
Uncle Sam for your services.

1426
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:09,297
Really?

1427
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:10,799
Now you want to save a city...

1428
01:06:10,867 --> 01:06:12,400
They go through me.

1429
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,802
And we're gonna make millions.

1430
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:15,203
-Millions? Millions.
-Millions! Millions!

1431
01:06:15,272 --> 01:06:16,438
I gotta go save the world.

1432
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:17,906
All right.
I'm gonna make some calls.

1433
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:19,140
That's my agent.

1434
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:20,608
-You came to me.
-Go get 'em!

1435
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:22,210
-Amazing! Came to me!
-Go get 'em!

1436
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:23,979
All right, what's the
number for San Francisco?

1437
01:06:25,716 --> 01:06:29,784
She can drop 90,000 gallons
of fire retardant on a target

1438
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:32,287
before you can call
for more peanuts.

1439
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,457
That good enough for you?

1440
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:38,093
That'll be just fine.

1441
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:41,396
This is gonna be
a dangerous flight, Hal.

1442
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:43,064
Man, I've flown
through stuff

1443
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:45,767
turn your butt whiter
than you already are.

1444
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:48,136
Ain't no spider
gonna take me down.

1445
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:52,407
This is not your average spider.

1446
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:54,909
That's great,
but in my world,

1447
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:58,179
if it's got eight legs,
it's a damn spider.

1448
01:06:58,248 --> 01:07:01,816
Now we gonna keep
wasting time talking,

1449
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:04,486
or we gonna go ahead
and take her out?

1450
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,423
We're gonna take her out.

1451
01:07:19,603 --> 01:07:23,138
Sir, the missiles
can't get through.

1452
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,273
Well, target the ground
near her feet.

1453
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:27,375
Maybe she'll sweep the leg.

1454
01:07:27,444 --> 01:07:30,278
We can't, sir. It's her heat
signature. Nothing's getting close.

1455
01:07:30,347 --> 01:07:32,380
The missiles are detonating
before they can impact.

1456
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:34,482
Colton was right.
She's too hot.

1457
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,951
Well, it's time
for an alternative.

1458
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,153
Alternative, sir?

1459
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:39,788
Get the President
on the horn.

1460
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:42,690
We just may have to nuke my
little darlin' straight back to hell.

1461
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,393
Sir, if we do that,

1462
01:07:45,462 --> 01:07:47,629
you'll destroy the entire state.

1463
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:50,265
Let's hope that's all.

1464
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:58,173
Good people of Florida,

1465
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,742
your state has come under attack

1466
01:08:00,811 --> 01:08:03,945
from one of the worst menaces
known to modern history,

1467
01:08:04,014 --> 01:08:05,380
a creature so heinous,

1468
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:07,782
it can only come
from the pits of Hell,

1469
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:11,619
and if we don't stop it,
millions of people will die,

1470
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:14,689
and your great city
will be reduced to ashes.

1471
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:16,591
But not on my watch!

1472
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:20,028
Do you know what people say
about the great state of Florida?

1473
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:21,296
It's too humid.

1474
01:08:21,364 --> 01:08:23,131
Yeah, yeah, they
actually do say that.

1475
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:27,869
What does this Angeleno know
about the great state of Florida?

1476
01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:30,138
Florida is a state of winners!

1477
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:31,773
Can you tell me what NFL team

1478
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:35,443
is the only team to be
undefeated in history?

1479
01:08:35,512 --> 01:08:36,811
-The Dolphins!
-The Dolphins!

1480
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,614
That's right.
The Dolphins from '72.

1481
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:41,549
And where did the king,
LeBron James,

1482
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:44,319
go to get his championship ring?

1483
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:45,320
Cleveland!

1484
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:46,654
-Miami!
-Miami!

1485
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:47,889
That's right, Miami.

1486
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,725
And which state has the
most beautiful beaches,

1487
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:53,428
the hottest women,
the most golf courses?

1488
01:08:53,497 --> 01:08:56,297
And the only state to have
no state income tax?

1489
01:08:56,366 --> 01:08:58,133
Alaska!

1490
01:08:58,201 --> 01:08:59,467
Nevada.

1491
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:01,603
-South Dakota's one.
-Yeah.

1492
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:02,804
It's true, but, Arni,

1493
01:09:02,873 --> 01:09:04,506
I'm trying to do
a hero thing here.

1494
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:05,507
You asked a question!

1495
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:06,741
I know, but give me a break!

1496
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,912
When aliens come to visit,
which state do they choose?

1497
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:12,113
Florida.

1498
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:16,251
She's just kidding.

1499
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,953
There are no aliens in Florida.

1500
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:20,688
Okay.

1501
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:22,490
I don't know
anything about aliens,

1502
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:25,160
but I do know when
the United States of America

1503
01:09:25,228 --> 01:09:28,830
sends a rocket into space,
they don't send it

1504
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:31,099
from Oregon
or South Dakota or Nevada.

1505
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:32,100
They send it from...

1506
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:34,102
-Florida!
-Florida!

1507
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:36,104
I won this fight in Los Angeles,

1508
01:09:36,173 --> 01:09:40,108
and fate has brought me
here to Florida,

1509
01:09:40,177 --> 01:09:43,211
and together, there's
no way we're gonna lose.

1510
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,613
-Amen.
-Amen. Yeah.

1511
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,148
Tonight we win!

1512
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:49,217
We win! We win!

1513
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:51,986
We win! We win!

1514
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:55,823
-Yeah.
-That's right.

1515
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:56,858
-That's right.
-Yeah!

1516
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:01,996
Can somebody help me down?

1517
01:10:02,065 --> 01:10:03,331
I got you, buddy!
I got you.

1518
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,699
-Thank you, Arni.
-Swing your leg down.

1519
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:06,134
I have to swing
my legs down.

1520
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:07,168
<i>Okay, then I go...
All right.</i>

1521
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:08,469
<i>1, 2, 3. Go!</i>

1522
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,371
<i>Yo, Arni! My God!</i>

1523
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,808
Colt, if the missiles can't get
close enough without detonating,

1524
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,411
how are you gonna get close
enough in the plane?

1525
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,346
I got this, sweetie.

1526
01:10:18,415 --> 01:10:20,715
You just stay here
in the hangar.

1527
01:10:20,784 --> 01:10:22,884
I'll be back.

1528
01:10:25,288 --> 01:10:27,088
You better be back.

1529
01:10:27,157 --> 01:10:29,390
Promise.

1530
01:10:29,459 --> 01:10:30,692
Love you.

1531
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,026
<i>Get some coolant right here.</i>

1532
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:35,997
<i>Let's go ahead and mark it off.</i>

1533
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,498
<i>Hey, we're all clear over here.</i>

1534
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,610
...3, Philadelphia.

1535
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:50,678
300,000 for Allentown.

1536
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,914
-Hey, turn that up.
-Okay.

1537
01:10:52,983 --> 01:10:54,249
<i>Continuing our live coverage now</i>

1538
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:56,384
<i>of this catastrophic event.</i>

1539
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:58,253
<i>Miami has been evacuated,</i>

1540
01:10:58,321 --> 01:11:02,257
and the military continues
to pound this enormous beast

1541
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:05,360
in what is now being called
"Arachnid Freedom."

1542
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:08,730
<i>Hal, how do we get close enough
to that thing without being seen?</i>

1543
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:11,599
If we take her high enough,
the plane will freeze.

1544
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:13,901
<i>Mr. West, stand by
for Colonel Jester.</i>

1545
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:14,902
<i>Colton!</i>

1546
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:16,771
How's it going, Colonel?

1547
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,140
I think you damn well know
how it's going, Mr. West.

1548
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:21,743
Don't you worry. We got a
plan that'll save us all.

1549
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:24,779
-Well, we got our own plan.
-No, no, no.

1550
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:27,215
You cannot nuke Miami, sir.
That's insane.

1551
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:28,449
Well, who said
anything about that?

1552
01:11:28,518 --> 01:11:29,484
<i>I've made that movie,</i>

1553
01:11:29,552 --> 01:11:31,619
and it always
ends with nukes.

1554
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:33,621
You just can't do it. You
gotta trust me on this one.

1555
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:37,425
Sir, we picked up a C-130 entering
the restricted no-fly zone.

1556
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:40,461
Colton, is that you

1557
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,463
<i>riding through a
restricted air zone?</i>

1558
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:44,465
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

1559
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:46,601
I'm trying to tell you
we've got a plan,

1560
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:48,069
but you gotta
listen to me.

1561
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:50,338
I've got 90,000 gallons
of fire retardant

1562
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:51,806
that says I know
what I'm doing.

1563
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:55,343
<i>I love all your films, Colton,
but we're out of time</i>

1564
01:11:55,412 --> 01:11:57,278
for any Hollywood
half-baked rewrites.

1565
01:11:57,347 --> 01:11:59,447
Look, I took one
of these things out

1566
01:11:59,516 --> 01:12:01,149
without the military
and without you,

1567
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:03,251
and I'll be damned
if I can't take another,

1568
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,285
but I'm gonna need your he...

1569
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:11,025
Holy...

1570
01:12:14,197 --> 01:12:16,597
<i>The repeated military attacks
on this enormous creature</i>

1571
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:19,133
<i>are failing to have
their intended effect,</i>

1572
01:12:19,202 --> 01:12:22,437
<i>but we understand new reports
are filtering in,</i>

1573
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,439
and you are
hearing this correctly,

1574
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:27,342
that Colton West is
piloting a civilian aircraft

1575
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:28,676
into the hot zone.

1576
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:37,452
Pull up!

1577
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:48,730
<i>Incoming!</i>

1578
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:50,565
Brace yourself.

1579
01:12:50,633 --> 01:12:52,400
Tail!

1580
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:57,538
<i>Marty, you guys
all right back there?</i>

1581
01:12:57,607 --> 01:12:59,374
We're hit! I repeat,
we're hit, captain!

1582
01:12:59,442 --> 01:13:01,042
How bad's the damage?

1583
01:13:01,111 --> 01:13:02,510
We're in a plane full of smoke!

1584
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:04,045
How bad do you think it is?

1585
01:13:04,114 --> 01:13:06,481
It's bad!
It's very, very bad!

1586
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,383
Come on, Colton. No more
screwing around here.

1587
01:13:08,451 --> 01:13:09,484
Just hold on.

1588
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:11,686
<i>I do not have time to hold on,</i>

1589
01:13:11,755 --> 01:13:12,920
<i>and neither do you.</i>

1590
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:14,822
We gotta get higher.

1591
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,858
Right now, I'm just
hoping it stays together.

1592
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:18,493
If she sees us,
it won't matter.

1593
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,395
Colton...
Colonel, just trust me.

1594
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:22,163
Get your fighters in position,

1595
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:24,065
-and wait for my mark.
-Colton!

1596
01:13:24,134 --> 01:13:26,534
I don't think I could
take her any higher!

1597
01:13:26,603 --> 01:13:27,769
Come on! Come on!

1598
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:35,510
No! No, no! Man,
we're in a stall!

1599
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:47,789
Come on!

1600
01:13:47,857 --> 01:13:49,924
He's so bad at this!

1601
01:13:49,993 --> 01:13:52,093
Hey, what are you
doing up there?!

1602
01:13:52,162 --> 01:13:54,395
Not good!
This is not good!

1603
01:13:54,464 --> 01:13:55,696
-Come on!
-Colton,

1604
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,698
your plane is
in a dead stall.

1605
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:00,468
I'm sorry, but it's time
for my plan now.

1606
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:02,103
No! No nukes,
Colonel!

1607
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:03,604
Don't count us out yet!

1608
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:09,110
Marty,
get the payload ready.

1609
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:11,412
Houston, we got
a damn problem.

1610
01:14:11,481 --> 01:14:13,381
What?
He's right!

1611
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,917
The drop mechanism
is malfunctioning.

1612
01:14:15,985 --> 01:14:17,051
The bay doors won't open.

1613
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,720
That's not good.
Not good?

1614
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,055
Our odds of getting out
of this alive are...

1615
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:22,490
Never tell me the odds!

1616
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:25,059
You get this plane
out of a stall,

1617
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:27,929
and, Hal, get the
bay doors open.

1618
01:14:37,373 --> 01:14:39,607
They're headed
right for her, sir.

1619
01:14:39,676 --> 01:14:43,578
That son of a bitch
is going kamikaze on us.

1620
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,122
I've got the controls back!

1621
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:58,626
I'm coming home, Elizabeth!

1622
01:14:58,695 --> 01:15:00,428
Hal, open the bay doors!

1623
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:03,998
I can't. The mechanism
is still fried, man.

1624
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:05,533
You gotta cut the
hydraulic cables.

1625
01:15:05,602 --> 01:15:07,935
What do you mean? You
can't drop the payload?

1626
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:09,303
We have no power at all!

1627
01:15:09,372 --> 01:15:11,439
The only way this is
gonna work is manual.

1628
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:13,641
We gotta do it manual,
or we all die, savvy?

1629
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,376
But wait.
We gotta be closer.

1630
01:15:15,445 --> 01:15:17,011
If we drop this now,
it's just gonna

1631
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,046
disperse into nothing
over Florida.

1632
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:23,351
Then I'm going down with it.

1633
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:31,025
Kyle, cut the cable!

1634
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:32,894
Okay.

1635
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:38,666
Hal, patch me
into the hanger.

1636
01:15:38,735 --> 01:15:39,667
All right, man.

1637
01:15:39,736 --> 01:15:42,069
Raya!

1638
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:45,673
That red light in the sky,
that's for you, honey.

1639
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:49,010
You tell your mom and
Wyatt that I love 'em.

1640
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:50,244
Dad!

1641
01:15:50,313 --> 01:15:51,345
I love you!

1642
01:15:51,414 --> 01:15:52,813
I love you!

1643
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:56,884
Ahoy.

1644
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:02,156
Hey, Colton, are you
sure about this?

1645
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:04,325
Just like old times, Marty!

1646
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:05,860
Damn!

1647
01:16:05,929 --> 01:16:07,562
Let's go!

1648
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:09,830
Go get 'em, baby!

1649
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,534
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1650
01:16:13,603 --> 01:16:15,937
Let's go!

1651
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:29,450
Colonel,
we're getting intel

1652
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:32,119
that Colton West is doing a
HALO drop into the hot zone.

1653
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:33,287
He what?

1654
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:41,529
Yippee-ki-yay,
gargantulantula!

1655
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:54,375
Indiana Jones got
nothing over this guy.

1656
01:16:54,444 --> 01:16:57,945
Spiders. I hate spiders.

1657
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:13,594
She's down.

1658
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:15,596
What the hell's
going on up there?

1659
01:17:15,665 --> 01:17:17,398
Colonel, hit her
with all you got.

1660
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:19,100
Who's this?

1661
01:17:19,168 --> 01:17:20,101
Now!

1662
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:23,938
Fire.

1663
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:34,915
Direct hit, sir.

1664
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:35,916
Yeah!
Yeah!

1665
01:17:39,589 --> 01:17:40,955
Target is destroyed.

1666
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:42,256
I repeat,
target is destroyed!

1667
01:17:48,698 --> 01:17:49,964
Yeah!

1668
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:51,298
Son of a bitch.

1669
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:52,633
He did it again.

1670
01:17:52,702 --> 01:17:53,634
Right on!

1671
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:55,936
All right!

1672
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:01,308
<i>...talking about,
fellas. Good job.</i>

1673
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:03,044
What about West, sir?

1674
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:16,023
He couldn't possibly
have made it.

1675
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:24,999
Real good job.
Hey.

1676
01:18:25,068 --> 01:18:26,567
Look.

1677
01:18:30,773 --> 01:18:31,906
Good job, man.

1678
01:19:18,154 --> 01:19:19,687
Remember me?

1679
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:22,389
Come here.

1680
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:26,594
Where's my buddy?

1681
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:28,062
God!

1682
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:29,630
Yeah.
Ho ho!

1683
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:31,031
Let me see here.

1684
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,032
Colonel.

1685
01:19:34,537 --> 01:19:35,703
Colton West.

1686
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:38,405
Told you. We had a plan.

1687
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:39,607
Glad you made it.

1688
01:19:39,675 --> 01:19:41,408
Yeah, well, thankfully I did,

1689
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:45,412
but the gargantulantula,
she wasn't as lucky.

1690
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:47,481
She's terminated, all right.

1691
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:49,283
It's a job well done, boy.

1692
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:50,885
Sorry I ever doubted you.

1693
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:52,720
You know what?

1694
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:57,291
I'm gonna take my whole battalion
to see your next movie twice.

1695
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,759
Well, thank you, General.

1696
01:19:58,828 --> 01:19:59,960
It's Colonel.
Whatever.

1697
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,403
My little girl.

1698
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:10,938
I love you, Dad.

1699
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,640
I love you, too.

1700
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:14,241
Wait a minute.

1701
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,776
You called me Dad.

1702
01:20:15,845 --> 01:20:18,813
That's the sweetest thing
you could say to me.

1703
01:20:18,881 --> 01:20:21,482
Deal with it.
Gladly.

1704
01:20:21,551 --> 01:20:24,351
And you cannot tell
your mom about any of this.

1705
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,353
Dad,
it's all over the news.

1706
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:28,656
I guess
she's used to it.

1707
01:20:28,724 --> 01:20:30,457
Come here.

1708
01:20:30,526 --> 01:20:32,159
Just remember, guys,

1709
01:20:32,228 --> 01:20:35,763
it doesn't matter if you win
by an inch or a lavalandslide.

1710
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:37,832
Winning is winning!

1711
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:38,933
Yes!
