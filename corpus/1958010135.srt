I was in this tiny town in Georgia,

me and my friend Vic,

12
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:51,677

and we kept asking the local people.

He's like, "We got eight hours off
is there anything fun to do?"

all of them responded with,

"Well, you can zip line
to another state for $55."

00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,109
And I asked the one guy,

17
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:09,653
just 'cause I wanted to see
if he would know,

00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:14,033
I go, "What state would I end up in
if I chose to do it?"

19
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,327
And he literally answered me
with a question.

00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,288
He goes, "Alabama?"

00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,372
Yes.

with your criminals in Georgia.

185 years and I was like,

171
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,156
"You know what? I should start doing
some bucket list stuff

172
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,242
that I wanna do
before I decide to quit the road,"

173
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,244
and one of the things
I've always wanted to do

174
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,080
was go ice fishing because it looks fun.

175
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:02,292
And I booked myself at a casino
in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

176
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,461
No. Yeah.

177
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,923
If you've never been there,
uh, it is beautiful.

178
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,550
It's probably some of the most
beautiful landscapes I've ever seen.

179
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,679
But the people,
um, I would describe them,

180
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,181
and I think they would be proud of this,

181
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,309
I would describe them as feral.

182
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,852
Like...

183
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,235
they are not properly socialized.

184
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,278
Like...

185
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,781
when you're talking to them,
they have long pauses.

186
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,242
I'm like, "Are we done
or do you have more thoughts?

187
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,787
This is not a normal rhythm
to a conversation."

188
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,707
They're all real nice though.

189
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,584
The lady in charge of the gig,
I say, "Can you find somebody

190
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,586
to take me ice fishing on Saturday?

191
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,587
She called me back.

192
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:51,174
She goes, "Okay, Kathleen,
I found a guy that's gonna take you

193
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,302
and I promise he's not a pervert."

194
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,638
What?

195
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,683
Why would you say something like that?

196
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,644
Like, what are you
trying to get out in front of?

197
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:07,149
What's going on up here in the past?

198
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,942
Because, I mean, I'm still going,

199
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:12,404
but now I'm gonna be thinking
about that the whole time.

200
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,407
I mean,
just looking at this strange man going in.

201
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,993
I'm either gonna catch some fish
or out of nowhere

202
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,661
he's gonna sexually assault me.

203
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,788
But then I thought,

204
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:26,293
"Yeah, but I bought so many different
pieces of clothing from Bass Pro Shop."

205
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,046
I would almost challenge him like,

206
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,550
"If you could get it off, you win it
because you won't...

207
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,178
you won't get it off
because I don't know how I got it on.

208
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,846
I'm never getting out of these clothes."

209
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,603
Be the first #MeToo from what I saw.

210
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,609
#MeToo.

211
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,570
I wanted to
support the women of the Me Too Movement,

212
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,698
but like at one point,
I turned on CNN and they literally,

213
00:10:56,782 --> 00:11:00,577
the people in charge,
were chasing Chuck Grassley down...

214
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,163
the senator from Iowa
down a hallway to speak to him

215
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,790
about the Me Too Movement.

216
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:05,957
[BLOWS RASPBERRY]

217
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,000
Ladies,

218
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:12,214
Chuck is an 88-year-old farmer from Iowa.

219
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,510
He doesn't even understand
why you're out...

220
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,640
like of the house.

221
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,518
Like, "It's a Tuesday.

222
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,437
Where are your children,
you two bad whores?

223
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:32,109
And if you're here,
who's making supper for your husband?

224
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,486
I don't understand what's happening."

225
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,614
He's 88.

226
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,074
He's not gonna get it.

227
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,660
Don't waste your time on him,
like, old guys,

228
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,412
it's... some of it is generational.

229
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,997
My dad doesn't get it
and my dad's very liberal,

230
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,499
but he's also 80.

231
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,583
This is his "Me too" thing.

232
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,711
He goes, "This 'Me Too' thing,
I mean, obviously,

233
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:55,132
I don't wanna see you girls
get attacked at work."

234
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,466
Thanks, Dad.

235
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,135
That's a good thought.

236
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,220
I like going to work with that thought.
You know what?

237
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,807
Today, Dad's on my side
about not getting attacked.

238
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,394
He goes,
"But seriously, this for 'Me Too' thing,

239
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,646
are we gonna take it too far?

240
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,981
Hmm?

241
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:15,026
Are you not even gonna be able
to wink at a gal in your office?"

242
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,114
Nobody's doing that anymore, Dad.

243
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:23,201
I don't know...
I don't know when it was popular,

244
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,413
like, back in the '60s
when <i>Bewitched</i> was on or whatever,

245
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:30,250
and you guys
would all go get shitfaced at lunch

246
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,252
and then just go back
and wink your ass off

247
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,505
as nobody you thought was super-hot?
Uh-uh."

248
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,343
All right, Dad,
if you winked a little at a millennial,

249
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,304
they wouldn't even know
what you were doing.

250
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,056
They would just be like,
"Oh, my God, there's something wrong

251
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,727
with Mr. Madigan's eye."

252
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,354
Like every time
I walk by his office, he's like...

253
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:59,362
Maybe he has that dry eye Jennifer Aniston
talks about in those commercials, right?

254
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,032
Like, we should get them those drops,
as a secret Santa

255
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,658
and just leave them there for him.

256
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,164
In the Me Too Movement,
all the men that were accused...

257
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,875
what was crazy is the media,
it didn't matter who was accused,

258
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,211
another rich, powerful boss guy,
they'd go,

259
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,629
"Is it this shocking?"

260
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,590
No, because the men you're talking about
are in charge

261
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,383
and they're the boss
and they have money and power.

262
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,303
It'll be shocking,
like, if you told me Jerry

263
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,263
from the bowling alley did all that shit.

264
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:29,476
I'm like, "What? Stop it.
You're kidding me."

265
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,729
Jerry can't do it,
because Jerry has no power.

266
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,397
Jerry only has power over shoes.

267
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,775
That's Jerry's area.

268
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,652
And nobody cares about your bowling shoes.

269
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,529
You take what you're given
and you're happy.

270
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,782
It's just that easy,
but, like, no matter what guy,

271
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,909
Charlie Rose was one of the big ones
because they thought

272
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,327
he was such an esteemed journalist,

273
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,789
Charlie Rose, I'm not saying he did it.
I have no idea.

274
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,874
But to be accused, not shocking.

275
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,628
It would be shocking if you told me
Charlie Rose was a furry.

276
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,008
I'll be like, "What?

277
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,720
No way. What animal is he?
I wanna know.

278
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,431
I judge people...

279
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,559
on what animal they chose."

280
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,811
And if you don't know what a furry is,
do not feel stupid.

281
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,188
I didn't know them until three years ago.

282
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,775
I was sitting in a San Jose Marriot Bar

283
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,319
that was attached to the convention center

284
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,322
and it was my day off
and all of these people

285
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,158
in elaborate animal costumes started
coming in

286
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,453
and I was like,
"Wow, they're impressive," right?

287
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,163
And I... in my mind, I thought,

288
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:36,876
"Oh, it must be
a mascot convention," right?

289
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,297
You know, 'cause they work alone,
they probably like to get together

290
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,507
and complain about work, like we all do.

291
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:48,597
But then as they kept coming in, I'm like,
"You know, I know a lot about sports

292
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,765
and I don't recognize
any of these mascots."

293
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,853
So then all on my own, I decided,

294
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:59,441
"Oh, I bet it's minor league,"
you know, because there are so many teams.

295
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,067
You can't keep up.

296
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,946
The Savannah Bananas,
you know, like, too many.

297
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,701
So the bartender came back and I go,
"When... how long are the mascots in town?"

298
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,038
He's like, "What?

299
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,373
Lady, those are furries."

300
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,459
I go, "Oh, what's a furry?"

301
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,128
He goes, "Well, I'm not one of them
and I don't wanna answer that question."

302
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,927
I said, "Well, my phone's dead.
Come on, I can't Google it."

303
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,306
He goes, "Well,
they're like Millennial type age people

304
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,017
and they like to dress up like animals.

305
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,104
And then they come to these conventions
and some of them just wanna be the animal

306
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,107
and then others wanna hook up
as the animal."

307
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:46,154
Okay. I said, "Well, can I just ask
one follow-up question?

308
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:50,241
Um, if, if you're gonna hook up,

309
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:54,621
do you have to stay
within your species or is that taboo?

310
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,625
Like can the beagle get with the iguana
if nobody knows, or like...?"

311
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,464
he was like, "Yeah."
And then he walked away.

312
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,965
I'm like, "Well, I still wanted a beer.

313
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,385
I know that you didn't like
that conversation."

314
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,973
I'm like, "Wow. That's what a lot
of the Millennials are doing on weekends."

315
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,017
And you know what?
I am a fan of the Millennials

316
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:19,062
because they're the first generation
that has realized

317
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,357
that if you live with your parents
long enough,

318
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,609
eventually they'll be glad you're there.

319
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,694
Yes!

320
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,490
It's gonna take a while,
but grind it out, Millennials

321
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,576
'cause when your...
when your parents are 85

322
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,036
and they see you in the kitchen,
they'll be like,

323
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,831
"Hey, can you drive at night?

324
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,711
That's fantastic.

325
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,672
We wanna go to bingo on Friday at 8:00.

326
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,299
What's your name again?

327
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,885
Matt?

328
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,220
Okay, Matt.

329
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:56,433
So, Matt, did you leave ever
or did you fail and come back,

330
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,269
or did you just... have you been here?
We forgot."

331
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,568
I am frequently shocked though
when you're dealing with Millennials

332
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:10,321
in the general public
and I think it's kind of nice I guess

333
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:15,618
that they truly believe on some level
that strangers care about them.

334
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,703
Like...

335
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:22,208
I was in Lowe's
and I had all these tiny paint samples

336
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,377
and paint brushes,
I just... I set 'em down.

337
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:28,631
And then I... the guy was like 30 whatever,
and I go, "Hey, how are you doing, man?"

338
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:33,970
He goes, "Uh, not good, lady. Not good."

339
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,222
He said, "I just saw the work schedule

340
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,433
and I was supposed to have
three days off in a row

341
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,770
because I worked three days in a row,

342
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:44,773
and I don't.

343
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,233
And I don't even know
if I wanna work here anymore."

344
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,570
And in my head, I thought,

345
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,615
"Oh, my God, he thought I meant that."

346
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:01,164
I don't really care how you are, sir.

347
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,333
I barely care that I'm here.

348
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,668
I... that was just a pleasantry.

349
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,546
Those are nice things you say
to keep society moving

350
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,381

so we don't kill each other
with barbecue equipment on weekends,

352
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,595
like nobody cares.

353
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,516
Yeah.

354
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,685
I... that's why I think we could use
a little bit more to people

355
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,854
being nice in public and pleasant

356
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,940
because I think everybody
forgot to behave,

357
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:31,402
how to behave in the general public,
like I went into a Taco Bell...

358
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,570
yeah, like, be nice.

359
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,322
It's not that hard.

360
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:40,078
People have just flipped their lids like...
I went to a Taco Bell.

361
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,247
Now, there's only two girls,
they're probably in their 20s

362
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,541
and there's only two employees
'cause we're not employees anymore.

363
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,627
One's trying to fix the drive-thru
which is broken, which is why I went in

364
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,256
and there's one girl that's gonna wait
on me and there's a man ahead of me.

365
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,590
He's about mid-60s.

366
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,844
She tells him
they're completely out of mild sauce.

367
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,304
And he loses it.
He just loses it.

368
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,764
And he starts yelling and screaming.

369
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:00,974
And in my mind, I'm like,

370
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,811
"Dude, that is the last lady
on the Titanic

Like, don't piss her off
because that's the 20-somethings,

00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,194
they will quit, sir.
I don't think you understand.

374
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,281
They will fucking leave in a minute."

375
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,159
And they all agree on that.

376
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,413
It's like they formed a union
without ever having a meeting.

377
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,335
It's... and I think their union
should be called "Yeah, no,"

378
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,671
'cause they won't.

[CROWD CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

380
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,138
And good for them, you know,

381
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,140
'cause it never occurred
to our generation.

382
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,018
"Hey, I could just leave here."
Nope. Never even thought about it.

383
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,897
"Oh, man, this blows but I'm gonna stay
'cause I thought I'd die."

384
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,942
But I'm looking at him going,
he's still yelling at the girl.

385
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:57,071
I'm like, "If she quits, sir,
do you understand we have to do it.

00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,743

I don't.

I want a soft-shelled chalupa, no idea."

388
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,043
Then I went out to the car
and my sister goes,

389
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,170
"Oh, I saw that guy losing his mind.

390
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,296
What was he saying?"

391
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,632
I said, "It doesn't even matter
what he was saying.

00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,635
I can tell you this though,
I know it was for, uh, certainty.

We as a nation are not prepared for war."

394
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,729
That was mild sauce.
Not even fire.

395
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,482
He went that crazy.

396
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:40,073
Sometimes I wish the Millennials
could be a little more flexible though

'cause I think they're linear,

to the point
where sometimes they're like...

400
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:52,001
I was babysitting my brother's three kids,
and I called to get pizzas to be delivered

401
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,671
and the girl goes,
"What's the address?"

402
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,713
And I gave it to her.

403
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:59,842
She goes, "Hmm, yeah, that's not coming up
on GPS so we can't bring your pizza."

404
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:02,679
Oh.

409
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,152
She goes, "No,
because we were taught in training

410
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:21,698
that if you go to a house that has
a GPS address that doesn't come up,

411
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,534
that's exactly how you get lured
to your own death."

412
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:30,790
What?

413
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,625
So I said, just to see...

414
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,544
I wanted to see
if I would get a reaction,

415
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,172
I go, "Yeah. 'Cause I remember
like in the '70s and '80s

416
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:41,884
all those pizza kids that were murdered,
like every weekend

And she just goes, "Yeah. Bye."

421
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:56,441
Like I don't...
she may have believed it, not sure.

422
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,949
They're a trusting bunch,
the Millennials, which I appreciate.

423
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,409
I like, I think it's nice.

I don't think my group,
not trusting at all.

425
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:12,290
Like during COVID, one of the things
that was really weird is like,

426
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,250
most of my normal friends
and my relatives,

427
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,254
they still had to go to work
so they had stuff to do

428
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,215
so nobody wanted
to participate in my world.

429
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,427
And, like, one day I called my brother,
he worked at a bank and I go,

430
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,307
"Hey, Pat, you're not gonna believe this
but there's a king cobra

431
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,018
loose in Grand Prairie, Texas

432
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,145
'cause some asshole

433
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:38,357
forgot to put the lid
on his "cobra cage,"

434
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:41,277
and it's just running around
a normal neighborhood.

435
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,488
And my brother goes, "Well,
you're not gonna believe this Kathleen,

436
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,823
but I have a job."
And he hung up.

438
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:52,163
Boo, Patrick.

439
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,042
So then I texted him,
I knew that would make him mad,

440
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,127
I'm like, "So I guess you don't care
about the zebras

441
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,463
loose in Maryland either then,
do you, Pat?

442
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,756
You wanna know more?

444
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,554
So I didn't have anybody to talk to
so I thought, well...

445
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:11,182
I started Madigan's Pubcast
'cause I thought,

00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:15,812
"Well, there's gonna be a lot of"
yeah, it's fun, people.

447
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,356
Somebody wants
to hear these stories, right?

448
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,482
'Cause they're true.

449
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,527
It's important
there's a cobra loose for Christ's sake.

450
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,864
But I had a Millennial
hit me up on Instagram

451
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,032
and she wrote,

452
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:32,370
"I'm coming to see your show in Austin
'cause I love your podcast.

453

454
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,376
Okay. Fair enough, you know?

455
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,086
She's young, whatever. Fair enough.

00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,841
I go, just out of curiosity,
'cause she had bought a ticket,

00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:49,720
I go, "What did you think I was gonna do
when you got there?"

459
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:52,932

"Well, I didn't know."

"Wow, that's so trusting."

00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,653

to a surprise show in my life.

It doesn't mean that you don't have worth
and you don't have value,

something else to do

00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,220
I mean, there's no difference.

500
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,681
I mean Nancy Pelosi,
I don't really know for sure

501
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:01,769
how old she is, but some days
I know for sure her teeth don't fit right.

502
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,313
I know that. I know that.

503
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,485
'Cause it happens to my mom.

504
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,695
It's a bridge issue.

505
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,489
There's like a clip
that goes on that fang tooth

506
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,575
and if it slips, it's not good.

507
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,996
Like my mom will be speaking like
a totally normal human being

508
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,831
and then it's just full-on Liza Minnelli,

509
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,624
[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]

510
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:24,917
Mom,

511
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,336
fix it.

512
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,255
Clip it back on.

513
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,799
You sound like you're having a stroke
and... I don't know.

514
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:37,346
But Nancy will do it live on TV,
just come out for a press conference.

515
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,390
"Hi, everybody, it's me, Nancy Pelosi.

516
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:43,019
And today I'd like you...
I'd like to discuss insurance.

517
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,313
I'm like, "Ah, fix it."

518
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,484
"Affordable healthcare insurance,
that's what I like to talk about.

519
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,653
I don't know sign language.
It looks like I do.

520
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:57,575
Actually, my hands just do this
'cause I'm Italian.

521
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,285
We talk with our hands.

522
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,579
That's why I have such good skin
'cause I'm Italian.

523
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,456
I'm actually... I'm 64.

524
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,874
Nobody knows that."

525
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,961
No. No.

526
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:12,590
Over 80. Mitch McConnell,
the talking turtle from Kentucky.

527
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:15,843
No, I just can't look at you anymore.

528
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,386
It's over now.

529
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,850
The man's never voted yes
for anything, you know?

530
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,352
"I vote no on everything.

531
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:25,978
That's my thing.

532
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,813
Sometimes
if I haven't voted no in a while,

533
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:33,110
I'll write a bill just to vote against
myself so I stay in practice."

534
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,616
And I'm not saying the Millennials
would be any smarter, I don't know.

535
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:42,119
But I know for sure they don't have
grudges that go back so far,

536
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:45,998
they're not repairable because
I haven't had the time to have 'em.

537
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,667
When you hear these, these people
fighting, and Mitch McConnell,

538
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:53,464
"Well, I remember when Nancy Pelosi
voted against the Spanish-American War."

539
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:57,676
I was like, "You California-salad-eating-

540
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,222
pie-nut-loving-fruitcake-piece-of-shit,

541
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:05,601
them boys at the Alamo would be alive
if it wasn't for Nancy Pelosi."

542
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,606
And so the only time
I've ever voted yes in my life,

543
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,192
reinforcements
for Mr. David Crockett."

544
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,278
Stop.

545
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,117
It's crazy.

546
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,160
And then who are we presented with?

547
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,621
More 80-somethings.

548
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:31,544
Bernie Sanders said he's probably
pretty sure he's gonna run again.

549
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,796
Bernie is like from the Bible old.

550
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:38,384
Like I... if you could bet on DraftKings,

551
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,928
one person is still alive from the Bible,

552
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,848
I'd throw a hundred on Bernie.
I'm like, "Yes."

553
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,643
And I liked Bernie.

554
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,854
I had a soft spot for him 'cause to me,

555
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,313
every time he showed up somewhere,

556
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:54,400
he always looked like he may have just
been involved in a car accident.

557
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,742
"I'm sorry I'm late.

558
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,953
Let me take off my mittens.

559
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,877
The maid in Vermont
by a woman named Naomi.

560
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,588
If you'd like a pair, go to my website."

561
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,594
I thought Biden was too old.

562
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,180
And I don't know why nobody helps the guy,
like I don't get it.

563
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,765
Like when he's out giving speeches,
I would do it for free.

564
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:28,642
I'll be in charge of...
I'll be in charge of him

565
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:31,854
'cause here's what I would say to him,
I go, "Joe, here's the deal.

566
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,815
Guess what?
We're not gonna do anymore story times.

567
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:39,862
We're not... ixnay on the stories, okay?

568
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:43,282
'Cause it's... they're very dated,
stick to the script.

569
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:44,700
And what I'm gonna do for you, Joe,

570
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,662
is I'm gonna stay on side stage
with a burlap bag full of tennis balls.

571
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:53,542
And any time you start going off-script
and telling a story,

572
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:56,462
I'm gonna throw a tennis ball
in your direction, not at you,

573
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,423
just so you see it and you go,

574
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:03,260
'Oh, shit. Right. I'm not supposed
to do that.' Right. Right."

575
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,725
Because at one point he kept repeating
the story, no one's ever stopped him.

576
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,519
It's a story about when he was a teenager

577
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:14,355
and there was another gang
somewhere in Delaware

578
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,399
and that gang leader
was named Corn Pop.

579
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,820
And he said,
"Remember the night before a gang fight

580
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,864
how you'd take that straight razor

581
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:26,992
and you'd put it in a rain barrel
to let it get rusty all night?"

582
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:30,746
"Ah-ah, tennis ball,
where is the tennis ball?"

583
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,124
"What are you talking about?"

584
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,419
A straight razor? No, I don't...

585
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,506
sound like we're in the Westerns
where they go like that on their face

586
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:45,511
and then you're saying you put it in water
on purpose to get it rusty to then,

587
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:49,014
I guess when you stabbed people,
to give them tetanus?

588
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,600
Like, this is sociopathic.

589
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,186
No.

590
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,358
I thought Trump was too old.

591
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,694
But here's where I knew
he was definitely too old

592
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,946
because whenever he gives speeches
in any state

593
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,740
that has any relationship
with coal or coal mining,

594
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,535
he gets up front, everybody goes,
"You know what I'm gonna do?

595
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,621
I'm gonna open, like,

596
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:17,251
a bazillion, gillion,
trillion new coal mines.

597
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,588
And we're gonna have coal everywhere.

598
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:23,591
And all the young people
are gonna be so happy

599
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:28,012
because they could be coal miners
and they can stay in their area."

600
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,558
Part of me thought, "You know what?

601
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,728
I think he believes that in, in some way

602
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,522
but I think you believe that
because you're too old."

603
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:41,609
Because I have met
50,000 Millennials on the road

604
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:46,989
and I have not yet met one that I think
would agree to be a coal miner.

605
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,784
And nor should they.

606
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,415
I would give everything
I have though to see their reaction

607
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,376
to the job description of coal mining,

608
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,006
just sitting on their phones,
half-ass paying attention to me,

609
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,591
"So wait. What?

610
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:13,807
So, like, you want me to go into Earth
in the daytime,

611
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:19,188
in a rollercoaster
to get rocks, like rocks?

612
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:26,362
Well, will my phone work down there
because I won't do it if I can't TikTok.

613
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,405
That's my thing.

614
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:30,741
So, yeah, no."

615
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:39,083
I tried to learn to TikTok
over the pandemic.

616
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,002
My nieces love it,
but they're 13 and they're like,

617
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,379
"We'll show you, Aunt Kath."

618
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,673
And they show me their phones
and I watch them.

619
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,676
If you've never seen TikTok,
it's just a barrage of videos.

620
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:52,471
And I put them down and they're like,
"You didn't like it, did you?"

621
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,474
I go,
"Well, here's what I'll say about it,

622
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:59,853
'I feel like I just sat next to someone
who did an eight ball.'"

623
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,147
[LAUGHTER]

624
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:03,190
"Nope."

625
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,699
I'm a drinker, not a drugger, so nope."

626
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:16,036
And they go like,
"Oh, are you saying it's, like, too much?"

627
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,329
I go, "Yeah, it's way too much.

628
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,289
I can't... I can't process it."

629
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,750
They go, "Yeah. But just because
our videos are mostly

630
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,460
dance, and music, and stuff,

631
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,713
like you could build your own
and it won't be as crazy."

632
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,090
I said, "All right." So I signed up

633
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,927
and I don't know how it decides what
your first batch of videos is gonna be.

634
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,223
But my first batch,
all of my people were in hospice.

635
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,433
I was like...

636
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:41,979
[LAUGHTER]

637
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,606
"This is horrible.
Why would anybody watch this?

638
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,109
Why, why is this entertaining?"

639
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,028
And they're like, "Don't watch it too long
or you'll get a lot more of them."

640
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,115
I was like, "What?"
They're like, "Mm-hmm. Too late.

641
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,825
You went past six seconds."

642
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,954
They go,
"Did you ever watch one somewhere?"

643
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,331
I go, "Okay. On Instagram, I did.

644
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,125
I watched a hospice video.

645
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:07,921
Maybe they know that because the girl
was so young, she was like 26 years old.

646
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,131
She was sadly dying.

647
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,509
But she had said it all started
with her eye twitching,

648
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:15,596
and at the time,
my left eye had been twitching

649
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,097
for like two and a half weeks,

650
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:20,225
I just know I was tired running around."
Then I was like, "Shit.

651
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:21,685
I didn't know it could end like this."

652
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:22,936
Like, this is...

653
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:28,025
I'd prefer Instagram
because it's passive.

654
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,526
It's just... yeah.

655
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,945
It's just, "Oh, look, beagle, puppy.

656
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,281
Beagle...
oh, there's a cat eating a popsicle."

657
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,616
It's just pleasant.

658
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,784
There's nothing bad.

659
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,577
People are nice on Instagram.

660
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,622
Like Twitter,
I like it, but it's aggressive.

661
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,290
You better be ready.

662
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:49,171
It's like walking into a bar at midnight
and everybody's had shots except you.

663
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,255
Yeah.

664
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:55,219
"Well, look what the cat dragged in
with a little opinion about nothing."

665
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:04,019
And I've tweeted about everything
and never really got any backlash,

666
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,106
except, it was shocking... sports.

667
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,149
Who would think?

668
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:10,734
You'd think it'd be politics or...
nope, nope, nope, nope.

669
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:11,985
Just sports.

670
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:15,322
One day, I just tweeted out,
because I'm from St. Louis,

671
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:19,076
I tweeted out, "Go Cards."
That's all I wrote.

672
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,245
"Shut your whore, bitch mouth."

673
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:24,540
Hold on. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

674
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,920
That was uncalled for, okay?

675
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,756
I didn't type, "Fuck the Cubs," did I?

676
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,678
No. I typed, "Go Cards."
That's all I said.

677
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:42,683
So I don't tweet about sports anymore.

678
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:48,230
Facebook, I don't love it.
I have it for work.

679
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,148
But I don't like Mark Zuckerberg,

680
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,776
yeah, because I feel like
he stole all of our information.

681
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,404
He sold it 17 times around the globe
to Sunday

682
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,531
and he never really paid
a price for that.

683
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:58,949
- Right.
- [APPLAUSE]

684
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:03,704
And sadly, last summer,
we had him in front of a senate committee,

685
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:07,916
but the people asking the questions
were so old.

686
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:14,798
I truly think they were just excited
to meet him. I do.

687
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:18,010
"Well, hello there, Mr. Zuckerberg.

688
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:21,263
I joined the Facebook on a Sunday morning.

689
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:27,102
Super happy you're here because,
coincidentally, I forgot my password.

690
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:34,818
It used to be 1234
then the wife said that was too easy.

691
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:36,737
And I changed it but I don't remember.

692
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,073
So I was hoping at the break you could
help me retrieve the said password.

693
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,495
My parents like it, but they're 80."

694
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,789
They get up in the morning,
they drink coffee,

695
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:52,419
and then they troll the entire family,
every second cousin, third cousin,

696
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:55,130
people we lived by when I was five.

697
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,798
That's their morning entertainment.

698
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,092
That's what I told my teenage nieces
and nephews,

699
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:02,137
I'm like, "Uh, heads up,
if I were you guys,

700
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,015
I would not friend Grandpa,

701
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,393
or Grandma for that matter.

702
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:11,396
They look innocent and they seem nice,
but they're spies.

703
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,106
That's what they are.
They're flat-out spies.

704
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,442
They're gonna go through your whole feed

705
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,736
and they're gonna read everything
and then they're gonna tell your parents

706
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,989
who are too busy for that shit
and report back."

707
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:24,785
Well, one nephew goes,
"Well, I already friended Grandpa."

708
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:29,081
I go, "Well, I would unfriend Grandpa."

709
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,334
And he goes, "Well, I think
it would hurt his feelings."

710
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:37,297
I said, "Well, if he were to notice,
which he will not, just tell him it broke.

711
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:46,223
There will be no further questions,

712
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,724
because they'll accept that."

713
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:50,394
"Huh. All right. It broke."

714
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,775
Both of our... both of our parents
just turned 80.

715
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,485
And I go, "You know what? You're the age.

716
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,905
You're the exact age, as a matter of fact,
of people that are running this country."

717
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,324
I said, "Honestly, do you think
you could be the president?"

718
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:08,537
And my dad goes,
"Uh, do you mean individually?"

719
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,250
I said, "As compared to what?"

720
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:17,212
He goes, "As a couple.
Could we do it as a couple?"

721
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,173
I go, "What?"

722
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:23,218
"Well, you know, like, some days,
I don't remember anything,

723
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,095
but your mom will remember
all kinds of stuff.

724
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:28,306
It's weird. And in other days,
she won't remember shit."

725
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,684
And I'm like, "I got you. I got it."

726
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:35,772
"Together, we're probably about 68."

727
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:41,486
He said. But individually,
Christ, no, Kathleen, we can't.

728
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,822
I don't even know where the car is at."

729
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:52,581
I think the cutoff should be 70 or 75.

730
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,082
That's fair enough, right?

731
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,670
If you have to be a minimum age,
there should be a maximum age.

732
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:04,634
Like it... because I've seen the difference
in my parents between, say, 70 and 80.

733
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,345
Like 70, everything was pretty much
all right, I'd say.

734
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:11,725
Eighty, oh, now, whenever I see them,

735
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,519
they're completely covered in Band Aids.

736
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:15,896
I'm like...

737
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,486
"Wow. What are you guys doing?

738
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,822
Are you, like, stabbing each other
with pencils for fun?"

739
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,160
My dad's like, "No, no, no.

740
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,204
It's the medication we take, Kathleen.

741
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:35,165
You're barely banging or something,
there's blood shooting everywhere.

742
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,751
It's a problem. It's a problem.

743
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,048
We can't even go to your sister's house
because of that cat.

744
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:46,510
We'll bleed out over there.
We will bleed out."

745
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,556
He goes, "Look at these scratch marks.

746
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,391
These are three weeks old, Kathleen.

747
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:55,102
They... we don't heal anymore either.

748
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,145
That's a new thing.

749
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,231
We don't heal."

750
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,900
And I looked and I go,
"Oh, my God. Let me go get the new skin."

751
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,527
"It won't work. We tried it.

752
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,696
Here's the problem with new skin,
it turns out your skin,

753
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,367
you have to have enough skin
to connect with that other skin

754
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,160
and we're running out of skin.

755
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,913
I don't know what comes after this."

756
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:20,335
[LAUGHTER]

757
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:26,091
At 80, there's so many health problems
that, like, nothing's alarming anymore.

758
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:29,261
It's like, oh, okay. I called.

759
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,847
They were in Florida and I said,
"Hey, what are you guys doing?"

760
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,515
My mom goes,
"Well, we're going to the hospital

761
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,226
because your dad thinks he might
be having another heart attack."

762
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,770
I said, "Oh, shit."

763
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,898
I go, "Well, let me talk to him."
She goes, "Well, no, he's driving."

764
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:46,027
[LAUGHTER]

765
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,826
I go, "Seriously, Mom?"

766
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:56,580
"I know it's crazy, Kathleen,
but he said if I drive,

767
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,540
he sure will have a heart attack.

768
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,921
And right now, it could be indigestion.
We ate spicy food last night."

769
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:14,389
I don't love calling there
'cause he has his hearing aids.

770
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,017
And if you call somebody
with hearing aids on his cell phone,

771
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,728
this is all you're probably
gonna hear on your end...

772
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:24,065
"Eeeeeee..."

773
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,610
and they don't hear you going, "Hello?"

774
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,361
They don't hear it

775
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,322
because the stupidest system
I've ever heard of,

776
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,866
the hearing aid company decided

777
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:36,119
that when a hearing aid battery
is going even slightly low,

778
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,288
they decided the good idea

779
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:42,250
would be to have the hearing aid
make a noise

780
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:45,295
to alert the hard-of-hearing person,

781
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:48,924
which they don't hear.

782
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,425
Everyone else hears it.

783
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,553
Dogs in the neighborhood are going all...
[MIMICS DARK BARKING]

784
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:56,223
What's that?" [MIMICS DARK BARK]

785
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:57,849
Like, what a dumbass system.

786
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:00,185
Like when the hearing aid
is about to go dead,

787
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,437
that thing should start vibrating
in his ear

788
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,274
and then fly around the house
like that ball in <i>Harry Potter</i>

789
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:10,278
till he grabs it out of the air.

790
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:16,451
And then when they get older,
there's less to talk about

791
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,161
because they do less, you know.

792
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:22,249
So when I call, that's fine,
but like they golf.

793
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:23,541
They like to golf.

794
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,752
So if I ask my dad, how was golf,

795
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,629
oh, 45-minute answer.

796
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,756
I don't know if that's a dude thing.

797
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,676
He will go through every hole,
every club, every putt,

798
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,679
how he was in the woods
versus my mom, nope.

799
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,055
"Mom, how was golf?"

800
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,682
"I saw a fox."

801
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:43,019
Yes. Thank you.
That's what I'm looking for.

802
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:47,023
Short, concise, interesting, animal-based.

803
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:48,775
Jesus Christ.

804
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:54,239
She has an iPhone because
I bought it and I sincerely wish I hadn't

805
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,117
because now,
every time it breaks, she calls me.

806
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,953
She's like, "Kathleen, that iPhone
you bought me broke again

807
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,579
so I took it to Walmart."

808
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:08,378
Random. "We didn't buy it at Walmart,
but whatever, Mom.

809
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,839
You're 80.
Take all your broken shit into Walmart.

810
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,925
Just throw it on the ground.
Start crying. Maybe somebody will fix it.

811
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:15,635
Maybe you'll be arrested, whatever.

812
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,929
You got to nothing else going on.

813
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,431
Do it."

814
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:22,142
She said, "No, they won't.
They won't help you.

815
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,227
I went back to that phone counter

816
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:27,063
and there was a young guy working there
and he asked me a question.

817
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:28,815
I answered it,
and then he started laughing.

818
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,984
And then another kid came out,
I asked the same question.

819
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,527
And this went on
through three people,

820
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,572
Kathleen." I said,
"Well, what was the question?"

821
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:38,074
She said, "Well, he kept saying,
who is your provider?

822
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:40,076
And I kept saying, my daughter."

823
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,080
[LAUGHTER]

824
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:45,498
No.

825
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,796
I am not... I'm not your provider,
but I'm, like, your... your supplier.

826
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,883
Like a drug deal,
I gave you the supply."

827
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,511
She goes, "Well,
who's our provider as of right now?"

828
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:04,476
I said, "Our provider is Sprint
because we don't care about service."

829
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,689
Sprint is so shilly.

830
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:14,152
But I don't care because some days,
I don't like getting calls, you know.

831
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:19,240
Let the Lord decide
who's getting through. I'll...

I don't have that kind of time.

834
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,333
Sprint is so strange, though.

835
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:31,127
I think I've... I think I stay
because I'm curious

836
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:36,174
because, like, it doesn't work in places
where it should work like here or Chicago,

837
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,010
you know, cities, like,
it doesn't really work.

838
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:42,305
But then out of nowhere,
it'll work in some random ass place.

00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:44,474
That's why I like
if you're gonna go out drinking,

and you think things might get crazy
and maybe go off the rails,

841
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,397
you should make sure
somebody in your group has Sprint

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,108

completely shitfaced tonight

Oh, Sprint.

858
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:42,449
I'm in South Dakota.

859
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,411
There's another one on top of it.

860
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:52,292
I'm not even near a border, you morons.

861
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,920
But then I was curious to see
if they had Uber,

862
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:57,881
and there's nobody in the airport.
It's small.

863
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,884
It's pretty much empty,
but there's an old lady in a card table

864
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,469
that just says "information."

865
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:04,596
And she's doing the crossword puzzle
and I walked out.

866
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,598
But I was very respectful and polite.

867
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,892
I go, "Excuse me, ma'am.
I was just curious.

868
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,768
Do you guys have Uber here?"

869
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:12,854
She'd never stop doing
the crossword puzzle.

870
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,815
She goes, "I don't know anyone
by the name of Uber.

871
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:21,488
But if you need a ride,
I can have Darryl come get you."

872
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:29,245
No. 'Cause when she said "get,"
I heard "take." I'm like, "No.

873
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:31,915
I'm not getting
in the car with Darryl."

874
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,751
So, then I thought,
"Well, I'll just rent a car.

875
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,211
The phone ain't working anyway."

876
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,338
And I rent from Avis and I love Avis.

877
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:41,549
And here's why, 'cause if you rent
a lot of times from Avis,

878
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,635
you get in their frequent renter club.

879
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,471
And their frequent renter club
is the Wizard Club.

880
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,139
So, you become a wizard, right?

881
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:52,560
And they send you a card in the mail,

And I... you would not think that
that would excite me at this age,

00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,358
but it was so awesome.

884
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,486
I was so excited.
And then the greatest part is,

885
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,947
like, if you're in a bigger city
where they have the shuttle,

886
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,406
when the Avis shuttle pulls up,

887
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,785
a full-grown adult has to look at me,

888
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,246
another full-grown adult
and without laughing...

889
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,791

I wanna get dressed up
from head to toe as a wizard.

895
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:34,686
And I don't wanna wait
at the Avis shuttle spot and I...

896
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,354
I don't wanna have luggage or nothing.

897
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:39,857
I wanna have one of those scepter sticks
with the ball on the end.

898
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:43,319
And then when the driver pulls up,
he goes, "Are you a wizard?"

899
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,363
I wanna go, "Ahh!"

No. I was in California. It's a bar.

The girl says,
"I'm gonna need to see your license."

912
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:27,864
I gave it to her. She goes,
"Missouri. Is that by Minnesota?"

913
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:30,366
I said, "It is.

a lot of shows about the Ozarks.

these shows about the Ozarks?"

in Florida."

"Before we go back to Mom and Dad's,
let's just stop and get a beer."

935
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:37,350
And we went to some back ass
Ozark hillbilly bar and we walked in.

We're the only two people. Great.

00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,146
But a guy comes in,
and Missouri is an open-carry state.

938
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,731
That used to mean liquor.

939
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:47,819
Now it just means any weapon you can find
on the Internet, like a cannon.

with a gun on each hip

00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,371

and three shots of Fireball.

"You scared of this?"

00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,900

The other thing is you can always
get into a box of wine.

1158
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,636
I've been given bottles of wine
on the road,

1159
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,930
go back to the hotel.
Shit. No wine opener.

1160
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:21,058
And then, boom, the cork breaks.
Oh, sad times. No wine.

1161
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:23,060
That's never gonna happen
with a box of wine.

1162
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:25,145
'Cause even if that
sprout deal breaks off,

1163
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:26,480
you can stab it.

1164
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,982
You can stab the box.

1165
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,776
You're getting in if you're determined.

1166
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:33,320
Even with a pair of tweezers,
you can get in there.

1167
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,698
But hold them tight
'cause sometimes if it hits it,

1168
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,449
it could slide backwards
and cut your hand.

1169
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:39,618
I'm not gonna tell you
why I would know that,

1170
00:59:39,702 --> 00:59:44,331
but just trust me.

1171
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:51,422
I do find... some of my friends
know a lot about wine,

1172
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:55,301
but sometimes I think
they're situationally unaware.

1173
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:58,637
Like, I took my friend Lou
to a really shitty lake

1174
00:59:58,721 --> 01:00:00,597
dive bar in Tennessee.

1175
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:04,977
We get in and he goes, "So, Kathleen,
did you have a wine list?"

1176
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:06,895
[CROWD LAUGHS]

1177
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:09,273
"Lou, look behind the bar.

1178
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,482
Look on the wall.

1179
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:12,067
You see what we're looking at?"

1180
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:14,862
I go, "That's a stuffed squirrel

1181
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:19,199
playing a tiny banjo, Lou." Yeah.

1182
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:22,619
It's marvelous.
I don't even know where you find that.

1183
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:25,789
Do you Google on Amazon
a squirrel tiny banjo? I don't...

1184
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,210
and then the person shellacked that

1185
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:32,629
and then they nailed that to driftwood

1186
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:35,466
and then they hung that
as a full piece of art.

1187
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:36,592
And you know what?

1188
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,511
The guy who did that, Lou,

1189
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:40,888
does not have a wine list.

1190
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:45,559
I guarantee you that guy has a bottle

1191
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,395
of Jack Daniels
and a carton of Marlboro Reds.

1192
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:50,314
And this is his idea of art.

1193
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,232
And I like it."

1194
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:55,319
[CROWD LAUGHS]

1195
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:00,908
A lot of people, as they get older,

1196
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,368
they just decide to quit drinking.

1197
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:05,287
I'm like, "No, I'm not gonna quit."

1198
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:08,290
I do find, though, the older I get,
there's stuff I won't start

1199
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,459
that I might have when I was young.

1200
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,628
You know, people are...
it's usually physical things.

1201
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,630
"Hey, do you wanna learn how to snow ski?"

1202
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:18,133
"Um, let me Google the deductibles
on broken legs."

1203
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:23,097
Oh, no. I'll be at the bar at $16,000."
No.

1204
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:27,059
I did a corporate gig in Hawaii,
which never happens

1205
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:28,477
and they were such a nice group.

1206
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,896
They were from Minnesota,
this insurance company,

1207
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:33,399
and every day, the leader of the group
would call my room

1208
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,526
to see if I wanted to do their activities.

1209
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:36,860
It was always going,

1210
01:01:36,944 --> 01:01:40,197
"Hey, Kathleen,
that's me, Bob from Minnesota."

1211
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:45,536
"I know, Bob, you don't have to
keep saying the Minnesota part.

1212
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:48,080
I got you because it's either you

1213
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,707
or the My Pillow Guy calling my room.

1214
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:54,002
And I don't know that man."

1215
01:01:54,837 --> 01:01:59,174
He goes, "Well, I just wanted to see
if you wanted to join us for surf camp."

1216
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,969
I said, "Well, I don't have my glasses on,

1217
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,430
but I think it's dark outside right now."

1218
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:06,932
He goes, "Yeah, it's dark, it's 5:30,

1219
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:08,600
but the sun comes up at 6:00

1220
01:02:08,684 --> 01:02:11,520
and we're gonna start surf camp at dawn."

1221
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,439
I thought, "Oh, I didn't say it."

all of these white walleyes from Minnesota

are just gonna drop through their ceiling

But I didn't say that
because I don't wanna be rude.

01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:38,046
And he goes, "Well, you know,
just in case you are afraid,

I wanna let you know
now they have foam surfboards.

and hit you in the face,

You're still not selling me all this, Bob,

01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:53,270
because I'll tell you this, Bob
and I wasn't gonna bring it up,

1238
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,689
but since we keep talking about it
on the way over here,

1239
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,233
I did think about snorkeling
and I Googled, uh,

1240
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:00,402
shark attacks in the water
surrounding Maui.

1241
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:02,404
And in the last six years or five,

1242
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,031
there's been three fatalities.

1243
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,200
Now, that may not seem like a lot

1244
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,577
compared to the amount of people
that are in the water every day,

1245
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:12,080
but it is a lot if you
were one of those three

1246

this young, cute girl, a surfer girl.

had been eaten off by a shark.

because she's gonna surf again

I find out he's having his second affair.

1323
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,155
And now I'm angry. I am.

1324
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:34,449
I'm angry because we have two little kids

1325
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:37,160
and this is their dad
and they really like him.

1326
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:39,788
And again, I chose to stay.

1327
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:41,957
And then fast forward
a few more years later,

1328
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,543
I found out he was having
his third affair.

1329
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:46,920
And that's when I set him on fire.

[CROWD LAUGHS]

1331
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,599
Yeah, I did.

1332
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,435
He was just laying there on that couch,

1333
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:03,353
passed out, and I thought, you know,

1334
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:05,522
I've asked him to move the gas cans
in the garage

1335
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,232
at least 87 times.

1336
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:08,608
And I thought, you know, dammit,

1337
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:11,153
I'll move them. You watch me.

1338
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:12,279
I'll do it."

[CROWD LAUGHS]

1340
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,952
And this is why when my friends

1341
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,121
in their 40s and 50s, they get divorced

1342
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,456
and then they'll start dating

1343
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:23,874
and then they'll always
circle back around and go,

1344
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,083
"Goddamn, Kathleen,

1345
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:29,755
I had no idea how many women
out there are crazy."

1346
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:31,673
Well, you know what? That's your fault,

1347
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:35,051
because we have a whole channel devoted

to what we are capable

when the envelope gets pushed

1350
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:41,349

It's not just for women,
but that's the problem.

You guys aren't watching it.
You know who's watching it?

1353
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:49,232
Other women. We're just getting ideas.

1354
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:51,568
I know prison sentences.

1355
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:54,321
I know which states
have the death penalty.

1356
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:57,407
You don't even know how much shit
I know from that show.

1357
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:01,369
And what's really alarming
is my mom loves it, too.

1358
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:04,289
I would say we've probably
both been watching it

1359
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:09,044
for seven years
and I've never seen a repeat.

1360

Oh, yeah [INDISTINCT]

1361
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:16,927
I like that.

1362
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:21,056
And I still watch <i>Tiny House Hunters.</i>

1363
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:22,933
Yeah, the other ones I got bored with.

1364
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,851
But <i>Tiny</i>, I like it because I feel like

1365
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:26,728
if you have never seen it,
it's usually a couple.

1366
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:30,232
And I feel like they're suffering
some sort of clinical nervous breakdown,

1367
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:33,443
but nobody in their family or friends
wanna deal with that shit,

1368
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:35,529
so everyone just encourages them.

[CROWD LAUGHS]

1373
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:48,416
The whole concept is that
the tiny house is 500 square feet or less

1374
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,794
and they'll all want it
to be mobile, okay?

1375
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,504
Because they're gonna tow this shit show

1376
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:54,840
all across North America

1377
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:58,134
and bother every single person
they've ever met on Facebook.

01:08:58,969 --> 01:09:01,221
"Hi, do you care if we live in a yard
for like a year?

We'll be so quiet."

1380
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:06,518
But with this show,
what's alarming is every time

1381
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:09,563
they pull up the couple
to get their tiny house,

1382
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:12,732
they're like in a 2015 Honda Civic.

Well, come on, guys.

1384
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:18,446
You can't pull that with that.

1385
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,116
You can't even pull another Honda

1386
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,951
with that Honda.

1387
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,412
The tiny house you want is $47,000.

1388
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:29,291
The truck you need to pull
that tiny house is $62,000.

1389
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:32,377
So, why don't we take
your dumbasses truck shopping?

1390
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:37,173
And that's why I will never be the host
of <i>Tiny House Hunters</i>

1391
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:38,842
because it would turn into truck shopping,

1392
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:42,512
a show which I would have no interest
in at all anyway,

1393
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:45,599
because as an adult, I don't think
there's anything worse for me.

1394
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,851
Maybe aside from doing taxes

1395
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:50,520
is having to buy a car so much

1396
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:51,730
and I don't care what I drive.

1397
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:56,109

my car was a 2007 Mercury Mariner.

But then it started acting weird.

1402
01:10:04,993 --> 01:10:08,330
I'm like, "Shit, I'm gonna go
have to buy a car."

1403
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:11,041
And my sister, who's my height,
important to this story,

1404
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:13,335
she drives a GMC Acadia. I've driven that.

1405
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:16,004
I'm like, "That'll do.
I'll just go get one of those."

1406
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:19,007
So I called the GMC people.
I go, "I'm coming down there

any more than an hour.

I'll ever buy for all I know."

Scenario A is I've hit it
and it's injured.

I can't be in charge of that.

Scenario B, Dave, is I've hit it
and it's dead.

1476

what are you gonna do?

to turn off my location.

1488
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:40,625
Am I gonna post it on TikTok?

1489
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:43,211
No, because most of my people
are in a hospice

1490
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:48,216
and they don't need to be
bothered with my horseshit.

1491
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,095
So that's as far as I got, Dave.

1492
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,389
I don't know what I will do yet,

1493
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,099
but I know a lot of stuff I won't do

1494
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:58,893
and that's how you
start a good plan for you."

1495
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:02,021
He just looked at me with his eyes,

1496
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:03,106
they're weird and where he goes,

1497
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:06,609
"So the only thing you care about
is if the seat goes up?

1498
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:08,319
"Yes, Dave."

1499
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:10,029
[LAUGHTER]

1500
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,073
All right, you guys.
I got to get out of here.

1501
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:14,159
{\an8}Thank you so much, Denver.

1502
01:14:14,242 --> 01:14:15,785
{\an8}You're always the best.

1503
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:16,703
{\an8}Thank you.
