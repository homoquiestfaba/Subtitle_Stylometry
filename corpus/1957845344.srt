No shit.

the fuck flies kites anymore?

kites. Kites are cool.

this, Ben Franklin,

187
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:48,305

a fucking kite?

00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:33,517
(SIGHS) Holy fuck.

209
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:35,853
A good thief and a bad thief.

210
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:37,188
If they were caught, I'd say

211
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:38,722
that makes them both
bad thieves.

212
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:40,491
The bad thief said,

213
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:42,860
"If you are really
the son of God,

214
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,462
"get us down from here
and save us."

215
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:47,498
So why is this guy
called "The bad thief"?

216
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:50,234
Call him "The practical thief
with common fucking sense."

217
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:53,003
Ah. But the good
thief said,

218
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:57,576
"Jesus did no wrong,
whereas we are but thieves."

219
00:10:57,676 --> 00:10:59,843
What the fuck are butt thieves?

220
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:02,713
Uh, well, then
the good thief said,

221
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:05,082
"Jesus, remember me
in your kingdom."

222
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:06,984
And Jesus said
to the good thief,

223
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,753
"Today, you shall be
with me in paradise."

224
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:11,989
And Paradise is a strip club.

225
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,191
It's not a strip club, Randal.

226
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:17,294
It's Heaven.

227
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:19,631
So the moral of your
never ending story is,

228
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,299
even in Heaven, it's
all about who you know.

229
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,802
(INHALES SHARPLY)
The moral of the story

230
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:26,937
is if you didn't go to
Heaven as a guest of Jesus,

231
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:28,205
like the good thief,

232
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:30,107
where did the bad
thief go, Randal?

233
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:32,142
Not that I wanna
prolong your sermon,

234
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:34,646
but how is it blasphemy
to remind a guy

235
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:36,113
he's the son of God?

236
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:37,982
Maybe the bad thief thought

237
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:39,684
Jesus had a <i>Bourne
Identity</i> thing going on,

238
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,018
like Jesus fell off a boat,

239
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,886
hit his head and caught amnesia.

240
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,922
He was born in a manger.

241
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:46,691
Now he's Bourne again.

242
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,127

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,868
you'll jam a vegetable
down his throat.

00:22:30,968 --> 00:22:33,371
The guy's got more cholesterol
in his arteries than blood.

523
00:22:33,503 --> 00:22:35,907
Got it. From now on, I'm
only gonna order him food

524
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:37,507
off the vegan menu at Mooby's.

525
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,343
Him and you.
Me?

526
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:40,645
If you're around his age

527
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:42,445
and eat the same diet
as your friend,

528
00:22:42,545 --> 00:22:44,514
you might wanna get
your heart checked out, too.

529
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:46,317
Will do.

530
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,718
But here's something
I want you to keep

531
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:49,787
an eye out for
as regards to Randal.

532
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:51,055
Okay.

533
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:53,391
Middle-aged men tend to
go through a depression

534
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,092
after they've had
a heart attack.

535
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:57,128
Now your friend might sound
or act differently now because

536
00:22:57,228 --> 00:22:59,697
he's come face to face
with his own mortality.

537
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:02,266
So, for the next few months,

538
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:04,368
do whatever you can do

539
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,437
to help Randal
keep his spirits up.

540
00:23:07,537 --> 00:23:08,739
All right?

541
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,042

wondering if I was gonna die,

576
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,000
I saw the whole movie of

605
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:04,782
now I know I'm living
on borrowed time.

606
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:06,817
So, no more watching movies

607
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:08,786

I get out of here...

I don't know.
To watch movies.

615
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:33,911
I worked in a video
store for 20 years

616
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,213
where I sat around and
watched movies all day, too.

617
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:39,884
So basically, I went
to my own film school.

618
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:42,953
Just because you've seen
every movie ever made,

619
00:26:43,053 --> 00:26:45,156
doesn't mean you can make
any kind of movie at all.

to Quentin Tarantino.

make a movie as good as him,

from trying to get laid.

wanna watch that?

I barely wanna live it.

you knocked the casket over?

Crafty is where you
find all the food on set.

00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:10,267
Besides, I don't want
this movie to be about

693

it to be about me.

00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:18,208
Like, um, like how we
play hockey on the rooftop.

697
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:20,878
I've never seen that done
in a movie or a TV show,

698
00:29:20,978 --> 00:29:23,247
even though it's
just fucking practical.

699
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:24,915
(LAUGHS) Remember that fight

700
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,050
where I hit you in the
face with the bread?

701
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,652
Ooh, that could be a scene.

702
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:29,554
Or the time I spit
water on that old guy?

703
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:31,989
That's, like, the
fucking opening scene.

704
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:33,658
Ooh, I got an idea.

705
00:29:33,758 --> 00:29:35,459
Maybe Jay and Silent
Bob could be characters.

706
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,995
That is the dumbest
idea I've ever heard.

707
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:39,330
DANTE: Well,
you're still gonna have

708
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,898
to get them involved
if you wanna set

709
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:42,433
any of the scenes
in your old video store.

710
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,335
All right. Watch
the register, dawg.

711
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:47,104
We got to go talk to
the Warner Brothers.

712
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:50,841
What the fuck, man?
We heard you died.

713
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:52,711
Almost.
What happened

714
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:54,713
is I was taking a shit
in the high grass

715
00:29:54,813 --> 00:29:55,913
when a rattlesnake came up

716
00:29:56,013 --> 00:29:57,848
and bit me right on the asshole.

717
00:29:57,948 --> 00:29:59,950
But like the good friend he is,

718
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,252
Dante sucked the poison out.

719
00:30:02,353 --> 00:30:05,155
See? It happened
to them, too, man.

720
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:07,057
Well, listen, when we
thought you were dead, man,

721
00:30:07,157 --> 00:30:09,193
I felt really, really bad

722
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:10,829
'cause in all the time
I've been hanging out

723
00:30:10,928 --> 00:30:12,262
in front of this
store and stuff,

724
00:30:12,363 --> 00:30:14,498
I forgot to give you something.

725
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:25,342
<i>Dental School?</i>

726
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:28,946
Me and Veggie Dick
rented that shit in 1994,

727
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:30,447
but we never watched it

728
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:32,950
'cause we didn't have
a VCR. (CHUCKLES)

729
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,152
But now, you can
put it on the shelf

730
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,521
in the video store.
Oh, yeah.

731
00:30:37,622 --> 00:30:40,592
Uh, the video store
closed ten years ago.

732
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:43,762
It did?

733
00:30:43,862 --> 00:30:46,063
This was the video store.

734
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:52,837
Oh, yeah, I'm getting senile

735
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:54,471
and shit right there,
you know? (LAUGHS)

736
00:30:54,572 --> 00:30:57,508
So listen, how much
we owe you for late fees?

737
00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:02,814
(SCOFFS) Uh, well, let's
see, a dollar a day for what,

738
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:06,116
26, 28 years?

739
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:12,222
That's, like,
approximately... $10,220.

740
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:15,426
Oh, didn't rewind.

741
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,063
$10,220 and 50 cents.

742
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,668
You take crypto?

743
00:31:23,768 --> 00:31:25,235
You guys got crypto?

744
00:31:26,905 --> 00:31:28,038
No.

745
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:29,406
If you never watched it,

746
00:31:29,506 --> 00:31:31,241
why was it not rewound? Yeah.

747
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:33,578
Hey, asshole, I said
we didn't have a VCR.

748
00:31:33,678 --> 00:31:36,447
We watched it. We
held it up to the light.

749
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:38,583
(CHUCKLES)
Fucking Luddite.

750
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:40,685
Listen, we'll squash
your giant late fees

751
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:43,855
on the 28-year-old copy
of <i>Dental School</i>

752
00:31:43,954 --> 00:31:45,289
if you let us shoot
a movie in here.

753
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:47,725
Ooh, a pornography movie?

754
00:31:47,826 --> 00:31:50,160
No, it's not a porno movie.

755
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,430
Sex sells, son,
and I'm always buying

That's not a scene, Randal.

00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:39,944
Stop writing it right now.

771
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,545
Thirty-seven cannot go

DANTE: <i>"In Convenience"?</i>

It's the story of my life.

775
00:32:52,924 --> 00:32:54,926
Hundred and sixty-eight
pages full of dick jokes,

776
00:32:55,025 --> 00:32:56,193
set in a convenience store,

777
00:32:56,293 --> 00:32:58,028
written in one night.

778
00:32:58,128 --> 00:32:59,898
Maybe don't tell
people that last part.

779
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:02,533
I thought, you were gonna
call it <i>"Convenience Stories."</i>

780
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:04,936
Yeah, that shit
sounded too precious.

781
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:06,270
What am I, Wes Anderson?

782
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,839
(CHUCKLES) Not based
on this script.

783
00:33:07,939 --> 00:33:09,306
"There is only one return

784
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:11,643
"and it ain't of the
King, it's of the Jedi."

785
00:33:11,743 --> 00:33:13,277
Hmm.
ELIAS: Hey.

786
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:14,779
You said that same
thing about return

787
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:16,547
the day that guy
threw up in Mooby's

788
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:18,282
and you made me
clean it. RANDAL: Yeah.

789
00:33:18,382 --> 00:33:19,617
Everything in the
script is something

790
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:21,019
either me or someone
I know said,

791
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:22,319
I just made up new names.

792
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:23,721
What am I, some kind of writer?

793
00:33:23,821 --> 00:33:25,222
(WHISPERING)
Ah, yes.

794
00:33:25,322 --> 00:33:26,991
Block chain would
like to understand

795
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,293
why the two girls are
into this "Dan-T" character

796
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:31,596
when the Randy
character is much funnier.

797
00:33:31,696 --> 00:33:33,196
Randy has been asking himself

798
00:33:33,297 --> 00:33:34,766
the same question
his whole life.

799
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:36,466
What's wrong with
Dan-T? (SCOFFS)

800
00:33:36,568 --> 00:33:38,803
Read his first scene on page 37.

801
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:40,337
DANTE: Are you
kidding me?

802
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:41,773
I'm in this convenience
store way more than you,

803
00:33:41,873 --> 00:33:43,073
but I don't come into your

804
00:33:43,173 --> 00:33:44,909
convenience store
movie 'til page 37?

805
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:46,945
I had a lot of exposition to do.

806
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:48,478
(SIGHS) "Enter Dan-T.

807
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,049
"A hideous fuckin' chud
of a man." What the fuck?

808
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:53,216
RANDAL: Well,
maybe Dan-T's not you.

809
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:54,619
Do you ever think of that?

810
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:56,921
"Dan-T's hideous
fuckin' chud of a beard

811
00:33:57,021 --> 00:34:00,123
"doesn't suggest Tony Stark
so much as a male crack whore

812
00:34:00,223 --> 00:34:01,859
"who is cosplaying
as Tony Stark."

813
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,995
That's just in the
screen direction.

814
00:34:04,094 --> 00:34:05,630
Nobody actually calls Dan-T

815
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,231
"a hideous fuckin'
chud." To his face.

816
00:34:08,332 --> 00:34:09,433
I can't believe you made me

817
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:11,201
sign a non-disclosure agreement,

818
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,837
only to read that I'm not even

819
00:34:12,937 --> 00:34:14,572
one of the main characters
in the story of your life.

820
00:34:14,672 --> 00:34:16,173
I mean, I knew
I was never the Luke,

821
00:34:16,273 --> 00:34:17,609
but I thought I was
at least the Han.

822
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:19,309
Oh, come on, I'm the Han

823
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:20,444
and the Luke, right? (SCOFFS)

824
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,113
Then who am I, the Chewie?

825
00:34:23,213 --> 00:34:24,816
I think Elias is more
the Chewie, no?

826
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:26,851
Unless this is Empire
then I'm the Lando

827
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:28,318
and he's the Lobot.

828
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:29,721
I'm not even the Lobot?

829
00:34:29,821 --> 00:34:31,221
Which one's Lobot?

830
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:32,389
He's the one with the
headphones who looks like

831
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,658
a dad who's trying to be a DJ.

832
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:35,359
The bald fucker from Be spin

833
00:34:35,459 --> 00:34:36,794
who never says
nothing the whole movie.

834
00:34:36,894 --> 00:34:38,830
Wouldn't that make
Silent Bob the Lobot?

835
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,499
No. Jay and Silent Bob are
clearly the C-3PO and R2-D2.

836
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,368
I mean, they've been
here since the first movie,

837
00:34:44,468 --> 00:34:46,403
which was the last
time they were cool,

838
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,338
but they've been with
the franchise so long

839
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:49,607
they still give them cameos

840
00:34:49,707 --> 00:34:51,174
and put them on the lunchboxes.

841
00:34:51,274 --> 00:34:54,912
So if I'm not Luke,
Han, Chewie, Lando,

842
00:34:55,013 --> 00:34:56,513
the droids or the Lobot,

843
00:34:56,614 --> 00:34:58,315
then who the fuck
am I in your <i>Star Wars,</i>

844
00:34:58,415 --> 00:35:00,317
Princess fucking Leia? No.

845
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:01,786
You're the Dak.

846
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:04,187
Who the fuck is Dak?

847
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:05,723
He's Luke Skywalker's
tail gunner

848
00:35:05,823 --> 00:35:07,491
in the Battle of Hoth.

849
00:35:07,592 --> 00:35:09,060
You know, the guy who's ready

850
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,561
to take on the whole
Empire himself

851
00:35:10,662 --> 00:35:12,195
until the Empire kills
the shit out of him?

852
00:35:12,295 --> 00:35:15,432
(SCOFFS) Did Dak
even get an action figure?

853
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,669
Not in the classic
Kenner line, no.

854
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:19,369
Because?

855
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:21,039
Because he was deemed
unimportant to the story.

856
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:22,573
But that's just bullshit, man.

857
00:35:22,674 --> 00:35:25,910
Without Dak, Luke
could have never...

858
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,814
Like, Dak was the
only guy that's, like, uh...

859
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:33,517
I mean, Dak was plucky
as shit, man, just like you.

860
00:35:33,618 --> 00:35:35,586
Uh, I have a question
about the script.

861
00:35:35,687 --> 00:35:36,954
Great, more fuckin' notes.

862
00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:38,723
Go ahead.
ELIAS: Yes.

863
00:35:38,823 --> 00:35:41,525
Uh, I have a problem with
the Friar Fuck character,

864
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:43,260
who, I believe,
is supposed to be me.

865
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,030
Friar Fuck, uh, loves Jesus,

866
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,433
uh, to what appears to

who saved you

with your boyfriend
Jesus recently,

875
00:36:05,482 --> 00:36:07,384
and clearly you're going
through some couture

876
00:36:07,484 --> 00:36:09,087
and cosmetic stuff
because of it.

877
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:11,022

years of your life,

to an unhealthy degree,

879

I based Friar Fuck on.

He looks like he needs a
piece of butter and bread.

01:11:36,681 --> 01:11:38,282
Ooh, it's cold in here.

Cough cold... Hey!

01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:41,853
All right, look,

1730
01:11:41,953 --> 01:11:44,354
I realize going to Mooby's
might have hit you hard

1731
01:11:44,454 --> 01:11:45,790
but you just take off?

1732

with you, man?

other than yourself for once.

01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:56,701

Okay.

1737
01:11:56,801 --> 01:11:58,468
We're gonna shoot this scene

1738
01:11:58,569 --> 01:12:00,304

the high school newspaper

1739
01:12:00,403 --> 01:12:01,973

1740
01:12:02,073 --> 01:12:04,441

the assignment on that one.

1741
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:06,277

up here shit-faced

we even had a chance to roll,

re-shoot this tomorrow.

dropped dead

01:28:11,609 --> 01:28:15,246
but I'm a Satanist now.

2067
01:28:15,345 --> 01:28:17,849
And while I may be
the devil's concubine,

2068
01:28:18,649 --> 01:28:20,517
I still believe in heaven.

2069
01:28:20,618 --> 01:28:22,620
And because
Mr. Dante

2070
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:25,156
was the best person
that I ever knew,

2071
01:28:25,256 --> 01:28:27,390
I believe he's in
heaven right now,

2072
01:28:28,391 --> 01:28:29,961
just like the good thief.

2073
01:28:32,263 --> 01:28:33,698
Dante's <i>Inferno.</i>

2074
01:28:34,966 --> 01:28:35,967
No.

2075
01:28:36,968 --> 01:28:38,569
Dante's <i>Paradiso!</i>

2076
01:28:39,871 --> 01:28:40,872

I, uh...

2079
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:12,770
I thought a lot about
what to say here today.

2080
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:14,504
I was gonna pull from the eulogy

2081
01:29:14,605 --> 01:29:17,842
that Kirk gave Spock
in <i>The Wrath of Khan,</i>

2082
01:29:17,942 --> 01:29:19,844
but I've always been
more of a <i>Star Wars</i> fan

2083
01:29:19,944 --> 01:29:22,213
so I should say something like,

2084
01:29:22,313 --> 01:29:26,549
"May the Force be with you"
or "This is the Way."

2085
01:29:27,718 --> 01:29:29,387
But I think instead
of quoting a movie,

2086
01:29:29,486 --> 01:29:32,156
I'd like to paraphrase
the departed.

2087
01:29:32,256 --> 01:29:34,592
And by the departed,
I mean Dante Hicks,

2088
01:29:34,692 --> 01:29:37,161
not the Scorsese picture
that was pretty perfect

2242
01:37:40,812 --> 01:37:42,881

<i>Um, all stories emanate</i>

2244
01:37:45,015 --> 01:37:48,118
<i>and flow from that
little building.</i>

2245
01:37:48,218 --> 01:37:51,455
<i>And when I worked there...</i>

2246
01:37:51,556 --> 01:37:54,124
<i>um, I hated it.
I didn't want to be there.</i>

2247
01:37:54,224 --> 01:37:55,426
<i>I didn't wanna work
for somebody else</i>

2248
01:37:55,526 --> 01:37:56,960
<i>and I didn't wanna work there.</i>

2249
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:59,129
<i>And people would come in</i>

2250
01:37:59,229 --> 01:38:00,732
<i>and I'd be like, "Oh, my God,</i>

<i>"I have to actually
wait on people?</i>

<i>"I just wanna watch TV."</i>

2253
01:38:04,669 --> 01:38:06,203
<i>I didn't even wanna work
at the convenience store.</i>

2254
01:38:06,303 --> 01:38:07,739
<i>I tried to get a job
at RST Video.</i>

2255
01:38:07,839 --> 01:38:09,574
<i>There was an ad
in the paper for it.</i>

2256
01:38:09,674 --> 01:38:11,241
<i>I went down
and talked to Mr. Topper.</i>

2257
01:38:11,341 --> 01:38:12,811
<i>He said... He goes,
"I see you have</i>

2258
01:38:12,911 --> 01:38:15,045
<i>"convenience store
experience as well."</i>

2259
01:38:15,145 --> 01:38:17,347
<i>I said, "Yeah, I worked in a
bunch of convenience stores."</i>

2260
01:38:17,448 --> 01:38:19,082
<i>And he goes, "Would
you be willing to work</i>

2261
01:38:19,183 --> 01:38:20,752
<i>"in this convenience
store next door</i>

2262
01:38:20,852 --> 01:38:22,486
<i>"from time to time because
we own that as well?"</i>

2263
01:38:22,587 --> 01:38:24,221
<i>And I was like, "Uh, yeah,
if you need help."</i>

2264
01:38:24,321 --> 01:38:25,657
<i>And, uh, famous last
words because it...</i>

2265
01:38:25,757 --> 01:38:27,324
<i>it was a convenience store job.</i>

2266
01:38:27,424 --> 01:38:29,426

<i>in a video store,
teased with paradise,</i>

2269
01:38:33,665 --> 01:38:37,367
