1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,900
This here is the bounty hunter skit.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,100
He's the bounty and I'm the hunter.

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,500
Hey, can you keep an eye on him
for a second if I'm inside here?

4
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,800
Just relax. Just relax for a minute.
Keep an eye on him? Just for a minute.

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,000
Come on, man,
don't just stand there, come on.

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,900
Hey, hey, hey.

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,700
- Hey, give me a hand? Can you--
- Give me a hand with this clown, huh?

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,300
- Come on.
- Grow up... shut up.

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,700
You got some ID?
You guys got some ID on you?

10
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,100
- Everything's totally in the van, yeah.
- Totally in the van?

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,000
You just can't cuff a man like this,
buddy, you're disturbing the peace.

12
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,200
Oh, I'm sorry. We were...
He's a friend of mine, actually.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,500
Frankly, I don't believe you guys.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,900
You guys look like
a couple of... lunatics or something.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
- Yeah, here he comes.
- How you doing?

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,300
- How you doing? You with these guys?
- Yeah, we're doing a thing for MTV.

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,800
- MTV, what, you got a permit?
- I don't have a permit.

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,300
- You don't have a permit. You got ID?
- I don't have ID on me.

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,700
I can go to the car and get ID.

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,800
I don't believe you guys. You know,
what the hell is this? You come here...

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,500
You can't do this.
Where you guys from, anyways?

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,100
- From Los Angeles.
- You better go back to Los Angeles.

23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,200
For now, you're gonna have to
go down to the station house with me.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,500
Can I find out
where these guys are going?

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,900
They're going downtown. Get in the car.

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,700
Get in the car.

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,400
Fellows, I got some bad news for you.
You're under arrest...

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,300
for impersonating an officer.
That's a felony.

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,500
And you, for disturbing the peace...

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
and I think
there's a possible warrant on you.

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,100
A felony?

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,400
- A felony? No.
- They're gonna take me to gaol.

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,700
I don't know, but it doesn't happen
like this on COPS, huh?

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,800
And, by the way...

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,800
I'm Johnny Knoxville,
welcome to Jackass.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,500
- Shut up!
- You son of a bitch.

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
Mother...

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,900
Mother... you gave me a heart attack.

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,800
You... That was so good. Oh, my God.

40
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,500
This is the Abe Lincoln
beard of leeches.

41
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,300
Hey, hey, get them, get them.

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,100
Will you get them off my crotch?

43
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,400
Should I lay down?

44
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,800
I might have an Abe Lincoln
mole of meeches. Leeches, I mean.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Four score and seven years ago
our fathers founded...

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,100
upon this continent, a new nation...

47
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,100
conceived of liberty,
and dedicated to the proposition...

48
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,500
that all men are created equal.

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,900
We are now in a...

50
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,200
We are now engaged in a civil war...

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,800
to test whether this nation,
or any nation so conceived...

52
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,800
and dedicated can long endure.

53
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,500
One's in my mouth!

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,600
Liberate.

55
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Penetrate.

56
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,900
And, boy, can I...
He's in my ear, get him out of my ear!

57
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Yeah, I think you left off at "penetrate."

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,900
They won't.

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,200
Oh, sick!

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
That was a hairball of leeches.

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,600
This is my new contraption.

62
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,700
And it's gonna work.

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,500
This is ice barrel jumping.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,300
One barrel, crap.
It's like we're amateurs or something.

65
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,400
I can do four.
Three is my unlucky number.

66
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,300
- All right.
- You... got it! Let's go.

67
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,000
Did you hurt your unit?

68
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,100
I hurt my nuts.

69
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,400
I know you guys want me to eat...
but that's not gonna happen.

70
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,900
It's not gonna happen.

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,900
Holy...

72
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,700
That's all I was waiting for.

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,900
That's what I needed to see,
I didn't care about the makes.

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Who cares about the makes?
I wanna see people eating crap.

75
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville,
and this is my father, Phil.

76
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,700
And today we're gonna watch
my nephew Dusty pass wind.

77
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
Drop my pants now?

78
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
- Yeah, drop them.
- Okay.

79
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,500
- Mike him up good.
- I'll mike him up good.

80
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,000
- Oh, Lord, what...
- God.

81
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,200
I think I got the wrong angle here.

82
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,500
Maybe you need to duct tape
some of that hair off your ass.

83
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,200
Oh, he already started.

84
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,700
Oh, God.
Wait, wait, not yet, don't start yet.

85
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Put it closer in there.

86
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,600
Is that all you got?

87
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,400
No. I mean, it's like I'm about to crap
and it's not coming.

88
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,600
Well, if you got to, you got to.

89
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,800
- How's the view from back there, Rob?
- The view's great.

90
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,400
I've been to three world's fairs
and four goat- screwings...

91
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,200
and I ain't never seen nothing like that.

92
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,100
Hey, Mum, come here for a second.

93
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,000
- Mum!
- I can't.

94
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,600
- Come here for one second.
- I can't.

95
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,900
- Oh, my God, he's crapped on himself.
- Look, it's running down his ass.

96
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,100
He pooed, he pooed his pants.

97
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,700
Good Lord!

98
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
- Is that it for you, Dad?
- That's it for me.

99
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,100
Oh, did you crap on the mike?

100
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,600
Hey, Lynne. Lynne!

101
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
Lynne, you need some...
Get some toilet paper.

102
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,700
Come on, go get it. Come on.

103
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,000
He's your son. He's your son, go get it.

104
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,700
It's right there, I'll show it to you.
I'll show it to you, come on.

105
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,100
There. There it is.

106
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,600
No, no, no!

107
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Please, God. No.

108
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
I don't want it.

109
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,900
Okay, take it towards the bathroom.

110
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,900
Take it towards the bathroom. Go. No!

111
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,100
Who is it?

112
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,400
You wanna see it?

113
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,500
- You wanna see it floating?
- God! Sick.

114
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,400
Don't even think
about touching that camera.

115
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,300
It's gone.

116
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,600
Bottle skating.

117
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,700
It's not a bottle.

118
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,300
When you asked for these,
what'd you ask for? Bottles, right?

119
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
- Bottles.
- I call them bottles.

120
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,900
- That's a bottle?
- Water bottle.

121
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
A bottle's made out of glass.

122
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,700
- I call it a jug.
- It's a jug.

123
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,700
Nice fall. Nice fall.

124
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,200
Did I go a couple?

125
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,400
I hit my knee.

126
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,700
- What you got?
- A little water bottle.

127
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,200
It's not a bottle, it's a jug.

128
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
That was really good.

129
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,100
My job on this show is to be naked,
not kill myself.

130
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,500
This sucks so bad.

131
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,900
I'm so bummed right now.

132
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,700
- I don't wanna do this.
- Does bunny need a hug? Come on.

133
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,300
- Come on.
- Can I have one, too?

134
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
It's okay.

135
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,900
All right. Today, me and Ehren
are riding on this enormous hill...

136
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,200
on this horrible tandem bike
that has no brakes.

137
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,600
We're dead.

138
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,500
Oh, shit!

139
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,900
That's the only bush Ehren's been in,
in months.

140
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Oh, my God!

141
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,000
Holy...

142
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,400
Holy shit.

143
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,600
That was so... up.

144
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,500
Oh, man.

145
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,300
It's there, man. You see it?

146
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,000
Bitch! Oh, God!

147
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,500
Oh, God!

148
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,700
Oh, son of a bitch!

149
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,800
Oh, crap!

150
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh, my God! Why? Why me?

151
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh, son of a bitch!

152
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Oh, God! Excuse me, man.
Excuse me, dude. Oh, God!

153
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,000
Oh, God!

154
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,700
Oh, crap!

155
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,100
Oh, my goodness. Oh, goodie. Oh...

156
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,200
Oh, God!

157
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,000
Damn! Oh, man!

158
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Oh, my God!

159
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,400
Oh, man.

160
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,300
Son of a bitch!

161
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,100
He hit me right in the chin.

162
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,200
I'll see you at the office.

163
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,200
These documents need to be done
on time, let me tell you that.

164
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,500
- I can't believe he's making it.
- He's rocking it out, dude.

165
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,800
Today we're going to a sperm bank
for the first ever Jackass spermathon.

166
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,300
The events for which the contestants
will be judged will be:.

167
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,400
sperm count, potency of the sperm,
volume, and speed.

168
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,600
Let the games begin.

169
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,800
Stephanie will be our nurse today.
She will be transporting...

170
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,800
the samples from the contestant
to another nurse.

171
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,400
Now we're gonna draw the names
to see who goes first.

172
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,100
All right, first...

173
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,100
- Preston.
- I have the pole position...

174
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,900
which probably is an advantage
in this situation.

175
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,900
I'll have to set the pace time.
That might be hard.

176
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,700
I think I can handle it. My dad was a
Marine Corps champion at Parris Island.

177
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,900
Since one of the events today will be
a speed round...

178
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,100
who can deliver the fastest...

179
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,100
Loomis will have a stopwatch,
and he'll time the entrants...

180
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,500
from the point they walk in the door
to the point they walk out of the door.

181
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,600
This is yours.
We'll see you in a few minutes.

182
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,000
- I just need to frisk you first.
- Oh, rock on.

183
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,700
- What's that?
- That's Little P.

184
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,300
All right, you're clean.

185
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,300
You're supposed to put it
through there, fool.

186
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,500
This way.

187
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,600
- Time?
- Five minutes and 50 seconds.

188
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,700
I'm a little nervous 'cause, you know,
I'm with a bunch of dudes...

189
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,400
and, frankly, I don't think I can do it
around these guys.

190
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,000
See you later.

191
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
Did you walk in there erect already?

192
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,500
No, it was kind of hard.
That was more minutes getting it...

193
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,900
- Up.
- ...up than getting it out.

194
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,500
We're at 11 and a half minutes.

195
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,000
I think we're bound to be here all day.

196
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,300
Come on, Kosick, come on.

197
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,700
Where is he?

198
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,400
- Time?
- Damn!

199
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,100
Thirteen minutes, 29 seconds.

200
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,100
I wonder if that's a bad thing
or a good thing in the long run.

201
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,000
Good luck.

202
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,600
Break a leg.

203
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,500
I wonder if they can, like,
smell each other when they go in there.

204
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,400
- Doesn't really look like that much, huh?
- I couldn't get it up.

205
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,400
- I'm tired.
- Johnny "Pisces" Knoxville.

206
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,400
But I got to tell you guys,
I got a secret weapon for speed:

207
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,500
American Grizzly.

208
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,400
- Thank you.
- Put it in the drawer when you're done.

209
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
- Read the instructions, too.
- Read the instructions over the sink.

210
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,900
Paging Dr. Stateman.
Dr. Stateman, please.

211
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,000
Look at you. Gross.

212
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,600
I feel kind of weird being in the same...

213
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,800
Paging Dr. Bender.

214
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,700
I gotta come to terms with my sexuality.

215
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,900
I gotta know what I'm all about.

216
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
It's got hair in it.

217
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,800
How long was that?

218
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,700
- Six minutes, nine seconds.
- Yeah! Oh, I'm in second.

219
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,300
- All right, Wee Man. You ready?
- Yup.

220
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,400
Follow Nurse Stephanie.

221
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,600
- Here I go.
- Have a good time.

222
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,700
And, begin.

223
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,100
I was not even half- cocked.

224
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,700
- Oh, yeah.
- It was like... It's like wet spaghetti.

225
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,300
Yeah, it was terrible, like, what the...

226
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,300
'Cause I could hear
Wee Man giggling outside...

227
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,000
and that wasn't helping anybody.

228
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,400
- Six minutes, three seconds.
- Six minutes, three seconds.

229
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,200
- Not much.
- Not much.

230
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,100
But it's something.

231
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,500
Got dirty stuff in my mind.
I'm ready to go.

232
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
Thank you.

233
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,500
Have you been
shaving your chest lately, Pontius?

234
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,800
Oh, yeah, I did. 'Cause Manny does.

235
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,300
As soon as the door closes,
that's when time goes.

236
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
- I'm gonna get naked.
- Hurry up.

237
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,600
Success!

238
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,700
Every last drop.

239
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,300
Ten minutes, 52 seconds.

240
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,200
It doesn't look like much.

241
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,700
It's up on the sides. It's moving.

242
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,200
- Did I have more than Pontius?
- I think I'm in love.

243
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Oh, yours is, like, chunky.

244
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,400
I'm gonna be so bummed...

245
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
when they announce
my sexually transmitted diseases.

246
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,100
Oh, here comes the doctor
with the results.

247
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,300
Who's Johnny?

248
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,700
- Johnny, that's me.
- You're the last.

249
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,700
- I got the lowest count?
- You're the worst.

250
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Not far behind is Preston.

251
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,500
Who is Chris and Rick?

252
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,300
- It's 118, and Rick... Who's Rick?
- Right here.

253
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,700
You give him this, he's 144.

254
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,100
Rick won!

255
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,200
Rick's got good sperm.

256
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,200
Now he's just got to find someone
to put it in.

257
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
I'm Dave, and this is full- pipe skating.

258
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,300
Going to the airport?

259
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,800
- LAX?
- Yeah.

260
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,500
Can you help me with my other bag?
My back is bad.

261
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,300
Today, I am gonna do
a little snow surfing.

262
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,100
You were so heavy coming down.

263
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,900
Excuse me.

264
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,500
Hi, I'm Steve- O,
and this is the crapper sled.

265
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,100
Here, get into it.

266
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,200
One, two...

267
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,500
What are you doing?

268
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,400
You know, I'm done with this, seriously.

269
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,700
Fine. Pick him up by yourself,
if you're so sick about it.

270
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,800
- You make me sick of it.
- I'm done.

271
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,400
Help me!

272
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,900
Is anybody there?

273
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,900
There we go, there we go.

274
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,900
Squirt him!

275
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,100
Now get in there.
Get in there while Greg's there.

276
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,800
- My face in the pee?
- Yeah, face in the pee.

277
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,500
Careful, guys. Oh, Party Boy.

278
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,800
Oh, Party Boy.

279
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,100
Move him all the way up.

280
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,100
- Hey, buddy.
- I'm just loving this.

281
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,900
Oh, the pee...

282
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,100
It's going way faster.

283
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,900
There you go, there.

284
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,500
Oh, his head's all in the urine!

285
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Yeah!

286
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,200
Oh, that was so perfect.

287
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,900
The dog peed right in there.
That's perfect.

288
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,200
- Stop, please. Come on, don't do this.
- Come on, dude.

289
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,700
- Just give him a kiss. Give him a kiss.
- Just one kiss. Come on.

290
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,700
No!

291
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,400
Come on, dude.

292
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,900
Knock it off!

293
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,300
My tongue slayed his ear.

294
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,400
All right, let's do it. Let's do it!

295
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,000
Brace yourself.

296
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,000
Just stay loose.

297
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,100
- Hey, hey! Get out of here!
- Whoa!

298
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,100
- Get rid of that dog.
- Get him out of here. He's a maniac.

299
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,900
Hi, we're snow tubing.
It's awesome, huh?

300
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,200
- Doggie style.
- Make way.

301
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
- You fit in there?
- I'm Ryan Dunn.

302
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,500
This is a stupid idea, rolling down a hill.

303
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,200
Yes. Let him go.

304
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,800
See you later, buddy. Oh, my God!

305
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,500
What was that?

306
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,100
- Are you all right?
- I told you that was a bad idea.

307
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
You all right?

308
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,300
I told you that was a bad idea.

309
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,200
- Oh, I can't even see.
- You look like--

310
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,100
I didn't even go far.

311
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,500
All right, this is called nutball.

312
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,700
It's a game I used to play
as a young child...

313
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,500
a young boy, frolicking with my friends.

314
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,500
The object is to sit across the room
from one another...

315
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,300
and loft this racquet ball in the air
and whoever can't take getting hit...

316
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,500
in the bull's- eye anymore
would be the loser...

317
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,400
and the other gentleman
being the victor.

318
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,200
Okay, resume play.

319
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,300
That was a bouncer.

320
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
See, I don't have as much dong
to protect me.

321
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,300
I'm all balls.

322
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,600
He got the wiener.

323
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I got a little... one down.

324
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,500
That's a bouncer, though.
That resonates nicely.

325
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,100
I gotta knock out Johnny fast.

326
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,900
I'm the veteran. I'm the crafty veteran.

327
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,900
Hey, let me move over to this side.

328
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,800
I lose.

329
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,400
Hey, nutball's cool with me, dude.

330
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,500
This is to see who has to play
with Steve- O...

331
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,700
throwing the bone across the room...

332
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,500
which weighs, like, four or five pounds.

333
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,300
- Draw another one.
- Let's see what this next one is.

334
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,800
I have absolutely eliminated
every last competitor...

335
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,800
and now I'm drawing from the bowl
to see, once the stakes are high...

336
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,000
who gets annihilated by the bone.

337
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,100
That would be Ehren.

338
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,900
Steve- O's the winner.

339
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,100
Hey, Chris, can you see
the bug on my lens?

340
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,200
- Yeah.
- Why don't you kiss him?

341
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,600
- Eat him up?
- Eat him.

342
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,900
I'm a vegetarian.

343
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,900
- Did you eat him?
- I swallowed him up.

344
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,500
He flew away.

345
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,200
It's so fun.
It's way more fun than snowboarding.

346
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,200
Come on, Kosick, it's one of the
last shows. Just shave your head.

347
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,200
...you, man.

348
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,200
Dude, you look good bald already,
you know that, so...

349
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,800
- You think I should do this?
- Do what?

350
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,600
- Shave my head.
- Of course you should.

351
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,200
Or, you know, you know what he does?

352
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,100
He gets bald and puts the...
And he gets the thing bald.

353
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,900
And he gets a toupee
and he bends over...

354
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,800
and his toupee falls off
in front of people.

355
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,500
There's the skit.

356
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,300
- Let's shoot.
- Okay.

357
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,000
So, we need to start
massaging the scalp.

358
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,600
Sorry.

359
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,900
Hey, Rick, if you want to back out,
that's fine.

360
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,400
Does that hurt?

361
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,700
That's it.

362
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,600
We got to get Kosick a nice toupee.

363
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,500
- Is this right?
- Perfect.

364
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,900
- Doesn't feel like it fits.
- It fits perfect.

365
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,300
Looks like Duran Duran.

366
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,800
Excuse me.

367
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,700
I'm Chef Dave and this is the omelette.

368
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I want everyone not in a HAZMAT suit
back against the wall...

369
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,600
so Dave can make an omelette.

370
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,600
Let's start out with...
How about the onion?

371
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,300
Those are always good
to start the day with.

372
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,800
'Cause there's a lot of vitamins in here,
and of course...

373
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,000
you don't need a knife the way
we're going to cook this omelette today.

374
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,500
All the vegetables were washed
ahead of time to ensure cleanliness.

375
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,800
A little bit of tomato.
Always remove all stickers.

376
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,100
Mushrooms.

377
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,000
Can't go wrong with mushrooms.
They go in any omelette.

378
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,300
If you're going to use real sausage...

379
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,500
you might want to go with
blood- borne sausages. They're the best.

380
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,300
Get them while they're hot.

381
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,800
These are cold, fake sausages.

382
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,000
Get a few different colours for variety.

383
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,800
You want a rainbow in front of you
when it comes time to eat.

384
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,700
Next up, we're going to need
some butter in there.

385
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,900
Lubricates the whole meal.

386
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,800
Not yet.

387
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,500
Milk adds to the fluffiness
of the omelette.

388
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,700
How much cheese you use
matters how much you like cheese.

389
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,700
How much do I like cheese? A lot.

390
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Today we're going to make
a three- egg omelette.

391
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,000
Down the hatch. Bottoms up.

392
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,200
Cooking is such a pleasure.

393
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,700
You know what? That's not going to
make much of an omelette, is it?

394
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,500
I'm going to need an extra one.

395
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,200
There we go.
Get a good shot of that, man.

396
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,600
Yeah.

397
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,900
That's what I call a good- size omelette.

398
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,900
Yes, coming along nicely.

399
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,800
Johnny, can you smell that at all
through that suit there?

400
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It's just completely enticing.

401
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,400
Here, let me take
the final temperature: 160.

402
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,200
See how the milk is just bringing,
it's just giving a fluffy quality to it?

403
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,900
All right, looks like we're about done.
It ended up more of a scramble...

404
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,100
but that's okay. I like scrambles, too.
Omelettes are my favourite, though.

405
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,500
I'm sorry there's not an extra plate...

406
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,300
Johnny, I would have loved
to offer you some.

407
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,500
No. I'm good.

408
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,200
Love to start my day with this.

409
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,700
Would you like some?

410
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,700
All right, that about
wraps up our show this week.

411
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,600
Next week, pizza.

412
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,700
We're going to do
bloody windshield today.

413
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,700
And the windshield
will need to be broken.

414
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,100
That's bad.

415
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,500
I gotta think that's good.

416
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,400
Excuse me,
can you help me clean this off?

417
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,000
We don't car wash.

418
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,100
Oh, dude, there's a cop. One second.

419
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,800
Oh, man, my parole officer
is not going to like this.

420
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,000
Oh, God!

421
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,600
It's a dog?

422
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,800
Yes, yeah. Dog.

423
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,100
My stomach is... up. Please.

424
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,700
Hey, thanks a lot, man.
You really helped me out.

425
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,700
I just hit something.
Can you give me a hand wash?

426
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:29,800
Sure.

427
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I need it quick.

428
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,300
It's very suspicious
that you guys are going to let him...

429
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,100
go through your car wash like that.

430
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,000
Let's go, andale, andale.

431
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,600
Let's go. I gotta go.

432
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,800
You gotta help me, man.

433
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,300
I just need some water
to get this off with.

434
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,100
I had an accident.

435
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,500
That's... I don't know.

436
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,600
- Is this from you?
- No.

437
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,000
Sir?

438
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,300
Dude, they're calling the cops.

439
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,500
Ever since puberty, I've dreamed
of posing for Playgirl magazine.

440
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,800
Today we're taking my vanity shots,
and hopefully I will be accepted.

441
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,900
I'm not gay. I mean some guys think that
just because you're lubing a guy down...

442
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,800
with lotion that you're gay,
but, I mean, it's enhancing his look.

443
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,900
- It makes him look better.
- Let's get this going.

444
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,800
Lay out on the chair like...

445
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,400
- you're getting a suntan.
- Yeah, that's good, that's good.

446
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,400
- Tell him what you want to see--
- I don't know what to do, man.

447
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,200
- I've never photographed a man naked.
- I mean, you've seen girls naked, right?

448
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,000
This is so gross.

449
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,200
Can we get one
with the finger in the mouth?

450
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,000
No, that's good.
Go with it, shoot the pictures.

451
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,100
I'm trying.

452
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,900
Soles of your feet together
and your arms over your head.

453
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,500
We can...

454
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,300
Sorry.

455
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,600
- I want one like this.
- Oh, that's perfect!

456
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,900
Make- up.

457
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,300
This is the sort of thing
that you don't want in a photo shoot.

458
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,300
Like these blemishes, like, I mean,
most of this can be taken care of...

459
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,200
in Photoshop. But this one is
good to just bring it down a little bit.

460
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,300
A lot of the times you get frustrated
with these long make- up jobs.

461
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,500
I think the photographer- subject
relationship is a little tense right now.

462
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,200
Why are you shooting this way?

463
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,800
You really got to get in there
and work it.

464
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,900
Shut up!

465
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,900
- Hold your finger up like it's a gun.
- Full male nudity!

466
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,900
Wrap your legs all the way over and
then put your arm behind your head.

467
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,300
Do we want to get some bunny ears?

468
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,700
I'm lucky to have
such a strong staff behind me...

469
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,900
contributing different ideas for the shot.

470
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,800
Get on your knees, Chris.

471
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,100
Just make love to the camera.

472
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,300
Oh, Rick, you gotta get in there.
Oh, the tree fell down.

473
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,700
- I'm in there, shut up!
- I'm staying right here.

474
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,500
Rick, come on.

475
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,000
The thing is... Sorry, dude.
There we go.

476
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,500
It's okay. It's okay, dudes.
We're shooting for Playgirl.

477
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,400
All right, bye.

478
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,600
Well, I just got off the phone
with Playgirl magazine...

479
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,800
and, apparently,
I'm not what they're looking for.

480
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,800
In my left hand I have some pudding,
in my right hand I have a diaper.

481
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,600
When combined...

482
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,700
I have poo diaper.

483
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,800
Hey, you guys got anything to eat
leftover from lunch?

484
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I didn't even get lunch today.

485
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,900
I'm hungry.

486
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,000
That's a diaper.

487
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,200
So hungry.

488
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,400
That's a diaper, homeboy.

489
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,500
So hungry.

490
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,700
- What are you doing?
- Riding bikes.

491
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,300
Got the condiments.

492
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,700
Oh, you sick...

493
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,500
Mustard. Mike! Help me!

494
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,600
We're back here in Nipomo, California
at the Gary Leffew Bull Riding School...

495
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,900
for the backwards bullride.

496
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,300
...riding this one backwards.

497
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,700
Go on, shorty, go on. Go on!

498
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,300
Come on, shorty, come on.

499
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,000
- It's easy as...
- Ready?

500
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,100
I don't know...

501
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,000
Do you wanna do this?

502
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,100
He didn't seem to like that too much.

503
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,300
It's easier than hell to ride him.

504
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,700
- Is it going to be that bull?
- Yeah, same bull, yeah.

505
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,700
- Not all at once.
- I hope they pay you a lot to do this...

506
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,100
That looked cool.
You can't tell me that didn't look cool.

507
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,600
No, it looked good.

508
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,200
- How far down on the side there?
- Quite a ways, yeah, quite a ways.

509
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,700
- Little bit more.
- Okay, when do I go down?

510
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,200
- Just sit in, just sit down.
- Like that?

511
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,200
Yeah. Just drop down
a little bit at a time.

512
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,900
- We got you.
- Put you hands through the rope first.

513
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,400
Drop your feet down
so he doesn't push you off.

514
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,300
- Drop your feet.
- Drop my feet?

515
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,500
- Straight beside his neck.
- Get a rope through, John.

516
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,600
Both your feet down
and get your foot out of the gate.

517
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,300
- Put it right down in there with him.
- Okay.

518
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,500
- Get ready, buddy.
- Now, all you gotta do is sit back.

519
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,600
Okay, wait.

520
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
- Ready?
- Wait, wait, wait, I'm not ready.

521
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,000
- Ready?
- Wait, get your feet down.

522
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,000
- Okay.
- Drop them all the way down.

523
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,800
- Let's go.
- Hook him, hook him, hook him.

524
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,600
- Hey, that wasn't eight seconds.
- Do it again.

525
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,800
I gotta see the replay on that,
that was cool.

526
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,600
- You rode him perfect.
- Yeah, let's see.

527
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,600
My goods are just bouncing
up and down on his back.

528
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,800
- You look good. Yeah, I gotta see this.
- Oh, my goodness.

529
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,500
So what's in the canister
we're using today?

530
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,300
Well, what we're using is liquid argon.
It's a inert gas.

531
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,600
Not hazardous to people,
but will displace oxygen in the air.

532
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,900
If it displaces oxygen...

533
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,800
are we in any danger inside the car
with it in here?

534
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,600
Well, since you numbnuts
closed all the windows, then...

535
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,100
yes, we are in imminent danger.

536
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,100
- Hi, I'm Rake Yohn.
- I'm Johnny Knoxville.

537
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,300
And this is a chemical spill.

538
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,100
Excuse me, sir.
Can you please stand back?

539
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,800
We got about...

540
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,500
Be cool, we gotta drop it off
at the fourth house.

541
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,600
Don't...

542
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,300
Yeah, we got a problem here. We're
gonna need a clean- up team right away.

543
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,100
We're at a junkyard in downtown LA...

544
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,100
where today that big magnet
is gonna pick me up...

545
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,100
in this suit of armour.

546
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,700
Maybe.

547
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,600
Stop! Stop! Stop!

548
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,600
Nothing went right on this one.
This was like the metallic bread suit.

549
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,300
So, we're back
in another scrap metal yard.

550
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,200
And we constructed a new magnet suit.

551
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,100
And Mr. England here
is going to try it out.

552
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,800
I'm Steve- O. I'm gonna go secure the
streets of Albuquerque, New Mexico.

553
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,400
Everything okay here, sir?

554
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,500
This isn't really the place to stand,
right here.

555
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,700
Right.
Can I get you to move it over a little bit?

556
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,900
- Sure.
- All right.

557
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:50,300
- I've never been told anything before...
- Don't worry, you're not in trouble yet.

558
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,700
Just want to move you over a little bit.

559
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,500
- How you doing there?
- How you doing?

560
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,000
- Alan. Right on.
- Are you...

561
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,400
Hey, no. I'm Final Frontier.

562
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,100
What's with Powell? Is that Powell?

563
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,700
No, Polowski.

564
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,700
- What's your first name?
- Sergio.

565
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,600
Sergio, okay. Okay.

566
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,100
I'm pretty sure
that I'm here to relieve you.

567
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,400
See, he ain't supposed to be here.

568
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,900
Man, you're not supposed
to be here till 5:00.

569
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,900
I'm not supposed to be...
This guy's not supposed to be here.

570
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,600
- Who ain't supposed to be here?
- God.

571
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,700
- What's your name there?
- Johnny.

572
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,300
Johnny? Right on. I'm Sergio.

573
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,500
I'm supposed to ride around with you
and you're gonna train me for a while.

574
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,900
So, I don't know, if you wanna
just do a couple of laps.

575
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,800
So they told you
I was going to train you?

576
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,900
Yeah.

577
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
- This is my first day.
- First day?

578
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,700
They've already got you training
on your first day? God!

579
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,900
- Good Lord.
- Yeah.

580
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,600
Here, why don't we get me
in there driving now.

581
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,700
Yeah, I just want to learn
as much as I can.

582
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,800
All right, let's rock and roll.

583
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,000
- How's it to handle these speed bumps?
- It doesn't handle the bumps...

584
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,500
- very well.
- Oh, man.

585
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,700
You got to be real careful
with this thing, okay?

586
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,500
Oh, yeah.
No, I don't want to get us in trouble.

587
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,900
- Don't go on the sidewalks.
- Okay.

588
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,200
Johnny, I'm all done, man, for the day.
Thanks a lot, man. I appreciate it, dude.

589
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,600
- No problem at all.
- Well, I'll be seeing you tomorrow.

590
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,900
- Okay.
- Cool.

591
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,800
That was awesome, dude.

592
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,000
This is Steve- O
and this is Dave England...

593
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,600
and this is ice block skating.

594
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,100
You know who's the best at this?

595
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,300
- I am.
- Hey, try it again.

596
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,000
Don't touch him, step on him.

597
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,400
Phil gets off work in 15 minutes...

598
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,400
and I have 20 paint balls up in this bitch.

599
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,100
And he's gonna... die.

600
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,200
Oh, my God!

601
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,800
That... hurt.

602
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,400
Phil, I'm going to take it out on you now.

603
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,300
I just got a shot in the foot.

604
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,300
Phil, I got shot in the foot.

605
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,700
I was just testing it out. It felt like this.

606
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,700
Today, Jack Polick and I are doing
the bloody carpet.

607
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,700
We have a bloody mess here...

608
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,500
and we're having a carpet cleaner
come over...

609
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,900
and see if he'll clean it up for us.

610
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,000
Yeah, come on in.

611
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:24,400
We got this big spot over here. I don't
know if it's gonna come out or what.

612
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,600
What is it?

613
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,100
My roommate Steve. His dog,
I think, is in heat or something.

614
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,700
You'll be able to get it out, won't you?

615
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,600
We can try it, we can try our best.

616
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:44,100
Honestly, before I even do anything, we
really have to make a note, because...

617
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,500
I'm going to have the hand...

618
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,900
It looks more real from this side.

619
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,000
Hi.

620
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
...is it?

621
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,500
- Jack, can I talk to you downstairs?
- Yeah.

622
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,600
Excuse us.

623
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,700
You know, it's funny. Couple of days...

624
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,300
Couple of days ago,
I was watching Discovery Channel...

625
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,700
and you know this guy...

626
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,300
that killed a lot of people
and put them in the fridge.

627
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,100
Sorry, I'm not telling this happened
here, but I'm just telling...

628
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,900
- Yeah.
- ...dude.

629
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,400
- Please, I'm taking care of it.
- You do not want it here.

630
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,400
I got pepper spray, I got pepper spray
here! I got pepper spray.

631
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:43,900
You did it.

632
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,500
It's okay. He's all right, he's all right.
Just go upstairs.

633
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,800
Let's just...

634
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:51,500
Just get up there.

635
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,300
You know, I've got to call my boss, man.
You know, this situation here...

636
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,000
I know, it's all right.
Let's just get this done.

637
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:59,100
He'll stay out there.

638
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,900
What do you mean when you say,
"You did it"?

639
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,400
- What was that?
- What?

640
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,700
- What you mean when you say--
- I mean, his dog, or... You know.

641
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,500
It's his dog.

642
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,000
- Jack, what's going on?
- What?

643
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,800
- What's going on, Jack?
- Nothing, it's all right.

644
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,500
- Do you see that... cleaning guy?
- What? Yeah.

645
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,500
Quiet, will you?

646
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,200
- You're not taking care of...
- ...taking care of it.

647
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,200
- You're not taking care of...
- Shut up.

648
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,400
I don't care whose mess it is,
get him out.

649
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,700
Or you're next.

650
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,600
- Yeah.
- Okay.

651
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,000
I need to call my boss.
This situation, I need to report it back--

652
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:38,300
- No, no, no, it's okay, man.
- Let him go, Jack.

653
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,600
- Just let him... business.
- One sec, we're--

654
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,700
- He'll keep it to himself.
- Here, I'll help you out.

655
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,800
Hey, listen, turkey, this isn't...

656
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,300
- It's okay.
- I'm going to leave a voice mail to you--

657
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,400
It's all right. It's okay.

658
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,700
You don't...
No, you don't have to call in.

659
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,300
What the...
Come on, why is he still here?

660
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,700
Dude, what did I just say?

661
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,300
I think it's best if you just go.

662
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,800
Just go ahead.

663
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,300
Get out. Get out, man.

664
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,500
- Just go.
- Where's the money?

665
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,000
I'll pay you right now. How much is it?

666
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,000
If you know what's good for you,
you'll keep this to yourself.

667
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,100
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville
and this is Dotty Barnett.

668
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,400
And today I am 90 years old.

669
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,500
Look at her tush, mama.

670
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,100
- No, don't you talk like that.
- You've got a lovely tush, ma'am.

671
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,200
- Thank you.
- That's not nice.

672
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,300
You're welcome.

673
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,400
Say, I love... Can I, do you mind?

674
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,600
- What's that?
- I just want a couple of French fries.

675
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,900
- What are you... Don't do that, Irving.
- I want it.

676
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,500
- That's not right.
- Oy vey.

677
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,900
- Go find a place to sit down.
- Oy vey.

678
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,400
That's embarrassing.

679
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,100
- You all right?
- Yeah.

680
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,100
Okay, Irving.

681
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,100
- I'm all right.
- Okay.

682
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,300
- I'm all right.
- All right?

683
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,700
- You don't want an ambulance?
- No, no ambulance. Leave me alone.

684
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,700
I just want some soup.

685
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:46,500
Hi, I'm looking for some sunglasses.
Something very contemporary.

686
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,100
- And handsome.
- Handsome and contemporary.

687
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,600
- And snazzy.
- Snazzy?

688
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,700
Yeah.

689
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:57,400
Are they good in...
Can I look at them in the sunlight?

690
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,500
Sure.

691
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,600
Has that sign always been there?
The...

692
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,100
What sign?

693
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,800
- Can I get the sunglasses back, sir?
- Oh, yeah, I forgot.

694
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,900
Look how pretty she is, Dorothy.

695
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,200
Look how nice her breasts are.

696
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,700
You know, you got to be a dirty old man.

697
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,300
- He's getting worse all the time.
- Dorothy.

698
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,100
Look at that butt.

699
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,200
Nice tush.

700
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,500
Hey, there. How are you?

701
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,800
Could I offer you some weed or pot?
Marijuana?

702
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,800
Here comes that son of a bitch Renaldo.

703
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,300
Where were you when I called you
the other night?

704
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,500
- I don't want to talk to you.
- I called you, you old putz.

705
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:50,700
Oh, no, no, no.

706
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,100
Oh, you little son of a...

707
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,200
Thank you.

708
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,700
He started it.

709
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,500
- Enough.
- He's a bad person.

710
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,000
I know, it's enough.

711
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,300
- He's not a good person.
- Never call me again.

712
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,900
I want my $200.

713
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,300
Oh, my God.

714
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,300
What did you have for dinner, ma'am?

715
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,100
I'm Raab Himself.

716
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,000
This is duck hunting.

717
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,200
He's dead! He's dead!

718
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,700
We killed Quack- Quack.

719
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,500
It went up his butt.

720
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,200
- Oh, my God!
- Let me see, let me see.

721
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,500
- It's right in the middle of the ass.
- Oh, my God.

722
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,300
Where do you get the balls?

723
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,300
Yeah...

724
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,300
Damn it!

725
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:46,900
Thank you.

726
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,600
I want to go right over here.

727
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,800
Damn it.

728
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,900
No, you stay there. I got it.

729
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,100
Thank you. Thank you.

730
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,100
Dorothy.

731
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,900
- Are you okay?
- Dorothy, stand me up.

732
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,800
- You want me to get an ambulance?
- No. No ambulance.

733
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,900
You want me to get you
something to drink?

734
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,900
No.

735
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:38,300
- I'm calling you an ambulance.
- No, I need some shade.

736
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,400
- You sure, you--
- Just stand me up.

737
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,100
- You're sure you're gonna be okay?
- Oh, I'm good.

738
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,300
Oh, man!

739
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,900
I'm Steve- O,
and this is the double back.

740
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,500
- I love you.
- Yes, I love you.

741
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,900
I love you.

742
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,800
So, here we are today, on location...

743
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,600
filming Shaquille O'Neal's
new rap video.

744
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,500
- This is...
- Wee Man.

745
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,700
God, that's the gayest way
to introduce people.

746
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,400
All right. You say it all.

747
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,500
The things the Jackass guys do,
I do every day.

748
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:49,400
You can see I'm out here wrestling
with them, I haven't been hurt yet.

749
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,600
I am the man of steel. You see this?

750
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,300
- What was that? That was piss?
- He pissed in that.

751
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,000
Shaq loves Wee Man.

752
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,700
I carry all the weight around this show.

753
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,600
The highlights so far have been
some poo- diving in the kiddie pool...

754
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,200
a lot of Shaq humping Wee Man.

755
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,900
He deserved it though, he's been trying
to hump me and wrestle me all day.

756
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,100
These guys are crazy.

757
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,200
Little kids, do not try this at home.
