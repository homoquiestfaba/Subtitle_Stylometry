1
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:36,174
- Hello?
- Craig? I saw her again.

2
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:38,348
At the beach this time.

3
00:00:38,478 --> 00:00:40,478
- Who?
- Her.

4
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,522
- Her?
- Her her.

5
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:46,783
Oh, the mystery girl. So
you followed her to the beach?

6
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,957
No. She just appeared.

7
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,435
looked over and there she was

8
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:56,304
On her upper lip, there was
this tiny bead of sweat.

9
00:00:56,435 --> 00:01:00,043
It was her only flaw
and I loved her for it.

10
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:02,826
All right. Now what did you do?

11
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:06,522
How did you, Tom McHugh,
take control of the situation?

12
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:10,130
How did you seize the
moment and make it yours?

13
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:12,957
- I waited.
- you waited? For what?

14
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:17,391
For the perfect moment.

15
00:01:17,522 --> 00:01:19,957
For the moment our eyes would meet

16
00:01:20,087 --> 00:01:25,435
and she'd smile at me and there'd be a flash
of unspoken understanding between us.

17
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:29,565
I was waiting for fate.

18
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:35,217
Tell me something, pal.

19
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:37,261
How long does all this take?

20
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:39,696
Hey, don't rush me.

21
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:42,043
When the moment's right, I'll know.

22
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,261
It'll happen. It'll happen.

23
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:51,957
- Did the landscaper come?
- On Wednesday.

24
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:56,348
- Dr Lunsky, Mrs Lunsky.
- Craig, I thought you were in law school.

25
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,087
Tom. Craig's winsome younger brother.

26
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:05,000
- you win some, you lose some!
- Remind me never to let you operate on me.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,522
# If you need a Little lovin'#

28
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:14,304
Suzette, this is my son Tom.

29
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,130
Hi, Tom.

30
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,826
Tom's going to Yale
to study Business.

31
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:22,565
Or I might join the merchant
marines. I haven't decided.

32
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:28,000
# Oh I'll be right here at home

33
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:33,478
# All you gotta do Is pick
up your telephone and dial#

34
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:38,522
I say, take a couple of years,
figure out what to do with your life.

35
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:42,870
Yeah, a young man should follow
his heart wherever it takes him.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,478
Don't let us old coots
dictate what you should do.

37
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:50,652
Of course, as an employer, I have
a bias against hiring slack-offs.

38
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:52,043
# Yeah

39
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:54,391
4-5-7-8-9

40
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:56,174
# Call me on the telephone

41
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:59,000
3-4-5-7-8-9

42
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:02,043
3-4-5

43
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:05,696
As you all know, by
this time tomorrow,

44
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:11,391
Betty and I will be in Connecticut along
with a very special member of our family.

45
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:16,304
For four years, he has competed
amongst the very best of the nation and

46
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:18,609
each time, he's come home a champion.

47
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,348
I know how grateful he is
for your generous support,

48
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:28,087
but I think he could say it more eloquently
than I, so what do you say, champ?

49
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,565
# For he's a jolly good schnauzer

50
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:38,913
# For he's a jolly good schnauzer

51
00:03:39,478 --> 00:03:43,043
# For he's a jolly good schnauzer#

52
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:46,652
# Which nobody can deny

53
00:03:46,783 --> 00:03:49,087
# Which nobody can deny... #

54
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:58,826
# Only child know#

55
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:05,696
Saratoga Longshot?

56
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,391
# But we're never
gonna survive unless#

57
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:15,043
There must be a way to
find out more about her.

58
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,696
# No we're never gonna survive unless

59
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:24,217
# We are a Little

60
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:28,478
# Crazy#

61
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,609
Hello?

62
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:37,826
Hi, Mom.

63
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:40,391
No, no, I canceled.

64
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:45,043
I know he's a doctor,
but he's still boring.

65
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,609
Then you go out with him.

66
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:54,783
I'd rather be by myself.

67
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,826
Hang on a second, I
heard something outside.

68
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,783
Tom, there's a couple of frozen pizzas
in the icebox downstairs

69
00:05:07,913 --> 00:05:10,261
and a fresh case of Bock beer.

70
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:12,522
- Keep your damn hands off it.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:16,478
And don't forget about that
list of chores we agreed on.

72
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:18,478
Please, get yourself a nice haircut.

73
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,652
- See you guys when you get back.
- you bet.

74
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:27,826
Buckle up, hon.

75
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,435
Aren't you forgetting something?

76
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,696
Mom, I'm not gonna kiss the dog.

77
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:38,522
Goodbye, dear.

78
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:43,043
"Clean your room,

79
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,870
hang out the clothes,
mow the lawn... "

80
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:15,478
- Craig.
- Hey, buddy!

81
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,696
I thought you were in California.

82
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:21,957
Well, I decided to fly
up and surprise you.

83
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:25,087
No kidding. We haven't
seen you in ages.

84
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:29,696
- you know Mom and Dad took off?
- Yeah. When are they coming back?

85
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:31,565
- Monday night.
- Terrific.

86
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:33,174
This is beautiful.

87
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,043
1959 DeSoto Firesweep.

88
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:41,783
See the way it leans into the
wind. That's the "forward look".

89
00:06:41,913 --> 00:06:47,522
When this baby came out, the
ad said, "Suddenly, it's 1960."

90
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:49,826
Wanna take it for a spin?

91
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,130
- Can I?
- No. but you can pull it into the garage.

92
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:00,087
It's a push-button transmission.

93
00:07:00,217 --> 00:07:02,435
D for drive, R for reverse.

94
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:04,478
Where's the P?

95
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:09,348
No Park. Parking brake.

96
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:33,565
- How did you get it here if you just flew in?
- What?

97
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:36,696
How did you get the
car here from California?

98
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:41,348
Chris Keslin drove it up during
spring break. Grab that bag.

99
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:44,435
Any beer inside? you look
like you could use one.

100
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:49,783
- Yeah, but Dad said...
- "Hands off it!" Forget it. Tell him I drank it.

101
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:52,174
It's good to see you, Craig.

102
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:59,391
I see you've been putting
my telescope to good use.

103
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:04,000
Tom, Tom!

104
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,217
Is the telescope inadvertently
pointing at something interesting?

105
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:11,130
Is this the one you told me
about? Your new girlfriend?

106
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:12,739
I'm working on that.

107
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:16,696
Tommy, come here. Come here.

108
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:23,087
I want you to look through
this telescope. Go ahead.

109
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:27,130
It's pointing at a
beautiful woman. Why?

110
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:29,957
Because you pointed it there, huh?

111
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:33,696
Not Mom, not Dad, not
anybody else but you.

112
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:38,087
you know what you want. The hard
part is over. Do something about it.

113
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,391
- I haven't even spoken to her!
- That's all right.

114
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,609
That's all right.

115
00:08:44,652 --> 00:08:46,957
What do you know about this girl?

116
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:49,609
She's house-sitting
for some new neighbors.

117
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:52,652
She reads mystery novels.
She doesn't seem to have a boyfriend.

118
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,304
Oh, Tom, she's waiting for you.

119
00:08:55,435 --> 00:09:00,391
Fine, I'll go over and say,
"Hi, I'm Tom. you don't know me,

120
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:02,783
but I've been spying on you
for a couple of months

121
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:06,826
and I find you very attractive
in a very hormonal way. "

122
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:09,087
Then she'll slap me silly.

123
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:14,522
There are worse things than getting
slapped by a beautiful woman.

124
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:17,913
- Got her phone number?
- I don't even know her name!

125
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:20,609
but you've got her garbage, right?

126
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:29,261
She's got a couple of Gourmet
Lites. Couscous, grapefruit rinds.

127
00:09:29,391 --> 00:09:32,217
you've got to get
this girl some food.

128
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:36,696
Hello!

129
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:40,000
Tom, meet Geena Mathews.

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,087
In July, Geena bought S85-worth
of lingerie at Nordstrom.

131
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:49,783
Very nice. Do you like lingerie, Tommy?

132
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:52,217
I've really only read about it.

133
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:56,391
Let's see. She reads mystery
novels to escape, right?

134
00:09:56,522 --> 00:10:00,652
She dreams of faraway, exotic places.

135
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:02,957
She's into surrealism.

136
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:05,043
She's trapped, Tom.

137
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:10,565
- Bingo.
- She plays bingo?

138
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:15,870
Phone bill. Now we have her phone
number. Let's go rescue her.

139
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:23,391
Craig...

140
00:10:24,913 --> 00:10:27,261
- No, I can't do this!
- Be yourself.

141
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:29,304
- I can't.
- Then be me.

142
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:31,435
No.

143
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,478
Hello?

144
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:35,348
Hello?

145
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:40,043
Hello. Geena? Is this Geena Matthews?

146
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:42,870
Hi. My name is Tom.

147
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:46,609
No, no. Tom McHugh.

148
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:49,870
That's because we've never met.

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,783
I'm a neighbour. I live on Sunnydale.

150
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:57,478
I don't name the streets,
just live on them.

151
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:01,261
Listen, I keep seeing
you everywhere I go.

152
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:04,261
First it was at
Nordstrom, then the beach.

153
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:08,000
Then at that Dali exhibit
over at the museum.

154
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:14,000
I had to call to ask you to please stop
following me around. People are starting to talk.

155
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:16,826
Oh, you know, us.

156
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,565
Listen, Geena, to be
totally honest with you,

157
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:24,478
I'm trying my hardest
to ask you out.

158
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:28,000
It's gonna be a beautiful night.

159
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,522
It's gonna be one of those hot, tropical
nights where anything could happen.

160
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:38,217
I fly back to California tomorrow.

161
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:44,304
Listen, what about this? What
if I come to your house at 07.30?

162
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:48,913
If you don't open the door, I'll
leave, promise. What do you say?

163
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,000
Great. Bye.

164
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:56,957
- We're in.
- I'm not doing this. Call back!

165
00:11:57,043 --> 00:12:02,348
- you just have to show up!
- What if I blow it? This is too spontaneous.

166
00:12:02,478 --> 00:12:07,130
- I need more time.
- Tiger, tiger, come on. Relax.

167
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:11,348
Trust me, you'll be ready.

168
00:12:11,478 --> 00:12:17,304
I want you to remember what Lord Olivier
said about acting, "The key is sincerity. "

169
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:20,304
Once you can fake that,
the rest is easy.

170
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:23,000
George Burns said that.

171
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:31,261
OK, I want you to clean it up.

172
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:33,435
but not too severe.

173
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:36,435
Think... Robert Mitchum.

174
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:38,783
N Out Of he Past

175
00:12:38,913 --> 00:12:41,391
So basically, exactly
like yours. Right?

176
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:43,261
Yeah.

177
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,304
Craig, listen, first
dates don't work for me.

178
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:49,130
I hurry my jokes, I have car trouble.

179
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:54,522
Once I took a bite of pizza, the
hot stuff slid off and burnt me.

180
00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:56,739
Tommy, you're trying too hard.

181
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,913
Let her do the work, huh?

182
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:03,261
What do women like to do more
than anything in the world?

183
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:05,000
Buy shoes?

184
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,783
Talk. They talk. So you listen.

185
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,174
That is the most
important thing about women.

186
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:18,391
They like it when you treat 'em shitty and when you treat 'em well
- they just want your attention.

187
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:25,522
Does it matter that
I have 20-20 vision?

188
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:28,870
- I don't need glasses!
- Hey, neither do I.

189
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,957
If women say they like mature guys,
it means they like men in glasses.

190
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:36,174
It's the only difference.

191
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:49,783
The only problem with glasses is
they fly off when a woman slaps you.

192
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:53,783
Don't flinch, take it like
a man. Come off it smiling.

193
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:56,739
- I don't usually get slapped.
- Really?

194
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,087
Happens to me all the time.

195
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:00,435
Come on.

196
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:04,783
A limo? No way am I showing
up in a stupid limo!

197
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:08,696
Your convertible would be perfect.
I promise I'll be extra careful.

198
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:13,348
you're right. It would be very cool.

199
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:18,000
but I can't. Really, Tom, it's
been giving me trouble lately.

200
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,522
The top stick s, the
exhaust system...

201
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:25,043
Why risk it, huh? I was
hoping to borrow your car.

202
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:28,957
- My car? - Yeah, visit
some of my old hang-outs.

203
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:36,565
Everything at Kory's is terrific.

204
00:14:36,696 --> 00:14:38,609
Except for the wine list.

205
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:42,957
Just wave your hand and say, "A
bottle of your best Champagne. "

206
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:47,609
"A bottle of your best Champagne?"
How am I supposed to afford Champagne?

207
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:50,217
This is brand new.

208
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:54,522
Sign my name so the
signatures match.

209
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:58,000
And I will give you some
extra cash for tipping.

210
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:01,174
Always tip well.

211
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:05,435
but only when your date is watching.

212
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:14,478
Hi. I have a flower delivery
for a Mr, uh... McHugh.

213
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:18,130
you're 20 minutes late... Dwight.

214
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:21,087
I'm sorry, sir. I
misjudged the ride over.

215
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:23,435
I usually take a different route.

216
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:26,522
That is a beautiful car.

217
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,870
Don't make excuses on my time.

218
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:34,391
I have an important date planned this
evening and you've fucked it up.

219
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:37,609
Oh, wow. I said I was sorry.

220
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:40,870
Well, there goes your tip, Dwight.

221
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,130
There goes my tip?

222
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:45,478
I hope you enjoy the flowers.

223
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:49,696
Craig?

224
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:59,043
This is insane.

225
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:04,870
What if she hates me, or
laughs at me? Or pulls a knife?

226
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,478
- Pulls a knife? -
Worst-case scenario.

227
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,609
Roe ax

228
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:13,565
Stick to the plan.
Everything will be fine.

229
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:16,000
Remember, no woman wants to hear,

230
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,217
"What do you want to do?"

231
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:21,609
you have reservations and
directions. Everything's taken care of.

232
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:24,913
- you need to wear this jacket.
- you think so?

233
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:26,696
Yep.

234
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,174
Oh, no, oh, no. Don't do this to me.

235
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:58,348
I'm sorry, man! I'm really late.

236
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:00,217
Hey, come back here!

237
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,957
This is inspiring.
you look almost like me.

238
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:11,304
It's perverse.

239
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:13,478
I gotta get going.

240
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:20,087
My wallet's in here, all right? Hold onto
that. There's cash in there and my ID.

241
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:27,261
- Isn't phoney ID against the law?
- Don't let the law stand in the way of fun.

242
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:30,696
you're gonna make a
great lawyer, Craig.

243
00:17:30,826 --> 00:17:32,913
And you're a good brother.

244
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,783
- Yes?
- Mr McHugh?

245
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,174
About that limousine you ordered...

246
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:06,652
There's been an accident. We can
get you another in a few hours.

247
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:09,348
No, tonight's a special occasion.

248
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,696
Of course, otherwise you
would have rented a Chevette.

249
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:17,304
I'm picking her up in a few minutes!
Now what am I supposed to do?

250
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:32,565
# No one can take this away from me

251
00:18:35,174 --> 00:18:39,043
# The martyrs and madmen
I learned that in school

252
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:41,696
# Will remember my name

253
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:47,522
# Some things are never the same

254
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:27,043
McHugh. Tom McHugh right here.

255
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,957
Hi.

256
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:06,739
- You're Tom?
- I'm Tom.

257
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,130
These are flowers. They're for you.

258
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:14,783
- I'll put them in some water.
- Just the bottom part.

259
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:26,913
Listen, Thanks for the
flowers, they're great.

260
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:29,870
Um... but I wanna ask
you a few questions.

261
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,391
Right, of course. I understand.

262
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,130
Tell me the name of the
last novel you read.

263
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:38,522
Novel?

264
00:20:38,652 --> 00:20:41,043
Yeah, a story book without pictures.

265
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,565
Oh, right, uh...

266
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:47,522
It's just that it was...

267
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:50,174
It was this mystery
novel, Saratoga Longshot

268
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:54,043
Are you kidding? I just read that.

269
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:55,783
Really?

270
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:59,130
OK... what's the capital of Paraguay?

271
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:01,565
Uruguay?

272
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:04,565
No, it's Asuncion. but
nobody ever gets that.

273
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,130
Um... any personal heroes?

274
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,000
...?

275
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:14,957
I always looked up to
my older brother Craig.

276
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:20,870
but that's kinda stupid.

277
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,739
Really?

278
00:21:26,783 --> 00:21:28,565
that's so sweet

279
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:31,826
Most guys say Michael Jordan.

280
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,435
Wait, I'm sitting on something.

281
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:09,565
- This is a cool car.
- Thanks.

282
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:12,739
It's funny what some
guys think is impressive.

283
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,696
- One date showed up in a limo.
- you're kidding?

284
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:21,783
I just think this
is more interesting.

285
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:26,261
- It's a 1959, uh, DeSoto.
- DeSoto?

286
00:22:26,391 --> 00:22:27,435
Yeah.

287
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,609
# Doo-do-do
doo-do-do

288
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:33,217
# Do-do
do-do

289
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:36,217
# Doo-do-do

290
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:39,043
# Do-do-do
doo-do-do

291
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:40,870
Do-do-do

292
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,913
# Doo-do-do
doo-do-do

293
00:22:43,043 --> 00:22:45,000
# Do-do
do-dooo

294
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:49,478
# You're so fine lose my mind

295
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:52,652
# And the world seems to disappear

296
00:22:53,522 --> 00:22:56,565
# All the problems all the fears

297
00:22:56,696 --> 00:22:59,522
Um, by the way, where are we going?

298
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:04,087
It's just up ahead here.
I'm pretty sure, uh...

299
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,130
it's a place called Kory's

300
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:07,739
# Do-doo

301
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,739
# Do-do-do
doo-do-do

302
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,913
Do-do-do

303
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:15,174
# Do-do do-do
do-do-do-do

304
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:17,565
# Say you're mine

305
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:22,261
# And give yourself to
the feelings that you know

306
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:27,348
# I'm needing all that you can give me

307
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:30,696
# All the things that you do so well

308
00:24:03,913 --> 00:24:06,391
Wow! How did you find this place?

309
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:10,696
I don't know. you just
hear about places and then...

310
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,739
you go there.

311
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:16,478
So...

312
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:18,696
uhm...

313
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:22,957
I forgot what I was going to say.

314
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:27,261
It was something really enchanting.

315
00:24:27,435 --> 00:24:32,217
Tom? Maybe we should skip this
first-impression thing. What do you say?

316
00:24:32,348 --> 00:24:37,130
Great idea. I've always thought fourth
impressions were the most important.

317
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:42,478
First dates, people try so
hard, they can't be themselves.

318
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,739
Yeah, I know.

319
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,783
It's almost deceptive really.

320
00:24:46,913 --> 00:24:51,130
I mean, we spend hours making
ourselves look completely different,

321
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:55,000
then we go to some dark place
and can't see each other.

322
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,348
We drink, so we don't know if
the person is interesting,

323
00:24:58,478 --> 00:25:04,000
or seems interesting because they're pretending
to be interested in who we're pretending to be.

324
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,000
Right.

325
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,000
So I guess there's
no getting around it.

326
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:14,000
- We're gonna have to lie to each other.
- Lie to each other?

327
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,304
Until we get to know one another.

328
00:25:16,435 --> 00:25:22,522
OK. Two Cabana Coolers.
I'll put that on your tab.

329
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:25,348
- Tab?
- Yeah.

330
00:25:25,478 --> 00:25:27,957
My tab O K

331
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,696
Thank you.

332
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:44,478
I've wet myself and you'll wanna
call my mother to take me home.

333
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:50,783
Tom, it's all right. If this is the worst
thing that happens all night, we'll live.

334
00:25:50,957 --> 00:25:52,913
I'm gonna be right back.

335
00:25:57,435 --> 00:26:00,087
- Hi. Stella?
- Hi.

336
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:02,783
Do you have a towel?

337
00:26:02,913 --> 00:26:07,391
Well. I see the old McHugh charm
is overflowing this evening.

338
00:26:09,478 --> 00:26:13,609
- Stella!
- Ah, duty calls. I live to serve.

339
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:20,391
- That wasn't Craig McHugh, was it?
- Get in line, honey.

340
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:27,696
It's his car, no mistake.

341
00:26:27,826 --> 00:26:29,913
I'm gonna check it out.

342
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,087
- How are you this evening?
- Beautiful car.

343
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:40,304
Thank you.

344
00:26:53,261 --> 00:26:55,435
Shit!

345
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,130
- So the rat returns to his hole.
- Do we know each other?

346
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:03,174
I wasn't that drunk!

347
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:07,522
How you can live with
yourself, Craig McHugh!

348
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:10,304
I don't... I'm not...

349
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:15,261
Hey, Mr Romeo, I hate dick s like you.

350
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:20,217
- What did he do?
- Forget it. His karma will catch up with him.

351
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:23,522
She's right. When it
does, it'll kick my ass.

352
00:27:29,174 --> 00:27:31,391
Hi. Do you like your drink?

353
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:36,609
- Yeah, it's kind of...
- Could you tell me in the car?

354
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:38,826
What's the big hurry?

355
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:42,130
Um, I ran into some
old school buddies.

356
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:47,261
- They'll bung us all night if we hang around.
- Hey, you clown!

357
00:27:47,391 --> 00:27:49,870
I thought that was a great place.

358
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,696
Yeah, yeah.

359
00:27:51,826 --> 00:27:55,696
- Do you mind if we go someplace else?
- No, it's fine.

360
00:27:55,826 --> 00:27:58,217
Leave the girl here!

361
00:27:58,348 --> 00:28:01,348
These guys, they're... kook s.

362
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,174
Interesting friends.

363
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:11,391
Well, you know,
they're just jealous.

364
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:17,304
I mean, here I am out with a
beautiful Pulitzer Prize winner.

365
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:20,913
Come on, Tom, enough lies, OK?

366
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:25,522
Absolutely. No more lies.

367
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:31,913
What happened to your face? It's red.

368
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:35,217
Oh... Oh, that. It's, uhm...

369
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:39,783
It's an allergic reaction
to pineapple juice.

370
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:44,913
Uh-oh. Are those
your buddies again?

371
00:28:45,043 --> 00:28:48,522
No. He's from the flower
shop near my house.

372
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,391
- Did you screw her yet?
- What?

373
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,217
Get her drunk with my tip money?

374
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:03,174
- What did he say?
- I didn't catch him.

375
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,043
Here!

376
00:29:12,174 --> 00:29:14,391
Bang her with these!

377
00:29:17,565 --> 00:29:19,435
I still can't hear him.

378
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:24,000
Hey, lady! I hope you
don't expect a tip.

379
00:29:24,957 --> 00:29:27,609
Argh!

380
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,652
He was kinda funny, wasn't he?

381
00:29:45,478 --> 00:29:49,696
you're so romantic. Or do you
throw flowers at all your dates?

382
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:51,522
No.

383
00:29:51,652 --> 00:29:55,478
I can't wait to see what
you throw at me next.

384
00:29:57,826 --> 00:29:59,391
I'll be right back.

385
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:15,000
Excuse me?

386
00:30:16,043 --> 00:30:17,739
Is there a washroom?

387
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,739
Nice form.

388
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,174
- Hey, nice car.
- Oh, Thanks.

389
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:33,391
58? No, 59 DeSoto firesweep

390
00:30:33,522 --> 00:30:38,087
- Wow. you look great with it too.
- Thanks.

391
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,087
- Could you do something for me?
- What's that?

392
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:45,217
Just kinda mean-lean
against it there?

393
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:49,348
- What, like this?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's great.

394
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,696
put the other hand right there.

395
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:56,565
- What, like this?
- Perfect!

396
00:30:56,696 --> 00:31:01,739
Don't move an inch. I'm Detective Condon and
I am your arresting officer this evening.

397
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,261
- Is this a joke?
- The joke is over, son.

398
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,652
So you're Craig McHugh, huh?

399
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:15,304
No, I'm not. He's my brother.

400
00:31:15,435 --> 00:31:17,522
Your evil twin brother, right?

401
00:31:17,652 --> 00:31:19,696
No, he's older. An older evil...

402
00:31:19,826 --> 00:31:22,261
My brother is practically a lawyer, OK?

403
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:24,652
you may need one.

404
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,739
That you, Sharpie? It's Condon.

405
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,609
- Did somebody say "condom"?
- Go ahead, make jokes.

406
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:34,000
I got him. I got McHugh.

407
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,261
I said to wait for
backup. What's with you?

408
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:39,478
He's not armed. He's
practically crying.

409
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:43,043
I want you to wait
there. We're on our way.

410
00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:47,043
OK, McHugh, it's time
to hand over the flowerpot.

411
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:53,174
- I got flowers...
- I want it now. I've got no time for this crap.

412
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:56,522
you took the vase.
Where is it? The trunk?

413
00:31:56,652 --> 00:32:01,304
you look in the trunk, take whatever
you want. you got the jack...

414
00:32:16,522 --> 00:32:17,957
Hello?

415
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:20,174
Sir?

416
00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:23,957
Oh, oh...

417
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,783
Come on, come on.

418
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:10,696
Hi. Is everything all right?

419
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,565
you look kinda pale. Are you sure
you're OK?

420
00:33:19,696 --> 00:33:21,870
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

421
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:26,652
Oh, good. Cos I'm having a great time.

422
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,304
you are?

423
00:33:31,783 --> 00:33:33,391
Yeah.

424
00:33:36,652 --> 00:33:41,826
I hate to cut our date short. but
you're going to California tomorrow, right?

425
00:33:43,652 --> 00:33:47,043
Yeah, right. you see,
it's just that...

426
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:53,304
I'm a little worried
about... about my car.

427
00:33:53,435 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm having some car trouble.

428
00:33:57,087 --> 00:33:59,174
I'll go pay, OK?

429
00:34:15,435 --> 00:34:18,609
Did you forget something?
No, it's  OK

430
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,739
- I got it.
- Can I help?

431
00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:38,913
Um...

432
00:34:39,957 --> 00:34:41,739
I had a nosebleed.

433
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,174
That's disgusting!

434
00:34:48,913 --> 00:34:51,217
Keep the change.

435
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:53,304
Do you have a payphone?

436
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:55,826
On the wall.

437
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,913
- Hi, I'm Richard.
- I'm Betty.

438
00:35:05,043 --> 00:35:07,348
And that was Napoleon

439
00:35:07,478 --> 00:35:12,130
We're not home, but leave your name and
number and we'll call you back soon.

440
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,696
Craig, are you there?
Pick up the phone!

441
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,478
Aw, shit!

442
00:35:19,522 --> 00:35:24,304
Listen, I had to borrow your
car. Limo didn't show up.

443
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:26,609
All hell's breaking loose.

444
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,652
I have two dead bodies in the trunk.

445
00:35:30,783 --> 00:35:37,870
I think I should call the police, but I can't
because one of them, I accidentally killed.

446
00:35:39,522 --> 00:35:45,304
I've been slapped, I've been threatened
by goons, attacked by a freaking' florist.

447
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,957
We haven't even ordered appetizers.

448
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:51,783
you said something
about old hang-outs.

449
00:35:51,913 --> 00:35:56,652
Meet me at a place called Club
Voltaire, if you're not already there.

450
00:35:58,565 --> 00:36:01,174
All right, see you there. Bye.

451
00:36:05,478 --> 00:36:07,870
The flowers were great.
Wonder what's next.

452
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,652
Next?

453
00:36:10,783 --> 00:36:13,522
Uh... it's another surprise.

454
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:29,609
Hey! Hey, you shit!

455
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:31,391
Bastard.

456
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:23,826
Hey. Nah...

457
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:37,087
Six months ago, I thought
this place was too yuppie.

458
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:22,696
you know what we do with cop killers in this state, flower boy? yeah?
the lucky ones never see the chair!

459
00:38:22,826 --> 00:38:25,565
you don't look lucky to me!

460
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:29,652
I never saw McHugh until he
stiffed me for the flowers.

461
00:38:29,783 --> 00:38:33,174
And then... he tried
to run me off the road.

462
00:38:33,304 --> 00:38:35,087
- It's the truth!
- Sharpie!

463
00:38:35,217 --> 00:38:37,739
- What?
- I found the kid's boss.

464
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:41,304
- I guess his story check s out.
- Are you sure?

465
00:38:41,435 --> 00:38:44,000
I got the address where
he made the delivery.

466
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,391
Jesus, poor Al never had a chance.

467
00:38:46,522 --> 00:38:48,609
Let's go get that cop killer.

468
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:59,783
- Geena, I'm sorry. I thought my brother might...
- This is incredible!

469
00:38:59,913 --> 00:39:02,304
I thought we were gonna get killed.

470
00:39:02,435 --> 00:39:04,304
The night is still young.

471
00:39:08,174 --> 00:39:10,565
Bottle of your best Champagne.

472
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:15,783
- Anything else?
- That'll be fine.

473
00:39:20,522 --> 00:39:25,348
A couple of Gourmet Lites, couscous...
a bunch of grapefruit rinds.

474
00:39:25,478 --> 00:39:27,609
Don't these people eat anything?

475
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:33,304
Sir? The search
warrant you asked for.

476
00:39:33,435 --> 00:39:35,174
Good boy.

477
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:38,652
Victor? Listen to this.

478
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:45,304
- What have you got?
- Listen to this.

479
00:39:45,435 --> 00:39:48,609
I have two dead bodies in the trunk.

480
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:54,652
I should call the police, but I can't
because one of them I accidentally killed.

481
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:59,261
- If that isn't a confession, what the hell is?
- There's more.

482
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:01,478
you said something
about old hang-outs.

483
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:06,739
Club Voltaire, I'm going to a place
called Club Voltaire. Meet me there, OK?

484
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,957
Two dead bodies?

485
00:40:10,217 --> 00:40:13,609
that voice was creepy
Not an ounce of remorse

486
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:22,174
- Anything else, Mr McHugh?
- No, thanks.

487
00:40:22,304 --> 00:40:24,739
Craig McHugh?

488
00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:29,609
Why? Do I know you? No

489
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,783
but you know my sister.

490
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:38,609
- I don't even look like my brother.
- Yeah, you do.

491
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:42,870
you dress like him too. I thought
you stole this credit card.

492
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,870
you know my brother?
Have you seen him?

493
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:48,957
Upstairs.

494
00:40:49,087 --> 00:40:51,087
Chinese guy.

495
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:02,130
- Tom?
- Your boyfriend says he'll be right back.

496
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:04,565
Why? Where did he go?

497
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,609
Upstairs.

498
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:08,478
To find his brother.

499
00:41:10,522 --> 00:41:12,087
Thanks.

500
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:21,217
Hello? Hello?

501
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,043
Craig?

502
00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:06,217
If you'd like to make a
call, please try again.

503
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,348
For help, dial the operator.

504
00:42:26,174 --> 00:42:28,000
McHugh.

505
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,391
Tom?

506
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:38,261
Tom, is that you?

507
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:41,565
Uh... uh... no.

508
00:42:41,696 --> 00:42:42,913
Are you OK?

509
00:42:43,043 --> 00:42:45,130
Don't... don't come in!

510
00:42:46,174 --> 00:42:48,478
It's a real mess in here.

511
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:51,000
- Um...
- What is going on?

512
00:42:51,174 --> 00:42:53,217
I'm coming in, Tom.

513
00:42:53,348 --> 00:42:55,391
No, no! Hold on.

514
00:42:55,522 --> 00:42:57,652
Tom?

515
00:42:59,174 --> 00:43:01,913
What is this place? What's going on?

516
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:06,826
Are you hungry? Let's
get some Chinese food.

517
00:43:09,696 --> 00:43:12,739
Nervous? I don't think
I'm acting nervous.

518
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,348
you're acting like you have rabies.

519
00:43:15,522 --> 00:43:19,696
Why did you disappear like
that? I mean, that's pretty rude.

520
00:43:19,826 --> 00:43:22,000
you're right. you're
right. I'm sorry.

521
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:27,000
I thought my brother was upstairs,
so I went up there, but he wasn't.

522
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:30,826
Maybe I want to meet your
brother. He's your hero, right?

523
00:43:30,957 --> 00:43:34,739
- Under the circumstances, that's a bad idea.
- What circumstances, Tom?

524
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:37,696
Circumstances beyond my control.

525
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:41,174
What does that mean? I don't
understand what that means.

526
00:43:41,913 --> 00:43:46,130
Geena, I know this is
just another night to you,

527
00:43:47,478 --> 00:43:49,957
but it's really
important to me, all right?

528
00:43:53,391 --> 00:43:55,565
Tom, you're a really nice guy...

529
00:43:55,696 --> 00:44:00,174
Nice, nice. Right. I'm afraid
that's my one and only quality.

530
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,000
- That's not true. you have other qualities.
- I do?

531
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,217
Yeah. you're spontaneous.

532
00:44:06,348 --> 00:44:08,391
And you're sincere.

533
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:12,739
- And you've got great taste.
- That's not me, it's somebody else.

534
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:16,565
I'm just doing that so you won't
ditch me. Besides, you forgot "funny".

535
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:20,000
I mean, I am funny, right?

536
00:44:22,174 --> 00:44:24,217
Yes, you are funny.

537
00:44:32,261 --> 00:44:34,217
Excuse me?

538
00:44:34,348 --> 00:44:35,870
Is this your vehicle?

539
00:44:38,652 --> 00:44:43,304
Uh, yes. Yes, it is. Is
there a problem, Officer?

540
00:44:44,304 --> 00:44:45,609
Yeah.

541
00:44:45,739 --> 00:44:47,304
you're missing a tyre.

542
00:44:49,391 --> 00:44:52,304
Give me the keys, I'll
help with the spare.

543
00:44:53,348 --> 00:44:55,087
No, no, no!

544
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,652
No, uh...

545
00:44:57,783 --> 00:45:00,522
- Wow.
- you can't leave anything around here.

546
00:45:00,652 --> 00:45:03,043
Uh, well...

547
00:45:04,478 --> 00:45:08,391
Why don't you watch this...?
I'm gonna go get the spare.

548
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:11,870
These old jack s get wiggly.

549
00:45:34,391 --> 00:45:36,565
That's a leaky flare.

550
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,391
I'll get this one.
you close that trunk.

551
00:46:03,087 --> 00:46:05,174
Have a nice night.

552
00:46:10,348 --> 00:46:11,913
Stop!

553
00:46:12,043 --> 00:46:13,783
Come here.

554
00:46:20,913 --> 00:46:25,000
I caught you just in
time. Take a look at this.

555
00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:31,870
It's oil, huh?

556
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,304
No.

557
00:46:33,435 --> 00:46:35,261
That ain't oil.

558
00:46:38,478 --> 00:46:41,826
I'd say that was
transmission fluid.

559
00:46:41,957 --> 00:46:46,652
When it gets all red and sticky,
it's time to have it changed.

560
00:46:48,652 --> 00:46:51,478
OK, I'll change it.

561
00:46:55,261 --> 00:46:58,696
- How about some music? Something relaxing?
- Yeah.

562
00:47:00,826 --> 00:47:04,000
- Tom, they took your tapes.
- My tapes?

563
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:10,261
Well, this is relaxing, huh?

564
00:47:10,391 --> 00:47:13,391
Driving in eerie silence.

565
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:25,391
- What was that? Is that a car phone?
- Uh, no, no.

566
00:47:25,522 --> 00:47:30,087
- It sounds like it's coming from the trunk.
- It's...

567
00:47:30,217 --> 00:47:32,174
It's a trunk car phone.

568
00:47:32,304 --> 00:47:35,304
One of these jobbies
you put in the trunk

569
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,217
then it doesn't bother
you while you're driving.

570
00:47:38,304 --> 00:47:40,217
Don't you think you should answer it?

571
00:47:42,913 --> 00:47:45,087
Yeah, I should.

572
00:47:49,304 --> 00:47:52,391
Craig McHugh was here with a date.

573
00:47:52,565 --> 00:47:56,652
He kills a cop, then goes
out and celebrates? What next?

574
00:47:56,783 --> 00:47:59,261
Sir? There's a dead
Chinese man upstairs.

575
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:03,304
McHugh was the last
person to see him alive.

576
00:48:03,435 --> 00:48:05,130
This guy is over the edge.

577
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:10,739
He's a psycho. Who would steal from
the head of the Chinese Tong mafia?

578
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:38,913
There sure aren't many
Chinese people around.

579
00:48:39,043 --> 00:48:41,826
I guess it gets touristy
on Saturday nights.

580
00:48:41,957 --> 00:48:44,783
The Chinese are probably
inside making a living.

581
00:48:44,913 --> 00:48:48,000
Look at this place!
We should go in here.

582
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:52,609
All right. you go in. I'll ask
someone to recommend where to eat.

583
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,783
- OK.
- All right?

584
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,348
Oh, no, no customer use.

585
00:49:22,478 --> 00:49:24,609
I wanted to see you.

586
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:29,783
No, no, no, no! you go away.
Go to Happy Moon piano bar.

587
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:33,130
Find nice boy there.
Nice young man there.

588
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,478
Oh. No, no.

589
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:40,130
My shirt, my shirt. I need
to know what my shirt says.

590
00:49:40,261 --> 00:49:44,478
Oh... It's backwards.

591
00:49:46,826 --> 00:49:48,913
"Look in pot. "

592
00:49:55,478 --> 00:49:59,565
No, no. "Look in pot" is
an old Chinese proverb.

593
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,739
- An old proverb?
- Yeah.

594
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:06,870
It's about a young man. Very poor.

595
00:50:07,957 --> 00:50:11,870
but he inherits a
pot from his uncle.

596
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:14,217
Oh, it's very beautiful.

597
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:19,087
He take pot, he shows it to
neighbour. "Look, look, how beautiful!"

598
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:23,087
He shines it up, he
puts it up on shelf.

599
00:50:23,217 --> 00:50:25,391
He never look s inside.

600
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:31,652
See, he never realizes
inside it's full of gold.

601
00:50:33,348 --> 00:50:39,217
So he starved, never
knowing he is so rich.

602
00:50:40,565 --> 00:50:45,435
you'd have thought it would have
jingled around when he moved it.

603
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:49,696
Proverb! Always look inside a beauty.

604
00:50:49,783 --> 00:50:54,304
Pot is only as good as
what is inside of it.

605
00:50:54,435 --> 00:50:56,391
See?

606
00:50:58,565 --> 00:51:00,435
Thank you.

607
00:51:03,565 --> 00:51:06,652
An adventure is in the air.

608
00:51:06,783 --> 00:51:09,348
Like a wind from a faraway place.

609
00:51:10,174 --> 00:51:15,478
Fortunes made and lost. Men in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

610
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:20,957
Lives changing... all because
your loins led you out tonight.

611
00:51:22,565 --> 00:51:25,652
It was not my loins.
I was curious.

612
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:31,304
In women, curiosity is an urge
that springs from the loins.

613
00:51:31,435 --> 00:51:33,478
Oh, but not in men?

614
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:37,870
In men, everything is an urge
that springs from the loins.

615
00:51:40,087 --> 00:51:43,913
- Geena.
- Ah. Speaking of the devil...

616
00:51:44,043 --> 00:51:49,739
This is the one who needs his fortune
told. Tell me his deepest, darkest secrets.

617
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:01,174
young man, you are an impostor!

618
00:52:02,696 --> 00:52:04,609
Uh...

619
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:07,304
Look at the time! We gotta go.

620
00:52:07,435 --> 00:52:10,565
- How munch do we owe you?
- Sit down.

621
00:52:10,696 --> 00:52:13,130
- It's free.
- Take 20. Keep the change.

622
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:16,913
Beware. Beware of your false self!

623
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,696
Who knows when I would
have found out about you?

624
00:52:32,826 --> 00:52:36,391
Geena, there's something
I've got to tell you.

625
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,522
Mr McHugh, your table is waiting.

626
00:52:46,652 --> 00:52:48,870
We're really not that hungry.

627
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,696
Mr Lew would like you to
be his guests for dinner.

628
00:52:55,304 --> 00:52:57,391
Well, we could eat.

629
00:52:57,522 --> 00:53:02,435
While officials will not call it
a murder spree, two men are dead.

630
00:53:02,565 --> 00:53:05,696
McHugh is believed to be
armed and very dangerous.

631
00:53:07,826 --> 00:53:09,000
Thanks.

632
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:11,957
Boy, am I starving!

633
00:53:13,043 --> 00:53:15,435
We need to get out of here.

634
00:53:15,565 --> 00:53:17,739
Why? you don't like this place?

635
00:53:19,348 --> 00:53:21,087
A bottle of your best...

636
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,435
...Champagne.

637
00:53:24,522 --> 00:53:27,957
Compliments of Mr Lew.

638
00:53:45,913 --> 00:53:48,000
I'd like to propose a toast.

639
00:53:51,217 --> 00:53:53,261
It's not really a toast, I...

640
00:53:53,391 --> 00:53:57,087
Would you promise me another
chance if I blow it tonight?

641
00:53:58,174 --> 00:54:00,261
you're doing fine.

642
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:07,652
- So how do you know Mr Lew?
- I don't.

643
00:54:07,783 --> 00:54:09,739
This is a misunderstanding.

644
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:14,826
He knows my brother. And
I don't think he likes him.

645
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:20,522
And you know how when you don't like
somebody, you don't like their whole family?

646
00:54:23,348 --> 00:54:28,522
What's I'm saying is, I don't think Lew
brought us here to serve us dinner.

647
00:54:35,652 --> 00:54:38,739
Your dinner. Compliments of Mr Lew.

648
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:45,913
It could be dangerous. At the very
least, he won't be a congenial host.

649
00:54:47,522 --> 00:54:50,217
Peking Duck, our house specialty.

650
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:55,391
If you require anything else
- food, drink...

651
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:59,478
...additional companions,

652
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:01,435
anything at all,

653
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:04,043
please, don't hesitate to ask.

654
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,304
Your money is no good here.

655
00:55:07,435 --> 00:55:09,478
Let me put it another way.

656
00:55:10,522 --> 00:55:15,261
I should have said this before,
but I think he wants to kill us.

657
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:18,043
What, with MSG?

658
00:55:18,174 --> 00:55:23,522
I'm not kidding. I'd feel a lot
better if we just got outta here.

659
00:55:23,652 --> 00:55:27,565
Wait, Tom, you said yourself that
this is just some misunderstanding.

660
00:55:27,739 --> 00:55:31,261
Can't you contact your brother
and ask what's going on?

661
00:55:31,391 --> 00:55:33,696
It's what I've been trying to do.

662
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:36,652
Maybe I should try again.

663
00:55:37,826 --> 00:55:39,783
I'll be right back.

664
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:50,826
We'll call you back soon.

665
00:55:50,957 --> 00:55:54,304
Craig, are you there?
Pick up the phone.

666
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,087
All right, listen.

667
00:55:56,217 --> 00:56:00,783
I'm at a restaurant
called Chez Lew in Chinatown.

668
00:56:00,913 --> 00:56:03,391
Get here, OK? Now.

669
00:56:03,522 --> 00:56:05,609
All right...

670
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:07,826
Let's see, maybe he called in.

671
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:19,130
Strange.

672
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:22,130
Call Sharpie. Tell him
we've got his location.

673
00:56:24,522 --> 00:56:26,304
McHugh!

674
00:56:29,565 --> 00:56:35,261
I hope you don't mind, I've taken the liberty
of introducing myself to your lovely companion.

675
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,391
At last, we meet.

676
00:56:38,435 --> 00:56:41,261
you're... different than I imagined.

677
00:56:41,391 --> 00:56:45,043
Thanks. Lew? Mr Lew?

678
00:56:45,174 --> 00:56:47,261
James Lew.

679
00:56:47,391 --> 00:56:49,652
I hope you're enjoying your meal.

680
00:56:49,783 --> 00:56:51,826
May I join you?

681
00:56:51,957 --> 00:56:54,087
Yeah, sure, sure.

682
00:56:55,304 --> 00:57:00,348
Um... This is a really
great place you have, James.

683
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,957
So...

684
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,739
It seems we share many interests.

685
00:57:06,913 --> 00:57:09,174
Beautiful women, exotic cars,

686
00:57:09,304 --> 00:57:13,043
Manchurian vases of
the late 16th century.

687
00:57:14,696 --> 00:57:19,174
Oh, right. I just saw an
article on your collection.

688
00:57:19,304 --> 00:57:21,957
Ah, you read.

689
00:57:22,087 --> 00:57:25,870
Did you know how valuable
some of those vases can be?

690
00:57:27,435 --> 00:57:32,652
Yeah, actually, it's funny because
just today I heard a proverb about vases.

691
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,826
Actually, it's about a pot.

692
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,826
It's about this poor guy who
gets a pot from his uncle...

693
00:57:38,957 --> 00:57:41,174
I know the proverb.

694
00:57:41,304 --> 00:57:44,391
I don't. What's it about?

695
00:57:44,522 --> 00:57:47,696
It basically says always
look inside the pot.

696
00:57:47,826 --> 00:57:49,783
This is just my interpretation,

697
00:57:49,913 --> 00:57:53,957
but shake it up and see
if there's any money in it.

698
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:59,435
Oh, so now it's money you're after.

699
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:03,957
Only yesterday, you were
begging me to spare your life.

700
00:58:07,174 --> 00:58:09,696
And we made a deal, McHugh.

701
00:58:10,739 --> 00:58:12,609
Deal? What's he talking about?

702
00:58:14,348 --> 00:58:20,522
I'm not the guy you made the deal with
I'm not Craig McHugh, he's my brother.

703
00:58:22,304 --> 00:58:25,522
Let me guess. Your
evil twin brother, right?

704
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:34,478
Where is it? Where is my vase?

705
00:58:36,174 --> 00:58:39,957
Listen, McHugh,

706
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:42,522
I've been cutting you a lot of slack.

707
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:49,043
I have not held you accountable for Ho
Wong's "accident" because I like you.

708
00:58:49,174 --> 00:58:53,000
Did you know that he
killed my cousin Ho Wong?

709
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,696
It's our first date. We haven't had
munch time to open up to each other.

710
00:59:00,826 --> 00:59:05,000
He's modest. He told me
it was all in self-defense.

711
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:08,043
Fine, I understand.

712
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:13,565
He was probably sent to
kill you. Come to think of it.

713
00:59:15,087 --> 00:59:19,522
but Mr McHugh, enough is enough.

714
00:59:21,217 --> 00:59:25,043
Don't you realise who
you're dealing with here?

715
00:59:26,478 --> 00:59:31,913
Don't you know that you will
never leave this restaurant alive

716
00:59:32,087 --> 00:59:34,391
unless you return my property?

717
00:59:34,522 --> 00:59:36,304
Tell him you're not Craig.

718
00:59:39,174 --> 00:59:42,000
What the heck is your problem?

719
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:50,261
Hey, hey, everybody,
it's Mr Lew's birthday!

720
00:59:52,304 --> 00:59:55,913
# Happy birthday to you...

721
00:59:56,043 --> 00:59:57,826
It's Mr Lew's birthday!

722
00:59:59,739 --> 01:00:03,739
# Happy birthday to you

723
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:07,783
# Happy birthday to you

724
01:00:09,478 --> 01:00:12,739
# Happy birthday to you

725
01:00:13,348 --> 01:00:16,000
# Happy birthday to you...

726
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:50,435
- What are you doing? The police are here.
- The police will arrest me.

727
01:00:50,565 --> 01:00:52,565
Oh, fine.

728
01:00:52,696 --> 01:00:55,478
They'll arrest me because
they think I'm Craig.

729
01:00:56,652 --> 01:00:58,391
I'm wearing Craig's suit.

730
01:00:59,435 --> 01:01:01,174
- His suit?
- Driving his car.

731
01:01:01,304 --> 01:01:06,652
And I'm paying for things with his credit
card, so everybody think s I'm Craig.

732
01:01:06,783 --> 01:01:08,609
Gee, I wonder why.

733
01:01:09,652 --> 01:01:11,478
Look, just stop the car.

734
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,348
Would you stop the car?

735
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:21,391
We're not going anywhere until you
tell me exactly what's going on.

736
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,435
Where are your witnesses?

737
01:01:25,565 --> 01:01:29,130
McHugh blew in, threw a
party for Lew, then took off.

738
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:35,304
- I didn't know McHugh was a friend of yours.
- I didn't know you wanted to meet him.

739
01:01:35,435 --> 01:01:38,696
We should all get together
and go bowling some time.

740
01:01:38,826 --> 01:01:43,217
All I know is it's something
to do with this vase of Lew's.

741
01:01:43,348 --> 01:01:44,783
I think Craig might...

742
01:01:46,565 --> 01:01:50,739
- I think he stole it.
- All those cops because of a vase?

743
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:53,652
I thought he was at
Stanford studying Law!

744
01:01:53,783 --> 01:01:57,565
Now he's here stealing vases,
he's pissing off girls.

745
01:01:57,696 --> 01:02:02,304
God knows what he was thinking
when he set up this stupid date!

746
01:02:02,435 --> 01:02:04,304
Craig set up this date?

747
01:02:05,348 --> 01:02:08,087
Wait a minute. Craig called me?

748
01:02:16,696 --> 01:02:19,957
I expect most guys
to lie about something.

749
01:02:20,087 --> 01:02:23,565
How munch they bench-press, how
many girls they've slept with.

750
01:02:23,696 --> 01:02:26,435
What they expect out of
a relationship, but...

751
01:02:27,217 --> 01:02:29,652
but you've created an
alternate parallel universe.

752
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,435
Look...

753
01:02:33,565 --> 01:02:37,304
I wanted to call you the
first time I saw you.

754
01:02:39,217 --> 01:02:43,348
but it was too important to screw
up by saying something stupid.

755
01:02:45,913 --> 01:02:49,087
I just wanted to make a
good first impression.

756
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:53,565
Tom, that's the idea. To
cut through all of that.

757
01:02:54,652 --> 01:02:57,304
Find out if there's anything
worthwhile on the inside.

758
01:02:57,435 --> 01:02:59,304
Look in the pot.

759
01:03:00,348 --> 01:03:02,913
- What?
- The proverb, remember?

760
01:03:03,043 --> 01:03:06,043
I found it in the loft
above Club Voltaire.

761
01:03:06,174 --> 01:03:08,565
It was a message for my brother.

762
01:03:09,478 --> 01:03:11,174
A message.

763
01:03:12,739 --> 01:03:15,870
Wait, Tom. you know what
that means, don't you?

764
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,043
Yeah, it's a metaphor.

765
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:22,739
- Beauty is in the inside...
- No, no. It means that

766
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:26,522
that whatever Lew is after
is inside this vase.

767
01:03:26,652 --> 01:03:28,739
Look in the pot, right?

768
01:03:30,826 --> 01:03:33,957
you're right. I've got to find Craig.

769
01:03:36,043 --> 01:03:37,826
Wait! What is this?

770
01:03:42,043 --> 01:03:44,609
- Still no answer.
- I have an idea.

771
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:51,087
When I was in Retail, there was a special number we could
use to verify phone numbers of checks. We can get his address this way

772
01:03:51,217 --> 01:03:52,826
Yes. Um...

773
01:03:52,957 --> 01:03:56,391
5-5-51-8-0-9.
Craig McHugh.

774
01:03:58,826 --> 01:04:03,304
Yeah. 2856 West
Eastwood. Great. Thanks.

775
01:04:04,348 --> 01:04:08,087
So let's go meet your
perfect older brother.

776
01:04:40,435 --> 01:04:45,565
It's McHugh. Tell your boss I've
got his valuable family heirloom.

777
01:04:45,696 --> 01:04:49,348
I stole it back from
the people I sold it to.

778
01:04:49,478 --> 01:04:52,652
It was even easier than
stealing it from you clowns.

779
01:04:52,783 --> 01:04:55,174
I've got an alibi, so no trick s.

780
01:04:58,957 --> 01:05:00,739
Yeah, whatever you say.

781
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:04,130
I'll make the delivery, just
call off your leg-breakers.

782
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:08,739
you wouldn't want me to get
nervous and drop it, would you?

783
01:05:16,783 --> 01:05:18,174
Hello?

784
01:05:19,174 --> 01:05:20,826
Hello?

785
01:05:20,957 --> 01:05:23,609
What a mess.

786
01:05:23,826 --> 01:05:25,913
- Oh, wow!
- Craig!

787
01:05:26,565 --> 01:05:29,609
Whatever's inside that vase
must be pretty valuable, huh?

788
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:30,826
Craig?

789
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,565
Oh, gee, think they missed anything?

790
01:05:36,783 --> 01:05:40,609
you can learn a lot about
a person from their garbage.

791
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:44,043
Yeah, I've heard that.

792
01:05:48,174 --> 01:05:50,261
Here's his phone bill.

793
01:05:53,609 --> 01:05:56,174
He gets his calls
forwarded from California?

794
01:05:58,522 --> 01:06:03,087
Oh, man, I can't believe he's
been here this whole time.

795
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:05,435
Wait, let's think about this, OK?

796
01:06:06,478 --> 01:06:10,783
Whatever it is, it has to fit
inside a vase... Drugs maybe?

797
01:06:10,913 --> 01:06:13,348
The detective said it was evidence.

798
01:06:13,478 --> 01:06:15,391
What detective?

799
01:06:17,783 --> 01:06:18,913
Uh...

800
01:06:19,043 --> 01:06:21,739
At the gas station, there was...

801
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:25,043
this detective came to talk to me.

802
01:06:25,174 --> 01:06:27,391
- He thought I was Craig.
- And?

803
01:06:27,522 --> 01:06:32,435
- He stopped thinking I was Craig.
- Tom! Why can't you be straight with me?

804
01:06:32,565 --> 01:06:38,217
All night, it's been, "By the way, we're
looking for Craig and he might be in trouble. "

805
01:06:38,348 --> 01:06:41,000
And, "For dessert,
they're gonna kill us!"

806
01:06:43,087 --> 01:06:45,826
Listen, in the trunk...

807
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:53,348
...there's the phone...
That was the detective's.

808
01:06:53,478 --> 01:06:56,522
- you stole his phone?
- No, no! He dropped it.

809
01:06:56,652 --> 01:06:59,391
- He dropped it.
- It gets complicated.

810
01:06:59,522 --> 01:07:02,696
- Tom!
- Geena, I can't tell you everything because...

811
01:07:03,739 --> 01:07:05,913
If I did, you'd leave.

812
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,348
Don't bother because
I'm leaving anyway.

813
01:07:10,913 --> 01:07:13,000
Geena... Geena!

814
01:07:21,087 --> 01:07:22,130
What?!

815
01:07:22,261 --> 01:07:23,783
Craig McHugh.

816
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:27,478
- How good to find you in.
- I'm not Craig McHugh.

817
01:07:28,435 --> 01:07:31,522
No, of course not.
you drive his car,

818
01:07:31,696 --> 01:07:36,000
you answer his phone,
but still, you're not him.

819
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:38,391
Listen to me, I'm not Craig McHugh!

820
01:07:39,826 --> 01:07:42,261
Nevertheless, it's
good to find you in.

821
01:07:47,174 --> 01:07:49,261
Geena!

822
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,348
Geena!

823
01:07:55,391 --> 01:07:57,478
Geena!

824
01:07:59,087 --> 01:08:01,130
This is a big mistake!

825
01:08:04,261 --> 01:08:06,565
Ahh!

826
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:08,565
Inside. Move, move!

827
01:08:13,087 --> 01:08:14,696
Now get in the car.

828
01:08:14,826 --> 01:08:17,000
- Stop!
- Get in the car!

829
01:08:23,087 --> 01:08:24,565
Geena!

830
01:08:29,217 --> 01:08:30,913
Tom!

831
01:08:31,043 --> 01:08:33,522
Get up. Get up!

832
01:08:38,261 --> 01:08:41,043
Lew, you don't know
who you're dealing with.

833
01:08:41,174 --> 01:08:46,304
you have until 2am
to return my property.

834
01:08:46,435 --> 01:08:48,130
The pot for the girl.

835
01:08:48,261 --> 01:08:50,348
you know where I live.

836
01:08:51,696 --> 01:08:54,565
Could you just
jog my memory a little?

837
01:08:55,739 --> 01:08:58,609
2am, McHugh.

838
01:08:58,739 --> 01:09:02,478
After that, I can't
guarantee her safety.

839
01:09:52,043 --> 01:09:54,522
# I'm cooling' at a bar

840
01:09:54,652 --> 01:09:56,565
# And I'm looking' for some action

841
01:09:56,696 --> 01:10:00,130
# but like Mick Jagger says,
I can't get no satisfaction

842
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:02,435
# The girls are all around

843
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:04,739
# but none of them wanna get with me

844
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:06,478
# My friends are
fresh, I'm looking' def

845
01:10:06,609 --> 01:10:08,348
# Yo, what's up with L.O.C.?

846
01:10:08,478 --> 01:10:11,435
Do exactly what your
big brother says, huh?

847
01:10:11,565 --> 01:10:13,652
"Stick to the plan, Tiger. "

848
01:10:16,304 --> 01:10:17,957
Asshole!

849
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:29,130
# Funky cold Medina

850
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:37,217
# Funky cold medhna#

851
01:10:40,174 --> 01:10:43,087
Oh, you dick!

852
01:10:43,217 --> 01:10:46,696
- What the hell was that?
- What the hell was what?

853
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:51,043
There's somebody in there.

854
01:10:54,304 --> 01:10:56,043
Want me to tell Sharpie?

855
01:10:56,174 --> 01:11:00,043
Yeah. Tell him we've got McHugh.

856
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:05,957
Oh, man.

857
01:11:36,652 --> 01:11:39,261
Craig, I need that vase now!

858
01:11:41,391 --> 01:11:44,217
Shunt up!

859
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:47,783
I said, "Shunt up!"

860
01:12:04,913 --> 01:12:07,000
Craig!

861
01:12:29,739 --> 01:12:31,522
They took the tapes.

862
01:12:35,957 --> 01:12:41,478
They weren't after the vase. They
were after what was inside the vase.

863
01:12:41,609 --> 01:12:43,696
What was inside the vase...

864
01:12:48,348 --> 01:12:50,435
...was a tape.

865
01:12:56,609 --> 01:13:00,565
Look, Condon, I didn't complain when
you upped your price for protection.

866
01:13:00,739 --> 01:13:04,348
I gave you a bonus when
you took care of Scheski.

867
01:13:04,478 --> 01:13:06,522
Why are my people getting busted?

868
01:13:06,696 --> 01:13:09,130
This anti-drug thing
is getting outta hand.

869
01:13:09,261 --> 01:13:12,739
you gotta show results, Lew.
you want the FBI nosing around?

870
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:18,609
Condon the detective.

871
01:13:43,435 --> 01:13:46,783
All right, McHugh, we
know you're in there.

872
01:13:47,391 --> 01:13:49,783
He's not in there.

873
01:13:55,261 --> 01:13:59,391
Listen up. Wilkins, Jesse!
you guys cover Sleepy Hollow.

874
01:13:59,522 --> 01:14:02,043
Carver, Mitchell, Babbling Brook Way.

875
01:14:02,174 --> 01:14:04,957
Hotchins, Romano, Bonny Meadow Lane!

876
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:07,957
Simpson, Lazy Bunny Hutch!

877
01:14:08,087 --> 01:14:11,130
Don't take chances.
This is a war zone!

878
01:14:46,652 --> 01:14:49,000
# I'm on my way

879
01:14:50,522 --> 01:14:52,435
# I'm on my way

880
01:14:53,652 --> 01:14:56,783
# Your lust hs getting hotter

881
01:15:00,652 --> 01:15:03,261
Oh, damn it!

882
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:15,391
"James Wo Chong Lew. "

883
01:15:34,348 --> 01:15:38,522
What a day! Your boyfriend
has caused me no end of grief.

884
01:15:38,652 --> 01:15:40,739
He's not my boyfriend.

885
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,783
So there is a limit
to McHugh's charm.

886
01:15:44,696 --> 01:15:47,652
Ben, Jerry, go get some ice cream.

887
01:15:47,783 --> 01:15:50,826
Would you like anything?
Food? Something to drink?

888
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:55,609
This is kidnapping. you
could get in a lot of trouble.

889
01:15:56,478 --> 01:15:58,870
I don't want to talk business.

890
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,391
I am tired of business.

891
01:16:06,304 --> 01:16:08,391
Let's try to relax.

892
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:11,696
I can't relax. I'm a prisoner.

893
01:16:13,043 --> 01:16:15,130
Sure you can.

894
01:16:20,565 --> 01:16:22,652
you just need a little help.

895
01:16:32,391 --> 01:16:36,304
Help me! Help!

896
01:16:36,435 --> 01:16:39,522
- Oh.
- Help me.

897
01:16:39,652 --> 01:16:40,783
Hi, Craig.

898
01:16:40,913 --> 01:16:45,217
- Help me!
- Help you? I could help you.

899
01:16:46,261 --> 01:16:48,609
On the other hand, if I don't,

900
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:55,348
all your friends, family and neighbours will
call up and order flowers for your funeral.

901
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:58,130
And I can make a lot of money!

902
01:16:58,261 --> 01:17:01,261
I can make a lot of money on tips...

903
01:17:05,043 --> 01:17:08,565
if I still had my job!

904
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:14,043
you stiffed me for my tip.

905
01:17:16,087 --> 01:17:18,304
Fine, that's OK.

906
01:17:22,391 --> 01:17:26,043
you try to run me off
the road... no problem!

907
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:31,913
I'm a flower boy!

908
01:17:36,043 --> 01:17:38,304
It all comes with the territory.

909
01:17:41,348 --> 01:17:43,304
What's your problem?

910
01:17:43,435 --> 01:17:46,696
What's that? Did you say something?

911
01:17:46,826 --> 01:17:48,087
I can't hear you.

912
01:17:48,217 --> 01:17:50,826
Take that thing out of your mouth.

913
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:52,609
What's your problem?

914
01:17:52,783 --> 01:17:56,913
you're my problem. you're
my problem! you're my...

915
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:17,652
No problem, no problem.

916
01:18:25,304 --> 01:18:28,174
No problem, man. I'm fine.

917
01:18:29,217 --> 01:18:30,913
I'm all right.

918
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:27,957
- What are you gonna do about it?
- I want a divorce!

919
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:37,478
Hi. I've got a flower
delivery for Mr Lew.

920
01:19:37,652 --> 01:19:40,087
Flowers at two in the morning?

921
01:19:40,217 --> 01:19:43,043
Yeah, no kidding. It's
some kind of emergency.

922
01:19:43,174 --> 01:19:45,043
Emergency flowers?

923
01:19:46,087 --> 01:19:48,913
Uh... hey, don't ask me, OK?

924
01:19:49,043 --> 01:19:51,913
I think he wants to
impress some girl.

925
01:19:53,391 --> 01:19:56,522
OK, right, right.

926
01:19:57,565 --> 01:19:59,957
The girl, yeah.

927
01:20:01,304 --> 01:20:03,870
Better get on up there then.

928
01:20:05,348 --> 01:20:06,826
OK.

929
01:20:06,957 --> 01:20:09,130
Thank you.

930
01:20:13,783 --> 01:20:17,000
- Chalk one up for the good guys.
- Find the body?

931
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:20,217
Not yet. but the engineer
swears he hit him.

932
01:20:20,391 --> 01:20:22,435
He found this on the track s.

933
01:20:25,391 --> 01:20:31,043
- Kill a cop, kiss a train. Seems about right.
- Mr Sharpsteen? Be so kind?

934
01:20:31,174 --> 01:20:33,565
Let's see what
Forensics has to say.

935
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,652
- What have you got, Katz?
- Strange ruminations from the trunk.

936
01:20:40,783 --> 01:20:43,652
The Chinese gentleman was one Ho Wong.

937
01:20:43,783 --> 01:20:46,087
A hit man for James Lew.

938
01:20:46,217 --> 01:20:50,609
He was waiting in the trunk to kill
McHugh. Fired a single round...

939
01:20:52,261 --> 01:20:55,304
through the trunk lid here.

940
01:20:56,348 --> 01:20:59,348
Mistakenly felling peace
officer Albert Condon.

941
01:20:59,478 --> 01:21:01,913
Wait a minute, that's got to be wrong.

942
01:21:02,043 --> 01:21:03,696
McHugh killed Al.

943
01:21:03,826 --> 01:21:05,652
Not so, my friend.

944
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:10,043
Ho Wong is our man.
He killed Officer Condon.

945
01:21:10,174 --> 01:21:14,652
Judging by the leak in the exhaust,
I'd say Wong died of asphyxiation.

946
01:21:15,478 --> 01:21:17,783
No, McHugh was no killer.

947
01:21:36,087 --> 01:21:37,652
Hai! Hai!

948
01:21:41,739 --> 01:21:43,957
2.30.

949
01:21:44,087 --> 01:21:46,522
I'd say you were being stood up.

950
01:21:50,957 --> 01:21:53,261
Come on.

951
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:22,391
you wouldn't want them
to come and find me dead.

952
01:22:23,957 --> 01:22:28,348
I don't think you realise how
many friends I have in the police.

953
01:22:28,478 --> 01:22:31,043
Please, sit down.

954
01:22:56,739 --> 01:22:58,609
Hai!

955
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:03,348
Lew, if you do anything to me, you'll
never get that evidence you're after.

956
01:23:05,957 --> 01:23:10,435
Evidence? What evidence
are you talking about?

957
01:23:10,522 --> 01:23:14,435
Oh, I know all about it.
The evidence in the pot.

958
01:23:17,609 --> 01:23:19,652
So McHugh did tell you.

959
01:23:24,043 --> 01:23:26,130
That's too bad.

960
01:23:27,217 --> 01:23:29,913
Yours will be an
honorable death, McHugh.

961
01:23:30,043 --> 01:23:33,783
Hai! This sword has been in
my family for three centuries.

962
01:23:38,174 --> 01:23:40,565
you asshole.

963
01:23:41,304 --> 01:23:45,043
Honor? Shit! I'll kill
you with my bare hands.

964
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:49,870
Ah, Happy Birthday,

965
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,696
McHugh.

966
01:24:02,609 --> 01:24:04,348
What the h...?

967
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:15,217
- Geena!
- Are you all right?

968
01:24:15,348 --> 01:24:17,304
- I'm fine.
- Good.

969
01:24:17,435 --> 01:24:19,652
Damn it, Tom! Or is it Craig?

970
01:24:19,783 --> 01:24:21,870
No, it's Tom.

971
01:24:24,957 --> 01:24:28,739
- You promised me another chance if I blew it.
- You blew it.

972
01:24:31,826 --> 01:24:33,870
Come on!

973
01:24:34,957 --> 01:24:37,000
Hands up, McHugh.

974
01:24:39,304 --> 01:24:41,391
Hand over the tape, Craig.

975
01:24:41,522 --> 01:24:45,609
- Don't. Once he has the tape, he'll kill us.
- I'll kill you anyway!

976
01:24:48,957 --> 01:24:53,000
Do what you want with the window,
just leave the girl alone.

977
01:24:54,957 --> 01:24:58,565
Lew, move and I drop your
precious pot. Lose the gun.

978
01:24:58,696 --> 01:25:01,043
Go ahead!

979
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:05,435
Your boyfriend stole
everything that was valuable.

980
01:25:05,522 --> 01:25:08,913
He had a fence to tell
him which ones to take.

981
01:25:10,783 --> 01:25:12,870
Check the rest of the grounds.

982
01:25:15,304 --> 01:25:17,174
Give me the tape.

983
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:20,913
Give me the tape!

984
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:35,130
Uh-uh-uh.

985
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:38,870
- I don't think so.
- Now who the heck are you?

986
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,652
I'm Craig McHugh.

987
01:25:40,783 --> 01:25:44,261
Stop picking on my brother,
or I drop your heirloom.

988
01:25:44,391 --> 01:25:46,348
We tried that already.

989
01:25:46,478 --> 01:25:49,565
- Please.
- Craig, he doesn't want the vase.

990
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:52,217
- Tom...
- Craig, he doesn't want the vase!

991
01:25:52,391 --> 01:25:55,261
Tom, I know a little more than you.

992
01:25:55,391 --> 01:25:58,957
I set you up as my
alibi... which you fowled up!

993
01:26:01,826 --> 01:26:05,348
- you don't want the vase?
- I have what I want.

994
01:26:06,304 --> 01:26:09,696
If you'll excuse me,
I have to call the police.

995
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:13,565
A thief and his accomplices were
found shot here in self-defense.

996
01:26:13,739 --> 01:26:16,304
- I made copies of that tape.
- What tape?

997
01:26:16,435 --> 01:26:18,043
- you're bluffing.
- I did.

998
01:26:18,174 --> 01:26:21,304
I can prove it. Give me the phone.

999
01:26:22,783 --> 01:26:24,696
15 seconds.

1000
01:26:24,826 --> 01:26:26,565
No funny stuff, McHugh.

1001
01:26:40,783 --> 01:26:42,739
- Hi, I'm Richard.
- I'm Betty.

1002
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:45,957
And that was Napoleon.
We're not home...

1003
01:26:49,696 --> 01:26:54,000
Look, Condon, I didn't complain when
you upped your price for protection.

1004
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:57,391
I gave you a bonus when
you took care of Scheski.

1005
01:26:57,565 --> 01:26:59,565
Why are my people getting busted?

1006
01:26:59,696 --> 01:27:01,826
This anti-drug thing
is getting outta hand.

1007
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,435
We gotta show results. you
want the FBI nosing around?

1008
01:27:05,565 --> 01:27:06,652
Condon.

1009
01:27:06,783 --> 01:27:12,739
Lie low for a few months, then we'll talk
to Sharpie and Doheny and cut a new deal.

1010
01:27:12,826 --> 01:27:17,217
Like I said, if the FBI gets
wind of this, we're all screwed.

1011
01:27:17,348 --> 01:27:21,783
Unbelievable. They're all in on it.

1012
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,391
Don't like that copy? I made more.

1013
01:27:26,522 --> 01:27:32,739
If we don't return safely, I've left
instructions for the tapes to be sent to the FBI.

1014
01:27:34,174 --> 01:27:36,043
No Wa t, wa t, wa t, wa t

1015
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,174
- Great, the police.
- Great, the police.

1016
01:27:46,565 --> 01:27:48,522
Nobody move, nobody gets hurt.

1017
01:27:48,652 --> 01:27:52,870
I'm glad you're here. He was
gonna kill us in cold blood.

1018
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,391
Is that right?

1019
01:27:54,522 --> 01:27:58,826
- We've got evidence that'll put him away for life.
- you found the tape?

1020
01:27:58,957 --> 01:28:01,783
He's got it, but I
have a copy at home.

1021
01:28:01,913 --> 01:28:04,087
Only two? So you were bluffing.

1022
01:28:04,217 --> 01:28:07,652
Kill him. Finish him off
for me! Earn your payoff.

1023
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:11,000
- you're the payoff cops?
- The payoff cops?

1024
01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:13,565
- This isn't fair.
- Shunt up!

1025
01:28:13,696 --> 01:28:17,826
- Who is this guy?
- It's McHugh, you idiot. Kill him!

1026
01:28:17,957 --> 01:28:21,870
- I'm not Craig McHugh!
- He's not Craig McHugh, I am.

1027
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,043
- Positive, he's not Craig McHugh.
- Kill 'em both.

1028
01:28:25,174 --> 01:28:28,304
And the girl. One of
them must be McHugh.

1029
01:28:28,435 --> 01:28:30,522
McHugh's already dead.

1030
01:28:30,652 --> 01:28:33,478
In fact, he died a hero.

1031
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:35,696
One of your pals killed Al.

1032
01:28:35,826 --> 01:28:39,130
Then McHugh killed him.

1033
01:28:39,261 --> 01:28:42,696
Then you, you killed McHugh.

1034
01:28:43,435 --> 01:28:46,565
And now, Lew, I'm gonna kill you.

1035
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:49,261
- Kill me?
- That's what I said!

1036
01:28:49,435 --> 01:28:53,087
you kill for me. I say
who kills who. Kill them.

1037
01:28:53,217 --> 01:28:55,609
And while you're at
it, kill yourself.

1038
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:01,217
They're getting away!

1039
01:29:05,957 --> 01:29:07,565
Freeze!

1040
01:29:12,435 --> 01:29:14,609
Nobody move

1041
01:29:14,739 --> 01:29:17,652
- Drop your weapons. you're under arrest.
- For what?

1042
01:29:17,783 --> 01:29:21,696
Bribery, extortion...

1043
01:29:22,826 --> 01:29:25,739
...and extreme stupidity.

1044
01:29:41,696 --> 01:29:43,435
Hey, why so glum?

1045
01:29:43,522 --> 01:29:46,957
you could thank me for
coming to your rescue.

1046
01:29:47,087 --> 01:29:49,826
Thanks, Craig. Thank
s for everything.

1047
01:29:53,652 --> 01:29:56,739
- What the hell's your problem, Tommy?
- What's my problem?

1048
01:29:56,870 --> 01:30:02,609
I spent my life being compared to my perfect
older brother and you don't even exist.

1049
01:30:02,739 --> 01:30:07,696
you're a lying, thieving, sociopathic
criminal. And I thought you were a lawyer.

1050
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:11,261
Now we're splitting hairs, aren't we?

1051
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:16,739
Get outta here. Take your S200
shoes, your stupid shirt.

1052
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:22,522
I don't want anyone else to mistake me
for the legendary asshole Craig McHugh.

1053
01:30:22,652 --> 01:30:24,652
- you're an ingrate.
- Ingrate?

1054
01:30:24,783 --> 01:30:27,043
you almost got us killed.

1055
01:30:27,174 --> 01:30:30,130
I'm sorry. I guess I screwed up.

1056
01:30:30,261 --> 01:30:33,696
I put a little adventure
into your lives, that's it.

1057
01:30:33,826 --> 01:30:37,826
Go on, go back to your
safe, suburban homes.

1058
01:30:37,957 --> 01:30:41,652
And lock your doors
and watch your MTV.

1059
01:30:42,435 --> 01:30:44,870
but I'll tell you this munch,

1060
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,087
when you're old, sitting on your
wrinkled asses, there'll be one night,

1061
01:30:49,217 --> 01:30:54,304
one date out of your whole boring lives
that you'll remember and it'll be tonight.

1062
01:30:56,304 --> 01:30:58,130
Oh, Tommy?

1063
01:30:58,261 --> 01:31:00,652
Don't tell Mom and Dad, all right?

1064
01:31:27,217 --> 01:31:32,000
I... want my tip,

1065
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:34,043
Craig.

1066
01:31:34,174 --> 01:31:35,913
Hey, no problem...

1067
01:31:38,304 --> 01:31:39,304
...Dwight.

1068
01:32:57,696 --> 01:33:00,261
you're very strange, you know.

1069
01:33:02,609 --> 01:33:05,261
I still don't know a thing about you.

1070
01:33:10,652 --> 01:33:12,435
Good night.

1071
01:33:46,739 --> 01:33:50,652
I have some questions
before I say good night.

1072
01:33:58,087 --> 01:33:59,870
# Doo-do-do
doo-do-do

1073
01:34:00,043 --> 01:34:01,522

1079
01:34:15,087 --> 01:34:17,174
- Hi, I'm Richard.
- I'm Betty.

1080
01:34:17,304 --> 01:34:20,174
And that was Napoleon.

1081
01:34:20,348 --> 01:34:26,043
We're not home, but leave your name and
number and we'll call you back soon.

1082
01:34:26,217 --> 01:34:31,217
- Tom? Napoleon won! He's champion.
- Best dog in the show.

1083
01:34:31,348 --> 01:34:33,870
We'll celebrate when we get back.

1084
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,565
Maybe let you have a beer
Napoleon wants too talk to you

1085
01:34:38,696 --> 01:34:40,739
Here, boy.

1086
01:34:41,261 --> 01:34:44,913
# You're so fine lose my mind

1087
01:34:45,043 --> 01:34:48,130

01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,348

# Girl say you're mine and give
yourself to the feeling that you know

1098
01:35:19,217 --> 01:35:22,217
# I'm needing all that you can give me

1099
01:35:23,043 --> 01:35:26,130
# All the things that you do so well

1100
01:35:26,652 --> 01:35:30,304
# Words are healing sweet anticipation

1101
01:35:30,435 --> 01:35:34,043
# Making spells as the shadows close in

01:35:34,174 --> 01:35:38,261
