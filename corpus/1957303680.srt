1
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:05,733
I'm in a lot of pain.

2
00:00:06,829 --> 00:00:09,658
I never wanted this to happen.

3
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,625
I just want it to stop.

4
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:14,723
Greg, Greg, it'll be okay.

5
00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:16,430
Let's go and get to a doctor.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,620
Let's get outta here.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,750
Come on, come with me.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,042
It'll be okay.

9
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:22,048
I need your blood.

10
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:22,881
Huh?

11
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:24,197
I need your blood!

12
00:00:38,552 --> 00:00:39,335
No!

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,138
- Oh God, no, don't!

14
00:00:48,518 --> 00:00:52,018
I'm sorry!

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,553
I'm so sorry!

16
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,883
- Something in my tooth right here.

17
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,070
If I look familiar,

18
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,800
it's because I am the
older brother of Greg...

19
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,390
Sanders

20
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,510
who...

21
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:39,630
became famous after the video

22
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,100
known as "The Last Five Days"

23
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,453
kinda went viral.

24
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,710
My hands look

25
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,413
big from this angle.

26
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,830
So...

27
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,153
My name is Chuckie.

28
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,610
Chuck,

29
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,773
you can call me Chuck.

30
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,030
I, like many others, lost my
job recently due to the whole

31
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,440
COVID-19

32
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,190
pandemic, so, you know,

33
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,003
there's that.

34
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,340
But after talking to my wife

35
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,290
about some things that
have gone on in my life

36
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,440
I decided that it was time to

37
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,490
resolve or attempt to resolve some issues.

38
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,493
And my family has had a big
one for about 10 years now.

39
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,383
Weird, that's a weird plant.

40
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,283
This is my friend's house.

41
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,220
I'm staying here because...

42
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,280
It's close to...

43
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,640
the house that "The Last Five
Days" video was recorded in.

44
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,170
And the landlord is supposedly selling

45
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,380
the house after all these years

46
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,350
and there's a bunch of boxes and stuff

47
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,400
that the landlord thought maybe
some of it belonged to me,

48
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,910
or not me but my brother

49
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,360
and wanted me to go through
and see if any of it

50
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,760
was worth keeping so I'm gonna...

51
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,303
do that and like, look... at it.

52
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:43,160
Greg, I...

53
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,830
can't promise you that anything
is gonna come from this, but

54
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,340
I always found it odd
that there was never a

55
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,500
definitive answer to what happened

56
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,573
in that video.

57
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,400
So I ordered something...

58
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,273
to help stabilize my videos.

59
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:18,490
See how it works.

60
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,223
This looks like the place.

61
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,117
This thing is like jammed though.

62
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:27,606
Oh!

63
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:30,151
Mother fuck.

64
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:38,398
Ah!
There we go.

65
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:53,993
Let's go.

66
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,953
Someone else here.

67
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:11,521
I don't really like that.

68
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,075
Let's see if this works.

69
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,667
Apparently so.

70
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,713
Hello?

71
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:37,540
Uh, excuse me.

72
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,373
Hello?

73
00:06:38,423 --> 00:06:39,256
- Oh, geez.

74
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,530
You scared the shit outta me there, buddy.

75
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,790
- Oh, I'm sorry, but...

76
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,763
Who are you?

77
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,093
- Detective Sanchez.

78
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,443
You're the brother, aren't you?

79
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,293
- Probably.

80
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,760
Greg, Greg's brother?

81
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,643
Yes.

82
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,783
My name's Chuck.

83
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,890
- You look just like him.

84
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,343
It's just uncanny.

85
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,687
- One of us looks better than the other.

86
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,700
- We tried to get in contact with you

87
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,863
for about a month after the incident.

88
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,013
Even went to the funeral
but you weren't there.

89
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:28,147
- I was in a dark place.

90
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,880
I didn't get along with my family,

91
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,123
especially Greg.

92
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,830
But...

93
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,980
- Yeah.

94
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,471
I'm just here checking the
place out and there's a...

95
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:48,071
There's a special they're
doing on the incident.

96
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:50,360
- A special?

97
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,710
- Yeah.

98
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,100
- Like CNN or something?

99
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,933
- It's kinda like that.

100
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:56,590
It's more like a local
news network, but they...

101
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,050
- Is it okay if I film this

102
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,933
by the way?

103
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,963
- Yeah, sure.

104
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:01,846
That's fine.

105
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,530
Yeah, just...

106
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,723
Great.

107
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:11,280
I'm used to asking other people
if I can film them, not...

108
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,163
- Yeah,

109
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:14,875
I bet.

110
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:17,883
- I guess you guys had that in
common when it came to that.

111
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,120
So anyway...

112
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:25,060
They're set to demolish
this in about two weeks.

113
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,520
It's a shame though.

114
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,600
- They're tearing it down?

115
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,433
- Yeah.

116
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:30,363
- I didn't hear that.

117
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,780
- The owner of the place after

118
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,862
your brother's unfortunate passing...

119
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:42,590
He tried to rent it out to several people.

120
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,883
I guess the news coverage was too much.

121
00:08:45,883 --> 00:08:49,720
And couldn't keep it rented
by anybody for very long.

122
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,433
Everybody that came just
left a bunch of shit here.

123
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,700
- There is a lot of stuff.

124
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,170
Whoa!

125
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,680
Can I have this?

126
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,900
- It's not mine to give.

127
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,673
- Oh.
Well it's mine then.

128
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,820
- Sure, yeah whatever.

129
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,163
- Yeah, I suppose everybody
has seen the tape.

130
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,280
- The owner gave you a key, you said?

131
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,163
- Yeah.

132
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,740
- How long are you...

133
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:31,575
planning on staying in town?

134
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,020
- I don't know.

135
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:37,120
Didn't really

136
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,573
plan the trip that way.

137
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,423
Just kinda however long it takes.

138
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,730
See if I can find out what's going on,

139
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,020
what happened...

140
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,480
- Really could've used your help.

141
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,900
- Oh, I'm no detective.

142
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,150
- After it happened, we
had a lot of questions.

143
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,880
- So...

144
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,520
Did anyone ever look into the,

145
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,743
the fruit or anything?

146
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,560
- Yeah, I mean there was a

147
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,370
little wooden box.

148
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,652
- Yeah.

149
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:18,927
- It's on the video.

150
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,320
I mean, don't get me wrong.

151
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,800
We did all the tests we
possibly could on Greg.

152
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,498
- I mean, thank you for
everything you guys do and...

153
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:27,710
- You know, again, I'm
sorry for your loss.

154
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,870
I don't mean to be so callous

155
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,423
and trying to-

156
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:34,280
- It's been 10 years, I've had...

157
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,426
I've had time.

158
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:38,703
- I had a card to give you.

159
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:42,004
I think it's...

160
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,610
Yeah.

161
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,643
So, if you have any questions or anything

162
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:46,490
or you need anything from me,

163
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,870
please just give me a call.

164
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,703
Okay?

165
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:49,586
- Sure.

166
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,550
- Sorry.
Again.

167
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,100
I don't know what else to say.

168
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,713
I'll get out of your hair.

169
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,383
All right.

170
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,266
- Yep.

171
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:30,545
Damn bird.

172
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,799
What the heck?

173
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,460
Yeah, that looks like it belonged to Greg!

174
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,890
Ooh, looks like it got
used pretty well, too.

175
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,810
Dang, Greg.

176
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,040
How could you afford this?

177
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,873
This backyard is nice.

178
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,093
Like...

179
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,080
You could throw

180
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,720
the best party

181
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,183
ever.

182
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,823
So...

183
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:17,915
This is the spot where
they found Greg's body.

184
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,203
10 years ago.

185
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,263
The tree looks different
than in the... video.

186
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,140
Maybe it's a different tree or...

187
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:17,818
Guess I could take these.

188
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:53,781
What the heck?

189
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,513
Yeah, 'cause that's not creepy.

190
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,550
That's actually really creepy.

191
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,140
It's the only thing in here.

192
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:15,280
No way.

193
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:39,309
This is something.

194
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:47,064
Coming.

195
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:51,987
Hi.

196
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:52,820
- Hi.

197
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,653
- You must be Sarah?

198
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:54,486
- Yeah.

199
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:55,343
- Nice to-

200
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:56,176
- Nice to meet you.

201
00:16:56,226 --> 00:16:57,283
- Come on in.

202
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,043
I'm gonna film this.

203
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:02,300
That's okay, right?

204
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,133
- Yeah.

205
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:04,020
- Okay.

206
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,095
Go ahead and take a seat on the couch.

207
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,010
So I don't want to take
too much of your time.

208
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,260
I just, you know,

209
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,480
wanna talk to you about
living next to my brother

210
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,710
while he was in school.

211
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,780
I know your, your family lived next door.

212
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,613
Right?

213
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:30,660
- Yeah.
We lived next door

214
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,200
when I was probably like 12 or 13

215
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,120
they moved in.

216
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,350
- Okay.

217
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,183
I know they,

218
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,760
they didn't live at
the house for too long.

219
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,790
You know, my brother and his friend were,

220
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,960
were college students renting it.

221
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,770
So they, they didn't have
a whole lot of money.

222
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,033
- Yeah.

223
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:45,960
- I think they were only there for like

224
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,610
a total of like eight or nine months.

225
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,160
- Yeah I remember when they moved in,

226
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,980
my parents were not

227
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,143
too excited to have
college boys next door-

228
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:55,520
- I'm sure college boys, you know...

229
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,050
They're, they're a bit rowdy.

230
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,330
My brother was a little
bit of a rebel, so...

231
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,263
- Yeah.

232
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,313
- What do you remember about,

233
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,250
you know, the night of the...

234
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,300
the incident where they
ended up, you know, they...

235
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,193
They passed away.

236
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:16,493
What do you remember about like that time?

237
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:19,645
- You know, I remember that
night but it was really

238
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,730
the night before that I have a memory of.

239
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,680
- Well you told me over the phone that

240
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,270
you actually might have some information

241
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,090
that hasn't really been
disclosed at this time.

242
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,052
- Yeah.
- Do you mind going into more

243
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:35,680
detail?
- Well...

244
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,020
My family and I had gone
for a walk the night before

245
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,600
they died and I kinda strayed and

246
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,370
went to the park that was near our house

247
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,730
and Greg was at the park,

248
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,630
which wasn't weird.

249
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,230
Like I saw Greg around
the neighborhood but

250
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,203
he was eating sand.

251
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:58,190
- Just...

252
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,830
- Just eating sand.

253
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,501
- Like handfuls?

254
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:05,400
- Like handfuls! Like
aggressively eating sand.

255
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,330
And I was like, I didn't know what...

256
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,020
It startled me.
It scared me.

257
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,420
It was weird and I didn't know what to do

258
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,110
so I just ran back with my family and

259
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,891
I never said anything.

260
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:16,520
- Yeah. That's, that's weird.

261
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,480
That's something that obviously
didn't happen on camera,

262
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,340
you know?
No one...

263
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,330
If he wandered off,

264
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,380
no one would know because on the tape,

265
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,330
that's the night that Brian went and

266
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,540
stayed by himself at a hotel, so

267
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,083
if he wasn't filming it,

268
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,710
no one knows what happened.

269
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,940
So that's, that's interesting.

270
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,680
And it was just at the
playground in your neighborhood?

271
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,513
- Just in our neighborhood park.

272
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,950
- Can we go and look at it?

273
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,768
- Yeah.

274
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:49,434
This is the park.

275
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:50,267
- This is it?

276
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:51,920
- Yeah, I don't remember
that middle part though

277
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,150
so they must have remodeled
since I've been here

278
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,883
'cause it looks a little different.

279
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,279
- Well, it was all those years ago,

280
00:19:58,329 --> 00:19:59,245
so...
- Yeah,

281
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:01,060
it's been 10 years
honestly since I've seen it

282
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,410
and they must've...

283
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,590
They must've replaced
the sand with wood chips

284
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,450
'cause that was not there obviously.

285
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,333
- Yeah.

286
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,830
Interesting.

287
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,663
- Yeah.

288
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:11,950
- So where was Greg

289
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,510
when you saw him that night?

290
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,580
- So I was just walking right on that

291
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,040
sidewalk and Greg was
right here by the swings.

292
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,873
- Just right there?

293
00:20:19,923 --> 00:20:21,180
- Just right here.

294
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,063
- Okay.

295
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:23,877
Would you,

296
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:24,710
would you mind holding this?

297
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,084
- Yeah.

298
00:20:26,134 --> 00:20:27,337
- I'm just gonna take a

299
00:20:27,387 --> 00:20:29,056
little bit of a better look real quick.

300
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:29,939
- Okay.

301
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:50,965
- No, what are you doing?
No!

302
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,280
- I got this email from a
friend of mine who suggested

303
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,520
that I look into this Airbnb...

304
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,830
And the reason is because it

305
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,350
might belong to the Verbin family

306
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,260
or maybe even belonged to Verbin himself.

307
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,170
I don't know if it's the house

308
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,260
referred to in the original video,

309
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,900
but you know I figured
why not look into it?

310
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,240
I have nothing better to do.

311
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,020
Oh geez.

312
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,750
The camera's not on my face.

313
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,653
I'm sorry.

314
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,743
Just making a quick pit stop.

315
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,540
I don't feel like I would
be very good at vlogging.

316
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,653
I don't, I don't ever know what to say.

317
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,136
Like ever.

318
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,112
Sorry!

319
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,063
That is not a bad view.

320
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,450
All right, so I'm...

321
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,800
at Verbin's place.

322
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,010
I guess that's what I'm calling it now?

323
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,523
Or Verbin's vacation rental.

324
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,810
Whatever.

325
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,510
I'm not expecting to find anything

326
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,770
so I brought a little
something to sip on tonight

327
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,383
because I don't want to be bored.

328
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,043
Oh, I love squeaky doors.

329
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,261
Well, yeah, this,

330
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:13,443
this just looks like an Airbnb.

331
00:24:17,615 --> 00:24:19,180
Except for this...

332
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,063
sheet.

333
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,383
That's weird.

334
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,273
Look a mirror.

335
00:24:27,323 --> 00:24:28,930
Hi, me!

336
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,813
Hi, Chuckie.

337
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,596
Is that a hammock?

338
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:44,803
Nice!

339
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,674
Well, I totally know where
I'm sleeping tonight.

340
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:52,086
What the heck?

341
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,383
Oh man.

342
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,813
That was a terrible coincidence.

343
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,150
Let's check out the rest of the place.

344
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,783
Towels, for cleansing the body.

345
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,410
Wonder who she is?

346
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:43,490
Well this bed

347
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,063
looks pretty comfortable.

348
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:48,823
Oh, yeah!

349
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,963
Oh, that felt good after a long drive.

350
00:25:55,981 --> 00:25:57,031
Holy shit.

351
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:09,002
What am I doing?

352
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:13,923
I'm not gonna find anything here.

353
00:26:29,853 --> 00:26:31,936
Well, at least I got you.

354
00:26:34,614 --> 00:26:37,397
This end table is a little far.

355
00:27:02,218 --> 00:27:03,385
Here's to you,

356
00:27:04,721 --> 00:27:05,554
Gregory.

357
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:15,136
Ah.

358
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,663
This is nice.

359
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,891
Yeah.

360
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:29,941
On second thought...

361
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:39,610
Whoop, spilled a little bit.

362
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,493
My bad.

363
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,093
Oh yeah.

364
00:27:56,405 --> 00:27:58,290
Oh, I could get used to this.

365
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:07,430
Oh, geez!

366
00:29:33,843 --> 00:29:34,940
I've always wanted to do this,

367
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,617
but I don't want, like, anyone to see.

368
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:56,518
Woo!

369
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,360
I put the glass down in the rocks

370
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,290
over there.

371
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,465
I just figured I'd drink from the bottle.

372
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:15,925
Oh yeah.

373
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,258
It's gone.

374
00:30:34,829 --> 00:30:36,974
How do I get...

375
00:30:52,372 --> 00:30:53,205
Whoa.

376
00:31:07,551 --> 00:31:10,201
I have to pee.

377
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:15,634
Oh, I have to pee, oh!

378
00:31:28,576 --> 00:31:29,709
Ah!
Gosh.

379
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,133
This place has the same
wine that I brought.

380
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,863
Oh man.

381
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,513
Yeah, Gregory!

382
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,170
Woo!
Brother!

383
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,512
From the same mother!

384
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:27,118
I'm okay!

385
00:32:38,567 --> 00:32:40,303
Not even dark yet.

386
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,193
Where's the stop button?

387
00:32:46,243 --> 00:32:47,760
The stop one...

388
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,163
I'm just gonna take like a quick nap,

389
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,601
like an hour.

390
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:07,560
I'll set my watch and then I'll,

391
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,870
I'll get serious about this.

392
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,757
I promise.

393
00:33:09,807 --> 00:33:11,265
I just...

394
00:33:11,315 --> 00:33:12,630
I need to take a little nap.

395
00:33:16,756 --> 00:33:18,256
Just a little nap.

396
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,783
Well my nap was nice.

397
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,893
I decided to eat something.

398
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,703
That way I had something
else in my stomach.

399
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,603
I brought some of the
fruit from the other house.

400
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,457
It just looks like

401
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,080
any other fruit, smaller obviously,

402
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,713
but something you'd
find at a grocery store.

403
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:57,963
I don't know.

404
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,190
I haven't seen any on this property yet

405
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,683
but I haven't, you know,
really been outside sober.

406
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:13,273
So when I go looking
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

407
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,433
In the meantime.

408
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:19,880
No, I'm not eating that shit.

409
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,080
I'm not doing it.

410
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,023
Not eating it.

411
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,343
Nope.

412
00:34:27,991 --> 00:34:29,600
I'm not eating it.

413
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,483
I'm not.

414
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,173
Period!

415
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:36,430
End of discussion.

416
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,343
I might still be a little drunk.

417
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:43,493
Welcome back to my vlog.

418
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,413
Let me try that again.

419
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:47,296
I can be more...

420
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,413
insightful.

421
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,103
Welcome back to Chuckie's vlog.

422
00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:58,390
Yeah, whatever.

423
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,640
That soup upset my stomach, by the way.

424
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,523
Campbell's.

425
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,180
You know I read somewhere that

426
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,920
engraved images of Buddha is bad luck.

427
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,120
So just, you know, sh!

428
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,193
Don't tell anyone.

429
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,723
No one has to know.

430
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:26,170
There's a lot of various
religious artifacts

431
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,193
and paintings and stuff in this house.

432
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,233
It's kinda weird.

433
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,833
I don't know.

434
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,713
Well, whatever.

435
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:39,910
I'm gonna walk the property
before it gets too dark

436
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,360
and see if I can find anything, so...

437
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:48,974
Hello?

438
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,783
Excuse me.

439
00:35:55,364 --> 00:35:56,531
What the fuck?

440
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,443
Hello?

441
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:24,212
I gotta get some shoes
before I go down there.

442
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,873
Got my gun for safety,

443
00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:41,683
and this really bright flashlight.

444
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:26,159
They're gonna find my body out here.

445
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:28,159
Or actually just not my body, my bones.

446
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,250
There's gonna be nothing left of me.

447
00:38:00,562 --> 00:38:01,395
Hello?

448
00:38:36,171 --> 00:38:37,379
A lot of bugs

449
00:38:40,357 --> 00:38:41,263
out here.

450
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,180
This is a situation
where I don't know if I'm

451
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,203
happy that I'm alone or I'd
rather see something out here.

452
00:39:29,982 --> 00:39:30,899
What the...

453
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:34,062
Hello?

454
00:39:44,127 --> 00:39:46,320
I'm almost positive I just saw someone.

455
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,213
Hello?

456
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,927
Okay I don't...

457
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,040
I don't see anything so...

458
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,110
My battery is getting kind of low

459
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,310
so I think I'm gonna...

460
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:28,940
I'm gonna shut my phone
off for a few minutes.

461
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,077
I'm gonna keep following this trail and

462
00:40:33,294 --> 00:40:34,770
if I find anything or see anyone else

463
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,570
I guess I'll keep you guys updated.

464
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,440
Okay, so...

465
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,603
Either this hat,

466
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,990
it just like lives here or something

467
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,240
or there is someone and they dropped it.

468
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,990
So I don't know if they like were,

469
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,853
were running that way but there's a hat.

470
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,923
A hat is evidence.

471
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,427
I don't wanna touch it though.

472
00:41:09,477 --> 00:41:10,644
I'm just gonna

473
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,048
go around it, just keep going.

474
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:18,640
It looks like there's something up here

475
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,500
so I, I don't know what's up there,

476
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,430
but I guess let's just keep going and,

477
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,880
and see if there's anything.

478
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:37,690
All right.

479
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,343
Welcome back to Chuckie's vlog.

480
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,790
It's a working title, shut up.

481
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,463
I'm pretty freaked out.

482
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:45,480
There's a sign over here

483
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,900
that's preventing me
from going any further.

484
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,230
So unfortunately I guess this is,

485
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,960
this is where the story ends and I...

486
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,100
I didn't find anything.

487
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,933
I didn't see anyone

488
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:54,766
and it's...

489
00:41:54,816 --> 00:41:56,940
The sun's almost completely down

490
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,470
so it's, I'm gonna just,
you know, go back to...

491
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:03,263
What the fuck?

492
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:06,251
What the actual fuck?

493
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,623
Hello?

494
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,846
Okay.

495
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:14,250
There's gotta be,

496
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,230
There's gotta be someone
out here somewhere.

497
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,113
Hello?

498
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,155
What is that?

499
00:42:23,205 --> 00:42:24,510
Is that sand?

500
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,393
Hold on.

501
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,900
There's like...

502
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,900
something over there, like a ball or...

503
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,932
I don't know.

504
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,653
Kinda looks like fruit.

505
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,667
I don't know how deep that is.

506
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:55,262
Okay, all right.

507
00:43:08,902 --> 00:43:10,553
I'm gonna cross this river.

508
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:13,492
Oh, God I'm stupid.

509
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,973
Okay, all right, I'm in.

510
00:43:19,023 --> 00:43:20,094
I'm in.

511
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,856
It's fruit.

512
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:07,823
It's freaking big fruit!

513
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,968
It's fruit.

514
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:41,333
Bugs.

515
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,703
It's really big fruit.

516
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:05,190
I don't know if it's the same fruit but

517
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,740
this is kinda freaking me out.

518
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,370
My pants are dirty now, so

519
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:37,053
just kinda trying to clean them off here.

520
00:45:38,814 --> 00:45:40,290
And since I'm by myself,

521
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,257
I guess I'm gonna walk
around in my underpants.

522
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:21,990
Okay so I came and sat over here

523
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,750
because those chairs, they...

524
00:46:27,403 --> 00:46:28,786
They kinda freaked me out.

525
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,810
I guess my tablet's over there.

526
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:40,286
I could grab my tablet.

527
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:42,712
And uh...

528
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:44,720
I don't know.

529
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,020
I just,

530
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:46,903
I don't know.

531
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,673
Yeah.

532
00:46:54,452 --> 00:46:55,873
I'm gonna just get my tablet.

533
00:47:09,813 --> 00:47:10,771
Oh Jesus.

534
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,330
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
just look something up.

535
00:47:33,967 --> 00:47:35,450
I don't know, I feel like
I need to do something,

536
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,163
like... something's happening.

537
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:43,415
Hold on.

538
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,660
I've been sitting in this chair for

539
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,215
probably 20 minutes

540
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,633
looking up Verbin,

541
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,090
using Verbin's

542
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,773
WiFi

543
00:48:05,253 --> 00:48:07,268
and I'm not really finding anything!

544
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,380
I don't know if there's anything to find.

545
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,680
I mean, something's...

546
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,250
something's happening but...

547
00:48:27,726 --> 00:48:29,559
In the original video,

548
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:34,840
my brother ate the fruit

549
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:36,790
and then they started finding things out

550
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,440
because more things started
happening to them, so...

551
00:48:52,323 --> 00:48:54,220
I don't wanna do this but...

552
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:06,170
I gotta eat the fruit.

553
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:09,513
I have to eat the fruit.

554
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,780
If there's anyone here

555
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:18,403
who thinks I shouldn't
eat the fruit, you know,

556
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,255
say something!

557
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,690
Okay, I'm not lying when I say this but

558
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,740
I'm a little bit freaked out about this.

559
00:49:47,048 --> 00:49:48,089
Got the fruit.

560
00:49:52,475 --> 00:49:54,225
I need a drink first.

561
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:02,933
Oh gosh.

562
00:50:06,807 --> 00:50:07,890
Dropped the fruit.

563
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:13,000
Kinda freaks me out because

564
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:17,910
when Greg took a bite of the fruit before

565
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,923
things started happening right away.

566
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:47,193
Oh, what the...

567
00:50:49,025 --> 00:50:49,975
What the...

568
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,423
Okay so I cleaned the bathroom up.

569
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:02,863
I don't know what that was.

570
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:10,836
Yeah I, I don't know.

571
00:51:10,886 --> 00:51:11,719
I um...

572
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,130
So good.

573
00:51:17,718 --> 00:51:18,885
What the heck?

574
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,040
Well, my nose is bleeding.

575
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,103
Okay, hold on.

576
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:35,280
So I put tissue in my
nose to stop the bleeding

577
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,300
and it seems to be working,

578
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:38,160
and silly me,

579
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,490
I completely forgot that
I brought a second camera

580
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,010
to set up and now seems
like as good a time as any

581
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,920
in case I get something, you know?

582
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:51,280
So I'll just leave it
right here, facing the room

583
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:54,180
and we'll see what, what happens.

584
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,103
This is good.

585
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,030
This is from the altitude.

586
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,110
Like I'm positive!

587
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,463
My nose bleeds frequently.

588
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:07,150
Actually, let's move this

589
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,553
over to this side.

590
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:11,980
I think I might be able to get more

591
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:16,135
of the room if I set it right there.

592
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,013
Yeah.

593
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:41,960
Anyway, like I said, this
is from the, the altitude

594
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:46,059
and I think I'll be able
to get a lot, you know

595
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,333
from right there.

596
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,711
Wait, what?

597
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,300
Okay, so...

598
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,710
I've been walking around the
house and a quick update.

599
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,083
There's nothing.

600
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,090
There's nothing to see.

601
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,930
I keep hearing things though.

602
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,350
It sounds like whispering or,

603
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,910
or maybe people are outside.

604
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,743
I don't know.

605
00:53:27,793 --> 00:53:29,040
I guess I,

606
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,153
I can go check.

607
00:53:32,366 --> 00:53:34,690
I didn't even think about it, you know?

608
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,573
Ow!

609
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,225
Ow, my thumb.

610
00:53:40,275 --> 00:53:42,191
This is just not my day.

611
00:53:52,852 --> 00:53:54,019
What the fuck?

612
00:54:02,087 --> 00:54:04,247
My fuckin' nail just came off!

613
00:55:25,003 --> 00:55:28,467
I don't really feel like
I'm myself right now.

614
01:00:12,804 --> 01:00:13,887
Yeah, I...

615
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:18,483
I agree with you.

616
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,505
No, sh, sh, sh.

617
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:42,030
Why, why can't we...

618
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:45,003
Why can't we do it right now?

619
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,753
I just,

620
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:51,049
I don't understand.

621
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:06,673
I just wanna hurt myself.

622
01:01:07,783 --> 01:01:10,173
I thought you wanted me to hurt myself.

623
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:35,133
I don't like it when you
say things like that.
