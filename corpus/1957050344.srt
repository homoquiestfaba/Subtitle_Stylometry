1
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,499
What is this place?

2
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:18,666
Our new home.

3
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,199
David, don't run.

4
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,032
Hey, kids.
Yes?

5
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:32,166
Let's go in

6
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:43,799
Don't be like that.
Come inside.

7
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,199
This isn't what you promised.

8
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,099
Grab onto this and step here.

9
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,266
It just gets worse and worse.

10
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:20,366
Want to see something
even better?

11
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,732
Stop it!

12
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,299
How far is the hatchery
from here?

13
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,832
Come here.

14
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,099
Look.

15
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,499
Take a look at this.

16
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,166
Look at the dirt.

17
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,866
Look at the color.

18
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:03,632
This is why picked this place.

19
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:06,099
Because of the dirt color?

20
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,099
This is the best dirt
in America.

21
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:23,066
Daddy's going to make
a big garden!

22
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,299
David, don't run!

23
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:55,032
Where should Grandma's picture go?

24
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:59,799
We're not staying long.
Leave it in the box.

25
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,032
Yeah.

26
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,399
One or two readings are okay.

27
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:11,232
But we'll keep checking.

28
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,466
We'll move closer to
a hospital.

29
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:19,199
Let's sleep together on the floor
for our first night

30
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,066
No, Dad! You snore!

31
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:27,132
I want to listen too.

32
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,299
You do?

33
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,766
Put these in your ears.

34
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,232
Don't forget to keep praying.

35
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,766
.Hello.

36
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:51,932
Oh! Hello.

37
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,099
There are Koreans here

38
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,866
A few of us.

39
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:21,466
I've never seen anyone
as fast as Mr. Yi.

40
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:24,532
Must've made good money
in California.

41
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,432
He did.

42
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,866
But wasn't fast enough
to work there.

43
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:33,032
How long have you been working?

44
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:35,066
About six months.

45
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:39,632
In any case,
you're fast enough for here.

46
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,999
You came to the right place.

47
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,199
Go to your sister.

48
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,632
Go to your sister.

49
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,332
Let's go.

50
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,966
Daddy can take a break.

51
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,999
David, don't run.

52
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,732
What's that?

53
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,632
That?

54
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:18,066
Male chicks are discarded there.

55
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,432
What is "discarded"?

56
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,499
That's a difficult word, huh?

57
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:29,232
Male chicks don't taste good.

58
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,331
They can't lay eggs
and have no use.

59
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,232
So, you and I should try
to be useful.

60
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,932
Okay?

61
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,899
Come here.

62
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,532
Sit down.

63
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,032
Son.

64
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,266
How do you like our farm?

65
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:01,432
How was our land in California?

66
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,932
-We had nothing.
That's right.

67
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,832
We had nothing.

68
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,466
But now...

69
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,699
Ve have this big piece of land.

70
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:27,099
Isn't that good?

71
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:33,432
Then tell Mommy you really like it.

72
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:34,832
Okay?

73
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,799
Let's go inside.

74
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:46,899
The Koreans live in Rogers
near three other big towns.

75
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,832
If we move there we could find a
Korean grandma to babysit

76
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:56,832
There's a big mall, a good school,
and people actually live there.

77
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,132
But what about the deal
we made?

78
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,966
You can work here
and I can build a garden.

79
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:06,466
You can get five acres in Rogers.

80
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:09,866
Five acres is a hobby.

81
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:12,666
But my dream is fifty acres.

82
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:15,599
That land is your dream?

83
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,099
Anyway, we don't need a babysitter

84
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,466
There's no one around.
What could happen?

85
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,966
But what if something
happens to him?

86
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,832
The hospital is an hour away

87
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:42,132
That's strange. The sky is green.

88
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,932
The car is ready.

89
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,932
We'll assess the situation
before we escape.

90
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,366
Escape? Why?

91
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,566
If the tornado hits,
this house will fly away

92
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:27,699
Stop staring. Go to the car.

93
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,132
We need to wait here
and watch.

94
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,466
Watch what?

95
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,232
The news is tracking the tornado.

96
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,699
Look.

97
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,799
Mom!

98
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,732
See?

99
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,199
It'satornado watch,
not a "warning."

100
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:03,399
We worried for no reason.

101
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:10,132
Are you crazy?

102
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,099
Who's calling who crazy?

103
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,832
For you, for our kids!

104
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,799
For our kids?
Oh, come on!

105
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,799
worked for ten years

106
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,032
Ten years!

107
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:43,032
Staring at chicken butts all day.

108
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:44,799
Working myself to the bone!

109
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,632
Living in a tiny home
with no money!

110
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,099
And where did that money go?

111
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,332
-Don't start again.
- Start what?

112
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,666
How much money went to the kids?

113
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:59,166
I'm the eldest son.
had to take care of my family.

114
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,266
I'm done now.
They're all doing well!

115
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:03,932
Who's doing well?
My mother? Us?

116
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,466
Which family are you even
.talking about?

117
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:06,632
Enough!

118
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:28,532
We said we wanted a new start.

119
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,599
This is it.

120
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,332
If this is the "start"you wanted...

121
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:46,366
Maybe there's no chance for us.

122
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:56,132
You're up already?

123
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:12,699
Mom, Anne said we have to move.

124
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,932
Is that true?

125
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,932
Would you live in a house like this
when you're married?

126
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:22,766
I'm going to live here
till the day die.

127
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,632
But are we really moving?

128
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,499
Dad and I talked last night.
We're not moving.

129
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,332
Grandma will come to live
with us instead.

130
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,832
Mommy's mom?

131
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,199
Yes.

132
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:48,832
She'll finally meet David.

133
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,466
Isn't that nice?

134
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:52,666
Yes.

135
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,399
I'll be outside.

136
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,232
Okay.

137
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:05,299
We should get this place ready.
David, eat up.

138
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,399
I'll help you.

139
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,699
Americans...

140
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,332
Believing that nonsense!

141
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:21,632
Korean people use their heads

142
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:29,499
Hey, come here.

143
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,999
Come.

144
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:34,199
Look.

145
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:35,632
When it rains...

146
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,899
That's right.

147
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,332
Where is the low place?

148
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,032
That's right.

149
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,299
Where else?

150
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:56,999
Then which place has
lots of water?

151
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:04,132
My clever little boy!

152
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,666
Never pay for anything
you can find for free.

153
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,766
But for our farm,

154
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:57,099
we can get free water
from the land.

155
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,332
That's how we use our minds

156
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,132
Got it?

157
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,566
Anne, stay here.

158
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,599
Mom.

159
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,632
Do we have to burn all our
trash from now on?

160
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,032
Yes. Isn't the city better?

161
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:32,932
Did we use that stupid stick?
How did we find this?

162
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:34,432
We used our minds!

163
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,432
We used our minds!

164
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,799
More! More!

165
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,699
So scary

166
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:56,732
- You like them?
Yes.

167
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:58,166
Not too big?

168
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,932
They're good.

169
00:20:58,033 --> 00:20:59,899
David, introduce yourself

170
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,099
Mom! Have you looked outside?

171
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:25,066
How much was it?

172
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:27,932
It's an investment.

173
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:30,432
Don't worry.
We'll earn it all back.

174
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:33,266
This is how you farm in America.

175
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,199
Why are you laughing?

176
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:40,366
So, it's not a garden.
It's farm.

177
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:42,999
Garden, farm, it's all the same.

178
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,299
Just think of it as growing money.

179
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,499
In three years,
we can quit chicken sexing.

180
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,232
Just leave enough for David

181
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,466
That's all I'm asking.

182
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,199
You look happy.

183
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:11,699
Maybe because Mother is coming?

184
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:19,832
You look prettiest
when you re happy.

185
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:01,799
Isn't it better to grow
American vegetables?

186
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:09,566
Every year, thirty thousand Koreans
immigrate to the US.

187
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:14,432
- Wouldn't' they miss Korean food?
Yes!

188
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,566
Then how would a Korean farm
like ours do?

189
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:22,232
-Pretty well, right?
Yes

190
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,466
You're shy?

191
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,799
Why don't you want
Grandma to come?

192
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:51,799
It's not earwax, it's dirt.

193
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:06,399
Mommy's dad died during the war.

194
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,632
You know what that means, right?

195
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:13,799
That's why Mommy has no
brothers or sisters.

196
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,399
Understand?

197
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,799
Ne're the only family
Grandma has.

198
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,732
Can't she come live with us?

199
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:26,166
Don't touch that. Answer me.

200
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:29,399
You fight because of Grandma.

201
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,832
If Grandma comes...

202
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:37,199
Would Mommy and Daddy fight?

203
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:44,066
Wow!
My kids are so good-looking!

204
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:46,566
Stand closer together.

205
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:47,832
Good!

206
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,666
One, two... Cheese!

207
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,299
Grandma's here.

208
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:58,866
So good-looking!

209
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:00,566
Grandma's here.

210
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:04,132
Hello, Grandma!

211
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:08,266
Is this Anne?
Already such lady!

212
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,899
David, say hello to Grandma.

213
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:13,699
What is this?

214
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:16,532
Hiding behind your mommy's skirt?

215
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:19,499
Come on out
It's embarrassing.

216
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,266
Mom.

217
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,332
You're finally here.

218
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:27,966
You missed me that much?

219
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,699
I really missed you too.

220
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:36,199
Must've been hard for you
to travel so far.

221
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,199
Here.

222
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,566
Chili powder!

223
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:46,466
Oh my...

224
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:49,532
It's so hard to get here.

225
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:52,432
We even drove eight hours
to Dallas.

226
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:54,366
And it wasn't very good.

227
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:59,099
You brought anchovies too?

228
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:02,232
You're crying again?

229
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:04,232
Because of anchovies?

230
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,532
I'm sorry you have to see
how our life is now

231
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,899
Why?
Because the house has wheels?

232
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,932
It's fun!

233
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:22,399
Hold on.

234
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:24,432
Also...

235
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,032
This...

236
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:32,499
This is something from me,
so take it.

237
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,466
No, Mom. I can't

238
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:36,499
Take it!

239
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,999
No, Mom. No!

240
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,832
should be giving you money

241
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,666
I'm working now!

242
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:43,566
Just put it away.

243
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:52,666
Is he ever going to greet
Grandma?

244
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:57,499
Is this the one who
looks like me?

245
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:03,566
Are you curious?

246
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:07,999
Nhat?

247
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:10,266
Say it louder.

248
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:14,699
She doesn't look like a grandma?

249
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,766
Oh! Really?

250
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:18,966
What a good boy!

251
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:21,932
I'll give you a present
for that compliment!

252
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:23,032
Let's see.

253
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,466
Here.

254
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,732
You're giving cards to
a seven-year-old?

255
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:31,032
Start him young to beat
those other bastards!

256
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,899
No?

257
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:37,399
Then I'll give you something else!

258
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,699
It's a chestnut!

259
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,132
Looks yummy!
Go on and take it.

260
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,766
He's never eaten this before.

261
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:46,799
Really?

262
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:48,399
Wait one second.

263
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,432
You don't have to do that for him.

264
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:55,166
In case it got stale during
the plane ride.

265
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,732
Here, eat it!

266
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:00,032
Take it, David.

267
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:02,532
- Take it. Take it.
- Eat it. Eat it

268
00:31:02,533 --> 00:31:04,399
Take it
-that' 's good boy. Eat it.

269
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,799
Say, "Thank you.

270
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:13,832
heard American kids don't like
sharing their rooms.

271
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:17,066
He's not like that.
He's a Korean kid.

272
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:10,332
No. No need.

273
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:06,399
-What' s in it?
- Anything good for you.

274
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:10,632
It has everything,
even deer antlers.

275
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:13,532
You must've spent a lot.

276
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:22,532
David, you're so lucky!

277
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:27,166
- Is this enough?
That's good, that's good.

278
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,866
That's good.

279
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,832
Here.

280
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,166
Try some.
don't want it.

281
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:42,466
Drink it
Grandma brought it from Korea.

282
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:45,632
That's it!

283
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:49,799
- don't want it.
It's expensive. Drink it all

284
00:34:52,033 --> 00:34:54,698
Good! Such a good boy!

285
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:57,666
Grandma...

286
00:34:58,433 --> 00:35:02,632
In the future,
never, ever bring this again.

287
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,666
You'll drink one cup every day.

288
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:08,866
Good job.

289
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:28,799
Hey.

290
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,432
What?
“Grandma smells?

291
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:33,766
Go get the stick.

292
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,532
No?

293
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,299
Then behave in front of Grandma.

294
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:40,866
Now go to bed.

295
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,566
Go to bed.

296
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:17,699
What are you making?

297
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,832
Pasta.

298
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:43,399
Looks tasty.
Can Grandma try some?

299
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:01,999
What's that?

300
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,332
It's water from the mountains.

301
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:07,199
Dad says it's good for
your health.

302
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:11,166
Then I'll try some.

303
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,966
Grandma?

304
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:15,699
Yes?

305
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,432
You can't cook?

306
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:19,232
No, can't.

307
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:22,099
Can you bake cookies?

308
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,099
No.

309
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,332
Can you bake them?

310
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,599
Then what can you do?

311
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:32,199
Sucks for you!

312
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,666
Now they're mine!

313
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:35,599
Out of my way,
you bastard!

314
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,866
Watch and learn.

315
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,766
Damn it.

316
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:39,832
Vait.

317
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:41,066
That's right!

318
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:42,399
Now, Anne!

319
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,166
Keep playing, keep playing!

320
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:44,966
Hurry!

321
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:48,599
A plague on you!

322
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,866
Damn it

323
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,466
Okay, wait.

324
00:37:53,467 --> 00:37:55,066
Let's see

325
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:56,732
Bastard!

326
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:04,832
Why hasn't anyone started
Korean church here?

327
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:08,699
Start a church with
fifteen Koreans?

328
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,966
It could be nice.
The Korean kids can play together.

329
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:15,366
The Koreans around here...

330
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:18,866
Left the cities for a reason.

331
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:23,232
To escape Korean church.

332
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:07,166
We shouldn't be so far
out here.

333
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,032
It's fine!
Just a little further.

334
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,066
This would be a great place

335
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:21,499
Grandma.

336
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,299
We shouldn't be here
because of the snakes.

337
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,199
Do you even know
what minari is?

338
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,699
You stupid Americans.

339
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,632
I brought some minari seeds
from Korea.

340
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:41,199
We can plant them
right over there.

341
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:53,532
The minari will grow well here.

342
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:02,599
Grandma, stop it!

343
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,032
Fine.

344
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:13,132
That looks tasty.
Eat, David.

345
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,866
You too, Anne.

346
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,466
We should plant some minari.

347
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:22,899
It'll grow well
down by the creek.

348
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:25,399
I'll think about it.

349
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:29,332
What's there to-think about?
I'll just plant it.

350
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:32,466
Mom, try some of this.

351
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:37,199
Hey, David.
Bring that mountain water.

352
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:38,899
That's it.

353
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,999
You two used to love this song.

354
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,099
This song

355
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:53,432
Sure!

356
00:40:53,433 --> 00:40:57,299
Whenever someone made
your mom and dad sing,

357
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,866
they'd get all lovey-dovey
as they sang this song.

358
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,899
Did we?

359
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,766
They come to America and
forget everything.

360
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:24,399
love you, darling.

361
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,332
Truly, love you.

362
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,832
Truly...

363
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:39,932
ove you.

364
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,066
David, let's pray.

365
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:55,599
Mommy heard a story about
some kids in Korea...

366
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,232
They prayed to see Heaven
before bedtime.

367
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:01,866
And God heard their prayers.

368
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:05,932
One kid had a weak heart
like you.

369
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:09,766
When he woke up,
he was healed!

370
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:14,599
Why don't you pray to
see Heaven too?

371
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,299
You pray, Mommy.
You go and see Heaven.

372
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,432
Mommy can't do it.

373
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,699
Hey!

374
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,599
You make this kid do
all sorts of crap!

375
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,132
You scared me!

376
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:39,432
Okay.

377
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,866
Monica.

378
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:02,132
Practicing on them is pointless.
They're too old.

379
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:11,066
You're fast enough for Arkansas.

380
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:14,866
Don n't' talk to me if youre'
not going to help.

381
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:42,632
You must be lonely here
without friends.

382
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,266
Even with Mother here,
it's not the same thing.

383
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,999
Why are you saying this,
all of a sudden?

384
00:43:56,833 --> 00:44:00,999
thought we might
go to church.

385
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:18,132
Don't hide it, okay?

386
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:23,332
Something must be broken
down there.

387
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:26,566
What is his thing called
in English?

388
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:28,132
“Penis

389
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,099
Mommy...

390
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:39,232
Sometimes, I dream
I'm peeing in the bathroom,

391
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:42,366
but I wake up in my bed.

392
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:46,532
Then ask yourself
before you pee,

393
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,666
And pinch yourself like this!

394
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:00,332
Mom!

395
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:07,266
Mom.

396
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,532
There's another one.

397
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:46,132
So fat!
That man is so fat!

398
00:46:46,133 --> 00:46:47,566
Look at him!

399
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:48,699
Can sleep over at his house?

400
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,066
You should sleep at home,
with Grandma.

401
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,299
Don't say that.

402
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:17,332
Let's just work on Sundays.

403
00:48:18,267 --> 00:48:22,666
Then why did you give
so much money?

404
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:45,132
Is that Paul?

405
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:28,266
What?

406
00:49:28,267 --> 00:49:31,199
You like Jesus too.

407
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:42,032
Look at those muscles!

408
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:48,999
Ay, my
That's impressive.

409
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:54,232
Grandma,
you're not a real grandma.

410
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:56,199
What is a real grandma?

411
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,132
They bake cookies!
They don't swear!

412
00:49:59,133 --> 00:50:01,266
They don't wear men's underwear!

413
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:02,399
Really?

414
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:04,599
Don't do that!

415
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:08,332
Go get some mountain water.
Let's drink that.

416
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:10,266
NO.

417
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:11,799
Come here.

418
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:24,066
Oh, my!

419
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:26,599
He's hitting him again.
And again!

420
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,132
Someone could get killed!

421
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:30,266
You little bastard!

422
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:33,866
Come back here,
you little bastard!

423
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,666
Raise your hands!

424
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,699
Keep them apart.

425
00:52:29,267 --> 00:52:30,599
Come on!

426
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,066
Keep them up!

427
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:36,266
Raise them straight.

428
00:52:39,933 --> 00:52:41,532
That's enough.

429
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:44,466
Now apologize to Grandma.

430
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,432
Sorry...

431
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:50,199
You call that an apology?

432
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,899
Do it properly!

433
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,199
She's not even a real grandma...

434
00:52:55,533 --> 00:52:57,666
It's okay, it's okay!

435
00:52:57,667 --> 00:53:00,332
Just don't do it again, okay?

436
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:04,999
I'll try to be a real grandma
from now on.

437
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,899
Go get the stick.

438
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,099
Why would you hit him?

439
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,099
Get the stick.

440
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:23,632
Why would you hit such a
sweet boy?

441
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,199
He's only a child!

442
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,266
Who cares if I drank
a little pee?

443
00:53:27,267 --> 00:53:28,599
It was fun!

444
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,099
Mom!

445
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:54,499
Go outside and get a new one.

446
00:54:27,967 --> 00:54:30,366
I'll do better. I'll do better.

447
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:33,566
Mom, it's bad enough you're
in this hillbilly place.

448
00:54:33,567 --> 00:54:35,432
Why "hillbilly" place?

449
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:38,632
It's hillbilly,
so David lost all his manners.

450
00:54:38,633 --> 00:54:42,066
Just because you're from the city
doesn't make you better.

451
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:45,266
You two will fight over anything!

452
00:54:54,433 --> 00:54:56,232
Let's see.

453
00:54:59,567 --> 00:55:01,332
My, my!

454
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:03,199
Such clever boy.

455
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,932
Good job.

456
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:06,132
You won.

457
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,432
You're the real winner!

458
00:57:59,033 --> 00:58:00,366
Monica.

459
00:58:00,367 --> 00:58:02,832
Will you help me?

460
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:08,066
- must've' worked too hard.
- Does it hurt lot?

461
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,499
I can't raise my arms
any higher.

462
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,666
need to wash my hair...

463
00:58:33,733 --> 00:58:36,632
Working outdoors makes me
feel alive.

464
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,866
Why do you always pinch me
like that?

465
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,399
Ne're losing so much money.

466
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,532
I'm worried.

467
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,132
Everything will be fine.

468
00:58:59,767 --> 00:59:02,099
I'll take care of us.

469
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:07,066
Coming to this "hillbilly place"
was for our family.

470
00:59:08,933 --> 00:59:11,866
And if the farm fails...

471
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:14,532
You can do what you want.

472
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:18,966
You could even leave
with the kids.

473
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,632
Lean forward.

474
01:02:11,567 --> 01:02:13,432
Hello, sir.

475
01:02:15,867 --> 01:02:20,899
Yes, the order is ready.
We'll send it this weekend.

476
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,732
But we've already started...

477
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,032
All right.

478
01:04:17,033 --> 01:04:18,932
Finished already?

479
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:26,299
Someone could get killed.

480
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:27,366
My, my...

481
01:04:36,233 --> 01:04:39,999
Grandma,
please help him change.

482
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,099
Who cares
what a little boy wears?

483
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,332
Grandma,
the water isn't working.

484
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,366
- Your arms still hurt?
-I'm fine.

485
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,266
Just leave it.

486
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:23,832
If they're injured,
we throw them away.

487
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,966
Anne! Grandma!

488
01:05:35,267 --> 01:05:37,866
Anne! Grandma!

489
01:05:41,067 --> 01:05:43,099
What is it?

490
01:05:44,967 --> 01:05:46,399
My goodness!

491
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,832
Hurry! Get towel!

492
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,132
Anne, snap out of it!
Get a towel!

493
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:04,666
The church bus is here.

494
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:06,966
You go ahead, without David.

495
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,632
There we go.

496
01:06:13,967 --> 01:06:16,032
Which drawer attacked you?

497
01:06:17,967 --> 01:06:20,699
You lifted that heavy thing?

498
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,499
And you put it back,
all by yourself?

499
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,499
Goodness.

500
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,632
Okay. Try standing up.

501
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,932
There you go.

502
01:06:31,933 --> 01:06:33,399
Good.

503
01:06:35,733 --> 01:06:37,599
Now, try walking.

504
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,799
Oh, my

505
01:06:48,567 --> 01:06:49,666
What?

506
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,799
No one's ever said that to you?

507
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,199
David.

508
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,732
You're strong boy.

509
01:06:56,733 --> 01:07:00,366
You're the strongest boy
Grandma's ever seen!

510
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,199
- Grandma.

511
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,999
What does pee taste like?

512
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:10,932
You rascal!

513
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,266
The weather is nice.

514
01:07:20,267 --> 01:07:23,832
Grandma!
You can walk faster like this!

515
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:25,932
I can?

516
01:07:25,933 --> 01:07:30,299
Goodness.
You might as well run.

517
01:07:31,467 --> 01:07:34,766
You do that
because you shouldn't run?

518
01:07:35,033 --> 01:07:37,599
You want to run, don't you?

519
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:44,366
Why don't we try running
to that tree together?

520
01:07:45,967 --> 01:07:48,866
don't think can.

521
01:07:48,867 --> 01:07:50,832
It's okay, it's okay.

522
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,899
Let's just go.

523
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,066
Slowly.

524
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,566
Let's go slowly

525
01:08:09,867 --> 01:08:13,499
Careful. Careful.

526
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:17,866
The minari is growing well?

527
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:25,032
David, you ve never eaten
minari before, huh?

528
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:28,398
Minari is truly the best.

529
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:32,299
It grows anywhere, like weeds.

530
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:35,499
So anyone can pick and eat it.

531
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:41,299
Rich or poor
anyone can enjoy it and be healthy

532
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:48,199
Minari can be put in kimchi
put in stew, put in soup.

533
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,266
It can be medicine
if you are sick..

534
01:08:51,267 --> 01:08:55,532
Minari is wonderful, wonderful!

535
01:09:05,067 --> 01:09:06,599
That's right!

536
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,332
Is that a minari song?

537
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:17,898
The wind is blowing and
the minari is bowing.

538
01:09:18,233 --> 01:09:21,398
They're saying
thank you very much!

539
01:09:27,533 --> 01:09:30,099
Grandma!
Look at that

540
01:09:31,533 --> 01:09:34,566
Stop, David!
Leave it alone!

541
01:09:34,567 --> 01:09:37,732
It might crawl away and hide!

542
01:09:37,733 --> 01:09:39,398
David.

543
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:43,532
It's better to see it
than to have it hide.

544
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:48,599
Things that hide are more
dangerous and scary.

545
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,799
- There's' been no water all day?

546
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,299
should check the pipes.

547
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,332
He thinks I don't know.

548
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:30,999
We can't afford more water.
He used it all on the crops.

549
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,499
What are we going to do?

550
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:39,899
I'm sure we'll borrow more
from the bank.

551
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,666
Daddy, where are you going?

552
01:10:48,267 --> 01:10:49,799
No.

553
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,699
Go inside.

554
01:10:53,567 --> 01:10:54,899
Mom.

555
01:10:55,533 --> 01:10:58,999
I'll take care of our family.

556
01:10:59,267 --> 01:11:01,566
Don't work too hard.

557
01:11:05,233 --> 01:11:08,466
So, where did you get
all that water?

558
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:13,299
David and I hauled it over
from the minari creek.

559
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:17,732
David is stronger than you think,
you know.

560
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:21,632
He's not supposed.
to do things like that.

561
01:11:23,233 --> 01:11:27,932
You remember Cousin-doo-won?
That big, dumb kid.

562
01:11:27,933 --> 01:11:31,866
At David's age,
he was much weaker.

563
01:11:31,867 --> 01:11:34,132
You don't understand, Mom.

564
01:11:34,133 --> 01:11:37,666
Getting hurt is
all part of growing up.

565
01:11:37,967 --> 01:11:40,499
Even the doctors are worried.

566
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,599
His heart could stop
at any moment.

567
01:12:24,367 --> 01:12:26,166
What are you doing?

568
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,532
Why aren't you sleeping?
What's wrong?

569
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:42,699
Mommy said if pray,
I can see Heaven in my sleep.

570
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:48,366
Like those kids who prayed
to see Heaven?

571
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:55,666
Are you scared?

572
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:05,466
It's all right.
You don't have to go see Heaven.

573
01:13:05,467 --> 01:13:08,632
Saying such nonsense to a kid.

574
01:13:09,267 --> 01:13:12,899
But... I already prayed.

575
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,099
I already asked to see it.

576
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,766
But now, I don't want to go.

577
01:13:22,433 --> 01:13:26,299
Then David...

578
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:31,132
Pray this instead.

579
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,599
"No thank you... Heaven.

580
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,832
But what if I go to Hell?

581
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,066
Why are you worrying about
that already?

582
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,932
I don't want to die.

583
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,966
Come here, David.

584
01:13:56,967 --> 01:13:58,932
Grandma won't...

585
01:13:58,933 --> 01:14:03,232
Grandma won't let you die.

586
01:14:03,867 --> 01:14:05,032
Who?

587
01:14:05,033 --> 01:14:08,466
Who dares to scare
my grandson like this?

588
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:09,699
Don't worry.

589
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,132
Grandma won't let you die.

590
01:14:12,133 --> 01:14:14,966
Who dares?

591
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,432
You'll be fine.

592
01:14:17,433 --> 01:14:21,799
You don't have to see Heaven.

593
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,099
Grandma.

594
01:16:21,767 --> 01:16:23,599
Grandma?

595
01:16:24,233 --> 01:16:26,266
Grandma!

596
01:16:26,733 --> 01:16:30,732
Grandma,
why did you wet the bed?

597
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:56,366
Mom took grandma
to the hospital.

598
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,066
Vas church good?

599
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:37,199
Y
es.

600
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,966
- There's' no water?
-ENot yet.

601
01:18:39,967 --> 01:18:41,466
That's not good...

602
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:45,199
can get more from
the minari creek

603
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:50,299
Stay with your friends tonight,
but be careful.

604
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,866
We will.

605
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:01,866
Out of my way,
you bastard!

606
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:10,532
Grandma...

607
01:23:20,133 --> 01:23:23,266
What are you looking at,
Grandma?

608
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:26,699
Leave it...

609
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:30,699
It will hide....will hide.

610
01:23:37,233 --> 01:23:39,799
Anne, come over here.

611
01:23:46,433 --> 01:23:49,199
What's wrong with Grandma?

612
01:23:51,233 --> 01:23:55,899
Grandma had a stroke.
She needs to rest

613
01:23:56,367 --> 01:23:59,066
Why did it happen?

614
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,999
It's my fault.

615
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,366
This happened because
was selfish.

616
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,532
Grandma wil be okay,Mom.

617
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:15,866
My daughter's so grown-up.
Worrying about her mom

618
01:24:16,833 --> 01:24:20,332
Always looking after
her brother, too.

619
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:22,999
I'm sorry.

620
01:24:25,067 --> 01:24:28,332
I won't let this happen again.

621
01:25:18,167 --> 01:25:20,299
David, help Grandma.

622
01:25:22,733 --> 01:25:25,199
told you to help grandma.

623
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,032
Here, Mom.

624
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:32,199
For... David...
Him...him.

625
01:28:17,633 --> 01:28:21,266
You said he was strange,
now you ask him to do this?

626
01:28:21,267 --> 01:28:22,899
When did I say that?

627
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:26,932
He wanted to help us.
We should be grateful.

628
01:28:27,467 --> 01:28:29,932
What did you tell him about us

629
01:28:29,933 --> 01:28:32,499
Why would I tell him anything?

630
01:28:56,267 --> 01:28:58,666
It's your fault, Grandma.

631
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:01,099
It's all because of you.

632
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:04,899
You shouldn't have come
to America.

633
01:29:23,267 --> 01:29:25,299
Mom, look over here.

634
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:29,632
There's food in the fridge.
No need to heat it up, okay?

635
01:29:32,267 --> 01:29:34,899
It's okay.
You don't have to help.

636
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:38,266
Watch TV and rest
Ne'll be home late.

637
01:29:40,633 --> 01:29:42,666
Don't worry

638
01:29:45,533 --> 01:29:48,399
Thank you so much, Mom.

639
01:29:49,433 --> 01:29:51,732
We'll be back.

640
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,832
You're bringing that inside?

641
01:31:50,467 --> 01:31:52,366
It's too hot out here.

642
01:31:52,367 --> 01:31:54,666
Where will you put it?

643
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,466
Okay.

644
01:31:57,467 --> 01:32:01,466
I'll park downstairs.
Go ahead.

645
01:32:01,467 --> 01:32:04,632
Ve're here for David.

646
01:32:04,633 --> 01:32:07,032
Okay. Go on in.

647
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,532
Is he okay?

648
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,399
We don't know.

649
01:33:04,233 --> 01:33:06,832
The doctor will tell us.

650
01:33:07,767 --> 01:33:10,399
Here we go. Good job!

651
01:33:36,867 --> 01:33:41,499
Life was so difficult in Korea

652
01:33:46,733 --> 01:33:50,432
Remember what we said
when we got married?

653
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:56,466
That we'd go to America
and save each other.

654
01:33:59,433 --> 01:34:01,866
remember.

655
01:34:04,867 --> 01:34:08,399
Instead of saving each other...

656
01:34:09,133 --> 01:34:14,699
All we did- was fight.
Is that why he's sick?

657
01:34:25,067 --> 01:34:27,399
Jacob.

658
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:30,599
Can't you come with us?

659
01:34:31,967 --> 01:34:34,699
can't do this without you.

660
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:38,466
You're the one who
Wants to leave.

661
01:34:42,133 --> 01:34:44,266
We'll go broke living here.

662
01:34:44,267 --> 01:34:47,599
In California, we could easily
pay off our debt.

663
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,699
By chicken sexing until we die.

664
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:53,232
Think about the kids.

665
01:34:53,233 --> 01:34:58,166
They need to see me
succeed at something for once.

666
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,832
For what?

667
01:35:03,733 --> 01:35:07,099
Isn't it more important that
we stay together?

668
01:35:16,567 --> 01:35:22,099
You go ahead
\and do what you want.

669
01:35:25,667 --> 01:35:33,099
Even if fail,
I have to finish what started.

670
01:35:47,767 --> 01:35:50,299
Kids. Let's go.

671
01:36:44,267 --> 01:36:47,299
Good job!

672
01:36:55,233 --> 01:36:56,432
Good!

673
01:37:25,633 --> 01:37:28,366
Look, it's kimbap!

674
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,366
Beans?

675
01:37:38,533 --> 01:37:41,299
-Anne,don' 't touch it
Okay

676
01:37:46,167 --> 01:37:49,366
It's a very good idea.

677
01:37:49,367 --> 01:37:54,599
Many Koreans are moving to
Oklahoma City.

678
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:58,632
Yes, and most of your produce
comes from California.

679
01:37:58,633 --> 01:38:02,632
It arrives in worse shape
and doesn't taste as good.

680
01:38:02,633 --> 01:38:05,566
We're only five hours away.

681
01:38:06,033 --> 01:38:07,266
Very good.

682
01:38:07,267 --> 01:38:08,532
Then...

683
01:38:09,167 --> 01:38:11,499
When should we start?

684
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:14,432
Let's start next week.

685
01:38:15,067 --> 01:38:16,966
Thank you.

686
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,999
Please keep these as samples.

687
01:38:22,767 --> 01:38:24,199
Thank you very much!

688
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:29,366
Thank you!

689
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,899
Have a good day.

690
01:38:36,033 --> 01:38:38,099
Did you see?

691
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,499
They have so many
Korean foods.

692
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,132
This is such perfect timing.

693
01:38:43,133 --> 01:38:45,432
The owner said so himself

694
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,099
Mom must be in shock.
She's speechless.

695
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:56,932
Anne, take David to the car.

696
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,732
Monica.

697
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,899
Monica.

698
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:23,266
What is it?

699
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:36,466
You're really asking
because you don't know?

700
01:39:36,467 --> 01:39:38,899
At the hospital...

701
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:43,166
You chose the farm
over our family.

702
01:39:45,167 --> 01:39:47,899
It's different now.

703
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:51,399
Everything worked out.

704
01:39:52,033 --> 01:39:55,199
We can live together when
things are good,

705
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:58,399
but when they're not,
we fall apart?

706
01:39:59,933 --> 01:40:02,566
Let's just stop, okay?

707
01:40:02,567 --> 01:40:07,732
Now, we can make money
and live without worries.

708
01:40:10,733 --> 01:40:13,166
So, you're saying...

709
01:40:13,533 --> 01:40:18,199
We can't save each other,
but money can?

710
01:40:22,167 --> 01:40:24,932
But Jacob...

711
01:40:25,933 --> 01:40:29,066
Things might be fine now.

712
01:40:30,033 --> 01:40:33,732
But I don't think they will
stay that way.

713
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:42,632
I know this won't end well
and can't bear it.

714
01:40:44,033 --> 01:40:46,966
I've lost my faith in you.

715
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:57,032
can't do this anymore.

716
01:41:19,033 --> 01:41:21,466
Okay

717
01:41:22,667 --> 01:41:25,232
It's done.

718
01:41:55,333 --> 01:41:57,466
You haven't left yet?

719
01:41:57,467 --> 01:41:59,766
We're heading out now.

720
01:41:59,767 --> 01:42:03,032
I'll see you next week.

721
01:43:01,233 --> 01:43:03,332
What's that smell?

722
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,399
It smells like smoke.

723
01:43:06,667 --> 01:43:08,666
Jacob...

724
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,766
Stay in the car!

725
01:43:22,167 --> 01:43:23,466
Stay in the car!

726
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:27,099
Jacob!

727
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:49,332
Grandma!
- Grandma!

728
01:43:49,333 --> 01:43:51,666
Mom, are you okay?

729
01:43:51,667 --> 01:43:53,899
What happened?

730
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,566
Mom!

731
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:59,399
Jacob!

732
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:01,966
Mom!

733
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:04,699
Jacob!

734
01:44:05,167 --> 01:44:06,532
Honey!

735
01:44:06,533 --> 01:44:08,699
Get out!
Get out of here!

736
01:44:22,833 --> 01:44:24,032
Mom!

737
01:44:24,833 --> 01:44:25,899
Dad!

738
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:27,166
Dad!

739
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:28,166
Dad!

740
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:50,032
Grandma!

741
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:54,599
You stay here, okay?

742
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,499
Grandma!

743
01:45:01,167 --> 01:45:02,399
Honey

744
01:45:03,167 --> 01:45:04,666
Honey

745
01:45:22,867 --> 01:45:23,799
Honey

746
01:46:29,167 --> 01:46:30,799
Grandma!

747
01:46:31,567 --> 01:46:33,732
Grandma, where are you going?

748
01:46:33,867 --> 01:46:36,132
- Grandma!
Grandma!

749
01:46:36,533 --> 01:46:37,766
Grandma!

750
01:46:41,133 --> 01:46:42,799
Grandma!

751
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,632
Grandma!

752
01:46:47,867 --> 01:46:49,832
Grandma!

753
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:23,466
Grandma, this is the wrong way

754
01:47:24,267 --> 01:47:25,799
Grandma.

755
01:47:26,267 --> 01:47:29,199
Our house is back there.

756
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:30,966
Grandma!

757
01:47:30,967 --> 01:47:33,366
Please don't leave, Grandma.

758
01:47:33,367 --> 01:47:35,866
Come home with us.

759
01:50:35,667 --> 01:50:38,799
It's growing well on its own.

760
01:50:49,033 --> 01:50:52,732
Grandma picked a good spot.

761
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:03,366
Looks tasty.
