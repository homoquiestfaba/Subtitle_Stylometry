1
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,139
Free Baader!

2
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,270
We are watching! We are watching!

3
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,189
Free Meinhof!

4
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,593
Patricia.

5
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,400
So, I have a patient
that is coming in five minutes.

6
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,402
I can ask him
to come back later.

7
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,737
Please.

8
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,930
This song, it's stuck
in my head, and it's so loud.

9
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,772
Do you see what I mean?

10
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,116
Do you see what I mean?

11
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,168
They're going to try
to keep her alive after all.

12
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,836
Markos?

13
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,674
Quick, get us seats over there

14
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,467
before those boys take them!

15
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,097
The guitarist is so cute...

16
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,067
I was right.

17
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,823
They are witches.

18
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,296
I have to tell Sara
to get out of there.

19
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,218
She's the only girl
I actually give a damn about.

20
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,054
Her delusion has deepened into panic.

21
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,557
She feels her constructed mythology
is confirmed.

22
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,725
If I leave without her,

23
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,727
they may pick her next.

24
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,145
Or Olga.

25
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,855
I should warn Olga, too.

26
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,861
Olga's already
figured out things.

27
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,988
She saw how they groomed me.

28
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,869
There's more in that building
than what you can see.

29
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:17,257
They've been underground
since the war.

30
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:25,307
And you think
they can hear you now?

31
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,244
At the beginning,
they gave me things.

32
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,081
Perfect balance, perfect sleep.

33
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,793
Talking with our minds.

34
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,045
But they took my hair.

35
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,090
They took my urine. They...

36
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,176
They took my eyes.

37
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,430
Now she can see me.

38
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,952
Mother Markos.

39
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,749
She wants to get inside of me.

40
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,253
I can feel her.

41
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,671
I thought I wanted it.

42
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,637
I let it happen.

43
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,183
Do you understand me?

44
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,479
If they find out I was here,
they won't hesitate.

45
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,028
They will hollow me out
and eat my cunt on a plate.

46
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,128
Herr Berger is waiting for you,
Doctor.

47
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,465
- Mr. Berger, please.
- Good morning, Doctor...

48
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,386
Okay, that's good. That's good.

49
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,243
Morning, Pastor.

50
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,454
Did the rain get your clothes
all wet?

51
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,581
No, don't you worry. The girls
just hung that all up.

52
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,043
Is what I just heard
on the radio.

53
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,503
- That'll just about do it.
- Just about.

54
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,510
How is she today?

55
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,769
You are Mrs. Bannion.

56
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,603
Hello.

57
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,564
You're Miss Tanner?

58
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,608
Yes. Come in.

59
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,825
Nah?

60
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,289
I tried to call you
at your hotel this morning

61
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,709
to ask you
if you could reschedule.

62
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,629
- Why?
- Company business.

63
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,048
It's not a good time just today.

64
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,841
But here you are.

65
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,044
And one, and two,

66
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,256
and three, and four,

67
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,341
and five,

68
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,636
and six, and seven,

69
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,555
and eight.

70
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,016
Elbows up. And one...

71
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,060
Come in, Susie.

72
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:38,526
Miss Millius and Miss Mandel
are the company's repetiteurs.

73
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,486
And Veva Blanc?

74
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,739
I was told she would be here.

75
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,198
Oh, dear.

76
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,827
You have no formal training
or references.

77
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,413
Your insistence to audition

78
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,917
happened to catch Madame Blanc
on a good day.

79
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,671
But you really shouldn't
be here at all.

80
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,757
Do you understand?

81
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,467
Yeah?

82
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,634
Good.

83
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,802
Well, then let's start.

84
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,485
I prefer dancing without music.

85
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,320
Thank you.

86
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,656
You can keep time
in your head, yes?

87
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,446
And Hypnose.

88
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,740
And here we have...

89
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,534
a line between the elbows.

90
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,993
Face forward.

91
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,955
Perfect, and... Morphus.

92
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,958
And here,
not so close to the face.

93
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,168
More like you're holding
a bird or something.

94
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,603
They did it when we
were in morning rehearsal.

95
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,980
They just put her things
in shipping boxes.

96
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,524
You don't think she
had to go underground, do you?

97
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,318
I don't care what happened.

98
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,986
I just want her to call.

99
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,404
I'm really worried.

100
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,868
Miss Bannion, come.

101
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,709
I've just spoken
with Madame Blanc.

102
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,211
Well done, Miss Bannion.

103
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,426
I imagine you will need
to return home

104
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,887
to settle things
and make arrangements

105
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,138
for moving to Berlin.

106
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,389
No. No, no.

107
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,975
I can start right now.

108
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,811
Good.

109
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,356
This is Miss Boutaher,

110
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,733
our technical director.

111
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,193
Hello.

112
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,238
And this is Miss Vendegast.

113
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,281
- She acts as house mother...
- Hello.

114
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,409
...for our dancers
who reside here.

115
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,663
Where'd you come from?

116
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,542
Ohio.

117
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,423
We operate as a sort
of Ruth Bré collective.

118
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,968
As we cannot pay our dancers
a lot of money,

119
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,596
we offer dormitory-style rooms,
rent-free.

120
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,307
You don't... you don't charge
anything at all?

121
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,309
Not a mark.

122
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,232
In this company,
we fully understand

123
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:50,861
the importance of a woman's
financial autonomy.

124
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,491
Normally, it would be full
at this time of year,

125
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,743
but we have had a room open.

126
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,370
Yeah. Patricia's.

127
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,331
Do you know Patricia?

128
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,920
No, I heard some girls talking

129
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,463
about her in the hall.

130
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:16,679
Now that you're one of us,
I won't be coy.

131
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,681
Patricia has just left
the company

132
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,641
under sad circumstances.

133
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:25,021
We think she won't be back,
so there's room if you want.

134
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:29,483
We'll send you one of our girls
to help you with your luggage.

135
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,110
After lunch.

136
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,070
It's all right for you?

137
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,822
Yes.

138
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,198
It's-it... it's all...

139
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,825
Yes.

140
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,577
It's perfect.

141
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,396
Hello. Hi.
I'm sorry I'm late.

142
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,981
- Hi.
- It's the rain.

143
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,067
Whenever it rains in Berlin,
everyone jumps in a cab,

144
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,985
and like an idiot,
I just let ours go.

145
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,654
Hi. I'm Sara.

146
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,739
We're gonna have to take
our chances on the street.

147
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,074
Do you have an umbrella?

148
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,950
When you weren't here
by 6:00,

149
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,662
I had to take the room
for another night.

150
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,289
Oh. God, Susie, I'm sorry.

151
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,166
Everything was a mess
at the company today.

152
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,210
Why are you smiling?

153
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,128
I'm sor... I-I...

154
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,590
When you said Berlin
a second ago,

155
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,175
you said "everyone in Berlin,"

156
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,304
and I just thought that...
that includes me now.

157
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,889
I live in Berlin.

158
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,392
Yes. Congrats.

159
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,352
I heard you were
a sensation today.

160
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,979
Have you called your
family yet, to tell them?

161
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,024
Miss Blanc came
into my audition.

162
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,486
But she left right after.

163
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,446
She's incredible.

164
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,117
The way she transmits her work,
her energy.

165
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,618
When it shines on you, it's...

166
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,495
"addictive" is the word for it.

167
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,996
She's tough.

168
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,165
She kept the company alive
through the war.

169
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,459
When the Reich just wanted
women to shut off their minds

170
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,961
and keep their uteruses open,

171
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,130
there was Blanc.

172
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,173
Thank you.

173
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,383
"La vrai chose."

174
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:18,968
What?

175
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,219
W-Was that French?

176
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,732
It's a bomb.

177
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,734
I can smell it.

178
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,861
There's a bank that way.

179
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,740
Don't you know
what's happening here?

180
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,992
The hijackers
are negotiating a release

181
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,827
of the Stammheim prisoners
tonight.

182
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,163
The RAF.

183
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,498
Baader-Meinhof.

184
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,959
They kidnapped an executive.

185
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:56,005
During the war,
he was a Nazi SS, an officer.

186
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,759
Now he runs the German
Employers' Association.

187
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,677
You don't get how awful
that is, do you?

188
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,728
Sorry.

189
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,773
I'm just worried
about my friend.

190
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,256
Now for the voting,

191
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,551
each of us says the name
of her choice.

192
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,971
Mandel, whom are you voting for?

193
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,890
Markos.

194
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,392
- Killen?
- Blanc.

195
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,978
- Judith?
- Markos.

196
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,815
- Boutaher?
- Blanc.

197
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,983
- Millius?
- Markos.

198
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,653
- Martincin?
- Markos.

199
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,154
- Huller?
- Markos.

200
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,740
- Mauceri?
- Blanc.

201
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,826
- Marks?
- Markos.

202
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,494
- Pavla?
- Markos.

203
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,871
- Kaplitt?
- Blanc.

204
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,666
- Vendegast?
- Blanc.

205
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,918
- Balfour?
- Blanc.

206
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,212
- Creusot?
- Blanc.

207
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,798
- Alberta?
- Markos.

208
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,299
Thank you.

209
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,926
Griffith?

210
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,346
Griffith?

211
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,390
We're at the end.

212
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,271
Mother Markos.

213
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,527
I abstain.

214
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,988
I vote for Markos.

215
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,824
Markos wins by three.

216
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,617
It is decided.

217
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,871
Mother Markos will remain in control.

218
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,456
Let no one's vote be held against her.

219
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,959
And let the will
of the majority proceed.

220
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,461
Long life to Markos.

221
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,922
Long life to Markos!

222
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,599
...there is no information yet

223
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,559
on whether the
hijackers will pilot

224
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,686
the Lufthansa flight
to a fourth destination

225
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,939
or what is the condition of
the 91 hostages still presumed aboard.

226
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,360
Yesterday, one of the Palestinian
hijackers issued official demands

227
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,238
including the release of all
Red Army Faction members

228
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,116
incarcerated at Stammheim prison...

229
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,794
Stop dreaming, sweetheart.

230
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,881
Mother asked for you.

231
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,592
She has to know that we can move ahead

232
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,677
now that last night's
business is behind us.

233
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,389
You all knew my concerns
about Patricia.

234
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,225
What happened to Patricia was ghastly.

235
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,979
But now that we voted
Mother wants to try again.

236
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,147
And soon.

237
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,944
The question isn't just
who to try next.

238
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,907
We have to make sure
the ritual will work

239
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,659
with whichever girl we choose.

240
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,496
Mother trusts you already have
ideas on this subject.

241
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,332
Maybe Sara could be a good option.

242
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:24,129
Yes. It was right to send her
to collect the American girl.

243
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,008
Sara is a good ambassador
for the company.

244
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,594
She's made a home here, hasn't she.

245
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,930
She feels good here.

246
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,264
Loved.

247
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,232
Uncle Josef.

248
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,234
Good morning my dear!

249
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,860
Are you going to your country house?

250
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,028
Yes.

251
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,238
I'm freezing my ass off.

252
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,156
I'll go to the university later
on, with Clara.

253
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,408
Who is speaking?

254
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,493
Lacan.
Lacan!

255
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,127
- Good morning Doctor Klemperer!
- Good morning.

256
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,586
Are you going to your country house?

257
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,683
Next stop Friedrichstrasse.

258
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,101
This train terminates here.

259
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,146
Please have your identification ready
to enter East Berlin.

260
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,291
Anke, look...

261
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,585
everything is full of leaves again!

262
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:15,425
I swept them away just last Tuesday.

263
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,698
Bedrooms are on
the second floor.

264
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,886
Why don't you try speaking
to me like you love me?

265
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,139
For a change.

266
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,102
This is my room.

267
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,605
And here...

268
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,190
is yours.

269
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,984
We're neighbors.

270
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,237
You can knock on the wall
if you ever need anything.

271
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,686
Miss Sesame?

272
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,921
Doctor, I got the semolina
from Frau Meier.

273
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:21,385
They are demonstrating again for
the release of the R.A.F. terrorists.

274
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,308
Before the war Germany
had the strongest women...

275
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,853
like your wife Anke.

276
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,231
Wasn't she strong Doctor?

277
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,152
First rehearsal
in the Iris Studio today,

278
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,154
in twenty minutes.

279
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,782
You're to lead
your own stretches today.

280
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:45,826
Good morning.

281
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,703
- Good morning.
- Hello.

282
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,664
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

283
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,583
- Hi.
- Good morning. Good morning.

284
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,335
How's your knee? Okay?

285
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,255
It's wonderful you're here.

286
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,465
Thank you.

287
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,309
We have some happier
company business today.

288
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,394
We have a new dancer.

289
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,064
This is Susie Bannion,
who's joining us from America.

290
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,192
I was privileged to witness
her audition yesterday.

291
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,320
We are very lucky to have her.

292
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,698
Would you like
to say something, Susie?

293
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,244
I don't know.

294
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,662
Hello.

295
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,791
I feel like
I'm not even here yet.

296
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,376
I don't know.

297
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,919
You join in
whenever you feel ready,

298
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,504
but there's no rush.

299
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,507
Welcome to our little family.

300
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,759
I'm Susie.

301
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,761
Hi. Hi.

302
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,680
All right,
so for today's rehearsal,

303
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,892
I want to pick up exactly
where we left off with Volk.

304
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,352
I've spoken to Olga,

305
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,729
and she's going to dance
Patricia's part.

306
00:30:55,854 --> 00:31:00,525
And, Sara, I'd like you
to dance Olga's part.

307
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,444
Is everyone happy with that?

308
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,321
Okay.

309
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,823
Good.

310
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Music off, please.

311
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,005
One moment.

312
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,216
Okay, so...

313
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:27,469
And one, and two, and three.

314
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,137
You pull it from the ground.

315
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,764
All right? Gravity, remember.

316
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,766
And everybody from here, please.

317
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,892
And Tanner.

318
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,436
One and two and three.

319
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,688
And one, and two, and three.

320
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,483
And one, and two and three...

321
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,373
This is shit.

322
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,210
- Such shit.
- Okay.

323
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,879
Why don't we all break
for ten minutes.

324
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,133
You can't even be bothered
to respect your own lies.

325
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,218
Miss Ivanova!

326
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,595
No, no, no, no, no, it's okay.

327
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,055
Let's face this.

328
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,600
Patricia is gone, Olga.

329
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,019
We don't know where.

330
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,063
If she's gone into hiding,
she wouldn't have told us,

331
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,774
- would she?
- She would have told someone.

332
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,401
We know that she had dealings

333
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,403
with people
who are interested in targets.

334
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,321
And we know
there was another bomb

335
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,614
in Kreuzberg last night.

336
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,782
She wouldn't do that.

337
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,994
She wanted to live her beliefs.

338
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,996
Who doesn't admire that?

339
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,833
And there's so much to change
in the world.

340
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,043
If she wants to live in a cellar

341
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,713
filling bottles with petrol,
that's her choice.

342
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:48,175
And who won't be heartbroken
if she's shot by police?

343
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,136
You manipulate everything.

344
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,600
She didn't trust you
because you're hypocrites.

345
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,352
Will you take Olga
to her room, please, Tanner?

346
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,355
No, Miss Tanner!

347
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,525
Call Olga a cab.

348
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,402
She's had enough.

349
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,821
And is going to pack her things

350
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,074
and get the fuck out
from this box of rabies!

351
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,385
I'm sorry about that.

352
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,889
It's a hot thing we do.

353
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,856
Okay, so... who will dance
the protagonist?

354
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,359
Sonia?

355
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,903
I can't. Not yet.

356
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,696
Caroline?

357
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,869
Very well. We'll manage.

358
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:01,540
I suggest that we all
take it from the top.

359
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,083
I'll dance.

360
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,843
I know it.

361
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,387
It's in the documentary.

362
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,889
I-I've seen it a hundred times
at the library.

363
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,562
Sweetheart,
we rehearsed this piece

364
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,398
for ten months
before we performed it.

365
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,068
I've seen it in person, too.

366
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,113
First do it alone, then.

367
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,616
We don't want to put
the others at risk.

368
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,660
The last thing we need

369
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,664
is someone to get kicked
in the ribs.

370
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,378
All right?

371
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,779
Miss Marks, music please!

372
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,978
Okay, stop. Stop, stop.

373
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,730
Stop.

374
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,065
All right.

375
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,608
Clear your head.

376
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,818
I want you to start over.

377
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,363
Have you stretched?

378
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,323
This is no joke.

379
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,772
Olga.

380
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,524
Are you alright?

381
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,005
Olga.

382
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,925
Come over here.

383
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,677
Come.

384
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,929
Come to me.

385
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,307
Over here.

386
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,584
Remember, you start
on one with the music,

387
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,629
and if you feel ill
at any time, just stop.

388
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,130
You start here.

389
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,340
And...

390
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,112
Lauter!

391
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,997
Bravo. Bravo, Susie.

392
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,006
It'll pass.

393
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:51,175
You're not the first dancer
who lost the room.

394
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,348
I'm not usually dizzy.

395
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,683
An occasional collapse

396
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,686
is a vocational hazard,
I'm afraid.

397
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,939
I-I didn't...
I didn't collapse.

398
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:08,484
You're on the floor, and that's
not where the dance ends.

399
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,115
I was trying not to throw up
in your studio.

400
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,658
Susie, it's fine.

401
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,618
It was wonderful.

402
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:21,164
Sara, can you take her
to her room, please?

403
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,624
You can rest
for the rest of the day.

404
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,848
- How enlightening.
- Okay, come on, girls.

405
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,516
Let's go.

406
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,019
And one, and two, and three.

407
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,437
And...

408
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,322
No, Susie.

409
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,158
We have to study America.

410
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,910
I said no.

411
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,998
Susanna.

412
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:55,591
Everything fine?

413
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,231
Attention, please.

414
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,277
Don't hurt Olga...

415
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:46,494
Slowly...

416
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,673
Out!

417
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,784
Police station, good evening.

418
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:13,164
Good evening. I'm reporting
a young woman who may be missing.

419
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,834
She couldn't have known
what she was doing.

420
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,587
She just carried more
of our intention than we expected.

421
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:24,508
We also let ourselves
get angry with Olga.

422
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,761
I could feel it.

423
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,472
But the girl is a natural.

424
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,974
Like Patricia. Only clean somehow.

425
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:34,518
She may be more
what we're looking for,

426
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,687
even than Sara.

427
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,482
Are we saying that?

428
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,401
No. Not yet.

429
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:51,327
You don't look better.

430
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,788
Or are you this pale
all the time?

431
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,791
I will leave you.

432
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,752
Good night.

433
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:09,970
The Amish split

434
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,056
from the Mennonites
in the 17th century.

435
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,100
They were worried the Mennonites

436
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,935
were becoming too liberal.

437
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,063
"They"? Not "we"?

438
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:22,400
You've left religious thinking
behind you, then?

439
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:25,611
And you're not comfortable
talking about these things.

440
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,571
I don't know why we are.

441
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,698
It's difficult not
to be curious about you.

442
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,201
In two days, you've auditioned,

443
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,246
been accepted and danced a lead.

444
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:38,124
How did your journey
towards us begin?

445
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,750
I went to New York.

446
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,670
To the Martha Graham Center.

447
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:45,256
I saw you there three times.

448
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,508
I went once by bus,

449
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,136
then I hitchhiked the other two.

450
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,555
That's risky.

451
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,932
Were you punished?

452
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,560
Yeah.

453
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,980
But I felt I had to see you.

454
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:12,199
What did it feel today

455
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:15,828
to dance Volk in front
of the one who made it?

456
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,289
No, no.
That's a vain question.

457
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,458
Let me ask you another.

458
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:24,837
When you were dancing,
what did it feel like...

459
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,340
inside you, inside your body?

460
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:38,476
It felt like what I think
it must feel like to fuck.

461
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:40,728
You mean to fuck a man?

462
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:42,813
No, I...

463
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,815
was thinking of an animal.

464
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,783
You looked...

465
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,006
I'm going to ask Caroline
to work on your jumps with you.

466
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:12,218
Yours are nowhere near
good enough yet.

467
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,720
We'll have to build you up.

468
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,973
So that I can dance
the protagonist

469
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,892
when you perform it?

470
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,646
I'll need to see you dance at
this level time and time again.

471
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,606
I can do it.

472
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,365
Olga made Volk seem
like such heavy lifting.

473
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,952
She never understood
the heart of Volk.

474
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,373
She lacked conviction.

475
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:44,583
I'm relieved she's gone.

476
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,421
Thank you for your help
with that.

477
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,930
Madame Blanc...

478
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:03,394
wants me to dance
the protagonist in Volk.

479
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:09,316
I didn't think it was
gonna be like this.

480
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,236
She's so kind.

481
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,363
That's wonderful.

482
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,827
Are you all right?

483
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,665
I'm fine. I was just...

484
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:30,296
I was just thinking about
what Olga said in rehearsal.

485
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,006
About Patricia.

486
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,550
What do you mean?

487
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:38,637
She was active
in some political groups.

488
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,975
No one knows where she is,
really.

489
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,352
If she's all right.

490
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,813
Was it true...

491
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,898
what Olga said?

492
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,153
Yes.

493
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:57,031
Patricia didn't trust
the matrons.

494
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,784
And I never understood why.

495
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,958
If I asked you for a favor
tomorrow, would you do it?

496
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,710
Yes.

497
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,927
We might get caught.

498
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:22,139
Okay.

499
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,311
Mother. Mother.

500
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,480
Mother.

501
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,650
Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother.

502
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,276
Mother. Mother.

503
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:20,614
Susanna.

504
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,160
More.

505
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:29,957
Harder.

506
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,164
Come inside, hurry up!

507
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:14,918
What do you want?

508
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:18,172
We need to talk to someone in charge.

509
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,465
Miss Markos.

510
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,218
About a girl named Patrizia...

511
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,308
Patricia Hingle.

512
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,733
Someone named Blanc then?

513
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,403
I'm she.

514
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,240
Why don't you come in?

515
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,743
Please...

516
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,370
Follow me.

517
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,466
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

518
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,051
Good morning.

519
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,814
Yeah, I know. It's crazy.

520
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,816
Okay, well, let's meet soon.

521
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,158
Yeah, no, I'm-I'm... I'm ready.

522
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,327
I'm almost out the door.

523
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,204
Okay. Yeah.

524
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,790
- I'll see you soon.
- Marketa.

525
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,503
- Marketa, come on.
- I'll see you soon.

526
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,048
Come on.

527
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,651
Come, come, come.

528
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,164
Are you sure no one's coming?

529
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,375
I'm sure. Don't worry.

530
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,295
Nobody comes here
during the weekend.

531
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,699
Patricia's isn't here.

532
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,951
Try looking for Olga's.

533
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,037
Olga...

534
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,789
She's not here.

535
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,126
I just need a number.

536
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,503
For her parents or someone
who can tell me for sure

537
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:05,255
she is or isn't in Berlin.

538
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,862
How odd.

539
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,160
1961.

540
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,455
1955.

541
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,084
1949.

542
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,462
It's bizarre.

543
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,969
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...

544
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,668
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...

545
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,642
There's nothing.

546
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,227
Come on.

547
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,608
Sit down.

548
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,906
This morning,

549
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:58,118
we turn our instincts inward.

550
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,411
Miss Millius, Miss Mandel,

551
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,788
can you close the mirrors,
please?

552
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:02,914
Miss Marks, no music.

553
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,801
I want to start work
on a new piece.

554
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:18,263
A piece about rebirths.

555
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,975
The inevitable pull
that they exert

556
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,020
and our efforts to escape them.

557
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:28,940
We'll learn it now, but, Susie,

558
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,027
you will improvise freely
at its heart.

559
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,904
I'm interested
in your instincts here.

560
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:47,501
The piece will be called
Wieder Öffnen.

561
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,294
Open Again.

562
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:50,837
"Let's go.".

563
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:01,598
One, two, three, four.

564
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:05,352
One, two, three, four.

565
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:09,022
One, two, three, four.

566
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:12,609
One, two, three, four.

567
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:16,238
One, two, three, four.

568
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:19,282
One, two, three, four.

569
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,703
One, two, three, four.

570
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:27,249
One, two, three, four.

571
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:30,418
One, two, three, four.

572
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:31,711
One...

573
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:34,631
...two, three, four.

574
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:38,218
One, two, three, four.

575
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:41,930
One, two, three, four.

576
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,559
One, two, three, four.

577
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:49,187
One, two, three, four.

578
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,983
One, two, three, four.

579
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:56,611
One, two, three, four.

580
01:00:56,736 --> 01:01:00,031
One, two, three, four.

581
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:02,033
One...

582
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:23,471
You should have told me
she was coming.

583
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,141
She wanted to feel Susie for herself.

584
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,727
So you put her...

585
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,021
in a storage closet?

586
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,439
Under the floor?

587
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,818
Mother wanted it.

588
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,738
I thought we agreed to stop
using that title.

589
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,658
If Markos really were
one of the Three Mothers

590
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,493
we wouldn't be in
this situation.

591
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:50,415
You should have told Markos about
Miss Bannion yourself.

592
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,542
Now Mother wants her.

593
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:57,881
Are we going to waste
another girl so quickly?

594
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:00,800
Everyone voted.

595
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,970
You are not the light
we chose to follow.

596
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:08,516
If Markos wants this girl,
you must prepare her.

597
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:09,684
And does she?

598
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:10,852
Yes!

599
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,272
Markos will live.

600
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:18,485
We found the girl in time.

601
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:35,126
I won't rush again.

602
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:39,214
I will tell Markos
when the girl is ready.

603
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:43,927
Alright...

604
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,930
Did something happen?

605
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:50,308
To you, during it?

606
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,853
N-No.

607
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:55,855
Did you... did you...

608
01:02:56,982 --> 01:03:00,277
Did you feel something there?

609
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,072
Someone?

610
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,116
Or just something.

611
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:08,994
What made you say that?

612
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,870
I don't know.

613
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,126
Am I confusing you?

614
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,920
No, it's...

615
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,424
It's odd. It's the...

616
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,551
It's the sort of thing
Patricia would say.

617
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:26,803
It's bizarre.

618
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,555
Come on.

619
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,765
Let's get changed,
or Sonia will leave without us.

620
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,392
I've got a dress you can wear.

621
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,102
Double caposhi.

622
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,119
Susie!

623
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,382
Susie!

624
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:19,898
I want to bring in a custom
from the old ways.

625
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:21,608
What do you have in mind?

626
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:23,318
A witness.

627
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:26,071
One of our new friends
from the police?

628
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:30,116
Why not one of those
young things at the window?

629
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,660
You're forgetting we already
have a witness.

630
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,830
The old man who sent us
the Polizei in the first place.

631
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,665
He will be our witness.

632
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,919
Yes. Not one of our girls.

633
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:43,046
It would make any of them insane.

634
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,048
I agree.

635
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,926
And it's good for Susie
to see us like this.

636
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,928
That we're still part of the world.

637
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,848
Maybe she even senses
what we want of her.

638
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,559
She senses a lot.

639
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,020
You can see her eyes shine with it.

640
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,190
I see it every night.

641
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,609
When I send her our dreams.

642
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,326
Is it true?

643
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,029
Is it true?

644
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:38,745
I know who I am!

645
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,832
I know who I am!

646
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:49,547
It's all right.

647
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,424
It's okay.

648
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,009
Is she all right?

649
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,302
It's just a nightmare.

650
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,387
The Markos Company special.

651
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,431
I'm surprised it took this long.

652
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,934
Hey, let me know
if she needs a Valium.

653
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:11,569
She's right. I dreamt
of hairballs in toilets

654
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:15,073
for three weeks before I got
a decent night of sleep here.

655
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,909
Move over.

656
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:32,590
I've only ever slept
in bed with my sister.

657
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,842
We're sisters now.

658
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,067
In a statement released
to the press moments ago,

659
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:35,903
the hijackers' leader Martyrer Mahmud

660
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:39,824
demands Baader, Ensslin, Moeller
and the other RAF prisoners

661
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,995
be released from Stammheim prison
and flown to Mogadishu.

662
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:45,663
Good morning.

663
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:51,502
I'd like to talk to Detective Glockner
or Detective Albrecht.

664
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,048
Your name?

665
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:57,967
One moment.

666
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,180
...as proof of their intentions

667
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:04,098
the hijackers threw
down onto the tarmac

668
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:08,269
the body of the flight's pilot
Jurgen Schumann.

669
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,481
He had been shot in the head.

670
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,942
Agent Glockner's office
is on the right.

671
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:17,570
Have a seat here,
they'll call for you.

672
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:33,002
Terror suspect.
Do you know this woman's name?

673
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,254
Doctor Klemperer?

674
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,173
Please, come inside.

675
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,677
We were shown every room.

676
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:43,429
We didn't see anything
worth remembering.

677
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:48,476
They are professional performers.

678
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,479
Illusion is their craft.

679
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,232
It's not your place
to speculate on that.

680
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:04,534
Did you speak to the woman
called Markos?

681
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,994
Patricia referred to her as

682
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:09,247
Mother Markos.

683
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:13,209
She had a delusion about this woman

684
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:16,796
leading a coven there.

685
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,093
She had this delusion for months.

686
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:25,638
Do you believe in witches, Doctor?

687
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,515
No.

688
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,310
But I believe that...

689
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:35,982
people can organize themselves
to perpetrate crimes

690
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,151
and call it magic.

691
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:41,863
That I can believe.

692
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:47,326
Do you understand the kind of week
we are having, Doctor?

693
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,335
Detective Glockner.

694
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:02,425
This isn't the first time we've met.

695
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:07,847
You were on the police force
in Friedenau, weren't you?

696
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:13,603
You helped me
to try to locate my wife.

697
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,980
Your wife also went missing?

698
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:20,193
Two years before the Russian charge.

699
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,866
1943.

700
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:32,705
From the records, you helped me
cross off Poland.

701
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:37,710
I'm still grateful.

702
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:50,097
And one, and two, and three.

703
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:52,141
And one, and two, and three.

704
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,685
And one, and two, and three.

705
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:57,563
And one, and two, and three.

706
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:59,690
One, and two, and three.

707
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:02,193
And one, and two, and three.

708
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,821
And one, and two, and three.

709
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,198
And one, and two, and three.

710
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,116
That's-that's okay.

711
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,037
Do you want to do the jumps?

712
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,415
Okay.

713
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,459
And...

714
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,670
one, and two, and three.

715
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:23,214
And one, and two, and three.

716
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,382
No.

717
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,133
Elbows higher.

718
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,635
All right, one moment.

719
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,804
Susie, part of the jump
is muscle,

720
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,430
and that will develop
as you condition,

721
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:33,683
but you seem to have
an aversion to them,

722
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:35,309
and I don't quite see why.

723
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,603
Are you so happy
to be stuck to the earth?

724
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,690
There's a yield before the push,

725
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:42,984
which I don't think
you're quite understanding.

726
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:47,029
Caroline. Could you come and do
a series for us, please?

727
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,254
Thank you.

728
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,340
And now you.

729
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,577
What I really want
is to be on...

730
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:37,121
on the floor right now, anyway.

731
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,040
Well, of course.

732
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:41,584
That's because you're mistaking
physical weakness

733
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,753
with artistic preference.

734
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,838
And because you're tired.

735
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,884
At this point,

736
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,803
the jumps are opposing
the pull of the structure,

737
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,430
but...

738
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:57,183
it's soon for that,
don't you think?

739
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:03,230
The floor work is... is keeping
the other dancers pushed down.

740
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:06,651
So this...

741
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,528
this could echo that...

742
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:17,912
...on-on a slightly higher
point of elevation.

743
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:22,041
If I stay close
to the ground now

744
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:25,962
and go straight into the jumps
where you have them later,

745
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:29,799
then that's more to the point.

746
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:32,510
The resistance is more...

747
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,220
emphatic.

748
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,305
Right?

749
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:44,188
I don't know how aware you are

750
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:48,234
of what times we lived through
here 40 years ago.

751
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:53,447
Out of which
this piece was made.

752
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:57,201
We learned at great cost
through those years

753
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,579
the value of the balance
of things.

754
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:05,876
Every arrow that flies
feels the pull of the earth,

755
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:09,088
but we must aim upwards.

756
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:11,424
We need to get you in the air.

757
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,361
Leave her, leave her,
leave her, leave her, leave...

758
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:54,216
Caroline don't be afraid.

759
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:57,344
Everything will be alright.

760
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:58,679
Yes?

761
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,897
She hit her head hard.

762
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,398
I heard it. I hope...

763
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:11,025
Miss!

764
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:13,944
One moment please!

765
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:23,370
I am... I'm looking for
a dancer from your company.

766
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:25,790
Who are you looking for?

767
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,167
You are Sara.

768
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,129
Yes.

769
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,506
May I help you?

770
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:36,759
I am a friend from Patricia.

771
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:39,804
When the deadline arrived,

772
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:41,514
the hijackers informed the police

773
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:46,185
they had poured all the flight's
duty-free alcohol over the hostages

774
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,479
and were set to ignite them.

775
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:51,565
But when they were told
the West German Government

776
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:54,568
was in the process of releasing
the Stammheim prisoners,

777
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:58,322
they agreed to extend the deadline
to after midnight.

778
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:01,075
I don't know what
to make of any of this.

779
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,119
I know the kind of thing
she was involved with,

780
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:04,787
but I can't see how any of this

781
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,205
could be happening
inside the company.

782
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:10,000
Well, she describes...

783
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:13,295
something like
a revolutionary organization

784
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,132
in a crisis of leadership.

785
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:19,510
With Markos very ill...

786
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:22,388
I live there.

787
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:23,722
I have friends there.

788
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:26,183
I don't see any evidence
of this at all.

789
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:27,685
No one has ever approached me

790
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,104
or any of the other girls,
as far as I know.

791
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,815
Read this.

792
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,191
What is this?

793
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,902
This is Patricia's diary.

794
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,239
Mother Markos.

795
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:43,075
Mother Meinhof.

796
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,077
The dance rehearsal.

797
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,620
Political action.

798
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:48,664
These two areas
in Patricia's life

799
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:51,375
were of equal importance.

800
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,545
This is how
transference happens,

801
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:58,174
how delusion is made.

802
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:00,176
Delusion, Sara,

803
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:03,596
is a lie that tells a truth.

804
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:06,265
This says "witches."

805
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:12,313
Maybe Patricia's fantasies
about witches,

806
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:18,402
they are her way of processing
some other form of intrigue.

807
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:23,365
The company's a family.

808
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:26,035
There's a lot of love there.

809
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,745
Love and manipulation...

810
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:31,790
they... they share houses
very often.

811
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:34,752
They are frequent bedfellows.

812
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:37,254
Sorry, I don't see this.

813
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,718
Eat.

814
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:46,180
Eat.

815
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,233
Only...

816
01:18:57,358 --> 01:19:00,778
maybe the police,
they missed something.

817
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:05,908
And Patricia,
she did spoke of...

818
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:09,411
whole hidden areas
of the building.

819
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:13,207
Actual rooms that are secret.

820
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,756
I don't want
to be disrespectful...

821
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,467
I don't...
but you're asking me,

822
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:24,969
- and I'm telling you...
- Please.

823
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:26,428
It's a dance company.

824
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,764
We're not talking
about anything else.

825
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:30,099
Sara.

826
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:33,852
Please, only look closer.

827
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:35,604
Thank you for caring
for Patricia,

828
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,940
but I hope you don't come again.

829
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:01,797
- Good night.
- Good night.

830
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,590
Sara, hurry up.

831
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:06,260
I'm tired. I need the bathroom.

832
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:11,640
- Good night, Doll.
- Good night.

833
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:23,652
She hasn't come back yet?

834
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,744
Maybe she's seeing somebody.

835
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,624
Part of the issue always

836
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,377
is not being able
to see your body in space.

837
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:45,257
One angle in one mirror
or on film is not enough.

838
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:47,217
Movement is never mute.

839
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:48,927
It is a language.

840
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:50,763
It's a series
of energetic shapes...

841
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,514
...written in the air

842
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,351
like words forming sentences.

843
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:57,311
Like poems.

844
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:00,481
Like prayers.

845
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:04,902
Spells?

846
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:10,240
When you jump,
it's not the height

847
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:13,160
but the space beneath you
that matters.

848
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,830
Every leap into the air
must be a coup de foudre.

849
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,212
I don't understand.

850
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:26,131
A strike of lightning.

851
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:29,051
A bolt of love, in fact.

852
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:33,972
That's beautiful.

853
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:37,559
There are two things
that dance can never be again:

854
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:40,604
beautiful and cheerful.

855
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,981
Today, we need to break the nose

856
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:44,817
of every beautiful thing.

857
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:46,944
And if you're going
to be a dancer,

858
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:49,488
you must learn French.

859
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,156
Try not to worry.

860
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,909
Blanc is working on the new approach.

861
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:57,246
How could we have known
what would happen with Patricia?

862
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,541
What we are attempting
hasn't been done in living memory.

863
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,877
How do we know it will work at all?

864
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:06,713
If it killed that girl

865
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:09,425
it may kill any girl we try.

866
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:10,801
She's not wrong.

867
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:12,386
Patricia was unwilling in the end.

868
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,513
Blanc believes that was the reason.

869
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,266
We shouldn't have forced it.

870
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:19,351
She didn't want to be a vessel.

871
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,437
We wanted to bring her into our power

872
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,772
but she wanted to blow up
department stores instead.

873
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:25,899
What a fool, that girl.

874
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:28,652
When you dance
the dance of another,

875
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:32,364
you make yourself
in the image of its creator.

876
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,408
You empty yourself

877
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,076
so that her work can live
within you.

878
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:37,703
Do you understand?

879
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,664
Yeah.

880
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,291
You're in a company now.

881
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:43,792
You have to find
your right place.

882
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:45,377
You have to decide...

883
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:48,464
what is it you want to be
for this company?

884
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:50,299
Is it the head?

885
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:52,217
The spine?

886
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:54,386
The sex?

887
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,013
The heart?

888
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:57,806
The hands.

889
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,561
I want to be
this company's hands.

890
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:09,234
Higher.

891
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:11,153
Higher. Higher.

892
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:13,322
Higher.

893
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:16,325
Higher! Higher.

894
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,701
Higher.

895
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:22,372
Higher, higher, higher.

896
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:23,999
Higher.

897
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:29,838
Higher.

898
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,592
Higher. Higher.

899
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:37,387
Higher. Higher. Higher.

900
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:46,438
Sometimes I only need
to be told twice.

901
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,953
How do we know no one's planning
to blow us up, too?

902
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:04,456
Patricia might have said anything
to anyone about us.

903
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,875
As she did with the old man.

904
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,377
You're right.

905
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:10,379
We cannot despair.

906
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:12,256
We have time.

907
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:14,007
How much time?

908
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:17,761
If Mother dies
before Blanc can deliver us Susie

909
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:19,596
this company is finished.

910
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:23,016
Markos will hold on, for us.

911
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:24,977
You've seen her.

912
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:27,980
Her body's a prison!

913
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:32,109
Disease on top of disease.

914
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,152
How long can she possibly...

915
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:50,604
33, 34, 35, 36,

916
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:53,649
37, 38, 39,

917
01:25:53,774 --> 01:25:55,651
40, 41.

918
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:03,241
57, 58, 59,

919
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:06,036
60, 61, 62, 63.

920
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:19,591
65, 64, 63, 62.

921
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:30,894
23, 22, 21.

922
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:45,867
Ten, nine, eight,

923
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:47,953
seven, six.

924
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:50,747
Two, one.

925
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:37,956
We couldn't stop her!

926
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:40,750
She was too fast with the knife!

927
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,588
She's cold!

928
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:49,968
Come with me! Quickly!

929
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:10,447
Patricia wrote about

930
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:14,326
"Three Mothers" lost in time,

931
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:18,496
predating all Christian
invention.

932
01:30:18,622 --> 01:30:21,791
Pre-God. Pre-Devil.

933
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:26,254
Mother Tenebrarum,
Mother Lachrymarum

934
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:29,257
and Mother Suspiriorum.

935
01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:34,888
Darkness, Tears and Sighs.

936
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:38,350
I saw images of that last night.

937
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:40,727
In porcelain,
these very fine things.

938
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,021
You can tell they have money.

939
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:49,569
Patricia said that Markos

940
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:52,072
claims to be one of the Three.

941
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,908
But there is dissent
amongst them.

942
01:30:55,033 --> 01:31:00,080
She wrote about "Markosites"
and "Blancites."

943
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:02,874
In-Internal division.

944
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:06,044
Madame Blanc's involved in this?

945
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:15,553
Do they believe they're witches?

946
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:21,309
You can give someone
your delusion, Sara.

947
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:23,728
That's religion.

948
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,732
That was the Reich.

949
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:31,319
The Reich had these things.

950
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:34,280
Insignia.

951
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:37,325
Esoteric ritual.

952
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:41,162
These "Mothers," yeah,
they could be

953
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:44,541
code names for founding members

954
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:47,210
with metaphoric histories.

955
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,212
I don't know.

956
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:53,425
But I do know you are living
with dangerous people.

957
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:56,261
Patricia could still be in...

958
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:57,804
...in there.

959
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,102
They could be holding her.

960
01:32:04,227 --> 01:32:05,687
In the building.

961
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:08,314
Well, I cannot promise
that the authorities

962
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,443
will come back to
inspect a cabinet

963
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:15,697
full of porcelain
after all that has happened.

964
01:32:15,822 --> 01:32:18,199
But we can try.

965
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:21,411
And in the meantime,
you must take care of yourself.

966
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,748
Perhaps you should leave.

967
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:26,416
You have somewhere you can go?

968
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:30,378
I'll figure it out.

969
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:33,339
And I think you should
put this back.

970
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:36,051
Or better still,
you leave it here.

971
01:32:37,594 --> 01:32:40,764
Not good for them
to know that you have it.

972
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:43,159
Judith, let me do it.

973
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:45,453
Here you are.

974
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:15,108
Is anyone among you sick?

975
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:18,278
Let him call for the elders
of the church;

976
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:20,613
and let them pray over him,

977
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:24,534
anointing him with oil
in the name of the Lord.

978
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:30,081
And the prayer of faith
shall save him that is sick,

979
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:33,251
and the Lord shall raise him up;

980
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:37,297
and if he has committed sins...

981
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:39,549
My daughter.

982
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,929
...they shall be forgiven him.

983
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:50,476
My last one.

984
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:56,065
She's my sin.

985
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:59,652
She's what I smeared
on the world.

986
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:11,164
First of all it's very important,
do you remember this?

987
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:16,085
- You must use your center.
- Yes.

988
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:19,464
Your center is here
and you must create a space.

989
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:22,592
Now I understand.

990
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:24,469
Wait, wait.

991
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:26,679
Alright.

992
01:35:28,848 --> 01:35:31,643
Suspended, suspended in the air.

993
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:35,647
Remember to create a space.

994
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:44,155
You're making some kind
of deal with them.

995
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,950
I don't know
what you're talking about.

996
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:49,452
How can you know

997
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:51,829
what they're going
to ask you in return?

998
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:54,749
Sara, whatever you have
in your mind,

999
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:57,961
nothing is wrong.

1000
01:35:58,086 --> 01:36:00,713
You just haven't
seen the bill yet.

1001
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:03,967
Nothing's wrong.

1002
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:09,639
Special forces
in the German Federal Police

1003
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:12,267
stormed Lufthansa 181 in the night

1004
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,894
and killed three of the four hijackers

1005
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:18,606
ending five days of terror
for the passengers of the flight.

1006
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:21,484
In the morning,
in the high-security wing

1007
01:36:21,567 --> 01:36:23,194
of the Stuttgart-Stammheim
prison

1008
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:27,448
three of the five RAF prisoners
were discovered dead

1009
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:35,039
in an apparent suicide pact made upon
hearing of the news from Mogadishu.

1010
01:36:35,498 --> 01:36:38,418
Protesters are congregating
around Germany

1011
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:42,338
chanting that the prisoners
were instead assassinated.

1012
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:47,552
Federal Police President Horst Herold,
went so far as to declare

1013
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:50,513
"The Baader-Meinhof era is done."

1014
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:04,485
What's the matter with you?

1015
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:15,038
You don't be so afraid
about the white, Susie.

1016
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:19,125
They need to see you
from the very back row.

1017
01:37:26,883 --> 01:37:28,885
Where is Sara?

1018
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:32,513
She came early in the morning,

1019
01:37:32,638 --> 01:37:34,974
did her makeup and left.

1020
01:37:36,976 --> 01:37:38,895
Good evening, welcome.

1021
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:40,813
Here you are.

1022
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:43,358
First time here, isn't it?

1023
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:46,486
Please, come.

1024
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:56,996
Yes, thank you. Have fun.

1025
01:37:57,914 --> 01:37:58,956
Straight ahead.

1026
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:26,442
Girls!

1027
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:28,236
Vier minuten!

1028
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:30,613
Four minutes!

1029
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:35,576
Vier minuten!

1030
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:38,079
Tak, tak.

1031
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:21,372
Is it true?

1032
01:39:21,497 --> 01:39:22,665
Sara.

1033
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:25,710
Sara.

1034
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:27,712
Patricia.

1035
01:39:29,088 --> 01:39:31,757
Patricia. Patricia.

1036
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:34,343
- I knew it.
- They'll kill him.

1037
01:39:34,469 --> 01:39:36,387
I'm sorry it took me so long.

1038
01:39:36,512 --> 01:39:37,889
I'm so sorry.

1039
01:39:38,014 --> 01:39:41,225
What did they do to you?

1040
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:43,561
I wake up here every day.

1041
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:45,688
It's all over now.
I'll get you out.

1042
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:48,524
The performance
is starting upstairs.

1043
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:51,402
Everyone will be looking
the other way.

1044
01:39:51,527 --> 01:39:53,946
Get up. Get up.

1045
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:55,072
Patricia!

1046
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:57,825
- Patricia, get up.
- I'm trying.

1047
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,827
Get up.

1048
01:40:11,297 --> 01:40:14,383
Get it off of me!

1049
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:16,052
Sara!

1050
01:40:49,919 --> 01:40:53,339
Markos! Markos! Markos! Markos!

1051
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:06,978
Good evening.

1052
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:11,315
We created this piece in 1948.

1053
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:15,903
Marketa.

1054
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:17,280
Where is Sara?

1055
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:18,573
Sara?

1056
01:41:18,698 --> 01:41:19,824
I don't know.

1057
01:41:19,949 --> 01:41:21,951
- Is she upstairs?
- No. I looked.

1058
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:24,203
Just dance as if she's with you.

1059
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:35,089
Sara!

1060
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:45,891
This is the last time we are performing it.

1061
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:50,605
The Markos Dance Company presents...

1062
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:52,732
...Volk.

1063
01:41:56,027 --> 01:41:57,903
Go!

1064
01:43:51,142 --> 01:43:52,435
No.

1065
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:54,478
My darling...

1066
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:57,356
- No.
- Sara, lie still.

1067
01:43:57,481 --> 01:43:59,608
- No!
- Sara.

1068
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:06,240
Please. Please...

1069
01:44:10,578 --> 01:44:13,748
No! No!

1070
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:16,143
The girl is ready, Blanc.

1071
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:18,145
It's time.

1072
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:22,204
Please, remain seated!

1073
01:48:22,454 --> 01:48:23,956
Stay calm and remain seated.

1074
01:48:24,039 --> 01:48:26,458
We will continue the performance soon.

1075
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:31,088
Sorry...

1076
01:48:32,089 --> 01:48:33,590
She broke her leg.

1077
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:35,759
Come on.

1078
01:48:39,722 --> 01:48:40,973
Attention, please.

1079
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:46,311
We decided otherwise.
Thank you, for your understanding.

1080
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:50,774
Everything will be fine.

1081
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:55,070
Please, leave the room.
We have to cancel the performance.

1082
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:05,330
Everything will be fine.

1083
01:49:05,748 --> 01:49:07,583
Everything will be fine.

1084
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,334
Everything will be fine, Sara.

1085
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:12,254
Good. That's good.

1086
01:49:51,126 --> 01:49:51,960
ARYAN PAPERS

1087
01:50:28,872 --> 01:50:31,333
I'm sorry I went off book.

1088
01:50:36,672 --> 01:50:38,924
This can't happen again.

1089
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:43,804
You're only just starting
to understand, Susie.

1090
01:50:43,929 --> 01:50:45,430
We brought Sara back upstairs

1091
01:50:45,556 --> 01:50:47,558
to try to complete
the performance in time,

1092
01:50:47,683 --> 01:50:50,394
but then you derailed it.

1093
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:52,729
Did I hurt those people?

1094
01:50:52,855 --> 01:50:54,106
Not this time.

1095
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:56,066
They saw a dance.

1096
01:50:56,191 --> 01:50:57,734
That's all.

1097
01:50:59,278 --> 01:51:02,322
It's all a mess, isn't it?

1098
01:51:02,447 --> 01:51:03,991
The one out there.

1099
01:51:04,116 --> 01:51:06,535
The one in here.

1100
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:11,540
The one that's coming.

1101
01:51:15,085 --> 01:51:17,713
Why is everyone

1102
01:51:17,838 --> 01:51:21,341
so ready to think
the worst is over?

1103
01:51:39,651 --> 01:51:41,778
I could
explain everything to you.

1104
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:47,576
I think it would be wrong,
though.

1105
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:55,334
You don't want to make me choose.

1106
01:51:56,084 --> 01:51:57,544
Because you love me.

1107
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:03,842
Close your eyes.

1108
01:52:08,513 --> 01:52:10,224
No more dreams tonight.

1109
01:52:11,433 --> 01:52:12,893
I'll make...

1110
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:16,438
I'll make sure of it.

1111
01:52:21,109 --> 01:52:24,071
One, two, three, four...

1112
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:39,962
Tonight.

1113
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:43,632
It must happen tonight.

1114
01:53:54,911 --> 01:53:58,832
But Doctor, the soup is ready!

1115
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:28,987
You can eat and drink

1116
01:54:29,404 --> 01:54:30,614
all that you want!

1117
01:55:24,376 --> 01:55:26,628
- Thank you.
- For you.

1118
01:55:28,463 --> 01:55:30,215
Can I bring you something to drink?

1119
01:55:47,607 --> 01:55:51,736
Congratulation!

1120
01:56:24,144 --> 01:56:25,479
Who's there?

1121
01:56:46,082 --> 01:56:47,334
Josef.

1122
01:56:52,339 --> 01:56:53,465
Anke?

1123
01:57:06,811 --> 01:57:08,438
Karol told them about us.

1124
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:13,318
I had only a few minutes to get out.

1125
01:57:16,947 --> 01:57:18,615
I got to the apartment

1126
01:57:18,949 --> 01:57:20,992
but my papers weren't anywhere.

1127
01:57:22,536 --> 01:57:24,412
Then I traveled by foot

1128
01:57:24,704 --> 01:57:25,789
to Teplitz

1129
01:57:26,331 --> 01:57:29,000
where I planned to ask Mirek's family
to take me in.

1130
01:57:29,584 --> 01:57:32,087
But I was caught at the border

1131
01:57:32,504 --> 01:57:34,548
and taken to Terezin Camp.

1132
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:38,343
No one believed me
that I was born in Gartz.

1133
01:57:39,761 --> 01:57:43,014
After the Liberation
I made my way to Zurich.

1134
01:57:44,391 --> 01:57:46,101
And then to Bristol.

1135
01:57:46,935 --> 01:57:48,645
I've made...

1136
01:57:49,563 --> 01:57:52,649
...a new life there.

1137
01:57:54,484 --> 01:57:56,069
A lovely life.

1138
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:00,490
I was told

1139
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:03,535
you'd died in the invasion.

1140
02:01:03,381 --> 02:01:06,509
Look how dirty he made it!

1141
02:01:06,968 --> 02:01:08,011
Have pity!

1142
02:01:08,178 --> 02:01:09,387
Have pity!

1143
02:01:09,554 --> 02:01:12,056
What reason is there to pity you?

1144
02:01:12,307 --> 02:01:15,685
You had years to get your wife
out of Berlin

1145
02:01:15,894 --> 02:01:18,271
before the arrests began.

1146
02:01:19,397 --> 02:01:21,941
When women tell you the truth

1147
02:01:22,108 --> 02:01:24,068
you don't pity them.

1148
02:01:24,235 --> 02:01:27,781
You tell them they have delusions!

1149
02:04:05,730 --> 02:04:08,524
I'm not guilty...

1150
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:13,112
I am innocent!

1151
02:04:14,364 --> 02:04:17,700
I remember everything!

1152
02:04:18,993 --> 02:04:22,288
I am innocent!

1153
02:04:26,542 --> 02:04:30,004
Are there guilty men in Berlin?

1154
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:31,881
Everywhere!

1155
02:04:32,173 --> 02:04:36,260
But I am not one of them!

1156
02:04:41,057 --> 02:04:42,767
I'm ready, Madame.

1157
02:05:09,627 --> 02:05:10,920
You look afraid.

1158
02:05:13,089 --> 02:05:15,008
She's afraid for you.

1159
02:05:31,399 --> 02:05:35,194
There will be nothing of you

1160
02:05:35,319 --> 02:05:38,781
left inside.

1161
02:05:38,906 --> 02:05:44,287
Only space for me.

1162
02:05:44,412 --> 02:05:47,206
I came here for this.

1163
02:05:49,876 --> 02:05:51,669
You've all waited long enough.

1164
02:05:53,004 --> 02:05:56,549
It is happening.

1165
02:05:57,633 --> 02:05:59,719
It is happening!

1166
02:06:42,929 --> 02:06:46,099
Do you come here willingly?

1167
02:06:50,812 --> 02:06:53,022
You must have no doubts, Susie.

1168
02:06:53,147 --> 02:06:55,525
If you do, I can take you back.

1169
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:57,860
I can take all of this
from your head.

1170
02:06:57,985 --> 02:07:00,530
You can forget everything.

1171
02:07:03,407 --> 02:07:05,701
I want this to be pure.

1172
02:07:05,827 --> 02:07:09,747
We all know what you want.

1173
02:07:14,168 --> 02:07:17,338
This isn't vanity.

1174
02:07:17,463 --> 02:07:20,716
This isn't...

1175
02:07:20,842 --> 02:07:23,427
art!

1176
02:07:24,554 --> 02:07:26,305
There is something wrong here.

1177
02:07:26,430 --> 02:07:28,224
Can you not feel it?

1178
02:07:28,349 --> 02:07:30,059
This is not right.

1179
02:07:30,184 --> 02:07:31,811
We have to stop this now.

1180
02:07:31,936 --> 02:07:34,647
We have been on

1181
02:07:34,772 --> 02:07:36,858
two sides of this

1182
02:07:36,983 --> 02:07:39,318
for too long now.

1183
02:07:39,443 --> 02:07:41,571
Markos! Markos! Markos!

1184
02:07:41,696 --> 02:07:45,324
Markos! Markos!
Markos! Markos!

1185
02:07:45,449 --> 02:07:47,660
Markos! Markos! Markos!

1186
02:07:47,785 --> 02:07:49,287
Markos! Markos!

1187
02:07:49,412 --> 02:07:52,081
Markos! Markos! Markos!

1188
02:07:52,206 --> 02:07:54,667
Markos! Markos!

1189
02:08:25,823 --> 02:08:29,327
If you accept me,

1190
02:08:29,452 --> 02:08:35,166
you must put down
the woman who bore you.

1191
02:08:36,918 --> 02:08:40,755
Think of that false mother now.

1192
02:08:53,059 --> 02:08:55,561
Reject her.

1193
02:08:55,686 --> 02:08:58,272
Expel her.

1194
02:09:02,235 --> 02:09:07,907
You have the only mother
you need here.

1195
02:09:08,032 --> 02:09:11,077
Death to any other mother.

1196
02:09:11,202 --> 02:09:12,119
Say it.

1197
02:09:13,496 --> 02:09:17,124
Death to any other mother.

1198
02:09:47,488 --> 02:09:49,532
Who are you?

1199
02:09:55,705 --> 02:09:57,748
For whom were you anointed?

1200
02:09:57,873 --> 02:10:01,335
Which of the Three Mothers?

1201
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:03,796
Mother...

1202
02:10:08,384 --> 02:10:11,637
Mother Suspiriorum.

1203
02:10:14,765 --> 02:10:17,226
I am she.

1204
02:10:55,639 --> 02:10:56,432
Markos.

1205
02:11:11,572 --> 02:11:12,448
Markos!

1206
02:11:48,776 --> 02:11:49,652
Markos!

1207
02:11:51,946 --> 02:11:52,822
Markos.

1208
02:11:59,829 --> 02:12:03,332
Death to any other mother.

1209
02:12:03,457 --> 02:12:04,500
Markos.

1210
02:12:11,715 --> 02:12:12,675
Markos!

1211
02:12:25,062 --> 02:12:25,771
Markos!

1212
02:12:33,529 --> 02:12:34,613
Markos!

1213
02:13:23,454 --> 02:13:28,167
I am the Mother.

1214
02:13:49,647 --> 02:13:51,607
What do you ask?

1215
02:13:51,732 --> 02:13:53,567
To die.

1216
02:13:57,821 --> 02:13:59,615
Mother.

1217
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:01,659
Mother, we're so tired.

1218
02:14:09,833 --> 02:14:11,544
What do you ask?

1219
02:14:11,669 --> 02:14:13,837
To die.

1220
02:14:13,963 --> 02:14:16,090
I want to die.

1221
02:14:25,432 --> 02:14:27,393
Sweet girl.

1222
02:14:29,228 --> 02:14:31,355
What do you ask?

1223
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:35,526
Die.

1224
02:15:02,970 --> 02:15:05,514
Dance. Dance.

1225
02:15:05,639 --> 02:15:07,975
Keep dancing.

1226
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:09,893
It's beautiful.

1227
02:15:11,145 --> 02:15:12,813
It's beautiful.

1228
02:15:14,189 --> 02:15:16,150
It's beautiful.

1229
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:31,975
Watch your step.

1230
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:34,561
Here. Yes.

1231
02:16:34,687 --> 02:16:36,188
It's been snowing.

1232
02:16:36,689 --> 02:16:38,357
Everything is pretty.

1233
02:16:39,066 --> 02:16:42,361
And again, slowly.

1234
02:16:42,986 --> 02:16:45,072
Yeah, okay.

1235
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:47,199
Good. This is good.

1236
02:18:42,981 --> 02:18:44,775
My God, what a night.

1237
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:47,694
I definitely drank
too much wine.

1238
02:18:47,778 --> 02:18:50,155
And what about the song
of Tanner and Balfour?

1239
02:18:50,322 --> 02:18:53,534
It was fantastic!

1240
02:18:59,206 --> 02:19:01,750
- Salam aleikum, Miss Boutaher!
- Aleikum salam. Good morning.

1241
02:19:01,917 --> 02:19:05,712
- Good morning.
- Caroline. How is Sonia?

1242
02:19:07,297 --> 02:19:09,007
Good morning.

1243
02:19:11,134 --> 02:19:13,846
Girls, I need you to listen.

1244
02:19:13,971 --> 02:19:16,557
I have such sad news

1245
02:19:16,682 --> 02:19:19,184
and I want you to be brave when you hear it.

1246
02:19:19,434 --> 02:19:21,562
Madame Blanc has left the company.

1247
02:19:44,626 --> 02:19:46,211
Be brave.

1248
02:19:46,712 --> 02:19:48,881
How will we go on?

1249
02:19:49,089 --> 02:19:50,716
Be brave girls!

1250
02:19:52,259 --> 02:19:53,594
Be brave.

1251
02:20:04,271 --> 02:20:07,357
ARYAN PAPERS

1252
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:45,312
This is not the way to do it, Doctor.

1253
02:20:45,562 --> 02:20:48,065
I nearly called the police myself.

1254
02:20:48,148 --> 02:20:49,775
You need to take care of yourself.

1255
02:20:49,983 --> 02:20:51,777
You haven't been well, I know!

1256
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:53,403
But it cannot go on like this...

1257
02:20:56,114 --> 02:20:58,450
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

1258
02:20:58,617 --> 02:20:59,993
Wait outside.

1259
02:21:26,812 --> 02:21:29,940
I regret what my daughters
did to you.

1260
02:21:31,775 --> 02:21:34,444
I wasn't in a position
to prevent it.

1261
02:21:39,366 --> 02:21:42,369
I believe you deserve
to know the truth.

1262
02:21:51,253 --> 02:21:55,590
Your wife did try
to make it south

1263
02:21:55,716 --> 02:21:57,509
to Teplice.

1264
02:21:59,386 --> 02:22:03,140
She was apprehended
by border guards

1265
02:22:03,265 --> 02:22:06,852
in the woods
just outside of Glashutte.

1266
02:22:09,813 --> 02:22:15,152
She was then taken
to Theresienstadt camp.

1267
02:22:17,612 --> 02:22:20,365
She lived there for 20 days.

1268
02:22:21,825 --> 02:22:26,872
On the 11th of November, 1943,

1269
02:22:26,997 --> 02:22:31,668
the commandant of the camp,
a man named Burger...

1270
02:22:33,378 --> 02:22:36,256
...ordered all 40,000
detained there

1271
02:22:36,381 --> 02:22:40,927
stand outside in the cold
for a census.

1272
02:22:47,225 --> 02:22:49,603
Hours and hours passed.

1273
02:22:52,898 --> 02:22:55,442
Some hundreds died of exposure.

1274
02:23:03,825 --> 02:23:07,329
Your wife had two women
with her as she died.

1275
02:23:09,247 --> 02:23:12,417
Women she had befriended,

1276
02:23:12,542 --> 02:23:16,296
who made her feel
that she was not alone.

1277
02:23:22,969 --> 02:23:26,598
Her final thoughts...

1278
02:23:26,723 --> 02:23:29,309
were of a birthday

1279
02:23:29,434 --> 02:23:34,356
when you took her
to a concert as a surprise.

1280
02:23:34,481 --> 02:23:37,567
Chopin and Brahms.

1281
02:23:41,780 --> 02:23:44,533
It was the first time
you held her hand.

1282
02:23:49,955 --> 02:23:53,500
She was cold when she died.

1283
02:23:56,336 --> 02:23:58,380
But she wasn't afraid.

1284
02:24:02,717 --> 02:24:05,512
She was thinking only of you.

1285
02:24:24,322 --> 02:24:26,950
Of Anke Meier...

1286
02:24:28,869 --> 02:24:30,954
...of Patricia Hingle...

1287
02:24:32,289 --> 02:24:33,874
...of Sara Simms...

1288
02:24:38,003 --> 02:24:40,380
...of Susanna Bannion,

1289
02:24:40,505 --> 02:24:44,885
of all the women
of your undoing...

1290
02:24:47,804 --> 02:24:50,891
...every memory will vanish.

1291
02:24:54,519 --> 02:24:57,981
They will melt away in the sun

1292
02:24:58,106 --> 02:25:00,692
and be gone.

1293
02:25:02,819 --> 02:25:06,239
We need guilt...

1294
02:25:07,199 --> 02:25:08,450
...Doctor.

1295
02:25:10,744 --> 02:25:12,162
And shame.

1296
02:25:13,872 --> 02:25:15,498
But not yours.

1297
02:25:29,971 --> 02:25:31,848
Doctor.

1298
02:25:31,973 --> 02:25:33,558
Doctor.

1299
02:25:45,153 --> 02:25:46,321
Who are you?

1300
02:25:46,613 --> 02:25:47,948
Frau Sesame!

1301
02:25:49,991 --> 02:25:51,660
- Yes?
- Yes.

1302
02:26:23,483 --> 02:26:25,235
- How late is it?
- Around 11 o'clock.

1303
02:26:25,986 --> 02:26:27,862
- Could you call her?
- Okay, I will.

1304
02:26:28,113 --> 02:26:29,614
Go to your mom.

1305
02:26:31,866 --> 02:26:33,326
Come Lutz!

1306
02:26:33,493 --> 02:26:34,911
- Yes.
- Bye.

1307
02:26:35,745 --> 02:26:39,958
Hey, it's Alexandra.
What about dinner?

1308
02:26:42,711 --> 02:26:44,254
Bye, Alex.
