1
00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:02,403
(Music playing)

2
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:06,474
(Camera shutter clicking)

3
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:11,779
* In the city

4
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:16,150
* Feel the heartbeat,
you're not complete *

5
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:19,187
* Let it all go

6
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:29,163
* In the shadows
from the streetlights *

7
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:31,565
* Feel the spaces

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,502
* Moving in slow...

9
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,771
(Beeping)

10
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:42,310
- * In the city...
- (computer beeping)

11
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,853
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey.
How you doing?

12
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,822
Let me guess... you
have to work late tonight

13
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,824
And you're not gonna
be back until after 10:00.

14
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,660
I'm so sorry.
I know I promised to take
you out to dinner tonight,

15
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,862
But we just got slammed.

16
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,398
There is some Chinese food
in the 'fridge, though.

17
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,200
So how was school?

18
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:09,537
It was incredible.

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,440
My teacher loved
the high contrast photo
I took downtown.

20
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:14,475
Oh, yeah,
those were great.

21
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,545
And she thinks
that I should send it
to that festival in Paris.

22
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,314
- Wow!
- Let's go to Europe.

23
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:23,151
- You and me?
- Yeah, we can go
to the festival,

24
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:25,853
Pick up the award
and then hit the road
in a convertible.

25
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,855
Ha! Okay, I'm in.

26
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:30,824
Now we just need
to win the lottery
to pay for the trip.

27
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:33,894
Hey, did you pick up
the mail today?

28
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,797
- Uh-uh.
- Well, why don't
you go downstairs

29
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,867
And, you know,
see what's down there?

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,403
No, you did not
get that lens that
I was looking at.

31
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,205
That is way too expensive.

32
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:47,508
Hey, let me decide
what is too expensive.
Just go.

33
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,877
Check the mail.

34
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,152
- Open the door.
Open the door.
- No!

35
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,754
- Oh, my God. Jodi!
I'm calling 9-1-1.
- You come here right now!

36
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,823
Get out
of the apartment now!

37
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,892
- Man: Come here!
- Jodi: Please let me go!
Get out!

38
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,927
- Jodi!
- Mom!

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,829
My daughter is getting
attacked right now.

40
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,399
- 52822 Loma Verde Avenue...
- What you doing, huh?

41
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,167
Apartment 18,
West Hollywood.

42
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:17,405
Oh, my God!
Send somebody fast.
Jodi, no! No!

43
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:19,773
Stop it!
Get away from her!

44
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,676
Oh, my God. No!

45
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,710
(Sighs) Okay,
this is the last of it.

46
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:03,317
Oh, I cannot wait to show you
the new bedspread I bought.

47
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:04,585
Come on.

48
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:32,246
I think I have
unpacked enough for us

49
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,383
To at least have
breakfast tomorrow.

50
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,886
I have to get up at
4:00 so I can be at
the hospital by 6:00,

51
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,488
So I'm gonna go to bed.

52
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:41,955
Good night, baby.

53
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,627
Did you lock
the back door?

54
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,028
Yeah.

55
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,930
What about the windows?

56
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,701
Yes, honey.

57
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,869
Hey...

58
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,440
This place is gonna
be really great.

59
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:03,010
I don't know how
I'm gonna pay for it,
but it's worth it.

60
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,779
This summer we're
gonna have so much fun.

61
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:09,783
And then in the fall,
you are gonna go to
a terrific new high school

62
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,420
And meet a bunch
of new friends.

63
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,592
Sweetie, the police shot
that awful man.

64
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:21,695
He can't hurt you
anymore.

65
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:25,032
This is a safe neighborhood.

66
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,000
We're gonna be okay here.

67
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,972
- Good night.
- Don't stay up too late.

68
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,687
(Wind blowing)

69
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,492
(Thumping)

70
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,370
(Tapping)

71
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,410
Mom. Mom, wake up.

72
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,944
Andrea:
What's the matter?

73
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,913
- Did you hear that?
- (tapping continues)

74
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,782
I think that's
the wind, honey.

75
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,585
No, there's someone
at the door.

76
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:20,888
(Sighs)
Do you realize
what time it is?

77
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,657
Put that down.

78
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,496
(Tapping)

79
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:33,867
See, it's nothing
to worry about.

80
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,771
Will you sleep
in my room tonight?

81
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,574
Sure, honey.

82
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,724
(Music blaring
over radio)

83
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:59,860
- Man: Fire it up.
- (engine turns over)

84
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,601
- Man #2: Yeah!
- (engine revving)

85
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:10,070
- What do you think?
- Give it a little more gas.

86
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,573
Hey, give it
a little more gas.

87
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,876
- (Engine revs)
- Nice.

88
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,546
- How's that?
- (camera whirring)

89
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,980
- A little more.
- (camera shutter clicks)

90
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,716
- Now we're
getting somewhere.
- Yeah!

91
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,419
Man #3:
Come on, honey,
you don't have to leave.

92
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:28,021
Are you sure we can't
talk about this?

93
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,657
Come on.

94
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,994
Out of my way.

95
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,063
- Man #2: How's that?
- Man: That's good.

96
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,866
That's good!
That's working now.

97
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,802
- (Engine revving)
- There. Nice, nice! I love it,
I love it, I love it!

98
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,171
- Awesome!
- Man #2: Whoo-hoo!

99
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,441
That's what
I'm talking about.

100
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,645
Man:
Uh-oh, turn it off.

101
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,849
- Man: You owe me 100 bucks.
- Woman: Nick.

102
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,085
Aw, jeez.
Mrs. Miller.

103
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:01,489
I know what you're gonna say
and I'm done for the day.

104
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,758
It's not about today.
It's about tomorrow
and the next day

105
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,794
And the next month.
You see, I work from home.

106
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,497
So I need to be able
to have a phone conversation
with a client

107
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,832
- and be able to hear them.
- I'm sorry, all right?

108
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,534
I'm just doing a favor
for some friends of mine.

109
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,902
- A favor?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,604
You're running a business
out of your garage.

111
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,606
- I'm not running a business.
- Come on, Nick.

112
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,073
Woman #2: Aunt Lisa, relax.
It's not a big deal.

113
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,743
Look at this place.
I mean, are you kidding me?

114
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,112
Do you have any idea what
you're doing to the property
values around here?

115
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,047
Nick: I'll tell you this.
This is one piece
of property

116
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,650
That you don't have your
hands on yet, Mrs. Miller.

117
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,186
All right, I've asked you
nicely. Next time I'm
calling the cops.

118
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,123
Go right ahead.
I'm shaking in my boots,
Mrs. Miller.

119
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,892
- Bossing everybody around.
- Lisa: Ugh, this is
ridiculous.

120
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,563
- Man: I agree.
- Hey, how are you?

121
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,732
- Great.
- Glad to hear it.

122
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,908
- Lisa: Kristen.
- Coming.

123
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,816
Hey.

124
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,054
- (Indistinct chatter)
- (shutter clicking)

125
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,140
(Gasps)

126
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,298
(Whirring and clicking)

127
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,227
(Telephone ringing)

128
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,337
- (beeps)
- Hello?

129
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,107
Hello?

130
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,282
(Beeps)

131
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:08,308
(Doorbell rings)

132
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,015
(Doorbell continues
ringing)

133
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,332
(Jodi sighs)

134
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:40,007
Hi, I'm Lisa Miller.
I live across the street.

135
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,342
I just wanted to welcome
you to the neighborhood.

136
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,411
Hi, I'm Jodi.

137
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,780
Hi, Jodi.
I made you some cookies.

138
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:48,782
Thank you.

139
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,018
So are your parents home?

140
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,886
I would like to say hello.

141
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,922
It's just my mom.
She's at work.

142
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,158
Okay, well, tell her
I dropped by, okay?

143
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,896
Are you all right?

144
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,399
- Sweetie, what's the matter?
- Someone just stole
my camera.

145
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,002
What? Are you serious?

146
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,904
This area is so safe.

147
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,306
I mean, we never have
burglaries out here.

148
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,442
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little
freaked out right now.

149
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,045
Don't apologize.

150
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,113
You wanna come
over to my house?

151
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,215
You can stay with us
until she gets back.

152
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,452
No, that's very kind of you,
but I'll be okay.

153
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:29,422
Listen, why don't
you and your mom
come over tomorrow?

154
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,458
You can have lunch with
me and my niece Kristen.

155
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,861
You'd like her.

156
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,796
Okay, I'll ask my mom.

157
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,097
Great.

158
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,100
Just let me know.
Here's my number, okay?

159
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,234
Thank you.

160
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,190
Andrea: Are you sure
you didn't misplace it?

161
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,159
I mean, look at this.

162
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,428
Yes, I looked everywhere.

163
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,496
I think we should
call the police.

164
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,933
Let's get this place
cleaned up.

165
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,435
If we still don't find it,
I'll buy you a new one.

166
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,470
Mom, I don't want you
spending that kind of money.

167
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,841
- Don't worry.
I can afford it.
- No, you can't.

168
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,176
You're always saying
how expensive it is
to live here.

169
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,512
I'm telling you,
somebody came into
the backyard.

170
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:03,516
We've only been here
two days and already you're
saying we've been robbed?

171
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,053
Yes, and I want
to report this.

172
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,922
First, let's clean up
the house, okay?

173
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:12,125
Okay, what time do they
want us over for lunch?

174
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,029
(Music blaring
over radio)

175
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,272
(Engine revs)

176
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,574
So where did you live
before you moved here?

177
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:31,511
- West Hollywood.
- Oh, I love West Hollywood.
Why'd you guys leave?

178
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,812
No!

179
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,582
We had a condo.

180
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,118
We needed more space.

181
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,889
- Mm-hmm.
- So, Kristen, I take it
you live in LA?

182
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,024
- No, I live here.
- Oh, I thought you were

183
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,859
Just visiting
your Aunt Lisa
for the summer.

184
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,228
This is my home now.
My parents are gone.

185
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,431
Her mom passed away
last year.

186
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,101
I am so sorry.

187
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,870
I asked Kristen
if she would wanna
come live with me,

188
00:13:56,904 --> 00:14:00,540
And well,
I'm just glad
she said yes.

189
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,877
You know, you should
take Jodi with you
next weekend.

190
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,445
That's a great idea.
You'd love it.

191
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,514
What?

192
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,350
Our church.
They have this retreat.
It's up Angeles Crest.

193
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:14,021
It's so fun.
They have hiking and volleyball
and all the fun stuff.

194
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,223
Yeah, the van's gonna pick
me up next Saturday morning.

195
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,625
Okay, I'll think about it.

196
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,928
You should go.
That sounds really great.

197
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,629
Mom, I said I will
think about it.

198
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,232
- (Engine turns over)
- Andrea: Okay.

199
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,268
(Engine revving)

200
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:31,038
Not again.

201
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,405
Have you talked
to his parents?

202
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,241
He's a single father.

203
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:37,344
He's in the oil
business in Dubai.

204
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,914
That's enough.
I am so sorry, Andrea.

205
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:44,017
- Aunt Lisa,
what are you doing?
- Calling the police.

206
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,886
(Touch tones beeping)

207
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,993
(Engine revving)

208
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,701
Hi, I'm the one
that called the police.

209
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,403
- I'm Lisa Miller.
- Officer Weiland.

210
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,505
How you doing today?
You Nick?

211
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,574
- Yeah.
- Nick, you wanna step out
of the car for me?

212
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,476
I'm not trying to bother
anybody. I'm working
on my buddy's car.

213
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,145
- He's always a bother.
Always.
- What?!

214
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,314
That guy Nick
stole my camera.

215
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,649
He was the only one around
when I noticed it was missing.

216
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,052
You should go tell the cop.

217
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,621
I'm not gonna introduce myself
to our next door neighbor

218
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,590
By accusing him
of burglary.

219
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,593
Just ask the cop to come over
and we can talk in private.

220
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,129
It doesn't have
to be a big deal.

221
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,098
- Please?
- Okay.
- Thanks.

222
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,465
Weiland: Son, I need
you to calm down.

223
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,401
Just take it
from me, okay?

224
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,003
And if we get
any more complaints,

225
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,437
I'm gonna have to
come back here
and arrest you.

226
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,106
- Andrea: Excuse me, Officer.
- Nick: Yeah, yeah, whatever.

227
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,175
Miss Miller,
stay back, please.

228
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,412
I just wanted to talk to
you about something that
happened in our house.

229
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,448
- We live across the street...
- So you think somebody
stole your camera?

230
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:51,051
Yesterday I was
outside taking pictures

231
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,453
And the phone rang,
so I put the camera down,

232
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,623
Came in to answer it,
and when I went back out,
it was gone.

233
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,692
- What kind of camera is it?
- A DSLR with a 75 to 300
zoom lens.

234
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,629
Is it anything like
that camera out there?

235
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,631
What?!

236
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,534
Officer, I am so sorry
to bother you.

237
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,669
Not a problem.
I hope she gets
some great pictures.

238
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,205
- Thank you.
- Okay? All right.

239
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,678
- Well, that was embarrassing.
- Mom, I checked the backyard.

240
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:22,015
I checked the house, everywhere.
I swear it wasn't there.

241
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:25,385
- What do you think happened?
- I think Nick stole it
and then put it back.

242
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,755
Why would anybody
do that?

243
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,258
Sweetie,
it's a new house.

244
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,394
It's a new neighborhood.
You're still recovering.

245
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,263
What happened to you
at our old apartment,

246
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,331
It's gonna take you
a while to get over that.

247
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,703
I still see him.

248
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,206
- In your dreams?
- In my mind.

249
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:50,710
Every time
I go in a dark room
or I open a door,

250
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:55,682
It's like he's gonna
be there, but he's not.

251
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,417
I never should have
worked late that night.

252
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,586
- Don't say that.
- No, I'm your mother.

253
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:03,656
I'm supposed to protect you.
I should have been there.

254
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:09,629
I have to do some shopping.

255
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,264
Do you wanna go with me?

256
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,500
I just wanna
check my camera.

257
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,168
Okay, sweetie.

258
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:40,793
(Touch tones beeping)

259
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:44,564
(Rings)

260
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,434
Man: Hello?

261
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,369
Hello.

262
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,441
Um, who am I speaking with?

263
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,110
This is Nick.
Who is this?

264
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,545
(Beeps)

265
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,316
(Cell phone rings)

266
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,452
- Hey.
- Mom, I can prove it.

267
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,820
- Prove what, honey?
- That Nick stole my camera.

268
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,690
Remember when I got a call
and there was nobody
on the line?

269
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,126
- Well, I checked
the phone records...
- (knock on door)

270
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,161
Hold on.

271
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,333
Oh, my God.
He's at the door.

272
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,369
You don't have to open it.
Do you want me to come home?

273
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,704
I will if you want me to.

274
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,274
In fact, honey,
I'm just gonna come home.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

275
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:30,443
- (Knock on door)
- No, it's okay.
I'll just see what he wants.

276
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,279
- Jodi.
- Mom, don't worry.
I'll be all right.

277
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,880
(Clicks)

278
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,883
You called my house?

279
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,319
Did you call me?

280
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,155
Why did you steal my camera?

281
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,891
Because you were taking
pictures of me and you
didn't ask me if you could.

282
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,626
How did you get
our house number?

283
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,396
The internet.
Reverse address.

284
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,233
So you called our house,
made me go inside to answer
it, and then hopped the fence

285
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56,436
- and stole my camera?
- That's right.

286
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,471
- You're good.
- Then you put it on the porch

287
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,240
- and made me look
like an idiot.
- No, no, no.

288
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,742
Well, I didn't mean
to make you look
like an idiot.

289
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,312
But if that happened,
I'll consider it a bonus.

290
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:09,882
- I'm going to tell
the cops what you did.
- Wow! First Lisa and now you.

291
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,419
Terrific. Go right ahead
and call the cops.

292
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:15,822
And I'll show them the pictures
you took of me, half naked.

293
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,726
Yeah, I downloaded
your camera files
onto my hard drive.

294
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,929
While I'm at it, I'll show
the rest of the neighborhood
the pictures you took of them.

295
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,798
Ted's wife across the street,
she's a lawyer.

296
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,734
She'd love to see them.

297
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,271
So you sure you wanna
call the cops?

298
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,374
I just wanna call it even.

299
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,743
Even.

300
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,480
I'm Nick.

301
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,486
(Sighing)

302
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,427
(Horn honks)

303
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,633
- Kristen: Hey.
- Nick: Okay,
Tuesday sounds good.

304
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,436
- Yeah.
- Woman: This is gonna
be so much fun.

305
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,307
- Nick: Yeah, 11:00 a.m.
- Kristen: Hey!

306
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,242
- I'll be there.
- Man on phone: Talk
to you later.

307
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:10,343
Bye.

308
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,398
(Cell phone rings)

309
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,569
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey, what are you doing?

310
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,771
- Just testing out my new lens.
- Cool!

311
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,474
Well, I'll be done
at the hospital
in about an hour.

312
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,476
- You sure everything's okay?
- (camera shutter clicks)

313
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,845
- Everything's fine, Mom.
- Call me if you need me.

314
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,447
- All right.
- Bye.

315
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,782
- Bye.
- (beeps)

316
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,498
(Beeps)

317
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,314
(Bell ringing)

318
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,928
I think I just saw someone
in your house.

319
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,397
- What?
- I just saw someone.

320
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,799
Or I thought I did.
Downstairs.

321
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,468
Hold on.
You were watching my house?

322
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:42,969
I was taking pictures
of the street.

323
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,338
I saw you in your bedroom,
and I looked in the window

324
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:47,607
And I saw a
shadow of someone.
Are you serious?

325
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,542
Yes, let's just go to my
house and call the police.

326
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:51,678
No, no, no,
hang on. Hang on.
Just give me a second.

327
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:53,846
Wait, wait, Lisa, don't.

328
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,361
Are you sure you saw someone?

329
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:10,963
Yes, it was a shadow.

330
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,599
Male, female?

331
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,967
I don't know.
The shades were closed.

332
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,037
Wait here.
I'll check the garage.

333
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,007
There's nobody down here.
Are you sure?

334
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,945
Yes, I'm sure.
At least I thought...

335
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:02,048
Look, let's just
get out of here.

336
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,016
- I'm gonna check upstairs.
- I'm calling the cops.

337
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,918
No, no, no,
just give me a minute.

338
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:37,016
(Sighs)
There's nobody here.

339
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,886
Oh, look, look at this.

340
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,625
Is this what you saw?

341
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,162
I must have walked
in front of it.

342
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,698
Maybe.

343
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,168
I'm sure that's what you saw.

344
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,806
I'm sorry to bother you.

345
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,841
Oh, no, no.
Honey, it's okay.

346
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,711
I really appreciate
your concern.

347
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:20,112
- Man: See you later.
- Bye, guys.

348
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,981
Woman: Bye, Kristen.

349
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,182
Hey.

350
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,617
Hey, Jodi, how's it going?

351
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:26,853
Good.
Did you have fun?

352
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:29,155
Yeah, it was so funny.
You have to come with us

353
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,624
The next time we go on one
of these camping trips.

354
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,294
Aunt Lisa, I'm back.

355
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,364
They did this improv show.
It was so hysterical.

356
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:41,801
This guy talks totally monotone
like he's got one brain cell

357
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,336
And he has a scene partner
who was talking a mile a minute.

358
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,773
Aunt Lisa, are you upstairs?

359
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,175
Anyway, they're on this gurney
and they're acting like
he's giving birth

360
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,911
Completely in drag.
It was so funny.

361
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,916
Jodi.

362
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,187
Jodi, where'd you go?

363
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:13,199
- Oh, my God.
- Kristen: Are you up here?

364
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:17,670
- Don't come in.
- Oh, my God.

365
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:19,305
- Aunt Lisa, what's wrong?
- 9-1-1. What's your emergency?

366
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,340
No, what's wrong with her?
(gasps)

367
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,442
(Stammers)
I need an ambulance.

368
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:27,847
- 8672, Via Colinas
in Santa Clarita.
- Aunt Lisa, wake up.

369
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,348
My friend, she's bleeding.
She's not breathing.

370
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,751
We need an ambulance
right now. Hurry!

371
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,427
(Police radio chatter)

372
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:52,705
Detective, I saw something
on Saturday night

373
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:55,241
That I think you
should know about.

374
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:59,445
I got here as fast
as I could. Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

375
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:00,947
I was so worried about you.

376
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,449
Hi. Detective Franklin.

377
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:05,918
Andrea Allen,
Jodi's mother.

378
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:07,386
As you were saying?

379
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,256
I saw someone in the house.

380
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,725
I think it was an intruder.

381
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,393
- About what time?
- Around 10:00.

382
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,228
I was across the street
in my room

383
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:18,831
Taking some pictures
of the neighborhood.

384
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,266
I saw Lisa
in the upstairs window

385
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,202
And then I saw somebody else
in the downstairs window.

386
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,906
You were taking photographs
of peoples' homes at night?

387
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,440
Yeah, is that illegal?

388
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,843
It's an invasion
of privacy.

389
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:34,781
Next time you do that,
you should ask your
neighbors for permission.

390
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:38,818
Anyway, is that the window
with the shades closed?

391
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:42,121
I saw a shadow,
a silhouette.

392
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,924
That's a long ways
to see at night.

393
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,993
I know what I saw.

394
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:49,028
Well, did you take a
picture of the shadow?

395
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,997
No, I didn't.

396
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,434
Okay, Jodi, so when you
saw this shadow person,
what did you do then?

397
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,804
I ran over
and I rang the doorbell.

398
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:00,539
Lisa answered, and we
looked around, but we
didn't find anybody.

399
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,041
Why didn't you
call the police?

400
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,810
Because Lisa didn't
want me to.

401
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,912
She wasn't worried like I was.

402
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:08,915
I mean, I even tried
calling her this morning
and nobody answered.

403
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:11,450
And that's why I waited
for Kristen to get home.

404
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,920
I watched the house all day
and Lisa never came out.

405
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:16,422
Thanks. I'll mention
that in my report.

406
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,494
I think the guy
next door did it. Nick.

407
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,563
Now is that the same
Nick Thompkin

408
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,266
That's running a business out
of his house without a permit?

409
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,135
Yeah.

410
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:32,138
Lisa called the cops on him
and Nick got really mad at her.

411
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:34,974
If anyone from the neighborhood
would kill her, it would be him.

412
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,944
Well, we'll talk to him.
We'll be talking to
everybody on this block.

413
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:40,880
Detective, what do
you think happened?

414
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,815
Well, we don't have
the whole story yet.

415
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:45,317
There doesn't seem to be
any sign of forced entry.

416
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:47,253
As far as I can tell,
nothing is stolen.

417
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,822
So right now it looks
like she slipped and fell.

418
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:51,590
- You're kidding, right?
- Jodi, don't.

419
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,061
When forensics
comes back with their
report in a couple days,

420
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:57,830
We'll have
a better assessment.

421
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:03,970
Oh, my God,
Kristen, I'm so sorry.

422
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,905
Come here. Ohh.

423
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:09,508
Kristen:
Can I stay with you guys
just for a few days?

424
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:13,312
Yes, of course.
You stay as long
as you need to, okay?

425
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:34,400
Hi, I'm Detective Ng,
Metro Homicide.

426
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,402
- You live here?
- Yeah.

427
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:39,005
We're getting statements
from a number of people.

428
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,607
- Do you mind if we ask
you a few questions?
- (Nick clears throat)

429
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:47,079
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Come in. Right this way.

430
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,953
Andrea:
I'm not going
into work tomorrow, okay?

431
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,888
I'm gonna be here all day.

432
00:30:55,922 --> 00:30:57,456
Thank you, Ms. Allen.

433
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:02,594
(Kisses)
You try and get some rest.

434
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:07,533
- I wanna talk to her.
- Let her rest.

435
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,069
But, Mom.

436
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:12,905
I'm telling you,
somebody was in her
house that night.

437
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,941
Shh.
Keep your voice down.

438
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:17,876
She doesn't need to hear that.
She's suffering enough.

439
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,916
And why did you incriminate
the boy across the street?

440
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:28,120
- Well, what if he did do it?
- Then the police will find
evidence to support that.

441
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:30,456
Will you please
stay out of it?

442
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:33,059
Let them do their job.
(scoffs)

443
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,294
Can't believe you said
that to the cop.

444
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:42,168
- Oh, well, I'm sorry
if I embarrassed you, Mom.
- I'm not embarrassed.

445
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:46,438
Forget the fact that I'm
the one who found Lisa on
the bathroom floor today.

446
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:49,908
I didn't know I was
supposed to be worried
about how you felt.

447
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,711
I'm sorry.

448
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,181
Just leave me alone.

449
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,051
(Sighs)

450
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,024
- I need to talk to you.
- (gasps) You scared me.

451
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,993
I overheard you
talking to your mom.

452
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,061
You saw somebody
in the house Saturday night?

453
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:10,429
Look, I shouldn't
have said anything.

454
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,331
Please I need
to know what you saw.

455
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:17,169
Kristen, my mom was right.

456
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:19,972
And you've been
through enough already.

457
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:23,209
You don't need
to be worried about this.

458
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,215
It was only a shadow.

459
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:32,418
Is that it?
Did you see a face?

460
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:36,755
I couldn't see who it was,

461
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,992
And it was only
for a split second.

462
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,064
Suppose I was right.

463
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:46,632
Suppose somebody
did kill her.

464
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,500
I wanna catch the guy,
don't you?

465
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,503
Yeah, but who would
wanna kill her?

466
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:54,140
- I think it was Nick.
- Jodi, come on.

467
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,675
Lisa completely
shut down his business.

468
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,510
Nick was really mad.
We all saw it.

469
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,446
Yeah, but Nick
wouldn't kill her.

470
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,382
It was probably just
an accident like the cop said.

471
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:06,585
I just...
I just can't accept that.

472
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,221
The cops should be,
I don't know.

473
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:11,423
They should be watching him.

474
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,103
- Thank you.
- For what?

475
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:27,106
For trying to help.

476
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,075
I'm gonna go back to bed.

477
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:48,026
So what do you think?
Yeah, they're in good condition.

478
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,662
Where'd I get 'em?

479
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,364
I stole 'em.
What kind of question is that?

480
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:54,366
Do what you want.

481
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,302
You can melt 'em down,
sell 'em on the black market.

482
00:33:56,335 --> 00:34:00,506
I don't care.
Yeah, I'm coming right now.

483
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:09,115
(Car alarm chirps)

484
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:13,185
(Engine turns over)

485
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:47,386
(Muffled dance music playing)

486
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,893
Woman:
Yeah! Whoo!

487
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,563
- Steve, what's up?
- Hey, what's up, Nick?

488
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,698
- How are you, man?
- Good. You?

489
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,767
- Good. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

490
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,857
Aww, man, really?

491
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:28,894
(Clears throat)

492
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,462
Driver's license, please.

493
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:32,598
I forgot my ID.

494
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,836
Turn around.

495
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:41,207
Turn around.

496
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,586
Okay. Come on in.

497
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,213
So how's your car shop?

498
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:23,615
Well, that's sort of
why I'm doing this.

499
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:25,183
Looks like I gotta
shut it down.

500
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:39,265
This way, Nicky.

501
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,639
- Nick: Let's see.
- (zipper zings)

502
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,375
Thank you.

503
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:53,979
Nick: Perfect.

504
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,349
Put this right here.

505
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,918
Someone's looking for you.

506
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,823
Hey, hey, come here!

507
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,593
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, I'm...

508
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,828
What... Hey, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

509
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:13,365
I'm your neighbor, okay?

510
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:15,467
And why are
you following me?

511
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,803
I'm not following you.
I come here a lot.

512
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,439
Oh, okay.

513
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,541
What's going on
back there?

514
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,975
What do you think's
going on back there?

515
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:29,648
- No, say it.
- You're selling her jewelry.

516
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:31,350
Wait, what?
What do you mean?

517
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,385
Lisa. You stole her jewelry
and now you're pawning it.

518
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:35,454
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I stole her jewelry?

519
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:38,624
- I saw someone in her
house the other night.
- Oh, my God.

520
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40,959
You were mad at her because
she shut down your business
so you decided to get revenge.

521
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,629
You sound just like that cop.
Why you talking to me like this?

522
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:46,565
You snuck in, killed her,
stole her jewelry.

523
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:50,536
- And now you're pawning it.
- (laughs) I killed her?

524
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,572
Not only are you way...

525
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,475
Off-base, but you are
incredibly obnoxious.

526
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:57,809
- Am I?
- Yeah, you are,
but that's okay

527
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,378
Because I kind of
have a crush on you.

528
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:00,512
Oh, don't you try...

529
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:02,648
(Clears throat)

530
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:03,682
What did you say?

531
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,451
You heard me.

532
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:13,091
Hey, look, getting
my business shut down

533
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,761
Is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

534
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,364
I mean, I got a job.

535
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:21,667
Now I'm gonna be fixing cars
in a shop across town,
and I can't wait.

536
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,605
I'm selling some
of my old tools to
a guy who works here.

537
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,975
But...

538
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,543
If you wanna believe

539
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:35,347
That I killed her...

540
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:37,483
Then go right ahead.

541
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,463
So what, you're just...

542
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:53,064
You're just gonna
stand there all night?

543
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:08,346
They're gonna check your ID.

544
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,651
What do I do?

545
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,688
*... this moment to arise

546
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:19,858
* You take my breath away

547
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,761
* I'm feeling cold

548
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:27,666
* But I'm holding on

549
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:32,604
* You turned
my world around *

550
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:37,443
Hey, Borelli.
We need check the back.

551
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:38,677
I'll show you.

552
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:45,417
* Because of you

553
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:49,755
* I know all the answers

554
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,923
* Because of you

555
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:56,161
* I'm taking all my chances

556
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:58,730
* Because of you

557
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:00,566
You should probably go.

558
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,702
* Letting go of everything

559
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,171
* I am

560
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:12,678
* You take my
breath away... *

561
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,083
Yeah, I'm sorry, Kristen.
Your aunt was murdered.

562
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:22,921
Now with your permission,
I need to discuss
the autopsy results.

563
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,757
Go ahead.

564
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,759
As you can see,

565
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:31,029
The impact to her
skull is quite severe.

566
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:35,501
Now for a woman her height
falling less than four feet

567
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:37,669
Hitting the side of
the tub at this angle,

568
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:40,639
There is no way that
her skull would be
crushed to that degree.

569
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:44,910
The physics of the
situation tells us this
was not a slip and fall.

570
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:49,481
Something hit her
in the back of the head
with an incredible force.

571
00:40:49,515 --> 00:40:53,685
Now one scenario is that
the prowler entered the house
through an unlocked door.

572
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,654
Lisa surprised him.
He killed her.

573
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,989
He panicked and ran off
without stealing anything,

574
00:40:58,023 --> 00:41:01,860
Or she was murdered
for another reason.

575
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:05,597
Now, Kristen,
we spoke to your church

576
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:09,701
- regarding your whereabouts
at the time of her death.
- Wait, I'm a suspect?

577
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:13,539
Well, your aunt made quite
a bit of money in Southern
California real estate.

578
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:16,808
You're the sole
beneficiary in her will.

579
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:19,144
So you're about to inherit
close to $4 million.

580
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,812
I loved her more
than my own mother.

581
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:23,214
Don't worry.
We confirmed your alibi.

582
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:26,852
Several people in the church
said you were definitely
at the weekend retreat.

583
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:28,987
I can't believe this.

584
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,723
Detective,
who do you think did this?

585
00:41:31,757 --> 00:41:34,192
We don't know.
We talked to every
neighbor on the block.

586
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:38,096
We contacted Lisa's friends
and her business associates.

587
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,231
No one had anything bad
to say about her.

588
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:43,168
Well, about the guy next door,
Nick Thompkin?

589
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:46,738
Well, he said he was
home alone that night,

590
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:48,173
But nobody could verify it.

591
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:50,275
So he doesn't have an alibi.

592
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:53,511
He could've done it.
He was really pissed
at my aunt. Right, Jodi?

593
00:41:56,882 --> 00:42:00,318
I don't...
I don't know about that.

594
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,020
That's not what
you told me before.

595
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:06,124
She's right, Jodi.
You said, and I quote,

596
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:09,160
"Lisa called the cops on him.
Nick was really mad at her.

597
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:14,132
If anybody from this
neighborhood would kill
her, it would be him."

598
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:18,336
I just don't think he would
do something like that...

599
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,139
- not anymore.
- So you're changing
your opinion.

600
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,874
Yes.

601
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:25,644
Can I ask why?

602
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:27,646
I just have a feeling.

603
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,980
A feeling?

604
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:32,050
Okay, that's... that's unique.

605
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,320
Wait, you're not gonna
arrest him because of
what I said, right?

606
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:39,357
Well, we're not gonna
arrest anyone until we
have more evidence.

607
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,761
Don't worry, Kristen.
We're not done yet.

608
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:45,130
We're gonna get
whoever did this.

609
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:56,174
Yeah, listen, I'm gonna need
to get a search warrant.

610
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:59,010
His name is Nick Thompkin.

611
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:03,815
The address is 1821...

612
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:36,948
Hey, can I show you something?

613
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:39,217
Sure.

614
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,820
What do you think
they're talking about?

615
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:48,259
I know exactly
what they're talking about.

616
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:51,697
Ted would hit on me,
and Aunt Lisa didn't like it.

617
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:56,301
Jodi, a lot of older guys
hit on me. So what?

618
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:58,937
If they arrested every older guy
who tried to sleep with me,

619
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,106
They'd have to start
building more prisons.

620
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,208
Yeah, but look.

621
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:06,044
- I mean, he's, like,
really mad at her.
- Jodi, stop it.

622
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:08,914
- What?
- Just because someone gets
in an argument with my aunt

623
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:11,683
Doesn't make them a killer.

624
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:14,419
- What is with you?
- Okay, well, then who
do you think did it?

625
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:19,324
I don't know.
I'm still trying to get past
the fact that she's gone.

626
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:23,394
And this cop tells me
that she's been murdered

627
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:25,463
And that I'm a suspect.

628
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:29,400
Then you go around accusing
everyone in the neighborhood.
Maybe you did it.

629
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:32,704
Jodi, I told you
to not bother her.

630
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:36,307
She didn't do anything wrong.
(sighs)

631
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,810
Kristen, I'm sorry.

632
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,783
I'm just gonna go back home.

633
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:48,954
Are you sure?
You're more than
welcome to stay.

634
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:55,226
I'll let you know if
I can't handle it over there.

635
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,262
Okay.

636
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:59,364
Thank you for everything,
Ms. Allen.

637
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:07,906
What did I tell you?

638
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:10,108
Mom, will you just look
at this and tell me...

639
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:12,043
- No!
- what you think?
Just please.

640
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:14,712
- No, this is just
making it worse.
- Mom!

641
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,626
Wait. Wait.

642
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,395
We have a problem.

643
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:12,430
The cops don't think
it was an accident.

644
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:16,134
They think someone
killed her.

645
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,445
You still think I killed her?

646
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:29,314
I don't,

647
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:32,417
But the cops think you did.

648
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,120
You said you were
gonna make it look
like she slipped and fell.

649
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,422
That's exactly what I did.

650
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:39,925
Well, you hit
her at the wrong
angle or something.

651
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,192
They figured it out.

652
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:42,593
Well, maybe you
should've done it then.

653
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,295
Baby, you know I
couldn't have done that.

654
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,331
That's not what
we talked about.

655
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:49,067
No, what we talked about
is I put her lights out
and then you give me half.

656
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,369
- Where's the money?
- It's in probate.

657
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:53,438
It's gonna take some time.
Just relax.

658
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:56,041
Relax? Really?
How am I supposed to do that?

659
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:57,976
- They're gonna figure out
what we did.
- No, they won't.

660
00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:00,045
Don't say that, baby.

661
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:02,513
I'm tired of all
this sneaking around.

662
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,482
Putting ten hours a day
into this lousy job.

663
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:08,253
Do you really think I like
going to that church?
We have to act normal.

664
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:10,188
Jodi: Look at the way
she's talking to him.

665
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,690
Nick: Yeah, he looks really
mad at her about something.

666
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,326
Well, I wanna go show Ted these
pictures and see what he says.

667
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,963
I mean, I was hoping that
you would come with me.

668
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:21,266
What? Now? I can't.
I'm starting that new job.

669
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:23,301
If I don't hurry,
I'm gonna be late.

670
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:25,503
If you don't keep it together,
you're going to ruin this.

671
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:28,306
That girl across the street,
she's watching us.

672
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:31,342
- What are you talking about?
- She's been taking pictures
of the entire neighborhood.

673
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:33,644
Do you remember the argument
you had with my aunt?

674
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:36,581
When you talk to her
the way that you do,

675
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:40,151
Kristen doesn't understand
that you're just trying
to get in her pants, Ted.

676
00:48:40,185 --> 00:48:42,020
It is not what
you're thinking.

677
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:44,022
It's exactly what I'm thinking,
and I don't like it.

678
00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:47,225
- Look...
- Stay away from her.
I mean it.

679
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:50,361
Kristen: Jodi just
showed me pictures
of you arguing with Lisa.

680
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:52,663
You look like you're ready
to rip her head off.

681
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:56,301
Jodi's gonna show those
pictures to the cops.

682
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:58,469
You're gonna have to
answer more questions.

683
00:48:58,503 --> 00:49:01,406
Okay. All right, well, that's
why we put together an alibi.

684
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,509
Yeah, you see?
I went to the movies.
Got a ticket stub right here.

685
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,444
We snuck out at 8:30.
I drove back here.

686
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:08,246
Parked around the way
and nobody saw me.

687
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,747
That would've worked if it
looked like it was an accident,

688
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,283
But now that it's murder,
it's not that simple.

689
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:16,154
You're right. You're right.
Oh, I'm screwed.

690
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:17,755
I mean, they're gonna
figure out I did this.

691
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,992
No, baby, don't say that.
Look at me.

692
00:49:21,026 --> 00:49:23,494
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

693
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:27,999
I've got an idea.

694
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:30,735
Let's go over to Ted's
later this afternoon
after I get home.

695
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:33,304
- Okay.
- Then afterward we can
go to dinner or something.

696
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:36,341
Well, just come
to my house when...

697
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:38,143
Wait. Wait a sec.

698
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,412
Did you just ask me out?

699
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:43,114
Yeah.

700
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:46,017
And you said yes.

701
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:44,041
(Camera shutter clicking)

702
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:21,639
This way.

703
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:30,181
Here.

704
00:53:20,265 --> 00:53:21,732
(Gasps)

705
00:53:47,024 --> 00:53:48,859
Forget it. Let's go.

706
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,596
Come on. Let's go.

707
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:02,740
Jodi: Hey, Mom.
Can we talk?

708
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:04,509
Yeah, sure.

709
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:11,749
I think Kristen
and that guy Ted
killed Lisa.

710
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:15,853
Oh, man.
First Nick
and now these two?

711
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:17,355
I'm serious.

712
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:20,858
Okay, what makes
you think that?

713
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:22,927
What does this
look like to you?

714
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,696
It looks like
they went hiking.

715
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:29,867
Yes, I followed them to
the woods and they're, like,
totally into each other.

716
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,669
They're having
an affair, Mom.

717
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:33,738
Did you see them
get physical at all?

718
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,341
No,

719
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:39,477
But I saw him put
his arm around her
and then lean in.

720
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,413
And then they went behind
a tree, so I don't know
if they kissed or not.

721
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:44,482
So you can't say for sure?

722
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:48,453
Still, what is a guy his
age doing in the woods
with someone like her?

723
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:50,921
- Honey...
- I think I should show
these pictures to the police.

724
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,991
No, you can't.
You were stalking them
with your camera.

725
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,060
Remember what
Detective Franklin said?

726
00:54:56,093 --> 00:54:57,995
I was right about
the shadow, wasn't I?

727
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:00,731
Yes, you were.
But this is pushing it,

728
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:02,867
And these pictures don't
prove anything.

729
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,902
What if you're wrong?

730
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:07,405
What if Ted and
Kristen did kill Lisa?

731
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,842
She was probably
attacked by a burglar

732
00:55:11,876 --> 00:55:14,512
- like the detective said.
- You're my mom.

733
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:18,449
Why can't you just
back me up on this?
Why can't you believe me?

734
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:22,353
Because you have accused
three of our neighbors
of being murder suspects.

735
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:24,889
It's too much.

736
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:27,592
Don't you see
what you're doing?

737
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:31,596
You are inventing
a neighborhood boogeyman

738
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:34,465
To punish your attacker.

739
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:37,968
Honestly?

740
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:40,070
I'm just worried
about Nick right now.

741
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:42,440
The cops are looking at him
as their number one suspect,

742
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:44,375
Partly because of what I said.

743
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:46,711
And I know
he didn't do it.

744
00:55:50,147 --> 00:55:53,384
We should've done this earlier.
We're cutting it close.

745
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:56,086
I'll watch the front.
Be careful.

746
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,776
Come on.

747
00:56:23,748 --> 00:56:25,750
(Lock rattles)

748
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:48,405
Damn it.

749
00:56:52,877 --> 00:56:54,211
Jodi:
Hey, how was work?

750
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,046
Great.

751
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,791
(Cell phone vibrates)

752
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:15,466
It was really weird.

753
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:26,844
- Nick: So we don't
have to talk to him?
- Jodi: Uh, no.

754
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:30,515
Nick: Great. I just heard
from my dad and I gotta
go grab him at LAX.

755
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:34,785
I talked to him yesterday.
I didn't think he'd
get here so quick.

756
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:37,488
But maybe afterwards,
well, me and you

757
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:39,924
Can go get dessert
or something.

758
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,726
Okay.

759
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:47,598
I wanna go
to the cops tomorrow,

760
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:50,200
- (sighs)
- show them the pictures
and tell them everything.

761
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:53,070
And I want you
to come with me.

762
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:55,472
Why do you want me
to go with you?

763
00:57:56,907 --> 00:57:58,709
Because...

764
00:57:58,743 --> 00:58:01,712
I don't know.
I just think it might
help your case.

765
00:58:01,746 --> 00:58:04,682
Is that the only reason?

766
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:07,518
What do you mean?
What other reason?

767
00:58:07,552 --> 00:58:09,854
Well, I just think that,

768
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:11,789
That you like
hanging out with me.

769
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:16,193
I just don't want you
to get arrested. That's all.

770
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,929
So what, you're just,
like, doing all this,

771
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:20,965
'Cause...

772
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,232
'Cause you're
a concerned citizen?

773
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:25,302
Something like that.

774
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,504
No other reason?

775
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,976
- No.
- You sure?

776
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,545
I'm not sure

777
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:37,181
About anything.

778
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:46,056
(Sighs)

779
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:10,748
You... you wanna go
into the living room?

780
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:12,617
Don't you have to
pick up your dad?

781
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,151
Not for like an hour.

782
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:18,355
I mean, I-I-I should
probably get home.

783
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,992
I mean, I've got work stuff.

784
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:24,862
- Um...
- Yeah, yeah.

785
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,015
(Cell phone rings)

786
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:47,685
- It's Kristen.
- Oh, go ahead.

787
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:51,021
- Hey, Kristen.
- Hey, Jodi.
Did I call at a bad time?

788
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:53,858
- No.
- Can you come over?

789
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:55,726
I really need to talk
to you about something.

790
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,162
- Right now?
- Yeah, it's kind of important.

791
00:59:58,195 --> 01:00:01,298
Sure.
I'll be right over.

792
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:06,804
- You gonna be okay?
- Mm-hmm.

793
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:09,273
All right, so I guess
I'll see you tonight.

794
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:11,008
Yeah.

795
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:13,043
I'll walk you out.

796
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:27,391
See you when you get back?

797
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:38,402
All right.

798
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:47,177
Hey, come on in.

799
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,149
Jodi, I just wanted to apologize
for what I said today.

800
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:54,785
Oh, I understand.
I know you got a lot
on your mind.

801
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:58,823
I've been thinking about Nick.
I think you're right.

802
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:01,458
- Why is that?
- Because of what
you said to the cop.

803
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,894
- I mean, he did hate my aunt.
- No, I shouldn't
have said that.

804
01:01:03,928 --> 01:01:06,296
Jodi,
you understand people.

805
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,066
- You see things
with your camera.
- I was wrong about him.

806
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:11,769
Like I told the cops,
I just... I changed my mind.

807
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:14,739
Why did you
change your mind?

808
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:17,908
Why did you change yours?

809
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,179
I saw you kissing him.

810
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:24,481
You know, Jodi,

811
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,084
Sex can cloud your judgment.

812
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:30,087
Really? How?

813
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,289
You know.

814
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:34,291
No, I don't know.

815
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:36,894
Why don't you
explain it to me?

816
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:39,429
Wait. You're not still
a virgin, are you?

817
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:42,232
- (Screams)
- (grunts)

818
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:44,101
No, I'm not.

819
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:48,973
Oh, my God.
Tell me all about him.
What is he like?

820
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:52,309
He was a complete stranger.

821
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:54,311
I never would've guessed.

822
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:56,213
I mean, you seem
so sweet and innocent.

823
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:58,515
I'll make a deal with you.

824
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:02,820
I'll tell you who I'm
sleeping with, if you tell
me who you're sleeping with.

825
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:07,357
I'm not sleeping
with anyone.

826
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,393
I'm gonna save that
for marriage.

827
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:11,228
Good luck with that.

828
01:02:19,904 --> 01:02:21,906
Thanks for coming over,
Jodi.

829
01:02:32,817 --> 01:02:34,451
I think she knows about us.

830
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:35,953
Doesn't matter.

831
01:02:36,987 --> 01:02:39,123
We're in the clear.

832
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:42,759
You are my everything.

833
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:57,307
(Doorbell rings)

834
01:03:01,045 --> 01:03:04,381
Hi. I'm Jodi.
I live across the street.

835
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:05,883
Is Nick here?

836
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:08,853
Yeah. Come on in.

837
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:12,456
I'm his dad Eddie.

838
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:14,892
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nick, you got company.

839
01:03:14,925 --> 01:03:18,362
So you're the girl
who accused my son

840
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:20,530
Of killing
the nice lady next door?

841
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:23,167
- Well, actually...
- Let me tell you something.
You're wrong.

842
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,335
I got the
greatest kid in the world.

843
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:27,237
- Mr. Thompkin,
that's actually why I came.
- When he was this tall,

844
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:29,406
He used to follow his mother
around helping her
with the housework,

845
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:33,077
Scrubbing the floors.
Everybody he meets he tries
to do something good for them.

846
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:35,545
- Talk to any of his friends.
- Dad, Dad.

847
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:37,948
She gets it.
Thank you though.
Thank you. Thank you.

848
01:03:37,982 --> 01:03:40,384
I appreciate it.
Thanks. Great.

849
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:44,488
Dad, aren't you,
like, jetlagged?

850
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:49,326
- Don't you need
to sleep or something?
- Jetlag. I'm tired.

851
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:57,601
- Hi.
- Hi.

852
01:03:57,634 --> 01:03:59,369
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

853
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:00,837
All right, let's go.

854
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,879
Wait. I forgot something.

855
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:20,657
Mr. Thompkin, I have a court
order to search your premises.

856
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,961
- Excuse me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

857
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:26,897
You guys take the back.

858
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:31,668
- What's this?
- He's got a warrant.
I don't know.

859
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,038
- Warrant?
- Yeah.

860
01:05:00,364 --> 01:05:03,000
- Can you explain this?
- I've never seen that before.

861
01:05:03,033 --> 01:05:06,370
Well, it looks like
blood and human hair.
Bag it.

862
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,505
We're gonna take it down
to our lab to run
some tests on it

863
01:05:08,538 --> 01:05:10,574
Along with some other
items we found.

864
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:12,709
- Someone must've
put that there.
- You're arresting him?

865
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,679
We're gonna ask
him a few questions.
We got a lot to talk about.

866
01:05:15,712 --> 01:05:18,515
Nick, don't say anything
till we get an attorney.

867
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:21,485
- Keep your mouth shut for once.
- Wait. No, no, no, Detective.

868
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:23,487
I have to show you
some pictures, okay?

869
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,522
He didn't do it.
It was Kristen.

870
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:27,324
She's having an affair
with her neighbor Ted.

871
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:29,960
Look, I followed them
into the woods.

872
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:33,163
I think after they killed
Lisa, they buried the pipe

873
01:05:33,197 --> 01:05:35,565
And then dug it up
and planted it
in Nick's garage.

874
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,667
Jodi, let's be honest
here, okay?

875
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:40,204
I don't know if you're
saying this to protect
your boyfriend

876
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:42,372
Or you're having another
one of your feelings.

877
01:05:42,406 --> 01:05:44,541
Neither one
of 'em are credible.

878
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:46,977
Now if you'll excuse me.

879
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:12,702
(Buzzer sounds)

880
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:15,139
(Camera shutter clicking)

881
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:23,080
Okay, Mr. Thompkin.
Thank you for letting me know.

882
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:25,115
(Beeps)

883
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:31,188
The blood on the pipe tested
positive for Lisa Miller's DNA.

884
01:06:31,221 --> 01:06:33,057
They arrested Nick.

885
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:38,395
What was it doing
in his garage?

886
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:40,697
Ted and Kristen
are framing him.

887
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:43,533
What?

888
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:45,769
- You don't think
he did it, do you?
- I don't know.

889
01:06:45,802 --> 01:06:48,805
But how can you be so
sure that he didn't do it?

890
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,707
You don't know him
like I do.

891
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,342
Honey, you met him
three weeks ago.

892
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:54,144
You barely
know him yourself.

893
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:57,181
Don't you think
I wanna believe you?

894
01:06:57,214 --> 01:07:00,317
But you're not looking
at the facts that
the police recovered.

895
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,419
I know what I saw, Mom.

896
01:07:02,452 --> 01:07:06,490
I'm not gonna let Nick take
the fall for what they did.

897
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:09,459
- (Sighs)
- Just come to the station
with me.

898
01:07:09,493 --> 01:07:11,495
I want you to hear it
from Nick.

899
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:19,203
Nick:
Sure, I was pissed
at Mrs. Miller,

900
01:07:19,236 --> 01:07:23,507
But, then I realized she was
right, and I got over it.

901
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,809
I wasn't mad at her anymore.

902
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:28,145
What about your alibi?

903
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:30,380
I was at home that night
watching a movie on TV.

904
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:32,416
That's the truth.

905
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:34,318
Ms. Allen,

906
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:37,787
This isn't exactly the way
that I wanted to meet you,

907
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:40,624
And I know it looks
really bad,

908
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:43,560
But I swear

909
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:45,695
I didn't kill her.

910
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:49,099
Jodi brought me here
because she thought
you might say something

911
01:07:49,133 --> 01:07:51,535
To convince me
that you're innocent.

912
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:54,371
- And I guess
that didn't happen.
- Mom, please.

913
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:58,708
Nick, if you can't prove
to me that you didn't do it,

914
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:01,278
How are you gonna
prove it to a jury?

915
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,815
Maybe I can't.

916
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:07,817
Maybe I'm gonna spend the next
50 years of my life in here.

917
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:10,854
- Jodi: No.
- You know what I don't get?

918
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:12,589
Is how you could...

919
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:16,460
- Never mind.
- Andrea: What?

920
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:18,628
Say it.

921
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:21,165
You're her mother.

922
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,233
What's your point?

923
01:08:23,267 --> 01:08:25,869
Jodi's smart,

924
01:08:25,902 --> 01:08:27,571
Courageous,

925
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:30,440
Beautiful

926
01:08:30,474 --> 01:08:33,877
And she got all those
qualities from you.

927
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,679
So I'm just trying
to understand

928
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:38,348
How you can look her
in the eye right now

929
01:08:38,382 --> 01:08:43,119
And see that reflection
of yourself and not believe her.

930
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:51,595
Okay, let's say for a minute
that you're right.

931
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:55,232
There's still no proof
that Kristen and Ted did it.
Have you thought about that?

932
01:08:55,265 --> 01:08:59,303
Yes, I have been racking
my brain trying to
figure this out.

933
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:03,240
I mean, talking to
Detective Franklin was no use.

934
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:04,774
We've gotta try
something more.

935
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:08,578
- Like what?
- (sighs)

936
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:10,614
What about this?

937
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,716
I'll follow Kristen
and you follow Ted.

938
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:15,452
- No.
- Yes. Mom,
we'll get you a camera.

939
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,921
- I mean, they're bound to make
a mistake eventually.
- Jodi!

940
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:21,391
No. It'll only
cause more trouble.

941
01:09:21,425 --> 01:09:25,362
I'm sure that Nick's dad will
hire the best possible lawyer

942
01:09:25,395 --> 01:09:27,764
And if they need to get
a deposition from you,
they will.

943
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:31,635
And in the meantime,
you are not gonna go
spying on them anymore.

944
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,937
- You can't tell me what to do.
- Oh, yes, I can.

945
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:36,740
And you're not
leaving the house
until you've calmed down.

946
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:40,544
You're grounding me?
You've never done that before.

947
01:09:40,577 --> 01:09:42,379
Well, I'm doing it now.

948
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,723
(Knock on door)

949
01:09:53,757 --> 01:09:56,993
Hi. You hungry?
I was gonna make
us some lunch.

950
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,828
No, I'm okay.

951
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:01,898
I'm just gonna finish
retouching this photo,

952
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:05,402
But I'm kind of tired
so I'm just gonna lay
down for a little bit.

953
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:06,836
Okay.

954
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:10,707
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah.

955
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:13,443
I'm sorry about the way
I talked to you last night.

956
01:10:13,477 --> 01:10:16,846
Sweetie, it's okay.
We've had a rough
couple of weeks.

957
01:10:18,382 --> 01:10:19,716
- You want the door closed?
- Please.

958
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:20,917
Okay.

959
01:10:50,447 --> 01:10:52,649
(Doorbell rings)

960
01:10:58,722 --> 01:11:00,557
- Hello.
- Hi.

961
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,327
We haven't officially met.

962
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,330
- No, I know who you are.
- Oh.

963
01:11:06,363 --> 01:11:09,466
Well, then you probably
know why I'm here.

964
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:12,769
- Can I come in?
- I'm sorry.

965
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:14,638
- I was just running
out the door.
- Look.

966
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:18,007
Nick Thompkin is probably

967
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:19,509
Gonna spend the rest
of his life in jail

968
01:11:19,543 --> 01:11:21,978
For something
that he didn't do.

969
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:25,715
We're... we're
kind of together

970
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:28,952
And he was arrested

971
01:11:28,985 --> 01:11:31,020
Before we could go
on an actual date.

972
01:11:31,054 --> 01:11:33,690
But, look, Mr. Wilcox,

973
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:37,093
If there's anything that
you can do to help Nick,

974
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:40,330
I'm... please...
I'm... I'm begging you.

975
01:11:40,364 --> 01:11:43,700
Jodi. That boy killed
a dear friend of mine.

976
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:46,002
- I'm sorry. I've got
an appointment at the bank.
- Ow! I'm sorry.

977
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:48,672
It's my contact.
It's out of place.

978
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:52,909
Can I use your bathroom just
for a second, please?

979
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:55,078
- (Sniffles)
- Of course.

980
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:56,746
It's to the right.

981
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:21,104
Thank you.
It was nice to meet you.

982
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:22,706
Yes, a pleasure.

983
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:36,119
(Engine turns over)

984
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:22,526
Hey, sweetie.
I brought you some food.

985
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:26,696
Jodi?

986
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:28,632
- (Knocks)
- Jodi?

987
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:30,133
(Door rattles)

988
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:31,167
Jodi?

989
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:48,752
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

990
01:14:48,785 --> 01:14:50,854
Mmm, bank account is open.

991
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:53,657
Good, 'cause I've got
something to show you.

992
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:01,998
- Ted: Surprise?
- Uh-huh.

993
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:06,035
- 50 grand.
- (sighs)

994
01:15:06,069 --> 01:15:07,637
Where'd you get that?

995
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:09,105
The college fund she left me.

996
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:11,541
Her money's starting
to roll in.

997
01:15:11,575 --> 01:15:13,743
Perfect.
It's all working out.

998
01:15:14,978 --> 01:15:16,713
Yes, it's incredible.

999
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:20,016
We're gonna leave here
and we're gonna get
our beach house.

1000
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:22,886
- Everything we've
always wanted.
- Everything.

1001
01:15:22,919 --> 01:15:27,523
- I've got
something else for you.
- Oh, do you? (Laughs)

1002
01:15:48,645 --> 01:15:50,213
Jodi!

1003
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:04,828
Relax.

1004
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:13,236
Ted: Baby... (laughs)

1005
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:14,704
(Gasps)

1006
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:17,607
Whatever did I do

1007
01:16:17,641 --> 01:16:19,342
To deserve you?

1008
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:20,910
(Gunshot)

1009
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:29,252
(Panting)

1010
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:52,809
(Beeping)

1011
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:20,970
- Hi, this is Jodi.
Leave a message.
- (beeps)

1012
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:23,673
Where are you?
I am really worried right now.

1013
01:17:23,707 --> 01:17:25,341
- Call me back.
- (beeps)

1014
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:31,047
Get in. You're driving.

1015
01:17:35,118 --> 01:17:36,820
Give me your phone.

1016
01:17:37,954 --> 01:17:39,756
Give me your phone.

1017
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:43,827
(Doorbell rings)

1018
01:17:58,474 --> 01:18:00,409
(Beeps)

1019
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:06,482
- Go. Go!
- (engine turns over)

1020
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,785
- Hi, this is Jodi.
Leave a message.
- (beeps)

1021
01:18:08,818 --> 01:18:11,020
Jodi, you need to tell
me you're all right.

1022
01:18:11,054 --> 01:18:13,422
- I'm at Kristen's
front door right now.
- (bell ringing)

1023
01:18:21,898 --> 01:18:25,835
What the hell are you doing
driving Ted's car?

1024
01:18:25,869 --> 01:18:28,237
(Beeps)

1025
01:18:28,271 --> 01:18:30,940
(Thinking)
First Nick and now these two?

1026
01:18:30,974 --> 01:18:32,842
What is a guy his age
doing in the woods
with someone like her?

1027
01:18:32,876 --> 01:18:34,844
These pictures don't
prove anything.

1028
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:38,247
What if you're wrong?
What if Ted and Kristen
did kill Lisa?

1029
01:18:50,293 --> 01:18:52,495
Don't go too fast.

1030
01:18:52,528 --> 01:18:54,397
They're gonna know
you killed Ted.

1031
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:58,534
What was that,
detective?

1032
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,504
Did I hear the gunshot
from Ted's house?

1033
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:03,807
No, I didn't.

1034
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,946
Suicide, oh, my God,
that's so tragic.

1035
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:13,182
I know he loved
his wife very much.

1036
01:19:13,216 --> 01:19:14,984
He was really distraught
when she left him.

1037
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,956
(Laughs)

1038
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:28,497
Keep going straight.

1039
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:46,415
Man:
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

1040
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:48,384
I think my daughter
is being kidnapped.

1041
01:19:56,392 --> 01:19:59,028
Ma'am, when they come
to a stop, call us back
and tell us where you are.

1042
01:19:59,062 --> 01:20:01,464
We'll dispatch someone
right away.

1043
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:04,433
- That might be too late.
- We will get there as soon
as we can, ma'am.

1044
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:06,069
(Sighs)

1045
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:10,239
Exit up here.

1046
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:25,855
That dirt road up ahead.
Pull over there.

1047
01:20:59,422 --> 01:21:00,990
Get out.

1048
01:21:03,226 --> 01:21:05,228
This way. Go.

1049
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:35,992
Stop.

1050
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,996
Put your camera down.

1051
01:21:47,136 --> 01:21:49,338
Smash it.

1052
01:21:57,313 --> 01:21:59,983
I told everyone you
and Ted were hiking
out here.

1053
01:22:00,016 --> 01:22:01,684
Shut up and do what I say.

1054
01:22:01,717 --> 01:22:03,987
- You're gonna bury me?
- Do it!

1055
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:20,636
Now start digging.

1056
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:09,218
(Shouts)
Oh, my God!

1057
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:11,754
(Grunting)

1058
01:23:15,124 --> 01:23:17,726
(Gagging)

1059
01:23:36,312 --> 01:23:39,315
(Coughing)

1060
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:58,134
- Baby, come here.
- Mom, are you okay?

1061
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:00,403
Andrea: Yeah.

1062
01:24:00,436 --> 01:24:03,306
(Panting)

1063
01:24:16,152 --> 01:24:18,187
Kristen:
Her money's starting
to roll in.

1064
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:19,455
Ted:
It's all working out.

1065
01:24:19,488 --> 01:24:21,157
I've got something
else for you.

1066
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:23,092
- Oh, do you?
- Uh-huh.

1067
01:24:23,126 --> 01:24:25,428
- (Gunshot)
- (gasps)

1068
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:32,135
Congratulations.

1069
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:42,845
Thanks.

1070
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:14,143
Jodi: A lot of people
have asked me why we moved
to this neighborhood.

1071
01:25:14,177 --> 01:25:17,713
Three months ago I was alone
in our condo and this
man broke in.

1072
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:21,850
He messed me up pretty bad,
and it was even worse
for my mom

1073
01:25:21,884 --> 01:25:25,788
Because she saw the whole
thing, but she couldn't
do anything to stop him.

1074
01:25:25,821 --> 01:25:29,558
So we decided
to leave the city.

1075
01:25:29,592 --> 01:25:31,527
My mom sold the condo.

1076
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,530
We packed up
and here we are.

1077
01:25:34,563 --> 01:25:37,400
And that is the official
reason why we moved here.

1078
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:43,839
I'm glad you told me.

1079
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:45,708
I was afraid to.

1080
01:25:47,243 --> 01:25:49,445
You got nothing
to worry about.

1081
01:25:51,514 --> 01:25:53,182
Know what I think?

1082
01:25:53,216 --> 01:25:55,351
What?

1083
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:58,354
I think the real reason
I moved here

1084
01:25:58,387 --> 01:26:00,523
Is because...

1085
01:26:03,226 --> 01:26:04,560
I really need
a good mechanic.

1086
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:06,962
My car has been making
this weird noise.

1087
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,897
Can you help me out?

1088
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:21,910
(Camera shutter clicks)

1089
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:29,952
(Music playing)
