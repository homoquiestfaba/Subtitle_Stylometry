1
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,100
- Vince!
- Hey, man.

2
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,700
- This is great!
- Yeah!

3
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,200
This is great, man!

4
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,700
How are you?!

5
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,400
- I can't complain.
- Yeah. Cool, cool.

6
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,300
Totally, it is.
I'm very psyched.

7
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Oh. You should be, Johnny.
This is a great thing.

8
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,800
- Thanks, man.
- It's great to be alive!

9
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,900
Totally.

10
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,000
Vince: Shit.

11
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,300
Clear!

12
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,900
- What's up, man?
- Nothing much.

13
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,700
- John: You're not dressed.
- Lay off.

14
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
It's not that
I don't like it...

15
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,900
- Vince: What?
- Nothing.

16
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,500
- Vince: So?
- John: So nothing.

17
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,400
- Okay.
- Okay.

18
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,900
Excellent.

19
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,200
I swear to God, man,
you get stranger every year.

20
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,100
You look good, John.

21
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,700
Where's Leah?

22
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,200
She didn't make the trip.

23
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
Why not?

24
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,800
We broke up.

25
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,300
Shut up.

26
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,200
- I'm serious.
- Shut up!

27
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
- Man, I'm serious.
- You broke up?

28
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,200
- We broke up.
- Why?

29
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,700
Uh, complicated.

30
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,200
Why?

31
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,200
Oh, she didn't like
the way I dress.

32
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,300
- Come on. Don'tjoke, man.
- Actually I'm not.

33
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,400
Tell me
what happened.

34
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, I get stranger every year.

35
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,500
- Come on, Vince!
- What, man?!

36
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,600
She thinks I am a dick!

37
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,200
She sends her apologies
for not coming.

38
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,900
She says she's sure
it's gonna go, you know, fine.

39
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,600
I don't believe it.

40
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,000
She does.

41
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,600
- Why did you break up?
- Hey, hey, I don't know!

42
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,400
- John: Sorry, man.
- Yeah, man. Me too.

43
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,900
Well... what, is it permanent?

44
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,400
Vince: Permanent as
a dead horse, amigo.

45
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
Vince.

46
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,700
Come on, what did you do?

47
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,600
Why did you say that?

48
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,300
- Because I know you.
- What, you think I'm a dick?

49
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,800
Uh... no. Uh... but
I do know that occasionally...

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
you have a tendency
to act in a phallic fashion.

51
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,400
- I'm not like that anymore.
- You're not a dick?

52
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,700
- Vince: No.
- You're not a dick anymore?

53
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,400
- You see what I mean?
- Hey, I'm just asking what happened.

54
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, a lot of things.

55
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
Like?

56
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,400
Like, I don't know. Like she says
I'm reckless. All right?

57
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,300
- What, in general?
- Vince: Yeah.

58
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay, you weren't
specifically reckless recently?

59
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,300
Not particularly
specifically. No.

60
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,900
- Be honest, Vince.
- I am.

61
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,200
- Did you fuck around?
- No!

62
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,800
- Vince!
- I didn't.

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,500
So what happened?

64
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,100
Uh...

65
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,400
she thinks I have
violent tendencies.

66
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,700
- Oh boy.
- John, I never touched her.

67
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,200
I never said you did.

68
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,100
Yeah, well, she thinks I have
''unresolved issues, which occasionally

69
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,900
manifest themselves
in potentially violent ways.''

70
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,900
What?

71
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,100
John: I think it's fair to say
she has a point.

72
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,800
Yeah, well, no one's saying
she doesn't have a point.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,300
- John: So?
- So what, she's got to break up?

74
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,200
She's probably scared.

75
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,000
God. Of what?
I never threatened her.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,900
You sometimes present
a threatening appearance.

77
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,100
Dude, we've been going together
for three years!

78
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,500
So what?

79
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,000
So, I mean you'd think
she'd be used to it by now.

80
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,000
That's a tricky one, Vin.

81
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
Jesus! What's tricky?

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,100
I'm just saying, it's tricky.

83
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,500
Women these days have
no reason to hang around...

84
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,400
potentially violent guys.

85
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,200
It's not an attractive
quality to them anymore.

86
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,500
Too many other guys out there
with resolved violent tendencies.

87
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,600
- Oh, so I'm out offashion.
- John: Look, don't be a fool.

88
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,700
Well, don't be
a politically correct fuck.

89
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,000
Hey, I'm not.
I'm telling you, you're an idiot

90
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,600
if you think chicks
are gonna put up with your bullshit.

91
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,400
What bullshit?

92
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,000
- Uh... like playing rough.
- I didn't play rough with her.

93
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
- Vince.
- Vince: What?

94
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,500
- I love you.
- Oh great.

95
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,600
- But come on...
- Vince: What?

96
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,900
- You don't not play rough.
- I totally do not play rough!

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,300
Fuck!

98
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,900
Okay, man. Look, I'm just sorry
you broke up. All right?

99
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,800
I'm sorry for you both.

100
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,500
Don't be sorry
for that bitch.

101
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,600
Fine, Vince. I'm just
sorry for you. Okay?

102
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,000
Next subject.

103
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,400
Vince: Well...

104
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,000
she says if I get my act together,
keep going to the meetings...

105
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,700
stop being a dick...

106
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,400
then she might consider
talking to me again.

107
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,000
Good. That's great, man.

108
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,400
Should we get some dinner?

109
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,000
Vince:
I got to wait for a call.

110
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,400
From whom?

111
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,300
Vince:
None of your business.

112
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,700
- From Leah?
- Vince: No.

113
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,200
Okay.

114
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Vince: Hey, you ready
for your big day tomorrow?

115
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,200
- You're mad.
- Vince: I'm not mad.

116
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Hey, buddy,
you're allowed to be.

117
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Vince: I'm not mad.
Don't be a fag, okay?

118
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,500
I'll find somebody else.

119
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,000
That's true.

120
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Vince:
...who appreciates my dark side.

121
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Yeah, you know, but the thing is,
if you could maybe find a way

122
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
to learn something
from all this, then

123
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,200
you wouldn't have
as large a dark side.

124
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,200
Learn what?

125
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,600
Learn to deal with some
of your violent tendencies.

126
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,900
Oh yeah? How?

127
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,800
By acknowledging
them. Right?

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,600
John: By making
some type of...

129
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,600
truce with yourself,
where you're not in constant battle

130
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
to prove your integrity
or self-worth,

131
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,100
you know, whatever it is
you think nobody gets about you.

132
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,800
I don't think there's
anything to get about me.

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,800
Vince, your idea of manhood
is putting on Eddie Cochrane

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and screwing
your girl. Okay?

135
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Hey, I'm a simple man.

136
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,600
Well, it's not like that anymore.
Women want other things.

137
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, well,
what do they want?

138
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,700
I don't know, guys who don't put
their fists through windows,

139
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,000
who don't throw
phones across the room...

140
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,000
who don't stalk their girlfriends
across 1 6 states.

141
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,700
All right, all right. All right.

142
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,500
Where they got you staying?

143
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,700
John: Uh, they got me
over in town, at the Radisson.

144
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,200
Nice.

145
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Yeah, it's nice.

146
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
Lansing Film Festival!

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,800
Yeah...

148
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,800
that and Cannes.

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,400
Hey, still it's a good gig.

150
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,800
It's a good cheap thrill.

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why you got to dump on it?
It's a good gig.

152
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,600
I got big expectations.

153
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,700
I spent two years
of my life on this film.

154
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,200
I want it to be...
you know, at a theater near you.

155
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah, well it is.
It's playing right over...

156
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
Yeah, but you had
to come all the way

157
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,600
to the middle offucking
Michigan to be there.

158
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,200
For one screening.

159
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,100
All you need is
one of those guys from...

160
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,000
whatever, right, Disney,
to be there tomorrow.

161
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,500
They see it,
they like it, boom!

162
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,600
Next thing you know,
you're directing Free Willy IV.

163
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

164
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,000
- Hey!
- Hey!

165
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Dude, come on.
I'm starving.

166
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah. What time is it?

167
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,400
John: It's quarter of.

168
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,300
You want a beer?

169
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,600
John: Aren't you supposed
to be getting your act together?

170
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,600
I'll wait
till I get back.

171
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,400
Oh, this is,
this is good.

172
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,400
Okay, Vince! Right here.

173
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,500
This is what
she's talking about.

174
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,600
Right here.

175
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,000
John...

176
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,400
if I wanted to
hang out with my mom...

177
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,700
Well put.

178
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,700
Vince: And besides, what Leah
don't know won't hurt her.

179
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,800
What do you got going on
in that bag, Vince?

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Uh... beer.

181
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,700
How much?

182
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,200
Vince: Hmmm...

183
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,100
A lot.

184
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,200
- Jesus, man.

185
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,600
I don't know why I said
you had violent tendencies.

186
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,600
Oh, why?

187
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,400
John: The warm beer,
the boxers, the Motor Palace.

188
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,800
Who needs Betty Ford?

189
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,900
We can't all be
at the Radisson, can we?

190
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,200
- You wanna come stay with me?
- No.

191
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,300
I thought you'd be with Leah,
that's why I didn't offer earlier.

192
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,200
Vince:
It's not a problem.

193
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,300
It's not a problem.
They gave me a double.

194
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,600
1 1th floor,
overlooking the park.

195
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,100
Still, you probably
want to get laid.

196
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,600
That's true.

197
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,400
It's your big weekend, man.
Chicks are gonna flock to you.

198
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,900
Oh, you're right.

199
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
No. I'll be fine here.

200
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,200
Cool.

201
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Should I twist your arm?

202
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,500
Little bit more.

203
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,800
- Prick!
- Putz.

204
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
- Suck ass!
- Schmuck!

205
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,200
Ahh! Ahh!

206
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
I appreciate you coming
all the way out here, man.

207
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,600
Seriously.

208
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,400
We've come a long way.

209
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,800
Vince: Since?

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,500
I don't know. High school.

211
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,800
You think?

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,100
Some of us.

213
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,600
Dude, I'm totally
giving you shit.

214
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,700
- No, but you're right.
- No, man. I'm not!

215
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,600
Let's face it, you are.

216
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,200
John: I'm right only in that I think
you can do better than you are.

217
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,000
Vince: Why?

218
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Because I believe in you.

219
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,200
If I didn't,
we wouldn't still be friends.

220
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,000
And I probably
couldn't say that to you.

221
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,600
Why not?

222
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,200
Because it sounds
totally pretentious.

223
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,000
- You're right.
- But the thing is, I mean it.

224
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,300
John: No, look, I'm sorry,

225
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,200
but it's like this
whole thing with Leah.

226
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,500
If it is permanent,

227
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,100
then you should view
it as an opportunity to...

228
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,600
change.

229
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
Change what?

230
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,800
I don't know.
Find a newjob...

231
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,700
- I like myjob.
- What is yourjob?

232
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
- Volunteer firefighter.
- Oh, right.

233
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,800
How do you
make your money?

234
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,800
- Lay off, John.
- I'm just saying...

235
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,100
What?

236
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,400
It's just a little immature.

237
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, you try doing it.

238
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,500
- That's not the point.
- Besides...

239
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,400
the majority of my clients
happen to be, like, over 50.

240
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,200
Okay? So, if that's not mature,
then I am baffled as to what is.

241
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,700
Okay. Private dope
delivery to ex-hippies

242
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,000
does not
a mature man make, Vince.

243
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,400
It's no different
than standing on the corner

244
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,900
and selling to teenagers.

245
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,600
Why are you lecturing me?

246
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,100
- Hey, I'm not lecturing anybody.
- You are.

247
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,400
- I'm just pointing a few things out.
- Such as?

248
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,400
Such as, yes,
I think you can do better.

249
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Better than what?

250
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,400
Better than...

251
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,400
better than pissing
your life away.

252
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,200
Vince, look,
you're smart, right?

253
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,600
So why are you
still dealing drugs?

254
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,600
Because I am smart.
All right?

255
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,400
If I were dumb
I would've gotten caught.

256
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,900
Besides,
I am a firefighter.

257
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,600
- You deal to the fire chief.
- He needs me.

258
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,500
That's not the point.

259
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,400
Why is what you do better?

260
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,500
Why is what I do better?

261
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,600
Yeah.
Why is what you do better?

262
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,600
Okay.

263
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,600
What I'm trying
to do is better because...

264
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,400
...it's an attempt
at figuring things out.

265
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,900
I would like to eventually
become good enough at it

266
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,300
to the point
where I can contribute...

267
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,700
All right, fuck you.

268
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,200
Seriously,
where I can contribute to

269
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,400
a larger debate about
why this country's so fucked up.

270
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,400
Like for example,

271
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,700
why is it that a
50-whatever-year-old fire chief

272
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,200
feels the need to get
stoned every night?

273
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,800
Right? What is it
about life in America

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
that's driving
that urge in him?

275
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,200
He likes it?

276
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,500
Fine, but then there's
something slightly wrong

277
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,800
with the fact that someone
with that type of responsibility

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,700
is constantly high.

279
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,200
I'm serious. Maybe there's
something worth exploring there.

280
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,300
His firehouse happens to have
the best record in the city.

281
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,100
If my house was on fire,

282
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,100
I wouldn't want his high ass
anywhere near it.

283
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,400
Listen, man,
you are so up yourself.

284
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,100
If the guy has a good record,
it's because he's lucky.

285
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,000
- That's it.
- Says who?

286
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
It's obvious, man.
He's living this big,

287
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,300
luck-driven lie.

288
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,600
- Get real, are you high?
- No. I'm serious.

289
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,900
You're making movies about guys
who rob Popeye's Fried Chicken.

290
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,400
Hey! Hey, I am telling a story...

291
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,600
which aims to resonate the notion
of where our society's headed

292
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,800
if we're not careful.
If it sounds a little pompous,

293
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,900
it's only because I haven't
fully honed my skills yet.

294
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,600
It doesn't sound pompous.

295
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,100
It sounds...

296
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,000
like you're talking
out of your ass.

297
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Why?

298
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,900
Because you have no idea
where society is headed, okay?

299
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,500
You are just like
everybody else, all right?

300
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,000
You're just following
the latest trend which you hope

301
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,000
will get you laid until that trend
switches to something else,

302
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,400
at which point you'll drop the old one
and start making movies about,

303
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
you know, whatever...

304
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,200
turtles getting caught
in fishing nets.

305
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,800
You don't like my work?

306
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,900
I like it, like I like
a shot of whiskey

307
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,900
first thing in the morning.

308
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,400
It's good for about 10 minutes
and then I want my coffee.

309
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,300
Wow.

310
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,800
What?
Now you're all sensitive?

311
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,800
Did I say something
to piss you off?

312
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Or is it that
you're just a dick?

313
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,800
Well, both.

314
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,400
Well at least you're
finally admitting it.

315
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
Unlike...

316
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,500
some of us.

317
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,800
What? That I'm a dick?

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
Yeah.

319
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,300
- When?
- I was speaking figuratively.

320
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,200
When was I
figuratively a dick?

321
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,100
High school.

322
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,400
What?

323
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,700
I was too shy to be
a dick in high school.

324
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,400
Hey, buddy, give
yourself a little credit.

325
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,800
I think you held your own.

326
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,200
That's because everyone's
a dick in high school.

327
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,900
It's the white male
football-playing prerogative.

328
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,800
The trick is to evolve into
something else once you're out.

329
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
John, you're wearing
$200 shoes.

330
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,100
Okay, first of all,
that's not true.

331
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,500
Oh, what? $1 50?

332
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,800
I'm less shy than
I was in high school.

333
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,800
Oh, great, so now
you're an overt dick.

334
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,900
No, I'm a thoughtful person
who happens to like nice shoes.

335
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,000
And is,
occasionally full of shit.

336
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,000
Is there something I'm not doing
that you want me to do?

337
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,900
I don't want you
to do anything.

338
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,600
No? Because it seems like
I'm being asked to do something

339
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,600
by a 28-year-old pot dealer

340
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,600
who doesn't have the guts to progress
with the rest of society.

341
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,900
Which would be fine if
it was a legitimate rebellion,

342
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,400
instead ofjust some lonely guy
hanging out in a motel room

343
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,000
wearing boxer shorts acting
like a potentially violent dick.

344
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,300
You want to get high?

345
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,600
No.

346
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,600
Come on, John,
let's get high.

347
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
- I'm not getting high.
- Oh, why?

348
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,500
Only potentially violent
dicks get high?

349
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,800
- No.
- So, let's get high.

350
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,300
- I'm not getting high.
- Well, I am.

351
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Fine.

352
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
What do you got going
on in that bag, Vince?

353
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,600
- Pot.
- How much?

354
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,600
A lot.

355
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,600
P for party.

356
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,900
A for all night long.

357
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,600
R for reefer.

358
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,400
T for turn me on.

359
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,000
Y for why not?

360
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,600
P-A-R-T-Y. Party, party.

361
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,600
Let's get high.

362
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:03,300
- Jesus...

363
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,900
You know who's out here?

364
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,800
- Where?
- Here. Lansing.

365
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,500
Who?

366
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,100
Amy.

367
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,200
Amy Randall?

368
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,300
Mm-hmm.

369
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,100
Yeah.

370
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,700
Tracy told me that
a couple of years ago.

371
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,800
When I found out
that you got this thing,

372
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,200
I looked her up
on the Net...

373
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,000
and she's out here.

374
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,900
She's like an assistant
district attorney or something.

375
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,100
Did you call her?

376
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,600
I thought about it.

377
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,700
You should, man.
Especially now that Leah's...

378
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,200
- Out of the picture?
- Yeah.

379
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,300
Vince: Huh.

380
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,200
John: Huh.

381
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,600
I wonder if she's...

382
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,300
Still hot?

383
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,800
- Yeah.
- Not a very appropriate thing to say.

384
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,200
Yeah. Okay,
you know what?

385
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,200
Here's the thing
about being appropriate.

386
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,600
It's better
to try to do that

387
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,300
than to be
a complete asshole.

388
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,200
The choice to respect people
is actually a good one,

389
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,700
despite people like you,

390
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,200
who insist on calling
fat people ''fat'' to their faces.

391
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
What if they are fat?

392
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,400
If they are fat,
they probably realize it

393
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,400
without you
having to remind them.

394
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,300
You know,
it basicallyjust...

395
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,600
comes down to having
a couple of manners.

396
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,100
Oh, is that what it is?

397
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,700
Yep.

398
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,700
Then why did you ask if
she was still hot, Miss Manners?

399
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,100
Because she is.
She was.

400
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,400
That's... no, no,
that's not a bad word.

401
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,400
If the word is essentially
a compliment,

402
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,200
saying it
isn't bad manners.

403
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,300
Human beings like
to be called attractive.

404
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,700
I'm not labelling Amy Randall
anything she doesn't know.

405
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,800
- I'm sure she's smart too.
- Well,

406
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
then I think
we should call her up.

407
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,400
And if we find out
she weighs 320 pounds,

408
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,000
I think that
we should say to her, ''Gee,

409
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,000
we're really glad we dated you
in high school instead of now,

410
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,900
because back then,

411
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,000
you were really hot.
And now...

412
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,600
I'm sure
you realize about now.''

413
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,300
- John: You know what, Vince?
- What?

414
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,200
Why don't you just
shut up for awhile?

415
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,900
Well, I see. So, I made a point,
so I should shut up.

416
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,800
John: No, it's that you like
being rude for the sake of it.

417
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,300
Either that or you do it to prove
nobody can make you be nice.

418
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,800
Either way,
it gets tiresome.

419
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,200
And you and I don't see
each other often enough

420
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
to make worthwhile
this little competition

421
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,100
for who's more
''authentic,'' okay?

422
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,600
It's not about that
anymore, we're just...

423
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,500
we should accept the fact that
we're different from each other,

424
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,700
and let the friendship
go from there.

425
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,600
Accept the fact we're
different from each other?

426
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,000
- John: Yeah.
- Would you like to make me?

427
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,900
- Make you what?
- Accept that fact.

428
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,000
No.

429
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,300
- Why not?
- Because it's stupid.

430
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,100
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

431
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,800
No, it's not.

432
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,200
How else will I know
you're different?

433
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,600
- You'll just have to trust me.
- No.

434
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,900
Prove it.

435
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,500
Or else what?

436
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,000
Or else,
I'll kick your ass.

437
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,500
Well, I guess this means
you are potentially violent.

438
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,500
Only when
it comes to you, John.

439
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,800
You know, it's funny
how you get this way

440
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,600
- whenever we talk about Amy Randall.
- No, I don't.

441
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,700
I don't even think
you realize it.

442
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,800
- Fuck off, John.
- Okay, you know what?

443
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,100
- I'm out of here.
- Fuck off.

444
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,400
- Thanks for coming.
- Fuck off!

445
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,800
Vince!

446
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,200
- Fuck you, John.
- Look...

447
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,600
I'm sorry you still feel bad
about Amy Randall,

448
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
and every time you get stoned
and drunk around me,

449
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,100
- this comes up.
- Fuck you.

450
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,600
It was over 1 0 years ago.

451
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,000
I've explained this to you
a million times...

452
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
that I thought it was okay
for me to be with her

453
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,600
because you had broken up,
and that I now have a...

454
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,200
better understanding as to
the fragility of human emotions.

455
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,300
And thus,
if the situation arose again,

456
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,600
I would not let
what happened happen.

457
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,200
But these things do happen,
especially in high school.

458
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
And I'm sorry that
I hurt your feelings.

459
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,200
That's not what
I'm talking about.

460
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,700
What are you
talking about?

461
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,700
What happened.

462
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,400
- So am I.
- So...

463
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,300
what happened?

464
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,400
We slept together.

465
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,200
How?

466
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,800
- What do you mean, how?
- How did you sleep together?

467
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,800
Oh, okay,

468
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,400
so now this is
about that? Is it?

469
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
I don't know.
You tell me.

470
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,500
We slept together.

471
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,800
Yeah, how?

472
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,800
Vince...

473
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
- you know how.
- No, I don't.

474
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,800
I mean, I have an idea...

475
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,600
but I don't actually know,
because...

476
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,100
we've never
talked about it.

477
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,500
We laughed about it.
We thought it was kind offunny,

478
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,800
but you never exactly
told me what happened.

479
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Okay...

480
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,600
- So what do you want to know?
- I want to know what happened.

481
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,800
We slept together.

482
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,000
How?

483
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
What do you mean, how?

484
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,100
How?

485
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,600
You're gonna have
to be more specific.

486
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,000
In what fashion...

487
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,900
- did you sleep with her?
- Jesus...

488
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,400
We had sex.

489
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,000
- And...
- And that was it.

490
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,400
Was it good sex?

491
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
- I've had better since.

492
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,400
Was it fun?

493
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,400
It was all right.

494
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,800
Was it
on the rough side?

495
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,100
It's hard to say...
We were both drunk.

496
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,500
Did you rape her?

497
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,000
Did I rape her?

498
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,400
No.

499
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,900
Kind of?

500
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,000
No.

501
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,600
Was it kind of
like a date rape?

502
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,400
Was it kind of
like a date rape?

503
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,700
Yeah. Did you kind offorce her
to have sex with you?

504
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,400
No, man.

505
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,600
John?

506
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,900
I'm not sure
what you want me to say.

507
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,700
I want you to tell me
what happened, all right?

508
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,000
You're a filmmaker, okay?
Lay out the scene for me.

509
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Show me the dailies.

510
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,800
You know what? Can we talk
about this when you're not high?

511
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,300
Maybe the only reason I'm high
is so that you would get high,

512
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,200
and for once tell me the truth,
instead of changing the subject.

513
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,200
Okay.

514
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,100
It was a little rough,

515
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,400
which is something
that doesn't make me proud.

516
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,100
- Okay?
- Did you talk to her after that?

517
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,600
- No.
- No? Why not?

518
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
I wouldn't know
what to tell her.

519
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,500
I'm a completely
different person.

520
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,600
- Well, maybe she is too.
- Maybe.

521
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,400
- Maybe she's fat.
- That's really not funny.

522
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,700
I didn't say it was.

523
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,700
- Does anybody know what happened?
- I didn't tell anyone.

524
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,200
Why not?
Maybe you should.

525
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,600
Wait...

526
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,600
look, I don't actually
consider it a crime.

527
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,000
It was not a good thing.

528
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,000
It was morally
somewhat questionable...

529
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,600
and yeah, yeah,
I wish it hadn't happened.

530
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,200
But it's nothing where I need
to turn myself in to the police

531
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,700
- 1 0 years later.
- Nobody's talking about the police.

532
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,300
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know...

533
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,100
Her.

534
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,200
I think
she already knows.

535
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Maybe you should
apologize.

536
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,900
Oh... Jesus!

537
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,800
You think I should
apologize to her?

538
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,600
Yeah, why not?

539
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,600
Look, it wasn't
even date rape.

540
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,500
It was something that got
a little out of hand.

541
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,300
I thought you weren't sure
what date rape was.

542
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,100
- I'm sorry, okay?
- Don't apologize to me.

543
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,200
I'm not.

544
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,700
I'm... what
I'm trying to say...

545
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,800
is that 1 0 years ago,

546
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,500
I did something...
wrong.

547
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,500
And that when I think about it now,
the person who did that

548
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,800
seems like
a complete stranger to me.

549
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,200
This dumb,
drunk high school senior

550
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,400
who thought she was being prudish...
and needed some coercion.

551
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,400
It was bad. I regret it.

552
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,700
But it was a far cry from rape. And
I don't think she'd call it that either.

553
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,800
What do you think
she'd call it?

554
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,500
- I have no idea.
- What if she called it rape?

555
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,900
Listen to me.

556
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,300
I highly, highly doubt
that she even remembers it.

557
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,000
You remember it.

558
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,800
Yeah, I remember it because
it was a pivotal thing for me.

559
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,200
- Your first rape?
- Don't be an asshole.

560
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,200
Look, just tell me
why it was pivotal for you.

561
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,400
I don't know. It was one
of the first times in my life

562
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,400
that I looked
at myself objectively

563
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,000
and made
a conscious decision

564
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,900
to try to avoid becoming
a certain type of person.

565
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,800
For her it may have been nothing
important one way or the other.

566
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,400
For me, it constituted
something more significant.

567
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,900
Or so you'd like
to think.

568
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,600
Why are you suddenly
so high and mighty?

569
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,200
I'm not high and mighty.

570
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,900
I'm too high
to be high and mighty.

571
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,200
Besides, I'm just a lowly,
drug-dealing,

572
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,200
boxer-wearing scum
of the earth, right?

573
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,300
- You said it.
- No, actually you did.

574
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,400
- I didn't mean it like that.
- How did you mean it?

575
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,200
That you should change
your life a little.

576
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,400
- This coming from a rapist.
- You're an idiot.

577
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,600
I'm sorry. This coming
from a low-budget film maker

578
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,800
who makes movies about,
''Where society is possibly headed

579
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,300
if he could just forget about
the date rape he didn't kind of do.''

580
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,700
You're seriously
disturbed.

581
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,700
No, actually,
I am high and mighty.

582
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,100
I was wrong before.

583
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,600
Look, what do you
want me to say?

584
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,000
- I'm sorry.
- Stop apologizing to me.

585
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,700
I'm not!
I'm apologizing in general.

586
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,400
It's something
I wish hadn't happened.

587
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,800
I don't think
I'm an evil person.

588
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,500
No one's saying
you're evil.

589
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,300
It sure as hell
feels like it.

590
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,400
Do you think
you're evil?

591
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,700
No.

592
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,500
So then, you're not evil.
I'm the evil one.

593
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,000
You're the morally conscious
movie-maker.

594
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,800
Whatever.

595
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,500
Whatever.

596
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,800
- All right, can we stop now?
- Totally.

597
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,400
Thank you.

598
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,800
Jesus.

599
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
I just think
you should call her.

600
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,300
- I am not going to call her.
- Why not? You should.

601
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,300
Just stop, okay?

602
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,700
To call her now would be
to trivialize the entire thing.

603
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,600
I mean, what do I say?
''Oh, hey, how's it going?

604
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,500
How's your life?
Oh, by the way,

605
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,800
sorry about
the date rape 1 0 years ago.''

606
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,300
So you did date rape her?

607
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,000
No, I didn't.

608
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,200
What did you do?

609
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,400
I coerced her
to have sex with me.

610
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,000
How?

611
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,900
Verbally.

612
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,600
You verbally
coerced her?

613
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,300
Yeah, by applying

614
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,300
excessive
linguistic pressure,

615
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,800
I persuaded her
to have sex with me.

616
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,200
Ah...

617
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,800
And then,
things got rough?

618
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,700
No, things got rough
in that, after a while,

619
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,500
they became
aggressively playful.

620
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,100
They did?

621
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,300
We did.

622
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,900
Meaning what?

623
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:30,200
Meaning that I probably thought
I was still being playful,

624
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,300
but others might interpret
my actions as being...

625
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,900
- rough.
- I.e., rape.

626
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,300
No. Rough.

627
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,600
Look, John...

628
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,800
only you two
know what happened.

629
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So only you two can
interpret your actions.

630
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,100
So why don't you just
tell me the facts

631
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,000
- and interpret them later?
- I am telling you,

632
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,800
I argued her into it.

633
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,700
You're fucking lying.

634
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,200
- What is your problem?
- I just don't know

635
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,200
how you can sit there
with your oldest friend...

636
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,000
- and continually tell lies.
- Okay, Vince,

637
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,500
what makes you
think I'm lying?

638
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,400
Because only you
would come up with

639
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,400
''excessive
linguistic pressure.''

640
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,400
Okay? That's not
a normal expression.

641
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,600
That is a sign of ''excessive
bullshit,'' all right?

642
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,400
If you had really done only that,
you'd be more specific.

643
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,400
You'd said you told her
if she didn't put out,

644
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,300
you'd tell
everybody she had VD,

645
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,700
or smelled bad,
or had a penis,

646
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,800
or any of the normal
things that guys say.

647
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,300
But instead, you come up
with your typical crap,

648
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,400
which sounds...
mature, all right,

649
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,400
but contains nothing.

650
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,000
And it's bullshit,

651
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,400
because the reason why
you are where you are today...

652
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,300
is because you always insist
on getting things your way.

653
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,000
That is what
you're good at.

654
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,200
So why don't you own up
and admit what you did?

655
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,300
Vince, fuck off.

656
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,800
Fine, I'll call her.

657
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,000
- Don't do that.
- Why not?

658
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,600
John: Because
I would like you not to.

659
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,500
- Why not?
- Vince. Vince!

660
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,500
You've already
made your point.

661
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,700
- What's my point?
- Your point is that...

662
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,400
nobody's perfect,
including me,

663
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,800
so it offends you when I tell you
how you should live your life.

664
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,400
That's not my point.

665
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,100
- It should be.
- Well, it's not.

666
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:30,100
- Why not?
- 'Cause I haven't got to my point yet.

667
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,300
All right.

668
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,700
So get to it.

669
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,400
Maybe I don't have one.

670
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,500
Then I'm gonna leave.

671
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,600
- Wrong.
- Right.

672
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,400
Admit it.

673
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,100
- Admit what?!
- Admit what you did to Amy.

674
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,600
- What makes you think I did something?
- Because I know.

675
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,500
- How?
- Cause she told me.

676
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,900
- Told you what?
- What you did.

677
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,800
- What did she say?
- What?

678
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,500
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

679
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,500
It was obvious, so
just tell me what you did

680
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,600
- and I'll let you go.
- Would you stop being a dick?

681
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,000
- Tell me what you did.
- Why do you care?

682
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,400
- 'Cause I want to hear it.
- What would that change?

683
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,200
- I don't know.
- So why does it matter?

684
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,500
We know
I did something wrong.

685
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,800
- So tell me what you did.
- I pinned her arms back

686
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,800
and stuck
my dick in, okay?

687
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
For Christ's fucking sakes,
shit happens!

688
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,000
I already said
I'm sorry.

689
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,700
Thank you.

690
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,600
- What did you just do?
- Taped our conversation.

691
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,700
Why?

692
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Wanted to make sure
I heard you right.

693
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Tape: So tell me
what you did!

694
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,100
I pinned her arms back and
stuck my dick in, okay?

695
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,600
For Christ's fucking sakes,
shit happens!...

696
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,000
Whoo... you're right.

697
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,900
You know? You are
a completely different person.

698
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,400
I can't believe
you just did that.

699
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,800
Beer?

700
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,200
You're mad?

701
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,800
- How could you do something like that?
- Like what?

702
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,800
- I'm not messing around, Vince!
- No, what?

703
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,200
It offends you?

704
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,100
It offends me
fucking immensely.

705
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,500
Why?

706
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,000
I... I'm...

707
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,400
All I'm doing is suggest
you call up and apologize

708
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,600
for the actions of
a drunk high school senior.

709
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,500
You know that you just ended
our friendship.

710
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,800
Come on, man. It's a cheap
little tape recorder.

711
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,800
- It's K-Mart.
- Why did you do that?

712
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,500
- I'm trying to make a point.
- Which is what?

713
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,700
- There's something wrong here.
- What? Where? With you and I?

714
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,800
And everyone else.

715
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,800
So, okay, what is it?

716
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,400
Do you think everyone
should call up

717
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,900
and apologize for things
they've done wrong in their lives?

718
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,500
I don't know. Yeah.

719
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,500
You honestly think
that would help?

720
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,000
You don't think it'd just
end up being a bunch of...

721
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
hypocrites wandering around,
raping people,

722
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,300
and then
apologizing later?

723
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,000
- You got a better idea?
- Yeah. Not do it next time.

724
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,100
- That's it, huh?
- Yeah.

725
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,000
- You don't think she'd want that?
- Want what?

726
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,500
The tape.

727
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,800
Why would she want that?

728
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,400
To know
that you admitted it.

729
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,200
- Vince.
- What?

730
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,300
John: Look... I doubt
she remembers it happening.

731
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Well, then she might
want to be reminded.

732
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,400
Why?

733
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,100
Because if you pinned my arms back
and fucked me without permission...

734
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,200
I'd want to be reminded.

735
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,600
Don't talk like that.

736
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,400
That's what you said, right?
That's what's on the tape.

737
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,800
- This is ridiculous!
- Why?

738
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,100
Because my apologizing now
won't make any difference to her.

739
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,800
She's probably dealt with
the whole issue and moved on.

740
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,500
All right.
Maybe she has.

741
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,500
But if you're such a different guy
than you were 1 0 years ago,

742
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,000
technically you shouldn't
mind apologizing

743
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,100
for something that
the real you didn't even do.

744
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,900
Now, on the other hand,

745
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,800
if you still are the kind of guy
who would do something like that,

746
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,300
then I understand
you don't want to apologize.

747
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,200
You wouldn't want to come across
like a hypocrite.

748
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,800
Give me the tape, Vince.

749
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,300
No way.

750
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,400
- Why not?
- Because,

751
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,200
as you imply to me
on a daily fucking basis

752
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,800
whenever we spend
the day together,

753
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,300
I wouldn't have
the guts to tell her

754
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,800
all the interesting
tidbits of information

755
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,500
that this tape
herewith contains.

756
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,400
It'll be much easier
to simply hand it to her.

757
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,400
If I even have
the guts to do that.

758
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,600
You know something?

759
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,800
I don't really think
I'm hungry.

760
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,300
I think
I'm gonna skip dinner.

761
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,900
You won't give her
that tape.

762
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,200
It's hard to say.

763
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,100
Will you stop being
a dick, Vince?!

764
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,400
I'm sorry, did you want
to do that line?

765
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,400
- What will you do with the tape?
- Here's what I was thinking.

766
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,700
I was thinking about
adapting it into a movie.

767
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,700
Maybe you could
help me with this,

768
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,700
and maybe I could have
the world premiere

769
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,800
at next year's
Lansing Festival.

770
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,600
Dude,
I'm totally psyched!

771
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,900
Listen, really
you should get going.

772
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,400
I'll just tell her
you said hi.

773
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,700
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know. Shit.

774
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,100
- She'll be calling at any minute.
- Why?

775
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,100
She said
she'd call at 8:00.

776
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,600
Wait a minute.

777
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,800
I thought you said
you didn't call her.

778
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,200
I said I thought
about calling her.

779
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,500
And then, you see,
I actually did,

780
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,900
and it's cool.
We're hooking up for dinner.

781
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,800
Really,
you should get going.

782
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,900
I probably won't go through
with this whole thing.

783
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,100
Unless she sees
the tape sitting there

784
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,000
and we're talking

785
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,200
and she keeps pestering me
about what's on it.

786
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,100
Hello?

787
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,200
Hey, Amy. How are you?

788
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,900
You still up
for some chow? Cool.

789
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,100
Hey, did I tell you
why I was out here?

790
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,600
Yeah, right,
the film festival.

791
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,000
But the reason
for that is...

792
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,500
you remember
John Salter, right?

793
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,500
Yeah, yeah.

794
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,200
Well, he actually
made a movie

795
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,100
that's being shown
as part of the festival.

796
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,700
Yeah, and I'm out here
for that.

797
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,700
He's out here too.
He's over at the Radisson.

798
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,100
1 1th floor,
overlooking the park. Yeah.

799
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,100
Yeah, I don't know
how you want to work this

800
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,400
because I'm over here
at the Motor Palace on Saginaw.

801
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,800
Yeah.

802
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,200
Exactly.

803
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,700
Cool. Cool.

804
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,800
Uh-huh. Well,

805
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,400
you know, the thing is
I don't have wheels, so...

806
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,700
Really?

807
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,600
Well,
that would be great.

808
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
'Cause if you want
tojust come here

809
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,400
and then we'll just
take it from there.

810
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,500
And you know
where it is?

811
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,200
Oh, wow.

812
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,000
Well, terrific. Then
I'll see you in a few, right?

813
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,300
Yeah, it's room 19.

814
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,200
19, right.

815
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,600
Yeah, yeah, me too.

816
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,000
All right.

817
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,400
Okay. Bye-bye.

818
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,200
Dude, do you think
I could borrow a few bucks?

819
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,100
Vince...

820
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,100
why are you doing this?

821
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,700
Well...

822
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,400
at first,

823
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,400
it was a moral crusade,

824
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,900
but now...

825
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,000
I don't know, except for
that you don't want me to.

826
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,900
And that's worth more
than our entire friendship?

827
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,000
John, come on.

828
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,500
I highly doubt if I weren't
one of your oldest friends,

829
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,300
I would even possess the power
to make you think twice

830
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,000
about something like this.

831
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,100
That's assuming
you are thinking twice.

832
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,700
There are better ways to go
about making someone do that.

833
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,200
How? Convincing him with
a really good argument?

834
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,500
Applying excessive
linguistic pressure?

835
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,800
Huh?

836
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,500
I'm not a very
moral guy, John.

837
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,300
Much less a...

838
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,300
highly articulate
poet-filmmaker, all right?

839
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,900
I can barely pay my rent,
much less

840
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,900
convince somebody like you
to stop being an asshole.

841
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,300
No one's asking you
to be articulate, Vince.

842
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,500
You pick what is potentially
the most important weekend of my life

843
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,000
to bring up something I haven't
thought about in 1 0 years!

844
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,400
Yeah. I guess so.

845
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,700
So, are you staying?

846
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,200
Give me the tape, Vince.

847
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,600
Mmmm...

848
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,400
no.

849
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,800
- Just give me the tape.
- Why?

850
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,400
Because
it doesn't belong to you.

851
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,900
I bought it...

852
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,700
at K-Mart.

853
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,800
What's on it
doesn't belong to you.

854
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,800
Bullshit, all right?

855
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,200
I had to be like Aldrich fucking
Ames to make this tape.

856
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,400
This is the most
planned out thing

857
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,200
I've done
in my whole life. No.

858
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,500
It's mine, Vince.

859
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,000
I'm going to give it to you,
you're gonna destroy it.

860
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,800
No, I'm not.

861
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,800
What will you do with it?
Put it in your closet

862
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,300
and not think about it
for another 1 0 years?

863
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,400
You know, where did you get
this whole self-righteous thing?

864
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,600
It's not like you
to have a spine.

865
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,300
What can I say?

866
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,600
I...

867
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,500
am a fireman.

868
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,400
I'm not leaving
until you give it up.

869
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,500
Fine, stay as long as you want.
Just don't touch my coke.

870
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,300
Tell me something.

871
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,600
Have you ever done anything
you regretted?

872
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,900
Yeah.

873
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,400
You have.
That you never apologized for?

874
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,200
Um hmm.

875
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,000
So...

876
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,800
why are you doing this?

877
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It must be...

878
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,700
that I have guilt,
all right,

879
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,600
for all the things
I never apologized for...

880
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,800
and that I'm taking it
out on you.

881
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,400
Okay,
so then it's irrational.

882
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,200
Yeah, I agree.

883
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,000
So give me the tape.

884
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,200
No fucking way.

885
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,900
You know something? I wasn't going
to give her the tape at all,

886
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,400
except now, with the way
that you're acting,

887
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
it's like
I have no choice.

888
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,100
Listen, you should
really get going.

889
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:09,000
She called me from her cell.
She's a couple of minutes away.

890
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,000
Okay, that's it.

891
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,300
Give me the tape, Vince.

892
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,400
- Uh... no.
- Vince!

893
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,800
- What?
- Give me the tape.

894
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,300
Feel free
to leave at anytime.

895
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,100
Stop being
a dick, Vince.

896
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,100
I won't take get
in your way this time.

897
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,600
- Vincent!
- Vincent!

898
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,600
Vince: Get off me!

899
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,600
Hey, Amy.

900
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,800
- Hi, Vincent.
- Wow! You look good.

901
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,100
You too.

902
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,400
It's nothing.

903
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,200
Hey, you'll never guess
who stopped by.

904
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,600
Hey, John?

905
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,200
Yeah.

906
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,600
Look who's here.

907
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,400
Hey.

908
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:46,500
- John.
- Hey, Amy.

909
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,300
Oh, sorry.

910
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,400
Vince: I'm so sorry.
Are you all right? Excuse me.

911
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,000
- Quite the reunion.
- Yeah.

912
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,800
He just swung by
to say hi.

913
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,800
I haven't seen you in...

914
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,100
- Since high school, probably.
- Amy: Yeah. Yeah.

915
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,600
- I saw you at Tracy's.
- That's right.

916
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,600
What was that,
about like five years ago?

917
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,500
Yeah.

918
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,200
I couldn't make it that time.

919
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,000
That's right.
You were in grad school, right?

920
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,100
Yeah, USC.

921
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,000
- Amy: For film?
- Uh-huh.

922
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,000
Obviously.

923
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,400
I mean, the Lansing Film Festival.
That's great.

924
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,800
Right,
that's why I'm here.

925
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,800
- Vincent told me.
- Oh, right.

926
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,300
- Yeah.

927
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,300
Vince: Wow!

928
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,900
- Great to see you.
- You too, you too.

929
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,100
Umm...

930
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,200
I think I'm going to wait
outside for you.

931
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Why?

932
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,100
It's just that, umm...
I didn't lock my car so...

933
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,300
Oh, no, what is it?
Is it the black one right there?

934
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,600
- Yeah.
- It'll be fine.

935
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,600
Just sit and let's hang out,
just for a second.

936
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,400
Come on.

937
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,800
Sit down.
Let's hang for a minute.

938
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,700
Huh?

939
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,800
Okay.

940
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,100
So.

941
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,200
Yeah.

942
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,300
- It's good to see you, Amy.
- You too.

943
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,600
What are you doing here,
in Lansing, Michigan?

944
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,300
I guess I like it.

945
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,100
It's kind of mellow.

946
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,200
Totally.

947
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,400
You know, I went to school
in Ann Arbor.

948
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,300
That's right, that's right.

949
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:27,200
- So I decided to stay on.
- I admire that.

950
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,000
Vince told me, uhh...
what kind of law is it?

951
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,500
I'm an assistant
district attorney.

952
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,700
- Right. That's cool.
- Amy: I like it a lot.

953
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,600
Yeah?

954
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,800
Yeah.

955
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,200
Definitely.
It's a pretty good job.

956
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,800
So, you like, what?

957
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,300
You basically
prosecute criminals?

958
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,800
Yeah.

959
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,700
Somebody's got to do it.

960
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,900
Yeah.

961
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,500
So, Vincent...
what are you up to?

962
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,600
- Me?
- Yeah.

963
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,400
Not much.

964
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,600
I couldn't believe you just called me
out of the blue this morning.

965
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,200
Yeah?

966
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,600
No, no, I actually love it
when people do that.

967
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,600
- Really?
- Yeah, no, no.

968
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,200
I don't have the courage
to do that kind of thing,

969
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,400
and itjust...

970
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,100
I just figured,
what the hell? You know?

971
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,200
But you could've easily
not done it.

972
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,600
Not done what?

973
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,200
Well, not called.
Most people don't.

974
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,000
- That's true.
- It is true.

975
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,000
- Like.... John.

976
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,100
I didn't know
you lived out here.

977
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,400
And if you had?

978
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,400
I'm probably one of those people
who don't have the courage.

979
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,800
You think?

980
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,600
It's hard to say.

981
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,500
Amy: It is.
I mean, it is hard.

982
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,000
Half the time
it's not even worth it.

983
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,500
People change.

984
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,900
They end up having nothing
to say to each other,

985
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:56,200
even if they were
best friends the year before.

986
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,000
I'm glad you're not fat.

987
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,100
- Is that right?
- Vince: Yeah.

988
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,000
You should've seen me
in college.

989
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,000
Really?
A big girl, huh?

990
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,400
Quite.

991
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,800
Well, me too.

992
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,300
Amy: Probably
for different reasons.

993
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,200
Vince: Uh-unh.

994
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,600
- You didn't answer my question.
- Which one?

995
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,200
What are you doing
these days?

996
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,900
Well...
I live in California.

997
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:27,800
Amy: Where?

998
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Oakland.

999
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,200
Nice.

1000
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,800
Yeah, yeah.

1001
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,100
I'm a...
a firefighter.

1002
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,400
Are you serious?

1003
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,500
Yeah,
I'm totally serious.

1004
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,600
- That's really cool.
- Vince: Yeah.

1005
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,800
- It keeps me busy.
- I'm sure.

1006
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,000
A lot offires in Oakland?

1007
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,500
Uhh...

1008
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,000
average.

1009
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,300
I should get going.

1010
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,400
Wait, I thought we were going
to have dinner.

1011
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,700
No, I never said that.

1012
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,200
Okay, but why don't you?

1013
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,300
I can't, I gotta get
some sleep for tomorrow.

1014
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,100
No you don't.

1015
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,000
Yeah, actually I do.

1016
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,900
Dude, they are showing
your movie!

1017
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,600
It's not like you're running
a marathon.

1018
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,000
I know, but...

1019
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,500
Plus it's not showing
till 2:00 in the afternoon.

1020
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,800
Vince, I've got some meetings
in the morning.

1021
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,700
God, you haven't changed a bit,
have you?

1022
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,200
Me?

1023
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,900
I remember you doing the same
thing when we were dating.

1024
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,400
What do you mean?

1025
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,200
Putting pressure on people
to follow whatever schedule

1026
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,200
you've already made up
in your mind.

1027
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,500
That's not true.

1028
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,400
Yeah, it is,
but it's nice.

1029
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,600
No, it's like you...

1030
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,600
it's like he stays up the night
before thinking for hours

1031
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,300
how the next day's
gonna go

1032
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,500
and how he just wants
people to partake

1033
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,600
in his vision.

1034
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,300
- That's not true.
- Okay.

1035
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,200
- John can do whatever he wants.
- I know.

1036
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,300
I'm suggesting he join us
for dinner.

1037
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,400
- Why?
- Because I'm sentimental.

1038
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,000
I like it when old friends
get together.

1039
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,600
Is that so wrong?
It makes me feel...

1040
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,500
you know, warm.

1041
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,300
Well maybe John
doesn't feel like it.

1042
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,400
Yeah, well,
I know that he doesn't,

1043
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,600
because he doesn't have
the courage.

1044
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,400
It's like you said,
he lets things go.

1045
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,400
I didn't mean him
specifically.

1046
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,800
Well, you should have.
He always does that.

1047
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,100
Does what?

1048
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,100
Lets things go.

1049
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,200
Buddy, come on.

1050
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,000
If you saw your mom
walking down the street,

1051
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,600
you would cross
to the other side.

1052
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,600
I think maybe next time, save
the drugs for after dinner.

1053
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,200
- Are you high, Vincent?
- I'm just...

1054
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,100
you know... a bit.

1055
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,900
Have you been smoking pot
since high school?

1056
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,500
Hey, same as drinking.

1057
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,500
Yeah, but
you still drink?

1058
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,100
Okay...
your point?

1059
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,400
I'm just saying you should
be more careful.

1060
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,100
- Is it ''Lecture Vince Night''?
- Who's lecturing you?

1061
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,900
You are just
a little bit. He was.

1062
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,300
I'm waiting for the Motor Palace guy
to come in here next.

1063
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,200
It's only because
I care about you.

1064
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,000
You haven't seen me
in five years.

1065
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,200
You were
my first boyfriend.

1066
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,300
It's inevitable.
You could turn into...

1067
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,600
you know, a dirty old bum
and I'd still care.

1068
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,200
Really?

1069
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,300
Of course. It's just
one of those things.

1070
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,500
Do you want
to get married?

1071
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,600
- I can't right now.
- Why not?

1072
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,600
I have a boyfriend.

1073
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,700
- Who is he?
- He's the District Attorney.

1074
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,000
Oh God,
that is so typical.

1075
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,500
- Typical. Why?
- Itjust is.

1076
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,800
Well, if it doesn't work out,
I'll give you a call in Oakland.

1077
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,100
Yeah right.

1078
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,200
So I should
really get going.

1079
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,500
Why don't you
give him a lecture?

1080
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,200
- On what?
- I don't know.

1081
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,600
Taking better care
of himself.

1082
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,000
He looks like
he's doing okay to me.

1083
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,600
It was good to see you
again, Amy.

1084
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,000
You too.

1085
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,600
Vince:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1086
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,600
- Vincent!
- What?

1087
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,200
No, no, he can't get
out of here just like that.

1088
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,600
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bullshit.

1089
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,400
- What?
- I have to go.

1090
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,400
No. Listen, Amy...

1091
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,600
It was really good
of you to say that.

1092
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,600
You know, because
I always thought that...

1093
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,200
that John
was your first love.

1094
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,900
I realize you guys didn't date
much in high school, but...

1095
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,200
I assumed even though
I didn't know then,

1096
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,000
that when you guys got together
at the end of senior year,

1097
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,900
I always assumed
that was like some kind of...

1098
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,600
you know, long-awaited love affair
that was bound to happen.

1099
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,000
Am I characterizing
it correctly?

1100
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,200
I don't think anyone would call it
a long-awaited love affair.

1101
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,900
What would you call it?

1102
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,800
I'd call it us getting together
at the end of senior year.

1103
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,500
Oh, maybe I was
justjealous. You know?

1104
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,500
Because...

1105
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,000
I mean, you know...

1106
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,000
I always wanted to be
your first... boyfriend.

1107
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,000
You were.

1108
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,500
Yeah, I know, but...

1109
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,800
You know what I mean.

1110
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,400
I know I shouldn't care
about things like that, but...

1111
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,900
- like I said, I'm sentimental.
- That's not sentimental.

1112
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,900
- What is it?
- It's stupid.

1113
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,200
You know something?

1114
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,900
I agree with you.
All right, it is.

1115
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,700
But I didn't know that
back then. Back then...

1116
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,600
you not wanting to have sex
with me was like...

1117
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,700
getting disinvited to Christmas
dinner with my grandparents,

1118
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,800
which is something that
I'm very sentimental about.

1119
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,600
You shouldn't have
taken it personally.

1120
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,800
I know, but...

1121
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,700
I did.

1122
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:17,000
Especially when you guys ended up
getting together. Literally.

1123
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,100
But I guess I blew it
out of proportion.

1124
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,900
What are you
talking about?

1125
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,300
I'm talking about you and John
getting together

1126
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,200
at the end of senior year.
That hurt my feelings at the time.

1127
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,800
But according to John,

1128
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,900
it was less of a love affair
that was bound to happen

1129
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,200
and more like two kids
getting giddy before graduation,

1130
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,000
in which case, I really
shouldn't hold a grudge.

1131
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,000
Is that what it was?

1132
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,800
I would say
it was more of a crush

1133
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,300
that never
amounted to much.

1134
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,800
For you or for him?

1135
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,100
For me.

1136
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,400
It doesn't seem like
Amy wants to talk about this.

1137
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,200
Why not?

1138
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,400
I mean, come on.

1139
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,700
We're all mature adults.

1140
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,600
Why can't we talk
about a high school crush

1141
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,500
- that happened 1 0 years ago?
- Fine, then

1142
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,100
I'm going to let you two
have this discussion without me.

1143
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,000
Before you go, I'm just
curious as to why...

1144
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,800
nothing came
of Amy's crush for you.

1145
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,400
Amy?

1146
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,000
- Why nothing ever came of it?
- Yeah, I mean,

1147
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,200
why didn't it develop
into something more serious?

1148
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,700
It was not like you and I
got together afterwards.

1149
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:30,100
Vince: I don't even remember you
dating anyone after that.

1150
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,100
At least
not from our school.

1151
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:38,500
Well, I guess
itjust didn't work out.

1152
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,200
There's no specific
reason for that?

1153
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,600
Amy:
I'm sure there was.

1154
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,600
But...

1155
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,700
No but.
I'm sure there was.

1156
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,700
All right... John,

1157
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,900
- why are you so anxious to leave?
- Look...

1158
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,800
this is a little
uncomfortable for me.

1159
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,700
Okay, it's a little
uncomfortable, so...

1160
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,100
- I'd rather leave.
- Fine. I'm here, all right?

1161
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,200
What?

1162
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,200
Does anyone have anything
they'd like to say to me?

1163
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,200
Amy?

1164
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,600
No, thanks.

1165
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,800
- Vince?
- Yeah!

1166
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,500
I mean, listen.
It's your call, John.

1167
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,800
I can't speak for you.

1168
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,600
It was good
to see you again, Amy.

1169
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,800
That is so
fucking typical!

1170
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,600
I got to go.

1171
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,500
- Hey, John...
- What?

1172
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,300
Can I have that back?

1173
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,100
Goodbye, Amy.

1174
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:32,400
Oakland must be
a pretty safe place.

1175
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,800
Why?

1176
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,300
There obviously aren't enough
fires to keep you busy.

1177
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,800
What do you mean?

1178
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Can you tell me
what that was about?

1179
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:50,500
I wanted to...

1180
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,100
find out what happened
between you two.

1181
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:57,400
When?

1182
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,600
That night.

1183
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,300
I wanted him
to apologize to you.

1184
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,600
Why?

1185
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,400
So that you could hear it.

1186
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,000
He admitted it to me.

1187
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,800
What did you do?

1188
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,800
I got him to admit it.

1189
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,500
It's on the tape.

1190
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,200
Admit what?

1191
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,000
What he did.

1192
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,000
He did do it...

1193
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,400
didn't he?

1194
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,400
What?

1195
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,800
That night.

1196
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,800
Am I wrong?

1197
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,400
He raped you.

1198
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:50,800
Why would that be
any of your business?

1199
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,200
- You're missing my point.
- Even if he had,

1200
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,300
the last thing
I'd want would be...

1201
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,200
a taped confession.

1202
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,500
Why not?

1203
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:02,200
Because I'm not
the one who needs it.

1204
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,100
What are you
talking about?

1205
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,800
I'm not the one
who needs it.

1206
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,200
All right, all right,

1207
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,300
- who needs it?
- I'll see you later.

1208
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,500
Where are you going?

1209
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,300
- Home.
- Why?

1210
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,800
You don't understand.

1211
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,800
I'm trying to do
the right thing.

1212
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,300
For whom?

1213
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,900
For you.

1214
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,300
Is that really
what you mean?

1215
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,300
- Yes, it is.
- Because I don't think it is.

1216
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,200
- I thought you'd appreciate it.
- Well, I don't.

1217
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,600
Why not?

1218
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,700
Because
he didn't rape me.

1219
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,300
What?

1220
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,600
He didn't.

1221
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,300
So the only person you're trying
to make feel better...

1222
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,300
is yourself.

1223
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,600
Oh Christ.

1224
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,200
- Hey.
- John: Hey.

1225
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,600
What are you doing?

1226
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,700
- I came back.
- Why?

1227
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,400
- Because I felt like it.
- Yeah...

1228
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,200
Can you give us a couple
minutes in private?

1229
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,700
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm serious.

1230
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,700
You want me to leave you
alone with her?

1231
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,500
Yeah.

1232
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,000
- No.
- You can wait outside the door.

1233
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,000
No fucking way!

1234
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,500
- Why not?
- 'Cause of the whole...

1235
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,800
- No!
- I just need two minutes.

1236
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,900
- Why?
- I want to tell her something.

1237
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,100
- What?
- It's none of your business.

1238
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,700
- Yeah, it is.
- Why?

1239
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,500
- I'm the one who brought it up.
- Amy: It's all right.

1240
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,900
- Yeah, no, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1241
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:54,800
Well, I don't care, all right?
I'm not leaving.

1242
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,600
- I wanted to apologize.
- For what?

1243
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,200
- Vince.
- What?

1244
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,700
Shut up!

1245
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,700
I wanted to apologize.

1246
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,000
For what it's worth...

1247
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,400
I'm...

1248
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,000
I'm sorry.

1249
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,500
I'm really...

1250
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:40,800
honestly...

1251
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,600
truly sorry.

1252
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,800
What for?

1253
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,900
For what happened between us
in high school.

1254
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,600
What happened between us?

1255
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,600
I'm talking about what happened
at the end of senior year,

1256
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,100
which Vince was trying to get me
to talk about before.

1257
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,200
- Hey!
- Before when?

1258
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,600
Five minutes ago.

1259
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,600
About when you and I got
together in high school?

1260
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,800
Right.

1261
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,500
Right.

1262
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:13,600
Tell me again
what happened.

1263
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,000
Do you know...

1264
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,000
which day
I'm talking about?

1265
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,400
The end of senior year.

1266
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,300
At Rebecca's party?

1267
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,300
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1268
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,400
Hey...

1269
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,900
what are you guys doing?

1270
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,000
No, I just...

1271
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,100
I'm curious.

1272
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,900
I don't want there to be
a communication gap here.

1273
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,800
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to say.

1274
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,300
Look, I think you think
you did something to me.

1275
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,800
- Yes.
- What do you think you did?

1276
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,400
Why?

1277
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,900
Why?

1278
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,700
Because this is
very interesting to me.

1279
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,500
Do you not think
that something happened?

1280
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,600
Of course
something happened.

1281
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,300
But are you saying you don't
remember what it was?

1282
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,500
Come on, John!

1283
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,700
There's some things
one doesn't forget.

1284
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,300
I agree.

1285
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,300
I'm just wondering how...

1286
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,200
you would describe it,
that's all.

1287
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,800
Probably
the same way as you.

1288
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
You think?

1289
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,100
Look, the whole reason
this thing started

1290
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,000
is because Vince
taped this conversation.

1291
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,600
- I didn't realize...
- It's fine. I'm just saying,

1292
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,800
that's why I'm here.

1293
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,400
So, you're here because
Vincent taped you?

1294
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,500
Yes.

1295
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:32,000
Why?

1296
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,200
- Why?
- Why?

1297
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,900
- Because it made me think.
- Oh.

1298
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,200
Which is why I came back.

1299
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,200
Amy: Good.

1300
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,000
So tell me again
what happened?

1301
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,200
I think...

1302
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,800
I think I raped you.

1303
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,600
Oh my God!

1304
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,500
No, you didn't rape me.

1305
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,400
Yes, I did.

1306
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,600
No, you didn't.

1307
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,400
Are you trying
to make fun of this?

1308
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,000
No.

1309
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,100
Amy,
I know what happened.

1310
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,100
- Apparently not.
- Yes, I do.

1311
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,200
Says who?

1312
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,500
- John: Me!
- Why?

1313
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,800
Because
I just admitted it.

1314
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,900
On what, on the tape?

1315
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,100
- Yeah.
- Amy: What's on it?

1316
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,200
It's me confessing
what I did.

1317
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,400
- What did you do?
- I just told you.

1318
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,700
- That doesn't prove you did it.
- Why not?

1319
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,600
If no one's accusing you
of anything,

1320
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,900
there's no reason
to confess.

1321
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,400
I... I... I...

1322
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,500
I'm having trouble realizing
what you're doing.

1323
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,600
I'm not doing anything.

1324
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,400
This is not
an easy thing for me.

1325
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,900
You sure about that?

1326
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:57,000
- John?
- What?

1327
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,000
You sure you know
what you're saying?

1328
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,800
I'm saying what
you wanted me to say.

1329
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,200
All right, but...

1330
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,600
Are you sure you got
the right girl?

1331
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,900
- Jesus!
- She said nothing happened.

1332
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,400
- She's lying!
- No, I'm not!

1333
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,500
- Amy!
- What?!

1334
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,900
- You... you're mocking this!
- Why would I do that?

1335
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,900
I have no idea.

1336
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,700
But if you are,
I have better things to do!

1337
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:21,900
Oh...

1338
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:26,800
I just think we have differing
perceptions of what happened.

1339
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,200
I really don't see
how that could be.

1340
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,200
Why? Because you decided
you did something?

1341
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,100
I did do something.

1342
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,300
Well,
I say you didn't.

1343
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,000
- So then what happened?
- When?

1344
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,500
Then.

1345
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,600
We had sex.

1346
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,000
- Amy.
- What?

1347
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,100
I'm trying to be honest.

1348
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,900
Why now?

1349
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,100
Because I haven't
seen you in 1 0 years.

1350
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,100
But why now?

1351
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,400
Because...

1352
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,100
when Vince played back
the tape for me,

1353
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,000
it hit me
what I had done.

1354
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,700
And if he hadn't
played back the tape?

1355
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,000
Yeah?

1356
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,000
Would you be saying this?

1357
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,800
Probably not.

1358
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Or is itjust
that I'm here?

1359
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,200
- What do you mean?
- If I lived in Alaska,

1360
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,900
would you have
sought me out?

1361
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:21,300
- I don't really know.
- You should look into that.

1362
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,100
Fine.

1363
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,400
Maybe you were
jealous of Vincent.

1364
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,800
Does that make me
sound conceited?

1365
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,300
- A bit.
- Why?

1366
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,000
I loved you.

1367
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,500
I did.

1368
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:40,600
I was totally in love
with you that night.

1369
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,400
Did you love me?

1370
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,300
No.

1371
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,400
Then why were you
with me?

1372
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,600
I'm not sure.

1373
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,600
Maybe it's the same reason
you came back to apologize.

1374
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,900
- Which is what?
- You like pissing Vincent off.

1375
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,800
Why would it piss him off
if it's what he wanted?

1376
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,500
Because he's confused.

1377
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,200
Exactly.

1378
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,600
It's never too late to one-up
your best friend by telling him

1379
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,600
that you raped the love
of his life in high school.

1380
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,700
Especially if you can do it
in front of her.

1381
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,400
- That's very good.
- You think I'm like that?

1382
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,900
Oh, I don't know.

1383
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,200
I have a poor record
ofjudging you accurately.

1384
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,400
Maybe you came back
to get the last word.

1385
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,000
You didn't like
what you'd said,

1386
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,800
so you came back and phrased it
a little more eloquently.

1387
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,800
The reason I came back
is to apologize!

1388
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,200
Which I can assure you
is not at all disingenuous.

1389
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,600
I honestly am sorry.

1390
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,400
Why? Because you had
your hand over my mouth?

1391
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,400
Yes.

1392
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,000
John, I let
everybody do that.

1393
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:56,800
Can you please
just tell me the truth?

1394
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,300
I am.

1395
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,000
Vince:
Where are you going?

1396
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,600
- I should leave.
- Why?

1397
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,800
Because no matter
what I say,

1398
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,500
- there's nowhere for this to go.
- No,

1399
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,500
you just want the last word.
And you know what?

1400
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,200
- It's not yours to have.
- Would you guys figure out

1401
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:16,200
what the fuck
you're talking about?

1402
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,400
Vince, I don't know.

1403
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,000
She's in denial.

1404
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,800
- Amy?
- What?

1405
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Whatever gave you the idea
that something happened?

1406
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,500
- At Rebecca's?
- Yeah!

1407
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:32,200
I just...

1408
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,800
I thought that later, that's
what you were trying to tell me.

1409
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Why?

1410
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,000
Because why else would you
be sleeping with John

1411
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,800
when you were supposed
to be dating me?

1412
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,400
You and I
had already broken up.

1413
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,800
Yeah, but we hadn't even
slept together.

1414
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,900
- So why would you be with him?
- It's none of your business.

1415
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,200
Vince: Okay, fine,
but it's partly why...

1416
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,000
- I thought something happened.
- You mean,

1417
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,900
if I wasn't
sleeping with you,

1418
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:00,300
why would I be sleeping
with someone else?

1419
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,800
Yeah.

1420
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,900
I guess.

1421
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,900
I thought
something like that.

1422
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,300
I'm going to go.
Vince,

1423
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,500
maybe I'll see you
tomorrow. Amy,

1424
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,300
I'm truly sorry.

1425
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,200
I'm sorry you're not in a place
where you can hear that.

1426
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,700
- I hope you have a good life.
- Why did you just say that?

1427
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,000
- Say what?
- I'm not in a place

1428
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,600
where I can hear that.

1429
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,800
Because you don't seem
to realize I'm serious.

1430
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I don't know how else
to put this.

1431
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,600
And if it really were
no big deal for you,

1432
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,000
it was for me.

1433
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,300
And I want you to know
that I'm sorry it happened.

1434
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,800
Amy:
Well, you should be.

1435
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,800
I hope you die for it
and go to hell.

1436
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,200
And if there's no hell, I hope you
suffer on your way to death.

1437
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,800
My hope is that your last
living sensation

1438
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,500
be that of a steel rod
being shoved

1439
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,400
repeatedly
up your insides,

1440
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:55,400
so that it batters your heart
and punctures your stomach.

1441
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:05,800
Is that along the lines
of what you wanted?

1442
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,900
Amy: Uh?

1443
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,300
I don't know what
you want me to say to you.

1444
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,400
Nothing.

1445
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,600
So was I right?

1446
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,200
Yes.

1447
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,900
This is Amy Randall
from the DA's office.

1448
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,400
Could you please
dispatch a squad car

1449
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,000
over to the Motor Palace
on Saginaw, room 19?

1450
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,600
There appears to be
a significant amount

1451
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,600
of illegal
substance in the room.

1452
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,900
Amy: Uh-huh.

1453
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,800
Amy:
It appears to be cocaine.

1454
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,400
Yes.

1455
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,000
Yes. Could you also
please run a check

1456
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,100
on one of
the two gentlemen here?

1457
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,900
Mr. John Salter.

1458
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:35,000
S, as in Sally, A-L-T-E-R.

1459
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,400
Possible history
of sexual misconduct,

1460
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:44,200
including a verified first
degree CSC 1 0 years prior.

1461
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,500
Yeah.

1462
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,200
Nope.

1463
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,500
Yes.

1464
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,600
Thank you.

1465
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,000
You two can make a run
for it if you'd like.

1466
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,400
Did you really
just do that?

1467
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,100
The average response time
in Lansing is four minutes.

1468
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,100
One of the top departments
in the country.

1469
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:23,700
Why does this
have to be like this?

1470
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,800
Because if you're
truly repentant,

1471
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,300
then you should be willing
to pay the price.

1472
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,700
Why can't you just accept
the fact that I'm sorry?

1473
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,300
It does me no good.

1474
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,800
- Is that my fault?
- No.

1475
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,900
It's just the way it is.

1476
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,300
But I'm the one who has to run out
of here like a criminal?

1477
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:46,400
- That's up to you.
- Because I'm not going to.

1478
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,600
Is that
because you think

1479
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,400
the statute of limitations
has run out?

1480
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,700
I have no idea.

1481
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:55,600
There is none for
a sexual misconduct felony.

1482
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,100
Just to let you know.

1483
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,600
All right, listen.

1484
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,300
I don't feel like getting busted
for a couple of lines.

1485
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,800
Then I'll see you later.

1486
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,500
Amy: Just do me a favor
and leave that tape behind.

1487
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:14,000
So I can give it to Officer
Friendly when he gets here.

1488
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,700
You want me
to give you the tape?

1489
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,800
Yeah.

1490
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,500
Amy: You don't need
his permission.

1491
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,000
I feel like I do.

1492
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,400
You didn't need
his permission to make it,

1493
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,700
so why do you
need it now?

1494
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,700
Protocol?

1495
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,900
Fine.

1496
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,800
Well, I guess I'll just
have to stay here

1497
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,900
- and tell them myself.
- Oh Jesus!

1498
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,400
Vince: Dude, it might be in
your best interest to come with me.

1499
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,300
I'm staying.

1500
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,500
Vince: Why?

1501
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:54,500
If this is the only way
she knows how to deal with this,

1502
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:58,300
- then this is what should happen.
- What about me?

1503
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,000
What about you?

1504
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,800
I didn't really do
anything wrong!

1505
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
You're in possession of
an illegal substance.

1506
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,000
I was just trying
to blow off a little steam.

1507
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,100
You should have
blown it off with beer.

1508
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:09,100
I did!

1509
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:13,400
I was just trying
to blow it off a little extra.

1510
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:16,000
John: You'd better go.
They're on their way.

1511
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,800
Come with me.

1512
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,500
No.

1513
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:22,300
Don't be an idiot,
all right?

1514
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:25,100
They will arrest you.

1515
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,600
All right,
is this really what you want?

1516
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,300
John's a big boy.

1517
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,600
He can make
his own decisions.

1518
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,000
All right, fine, fuck it.

1519
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:43,000
- Hey, I'm out of here.
- John: Thanks, Vince.

1520
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,100
What?

1521
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,300
Thanks.

1522
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:52,900
- For what?
- For all your honesty.

1523
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,200
Okay,
what does that mean?

1524
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Nothing.

1525
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,100
I'll see you later.

1526
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,900
No! Fuck!

1527
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,900
Fuck! God!

1528
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,300
Shit.

1529
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,500
Did you really
call the police?

1530
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,200
No.

1531
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,300
Oh Jesus Christ!

1532
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,900
Sorry.

1533
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:10,300
Why did you do that?!

1534
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,500
I felt like it.

1535
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,700
You are so fucked up!!

1536
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,300
God!

1537
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,800
What did you expect?

1538
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:24,700
Fine,

1539
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,900
but do you have any idea
how much those cost?

1540
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,600
There'll be other drugs.

1541
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,300
I know.

1542
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:37,500
But I...

1543
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:41,300
I really liked those ones.

1544
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,800
Good luck tomorrow.

1545
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,200
Thank you.

1546
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,200
You're welcome.

1547
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,600
Goodbye, Vincent.

1548
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,600
Vince: Goodbye, Amy.

1549
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,500
- It was good to see...
