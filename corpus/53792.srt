1
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:31,995
I'm just going to get some flowers,
dear.

2
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:38,043
It's tulip season today
and I'm so happy.

3
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:44,382
- Son of a bitch.
- Come on, sweetie.

4
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,427
Come on, sweetie.

5
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,435
Come on now, sweetheart.

6
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:03,568
Go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

7
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:07,822
Come on, go for a ride.

8
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:10,033
No! Freeze!

9
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:13,828
Leg down! Leg down!

10
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:17,707
That's it. Come on.

11
00:01:21,044 --> 00:01:24,047
No! You monkey-eared son of a ...

12
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:28,968
You have pissed your last floor.

13
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:33,807
I'll bet you wish
you were a real ...

14
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:37,227
You dog-eared monkey.

15
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:43,775
This is New York. If you can make it
here you can make it anywhere.

16
00:01:52,992 --> 00:01:55,286
Verdell?

17
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:58,415
Verdell?

18
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:03,294
Where's my good doggie? Verdell?

19
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:07,090
Come here, sweetheart.

20
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:10,051
Mr. Udall?

21
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:16,933
- Have you seen Verdell?
- What does he look like?

22
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:26,234
My dog. You know ...
My dog with the adorable face.

23
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:32,615
- Don't you know what it looks like?
- You were talking about your dog.

24
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:37,370
I thought it was that coloured man.

25
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:40,915
Which colour was that?

26
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:46,338
Thick molasses with a broad nose.

27
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:49,716
- Perfect for smelling prison food.
- Frank!

28
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:54,596
- You have got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs. Melvin Udall.

29
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:59,642
Frank shows my work, Mr. Udall.
I think you know that.

30
00:02:59,809 --> 00:03:04,147
As long as you keep your work
zipped up, around me, -

31
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:07,192
- I don't care
where you shove your show.

32
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:12,197
Are we done being neighbours?

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,163
- Let me ...
- No! Not worth it.

34
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:32,676
- Hope you find him. Love that dog.
- You don't love anything.

35
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:59,703
One, two, three, four, five.

36
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:03,581
One, two, three, four, five.

37
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:27,564
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

38
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:51,421
- Where is he?
- He had a thing with the dog.

39
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:54,632
- Ugly dog.
- He's adorable.

40
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:02,140
My honey. Where have you been?

41
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:07,771
Look at my boy.

42
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:15,737
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- We know you did.

43
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:18,365
Where was my baby?

44
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:25,955
ln the basement garbage bin
eating diaper shit.

45
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:32,003
- You earned your fun, John.
- It just struck me as funny.

46
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:39,177
How did he get down there?
Even if he got in the elevator ...

47
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:44,641
Maybe some nice neighbour
shoved him down the garbage chute.

48
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:52,941
''ln the dark she had confessed
and he had forgiven.''

49
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:56,069
''This is what you live for,
he said.''

50
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:59,989
''Two heads on a pillow.
All is approval.''

51
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:04,911
''There is only the safety
of being with each other.''

52
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:10,834
''How could she find such hope
in the most shameful part of her?''

53
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:16,589
- Mr. Udall!
- ''She was able to define love.''

54
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:19,175
''Love was ...''

55
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:24,931
Mr. Udall, I'd like to speak to you.
Let me do this by myself.

56
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:29,561
- ''Love was ...''
- Are you in there?

57
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:32,856
Pansy-assed stool-pusher!

58
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:35,942
Yes?

59
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:38,695
This can wait.

60
00:06:38,862 --> 00:06:42,824
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

61
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:51,499
Well ... That's a load off.

62
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,712
Did you ... do something to him?

63
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,718
Do you realize
that I work at home?

64
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:06,973
Do you like being interrupted
when you're playing in your garden?

65
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:13,897
No,
I turn the ringer off on my phone.

66
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:18,026
- And put a piece of cardboard ...
- I work all the time.

67
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:22,322
So never interrupt me!

68
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:27,243
Not if you hear the sound of a thud
from my home, -

69
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,248
- and one week later there's a smell
from a decaying human body, -

70
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:37,796
- and you have to hold a hanky
to your face because of the stench.

71
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:41,508
Even then, don't come knocking.

72
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:47,555
Or if it's election night
and you want to celebrate, -

73
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:53,269
- because some fudge-packer was
elected the first queer president.

74
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:58,316
And he's going to have you
down to Camp David, -

75
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:02,570
- and you want someone
to share the moment with.

76
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:08,284
Even then, don't knock.
Not on this door.

77
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:11,871
Not for any reason.

78
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,792
Do you get me, sweetheart?

79
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:23,216
Yes. It's not a subtle point
that you are making.

80
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:27,429
Okay, then.

81
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:44,529
So, now he will think twice
before messing with me.

82
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:56,750
''Love was ...''

83
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:01,504
What was love?

84
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:05,717
''Love was ...''

85
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:12,515
Now I'm really pissed!

86
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,145
Don't touch!

87
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:22,108
Shut up! You don't intimidate me
with your attitude.

88
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:26,154
I grew up in hell, homeboy.
My grandmother had more attitude.

89
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:33,286
Police! Doughnut-munching morons!
Help me!

90
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:37,457
Assault! And you're black!

91
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:42,045
I like Simon enough
to batter you unrecognizable, -

92
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:46,966
- if you verbally abuse him
or touch that dog again.

93
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:55,684
Meantime ... I'll think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

94
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,064
I hate doing this!
I'm an art dealer.

95
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:03,358
Have a nice day.

96
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:05,735
Party!

97
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,551
- Don't touch.
- Get a life.

98
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:33,763
Watch it.

99
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,774
- Look at you. You're better.
- New medication.

100
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:48,319
You know all my son's stuff?
I've got a date tonight.

101
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:53,158
I'm walking out the door, he says,
''I promise not to get a cough.''

102
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:57,287
- lsn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

103
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:03,460
I said, ''You love me the way
you love your remote control.''

104
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:05,795
That's great.

105
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:11,009
People that talk in metaphors
ought to shampoo my crotch.

106
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:14,471
- Eat up!
- I've got your money.

107
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:18,683
- Pay me next week.
- I owe you and I told you today.

108
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,810
Excuse me, Melvin.

109
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:26,649
There you go.

110
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:34,741
Pardon me.
Take the money.

111
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:40,997
- Take a cab home and get ready.
- Ready is not my problem.

112
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:46,336
- I'm starving.
- You're not allowed back here.

113
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:52,050
Spence is more excited about it
than I am.

114
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:55,970
Sometimes, these kids,
you just want to ...

115
00:11:56,137 --> 00:12:00,183
- I've got jews at my table.
- It's not your table.

116
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,395
You can sit
at someone else's station.

117
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,149
Or you can wait your turn.

118
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:19,577
How much more have you got to eat?

119
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:27,002
Appetites aren't as big
as your noses, huh?

120
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:29,963
That's it!

121
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,424
Let's go.

122
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:37,387
He's barred for life.

123
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:50,942
- They left.
- Yeah, what do you know?

124
00:12:52,694 --> 00:12:58,450
Bryan says, if you ever act like
this again you are barred for life.

125
00:12:58,616 --> 00:13:01,619
I'm going to miss the excitement.

126
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:05,415
Three eggs, over easy.

127
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:09,794
- Sausage, bacon, fries.
- Fries today?

128
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:14,132
A short stack.
Coffee with cream and sweetener.

129
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:17,344
You'll die soon, with that diet.

130
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:23,224
We're all gonna die. You and I are,
and it sounds like your son will.

131
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:43,661
If you ever mention my son again ...

132
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:48,917
... you will never be able to eat
here again. Do you understand?

133
00:13:54,547 --> 00:14:00,345
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

134
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:06,476
Do you understand me,
you crazy fuck?

135
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:14,025
Do you?

136
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:22,617
Yes ...

137
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,712
I'll get your order.

138
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:37,007
Wear my earrings tonight.

139
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:44,514
It's just so interesting.
You said it like it was nothing.

140
00:14:49,644 --> 00:14:55,025
- Where's the bedroom?
- This is sort of it ...

141
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:58,695
I sort of sleep in here.

142
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:10,206
Don't worry about it.

143
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:36,441
What?

144
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:40,320
I don't know.

145
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,996
Grandma ...

146
00:15:50,747 --> 00:15:55,835
- Maybe you better check.
- What did you think I was going to?

147
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:03,510
I'm sorry.
I was hearing everything ...

148
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:07,681
I put these on to give you privacy.

149
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:10,475
How was dinner?

150
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:17,232
- How was your friend?
- Are you okay? Scootch over.

151
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,570
- Where did he take you to eat?
- A nice place.

152
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,616
I have him ...

153
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:30,578
- One more spit?
- He's waiting.

154
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:33,331
Go.

155
00:16:33,498 --> 00:16:37,293
- Give me a hug.
- Carol.

156
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:42,549
- Carol, I have him.
- She has me. Go.

157
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,390
Close the curtains.

158
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:57,564
No! He can't take smoke.

159
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:02,318
Magic.

160
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:15,832
God! That'll teach you.
I don't even notice it any more.

161
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,960
Come here.

162
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,225
- It's a little bit of throw-up.
- ''Little bit of throw-up''?

163
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:39,731
What shall we do?

164
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:43,610
Shall I write down which train
you take, or should we lay ...

165
00:17:43,777 --> 00:17:46,780
No. I'll take a cab.

166
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:57,916
It's just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

167
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,964
I promised Simon
I'd find him a model.

168
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:09,302
Take me offthe speaker.
These are house seats.

169
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:16,476
Come on. You could use a break.
Hello? Carl? You there?

170
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:20,063
Okay. I just found a model.

171
00:18:22,107 --> 00:18:25,819
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy.

172
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,283
What's going on?

173
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:37,414
- Hi. Remember?
- I only need one.

174
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:40,834
You picked me up some time ago.

175
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:45,005
- This is for a portrait.
- Portrait?

176
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:49,801
Come here.
I'll give you the address.

177
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:54,305
- Brad Pitt. It's the shit.
- Do you read?

178
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:02,188
Who is it, baby?

179
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:08,153
Who is it, Verdell?

180
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:13,616
I'm sorry. I told you today.

181
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:16,745
I was out in the studio and I ...

182
00:19:18,163 --> 00:19:19,873
It's out here.

183
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,460
- You have great things.
- Gershwin. Great, isn't he?

184
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:28,131
I make a big deal about picking
models, but Carl is so thorough.

185
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,760
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your résumé.

186
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:38,308
This is not a nude.

187
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:41,770
Just kidding around.

188
00:19:42,854 --> 00:19:44,814
So much for love.

189
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:48,651
And yet another pose.

190
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:55,283
- What is your previous experience?
- I'm running out of ideas here.

191
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:02,540
- Give me some direction.
- I just watch.

192
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:07,879
Until something strikes me.
Do anything you think of.

193
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:13,593
Wait until I say to hold that pose,
then just try to hold it.

194
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:17,389
No direction.

195
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:23,728
What I do is, I watch.

196
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:28,858
Ever watch somebody who doesn't
know you're watching them?

197
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:33,697
An old woman sitting on a bus?
Or kids going to school?

198
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:39,285
Somebody just waiting, and you see
this flash come over them.

199
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:44,958
And you know it has nothing to do
with anything external.

200
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:50,005
They're just sort of realer
and more alive.

201
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:55,719
You look at someone long enough,
you discover their humanity.

202
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:02,642
I know exactly what you mean.

203
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:12,444
Oh, my God ... Hold it.

204
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:16,823
Look out.

205
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,950
Excuse me.

206
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:24,205
I got on the third line of dialogue.

207
00:21:24,372 --> 00:21:27,334
And all of a sudden I blanked.

208
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,586
Clippity-clop. lgnores me.

209
00:21:29,794 --> 00:21:34,132
- So he said to me, ''Last chance.''
- Last chance.

210
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:37,510
- I came back in.
- Here she comes to ignore me again.

211
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:42,015
I messed up the same line.
But guess what?

212
00:21:43,016 --> 00:21:44,976
He cast me!

213
00:21:45,143 --> 00:21:50,106
Just what the world needs.
Another actress.

214
00:21:56,738 --> 00:21:59,574
Can't live without me?

215
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,873
I'm finally going to ask.
What's with the plastic picnicware?

216
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:11,002
Are you afraid ours isn't clean?

217
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:16,591
- It's a judgment call.
- Give yourself a pep talk.

218
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:21,971
''Must try other people's
clean silverware when dining out.''

219
00:22:24,224 --> 00:22:29,062
- What's wrong with your son?
- What do you care?

220
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,616
He fights to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.

221
00:22:41,783 --> 00:22:47,831
His immune system fails when there's
trouble, so an ear infection ...

222
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:53,253
- ls this bothering you?
- No.

223
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:59,009
An ear infection, anything,
sends him to the emergency room, -

224
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:03,138
- where I get some nine-year-old
they just made a doctor.

225
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:05,682
Nice chatting.

226
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:10,562
- His name?
- Spencer.

227
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:16,901
Spence.

228
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:26,119
It's okay. Go on.

229
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,214
Put on anything you want.

230
00:23:38,423 --> 00:23:42,927
- I might be sort of done here.
- All we do is work. Let's play!

231
00:23:57,942 --> 00:24:04,657
- So you're practically finished?
- Yeah. There is one more stage.

232
00:24:11,706 --> 00:24:15,210
- Where are you going?
- No place. Just to sneak a peek.

233
00:24:27,305 --> 00:24:31,393
- Verdell, you want some chocolate?
- He's not allowed.

234
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:36,272
Wait! I got to take off.
Do you want to say goodbye?

235
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:40,110
- Yeah. He's just got to go.
- Wait.

236
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:42,696
I'm going to look at the painting.

237
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,993
Where are you going?

238
00:24:51,996 --> 00:24:55,291
Want some water?
What's the matter?

239
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,585
You want some water?

240
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:03,633
Simon, wait!

241
00:25:16,187 --> 00:25:19,482
Why are you doing this?

242
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:23,653
No, wait ...

243
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,282
- That painting in there ...
- Are you cruising him?

244
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,084
Excuse me ...

245
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:42,005
- Help me!
- Come on!

246
00:25:43,757 --> 00:25:45,717
Come on.

247
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,691
You call 91 1
and don't leave your name?

248
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:06,613
- Even a dumb geezer knows ...
- Just move on. No one was killed.

249
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,907
Ask him.

250
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:13,453
Don't bark at me.
I didn't name you.

251
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,624
We will. And if he can't,
we'll come back and ask you.

252
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:24,756
Hey. I come from hell. My grandma
has got more attitude than you.

253
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:28,551
Go shake down a 7-1 1
for a day-old wiener.

254
00:26:28,718 --> 00:26:33,223
There's a painting
of one of the guys.

255
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:41,564
- I've been praying for him.
- I'm on my way to the hospital.

256
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:45,944
- Just watch the dog for tonight.
- No, no.

257
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:48,988
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

258
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:54,869
Old bitch. Damn dog.

259
00:26:58,123 --> 00:27:00,875
You're taking him!

260
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:03,211
Get out of the way!

261
00:27:03,378 --> 00:27:06,464
Even the books.

262
00:27:07,298 --> 00:27:09,259
Wait!

263
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:13,555
Do you want to say no to me?

264
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:22,397
I don't want to say nothing to you.

265
00:27:22,814 --> 00:27:29,362
Because I've never felt this crazy.
I almost want you to say no.

266
00:27:32,741 --> 00:27:34,784
Thanks for looking after him.

267
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:41,958
- Hey! Where are you going?
- You don't want to mess with me.

268
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:47,130
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's been in here before.

269
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,345
Hey, Frank.

270
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:20,163
One, two, three, four ...

271
00:28:39,974 --> 00:28:42,602
You're dead.

272
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:46,606
We don't have no dog food here.

273
00:28:46,773 --> 00:28:51,361
You'll eat what we got.
What we eat.

274
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:02,914
Don't you do anything!

275
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:20,223
Where's the trust?

276
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:33,069
Never a break.

277
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:06,811
God!

278
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:11,775
We're halfway through the show
and we haven't sold a painting.

279
00:30:11,983 --> 00:30:15,278
No, we can't reduce the price.

280
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:20,575
- I'm in a free fall here.
- We can see him.

281
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:25,121
I'll meet you in there, okay?

282
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,250
Thank you.

283
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,466
- How are you doing, great one?
- I haven't looked at myself yet.

284
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:41,221
I figured
I could tell from your reaction.

285
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:46,017
- That bad?
- I talked to the doctor and ...

286
00:30:49,896 --> 00:30:55,944
It's not that bad. The doctors say
you'll be your old self again.

287
00:30:56,111 --> 00:31:00,657
The scars might ... Oh, shit!

288
00:31:06,454 --> 00:31:08,415
Jackie ...

289
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:11,710
Hand me a mirror, please.

290
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,221
Wait. I have a smaller one.

291
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:36,568
So how are things, anyway?

292
00:31:36,735 --> 00:31:42,365
- How is Verdell?
- Mr. Udall ... taking care of him.

293
00:31:42,574 --> 00:31:48,204
- How could you? He'll hurt him.
- No, I promise.

294
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:53,209
Not a chance. I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

295
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:56,338
I'm always on the move and ...

296
00:31:56,504 --> 00:31:59,341
Trust me.

297
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:04,262
- You are certain my dog is okay?
- Yes, your dog is fine.

298
00:32:11,144 --> 00:32:14,564
Waiting gives the devil time.

299
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:33,917
Oh, my!

300
00:32:43,718 --> 00:32:46,638
Where did I go?

301
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:50,934
- That's your dog?
- No.

302
00:32:51,893 --> 00:32:55,063
What are you doing with a dog?

303
00:32:55,397 --> 00:33:00,193
- Suckered in, set up.
- You're not worried he'll be taken?

304
00:33:02,821 --> 00:33:06,324
No, not until now.

305
00:33:06,491 --> 00:33:10,412
- Sorry.
- I'm going to sit here.

306
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:13,039
Hey, puppy.

307
00:33:13,832 --> 00:33:17,293
It's so cute.

308
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,463
I wonder what breed he is.

309
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:28,805
He's a little dog. If Bryan's not
here, you can bring him in.

310
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:34,185
How old are you?

311
00:33:34,352 --> 00:33:37,814
To guess by your eyes ... 50.

312
00:33:38,356 --> 00:33:42,610
By your eyes, I'd say you were kind.
So much for eyes.

313
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:47,157
How old are you?
You brought it up. I'm curious.

314
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:52,287
- Not that you're ugly.
- I can take the compliment.

315
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:57,000
But my knees start knocking when
you turn on the charm full blast.

316
00:33:57,208 --> 00:34:00,837
What's with the dark?

317
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:05,467
Dawn patrol.

318
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:09,429
My son had
a full-blown attack.

319
00:34:09,596 --> 00:34:14,934
And for extra fun
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

320
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:17,937
No!

321
00:34:18,104 --> 00:34:22,233
It's bacon for the dog.

322
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:28,323
Last week I was playing the piano
for him. And he likes it.

323
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:34,954
So I decide
I'm going to make a little joke.

324
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,134
It's a beautiful day for our walk.

325
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:03,733
Look at that dog.

326
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,947
I've got to give you
something real good.

327
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:13,201
I'm going to show it to you.

328
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:17,414
Don't be like me.

329
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:23,336
Stay as you are. You're perfect.
I'll get you something to eat.

330
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:28,591
I'd like to be treated like that.

331
00:35:29,926 --> 00:35:34,264
Let's go home and do some writing.

332
00:35:35,557 --> 00:35:40,228
''He had made the girl happy.
And what a girl.''

333
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:44,107
''You've saved my life, she said.''

334
00:35:45,608 --> 00:35:49,112
''You'd better make it up to me.''

335
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:57,954
Done!
Yes, I hate the doggie.

336
00:35:59,122 --> 00:36:02,417
62 books. Done.

337
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:08,673
- We have to cut back all expenses.
- He has no medical insurance?

338
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,887
These are the food receipts,
the household expenses.

339
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:17,807
- Here's one for the dog again.
- I got it.

340
00:36:18,016 --> 00:36:21,061
And all the laundry.

341
00:36:23,271 --> 00:36:30,070
Boy, look at that.
He likes it at Chez Melvin.

342
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:35,950
What are you coming over here for?
I can't cook with a dog near me.

343
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:42,540
Just sit. We don't want any company.
I'll read you Emerson.

344
00:36:54,177 --> 00:37:00,016
- How's Verdell doing?
- He's a pain in the ass.

345
00:37:03,895 --> 00:37:10,485
Simon's home. Can you keep the dog
until he's had a chance to adjust?

346
00:37:10,652 --> 00:37:15,281
It's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

347
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:20,912
He wants him back right away.
He'll be by tomorrow.

348
00:37:22,747 --> 00:37:26,501
Okay.

349
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,343
Hungry? Be right with you.

350
00:38:38,823 --> 00:38:40,784
Mr. Udall.

351
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:50,669
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like ...

352
00:38:50,835 --> 00:38:54,631
Could you take it ...

353
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,802
... just a little easy, Mr. Udall?

354
00:39:02,055 --> 00:39:04,015
Thank you.

355
00:39:06,726 --> 00:39:09,145
Verdell.

356
00:39:10,563 --> 00:39:14,734
Come here, my beautiful boy.
Come here.

357
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:18,321
Let's go home and get well.

358
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:24,452
I can't blame him for being weird.
Look at yourself in the mirror.

359
00:39:28,915 --> 00:39:31,167
Thank you.

360
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:37,340
Come on, sweetheart.

361
00:39:37,507 --> 00:39:40,885
Verdell, come here.

362
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:46,016
I know what you want.

363
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:52,230
Where's my boy?

364
00:39:57,694 --> 00:40:01,448
No, don't force him.

365
00:40:33,188 --> 00:40:37,609
Over a dog!

366
00:40:38,276 --> 00:40:41,863
Over an ugly dog.

367
00:40:48,995 --> 00:40:53,750
Worst sidewalk in New York.
Look where they put it.

368
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:05,220
- Help!
- You'll make an appointment.

369
00:41:05,387 --> 00:41:09,391
How can you diagnose someone as
an obsessive-compulsive disorder -

370
00:41:09,557 --> 00:41:12,560
- and then act like I had a choice
about barging in?

371
00:41:12,727 --> 00:41:16,189
- You must leave.
- You said you could help me.

372
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:21,778
- What was that? A tease?
- If you take responsibility ...

373
00:41:21,986 --> 00:41:25,990
- You changed the room around.
- Two years ago.

374
00:41:26,157 --> 00:41:30,120
I also grew a beard, but you're
not interested in changes in me.

375
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:34,290
I don't have a mountain of time.
I have to get to my restaurant.

376
00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:38,795
Do you know how hard it was for me
to come here?

377
00:41:40,171 --> 00:41:42,549
No, we're not doing this now.

378
00:41:42,716 --> 00:41:47,804
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

379
00:41:48,013 --> 00:41:50,432
No. Nope.

380
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:04,487
What if this is
as good as it gets?

381
00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:19,461
What the heck are those for?

382
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:24,507
No, no, no. Get Carol.

383
00:42:24,674 --> 00:42:30,513
I'm filling in. She might be getting
a job closer to home.

384
00:42:32,807 --> 00:42:37,187
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

385
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:41,441
- What do you mean?
- Look, elephant girl.

386
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:47,238
Go get Carol or something.
Just have her do my one meal here.

387
00:42:47,405 --> 00:42:50,492
I'll pay whatever you want.

388
00:42:52,827 --> 00:42:55,163
Do it!

389
00:42:57,749 --> 00:43:01,211
Bryan. Code blue.

390
00:43:06,591 --> 00:43:10,929
Out! Just shut up and get out.

391
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,852
I'll be quiet.
Just let me stay here. No problem.

392
00:43:18,019 --> 00:43:22,315
Go get Carol.

393
00:43:22,857 --> 00:43:28,071
I'm not a prick.
You are. I'm not judging.

394
00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:33,368
This day has been a disaster.

395
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:37,914
- I'm not sure if I can handle this.
- Get out!

396
00:43:38,957 --> 00:43:45,422
Get out immediately
or there's going to be trouble.

397
00:44:00,645 --> 00:44:02,731
See you.

398
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:06,192
It's about time.

399
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:13,533
- Carol's last name?
- Connelly.

400
00:44:21,249 --> 00:44:25,045
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not any more.

401
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:18,390
I'm hungry.

402
00:45:18,556 --> 00:45:21,810
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

403
00:45:21,976 --> 00:45:26,106
- What are you doing here?
- This is not a sexist thing ...

404
00:45:26,272 --> 00:45:29,693
Are you totally gone?
This is my home.

405
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:37,492
I'm trying to keep emotion aside,
even though it's important.

406
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:42,622
- I have strong feelings on this.
- What?

407
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:48,753
That I wasn't there? Do you have
any control over how creepy you get?

408
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:58,304
Yes, I do.

409
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:04,936
And to prove it ... I have not
gotten personal, and you have.

410
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:10,066
Why aren't you at work?
Are you sick?

411
00:46:12,193 --> 00:46:15,572
You don't look sick.

412
00:46:16,156 --> 00:46:19,868
Just tired and bitter.

413
00:46:21,828 --> 00:46:25,081
My son is sick.

414
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,420
What about your mother?

415
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:36,509
- How do you know about her?
- I hear you talking while I wait.

416
00:46:36,676 --> 00:46:40,764
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- One sec.

417
00:46:49,814 --> 00:46:52,108
How are you doing?

418
00:46:57,822 --> 00:47:00,158
You should answer me.

419
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:05,121
Sorry, Melvin. I can't handle you
teaching my son manners.

420
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:10,543
Back to life.

421
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:20,804
What's wrong?

422
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:27,268
Five one-thousand,
four one-thousand ...

423
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:34,067
- 104.9.
- We're going on a cab ride.

424
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:39,447
Look out, you guys!

425
00:47:40,573 --> 00:47:44,911
Look out.
We're okay. We're okay.

426
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:49,207
Melvin! Wait!

427
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:53,211
Melvin! Wait!

428
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,137
Shut up, kids!

429
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:05,849
Give us a lift, would you?

430
00:48:09,978 --> 00:48:13,314
Cover your mouth when you cough.

431
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:20,613
- Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital.
- Hospital?

432
00:48:21,114 --> 00:48:26,411
- Any chance you'll be back today?
- No! Stay away from me.

433
00:48:30,957 --> 00:48:36,755
We can't put this off any longer.
I feel terrible that I have to ...

434
00:48:37,172 --> 00:48:41,551
Could you just leave the dog
for a second?

435
00:48:43,345 --> 00:48:46,181
Sorry.

436
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:54,064
- What are those cards?
- Frank thought I should have notes.

437
00:48:55,065 --> 00:49:00,070
So I would maintain focus
and not terrify you.

438
00:49:00,236 --> 00:49:05,575
See? He's right.
I need the cards.

439
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,410
SlMON, YOU'RE BROKE

440
00:49:14,209 --> 00:49:19,130
The medical bills are 61,000 now.
And the show didn't go well.

441
00:49:19,297 --> 00:49:24,260
I spoke to your parents.
They didn't hang up or anything.

442
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:28,348
But they'd feel strange calling you.

443
00:49:28,515 --> 00:49:33,144
I can't call them. Come here, baby.

444
00:49:34,396 --> 00:49:36,356
Come here.

445
00:49:36,523 --> 00:49:40,443
Verdell? What's wrong?

446
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:45,115
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am.

447
00:49:45,323 --> 00:49:50,328
Happy to see me, you little mop?
How about a ride down the chute?

448
00:49:50,495 --> 00:49:53,206
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

449
00:49:53,373 --> 00:49:56,126
I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

450
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:57,961
Sorry ...

451
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:04,801
I'll be able to keep my apartment
and the studio, won't I?

452
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:11,474
Oh, my God!

453
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:45,717
Yes, you make us a lot of money.
But it's more appropriate ...

454
00:50:45,884 --> 00:50:52,766
I need this.
Just say, ''Melvin, I'll try.''

455
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,481
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you.

456
00:50:59,647 --> 00:51:06,029
My son just got accepted to Brown.
My husband was dying.

457
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:12,077
Good, nice, thrilled, exciting.
You don't have to wait with me.

458
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:27,384
I can't resist. I just have
so many questions I want to ask you.

459
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:31,763
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

460
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:34,557
What does it mean to you?

461
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:39,437
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

462
00:51:40,689 --> 00:51:43,149
God, this is like a nightmare.

463
00:51:43,817 --> 00:51:47,904
Come on.
Just a couple of questions.

464
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:55,578
- How do you write women so well?
- I think of a man.

465
00:51:55,787 --> 00:52:00,333
And I take away reason
and accountability.

466
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,159
- Mom!
- ln here, Mrs. Connelly.

467
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:37,537
- Please, what?
- I'm ...

468
00:52:37,704 --> 00:52:40,373
- Tell me!
- Dr. Bettes.

469
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:45,462
- Not your name. Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

470
00:52:46,004 --> 00:52:50,508
What's wrong? You know there are
doctors that come to your house?

471
00:52:50,675 --> 00:52:53,470
I'm home.

472
00:52:53,636 --> 00:52:57,974
I didn't know you had an admirer.
Oh, you met the gift.

473
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,395
He's good. I'm an expert on doctors.

474
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:05,565
Okay, doctor?

475
00:53:05,732 --> 00:53:09,444
My wife is
Melvin Udall's publisher.

476
00:53:09,611 --> 00:53:14,991
I'm to take care of this little guy
because you are needed at work.

477
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:19,496
- What kind of work do you do?
- I'm a waitress.

478
00:53:19,704 --> 00:53:23,666
- ln Manhattan.
- Dr. Bettes?

479
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:26,336
Excuse me.

480
00:53:27,879 --> 00:53:32,133
- I'm sorry it took so long.
- I couldn't find it, either.

481
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:38,765
Could you get this to the lab?
I want it back today.

482
00:53:38,932 --> 00:53:45,146
- Did you say ''today''?
- Yes. Let's sit down.

483
00:53:46,064 --> 00:53:51,569
These are the receipts from
all the prescriptions for the year.

484
00:53:51,736 --> 00:53:57,409
- The calendar.
- This is a calendar of days.

485
00:53:57,575 --> 00:54:00,704
- And how he felt.
- Good.

486
00:54:00,912 --> 00:54:05,542
- How long has he had the problem?
- Since forever. Six months old.

487
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,461
Have they done blood tests?

488
00:54:08,628 --> 00:54:12,424
- When he was well?
- No.

489
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,885
- And how about skin testing?
- No.

490
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:19,055
- No standard scratch test?
- No.

491
00:54:19,264 --> 00:54:24,811
They said my plan didn't cover it.
Why? Should they have?

492
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:29,399
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!

493
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:35,071
- I'm sorry.
- That's their technical name.

494
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:43,538
Once the tests come back,
is there someone we should talk to?

495
00:54:43,705 --> 00:54:47,459
Me.
My home number is on the card.

496
00:54:48,626 --> 00:54:51,588
His home number.

497
00:54:56,676 --> 00:54:59,929
- What?
- Your home ...

498
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:09,272
- Can we get you anything else?
- No, thank you.

499
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:13,318
Couple of female slaves?

500
00:55:13,485 --> 00:55:18,239
There's still a lot of tests
I need to do.

501
00:55:18,406 --> 00:55:22,202
Whatever I find out,
I promise you, -

502
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:27,332
- from now on your son is going
to feel a great deal better.

503
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:38,009
Doc!

504
00:55:42,597 --> 00:55:46,643
That's good.

505
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:55,985
Let me know about the costs.
One way or another we'll ...

506
00:55:56,277 --> 00:56:00,240
The costs
are going to be considerable.

507
00:56:00,407 --> 00:56:05,328
But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

508
00:56:08,248 --> 00:56:10,917
That's wonderful.

509
00:56:14,254 --> 00:56:17,799
Thank you for everything, Nora.

510
00:56:18,091 --> 00:56:23,346
Forgive my crankiness. I'll call
when things get back on track.

511
00:56:30,895 --> 00:56:36,317
- What's wrong?
- Who's going to walk Verdell?

512
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,363
No!

513
00:56:55,086 --> 00:56:59,215
- ls he dead yet?
- No.

514
00:57:00,091 --> 00:57:06,222
Would there be any way you would
be willing to walk his dog for him?

515
00:57:06,598 --> 00:57:12,812
- Absolutely.
- You're a wonderful man.

516
00:57:14,022 --> 00:57:20,278
Two o'clock would be a good time.
Here is the key in case he's asleep.

517
00:57:21,529 --> 00:57:26,826
Open his curtains for him
so he can see God's beautiful work.

518
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:31,915
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

519
00:57:32,123 --> 00:57:36,753
Did you learn to talk like this in
a ''Sailor, wanna hump-hump''-bar?

520
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,173
Or is this your last shot
at his whisky?

521
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:44,719
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

522
00:57:52,811 --> 00:57:58,775
No! A goofy man is behind this.
You can't block out that man.

523
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:04,280
Do you really want to go back to
emergency, where they can't help?

524
00:58:04,656 --> 00:58:09,619
This lets a crazy man
into our lives.

525
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:15,625
You know how this will turn out.

526
00:58:15,834 --> 00:58:20,964
This is not like a string of pearls.
You don't send this one back.

527
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,971
Right?

528
00:58:33,018 --> 00:58:38,023
No. I do, I understand.
Listen. I have to go, okay?

529
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:42,861
FRlENDS TO ASK FOR MONEY

530
00:58:43,528 --> 00:58:45,655
Bye.

531
00:58:46,281 --> 00:58:48,241
Bye-bye.

532
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:54,414
What a day ...

533
00:58:54,789 --> 00:58:57,876
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

534
00:58:58,043 --> 00:59:00,795
Thank you for walking him.

535
00:59:02,714 --> 00:59:08,178
- Excuse me, I'm not feeling well.
- This place smells like shit.

536
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:10,513
Go away.

537
00:59:10,805 --> 00:59:16,144
- This cleaning lady doesn't ..?
- Please, just leave.

538
00:59:17,729 --> 00:59:22,692
- What happened to your friends?
- Get out of here!

539
00:59:28,073 --> 00:59:31,409
There's nothing worse than having
to feel this way in front of you.

540
00:59:32,952 --> 00:59:37,707
Nellie.
Your a disgrace to depression.

541
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:44,714
- Rot in hell, Melvin.
- No need to stop being a lady.

542
00:59:44,923 --> 00:59:48,093
You'll be back on your knees
in no time.

543
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:00,063
ls this fun for you?

544
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:06,611
It keeps getting better and better.
I'm losing my apartment, Melvin.

545
01:00:06,778 --> 01:00:11,741
Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

546
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:14,452
And I won't.

547
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:17,914
I don't want to paint any more.

548
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:21,584
The life I was trying for, is over.

549
01:00:21,793 --> 01:00:27,590
The life I had is gone
and I'm feeling sorry for myself.

550
01:00:28,133 --> 01:00:33,596
It's high times for you, isn't it?
The gay neighbour is terrified.

551
01:00:34,222 --> 01:00:36,641
Terrified!

552
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:52,323
I was trying to give you a boost.

553
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:57,245
Lucky you.
You're here for rock bottom.

554
01:00:57,412 --> 01:01:01,791
You absolute horror
of a human being.

555
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:19,476
The one thing I'll do for you
might cheer you up.

556
01:01:19,684 --> 01:01:22,145
Get out.

557
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:26,441
You want to know why the dog
prefers me? It's not affection.

558
01:01:26,608 --> 01:01:29,277
It's a trick.

559
01:01:31,279 --> 01:01:34,574
I keep bacon in my pocket.

560
01:01:35,116 --> 01:01:37,327
See?

561
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:48,963
We'll both call him. You'll see.
It's a trick.

562
01:01:57,305 --> 01:02:00,684
Come here, Verdell.

563
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,024
Come on.

564
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,402
Come here.

565
01:02:15,657 --> 01:02:19,577
Just a stupid dog.

566
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:26,876
Could you leave now? Please?

567
01:02:28,962 --> 01:02:32,507
I don't get it.

568
01:04:08,895 --> 01:04:10,855
Mr. Udall!

569
01:04:12,691 --> 01:04:16,152
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

570
01:04:25,954 --> 01:04:30,583
The doctors gave me your address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

571
01:04:36,214 --> 01:04:39,217
If you ...

572
01:04:41,803 --> 01:04:48,852
- If it's about thanking me ...
- That's not why I'm here.

573
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:54,274
Though it's nice to talk to
a real doctor about Spencer.

574
01:04:56,901 --> 01:05:01,031
Note. Put it in a note.

575
01:05:09,622 --> 01:05:15,045
- I have a hairdryer.
- Why did you do this for me?

576
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:24,471
- So you'd come back to work.
- That sounds strange.

577
01:05:27,766 --> 01:05:31,353
I'm worried you did this ...

578
01:05:46,493 --> 01:05:51,414
Are you waiting for me
to say something?

579
01:05:53,792 --> 01:05:56,378
Look ...

580
01:05:58,046 --> 01:06:03,593
- I'll be there tomorrow.
- I need to clear this up now.

581
01:06:05,011 --> 01:06:07,806
Clear what up?

582
01:06:09,182 --> 01:06:14,437
I'm not going to sleep with you.
I will never sleep with you.

583
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,982
Not ever!

584
01:06:22,487 --> 01:06:26,825
I'm sorry, but ...

585
01:06:28,702 --> 01:06:34,207
... we don't open
for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

586
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:41,214
- I'm not kidding.
- Anything else?

587
01:06:42,841 --> 01:06:47,762
Just ... thank you.

588
01:06:53,184 --> 01:06:56,312
So you will be at work tomorrow?

589
01:06:58,857 --> 01:07:01,317
Yes.

590
01:07:16,082 --> 01:07:19,502
''Never'', she said.
