[male narrator]  
In the seventeen years  
since the nuclear war

5
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:03,758
all human survivors  
were herded into cities

6
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:07,103
now run like prisons  
by a computer system

artificial intelligence

rather than eliminate the  
infertile survivors.

00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:17,965

their lives until extinction.

I just got the radio

The boat will meet us
in 37 hours at the harbor.

Good work,
go tell the others.

Hey Mary, look.
I found two patches of them.

68
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,379
You'll see when we
get to the beach.

69
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:44,103
Thank you.

00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:52,172
How are you feeling, Mary?

71
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:59,413
I am excited, Ben
but I'm a little nervous too.

72
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:01,724
This isn't just another
supply run, you know.

73
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,655
You know, we've been
planning this for months.

74
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:09,206
I can't help it.
I may not be carrying him.

75
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:10,551
But he's still my baby.

76
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,793
That's why we cant
afford to raise him here.

77
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:16,482
Look, maybe one day,
we'll beat the system.

78
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:20,379
But right now, the safest place
for you to be is Europe.

79
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:23,137
You're the only source
of all what we have.

80
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:24,827
And as far as we know

81
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:28,310
this is the only living fetus
on this infertile planet.

82

- Right.

Alright everybody,
synchronize your timers.

96
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,758
You've got exactly
36 hours to cross the city

97
00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:08,137
and get to the port.

98
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:10,448
Let me remind you
that the fetus cant survive

99
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,034
any longer than that in the
temporary capsule.

100
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:16,172
The European artificial womb
is on the boat.

101
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,241
If the fetus gets to it
on time

102
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,689
it can develop
there safely until birth.

103
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:23,241
Until then, Mary will be feeding
him every few hours.

'Is everyone clear
on the route?'

105
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:28,931

to avoid the danger zones.

106
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,793

are unsafe now.

What about the Ozzie
blocker tablets?

112

These are only a blocking agent
against radio activity.

113

all contaminated substances.

something's gonna save em'.

I take it, you don't believe in
anything like that.

365
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm what you call, a realist.
The only thing real is me.

366
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,344
That's all I can afford to
believe in.

367
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:58,275
Everything else is just like
some uh...bad dream.

368
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:04,034
Yeah well..

369
00:38:04,103 --> 00:38:07,689
If you're not going to eat. I'd
at least get some rest, Mary.

00:38:07,758 --> 00:38:10,241
The sun will be up
in an hour or so.

371
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:13,137
- I'm not tired.
- Suit yourself.

00:38:22,206 --> 00:38:23,206
Mary.

373
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,793
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

374
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:40,137
You can sleep here.

375
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,413
Don't worry, baby. Everything's
going to be alright.

415

We don't have any more bullets.
My ammo supplies are ways away.

416
00:46:46,793 --> 00:46:49,275
What difference does it make?
That cyborg has been shot

- Radioactive cannibals

meet up with them unarmed.

will we lose?

Look. You better
stay here, alright?

437
00:49:15,206 --> 00:49:16,655
Take the gun.

438
00:49:16,724 --> 00:49:18,689
What good is it
with no bullets?

439
00:49:18,758 --> 00:49:20,379
Nobody else knows that.

440
00:49:20,448 --> 00:49:23,344
Now, you keep an eye out.
I'll be right back.

Give me your piece.

455
00:52:14,862 --> 00:52:20,413
Now. Ooh, Tuesday is usually
my shopping day, but..

...beggars can't
be choosers now, can they?

- Give me your bag.
- No.

458
00:52:27,413 --> 00:52:29,689
Give me your fucking bag, bitch.

459
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:39,758
Now...while you're at it

460
00:52:39,827 --> 00:52:45,827
why don't you just...slip
out of those pants?

some summer pants. '

Leather gets so sticky
this time of the year. Don't it?

463
00:52:52,655 --> 00:52:54,896
You want me to take
off my pants?

464
00:52:54,965 --> 00:52:59,068
Oh no. Mind I climb
in there with you

465
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:03,965
and we'll enter in three legged
race?Drop your drawers, bitch.

466
00:53:05,379 --> 00:53:06,965
Hello, Carp.

467
00:53:08,413 --> 00:53:10,344
Didn't know you
were into women.

468
00:53:10,413 --> 00:53:13,241
I could say
the same thing about you.

469
00:53:14,379 --> 00:53:17,034
- Hand it over, Carpi.
- Why?

470
00:53:17,103 --> 00:53:19,206
I know you don't got
any ammo left.

471
00:53:19,275 --> 00:53:21,586
That's the only reason
you ever come around anymore.

472
00:53:21,655 --> 00:53:23,793
If you think you're right,
take your chances.

473
00:53:31,862 --> 00:53:35,310
I knew it.
The gun's empty, ain't it?

474
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,551
Should've taken your chances.

475
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:41,344
You're a real piece of work.
You know that Austin?

476
00:53:41,413 --> 00:53:45,413
And to think, I was actually
starting to miss you.

477
00:53:45,482 --> 00:53:49,586
You're the only one who knows
about my stash. Now where is it?

478
00:53:49,655 --> 00:53:54,448
So, this is
your new squeeze, huh?

479
00:53:54,517 --> 00:53:57,724
Like she's gonna last
a day out there on the streets.

480
00:54:00,931 --> 00:54:03,827
Mary, this is Carp.
I'm taking Mary to the port.

481
00:54:03,896 --> 00:54:05,517
What, are you nuts?

482
00:54:05,586 --> 00:54:09,965
She's getting a shipment of RZB.
Giving me all I can carry.

483
00:54:10,034 --> 00:54:13,137
Oh. So now you're mister
Big Shot?

484
00:54:13,206 --> 00:54:15,965
If you'd shut up a minute,
I was gonna tell you

485
00:54:16,034 --> 00:54:20,000
I'll be back tomorrow. There'll
be plenty to have us go around.

486
00:54:20,068 --> 00:54:23,413
So what?
You're cutting me in?

487
00:54:23,482 --> 00:54:25,965
Just thinking about it.
Yeah.

488
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:29,551
Well, this changes everything.

489
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,000
Knew it would.

490
00:54:33,482 --> 00:54:37,275
Here you go, kid.
Those are my lucky specs.

491
00:54:38,965 --> 00:54:41,103
You wear them well.

492
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,931
Austin, we should go.

493
00:54:51,034 --> 00:54:53,068
- So, see you tomorrow, Carp.
- Yeah, don't forget.

494
00:54:53,137 --> 00:54:55,655
That's what you said
last time. How long was that?

495
00:54:55,724 --> 00:54:58,793
Two-three weeks? I ain't
waiting around this time.

496
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,862
Son of a bitch.

497
00:55:07,965 --> 00:55:09,413
- This Carp.
- What about her?

498
00:55:09,482 --> 00:55:11,482
She seems a
little strange.

499
00:55:11,551 --> 00:55:13,551
Yeah, she's been through
a lot of shit.

500
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,551
- Are you two..
- What?

501
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,862
Well, you two just
seem very close.

502
00:55:18,931 --> 00:55:20,965
Yeah, you could
say that.

503
00:55:21,034 --> 00:55:22,965
How close are
you two, exactly?

504
00:55:23,034 --> 00:55:24,482
What do you mean?

505
00:55:24,551 --> 00:55:26,758
Are you in
love with her?

506
00:55:28,655 --> 00:55:30,965
Me, with her?

507
00:55:31,034 --> 00:55:33,620
No...she's a friend.

508
00:55:33,689 --> 00:55:36,310
Probably the closest thing
I've got to family.

509
00:55:36,379 --> 00:55:38,344
So, you're like
brother and sister.

510
00:55:41,275 --> 00:55:42,689
Yeah.

511
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,586
Can we go now?

512
00:56:09,724 --> 00:56:10,655
Ahh.

513
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,689
What the hell
is this?

514
00:56:18,103 --> 00:56:19,724
I asked you
a question.

515
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,482
You wouldn't
understand.

516
00:56:21,551 --> 00:56:23,241
Try me.

517
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:26,517
It's a fetus,
a human fetus.

518
00:56:26,586 --> 00:56:28,034
It's not alive,
is it?

519
00:56:28,103 --> 00:56:30,655
Yes, and it's up to me
to keep him alive.

520
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:33,241
What kind of bullshit were
those lab people feeding you?

521
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,689
Don't you know that women
can't get pregnant anymore?

522
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:38,551
Well, they found one who can.
Isn't this proof enough?

523
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,068
Explain.

524
00:56:40,137 --> 00:56:42,379
I don't have time
to explain it right now.

525
00:56:42,448 --> 00:56:44,275
You believe this
is gonna stay alive?

526
00:56:44,344 --> 00:56:47,310
Yes, if I get it
to the port on time.

527
00:56:47,379 --> 00:56:48,827
What's at the port?

528
00:56:48,896 --> 00:56:51,551
I told you. I'm meeting
a boat there.

529
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,379
And you're trading this-this
fetus for the RZB?

530
00:56:56,482 --> 00:56:59,379
There is no RZB.

531
00:56:59,448 --> 00:57:00,931
What?

532
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,310
This baby is going to Europe
to start a new race of humans

533
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,965
genetically
healthy humans.

534
00:57:07,034 --> 00:57:09,206
'It's our last hope,
Austin'.

535
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:10,862
Don't be mad.

536
00:57:12,517 --> 00:57:14,931
Mad? Why should I be mad?

537
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,758
I'm risking my life,
taking you across the city

538
00:57:17,827 --> 00:57:20,965
and when we make it,
if we make it, I get nothing.

539
00:57:21,034 --> 00:57:23,379
No RZB, nothing.

540
00:57:23,448 --> 00:57:25,586
Sounds like a real
square deal to me.

541
00:57:31,896 --> 00:57:33,896
I trusted you, Mary.

542
00:57:35,482 --> 00:57:37,379
You really
had me going.

543
00:57:38,724 --> 00:57:41,965
'Ship load RZB. What the hell
was I thinking?'

544
00:57:42,034 --> 00:57:45,000
- Austin, listen--
- No. You listen.

545
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,586
You lied to me.

546
00:57:48,655 --> 00:57:50,448
You asked me
to die for nothing.

547
00:57:50,517 --> 00:57:54,034
It's not for nothing. This baby
could save the human race.

548
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:55,551
It's nothing to me.

549
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:58,137
I don't care what bullshit
science fiction you buy into

550
00:57:58,206 --> 00:58:01,172
but I'm not gonna risk my life
saving some lab women's baby.

551
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:03,034
It's my baby.

552
00:58:03,931 --> 00:58:05,689
'I was desperate.'

553
00:58:05,758 --> 00:58:08,655
The cyborg killed the people
who were supposed to take me.

554
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:12,827
What was I
supposed to do?

555
00:58:12,896 --> 00:58:14,517
Could have told me the truth.

556
00:58:14,586 --> 00:58:18,241
Oh, and you would've agreed.

557
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:21,206
Let me explain
something to you.

558
00:58:21,275 --> 00:58:24,275
Seventeen years ago,
there was a nuclear war.

559
00:58:24,344 --> 00:58:26,275
The lucky ones
were killed.

560
00:58:26,344 --> 00:58:28,448
You and me, and the rest of us

561
00:58:28,517 --> 00:58:30,448
are just the broken leftovers.

562
00:58:30,517 --> 00:58:31,965
What you gonna do?

563
00:58:32,034 --> 00:58:35,068
Raise your kid in a country with
fresh and clean radio-activity?

564
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,586
It's different in Europe.

565
00:58:36,655 --> 00:58:38,241
What could be
different there?

566
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:41,172
'There's a rebellion. People
are fighting the machines.'

567
00:58:41,241 --> 00:58:43,275
They're growing
food again.

568
00:58:43,344 --> 00:58:45,275
Things are getting better
and this baby

569
00:58:45,344 --> 00:58:48,862
is the most important
part of it.

570
00:58:48,931 --> 00:58:51,551
Sorry.
I'm going back.

571
00:58:52,724 --> 00:58:54,931
You can come with me
if you want.

572
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,931
Goodbye, then.

573
00:59:17,896 --> 00:59:20,310
[beeping]

574
00:59:27,586 --> 00:59:30,517
[dramatic music]

575
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:01,620
[hissing]

576
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:03,172
[screams]

577
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:05,724
Gr-r.
Ga-ah!

578
01:00:07,034 --> 01:00:08,586
[Mary screaming]

579
01:00:16,206 --> 01:00:19,068
[violin music]

580
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:44,344
[crowd chanting]
'Food, food, food, food!'

581
01:00:44,413 --> 01:00:46,689
Food, food--

582
01:00:46,758 --> 01:00:48,724
[shouts]

583
01:00:53,793 --> 01:00:56,482
[thunder roaring]

584
01:01:06,862 --> 01:01:11,379
You remind me of
a painting I once saw..

585
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:13,482
...of woman.

586
01:01:13,551 --> 01:01:16,655
From sometime..

587
01:01:16,724 --> 01:01:19,724
...long since dead.

588
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,862
I do not recall now,
the artist.

589
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:29,689
But it struck me,
it strikes me now..

590
01:01:29,758 --> 01:01:34,655
...that such beauty is wasted
on such a faulty sense as sight.

591
01:01:37,931 --> 01:01:40,068
You see..

592
01:01:40,137 --> 01:01:44,172
...I believe beauty can
only truly be appreciated

593
01:01:44,241 --> 01:01:46,379
through taste.

594
01:01:47,689 --> 01:01:49,172
Through taste!

595
01:01:49,241 --> 01:01:53,103
[all]
Yeah, yeah..

596
01:01:55,655 --> 01:01:59,172
So, in honor
to your divine image..

597
01:01:59,241 --> 01:02:04,068
...tonight we shall not merely
behold you with our eyes.

598
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,068
Tonight, we feast!

599
01:02:06,137 --> 01:02:07,206
[all]
Feast!

600
01:02:15,137 --> 01:02:19,965
[crowd chanting]
'Food, food, food, food.'

601
01:02:20,034 --> 01:02:25,206
'Food, food, food,
food, food, food.'

602
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:26,344
'Food, food, food..'

603
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:28,206
[explosion]

604
01:02:28,275 --> 01:02:30,172
[clamoring]

605
01:02:30,241 --> 01:02:32,034
[screaming]

606
01:02:35,448 --> 01:02:36,655
[screaming continues]

607
01:02:36,724 --> 01:02:39,793
- Let her go!
- Kill that bastard.

608
01:02:40,448 --> 01:02:41,896
A-ah!

609
01:02:41,965 --> 01:02:43,965
[gun firing]

610
01:02:47,586 --> 01:02:48,586
A-ah!

611
01:02:59,862 --> 01:03:01,000
[groaning]

612
01:03:04,206 --> 01:03:05,586
Argh!

613
01:03:08,137 --> 01:03:09,517
A-ah!

614
01:03:20,275 --> 01:03:22,793
A-ah!

615
01:03:22,862 --> 01:03:25,758
[Leech]
'Kill him
Kill him!'

616
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:30,172
- Kill him!
- Look out!

617
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:34,137
[grunting]

618
01:03:46,241 --> 01:03:47,241
[groans]

619
01:04:04,448 --> 01:04:06,103
[Leech]
'Kill him!'

620
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:11,931
Give it back!

621
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,068
Oh, you..

622
01:04:15,034 --> 01:04:17,000
Give it back to me!

623
01:04:20,551 --> 01:04:23,482
[dramatic music]

624
01:04:24,344 --> 01:04:26,000
[Mary sobs]

625
01:04:37,344 --> 01:04:39,620
Austin, he took my baby.

626
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:42,103
Get him, hurry!

627
01:04:47,344 --> 01:04:48,379
Oh!

628
01:04:52,724 --> 01:04:55,620
- Give it back!
- Fuck you.

629
01:05:00,793 --> 01:05:03,655
[dramatic music]

630
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:39,310
[grunts]

631
01:05:40,862 --> 01:05:43,413
[Leech growling]

632
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,275
A-argh!

633
01:06:03,379 --> 01:06:06,275
[dramatic music]

634
01:06:29,137 --> 01:06:31,241
What are you going
to name him?

635
01:06:33,275 --> 01:06:34,689
[sighs]

636
01:06:34,758 --> 01:06:36,689
I don't know.

637
01:06:36,758 --> 01:06:39,793
I was thinking about
naming him after my dad.

638
01:06:43,551 --> 01:06:45,206
Is he still alive?

639
01:06:45,275 --> 01:06:48,172
No, both my parents
were killed.

640
01:06:49,344 --> 01:06:51,000
In the blast?

641
01:06:52,482 --> 01:06:55,137
No, it was later.

642
01:06:55,206 --> 01:06:57,551
We were living in a shelter.

643
01:06:59,137 --> 01:07:02,344
One night, someone
was banging down the doors.

644
01:07:03,758 --> 01:07:07,172
My mother kept screaming,
"Cyborgs, cyborgs!"

645
01:07:08,413 --> 01:07:11,103
'She hid me
in a storage bin.'

646
01:07:12,586 --> 01:07:14,655
I heard some scuffling..

647
01:07:14,724 --> 01:07:17,758
...some screams and shouts..

648
01:07:17,827 --> 01:07:19,586
...gunshots.

649
01:07:20,586 --> 01:07:23,241
And after,
only silence.

650
01:07:25,137 --> 01:07:27,034
How did you survive?

651
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:33,379
Sometime later, these two
scientists came by the shelter.

652
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:37,793
I was only five years old.

653
01:07:37,862 --> 01:07:41,862
They took me to this underground
lab they were building.

654
01:07:41,931 --> 01:07:44,724
Over the years,
more people joined in.

655
01:07:44,793 --> 01:07:46,931
It was like a family.

656
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:51,965
I don't remember
anything about my family.

657
01:07:54,793 --> 01:07:57,448
I always dreamt
about having one.

658
01:07:58,724 --> 01:08:01,931
- Sounds stupid, I know.
- It's not stupid.

659
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,275
Without dreams,
there's just reality

660
01:08:04,344 --> 01:08:06,689
and what kind of reality
is it out there?

661
01:08:06,758 --> 01:08:08,379
It's a nightmare.

662
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:14,896
My God, Austin,
your wound..

663
01:08:15,896 --> 01:08:18,034
'...it's all healed.'

664
01:08:19,068 --> 01:08:21,448
Must be the RZB.

665
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:29,862
Maybe you're just
a good nurse, Mary.

666
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:37,241
Earlier, when you were
taking care of me..

667
01:08:40,758 --> 01:08:43,310
...I wanted
to kiss you.

668
01:08:44,344 --> 01:08:47,103
I've never
been kissed before.

669
01:09:09,206 --> 01:09:10,517
Come on.

670
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:15,793
[techno music]

671
01:09:21,379 --> 01:09:22,827
Mary..

672
01:09:22,896 --> 01:09:24,793
...here, take the gun.

673
01:09:24,862 --> 01:09:26,448
Keep running!

674
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:32,034

[metal clanging]

681
01:10:28,068 --> 01:10:30,241
Come on.
Over here.

682
01:10:37,413 --> 01:10:39,000
Hurry, come on.

683
01:10:40,655 --> 01:10:41,931
Come on!

684
01:10:56,172 --> 01:10:58,068
Get down,
get down!

685
01:11:22,793 --> 01:11:24,344

687
01:11:48,034 --> 01:11:49,413
A-ah!

688
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:58,172
- Austin, are you okay?
- Yeah, let's go.

689
01:12:04,517 --> 01:12:05,793

[sobbing]

696
01:13:03,034 --> 01:13:05,586
A-ah!
Ow!

697
01:13:15,517 --> 01:13:19,724
No....no, no!

698
01:13:19,793 --> 01:13:22,379
No! No! No!

699
01:13:22,448 --> 01:13:26,758
No! No! No!
Oh, God!

700
01:13:26,827 --> 01:13:28,344
Austin?

701
01:13:36,689 --> 01:13:37,896
Oh..

702
01:13:37,965 --> 01:13:40,689
Oh, my God,
what did he do to you?

703
01:13:42,137 --> 01:13:44,034
- Hold on, let me see.
- No.

704
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:48,896
I'll be alright, you go ahead.
You've got to get to the port.

705
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,206
Mary.

706
01:14:13,965 --> 01:14:18,241
You're a cyborg.
You lied to me.

707
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:21,965
Mary, no...no, I--

708
01:14:22,034 --> 01:14:23,758
Shut up!

709
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:28,517
Mary, listen to me,
I didn't know.

710
01:14:28,586 --> 01:14:31,206
Shut the fuck up,
you're one of them!

711
01:14:32,379 --> 01:14:34,655
I was protecting you.

712
01:14:35,862 --> 01:14:38,068
You told that
I was going to the port.

713
01:14:38,137 --> 01:14:39,586
No.

714
01:14:39,655 --> 01:14:41,275
No, I didn't.

715
01:14:42,172 --> 01:14:44,137
I didn't, Mary.

716
01:14:44,206 --> 01:14:48,793
I trusted you.
I was counting on you.

717
01:14:50,172 --> 01:14:52,413
I'm not what you think.

718
01:14:52,482 --> 01:14:54,448
Someone lied to me.

719
01:14:56,448 --> 01:14:59,137
But they don't control me.

720
01:14:59,206 --> 01:15:02,896
This is all a big plot
to kill my baby.

721
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:05,655
Just like your kind
slaughtered my parents.

722
01:15:07,034 --> 01:15:09,862
But this time,
I'm not gonna let you do it.

723
01:15:09,931 --> 01:15:12,862
No one's gonna touch my baby!

[screams]

735
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:03,137
- Ain't this acid rain a bitch?
- Why are you following me?

736
01:18:03,206 --> 01:18:05,206
I'm not following you,
I heard you scream.

737
01:18:05,275 --> 01:18:06,724
I figured you're in trouble.

738
01:18:06,793 --> 01:18:07,965
What, lost or something?

739
01:18:08,034 --> 01:18:09,965
How far is it to the ocean?

740
01:18:10,034 --> 01:18:11,448
About a mile.

741
01:18:11,517 --> 01:18:14,827
- So, where's Mr. Reliable?
- I don't know, he left.

742
01:18:14,896 --> 01:18:17,068
Sounds like the Austin I know.

743
01:18:18,344 --> 01:18:19,827
I've got to go.

744
01:18:19,896 --> 01:18:22,724
You go that way,
you'll burn your ass.

745
01:18:22,793 --> 01:18:24,896
Come on, I'll show you
the right way.

746
01:18:26,793 --> 01:18:28,758
You're not like him, are you?

747
01:18:28,827 --> 01:18:31,413
Hey, I don't need
to be like Austin.

748
01:18:35,896 --> 01:18:38,137
I think these are yours.

749
01:18:39,241 --> 01:18:41,137
My lucky specs.

750
01:18:41,206 --> 01:18:42,931
They got me this far.

751
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,965
Yeah, I hated parting
with 'em..

752
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:46,482
...but like Austin says..

753
01:18:46,551 --> 01:18:49,724
..."There's shit you won't do
for your friends."

754
01:18:49,793 --> 01:18:52,310
Now, we better get going
before it starts raining again.

755
01:18:52,379 --> 01:18:55,379
Now, you go down
and then you keep to your right.

756
01:18:55,448 --> 01:18:57,172
And then you take
the second left.

757
01:18:57,241 --> 01:18:58,689
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes.

758
01:18:58,758 --> 01:19:00,344
Second left..

759
01:19:00,413 --> 01:19:02,344
...and then you go straight.

760
01:19:02,413 --> 01:19:04,931
And then it's about
a mile to the ocean.

761
01:19:07,344 --> 01:19:09,206
Thanks.

I'm sorry.

820
01:28:51,655 --> 01:28:53,931
I was just
so scared and confused.

821
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,965
It's okay. I know.

822
01:28:57,034 --> 01:28:59,172
I didn't know either.

823
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
They must've screwed up
when they made me.

I can't.

827

The baby's gonna need a father.

828

He'll have a great mother.

829
01:29:19,379 --> 01:29:21,000
Please, Austin.

I can beat them.

All those people back
in the city need hope.

833

I can be their hope.

834
01:29:38,551 --> 01:29:41,931
I'm gonna name the baby Austin.

835
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,344
And as he grows up, I'm gonna
tell him all about you.
