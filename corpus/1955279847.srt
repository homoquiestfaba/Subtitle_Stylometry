1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Maybe I’ve never felt like this

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So I just don’t understand

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,400
Maybe I’m not what you think I am

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,500
Nobody knew how to hold me

5
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,299
Without room for secrets to breathe

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,200
Only to pull me in tighter

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,500
So I couldn't see

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,000
Now I’m wondering I’m thinking

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,100
It’s something like a disarray

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,800
And the memories streaming
down my face

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,300
Cuz I was strewn across

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,400
your living room

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,900
But you never did

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,560
know what to do

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,000
about me and you

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,700
With all the sorry’s inside me

17
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,200
I just can’t muster one up

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,500
A tragic misunderstanding of love

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,500
I try so hard to be happy

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,000
Try not to ride that train

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,300
But when it finally happens

22
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,200
I run away

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,700
Now I’m wondering I’m thinking

24
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,200
It’s something like a disarray

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,000
And the memories streaming
down my face

26
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,350
Cuz I was strewn across

27
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,700
your living room

28
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,900
But you never did

29
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,200
know what to do

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,500
about me and you

31
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,600
Hello, Miss Winston

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,800
My usual, please. -- black

33
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,800
So sorry to hear about Amy.
She was your best friend, wasn't she?

34
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,100
Yes.

35
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,000
My mother says
losing your best friend

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,700
can be as hard
as losing your husband.

37
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,300
Have you ever been married?

38
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,000
Why do you ask?

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,800
My mother told me that when someone
asks you that question you just say

40
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,100
"why do you ask?"

41
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,100
-- stops me in the tracks

42
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,000
Lola, if you don't learn the
-- rules

43
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,300
then everything you write will give evidence
of a compromised education.

44
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,500
It will scream out
"I have no interest in excellence",

45
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,400
"I'm not smart",
"I'm average",

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,000
"I don't deserve a good grade
or a good job"

47
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,900
Now, do you want your writing
to ruin all your chances for success?

48
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,500
Let's go over this
one more time.

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,760
Sarah,

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,400
I've been meaning
to call you.

51
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,900
Lola has decided that she'd
like to try another tutor.

52
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,560
You understand,
sometimes our pairings are a mismatch.

53
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,000
Lola is lazy.

54
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,800
Lola wants someone
who won't challenge her,

55
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,300
she wants someone
who won't expect anything from her.

56
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,700
We just think another personality
might work better with her.

57
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,200
Excuse me.

58
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,300
Please, I'd like to have the bike

59
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,300
It's 50 dollars.
I told you we can't afford it.

60
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,200
But you promised.

61
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,500
I know.
We can't afford it.

62
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,200
Please.

63
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,200
Excuse me.

64
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,200
--

65
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,200
Don’t underestimate me

66
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,100
And tell me to behave

67
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,600
You got it easy baby

68
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,300
Don’t say "I feel the same"

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,800
You warned me to be careful

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,900
Be smart enough to wait

71
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,700
It’s more than I can handle

72
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,900
I’d like to set things straight

73
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,700
You called it right,
I’m in the wrong

74
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,300
I should be shot for thinking
I could understand

75
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,400
You called it right,

76
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,100
You knew all along

77
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,600
I would be shocked
I had to shake the underhand

78
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:39,600
You keep believing in the one thing
I’ll keep believing in the other

79
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,600
You called it right
You called it right

80
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,100
Don’t say I’m going crazy

81
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,900
See I just forget my place

82
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,100
It’s not the fool you make me

83
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
This one seems real friendly.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,100
- Is he house-broken?
- Absolutely.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Bless you.

86
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,900
Shakespeare.

87
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,600
House-broken?

88
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,000
Somebody who never speaks.

89
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,300
I will see you later, okay?

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,100
- Bye.
- See you.

91
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,500
You look so hard
For something real

92
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,800
But I can't hurt
And you can't feel

93
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,700
So run alone,
run alone, run alone

94
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,600
On your feet
You kick my knees

95
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,100
Leave me here
On your empty street

96
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,900
Run alone,
run alone, run alone

97
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,800
'Cause you're gone without a trace

98
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,800
leave those lies
to lay across my face

99
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,400
I was here
waiting for your call

100
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,300
Just to hear
you say nothing at all

101
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:22,400
But you're no fake,
my sweet mistake

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,799
It's a sad,
sad world you're living in

103
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,200
Where no one breaths
under their skin

104
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,300
But you pretend,
you pretend, hey yeah

105
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,600
That your gone
Without a trace

106
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,600
Leave those lies
to lay across my face

107
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,500
I was here
waiting for your call

108
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,100
Just to hear
you say nothing at all

109
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:19,800
But you're no fake,
my sweet mistake

110
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,400
Anything specific
bothering you today?

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,960
Yes.

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,960
One of my friends
died of cancer recently.

113
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Another just had a heart attack.
So yes, that bothers me a lot.

114
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,300
--

115
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,700
I'm in a blue petal sky of roses, daisies...

116
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,800
spinning inside my mind

117
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,400
and as I float through the mist,

118
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,400
the world below me
seems so far behind.

119
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,900
like I can fly fly fly
nothing seems to matter

120
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,700
now that you're here beside me.

121
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:19,800
fly fly fly
When I'm here with you I feel alive.

122
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,900
And all the cars swirling by
in motion seem like

123
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,400
they could be paralyzed

124
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,700
and the light
inside me feels so bright

125
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,900
it's hard for me to deny

126
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,600
like I can fly fly fly
nothing seems to matter,

127
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,460
now that you're here beside me.

128
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,900
Do you know where the group meets?

129
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,200
I think it might be a Bible study group.

130
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,900
Sorry?

131
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,700
Do you know where the meeting is?

132
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,200
Oh, yes. I'm going myself.
Come with me.

133
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
You can just put your umbrella
right there.

134
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Okay, come.

135
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,000
…that God could and would
if He was sought.

136
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,500
Anyone feel like sharing?

137
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,100
I'm Hank and I'm an alcoholic.

138
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Come on.

139
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,600
As most of you know
I had my first drink when I was 13.

140
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,700
And ever since that time

141
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,500
I've liked the way alcohol
makes me feel: numb.

142
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,300
And I wish I was numb today.

143
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
My ex-wife is getting remarried.

144
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,300
I never saw that coming.

145
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,500
And as crazy as it sounds
and as much as we fought

146
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,200
I always thought
we'd get back together.

147
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,000
But thanks to Leo, my sponsor,
I made it through another day.

148
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,000
I called about 13 times
but he picked up every time.

149
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,500
He was a minister
before he retired.

150
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,700
He's a good man
and he was there for me.

151
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,900
So thank you, Leo.

152
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,000
'Cause I know
I was --.

153
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,200
So, you come in.

154
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,100
You're new,
aren't you?

155
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,300
I see you're feeling
exactly the way I did my first time.

156
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,000
But let assure
you will not regret.

157
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,600
- Name is Kit.
- Sarah.

158
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,900
Nice to meet you.

159
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,600
Wait!

160
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,000
I really didn't get the chance
to introduce myself.

161
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,100
I'm Darla.

162
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,600
This is Sarah.
It's her first time.

163
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,500
I could tell.

164
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,700
Do you have a sponsor here tonight?

165
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,500
A sponsor?

166
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,400
No, I don't.

167
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Do you ever think of changing
your hairstyle?

168
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Why do you ask?

169
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,300
Cause I think you would look
so much younger

170
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,900
with your hair loose
around your face.

171
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,200
--
makes you look 10 years older
than you really are.

172
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,400
I have to be going.

173
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,300
Listen.

174
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,100
I know I'm just a kid
but I've been in the program a while now

175
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,100
and I can help you.

176
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,300
Good night.

177
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,100
See you later, then.

178
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,700
And remember,
keep coming back!

179
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,000
Who is there?

180
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,000
It's Kit.
Our meeting is about to start.

181
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,600
I'm not going.

182
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
Yes, you are.

183
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,600
I won't take "no"
for an answer.

184
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,200
It's really not a good time.

185
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,400
It's never a good time
but you've got to do it.

186
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,000
Come on, let's go.

187
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,700
You don't understand.

188
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,700
I had a buddy who dragged me
to my first committees

189
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,100
and I wanna do
the same thing for you.

190
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,900
I'm not going.
I'm absolutely not going.

191
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,100
It's a misunderstanding.

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,200
We try to carry this message
to alcoholics

00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,800
and to practice these principles
in all our affairs.

192
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,800
I lost my job,

193
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,500
my marriage, my kids
and my self-respect.

194
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,700
The only thing I gained was weight.
About 45 pounds.

195
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,200
A bunch of us
are going out to eat afterwards.

196
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,100
Do you wanna join us?

197
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,800
She'd love to.

198
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,700
So, how long have you been sober?

199
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,300
It's hard to say.

200
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,100
Do you know what,
that's okay.

201
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,500
Even if it's a day or two.
It takes progress.

202
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,800
Listen to her,
the expert.

203
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,700
I'm the one who
should be giving you advice.

204
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,100
- Because?
- Because I've done this 5 times.

205
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,500
Oh, that's great.

206
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,900
Hank, you're discouraging her.

207
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,000
It doesn't take 5 times.

208
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,400
- Isn't that right, dad?
- It's right.

209
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,800
- Dad?
- Yeah.

210
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,900
These meetings are quality time,
together.

211
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,800
My advice is:
take things at your own pace

212
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,000
and don't let anybody
pressure you.

213
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,400
You missed one.

214
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,599
-- time Kit was snorting
I came down pretty hard on him.

215
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:18,200
Those were bad times.

216
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,099
He looked at me like I was evil.

217
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:24,099
Sarah, I've no right to criticize him
after what I've put him through.

218
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:25,300
He was right.

219
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,700
Eventually I got through to him,
he got through to me

220
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,100
and we helped each other out.

221
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,100
We've been cleaning out
for two years.

222
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,800
And what about his mother?

223
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,800
She hasn't been in the picture
since he was 2.

224
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,200
- Thanks for walking me home.
- My pleasure.

225
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,100
Do you want me to come
and get you tomorrow?

226
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,200
That would be nice.

227
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,500
Okay, then.

228
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,500
Bye.

229
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,600
Put your head on my shoulder

230
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,300
lean a little longer

231
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,500
Put your head on my shoulder

232
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,200
and breathe.

233
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,700
…to realize that my kid
is embarrassed of me.

234
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,400
Last week I was talking
to my ex-wife.

235
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,100
She told me about
a school play that he was in.

236
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,200
He looked to me and said:
"Dad, don't come"

237
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,200
"You'd have to take time off work
and it'd be too much trouble".

238
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,000
He was pretending to be thinking
about me but I could tell.

239
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,700
I could see it in his eyes.

240
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,600
He didn't want me there.

241
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,500
He knew that he'd be embarrassed
by his old man. Again.

242
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,560
Anyway, I guess all I can do

243
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,300
is keep following steps right
and keep trying.

244
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,700
And that's it.

245
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,700
- Why don't you go out?
- No.

246
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,200
Anyone else?

247
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,360
Charlie,

248
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,500
would you and Kit like to come
to my place for dinner tomorrow?

249
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,700
We'd love to.

250
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,900
So, what you have in mind?

251
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,000
Remember what you said
about my hair?

252
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,400
I sure do.

253
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,700
Would you mind if I --

254
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,500
It won't hurt, I promise.

255
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,400
You shine in my eyes

256
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,800
Frozen still, open wide

257
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,600
Come down, fill my heart

258
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,600
With a fire you flaunt

259
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,500
And I can't say a word

260
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,200
They would only sound absurd

261
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,400
Maybe you're my shooting star

262
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,100
Blindly falling through the dark

263
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,700
Burning a hole in my sky

264
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,600
so fierce, so bright

265
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,200
Maybe it's all I need,

266
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,900
so baby come shoot through me

267
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:42,900
Wishes won't survive on you tonight

268
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,000
If you stay for good

269
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,900
On the ground, I think you could

270
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,600
It's not a life that you lead

271
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,300
Just a path following

272
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,300
cause everybody else

273
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,200
has you aiming at yourself

274
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,300
- So?
- Thank you.

275
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
- You look great.
- Thank you.

276
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,800
- Where is Kit?
- He couldn't make it.

277
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,600
- Go ahead.
- All right.

278
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,200
This is truly heaven.

279
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,900
I can't remember the last time
I had a civilized meal.

280
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What do you mean?

281
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,900
I mean I don't eat like this often.

282
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,300
Candles and cloth-napkins...

283
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,800
For example, there was a time

284
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,500
when I used to make
a pretty good jelly from scratch.

285
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,700
It was an all-day affair
but then, after a while I thought:

286
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,800
"this is too much trouble,
I just gonna get can jelly"

287
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,100
And shortly after that I thought:
"heating it up is so much work".

288
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,060
And then I reasoned:
"if I'm not gonna heat it up

289
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,700
why not just eat the jelly
out of the can?"

290
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,100
You wouldn't eat cold jelly
out of the can.

291
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,100
I would and I do,
regularly.

292
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,700
And I think,
I'm pretty sure

293
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,200
if I could figure a way
to eat that jelly

294
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,300
without opening the can
I would do that too.

295
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,800
I think you'd better go now.

296
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,200
Why?
What's the matter?

297
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,000
Nothing is the matter.
It's just late.

298
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,400
Sure.

299
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,500
- It's me.
- Hi.

300
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,400
I couldn't bear
to have my normal breakfast this morning

301
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,200
It would have been an insult
to my taste buds after last night.

302
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,200
- What's your normal breakfast?
- Don't ask.

303
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,200
So how are you doing?

304
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,200
I'm fine. Why?

305
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,700
No, I mean with the "eternal struggle".

306
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,300
You mean the drinking?

307
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,600
I'm okay.

308
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,100
Because you really haven't indicated
where you're at.

309
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,900
I'm sort of about the beginning.

310
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,400
What about you?

311
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,000
Three-year anniversary --

312
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,200
My previous record
is two.

313
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,400
You know, it's funny because before
all I could think about was drinking

314
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,200
and now all I can think about
is not drinking.

315
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,700
So let me see
if I got this straight.

316
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,300
You prefer not to talk
about your past relationships,

317
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,100
you prefer not to talk
about your family

318
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,700
and you prefer not to talk
about where you are in the steps.

319
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,400
- I'm a brilliant conversationalist.
- You're a challenge.

320
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
- How about football?
- No.

321
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,100
Baseball?

322
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,000
I don't --

323
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,700
- Movies?
- I used to go. All the time.

324
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,100
That's something.

325
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,400
I like ping-pong.

326
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,400
I won a little tournament once.

327
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,200
So you're a ping-pong champion,
aren't you?

328
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,000
I -- in about 25 years
But now I've someone to work with.

329
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,100
I love that --.

330
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,300
Wouldn't you love
to fall into that every night?

331
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,600
Aren't you and I planning
on doing that some time?

332
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,500
So movies, ping-pong
and big, fancy beds with fluffy pillows.

333
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,000
I think we're making progress.

334
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,500
Sorry.

335
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,100
- That was fun.
- It was.

336
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,700
Listen, I hope that you didn't get
the wrong impression.

337
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,200
I think I've got the right impression.

338
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,500
Which is?

339
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,900
That you're -- in my hands.
But don't worry,

340
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,700
I assure I intend to exercise my
power over you with extreme responsibility.

341
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,800
Good-bye, Charlie.

342
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,900
I'll see you at the next meeting.

343
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
I finally realized that
drugs --

344
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,100
ruining my future,
turning off my old friends.

345
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,500
And quite frankly,
I've become really disgusted with myself.

346
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,900
I've become so self-centered.

347
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,700
I don't want to be like that anymore.

348
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,600
I want to be more like you, guys.

349
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,700
I wanted to help people.

350
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,200
So, that's what I did.

351
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,100
Thank you for helping me
get better.

352
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,300
One other thing:
my band is  --

353
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,100
Just kidding.

354
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,900
The music is free.

355
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,900
Anyone else?

356
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,200
You don't sew, do you?

357
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,500
You have missing a button.

358
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,200
I'm sure I have many buttons missing.

359
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,500
Do you work
or are just -- wealthy?

360
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,700
I work.
I just have a lot of time off.

361
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,600
What do you do?

362
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,600
I'd rather not say.

363
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,300
What, I can't have my privacy?

364
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,000
You are like a hit-man or something?

365
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
I edit books.

366
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,200
I've taught English
at a girls private Highschool for 12 years.

367
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,400
Then a friend of mine in publishing
asked if I'd be interested in editing manuscripts.

368
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,700
It sounded interesting.

369
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,400
I do it from home.

370
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,200
It suits me.

371
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,700
Any good books coming out?

372
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,400
I never read the books anyway.

373
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,300
Why not?

374
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,800
Well, I start with
the last sentence on the last page

375
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,160
and then I work backwards.

376
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,100
That way I can just focus
on the punctuation

377
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,100
and the spelling, the grammar,
not get distracted by the story.

378
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,000
- What?
- Nothing.

379
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
Hi, everyone.
We're gonna start -- now.

380
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,300
I hope you enjoy it.

381
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,800
No, I've never been married.

382
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
What?

383
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,400
You asked me before
if I'd ever been married

384
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,500
and I was very rude
not to have answered you.

385
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,500
of just being kind to me
after my friend Amy died.

386
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,000
No, it was stupid of me.

387
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,800
No, I was being stupid.

388
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,900
Sorry.

389
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,900
On the house.

390
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Thank you.

391
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,300
I'm not exactly
the tie housekeeper.

392
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,600
No. Indeed.

393
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Kit says it's like a work of art.
Expresses my eccentricities.

394
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,700
It certainly expresses something.

395
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,900
picture frames could
serve to a purpose.

396
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,200
I always thought they were
just for displaying art.

397
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,200
--

398
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,600
No, never.

399
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,000
--

400
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,500
why burden county's land fields
when I can just go ahead and get my own.

401
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,500
Very thoughtful.

402
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,699
Have a seat.
Anywhere.

403
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,100
Make yourself at home.
I'll go get you something to eat.

404
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,400
Just kidding.
Come on.

405
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,400
Voilà.

406
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,700
Good? Yes?
Salt? Pepper?

407
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,900
No. Perfect.

408
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,800
Charlie.

409
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,100
Where is he?

410
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,000
- How is he?
- Not good.

411
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,400
He's really drunk.

412
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,800
Threatened me to kill himself.

413
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,200
I've tried every --
to get through and nothing worked.

414
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,400
- Okay, just wait here.
- No, I'll go with you.

415
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,200
Stop right there.

416
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,100
Don't try to make me change my mind, Charlie.

417
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,500
Okay.
Just take it easy.

418
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,400
Why? I have nothing to live for.

419
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,200
You've got your son.

420
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,300
He don't need me.

421
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,200
He don't even want me.

422
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,100
better off without me
and you know it.

423
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,900
Hank, you love your son, don't you?

424
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,200
And how do you think he's gonna feel
when he has to explain to people

425
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,700
that his father took a gun
and blew his brains out?

426
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,400
Thank you for today.

427
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,600
We need to talk.

428
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,400
This is really embarrassing.

429
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,800
You know how hard it is
for me to open up.

430
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,900
- I'm strange.
- You are.

431
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,800
I don't mean about opening up.
I'm not strange in that way.

432
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,100
What are you trying to say?

433
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,800
I'm trying to say that I'm not going
to have sex outside the marriage.

434
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,600
I came to this conclusion
because

435
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,100
I've been through
a lot of heartache and pain in the past

436
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,800
and I can't go through that again.

437
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,000
I can't.

438
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,000
I promised myself I wouldn't.

439
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,200
I swore that the next time
I had sex with someone
we would be married.

440
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,000
You're kidding, right?

441
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,100
Okay.

442
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:01,000
Marriage would just be a --
for what is going on here.

443
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,500
You know that, right?

444
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:07,300
And your problem is that you are deeply
afraid about opening up to someone.

445
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,400
I don't really need you
to psychoanalyze me.

446
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,900
You have to get over this.

447
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,500
I don't wanna get over this.

448
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,800
I'm completely pathless.

449
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,000
I wouldn't blame you
if you didn't wanna see me again.

450
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,600
This is a big problem,
I know that.

451
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,100
Isn't it?

452
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,100
What do you think?

453
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,800
We're gonna have to get married.

454
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,100
It's not funny.

455
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,000
Let's just call tonight.

456
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,500
Hello.

457
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,700
Listen, I think we better
cool it for a while.

458
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,500
Because I don't wanna pressure you

459
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,400
into doing anything
you're uncomfortable with.

460
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,700
Okay.

461
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,600
See you.

462
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,800
Charlie.

463
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,200
These are for you.

464
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,600
Thank you.

465
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,900
Listen, I've been thinking.

466
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,300
It's not such a bad idea.

467
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,700
What?

468
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,400
You and me getting married.

469
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,100
Please, don't make fun of me.

470
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,700
I'm not. Look.

471
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,900
We go to Babys,
we get

472
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,600
and when you think
we -- its course we get a quick divorce.

473
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,200
A what?

474
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,600
Sarah, it's obvious
that you desperately need it.

475
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,400
You just have that mental blocks.

476
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,000
We need to find a way around that.

477
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,000
I've got nothing,
you've got nothing,

478
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,600
There's no need for a prenup.

479
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,900
Seriously, sooner or later
and I really hope it's sooner

480
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,700
I'm gonna have my way with you.

481
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,300
Can you think of a better solution?

482
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,800
That was the worse proposal
I've ever heard in my life.

483
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
I'm sorry you're so upset.

484
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,600
I'm not clear
on one thing though.

485
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,900
What exactly
are you so upset about?

486
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,800
You don't know
what I'm so upset about?

487
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,800
You can't figure it out?

488
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,700
Do you think it's been my life's dream
to be married by an Elvis impersonator

489
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,900
in some wedding chapel
filled with slot machines?

490
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,300
Or to plan my divorce
before the marriage has even begun?

491
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,400
Is that my life's dream?

492
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,800
Let alone getting married
to someone without feeling that --

493
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,560
You know what?
I have a good life. I do.

494
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
I have my work

495
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,800
I have my piece of mind

496
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,600
and I have a manuscript to edit.

497
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,800
Good bye.

498
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,200
Sarah!

499
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,300
Sarah, it's me, Charlie.
Come on, open up.

500
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,800
I thought about what you said,
I feel like an ass. Come on!

501
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,700
If I cause Sarah to start drinking again
I'll never forgive myself.

502
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,900
Since when you care
about the women you --

503
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,400
Sarah!

504
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,700
I own all the units and rent them out
so yes, I do know Sarah.

505
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,200
This is Memorial Hospital.
We have Sarah Winston here

506
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,000
and I'm trying to locate
family members.

507
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,200
Please, call us
if you receive this message.

508
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,500
Sarah.

509
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,300
Hi, there.

510
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,600
I'm fine.

511
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,200
Well, maybe you are but I'm not.

512
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,700
Whatever are you doing here?

513
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,300
What do you mean
what I'm doing here?

514
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,400
I'm taking care of you.

515
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:51,000
I'd be really angry if I died before
I had the chance to ask you something.

516
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,100
What?

517
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,100
Why you don't eat the tomato?

518
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,800
It says in case of emergency
I should call her sister.

519
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,100
I guess I should do that.

520
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,000
- Dad,
- What?

521
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,800
What's happening to you?

522
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,100
I don't know.

523
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,400
That's very sweet.
Thank you.

524
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,500
You're welcome.

525
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,000
Hi, Tony.

526
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,400
-- those cartoons?

527
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,800
I go in about once every other month.

528
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,900
-- and I also do commercials for the -- products.

529
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,700
Why -- tell me about it?

530
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,700
Because when people find out
what I do for a living

531
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,800
it generally changes their opinion of me.

532
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,500
Which is?

533
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:39,700
They start looking at me as the edgy
kind-of-guy that I am

534
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,100
As a tomato, yes.

535
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,100
I'm glad you're here.

536
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,700
Heading in there right now.
Where is it again?

537
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,900
Back left corner, bedside table.

538
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,400
Hang on a second.

539
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,300
We got it.

540
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,500
Yeah, this is it.
I will bring it with me when I come.

541
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
We'll see then.

542
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,500
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing

543
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,900
Aren't you gonna call her on it?

544
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,600
Wouldn't do any good.

545
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,400
Dad, we should throw all that away.

546
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,900
She's gonna do that herself.
Come on.

547
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,100
- Are you Charlie?
- Yeah.

548
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,600
I'm Olivia, Sarah's sister.

549
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,800
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah, sure.

550
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,800
I'm really glad you came.
This is my son, Kit.

551
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,200
- I thought you said she was dying.
- I didn't say that.

552
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,400
- Well, you said it was urgent.
- It was. It is.

553
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,700
No, it's fine.
It's just superficial stuff.

554
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,000
She should be out of here
in a day or two at max.

555
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,400
I wouldn't call a concussion
and internal bleeding superficial.

556
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,500
- How long you know my sister?
- --

557
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:10,400
- And what's your relationship?
- We're friends.

558
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:16,400
- Right. How did you meet?
- At an AA meeting.

559
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,400
What's my sister doing
at an AA meeting?

560
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,100
She's handling her problems.

561
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,900
My sister?

562
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,700
My sister does not have
a problem with alcohol.

563
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,600
Well, you're gonna have to talk
to your sister about that.

564
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,200
I hope you're not just another guy
trying to rip her off.

565
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,800
What do you mean?

566
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,100
I mean are you trying to
get your hands on her money?

567
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,800
I didn't even know she had any money.

568
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,400
-- you think about me
but your sister really needs you right now.

569
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,400
No, my sister does not need me
and I don't need her.

570
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,400
That¡s the beauty of our relationship.

571
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,400
And don't tell her I was here.

572
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,000
-- her recovery.

573
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,300
Wait!

574
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,700
- Can I talk to you for a moment?
- Now what for?

575
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,000
Cause I think you --

576
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,400
I came because I thought
she was about to take her last breath.

577
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,300
I have a feeling you're not the cold
heartless bitch you pretend to be.

578
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,600
Excuse me?

579
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,100
I thought I didn't need
my dad either.

580
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,400
I thought I could make it on my own.

581
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,100
But he means the world to me now.

582
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,900
We helped each other with our addictions.
We've grown really close.

583
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,600
Well, luckily my sister and I
don't have any addictions

584
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,900
so we don't really need
to grow close.

585
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,200
Wait a minute.

586
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,800
If I can help you to make peace
with your sister in any way

587
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,700
here is my card.

588
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,600
"Kit Peterson:
musician slash mechanic"

589
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,600
You're being quiet.

590
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,600
Am I?

591
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,400
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that.

592
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,700
What are you thinking about?

593
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,000
Us.

594
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,000
What's up?

595
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,000
Sister. She was a piece of work.

596
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,100
I didn't even know she had a sister
until yesterday.

597
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,300
I don't really know
nothing about her.

598
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,600
What a nice surprise!

599
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,400
- What's wrong?
- Can I talk to you?

600
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,400
Yeah. Come in.

601
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,800
Considering you might be
in a very vulnerable position right now

602
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,600
--

603
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,200
I just think...

604
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:48,500
Do you know how step 9
is to go round and make a -- talk

605
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,300
-- those we harmed in the past?

606
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,100
Well, I've come here today.

607
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,900
This visit is about that.

608
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,400
But you've never harmed me before.

609
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,800
I see.

610
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,600
So you plan on harming me
in the future

611
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,600
so you've thought
you apologize now.

612
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,600
I didn't warn you now
I'll feel bad later.

613
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,000
It's about my dad.

614
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,800
My dad is a great guy,
the best guy in the world.

615
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,900
He was never ugly or violent
when he drunk

616
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,100
he never hit me or anything

617
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,500
He never even yelled at me.

618
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:29,200
He just disappeared.

619
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,500
Everything would be fine
and then he'd fall into this weird mood

620
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,600
I wake up one morning and find a note

621
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,100
"I love you but
I have to go away for a while"

622
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,500
"I'll come back as soon as I can"

623
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,500
And then he'd be gone for months.

624
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,700
Happened when I was a kid.

625
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,700
Every time it happened
I had to call my grandma to come get me.

626
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,300
He's on the same thing to
every woman he's ever been with.

627
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,500
I see.

628
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,300
I really think it's best
if you don't…

629
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,800
I mean, with the stage you¡re in.

630
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,300
Just don't depend on him.

631
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,100
Thank you for the advice, Kit.

632
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,500
I hope you feel better.

633
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,100
Welcome home.

634
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,300
Why haven't you tried
to kiss me today?

635
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,600
I wanted to be careful.

636
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,100
I don't want you to be careful.

637
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:36,200
Sarah, why haven't you really told me
anything about yourself?

638
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,200
What do you mean?

639
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,100
I mean

640
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:42,700
I have no idea hat happened to you
to make you the way you are.

641
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,000
I have no idea when you first realized
you had a problem with alcohol,

642
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,100
how you're handling it,
what you think about AA,

643
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,600
where you are in the steps,

644
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,600
how you feel about your family,
basic things.

645
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,500
I don't know everything about you either.

646
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:00,100
This is a big deal for me, Charlie.
I need to go slow.

647
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,900
In case you haven't noticed.

648
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,600
I just need time.
That's all.

649
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,600
You're a peculiar woman, Sarah.

650
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,500
I've come to terms with that,
so you take your time.

651
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,600
Just don't take too much time, okay?

652
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,400
Percy is hiding behind the tree.

653
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,300
We're coming to get you,
broccoli.

654
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,700
You'll never catch me.

655
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,800
I'm
about getting a ring.

656
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,800
What kind of a ring?

657
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,900
Have you lost your mind?

658
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,700
You saw the booze under her bed, right?

659
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,600
She's obviously not in a good place.

660
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,000
Wouldn't be good for you either.

661
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,700
I just got this idea
in my head.

662
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,000
how many times before
the big ideas you get in your head

663
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,400
are almost never
the right thing to do.

664
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,800
I'm in love with her, Kit.

665
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,300
Be careful, dad.

666
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,700
--

667
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,400
I want to be sure if she was being
completely honest with me.

668
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,100
Do you think it's a good idea
to have alcohol in the house?

669
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,200
What do you mean?

670
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,300
If you have a problem with alcohol,

671
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,700
Do you think it's a good idea
to have alcohol in the house?

672
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,500
No, I think it's a terrible idea.

673
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,200
So you wouldn't do that.

674
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,500
No.

675
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,700
Excuse me.
Can we have -- please?

676
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,100
Are you okay?

677
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,900
Would you mind if I didn't walk you
to your door tonight?

678
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,200
Who was that at the restaurant?

679
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,400
That was my father.

680
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,800
I'm dead to him

681
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,200
because I was a big disappointment to him.

682
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,400
Have you ever tried to talk to him?

683
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:55,400
Maybe if you went to him
and you were completely
open and honest

684
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,200
maybe you would have a change of heart.

685
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:09,800
What do you know
about being open and honest?

686
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,000
What about all those bottles
under your bed, Sarah?

687
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,100
You lied to me tonight.

688
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,100
You lied to my face.

689
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,400
--

690
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,800
I found it by accident
when I was looking for your address book.

691
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,900
I have an explanation.

692
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:30,400
I don't want to hear
any explanations.

693
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,700
I've been honest with you.

694
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,800
I've been honest with you
except on one thing.

695
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,800
Oh, please, Sarah.
Just go. Just get out.

696
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,900
Get out!

697
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,200
Just get out.

698
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,400
to accept things I cannot change

699
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,000
the courage to change the things I can

700
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,000
Is your dad home?

701
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:06,800
No. He wasn't here when I got back last night.

702
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,399
I'm worried about him

703
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:13,700
I'll drive.

704
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,300
It's not him.

705
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,200
Your dad took me to this
really beautiful place
on the shore once.

706
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,500
Maybe he might be there?

707
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,200
fishing

708
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,399
--

709
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,400
This is not good.

710
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,500
- Hi, dad.
- Hi.

711
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,800
Hey, Charlie.

712
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,500
So what are you doing here?

713
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:37,400
I think the question should be
what are you doing here.

714
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,900
I'm appreciating nature.

715
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,300
What about all of this.

716
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,600
That was a terrible waste of money
and glass.

717
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,100
I really should have recycled.

718
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:56,700
I poured it out.

719
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,500
Came close but coming close
doesn't count.

720
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,300
I really need to talk to you, Charlie.

721
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,600
You two talk.

722
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,400
Since no one is talk to me
just gonna wait in the truck.

723
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,700
You've right to have lost confidence in me
after what I did.

724
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:37,500
Why won't you trust me, Sarah?

725
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:08,000
I haven't had the best luck
with relationships.

726
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:17,300
My first love swept me off my feet
and then left me.

727
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:23,800
I was pregnant with his child
and I was devastated.

728
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,700
I lost the baby 5 months later.

729
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,400
After that it seems like
every man I ever trusted

730
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,700
found a new way to hurt me.

731
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:46,500
And after a while it started to feel
like I deserved all that pain.

732
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,200
That's why you drink?

733
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,300
That's what I wanted to explain.

734
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:07,400
I've been allowing myself
to tweed this web

735
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,400
and it just keeps getting worse.

736
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,600
What are you talking about?

737
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,800
I don't have a drinking problem.
I've never had.

738
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:20,900
You really got me there.
For a second I thought
you're finally opening up to me.

739
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,800
You don't understand.
I'm trying to tell you.

740
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,500
Stop, okay?
Just stop.

741
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:27,700
No, you don't understand.

742
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:30,100
I can't deal with
this crap right now.

743
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:31,800
I've had a very rough night.

744
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,200
--

745
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,600
Hello.

746
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,400
Olivia who?

747
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,600
Musician slash mechanic, right?

748
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,800
That's me.

749
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,200
I left my wallet at home --

750
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,700
Just died. I don't know.

751
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,600
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate this.

752
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,000
Do you know your sister
calls you

753
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,500
just to hear the sound of your voice
in the answering machine?

754
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,000
I've long
lost interest in what my sister does.

755
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,600
Just try and talk things out with her.

756
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,500
How can that happen?

757
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,500
I don't care about her anymore.

758
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,400
Hi, this is Sarah.

759
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:26,200
I just wanted to say that
I'm sorry.

760
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,900
I'm sorry for the way
that I treated you

761
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:35,900
and sorry for the way
I've behaved with you and Roy.

762
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,500
I just hope that you can
forgive me

763
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,500
because

764
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,000
I miss you.

765
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I miss you.

766
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,700
And I love you.

767
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:06,900
And I really need
my little sister right now.

768
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:13,700
So please call me.

769
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,500
I love you.

770
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,800
All right,

771
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,500
we probably have time
for a couple more to share.

772
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,000
Who would it be?

773
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,000
Charlie, alcoholic.

774
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,100
I had a rough night

775
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,200
but I made it.

776
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:56,500
I made it through the night,
I made it through this day

777
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,200
and here I am.

778
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,000
I was going through the big --
this afternoon

779
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,200
something suddenly
became very clear to me.

780
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,500
may not make any sense

781
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,200
what came clear to me
was that

782
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:28,700
we all have wounds
that will never heal.

783
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,400
But that's okay

784
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:36,300
as long as we help each other
to bind those wounds.

785
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:38,900
So you don't bleed to death.

786
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:43,700
But then it occurred to me
that maybe that's why

787
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,200
we're here on this Earth

788
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:51,400
help each other bind our wounds.

789
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:04,700
Anyone else?

790
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,100
Okay, then.
Meeting over.

791
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,100
Could I say something?

792
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,400
That's great.
I think it's her first time.

793
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:39,400
My name is Sarah
and I'm not an alcoholic.

794
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,800
And I'm not in denial.

795
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:52,100
I want to extend my apology
to all of you.

796
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,800
I've been dishonest with you.

797
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,600
I've betrayed your sympathy
and your trust,

798
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,100
I've betrayed your friendship

799
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,700
and for that I'm very sorry.

800
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:06,800
I didn't start out
intending to deceive you.

801
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,300
It's just that

802
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:15,300
I used to watch you
all gathered out in front

803
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,600
and I just wished that I could be
a part of your group.

804
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,600
And then one night

805
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,100
I saw Charlie.

806
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,400
And I couldn't take my eyes off of him.

807
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,100
I loved the way he moved,

808
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,900
I loved the way he smiled.

809
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:44,000
I came to that first meeting
just to meet him.

810
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:49,000
I was following my heart
for the first time in a very long time.

811
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,600
And then one thing
led to another

812
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:55,300
and before I knew it
I was pretending to be an alcoholic.

813
01:19:55,340 --> 01:20:00,700
But I have to say
that being here has helped me

814
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:02,400
because the truth is

815
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:07,800
I am a mess of a human being.

816
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:13,400
I may not be an alcoholic
but I have problems to overcome.

817
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,700
Huge, scary problems.

818
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:22,100
And I've learned so much
from all of you.

819
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,700
I know it's a lot to ask

820
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:29,300
but if you would allow it

821
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,900
I would like to keep coming back.

822
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,700
This is a meeting for people
with serious problems.

823
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:46,500
Rules are

824
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,900
everyone is welcome to our open meetings.

825
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:52,800
She can keep coming back
as many times as she likes.

826
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,700
As often as you want.

827
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,600
Thank you.

828
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,400
Okay. Meeting closed.

829
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,900
You have to keep coming

830
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:16,500
'cause this wouldn't be the same
without you.

831
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,200
I'm so disappointed
you're not a real alcoholic.

832
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:34,100
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change

833
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:36,900
the courage to change
the things I can

834
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:39,700
and wisdom to know the difference.

835
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:41,700
Keep coming back!

836
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,100
What do we do now?

837
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:09,400
I know exactly
what we do.

838
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,600
We start on page 1.

839
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:19,600
And we don't worry about punctuation
or grammar or spell words

840
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,600
or whether or not
the margins are even,

841
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,800
we just get lost in our story

842
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,800
and we see where it takes us.

843
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,600
I love the sound of that.

844
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:44,200
Lola,

845
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,100
can I talk to you for a second?

846
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:52,800
I just wanted you to know.

847
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,100
I probably should
have said this before but

848
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,300
I think you're very smart.

849
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,100
Exceptionally smart.

850
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,500
Do you think
I could get into college?

851
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,200
If you commit yourself
and you work really hard

852
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,300
I think you could get
into an excellent college.

853
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:19,000
And if you let me
I'd really love to help you
achieve that goal.

854
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,300
You won't yell at me?

855
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,000
I promise.

856
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,600
This is him?
This is the killer?

857
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,200
Shakespeare, come.

858
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,100
Here's the door.

859
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,400
I think --
message this morning.

860
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,900
Let me begin by saying that

861
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:37,800
Elvis is honored
to be officiating this ceremony today.

862
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,300
We are gathered here to celebrate
the marriage of Charles Manning

863
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:43,800
and Sarah Winston.

864
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:53,800
Charlie,
you take this woman to be your wife?

865
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,100
Before we all stuffing our faces
I'd like to make a toast.

866
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,700
During the ceremony
I asked myself

867
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:12,500
if these two
really did belong together

868
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,200
So I sized them up.

869
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:21,000
Sarah is tall, intelligent, good-looking,
refined, cultured and dignified

870
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,000
and Charlie is

871
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,300
not.

872
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,600
But obviously offsets attract.

873
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,500
So I say "yes".
Yes, they do.

874
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,800
I'd like to make a toast as well.

875
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,200
Your wedding
couldn't make me happier.

876
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:48,300
I've been looking for an excuse
to move out of my dad's place for years now.

877
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:53,100
I'd also like to make a toast.

878
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,000
To my sister who is starting
a new life

879
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,600
with a new husband,
a new future

880
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,300
and a new group of friends.

881
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,600
Cheers.

883
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,400
I have one more surprise for you.

884
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:55,500
Close your eyes.

885
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,000
Turn left.

886
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,300
This way.

887
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,200
Open your eyes.

888
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,300
Do you like it?

889
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,900
I love you, Sarah.

891
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,700
I gave up drinking,

892
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:59,900
I gave up smoking.

893
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:03,100
I gave up thinking all the time

894
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:06,200
stone cold revoking.

895
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,200
The reason to my rhyme,

896
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,200
I wasn't joking.

897
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:15,200
If there's a phoney bone in me,

898
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:18,300
I want it broken.

899
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:21,500
If you don't know what to say

900
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:24,200
or where to begin,

901
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,800
turn your high light on,

902
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:30,300
turn it up, tune me out

903
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:32,200
and rub it in

904
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,600
Rub it in

905
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,500
Rub it in

906
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,500
Rub it in
