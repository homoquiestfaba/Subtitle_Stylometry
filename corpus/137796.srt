1
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:28,293
Oh, hello.

2
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,230
You're, uh, you're probably here

3
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:32,349
About the, Uh, the story.

4
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:34,399
Elves love to tell stories.

5
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,237
I- I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.

6
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:39,556
There's, uh, probably a lot of things

7
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:41,806
You... you didn't know about elves.

8
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:46,511
Another... another interesting
Uh, elf ism

9
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:51,951
Uh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.

10
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:53,603
The first is making shoes at night

11
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:55,221
While, you know, while the old...

12
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:56,855
The old cobbler sleeps.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,926
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.

14
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:01,561
You can bake cookies

15
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:02,360
In a tree. Hey!

16
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,498
As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
Having an oven

17
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,967
In an oak tree during the dry season.

18
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:09,701
I wanna make shoes!

19
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,272
But the third job... uh, some call
It, uh,

20
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:14,506
"The show," or... or "the big dance,"

21
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,661
It's the professión that every elf
Aspires to,

22
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:22,782
And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.

23
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:25,012
Only two weeks left till Christmas!

24
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,521
I- It's a job only an elf can do.

25
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:29,940
Our... our nimble fingers,

26
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,717
Natural cheer and active minds

27
00:01:31,752 --> 00:01:33,425
Are perfect for toy-building.

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,429
They... they tried using gnomes
And trolls,

29
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:39,296
But the gnomes drank too much...

30
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,632
...and the trolls weren't toilet
trained.

31
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:49,275
No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.

32
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,078
Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,

33
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:55,064
And, as you may have guessed,

34
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:58,016
That's where our story begins.

35
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,583
Wow!

36
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,912
Whoa!

37
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,960
Ooh!

38
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,557
Wow!

39
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,120
Wow!

40
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,203
Ow! Ow!

41
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,587
Whoa!

42
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,687
Are you sleepy?

43
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,461
Here we are.

44
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:55,068
We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.

45
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:57,137
Here we are.

46
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:59,137
There you are.

47
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,373
It's time to go to sleep.

48
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,935
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.

49
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,211
Merry Christmas, my ángel.

50
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,615
Mmm...

51
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,991
All right, all right.

52
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,530
We've had another very successful
year.

53
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,917
So, after all that hard work,

54
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,503
It's time to start preparations

55
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,138
For next Christmas!

56
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:52,678
What in the name of Sam hill
Is that?

57
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,521
Wow...

58
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,556
A baby...

59
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,531
"little buddy diapers."

60
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,666
His name is buddy. He must've...

61
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,070
Snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.

62
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:11,536
What do we do?

63
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,706
So, Santa had a
Decisión to make,

64
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,843
And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,

65
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,142
Santa's a... a pushover.

66
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,380
So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elf

67
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,312
Who had always wanted a child?

68
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,883
But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...

69
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,721
He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.

70
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:29,320
Santa.

71
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,592
Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.

72
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:34,826
I was his adopted father.

73
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,561
Though buddy grew twice as fast,

74
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:40,800
He... he wasn't any different from
the other children.

75
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,470
Chuckles not too fast, buddy.

76
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:46,070
I mean, not... not really.

77
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,990
Before we learn how to build
The latest

78
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:50,318
In extreme graphic chipset
Processors,

79
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:52,612
Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"

80
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:53,480
Shall we?

81
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:54,278
Number one.

82
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,283
"Treat every day like Christmas."

83
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:58,049
Number two.

84
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:02,088
"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."

85
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,187
Number three.

86
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,592
"The best way to spread Christmas
Cheer

87
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:10,426
Is singing loud for all to hear."

88
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,299
And one day, when buddy was
old enough,

89
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:15,502
I made him my own personal
apprentice.

90
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:17,588
I've never been in this room
before.

91
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,639
Well, I think it's time you start

92
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:21,607
Your tinker training.

93
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,643
Santa's sleigh.

94
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,306
You're gonna help me make it fly.

95
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,418
I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.

96
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:35,221
And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?

97
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:39,725
Christmas spirit. Everybody
knows that.

98
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,811
Well, silly as it sounds,

99
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:43,822
A lot of people down south

100
00:07:43,857 --> 00:07:45,798
Don't believe in Santa Claus.

101
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,598
What?!

102
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,837
Well, who do they think puts all?
their toys under the tree?

103
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:52,773
Well, there's a rumor floating around

104
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:54,674
That, uh, that the parents do it.

105
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,607
That's... that's ridiculous.

106
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,645
I mean, parents couldn't do that
all in one night.

107
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,745
What about Santa's cookies?

108
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,216
I suppose parents eat them, too?

109
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:04,282
Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,

110
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,786
Uh, and every earless and less
People

111
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:07,452
Believe in Santa Claus.

112
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,923
I mean, we have a real energy
crisis on our hands.

113
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:11,389
Oh.

114
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:15,361
I mean, just see how low the, uh
Claus meter is.

115
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:17,163
That's shocking.

116
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:18,896
That's why I came up

117
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,334
With this little beauty in the '60s.

118
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,171
WH-what is it?

119
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,673
It's a cringle 3000...

120
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,378
A 500-reindeer power jet turbine
engine.

121
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:33,878
Without it, the sleigh couldn't

122
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:37,849
Get more than, uh, a few feet off
the ground.

123
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,270
Well, it looks like we got

124
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:43,314
A short in the thermo coupler.

125
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,324
You wanna give mea hand with that?

126
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,791
You want me to help?

127
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,195
As much as, uh, buddy was accepted

128
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,364
By his family and friends,

129
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,464
There were a few drawbacks

130
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:57,270
To being, uh, a human in, uh
an elf's worid.

131
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,459
Hey, Ming Ming.

132
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:21,425
Um...

133
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,831
I'm gonna be a little bit short
on today's quota.

134
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:26,864
It's all right, buddy.

135
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,434
Just how many etch-a-sketches

136
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:31,705
Did you get finished?

137
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,941
Come on, buddy. How many?

138
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:39,241
I made, uh... 85.

139
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,809
Eighty-five?

140
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,351
That puts you...

141
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,289
915 off the pace.

142
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,857
Ooh... that's bad.

143
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,258
Why don't you just say it?

144
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,812
I'm the worst toy maker in
the worid.

145
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,332
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

146
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,768
No, buddy, you're not cotton-
headed ninny-muggins.

147
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,871
We all just have different talents
That's all.

148
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:06,771
Seems like everyone else

149
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,239
Have the same talents
except for me.

150
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,077
You... you have, you have lots of
Talents, uh...

151
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:14,614
Special talents in fact, like
Um, uh...

152
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:15,379
Special talents?

153
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,117
You changed the batteries in the
smoke detector.

154
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:18,883
You sure did... aaa's.

155
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,121
And in six months, you'll have
to check 'em again...

156
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:22,853
Won't he?

157
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,591
And you're the only baritone in
the elf choir.

158
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,827
You bring us down whole octave.

159
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:29,162
In a good way.

160
00:10:29,197 --> 00:10:30,428
See, buddy?

161
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,632
You're not a cotton-headed ninny-
muggings.

162
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:36,466
You're just... special.

163
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:42,441
And so, buddy was sent where the...
The special elves work.

164
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,602
Aah!

165
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,491
Ah!

166
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:20,411
Hey, foom foom...

167
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,731
I hate to do this to you, but you
Think you could

168
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,017
Help me pick up the slack on those
etch-a-sketches?

169
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,153
No problem. I appreciate it.

170
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:27,818
Buddy is killing me.

171
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,457
I already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.

172
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,009
That was quick thinking yesterday

173
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:34,452
With that ¡°special talents¡± thing.

174
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:35,775
Ming Ming: I feel bad for the guy.

175
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,028
I just hope he doesn't get wise.

176
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,666
Well, if he hasn't figured out
He's a human by now,

177
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,032
I don't think he ever will.

178
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,353
If he hasn't figured
Out he's a human

179
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:52,034
By now, I don't think he ever will.

180
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,946
I think they're too small.

181
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,883
You're just... special.

182
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,674
You don't look so good, buddy.

183
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:22,173
Are you okay?

184
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,711
I'll be okay, I just need a glass
of water.

185
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,906
Aah!

186
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,938
Buddy...

187
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,212
Unh! Aah!

188
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,472
Buddy, are you okay?

189
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,473
I'm sorry, papa.

190
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,908
I just need some alone time.

191
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,513
Buddy, I... I think we... we have
to talk.

192
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:03,667
Buddy, uh, I think there's something

193
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:06,751
I... I probably should tell you.

194
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,256
You probably should have found
out a long...

195
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,422
A long time ago.

196
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,493
I then proceeded to tell buddy of
how his father

197
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,430
Had fallen in love when he was
very young

198
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:20,332
With a beautiful girl named
Susan wells,

199
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,465
And how buddy was born

200
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,003
And put up for adoption by
his mother,

201
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:26,972
And how she had later passed away.

202
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:27,972
I... I told him his father

203
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,509
Had never even known that
Buddy was born,

204
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:31,275
And most importantly,

205
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,210
I told him where his father was...

206
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,316
Uh, in a magical land called
new York City.

207
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:39,683
My dad works there?

208
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,015
Empire state building.

209
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,627
Hey, buddy, wanna pick some
snow berries?

210
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,494
Not now, arctic puffin.

211
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,233
Hello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.

212
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,154
Why the long face, partner?

213
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:00,448
It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.

214
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:03,097
'Course you're not. You're 6'3"

215
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:05,711
And had a beard since you were 15.

216
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:06,811
Papa says my real father

217
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,015
Lives in a magical place far away.

218
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,083
I don't know what to do.

219
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,082
At least you have a daddy.

220
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:16,322
I was just rolled up one day and
left out here in the cold.

221
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:19,024
But the thing is, I've never even left
the North Pole.

222
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,410
Buddy, I've been around the worid
Many times

223
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,727
When I was a young cumulus
nimbus cloud.

224
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,633
It's a wonderful place, filled with
Wondrous creatures...

225
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:28,132
Except dogs.

226
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,036
Oh, by the way, don't eat the
yellow snow.

227
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:31,635
Oh, I know that.

228
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,741
All I'm say in' is, this might be
The golden opportunity

229
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:38,539
To find out whom you really are.

230
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,681
So, I hear you're going

231
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,652
On a little journey to
the big city.

232
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:47,818
Yup. Ahh.

233
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,088
I'm kind a nervous.

234
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,690
Leon says New York is pretty
different.

235
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:52,723
Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.

236
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:56,729
He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.

237
00:14:56,764 --> 00:14:59,365
I've been to New York thousands
of times.

238
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,383
Really? Mm-hmm.

239
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:01,332
What's it like?

240
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,203
Well, there are some things you
should know.

241
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,806
First off, you see gum on
The street,

242
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:09,375
Leave it there. It's not
free candy.

243
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,574
Oh. Second,

244
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,161
There are, like, 30 ray's
pizzas.

245
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:15,714
They all claim to be the
Original,

246
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,348
But the real one' son 11th.

247
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,985
And if you see a sign that
Says "peep show,"

248
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,588
That doesn't mean that
They're letting you

249
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,858
Look at presents before Christmas.

250
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:26,657
Can't wait to see my dad...

251
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:30,162
We're gonna go ices skating and...
And eat sugar plums.

252
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,482
Yeah, that's the other thing

253
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:35,577
I wanted to talk to you about.

254
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:38,192
You know, buddy...

255
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,738
Your father...

256
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,176
Well... he's on the naughty list.

257
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:47,668
No!

258
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,785
You're taking the books back?

259
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,121
See, I... I see what you're trying
to do here.

260
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,974
Y- You're trying to make me feel bad,

261
00:15:58,009 --> 00:15:59,792
When, in actuality, you're the one

262
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:00,824
That missed the payments.

263
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:04,797
But the children love the books.

264
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:05,629
I know that, uh...

265
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,933
You know, I'm the one that ran
The focus groups,

266
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,400
But I like hearing that.

267
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,805
Listen, some people, they just
Lose sight

268
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,605
Of what's important in life.

269
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,446
That doesn't mean they can't find
their way again, huh?

270
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:21,278
Maybe all they need

271
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,949
Is just a little Christmas spirit.

272
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,455
Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.

273
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,946
I know you are.

274
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,669
And I'll...

275
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:46,403
I'll always, uh,

276
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:49,464
I'll always be here for you.

277
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,345
Now, uh...

278
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,776
Go... uh, get.

279
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,463
Bye, guys.

280
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,768
Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy. Take care.

281
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:17,759
Bye-bye.

282
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,005
Bye-bye.

283
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,274
Bye-bye, buddy.

284
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,968
There, there.

285
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,146
Huh?

286
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:32,046
Oh! Ohh!

287
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,956
Bye, buddy. Hope you find your dad.

288
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,947
Thanks, Mr. Narwhal.

289
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,226
Bye.

290
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,314
Hey! What's your name?

291
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:38,044
My name's buddy.

292
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,583
Ohh!

293
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,092
Does someone need a hug?

294
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,832
aah, aah! That's not cool!

295
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,026
I just wanted a hug!

296
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,575
Hi.

297
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,141
Hello.

298
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,482
Thank you.

299
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:51,379
Thank you.

300
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,864
You did it! Congratulations!

301
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:05,871
"Worid's best cup of coffee.
"Great job, everybody.

302
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:08,607
It's great to meet you.

303
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,165
Hi.

304
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,189
Santa, san... uh, nope.

305
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,908
Not Santa.

306
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:27,530
Thank you.

307
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:29,117
Thank you.

308
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,477
Thank you. Hey, you know what?
No.

309
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:19,910
No, all right? Thank you.

310
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,470
Get outta here, get outta here.

311
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,429
Hello. Hi.

312
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:01,577
Ooh...

313
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:07,524
Beautiful.

314
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,296
Looks like a Christmas tree.

315
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,640
A reprint?

316
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,544
You know how much that's gonna
cost?

317
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:26,710
Two whole pages are missing.

318
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:27,978
The story doesn't make any sense.

319
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,265
What, you think some kid's gonna
notice two pages?

320
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,517
I mean, they... all they do is look
at pictures.

321
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,838
Sorry I can't ride with you the
Rest of the way up,

322
00:22:36,873 --> 00:22:39,524
But this is where my dad works.
Well, have a good...

323
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,757
Oh, I forgot to give you a hug!

324
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,728
Oh, I don't know, Connie,
I've never

325
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:44,196
Declared kittens before.

326
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:45,162
How many?

327
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,697
Eight?

328
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,632
Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
Have time.

329
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,119
Oh, all right, just bring 'em by
The camper this week,

330
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:53,572
And I'll see what I can do. I'm
Not gonna charge you.

331
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:56,074
Just bring 'em by, and I'll see
What I can do.

332
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,808
I have to go. Excuse me.

333
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:01,213
I'm here to see a Walter hobs.

334
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:02,679
I'm buddy the elf. Laughs

335
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,284
You look hilarious! Who sent you?

336
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,251
Papa elf. Papa elf?

337
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,004
Mm-hmm. From the North Pole.

338
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,688
From the North Pole? Yes.

339
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,442
So, you really think we should
Ship 'em?

340
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,804
No, I think we should take a
$30,000 bath

341
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:19,131
So some kid can understand
What happened?

342
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,799
To a puppy and a frigging pigeon

343
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,718
ship 'em.

344
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:24,568
Yeah.

345
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,339
Mr. Hobbs? It's me on the intercom.

346
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:27,738
Go ahead.

347
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:31,368
Yeah, I think some one sent you a
Christmas-gram.

348
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,078
Dad!

349
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,968
All right, uh, let's get it
Over with.

350
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,753
I walked all day and night to
Find you.

351
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,724
Uh, you look like you came from
the North Pole.

352
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,393
That's exactly where I came from.

353
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,079
Santa must've called you!

354
00:23:50,114 --> 00:23:51,695
Oh, yeah, sure, he, uh...

355
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,632
Just got off the cell phone
with me.

356
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:54,898
You did?!

357
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,367
So, go on. Go on with what?

358
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,638
Well, are... are you gonna sing a
Song or something,

359
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:01,406
Or can I just go back to work?

360
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,274
A song? Uh...

00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:09,714
Yeah. Anything for you, dad, uh...

362
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:15,120
I... I'm, I'm here with my dad

363
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:15,886
And we never met

364
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:19,758
And he wants me to sing
Him a song

365
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,258
And, um, I was adopted

366
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,627
But you didn't know I was born

367
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:28,133
So, I'm here now, I found you,
Daddy

368

You know, usually you guys just
Uh, you know,

00:24:43,183 --> 00:24:43,914
It's me, your son.

374
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:47,185
Susan wells had me, and... And she
Didn't tell you,

375
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,688

00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,898
What's a Christmas-gram?

381
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,221
It's okay, Walter's my father.

"For that special someone."

398
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:53,978
Past!

Okay, I didn't know. Well
You should know!

00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:15,298
Are you mad at me? No.

408
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,935
Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.

409

Okay, fair enough.

411
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,871

00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,742
This is the North Pole.

414
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:26,361
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:27,938

Oh, my god!

430
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:57,509
Santa here?! I know him.

431
00:27:57,544 --> 00:27:58,341
I know him.

00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:01,811

00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:05,448

00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:06,583
Santa's coming to town.

438
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,653
Yes. Can you sign this for me?

439
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:11,389
Ohh! Hi.

440
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,177
Are you enjoying the view?

441
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,482
You are very good at decorating
that tree.

442
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:39,501
Why are you messing with me?

443
00:28:39,536 --> 00:28:41,486
Did krumpet put you up to this?

444
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:42,886
I'm not messing with you.

445
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,906
It's just nice to meet
Another human

446
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:47,434
Who shares my affinity for?
elf culture.

447
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:49,928
I'm just trying to get
through the holidays.

448
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:50,360
Get through?

449
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,932
Christmas is the greatest
Day in the whole wide worid!

450
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:55,451
Please stop talking to me.

451
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:56,900
Uh-oh. Sounds like someone

452
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,104
Needs to sing a Christmas
Carol.

453
00:28:59,139 --> 00:28:59,636
Go away.

454
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,439
The best way to
Spread Christmas cheer

455
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:03,108
Is singing loud for all to hear.

456
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:04,207
Thanks, but I don't sing.

457
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,711
Oh, it's easy, it's just like
Talking...

458
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:07,644
Except louder and longer

459
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,878
And you move your voice up
And down.

460
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,649
I can sing, but I just choose not
to sing.

461
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:13,835
Especially in front of other
people.

462
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,952
Well, if you sing alone,
You can sing

463
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,622
In front of other people. There's
no difference.

464
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:20,191
Actually, there's a big difference.

465
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,127
No, there... no, there isn't.

466
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:23,617
Wait.

467
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,395
I'm singing

468
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,783
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

469
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:32,102
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

470
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:35,573
Hey! There's no singing in the
North Pole.

471
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:36,908
Yes, there is.

472
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,174
No, there's not.

473
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,612
We sing all the time.
No, there's not.

474
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:43,248
Especially when we make toys.

475
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:43,947
See?

476
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,284
Attention,
all gimbel's shoppers,

477
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,770
Please make your final purchases.

478
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:51,632
We'll be closing in ten minutes.

479
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:54,424
Well, it's time for me to go home.

480
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:58,129
But... but Santa's coming,
There's so much to do.

481
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:01,431
Yeah, um... laughs

482
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,002
I'll see you tomorrow...

483
00:30:04,037 --> 00:30:07,205
Buddy. Jovie.

484
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,298
Hi. Hi.

485
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,244
Jovie.

486
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,535
Hey, uh... I'm gonna eat in the
bedroom, okay?

487
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,634
I, uh, I got

488
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,336
A bunch of stuff to go over.

489
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,707
Are you sure? I'm... I'm just way
Behind

490
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:17,542
On a bunch of stuff.

491
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:18,873
Okay.

492
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,048
Can I eat in my room?

493
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,548
No. Why not?

494
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:26,616
Dad's eating in his room.

495
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,020
I got a bunch
Of homework to go over,

496
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:31,389
And I'm way behind on a bunch
of stuff.

497
00:31:31,424 --> 00:31:33,880
You're eating here.

498
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,628
I really can't stay

499
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:14,232
I've got to go 'way

500
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:17,802
This evening has been

501
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:21,271
So very nice

502
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:25,308
My mother will start to worry

503
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:29,914
And father will be pacing'
The floor

504
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:34,183
So, really, I'd better scurry

505
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:39,088
Well, may be just a half a drink
More

506
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:43,661
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there

507
00:32:43,696 --> 00:32:46,181
Say, what's in this drink?

508
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:48,631
No cabs to be had out there

509
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:53,903
I wish I knew how to break the
Spell

510
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:58,142
I'll take your hat, your hair
Looks swell

511
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:00,645
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

512
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,645
Mind if I move in closer?

513
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,066
At least I'm gonna say that
I tried

514
00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:07,452
What's the sense of hurting?
my pride?

515
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:10,286
I really can't stay

516
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:17,695
Ah, but it's cold outside baby,
it's cold outside!

517
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,204
Get out! Don't look at me!

518
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,671
Get out!

519
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:43,221
Just hear those sleigh bells
Jingling

520
00:33:43,256 --> 00:33:46,689
Ring-ting-tingling, too

521
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,992
Come on, it's lovely weather

522
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:53,031
For a sleigh ride together
With you

523
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:55,400
Outside the snow is falling

524
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:57,735
And friends are calling yoo-hoo

525
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,634

526
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,837

We're riding in a wonderland
Of snow

532
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:19,055
Hey! It's okay,

533
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,725
I just have a gift for my dad.

534
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,591
Okay, I'll take this.

535
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,227
Okay. Well, just make sure he knows

536
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:24,663
It's from me buddy, his son, okay?

Okay. And that I love him so much,

538
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,599
And that I think he's the greatest
dad in the worid.

539
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:29,866
You guys are so strong.

540
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,335
Wow! My cheeks are nice
And rosy

541
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,673
This is neat. And comfy
Cozy are we

542
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:38,841
We're snuggled up together

543
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,847
Like two birds of a feather
Would be

544
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:45,750
Let's take that road before us

545
00:34:45,785 --> 00:34:48,603
And sing a chorus or two

546
00:34:48,638 --> 00:34:51,387
Come on, it's lovely weather

547
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:56,359
For a sleigh ride together
With you

548
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,835
Hey, you. Me?

549
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,704
Come here. I wanna talk to you.

550
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,910
What do you wanna talk to?
Me about?

551
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:13,576
How come you were

552
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,180
In the women's locker room these
morning?

553
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:16,879
I heard you singing.

554
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,317
You sure it had nothing to
Do with the fact

555
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:20,986
That I was naked in the shower?

556
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:23,205
I didn't know you were naked.

557
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,832
Why were you here so early?

558
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:26,389
They shut my water off.

559
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,293
What were you doing here so
early?

560
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:31,625
Building this.

561
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,897
You built this? Mm-hmm.

562
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,635
They're kind a pissed about
this.

563
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,932
Really?

564
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,137
Hey, guys.

565
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,171
Have you seen the place?
Mm-hmm.

566
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,308
It's pretty good. It's a
little too good.

567
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,375
Corporate must have sent in a
professional.

568
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,280
I don't know why some body's
Gunning' for my job,

569
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:52,917
But, look... let's
Remain team, okay?

570
00:35:52,952 --> 00:35:54,903
'Cause if I go, we all go.

571
00:35:54,938 --> 00:35:56,819
If you get wind of anything,

572
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,422
Call me on my radio,
Channel three.

573
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,493
Code word is "Santa's got
A brand new bag,"

574
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:03,824
Okay?

575
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,348
Six-inch ribbon curis, honey.

576
00:36:07,383 --> 00:36:10,368
That's impossible. Six... inches.

577
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,706
By the way... I think you have

578
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:17,475
The most beautiful singing voice

579
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,466
In the whole wide worid.

580
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,684
Santa...

581
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,222
Hey, hey! Ho ho ho!

582
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,823
Yeah!

583
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,726
Santa, it's me buddy!

584
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,764
It's me! Hey, buddy,
How you doing?

585
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:40,730
It's me!

586
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,400
Are you ready to see Santa?

587
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:43,799
Who the heck are you?

588
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,370
What are you talking about?
I'm Santa Claus.

589
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:47,203
No, you're not.

590
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,408
Uh, WH-why, of course I am!

591
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:51,374
Ho ho ho ho ho!

592
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,242
Well, if you're Santa...

593
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,447
What song did I sing for you on?
Your birthday this year?

594
00:36:56,482 --> 00:37:00,051
Uh, happy birthday of course!

595
00:37:00,086 --> 00:37:01,184
Ho ho ho ho ho!

596
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,255
Uh, so, how old are you, son?

597
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:04,787
Four.

598
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,189
You're a big boy, what's
your name?

599
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,793
Paul. And, uh, what can I
get you for Christmas?

600
00:37:08,828 --> 00:37:10,027
Paul... don't tell him what
You want.

601
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,428
He's a liar. Let the kid talk.

602
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:15,733
You disgust me. How can you live?
With yourself?

603
00:37:15,768 --> 00:37:17,902
Just cool it, zippy. Woman:
Smile.

604
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:19,702
You sit on a throne of lies.

605
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,906
Look, I'm not kidding'.
You're a fake.

606
00:37:21,941 --> 00:37:22,872
I'm a fake? Yes.

607
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,243
How'd you like to be dead, huh?

608
00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:28,246
Fake. No, he's kidding.

609
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:28,744
You stink.

610
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,115
I think you're gonna have a good
Christmas, all right?

611
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,834
You smell like beef and cheese.

612
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:34,518
You don't smell like Santa.

613
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:35,786
Okay.

614
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,323
He's an imposter! He's not
Santa!

615
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:45,296
He's a fake! He's a fake!
Come here. Come here!

616
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:46,763
I saw!

617
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,328
He's a fake!

618
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,376
Ha ha! Where you going now?
Where you going...?

619
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,607
Ohh! Ohh!

620
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,449
No!

621
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,826
He's not Santa Claus!

622
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,623
He's not Santa!

623
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,593
"To someone special."

624
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,528
What's that? Intercom.

625
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:52,630
All right.

626
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,337
Yeah? Mr. Hobbs, the police are
On line one.

627
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:02,139
Police. Hello?

628
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:21,324
Dad!

629
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,594
I knew that you'd come,
I love you for coming.

630
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:25,163
Officer tom, this is my dad.

631
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:26,697
This is Walter... he came.

632
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:27,496
He bailed me out.

633
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,732
They gave me one phone call.

634
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:29,899
They gave me one phone call,

635
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,403
And I said," I know who
I'm gonna call...

636
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:33,069
Walter Hobbs."

637
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,070
And sure enough, you showed up.

638
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,123
You did, they said you weren't
goanna show up.

639
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:38,785
They told me so many times...
shh shh shh shh shh.

640
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,412
Just who the heck are you,
And what is your problem?

641
00:39:41,447 --> 00:39:43,547
I- I'm buddy, I'm your son.

642
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:44,647
Wait, um...

643
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,534
Tell me, tell me, tell me, uh...

644
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:48,386
Where'd you get this picture?

645
00:39:48,421 --> 00:39:50,980
Papa elf gave it to me.

646
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,891
Listen... is this some kind a
game?

647
00:39:53,926 --> 00:39:55,443
What do you want, some money?

648
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:56,926
No! I just wanted to meet you,

649
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,192
And I thought you might Anna
Meet me.

650
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,432
Who wouldn't Anna meet you?

651
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,007
I thought maybe we could make
Gingerbread houses,

652
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:12,476
And eat cookie dough, and go
Ice skating, and...

653
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:14,712
And maybe even hold hands.

654
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:16,445
Uh-huh.

655
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,573
Come with me. Okay.

656
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:29,449
Okay. What have we got here?

657
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,265
Buddy, don't eat those.

658
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:46,709
Ohh!

659
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,077
We got to really hurry up, Walter,

660
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,748
'cause I'm double booked the
rest of the afternoon.

661
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:51,247
Am I sick?

662
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,550
Yeah, but that's not why we're
Here.

663
00:40:52,585 --> 00:40:53,516
We're hereto do a test, come on.

664
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,583
What kind test? Just a test to
Find out

665
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,754
If you're my son or not. Why am
I sitting on paper?

666
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,773
Because it's sanitary for the
other patients.

667
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:00,758
Now, sit still so I can do
the finger prick.

668
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:02,377
Finger prick!

669
00:41:02,412 --> 00:41:03,926
Ohh! It's cold.

670
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,012
Yeah, just pleases it still,
Please?

671
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:06,028
Okay, can I listen to your
necklace?

672
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,631
No, you can't. Will you
Just sit still...

673
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:08,631
Why is there a skeleton?
over there?

674
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,850
I don't know, Walter,
Could you please...?

675
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:10,993
If I squint it looks like a
pirate flag.

676
00:41:11,028 --> 00:41:12,067
Could you please have him?
Sit still?

677
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:13,537
Does he have a name? No,
He hasn't got a name.

678
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:14,503
I'm sorry, Ben, I am sorry.

679
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:15,572
I have a lot of patients
waiting.

680
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,174
Would you please it still?
Please.

681
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:18,707
He got mad at me. Yes, he did.
He did.

682
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,011
The sooner you sit still,
The sooner we can

683
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:21,744
Get this mess over with.

684
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,230
Okay. Then can we eat sugar
plums?

685
00:41:23,265 --> 00:41:24,647
You betch a... we'll eat sugar
Plums,

686
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,618
Have gingerbread houses,
And we'll even paint eggs.

687
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:30,018
Well, paint eggs, that's Easter.

688
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:34,056
Ow! Ohh...

689
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,158
My finger has a heartbeat.

690
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,996
It won't hurt so much after
a little.

691
00:41:39,031 --> 00:41:40,798
What's your name?

692
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,465
Buddy.

693
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,068
I'm Carolyn.

694
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:45,535
Hi.

695
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,705
What do you want for Christmas?

696
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,771
A Suzy-talks-a-lot.

697
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,542
I'll put in a good word with
the big man.

698
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:53,476
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.

699
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,814
Oh, it's not a costume.
I'm an elf.

700
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:58,716
Well, technically, I'm a human,

701
00:41:58,751 --> 00:42:00,182
But I was raised by elves.

702
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,587
Oh, I'm a human raised by humans.

703
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:06,249
Hmm. Cool.

704
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,586
So?

705
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:18,369
It's a boy... buddy's your son.

706
00:42:18,404 --> 00:42:20,002
That's very impossible.

707
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,638
You... you saw that guy out there.

708
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:23,140
He's... he's certifiably insane.

709
00:42:23,175 --> 00:42:24,573
He's probably just reverting

710
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,211
To a state of childlike
dependency.

711
00:42:27,246 --> 00:42:28,177
An elf?

712
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,247
What he needs is to be nurtured.

713
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:32,266
Oh, I see.

714
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:34,216
So, um, uh...

715
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,936
You'd like me to breastfeed him?

716
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,586
Walter, just bring him home.

717
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:38,787
Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,

718
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,023
And once... once he comes to
Terms with reality,

719
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,194
He should drop the whole elf
Thing and move on with his life.

720
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,697
I mean, that's what I would do if
I was you.

721
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:50,267
Oh, my god! Walter, this is...

722
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:51,567
This is wonderful,

723
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,454
You... you have another son.

724
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:55,271
Wonderful. Oh, gosh, I...

725
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:58,108
I guess I never really thought
of it that way.

726
00:42:58,143 --> 00:42:59,542
This is incredible, I...

727
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,829
You know, it's a little
complicated,

728
00:43:01,864 --> 00:43:04,081
But it's nothing that we can't
handle.

729
00:43:04,116 --> 00:43:06,549
Honey? What?

730
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,587
He thinks he's an elf.

731
00:43:09,622 --> 00:43:10,686
I'm sorry, what?

732
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:13,390
He think she's a Christmas elf.

733
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:14,089
Oh, come on, Walter,

734
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:18,322
I'm sure he doesn't actually
think he's an elf.

735
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,732
And then, I traveled through
the seven levels

736
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,232
Of the candy cane forest,

737
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:27,403
Past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops,

738
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:33,104
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel.

739
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,323
Ahh.

740
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:57,468
So, where were you for the
last 30 years?

741
00:43:57,503 --> 00:43:58,367
The north pole.

742
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:01,088
Can you pass the maple syrup?
Please?

743
00:44:01,123 --> 00:44:04,967
I... I didn't put... it's
spaghetti.

744
00:44:05,002 --> 00:44:08,812
Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.

745
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:10,245
Yes.

746
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,933
You like sugar, huh?

747
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:14,718
Is there sugar in syrup?

748
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:15,884
Yes.

749
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,152
Then yes.

750
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,690
We elves try to stick to the
four main food groups

751
00:44:19,725 --> 00:44:25,796
Candy, candy canes, candy corns,
and syrup.

752
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:29,466
So, will you be staying with us?
Then?

753
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:30,633
You mean I can stay?

754
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,167
Of course you can. Emily.

755
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,705
How... how long do you think
you'll be with us?

756
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,208
I... I hadn't really planned
it out,

757
00:44:37,243 --> 00:44:39,642
But I was thinking, like...
forever.

758
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,413
Emily? Can I just speak to you
for a minute

759
00:44:42,448 --> 00:44:45,211
in the, uh, kitchen, please?

760
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,020
Are you crazy? He cannot
stay here.

761
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:52,154
Clearly he has some serious issues.

762
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,425
We can't just throw him out in
the snow.

763
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,293
Why not? He loves the snow.

764
00:44:56,328 --> 00:44:58,341
He's told me 15 times.

765
00:44:58,376 --> 00:45:00,355
Walter, he's your son.

766
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,905
Did you hear that?

767
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,943
You are so weird.

768
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:23,285
Dad?

769
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:28,019
Dad?

770
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,292
Dad!

771
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,097
What?

772
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,335
What?

773
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,473
I am not gonna tuck you in.

774
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,909
I... I promise I'll go right
to sleep.

775
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,547
Fine.

776
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,174
Tickle fight, tickle fight!
buddy, stop.

777
00:46:01,209 --> 00:46:03,327
Tickle fight. Tickle... stop
stop, stop.

778
00:46:03,362 --> 00:46:04,919
Sorry.

779
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,964
It's all right.

780
00:46:06,999 --> 00:46:07,898
Hey, uh...

781
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,968
You just lay there and go to
sleep.

782
00:46:11,003 --> 00:46:12,281
Okay.

783
00:46:12,316 --> 00:46:13,559
Okay.

784
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,369
Dad? Hmm?

785
00:46:17,404 --> 00:46:20,300
I love you.

786
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:26,374
Okay. Go to sleep now.

787
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,087
Well, this is really something.

788
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:36,456
I'm usually the one making
breakfast.

789
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,487
That's good, that's good.

790
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:43,459
Okay.

791
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,309
Oh, that's good.

792
00:46:52,344 --> 00:46:54,044
Good? Good.

793
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,344
Good.

794
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,313
So, did you, um...

795
00:46:58,348 --> 00:46:59,950
Did you sleep okay last night?

796
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:01,517
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.

797
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,851
And I had time to build that
rocking horse.

798
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:09,059
Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually
made that?

799
00:47:09,094 --> 00:47:11,857
Where did you get all the wood?

800
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,491
Good morning, honey. Good
morning, dad.

801
00:47:24,526 --> 00:47:27,377
Walter, buddy has made us
breakfast.

802
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:29,346
Isn't that nice?

803
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:31,165
And lunch.

804
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,592
And lunch.

805
00:47:32,627 --> 00:47:33,949
Bye.

806
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:34,917
So, dad, how many scoops?

807
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,887
I'll stick with the coffee now,
thanks.

808
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:40,956
So, dad...

809
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,658
I planned out our whole day.

810
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,859
First, we'll make snow angels
for two hours,

811
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,530
And then we'll go ice skating
and then we'll eat a
whole roll

812
00:47:46,565 --> 00:47:48,599
Of tollhouse cookie dough as fast
as we can,

813
00:47:48,634 --> 00:47:50,934
And then, to finish, we'll snuggle.

814
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:53,637
I've got to go to work, buddy.

815
00:47:53,672 --> 00:47:54,837
Oh, and another thing...

816
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,673
If you're going to be staying
here,

817
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,475
You should think about, you know,

818
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,142
Getting rid of the costume.

819
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,510
But I've worn this my whole life.

820
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,681
You're not in the North Pole any
longer.

821
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:06,984
You wanna make me happy, don't you?

822
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:07,583
More than anything.

823
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:12,456
Then, lose the tights. I mean,
as soon as possible.

824
00:48:12,491 --> 00:48:14,091
As soon as possible?

825
00:48:14,126 --> 00:48:15,692
As soon as possible.

826
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,091
Okay.

827
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,097
I almost forgot...

828
00:48:20,132 --> 00:48:21,997
Aah! Aah!

829
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,630
Good morning.

830
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:31,673
Walter here.

831
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,976
It worked, it's you.

832
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,996
How'd you get this number?

833
00:48:36,031 --> 00:48:37,981
Emily left an emergency list.

834
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:38,580
I see.

835
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,250
And, uh, is this an emergency?

836
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:41,416
There's a horrible noise

837
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:44,454
Coming from the evil
box underneath the window.

838
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:45,756
It sounds like this...

839
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,262
It's, uh, it's... it's not evil,
buddy,

840
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:53,395
It's, uh, it's a radiator,

841
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,265
And the heat makes noise when
it comes on.

842
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,469
No, it doesn't. It... It's very
evil.

843
00:48:58,504 --> 00:49:02,123
It's scary to look at. It's...
okay...

844
00:49:02,158 --> 00:49:05,742
I'm going toward... oh, wait.
Yes, it is.

845
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,444
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

846
00:49:07,479 --> 00:49:08,362
Everything's fine.

847
00:49:08,397 --> 00:49:09,211
You were right.

848
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,748
Okay, good, uh, I'm gonna hang
up now.

849
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:12,581
I love you.

850
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,301
I'll call you in five minutes.

851
00:49:14,336 --> 00:49:15,951
No, no, buddy, don't, uh...

852
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,522
You... you don't have to call me,
okay?

853
00:49:18,557 --> 00:49:20,088
Good idea, you call me.

854
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,924
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

855
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,794
I painted a picture of a
butterfly.

856
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:26,096
Good. I'm gonna hang up now.

857
00:49:26,131 --> 00:49:28,349
I tuned the piano.

858
00:49:28,384 --> 00:49:30,567
Okay, I love you. Bye.

859
00:49:30,602 --> 00:49:32,534
Mmm...

860
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,161
Mmm... Mmm.

861
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,687
Mmm.

862
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,488
Hobbs. Hey!

863
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,191
How you doing? Please, sit
down.

864
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,528
I haven't seen you since
the retreat.

865
00:49:58,563 --> 00:49:59,461
You're looking good.

866
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,914
Oh, thank you very much.
You as well.

867
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:02,297
To what do I owe the, uh,
pleasure?

868
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,733
Well, to be honest, I got a call
from my niece.

869
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:07,536
She wants to know

870
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:11,322
How a certain puppy and a
certain pigeon

871
00:50:11,357 --> 00:50:15,073
Escape the clutches of a
certain evil witch.

872
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:17,145
Believe me, uh,

873
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,680
We're already looking for new
printers.

874
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:21,267
This one has obviously gotten a
little sloppy.

875
00:50:21,302 --> 00:50:23,820
Maybe it isn't the printer who's
gotten sloppy.

876
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:26,021
That's your signature, right?

877
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:29,059
You know, we could sit here and
point fingers all day.

878
00:50:29,094 --> 00:50:30,559
I've got news for you...

879
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:33,130
Even if those two pages were
in there,

880
00:50:33,165 --> 00:50:34,563
The book still would have sucked.

881
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:36,883
Have you seen the numbers for
this quarter?

882
00:50:36,918 --> 00:50:39,169
Uh, they'll be here today. Oh,
they're in.

883
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:41,071
That frigging puppy and pigeon

884
00:50:41,106 --> 00:50:42,304
Are tanking hard, Hobbs.

885
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,307
My people estimate we're
gonna post

886
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:46,074
A minus eight for this quarter.

887
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:49,311
A minus eight! That does not
happen!

888
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,815
You know, we'll... we'll bounce
back, we...

889
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:53,601
No, no, no. No? Well...

890
00:50:53,636 --> 00:50:55,352
We're gonna ship a new book

891
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:56,754
The first quarter.

892
00:50:56,789 --> 00:50:58,086
First quarter?

893
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,740
I'm gonna be back in town on
the 24th.

894
00:51:00,775 --> 00:51:03,360
At that time, I would love
to hear

895
00:51:03,395 --> 00:51:05,127
In exact detail

896
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:08,359
What your plans are for this
new book.

897
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,262
Uh, wait a minute, the, uh
the 24th, that's Christmas
eve.

898
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,070
And?

899
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,039
And, uh...

900
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,110
No problem. Be great to have
you in the loop.

901
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:26,249
All right, I got every
weapon in the game.

902
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:28,752
I got full health, I got full
armor.

903
00:51:28,787 --> 00:51:29,584
Michael!

904
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:30,754
I got full...

905
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:31,887
Michael!

906
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,890
It's me buddy!

907
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:35,357
You know that guy?

908
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,361
No, I've never seen him before.

909
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:41,331
It's me buddy! Your brother!

910
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:42,697
Oh, man.

911
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:47,337
No, Michael! Wait! It's your
brother bud...

912
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,899
Sorry. Sorry! Horn honks

913
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,277
Michael! Michael!

914
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:56,078
Michael!

915
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,448
Michael, wait up!

916
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:00,050
Michael! Michael!

917
00:52:00,085 --> 00:52:01,583
Wow, you're fast.

918
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,470
I'm gladi caught up with you.

919
00:52:03,505 --> 00:52:05,080
I waited five hours for you.

920
00:52:05,115 --> 00:52:06,621
Why is your coat so big?

921
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:09,142
So, good news... I saw a dog
today.

922
00:52:09,177 --> 00:52:11,628
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.

923
00:52:11,663 --> 00:52:13,328
How was school? Was it fun?

924
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,265
Did you get a lot of
homework, huh?

925
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,533
Do you have any friends?

926
00:52:16,568 --> 00:52:18,018
Do you have a best friend?

927
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:19,469
Does he have a big coat, too?

928
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:20,936
Go away!

929
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:26,435
Ow! Son of a nutcracker!

930
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,712
Run!

931
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:34,651
Get him! Get the
green guy!

932
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,394
Oh, no. These guys are bad news.

933
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:46,988
We better get outta here.

934
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,799
You know what? We can take 'em.

935
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,827
Okay, just start making as
many snowballs as you can.

936
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,345
You ready?

937
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:08,080
Let's go. Aah! Ow.

938
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:10,685
Ow!

939
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,390
Run!

940
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:28,205
Oh, man. One got away.

941
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,502
Snowball.

942
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,508
Unh!

943
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,750
Wow.

944
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,218
Where did you say you were from?

945
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,455
Oh, yeah

946
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,193
Candles burning low

947
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:52,861
Lots of mistletoe

948
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:58,700
Lots of snow and ice everywhere
we go

949
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:04,274
Choirs singing carols right
outside my door

950
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:06,277
All these things and more

951
00:54:06,312 --> 00:54:08,245
I wish dad were here.

952
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:08,510
Why?

953
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:12,482
'Cause he's the greatest dad in
the whole wide worid.

954
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:13,315
Are you kidding?

955
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,919
He's the worst dad in the worid.

956
00:54:15,954 --> 00:54:17,721
What do you mean?

957
00:54:17,756 --> 00:54:19,489
All he does is work.

958
00:54:19,524 --> 00:54:20,889
Working's fun.

959
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,924
Not the way he does it.

960
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:23,959
All he cares about is money.

961
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:28,098
He doesn't care about you,
or me, or anybody.

962
00:54:28,133 --> 00:54:30,931
Well, he is on the naughty list.

963
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,435
You like her?

964
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,298
Like who?

965
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,311
The girl you're staring at.

966
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:43,095
Oh, uh...

967
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:44,844
Yeah.

968
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,285
Why don't you ask her out?

969
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,251
Out?

970
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,389
You know, on a date...
to eat food.

971
00:54:52,424 --> 00:54:53,255
Food?

972
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,024
Yes, real food, not candy.

973
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,709
And if she says yes,
you're in.

974
00:54:58,744 --> 00:55:01,359
It's like a secret code
giris have.

975
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,968
Well, look who it is.

976
00:55:05,003 --> 00:55:08,096
Hi, Jovie. Hi.

977
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,841
Oh, uh, this is Michael.

978
00:55:11,876 --> 00:55:13,468
I'm his brother.

979
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:15,443
Hi.

980
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,279
So, what are you doing here?

981
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,899
Did gimbel's give you your
job back?

982
00:55:19,934 --> 00:55:22,485
No. But things worked out
pretty good.

983
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,544
They gave mea restraining
order.

984
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:28,625
Well, um, you should probably
get outta here.

985
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,526
Ho ho ho!

986
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,795
But... I really wanted to
see you,

987
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,901
And... and I think you're
beautiful, and I, um...

988
00:55:37,936 --> 00:55:41,371
I feel really warm when I
am around you,

989
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:45,671
And, um, my tongue swells up.

990
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,876
So...

991
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,377
Do you wanna go eat food?

992
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,354
Do I... do I wanna eat food?

993
00:55:57,389 --> 00:55:58,320
Mm-hmm.

994
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:03,657
You know, uh, the code... food.

995
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:08,523
Well, I just had my lunch
break.

996
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,717
Oh, okay. I understand.

997
00:56:11,752 --> 00:56:14,537
But I'm free on Thursday.

998
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,971
Thursday! Thursday!

999
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,175
Come on. That'd be great.

1000
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,141
All right.

1001
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,910
Was that okay?

1002
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:24,573
You did great, man.

1003
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,449
What should we put on it
first?

1004
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:27,834
Lights! Oh, good.

1005
00:56:27,869 --> 00:56:29,150
And then, after that?

1006
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:32,052
Ornaments! Ornaments, okay.

1007
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,522
What the hell's that?

1008
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,825
A Christmas tree.

1009
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,058
A Christmas tree?

1010
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:40,221
Buddy chopped it down in
the park.

1011
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,430
Emily.

1012
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:45,068
I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.

1013
00:56:45,103 --> 00:56:47,104
They were just having a
little fun.

1014
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:49,070
Oh, fun? So felonies are
fun now?

1015
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,908
I thought, see, felonies
were felonies.

1016
00:56:51,943 --> 00:56:52,874
Okay, the tree thing was bad.

1017
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,175
I'll get him to plant
another one.

1018
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,813
But at least Michael is
happy for once.

1019
00:56:56,848 --> 00:56:59,381
What, uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

1020
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,718
Well, I don't think it's any
secret, Walter,

1021
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:04,020
That you haven't exactly been
there for him.

1022
00:57:04,055 --> 00:57:05,989
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just

1023
00:57:06,024 --> 00:57:07,924
Pull him outta school and let
the, uh,

1024
00:57:07,959 --> 00:57:09,224
Deranged elf man raise him?

1025
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,095
Then they can have lots of
fun committing felonies.

1026
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:15,165
How are we gonna get the star
on top?

1027
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,723
I got it.

1028
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:29,744
I mean, what are we gonna do?

1029
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,948
We can't... we can't leave him
alone here.

1030
00:57:31,983 --> 00:57:34,473
He's gonna destroy the place.

1031
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,218
Why don't you, um...

1032
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:38,553
Why don't you take off tomorrow?

1033
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,790
You know, and you could stay
home and watch him?

1034
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:43,126
Oh, no. No, I can't stay home
tomorrow,

1035
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:44,478
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.

1036
00:57:44,513 --> 00:57:46,388
Well, honey, I can't take off,

1037
00:57:46,423 --> 00:57:47,861
I'm one... one bad pitch away

1038
00:57:47,896 --> 00:57:49,264
From getting fired... one.

1039
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,218
Well, I tell you what, I have
an idea then.

1040
00:57:52,253 --> 00:57:55,137
Why don't you take buddy to
work with you?

1041
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,647
Hey, Walter. Morning, jack.

1042
00:58:04,682 --> 00:58:06,308
Morning, jack.

1043
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:07,882
Oh, good morning, Mr. Hobbs.

1044
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:09,451
Good morning, Sarah. Good
morning, Sarah.

1045
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,522
That's a nice purple dress.
It's very purple-y

1046
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:13,988
Francisco. How's it going, Mr.
Hobbs?

1047
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:18,127
Francisco, that's fun to say..."
Francisco."

1048
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:20,562
Hi! Hi.

1049
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:21,496
Do you remember me?

1050
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,446
I do. I didn't recognize you.

1051
00:58:23,481 --> 00:58:25,361
I know, I'm in work clothes.

1052
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:30,874
Thank you, Deborah.

1053
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:31,906
Thanks, deb.

1054
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:33,309
Deb, you have such a pretty face.

1055
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:34,677
You should be on a Christmas card.

1056
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:37,145
You just made my day.

1057
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:46,455
Eww.

1058
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,391
Buddy. Hmm?

1059
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:52,395
You don't have to drink that.

1060
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:53,919
Thank you.

1061
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,031
Francisco.

1062
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:09,701
Francisco.

1063
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:12,799
Francisco.

1064
00:59:12,834 --> 00:59:14,442
Francisco.

1065
00:59:14,477 --> 00:59:16,051
Buddy?

1066
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,722
Just... just a little.

1067
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:27,996
Yes, bud?

1068
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,700
Why is your name on the desk?

1069
00:59:30,735 --> 00:59:32,867
I bought the desk.

1070
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,700
My name's there so no one
steals it.

1071
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,358
That's a joke, isn't it, dad?

1072
00:59:39,393 --> 00:59:41,987
Yeah, buddy, that's a joke.

1073
00:59:42,022 --> 00:59:44,581
So, what are we gonna build?

1074
00:59:44,616 --> 00:59:45,914
No, uh, we don't do

1075
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:47,684
That kind of work here, pal.

1076
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,187
Buddy the elf, what's your
favorite color?

1077
00:59:51,222 --> 00:59:52,589
Put that down. Hello?

1078
00:59:52,624 --> 00:59:54,955
Hello? Dial tone

1079
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,728
Please, don't touch anything.

1080
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:00,195
Sorry.

1081
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:05,033
Hey...

1082
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,871
Bud, have you... have you...

1083
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:10,974
Have you ever seen a mailroom?

1084
01:00:11,009 --> 01:00:12,208
A mailroom? No.

1085
01:00:12,243 --> 01:00:13,408
No? No.

1086
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,242
Oh, I mean, wow.

1087
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,013
Wow... listen, it's a
place where mail

1088
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:18,012
From all over the worid
comes,

1089
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,750
Uh-huh. And they sort it
out there, see?

1090
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:21,716
And you can touch it all,

1091
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:23,586
And they put it in these
shiny bins.

1092
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:25,086
Shiny bins? Right.

1093
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,624
What do ya think? It
sounds great.

1094
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:28,656
Good.

1095
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,193
Can we go there?

1096
01:00:30,228 --> 01:00:30,959
Well, um...

1097
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:34,197
I gotta work here, maybe... maybe
you can work there.

1098
01:00:34,232 --> 01:00:35,498
Okay, I'll work there.

1099
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:40,236
Oh, I don't think this is
the place

1100
01:00:40,271 --> 01:00:41,502
My dad was talking about.

1101
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:43,039
Is there a different mailroom?

1102
01:00:43,074 --> 01:00:45,274
No. This is the only one.

1103
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,504
It's not very shiny.

1104
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:51,613
Now... over here's the trench.

1105
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,748
All the mail comes out that
shooter.

1106
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:58,187
Scan and find the floor each
piece is moving to.

1107
01:00:58,222 --> 01:00:59,153
Put it in a canister

1108
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:02,792
And shove it up the tube with
the same number.

1109
01:01:02,827 --> 01:01:04,244
You got that?

1110
01:01:04,279 --> 01:01:05,627
I think so.

1111
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,631
This place reminds me of
Santa's workshop.

1112
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:10,164
Except it smells like mushrooms,

1113
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:13,225
And everyone looks like they
wanna hurt me.

1114
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,505
Uh, greenway's coming in tomorrow,

1115
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,105
So, what... what do we got?

1116
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,175
Well, Morris and I have been
brainstorming,

1117
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,644
And we've come up with what I
think

1118
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:23,079
Is a pretty big idea.

1119
01:01:23,114 --> 01:01:23,578
Great, what?

1120
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,149
You're gonna love it, it's
fantastic.

1121
01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:27,115
What?

1122
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:30,452
Okay, picture this...

1123
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:33,754
We bring in miles finch.

1124
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,242
The miles finch?

1125
01:01:36,277 --> 01:01:37,486
The golden ghost.

1126
01:01:37,521 --> 01:01:38,660
We bring him in!

1127
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,564
He's written more classics than dr.
Seuss.

1128
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:42,563
I tain't gonna be easy,

1129
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:44,198
But I think it's worth a shot.

1130
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:48,871
My two top writers, my crack team,
my fun squad...

1131
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:50,538
You came in here pitching me

1132
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:53,109
The idea of hiring another writer?

1133
01:01:53,144 --> 01:01:54,175
Yeah.

1134
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,371
Miles finch.

1135
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,607
I like it. Chuckles

1136
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:03,718
I like it.

1137
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,822
Then I traveled through the seven
levels

1138
01:02:05,857 --> 01:02:06,788
Of the candy cane forest

1139
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:11,094
And past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops.

1140
01:02:11,129 --> 01:02:13,561
Ooh!

1141
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:16,631
Wow... it's sucky.

1142
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:19,118
Ohh, it's wonderful. Yes!

1143
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:21,571
That is marvelous how that...

1144
01:02:21,606 --> 01:02:23,337
Oh!

1145
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:25,891
Oh, it's very sucky.

1146
01:02:25,926 --> 01:02:28,411
It's very... sucky.

1147
01:02:28,446 --> 01:02:29,711
Whoo.

1148
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,614
So, how'd you get here?

1149
01:02:31,649 --> 01:02:33,082
Work release.

1150
01:02:33,117 --> 01:02:34,182
Mm.

1151
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,751
Oh, syrup and coffee?

1152
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:40,089
Why didn't I think of that? Can I
try some?

1153
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:41,222
Be my guest.

1154
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,724
Very generous of you.

1155
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:47,162
Mmm. I love syrup.

1156
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,360
Ohh, I love it.

1157
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,569
Mmm...

1158
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,406
You know, I know I sound like a
broken record,

1159
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:58,372
But we are buddies.

1160
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,643
You're my best friend, that's it.

1161
01:03:00,678 --> 01:03:01,375
You're my best friend.

1162
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:04,113
You know, buddy, nobody around
here listens to me.

1163
01:03:04,148 --> 01:03:06,282
I got really good ideas. Yeah?
I believe it.

1164
01:03:06,317 --> 01:03:08,317
I know, I'm right, I listen to you.

1165
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:09,250
You have great ideas.

1166
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,187
I just try to go with the flow,
you know?

1167
01:03:11,222 --> 01:03:12,339
Good, you go with the flow.

1168
01:03:12,374 --> 01:03:13,421
Yeah. Go with the flow.

1169
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,840
No, I gotta get out of the flow.

1170
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,190
Well, then get out of the flow.

1171
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:17,391
I'm in the flow, that's what got
me here.

1172
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:20,863
I gotta... I'm 26 years old, I got
nothing to show for it.

1173
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:22,865
You're young. You're so young.

1174
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:24,632
My papa... yeah?

1175
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:29,305
He didn't make master tinker till
he was 490,so...

1176
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:33,910
Four-hundred and ninety? Yeah.

1177
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,913
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1178
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:40,381
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1179
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:43,920
My favorite book of yours has
gotta be Gus' pickles.

1180
01:03:43,955 --> 01:03:47,140
It's existential, yet it's so
accessible.

1181
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:50,068
Uh, Mr. Finch, uh, Eugene Dupris
here.

1182
01:03:50,103 --> 01:03:52,962
It's a thrill just to be talking
to you

1183
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:54,162
On our speakerphone.

1184
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:56,232
Miles, um, so, what do you think?

1185
01:03:56,267 --> 01:03:57,165
Can you fly in tomorrow?

1186
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,468
I'll give you five hours tomorrow,

1187
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:00,668
Not a minute more.

1188
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:01,736
Oh, that's... that's great.

1189
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:05,408
I'd like a black s500to receive
me at the airport.

1190
01:04:05,443 --> 01:04:07,210
I need the interior of that car

1191
01:04:07,245 --> 01:04:09,210
To be 71 degrees exactly.

1192
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:10,980
We can do that. Deborah: Mr. Hobbs?

1193
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:12,715
There's a situation downstairs.

1194
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,915
I'm sorry, what?

1195
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,149
No, hold on, miles. Deb, hang up.

1196
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,318
I do not hold. Do not put
me on hold.

1197
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,956
We have a problem in the
mailroom.

1198
01:04:19,991 --> 01:04:20,822
What's going on?

1199
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,858
Don't speak... Deborah, hang up!

1200
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:24,860
That's it, I'm gone. Miles!

1201
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:30,316
I'll be there tomorrow... 71
degrees.

1202
01:04:30,351 --> 01:04:32,902
Sir, chuck in the mailroom

1203
01:04:32,937 --> 01:04:34,404
Needs to talk to you.

1204
01:04:34,439 --> 01:04:35,837
Chuck... what, chuck?

1205
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,371
I mean, what could be going on
down there

1206
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:39,442
That's so important you had to
interrupt me, what?

1207
01:04:39,477 --> 01:04:41,378
Whoomp, there it is! A little
louder

1208
01:04:41,413 --> 01:04:43,279
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

01:04:43,314 --> 01:04:45,179
Whoomp! There it is

1210
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,615
Upside down and inside out hey!

01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,017
I'm 'bout to show all you folks

1212
01:04:48,052 --> 01:04:49,450
What it's all about hey!

1213
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:50,685
Time for me to get on the mike

1214
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,288
And make this mother of a party
hype

1215
01:04:52,323 --> 01:04:53,940
I'm taking you back to the old
school

1216
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:55,523
'cause I'm an old fool who's so cool

1217
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,360
If you wanna get down, I'm gonna
show you the way

1218
01:04:57,395 --> 01:04:59,495
Whoomp, there it is, let me hear

1219
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:01,648
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1220
01:05:01,683 --> 01:05:03,725

01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,768
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

01:05:05,803 --> 01:05:07,436
Whoomp, there it is!

1223
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:10,339
Coming.

1224
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:17,396
Hi.

1225
01:05:17,431 --> 01:05:18,779
Wow.

1226
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:20,549
You look miraculous.

1227
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:21,918
So do you.

1228
01:05:21,953 --> 01:05:23,217
Thank you.

1229
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,254
What would you like to do?

1230
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:27,347
I got some ideas.

1231
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:35,364
Just reach out in front of you and
and take a sip.

1232
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:38,822
Don't look. There you go.

1233
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,437
Well?

1234
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:45,508
It tastes like a crappy cup
of coffee.

1235
01:05:45,543 --> 01:05:47,772
No.

1236
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,045
It is a crappy cup of coffee.

1237
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,547
No, it's the worid's best cup
of coffee.

1238
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:57,320
The trick is to not get your arm caught
in the door!

1239
01:05:57,355 --> 01:06:00,821
Also, never close your eyes' cause
then

1240
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:04,527
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you
just jump in!

1241
01:06:04,562 --> 01:06:06,260
what are you doing?

1242
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,348
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.

1243
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:12,401
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.

1244
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:15,097
Now, look at the size of this one.

1245
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:22,474
Come with me.

1246
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,412
Watch out.

1247
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,478
Yellow ones don't stop.

1248
01:06:26,513 --> 01:06:28,510
The yellow ones don't stop.

1249
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:38,120
Wow... that's a big one.

1250
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,232
I'm sorry.

1251
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:01,549
You missed.

1252
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:03,519
What do you mean I missed?

1253
01:07:03,554 --> 01:07:05,043
You missed.

1254
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,475
Miles finch.

1255
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,076
Miles finch.

1256
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,912
Miles finch.

1257
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:35,850
All right, let's do this.

1258
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,220
Miles, I'm so happy you could come
Uh...

1259
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:38,586
Yeah.

1260
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:41,257
I'm Walter Hobbs. Yeah, let's get
the, uh...

1261
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:43,893
Taken care of so we can get started
here.

1262
01:07:43,928 --> 01:07:45,622
Here you go.

1263
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:48,562
Great.

1264
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:51,083
All right... clears throat

1265
01:07:51,118 --> 01:07:53,569
What have you guys got so far?

1266
01:07:53,604 --> 01:07:54,904
Go ahead.

1267
01:07:54,939 --> 01:07:56,170
Uh...

1268
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:59,442
We were thinking, uh, something
like this, uh...

1269
01:07:59,477 --> 01:08:01,409
We open on a young tomato.

1270
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,579
He's had some tough times down
at the farm

1271
01:08:03,614 --> 01:08:05,448
With, you know, a rabbit, and...

1272
01:08:05,483 --> 01:08:07,033
No. No tomatoes...

1273
01:08:07,068 --> 01:08:08,549
Too vulnerable.

1274
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,135
Kids, they're already vulnerable.

1275
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,863
No, you see? I... I told you guys.

1276
01:08:11,898 --> 01:08:13,556
I told them the very same thing...

1277
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:14,188
And no farms.

1278
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,659
Every body's pushing small town
rural.

1279
01:08:16,694 --> 01:08:19,095
A farm book would just be white
noise.

1280
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:19,927
What about this?

1281
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:22,930
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,

1282
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:27,595
But they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.

1283
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,643
Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.

1284
01:08:34,678 --> 01:08:35,928
I have no time, so, you know,

1285
01:08:35,963 --> 01:08:37,144
If you've got a story here...

1286
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:39,982
I've got about five or six great
starts here.

1287
01:08:40,017 --> 01:08:42,051
I've got one idea that
I'm especially

1288
01:08:42,086 --> 01:08:44,270
Psyched out of my mind about.

1289
01:08:44,305 --> 01:08:46,164
You know, it's one of those ideas

1290
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:48,023
Where you're just like, uh...

1291
01:08:48,058 --> 01:08:48,923
Yes!

1292
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,158
Whoa!

1293
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:53,561
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?

1294
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:56,966
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh

1295
01:08:57,001 --> 01:08:59,736
Dad! I'm in love, I'm in love,

1296
01:08:59,771 --> 01:09:02,471
And I don't care who knows it!

1297
01:09:02,506 --> 01:09:03,170
Buddy, not now, uh,

1298
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,490
Can you please go back to the...
to the pit?

1299
01:09:05,525 --> 01:09:07,776
I'll come and visit you in a
little while, okay?

1300
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:11,245
I didn't know you had elves
working here.

1301
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:16,185
Oh... boy, you're... you're hilarious,
my friend.

1302
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:18,452
He doesn't, uh... get back to

1303
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,157
The story, please. All right, okay.

1304
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,757
So, on the cover above the title...

1305
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,144
Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?

1306
01:09:26,179 --> 01:09:28,462
You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.

1307
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,633
Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?

1308
01:09:30,668 --> 01:09:32,501
Buddy... go back to the basement.

1309
01:09:32,536 --> 01:09:34,034
Hey, jack weed,

1310
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,636
I get more action in a week

1311
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,037
Than you've had your entire life.

1312
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:40,676
I've got houses in I.e., Paris,
and Vail,

1313
01:09:40,711 --> 01:09:42,076
Oh. Each one of them

1314
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,113
with a 70-inchplasma screen.

1315
01:09:44,148 --> 01:09:45,579
So, I suggest you wipe

1316
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:46,981
That stupid smile off your face

1317
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,585
Before I come over there and smack
it off!

1318
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,253
You feeling strong, my friend?!

1319
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:54,689
Call me elf one more time!

1320
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:01,528
He's an angry elf.

1321
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:07,134
Look at you.

1322
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:11,040
Ow! Hey, what...

1323
01:10:11,075 --> 01:10:11,805
Aah!

1324
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,542
I wasn't ready for that.

1325
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:15,828
Aah! Hey, hey, hey!

1326
01:10:15,863 --> 01:10:18,080
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

1327
01:10:18,115 --> 01:10:18,546
Ooh...

1328
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,549
Call me elf one more time!

1329
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:22,330
Call me elf!

1330
01:10:22,365 --> 01:10:24,076
You're an elf.

1331
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:33,122
Miles, I'm sorry, he... he thinks
he's an elf.

1332
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:34,862
Listen, miles...

1333
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,396
Listen, miles! Door slams

1334
01:10:37,431 --> 01:10:39,896
He must be a South Pole elf.

1335
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,923
You get the hell outta here.

1336
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:45,266
Where do you want me to go?

1337
01:10:45,301 --> 01:10:46,540
I don't care where you go.

1338
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,843
I don't care that you're an elf!

1339
01:10:47,878 --> 01:10:49,612
I don't care that you're nuts!

1340
01:10:49,647 --> 01:10:51,347
I don't care that you're my son!

1341
01:10:51,382 --> 01:10:54,282
Get out of my life now!

1342
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:05,726
Hi, it's me.

1343
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,294
I really can't talk right now.

1344
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:09,597
Well, just tell me how the pitch
went.

1345
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:12,401
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?

1346
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:14,670
Well, don't be too late, Walter,

1347
01:11:14,705 --> 01:11:16,422
It's Christmas Eve.

1348
01:11:16,457 --> 01:11:18,105
Walter... wait, um.

1349
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,276
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.

1350
01:11:20,311 --> 01:11:22,437
Oh, say hi to buddy.

1351
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:24,912
What? Walter, breakthrough.

1352
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,182
We found this in the conference
room.

1353
01:11:27,217 --> 01:11:27,648
What is it?

1354
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,583
It's miles finch's notebook.

1355
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,788
This thing is chock full of
genius ideas.

1356
01:11:32,823 --> 01:11:33,420
I mean, look at that.

1357
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:37,326
And his best idea is about a
peach that lives on a farm.

1358
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:39,628
What's more vulnerable than a
peach?

1359
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:40,261
What, uh, what do we do?

1360
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,632
I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.

1361
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:44,265
Uh, how much time we got?

1362
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,168
We got, like, 45 minutes. Well,
come on, let's, uh,

1363
01:11:46,203 --> 01:11:48,170
Try to get a storyboard or
something ready.

1364
01:11:48,205 --> 01:11:49,403
Come on, let's do it. Just try.

1365
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,940
No, you can't sit down and get a
storyboard ready.

1366
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:53,475
Go and get a storyboard ready.

1367
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,739
Oh, boy! Go.

1368
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,915
"I'm sorry I ruined your lives

1369
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:06,854
"And crammed 11 cookies into
the vcr.

1370
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:12,293
"I don't belong here. I don't
belong anywhere.

1371
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:18,267
I'll never forget you. Love,
buddy."

1372
01:12:18,302 --> 01:12:19,700
God...

1373
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,370
Hey, buddy.

1374
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,450
Buddy?

1375
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,426
As you know, we need a big
launch fast

1376
01:12:44,461 --> 01:12:45,759
To get the company back on
track.

1377
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:49,031
So, I think I speak for my fellow
board members

1378
01:12:49,066 --> 01:12:52,201
When I say... this better be good.

1379
01:12:52,236 --> 01:12:54,787
Before I get into the story, uh,

1380
01:12:54,822 --> 01:12:57,339
Let me start with the cover, okay?

1381
01:12:57,374 --> 01:12:59,642
Now, just picture this...

1382
01:12:59,677 --> 01:13:01,594
Dad! I gotta talk to you.

1383
01:13:01,629 --> 01:13:03,512
Walter: Michael, what is it?

1384
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:04,745
Buddy ran away.

1385
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,165
What? He... he left a note.

1386
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,516
I'm scared, dad, he's gone.

1387
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,020
Uh, let me just finish this
meeting,

1388
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:14,455
And then, um, we'll figure it
out, okay?

1389
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:18,894
Figure out what? Buddy cares
about everybody.

1390
01:13:18,929 --> 01:13:21,055
All you care about is yourself.

1391
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:25,289
Hey, Michael.

1392
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:27,435
Wait.

1393
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:34,243
We're gonna have to reschedule
this, uh, Mr. Greenway.

1394
01:13:34,278 --> 01:13:35,661
We don't have time to reschedule.

1395
01:13:35,696 --> 01:13:37,045
I wanna hear the damn thing now.

1396
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,212
Son, you'll have to wait.

1397
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:42,274
No, d-don't tell my kid what
to do, uh...

1398
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:45,788
Can't... can't we do this another
time, Mr. Greenway?

1399
01:13:45,823 --> 01:13:48,590
I flew in just to hear this pitch,

1400
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:49,890
And I intend to.

1401
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,392
It's gonna have to wait.

1402
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,427
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,

1403
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:56,431
You will pitch me this book
right now.

1404
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,487
Well... up yours.

1405
01:14:06,522 --> 01:14:09,536
Yeah, up yours. Hey.

1406
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,446
Hobbs... Hobbs!

1407
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:14,248
Hobbs, you walk out of here,

1408
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,819
And... and you're finished at
greenway!

1409
01:14:16,854 --> 01:14:18,377
You're finished!

1410
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:38,596
I don't belong anywhere.

1411
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:42,861
Buddy!

1412
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:44,812
Buddy!

1413
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:47,008
Buddy, where are you?!

1414
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:58,894
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!

1415
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:02,464
Vixen, up, up!

1416
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:04,591
Santa?

1417
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,003
Come on, you can do it.

1418
01:15:08,038 --> 01:15:11,632
Pull up! Pull up!

1419
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,548
Dad! What?

1420
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:23,085
Michael, where you going?

1421
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,450
Michael!

1422
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:42,936
Santa.

1423
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:47,676
Back off, slick. You'll scare
the deer.

1424
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:50,445
Buddy, is that you?

1425
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,378
Are you okay?

1426
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:53,981
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1427
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:57,920
The Claus meter suddenly just
dropped down to zero.

1428
01:15:57,955 --> 01:16:01,557
There's just no Christmas
spirit anymore.

1429
01:16:01,592 --> 01:16:04,571
And then the strain was too
Much...

1430
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:07,551
The engine broke free of her
mounts.

1431
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:15,068
I need an elf's help.

1432
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,605
I... I'm not an elf, Santa.

1433
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,073
I... I can't do anything right.

1434
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:24,947
Buddy, you're more of an elf than
anyone I ever met,

1435
01:16:24,982 --> 01:16:27,350
And the only one who I would want

1436
01:16:27,385 --> 01:16:29,718
Working on my sleigh tonight.

1437
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:31,652
Really? Really.

1438
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:34,306
Will you fix it for me, buddy?

1439
01:16:34,341 --> 01:16:36,925
I'll try. Papa taught me how.

1440
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:37,724
You gotta find it first.

1441
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,562
It dropped off the sleigh back
over there a ways.

1442
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:43,498
The engine? The engine, yeah.

1443
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:46,602
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!

1444
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,636
I'm standing here outside
central park

1445
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:53,208
Where it is unclear exactly
what has happened.

1446
01:16:53,243 --> 01:16:55,110
What we do know is that
authorities

1447
01:16:55,145 --> 01:16:55,943
Have closed the park

1448
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,210
And are in the process of
clearing it.

1449
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:59,982
The only thing that people can
seem to agree on here

1450
01:17:00,017 --> 01:17:03,485
Is that they saw something fall
from the sky.

1451
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,718
I've got an eyewitness with me

1452
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:06,955
Who claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.

1453
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:08,155
What did you actually see?

1454
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,726
You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,

1455
01:17:10,761 --> 01:17:12,995
And my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.

1456
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:14,063
Oh, your daughter saw it?

1457
01:17:14,098 --> 01:17:15,062
Sweetheart, can you tell me

1458
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,466
What you saw falling out of the
sky?

1459
01:17:17,501 --> 01:17:19,167
It was Santa's sleigh!

1460
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,671
Santa's sleigh, well, there you
have it.

1461
01:17:22,706 --> 01:17:23,503
Santa's in Manhattan.

1462
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:26,708
Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, charlotte,

1463
01:17:26,743 --> 01:17:28,878
But New York one has just received

1464
01:17:28,913 --> 01:17:31,014
Some exclusive amateur news footage

1465
01:17:31,049 --> 01:17:33,080
That you just might Anna follow
up on.

1466
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:36,518
There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elf

1467
01:17:36,553 --> 01:17:37,985
Wandering through central park.

1468
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:41,023
Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting news

1469
01:17:41,058 --> 01:17:43,058
You're used to covering in buffalo,
charlotte,

1470
01:17:43,093 --> 01:17:44,660
Oh, my god. But here at New York one,

1471
01:17:44,695 --> 01:17:47,151
News is top priority.

1472
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,175
What the heck...?

1473
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:02,075
Hey!

1474
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,207
You found it. Buddy!

1475
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:12,103
I need to tell you something.

1476
01:18:12,138 --> 01:18:13,213
No, no. Buddy, there's something

1477
01:18:13,248 --> 01:18:14,254
I have to tell you right now.

1478
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:18,160
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back
there, not word.

1479
01:18:18,195 --> 01:18:22,197
I know you may be a little, um, um...

1480
01:18:22,232 --> 01:18:23,597
Uh, chemically imbalanced,

1481
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:26,368
But you've been right about a lot
of things.

1482
01:18:26,403 --> 01:18:29,802
I... I don't want you to leave.

1483
01:18:29,837 --> 01:18:33,201
You're my son, and I... love you.

1484
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:41,314
Uh, buddy, uh...

1485
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:44,219
What was it you wanted to tell me?

1486
01:18:44,254 --> 01:18:46,588
Oh, right. Come with me.

1487
01:18:46,623 --> 01:18:48,385
Right. Come on.

1488
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:56,063
I'm herewith another eyewitness

1489
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:58,400
Who has his own versión of what
happened.

1490
01:18:58,435 --> 01:18:59,533
Sir, what did you see?

1491
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:00,767
I think you're great, charlotte.

1492
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,587
Uh, I saw something fall from the
sky

1493
01:19:02,622 --> 01:19:04,372
Right into the middle of central
park.

1494
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:06,742
I mean, you're a great news lady.

1495
01:19:06,777 --> 01:19:07,541
Thank you.

1496
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,575
Could you tell me a bit more?

1497
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:09,928
About what you saw fall from the
sky?

1498
01:19:09,963 --> 01:19:11,211
Yeah, yeah. Your eyes tell the
story,

1499
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,248
That's what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.

1500
01:19:13,283 --> 01:19:15,701
The thing just dropped in the middle of
central park.

1501
01:19:15,736 --> 01:19:18,120
It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.

1502
01:19:18,155 --> 01:19:20,088
Dick, uh, according to authorities,

1503
01:19:20,123 --> 01:19:21,288
The area has been cleared.

1504
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:24,893
Only the central park rangers now
remain in the park.

1505
01:19:24,928 --> 01:19:26,728
These forces are highly trained,

1506
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:28,095
But rarely see action.

1507
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:31,266
Some have accused them of being
too gung ho

1508
01:19:31,301 --> 01:19:32,165
When called into duty,

1509
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,936
And their controversial crowd
control tactics

1510
01:19:34,971 --> 01:19:37,672
At the Simon and Garfunkel concert
in '85

1511
01:19:37,707 --> 01:19:40,008
Are still under investigation.

1512
01:19:40,043 --> 01:19:42,275
I knew you'd find it, Mr. Elf!

1513
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:45,643
Slap it on real quick, we've got
to get going.

1514
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:49,284
That ta boy.

1515
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,052
So, uh... you're, uh...

1516
01:19:55,087 --> 01:19:57,785
Santa Claus. Right.

1517
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:02,898
Would you mind taking this to
your firstborn?

1518
01:20:02,933 --> 01:20:03,396
Sure.

1519
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:06,635
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's
an elf?

1520
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:10,298
Yes. Actually, I'm adopted.

1521
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,666
Uh, Michael, would you open this
hatch for me, please?

1522
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:22,415
That ta boy, thank you.

1523
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:26,154
So, you're really Santa Claus?

1524
01:20:26,189 --> 01:20:28,890
You never can tell, kid.

1525
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:29,723
Tell me, Michael,

1526
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,459
What do you want for Christmas?

1527
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:34,613
I wanted a skateboard.

1528
01:20:34,648 --> 01:20:38,175
Oh, not just skateboard.

1529
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:41,703
Arealhuf board. Looked here.

1530
01:20:41,738 --> 01:20:43,136
Looked here...

1531
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,240
How do you like them apples?

1532
01:20:45,275 --> 01:20:47,970
Go look and see.

1533
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:55,749
Whoa.

1534
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:03,456
What happened?

1535
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:06,228
You made my sleigh fly.

1536
01:21:06,263 --> 01:21:06,960
What do you mean?

1537
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,162
Well, before the turbine days,

1538
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:12,200
This baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.

1539
01:21:12,235 --> 01:21:15,621
You believed in me. You made my
sleigh fly.

1540
01:21:15,656 --> 01:21:18,972
Hold it... if you're really Santa
Claus,

1541
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:21,443
Then we can just get some news
cameras in here,

1542
01:21:21,478 --> 01:21:22,661
And everyone will believe in you,

1543
01:21:22,696 --> 01:21:23,810
Then your sleigh will fly, right?

1544
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:26,848
Christmas spirit is about believing,
not seeing.

1545
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:29,816
If the whole worid saw me,
all would be lost.

1546
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:34,022
The paparazzi have been trying to
nail me for years.

1547
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:38,292
Hey, look!

1548
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:46,791
Oh, no.

1549
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:51,006
It's the central park rangers.

1550
01:21:55,243 --> 01:22:00,545
Dad, Michael... I got a plan.

1551
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:10,991
Santa: Whoa, wait! Wait, Michael...
my list!

1552
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:13,795
You bring that list back right now,
you hear me?!

1553
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,864
Come on, give me your hat and coat.

1554
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:18,799
Mrs. Claus made them for me.

1555
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:26,063
Hey! Hey, here I am!

1556
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:28,875
Ho ho ho!

1557
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:33,574
Hey, ho ho ho! Hey! Hey!

1558
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,989
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.

1559
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:44,960
So the authorities have not
discovered

1560
01:22:44,995 --> 01:22:46,793
Any reindeer in the park?

1561
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,346
No, no reindeer. Sleigh bells?

1562
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:49,606
No, no sleigh bells, either.

1563
01:22:49,641 --> 01:22:50,797
Elves? Excuse me, please.

1564
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:52,000
None of that, we really just
need everyone...

1565
01:22:52,035 --> 01:22:53,066
It's him, it's the real Santa!

1566
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:54,869
His sleigh won't fly,' cause nobody
believes in him!

1567
01:22:54,904 --> 01:22:56,805
Charlotte: Did you see something
in the park?

1568
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:57,437
Everyone out there,

1569
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:59,975
Santa needs us to believe,
I can prove he's real.

1570
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:00,807
Look, this is his list!

1571
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:03,810
Okay... well, further confirmation

1572
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:06,414
That there has been a Santa
sighting tonight.

1573
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:07,514
We have the naughty and nice list.

1574
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:09,851

giris play set.

1575

Okay, uh, well, obviously we have

1585
01:23:30,782 --> 01:23:32,872
A new development in the story, uh,

1586
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:35,510
A confirmation that Santa must
have been sighted

1587
01:23:35,545 --> 01:23:37,345
Because we have his book right
here.

1588
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,079

01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:42,450

01:24:01,538 --> 01:24:02,670
Who told you to say that?

1598
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:03,536
It's the real Santa.

1599
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:05,673
We need to get these cameras
back on.

1600
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:06,840
He needs our help!

1601
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,210
Hey, Michael, are you okay?

1602
01:24:09,245 --> 01:24:09,876
Yeah, I'm fine.

1603
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:13,181
But buddy, he's... he's in the
park with Santa,

1604
01:24:13,216 --> 01:24:14,381
The sleigh won't fly

1605
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:16,418
'cause there's no Christmas
spirit.

1606
01:24:16,453 --> 01:24:19,288
Michael! Mom!

1607
01:24:19,323 --> 01:24:22,088
Michael! Ohh!

1608
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:24,391
Are you okay? I'm fine.

1609
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:27,429
The best way to spread
Christmas cheer

1610
01:24:27,464 --> 01:24:31,559
Is singing loud for all
to hear.

1611
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,773
Buddy... better get going,
get in now!

1612
01:24:38,808 --> 01:24:41,643
Santa, I'm not done with the
engine yet!

1613
01:24:41,678 --> 01:24:42,909
Can't wait!

1614
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:45,430
On, dasher, on, dancer...

1615
01:24:45,465 --> 01:24:47,916
I'm not done with the engine!

1616
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:52,919
That's okay.

1617
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:56,253
You get started, I'll catch up!

1618
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:03,681
You know, he wasn't lying.

1619
01:25:03,716 --> 01:25:06,234
Merry Christmas.

1620
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:12,972
Santa, I can't...

1621
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,610
Stop messing around and get in!

1622
01:25:15,645 --> 01:25:18,943
Aah!

1623
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,087
Santa, why are they chasing us?!

1624
01:25:26,122 --> 01:25:28,189
I put the mon the naughty list,

1625
01:25:28,224 --> 01:25:30,623
And they never forgave me.

1626
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:39,817
You better watch out,
you better not cry

1627
01:25:39,852 --> 01:25:43,638
You better not pout,
I'm telling you why

1628
01:25:43,673 --> 01:25:48,576
Santa Clausis coming' to town

1629
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:53,480
Yaah, yaah, yaah!

1630
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:56,583
Up, up, pull up!

1631
01:25:56,618 --> 01:26:00,955
Buddy! We need power, we're
gonna crash!

1632
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:05,060
He's making a list,
Checking it twice

1633
01:26:05,095 --> 01:26:09,130
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

1634
01:26:09,165 --> 01:26:14,636
Santa clausis coming' to town

1635
01:26:14,671 --> 01:26:20,108
He sees you when you're sleeping

1636
01:26:20,143 --> 01:26:22,976
He knows when you're awake

1637
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:26,814
He knows if you've been bad or good

1638
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:29,549
So be good for goodness sake

1639
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:33,921
Oh, you better watch out,
you better not cry

1640
01:26:33,956 --> 01:26:38,259
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

1641
01:26:38,294 --> 01:26:44,323
Santa Clausis coming to town

1642
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:51,704
Aah!

1643
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:54,309
You can do it!
Come on, dancer.

1644
01:26:54,344 --> 01:26:56,311
That's my boy.

1645
01:26:56,346 --> 01:26:58,363
Pull, cupid! Aah!

1646
01:26:58,398 --> 01:27:00,346
Pull, dasher!

1647
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:04,552
I'm getting too old for this job.

1648
01:27:04,587 --> 01:27:06,076
Now!

1649
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:21,069
The engine's gone!

1650
01:27:21,104 --> 01:27:22,303
We're toast!

1651
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:30,109
Well, still no sign of Santa,

1652
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:32,213
But some spontaneous Christmas
caroling

1653
01:27:32,248 --> 01:27:33,112
Has broken out

1654
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:35,183
Right herein front of central
park.

1655
01:27:35,218 --> 01:27:36,216
Let's have a listen in.

1656
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,086
He sees you when you're sleeping

1657
01:27:38,121 --> 01:27:41,588
He knows if you're awake

1658
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:45,593
He knows if you've been bad or
good

1659
01:27:45,628 --> 01:27:49,397
So be good for goodness sake

1660
01:27:49,432 --> 01:27:49,829
Hey!

1661
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:53,634
You better watch out, you better
not cry

1662
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:57,405
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

1663
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,770
Come on!

1664
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:02,090
Santa clausis coming' to town

1665
01:28:02,125 --> 01:28:06,375
Santa: Just a little more!

1666
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:12,619
Hal-yah!

1667
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:15,290
He knows when you're awake

1668
01:28:15,325 --> 01:28:16,589
He knows if you've

1669
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:19,160
Wait... you're not singing.

1670
01:28:19,195 --> 01:28:20,159
Yes, I am.

1671
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:23,398
No, you're not. You're just moving
your lips.

1672
01:28:23,433 --> 01:28:25,231
Santa!

1673
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:27,869
Michael, please, what's the big deal?

1674
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,635
Dad.

1675
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:29,636
I'm telling you why

1676
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:35,439
Santa clausis coming to town

1677
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:45,785
Oh! Ha ha ha!

1678
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,955
Now, my beauties!

1679
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:56,296
Bye-bye.

1680
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,697
Just like the old days!

1681
01:28:57,732 --> 01:29:00,767
Charlotte? Charlotte?

1682
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:03,504
Well, I guess we'll never know for
sure

1683
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:05,506
What happened this Christmas Eve?

1684
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:06,839
In central park.

1685
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:13,014
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

1686
01:29:13,049 --> 01:29:15,915
Ho ho ho!

1687
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:18,851
And so, with a little help,

1688
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:20,820
Buddy managed to save Christmas.

1689
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:23,758
And his spirit saved a lot of other
People, too.

1690
01:29:23,793 --> 01:29:30,531
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1691
01:29:30,566 --> 01:29:36,869
And never brought to mind

1692
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:44,177
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1693
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:47,749
Walter started his own independent
publishing company.

1694
01:29:47,784 --> 01:29:50,502
His first book was written by a
brand new,

1695
01:29:50,537 --> 01:29:53,221
Critically acclaimed children's
author.

1696
01:29:53,256 --> 01:29:55,023
The book was elf...

1697
01:29:55,058 --> 01:29:56,756
A, uh, fictional story

1698
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:58,893
About an adopted elf named buddy

1699
01:29:58,928 --> 01:30:00,962
Who was raised in the North Pole?

1700
01:30:00,997 --> 01:30:02,997
Went to New York, ate spaghetti,

1701
01:30:03,032 --> 01:30:05,383
Worked in a shiny mailroom,

1702
01:30:05,418 --> 01:30:07,700
And eventually saved Christmas.

1703
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:10,505
"First, I traveled through the
seven levels

1704
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:12,805
"Of the candy cane forest,

1705
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:17,410
"Past the sea of twirly-swirly
gumdrops,

1706
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:22,283
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel."

1707
01:30:22,318 --> 01:30:24,517
And as for me, I can't complain.

1708
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:26,954
Buddy comes up to visit from time
to time.

1709
01:30:26,989 --> 01:30:30,525
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1710
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,026
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1711
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:37,265
Oh, thank you, Jovie. That's very
sweet of you.

1712
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,765
You're welcome, papa.

1713
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,804
But you can do the job when
you're in town

1714
01:30:42,839 --> 01:30:44,303
Hey, Suzie.

1715
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:45,238
Come here, little one.

1716
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,809
When it snows, ain't it
thrilling?

1717
01:30:47,844 --> 01:30:49,275
Papa wants to see you.

1718
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:52,914
Though your nose get a
little chilling

1719
01:30:52,949 --> 01:30:53,279
Buddy...

1720
01:30:53,314 --> 01:30:55,581
We'll frolic and play buddy...
buddy...

1721
01:30:55,616 --> 01:31:01,885
The Eskimo way, walking in a
winter wonderland

1722
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:23,361
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1723
01:31:23,396 --> 01:31:27,547
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1724
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:31,986
He'll say, are you married,
we'll say no, man

1725
01:31:32,021 --> 01:31:36,390
But you can do the job when you
in town, brother

1726
01:31:36,425 --> 01:31:40,995
Later on, we'll conspire

1727
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:45,531
As we dream by the fire

1728
01:31:45,566 --> 01:31:50,004
To face unafraid the plans
That we made

1729
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:54,337
Walking in a winter wonderland

1730
01:31:54,372 --> 01:31:58,636
Walking in a winter wonderland

1731
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:11,524
I really can't stay

1732
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:16,063
But, baby, it's cold outside

1733
01:32:16,098 --> 01:32:17,129
I've got to go 'way

1734
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:20,902
But, baby, it's cold outside

1735
01:32:20,937 --> 01:32:23,169
This evening has been

1736
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,940
Been hoping that you'd drop in

1737
01:32:25,975 --> 01:32:27,340
So very nice

1738
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:32,580
I'll hold your hands, they're
just like ice

1739
01:32:32,615 --> 01:32:35,133
My mother will start to worry

1740
01:32:35,168 --> 01:32:37,617
Beautiful, what's your hurry?

1741
01:32:37,652 --> 01:32:41,055
And father will be pacing the floor

1742
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:43,591
Listen to that fireplace roar

1743
01:32:43,626 --> 01:32:46,044
So, really, I'd better scurry

1744
01:32:46,079 --> 01:32:48,427
Beautiful, please don't hurry

1745
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:51,598
Well, maybe just a half a drink more

1746
01:32:51,633 --> 01:32:54,735
Put some records on while I pour

1747
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:57,121
The neighbors might think

1748
01:32:57,156 --> 01:32:59,182
Baby, it's bad out there

1749
01:32:59,217 --> 01:33:02,315
Say, what's in this drink?

1750
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:05,413
No cabs to be had out there

1751
01:33:05,448 --> 01:33:07,113
I wish I knew how

1752
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:09,517
Your eyes are like starlight now

1753
01:33:09,552 --> 01:33:11,450
To break the spell

1754
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:16,524
I'll take your hat, your hair
looks swell

1755
01:33:16,559 --> 01:33:19,460
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

1756
01:33:19,495 --> 01:33:21,561
Mind if I move in closer?

1757
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:24,782
At least I'm gonna say that I
tried

1758
01:33:24,817 --> 01:33:27,969
What's the sense of hurting
my pride?

1759
01:33:28,004 --> 01:33:29,871
I really can't stay

1760
01:33:29,906 --> 01:33:31,704
Baby, don't hold out

1761
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:38,736
Ah, but it's cold outside

1762
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:48,254
I simply must go

1763
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:52,259
But, baby, it's cold outside

1764
01:33:52,294 --> 01:33:54,193
The answer is no

1765
01:33:54,228 --> 01:33:57,498
But, baby, it's cold outside

1766
01:33:57,533 --> 01:33:59,265
This welcome has been

1767
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,003
I'm lucky that you dropped in

1768
01:34:02,038 --> 01:34:03,936
So nice and warm

1769
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:09,010
Look out the window at that
storm

1770
01:34:09,045 --> 01:34:11,663
My sister will be suspicious

1771
01:34:11,698 --> 01:34:14,246
Gosh, your lips look delicious

1772
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:17,518
My brother will be there at
the door

1773
01:34:17,553 --> 01:34:19,719
Waves upon tropical shore

1774
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:22,490
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious

1775
01:34:22,525 --> 01:34:25,191
Oh, your lips look delicious

1776
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:27,628
Well, maybe just a cigarette more

1777
01:34:27,663 --> 01:34:31,165
Never such a pleasure before

1778
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:32,965
I've got to get home

1779
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,736
But, baby, you'll freeze out there

1780
01:34:35,771 --> 01:34:37,536
Say, lend me your comb

1781
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:41,575
It's up to your knees out there

1782
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:43,643
You've really been grand

1783
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,713
I thrill when you touch my hand

1784
01:34:45,748 --> 01:34:47,813
But don't you see

1785
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:51,585
How can you do this thing to me?

1786
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:55,322
There's bound to be talk tomorrow

1787
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:58,491
Think of my lifelong sorrow

1788
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:01,262
At least there will be plenty
implied

1789
01:35:01,297 --> 01:35:04,265
If you caught pneumonia and died

1790
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:05,831
I really can't stay

1791
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:08,335
Get rid of that hold out

1792
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:12,339
Ah, but it's cold

1793
01:35:12,374 --> 01:35:18,073
Outside
