1
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,711
(Motor engine whirring)

2
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:47,913
(Rattling)

3
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,054
(Chickens clucking)

4
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,166
I've just crossed the
iranian border en route
to the habala region

5
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:08,333
where they've
ordered the destruction

6
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,270
of a network of caves
by sundown tonight.

7
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:13,372
I believe that these
caves might contain

8
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,107
a critical missing
piece of our history.

9
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,176
If I'm found dead,

10
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:20,079
please know that I
entered this country
of my own free will,

11
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,047
fully knowing
that the punishment
for trespassing here

12
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,416
is burial up to
your neck in sand

13
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,752
and having a rock wall
pushed on top of you.

14
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:32,024
But they would have
to catch me first.

15
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,127
(Indistinct chattering)

16
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,103
(Knocking on door)

17
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,706
Hurry. Come.

18
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,045
Scarlett.

19
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:55,581
Scarlett: Reza.
Thank you.

20
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,951
If they catch you,
it would be very
bad for you.

21
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,919
Yes, I know, Reza.
We will be quick.

22
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:01,987
Okay.

23
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,292
Here it is.

24
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,229
Reza: Here,
use the ladder.

25
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,530
Okay.
Okay.

26
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,069
(Alarm blaring)

27
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,071
We haven't got
much time.
Scarlett: I know, I know.

28
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:20,439
They have already
cleared the area.

29
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,908
I know, Reza.
Hurry.

30
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,410
Just follow me. Follow.

31
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,213
Come on.

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,484
Watch your step here.
It's fine.
Go, just go.

33
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,753
Yes. Come on.

34
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,523
(Whispering)
Turn off the light.
Turn off the light!

35
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:42,427
Come on. Right this way.

36
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,497
(Man ordering
indistinctly
over loudspeaker)

37
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,774
(Man ordering
continues)

38
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,955
(Siren blaring)

39
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,358
We need to leave.
We are too late.

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,961
No, they are not
blowing the caves up
until sundown.

41
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:19,031
We still have
a few minutes.
We're not leaving.

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,833
Hurry, hurry!

43
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,302
Yes.

44
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:24,369
(Siren continues)

45
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,372
Come on.

46
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,640
Shit.

47
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,976
Reza: There!

48
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,578
Oh, my God!

49
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,979
Oh, my God!

50
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,381
It's even more
beautiful than
in the picture.

51
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,050
Okay.

52
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,118
We must hurry, please.

53
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,554
Okay.

54
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,489
There's more.

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,894
What are you doing?

56
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,663
They're going to
blow it up anyway.

57
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,999
I can't think straight
with this thing on my head.

58
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,774
They will
hear you. Stop!

59
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,142
I just need one minute.

60
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,952
Oh, my God.

61
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,832
(Scarlett exhales)

62
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,368
Scarlett: Oh, my God.

63
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,205
Yeah?
Reza?

64
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,806
Do you know
what this is?
I don't know.

65
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,775
Oh, my God.

66
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,611
It's the rose key.
Oh, Reza.

67
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,712
Careful.

68
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,813
Please hurry.

69
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:42,881
I'll be quick.

70
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,650
Scarlett, stop it.
Come on.

71
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,918
I have to scan
these markings.
I'm not leaving.

72
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,087
We must leave.
Now! I can hear them.

73
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,889
My father searched his
entire life for this.

74
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,591
I can't leave now.
I have to get this.

75
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,493
I'm sorry, Scarlett.
I have a family!

76
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,661
I know. It's okay.

77
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,462
Be careful.
I won't be long.

78
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,830
Be careful!

79
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,933
Scarlett: Come on.
Come on, Scarlett.

80
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,869
(Siren continues)

81
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,506
Shit.

82
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,545
Okay. Okay.

83
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,916
Man: <i> Scarlett.</i>

84
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,252
Hello?

85
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,988
(Siren tempo speeding up)

86
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,190
(Gagging)

87
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,258
<i>Scarlett.</i>

88
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,060
(Explosion)

89
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,600
(Screaming)

90
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,202
(Cave rumbling)

91
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,045
Shit! Oh, God!

92
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,917
Reza! Reza!

93
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,726
Reza! Reza!

94
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:03,895
Scarlett!
Over here! Scarlett!

95
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:04,996
(Scarlett coughing)

96
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,264
Come over!

97
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,567
Come on.

98
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,103
Are you okay, dear?
Are you okay?

99
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,473
Come on.
Give me your hand.

100
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,274
(Scarlett coughing)

101
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,454
I got it! I got it!

102
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,395
You remind me so
much of your father.

103
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,399
But, Scarlett,

104
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,334
you must be more careful.

105
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:43,935
(Dogs barking)

106
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,939
His quest was
a path to madness.

107
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,576
My father wasn't crazy.

108
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:56,281
Everyone who hunts
for flamel's stone
is crazy.

109
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,518
They all wind up dead.

110
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,356
Scarlett: <i> Do I look</i>
<i>in the camera?</i>
Benji: <i> Yeah. Thank you.</i>

111
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,358
<i>That's weird.</i>
(Benji chuckling)

112
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,860
Benji: <i> Um, so, you can start</i>
<i>by introducing yourself.</i>

113
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,295
<i>Right.</i>
(Clears throat)

114
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,696
My name is
Scarlett marlowe

115
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,233
and I'm a Professor
at university college,
London.

116
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,804
I have a ph.D.
In urban archeology,
a master's in chemistry

117
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:21,473
and another ph.D.
In symbology.

118
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:26,745
I'm also fluent in
four spoken languages
and two dead ones.

119
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:31,583
And I am a black
belt in krav maga,
so watch out.

120
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,085
Benji: That's a lot of
degrees for someone
your age.

121
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:38,190
Yeah. My father insisted.
We had a very
studious household.

122
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,026
Excuse me. One second.

123
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,328
(Stammering)

124
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,197
<i>Pardon.
Pardon.</i>

125
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,799
(Speaking French)

126
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,970
<i>Merci.
Merci beaucoup.</i>

127
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,371
Thank you.

128
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,942
You really need
to learn French.

129
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,977
Yeah, I do need
to learn French.
(Chuckles)

130
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,612
Your father.
Yeah.

131
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,482
What did he teach
you about the
philosopher's stone?

132
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:07,252
Everything. That it's
an elusive substance

133
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:10,622
that could turn
base metals into gold

134
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,525
and can provide
the key to eternal life.

135
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:16,595
Sort of crude representation,
but basically

136
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,364
the creation of the stone
was the goal of alchemy

137
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,333
which was an early
form of science

138
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,135
which studied
transformation
in all its forms.

139
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:27,105
And my father was
actually the world's

140
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,174
preeminent
historian in alchemy.

141
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,209
So, your father,
there was a lot
of speculation

142
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,513
that he was
mentally unstable.

143
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,915
Is there any truth
to that?

144
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,120
Why? Because
he killed himself?

145
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,290
Six hundred years ago

146
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,360
the greatest of
the alchemists,
Nicolas flamel

147
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,996
lived here,
in this house in Paris.

148
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,697
He was widely
believed to have
succeeded

149
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,466
in developing
the philosopher's stone

150
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,302
which would have given him
all the wealth
he could dream of

151
00:08:57,304 --> 00:09:00,038
as well as
eternal life.

152
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,473
When grave robbers,
hoping to get

153
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:02,974
their hands on
the philosopher's stone

154
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,843
tried to dig his body up
out of the cemetery

155
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:08,013
that used to
surround this area here

156
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,249
they found his casket empty,
as well as his wife's.

157
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,520
Okay. So this is
Nicolas flamel's tombstone

158
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,089
which he designed
and carved himself.

159
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,824
And my father
believed that the clues

160
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,426
to the location of
the philosopher's stone

161
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:25,564
were encoded somehow
in these arcane symbols.

162
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,066
But their meaning
has remained
a mystery until

163
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,502
I discovered
the fabled rose key.

164
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:32,537
It's a kind of
rosetta stone

165
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,974
used for translating
alchemical symbols
into aramaic

166
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,345
which,
unfortunately,
I don't speak.

167
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,648
But luckily,
I know a guy
who does.

168
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,356
What are you doing?

169
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:54,359
I just have to open
this door quietly.

170
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,097
Benji: Please don't.
Scarlett!

171
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,768
(Door slamming shut)

172
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,806
I can't believe you
just did that. We just
broke into a church!

173
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,041
What does this guy do
all the way up here?

174
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,511
Uh. He likes to, um...

175
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,349
...break into places,
like this

176
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,918
and fix things.

177
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,220
Impressive.
That's a hell of a hobby.

178
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,321
Yeah.

179
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,724
Scarlett:
George? Hello?

180
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:32,364
I saw your bag, George.
I know you're here.

181
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,235
Hi. How are you?

182
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,903
Whatever it is,
I want nothing
to do with it.

183
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,340
I didn't even
say anything.
I'll save you the time. No.

184
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,410
Who's this guy?
Who are you?

185
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,645
I'm Benji.

186
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,447
He's making a
documentary about my
search for the stone.

187
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,517
Ah. Of course.

188
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,820
Do yourself a favor.
Stay far away
from this one.

189
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,156
I just need to
ask you one favor.

190
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,691
George: Yeah. Just one favor.

191
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:04,162
Benji, did she mention
to you, the last time
we were together

192
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,365
I literally wound up
in a turkish prison?

193
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,635
(Chuckling)
George, it was not a prison.
It was more of a jail.

194
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,872
Jail, in Turkey.

195
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,508
George, I'm sorry.

196
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,343
I couldn't let
the lead go dead.

197
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,844
God forbid.

198
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:24,182
Well, chase your lead.
See how far that gets you.

199
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,718
I got a clock to fix.

200
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,722
I found the rose key,
George.

201
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,192
(Chuckling)

202
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,301
You did?
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,236
It was in Iran,
wasn't it?

204
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,772
Yes.

205
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,975
I knew it.

206
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,712
And I need your help
translating the aramaic.

207
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,413
Wait a minute.

208
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,451
Did you go to Iran?

209
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,689
It doesn't matter
who went there, George.
You did, didn't you?

210
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,324
By yourself?

211
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,661
Doesn't matter
who went.

212
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,329
(Chuckles)

213
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,232
You're a lunatic.

214
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,036
She... you're...
(Laughing)

215
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,872
You're a crazy lunatic.

216
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,007
(Gears creaking)

217
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,514
So, you fixed it.

218
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,716
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

219
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,618
Go, go, go. Come on.

220
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,188
Scarlett:
Are you okay, Benji?
Yeah, I'm good.

221
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,590
Okay.

222
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,391
It's about to get
really loud.

223
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,760
Coming? You coming?

224
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,094
Benji:
Yeah, yeah. I'm good.

225
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,096
(Church bells
dinging)

226
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,364
Shit.

227
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,543
(Bell tolling)

228
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,147
(Chuckling)

229
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,383
Look at them.

230
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,885
George: Hearing their
church bells ring

231
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,454
for the first
time in 284 years.

232
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,629
I'll help you
translate.

233
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,564
But that's it.

234
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,002
(Indistinct chattering)

235
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,743
She's pretty.

236
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,813
Benji:
Yeah, she's really pretty.
She's got great legs, too.

237
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,082
She said we can have
10 minutes. That's it.

238
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,350
Okay.

239
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,621
How do you know her?

240
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,857
Professional circles.

241
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,193
Star is ammonia.

242
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,428
Okay, great.
Star is ammonia.
Is this making any sense?

243
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,363
Just keep going.
Just keep them going.

244
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,666
Lime.

245
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,100
Sword is lime?
Sword is lime.

246
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,669
Okay. And what about
the key?

247
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,103
Uh...

248
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,307
No key.

249
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,875
There's no key?
No.

250
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,844
Why is there no key?

251
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,348
He's carrying
the key on his back.
Look.

252
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,985
So, if he's carrying
the key on his back,

253
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:17,121
does that mean that
the key is on his back?

254
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,457
It's on the back
of the tombstone.
Scarlett. No.

255
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,692
I need to have
a look behind here.

256
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,227
Scarlett, no!
Come on!

257
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,062
I need you
to help me.
Okay! Shit!

258
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,864
Be careful. Let me...
I need to see
the back.

259
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,233
Okay. I can't...
Watch your foot.

260
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,468
We're gonna
have to put it down
because I can't see.

261
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,404
Shit.

262
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,683
There's nothing there.

263
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:46,985
I can see that.

264
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:50,388
Ammonia sulfonate,
distilled, with lime.

265
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,894
It's the mix of
a couple of basic
cleaning products.

266
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,662
Help me out
here, man.

267
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,730
Benji:
What are you doing?

268
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,834
Okay. You don't want
to breathe this in.

269
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,503
Benji: This is not
gonna end well.

270
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,705
It's on the back.
They will never see it.

271
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,574
George: Oh, my God.

272
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,010
And I need some matches.

273
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,411
Matches? No. No.

274
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,246
Benji: We're not burning that.
Benji, give me
your matches.

275
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,448
Scarlett, this is a museum!
Are you out of your...
Shut up!

276
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,917
Shit!

277
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,254
George: Oh, my God!
This is not okay!

278
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,128
Benji: Wow!

279
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,963
George: Okay,
that's pretty cool.

280
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,702
That's not
"go to jail" cool.
But that's really cool.

281
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,871
Wow.

282
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,406
Get your camera.

283
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,742
"Winged vulture
leads the way

284
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:49,047
"with brightest
light in darkest day.

285
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:52,817
"Underneath the
heaven's reign

286
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,886
"what is lost
shall be regained.

287
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:59,557
"Halfway twixt
the darkest gate

288
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,761
"and this tablet laid
atop a pairèd fate."

289
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,296
So, "underneath
the heaven's reign,

290
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,898
"what is lost
shall be regained."

291
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,399
"What is lost
shall be regained."

292
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,903
So that is,
underneath the night sky

293
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:15,173
or in the open?

294
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,343
Or on the tablet.
There's a night sky
right on the tablet.

295
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,444
Yes, good. Okay.

296
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,980
So, darkest gate.

297
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,684
Hell. Hell.
Darkest gate,
the gates of hell.

298
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:27,919
The gates of hell.
Right?

299
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,254
Yeah.
The gates of hell.

300
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,256
Okay, but that
doesn't give us anything.

301
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:36,260
I mean, that's halfway
between this grave
and the gates of hell.

302
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,930
No, wait.
I have my dad's
notebook.

303
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,533
Oh, my God. Okay.

304
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,103
So this marks what
they believe to be

305
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,472
the distance
between heaven
and earth and hell.

306
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:51,142
If alchemists believed
that the number of
the devil was 741

307
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:54,946
then it makes sense
that they would think
that hell was 741 feet

308
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:57,448
beneath the surface
of the earth, right?
So halfway twixt...

309
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,152
So, 370.5 feet
beneath flamel's
tombstone

310
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,954
is where we'll
find the stone!

311
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,222
Benji: Wait.
Hold on, guys.
How are we

312
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,791
supposed to get 370
feet into the earth?

313
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,660
The catacombs. Right?

314
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:10,895
Benji: The what?

315
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,132
Okay, we're in Paris, so

316
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:18,002
there are over
200 Miles of tunnels
right underneath our feet.

317
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,572
That are holding
the remains of six
million corpses.

318
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,808
Benji: Whoa, whoa.
Six million corpses?
Yeah.

319
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,143
That's where I would put it!

320
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,911
Right. Of course
you would.

321
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,146
Flamel's grave was here.

322
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:32,884
With the catacomb map,
would make it roughly...

323
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,319
There. Shit.

324
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,821
Wait. Are you sure?

325
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,190
Benji: What is it?
What happened?
Shit!

326
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,492
Catacombs don't go
under flamel's grave.

327
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:45,096
But if we burrowed
through this wall here...

328
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,664
No, you can't.
In this tunnel...

329
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,234
The walls are solid
limestone. There's no way
you can burrow in.

330
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,669
Plus, they've all
been reinforced

331
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,738
since pieces of
the city fell into the...

332
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,872
Well then...

333
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,607
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

334
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,676
In 1774,

335
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:02,346
about a hundred feet
of Avenue denfert-rochereau

336
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,850
was literally swallowed
up into the ground
by the city.

337
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,553
A couple of years later,
the same thing happened...

338
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,388
Barrière d'enfer,
right there.

339
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,957
Followed by
a third collapse.

340
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,628
Rue des innocents.

341
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,630
Benji: Why would
the street collapse
if there's nothing

342
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,699
but solid
ground underneath it?

343
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,568
That's a good
question, Benji.

344
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,204
So there's
a hidden chamber?

345
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,972
It would appear so.

346
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,207
We have to
get down there.

347
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,142
You have to
get down there.

348
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,711
I don't go underground.
Remember?

349
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:35,947
Yes.

350
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:37,982
Sorry.

351
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,151
By the end
of the 1700s,

352
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,654
residents from
all over Paris
began to complain

353
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:48,426
about the horrible
smell of the bodies
in the overcrowded cemetery.

354
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,394
Something had to be done.

355
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,463
Benji, get this.

356
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,235
(Scarlett reading)

357
00:18:57,237 --> 00:19:00,571
"Stop. This is
the empire of the dead."

358
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:04,342
Wait, check out
the patterns and crosses
that they made.

359
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,409
It's beautiful.

360
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,744
Tour guide:
Six million bodies,

361
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,747
almost three times
the population of Paris

362
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,449
are housed
in these quarries.

363
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:15,086
Making it, by far,
the largest crypt
in the world.

364
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,755
Benji:
Seriously, Scarlett,
this is creeping me out.

365
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:18,823
(Scarlett giggles)

366
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,092
Get this.

367
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:24,162
(Scarlett reading)

368
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,933
"At the sound of
the trumpet,
the dead will rise."

369
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:32,603
Benji, here.
Cimetière des innocents.

370
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:36,040
These remains are
from the same cemetery
as the flamel graves.

371
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:39,510
Which means that...

372
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,784
Yeah, we basically
need to go

373
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,487
about half a mile
through this wall.

374
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:53,824
We need to find a way
into the off-limits
area of the catacombs.

375
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,827
Man: Go to the club
called le showcase.

376
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,196
Sorry?

377
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,334
Ask for papillon.
He'll bring you.

378
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,468
Benji: Papillon?

379
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,636
Tour guide: Please!
Thanks.

380
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:08,472
Come back into the group.
Please. Come on.

381
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,807
Sorry.

382
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,683
Are you sure
this is where
we're supposed to go?

383
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,085
Yeah, I think it's...

384
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,853
I think it's just
down here.

385
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,255
What's his name again?
Papillon.

386
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,823
Papillon?
Yeah.

387
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:26,891
Okay.

388
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,760
(Electronic music playing)

389
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,028
Papillon?

390
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,465
(Scarlett
speaking French)

391
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,851
(Speaking French)

392
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,654
(Speaking French)

393
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,808
(Speaking French)

394
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:20,878
Yes, what do you want?

395
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
I need to get
into the catacombs

396
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,616
and someone told me
that you could take me.

397
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,718
(Laughing)

398
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
No, sorry. Do I look
like a tour guide to you?

399
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,323
Do I look
like a tourist?

400
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,961
Okay, why would I want
to bring you down there?

401
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,666
Because we have
found a secret tunnel

402
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:45,202
in the catacombs
that no one else
knows about.

403
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,738
Look.

404
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,941
No. I know that place.
We would have found
it if it was there.

405
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,443
No, you wouldn't have.
Yes, we would.

406
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:55,346
No, you wouldn't have,
because it was designed,

407
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:58,015
years and years ago,
to be invisible.

408
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,751
Unless you knew
it was there, you would
never find it.

409
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,254
Why would that be?

410
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:07,958
Because I believe it's
filled with treasure.

411
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,126
You know what I mean?

412
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:11,329
Treasure,
yeah, I know what you mean.
(Laughing)

413
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,999
It's a joke.
I mean, is she serious?

414
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,502
I'm 100% serious.

415
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,705
If it's true,

416
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:23,808
me and my friends,
can we take half
of the treasure?

417
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,843
You can have all
of the treasure.

418
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,144
It's not what
I'm looking for.

419
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,779
Half is fine.

420
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,181
Okay.

421
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,950
So you'll take us?

422
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,485
Yes, I said okay.

423
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,786
Try this.

424
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:39,156
No, I'm sorry,
I'm not going.

425
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,524
No, he's coming.
He's coming.

426
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,792
I'm not coming.

427
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,061
George, come on, please.
I need your help.

428
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,629
You can text me
whatever you find

429
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,064
down there.
I'm gonna be around...

430
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,899
No. You can't.

431
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,836
No cell phones down there.
The ground is too dense.

432
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,137
(Man cheering)
We are so close.

433
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,472
I know.

434
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,073
You know there's
something there.

435
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:59,377
Guys, meet my team.
This is zed, our climber.

436
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:03,214
And this is souxie,
the banshee.
Hi. <i> Ça va?</i>

437
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,052
Souxie, the banshee.
(Papillon arguing in French)

438
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,391
Okay.
Okay.

439
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,693
Then we go near
<i>LA plage.</i>
Okay.

440
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:17,161
And then
it's a bit tricky.

441
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:18,829
Papillon:
There's water to here.

442
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,365
And we're prepared
for that? We have
enough equipment?

443
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,666
Yeah, we got
everything.

444
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,735
Benji: Zed, right?
How do you know
papillon?

445
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:30,107
Oh, I grew up with him.
He's my friend, you know.

446
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,677
Do you know how
he got the scar
on his hand?

447
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,515
Don't talk about
that to him.

448
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:43,120
Souxie, what are the dangers
that we're facing
when we go down there?

449
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,958
If you run out
of batteries,
with no flashlight,

450
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,527
you will die.

451
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:53,631
If you run out of water,
if you get hurt.

452
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:57,368
Zed: And there are
also dangers like
police and bats,

453
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,704
rats, claustrophobia,
drowning, bugs.

454
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,039
Yeah.

455
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,542
De niro?
You want to see de niro?
Yes, yes.

456
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:06,177
Papillon: Don't do it.

457
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,245
Souxie: No. He's bad.

458
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,614
Let me do de niro.

459
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,552
Fuck, man. Fuck.

460
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:17,788
Just like that!
(Laughing)

461
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,624
(Beat playing)

462
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,626
(Imitating beat)

463
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,497
You're up.

464
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,765
Zed: (Singing)
<i>Hey, yo, hey, yo...</i>

465
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,733
Listen to that.

466
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,735
No. And it's over.
Do it like that.

467
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,337
Three seconds.
You suck.
(All laughing)

468
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:38,242
Guys, when we leave
the van, we need to
be quick, okay?

469
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:42,079
Because if the police
catch us with all that
stuff, we're fucked.

470
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,747
Okay?
Benji: Okay.

471
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,251
George: I'll walk
you guys down there
but then I'm out.

472
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,353
Papillon: Quick, quick.
Souxie: Go, go, go.

473
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,532
Papillon: Okay, souxie.

474
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,767
Okay, make it quick,
make it quick.
Okay?

475
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,577
Papillon: Okay, wait.

476
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,780
Papillon: Zed?
Yeah.

477
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,855
(Souxie speaking French)
Benji: Can we keep going?

478
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,958
Zed: Congratulations.
Okay.

479
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,196
Okay. Now, we should
put our headlamps on.

480
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,137
Let's go.

481
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:41,305
Okay?

482
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:42,506
Can you check
if mine is on?

483
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:43,974
Where's yours?

484
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,710
George:
I'm not coming with you guys.
I told you a bunch of times.

485
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,811
Papillon: Okay.

486
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,481
I'm leaving you
guys in a second.

487
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:52,550
Scarlett:
Just give it a minute.

488
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,985
Papillon: Here we are.

489
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,353
This is it.
Where?

490
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,322
There?
There.

491
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:00,257
George: That's
the hole that
you're going into?

492
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,425
Papillon: Yeah.
That's it?

493
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,227
Souxie:
It's not a joke.

494
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,063
Okay.

495
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,164
George: Wow.

496
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,166
Let's do it.

497
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,435
Benji: All right. Look,
before we go down there,

498
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:15,606
I have installed pin-cams
on some of your headlamps.
Hold on.

499
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:18,075
Camera b, good, check.

500
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,444
All right.

501
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:25,616
All right, camera c, check.

502
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:26,684
Let's go.

503
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,953
What's this?
Good luck.

504
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:32,389
Scarlett, I'm not...
I shouldn't have
even come this far.

505
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:35,125
Please, I need you
with me.
I'm not. I'm sorry.

506
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,293
Souxie: Okay?

507
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,030
Are you sure you're
not gonna regret this?
Good luck.

508
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,732
Okay.

509
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,101
Listen, I don't know
what you do

510
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,136
but you make up
your mind now. Okay?

511
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,371
He's coming,
he's coming.

512
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,439
I'm not going.

513
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:54,311
(Policeman ordering
in French)

514
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,047
Scarlett:
George! Come on!

515
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,049
George!

516
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,584
Zed: Watch your head,
watch your head!

517
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,721
Scarlett: Quickly!
Fucking Christ!
Are you out of your mind?

518
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:06,123
(Frantic chattering)

519
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:13,063
Papillon:
Smoke bomb, look out!
Go! Go! Go!

520
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:14,732
Watch out!

521
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,333
Go back! Go, go, go!

522
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,405
(Smoke bomb detonating)
Quiet!

523
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,808
Papillon: You okay?

524
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,644
(All coughing)

525
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,583
Let us make sure
it's clear, okay?
Zed, souxie.

526
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:33,651
George.

527
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,819
You stay! You stay!

528
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,188
Benji: George.
What?

529
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,858
I have a headlamp
for you. Come here.

530
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,259
Okay.

531
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,627
Scarlett: Let me just...

532
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,262
Scarlett, I got it!
I got it!

533
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,432
I gotta turn it on.
Hold on.

534
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:51,869
All right.
Camera d, good, check.

535
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:54,938
Thank you.
You really don't
like caves, do you?

536
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,473
Is this working?
Yeah.

537
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,609
Okay. Thank you, Benji.

538
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,445
What did I say?

539
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:03,947
His little brother
drowned in a cave
when they were young.

540
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:04,982
Shit.

541
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:06,483
You didn't know.
It's fine.

542
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:07,618
All right.

543
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,321
Scarlett: George,

544
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,724
are you all right?

545
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:15,225
(Breathes heavily)
I will be.

546
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,727
Yeah.

547
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,298
You never returned
my calls after Turkey.

548
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
I know.

549
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:26,737
I just wanted to say
that I'm really sorry

550
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,806
for leaving you there.

551
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,240
I know.

552
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,644
Hey.
What?

553
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,314
I'm really glad
that you're here.

554
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,517
I don't care. I'm not
here for you, Scarlett.

555
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,820
I agreed to be your
translator, that's it.

556
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:45,656
I know.
I didn't wanna
come down here.

557
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,327
But here I am.
I'm sorry.

558
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,495
George!

559
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:54,031
Papillon: The police
will never catch papillon.

560
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,399
Okay, let's go.

561
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,436
George.

562
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:00,738
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

563
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,243
That's me,
the classic "pap."

564
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,279
Nice.

565
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,754
We go through here.

566
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,057
Follow me, Benji.

567
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,258
Benji: Right.

568
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,362
Benji: Okay?

569
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,365
I probably should
have worn boots.

570
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,700
Papillon: I offered
you some.

571
00:29:29,702 --> 00:29:31,368
Fuck.

572
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,370
It gets higher up here.
You'll be fine.

573
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:34,438
Okay.

574
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,642
How deep do
you think we are?

575
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,144
Souxie: It's okay?

576
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:42,146
Scarlett: Right.
So where are we?

577
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,717
There.
I make us there.

578
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,720
George?

579
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,822
You good?

580
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:53,824
(Clears throat)

581
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,893
You got something
for your camera
to go in water?

582
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,494
Benji: Yeah. I'm all set.
Yeah, he's got
a splash bag.

583
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:58,562
Okay.

584
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,300
It's going to
get deeper.

585
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,074
Rue bezout.

586
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:14,411
And there's a really
cool room in the other
side, but...

587
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:17,114
Scarlett: But you have to
swim through it.
We're not going to go.

588
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:18,582
Not this time.

589
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,584
Maybe another time.

590
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,587
Okay. This is the end.

591
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,590
Benji: You good?

592
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,492
This place is crazy.

593
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,363
That's hot candles.
There's people in here.

594
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,604
Come on.

595
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:41,672
(Chanting)

596
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,552
There is always
some weird peoples
down here.

597
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,387
Benji: You're not kidding.

598
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,695
Shit!

599
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,967
Papillon: Okay.

600
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,835
We go through here.

601
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,303
Really?

602
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:16,707
And I suggest
you pull your
hands up like this

603
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,309
so these bones
don't cut.

604
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:22,179
Benji: No, no. We're not
going through there.

605
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,647
Yes, it's the only way.

606
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:27,251
Fuck that, man.
I'm not climbing
over bones.

607
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,919
George: That's a great
tour guide you got.

608
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,687
What did you say?

609
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:35,058
If you need a tour guide,
you get a tour guide who say,

610
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,593
"look over here,
look over there"

611
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,195
and everything.
But that's not me.

612
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,430
If you want to find
your hidden treasure,
that's the way.

613
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:43,700
Wait. Papillon, look.
That isn't actually
the right way.

614
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,936
This one here.
This is a much
more direct route.

615
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:48,505
Sometimes the wrong
direction is better.
No.

616
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,674
Nobody uses
this corridor.
Why not?

617
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:52,776
It's a bad place.

618
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:56,280
What do you mean,
it's a bad place?
Is it dangerous or...

619
00:31:56,282 --> 00:32:00,717
Bad like, people
who go in this tunnel
don't come out.

620
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:03,921
We're talking about
some kind of urban
legend or something.

621
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,889
This could save us
hours upon hours.

622
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:08,292
You think because
you see something
in a book, you know it?

623
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,027
Just look at
the map, here.

624
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:12,296
Okay, this?
This is not
the catacombs.

625
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,598
This will not
tell you anything.

626
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,134
Tell me, which ones
are filled with water?

627
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:20,304
Which ones have collapsed?
Which ones are evil?

628
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:22,806
You don't need
to be yelling.
You don't know!

629
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,474
We had a friend
named LA taupe.

630
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,610
In English, <i> "LA taupe"</i>
<i>c'est</i> "the mole."

631
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,580
He lived down here
for years.

632
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:33,917
He knew every
corridor of every system,
except this one.

633
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,421
He knew there was
something horrible
down there.

634
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:40,390
But eventually,
he had to see
what it was.

635
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,826
He went inside
and nobody has
seen him since.

636
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,162
So if you want
to take this way,

637
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:47,097
go ahead.
Not with me.

638
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,832
Or me.

639
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,735
It's the best way.

640
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,906
These people have
been here before.

641
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:57,307
We haven't.

642
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:02,412
If that rock is down here,
then it's been down
here for 600 years.

643
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,748
I think it can wait
a couple more hours.

644
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,917
Benji:
These are human bones!

645
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,285
I know.

646
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:09,987
Benji, nobody
wants to do this.
And you're cool with this?

647
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,288
I'm sorry,
Benji, I really am.

648
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,522
Let's go. Let's just go.

649
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,959
Okay, look at zed.

650
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:19,963
And use, like him,
all your legs and arms

651
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,264
because there
is rats under...

652
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,633
Benji: Are you fucking
serious, man?
No, no, no...

653
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,569
First bones, now rats?

654
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,305
(Zed shouting)

655
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,340
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

656
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,744
(Laughing)
I'm just fucking kidding!

657
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:37,180
Benji: That's fucked up,
man! Asshole.

658
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,615
Benji: I'm right behind you.

659
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:39,883
Scarlett: It's actually
not too bad.

660
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,518
Benji: Let's do this.

661
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,388
Scarlett: Give me that.
Mind your feet.

662
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,658
Scarlett:
Just keep it slow
and steady, yeah?

663
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,260
Watch your head.

664
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,763
Fuck!

665
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:01,705
(Panting)

666
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,377
Scarlett: Are you all right?

667
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,115
No, no.
I think I'm stuck.

668
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,217
I can't see you.

669
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,054
George: Benji!
Piece of shit bag.

670
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,555
You okay, buddy?

671
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,057
Okay. Fuck.

672
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,892
Just move
your shoulder down.
No, no, no.

673
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,160
I'm stuck.

674
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:25,996
Just move back, Benji.
I'm stuck. Fuck!

675
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:27,531
Just calm down.
It's okay.

676
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,599
No, no.
I can't breathe.

677
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,034
No, it's okay.
Benji, you can.

678
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:34,237
Look, you should go.
Just keep going, please!

679
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,239
Fuck. Fuck!

680
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,375
You have to move back!
No, just go, God damn it!

681
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:39,576
Move back a bit, please.

682
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,844
God! Why are
they singing?

683
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:42,512
Why are they
singing this fucking song?

684
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,247
Just tell them to
shut the fuck up!

685
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,084
You're gonna
have to calm down,
okay, Benji?

686
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,185
Fuck! Fuck!

687
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:50,053
Benji, just calm down,
okay?

688
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:52,923
Just breathe
with me, please.
It's okay.

689
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,292
Scarlett,
you gotta get
out of the way.

690
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:58,095
Just get out of the way.
Just get out of
the fucking way!

691
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,363
You are gonna
have to move back
a tiny bit, please.

692
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,866
I can't move back.
Just go forward!

693
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:04,701
Just a tiny bit.
Go forward!

694
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:07,104
You have to
flatten out the bones.
Benji, calm down.

695
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,405
Fuck! Shit!

696
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:11,475
I think something bit me.
Something bit me! Fuck!

697
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,443
Benji, just breathe!

698
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,078
Benji,
just listen to my voice.

699
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,746
Okay. Okay. Okay.

700
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,416
Just breathe, please.
You need to calm down.

701
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:22,052
You are
hyperventilating,
okay?

702
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:24,054
You will be all right.
We just need to
take it slowly.

703
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:25,422
(Distant chanting)

704
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:29,159
Now, breathe with me.
Just breathe with me, okay?

705
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:33,063
Fuck! Fuck!
(Groans)

706
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:35,632
Just line up the bones.

707
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,268
You will be all right.
Just keep coming.

708
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,238
Just move them
out of the way.
Good, good, good.

709
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,940
Well done. Keep coming.
And now move forward.

710
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:47,244
Just inch yourself forward.
Well done.

711
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,746
There we go,
keep coming.
Shit!

712
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,181
Keep going.

713
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,016
Shit!

714
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,117
George: What was that?

715
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,153
Fuck. I think
it's gonna collapse!

716
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:57,254
Go!

717
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:58,321
(Tunnel rumbling)

718
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,625
Grab the fucking camera!
Grab it!

719
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,360
Just grab the fucking camera!

720
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:06,196
Hurry! Keep coming!
Quickly!

721
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,065
Fuck!

722
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,336
(Frantic chattering)

723
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,208
Scarlett: Benji!

724
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,743
Souxie: Is he okay?

725
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,279
Benji: Fuck!

726
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,081
(Scarlett coughing)

727
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,285
Fuck.

728
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,123
It's collapsed.

729
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,425
That was so
fucking close.

730
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,297
Oh, my God.

731
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:41,898
Wait.

732
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,966
Fuck.

733
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:47,837
Scarlett: Wait.
Tell me we didn't just
go in a circle.

734
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:48,972
This isn't here.

735
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,807
This is the same
tunnel, no?

736
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,677
Papillon:
This isn't here.
Believe me. No, no, no.

737
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,912
Look, I thought
you said you knew
where we were going!

738
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,581
Wait. Listen to me.

739
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,252
Hey, hey, hey,
Benji! Stop it!

740
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:05,522
Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
Benji, I'm sorry!

741
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:09,259
Calm down!
But listen to me.
This doesn't go here.

742
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,760
Okay, calm down.
This is the tunnel.

743
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,830
There is no turns.
There is no turns.

744
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,566
This is straight.

745
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:18,668
I don't understand.

746
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,937
Benji: What the hell
do we do now, huh?

747
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,380
This is all right.
Okay.

748
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:32,182
Papillon:
We shouldn't
go this way.

749
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:33,216
Zed: Let's go,
grab your shit.

750
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,451
Papillon:
We shouldn't go in there!

751
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:35,952
George:
There's no other option.

752
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:39,556
Are you all right,
Benji? Let me help.
Let me help.

753
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:40,757
Benji: Okay.

754
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,130
Souxie: Okay.

755
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,106
What the hell
is this?

756
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,210
Great. Very funny.
So you have never
been here before.

757
00:38:00,212 --> 00:38:01,578
No.

758
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,046
(Souxie speaking French)

759
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:04,414
I've never
been here, okay?

760
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,582
What the hell
is this, then?

761
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,984
People just tag
your name on the wall?

762
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,819
I swear I've never
been here.

763
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,054
I didn't do this,
okay?

764
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,222
Who did it, then?

765
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,658
I don't know.
I don't know.
For goodness' sake.

766
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,993
You better not be
fucking with us.

767
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:19,029
(Phone ringing)

768
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,668
George:
Did you hear that?

769
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,736
Is that a phone?

770
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,271
Are there phones down here?

771
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:31,574
The phone company used to
run lines through here,
but they...

772
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:32,642
Run lines through here?

773
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,144
Yeah.

774
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,345
They must have left some.

775
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:36,680
No.

776
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:39,683
Fifty years ago,
they took everything.

777
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:41,151
(Phone ringing)

778
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,755
Go.
This is wrong.

779
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,028
Scarlett! Scarlett!

780
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:56,299
Barrière d'enfer.
This is the spot
I was talking about.

781
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,335
This is where the buildings
collapsed into the ground.

782
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,270
Hundreds of people

783
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:03,073
fell to their
death right here.

784
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,008
Yes.

785
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,978
And when they sent
people to fix it,

786
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,247
50 more disappeared.

787
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:21,191
How the hell did they
get a piano down here?

788
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:24,260
Benji: Maybe it
fell when one of
the houses collapsed.

789
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,897
You gotta
be kidding.

790
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,870
When I was a kid,
we had a piano that
looked exactly like this.

791
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,338
Really?

792
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,174
Danny and I used to
play it all the time.
We only knew one song.

793
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,909
<i>My Bonnie lies
over the ocean.</i>

794
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,847
You remember that song?

795
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:47,751
We could never finish it
because the a4 key
was fucked up.

796
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,488
George...

797
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,056
This is a trip.

798
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,959
(Notes playing)

799
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,065
(No sound)

800
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,404
(Continues to make
no sound)

801
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,140
What's going on?

802
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,009
I told you.

803
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,077
We shouldn't be here.

804
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,512
We should
keep going.
Guys, no.

805
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:17,180
We should keep moving.

806
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,785
(Phone ringing)

807
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,394
Fuck that. I'm going.

808
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,595
Benji: Scarlett!

809
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,033
Scarlett!

810
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,971
(Phone continues ringing)

811
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,840
It's coming from
down here.

812
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,276
Papillon: Wait, wait!

813
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:47,544
Scarlett!

814
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:48,778
Benji: Hold up,
Scarlett!

815
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,289
(Ringing gets louder)

816
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,690
Papillon: Scarlett!

817
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,492
Wait.

818
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,332
(Ringing continues)

819
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:25,949
Man: <i> Why won't you</i>
<i>talk to me, Scarlett?</i>

820
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:27,116
George: Scarlett, hang up.

821
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,184
Who is this?

822
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,652
George: Hang up the phone,
Scarlett.

823
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,455
<i>Tell me.
Why won't you talk to me?</i>

824
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,324
Who is this?

825
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,928
(Man groaning)

826
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,301
Scarlett...
Man: You shouldn't
be here.

827
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:47,337
(All gasping)

828
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,274
Scarlett: Who is that?

829
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:52,675
Souxie:
LA taupe, <i> c'est toi?</i>

830
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,280
You shouldn't
be here, souxie.

831
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:58,314
LA taupe?

832
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,717
None of you
should be here.

833
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,685
LA taupe.
(Speaking French)

834
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:03,786
Scarlett:
That's LA taupe?

835
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,255
I thought you were dead.

836
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,959
You never even
came to look for me.

837
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,394
Never.

838
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,196
LA taupe...

839
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,398
Never.

840
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,933
LA taupe.

841
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,968
You're okay?

842
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,671
Come.

843
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:22,872
Where? Wait.

844
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,341
He doesn't know
where we're going.

845
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,877
You are looking
to get out.

846
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,546
Scarlett: Yes. Yes.

847
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,981
Come.

848
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,752
Benji, wait for them.

849
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:37,487
Let him go first.
Benji: How did he get
up there so fast?

850
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:38,521
George: Zed?
Yeah.

851
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:39,722
Is that the guy
that you were saying...

852
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,025
Disappeared
two years ago? Yes.

853
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:44,661
(Rumbling and cracking)
George: Jesus, Jesus.

854
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:47,263
Okay.
George: Is that bad?
Is that bad?

855
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:48,364
It looks bad.

856
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,900
We shouldn't stay
very long.

857
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,235
That is bad.

858
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,671
Quickly, guys.
Wait. Where did he go?

859
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:55,738
Come on.

860
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,173
Are you okay?

861
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,241
Go, just go!

862
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,076
Let's go! Let's go!

863
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,210
Papillon:
LA taupe! Wait!

864
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:02,645
LA taupe?

865
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:06,282
Papillon:
Everybody's here?

866
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,654
Careful.

867
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,262
(Panting)

868
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,433
Where is he?

869
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,369
Here.
Okay.

870
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:28,805
How can he
see down here?

871
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,944
The only way out
is down.

872
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:37,847
Benji: What?

873
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,455
Scarlett: Careful, Benji.

874
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,657
Careful.

875
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,306
Silent, silent.

876
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,211
(Rock hits bottom)

877
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,813
It looks deep.

878
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,517
This is a bad idea.

879
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:17,079
Scarlett: This space that
we're looking for,
the hidden chamber...

880
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,624
Didn't you notice
that it was perfectly
wedged

881
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:26,329
between the east system
and the South system
of the catacombs?

882
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:27,530
George: So it's got
to connect them.

883
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:32,435
If we find the chamber,
then that's the way out.
We'll find a way out.

884
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:33,469
Souxie:
Are you sure?

885
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:35,438
I think. I'm sure.

886
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,939
George:
What if there's
no chamber?

887
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:39,709
There is.
It's down there.

888
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,445
Okay.

889
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:45,314
Scarlett: George,
it's another 20 meters.

890
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:46,382
Are you at the bottom?

891
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:48,184
Yeah.

892
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,853
Okay. I'll be down
in a second.

893
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,890
Benji? You good?

894
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:55,291
Scarlett:
Benji, you can start now.

895
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,592
All right, good.

896
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,698
George: Fucking harness.

897
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,199
You okay, Benji, up there?

898
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,300
Okay.

899
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,202
Come on, George,
keep coming.

900
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:09,138
Hold on. I'm stuck. Shit!

901
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,907
Benji, watch out!
(Benji screaming)

902
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,711
(Benji screaming)
Fuck! Shit!

903
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,212
Fuck! My hands!

904
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,147
Benji, what happened?
I don't know!

905
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:19,916
Benji,
are you okay?
My hands.

906
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:22,485
No. Oh, my God.
The clip broke.

907
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:24,053
What? How?

908
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,755
I don't know!

909
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,727
I got you. I got you.

910
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:34,197
Fresh bandages in
one of the packs.

911
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,765
Just let me know
if you want me
to change them.

912
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:36,933
All right, let's go.

913
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:38,101
George: Guys?

914
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,370
Yeah. We're going,
we're good.

915
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:43,573
All good?
Sort of.

916
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,975
His hands are
still bleeding.

917
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,045
So I bandaged them up.

918
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:50,947
Is he getting any...

919
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,084
(Muffled)
Are you all right?

920
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,653
George?

921
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,256
Scarlett!

922
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,924
What?

923
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:08,631
(Muffled banging)

924
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,935
(Inaudible)

925
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,208
I can't hear...

926
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,610
(Loud rumbling)

927
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,452
(Alarm blaring)

928
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,888
(All exclaiming)

929
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,295
(Screeching)

930
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,299
Scarlett: (Exclaiming)
You all right?

931
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,735
Everyone?
Yeah!

932
00:46:45,737 --> 00:46:47,136
You okay?

933
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,406
Zed: Are you okay?
What was that?

934
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,242
LA taupe: The question is
not what was that,

935
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:54,744
but who was that.

936
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:56,646
What the fuck
does he mean by that?

937
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:57,914
What did he say?

938
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:01,217
Papillon, how long
have you known
this guy?

939
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,086
He's different now.

940
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:06,222
Should we be
following him?

941
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,524
I don't know.

942
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:09,759
There seems to
be a right turn.

943
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:10,927
Souxie:
There is a door!

944
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,361
Come here,
come here.
A door!

945
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:13,496
Benji.

946
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,131
George: Thank God!

947
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,365
Scarlett:
Watch your head, Benji.

948
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:17,567
Come on.

949
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,804
Shit! It's a dead end!

950
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:23,706
You said this
is the way.

951
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,508
I thought it was
the way, too.

952
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,609
Yeah?

953
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:30,179
(Papillon yelling
in French)

954
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,380
(Speaking French)

955
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:34,984
Scarlett: Hey.
Everyone calm down!

956
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:36,686
George: Calm down.

957
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,621
We can't go back.

958
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:40,356
Scarlett.
Yeah. What?

959
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,557
Come here.

960
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,426
Oh, my God!

961
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,464
"Winged vulture
leads your way..."

962
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:49,999
"With brightest
light in darkest day."

963
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:53,135
Leads your way.
So this is...

964
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:54,537
Leads your way.

965
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,373
Watch out. Watch out.

966
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,810
There's something here!
What?

967
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:03,713
Is that a scarab?
Is that a scarab?

968
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,515
Scarab.

969
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,718
Egyptians, pyramids.

970
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,152
Pharaohs. Pharaohs.

971
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:11,520
Pharaohs. Pharaohs.

972
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:15,424
Didn't pharaohs
have a strange way
of hiding the tombs?

973
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:18,261
Yes! Yes!
A ptolemaic hinge!

974
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:20,696
I have never seen...
Could this be...

975
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:22,164
One second,
can you just explain?

976
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,866
What are you talking about?
What's a ptolemaic?

977
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:26,936
Ptolemaic hinge.
Basically, they form
a kind of riddle.

978
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:30,706
It's a sort of
ancient Egyptian padlock.

979
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,608
So you have to
take the exact
right stone

980
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,443
from the exact
right place, or...

981
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:36,078
Or what?

982
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,347
Or what?

983
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:42,385
Or the ceiling
will collapse on you
and kill you.

984
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:44,186
Papillon: What?
Are you kidding?

985
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:45,788
Benji: You have
to be shitting me!

986
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:46,856
It's fine. It's okay.

987
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:48,057
"Underneath heaven's reign."

988
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:51,460
What does it say on the tomb?
Underneath heaven's reign.

989
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:52,862
Underneath heaven's reign.

990
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:56,032
Celestial spheres.
The celestial spheres!
Eight planets, right?

991
00:48:56,034 --> 00:48:57,867
Wait, wait, wait.

992
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,936
But the last two
weren't discovered yet.

993
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:01,637
Okay, so 6 planets.
6 planets.

994
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:03,706
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Wait, wait, wait.

995
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,308
Scarlett. Scarlett!
Yes. What?

996
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,575
Don't touch anything.

997
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:09,045
Was this built before
or after copernicus?

998
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:12,048
So, they still believed
everything revolved
around the earth.

999
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,549
Which means the earth
didn't count as a planet.

1000
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:14,951
Right. But the moon did.

1001
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:17,653
And so did the sun.
So, 7 planets, right?

1002
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,488
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

1003
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,556
Be sure.
7.

1004
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,591
That's my count.
7.

1005
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,460
Stand way the fuck back.

1006
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,895
Watch out!
It's moving!

1007
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:27,330
Shit! Okay.

1008
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:29,799
(Straining)

1009
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,634
Be careful!

1010
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,536
It's fucking heavy!

1011
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:35,871
Okay, it's moving!

1012
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,141
Watch out!
Okay. Okay!

1013
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,845
Benji: Careful!
Scarlett: Shit!

1014
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:44,313
(Rumbling)

1015
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,715
Oh, my God!

1016
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:50,920
Benji: Shit!
You okay?

1017
00:49:50,922 --> 00:49:52,421
Benji: What is that?
What is that?

1018
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,424
Oh, my God!

1019
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,095
George, this is
the first time someone

1020
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:00,963
has shined
a light in this tunnel

1021
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:03,032
for over 500 years.

1022
00:50:03,034 --> 00:50:05,201
It's the fucking way out.

1023
00:50:05,203 --> 00:50:07,169
Papillon: The treasure.
The treasure!

1024
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,304
Someone give
me a boost.

1025
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:09,472
Be careful.

1026
00:50:09,474 --> 00:50:11,474
Scarlett, please
be careful!

1027
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:13,142
It's fine.
Careful.

1028
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:15,111
Yeah. I'm good.

1029
00:50:15,113 --> 00:50:16,178
Scarlett?
Yeah.

1030
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,279
What do you see?

1031
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:18,714
Oh, my God!

1032
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:20,683
Oh, my God!
What?

1033
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,419
George, you have
to see this!
Oh, my God!

1034
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,092
Benji: Wow.

1035
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,898
George: What is this place?

1036
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,900
He's dead.

1037
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:39,402
Yeah.

1038
00:50:39,404 --> 00:50:42,304
He's dead,
but how is he not rotting?

1039
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:44,140
I have no idea.
George, look at this.

1040
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:46,042
What is that?
"Vitriol."

1041
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,178
Why vitriol?

1042
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,479
It's the motto
of alchemy.

1043
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:51,580
Vitriol?

1044
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:56,285
(Scarlett reading)

1045
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,821
Visit the interior
parts of the earth,

1046
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:01,390
by rectification
thou shalt find
the hidden stone.

1047
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,259
The hidden stone.
Fuck!

1048
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:04,393
Papillon:
Is he dead?

1049
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,529
George: Yeah.
For 700 years.

1050
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:07,596
Scarlett: Oh, my God!

1051
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,065
It's creepy.

1052
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,735
Wait. Visit the interior
parts of the earth.

1053
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,272
He's telling us
to go deeper.

1054
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:18,240
I think it means
we're here.
No.

1055
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,076
This has got to be
the interior
parts of the earth.

1056
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,710
No, there has
got to be more.

1057
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:23,379
"Winged vulture
leads your way,

1058
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:25,081
"with brightest
light in darkest day."

1059
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,916
Brightest light
in darkest day.

1060
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:30,519
Everyone turn
off your headlamps.

1061
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:32,121
Benji: Nah, fuck that.

1062
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:34,290
Benji, it will be okay.
There is a dead
man right there.

1063
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:35,758
It will be okay.

1064
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,194
Everyone.

1065
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:39,328
George: Okay.

1066
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,863
Scarlett?

1067
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:41,964
Holy shit.

1068
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:43,532
Look!
Benji: Yeah.

1069
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:46,302
Where's this light
coming from
if that's a wall?

1070
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:49,472
Benji, turn your
camera light on.
Please.

1071
00:51:49,474 --> 00:51:51,207
Scarlett, what
are you doing?

1072
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:56,078
I reckon we can
get through there.

1073
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,747
Scarlett, what
are you doing?

1074
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:00,049
There's a loose stone.

1075
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,553
Okay.

1076
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,057
George:
Can you see
anything down there?

1077
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,799
George: What is it?
Zed: Is something
in there?

1078
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:17,900
I'm going.

1079
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:19,702
What? Scarlett, no!

1080
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,306
George: Scarlett!

1081
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,083
(Panting)

1082
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:35,651
Oh, my God.

1083
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:48,764
Shit!

1084
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,834
Get out of the way.
You're going?

1085
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:52,902
Yeah.

1086
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:56,839
Zed.
What?

1087
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:58,174
Give me my bag.

1088
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,021
George:
Wow. Is this it?

1089
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,524
It's real.

1090
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,562
It's real.

1091
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,642
Holy shit!

1092
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:38,280
(Laughing
ecstatically)

1093
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:43,953
Benji: Scarlett.

1094
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,489
Benji.

1095
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,559
Let's not celebrate
until we're out of here.

1096
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,861
Scarlett, how are
these torches still lit?

1097
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:55,831
The philosopher's
stone can fuel a lamp
for eternity.

1098
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,734
Where is it?
Where's the stone?

1099
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,938
"Brightest light
in darkest day."
Think about it.

1100
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:06,408
Brightest light.

1101
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,743
Yeah.

1102
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,111
The sun.

1103
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:12,781
In ancient Egypt,
they said that
the earth God

1104
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:16,452
and the sky goddess
were madly in love.

1105
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:19,121
But when they had
their first child,
the sun,

1106
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:22,524
he became so jealous
of their affections
that he pushed them apart

1107
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:25,227
so that they were
only able to touch

1108
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:27,896
by the palms
of their hands

1109
00:54:27,898 --> 00:54:30,065
and the soles
of their feet.

1110
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:33,469
Every morning,
the sky goddess
gave birth

1111
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,304
to the sun,

1112
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,306
and every evening

1113
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,142
she would swallow him
back up.

1114
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:41,644
That's it!

1115
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:44,313
Oh, my God.
It looks so ordinary.

1116
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,164
What better place to hide
the most valuable
stone ever known

1117
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,800
than next to riches
you could never miss?

1118
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,736
Wait. It's a trap.
Stop! It's a trap!

1119
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,673
Stop! It's a trap! Wait!

1120
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:11,740
(Yelling)

1121
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,076
(Loud rumbling)

1122
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,123
Scarlett:
Is everyone okay?

1123
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,825
George: Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.

1124
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,060
Papillon: I am, yes.

1125
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:32,928
Benji?

1126
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,930
(All coughing)

1127
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:35,964
Benji: Scarlett?

1128
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,066
I'm good!

1129
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,268
Scarlett: Zed?

1130
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,172
Let me see.
(Coughing)

1131
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:44,606
Souxie?

1132
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:46,175
Souxie?
Souxie?

1133
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:47,943
George: Souxie?

1134
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:49,011
Souxie?

1135
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,112
Souxie!

1136
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:51,180
Get those rocks! Get her!

1137
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,683
Shit!

1138
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:56,852
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

1139
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,687
Are you okay?
Okay, get her.

1140
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,624
Sit. Are you hurt?

1141
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,028
LA taupe?
Where's LA taupe?

1142
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,063
LA taupe!
LA taupe!

1143
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,266
LA taupe!
LA taupe!

1144
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:13,469
Help me dig!

1145
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:14,703
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1146
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,071
George:
He can't breathe!

1147
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:18,173
Don't disturb the rocks!

1148
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,376
George, they might
collapse on us!

1149
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:22,478
George: Fuck!

1150
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,314
We can't move the rocks.
We can't.

1151
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,817
There's no use.
There's no use.

1152
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:30,085
George: No use,
papillon?

1153
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:32,221
No!

1154
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:34,189
I need the first-aid kit.
I have to clean it.

1155
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:35,491
No, don't touch it!

1156
00:56:35,493 --> 00:56:36,825
Papillon: The packs
are buried.

1157
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:38,494
Benji: What do you mean
they're buried?
They're buried!

1158
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:40,028
Benji: Do we
have anything?
Sorry, I'm sorry.

1159
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,631
George: Where's our water?
Our food?

1160
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,869
Do we have any batteries?
For the lights?

1161
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,904
Yeah, we should start
conserving the lights.

1162
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,572
Shit!
What do I do?

1163
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,074
Just keep it up,
so that it stops
bleeding.

1164
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:53,142
Okay.

1165
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:59,415
Okay.
It's all right.
It's okay.

1166
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,150
This might sting.

1167
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,321
Just a sting.

1168
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,190
(Groaning)

1169
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,429
It's okay. It's okay.
(Speaking French)

1170
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,043
Benji: Holy shit!

1171
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:29,812
It really worked.

1172
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,215
How did you do that?

1173
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:35,484
It's the stone.

1174
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:37,519
You okay?
Yeah.

1175
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:40,956
(Speaking French)

1176
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,026
It will be okay.

1177
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,433
They'd never build
something like this
without a back door,

1178
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:53,769
in case it
collapsed, right?

1179
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,604
Never. There's
gotta be something else.

1180
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:57,406
Look around.
Everybody look around.

1181
00:57:57,408 --> 00:57:59,141
Benji: What are we
looking for?
I don't know.

1182
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,646
Is there anything?

1183
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,584
Zed: Some bones.

1184
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,186
What is that?
Is that something?

1185
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:14,256
Yes. Yes. Yes. George!

1186
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:15,757
What is it?

1187
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:23,031
It's the <i> porta alchemica.</i>
This is the door
to the mystical!

1188
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:25,200
Wait. This is a door?
That's a door?

1189
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:27,769
No, not exactly.
It works in
conjunction with this.

1190
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,338
Here.

1191
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:35,277
This is
"as above, so below."

1192
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:38,981
That phrase is believed
to be the key to all magic.

1193
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:40,516
It means that

1194
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:44,887
what is within me
is outside of me.

1195
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:47,623
As it is on earth,
so it is in heaven.

1196
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:50,158
As I am,
so are my cells,

1197
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,662
so are my atoms,
so is God.

1198
00:58:53,664 --> 00:58:56,331
Basically,

1199
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,034
as I believe
the world to be,
so it is.

1200
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,203
Benji: I'm not following.

1201
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:04,806
As above, so below.

1202
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:08,210
So if they carved
a door on the ceiling...

1203
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,012
There has got to
be a door on
the floor, too.

1204
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:12,214
Yeah. Someone
hand me a rock.
All right.

1205
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:15,217
Wait. We are
in the bottom of
the catacombs.

1206
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,052
There's nothing
below us, Scarlett.

1207
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,055
Shit.

1208
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:25,661
If this is the floor
then where is all
that water going?

1209
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,467
There's a way out.

1210
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,781
Souxie:
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

1211
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,252
Guys, there's a passage
down here.

1212
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,387
Come down. It's okay.

1213
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:53,488
Souxie.

1214
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,026
Watch out, Benji.

1215
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,431
Can you read that?
What does it say?

1216
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:13,041
"Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here."

1217
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:16,278
Papillon: What?

1218
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,450
According to
mythology,

1219
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:25,153
that's the inscription
over the gates of hell.

1220
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,189
Papillon: What?

1221
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:31,059
I'm not going in there.

1222
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:33,695
I thought you didn't
believe in any of this.

1223
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:36,565
I don't.

1224
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:45,073
"And they shall be made
to crawl on their bellies

1225
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:46,808
"to enter
the kingdom of darkness."

1226
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,244
Yeah, that occurred
to me, too.

1227
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:50,412
Yeah.

1228
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:53,315
Shit.

1229
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,399
Fuck.

1230
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:17,839
It's exactly the same.

1231
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,142
Scarlett:
No. No, it's not.

1232
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:22,611
It's not exactly
the same.

1233
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,581
Everything's
the wrong way around.

1234
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,420
This is upside down.

1235
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,224
Papillon:
Wait. No!

1236
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:37,359
What?

1237
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,927
No.

1238
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:41,830
Benji: What the fuck?

1239
01:01:41,832 --> 01:01:43,865
What happened to
the entrance?

1240
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,203
Jesus.

1241
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,606
Are we dead?

1242
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:53,575
No.

1243
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:55,410
We're not dead.

1244
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,482
We should just
keep moving.

1245
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,651
Okay?

1246
01:02:02,653 --> 01:02:05,287
We have to
find a way out.
Come on.

1247
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,758
Shit. Okay.

1248
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,431
I go.

1249
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,591
(Screeching)

1250
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:44,526
(Gasping)

1251
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:46,194
Souxie!
Souxie!

1252
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:48,196
Is everybody out?
Yeah.

1253
01:02:48,198 --> 01:02:49,698
I don't have a light.
Do you have a light?

1254
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,032
I can't find
my light, either.

1255
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,437
Do you see that?

1256
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,372
Get the camera.

1257
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:58,774
Be careful. Careful!

1258
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,610
What is that?

1259
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:02,978
What is that?

1260
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:08,283
Benji: Jesus.

1261
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,286
(Heavy breathing)

1262
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:19,494
Zed: Souxie.

1263
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:21,730
No.

1264
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,873
Souxie.

1265
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:36,945
Souxie: LA taupe?

1266
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:38,013
Papillon: LA taupe!

1267
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,021
Are you okay?

1268
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:51,593
LA taupe?

1269
01:03:51,595 --> 01:03:53,361
George: What the fuck?

1270
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:54,729
(Screaming)
Benji: Shit!

1271
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:56,498
Souxie, stay back!

1272
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,632
Zed: Stay back!

1273
01:03:57,634 --> 01:04:00,168
Scarlett: Careful,
Benji. Careful.

1274
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,604
George: The fuck is wrong
with him?

1275
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:04,005
Scarlett: What's wrong
with him?

1276
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:06,608
Hey.

1277
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,378
It's okay.

1278
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,647
It's me.
George: No, no, don't.

1279
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:14,850
Okay? Hey.
Benji:
Souxie, be careful.

1280
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,118
LA taupe.

1281
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,386
Souxie, don't.

1282
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:19,521
Scarlett: His eyes.

1283
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,056
Hey.

1284
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,657
(Thud)

1285
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:24,693
(All yelling)

1286
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,963
Benji: Souxie!

1287
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:29,364
Souxie, no!

1288
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,000
George: Benji!
Get a light on LA taupe!

1289
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:33,902
Benji! He's over here!

1290
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:35,637
Where is he?
Hold her head.

1291
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:37,138
Where is he?

1292
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,573
George: Where the fuck
did he go?

1293
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,477
The stone!
Bring her back, please!

1294
01:04:42,479 --> 01:04:44,479
It won't work.
Fix her!
It will fix her!

1295
01:04:44,481 --> 01:04:46,181
Please try!
Try it! Please!

1296
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:47,415
I'm trying. I'm sorry.

1297
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,317
Fix her. Fix her.

1298
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:56,791
It can't bring
back the dead.
I'm sorry.

1299
01:04:58,494 --> 01:04:59,828
I'm sorry.

1300
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,396
Is she dead?

1301
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:07,969
Benji: I'm so sorry, man.

1302
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,587
I'm so sorry.

1303
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:28,356
We have to keep moving.

1304
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:30,792
Okay?

1305
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,429
George,
you follow me.
Yeah.

1306
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,632
Benji: Okay.
I'm right behind you.

1307
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:38,934
Scarlett: Okay.

1308
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,037
(Loud creaking)

1309
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,374
Are you okay?

1310
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:47,442
Yeah.

1311
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,985
Man: <i> Scarlett.</i>
What?

1312
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:00,956
What?

1313
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:15,837
Everything is like
the mirror image of what
we have already done,

1314
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,907
but somehow,
we keep going deeper.

1315
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:21,376
Benji: How much deeper?

1316
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,379
Another 100 meters.

1317
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,848
Putting us

1318
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,317
1,000 feet down.

1319
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,159
Scarlett:
Did you hear that?

1320
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,829
Man: <i> Scarlett!</i>

1321
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:43,631
Is that Benji?

1322
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,867
No, I don't think so.

1323
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:47,135
Benji?

1324
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:48,269
You okay?

1325
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:49,771
Yeah. Yeah, you?

1326
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:50,805
Good!

1327
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:52,507
All right. Good.

1328
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:54,376
(Faint baby crying)

1329
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,791
Is somebody there?

1330
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,869
(Unclear whispering)

1331
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:21,936
Hello?

1332
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:25,974
(Screaming)

1333
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,143
George.

1334
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:30,078
(All screaming)

1335
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,180
Scarlett: Benji! Benji!

1336
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:33,648
George: Benji! Benji.

1337
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,050
Benji! Oh, my God.

1338
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,751
Get him over!
Get him over! Get him over!

1339
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,420
Is he alive?

1340
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:39,988
No, no, no!
Shit!

1341
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,224
Jesus.

1342
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:44,459
Scarlett:
Oh, my God.

1343
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:50,732
We should keep moving.

1344
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:51,833
Benji.

1345
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:56,938
We should keep moving.

1346
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,741
George: Come on.
Papillon: Let's go!

1347
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:01,709
We need light.
We gotta go.

1348
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:04,112
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go!

1349
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:05,547
(Sobbing)
Scarlett,
we gotta go.

1350
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:07,816
Oh, my God!

1351
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,519
Let's go.

1352
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:13,455
Oh, my God!

1353
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:23,264
Danny:
George, help me.

1354
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:37,278
(Yelling in water)

1355
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:39,981
Danny?
George, help me.

1356
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,284
Danny! Danny!
Scarlett: George?

1357
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:44,986
Wait. Move the bones!

1358
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:46,588
Move the bones! Danny!

1359
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:47,822
Danny: George!

1360
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:49,657
Danny!

1361
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:51,059
That's my brother
down there!

1362
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:52,927
Get off the bones!
Get off the bones!

1363
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:54,762
Danny! Danny!

1364
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:56,464
Move the bones!
Get out of the way!

1365
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,500
I said, get the fuck
out of the way!

1366
01:08:58,502 --> 01:09:00,935
Danny! Danny!

1367
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:04,072
Scarlett: It's not real.
George! It's not real!

1368
01:09:04,074 --> 01:09:05,573
George!

1369
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,144
George.

1370
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,313
(Both breathing heavily)

1371
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,389
We have to go.

1372
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,000
Scarlett,

1373
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,469
why would he be here?

1374
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:35,537
I don't know.

1375
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:37,539
What is happening to us?

1376
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,844
(Man yelling)

1377
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:46,915
(Screams echoing)

1378
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:48,550
Wait.

1379
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:02,597
(Yelling continues)

1380
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,748
(Fire crackling)

1381
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,507
(Fire roaring)

1382
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,827
No. It wasn't my fault.

1383
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:08,963
It wasn't my fault!

1384
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,937
(Shouting in French)

1385
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,875
Help me! Help me!

1386
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,087
(All exclaiming)

1387
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,656
Get his leg!

1388
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,500
No! No!

1389
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:47,168
We have to go
back to get papillon!

1390
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:50,138
George: No. Absolutely not.
Come on!

1391
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,572
What is that?

1392
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,445
George: What was that?
What did you hear?

1393
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:59,314
George, let's go back.
Let's go back.

1394
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:00,615
Hey.

1395
01:12:00,617 --> 01:12:01,983
No, zed.

1396
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:03,751
Keep with us.
We can't.

1397
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:04,786
We can't go back.

1398
01:12:04,788 --> 01:12:06,454
We have to keep going.

1399
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:08,656
Come on. Come on.

1400
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:13,995
(Loud rhythmic rumbling)

1401
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:36,250
George: Okay. Go.
Go, go, go.

1402
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,875
(Loud rattling
and screeching)

1403
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:04,545
George: What the fuck
was that?

1404
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,119
(All panicked breathing)

1405
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,256
Fuck.

1406
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:20,495
Scarlett, Scarlett.

1407
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,898
Whatever happens,

1408
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,902
the week in Turkey
was the greatest
week of my life.

1409
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,772
Mine, too.

1410
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,512
We gotta go.

1411
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:40,848
We gotta go.

1412
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:44,752
Ready?
Yeah.

1413
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:45,853
Zed?
Yeah?

1414
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:47,021
Are you with me?

1415
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:48,089
Yeah, man.

1416
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,994
Okay.

1417
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:55,696
Wait. Wait.

1418
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:17,885
(Growling)

1419
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:32,133
(Groaning)

1420
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,675
(Wheezing and moaning)

1421
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:50,551
(Echoing yelling)

1422
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:03,898
George: Shit. Shit.
He's getting up.

1423
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,235
Go, go, go!

1424
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:13,574
(Monster screaming)

1425
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,581
George: Zed.

1426
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,193
Get back. Get back.

1427
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,065
(Screaming)

1428
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:45,873
Hang on!

1429
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:53,714
Scarlett:
Shit! Go, go, go!

1430
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,561
Hold on!

1431
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,330
He's losing blood!

1432
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:13,100
Zed, put your hand here!
Just keep it down!

1433
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,704
Zed! Put your hand there.

1434
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:18,873
Yeah, yeah.
It's okay.

1435
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:20,708
Hold on. Okay?

1436
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:23,077
Not yet. Hold on.
Okay. Okay.

1437
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:26,480
It's okay.
It's okay. Hold on.
Hold on.

1438
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,018
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Okay.

1439
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,958
It's not working.
It's not working.

1440
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,259
Why?
I don't know!

1441
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:40,294
It's not working!
Oh, my God.

1442
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,230
George: Vitriol.

1443
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:44,298
What?

1444
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,067
Vitriol.

1445
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:47,835
Vitriol.

1446
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:51,038
Yeah.

1447
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,406
"Visit the interior
parts of the earth,

1448
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:55,142
"by rectification
thou shalt find
the hidden stone."

1449
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:00,147
"By rectification
thou shalt find
the hidden stone."

1450
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:01,782
Hidden stone.

1451
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:04,719
Rectification.

1452
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:08,255
George, the hidden stone.
This isn't the right stone.

1453
01:17:08,257 --> 01:17:11,125
I have to rectify
the taking of it.

1454
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,160
Only by putting it back
will I find the real stone.

1455
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,631
Fuck!
(Monster moaning)

1456
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,933
Fuck!

1457
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:20,234
Zed: What?

1458
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:21,302
I'm going back.

1459
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,437
No, you can't!
I have to go back.

1460
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:25,673
By the time we
get him out of here
he'll be dead!

1461
01:17:25,675 --> 01:17:27,308
Please! Wait!

1462
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,643
Stay with him.
I'll be back.

1463
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:30,344
Just keep him safe.
I'm coming back!

1464
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:32,480
Hold on! Hold on!

1465
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:34,649
I'm coming back!
Scarlett!

1466
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,385
Scarlett!

1467
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:04,912
(Groaning)

1468
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:13,120
You can do this.
You can do this.

1469
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:14,555
(Straining)

1470
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:26,534
(Panting)

1471
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,981
(Gagging underwater)

1472
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,218
(Screams)

1473
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:58,165
(Sobbing)

1474
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:26,761
Dad?

1475
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:35,336
(Screams)

1476
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:01,662
"By rectification
thou shalt find
the hidden stone."

1477
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:07,334
Okay. I rectified.

1478
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:09,637
Where's the hidden stone?

1479
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:27,688
George. George,
do you hear me? George?

1480
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,595
(Coughing)

1481
01:20:34,597 --> 01:20:38,432
Shut up. Come on.
Come on, come on.

1482
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:40,668
As above

1483
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:42,536
so below.

1484
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:45,439
As I believe
the world to be,
so it is.

1485
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:47,007
Hold on, George.

1486
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:58,552
Dad.

1487
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:08,195
I'm sorry

1488
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:12,099
that I didn't pick up
the phone that night.

1489
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,738
I didn't know you
were in that much pain.

1490
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,891
(Panting and straining)

1491
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:41,996
George?

1492
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:52,773
Zed!

1493
01:21:52,775 --> 01:21:54,275
Where are you?

1494
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:55,643
Scarlett! Here!

1495
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:01,949
Did you
find the stone?
Yes!

1496
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:03,250
Okay.

1497
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:18,832
How did you do that?

1498
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:20,401
(Coughing)

1499
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:21,835
Hi.

1500
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,639
George?
George?

1501
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:28,943
Come here.

1502
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:33,781
Scarlett, Scarlett.
Go, go.

1503
01:22:33,783 --> 01:22:34,848
Give me your hand.

1504
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:39,687
Scarlett: Zed!

1505
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:43,624
Zed! Zed!

1506
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:48,462
Dead end!

1507
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:49,630
Watch out!

1508
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:51,465
Zed: Shit, my lamp! Shit!

1509
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:54,735
Scarlett: Hurry!

1510
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:00,274
Zed: We will never be
able to climb down that.

1511
01:23:00,276 --> 01:23:01,842
We have to jump.
What?

1512
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:04,945
We have to
rectify ourselves

1513
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:07,147
and jump.
Scarlett, you're crazy.

1514
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,248
We will die.

1515
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,416
No. George, listen.

1516
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:11,251
Why do you keep
seeing your brother
down here?

1517
01:23:11,253 --> 01:23:14,021
What is it about his
death that torments you?

1518
01:23:14,023 --> 01:23:16,657
George. George.
It's not
gonna work.

1519
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:18,525
Why is he haunting you?

1520
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:20,761
When Danny got
his leg pinned

1521
01:23:20,763 --> 01:23:23,597
I promised him I'd
be back with help.

1522
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:25,833
But I got lost along the way.

1523
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:28,669
My brother drowned
waiting for me to save him.

1524
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:32,072
It's okay.

1525
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,975
Zed.

1526
01:23:34,977 --> 01:23:37,644
I have a child
I've never seen.

1527
01:23:37,646 --> 01:23:39,780
I know it's mine,
but I deny it.

1528
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,950
It's okay.
Give me your hand.

1529
01:23:42,952 --> 01:23:45,486
Scarlett, it's not
gonna work.
George.

1530
01:23:45,488 --> 01:23:47,821
I can't.
I won't go without you.

1531
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:49,323
I won't.

1532
01:23:49,325 --> 01:23:50,891
Okay.
Okay.

1533
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,328
We go on three.
On three.

1534
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:55,629
One.

1535
01:23:57,465 --> 01:23:58,966
Two.

1536
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:03,070
Three.

1537
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:15,883
(Crashing)

1538
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:16,950
(All coughing)

1539
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:30,597
Fuck!

1540
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:34,835
Save the light.

1541
01:24:34,837 --> 01:24:35,936
Zed: Yeah.

1542
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,339
We are trapped?

1543
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:40,607
Scarlett: No.

1544
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:43,544
Fuck!

1545
01:24:43,546 --> 01:24:46,513
Fuck! No! Fuck!

1546
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:49,083
Zed! Zed!

1547
01:24:49,085 --> 01:24:50,818
We'll die!
(Shushing)

1548
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:52,553
We'll die!

1549
01:24:52,555 --> 01:24:54,521
George: Hey! Down.

1550
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:55,789
Put the light down.

1551
01:24:56,624 --> 01:24:57,925
Help me get
the rocks.

1552
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:06,100
It's a manhole.
Find a grip.
Find a grip.

1553
01:25:06,102 --> 01:25:08,202
Can you get your
fingers in the sides?

1554
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:10,370
Just try! Try!

1555
01:25:10,372 --> 01:25:11,872
I'm trying!

1556
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:14,308
I can't.

1557
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:17,644
Scarlett,
what did you just do?

1558
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:19,546
Pushed it down.
Okay. Okay.

1559
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:21,982
Scarlett:
One, two, three.

1560
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:25,285
Oh, my God.

1561
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:27,087
George:
We're gonna push
it straight down.

1562
01:25:27,089 --> 01:25:28,822
Down and
to the side.
Okay.

1563
01:25:28,824 --> 01:25:31,625
One, two, three.

1564
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:35,629
Good, good, good.

1565
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:36,997
Get it over here.

1566
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:54,481
Holy shit!

1567
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:55,682
Zed.

1568
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:57,818
Hello?

1569
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,989
We gotta get out.

1570
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:03,557
Get the camera out.

1571
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:27,915
(George gasping)

1572
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:38,125
(Distant moaning)

1573
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:27,941
(Sobbing)

1574
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:30,777
<i>People say that</i>

1575
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:34,948
I'm some kind of
treasure hunter.
It's not what I'm after.

1576
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:38,385
I'm not doing this
for financial gain.

1577
01:27:38,387 --> 01:27:42,456
I'm a student.
Of history,
of alchemy.

1578
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:45,692
It would be

1579
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:49,062
of great historical
value.

1580
01:27:49,064 --> 01:27:51,098
So you simply
want the truth.

1581
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:52,799
Exactly.

1582
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:58,138
Yeah, I want the truth.

1583
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:17,430
LA taupe:
<i>The only way out</i>
<i>is down.</i>
