You fucking like that?
You fucking like that?

Hey, Jones, what's up?

53
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,560
So I guess I have to make
friends with the Lance Corporal.

54
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,864
Don't even expect me to be your friend,
cause we're on the same...

55
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,399
I'm friends with Lise, too.

56
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,153
I made friends with the Lance Corporal.

57
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,820
That's right, you smack ass.

58
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,622
You're trying to kiss my ass.

59
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,035
You want me to fucking give you
a good word, give you a good report.

60
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,955
He's not a good place to look,
because I've been friends with him

61
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,623
since the fucking first day
of hoot camp.

62
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:26,012
Open locks, whoever knocks.

63
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,307
1 don't know the answer
to your question.

64
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,647
I've been recommended about three
times out the last eight months.

65
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,311
Do you have a tank score?

66
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,940
That'll do it to you.

67
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,700
That'll do it to you!

68
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,077
You see, listen, listen, listen.

69
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,247
Hey, listen.

70
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,703
Will you listen for a second?

71
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,417
All this shit adds up.

72
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,226
Who's gonna guard the body, marine?

73
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,307
lam, ma'am.

74
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,098
Il go out there and get it.

75
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,534
Okay, I think that wraps things up.
We can take off.

76
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,872
Yes, ma'am.

77
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,793
We can get outta here now.

78
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:40,924
Roger that.

79
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,849
1 got non-rec'd on the next
eight months.

80
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,179
That's bullshit!

81
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,732
You know, they're probably...

82
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,192
I mean, sparks shot out of her
ass and everything.

83
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,069
Screw that, no way.

84
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,820
There's no sense
who got the better of who,

85
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,397
he's gonna be sitting in jail.

86
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,278
Yeah, now his life's fucked.

87
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,359
Him and Schrader.

88
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,444
He had that kinda stare
in his eye, too.

89
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,372
Schrader, you never knew
which way...

90
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,370
What was that guy
that used to be with 2-7?

91
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,957
What was his name, the crazy one?

92
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,335
No, the other crazy one.

93
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,297
That went down and faked the craziness.

94
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:25,676
Look, billet.

95
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:26,962
Yes, I availed of them

96
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,723
for the last year and a half,
two years.

97
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,257
- Squad leader?
- Yep.

98
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,977
And what did you get?

99
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,479
About four, four or five,

100
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,603
somewhere in there, average.

101
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,650
Four or five what?

102
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,648
- Four, five, six?
-I mean...

103
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,280
- Four, five what?
- Four, five, two?

104
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,282
- Four five, three?
- [don't know.

105
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,608
- Yeah, I was fucking wasted, man.
- And you sill got non-rec'd?

106
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,109
Did you get non-rec'd?

107
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,990
Mills, did you get non-rec'd?

108
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,903
For 4.5and 4.4 or five or
six or whatever you got?

109
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:33,491
Yeah.

110
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,404
You got non-rec'd?

111
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,284
Yep.

112
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,505
But what are we doing here now,
right now?

113
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,134
What do you train for every day?

114
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,091
Some third world fucking country.

115
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,255
We're protecting our interests.

116
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,889
Some third world fucking country.

117
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,472
No shit, but that doesn't...

118
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,770
-Yeah.
- Korea?

119
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,146
What the fuck do they have for us?

120
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,806
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

121
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,650
Just cause I'm friends with...

122
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,195
There's no way you should even
trust anyone with that stuff.

123
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,952
Even Greg said I should
keep my guns out of his house.

124
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,867
Lance Corporal McCreary?

125
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,412
So who's gonna ride with him
back on base?

126
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,047
A, I don't want that in our house.

127
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,252
B, I don't feel like trying to
track your wife down...

128
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,632
looking for like maybe 1000
dollars worth of stuff...

129
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,423
Wear a bag though!

130
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,631
Is O'Hara the one that
fucking lives in my room?

131
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,507
Hey doc,
Il fuck anything that walks.

132
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,227
The day after y'all leave.

133
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,268
That's just like a ceremony
for all these racks.

134
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,150
You can pass,
you can drive a Hum-V.

135
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,730
They're gonna say Kank that,

136
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,367
you can do that later,
you're outta here.

137
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,197
And they got Phelps down
as a driver.

138
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,914
Recon my eyelids!

139
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,250
Me and you,
it'l probably be just me and you...

140
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,129
If Phelps goes on leave,

141
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,082
then I'l just slide ride
into that fucking Hum-V.

142
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,965
...it has been tabulated.

143
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,598
1 guess it has been higher
then what mine is.

144
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,097
It goes from your rifle range

145
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,012
to your pro and con.

146
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,356
So, open shoot today?

147
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,685
Combat shoot, combat course?

148
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,700
Stick your feet in there, sir.

149
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,702
You gentlemen
think this is a tea party?

150
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,362
Why don't you do some paperwork?

151
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,915
Yes, ma'am.

152
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,789
Why don't you get the
clipboard out of the there,

153
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,837
out of my vehicle, start on that.

154
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,836
- Sergeant?
- Yes, ma'am.

155
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,897
Why don't you keep an eye on him?

156
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,977
Marine, if you're tired,
maybe you should get some sleep.

157
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,186
Yes, ma'am.

158
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,958
This one girl that works in the back
of the bar, she's hot as hell.

159
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,214
Yes, ma'am.

160
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,305
Little sideshow for you,
with your drinks.

161
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,806
Back home at the bar they got...

162
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,816
give them the tip,
they all wear like,

163
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,818
old ties,
and like a tux setup.

164
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,899
Maybe give ‘em a tip,

165
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,984
they jump up and hit a bell
or whatever.

166
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,116
It's good to have a little
sideshow with your drinks.

167
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,572
Who's on the the range today?

168
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,996
I've had my fun,
you've had your fun...

169
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,304
You fucking like that?

170
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,351
You fucking like that?

171
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:08,769
Do you like that?

172
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,187
Huh?

173
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,106
You fucking like that?

174
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,391
Do you like that?

175
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,316
Me and this clown were
joking around...

176
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,984
like, with this dead Iraqi.

177
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,494
Itwas cool, it was great.

178
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,412
It was great to have a dead
Iraqi there.

179
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,542
It was awesome.

180
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,840
Alpha...Delta...Bravo.

181
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,091
It was awesome.

182
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,548
On Johnson's bed,
that's just supposed to be water

183
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,683
but there's more piss stains
in the garage.

184
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,475
Johnson just
leaves all his stuff there.

185
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,064
I mean, why don't you leam...

186
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,227
So many people got divorced,
and just took everything.

187
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,521
I was like,
I'm getting a storage spot,

188
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,189
1 don't trust anybody's marriage.

189
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,153
Did he ever
get the TV back from Laura?

190
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,951
O'Hara, O'Hara...
Just let it go.

191
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,372
You know what he said to LeHood,

192
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,871
he went to pick up his orders,
yesterday, leave orders,

193
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,085
and he's screaming
at me for half an hour

194
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,412
for why the barracks messed up.

195
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,373
He's like, I'm a Lance Corporal,
you know?

196
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,506
Staring off into space.

197
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,216
Staring out into space.

198
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,702
But I don't know if you gotta pay,

199
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,124
usually they've got a sale on,
but I don't know.

200
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,208
I'm sure you could put on layaway
and still get the 10 percent off.

201
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,583
But most of the time if they
give you the deal,

202
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,338
you gotta buy it right out,
like my shotgun,

203
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,547
I had to buy, pay off
completely to get the deal.

204
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,345
Yeah, they said you
don't put it on layaway

205
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,096
you're not gonna get
the 10 percent off.

206
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,478
Ten percent off it was like
470 dollars.

207
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,735
Over and under, American Arms.

208
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,753
Oh yeah, overseas.

209
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,256
She had a baby right
before he left, the second one,

210
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:50,261
19 years old, she shacked up
with a guy from 3-7.

211
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:54,015
Went on leave to Idaho,
stayed there,

212
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,720
and now he's going to Okinawa,

213
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,977
and she's staying there for six months.

214
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,058
He can't get ahold of her,
and uh...

215
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,050
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf.

216
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,431
Hark I am called.

217
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,433
Of the ravined salf sea shark.

218
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,515
Root of hemlock...

219
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,768
Gall of goat and slips of yew.

220
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,729
Like a helibroth...

221
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,834
Double, double, toil and trouble.

222
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,958
You can't see shit all day,
you're out there all day,

223
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,834
just freezing your ass off,

224
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,506
Alright, our next contestant is...
Mondo!

225
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,100
Mondo is our next contestant here.

226
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,107
Well, you know how
these scumbags are.

227
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,318
1 yanked him around a little bit.

228
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,445
Our shift's about to end,
are we gonna have to wait around here

229
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,151
for NIS to show up?

230
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,996
Well, yeah, one of you guys
is gonna have to wait around...

231
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,626
He hasn't said a word.

232
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,124
What time did y'all call your NIS,

233
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,796
did y'all call them right away?

234
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,040
Uh, we called an NIS...

235
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,840
Go on now Mondo, don't be shy.
They've seen it all before.

236
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,765
There's a crowd

237
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,143
Gathering round the courtyard

238
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,810
You see there's gonna be a babe

239
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,646
When the sun goes down

240
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,155
The baboon' blood.

241
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,994
Thrice the striped cat hath mewed.

242
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,085
Peace!

243
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,004
The charm's wound up!

244
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:30,834
Thrice, and once the
hedge pig whined...

245
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,548
In the poisoned entrails throw...

246
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,782
Do you guys know
who he was with?

247
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,959
I mean it looks like this guy's alone.

248
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,543
If he had somebody with him,
we didn't see anybody else.

249
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:18,886
I don't know, that fucker
looks all disoriented.

250
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,809
1 think there's something
wrong with him,

251
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,310
he hasn't said a word.

252
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,860
Oh, Mondo!

253
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,192
Now we know why they call him Mondo!

254
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,080
That's her blood all over him?

255
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,170
Is that her blood all over?

256
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:51,831
Yeah, I'm assuming.

257
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,212
1 didn't see the cuts on her,
but she's got blood on...

258
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,225
He hit her a few times on the head,
there's some...

259
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,435
she looks like she's got blood
coming out of her head.

260
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,153
Hey man, show ‘em your boner!

261
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,321
What do you think, Billy?

262
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,988
Feel free to make sure

263
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,367
that it is a bulge,
and not a roll of toilet paper.

264
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:30,415
Alright, that was... Mondo!

265
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,871
Show 'em your boner!

266
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,631
And next, coming to us from the
great state of Arkansas is Jim!

267
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,641
Pretty open area out here though.

268
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:46,894
Right now...

269
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,944
Stupid motherfucker
couldn't even get a shovel.

270
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,859
Came out here with...

271
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,985
Now [ would advise you
to take my advice

272
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,992
I'm not saying same things twice

273
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,743
You better be a...

274
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,541
jail or something...

275
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,913
he's wasting his life away.

276
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,744
His life is just now fucked.

277
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:15,915
Maybe he's a smart man

278
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,920
and he's gonna find a great lawyer.

279
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,006
Anything wrong...

280
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,421
...claim he's mental or something.

281
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,474
- Yeah, of course.
-Butit's only...

282
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,514
Yeah, that's still...
even if you do that

283
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,187
you just do it in a plusher place.

284
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,977
You better believe that

285
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,856
You better believe that today

286
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,275
I'm gonna let you know

287
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,700
That I ain't gonna let you stay

288
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,992
Hey hey hey

289
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,114
[ain't got...

290
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,199
..a 14 is about as big as my arm.

291
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,877
-APXis uh 15?
-15.

292
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,168
The only thing,
they don't carry good pistols.

293
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,254
They don't carry Smith and Weston,
they don't carry any Sigs.

294
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,640
Just Colt and Kruger.

295
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,718
Kruger's got a big contract with them...

296
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,017
I just wanna get pissed tomorrow.

297
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:15,979
He's got a down home

298
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,312
country western bulge,
you can't wait to see.

299
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:38,376
Spencer...
show ‘em something!

300
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,380
[ guess they wanna see your tattoo,
and not your balls!

301
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,679
I believe one of the adults,
one of the judges

302
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,972
asked if it came in an adult size.

303
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,985
He was in the house with me,

304
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,113
but uh...
they just shot at his car.

305
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,342
Oh, here he comes, ladies!

306
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,888
Smaller handle...

307
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,894
Yeah, the one with
the smaller handle.

308
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,441
I wanna get that one.

309
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,941
Put it on layaway on the 15th
when the sale starts.

310
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,988
Can't put it on sale.

311
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:55,120
What an idiot, what the fuck was
he thinking trying to cover her up?

312
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,122
Thus do go about, about...

313
00:29:59,047 --> 00:29:59,707
Sorry...

314
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,789
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine,

315
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,749
the 3 sisters hand in hand...

316
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:04,925
The cat hath mewed...

317
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,470
Thrice and once the
hedge-pig whined.

318
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,967
And thrice again to make...

319
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,173
Travelers of the sea and fand...

320
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,508
The 3 sisters hand in hand...

321
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,683
Travelers of the sea and fand.

322
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,764
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine.

323
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,188
Trice to thine...

324
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,112
Three sisters, hand in hand...

325
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,826
Is that a grade A Arkansas boner?

326
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,496
Yeah, I ain't cried once
in 28 years

327
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,824
But I musta been
savin' up all my tears

328
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,158
When that damn...

329
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:41,829
You like that?

330
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,213
Do you like that?

331
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,131
Do you like...

332
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,421
Do you fucking see this!

333
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,842
Do you fucking see this!

334
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,387
Do you like that, do you like that!

335
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,260
Do you like that!

336
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,099
Huh?

337
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,344
How's that fucking smell,
huh buddy?

338
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,268
Huh?

339
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,306
Fucking, you see what
you've fucking done?

340
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,440
Fucker.

341
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,852
Fucking like that?

342
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,532
Shoulda never been...

343
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,114
You like that?

344
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:17,949
Huh?

345
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,659
Do you like that?

346
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,966
And I know I should have
picked you out

347
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,420
About a 100 times before...

348
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,345
Slime ball.

349
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,976
Why the hell'd he drive with
her right in the car?

350
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,852
Anyone can look down and see him.

351
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,808
Truck or something.

352
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,772
Right in the back of the car.

353
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,356
...can do it anyways...

354
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,782
..how little she was...

355
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,325
...ver saw him again...

356
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,178
Okay...

357
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,853
1 don't recognize him.

358
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,235
From all the blood,
it looks like,

359
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,362
alot of the wounds might have
been on the back.

360
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,027
I'l show you all the patience...

361
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,613
You fucking like that!

362
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:43,917
Qur next contestant,

363
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:47,372
coming to us from parts unknown,

364
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,920
and a total combined bulge weight

365
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,003
of somewhere over 10 pounds.

366
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,347
Maybe she cheated on
him or something.

367
00:32:58,977 --> 00:32:59,717
Sergeant?

368
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,680
Yes, ma'am.

369
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,483
This guys looks nuts, ma'am.

370
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:13,905
He doesn't know what's going on.

371
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,784
Get some back up, and call NIS.

372
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,706
1think he's a section A.

373
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,714
At least that's what he fold me.

374
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,754
It's Andy!

375
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,972
[ tell some sweet thing

376
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,353
Stepped into the rain

377
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,649
Say now boys you know

378
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,854
This one pretty thing

379
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,484
[ plan to keep...

380
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,734
Yes, ma'am.

381
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,914
Yeah, I got on the hook,
and I already

382
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,784
touched base with NIS.

383
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,666
They sure are taking their own
stinking time getting out here.

384
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,376
Double, double, toil and trouble.

385
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:13,711
Mirror, mirror.

386
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,793
Show his eyes,
and grieve his heart.

387
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:21,386
- Double, double, toil and trouble.
- Mirror, mirror.

388
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,888
My little spirit see...

389
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,168
Mirror mirror, on the wall.

390
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,186
Who's the fairest one of all?

391
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,042
Just like dark combat.

392
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:43,006
Shooting and popping off,
go down, sit down...

393
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,264
third Sunday.

394
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,997
So what else causes it?

395
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,299
Bad day at work or something?

396
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,842
He was over there digging

397
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,007
a shallow grave or something.

398
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:26,924
A shallow grave?

399
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,258
And then we seen him

400
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,809
cover up the body.

401
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,730
You guys have to rough him up
or anything? Just go for it.

402
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,935
Well, you know how these
guys are, scumbags.

403
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,568
And I mean,
I'm assuming that's his wife, so.

404
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,033
I doubt if anybody else
would be that mad at her.

405
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,262
..gun should go over
there in the hoot, sir...

406
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,720
Tell you the truth,
I kinda can't watt...

407
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,707
You take off, you stop,

408
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,037
you grab off to the side.

409
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,170
..these boys there,
they started beating the shit out of her.

410
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,313
He tried to scalp her,

411
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,860
but he didn't do a very good job.

412
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,442
Real nice night out here tonight.

413
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,329
I'm tired.

414
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,790
What are you gonna be
doing after this?

415
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,459
I don't know, what are you gonna do?

416
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,952
Depends.

417
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,208
Depends on what?

418
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,957
Hey, O'Hara...

419
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,822
- In a hard cell.
- Yeah.

420
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:52,778
He's still gonna do the time,

421
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,328
they ain't gonna ever let
you out of there.

422
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,951
Big house either way
you look at it.

423
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,209
They'll just kick your ass out.

424
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,710
He was trying to cover up.

425
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,079
Right in the back of the car.

426
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,624
Not the smartest guy.

427
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,507
I think everybody could see
if she was in the back seat,

428
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,053
1 don't know what he was thinking.

429
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,223
You would think this freak would
have stuck her in the trunk.

430
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,676
The temperature is 55 degrees,

431
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:43,139
the relative humidity 80%,
the barometer stand...

432
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,730
So she got porked
down right in the stomach.

433
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,864
- Son of a bitch, fucked her up man.
- Yeah.

434
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:58,571
With highs that will be in the upper 50s
and Jow 60s for most areas.

435
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,006
I'had a dream last night.

436
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:18,216
I was dreamt I was walking
through this big house.

437
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,759
It went on forever.

438
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,595
I walked through rooms
and rooms and rooms.

439
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:29,560
At the end, there was a door,
in the door there was a room.

440
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:34,781
An auditorium and a stage,
balconies of seats.

441
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:40,279
And I looked up to the top,
it was like nine stories high.

442
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,866
I walked up to the top of
the balconies to look down,

443
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:49,205
and it umed into a
space shuttle, flew away,

444
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:53,007
everybody was gone,
and I was gone.

445
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:50,853
Robbi?

446
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,374
I don't even
know this marine's name.

447
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,260
This way.

448
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,185
Dispatch, dispatch.

449
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,270
Sending, over.

450
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,824
We've got a Charlie Delta Jane Doe.

451
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,007
Roger that sir, out.

452
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:00,586
This body's
really starting to stink.

453
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,901
I don't know,
maybe she was cheating

454
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:21,982
on him or something.

455
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,285
I have no idea, but he tore her

456
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,954
pretty bad with that knife.

457
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,421
Obviously there's really something
wrong with this guy.

458
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,041
1 mean look at how he carried
the scene out there.

459
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,386
He's fucking out of it,
he's gone.

460
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,344
Yeah, I wouldn't think

461
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,437
she'd put up much of a fight,

462
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,107
I mean, considering the
size of that bad hoy there.

463
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,116
Good morning.

464
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,038
Morning.

465
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:01,377
What time is it?

466
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:03,216
7:30.

467
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,003
Where you going?

468
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,776
She's knows she's
gonna get money out of him.

469
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,399
Digging a grave out here
with an E-tool.

470
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,072
I mean, it's daylight out here.

471
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:26,818
Yeah.

472
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,118
I have a meeting.

473
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,040
I have a few meetings.

474
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,278
Pretty hot day.

475
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,533
Mhm.

476
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,032
Its really clear.

477
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,515
I'm assuming
that's probably his wife.

478
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:42,265
She was probably
cheating on him or something.

479
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,576
I'l call, and see what
everybody's up to?

480
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,616
Uh-huh.

481
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,376
Either that or she
gave up the fight.

482
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,121
Blood all over
the interior of the car.

483
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,644
A truck or something drives by,

484
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,724
it's pretty obvious.

485
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,651
I don't work until 4,
is it alright

486
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,274
if I stay around here?

487
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:30,981
Pretty noisy up at the barracks.

488
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,819
Okay.

489
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,868
Mirror mirror, on the wall.

490
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,288
Who's the fairest one of all?

491
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,542
She doesn't have any wounds
up front...

492
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:07,619
It couldn't
have been a pistol,

493
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,624
it didn't leave any exit
wounds, we know that.

494
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,082
Wonder if
she put up a fight or not.

495
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:15,635
I have no idea,
her hair looks pretty mangled.

496
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,678
She looks mangled overall.

497
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,007
He got her from behind.

498
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,093
Hey you guys know what a,

499
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:24,769
you know what made these wounds?

500
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:19,816
There isn't a reason

501
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,866
for somebody to be
out here like this

502
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:22,114
at this hour of the morning.

503
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,367
- I'm waiting until...
- This guy, his lifes over.

504
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,587
It really never, there
was never real travel

505
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:35,915
in the dream, it was just,
I was there all of a sudden,

506
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,798
and I knew I was in New
York for some reason.

507
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:41,637
- Rest in peace!
- So we just had no clue

508
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:42,805
where anything was at,

509
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,302
but we knew we had to be there...

510
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:45,883
Gall of goat and slips of yew.

511
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,969
..fo different places,
we'd eatin

512
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:51,226
bars or something.
- Rest in peace.

513
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:52,398
We bumped into that,
we kept on bumping

514
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,395
into people from my childhood...
- Peace!

515
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,022
The Charm's wound up!

516
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,194
...maybe high school, or kids
around the neighborhood.

517
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:58,646
And finally we ran into one guy,

518
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,233
and he said he had a lot
of room in his hotel, so...

519
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,109
You right now.

520
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,866
You fucking stupid motherfucker.

521
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:09,115
Fucking look at that pussy.

522
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:10,374
Look at that!

523
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:12,460
Come here!

524
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,329
It was probably his wife,

525
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:18,462
maybe it wasn't his wife,
maybe it was his sister, or...

526
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,841
It got out of hand I guess.

527
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,306
I don't know,

528
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:28,559
1 don't know how it came up...
- Rest in peace!

529
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:29,477
...we just knew each other.

530
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,897
So, we just left right away.

531
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:33,848
You know we talked to him, he said,

532
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,228
"You can stay here."
- My little spirit see.

533
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,400
We were like, "Fine."

534
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,520
She may have fought back.

535
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,907
You guess his wife or what?

536
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,242
She looks pretty small.

537
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,493
The Lord is my shepherd.
- So we finally

538
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,321
end up in the building we
were supposed to be in,

539
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,031
it was like a fever house...
- Rest in peace!

540
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,411
Goodness and
mercy shall follow me...

541
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,367
When we were walking up
there was just,

542
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,793
crowds of people walking toward us...
- With our Holy Charity.

543
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,120
-...sfraight onto us.
- Rest in peace!

544
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,461
Yeah we found him, he was

545
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:02,259
out there about 50 meters,
so we had alittle...

546
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,547
Obviously not the world's
smartest marine,

547
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:07,757
you know what I'm saying?

548
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:08,591
He give you any trouble

549
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:11,348
- Yeah.
-...when you first found him?

550
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,013
Yeah, I roughed him up a little bit.

551
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,229
1think this guy's a wise guy.

552
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:18,146
Now they're doing card tricks...

553
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,352
Thou anointeth my head with oi.

554
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,278
The other woman's just running around...
- My cup overflows.

555
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,275
...doing nick nacks and stuff.

556
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,151
The Lord is my shepherd.

557
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,358
Finally I just knew I
wasn't supposed to be there...

558
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,568
- He makes me lie down in green pastures.
-..50 I just left.

559
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,153
So that goodness and mercy
shall follow me.

560
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:30,830
And I finally made it back to the hotel room...
- Surely goodness and mercy shall.

561
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:31,826
-..and my friend from...
-..with roses...

562
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,499
-..this guy, that, we knew each other...
-...all the days of my life...

563
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,747
I shall dwell in the house of the Lord...
-...from back home or wherever

564
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,420
we knew each other.
-...Forever, Amen.

565
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:39,122
And then he was telling
us that the management

566
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,503
put more people in the
room for some reason.

567
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,710
Looks like he stabbed her a few times.

568
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,350
Huh?

569
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,606
Huh?

570
00:53:58,736 --> 00:53:59,817
They're coming
over there, they're trying

571
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,735
to figure out what's going on.

572
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:04,655
But they kinda like the
show that's going on.

573
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,198
So they're just staying with us.

574
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,196
Now we're just walking down the street.
- Rest in peace!

575
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,153
Alot of people coming with us,

576
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,737
so we didn't know what
to do, and we didn't have

577
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:12,947
any plans, but I said...

578
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,666
You fucking see this?

579
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,336
Do you fucking see this?

580
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:33,892
Huh?

581
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,267
You fucking like that don't you?

582
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:38,939
Huh?

583
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,608
Get in there.

584
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:41,934
Get in there, motherfucker.

585
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,691
- I didn't to be with them...
- Rest in peace!

586
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,568
- Rest in peace!
-..and I was trying to get away...

587
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,990
in a foggy cloud...
- Rest in peace!

588
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,778
You fucking hear me?

589
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,958
Where'd you find him?

590
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:02,038
He was over there digging
a shallow grave or something.

591
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:33,653
Stuff like that so...

592
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,237
Were they dressed up?

593
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,822
Just kinda casual,

594
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,703
just like a normal person.
- Lullaby...

595
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,410
...and goodnight...
- So they didn't have costumes?

596
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:41,494
No, not at all,
just regular jeans,

597
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,670
jacket, type of thing,

598
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,373
blue jeans, maybe slacks, and--

599
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,291
You fucking like that?

600
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,842
You fucking like that?

601
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,089
Huh?

602
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,420
You fucking like that?

603
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,097
Do you fucking like that?

604
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,675
- Surely goodness in mercy shall follow me.
-...my cup overflows...

605
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,601
I shall dwell on the house of the Lord.

606
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,554
- Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me.
-..and we came up on the back streets of...

607
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,104
He leaves me beside still waters.

608
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,024
.. Thou art with me.
-..there's a guy chewing gum...

609
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,478
- Restores my soul, my life.
- He just makes this big

610
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,563
bubble gum kite,
with all these different bubbles...

611
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,113
Do you like that?

612
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,115
Do you fucking like that?

613
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:13,534
Huh?

614
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:18,201
Get NIS on
the road, ASAP, over.

615
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,875
Roger that, out.

616
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,939
That's her blood all over?

617
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,611
It makes me sick,
boy, look at that shit.

618
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:49,607
Look at it.

619
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:51,188
Look at that shit!

620
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,371
Flinch, so I can fucking break your neck.

621
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,538
With all the blood on him...

622
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:12,002
Ithrew the wallet when
I was searching her,

623
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,837
I threw the wallet at the Captain's feet,

624
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:18,641
50 she's probably got the ID.

625
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,428
Hopefully she's got it.

626
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,388
Any ident...

627
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:25,769
What about the body?

628
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:26,974
Any ID on her?

629
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,185
-No.
- Got a ring on,

630
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,440
0 I imagine that's his wife.

631
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,440
She's bad, but...

632
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,314
He got all the violence out on her.

633
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,619
Now at this point there's just a lot...

634
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,120
- Forever.
-...of people on the streets...

635
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,793
Rest in peace!

636
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,621
... lost my friends from here.

637
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:54,085
I wonder how long
we've been out here today?

638
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:02,935
Start fucking talking!

639
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,927
Like it was just confusion,

640
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,730
like, we showed up late
for whatever it was.

641
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,733
Do you understand these rights?

642
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,199
Maybe you folks can stick around

643
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,031
for a little while and
make sure nothing comes up.

644
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:11,791
- Morning ma'am.
- Morning ma'am.

645
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,748
How about seeing some salutes?

646
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,048
Sure, ma'am.

647
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,757
How about seeing
some salutes, marines?

648
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,259
Yes, ma'am.

649
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,352
Dispatch,
dispatch...

650
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,650
- What's the word, ma'am?
-..Sergeant Little.

651
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,068
DOA.

652
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:39,611
- Roger that.
- We've got a Charlie Delta Jane Doe, over.

653
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,489
How long you guys been out here?

654
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,614
We discovered the suspect

655
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,537
at 05:50 this morning.

656
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,992
Hi, what can we do for
you this morning?

657
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:16,458
Something in the car you
might wanna check out.

658
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,678
NIS is really dragging ass.

659
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,188
Mhm.

660
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,850
Hark, I am called.

661
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:47,496
My little spirit see,
sits in a foggy cloud

662
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,406
and stays for me.

663
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:08,846
Morning, ma'am.

664
01:09:58,736 --> 01:09:59,646
Lullaby...

665
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:00,647
and goodnight,

666
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:01,728
With roses...

667
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:03,317
Lullaby...

668
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,614
With lilies...

669
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,243
Lullaby...
and goodnight...

670
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,492
Baby's sleeping...
With roses...

671
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:33,973
You make me sick.

672
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,821
You have the right to remain silent.

673
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,316
Anything you say,
can and will be used

674
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:12,616
against you in a court of law.

675
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:15,320
You have the right to talk to a lawyer

676
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,451
and have him present with you
while you're being questioned.

677
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:19,457
If you can not afford to hire a lawyer,

678
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:20,875
one will be appointed to represent you

679
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:23,579
before any questioning if you wish one.

680
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:36,136
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

681
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:38,639
He makes me lie down
in green pastures,

682
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:40,811
he leads me beside still waters.

683
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,684
He restores my soul.

684
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,311
He leads me past...

685
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,239
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

686
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,119
Thou preparest a table before me

687
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,451
in the presence of my enemies.
-...In the presence of my enemies...

688
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,162
Thou preparest a table before me

689
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:07,418
in the presence of my enemies.
-...In the presence of my enemies...

690
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:08,498
In the presence of my enemies.

691
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:11,460
I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord forever,

692
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:12,669
Amen.

693
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:14,800
Rest in peace!

694
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,677
Anything you say, questioning,

695
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:17,757
if you wish one...

696
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,058
Covered through the fog and filthy air.

697
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:22,638
With roses bedight...

698
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:37,740
Rest in peace.

699
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,446
You have the right to remain silent.

700
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:53,884
Fucking move.

701
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:55,177
In the fucking car...

702
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:57,509
Don't fucking think about moving.

703
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,182
Don't do anything fucking stupid.

704
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:13,355
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.

705
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:16,650
- Rest in peace.
- Fair is foul, and foul is fair.

706
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,155
Rest in peace!

707
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,203
- Rest in peace!
- With the hand that opens

708
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,530
and the key that locks.
-...and the key that locks.

709
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:23,490
Put him in the car!

710
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:24,665

711
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:26,242
Let's go!

712
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:27,960
Get your fucking ass up here.

Don't make a fucking stupid move.

01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,124
Let's go!

718
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:41,633
Do you see this shit?

Rest in peace!

722
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:47,976
With our Holy Chartty...

723
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:50,434
Can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

724
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:51,689
- Rest in peace!

725
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:52,940

726
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,865
You better start cooperating right now.

727
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:03,742
Who's the fairest one of all?

728
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:14,173
With roses bedight...

01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:24,385

730
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,528
You better fucking

731
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:47,119
It gives you a fucking

Come on, fucking move!

739
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:11,582
Move!

740
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,746

01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:20,208
My little spirt, see.

742
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:23,636
Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.

743
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:33,521
Right now!
Right now!

744
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,032
You better start talking.

745
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:46,484
You hear me?

746
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,240
Maybe we should

747
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,537
take this marine for a little walk.

748
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:51,705
Yes, ma'am.

749
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:06,838
-Huh?

750
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:08,423
Okay Sergeant.

751

doing in your car?

755
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:37,664
You fucking hear the Captain?

756
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:38,586
Huh?

757
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:00,729

01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,233
Don't fucking move!

761
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:07,114
Don't fucking move!

762
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,673

01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:29,463
Sweltered venom, sleeping got,

Take him down, Sergeant,
I'l cover you.

774
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,721
Peace, the charm is wound up.

775
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:34,215
Check it out Sergeant.

776
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:35,512
Yes, ma'am.

777
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,745
What's going on here, marine?

778
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,790
I said, what's going on here, marine?

779
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:06,043
Wanna tell me what you're doing out here?

780
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,333
Is that your vehicle over there?

781
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,381
Is that your vehicle?

782
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:06,429
