1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:03,800
(soft folk pop music)

2
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:27,967
- [Holly Voiceover] You know
 what really bothers me about

3
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:30,067
all those Saturday
 afternoon adventure movies

4
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:31,967
we used to see
 when we were kids?

5
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,767
They're always so
glamorous and romantic.

6
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:37,433
Everybody gets exactly
 what they want.

7
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:40,267
The hero gets the girl, they
 always find the treasure,

8
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,900
and they live
 happily ever after.

9
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,200
Sure.

10
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,167
Now let me tell you
 what really happens.

11
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,667
By the way, if you
haven't guessed by now,

12
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:49,967
that's me.

13
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:51,100
Yeah a white dove.

14
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,800
Don't be so critical.

15
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,367
This movie's got a message.

16
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:57,533
You know surrealism
 and all that stuff.

17
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,800
Yeah that's me on the altar too.

18
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,767
Jeez, get a load
of that costume.

19
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:06,267
After that experience
 I can truly say

20
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:09,433
I left my heart in the Yucatan.

21
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:11,967
Anyway, I just want to
tell you my story before

22
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:14,167
you get the wrong
 idea or read about

23
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,733
it in some supermarket tabloid.

24
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:20,500
Listen, let's go back
 to the beginning.

25
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,267
About six months ago to
where it all started.

26
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:27,867
I guess I should
 introduce myself.

27
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:30,300
My name is Holly Carlson.

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,500
I was the typical grad
 student at a small California

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,733
state university with
 a head full of dreams

30
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:39,667
and a bank account
 full of nothing.

31
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:45,333
An undistinguished
 archaeology student

32
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,967
with a taste for the good life

33
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:50,567
and a less than
 professional set of ethics.

34
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,600
Anyway, I'd run out of money

35
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,333
and was trying to figure
how to pay the rent

36
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,600
without going back
 to that waitress job

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,533
when I stumbled across an
 obscure Mayan manuscript

38
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,467
in one of my textbooks.

39
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:13,933
It set me to dreaming of
 gold, glory, and adventure.

40
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,267
Sometimes life hands
 you an easy out

41
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:20,933
as my three muses said it would.

42
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,867
No money, no job and sure enough

43
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:30,867
the only class I
 need was cancelled.

44
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:36,133
I wanted out.

45
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,733
(soft folk guitar music)

46
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:02,800
We've got to talk.

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,633
Meet me at the
 cafe three o'clock.

48
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,233
Bret knew of my
uneasiness and he wanted

49
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:20,567
to know where he stood.

50
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:23,300
(soft folk rock)

51
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,967
I shared my plans
 and dreams with Bret.

52
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,867
We both knew it was over.

53
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,767
That day we parted forever

54
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,600
but not without tears.

55
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:40,600
Sometimes love gets in the
 way of what you have to do.

56
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,267
Thanking my three muses, I
 knew that adventure called me.

57
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,667
I caught the first
flight headed to Mexico.

58
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:12,967
As a student I certainly wasn't
used to creature comforts

59
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:16,233
so the old cargo
 plane worked out fine.

60
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,500
I could almost hear
 the propellers saying

61
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,167
adventure is ahead.

62
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,767
Adventure is ahead.

63
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,067
Then with the
 vision of lost gold

64
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,200
and jungle cities,
 I began the journey

65
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,100
that would bring
 me to my destiny.

66
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,333
(soft folk music)

67
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,667
Tampico turned out
 to be a procession

68
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,500
of aimless days
 and wasted nights.

69
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,600
Until I met Lisa, my sidekick.

70
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:52,267
She was an artist, as
down on her luck as me.

71
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,700
She'd been stuck in
Mexico for three months.

72
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,267
No job, no money, no prospects.

73
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:07,833
She wandered the city
 an aimless vagabond.

74
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,333
A ship off course.

75
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,800
When I saw her sitting on
 that dusty little bench

76
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,133
near the tracks.

77
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,367
(laughs)

78
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,333
I knew our destinies
 were intertwined.

79
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:30,467
I recognized a kindred spirit.

80
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:45,600
We became friends and
 decided to search together

81
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,433
for whatever life had to offer.

82
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:51,333
In other words, we
 were on the bum.

83
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,733
- Here, have a smoke.

84
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:12,567
- Thanks.

85
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
- God it's hot!

86
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,833
- Yeah and dusty.

87
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,267
- What a town, Tampico.

88
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,267
- You said it.

89
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:35,500
If I could find me a job

90
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,533
to bring in enough to
 buy a plane ticket,

91
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:40,367
I'd shake the dust off my feet

92
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:42,567
and dump this
 crummy little town.

93
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,800
You can bet on that.

94
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,933
- Yeah well if I was a
native, I'd get me a can

95
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:50,500
of shoe polish and
 I'd be in business.

96
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,333
They'd never let
 a gringo do that.

97
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,800
God you can sit on
 a bench till you're

98
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,033
three quarters starved, you
 can beg from another American,

99
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,133
you could even commit burglary.

100
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,867
But try shining
 shoes on the street

101
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,333
or peddling lemonade
 out of a can.

102
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,800
Your hash is settled.

103
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,833
You'll never get a
 job as an American.

104
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:15,500
- Yeah the natives would
 hound and pester you to death.

105
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,133
- What a town to broke in.

106
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,633
- What town isn't?

107
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,733
- Hey mister can you stake
 a fellow American to a meal?

108
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,933
- Hey buddy want to
 buy a lottery ticket?

109
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,000
Come on.

110
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,833
Come on.

111
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,167
Play the lottery, Senorita?

112
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,433
- Beat it kid.

113
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:56,433
I ain't buying any
 lottery tickets.

114
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:57,700
Get out of here.

115
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,000
- A million pesos
 is a big prize.

116
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,067
- Get out of here
 you little beggar!

117
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:04,633
- The whole ticket
 is only 400 pesos.

118
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:05,700
It's a sure winner.

119
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,067
- I don't have spare pesos

120
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,400
for a little cholito like you.

121
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,767
- Then buy one
 quarter of a ticket

122
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,167
for only 100 pesos.

123
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:15,067
That nothing compared
 to a gringo like you.

124
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:16,500
- If you don't get out of here.

125
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,100
I'm gonna splash this
 water right in your face.

126
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,267
- Buy one tenth.

127
00:11:20,267 --> 00:11:23,067
One tenth only
 costs you 40 pesos.

128
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,733
Senorita, buy one twentieth.

129
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:30,300
One twentieth only
 costs you 20 pesos.

130
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,400
Look Senorita.

131
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,333
Add the figures up, you get 13.

132
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,467
What better luck could you buy?

133
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:36,967
It's a sure winner.

134
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:38,567
- Alright when's the drawing?

135
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,367
- Tomorrow morning,
 right after mass.

136
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,933
- Give me a
 twentieth of a ticket

137
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,133
but only so I don't have to look

138
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,500
at your sorry
 little face anymore.

139
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,767
- Es muy excellente, Senorita.

140
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:47,267
Gracias.

141
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:48,300
Come to me next time.

142
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,500
I always have the winner.

143
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,067
All the lucky
 numbers, good luck.

144
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,800
- Lucky number 13.

145
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,867
(laughs)

146
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,100
(upbeat Mexican dance music)

147
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:26,667
- Hey hey mister.

148
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:27,667
- Get a job!

149
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,967
- Hey mister.

150
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,133
(mumbles)

151
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,567
- God what a dump.

152
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:10,233
- There's probably rats and
 cockroaches in this place.

153
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,267
Well have to fit it affordable.

154
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:18,067
(speaks Spanish)

155
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,800
I know this place down the
 street called Rick's Bar.

156
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,667
Dressed like this we can
 probably get some gentlemen

157
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,233
to buy us some drinks.

158
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:31,767
- Gentlemen in this town?

159
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:32,933
Keep dreaming.

160
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,733
- Hey mister, stake a
 fellow American to a meal?

161
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,567
- Such impotence
 never came my way.

162
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,400
Earlier today I gave you money.

163
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,333
While I was having
 my shoes polished,

164
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,867
I gave you more money.

165
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,700
Now you put the
 bite on me again.

166
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,367
It's beginning to get tiresome.

167
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:49,533
Do me a favor will ya?

168
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,533
Go occasionally to someone else.

169
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:53,433
- I'm sorry mister, I
 never looked at your face.

170
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,733
Only your hands and the
money that you gave me.

171
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,233
I didn't recognize you.

172
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,433
I'm sorry, I'll never put
 the bite on you again.

173
00:13:58,433 --> 00:13:59,667
I promise.

174
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,267
- This is the very
 last you get from me.

175
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:03,500
Just to make sure you
 don't break your promise,

176
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,933
here's some more.

177
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:12,067
But from now on, you'll have
 to make your way through

178
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,233
life without my assistance.

179
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:17,367
- Thanks mister, thanks.

180
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:26,933
(upbeat instrumental music)

181
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,433
(singing in Spanish)

182
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:55,167
(humming)

183
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:05,733
- Fritz, the war is over.

184
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,067
I can get a veteran
 like you a policy

185
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:08,433
for a dollar a week.

186
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:12,800
Those Nazi war bonds
are never gonna pay off.

187
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,233
- What will it be, little lady?

188
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:15,333
Shirley Temple?

189
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,333
- Shirley Temple, black.

190
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,700
- So Sal, how was
 your last flight?

191
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,300
- Same old same old.

192
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,467
(mumbles)

193
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:34,867
Hey hombre, got an matches?

194
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:35,867
- Matches?

195
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,067
I got no matches.

196
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,067
I don't no need no matches.

197
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:42,633
I ain't gotta give you
 no stinking matches.

198
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,433
- So cowboy just
how big are you?

199
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,667
- Well ma'am, I'm six
 feet seven inches.

200
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:13,933
- Well I don't care
 about the six feet,

201
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:16,867
can we talk about
 the seven inches?

202
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,933
- [Bartender] Can I get
you another drink, bub?

203
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:28,100
- That's Beelzebub to you.

204
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:00,333
(patrons whooping)

205
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,333
- God I hope the bathrooms here

206
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,933
are better than the
 ones at the hotel.

207
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,267
Here go get a couple drinks.

208
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:20,133
- [Bartender] It's the usual.

209
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:21,400
Mescal with a worm.

210
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,167
- No, I'd like an
 orgasm this time.

211
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:49,367
- There's treasure out there,

212
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,267
out there in the jungle.

213
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:52,633
I've seen it.

214
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:54,733
I know it's there.

215
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:56,700
It's just waiting
 for the first guy

216
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,433
who's got the guts
 to take the chance.

217
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,567
That's all it takes, guts.

218
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,067
Guts.

219
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,300
What about you, little lady?

220
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
(laughs)

221
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,267
Have you got the guts
 to take a chance?

222
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:19,900
- What do you think you're
 talking about, old man?

223
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,400
- I'm talking about
 taking a chance

224
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,700
on getting a fortune.

225
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,600
I'm talking about treasure.

226
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,933
Treasures what I'm talking about

227
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,467
but it's cursed.

228
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:34,800
Cursed by the devil himself.

229
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,967
It's nothing but bad luck

230
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,167
but you wouldn't be interested.

231
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:44,200
- Hey, treasure right about now

232
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,900
I could use a little
 bit of that bad luck.

233
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,967
- It'll take some doing though.

234
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:53,067
We have to face the
 swamps and the snakes

235
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:55,533
and the fever and the Indians.

236
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,967
- Indians?

237
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:00,900
This ain't the wild west.

238
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,067
- I'm not talking about
those kind of Indians,

239
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:04,933
I'm talking about Mayans.

240
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:06,767
The jungles full of them.

241
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:10,167
Ceremonial daggers
 and virgin sacrifices.

242
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,533
They guard their treasure
 fiercely, fiercely.

243
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:18,700
- Treasure, spill
 it out old man.

244
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,900
I ain't got all day.

245
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,567
- I'm talking about gold.

246
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:26,733
Gold that the conquistadors
 left behind, I found it.

247
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,467
I know their secret.

248
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:32,567
They almost killed
 me but I got away.

249
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,333
I know their secret.

250
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,733
Mountains of gold.

251
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,600
- You got a job yet?

252
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,433
- No but I could
 sure use a drink.

253
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,400
I appreciate the help
from a fellow American.

254
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,267
Thanks for the drink.

255
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,200
- Yeah sure, anytime.

256
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,267
- My name's Holly.

257
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:09,967
Whats yours?

258
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,100
- Dobs.

259
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,967
Fred C., everyone calls me Dobs.

260
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:15,300
- Nice to meet you.

261
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,500
It is so hard to
 find work in Tampico.

262
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,867
What do you do for a living?

263
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,467
- Well I make my
 living collecting

264
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:24,300
avian specimens for
wealthy conservationists

265
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,400
back in the states.

266
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,033
- Oh you're a poacher?

267
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:30,167
- No I prefer to call myself
 a relocation specialist

268
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,667
for endangered native species.

269
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,200
- Isn't that illegal?

270
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,400
- Nothings illegal in
 Tampico if you spread

271
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,000
the wealth to the right people.

272
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:49,000
- If you've got a map,
why ain't you out there

273
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,300
finding it yourself?

274
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,700
Why you sitting in
 here like a down

275
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,900
and outer with the
 rest of these losers.

276
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,167
- It's the fever.

277
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,333
My health ain't what
 it used to be anymore

278
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,767
but with this map

279
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,633
and somebody who has the guts,

280
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,967
they can find this treasure.

281
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:12,800
All I want is 10%,
 it's all I want.

282
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:19,900
But this map it shows
 you how to get there.

283
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,633
It shows the secrets.

284
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,467
For a fair price and 10% of
 the find you can have this.

285
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:57,533
(upbeat instrumental music)

286
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,533
- [Holly Voiceover]
 So in a strange way,

287
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,533
Lisa became the
 catalyst that brought

288
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,367
my golden city closer.

289
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,567
- Look, look.

290
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,367
It's a turn around, it's a map.

291
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:18,967
It cost me every penny we had

292
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:21,300
but it's gonna make us rich.

293
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,300
- What, where did you get this?

294
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,367
- I got it from the
 old man at the bar.

295
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:28,367
He's a prospector.

296
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:30,867
Does he know about (mumbles).

297
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:32,500
- You've been had, sweetheart.

298
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,467
That old man, he's
 a scam artist.

299
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:37,567
Around here we call
 him Jungle Jim.

300
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,567
He makes his living
 selling fake artifacts

301
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,133
to dumb tourists like yourself.

302
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:46,167
This rag ain't worth the
 paper to blow your nose on.

303
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:48,967
- I can't believe you
 spent the last dollar

304
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,633
that we have in this
 world on a comic book.

305
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:53,633
We're broke.

306
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,233
We're penniless.

307
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:57,567
We're destitute.

308
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,433
Oh god I can't
 believe you did this.

309
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,133
I'm sorry, I know
 you tried to help.

310
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,767
- Well here, make
 yourself useful

311
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,833
and get us another round.

312
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:25,200
- Actually, it's a very
 good copy of an original.

313
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,933
See these glyphs right here?

314
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:30,633
They're actually described
 real Mayan cities

315
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,633
and real Mayan gold.

316
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:34,267
Maybe in an ironic
 way that old man

317
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:35,700
knew what he was talking about.

318
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,567
Have you heard any rumors?

319
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:40,067
- Sure, there's Mayan
 cities out in the jungle.

320
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:42,433
Maybe even treasure too.

321
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:44,867
In fact, a few days from here

322
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,333
I came across a temple complex

323
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,167
while I was trapping parrots.

324
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:52,067
I mean relocating avian species.

325
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:54,067
We might even find
 valuable artifacts there.

326
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:55,767
Maybe even gold

327
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,067
but for an expedition like that,

328
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:59,167
you need money and
 we don't have it.

329
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:00,400
- Yeah I know.

330
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,400
- Senorita, senorita,
 you won, you won

331
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,600
and I get 10%.

332
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,367
The seller always gives
10% to the winner.

333
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:09,600
- Get out of here
 you little brat.

334
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,967
I'm not falling for
 your phony bologna

335
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:12,500
lottery tickets anymore.

336
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,367
- If you don't you'll
 have nothing but bad luck.

337
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,167
- I'm not giving
 you any more money.

338
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,667
- Wait, if you
 shut up and listen

339
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,133
he's trying to tell you
that you're a winner.

340
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:21,567
He sold you a winning ticket.

341
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:25,733
- Wait a minute, is this it?

342
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:27,800
- Si senorita, number
 13 is a big winner

343
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,900
and I told you so.

344
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,833
The prize is 100,000 pesos.

345
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,200
- Hey the kids right.

346
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,300
I won, I won.

347
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:37,633
Come here you little
 angel and give me a kiss.

348
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:38,467
Oh my god.

349
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:42,267
Here, just take this
 with my blessings.

350
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:43,567
- Muchas gracias, senorita.

351
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:44,800
Muchas gracias.

352
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,833
You'll have nothing but
good luck from now on.

353
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:50,733
- Oh right, let's
 go get some gold.

354
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:43,100
- [Holly Voiceover]
 I played the story

355
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,433
over in my head.

356
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:48,833
Just one more time.

357
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,933
Could the muses be wrong?

358
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:56,167
- Don't worry, we'll
 find the treasure.

359
00:25:58,233 --> 00:26:00,300
Speaking of treasures,
 I know a place

360
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,667
where we can get some treasures

361
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:03,067
at a very low price.

362
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:04,800
You know what I mean?

363
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:25,633
- Hey, I could use a
 little help over here.

364
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:37,933
Don't mess with Fred
 C. Dobbs, girly.

365
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,367
The sooner we blow this
dusty burger (mumbles)

366
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:47,967
- Hey senoritas, hey
 come on look, look.

367
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,367
I have something
 for sale over here.

368
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:53,433
(soft country music)

369
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:38,067
Hey senorita
 senorita, look look.

370
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:39,267
There's a fish.

371
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:41,767
Hey senorita.

372
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:34,300
- You couldn't have hit
 just one more rut could you?

373
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:49,433
- God damn!

374
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:51,867
We're out of gas.

375
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:57,767
- Oops.

376
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:01,100
- [Holly] Can't
 believe you did that.

377
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,433
- Was I supposed to do that?

378
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,333
Oh god.

379
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:14,633
- So this is the trail
 to the lost city?

380
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:15,900
- It's the end of the line.

381
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,967
- What?

382
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:18,000
- We're out of gas.

383
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,533
From here on out we hoof it.

384
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:23,000
Take what you can carry
and leave the rest.

385
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,867
- But what about the Jeep?

386
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,533
- It doesn't matter.

387
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:30,533
See this friend that I
borrowed the Jeep from,

388
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:33,700
he doesn't exactly know
 that I borrowed the Jeep.

389
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,700
So to speak.

390
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,067
- [Holly Voiceover] The map
 was a drumbeat in my head.

391
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:50,233
Never ceasing.

392
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:52,667
Forcing me onward.

393
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,500
It beat in time to my footsteps.

394
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,900
Gold, gold, gold.

395
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:35,967
The jungle was endless.

396
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:40,733
Endless green, endless
 damp, endless heat.

397
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:54,133
- Hey, hey you guys you're
 gonna want to see this.

398
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,867
You're gonna owe
me for this one.

399
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:24,367
- [Holly Voiceover] The
 waterfall was like a vision

400
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:28,100
from heaven and we were
crying for salvation.

401
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,800
(laughs)

402
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,767
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

403
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:01,900
Take mine off.

404
00:37:26,633 --> 00:37:28,733
(laughs)

405
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:55,067
(soft romantic music)

406
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,400
- Get the lead out
 of your ass, girly.

407
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,367
This ain't no stroll
 across campus.

408
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:37,700
- Why don't you kiss my ass?

409
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:46,200
- You gotta be careful
 in these woods.

410
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,600
There's a big bad wolves out.

411
00:38:49,433 --> 00:38:51,533
(shouts)

412
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,833
Taking a short break.

413
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:17,467
You guys can do what you want.

414
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:21,167
I can sleep anywhere.

415
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:24,667
(soft instrumental music)

416
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:41,933
- You look so pale, baby girl.

417
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,200
- [Holly Voiceover]
Now the map was calling

418
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,967
to others in that jungle

419
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:16,233
but this time not for gold.

420
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:55,067
(gasps)

421
00:42:21,933 --> 00:42:24,200
- Hey enough of this
 day at the beach.

422
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,667
We got to get out of these rocks

423
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:29,567
and make some miles before
 we make camp tonight.

424
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,067
- [Holly Voiceover] That
 old drum continued to beat

425
00:43:00,533 --> 00:43:03,367
but now it was in
 Lisa's head too.

426
00:44:01,867 --> 00:44:03,633
- I don't think you
know where the hell this

427
00:44:03,633 --> 00:44:05,233
lost temple is, do you?

428
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:06,633
- Well go ahead and
 find it without me.

429
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:08,567
Without me, you'd die.

430
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:10,867
- I'm tired of this
 stinking jungle.

431
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:12,067
I think we're lost.

432
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,067
I think we should just go back.

433
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:13,867
- Go back?

434
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:14,700
Go back where?

435
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,200
We're broke.

436
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,267
By now the federales have
 found that stolen jeep.

437
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:19,667
- Just get us the
 hell out of here.

438
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:20,567
We're lost.

439
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,067
- We're this close.

440
00:44:23,067 --> 00:44:25,400
I tell ya this river
 leads right to the ruins.

441
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,933
I've traveled 100
 times chasing parrots.

442
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:30,133
- Chasing parrots?

443
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:31,633
The only thing
 you've ever chased

444
00:44:31,633 --> 00:44:34,933
is a piece of ass and a shot
 of tequila at Rick's bar.

445
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:38,767
- Wish it was your (mumbles).

446
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:50,700
- Oh if I never wear
 another backpack again

447
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,367
it will be too soon.

448
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:36,867
- [Holly Voiceover]
Feverish dreams swept me

449
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,933
into cover girl fantasies

450
00:45:40,267 --> 00:45:43,767
of modeling and fame
 in glamorous locales.

451
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:48,633
Anywhere but here.

452
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:05,600
(energetic rock music)

453
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,100
We had lost hope.

454
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,300
We had spent ourselves on a
 futile journey into nowhere

455
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,367
and now the jungle
 would demand more.

456
00:46:21,967 --> 00:46:24,900
Payment came due
 the following day.

457
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,067
(screams)

458
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:49,767
- Get back here.

459
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:50,600
Oh my god!

460
00:47:10,467 --> 00:47:12,633
- [Holly Voiceover] The
jungle, always watchful,

461
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:16,233
always unforgiving,
exacted its fatal toll.

462
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:25,300
- Help me.

463
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:46,367
- Come on, come on wake up.

464
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,700
- [Holly Voiceover] As we made
 camp that night in silence

465
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,533
we both wondered would
the jungle demand more?

466
00:48:15,733 --> 00:48:19,167
(speaking Spanish)

467
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:21,167
- Should know not to sneak
 up on a fella like that.

468
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:22,600
It ain't healthy.

469
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:26,367
I got some cigarettes.

470
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,467
- What a surprise to
 find a gringo like you

471
00:48:30,467 --> 00:48:32,967
out in the jungle alone.

472
00:48:32,967 --> 00:48:34,633
- No surprise, I'm
 hunting parrots.

473
00:48:34,633 --> 00:48:35,633
You know those pretty birds

474
00:48:35,633 --> 00:48:36,733
that bring the nice money?

475
00:48:36,733 --> 00:48:37,767
- Money?

476
00:48:37,767 --> 00:48:39,267
We need money too.

477
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,200
What's with all this
 equipment for just one man?

478
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,200
- One man.

479
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,700
I'm not alone.

480
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,433
I have friends, they're back
 there collecting firewood.

481
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:50,267
They'll back any minute.

482
00:48:50,267 --> 00:48:52,300
- That's funny we've
 been on the trail all day

483
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,400
and we've found no
footprints except yours.

484
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,067
- Well if you don't believe
 me go check for yourself.

485
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,700
There's nothing
 keeping you here.

486
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,400
- Haven't I seen you
 somewhere before?

487
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,433
- No, not me.

488
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,700
- Oh yeah?

489
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,200
I could of swore that
 canti, that gringo cantina

490
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,100
in Tampico.

491
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,967
Got anymore cigarettes?

492
00:49:19,967 --> 00:49:22,367
- Yeah back in my duffle bag.

493
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:44,800
Here.

494
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,100
Take it, I got another pack.

495
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,067
- [Holly Voiceover] I
 wanted to shout a warning

496
00:49:50,067 --> 00:49:52,300
but old instinct said hide.

497
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:54,733
- Pays real good.

498
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:56,667
- He's offering us a job.

499
00:49:56,667 --> 00:49:58,933
(laughing)

500
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,667
What you got in that
 bag, maybe money?

501
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:02,600
Maybe gold?

502
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,967
Now I remember you.

503
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:08,633
You're that gringo that was
 at that bar with that puta.

504
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:10,067
You guys bought
 the treasure map.

505
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:13,067
Maybe you got some gold
for us poor people.

506
00:50:13,067 --> 00:50:15,833
- This what I got
 for you, amigo.

507
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,633
(shouting)

508
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,367
(cheering)

509
00:50:43,567 --> 00:50:46,400
(muffled screams)

510
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,767
- [Holly Voiceover]
 When I looked up,

511
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:02,200
her presence seemed familiar.

512
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:09,900
I knew she had saved me
for something bigger.

513
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,933
My spirits were as
 gloomy as the dark jungle

514
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:28,933
as they lead me towards
my rendezvous with fate.

515
00:52:43,433 --> 00:52:46,833
Though I begged for rest,
 they walked all night

516
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:47,933
never tiring.

517
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:05,333
(upbeat instrumental music)

518
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:31,633
We emerged from the jungle

519
00:53:31,633 --> 00:53:33,167
into a small clearing,

520
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:35,600
an ancient ceremonial center.

521
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:47,600
(speaking Spanish)

522
00:53:56,467 --> 00:54:00,667
They greeted me with a
 childlike joy and curiosity.

523
00:54:02,267 --> 00:54:05,200
(speaking Spanish)

524
00:54:11,067 --> 00:54:12,933
They kept chanting,
 over and over,

525
00:54:12,933 --> 00:54:14,667
the queen, the queen.

526
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,100
(speaking Spanish)

527
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,533
(speaking Spanish)

528
00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:02,700
I was beginning to
 wonder, was I their guest

529
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,967
or an offering?

530
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,433
Now I could make the connection.

531
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:03,767
It became clear.

532
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,967
I was the white goddess
 as foretold by the codex.

533
00:56:07,967 --> 00:56:12,067
The old prospector had
 truly had found a treasure

534
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:16,767
but this time he
 wouldn't get his 10%.

535
00:56:18,433 --> 00:56:20,700
(cheering)

536
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:37,567
(low suspenseful horn music)

537
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,600
(rhythmic rattling)

538
00:58:20,533 --> 00:58:23,600
As the dance increased in tempo,

539
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,333
I felt my old life
 slipping away.

540
01:01:28,533 --> 01:01:31,367
While my heart beat to
the rhythm of the drums

541
01:01:31,367 --> 01:01:33,600
I became the white goddess.

542
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:38,433
(energetic rhythmic beating)

543
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,567
(shouting)

544
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:50,233
Like a lamb lead to
 slaughter, I ascended

545
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,467
and took my place on the altar.

546
01:03:13,133 --> 01:03:17,300
(calm ethereal
 instrumental music)

547
01:03:24,933 --> 01:03:29,100
On the wings of the drug,
 I began a fanciful flight.

548
01:03:55,933 --> 01:03:59,367
(suspenseful horn music)

549
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,567
(calm ethereal music)

550
01:04:25,267 --> 01:04:28,833
With one final toast
 I celebrated the past.

551
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:32,233
(suspenseful horn music)

552
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,333
(calm ethereal music)

553
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,767
And said goodbye to
 all the old dreams

554
01:04:53,767 --> 01:04:56,267
and then began my new journey.

555
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:06,067
(rhythmic drum music)

556
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,133
(chanting)

557
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,833
(shouting)

558
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,133
(low horn music)

559
01:06:37,233 --> 01:06:39,467
(chanting)

560
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:03,167
(shouting)
