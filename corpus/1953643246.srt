00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:07,000
[cheers and applause]

00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:15,667
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE WELCOME AZIZ ANSARI!

3
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:21,501
[cheers and applause]

00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:23,334

THANK YOU.
WHOA, WHOA.

7
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:30,968
OH, WOW.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:37,167
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,300
THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU.

11
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:44,334
I RECENTLY MOVED
TO LOS ANGELES AND, YOU KNOW,

12
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:47,167
A BIG ISSUE HERE AND EVERYWHERE
IN THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,000
IS GAY RIGHTS.

14
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,367
AND I WAS WALKING DOWN
THE STREET ONCE,

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,767
AND THIS GUY CAME UP
TO ME WITH A CLIPBOARD.

16
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,067
AND HE GOES, "HEY, MAN.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,000
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT
FOR GAY RIGHTS?"

18
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,701
AND I WENT, "SORRY, MAN.
I'M IN A LITTLE BIT OF A RUSH."

19
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:02,167
AND THEN THAT DUDE WATCHED ME
WALK INTO A JAMBA JUICE.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,667
AND HE WAS A LITTLE UPSET.

21
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:05,868
HE WAS LIKE, "REALLY, MAN?

22
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:07,868
"YOU'RE IN A RUSH TO GET
TO JAMBA JUICE?

23
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,100
I'M OUT HERE TRYING
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE."

24
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:12,968
AND I WAS LIKE,
"WELL, ACTUALLY, MAN,

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,601
"THERE'S A GUY THAT WORKS
IN THAT JAMBA JUICE

26
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:16,501
"THAT SAID SOME REALLY
HATEFUL STUFF

27
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,701
"ABOUT A CLOSE
GAY FRIEND OF MINE

28
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:19,767
AND I'M GOING
IN THERE TO STAB HIM."

29
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:21,601
[laughter]

30
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:22,434
AND THEN I PULLED OUT
TWO KNIVES

31
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:23,767
AND I TOSSED HIM ONE.

32
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:26,334
I WAS LIKE, "DO YOU HAVE
A MOMENT FOR GAY RIGHTS?

33
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:28,067
"OH, DIDN'T THINK SO.

34
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,901
"SO SIT THERE WITH YOUR LITTLE
CLIPBOARD AND JUDGE ME.

35
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:32,868
"I KILL FOR GAY PEOPLE.

36
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:35,667
I MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
YOU DON'T DO SHIT."

37
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:41,033
[laughter]

38
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,834
I ACTUALLY HAD A GAY FRIEND
OF MINE GET REAL MAD AT ME

39
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:45,901
'CAUSE OF A TEXT MESSAGE
I SENT HIM.

40
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,300
AND I LOOKED AT MY PHONE
AND I REALIZED

41
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:48,400
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

42
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:49,968
IT WAS MY PHONE'S FAULT.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,801
I GOT THAT FEATURE ON THERE
CALLED SMART TYPE,

44
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:53,868
WHERE YOU TYPE THINGS AND IT
GUESSES WHAT YOU'RE TYPING.

45
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:56,033
BUT SOMETIMES
IT GUESSES WRONG.

46
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:58,000
LIKE, YOU'LL TYPE IN "GAVE."
IT'LL GUESS "HAVE."

47
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,334
TEXTS GET MISINTERPRETED.

48
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:00,601
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

49
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:02,667
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SEND
MY GAY FRIEND GREG

50
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:05,634
WAS A TEXT THAT SAID,
"HEY, GREG.

51
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,467
"DON'T THINK I CAN COME
TO THE BAR.

52
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:10,100
TIRED.
GONNA HIT THE HAY."

53
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,968
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO SEND.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,834
BUT WHAT SMART TYPE DECIDED
TO SEND WAS, "HEY, GREG.

55
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:17,601
"DON'T THINK I CAN COME
TO THE BAR. TIRED.

56
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:19,767
GONNA HIT THE HAY, YOU FAGGOT.
FUCK YOU."

57
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:21,334
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

58
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:23,601
SMART TYPE, THAT AIN'T
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY!

59
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:25,501
WHY YOU GETTING
ALL HOMOPHOBIC ON ME?

60
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:27,801
GREG'S GONNA PISSED OFF
ABOUT THAT TEXT!

61
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:30,968
[laughter]

62
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:33,634
NOW MY WHOLE TAKE ON, YOU KNOW,
THE GAY RIGHTS ISSUES,

63
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,033
PARTICULARLY GAY MARRIAGE IS--
LET'S BE HONEST.

64
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:38,234
IF YOU'RE AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE,
YOU JUST DON'T LIKE GAY PEOPLE,

65
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:39,801
AND YOU WANT
TO STICK IT TO 'EM.

66
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,734
AND I'M NOT SAYING I WOULDN'T
DO THE SAME THING

67
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:44,067
IF I WAS PRESENTED
WITH SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES.

68
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,234
LIKE IF THERE WAS A LAW UP
FOR DEBATE WHERE IT WAS LIKE,

69
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,701
"HEY, MAN, YOU THINK GUYS THAT
WEAR TIGHT T-SHIRTS

70
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,200
"AND GET BOTTLE SERVICE
AT NIGHTCLUBS SHOULD

71
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:51,667
BE ALLOWED TO OWN PROPERTY?"

72
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:53,000
I'D BE LIKE, "NO!
FUCK THOSE GUYS!"

73
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:54,901
HA-HA-HA-HA!

74
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:57,300
YEAH, UM...

75
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:58,901
IT VIOLATES THE SANCTITY
OF OWNING PROPERTY

76
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:00,434
AND IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE
THEY'RE DOUCHEBAGS.

77
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:02,000
WHATEVER I NEED TO SAY
SO YOU DON'T THINK

78
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:03,968
THIS IS COMING FROM PURELY
A PLACE OF HATE.

79
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:08,267
[laughter]

80
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,934
I WAS GETTING SOME SHEETS DOWN
AT BED BATH & BEYOND.

81
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:14,968
MAN, THEY GOT SO MANY SHEETS!

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,968
I WAS LOOKING AROUND
AND I SAW THIS GUY

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,133
AND HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO BUY,
AND HE LOOKED ALL CONFUSED.

84
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,367
AND HE LOOKS OVER
AT ME AND GOES,

85
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,701
"MAN, THIS IS WHY
I NEED A GIRLFRIEND."

86
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:27,367
AND I WAS LIKE,
"REALLY?

87
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,100
THIS IS WHY YOU NEED
A GIRLFRIEND?"

88
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,501
SO IF YOU HAD A GIRLFRIEND,
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE.

89
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:33,534
YOU'D BE BACK AT YOUR HOUSE
SITTING ON A LA-Z-BOY,

90
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:36,534
DRINKING A BEER, GOING,
"BITCH, GO GET ME SOME SHEETS!

91
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:39,367
"YEAH, I'M IN
A RELATIONSHIP NOW!

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,567
"I DON'T HAVE TO BUY
MY OWN DOMESTIC GOODS!

93
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:43,567
"PICK UP ONE OF THOSE BOTTLES
WE CAN PUT STICKS IN

94
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,801
"AND MAKE THE ROOM
SMELL LIKE VANILLA BEAN.

95
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,000
"I BEEN FARTING ALL DAY.

96
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:48,901
IT SMELLS LIKE SHIT
IN HERE!"

97
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:51,834
[laughter]

98
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:55,834
NOW ALL I KNOW
ABOUT SHEETS IS...

99
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,968
THE HIGHER THE THREAD COUNT,
THE BETTER THE SHEET, RIGHT?

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,501
THIS LADY'S LIKE,
"RIGHT. YEAH.

101
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,234
"I GOT 700 BACK AT MY HOUSE.

102
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:05,334
IT'S LIKE SLEEPING
IN LOTION."

103
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:07,734
SO I'M LOOKING AROUND,
TRYING TO FIND SOME NICE SHEETS.

104
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:10,234
I SEE THIS BRAND CALLED
HOTEL LUXURY LINENS.

105
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:12,000
600-THREAD COUNT.

106
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:14,033
THAT SOUNDS FANCY TOO, RIGHT?

107
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:17,701
GOT A GIRL BACK AT YOUR PLACE,
SHE'S LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.

108
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:20,534
DID WE JUST TELEPORT
TO A FIVE-STAR HOTEL?"

109
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,634
NAH, BABY.

110
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:23,300
THESE ARE JUST HOTEL
LUXURY LINENS.

111
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:25,801
BY THE WAY, THE TECHNOLOGY
FOR TELEPORTATION

112
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,000
DOESN'T EXIST YET.

113
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,133
YOU MUST BE KIND OF STUPID.

114
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:32,467
SO I GRABBED THE SHEETS
AND I GET 'EM HOME.

115
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:35,200
AND I'M PSYCHED
TO PUT 'EM ON MY BED, RIGHT?

116
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,300
AND I FEEL 'EM AND THEY FEEL
A LITTLE ROUGH TO THE TOUCH.

117
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:40,000
I GET A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.

118
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:41,601
I DO A LITTLE GOOGLING.

119
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:43,467
I FIND AN
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT

120
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:46,234
IN SOUTHERN LIVING MAGAZINE,
 WHERE THEY INVESTIGATED

121
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,634
THREAD COUNT CLAIMS,
AN ISSUE THAT DEFINITELY

122
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,834
NEEDED DELVING INTO.

123
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:54,834
AND THEY HAD A LITTLE CHART,
AND IT SAID "BRAND,

124
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:58,167
ADVERTISED THREAD COUNT,
ACTUAL THREAD COUNT."

125
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,567
SO IT'S LIKE,
"BRAND, WAMSUTTA.

126
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:02,400
"ADVERTISED, 500.
ACTUAL, 497.

127
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:04,601
"BRAND, SOFT SHEETS.
ADVERTISED, 600.

128
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:06,234
"ACTUAL, 600.

129
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:08,400
"BRAND, HOTEL LUXURY LINENS.

130
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:11,634
"ADVERTISED, 600.

131
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,300
296!"

132
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:15,067
ARE YOU SHITTIN' ME,
MAN?

133
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,300
I ALMOST SLEPT
ON THAT SHIT!

134
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:20,534
296 IS SANDPAPER
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

135
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,534
IF THAT WAS A DRUG DEAL,
I WOULD HAVE SHOT

136
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,534
HOTEL LUXURY LINENS
IN THE FACE.

137
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:25,767
WHERE THE REST
OF MY THREADS?

138
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:26,767
[imitates gunshot]

139
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:27,968
YOU DIDN'T THINK
I WAS GONNA

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,133
COUNT THAT SHIT,
MOTHERFUCKER?

141
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:33,734
[laughter and applause]

142
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:44,801
I WAS DOWN AT CVS,
AND I HAD

143
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:48,167
A RATHER ODD ASSORTMENT
OF ITEMS I NEEDED TO GET.

144
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,334
I HAD TO GET A LITER
OF JACK DANIELS,

145
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:55,000
A TWO-LITER BOTTLE
OF COCA-COLA,

146
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:57,234
A BOX OF CONDOMS,

147
00:05:57,267 --> 00:06:01,634
AND A TEN-PACK
OF BLANK CDR DISCS.

148
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,400
AND I THOUGHT IT'D BE AWESOME
IF EVERY MORNING

149
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,334
I WENT AND BOUGHT
THOSE SAME FOUR THINGS

150
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,667
FOR, LIKE,
SIX MONTHS,

151
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,734
JUST TO DEVELOP THIS REALLY
WEIRD REPUTATION

152
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,067
WITH THE STAFF THERE,
WHERE THEY'D BE LIKE,

153
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,901
"HOLD ON A SECOND, MAN.

154
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:16,601
"THIS GUY DRINKS A LITER
OF JACK AND COKE EVERY DAY.

155
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:19,734
"HAS SEX 12 TIMES A DAY.

156
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:21,934
"AND THEN BURNS

00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:23,634
"TEN BLANK CDs?

00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:25,801
"10 DISCS,

160
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:28,467

00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,167
"AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,701
"IS HE BURNING MUSIC?

"WOULDN'T IT MAKE MORE SENSE

00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:35,434
"MAYBE HE'S MAKING MIXED CDs
FOR ALL THESE GIRLS

165
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:36,801
"THAT HE'S FUCKIN'.

166
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,467
"TWO OF THOSE GIRLS AIN'T
GETTING CDs THOUGH.

167
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:40,434
"WHICH TWO ARE THOSE?

168
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,534
WHICH TWO DON'T
GET THE CDs?"

169
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:48,467
[laughter]

170
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,667
I GOT TO TRAVEL A LOT
WHEN I'M DOING STAND-UP,

171
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,467
AND I WAS ON A FLIGHT
ONE TIME

172
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:54,434
AND I HAD A LITTLE BIT
OF A RUNNY NOSE.

173
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:56,434
AND SO I WENT LIKE THIS...
[sniffs]

174
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:58,033
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THE GUY NEXT TO ME GOES,

175
00:06:58,067 --> 00:06:59,667
"HEY, MAN!

176
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:00,968
"YOU GONNA BLOW YOUR NOSE,
OR AM I GONNA

177
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,267
"HAVE TO LISTEN
TO YOU HAVE THE SNIFFLES

178
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,801
FOR SIX FUCKING HOURS?"

179
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:06,801
AND I WAS STUNNED
FOR TWO REASONS.

180
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:10,334
ONE, I COULDN'T BELIEVE HE'D
BE SO RUDE TO A TOTAL STRANGER.

181
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,734
AND TWO, I NEVER HEARD
THE WORD "SNIFFLES"

182
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,667
AND "FUCKING" IN THE SAME
SENTENCE TOGETHER BEFORE.

183
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,801
[laughter and applause]

184
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:19,767
[chuckles]

185
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:24,567
CLAP IF YOU USE CRAIGSLIST.

186
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,567
[cheers and applause]

187
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:27,767
HOLD ON A SECOND THOUGH.

188
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:29,100
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LIKE,
"OH, HEY,

189
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,300
I'M LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT,"
CRAIGSLIST.

190
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:31,634
I'M TALKING ABOUT,
"GIVE ME A HANDJOB,

191
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,167
I'LL GIVE YOU
MY COFFEE TABLE."

192
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,868
LIKE THAT KIND OF CRAIGSLIST.

193
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:38,467
THAT'S CRAIGSLIST.

194
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:39,968
I SAW A POST LIKE
THAT ONCE

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,968
WHERE THIS GUY WAS TRYING
TO SELL CONCERT TICKETS

196
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,501
AND THIS IS WHAT
HE POSTED UP THERE.

197
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:46,200
HE GOES, "WILLING
TO GIVE UP TWO TICKETS

198
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:48,000
"FOR THE SOLD-OUT
SHOW TONIGHT.

199
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,767
"MUST BE FEMALE,

00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:56,801

00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,701

204
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:02,801
[laughter]

205
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:05,601
NOW THAT GUY'S INSANE
AND YOU CAN TELL,

206
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:06,667
'CAUSE HE PUT THAT PHRASE
IN THERE.

207
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:08,501
"MUST REMOVE SHIRT AND BRA."

208
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:09,934
'CAUSE THAT IMPLIES
HE'S DONE THIS IN THE PAST

209
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,501
AND THE GIRL WAS LIKE,
"HOLD ON!

210
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,467
YOU DIDN'T SAY NOTHING ABOUT MY
SHIRT AND BRA COMING OFF."

211
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,067
HE'S LIKE, "DAMN, I GOTTA
REMEMBER TO PUT THAT

212
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,300
"IN THE AD NEXT TIME.

213
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:18,400
I WANT TO SEE SOME TITTIES."

214
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:22,634
[laughter and applause]

215
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,334
AND THEN HE ACTS LIKE HE'S
THROWING YOU A BONE

216
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,567
BY PUTTING THAT PHRASE
IN THERE.

217
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:27,133
"YOUR FRIEND CAN
BE THERE FOR SECURITY."

218
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:28,834
REALLY?

219
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:30,434
WELL, THAT'S GONNA BE
A TOUGH FAVOR TO ASK FOR.

220
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,834
"HEY, DENISE.

221
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:34,968
"YEAH, IT'S ME, CAROL.

222
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,033
"LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

223
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:40,968
"YOU EVER DONE
ANY SECURITY WORK BEFORE?

224
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,133
"WELL,
IT'S NOTHING TOO CRAZY,

225
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,868
"BUT I'M GONNA
BE BLOWING THIS GUY

226
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:48,000
"FOR A HALF HOUR

00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:50,000
"AND I JUST NEED YOU
TO SIT IN THE BACK SEAT

00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:53,100
"AND MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T
DO ANYTHING SKETCHY.

229
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,167
"BY THE WAY, YOU MIND HOLDING
MY SHIRT AND BRA?

230
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,601
THOSE WILL BE OFF!"

231
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:58,834
[laughter]

232
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:00,701
NOW, I WENT TO THAT CONCERT.

233
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,534
I GOT TICKETS IN ADVANCE
AND I GOT THERE

234
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,133
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SAW?

235
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:06,767
THEY WERE SELLING EXTRA TICKETS
AT THE DOOR.

236
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:09,701
SELLING EXTRA TICKETS
AT THE DOOR!

237
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:13,634
COULD YOU IMAGINE BLOWING
A GUY FOR A HALF HOUR

238
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,901
FOR SOLD-OUT CONCERT TICKETS AND
THEN FINDING OUT

239
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:17,801
THEY'RE SELLING THEM
AT THE DOOR?

240
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,834
THAT'D BE LIKE BLOWING A GUY
FOR A HALF HOUR

241
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:21,767
FOR SOLD-OUT CONCERT TICKETS
AND THEN FINDING OUT

242
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:23,501
THEY'RE SELLING 'EM
AT THE DOOR.

243
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:25,734
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
TO COMPLETE THAT ANALOGY

244
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,000
'CAUSE THAT'S THE SHITTIEST
THING THAT COULD EVER

245
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,300
HAPPEN TO YOU.

246
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,267
[laughter and applause]

247
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:37,968
ONE THING THAT SCARES ME ABOUT,
LIKE, CRAIGSLIST AND STUFF

248
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,801
IS THAT PEOPLE GO ON THERE AND
THEY FIND RANDOM ROOMMATES.

249
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:42,667
THAT'S A TERRIFYING
PROPOSITION TO ME.

250
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:44,167
LIKE, THE ONE TIME I HAD
A RANDOM ROOMMATE,

251
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,968
IT DID NOT GO WELL.

252
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,434
LIKE, I WOULD COME
IN THE ROOM

253
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:48,834
AND IT'D ALWAYS SMELL
LIKE TUNA.

254
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:50,267
AND I'D BE LIKE,
"WHOA!

255
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,667
"NOT IN MY TOP FIVE SMELLS
FOR THE ROOM TO HAVE.

256
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:54,367
WHY'S IT ALWAYS SMELL
LIKE TUNA?"

257
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,200
AND IT'S 'CAUSE THIS GUY
WILL EAT CANS

258
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:57,767
OF STARKIST TUNA
ALL THE TIME.

259
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:59,000
AND YOU KNOW ALL THE JUICES
THERE AT THE BOTTOM

260
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,501
WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED?

261
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:02,868
HE'D SHOOT THE JUICE BACK
LIKE A TEQUILA SHOT.

262
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:05,834
YES, I AGREE
IT'S DISGUSTING.

263
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:07,133
IF YOU'D APPROACHED ME
ON THE STREET LIKE,

264
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,534
"HEY, AZIZ.

265
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,701
"WHAT'S THE MOST
DISGUSTING THING

266
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,100
YOU CAN CATCH YOUR
NEW ROOMMATE DOING?"

267
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:12,601
I'D BE LIKE,
"DRINKING THE TUNA JUICE

268
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,167
AT THE BOTTOM
OF A STARKIST TUNA CAN."

269
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,868
THEY'D BE LIKE, "MAN, THAT'S
A REALLY SPECIFIC ANSWER."

270
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,067
THERE'S OTHER THINGS LIKE
HE PLAYED THE FLUTE

271
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,367
ALL THE TIME.

272
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,901
NOTHING WRONG
WITH PLAYING THE FLUTE,

273
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:23,901
BUT HE'D ONLY PLAY
ONE SONG ON THE FLUTE.

274
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:26,501
CELINE DION'S 
 MY HEART WILL GO ON,

275
00:10:26,534 --> 00:10:28,567
THE THEME SONG TO TITANIC.

276
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:31,300
IF YOU'D APPROACH ME
ON THE STREET LIKE, "HEY, AZIZ,

277
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:32,701
"WHAT'S THE MOST
ANNOYING SONG A DUDE

278
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:35,200
COULD PLAY ON THE FLUTE
ALL THE TIME?"

279
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,334
I'D BE LIKE, "CELINE DION'S 
 MY HEART WILL GO ON,

280
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,067
THE THEME SONG TO TITANIC."

281
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,567
AND YOU'D BE LIKE,
"GOD DAMN,

282
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:44,067
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD
AT THIS GAME."

283
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,567
BUT THE CRAZIEST THING
WAS TOWARDS

284
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:46,901
THE END OF OUR TIME
TOGETHER.

285
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:48,868
HE WAS ACTING REALLY WEIRD
AND I DIDN'T KNOW

286
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:50,300
WHAT WAS GOING ON,
SO I ASKED A FRIEND OF HIS.

287
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:51,767
I WAS LIKE, "HEY, MAN,
WHAT'S UP WITH THIS GUY?"

288
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:53,534
AND HE GOES,
"OH...

289
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,734
"HE THINKS
HE'S POSSESSED

290
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:59,667
BY SCAR, THE EVIL LION FROM 
 THE LION KING MOVIES."

291
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:03,968
OH, YES!
THAT HAPPENS! SURE!

292
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,868
IF YOU'D APPROACHED ME
ON THE STREET LIKE, "HEY, AZIZ.

293

HE'S POSSESSED BY?"

295
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:14,634
I'D BE LIKE, "SCAR, THE EVIL
LION FROM THE LION KING MOVIES."

296
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:15,868
AND YOU'D BE LIKE...

299
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:23,200
[laughter and applause]

300
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:25,534
NOW...

301
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,834
I HAVE A SMALL UPDATE
ON THAT JOKE.

302
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:32,000
I WAS LOOKING AROUND
ON THE INTERNET ONE DAY,

303
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:34,667
AND I SAW THIS BLOG
HAD WRITTEN ABOUT ME.

304
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:37,133
I LOOKED IN THE COMMENTS THREAD
AND SOME GUY HAD WRITTEN,

305
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:39,634
"I LIVED WITH THIS GUY.
HE'S A DOUCHEBAG."

306
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,133
IT WAS THAT FUCKING GUY!

307
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,200
OH, REALLY?
I'M A DOUCHEBAG, HUH?

308
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:45,501
WELL, YOU DON'T TELL ALL
THESE PEOPLE ABOUT

309
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:47,033
HOW YOU DID TUNA JUICE SHOTS
ALL DAY.

310

[imitates flute playing]

311
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:51,467
OH, YOU DON'T TALK
ABOUT THAT.

312
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:52,567
YOU JUST SAY
I'M A DOUCHEBAG.

313
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,400
WELL, IF I'M A DOUCHEBAG,

314
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:55,701
THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

315
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:57,734
I'M GONNA FIND OUT WHERE
THAT GUY LIVES, RIGHT?

316
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,400
I'M GONNA GO OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE,
LIKE, OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW

317
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:00,834
REAL LATE AT NIGHT,
RIGHT?

318
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:02,200
AND WAIT TILL IT'S,
LIKE, REALLY LATE

319
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:04,100
AND I'M JUST GONNA GO,

LEAVE ME ALONE!"

324
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,934
WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE IS JUST
WENT ON THE COMMENTS THREAD

325
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:19,868

00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,334
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
RECOGNIZE ME FROM THINGS

00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:39,868
THEY'VE SEEN ME ON TV

SO I'D KIND OF JUST GO,
"COOL, MAN.

336
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,734
GLAD YOU LIKE THE SHOW,"
AND I'D JUST KEEP WALKING.

337
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,801
AND THIS ONE GUY SAID
SOMETHING TO ME ONE TIME

338
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,868
AND I WENT, "COOL, MAN.
GLAD YOU LIKE THE SHOW."

339
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,467
AND THEN RIGHT WHEN I WALKED
PAST HIM, I REALIZED,

340
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,868
"OH, MAN, THAT GUY DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THE SHOW."

341
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,801
HE WENT, "HEY, MAN,
YOUR FLY'S DOWN."

342
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:01,000
AND I WENT, "COOL, MAN.
GLAD YOU LIKE THE SHOW.

343
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:04,000
"GLAD YOU LIKE SEEING MY DICK
POP OUT OF MY PANTS.

344
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,934
COME BACK NEXT WEEK,
YOU CAN SEE ONE OF MY BALLS."

345
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:10,501
[laughter]

346
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:12,767
I WENT TO A COOL SHOW
IN NEW YORK ONCE

347
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:15,167
CALLED WALKING WITH DINOSAURS.

348
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,801
AND IT WAS THIS THING
WHERE THEY HAD THESE, LIKE,

349
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,434
ANIMATRONIC DINOSAURS THAT
WOULD, LIKE, WALK AROUND.

350
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:20,033
IT WAS REALLY COOL.

351
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,701
BUT I WAS THE ONLY PERSON THERE
REALLY IN MY AGE GROUP.

352
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,167
IT WAS MOSTLY, LIKE,
LITTLE KIDS AND THEIR PARENTS.

353
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
AND I WAS BORED WAITING
FOR THE SHOW TO START,

354
00:13:27,234 --> 00:13:28,801
SO I STARTED TALKING
TO THIS LITTLE KID NEXT TO ME,

355
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,033
AND HE WAS PRETTY COOL.

356
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:31,434
HE WAS, LIKE,
MAYBE EIGHT, TEN YEARS OLD.

357
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:33,100
WE HAD A LOT IN COMMON THOUGH,
YOU KNOW?

358
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,334
LIKE, WE BOTH PLAYED 
 CALL OF DUTY 4 ON THE XBOX.

359
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,667
WE BOTH REALLY
HAD SIMILAR THEORIES

360
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:40,033
ABOUT WHAT WAS REALLY
GOING ON ON LOST.

361
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:43,734
AND HE WAS JUST A COOL KID.

362
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,901
AND EVENTUALLY HIS DAD WAS LIKE,
"HEY, BRIAN,

363
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:47,300
"I'M GONNA GO MAKE
A COUPLE PHONE CALLS.

364
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:48,300
"YOU THINK YOU'LL
BE ALL RIGHT HERE

365
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:49,167
TALKING TO YOUR NEW FRIEND?"

366
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,801
HE'S LIKE, "OKAY, DAD."

367
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:54,133
AND THE DAD LEAVES FOR, LIKE,
A REALLY LONG TIME.

368
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,701
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
A CHILD MOLESTER AT ALL.

369
00:13:57,734 --> 00:13:59,200
BUT IF I WAS,
I'D HAVE BEEN LIKE,

370
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:01,567
"SOMEBODY'S DOING
SOME MOLESTIN' TONIGHT!

371
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:03,467
"LET'S DO THIS SHIT,
BRIAN!

372
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:06,000
"YOUR DAD DOESN'T
GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU!

373
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:07,834
"HE LEFT YOU ALONE
WITH A GROWN MAN

374
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:11,601
"WITH A FULL BEARD
AT WALKING WITH DINOSAURS!

375
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,634
"CLEARLY
I'M OUT HERE SCOUTING

376
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,601
AND YOU ARE MY MAN!"

377
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:21,200
[laughter and applause]

378
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:23,200
I'M JUST SAYING
I COULD HAVE FUCKED THAT KID.

379
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:27,167
[laughter]

380
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,701
I'M ORIGINALLY
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, AND--

381
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:35,834
[scattered cheers]

382
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:37,501
THANK YOU.

383
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:39,267
AND MY BROTHER
SENT ME SOMETHING

384
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,334
THAT REALLY REMINDED ME OF HOW
CRAZY IT IS DOWN THERE.

385
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:44,200
IT WAS A PROMO VIDEO
FOR THIS THING CALLED

386
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:45,968
"THE SIMPLE MAN CRUISE."

387
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,734
AND THIS IS THIS CRUISE SHIP
WHERE THEY GET

388
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:50,033
ALL THESE SOUTHERN ROCK BANDS
LIKE .38 SPECIAL,

389
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,501
THE MARSHALL TUCKER BAND,
LYNYRD SKYNYRD

390
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:53,701
AND THEY THROW 'EM ON A BOAT.

391
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:55,300
ALL THESE REDNECKS
GET ON BOARD,

392
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:58,801
THEY SET OUT TO SEA,
AND IT'S SCARY AS SHIT!

393
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:02,300
'CAUSE I'VE NEVER SEEN REDNECKS
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

394
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,334
I LIVED IN SOUTH CAROLINA
FOR 18 YEARS.

395
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,100
NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THIS.

396
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:07,567
THIS ONE DUDE GETS ON
THE SCREEN, HE'S LIKE,

397
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:08,834
"AW, HELL, MAN.

398
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:10,467
"YOU CAN SWING
A DEAD CAT AROUND HERE,

399
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,434
YOU BOUND TO HIT
A GOOD GUITAR PLAYER."

400
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,801
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN?

401
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:18,133
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I LIKE
THE WAY THIS GUY TALKS.

402
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,801
I WANT HIM TO REVIEW EVERYTHING
FOR ME IN MY LIFE.

403
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:22,767
LIKE WHEN I NEED AN OPINION,
I'LL GO TO HIM.

404
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:24,033
I'LL BE LIKE,
"HEY, MAN, I WAS THINKING

405
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:25,167
"ABOUT BUYING SOME CDs
AT THAT MUSIC STORE

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,501
"DOWN ON, LIKE, SUNSET.

00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:27,634
IS THAT A GOOD PLACE
TO BUY MUSIC?"

408
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:28,767
"AW, HELL, MAN.

409
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:29,968
"YOU CAN GO IN THERE

00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,434
"BUT THAT'S EASY

A BISCUIT."

415
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,934
[laughter]

416
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:42,467
OKAY, MAN.

417
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:43,634
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
BUYING A PRIUS.

418
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,300
IS THAT A GOOD CAR TO GET?

419
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,634
"AW, MAN,
HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

420
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,868
"RUN DOWN TO THE WOODS,

00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:54,300
"'I DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT CARS.

425
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:55,534
"I'M JUST A POSSUM.'

00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:56,734
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,
YEAH."

427
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,067
[laughter]

428
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,467
UH, HEY, MAN.

429
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,634
I WAS SEEING
ABOUT BUYING AN LCD TV.

430
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,934
IS IT A GOOD TIME
TO BUY AN LCD TV?

431
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:05,667
"HERE'S WHAT
YOU NEED TO DO, MAN.

437
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:20,234
[laughter]

438
00:16:20,267 --> 00:16:22,133
HOW MANY OF YOU GUYS--

439
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,167
CLAP IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T SEEN
 THE DARK KNIGHT YET.

440
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,267
IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T SEEN 
 THE DARK KNIGHT, CLAP.

441
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,634
[sparse clapping]

442
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:29,167
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

443
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,367
THAT MOVIE'S INCREDIBLE!

444
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,767
MY FAVORITE REVIEW
OF THAT MOVIE

445
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:35,334
IS FROM MY LITTLE
COUSIN HARRIS

446
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,200
THAT'S 14 YEARS OLD
AND LIVES IN GEORGIA.

447
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:39,834
AND I LOVE HARRIS 'CAUSE
HE HAS REALLY ODD CHOICES

448
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,334
IN ENTERTAINMENT.

449
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,601
LIKE, HIS FAVORITE TV SHOWS
ARE HOUR-LONG DRAMAS

450
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:45,968
ON USA AND TNT.

451
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,334
LIKE, YOU KNOW HOW
YOU SEE BILLBOARDS

452
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:48,868
FOR SHOWS LIKE BURN NOTICE.

453
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,033
YOU'RE LIKE, "WHO THE HECK
WATCHES BURN NOTICE?"

454
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,367
HARRIS WATCHES BURN NOTICE!

455
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,100
HE LOVES IT!

456
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,167
HARRIS TOLD ME HIS SENIOR
QUOTE'S GONNA BE,

457
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,667
"TNT KNOWS DRAMA."

458
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,234
YOU CALL UP HARRIS,
YOU HEAR THINGS LIKE,

459
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:01,400
"HEY, HARRIS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?"

460
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:02,834
"I'M PISSED OFF, MAN!

461
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,834
"MY DAD JUST ERASED
ALL MY SHOWS FROM THE DVR.

462
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:07,167
GUESS I WON'T FIND OUT WHAT
HAPPENS ON LAS VEGAS THIS WEEK."

463
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,767
WHO DVRs LAS VEGAS?

464
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:11,968
JOSH DUHAMEL DOESN'T DVR 
 LAS VEGAS.

465
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
AND YOU DON'T GET THAT JOKE,
'CAUSE JOSH DUHAMEL'S

466
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,567
THE STAR OF LAS VEGAS, 
AND NOBODY WATCHES LAS VEGAS!

467
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:20,267
[laughter and applause]

468
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,334
SO I ASKED HARRIS--
I'M LIKE, "HEY, HARRIS.

469
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:22,501
YOU LIKE THE DARK KNIGHT?"

470
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:23,667
"YEAH."

471
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:24,734
"IS IT BETTER
THAN BURN NOTICE?"

472
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:25,834
"YEAH."

473
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:26,667
"IS IT BETTER THAN LAS VEGAS?"

474
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:28,334
"YEAH."

475
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:29,634
"IS IT BETTER THAN
EATING AT CINNABON?"

476
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,934
"NO."

477
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,634
HEY, I KNEW THAT WOULD
GET HIM,

478
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:33,934
'CAUSE HE'S A LITTLE
CHUBBY GUY AND HE LOVES

479
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:35,601
SHOVING CINNABONS
INTO HIS LITTLE CHUBBY FACE.

480
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:37,701
[muttering]

481
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:39,300
AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT HIM!

482
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:41,334
I LOVE THAT HE'S CHUBBY.

483
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:43,634
'CAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT
OF CHUBBY LITTLE INDIAN KIDS.

484
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,534
MOST OF THEM ARE SMALL
AND SKINNY LIKE ME,

485
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:46,667
BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN
YOU SEE A CHUBBY ONE

486
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:48,033
AND IT'S AWESOME!

487
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,534
IT'S KIND OF LIKE SEEING
A SHOOTING STAR

488
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,434
ONLY IT'S FAT, BROWN,
AND ON THE GROUND.

489
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:56,834
[laughter]

490
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,033
I'VE FOUND HARRIS TO
BE MOST ENTERTAINED AT ME

491
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:01,234
WHEN HE'S REALLY
ANGRY AT ME.

492
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,601
AND I FOUND THE QUICKEST WAY
TO GET HIM ANGRY

493
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:05,601
IS TO FUCK
WITH HIM ON FACEBOOK.

494
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,601
HE DOES NOT LIKE IT.

495
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,767
HE'S GOT HIS LITTLE UPDATES
METICULOUSLY PLANNED LIKE,

496
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:11,634
"HARRIS JUST BECAME
A BIG FAN OF WILL SMITH."

497
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:15,734
AND I'LL WRITE UP THERE,
"FUCK WILL SMITH."

498
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:19,767
AND HE'LL BE LIKE,
"WHY DID YOU DO THAT?"

499
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:23,400
AND SO ONE TIME I NOTICED
HE WAS POSTING A LOT

500
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:26,968
ON A STUDY GROUP
FOR HIS WORLD HISTORY CLASS.

501
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,400
AND I WAS LIKE,
"I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO.

502
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:30,801
"I'LL JOIN THE STUDY GROUP.

503
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,434
"I'LL WRITE ALL THIS DUMB
SHIT ON THERE,

504
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:33,834
"HARRIS WILL GET
REALLY PISSED,

505
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:35,234
AND IT'LL BE AWESOME."

506
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:38,934
AND THAT'S EXACTLY HOW
THAT SHIT WENT DOWN!

507
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:40,767
AS SOON AS I STARTED POSTING,
I STARTED GETTING

508
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:42,767
ALL THESE, LIKE,
ANGRY I.M.s FROM HARRIS.

509
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:44,934
HE'S LIKE, "HEY, MAN, YOU NEED
TO GET OFF THE BOARDS."

510
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:46,367
AND I WAS LIKE, "WHY?"

511
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,934
HE'S LIKE, "THE ADMINS
ARE GETTING ON MY CASE."

512
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:52,100
AND HE POSTS THIS CONVERSATION
HE HAD WITH THE ADMIN,

513
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:54,367
WHERE THE ADMIN'S LIKE,
"HEY, HARRIS, WHO'S AZIZ?"

514
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,467
HE'S LIKE, "MY COUSIN.
WHY DO YOU ASK?"

515
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:58,000
HE GOES, "HE'S POSTING
ON A.P. WORLD WALL.

516
00:18:58,033 --> 00:18:59,534
DO YOU KNOW WHAT PERIOD
HE HAS A.P. WORLD?"

517
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:02,601
AND HARRIS WRITES IN ALL CAPS,
"NO!

518
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:04,767
YOU GOT TO BOOT HIM NOW!"

519
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:07,200
WITH, LIKE, 30 "O"s,
30 "W"s,

520
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:09,634
AND 50 EXCLAMATION POINTS.

521
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,701
AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE STARTING
TO GET SUSPICIOUS

522
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,400
OF MY PRESENCE
ON THE BOARD AS WELL.

523
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:15,501
MAYBE BECAUSE I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE IN THE NINTH GRADE

524
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:18,968
AND I HAVE A FULL BEARD.

525
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,133
BUT I'M TRYING TO ACT
LIKE I BELONG, RIGHT?

526
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:22,767
THAT I'M IN THE CLASS
AND I KNOW WHAT'S UP.

527
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:24,667
SO THERE WAS, LIKE,
A CONTROVERSY

528
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:25,901
ABOUT THIS ONE QUIZ QUESTION,
AND I WAS LIKE,

529
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:27,300
"I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO.

530
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,300
"I'LL GO INDEPENDENTLY
DO SOME RESEARCH

531
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,934
"AND I'LL POST MY FINDINGS
ON THE BOARD.

532
00:19:30,968 --> 00:19:33,300
THEY'LL THINK I'M SMART
AND THAT I BELONG IN THE CLASS."

533
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:34,801
SO THE NEXT POST
I WROTE WAS,

534
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:36,968
"GUYS, I'VE BEEN
DOING SOME RESEARCH.

535
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,901
"I THINK THE VIEWS ON SALVATION
IN BUDDHISM AND CHRISTIANITY

536
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,400
"ARE FAR FROM SIMILAR.

537
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:42,968
"IN BUDDHISM, SALVATION IS
SOMETHING ONE CAN ONLY

538
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,634
"ACHIEVE THROUGH THE NOBLE
EIGHTFOLD PATH,

539
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,334
"WHEREAS IN CHRISTIANITY,
SALVATION IS GIVEN

540
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:48,133
"TO ALL THOSE WHOM ACCEPT

541
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,934
"QUOTE, 'FOR WHOMSOEVER SHALL

542
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:51,968
"'SHALL BE SAVED,'
ROMANS 10:13.

543
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,868
"I HATE TO SAY IT, GUYS,
BUT OUR TEACHER

544
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,334
MR. EDELSTEIN IS RIGHT."

545
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:58,934
BAM!

546
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:00,467
AND THEN I WAITED, LIKE,
TWO MINUTES

547
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:01,968
AND THEN I WROTE THIS.

548
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
"GUYS, I JUST GOT AN EMAIL
FROM MR. EDELSTEIN!

549
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,434
"HE READ WHAT I WROTE HERE
AND GAVE ME

550
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:08,467
"AN EXTRA POINT
ON THE QUIZ.

551
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:11,601
"HE SAID I SHOWED INITIATIVE
AND CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS.

552
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:14,501
WHAT A COOL GUY!"

553
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:20,300
AND THEN THIS KID REPLIED,
"WHAT?"

554
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:25,400
AND THEN AT THIS POINT,
HARRIS GOT FUCKING FURIOUS.

555
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,133
HE'S LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU SHOULD HAVE WROTE

556
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,367
THAT WALL POST, AZIZ,"
AND I WAS LIKE, "WHY?"

557
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,834
HE GOES, "WHAT IF PEOPLE
GO IN TOMORROW AND SAY,

558
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:31,901
"'HEY EDELSTEIN,
I HEARD YOU GAVE AZIZ

559
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:33,234
"'AN EXTRA POINT ON THE QUIZ.

560
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,501
"'CAN I GET AN EXTRA
POINT BACK TOO,

561
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:35,968
"BECAUSE I PUT THE
SAME THING HE DID?'

562
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,968
"AND HE'LL BE LIKE,
'I DON'T TEACH AZIZ.

563
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,634
THAT PERSON DOESN'T EXIST.'"

564
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:39,834
AND I WAS LIKE,
"FUCK YOU, HARRIS.

565
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:41,834
I DO EXIST."

566
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:44,167
AND THEN HE STARTS ATTACKING ME
PUBLICLY ON THE BOARDS.

567
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,033
HE WRITES IN ALL CAPS,
"AZIZ, GET OUT OF THIS GROUP!"

568
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,701
WITH, LIKE, A BUNCH
OF EXCLAMATION POINTS

569
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:50,200
AND THEN EMOTICONS
THAT ARE LIKE--

570
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:52,033
[angry chattering]

571
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,367
AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT'S
THAT SUPPOSED TO BE, HARRIS,

572
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,434
YOU EATING CINNABON ALL DAY?"

573
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,534
AND THEN I STARTED
MOUNTING MY OFFENSIVE.

574
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:00,767
I STARTED POKING HIM
LIKE CRAZY.

575
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,133
I STARTED SENDING
HIM VAMPIRE REQUESTS,

576
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:03,868
WHATEVER THE FUCK THAT IS.

577
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:07,434
HE'S LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON."

578
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,767
AND THEN HE WRITES UP THERE--
HE GOES, "HEY, EVERYONE.

579
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:12,467
"IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'T GO TO EDELSTEIN

580
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:13,934
"AND ASK FOR POINTS BACK
ON THAT QUESTION.

581
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,167
I'M POSITIVE YOU WON'T
GET THE POINTS BACK."

582
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,701
AND THEN I WRITE,
"NO, GUYS.

583
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,834
"I JUST TALKED
TO EDELSTEIN AGAIN.

584
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:22,601
"YOU'LL DEFINITELY
GET THE POINTS BACK.

585
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:26,067
"JUST MENTION MY NAME
AND THE FACT THAT I EXIST.

586
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,133
FUCK YOU, HARRIS!"

587
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:34,400
THEN--

588
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:37,367
AND THEN THIS KID WRITES,
"YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN THIS CLASS.

589
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,968
YOU'RE THE GUY
FROM THAT TV SHOW."

590
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,467
AND SOME OTHER KID WRITES,
"WHAT TV SHOW ARE YOU ON?"

591
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:44,200
AND I WRITE,
 "GOSSIP GIRL."

592
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:46,501
AND THEN I GOT KICKED
THE FUCK OUT.

593
00:21:46,534 --> 00:21:50,434
[laughter and applause]

594
00:21:56,434 --> 00:21:58,868
I DO THIS--
DO THIS TV SHOW RIGHT NOW,

595
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,868
AND, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU PROMOTE A TV SHOW

596
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:02,868
YOU'RE ON, YOU GOT TO DO
A LOT OF INTERVIEWS AND STUFF.

597
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:05,801
AND I WAS DOING AN INTERVIEW
ONCE AND THIS GUY GOES,

598
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:07,501
"SO YOU MUST
BE PRETTY PSYCHED

599
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,667
BY ALL THIS 
 SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE STUFF."

600
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:13,167
AND I LIKE,
"UM, YEAH, I AM!

601
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,834
"I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THOUGH.

602
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:16,968
"I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT MOVIE.

603
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,601
"IT'S JUST SOME PEOPLE
THAT KIND OF LOOK LIKE ME

604
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:20,367
"ARE IN THIS MOVIE
THAT EVERYONE LOVES

605
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,767
AND WINNING OSCARS
AND STUFF."

606
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:24,167
AND I WAS LIKE,
"WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

607
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,701
ARE WHITE PEOPLE JUST
PSYCHED ALL THE TIME?"

608
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:28,601
IT'S LIKE, "BACK TO THE FUTURE,
 THAT'S US!

609
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:31,167
 "GODFATHER, THAT'S US!
 GODFATHER PART TWO, THAT'S US!

610
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,367
 "DEPARTED, THAT'S US!
 SUNSET BOULEVARD, THAT'S US!

611
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,567
 "CITIZEN KANE, THAT'S US!
 JAWS, THAT'S US!

612
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:37,901
"EVERY FUCKING MOVIE
BUT SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE

613
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:40,067
"AND BOYZ N THE HOOD IS US!

614
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,567
WE ARE WHITE PEOPLE!
SUCK OUR DICKS!"

615
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:46,534
[laughter and applause]

616
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:53,033
[chuckles]

617
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:55,868
I DID THIS SHOW
ON MTV ONCE

618
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:57,834
AND, UM, MTV's GREAT.

619
00:22:57,868 --> 00:22:59,801
THEY LET US DO THIS SHOW,
AND LET US MAKE IT AWESOME

620
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,234
HOWEVER WE WANTED,
AND CREATIVELY,

621
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:03,634
THEY WERE SO AWESOME
AND IT WAS SO COOL.

622
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,100
HOWEVER, I GOT TO SAY,
SOME OF THE SHOWS

623
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,434
ON THE NETWORK,
NOT REALLY MY CUP OF TEA.

624
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:08,534
UH, MAINLY BECAUSE
I DON'T LIKE

625
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:10,801
HUGE PIECES OF SHIT
IN MY TEA.

626
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:15,501
[laughter and applause]

627
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:22,534
I--I WAS WATCHING THIS DATING
SHOW ON THERE CALLED NEXT.

628
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,634
MAN, IF ANYONE HERE HAS EVER
BEEN A CONTESTANT ON NEXT,

629
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:28,334
DO ME A FAVOR
AND GO AWAY AND DIE.

630
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,534
'CAUSE YOU'RE A HORRIBLE PERSON
AND I DON'T WANT COMEDY

631
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:32,000
BRINGING ANY KIND
OF SATISFACTION

632
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:33,601
INTO YOUR MISERABLE EXISTENCE.

633
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:36,701
[laughter]

634
00:23:36,734 --> 00:23:38,100
FIRST GUY THAT COMES OUT,
RIGHT?

635
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,801
HE'S THE GUY GOING OUT
ON THE DATES.

636
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:41,534
AND HE COMES UP THERE
AND HE SAYS THIS--HE GOES,

637
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,167
"YO, THIS GIRL
BETTER BE PRETTY,

638
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,467
"'CAUSE IF SHE'S
A PAIN IN THE ASS,

639
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:47,834
I'M GONNA NEED SOMETHING
CUTE TO LOOK AT."

640
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:50,167
AND I WAS STUNNED
THAT HE COULD SAY THAT.

641
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,534
THAT'S SO OFFENSIVE.

642
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:54,300
AND AT THE SAME TIME,
ON MY SHOW,

643
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,334
THEY DIDN'T WANT US
TO SAY THAT A CHARACTER

644
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:58,901
WAS RAPED BY A DINOSAUR.

645
00:23:58,934 --> 00:24:01,601
RAPED BY A DINOSAUR!

646
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:03,667
'CAUSE THAT'S TOO OFFENSIVE.

647
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:05,067
OH, I GUESS THEY DIDN'T
WANT ALL THESE ANGRY LETTERS

648
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,000
FROM PALEONTOLOGISTS
WHO ARE LIKE, "HEY, MAN!

649
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:08,267
"THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE FOSSIL RECORDS TO SUGGEST

650
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,934
"THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR.

651
00:24:09,968 --> 00:24:12,200
SO WHY DON'T YOU CHILL
WITH YOUR ACCUSATIONS?"

652
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:16,701
[laughter and applause]

653
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:18,534
AND THEN AFTER
YOU MEET THIS DUDE,

654
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:20,868
THEN YOU MEET THE GIRLS HE'S
GOING OUT ON THE DATES WITH.

655
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:23,033
AND THEY COME UP THERE
AND THEY SAY THINGS LIKE,

656
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:25,601
"IF HE HAS A NECK TATTOO,
I'M GONNA LICK IT."

657
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:27,467
[laughter]

658
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:28,868
IT'S LIKE WHOA!

659
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:31,000
HOW SLUTTY CAN YOU BE
IN FIVE SECONDS?

660
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:33,167
AND AFTER THEY SAY THAT,
THEY FREEZE,

661
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,934
AND, LIKE, THREE FACTS ABOUT 'EM
POP UP ON THE LEFT SIDE.

662
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:37,934
AND THE FIRST TWO FACTS
ARE ALWAYS REALLY NORMAL,

663
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:40,300
BUT THE THIRD FACT ALWAYS COMES
WAY OUT OF LEFT FIELD.

664
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:42,501
IT'S ALWAYS LIKE,
"MONICA'S 22.

665
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:44,167
"SHE'S A HAIRDRESSER
IN HOLLYWOOD

666
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,133
AND SHE HATES PURPLE
GIFT WRAP."

667
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:50,133
LIKE, HOW DOES THAT
DEFINE HER AS A PERSON?"

668
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,801
AND THE WHOLE SHOW
JUST BUMMED ME OUT, MAN.

669
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:53,634
'CAUSE THE THINGS
THEY TRY TO KEEP OFF TV

670
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:56,000
ARE JUST, LIKE,
REALLY EXPLICIT SEX OR VIOLENCE,

671
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:58,033
AND NO ONE CARES ABOUT THEIR
KIDS SEEING ATTITUDES

672
00:24:58,067 --> 00:25:00,467
LIKE THAT ON TV,
AND THAT'S WAY WORSE TO ME.

673
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:02,133
LIKE, I'D MUCH RATHER
HAVE A DAUGHTER

674
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,067
THAT GREW UP AND SHOT ME IN THE
LEG AND BURNED MY HOUSE DOWN,

675
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,968
THEN SOME REALLY SLUTTY
GIRL THAT,

676
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,133
"HATES THE SOUND OF PEOPLE
EATING BANANAS."

677
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:13,334
[laughter]

678
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:16,300
MY FAVORITE THIRD FACT I EVER
SAW ON NEXT THOUGH

679
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:18,434
WAS THIS ONE GUY
NAMED CLARENCE.

680
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:22,467
HIS THIRD FACT WAS THAT HE HATES
THE PHRASE "RIVER VIEW."

681
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:23,868
YOU DIDN'T MISHEAR ME.

682
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:25,334
WHEN THE WORDS
"RIVER" AND "VIEW"

683
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:26,534
START COMING TOGETHER,
CLARENCE IS LIKE,

684
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,534
"HOLD UP!
DON'T DO THAT!"

685
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:31,000
I WAS LIKE,
"WHAT WOULD MAKE A MAN

686
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:32,501
HATE THE PHRASE
'RIVER VIEW'?"

687
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:34,300
AND I COULD ONLY
THINK OF ONE SCENARIO

688
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:38,467
AND IT'S TERRIBLE,
BUT I HAVE TO SHARE IT WITH YOU.

689
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:41,133
SO ONE DAY, THIS GUY CLARENCE
IS COMING HOME, RIGHT?

690
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,000
AND HE'S WALKING DOWN
A DARK ALLEY,

691
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:45,100
AND GETS JUMPED BY THIS
MOTORCYCLE GANG

692
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:47,267
AND THEY JUST START
RAPING HIM, RIGHT?

693
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,300
AND ALL HE CAN SEE IS THIS SIGN
THAT SAYS "RIVER VIEW."

694
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:52,868
AND THESE GUYS ARE JUST LIKE,
"SAY IT, CLARENCE! SAY IT!"

695
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,467
HE'S LIKE, "RIVER VIEW!
RIVER VIEW! RIVER VIEW!

696
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:56,133
RIVER VIEW! RIVER VIEW!
R-R-R-R-R-ROO!"

697
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:58,234
SO, YEAH, IF YOU WERE RAPED
BY THE RIVER VIEW RAPE GANG,

698
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,067
SURE, HATE THE PHRASE
"RIVER VIEW."

699
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,801
OTHERWISE JUST STOP LOOKING
AT PROPERTY IN THAT AREA!

700
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:06,467
[laughter and applause]

701
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:09,767
I THINK YOU NOTICED SOMETHING
REALLY WEIRD ABOUT ME

702
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,067
WHEN I DO THAT BIT,

703
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,601
 AND THAT IS THAT
I'M A VERY LAZY RAPIST.

704
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:16,100
I JUST BEND MY KNEES
A LITTLE BIT, VERY LOW IMPACT.

705
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:18,234
ANYBODY THAT'S WORRIED
ABOUT GETTING RAPED BY ME

706
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:20,801
AFTER THE SHOW IS LIKE, "MAN,
IT'S NOT GONNA BE THAT BAD.

707
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:23,400
"I GOT RAPED BY AZIZ AFTER
THE SHOW LAST NIGHT.

708
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:27,701
THAT WAS PRETTY REFRESHING."

709
00:26:27,734 --> 00:26:31,334
I MET THIS GUY WHEN
I WAS BACK HOME LAST TIME

710
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:33,767
WHO WAS A DOCTOR AND HE MOVED
FROM SOME COUNTRY IN ASIA

711
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,300
TO ALABAMA.

712
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:39,300
AND I WAS LIKE, "MAN, OUT OF ALL
THE STATES IN THE COUNTRY,

713
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:40,868
WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE ALABAMA?"

714
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:43,000
AND HE GOES, "OH, WELL, I DON'T
HAVE MY GREEN CARD YET,

715
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:44,934
"SO IF I WORK IN A PLACE
THAT'S UNDERSERVED,

716
00:26:44,968 --> 00:26:47,834
LIKE ALABAMA,
THEY'LL GIVE ME A WAIVER."

717
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:50,934
I WAS LIKE, "WHOA,
THAT'S KIND OF A WEIRD DEAL."

718
00:26:50,968 --> 00:26:52,300
GOVERNMENT'S LIKE,
"OH, YEAH, YOU CAN COME

719
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:53,467
"TO THE UNITED STATES.
COME ON. COME ON.

720
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:54,767
"YEAH, YOU, COME ON.
COME ON. COME ON.

721
00:26:54,801 --> 00:26:56,367
BUT YOU GOT
TO GO TO ALABAMA."

722
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,501
[laughter]

723
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,801
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A GIRL GOING,

724
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:00,968
"YEAH, YOU CAN
SEE ME NAKED,

725
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,734
"BUT YOU CAN ONLY
LOOK AT MY LEFT ELBOW

726
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:05,067
AND MY LEFT ELBOW'S
RACIST."

727
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,767
[laughter and applause]

728
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:14,267
I LIKE LIVING IN L.A.

729
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,300
ONE THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT
LIVING HERE IS DRIVING.

730
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,000
I ALWAYS GET BORED
WHEN I'M DRIVING.

731
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:19,934
AND WHEN I GET BORED,
I GO ON THE INTERNET

732
00:27:19,968 --> 00:27:23,501
ON MY BLACKBERRY,
SO I'M GONNA DIE!

733
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:25,667
AND WHENEVER THEY
GO THROUGH THE WRECKAGE,

734
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:27,133
THEY'LL FIND MY PHONE
AND BE LIKE,

735
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,501
"WHOA! THAT'S WHAT HE LOOKED UP
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED?"

736
00:27:29,534 --> 00:27:30,934
GONNA BE SO SAD.
IT'LL BE LIKE,

737
00:27:30,968 --> 00:27:33,434
"COMEDIAN AZIZ ANSARI WAS KILLED

I DO DO THAT, MAN.
IT'S HARD NOT TO.

757
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,334
EVERYONE I KNOW,
THEY GOOGLE THEIR NAME,

758
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:29,434
SEE WHAT PEOPLE WRITE,
AND IT'S SO FUNNY TO READ IT,

759
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,167
'CAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS
THINK LIKE,

760
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,901
"OH, MAN, THERE'S NO WAY HE'D
HAVE TIME TO EVER READ THIS."

761
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:34,968
HA-HA! YEAH, I DO.
I DON'T DO ANYTHING!

762
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,734
I TAKE NAPS ALL DAY!

763
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:39,767
AND...

764
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,267
I READ THIS ONE TIME THIS GIRL,
LIKE, HAD WRITTEN ABOUT,

765
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,367
LIKE, HOW SHE HAD
A CELEBRITY CRUSH...

766
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,868
ON ME.

767
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:47,367
AND IT'S FUNNY,
'CAUSE SHE NEVER THOUGHT

768
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,701
IN A MILLION YEARS
THAT I'D READ THAT.

769
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:50,133
YOU KNOW, NEVER IN A MILLION
YEARS WOULD I READ THAT.

770
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:55,367
BUT I DID.
[laughter]

771
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,534
SO ONE DAY I'M JUST GONNA EMAIL
HER AND BE LIKE,

772
00:28:57,567 --> 00:29:00,767
"HEY! IT'S ME, AZIZ!

773
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:03,801
"I HEARD YOU HAVE A CELEBRITY
CRUSH ON ME.

00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:09,300

776
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:12,300
[laughter]

777
00:29:14,534 --> 00:29:15,834
I LOVE PERFORMING
AT MUSIC FESTIVALS.

778
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:17,434
THAT'S ALWAYS FUN.

779
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:18,968
I DID THIS FESTIVAL
CALLED BONNAROO

780
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,100
AND IT'S REALLY COOL,
'CAUSE THEY HAVE, LIKE,

781
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:23,801
INDIE-ROCK STUFF AND, LIKE,
HIPPIE STUFF COMING TOGETHER.

782
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,267
LIKE, THEY HAD THIS WEIRD
HIPPIE THING THERE

783
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,400
CALLED "THE SONIC FOREST."

784
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,767
AND THAT WAS BASICALLY--
THEY'D HAVE THESE POLES SET UP

785
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,167
AND YOU'D SLAP
THE SIDES OF THE POLES

786
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,834
AND ALL THESE BELLS AND WHISTLES
AND LIGHTS WOULD GO OFF

787
00:29:32,868 --> 00:29:34,300
AND THEY HAD, LIKE,
30 OF 'EM IN ONE LITTLE AREA,

788
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:35,734
AND IT WAS LIKE,
"THAT'S THE SONIC FOREST."

789
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:37,734
I WAS LIKE, "MAN,
HOW DUMB ARE THOSE HIPPIES

790
00:29:37,767 --> 00:29:39,400
TO BE ENTERTAINED
BY SOMETHING SO STUPID?"

791
00:29:39,434 --> 00:29:40,801
[chuckles]

792
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,801
AND THEN THE LAST DAY I WAS
THERE, I ATE MUSHROOMS.

793
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:44,100
AND THEN I WAS LIKE,

794
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:45,334
* SONIC FOREST 

795
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,767
* I TOTALLY GET YOU NOW 

796
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:49,367
AND I SLAPPED THE SHIT
OUT OF THOSE POLES

797
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,167
FOR, LIKE, FOUR HOURS,
'CAUSE THE SONIC FOREST

798
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,133
IS THE GREATEST IDEA EVER!

799
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,067
[laughter]

800
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:02,033
I DID A FESTIVAL IN TELLURIDE,
COLORADO, ONCE.

801
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,200
IT'S A SKI TOWN.

802
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,534
NOT A LOT OF MINORITIES THERE.

803
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:08,267
AND I WAS TALKING TO THIS DUDE
AND HE WAS LIKE,

804
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,000
"YO, MAN, BEFORE YOU GO,
I GOT TO ASK YOU ONE THING.

805
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:13,667
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?"

806
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:15,501
AND I WENT, "WELL,
I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA,

807
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:17,300
BUT MY PARENTS
ARE FROM INDIA."

808
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:19,234
AND HE WENT,
"WHAT?

809
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:22,334
BUT YOU TALK EXACTLY
LIKE I DO!"

810
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,300
AND I WAS LIKE, "WELL, I MEAN,
HERE'S THE THING, MAN.

811
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:26,033
"THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
COME HERE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES

812
00:30:26,067 --> 00:30:27,834
"AND, YOU KNOW,
THEY HAVE CHILDREN HERE,

813
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,400
"THEY GROW UP
IN THIS SOCIETY,

814
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:30,634
"AND SOMETIMES
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCENTS.

815
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:33,000
THEY'RE CALLED IMMIGRANTS."

816
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:35,567
AND THEN I SHOWED HIM A VIDEO
OF AN ASIAN KID RAPPING,

817
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:37,334
AND HIS HEAD EXPLODED.

818
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:40,267
[laughter]

819
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:44,868
I WENT TO A PLACE RECENTLY
I THINK IS ONE

820
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:47,200
OF THE MOST FUCKED UP
PLACES I'VE EVER BEEN TO.

821
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:49,133
I'M CONVINCED THIS PLACE IS
THE EPITOME OF AMERICAN EXCESS,

822
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:50,701
OF AMERICAN GREED.

823
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:53,901
I'M TALKING ABOUT A PLACE
CALLED COLD STONE CREAMERY.

824
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,701
WHOA.

825
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:58,033
IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN THERE,
THE BASIC GIST OF COLD STONE

826
00:30:58,067 --> 00:30:59,501
IS THAT THEY TAKE
ICE CREAM

827
00:30:59,534 --> 00:31:01,434
AND THEN THEY JUST
GO APE SHIT WITH IT.

828
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,200
THEY'RE JUST, LIKE,
SLAMMING BROWNIES

829
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:04,767
AND GUMMY BEARS AND JUST
HAMMERING IT IN THERE.

830
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:06,434
WHATEVER FAT PEOPLE
WANT IN THERE.

831
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,033
SNICKERS BAR, CHEESEBURGER!

832
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:10,133
LET ME FUCK A BUTTERFINGER INTO
IT FOR YOU.

833
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:11,767
IT'S LIKE, "WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

834
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:13,000
"JESUS!

835
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:15,501
"THIS IS WAY TOO INTENSE
FOR ME.

836
00:31:15,534 --> 00:31:17,267
"IS THAT GUY'S DICK
A BUTTERFINGER?

837
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,868
"WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

838
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:21,300
"WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

839
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:23,534
"I THINK I'LL JUST HAVE A SMALL
CUP OF VANILLA IF THAT'S OKAY.

840
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,133
THIS IS JUST
TOO INTENSE FOR ME."

841
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:27,167
LADY BEHIND THE COUNTER'S LIKE,
"NO, NO, NO!

842
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,801
"YOU SHOULD TRY ONE
OF OUR CREATIONS

843
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:30,300
"LIKE BIRTHDAY CAKE REMIX,
WHERE WE TAKE CAKE BATTER

844
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:32,300
ICE CREAM, YELLOW CAKE,
FUDGE CHUNKS, SPRINKLES!"

845
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:34,534
IT'S LIKE, "YOU KNOW, THAT JUST
SOUNDS TOO INTENSE FOR ME.

846
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:35,701
I'LL JUST HAVE
A SMALL CUP OF VANILLA."

847
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:38,033
SHE GOES,
"QUIT BEING A BITCH!"

848
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:40,667
WHOA!

849
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:42,701
AND THEN I COULDN'T
EVEN GET A SMALL

850
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,801
'CAUSE THEIR SIZES
ARE ACTUALLY,

851
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:48,834
"LIKE IT," "LOVE IT,"
AND "GOTTA HAVE IT"!

852
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:51,634
WHAT KIND OF CRACKHEAD
TERMINOLOGY IS THAT?

853
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:52,901
"HEY, WHAT SIZE YOU WANT,
MAN?"

854
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:54,467
"I DON'T KNOW, MAN!
I JUST GOTTA HAVE IT!

855
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:56,000
"PUT SOME ICE CREAM
IN A CUP!

856
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:58,033
I'M TWEAKING! I'M TWEAKING!
I'M TWEAKING!"

857
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:02,133
[laughter]

858
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,534
AND, YOU KNOW,
I FELT BAD FOR PEOPLE

859
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:04,767
THAT HAD TO WORK THERE,
MAN.

860
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:06,133
SO I WAS LIKE,
"AWW, I'M GONNA DROP

861
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:07,701
A COUPLE OF DOLLARS
IN THE TIP JAR ON MY WAY OUT."

862
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:10,634
WHOA, THAT'S WHEN ALL HELL
BROKE LOOSE!

863
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,701
'CAUSE APPARENTLY WHENEVER
THEY GET EVEN $1

864
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:15,133
IN THE TIP JAR,
ALL FIVE EMPLOYEES

865
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:18,467
ARE REQUIRED TO BUMP OUT
INTO A SONG AND DANCE NUMBER

866
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:20,200
WHERE THEY TAKE CURRENT
POPULAR MUSIC

867
00:32:20,234 --> 00:32:22,100
AND SHOVE COLD STONE LINGO
INTO IT,

868
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:24,434
AS IF THEY'RE SOME RETARDED
SECOND COUSIN OF WEIRD AL

869
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:26,267
THAT'S OBSESSED
WITH ICE CREAM.

870
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,667
AND IT'S RIDICULOUS.

871
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:31,367
FIVE PEOPLE ARE SINGING
AND DANCING FOR $1.

872
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,200
THAT'S 20 CENTS A PERSON!

873
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:36,334
IF YOU SAW A HOMELESS DUDE
OUTSIDE A COLD STONE,

874
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:37,734
YOU'RE LIKE, "HEY, MAN,
I'LL GIVE YOU 20 CENTS

875
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:38,901
TO SING SOME SONGS
ABOUT COLD STONE."

876
00:32:38,934 --> 00:32:40,868
HE'D GO, "HEY, MAN.
GO FUCK YOURSELF!

877
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:42,567
THAT'S DEGRADING!"

878
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:45,534
[laughter and applause]

879
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:51,634
ONE THING THAT'S COOL ABOUT
DOING THOSE MUSIC FESTIVALS

880
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:53,501
IS, YOU KNOW, YOU GET TO MEET
MUSICIANS AND STUFF

881
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:54,901
THAT, LIKE,
YOU'RE A FAN OF,

882
00:32:54,934 --> 00:32:56,634
AND, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S ALWAYS COOL FOR ME.

883
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:59,334
LIKE, I MET M.I.A. ONCE,
AND, UM, I WAS LIKE,

884
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:00,834
"MAN, I GOT TO SAY SOMETHING
COOL TO M.I.A.

885
00:33:00,868 --> 00:33:02,167
SHE'S SO COOL!"

886
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,467
I WAS LIKE,
"THIS IS WHAT I'LL DO.

887
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:04,467
"I'M SAY SOMETHING IN TAMIL,

888
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:05,767
"THIS OBSCURE,
SOUTHEAST ASIAN LANGUAGE

889
00:33:05,801 --> 00:33:07,033
THAT WE BOTH HAPPEN
TO SPEAK."

890
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:08,534
HERE'S THE THING.

891
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:10,601
I DON'T SPEAK TAMIL
THAT WELL.

892
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:12,033
LIKE, I WOULD NEVER SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

893
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:13,868
BUT IF I WANTED TO SAY,
"YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL BREASTS,"

894
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:15,200
I COULDN'T SAY THAT.

895
00:33:15,234 --> 00:33:17,200
WHAT I'D HAVE TO SAY IS--
[speaking Tamil]

896
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:19,133
WHICH TRANSLATES TO,
"FOR YOU, RIGHT HERE,

897
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:20,434
IT'S AWESOME."

898
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:22,501
WHICH IS A TERRIBLE LINE!

899
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,467
[laughter and applause]

900
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:33,133
ONE TIME, IN L.A., KANYE WEST
CAME TO ONE OF MY SHOWS,

901
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,467
AND I WAS SO PSYCHED.

902
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:35,868
I'M SUCH A HUGE
KANYE WEST FAN.

903
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:39,200
AND EVERYTHING HE DID
TO ME WAS SO FUNNY.

904
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:43,067
LIKE, HE WAS IN THE BATHROOM
FOR, LIKE, A REALLY LONG TIME.

905
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,067
AND THEN HE CAME OUT,
HE GOES,

906
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,534
"YO, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I WAS ON

907
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:47,868
"AN IMPORTANT PHONE CALL.

908
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,167
I WASN'T TAKING A SHIT."

909
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,133
[laughter]

910
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,534
BUT, UM, WHEN HE WAS LEAVING,
HE WAS LIKE,

911
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,300
"YO, MAN, WE SHOULD
HANG OUT SOMETIME.

912
00:33:58,334 --> 00:33:59,567
THAT'D BE COOL, RIGHT?"

913
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:00,901
AND I WAS LIKE,
"YEAH, THAT'D BE CRAZY.

914
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:02,400
I'M SUCH A HUGE FAN.
THAT'D BE AWESOME."

915
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:04,167
SO THIS IS THE STORY
OF THE FIRST TIME

916
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,734
I HUNG OUT WITH KANYE WEST.

917
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,067
SO HE TEXTS ME,
HE'S LIKE,

918
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,801
"YO, WE'RE AT THIS CLUB.
COME DOWN."

919
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:11,634
SO I GRAB MY FRIEND JASON,
WHO'S ANOTHER GUY

920
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,267
THAT DOES NOT LOOK
LIKE HE BELONG

921
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,033
IN A HIP-HOP NIGHTCLUB.

922
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:16,767
AND WE HEAD OVER THERE,
RIGHT?

923
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:17,968
AND WE GET THERE,
WE GET IN THE CLUB,

924
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,267
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
"YO, WE'RE AT CAPACITY."

925
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,534
I WAS LIKE, "WELL, KANYE WEST
TOLD ME TO COME DOWN."

926
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:26,167
AND HE WAS LIKE,
"SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE

927
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,968
TO COME AND GET YOU."

928
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,634
[chuckles]

929
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,601
AND SO I TEXTED KANYE.

930
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:34,167
I WAS LIKE, "HEY, MAN, LIKE,
THEY'RE AT CAPACITY."

931
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,467
I SAID, "SOMEONE NEEDS
TO GET ME."

932
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:36,667
AND THEN BEFORE
I COULD EVEN HIT "SEND,"

933
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:39,601
I GET A TEXT FROM HIM,
"ON MY WAY!"

934
00:34:39,634 --> 00:34:41,300
AND HE COMES OUT.
HE'S LIKE--

935
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:42,667
AND WE GO IN.

936
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:44,100
IT WAS REALLY COOL
OF HIM TO COME GET US.

937
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:45,467
AND WE GO INSIDE, AND, LIKE,
HE'S SITTING THERE

938
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,701
AT A TABLE WITH,
LIKE, JAY-Z AND ALL THESE MODELS

939
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:49,834
AND STUFF AND, LIKE,
WE JUST DID NOT BELONG THERE.

940
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:51,400
LIKE, IF YOU HAD
A PHOTO OF THAT TABLE,

941
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:53,200
YOU'D BE LIKE, "WHO PHOTOSHOPPED
THOSE TWO DUDES IN THERE?

942
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:55,367
THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD JOB."

943
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,734
[laughter and applause]
AND--

944
00:34:57,767 --> 00:35:01,000
YOU KNOW, JAY-Z'S THERE DRINKING
VODKA HE MAKES.

945
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:02,434
LIKE, HOW BALLER IS THAT?

946
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,000
JAY-Z SIGNED THE TAB,
MONEY WENT BACK

947
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:05,567
INTO HIS OWN POCKET.

948
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:07,167
HE WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE CRAZY
FOR THIS ONE, JAY.

949
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,100
HOV! PSHH!"

950
00:35:09,133 --> 00:35:12,801
[laughter and applause]

951
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:18,400
AND SO KANYE EVENTUALLY GOES,
"YO, MAN.

952
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:19,267
"WE'RE HEADING BACK
TO THE CRIB.

953
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,767
YOU WANT TO COME DOWN?"

954
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:21,634
I WAS LIKE,
"YEAH, THAT'D BE AWESOME.

955
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:22,667
THAT'D BE CRAZY
TO SEE YOUR HOUSE."

956
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:24,300
AND SO WE GO DOWN THERE,
ME AND JASON,

957
00:35:24,334 --> 00:35:25,667
AND WE GET THERE
PRETTY EARLY.

958
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:27,334
AND THERE'S NO ONE
REALLY THERE,

959
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:29,534
AND I WALK IN AND I HEAR 
 808s AND HEARTBREAK PLAYING,

960
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:31,934
WHICH IS HIS ALBUM.

961
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,834
AND I WALK UP AND I SEE HIM
SITTING ON THE COUCH.

962
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:35,934
HE'S LIKE...

963
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:39,634
[laughter]

964
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,834
"SHH!"

965
00:35:41,868 --> 00:35:44,033
I WAS LIKE, "YO, MAN.

966
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:46,801
"ARE YOU LISTENING TO YOUR OWN
ALBUM IN YOUR OWN HOUSE,

967
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:48,801
BOPPING YOUR OWN HEAD?"

968
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:53,033
AND HE GOES, "YEAH.
THESE BEATS ARE DOPE."

969
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,067
AND I GO, "THAT'D BE LIKE IF
I HAD A STAND-UP ALBUM,

970
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,834
"YOU CAME OVER TO MY HOUSE AND
I WAS LISTENING TO IT GOING,

971
00:35:56,868 --> 00:36:00,033
'HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!
THESE JOKES ARE DOPE.'"

972
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:03,434
[laughter]

973
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:05,634
AND WE'RE SITTING THERE HANGING
OUT AT HIS HOUSE,

974
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:07,834
AND, LIKE,
EVERYTHING THAT KANYE SAID TO ME

975
00:36:07,868 --> 00:36:09,267
MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD.

976
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,234
LIKE, AT ONE POINT WE WERE,
LIKE, SITTING THERE

977
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:11,467
TALKING ABOUT MUSIC.

978
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:12,801
LIKE, TALKING ABOUT
TV ON THE RADIO

979
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,267
OR SOMETHING, AND,
LIKE, HE JUST, LIKE, CUT ME OFF.

980
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,067
HE WAS LIKE, "YO, MAN.
HOLD ON A SECOND."

981
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,133
AND HE SAID THE GREATEST THING
I WILL EVER HEAR IN MY LIFE.

982
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:20,100
HE GOES, "HOLD ON A SECOND.

983
00:36:20,133 --> 00:36:21,634
"I'MA GO OVER THERE
AND LOOK IN THE TELESCOPE

984
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:22,801
WITH THIS GIRL
WITH THE BIG TITTIES."

985
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:25,634
[laughter]

986
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:28,367
[chuckles]

987
00:36:30,868 --> 00:36:32,767
AND THEN LATER ON, YOU KNOW,

988
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:34,534
HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT COMING TO MY SHOW,

989
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,167
AND HE WAS LIKE, "MAN, I HAD
A GOOD TIME AT YOUR SHOW."

990
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,601
AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, THANK YOU FOR COMING."

991
00:36:37,634 --> 00:36:39,467
YOU KNOW, AND HE'S LIKE,
"YO, MAN.

992
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:40,701
"YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU NEED TO DO TONIGHT?

993
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:42,601
YOU NEED TO DO SOME
OF YOUR JOKES."

994
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:43,801
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MAN.

995
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,200
"YOU KNOW WHAT
I NEED TO DO TONIGHT?

996
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:47,200
NOT DO THAT."

997
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:48,667
BUT HE KEPT BRINGING IT UP.

998
00:36:48,701 --> 00:36:50,000
HE WAS LIKE,
"COME ON, MAN. PLEASE?

999
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,701
"IT'D BE REALLY COOL IF YOU DID
SOME JOKES, MAN.

1000
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:53,033
IT'D BE REALLY COOL."

1001
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:54,334
AND EVENTUALLY I HAD
A COUPLE MORE DRINKS.

1002
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:56,133
I WAS LIKE, "FUCK IT!
I'LL DO SOME JOKES!"

1003
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:57,767
AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
LIKE,

1004
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,634
MY FRIEND JASON'S
IN THE LIVING ROOM LIKE,

1005
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,968
"THIS NEXT COMEDIAN COMING
TO THE STAGE..."

1006
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,167
AND, LIKE, I COME UP
TO THE LIVING ROOM,

1007
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,968
AND, LIKE, HE'S GOT, LIKE,
30 PEOPLE ARRANGED

1008
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,667
IN HIS LIVING ROOM AND I'M,
LIKE, TELLING MY JOKES

1009
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:10,467
AND THIS IS A NIGHTMARE
SITUATION FOR A COMEDIAN.

1010
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:12,067
BUT EVERYONE
WAS VERY QUIET AND NICE.

1011
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,767
THEY LISTENED, THEY LAUGHED,
AND IT WAS GREAT.

1012
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:16,100
BUT MY FAVORITE PART WAS,
EVERY NOW AND THEN,

1013
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,267
SOMEONE WOULD BE
IN THE KITCHEN, LIKE,

1014
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,300
MAKING A DRINK
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

1015
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:19,767
AND THEY'D MAKE
A LITTLE NOISE,

1016
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:20,834
AND THEN KANYE WOULD
JUMP UP AND BE LIKE,

1017
00:37:20,868 --> 00:37:22,167
"YO, SHUT THE FUCK UP!

1018
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,167
HOMIE'S OVER HERE TRYING
TO TELL SOME JOKES!"

1019
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,133
WHICH IS THE BEST THING ANYONE'S
EVER YELLED AT A COMEDY SHOW.

1020
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:31,601
[laughter]

1021
00:37:31,634 --> 00:37:34,501
MY COUSIN DARWISH,
WHO IS HARRIS' OLDER BROTHER,

1022
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:37,000
ACTUALLY GOT INTO A LITTLE BIT
OF A TIFF WITH KANYE.

1023
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:39,501
AND, YOU KNOW, DARWISH IS,
LIKE, 18 YEARS OLD,

1024
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:41,467
SO HE JUST STARTED LISTENING
TO MUSIC.

1025
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:44,367
AND, UM, HE WOULD
ALWAYS I.M. ME

1026
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,467
ABOUT NEW BANDS
HE'D HEARD OF OR WHATEVER.

1027
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:48,767
AND ONE TIME HE'S LIKE,
"AZIZ, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD

1028
00:37:48,801 --> 00:37:50,300
"OF KANYE WEST?

1029
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:53,000
THAT SONG AMAZING, 
IT'S AMAZING!"

1030
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:54,000
AND HE WAS LIKE, "ARE THERE
ANY OTHER GOOD RAPPERS

1031
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:55,667
I SHOULD LISTEN TO?"

1032
00:37:55,701 --> 00:37:57,267
I WAS LIKE, "OH, YOU EVER LISTEN
TO ANY WU-TANG CLAN?"

1033
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,601
HE'S LIKE,
"NO, BUT I'VE HEARD OF HIM.

1034
00:37:58,634 --> 00:38:00,534
HE RAPS A LOT ABOUT
KARATE, RIGHT?"

1035
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:02,467
AND I WAS LIKE,
"NOT EXACTLY."

1036
00:38:02,501 --> 00:38:04,801
AND...

1037
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:07,834
SO I COPIED THAT CONVERSATION
AND EMAILED IT TO KANYE.

1038
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,234
AND HE RESPONDED
BACK RIGHT AWAY.

1039
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:12,567
HE GOES, "WOW!
NEW FANS!

1040
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:16,434
YAY! MORE PEOPLE
THAT DON'T HATE ME!"

1041
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:18,167
THAT'S HOW HIS EMAILS
SOUND TO ME.

1042
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,567
AND--
[laughter]

1043
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,267
AND THEN A LITTLE BIT LATER,
I GET ANOTHER I-M FROM DARWISH.

1044
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,734
HE'S LIKE,
"AZIZ!

1045
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:28,634
"THAT KANYE SONG 
 FLASHING LIGHTS,

1046
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,067
"THAT'S A RIP-OFF
OF A NE-YO TRACK.

1047
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,734
KANYE STOLE THAT BEAT!"

1048
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,133
AND I WAS LIKE,
"REALLY?"

1049
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:35,667
HE'S LIKE, "YEAH.

1050
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:38,801
WHAT'S KANYE'S EMAIL?"

1051
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:41,033
AND I WAS LIKE,
"YOU'RE REALLY GONNA EMAIL HIM?"

1052
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:44,968
AND HE GOES, "I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S PRETTY MESSED UP."

1053
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,868
AND SO I WAS LIKE,
"I'LL EMAIL HIM FOR YOU."

1054
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:48,367
AND SO I SEND
THAT CONVERSATION TO HIM.

1055
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,934
I WAS LIKE, "OH, SHIT.

1056
00:38:49,968 --> 00:38:52,267
DARWISH IS ACCUSING YOU
OF JACKING BEATS, HOMIE!"

1057
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,767
AND THEN RESPONDS BACK
RIGHT AWAY.

1058
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:55,367
HE GOES, "NO!

1059
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,868
THAT SONG
CAME OUT AFTERWARDS!"

1060
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:59,100
[laughter]

1061
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:00,400
AND I SHOWED THAT
TO DARWISH,

1062
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:02,100
AND, YOU KNOW,
DARWISH APOLOGIZED

1063
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,868
AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST PASTED
ALL THOSE CONVERSATIONS

1064
00:39:03,901 --> 00:39:05,434
ON MY WEB SITE.

1065
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:07,434
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY,
I WENT ON KANYE'S BLOG

1066
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,067
AND I SAW THIS.

1067
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,267
THAT'S MY COUSIN DARWISH!

1068
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,067
KANYE WEST VERSUS DARWISH!

1069
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,000
SO I CALLED UP DARWISH,

1070
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:20,133
AND I'M LIKE,
"HEY, DARWISH.

1071
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:22,067
HAVE YOU BEEN ON KANYE'S
WEB SITE BEFORE?"

1072
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,467
HE'S LIKE, "NO.
HE'S GOT A WEB SITE?"

1073
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:25,267
KEEP IN MIND,
DARWISH IS NOW, LIKE,

1074
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,501
THE HUGEST KANYE WEST FAN
RIGHT NOW.

1075
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:29,434
AND I WAS LIKE, "HAVE YOU
BEEN ON HIS WEB SITE?"

1076
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,634
HE WAS LIKE, "NO."

1077
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,100
I WAS LIKE, "GO ON THERE
RIGHT NOW."

1078
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:32,934
HE GOES ON THERE.

1079
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:34,567
HE GOES, "WHAT?

1080
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:36,234
I GOTTA GO CHANGE
MY FACEBOOK STATUS!"

1081
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:37,234
CLICK.

1082
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:42,901
[laughter and applause]

1083
00:39:42,934 --> 00:39:44,567
YOU KNOW, MY FAVORITE MUSICIAN
THAT I'VE EVER MET

1084
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:47,501
WAS, UH, R. KELLY,
I THINK.

1085
00:39:47,534 --> 00:39:50,334
AND, UM, IN CASE YOU'RE
NOT FAMILIAR,

1086
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:54,834
R. KELLY IS A BRILLIANT
R&B SINGER/CRAZY PERSON.

1087
00:39:54,868 --> 00:39:56,968
[laughter]

1088
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,300
LIKE, THEY DID AN INTERVIEW
WITH HIM ON B.E.T., RIGHT?

1089
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:02,267
AND THE GUY DOING THE INTERVIEW
WAS PROBABLY A GUY LIKE ME.

1090
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,367
YOU KNOW, HUGE FAN OF R. KELLY
AND HIS MUSIC,

1091
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,167
AND HOPES HE REALLY IS INNOCENT
OF THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS

1092
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,634
HE'S ACCUSED OF.

1093
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:08,968
SO FIRST QUESTION,
THE GUY GOES,

1094
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
"NOW, ROBERT, ARE YOU ATTRACTED
TO TEENAGE GIRLS?"

1095
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:13,834
AND R. KELLY--

1096
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:15,434
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE R. KELLY,
THAT'S EASY, RIGHT?

1097
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:17,701
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS BE LIKE,
"NO, NOT AT ALL. NO!"

1098
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:19,601
THAT'S ALL YOU GOTTA DO, RIGHT?
THAT'S ALL YOU GOTTA DO.

1099
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:22,734
THAT IS NOT
WHAT R. KELLY DOES.

1100
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:26,200
R. KELLY GOES,
"DEFINE 'TEENAGE.' "

1101
00:40:26,234 --> 00:40:28,067
LITERALLY THE WORST ANSWER!

1102
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,567
THE ONLY WORSE ANSWER WOULD HAVE
BEEN HE WENT,

1103
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:31,033
"HA, YEAH."

1104
00:40:31,067 --> 00:40:33,734
[laughter]

1105
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,667
SO THAT'S THE PERSON WE'RE
DEALING WITH.

1106
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:41,234
SO I GO TO HIS CONCERT
WITH MY FRIEND JASON.

1107
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:42,734
WE GET THERE.
SHOW'S SOLD OUT.

1108
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:44,534
PEOPLE ARE PSYCHED
FOR R. KELLY.

1109
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,901
JASON LOOKS OVER AT ME
AND GOES,

1110
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:48,000
"HEY, AZIZ.

1111
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:49,234
"ME AND YOU ARE THE ONLY
TWO WHITE PEOPLE

1112
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:51,467
AT THIS CONCERT."

1113
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:54,100
AND I WAS LIKE, "FIRST OF ALL,
JASON, I'M NOT WHITE.

1114
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:57,267
"SECOND OF ALL, YOU'RE THE ONLY
WHITE GUY AT THIS CONCERT.

1115
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,334
WE MIGHT KILL YOU, JASON!"

1116
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:01,834
[laughter]

1117
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:05,934
SO THE CONCERT STARTS,
AND IT'S INCREDIBLE.

1118
00:41:05,968 --> 00:41:08,300
R. KELLY IS THE BEST SHOWMAN.

1119
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:09,868
LIKE, HE HAS THIS PART
IN THE SHOW

1120
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:12,133
WHERE HE HAS SEX
WITH AN INVISIBLE WOMAN.

1121
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,634
YOU CAN SEE
THE SOUND EFFECTS.

1122
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:14,834
SO HE'S, LIKE,
TAKING OFF HER BLOUSE.

1123
00:41:14,868 --> 00:41:16,267
[imitating zippers]

1124
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,200
[imitating slapping]

1125
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:20,167
[imitating explosion]

1126
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,267
AND THEN WHEN HE DOES THE...
[imitating explosion]

1127
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,167
A SPOTLIGHT SHOOTS
OUT OF HIS COCK,

1128
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,534
AND THEN GOES OVER
THE WHOLE AUDIENCE

1129
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,701
LIKE HE'S COMING
ON THE WHOLE CROWD.

1130
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:29,334
AND THEN A SPOTLIGHT
HITS A SCREEN,

1131
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,901
AND THE SCREEN EXPLODES!

1132
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:33,367
AND I WAS LIKE,
"WHOA!

1133
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,834
"YOU ARE NOT GONNA
SEE SHIT LIKE THAT

1134
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:36,868
AT A MODEST MOUSE CONCERT!"

1135
00:41:36,901 --> 00:41:40,467
WOW!

1136
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,901
AND THEN, LIKE, THERE'S
ALL THIS OTHER WEIRD STUFF.

1137
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,968
LIKE, AT ONE POINT,
HE LEAVES THE STAGE, RIGHT?

1138
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,033
AND THEY CUT TO A VIDEO
OF HIM PLAYING BASKETBALL

1139
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:48,534
WITH HIS FRIENDS.

1140
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:49,534
LASTS ABOUT FOUR MINUTES.

1141
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:51,133
COMES BACK ON STAGE.

1142
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,868
GOES INTO THE NEXT SONG.

1143
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:54,501
DOESN'T ADDRESS WHY
HE SHOWED THAT VIDEO!

1144
00:41:54,534 --> 00:41:56,300
YOU CAN'T DO SHIT
LIKE THAT!

1145
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:58,167
I CAN'T LEAVE THE STAGE,
SHOW YOU SOME VIDEO OF ME

1146
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,167
PLAYING FOOSBALL
WITH MY BUDDIES,

1147
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200
AND THEN COME BACK
AND BE LIKE,

1148
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:01,334
"MAN, iPHONES ARE CRAZY."

1149
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:02,434
YOU'D BE LIKE,
"YO, MAN, WHAT WAS UP

1150
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:03,434
"WITH THAT VIDEO
YOU SHOWED?

1151
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:04,801
"YOU GOT TO EXPLAIN
THAT SHIT!

1152
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:06,200
THAT WAS WEIRD!"

1153
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:08,901
[laughter and applause]

1154
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,200
THEN, YOU KNOW,
WE GO BACKSTAGE

1155
00:42:12,234 --> 00:42:12,968
AND MEET HIM
AT THE END OF THE SHOW.

1156
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,434
HE'S VERY NICE.

1157
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:15,501
HE'S LIKE,
"HEY, YOU GUYS SHOULD COME

1158
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:16,334
TO THIS AFTERPARTY
WE'RE DOING."

1159
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,000
AND I WAS LIKE,
"YEAH, SURE."

1160
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:19,334
AND SO WE GO
TO THIS NIGHTCLUB

1161
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:21,000
AND ONCE AGAIN,
JASON AND I ARE

1162
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:22,801
THE ONLY TWO WHITE
PEOPLE THERE.

1163
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:26,033
AND WHEN PEOPLE KNOW R. KELLY'S
IN A NIGHTCLUB,

1164
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:28,167
THEY LOSE THEIR SHIT.

1165
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,300
AND THEN HE TOOK THE STAGE AND
PEOPLE WENT NUTS.

1166
00:42:31,334 --> 00:42:33,334
AND HE STARTED DOING
THAT SONG THAT'S LIKE,

1167
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:34,801
"I'M IN LOVE
WITH A STRIPPER."

1168
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:36,701
AND HE'S DOING THE SONG
AND AT ONE POINT,

1169
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:38,334
THIS WOMAN JUST
JUMPS ONSTAGE

1170
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:39,701
AND STARTS
GIVING HIM A LAP DANCE.

1171
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:42,133
SHE FINISHES THE LAP DANCE
AND R. KELLY GOES,

1172
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:43,334
"* WHO CAN TOP THAT SHIT

1176
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:48,901
SECOND WOMAN COMES ONSTAGE,
GIVES HIM

1177
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:50,767
AN EVEN CRAZIER LAP DANCE.

1178
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,734
AND R. KELLY GOES,

1179
00:42:52,767 --> 00:42:53,634
"* WHO CAN TOP THAT SHIT 

1180
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:54,834

1182
00:42:56,567 --> 00:42:58,834
THIRD WOMAN COMES ONSTAGE

1183
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,300
WHIPS 'EM OUT,
SLAPS THE FIRST THREE ROWS,

00:43:01,334 --> 00:43:02,634
GRABS R. KELLY'S HEAD

1185
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,834
"ARRGH!"

1186
00:43:05,868 --> 00:43:08,367
AND THEN R. KELLY POPS OUT HIS
HEAD AND GOES,

1187
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,801
"* WHOA 

1188
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:11,501

1190
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:14,434
AND HE LEAVES.

1191
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:18,934
AND I WAS LIKE, "WHOA!

1192
00:43:18,968 --> 00:43:21,601

20 MINUTES IN,
HE STOPS EVERYTHING,

1196
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:29,634
AND HE STARTS TALKING
TO THE CROWD.

1197
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,467
AND WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT
THAT IS THAT R. KELLY

1198
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:33,167
DOES NOT TALK
LIKE YOU AND I TALK.

1199
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,367
HE TALKS LIKE R. KELLY TALKS.

1200
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,834
SO HE GOES LIKE THIS.

1201
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:40,968

00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:37,000
THIS GUY DEFINITELY KNOWS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

1326
00:48:37,033 --> 00:48:39,968
BUT...I CAME UP FOR AIR.

1327
00:48:40,033 --> 00:48:41,701
AND THINGS ARE FINE.

1328
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:44,334
BUT I KIND OF WISH
I WOULD HAVE DROWNED,

1329
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:47,701
'CAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE
MOST BALLER DEATH OF ALL TIME.

1330
00:48:47,734 --> 00:48:49,968
THEY'D BE LIKE,
"HEY, RANDY'S PARENTS,

1331
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,834
"THERE'S BEEN A TERRIBLE
CUNNILINIGUS ACCIDENT.

1332
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:54,767
"YEAH, RANDY WAS EATING PUSSY
UNDERWATER.

1333
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:58,467
I KNOW IT'S AWESOME,
BUT HE'S DEAD."

1334
00:48:58,501 --> 00:48:59,868
I'D HAVE THIS AWESOME
HEADSTONE.

1335
00:48:59,901 --> 00:49:01,234
IT'D BE LIKE,
"HERE LIES RANDY.

1336
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:02,767
HE DIED WHILE EATING PUSSY."

1337
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:04,067
AND THEN IT'LL HAVE
MY HANDPRINT RIGHT THERE

1338
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,767
AND YOU WALK BY, THE HANDPRINT
WILL GIVE YOU A HIGH-FIVE.

1339
00:49:05,801 --> 00:49:09,634
BA-PAM! BA-PAM!
BA-PAM! BA-PAM!

1340
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:13,367
[laughter and applause]

1341
00:49:14,968 --> 00:49:18,067
FELLAS, YOU EVER BEEN
IN THIS SITUATION?

1342
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,267
YOU GOT A GIRL BACK AT YOUR
PLACE AND SHE'S DOWN.

1343
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,934
YOU'RE ALL EXCITED.

1344
00:49:21,968 --> 00:49:22,968
YOU'RE LIKE,
"* I'M GONNA GET MY FUCK ON 

1345
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,834
"* I'M GONNA GET MY FUCK ON 

1346
00:49:24,868 --> 00:49:27,501
"* I'M GONNA GET
MY FUCK ON TONIGHT *

1347
00:49:27,534 --> 00:49:29,467
"* YES I'M GONNA
GET MY FUCK ON *

1348
00:49:29,501 --> 00:49:31,400
"* I'M GONNA GET MY FUCK ON 

1349
00:49:31,434 --> 00:49:34,400
"* I'M GONNA GET
MY FUCK ON TONIGHT *

1350
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:36,434
"* YES I'M GONNA
GET MY FUCK ON *

1351
00:49:36,467 --> 00:49:37,734
"* I'M GONNA GET MY FUCK ON 

1352
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:41,501
* I'M GONNA GET MY FUCK
ON TONIGHT *"

1353
00:49:41,534 --> 00:49:43,901
AND SHE'S LIKE,
"RANDY, STOP DANCING."

1354
00:49:43,934 --> 00:49:45,968
[laughter]

1355
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,367
AND YOU DO.

1356
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,367
YOU STOP DANCING,
THEN YOU HEAD TO THE BEDROOM,

1357
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,968
AND YOU ABOUT TO SET IT OFF.

1358
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,267
AND WHAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME
YOU GET TO THIS MOMENT, FELLAS?

1359
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,634
WHAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME
YOU GET TO THIS MOMENT?

1360
00:49:55,667 --> 00:50:02,000
YOU GOT TO TAKE
A HUGE SHIT!

1361
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:03,834
SO YOU RUN IN THE BATHROOM AND
START PLAYING THE GAME

1362
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:05,834
THAT RANDY LIKES TO CALL,
"MAKE A LOT OF NOISE

1363
00:50:05,868 --> 00:50:08,667
SO IT DON'T SOUND LIKE YOU
TAKING A SHIT!"

1364
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:10,701
YOU CUTTING ON THE SINK
AND SHOWER.

1365
00:50:10,734 --> 00:50:11,868
SHE'S LIKE, "RANDY,
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?"

1366
00:50:11,901 --> 00:50:13,000
"NOTHING.
I'M JUST BRUSHING MY TEETH

1367
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:14,367
AND TAKING A SHOWER
AT THE SAME TIME."

1368
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,200
BUT THAT'S ENOUGH NOISE EITHER,
SO YOU GOT TO RUN

1369
00:50:15,234 --> 00:50:16,601
IN THE KITCHEN.

1370
00:50:16,634 --> 00:50:17,667
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE BLENDING

1371
00:50:17,701 --> 00:50:18,667
CARROTS AND CELERIES
AND TOMATOES.

1372
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:20,067
SHE'S LIKE, "RANDY WHAT
ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?"

1373
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,200
"BITCH, I'M MAKING

1374
00:50:22,234 --> 00:50:26,367
AND YOU GO BACK TO THE BEDROOM,
AND WHAT DOES SHE SAY?

1375
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,501
WHAT DOES SHE ALWAYS SAY?

1376
00:50:29,534 --> 00:50:30,901
"RANDY?

1377
00:50:30,934 --> 00:50:32,834
"RANDY?

1378
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:35,133
"RANDY?

1379
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:36,901
I GOT TO GO PEE."

1380
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:38,901
"NO!

1381
00:50:38,934 --> 00:50:41,534
YOU GON' SMELL MY SHIT!"

1382
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:46,567
[laughter and applause]

1383
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:50,133
- * RANDY 

1384
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:51,701
- I WAS THINKING
ABOUT THIS THE OTHER DAY.

1385
00:50:51,734 --> 00:50:54,534
YOU KNOW WHAT MUST BE CRAZY?

1386
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:57,000
GETTING YOUR DICK SUCKED
IN AN IGLOO.

1387
00:50:57,033 --> 00:51:00,300
HOW YOU SUPPOSED TO STAY HARD
WHEN IT'S SO COLD?

00:51:00,334 --> 00:51:02,367
IT'D BE LIKE,
"ESKIMO RANDY?

1389
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,000
"ESKIMO RANDY?

1390
00:51:04,033 --> 00:51:06,767
"ESKIMO VERSION OF RANDY?

1391
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:08,667

1392
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:10,601
I'D BE LIKE, "NO!

1393
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,100

1394
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:14,300

[laughter]

1399
00:51:24,901 --> 00:51:27,667

IT'S SIMPLE.

1403
00:51:33,901 --> 00:51:36,200
YOU CAN'T ASK HER
IN YOUR NORMAL VOICE.

1404
00:51:36,234 --> 00:51:37,667
IF I GOT A GIRL BACK
AT MY PLACE, I'M LIKE,

1405
00:51:37,701 --> 00:51:39,234
"HEY, LET'S HAVE SEX
