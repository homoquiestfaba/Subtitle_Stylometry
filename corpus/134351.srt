1
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:35,014
Excuse me.

2
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,281
Shithead.

3
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,304
You shouldn't be here.

4
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,808
I know. Ask for
at least $1,000, okay?

5
00:02:57,876 --> 00:03:00,811
I'll get as much
as I can. You hide.

6
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,780
His wife took his kid
and a couple of million...

7
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,783
and we won't
get a thousand.

8
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,284
Shut up
and stay hidden.

9
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:09,877
I told him
I was coming alone.

10
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,868
Hey, Mr. Crisp.

11
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:07,537
How's it going?

12
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:10,513
You said you had information
about my family.

13
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,709
Yeah, yeah, I do.

14
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:17,218
Well, let's have it.

15
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:22,058
Well, it's going to cost you.

16
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:23,719
Like $1,000?

17
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,499
Okay, that's obviously
not my final offer.

18
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,057
750 would be fine.

19
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:33,364
I mean, more than fine.

20
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:35,963
Just tell me what
you have, Danny...

21
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,976
and I'll take
good care of you.

22
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:40,136
Okay.

23
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:41,645
That sounds fair.

24
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:44,546
I was doing a delivery
for Corky last week

25
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:45,878
out of state...

26
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,748
and I ran into your ex.

27
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,081
How'd she look?

28
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,918
She looked great,
Mr. Crisp. Yeah.

29
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,220
She changed her hair
and stuff...

30
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:57,056
but she looked like
a million dollars.

31
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:00,155
In fact, she looked like
about $3 million.

32
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:03,060
Did she see you?

33
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:05,433
No. I was
changing a tire...

34
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:07,938
and suddenly, there she was
across the street...

35
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:09,906
taking her kid
into this school.

36
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:12,609
My boy?

37
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:13,939
Looked great.

38
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:15,536
He looked very healthy.

39
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:18,947
It's a real nice, healthy place
where they're living.

40
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,678
It snows in winter there.

41
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:22,242
Danny...

42
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,615
where are they?

43
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,057
At the school
where I saw them...

44
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:31,459
Astoria Elementary School.

45
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,792
That's...

46
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:35,560
It's in Astoria, Oregon.

47
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:37,725
All right.

48
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:40,134
Did you tell
anyone else this?

49
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:41,194
No.

50
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:42,365
No way.

51
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,635
Hey, I'm not stupid,
Mr. Crisp.

52
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:48,638
You're not?

53
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,254
Danny.

54
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,094
Danny! No!

55
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,157
Danny!

56
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:12,961
Danny!

57
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:14,232
Get up!

58
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,271
Don't you die on me!

59
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:21,944
I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him.

60
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:23,446
Was it Crisp?

61
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:26,245
I don't know.
I didn't see anything.

62
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:28,445
What are you doing?

63
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,511
Hey, hey, hey!

64
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:32,079
Stop it! Don't do that!

65
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:33,590
Don't go anywhere.

66
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:34,920
Let me go!

67
00:06:34,993 --> 00:06:36,824
No! Let me off of him!

68
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:38,954
I don't like
what you've done.

69
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,497
I really don't like it.

70
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:42,999
It feels terrible,
and it looks dreadful.

71
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:44,467
I'm trying my best.

72
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:46,470
Maybe your best
isn't good enough.

73
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:47,596
I'm back.

74
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:49,503
Oh, great.
Well, that was fast.

75
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:51,132
It was easy.

76
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,643
I have some great, exciting,
wonderful news, Mother.

77
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:55,680
Oh, you always
exaggerate, Cullen.

78
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,681
Everything is always
great, terrific.

79
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,649
So, what's so great?

80
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:02,209
I just found out
where they're hiding.

81
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:05,279
Are you serious?
You really know where he is?

82
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,382
Manicure, Mr. Crisp?

83
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,394
Oh, how could I
say no to you?

84
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:11,622
Tell me.

85
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,061
What's happened?

86
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:15,964
Just let me
handle this myself, Mother.

87
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:17,899
I know what I'm doing.

88
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,561
Everything is under control.

89
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,970
It's all right.
I'm a police officer.

90
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,481
Crisp, you're under arrest.

91
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:33,073
Put your hands on your head

92
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:34,675
and get up!

93
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:36,152
Kimble, not again!

94
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,153
Your hands!

95
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:38,211
They're up.

96
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,053
When will you
leave me alone?

97
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,389
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

98
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,018
Hey, I'm a police officer.

99
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:45,494
This is an arrest.

100
00:07:45,563 --> 00:07:47,588
This man's crazy.
Look at him.

101
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,226
He'll kill me.
You're just going to stand there?

102
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,099
Freeze!

103
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,330
I'm a cop!

104
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:55,373
I'm Detective John Kimble.

105
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,839
This man is under arrest.

106
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:57,875
I'm checking.

107
00:07:57,942 --> 00:07:59,842
You can't just walk in here

108
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:02,379
and put a gun in my face.

109
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:04,278
I'm trying to get a manicure.

110
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,839
I have witnesses.

111
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:08,283
I have a witness, too.

112
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:10,878
It's murder one this time.

113
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:12,183
Now you're mine.

114
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,788
The bastard handcuffed me
to a dead man!

115
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,193
A dead man!

116
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:19,696
Come on. Sit down.

117
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:21,629
Now, did Danny ever say

118
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,600
what Crisp's wife looked like?

119
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:25,192
No.

120
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,433
Did he ever say what name
she was using in Oregon?

121
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,974
He didn't say anything.

122
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,475
Look, I just
want to go home.

123
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,944
After the lineup,
I'll drive you home.

124
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:36,446
I'll even buy you dinner.

125
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,948
I'll even cook you dinner.

126
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:39,950
I'm not doing any lineup...

127
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:43,385
and there ain't jack shit
you can do about it!

128
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:45,980
I've been after Crisp
for four years...

129
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:48,457
and she's letting
my key witness walk away?

130
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,789
Kimble, sit down!

131
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:50,828
Sit down.

132
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:52,056
- Sit.
- Sit.

133
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,332
Now listen to me.

134
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,833
He killed your boyfriend.

135
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:59,336
All you have to do
is point your finger...

136
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:02,339
and we can put him away
for 30 years.

137
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:05,672
He wasn't my boyfriend.
I hardly knew the guy.

138
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:10,914
I know you're in there.

139
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:14,418
I know what you want,
but you ain't getting it.

140
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:16,681
No lineup, no testimony.

141
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:18,848
So shove your handcuffs
up your ass!

142
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:21,188
Now let me out of here!

143
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:22,351
Slow down!

144
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:24,452
Open it and let me out!

145
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,100
O'Hara, meet Kimble.

146
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:34,104
Kimble's been on this
a long time.

147
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:35,104
Hi.

148
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,107
Let me take care of Cindy.

149
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:39,143
She'll make Crisp.
I guarantee it.

150
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,609
What are you going to do...

151
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,112
handcuff her to your car

152
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,114
and take her for a ride?

153
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:46,776
I'm not going to offer
to cook her dinner.

154
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:48,716
Kimble, hold on a second. L...

155
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:51,551
Difficult man.
Got to get to know him.

156
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,147
Oh, I can't wait.

157
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,015
Hey, baby.

158
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,074
What you mean, "Hey, baby"?

159
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:26,154
¿Dónde vas?

160
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:31,087
Shit!

161
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:33,696
Oh, excuse me.

162
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:36,199
I forgot to introduce myself.

163
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:40,696
My name is John Kimble...

164
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,706
and I love my car.

165
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:45,004
I'll keep an eye
on it for you.

166
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:47,510
You got a beautiful ride.

167
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,070
Shit. Who does
he think he is?

168
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:52,912
He's lucky I didn't
kick his ass.

169
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,249
Open up.

170
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:28,376
You can't come in.

171
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:35,550
Thank you.

172
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,652
What the fuck?

173
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:54,233
All right...

174
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:55,506
party's over.

175
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,445
Everyone go home.

176
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,686
Next time, my place.

177
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:04,017
So who are you, man?

178
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,181
Shit!

179
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,590
I'm the party-pooper.

180
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:12,752
Hi, Cindy.

181
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,801
Do you mind if I sit down?

182
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:19,029
No.

183
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:21,265
Sit down, man.

184
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,010
Oh, it's so nice
to see you again.

185
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:29,012
What are you doing here,
you asshole?

186
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,981
Cindy, I don't like you
using foul language...

187
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,518
not a classy girl
like you.

188
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:37,487
Don't you have
anything better to do?

189
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:38,988
You don't understand.

190
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:41,321
I have nothing else to do...

191
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:44,190
and I have nowhere else to go.

192
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:47,823
Why are you staring
at me like that?

193
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:49,457
I like you, Cindy.

194
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,469
I'm going to be
around you a lot...

195
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:54,630
days, nights,
weekends, holidays.

196
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:55,832
No.

197
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:57,374
No, you can't.

198
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:58,875
Yes, I can.

199
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:01,878
I'm going to
hang out with you

200
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:03,914
until the end of time.

201
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:07,474
All right, move it in. Let's go.

202
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:09,543
Step onto the numbers.

203
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:12,016
Face front.

204
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:16,589
Everybody, hands to your side.

205
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:18,322
That's the creep.

206
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:19,488
Who?

207
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:21,225
Number five.

208
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:22,823
That's him.

209
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:27,400
Good.

210
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:28,404
Very good.

211
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,435
Mr. Crisp, you will be
remanded into custody

212
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,943
until your trial.

213
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:35,775
Bailiff, remove the prisoner.

214
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,337
Shh. Don't say anything.

215
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:38,780
Just take it easy.

216
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,410
I'll take care of it.
Trust me.

217
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:47,783
You know what to do?

218
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:50,384
I'm your mother, aren't I?

219
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:02,029
Mind if I talk
to my friend a little bit?

220
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:04,301
I'm not talking to anybody
without my lawyer.

221
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,899
He's right in here.

222
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:13,549
You give me the names

223
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:15,552
of your drug suppliers
and distributors...

224
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,053
and I'll tell the judge

225
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:19,555
what a nice, cooperative killer
you are.

226
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:22,457
You think the jury's
going to convict me

227
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:24,961
on the testimony
of that junkie?

228
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,997
You could be right.

229
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:34,231
But what about your wife?

230
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:35,772
You remember her?

231
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,240
All that hard-earned drug money

232
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:39,833
she stole from you?

233
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,845
How much was it...

234
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:43,574
$3 million?

235
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:47,015
I bet she would make
a much better witness.

236
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,485
Kimble, you've wasted years
chasing after me...

237
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:51,522
and what has it
gotten you, hmm?

238
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:52,521
Nothing.

239
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,490
I'll be out in a week...

240
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,027
and you'll still be
eating take-out food

241
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:58,926
in that dump you live in.

242
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:01,989
Yeah, I know all
about you, Kimble.

243
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:05,126
Without me, you wouldn't
even have a life.

244
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:07,967
My old lady left
'cause of the money.

245
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,601
Yours left because she just
couldn't stand the sight of you.

246
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:16,269
I've never seen anyone
so little

247
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:17,712
eat so much.

248
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:19,272
Yeah, I know.
I'm hypoglycemic.

249
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,783
If I don't eat regularly...

250
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:22,786
I get a little nuts.

251
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:24,788
So... where you from?

252
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:25,720
Austria.

253
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,725
How long you been a cop?

254
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:31,227
I been a cop for 12 years.

255
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:32,729
My father was a cop...

256
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:34,230
my brother was a cop...

257
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:36,233
my mother was a cop's wife.

258
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:38,496
And I have no hobbies.

259
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:42,528
You two are booked on the first
flight to Portland tomorrow.

260
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:45,542
Locate Crisp's wife
and offer her immunity

261
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,078
in exchange for
her testimony against him.

262
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:49,545
No offense to O'Hallahan...

263
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:54,051
but this is my case,
and I work alone.

264
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:56,086
He works alone.

265
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:57,086
Not anymore.

266
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:58,588
She's going in undercover

267
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:01,216
as a substitute
kindergarten teacher.

268
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,692
Not exactly a job for you.

269
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:05,695
I used to be a teacher.

270
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:07,162
We'll be fine.

271
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:08,698
What do I do?

272
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:09,926
She locates the kid...

273
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,435
you find the mother
and the cash...

274
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:14,937
and Crisp spends his life
making license plates.

275
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:16,166
Bon voyage.

276
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,698
Oh, and, Kimble,
the name's O'Hara.

277
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:26,616
OK. Here's the wife at 17.

278
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:28,618
Real name's Rachel Myatt.

279
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:31,120
She's from Hannibal, Missouri,
class of '76.

280
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:32,281
Cheerleader, first violin

281
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:33,585
in the school orchestra...

282
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:35,592
captain of the girls'
softball team.

283
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,629
Her ambition was "To travel...

284
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,960
experience life...

285
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:42,431
and meet interesting people."

286
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,400
Like Crisp.

287
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:45,458
Okay.

288
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:50,271
Relax.

289
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,308
Don't let him get to you.

290
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:55,978
That's her 10 years later.

291
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:58,480
It's a great shot of an ear.

292
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:01,039
You get in touch
with her parents?

293
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:02,483
They're both dead.

294
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:05,316
The only relative
she's got left is the kid.

295
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:07,323
Hey.

296
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:14,722
Okay. This is the only picture
we have of him.

297
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:17,631
Cullen Jr., aged 3 months.

298
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:18,633
That helps much.

299
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:20,602
It's the best I could do.

300
00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:21,603
Breakfast, sir? Ma'am?

301
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:22,604
Please.

302
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:23,935
No. No, no.

303
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:25,235
That's a first.

304
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:29,345
Listen, I was
just thinking.

305
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:31,938
Maybe we should
take a wild stab

306
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:33,949
at getting to know each other

307
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:35,951
before we have to pretend
we're married.

308
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,953
What do you want to know?

309
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:39,989
How long have we been married?

310
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:41,490
A long time.

311
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:44,686
People won't expect us
to talk much to each other.

312
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:46,661
I want to read it, too.

313
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,628
Stop it.

314
00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:49,029
Please?

315
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,623
Let me take a look.

316
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:53,135
Hey, come here.

317
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:55,671
If you don't stop
screwing around back there...

318
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:58,037
this is what
I'll do with you.

319
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:03,444
Ohh.

320
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:04,878
What's the matter?

321
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:06,210
I don't know.

322
00:18:06,283 --> 00:18:08,376
I just don't feel so good.

323
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:09,612
You hungry?

324
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:12,450
I got to get out
of here right now.

325
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:15,355
Get those tree stumps
out of my way

326
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:17,450
before I vomit all over them.

327
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:23,859
Is your wife okay, sir?

328
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:26,061
Compared to what?

329
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:35,010
Maybe it was the burrito.

330
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:38,639
Or it could've been the sausages.

331
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:41,149
I don't think it was
the crab salad.

332
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:43,152
It couldn't
have been the doughnuts.

333
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:45,243
Excuse me.

334
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:49,588
Oh, I hate feeling like this.

335
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:51,388
I hate it, too.

336
00:18:53,997 --> 00:18:54,895
Uh-oh.

337
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:56,432
Uh-oh what?

338
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,400
Uh-oh...

339
00:18:58,468 --> 00:18:59,492
pull over.

340
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:00,433
Now?

341
00:19:00,504 --> 00:19:01,869
Yeah. Please hurry.

342
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:19,586
The key!

343
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,123
Give me the key!

344
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:50,810
Do you need a hand?

345
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:12,064
You okay?

346
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:13,234
I'm fine.

347
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:27,489
I'll be fine.

348
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:31,118
Class starts
at 9:00 in the morning.

349
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:32,661
I'll be fine.

350
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:34,629
You look much better already.

351
00:20:34,698 --> 00:20:37,997
Oh. Kindergarten, 6-year-olds.

352
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:40,502
That's why I quit teaching,
you know.

353
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,438
I got so sick
of other people's kids.

354
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:48,136
I was afraid that
I'd never want to have any

355
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:49,701
of my own.

356
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:57,484
I have a son.

357
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:01,181
He's 13.

358
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:04,693
I remember
when he was 5.

359
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:07,662
He lives with his mother
and stepfather.

360
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:10,291
Aah!

361
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:12,232
What's the matter?

362
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:13,234
What...

363
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:14,235
is...

364
00:21:14,304 --> 00:21:15,669
that?

365
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:18,207
Oh, excuse me.
I forgot to tell you.

366
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:19,674
This is my ferret.

367
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:21,734
He doesn't bite.
Don't worry.

368
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,353
Come on.
Come on out.

369
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:34,413
This is all I need...
an obstacle.

370
00:21:34,491 --> 00:21:36,083
A goddamn obstacle.

371
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,320
He sends me an obstacle.

372
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:39,419
Here.

373
00:21:56,746 --> 00:21:58,611
Oh, God.

374
00:22:00,517 --> 00:22:03,042
Don't worry.

375
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,552
I'm going to make it.

376
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:07,954
I just need a minute.

377
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:10,959
I'll be ready
in just a minute.

378
00:22:11,027 --> 00:22:12,551
I just got...

379
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,190
Oh, God.

380
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:24,973
How do I look?

381
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:31,580
Take off the gun.

382
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:35,279
That's a good idea.

383
00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:42,616
The little bastards
are going to eat you alive.

384
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,260
Get some rest,
and don't worry.

385
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:49,298
I've been working undercover
for a long time.

386
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:50,799
They're 6-year-olds.

387
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:53,233
How much trouble
can they be?

388
00:22:53,303 --> 00:22:56,101
On second thought...

389
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:58,800
take the gun.

390
00:23:26,536 --> 00:23:28,197
Matthew...

391
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:30,705
I sent you to
the principal's office

392
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:32,264
because you punched Jenny.

393
00:23:32,342 --> 00:23:35,368
I know. She poisoned
your hamsters.

394
00:23:35,445 --> 00:23:37,379
She told me all about it...

395
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:38,880
and she's very sorry.

396
00:23:38,948 --> 00:23:42,475
And I'm sorry that
I didn't believe you.

397
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,980
- But you shouldn't punch people.
- But she...

398
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:49,855
Mr. Kimble, Miss Schlowski
will see you now.

399
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:52,719
Let's go back to class.

400
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,667
Can I help you?

401
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:01,829
I'm John Kimble,
your new kindergarten teacher.

402
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:06,570
We were expecting
a Miss O'Hara.

403
00:24:06,643 --> 00:24:09,510
There's been
a change of plan.

404
00:24:11,314 --> 00:24:13,179
Four weeks into
the new semester...

405
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:17,208
my superintendent told me
I had to replace Mrs. Hagley...

406
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:20,688
a kindergarten teacher
of 25 years' experience...

407
00:24:20,757 --> 00:24:22,725
with an undercover
police officer...

408
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:25,226
and he wouldn't even tell me why.

409
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:28,230
I don't suppose you
would do me the courtesy

410
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:29,765
of filling me in.

411
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,232
I can't do that.

412
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:32,268
Oh.

413
00:24:32,335 --> 00:24:34,326
You can't do that.

414
00:24:34,404 --> 00:24:35,871
I'm watching you.

415
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:38,339
All I have to do
is tell my parents

416
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:40,342
that you're
with the police...

417
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,877
and they'll yank their kids

418
00:24:41,945 --> 00:24:43,936
out of this school so fast...

419
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:45,446
we'd have to close.

420
00:24:45,515 --> 00:24:47,244
And don't you think I won't

421
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:50,775
if I feel my children
are in any danger.

422
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:53,015
They're not in danger.

423
00:24:54,991 --> 00:25:00,019
I assume you have
some teaching experience.

424
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:02,530
They wouldn't have
sent me otherwise.

425
00:25:12,608 --> 00:25:14,940
Just wait here a minute.

426
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:24,716
Everybody sit down
on the carpet!

427
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:33,057
Good morning, everyone.

428
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:36,790
Good morning, Miss Schlowski.

429
00:25:36,832 --> 00:25:38,823
Your teacher, Mrs. Hagley

430
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:41,870
had to go on
an important trip.

431
00:25:41,937 --> 00:25:43,063
Where'd she go?

432
00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:44,605
That doesn't matter.

433
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:45,935
Did she die?

434
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:49,205
No, Lowell.
She went to see someone.

435
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:50,609
Did they die?

436
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,772
No, Lowell.

437
00:25:52,848 --> 00:25:54,748
Everyone dies, you know.

438
00:25:54,817 --> 00:25:58,913
I know, but not
for a long, long time.

439
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:01,684
Now, until Mrs. Hagley
comes back...

440
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:05,352
we have someone special to help.

441
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:07,622
This is Mr. Kimble...

442
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:10,290
your new kindergarten teacher.

443
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:23,573
Now, let's everybody say,
"Good morning, Mr. Kimble."

444
00:26:23,646 --> 00:26:27,946
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

445
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:29,484
Good morning.

446
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:32,385
They're all yours.

447
00:26:32,454 --> 00:26:34,479
I'll be watching you.

448
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:41,294
Hi.

449
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:45,767
How are you?

450
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:50,304
I'm very happy to be here.

451
00:26:50,372 --> 00:26:53,307
First I would like
to just get to know you.

452
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:00,673
Quiet.

453
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:05,618
I'm going to ask you
a bunch of questions.

454
00:27:05,688 --> 00:27:08,623
I want to have them
answered immediately.

455
00:27:08,691 --> 00:27:11,626
How many of you
were born in Astoria?

456
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,255
Raise your hands.
Let's see them.

457
00:27:19,735 --> 00:27:21,032
Okay, hmm.

458
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:25,369
Now, anyone that was not
born in Astoria...

459
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:27,033
somewhere outside
like California...

460
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:28,633
raise your hands.

461
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:37,809
Yes.

462
00:27:37,886 --> 00:27:40,446
I need to go
to the bathroom.

463
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,519
Okay. You can go.

464
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,727
Boys have a penis.

465
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:49,229
Girls have a vagina.

466
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:53,334
Thanks for the tip.

467
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:56,730
Yes?

468
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:59,239
I need to go
to the bathroom...

469
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:01,868
and I can't get
these things off.

470
00:28:09,451 --> 00:28:11,851
I'll get someone
to help you.

471
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,979
I'll be right back, okay?

472
00:28:21,664 --> 00:28:24,326
You've learned that
the "e" is often silent

473
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,028
when it immediately
follows another vowel.

474
00:28:27,102 --> 00:28:29,593
Now write and say
these words...

475
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:33,503
Oh, um...

476
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:35,008
class, uh, Catherine...

477
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:38,012
can you take over
for me, please?

478
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,206
Thank you.

479
00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:43,250
"E" is the fifth letter
of the alphabet.

480
00:28:43,318 --> 00:28:44,876
Yes, can I help you?

481
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:47,444
I have a problem.

482
00:28:47,523 --> 00:28:49,047
Mr. Kimble...

483
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:52,025
I need to go real bad.

484
00:28:53,262 --> 00:28:54,593
First day?

485
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:56,255
Yes.

486
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:57,798
I'll take care of her.

487
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:58,958
Thank you.

488
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:04,598
You know, kindergarten
is like the ocean.

489
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:06,800
Don't turn your back on it.

490
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,536
They're okay.

491
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,271
Don't worry.

492
00:29:10,345 --> 00:29:11,972
Everything is under control.

493
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:16,809
No.

494
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,216
Monsters.

495
00:29:21,857 --> 00:29:24,155
What are you doing with this?

496
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,814
Aren't you going
to break it up?

497
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:49,851
No. Two more days of this...

498
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:51,783
and he'll quit.

499
00:30:00,763 --> 00:30:04,096
Shut up!

500
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:07,626
Shut up! Shut up!

501
00:30:07,703 --> 00:30:09,603
Shut up.

502
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,142
No.

503
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:17,644
Don't start this.

504
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:32,349
Aah!

505
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,541
Attention!

506
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:56,918
This is your new class mascot.

507
00:30:56,985 --> 00:30:58,976
What happened to your dog?

508
00:30:59,054 --> 00:31:01,420
This is not a dog.

509
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,923
This is a ferret.

510
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:04,390
What's a ferret?

511
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:05,824
That's a ferret.

512
00:31:05,894 --> 00:31:07,361
Oh!

513
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:10,398
If he bites you,
you get rabies and die.

514
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:12,160
No. That's not true.

515
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:13,701
He never bites.

516
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:15,168
Can I pet him?

517
00:31:15,237 --> 00:31:18,172
Sure, but one at a time, okay?

518
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,107
Good. Okay, next one.
Come on.

519
00:31:21,176 --> 00:31:22,905
Yes.

520
00:31:22,978 --> 00:31:24,240
Good.

521
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:25,507
Yeah.

522
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:28,950
Good. Now we're having fun.

523
00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:56,911
What's that
supposed to mean?

524
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:59,812
Mrs. Hagley
is a lot better than you.

525
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:01,543
Is she?

526
00:32:02,818 --> 00:32:04,479
Is she really?

527
00:32:06,455 --> 00:32:09,390
My mom's a teacher
in this school...

528
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,983
and she's a lot better
than you, too.

529
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,118
Great.

530
00:32:13,195 --> 00:32:15,322
On Monday nights,
my mom tutors

531
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:17,831
and Mrs. Quinn
takes care of me.

532
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,663
She's better than you, too.

533
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:21,293
Great.

534
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,270
And Frankie,
my swimming teacher...

535
00:32:23,338 --> 00:32:27,832
and Gus, my T-ball coach,
are better than you, too.

536
00:32:29,478 --> 00:32:31,412
I really appreciate
your honesty.

537
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,007
You happen to know someone
that's not better than me?

538
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:41,012
I don't know
that many people.

539
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:53,767
John?

540
00:32:53,835 --> 00:32:55,496
Are you there?

541
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:01,703
How did it go?

542
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:06,543
Go away.

543
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:08,810
It went that well, huh?

544
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:13,383
You take over tomorrow.

545
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:15,889
And blow our cover?

546
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,482
Can't do it.

547
00:33:18,961 --> 00:33:21,054
They're horrible.

548
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:23,154
Tell me about it.

549
00:33:39,815 --> 00:33:41,043
He's gay.

550
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:43,813
What kind of a man
teaches kindergarten?

551
00:33:43,886 --> 00:33:45,376
He's obviously gay.

552
00:33:45,454 --> 00:33:48,753
A male kindergarten teacher
isn't what I'm used to.

553
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:50,849
Samantha calls him
"The giant."

554
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:54,828
There he is.

555
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:55,921
Where, honey?

556
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:02,769
Holy cow, is that
your new teacher?

557
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:03,930
Yeah.

558
00:34:04,006 --> 00:34:05,564
Oh, my God.

559
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:07,874
What are you doing?

560
00:34:07,944 --> 00:34:10,674
- I'm not wearing makeup.
- None of us are.

561
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:13,180
You're married.
You're allowed to look like slobs.

562
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:16,685
Be good. I'll be back
to pick you up.

563
00:34:16,752 --> 00:34:18,185
Good morning,
Mr. Kimble.

564
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:19,186
Good morning.

565
00:34:19,255 --> 00:34:21,723
I told you he was big.

566
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,782
Play with the kids, honey.

567
00:34:26,495 --> 00:34:28,395
Hi. I'm Jillian,
Sylvester's mom.

568
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:30,432
Do you have a minute?

569
00:34:30,499 --> 00:34:32,899
I'd like to speak with you.

570
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,402
Sure.

571
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,732
Please.

572
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:37,033
Thank you.

573
00:34:37,106 --> 00:34:38,539
A male kindergarten teacher.

574
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:40,132
That's unusual.

575
00:34:41,477 --> 00:34:44,105
You're not from
around here, are you?

576
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,148
No. I'm not.

577
00:34:46,215 --> 00:34:47,648
Neither am I.

578
00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:48,741
Huh.

579
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:51,477
Anyway...

580
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:52,919
um...

581
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,957
I have a small problem.

582
00:34:55,024 --> 00:34:55,991
Yes?

583
00:34:56,058 --> 00:34:57,457
You see, Sylvester's father

584
00:34:57,526 --> 00:34:59,960
doesn't live with us anymore...

585
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:02,930
and I've just been
worried about Sylvester.

586
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:05,832
He's been acting
a little strange lately...

587
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:07,892
You know, doing odd things.

588
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,096
Like what?

589
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:12,004
Well, it seems
that's he's becoming

590
00:35:12,074 --> 00:35:15,009
a little obsessed
with playing with dolls.

591
00:35:15,077 --> 00:35:16,510
You know, it's weird.

592
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:18,843
I think I can help you
with that.

593
00:35:18,914 --> 00:35:20,279
Really?

594
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:23,011
He uses the dolls
to look up girls' skirts.

595
00:35:23,085 --> 00:35:25,519
I caught him
doing it yesterday.

596
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:28,022
Oh. Oh, well,
that's a relief.

597
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,082
But I'll keep
an eye on him, okay?

598
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,684
Thank you.

599
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:35,287
Does Sylvester
ever see his father?

600
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:39,868
No. No, not since he was 2.

601
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:42,768
His father lives in California.

602
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:44,863
That is far away.

603
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,430
Mm-hmm.

604
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:49,706
Well, if you give me
his name and number...

605
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:51,713
I could talk to him

606
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:54,045
about taking
more interest in his son.

607
00:35:54,116 --> 00:35:56,311
That's very kind,
but I don't think so.

608
00:35:56,385 --> 00:35:59,013
But it's tough on Sylvester,
don't you think?

609
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:00,112
No.

610
00:36:00,189 --> 00:36:02,020
No, what's tough on Sylvester

611
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:04,559
is his father left us
for another man.

612
00:36:05,928 --> 00:36:08,726
Are you married,
Mr. Kimble?

613
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:11,232
No, I'm not.

614
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:16,635
He's not married, Mom!

615
00:36:17,773 --> 00:36:19,206
Welcome to Astoria...

616
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:21,539
the single-parent capital
of America.

617
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,441
Thank you for your time.

618
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:26,206
I pledge allegiance

619
00:36:26,282 --> 00:36:28,546
to the flag

620
00:36:28,617 --> 00:36:32,053
of the United States
of America...

621
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:34,419
and to the republic

622
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,424
for which it stands...

623
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:39,893
one nation, under God...

624
00:36:39,962 --> 00:36:41,930
indivisible...

625
00:36:41,997 --> 00:36:45,763
with liberty
and justice for all.

626
00:36:51,974 --> 00:36:53,999
Are these all your lunches?

627
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:58,447
You mean you eat other
people's lunches?

628
00:36:58,514 --> 00:36:59,674
Stop it!

629
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:07,682
Now we're going to do
something extremely fun.

630
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:10,692
We're going to play
a game called...

631
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,888
"Who is my daddy
and what does he do?"

632
00:37:13,963 --> 00:37:14,861
Yes?

633
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,522
Is your daddy a fireman?

634
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:19,090
He's probably big.
Is he a wrestler?

635
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:20,795
A basketball coach?

636
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,802
No, no.

637
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:23,964
What's the matter?

638
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,438
I have a headache.

639
00:37:25,508 --> 00:37:27,237
It might be a tumor.

640
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:28,776
It's not a tumor!

641
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:31,312
It's not a tumor at all.

642
00:37:32,948 --> 00:37:34,381
What I meant was...

643
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,419
you tell me who is your daddy

644
00:37:37,486 --> 00:37:39,317
and what does he do?

645
00:37:39,388 --> 00:37:40,616
Oh.

646
00:37:41,657 --> 00:37:42,624
Get it?

647
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:44,318
We start right here. You.

648
00:37:44,393 --> 00:37:49,490
My dad repairs cars
driven by women who are pinheads.

649
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:57,070
My dad doesn't do
anything since the crash.

650
00:37:57,139 --> 00:38:00,905
My dad gives money to people
that doesn't have money...

651
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:02,841
then people use that money...

652
00:38:02,912 --> 00:38:05,346
then they give
other money back

653
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:07,678
and they give the same amount

654
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,014
of money back to my dad.

655
00:38:10,085 --> 00:38:12,781
My dad doesn't live
with us anymore.

656
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:16,086
He lives in New York
and drives a taxi.

657
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:19,184
My mom hopes he's going to die
real soon.

658
00:38:23,432 --> 00:38:26,367
My dad watches TV
all day long.

659
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:31,372
My dad works on computers...

660
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,377
and he's, um, the boss
of his company...

661
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:40,381
and, um, he has a mustache
and a beard.

662
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:41,381
Mm-hmm.

663
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,610
Yeah.

664
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:46,888
He doesn't have that
much hair because...

665
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:49,322
and he...
his head is so big

666
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:51,859
that he can't wear any hats.

667
00:38:51,927 --> 00:38:53,895
My dad's divorced.

668
00:38:53,963 --> 00:38:56,158
My mom's divorced.

669
00:38:56,232 --> 00:38:58,894
My dad, um,
is a psychologist...

670
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:01,903
and he helps people
that are hurt

671
00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:03,836
or lost their feelings...

672
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:06,136
and, um, that's it.

673
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,870
Our mom says that our dad

674
00:39:08,944 --> 00:39:11,674
is a real sex machine.

675
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:18,143
Good.

676
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,155
I don't know
what my dad does.

677
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:24,090
I haven't seen him
in a long time.

678
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:25,717
He lives in France.

679
00:39:27,796 --> 00:39:30,230
My dad is a gynecologist...

680
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:33,894
and he looks at vaginas
all day long.

681
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,901
Mi papá trabaja
en la casa...

682
00:39:38,974 --> 00:39:42,000
y él juega conmigo mucho.

683
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:44,272
Thank you.
Very good.

684
00:39:44,346 --> 00:39:45,938
Okay. Next, uh...

685
00:39:46,015 --> 00:39:48,711
What's his name
with his back to me?

686
00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:50,115
His name's Zach Sullivan.

687
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:52,449
He doesn't like anyone
to talk to him.

688
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:53,954
He's a poo-poo head.

689
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:55,615
He's a poo-poo face.

690
00:39:55,691 --> 00:39:57,784
He's a ca-ca poo-poo.

691
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,351
He's a poo-poo ca-ca.

692
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:03,364
- Poo-poo ca-ca!
- Poo-poo ca-ca!

693
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:05,866
- Poo-poo ca-ca!
- Poo-poo ca-ca!

694
00:40:05,935 --> 00:40:06,867
Quiet.

695
00:40:06,936 --> 00:40:07,925
That's enough.

696
00:40:11,507 --> 00:40:12,633
Hey, Zach.

697
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:15,472
Did your daddy
teach you this game?

698
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,815
Come on, Zach.
Let's all play together.

699
00:40:20,883 --> 00:40:22,783
It's so much more fun.

700
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:24,148
Leave me alone!

701
00:40:25,621 --> 00:40:26,553
What's that?

702
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,252
It's a fire alarm!

703
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:30,656
Come on, come on.

704
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:33,392
Everyone together!
Come on.

705
00:40:33,462 --> 00:40:34,759
I'm on fire!

706
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,457
Come on. All together!

707
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:37,829
I'm on fire!

708
00:40:45,574 --> 00:40:48,168
Very straight.
Very straight.

709
00:40:58,921 --> 00:41:01,446
Come on, come on.
Get all together.

710
00:41:01,523 --> 00:41:03,354
Everything together.
Come on.

711
00:41:03,425 --> 00:41:05,416
Come on. Quiet.

712
00:41:05,494 --> 00:41:06,927
Quiet! Come on.

713
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:09,362
Shh! Quiet.

714
00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:10,921
Well, we're all glad

715
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,128
the kindergarten class
could join us.

716
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:16,770
That's four minutes.

717
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:19,364
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

718
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:22,870
All the other grades...

719
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:24,879
your times were an improvement...

720
00:41:24,947 --> 00:41:26,782
but they're still
not good enough.

721
00:41:26,782 --> 00:41:27,874
But they're still
not good enough.

722
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:30,144
I'm very disappointed.

723
00:41:30,218 --> 00:41:33,984
All right, let's get
back into school.

724
00:41:56,878 --> 00:41:58,038
Mrs. Sullivan!

725
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:01,807
Mrs. Sullivan!

726
00:42:08,123 --> 00:42:11,058
So the doctor says
it's a stomach flu.

727
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:14,186
I'm fine. I can
eat anything I want.

728
00:42:14,262 --> 00:42:15,695
Let's find a restaurant.

729
00:42:15,764 --> 00:42:17,197
Can we talk business?

730
00:42:17,265 --> 00:42:19,699
There are 14 boys
in the classroom.

731
00:42:19,768 --> 00:42:23,204
So far I have three possible suspects,
one likely.

732
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:25,102
Here's a picture.
You listening?

733
00:42:25,173 --> 00:42:26,504
I'm listening.

734
00:42:26,575 --> 00:42:28,543
His name's Zach Sullivan.
What do you think?

735
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,579
He's cute.
Doesn't anybody eat around here?

736
00:42:31,646 --> 00:42:34,513
Listen, he's a dead ringer
for Crisp. Look.

737
00:42:35,784 --> 00:42:39,015
Maybe. Come on, John.
I'm hungry.

738
00:42:39,087 --> 00:42:41,419
A table for two.
Thank you very much.

739
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:42,922
Two hot dogs.

740
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:44,424
Two hot dogs?

741
00:42:44,492 --> 00:42:45,959
Mr. Kimble!
Mr. Kimble!

742
00:42:46,027 --> 00:42:46,959
Dominic.

743
00:42:47,028 --> 00:42:48,620
It's him, Mom.

744
00:42:48,697 --> 00:42:50,130
Joyce.

745
00:42:50,198 --> 00:42:51,222
Hello, Joyce.

746
00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:53,631
Dominic has been a great help.

747
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:55,226
He's a good kid.

748
00:42:55,303 --> 00:42:56,270
Who's that?

749
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:57,270
Who?

750
00:42:57,339 --> 00:42:58,931
Her.

751
00:42:59,007 --> 00:42:59,974
Oh, that?

752
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:01,702
Uh, that is, uh...

753
00:43:01,776 --> 00:43:04,142
I am his sister.

754
00:43:04,212 --> 00:43:05,144
Oh, really?

755
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:06,646
I wouldn't have guessed.

756
00:43:06,715 --> 00:43:08,478
You have to excuse my brother.

757
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,915
He has no manners.

758
00:43:09,985 --> 00:43:12,419
My name is Ursula.
Wonderful to meet you.

759
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:14,455
I'm visiting here
from Austria.

760
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:17,491
I'm Joyce Paulmarie.
I work at John's school.

761
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:18,548
Ah.

762
00:43:18,627 --> 00:43:19,992
And this is Dominic.

763
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:21,426
Nice to meet you.

764
00:43:21,496 --> 00:43:24,431
Would you like
to join us for dinner?

765
00:43:24,499 --> 00:43:25,898
- No.
- Ja.

766
00:43:25,967 --> 00:43:27,093
Ja.

767
00:43:27,168 --> 00:43:29,932
Yes, of course.
That would be great.

768
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:32,906
Hi. There will
be four of us.

769
00:43:32,974 --> 00:43:34,168
Table 27.

770
00:43:34,242 --> 00:43:37,405
Why did you tell her
you were my sister?

771
00:43:37,479 --> 00:43:40,812
Relax, butch.
The love doctor is here.

772
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:43,282
Come to me.
I want to start.

773
00:43:43,351 --> 00:43:46,411
Okay. I want
a rib eye steak

774
00:43:46,488 --> 00:43:47,921
with mashed potatoes

775
00:43:47,989 --> 00:43:49,923
and a large green salad.

776
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:51,424
Oh, no.
Wait a minute.

777
00:43:51,493 --> 00:43:52,960
I want to start

778
00:43:53,028 --> 00:43:55,588
with the spicy
chicken wings.

779
00:43:55,764 --> 00:43:58,255
Are they the tiny ones
without meat?

780
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,267
Actually, it's quite
a large serving.

781
00:44:00,335 --> 00:44:01,632
Ah, good.

782
00:44:01,703 --> 00:44:03,136
Ooh, good arms.

783
00:44:03,204 --> 00:44:07,368
And a large bowl
of the clam chowder.

784
00:44:07,442 --> 00:44:09,672
Uh, and the blueberry pie

785
00:44:09,744 --> 00:44:11,507
with ice cream for dessert.

786
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:12,637
Ja.

787
00:44:14,249 --> 00:44:16,717
I like how they talk.

788
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,280
I've been trying to get to
know the parents...

789
00:44:21,356 --> 00:44:23,722
but some of them
are avoiding me.

790
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:25,225
Some of them
are like that.

791
00:44:25,293 --> 00:44:27,227
It's a strange town that way...

792
00:44:27,295 --> 00:44:28,694
especially with new arrivals.

793
00:44:28,763 --> 00:44:29,695
What do you mean?

794
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:31,891
I think a lot of people

795
00:44:31,967 --> 00:44:33,366
that come to small towns

796
00:44:33,435 --> 00:44:35,198
are trying to get
away from something

797
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:37,067
or they're
hiding something.

798
00:44:37,138 --> 00:44:38,230
Like what?

799
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:42,576
Well, for example,
what brought you here?

800
00:44:42,644 --> 00:44:44,578
Me? Well,
there was an opening

801
00:44:44,646 --> 00:44:46,238
for a kindergarten teacher.

802
00:44:46,314 --> 00:44:49,010
Yeah, but what made you
become a kindergarten teacher?

803
00:44:49,084 --> 00:44:51,484
I mean, it is a bit unusual.

804
00:44:51,553 --> 00:44:53,145
John is a bit unusual.

805
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:54,153
Well...

806
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:55,154
You are.

807
00:44:55,223 --> 00:44:56,588
I was born in Austria.

808
00:44:56,658 --> 00:44:58,091
My father was a teacher.

809
00:44:58,159 --> 00:44:59,524
My mother was a teacher.

810
00:44:59,594 --> 00:45:00,652
So is Ursula.

811
00:45:00,729 --> 00:45:01,889
Ja.

812
00:45:01,963 --> 00:45:03,760
We have a tradition in Austria

813
00:45:03,832 --> 00:45:06,494
where we follow
the footsteps of our parents.

814
00:45:06,568 --> 00:45:08,934
So when I moved
to this country...

815
00:45:09,004 --> 00:45:10,266
I taught geography

816
00:45:10,372 --> 00:45:12,636
and physical education
in Arizona...

817
00:45:12,707 --> 00:45:14,470
and then I coached basketball

818
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:17,534
at an all-girls school
in Rhode Island, but...

819
00:45:18,713 --> 00:45:21,477
none of it made me
really happy.

820
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:23,676
Why weren't you happy?

821
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:26,084
Ja. Why weren't you happy?

822
00:45:27,455 --> 00:45:29,821
Well, I got tired of
teaching teenagers...

823
00:45:29,891 --> 00:45:32,291
because by the time
they came to me...

824
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,761
I felt there wasn't
much I could do with them.

825
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,958
I realized that the real action
is in kindergarten.

826
00:45:39,034 --> 00:45:41,093
How long have you been
teaching kindergarten?

827
00:45:41,169 --> 00:45:42,898
It's my second day.

828
00:45:42,971 --> 00:45:44,336
Oh.

829
00:45:46,474 --> 00:45:49,932
Ooh, excuse me,
but it's good.

830
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:51,501
It is good.

831
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:52,511
Thanks again.

832
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,810
Nice to meet you.

833
00:45:54,883 --> 00:45:55,815
Thank you.

834
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:57,511
Bye.

835
00:45:57,585 --> 00:45:58,984
I had a great time.

836
00:45:59,054 --> 00:46:00,453
Ja, me, too.

837
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:03,616
Well, Kimble,
I think you scored.

838
00:46:06,761 --> 00:46:08,023
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

839
00:46:08,096 --> 00:46:09,461
What are you talking about?

840
00:46:09,531 --> 00:46:10,930
I'm only interested in her

841
00:46:10,999 --> 00:46:12,967
because she works
at the school.

842
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:14,934
She knows the children
and the parents.

843
00:46:15,003 --> 00:46:16,368
If you were any stiffer...

844
00:46:16,438 --> 00:46:17,769
we could take you surfing.

845
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,773
Now, I know you
like that woman.

846
00:46:19,841 --> 00:46:21,035
What is your problem?

847
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:22,508
The only problem I've got

848
00:46:22,577 --> 00:46:24,704
is that I'm doing your job.

849
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:26,713
You should be
cleaning up the paint

850
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:28,715
and reading stories
about bears that go shopping.

851
00:46:28,783 --> 00:46:30,444
I'm stuck with your job.

852
00:46:30,518 --> 00:46:31,883
Yeah. You are.

853
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:33,853
That's right. I am.

854
00:46:33,922 --> 00:46:36,356
Look, you're going
to be out of here

855
00:46:36,424 --> 00:46:37,857
in a few days.

856
00:46:37,926 --> 00:46:40,793
You told me yourself
you had a few good leads.

857
00:46:40,862 --> 00:46:43,057
You'll be back dealing
with junkies and murderers

858
00:46:43,131 --> 00:46:44,189
in no time.

859
00:46:55,443 --> 00:46:57,843
They're pushing me around.

860
00:46:57,912 --> 00:46:59,573
Who?

861
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:00,739
The kids.

862
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:04,574
They're walking all over me.

863
00:47:11,326 --> 00:47:12,315
Listen, Kimble.

864
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:13,758
You got to handle this

865
00:47:13,828 --> 00:47:15,261
like any other police situation.

866
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,764
You walk into it showing fear...

867
00:47:17,832 --> 00:47:19,493
you're dead...

868
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:22,365
and those kids know you're scared.

869
00:47:27,142 --> 00:47:28,507
No fear.

870
00:47:30,145 --> 00:47:31,339
No fear.

871
00:47:34,015 --> 00:47:36,882
Today we're going to play
a new fun game.

872
00:47:36,951 --> 00:47:39,715
It's called "police school."

873
00:47:39,787 --> 00:47:41,687
I'm going to be your sheriff.

874
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:45,089
You're going to be
my deputy trainees.

875
00:47:46,861 --> 00:47:48,192
Come on.

876
00:47:48,263 --> 00:47:49,457
Stop whining.

877
00:47:51,366 --> 00:47:53,129
You kids are soft.

878
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:54,896
You lack discipline.

879
00:47:56,371 --> 00:47:57,531
Well, I've got news for you.

880
00:47:57,605 --> 00:48:00,199
You are mine now.
You belong to me!

881
00:48:02,343 --> 00:48:04,140
You're not going to have
your mommies here

882
00:48:04,212 --> 00:48:05,304
to wipe your tushies.

883
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,642
Oh, no.

884
00:48:06,714 --> 00:48:09,444
It's time to turn
this mush into muscles.

885
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:13,047
No more complaining.

886
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:15,589
No more, "I have to go
to the bathroom."

887
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:18,619
There is no bathroom!

888
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,497
Now, the first thing the
deputy trainees have to learn

889
00:48:25,567 --> 00:48:28,661
is to freeze
whenever you hear this.

890
00:48:31,806 --> 00:48:34,502
Now, the next time you hear
this whistle...

891
00:48:34,576 --> 00:48:36,840
each one of you get
one toy.

892
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:37,843
How many?

893
00:48:37,979 --> 00:48:39,173
One!

894
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:41,238
Good. Then bring it back
to the carpet...

895
00:48:41,316 --> 00:48:42,283
pronto.

896
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,339
Ready?

897
00:48:44,352 --> 00:48:45,944
Wait for it.

898
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,920
Wait for it.

899
00:48:47,989 --> 00:48:49,684
Sit down.

900
00:48:50,725 --> 00:48:52,249
Ready?

901
00:48:53,228 --> 00:48:54,160
Go quickly.

902
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:55,161
Get your toy.

903
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:56,197
Go.

904
00:48:56,264 --> 00:48:57,356
Go for it.

905
00:48:57,432 --> 00:48:59,297
Yes. Very fast.

906
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:00,459
Good. Quickly.

907
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:02,696
Bring the toy
back to the carpet.

908
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,034
Bring it back
to the carpet.

909
00:49:05,106 --> 00:49:06,266
Quick, quick, quick.

910
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:08,206
Back to the carpet.

911
00:49:08,276 --> 00:49:09,504
Quickly.

912
00:49:12,347 --> 00:49:13,541
Emma.

913
00:49:15,683 --> 00:49:16,650
Emma...

914
00:49:16,718 --> 00:49:18,879
take your toy
to the carpet.

915
00:49:18,953 --> 00:49:22,821
I'm not a policeman.
I'm a princess.

916
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:25,427
Take your toy
back to the carpet.

917
00:49:26,795 --> 00:49:28,228
I'm not a policeman!

918
00:49:28,296 --> 00:49:29,354
I'm a princess.

919
00:49:29,431 --> 00:49:31,058
Take it back!

920
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:34,033
All right.

921
00:49:41,976 --> 00:49:43,671
Very good.

922
00:49:43,745 --> 00:49:45,178
You did very well.

923
00:49:45,246 --> 00:49:47,578
Now we're going to
play another game.

924
00:49:47,649 --> 00:49:50,140
When you hear
two whistle blows...

925
00:49:50,218 --> 00:49:53,085
take your toy back
where you got it

926
00:49:53,154 --> 00:49:54,712
and come right back.

927
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:56,416
How many whistle blows?

928
00:49:56,491 --> 00:49:57,583
- Two!
- Two!

929
00:49:57,659 --> 00:49:59,422
Good. Ready?

930
00:50:01,162 --> 00:50:02,220
Go.

931
00:50:02,297 --> 00:50:03,423
Come on.

932
00:50:03,498 --> 00:50:05,728
Come right back
to the carpet.

933
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,233
Yes. It works.

934
00:50:07,302 --> 00:50:08,200
This is great.

935
00:50:08,269 --> 00:50:09,736
Faster, faster.

936
00:50:09,804 --> 00:50:10,828
Come on.

937
00:50:10,905 --> 00:50:12,338
Yes. Come back. Terrific.

938
00:50:12,407 --> 00:50:13,738
This is working. Wait.

939
00:50:15,176 --> 00:50:17,576
I mean, you're
very good deputies.

940
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:22,716
Your sheriff
is proud of you.

941
00:50:30,525 --> 00:50:32,618
1, 2, 3, 4.

942
00:50:32,694 --> 00:50:34,628
1, 2, 3, 4.

943
00:50:34,696 --> 00:50:36,630
1, 2, 3, 4.

944
00:50:36,698 --> 00:50:38,461
1, 2, 3, 4.

945
00:50:43,104 --> 00:50:46,130
Wait! Take me.

946
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:48,801
Down. Up. Down.

947
00:50:48,877 --> 00:50:50,310
Yes, yes, yes!

948
00:50:50,378 --> 00:50:51,436
You've got it.

949
00:50:52,514 --> 00:50:54,539
Yes, Wanda. Good.

950
00:50:56,284 --> 00:50:57,615
Very good.

951
00:50:57,685 --> 00:50:59,744
Big circles. Big circles.

952
00:50:59,821 --> 00:51:00,947
Good.

953
00:51:01,022 --> 00:51:03,320
Now do the same thing.
Way back.

954
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:04,949
And down in big circles.

955
00:51:05,026 --> 00:51:05,993
Big circles.

956
00:51:16,404 --> 00:51:17,496
Yes.

957
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,573
This is a fire drill!

958
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:29,446
This is a fire drill.

959
00:51:29,517 --> 00:51:30,506
Run to the door.

960
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:34,414
Dominic, don't forget Ferret.

961
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:36,252
Yes. It's a fire drill.

962
00:51:36,324 --> 00:51:37,313
Come on.

963
00:51:39,027 --> 00:51:40,995
Oh, this is terrible.

964
00:51:41,062 --> 00:51:43,587
Come on. Come on.

965
00:51:44,999 --> 00:51:47,365
29.

966
00:51:47,435 --> 00:51:48,766
30.

967
00:51:48,836 --> 00:51:50,667
31.

968
00:51:50,738 --> 00:51:52,365
32.

969
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,431
33.

970
00:51:54,509 --> 00:51:55,476
One more.

971
00:51:55,543 --> 00:51:57,875
Come on.
Down and up.

972
00:51:57,946 --> 00:51:58,878
Yes!

973
00:51:58,947 --> 00:51:59,879
Yes!

974
00:51:59,948 --> 00:52:01,142
Zach is the winner.

975
00:52:01,215 --> 00:52:02,773
Come on, you guys.

976
00:52:10,024 --> 00:52:12,015
March, 2, 3, 4.

977
00:52:12,093 --> 00:52:14,061
March, 2, 3, 4.

978
00:52:14,128 --> 00:52:15,152
Swing your arms.

979
00:52:15,229 --> 00:52:16,787
2, 3, 4.

980
00:52:16,864 --> 00:52:19,298
Swing them high.
2, 3, 4.

981
00:52:19,367 --> 00:52:21,494
1, 2, 3, 4.

982
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:23,833
1, 2, 3, 4.

983
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:26,000
Wow.

984
00:52:26,074 --> 00:52:28,201
1, 2, 3, 4!

985
00:52:28,276 --> 00:52:29,709
Reading, writing, arithmetic.

986
00:52:29,777 --> 00:52:32,644
Reading, writing, arithmetic!

987
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:34,909
Too much homework
makes me sick.

988
00:52:34,983 --> 00:52:37,144
Too much homework
makes me sick!

989
00:52:37,218 --> 00:52:39,584
When it's time
to pass the test...

990
00:52:39,654 --> 00:52:42,054
When it's time
to pass the test...

991
00:52:42,123 --> 00:52:44,216
kindergarten is the best.

992
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:46,351
Kindergarten is the best.

993
00:52:46,427 --> 00:52:48,588
Yay!

994
00:52:48,663 --> 00:52:51,655
E-l-E-l-O

995
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:56,397
And on that farm
he had a duck

996
00:52:56,471 --> 00:52:59,440
E-l-E-l-O

997
00:53:03,177 --> 00:53:05,168
All right.
Take your milk.

998
00:53:05,246 --> 00:53:07,737
It makes you big and strong.

999
00:53:11,653 --> 00:53:13,120
It's story time, Mr. Kimble.

1000
00:53:13,187 --> 00:53:14,085
All right.

1001
00:53:14,155 --> 00:53:15,554
We all like this one...

1002
00:53:15,623 --> 00:53:18,057
and if you read us a story now...

1003
00:53:18,126 --> 00:53:20,060
everybody will go to sleep.

1004
00:53:20,128 --> 00:53:21,117
All right.

1005
00:53:32,106 --> 00:53:34,540
I used to read this to my son.

1006
00:53:34,609 --> 00:53:35,701
What's his name?

1007
00:53:35,777 --> 00:53:36,641
Who?

1008
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:38,576
Your son.

1009
00:53:38,646 --> 00:53:41,308
Oh, Alex is his name.

1010
00:53:41,382 --> 00:53:42,815
Where is he?

1011
00:53:42,884 --> 00:53:44,784
He lives with his mother.

1012
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,988
You see, his mother and I...

1013
00:53:55,063 --> 00:53:55,961
we are...

1014
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,622
Divorced. I know.

1015
00:53:57,699 --> 00:53:59,257
What's a divorce?

1016
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:02,166
It's when your daddy
lives someplace else

1017
00:54:02,236 --> 00:54:04,136
and comes over
to take you places...

1018
00:54:04,205 --> 00:54:06,833
and your mommy says
he's a deadbeat.

1019
00:54:06,908 --> 00:54:08,500
No. It's when the daddy

1020
00:54:08,576 --> 00:54:11,136
doesn't want to see
his little boy anymore.

1021
00:54:11,212 --> 00:54:12,679
That's not what it is.

1022
00:54:12,747 --> 00:54:15,409
Why don't you want to see
your little boy?

1023
00:54:15,483 --> 00:54:16,507
Was he bad?

1024
00:54:16,584 --> 00:54:18,677
No, he was not bad.

1025
00:54:20,421 --> 00:54:23,652
It wasn't his fault at all.

1026
00:54:23,725 --> 00:54:24,817
You see...

1027
00:54:24,892 --> 00:54:28,157
his mommy and I,
we just nev...

1028
00:54:36,704 --> 00:54:38,604
Just sit down, okay?

1029
00:54:39,907 --> 00:54:41,465
Let me just start reading.

1030
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:43,976
Why don't you all lie down?

1031
00:54:44,045 --> 00:54:45,034
Okay.

1032
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,804
Good. And rest.
