1
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,251
My sister...

2
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:50,932
was just-

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,934
Oh, God.
What happened?

4
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:55,971
<i>What happened to her?</i>

5
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:00,614
... regional safe zones.
This is not a test.

6
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:03,516
- Justine?
<i>- Repeat. This is not a test.</i>

7
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,916
Justine!

8
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:24,866
Justine, where are you?

9
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,874
Justine, it's me.
It's Mommy.

10
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:28,807
Hello?

11
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:31,438
Hello? Is anyone there?

12
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,812
Hello? Please.

13
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:36,147
I'm your neighbor from 431. Please.

14
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:38,618
Please, I need some help.
I can't find my daughter.

15
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,089
Hello! Hello!

16
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:47,823
Please open the door!

17
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,888
Please.

18
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:55,760
Please.

19
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:59,697
Please.

20
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:02,710
Please help me.

21
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:06,145
Open the door!
Help me, please. Help me.

22
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,324
Oh, my God.

23
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:27,759
It's a plague.

24
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:57,760
Michelle?

25
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:10,912
Oh, my- Oh, my God.

26
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:52,343
E-Excuse me. Something terrible's
happened, and I can't find my daughter.

27
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:55,076
I-I've lost my little girl.

28
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,729
Please. Can you tell
me what's going on here?

29
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,018
Why would I do that?

30
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,147
I- I'm sorry?

31
00:09:01,223 --> 00:09:04,522
- Go on like this.
- I don't understand.

32
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:08,252
It hurts.

33
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,434
It- It hurts so bad.

34
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:15,026
What hurts?
What's wrong with you?

35
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:21,167
You wouldn't understand.
I mean, how- how could you really?

36
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:24,178
- You're right. I-I'm sorry. I don't.
- Lisa. Lisa, answer me.

37
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:27,238
- Tell me where you are.
- Oh, God. I'm sorry. I- I thought-

38
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,216
It's not enough to.

39
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:33,050
Can I just have a moment of your time,
please? I've lost my little girl.

40
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:35,716
I wanna die.
I just wanna die.

41
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,518
<i>Lisa, it's time to
get you help.</i>

42
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,419
But I don't know how.

43
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,297
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

44
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:41,361
<i>I can help you.
Just tell me where you are.</i>

45
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,796
I'm sorry. I have to find my little girl.
I'm sorry.

46
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,883
<i>All you have to do
is tell me where you are.</i>

47
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:46,892
<i>I've looked everywhere.</i>

48
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:47,561
Good-bye, David.

49
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:49,301
<i>No. Don't hang up.
Stay on the line.</i>

50
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:51,862
- Good-bye.
<i>- Lisa, where are you?</i>

51
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:09,381
What do you want, Michelle?

52
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:13,861
Aunt Carmen. Oh, God.
I thought you and Uncle Pete were-

53
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:20,095
- Carmen?
- You shouldn't be out at this hour.

54
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:24,698
Something terrible is happening.

55
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:26,832
<i>- Everywhere you look-</i>
- I know.

56
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,104
Justine's gone.

57
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,842
<i>And- Well, I thought, um-</i>

58
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,783
I thought maybe I left her with you.

59
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:40,344
No. She's- She's-
She's not-

60
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:43,016
I don't- No.
She's not here.

61
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:47,824
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

62
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:49,830
- Yes.
<i>- Are you sure?</i>

63
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:53,265
- I think so. You?
- I don't know.

64
00:10:53,335 --> 00:10:55,394
I- I just don't know anymore.

65
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:59,569
I'm scared, Carmen.
I'm scared, and, um-

66
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:02,700
People are dying
from some horrible disease...

67
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:06,509
and others are killing themselves,
and... I'm scared.

68
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,573
I'm- I'm scared.

69
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,880
TV's not workin'.

70
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:14,320
<i>Radio either.</i>

71
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:16,323
Um...

72
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:18,325
where's Uncle Pete?

73
00:11:21,563 --> 00:11:23,531
<i>- Is he-</i>
- Pete- Pete-

74
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,533
Pete's in the back bedroom.

75
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:28,626
Can I talk to him?

76
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:31,298
Well, I don't know if that's
a really good idea right now.

77
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:33,637
- Why not?
<i>- He's-</i>

78
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,408
I don't know.

79
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:41,174
Let's go and talk to him, okay?

80
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,241
Can we do that?

81
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:45,809
- Please.
- Well, all right.

82
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:48,288
Uh, I- I'm just-

83
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:52,919
I'm just not sure he wants to
talk to anyone right now.

84
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:58,325
He really hasn't
been himself lately.

85
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:20,284
He has Mr. - Mr. Peppers
in there with him. He-

86
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,565
Um- Um- Pete?

87
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:35,837
Peter pie.

88
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,404
Uncle Pete?

89
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:47,979
Uncle Pete, it's me.
It's Michelle.

90
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:52,481
<i>It's your niece, Michelle.</i>

91
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,951
<i>Is there a key?</i>

92
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:02,989
The door doesn't lock.
Never has.

93
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,795
Then why haven't you gone inside?

94
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:09,594
I don't know.

95
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:13,402
- No, don't. Don't go in there.
- Why?

96
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:16,342
That's-

97
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:19,437
That's not my husband.

98
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:22,074
<i>Not anymore.</i>

99
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,421
Pete?

100
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:56,307
Oh, my God, Michelle.

101
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:58,376
What have you done?

102
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,580
Justine?

103
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,657
Justine?

104
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,295
Justine, honey.
Is that you?

105
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:28,510
It's me.
It's Mommy.

106
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,910
What's wrong, baby?

107
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:41,218
Are you sick?

108
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:43,287
Is that it?

109
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,601
It's okay.

110
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:50,001
Everything's okay.
I promise.

111
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:53,767
Can I see your face?

112
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:57,437
Can you do that for me?
Can you show Mommy your face?

113
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:02,374
- It's been out here all night.
- What?

114
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:04,442
Why didn't you tell me?

115
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,851
It's been watching me
since the sun went down.

116
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,031
Stop saying "it."

117
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,291
I- I- I thought it was
Justine, too, at first.

118
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,794
But I tried talking to it.

119
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:16,524
It never says a word,
never shows its face.

120
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:22,329
<i>I think you need to get away from it,</i>
<i>Michelle. Now.</i>

121
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:25,965
What are-What are you saying?
Is she-

122
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,238
I think- I think, if you touch it...

123
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:31,245
you-you'll die.

124
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:33,577
<i>- No.</i>
- You'll get the infection, and you'll die.

125
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:36,549
I don't believe you.
You don't know what you're saying.

126
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:38,085
Get away from it.

127
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:42,785
Come on, baby.
Let's go home.

128
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,326
Oh, wait. Please wait.

129
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,460
Oh, God have mercy on us all.

130
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:58,105
God have mercy on us all.

131
00:16:09,484 --> 00:16:11,782
<i>No, no, no.</i>

132
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:15,256
<i>No, wait, please.</i>

133
00:16:15,323 --> 00:16:16,312
Justine.

134
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:28,665
Justine.

135
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,932
Justine.

136
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:33,333
Justine, come back.

137
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,810
Please!

138
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:41,076
Come back, please, Justine!

139
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:43,140
Justine!

140
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:03,268
<i>July 6. I talked to the school psych.</i>

141
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:05,738
<i>Justine is acting out at school.</i>

142
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:09,436
<i>This tension between me and</i>
<i>Stephen is affecting our child now.</i>

143
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:11,775
<i>- This has got to stop.</i>
<i>- [Chimes]</i>

144
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:16,284
<i>July 15.</i>
<i>Stephen is more and more remote.</i>

145
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:19,445
<i>He is no longer hostile,</i>
<i>but he won't talk about us...</i>

146
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:21,455
<i>and he won't try family counseling.</i>

147
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,516
<i>July 24.</i>

148
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:28,723
<i>I think Stephen is having an affair.</i>

149
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:32,425
<i>August 2...</i>

150
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:34,435
<i>Stephen wants a divorce.</i>

151
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:36,698
<i>Says I share the blame.</i>

152
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:39,262
<i>How am I to blame</i>
<i>for his infidelities?</i>

153
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:44,741
<i>August 3.</i>
<i>He moved out today.</i>

154
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,145
<i>Claims he's going to stay</i>
<i>at the cabin.</i>

155
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:50,707
<i>Liar.</i>
<i>He's living with her.</i>

156
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:52,878
<i>I know it.</i>

157
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:54,945
<i>September 14.</i>

158
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:58,391
<i>Forty-three days single.</i>

159
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,588
<i>Teri signed me up</i>
<i>with a dating service.</i>

160
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,722
<i>All losers.</i>

161
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:06,096
<i>I just want you back, Stephen.</i>

162
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:11,895
<i>September 20.</i>
<i>I'm spending all my time in chat rooms.</i>

163
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:15,067
<i>I can't eat.</i>
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

164
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:19,170
<i>It's a sick world out there,</i>
<i>especially at night.</i>

165
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:23,741
<i>September 23.</i>
<i>I found a strange Web site.</i>

166
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:27,618
<i>People actually seem to be killing</i>
<i>themselves in front of their webcams.</i>

167
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,258
<i>Once I got over the horror of it...</i>

168
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:34,727
<i>I realized there was something</i>
<i>almost welcoming in their despair.</i>

169
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:38,459
<i>A kind of shared pain nobody</i>
<i>else could possibly understand.</i>

170
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:49,974
<i>September 24. I must get these</i>
<i>dark thoughts out of my head.</i>

171
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,640
<i>I must think of Justine.</i>
<i>My sweet little angel.</i>

172
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,146
<i>October 5.</i>
<i>The day I thought would never come.</i>

173
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,917
<i>Stephen won custody</i>
<i>of our daughter...</i>

174
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,791
<i>and I was ruled an unfit mother</i>
<i>for neglecting</i> my <i>child.</i>

175
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:09,127
<i>How could this happen?</i>

176
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:12,800
<i>How could you do this to me?
I hate you.</i>

177
00:19:14,202 --> 00:19:16,898
<i>October 7.</i>
<i>I can't bear the thought...</i>

178
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:20,669
<i>of leaving Justine with you</i>
<i>and that woman.</i>

179
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,575
<i>I would rather see my baby dead.</i>

180
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:29,206
<i>October 8.</i>
<i>Decision made.</i>

181
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:32,684
<i>FirstJustine...</i>

182
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,688
<i>then me.</i>

183
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,747
<i>Good-bye, my love.</i>

184
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:40,386
<i>I'll be with you soon.</i>

185
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:36,894
Justine?

186
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:38,996
Justine! Justine!

187
00:22:50,418 --> 00:22:51,316
Justine?

188
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:56,313
Justine?

189
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:09,068
Justine! Justine, thank God!

190
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:12,766
You all right, sweetheart?
You okay?

191
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,844
Huh? You okay?

192
00:23:19,914 --> 00:23:21,882
Christ, I've been worried
sick about you.

193
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,646
I called all the neighbors. I called 911.
I called your mom.

194
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:26,710
I called Aunt Carmen and Uncle Pete.

195
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:29,188
Oh!

196
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,626
Sweetie...

197
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:34,685
where's Mommy?

198
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,392
Huh? Do you know where she is?

199
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:43,870
Did- Did she- Did she get sick?

200
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:45,872
Huh?

201
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:55,441
Oh, come here. It's okay, squirt.
Daddy's here. There's my big girl.

202
00:23:57,652 --> 00:24:00,621
We're together.

203
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:04,590
Nothing's gonna change that.
You understand? Nothing.

204
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:11,162
Come on.
That's my daughter.

205
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:13,223
That's my girl.

206
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,273
All right. Sit back.

207
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:26,579
Stephen. Stephen!

208
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:28,582
Justine.

209
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:31,575
Justine.

210
00:24:43,364 --> 00:24:46,026
<i>Hey, squirt.</i>

211
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,534
You want to buckle up for me?

212
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:52,198
Here.
I'll give you a hand.

213
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:54,241
That-a-girl.

214
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,301
That-a-girl.

215
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,815
<i>Oh, no.</i>

216
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:22,396
Don't look, okay?
Just don't look.

217
00:25:27,942 --> 00:25:30,342
<i>Hold on. I'm gonna</i>
<i>try and get past him.</i>

218
00:26:28,302 --> 00:26:30,236
Is that Justine?

219
00:26:30,304 --> 00:26:32,295
You had us all
praying for a miracle.

220
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:34,364
And praise the Lord,
it finally paid off.

221
00:26:36,644 --> 00:26:39,306
So what's going on?
You turning people away now?

222
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,814
Residents and family only.
That's the rule.

223
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:44,374
Otherwise it's gonna be chaos,
just like down in the city.

224
00:26:44,452 --> 00:26:46,579
There's gotta be something we can do.

225
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:51,648
I'm sorry. I know how it sounds,
but that's the way it's gotta be.

226
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:53,660
Now, uh-

227
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:57,323
I'm gonna have to ask you both
to step out of the car.

228
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:02,592
- What?
- Uh, it- it's just a precaution.

229
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,606
Uh, uh, anybody who leaves, don't matter
for how long, we just gotta be sure.

230
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:09,507
- What's this about, Hutch?
<i>- It's just a precaution.</i>

231
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:11,568
Come on.

232
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:16,845
You gotta be kidding me.

233
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:21,819
Come on.

234
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:31,825
All right. If y'all would just step out
the front of the truck here.

235
00:27:33,534 --> 00:27:34,936
Take your jackets off.

236
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:37,868
All we need to see is
your arms and your legs.

237
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:42,103
And, Steve, if you'd just go over there.

238
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:46,306
All right, sweetheart.
It's only Hutch, okay?

239
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:50,179
It's all right.

240
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:53,843
Come on.
Let me see your arm.

241
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:55,650
Come on.

242
00:27:55,723 --> 00:27:59,386
<i>All right. Now show me</i>
<i>the other arm.</i>

243
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,826
- Now your arm.
<i>- Now check the leg.</i>

244
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,830
<i>And the other one.</i>

245
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:07,664
There. What's that?

246
00:28:07,735 --> 00:28:09,498
<i>- I see it. On her shoulder.</i>
- What is that?

247
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,629
- It's dirt. It's just dirt.
<i>- What is it, Steve?</i>

248
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:14,300
- Steve, step back.
- Christ, Hutch.

249
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:16,536
- Just step aside!
- Hutch, it's just dirt!

250
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,806
- Goddamn it, Steve! Step aside!
- See? You see?

251
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,370
- It's just dirt!
- Okay.

252
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,508
- It's just dirt, goddamn it!
- Just calm down, Steve. All right.

253
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:26,018
- Okay.
- You're good to go.

254
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,522
<i>It's good, Steve.</i>
<i>It's good.</i>

255
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:41,399
<i>Do you think you'd</i>
<i>like to talk about Mommy?</i>

256
00:28:42,403 --> 00:28:44,394
I don't know.

257
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:49,908
Can you tell me what happened?

258
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,671
Take your time.

259
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:01,086
She was in my room...

260
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:03,146
crying.

261
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:07,759
- Did she say why?
- Sh-Sh-

262
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,763
She said she wanted to die.

263
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,996
She had that stuff all over her.

264
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:16,059
What stuff?

265
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:22,707
That black stuff
that looks like mold.

266
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,041
She wanted me to come-

267
00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:29,173
She wanted me to come closer...

268
00:29:30,218 --> 00:29:32,686
but I was too scared to.

269
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:39,619
Come here, baby.

270
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,958
Mommy just wants to hold you.

271
00:29:48,102 --> 00:29:50,229
I love you so much.

272
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:58,133
It's just 'cause I love you so much.

273
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,109
It's okay.

274
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:06,153
It's okay, baby.

275
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:09,212
<i>Come on.</i>

276
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:13,283
<i>It's okay, baby.</i>
<i>It's okay.</i>

277
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,363
Everything's gonna be okay.

278
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:30,972
# Hush, little baby #

279
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:33,605
# Don't say a word #

280
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:36,275
# Mama's gonna buy you #

281
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,545
#A mockingbird #

282
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:44,021
# If that mockingbird
don't sing #

283
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:49,051
# Mama's gonna buy you
a diamond ring #

284
00:30:50,831 --> 00:30:54,323
# If that diamond ring
don't shine ##

285
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:01,631
All the pain will be gone soon.

286
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:03,904
Very soon.

287
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:08,139
And then we can fly away from here.

288
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:11,981
Fly away from-

289
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:33,339
Mom?

290
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,747
<i>What did you do after that?</i>

291
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,181
Did you run away?

292
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:47,687
I went to Aunt Carmen's
and Uncle Pete's.

293
00:31:47,755 --> 00:31:50,553
I couldn't remember
how to get there.

294
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,761
But then I saw the big church...

295
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,093
and I remembered where it was.

296
00:31:57,164 --> 00:31:59,155
Were they home?

297
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:02,532
I think Uncle Pete was.

298
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:05,936
But he stayed in his bedroom
and wouldn't come out.

299
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:09,306
So I went out back and sat on a swing
and waited for him.

300
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:15,472
For how long?

301
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:23,913
- Till Mommy came.
- But you-

302
00:32:23,991 --> 00:32:25,800
<i>You said Mommy came
to Aunt Carmen's.</i>

303
00:32:25,801 --> 00:32:26,926
<i>Is that what you said?</i>

304
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:30,263
I think so.

305
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:33,129
What do you mean you think so?

306
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,259
Sorry. I didn't mean
to raise my voice.

307
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,697
Was she, um-

308
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:54,083
Come on, squirt.

309
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:57,921
Let's get you cleaned up and into bed.

310
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,241
Good night, squirt.

311
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:05,102
Who is it?

312
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:07,550
<i>Who do you think,  Stephen?</i>

313
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:21,567
Had to remind those gun-humping
mongoloids I was still your girlfriend.

314
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:25,772
Three days I'm stuck in hell central,
and you're where?

315
00:34:25,846 --> 00:34:29,282
- I was looking for my daughter.
- Oh, I get that.

316
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,945
- But what about me?
- Could you just take it down a notch?

317
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,511
I thought I was gonna die, Stephen.

318
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:37,580
I've never been so scared
in all my life.

319
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,126
I had to steal some poor
dead fucker's car...

320
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:42,958
with his fucking ashes still in it,
thank you very much.

321
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,522
<i>Drive myself up here,</i>
<i>alone, hoping and praying...</i>

322
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,194
that one of those vigilante alcoholics
you call neighbors...

323
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,967
will have the simple human
decency to let me through.

324
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:56,075
God, I need a drink!

325
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:59,579
Wine, Drano.
Anything.

326
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:03,348
I think I have some cooking sherry.

327
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:07,280
Well, you know how to party.

328
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:22,566
<i>Glass? Dixie cup?</i>

329
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:25,605
Forget it.
I'll rough it.

330
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,038
I know you're out there.

331
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:09,806
You can't fool me.

332
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:42,047
I don't know who you are,
but you are not my wife.

333
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,107
You hear me?

334
00:36:44,184 --> 00:36:46,152
You are not my wife!

335
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,246
<i>But you-you can't get me.</i>

336
00:36:49,323 --> 00:36:54,192
You can't get me. Huh?

337
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:56,252
You can't get me!

338
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:02,830
Oh.

339
00:37:02,903 --> 00:37:08,205
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, God. Oh, God.

340
00:37:08,275 --> 00:37:12,803
My pills. My pills.
Carmen. Carmen. My pills.

341
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,576
Car-
Carmen?

342
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:21,550
My pills. Carmen.

343
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:31,194
Carmen. Carmen.
Who-Who-

344
00:37:31,265 --> 00:37:33,199
Who are you?

345
00:38:34,328 --> 00:38:36,421
Do you believe that shit
they're saying about the red tape-

346
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:38,465
<i>that it keeps you safe somehow?</i>

347
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:40,500
I'm not sure
what to believe anymore.

348
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:44,833
<i>Well, I am not sealing myself</i>
<i>up in my own tomb.</i>

349
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,671
That is just too fucked-up
for words.

350
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:51,506
Speaking of words, do me a favor.

351
00:38:51,578 --> 00:38:53,136
<i>I have a six-year-old upstairs...</i>

352
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:56,046
who's been through something
no child should ever have to face.

353
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:59,483
<i>Could you please just drop</i>
<i>a few less F-bombs?</i>

354
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:01,851
God, I hardly even notice anymore.

355
00:39:04,024 --> 00:39:05,150
Sorry.

356
00:39:05,225 --> 00:39:08,058
<i>By the way...</i>

357
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:10,153
- I know what you're thinking.
<i>- Really?</i>

358
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,073
What am I thinking?

359
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:14,223
<i>You're thinking how much</i>
<i>further that food would go...</i>

360
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:17,896
with two mouths instead of three.

361
00:39:17,971 --> 00:39:21,372
Funny, I never pegged you
for a psychic.

362
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,410
You know, I could
make myself useful.

363
00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:26,241
And how are you gonna do that?

364
00:39:26,313 --> 00:39:29,646
I know how to relax you,
better than anybody.

365
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:33,311
Oh, please. No.
Don't do this. Not now.

366
00:39:33,387 --> 00:39:35,412
Don't do what?

367
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:37,423
- Don't!
- What?

368
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:40,358
Isn't this how celebretards
get out of taxicabs?

369
00:39:40,427 --> 00:39:42,918
- I mean it, Marta.
- No, you don't.

370
00:39:42,996 --> 00:39:44,759
You never do.

371
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,697
Remember the first time we did it?

372
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:53,329
Standing-

373
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:56,103
on your boss's back porch
while dear, sweet Michelle...

374
00:39:56,176 --> 00:40:01,170
was inside boring everyone to tears
about global warming.

375
00:40:01,248 --> 00:40:03,182
Wow, the ice is melting, all right.

376
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,946
It's trickling right down my thigh.

377
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:17,524
Okay, did you turn that on?

378
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:19,930
Are you kidding? No way.

379
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,668
<i>Don't you know you're
not even supposed to</i>

380
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,969
<i>have those things
around anymore?</i>

381
00:40:23,036 --> 00:40:25,129
It wasn't even plugged in.

382
00:40:25,205 --> 00:40:28,834
I guess you forgot to pull
the battery, now, didn't you?

383
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:30,900
Well, fine.
Be my guest.

384
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:32,912
I'm not touching it.

385
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,074
I had two of my friends kill themselves
after touching their computers.

386
00:40:36,149 --> 00:40:38,640
- You had friends?
- Okay, "F" you, sweetheart.

387
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:41,153
<i>Jesus! Do something.</i>

388
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:44,019
Calm down. All right?
It's a computer.

389
00:40:44,091 --> 00:40:46,992
You can't get infected by a computer.
Those are just rumors.

390
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,994
Mass hysteria.

391
00:40:49,062 --> 00:40:51,394
Well, then you turn it off.

392
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,266
Fine. I will.

393
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:06,812
- No, don't!
- What?

394
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,745
Just don't touch it.

395
00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:14,449
- What-What are you doing?
- Killing it.

396
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:17,354
Wait!

397
00:41:22,529 --> 00:41:24,497
<i>Oh, God.</i>

398
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,262
It's Michelle.

399
00:41:28,335 --> 00:41:29,996
<i>These are all from Friday.</i>

400
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:37,767
<i>There's even more from Saturday.</i>

401
00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:40,938
Jesus.

402
00:42:03,737 --> 00:42:05,967
This session's over.

403
00:42:07,574 --> 00:42:09,838
Squirt, I need to
ask you a question.

404
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,175
It's very important that you answer me
as honestly and as clearly as you can.

405
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:17,881
Is Mommy alive?

406
00:42:17,951 --> 00:42:19,316
Was she dead?

407
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:22,755
You have to tell me, Justine.

408
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:26,589
The last time you saw her,
she was alive, right?

409
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,686
When she came to Aunt Carmen's,
she was alive.

410
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:33,324
No. She was dead.

411
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,041
<i>Daddy!</i>

412
00:46:28,835 --> 00:46:30,928
<i>Justine!</i>

413
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:36,999
<i>Marta, get up!</i>

414
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:38,840
- We gotta get out-
- What, Stephen?

415
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:40,937
- Come on, Marta! Marta, get out now.
<i>- Stephen!</i>

416
00:46:41,014 --> 00:46:43,005
Stephen!

417
00:46:51,658 --> 00:46:53,649
Come on! Marta!

418
00:46:55,061 --> 00:46:58,053
Marta! Marta!

419
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,232
All right, wait here.

420
00:47:03,503 --> 00:47:05,437
Marta!

421
00:47:05,505 --> 00:47:10,374
I didn't mean to hurt you. It wasn't me.
It was- Stephen seduced me.

422
00:47:10,443 --> 00:47:13,708
- Marta.
- Stephen, help me.

423
00:47:53,386 --> 00:47:55,854
Move, goddamn it!

424
00:48:17,744 --> 00:48:20,406
<i>Does Mommy want to hurt us?</i>

425
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:25,407
I think she, um-

426
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,054
I think she misses you very much.

427
00:48:29,122 --> 00:48:31,989
I miss her too.

428
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:34,049
Even when I'm afraid.

429
00:48:34,127 --> 00:48:36,220
I know you do, squirt.

430
00:48:36,296 --> 00:48:38,287
I know you do.

431
00:48:46,106 --> 00:48:48,574
<i>Can we go around it?</i>

432
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:50,939
Jesus. Open the door!

433
00:48:51,778 --> 00:48:53,541
- Open it!
- Okay!

434
00:48:53,613 --> 00:48:55,547
Scoot over, Tinker Bell.

435
00:48:56,174 --> 00:48:58,880
I left you a gap on the right.
You can just squeeze through.

436
00:48:58,952 --> 00:49:01,921
I'm not going anywhere
till you tell me what you want.

437
00:49:01,988 --> 00:49:03,997
<i>We can wait for that
gas tank to explode,</i>

438
00:49:03,998 --> 00:49:05,719
<i>or you can get the
hell out of here!</i>

439
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:09,284
- Me, I'd choose the latter.
- Get that gun out of my daughter's face!

440
00:49:09,362 --> 00:49:11,660
- Just go.
- Okay.

441
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:13,665
Okay, honey, it's okay.

442
00:49:42,762 --> 00:49:45,925
Uh, I- I thought-
I-I-I-I mean-

443
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:49,491
I-I-I didn't think
anybody was, uh-

444
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,800
<i>there was anybody, uh-</i>

445
00:49:52,872 --> 00:49:55,067
Don't go.

446
00:49:59,846 --> 00:50:02,940
I'm sorry.
Uh, I-I-I should be going.

447
00:50:03,016 --> 00:50:05,484
I never knew before...

448
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:08,180
what they feel.

449
00:50:08,254 --> 00:50:11,189
- So alone.
- They?

450
00:50:12,258 --> 00:50:15,193
L-Look, ma'am,
I don't know what I can-

451
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:17,195
Oh, God.

452
00:50:17,263 --> 00:50:20,232
- U-U-Uh, ma'am-
- Touch me.

453
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,495
No. Uh-

454
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:25,504
No, m-ma'am.
I-I-I'm a- I'm a-

455
00:50:25,572 --> 00:50:28,632
You don't want to feel me?
Is that it?

456
00:50:29,709 --> 00:50:31,643
Yes- I mean, no.

457
00:50:31,711 --> 00:50:34,202
I-I-It's not that I don't.
I do. I-It's just-

458
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,714
You think it's catching?

459
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,910
It's not.

460
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:40,976
You don't get it from us.

461
00:50:41,054 --> 00:50:42,988
You get it from them.

462
00:50:43,056 --> 00:50:46,253
Maybe. I- I don't know.
I don't-A-A-All I know-

463
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:48,556
You know nothing.

464
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:51,597
You don't know what she took from me.
You don't know.

465
00:50:53,566 --> 00:50:56,558
Oh- Oh, I'm so cold.

466
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,570
So cold.

467
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,163
Hold me.

468
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:04,677
Please just hold me.

469
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:07,338
I'm so cold.
Yeah.

470
00:51:08,882 --> 00:51:12,443
You just-just hold me.

471
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:14,510
Please.

472
00:51:15,755 --> 00:51:18,690
Oh, I'm so cold.

473
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:21,522
Please.

474
00:51:21,594 --> 00:51:23,585
Please just hold me.

475
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:31,820
<i>So, we're gonna go</i>
<i>on a little shopping trip.</i>

476
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:35,334
Then I'm out of your hair
for good. How's that?

477
00:52:35,401 --> 00:52:37,835
Everything of value
was looted days ago.

478
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,372
- Not what I'm looking for.
- Which is what, exactly?

479
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,773
Let's just say that I have a plan...

480
00:52:43,843 --> 00:52:45,777
that can save the world...

481
00:52:45,845 --> 00:52:47,972
or end it a whole lot sooner.

482
00:52:48,047 --> 00:52:50,538
- Just tell me what you need me for.
- Wheels, man.

483
00:52:50,617 --> 00:52:53,999
You're planning on saving
the world but can't find a car?

484
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,748
I don't drive. I never have.

485
00:52:55,822 --> 00:52:58,222
It's my bit for the environment.

486
00:53:48,107 --> 00:53:50,166
All right, then, knock yourself out.

487
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:53,743
No, dude, I'm not
going in there. You are.

488
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,611
I'll be sitting right here with
little, uh-What's your name?

489
00:53:58,017 --> 00:54:01,248
- Chatty Cathy.
- No. That is not acceptable.

490
00:54:02,288 --> 00:54:05,086
Get out.

491
00:54:06,893 --> 00:54:10,351
Okay, tell me... exactly what it is
I'm looking for.

492
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:14,264
It's your basic multi-use
infrared microprocessor.

493
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,633
A few aisles down on the left,
as I recall.

494
00:54:17,704 --> 00:54:21,572
Very important-you want IR-245-F.

495
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:25,977
IR-245-F. Okay.


496
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:27,945
- Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie-
- Giddyap.

497
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,948
Okay, honey.

498
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,950
It's gonna be okay.

499
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,009
You be good.

500
00:54:35,688 --> 00:54:38,987
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>
<i>IR-245-F!</i>

501
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:41,049
Nothing else will do!

502
00:54:45,164 --> 00:54:47,257
Daddy!

503
00:54:49,402 --> 00:54:52,235
<i>Daddy.</i>

504
00:54:57,744 --> 00:55:00,212
You gotta be kidding me.

505
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,911
<i>Coming when?</i>

506
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:12,345
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
IR-245-F.

507
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:15,644
<i>IR-245-F.</i>

508
00:56:18,224 --> 00:56:20,419
IR-245-F.

509
00:56:21,894 --> 00:56:27,264
IR-245-F. IR-245-F.
IR-245-F. IR-245-F.

510
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:28,857
Where are you?

511
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:37,506
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

512
00:56:37,577 --> 00:56:41,035
What? Come on. What-

513
00:56:41,113 --> 00:56:43,377
"C."

514
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,112
"D." "E."

515
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:49,211
Goddamn it! Where?

516
00:56:49,288 --> 00:56:53,622
All right, here-There! Right there!

517
00:56:56,095 --> 00:56:58,689
Come on!

518
00:57:15,548 --> 00:57:18,142
<i>No!</i>

519
00:57:21,787 --> 00:57:24,119
<i>Get away from me!</i>

520
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,832
Get over, sweetheart.

521
00:57:41,007 --> 00:57:41,939
<i>Did you get it?</i>

522
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:53,051
- Yeah.
- Come here.

523
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,110
Right on.

524
00:57:57,523 --> 00:57:59,457
I saw my ex-wife last night.

525
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:02,551
<i>- What a joy.</i>
- My <i>dead</i> ex-wife.

526
00:58:02,628 --> 00:58:04,960
<i>So you want to know...</i>

527
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:08,194
where she's been, why she's back...

528
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:10,895
and if it's really even her.

529
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:20,843
All right. Imagine you're out there
floating in some black, empty void.

530
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:26,845
<i>Suddenly there's a way back</i>
<i>to this plane of existence...</i>

531
00:58:26,919 --> 00:58:29,285
<i>a way back to life.</i>

532
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:31,846
<i>You'd grab onto it, wouldn't you?</i>

533
00:58:31,924 --> 00:58:34,392
<i>Even if that life wasn't your own?</i>

534
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,452
<i>The problem is, in this little</i>
<i>passion play you're still not alive.</i>

535
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:39,521
<i>And that's gotta hurt.</i>

536
00:58:40,733 --> 00:58:43,759
That's gotta really suck...

537
00:58:43,836 --> 00:58:46,930
to know that you made it
all the way back...

538
00:58:47,006 --> 00:58:50,237
<i>only to find out,</i>
<i>beyond a shadow of a doubt...</i>

539
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:53,608
that you're still fuckin' dead.

540
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:33,437
Here. Take it. Red's the one frequency
they can't penetrate.

541
01:00:33,512 --> 01:00:35,446
Yeah, I kinda got that impression.

542
01:00:35,514 --> 01:00:37,846
So what am I supposed
to do with this?

543
01:00:37,917 --> 01:00:40,249
When the time comes,
you'll think of something.

544
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:18,154
- Dad.
- Stay in the car.

545
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:21,316
Stay in the car.

546
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,331
Be right back.

547
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:58,495
<i>Excuse me?</i>

548
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:07,002
I'd like to buy some gas.

549
01:02:41,874 --> 01:02:44,240
Excuse me?

550
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:46,301
Sir?

551
01:02:48,113 --> 01:02:50,104
I'm on pump four.

552
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:00,656
I'm just g-

553
01:03:00,726 --> 01:03:02,660
I'm just stepping inside.

554
01:03:18,844 --> 01:03:21,005
I'm just gonna-

555
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:24,973
I'm just gonna reach past you...

556
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:27,041
<i>over your shoulder.</i>

557
01:03:51,277 --> 01:03:53,609
That's it. That's all.

558
01:04:07,693 --> 01:04:09,627
I'll, uh-

559
01:04:09,695 --> 01:04:13,153
I'll leave the cash on top of the pump,
if that's all right with you.

560
01:04:19,204 --> 01:04:21,195
Pop the gas cap.

561
01:04:22,374 --> 01:04:24,365
You know where it is, right?

562
01:04:26,545 --> 01:04:28,479
Never mind.
I got it.

563
01:04:28,547 --> 01:04:30,538
There.

564
01:04:35,054 --> 01:04:38,046
I-I-I had no intention
of stealing your gas.

565
01:04:39,892 --> 01:04:41,985
It's full service only.

566
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:45,820
Oh. Right.

567
01:04:45,898 --> 01:04:47,832
Uh-

568
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,334
Hey, that works for me.
No problem.

569
01:04:50,402 --> 01:04:53,200
Uh, premium's all I got left.

570
01:04:53,272 --> 01:04:56,036
Fine. Uh, p-p-premium's-
premium's fine.

571
01:04:56,108 --> 01:04:58,201
It's b- better than fine.

572
01:04:58,277 --> 01:05:01,303
You have no idea how grateful I am.

573
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,871
I was, uh, practically on fumes.

574
01:05:06,952 --> 01:05:08,943
Move over, squirt.

575
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:23,329
<i>Do you happen to know anything</i>
<i>about any kind of relief center?</i>

576
01:05:23,402 --> 01:05:26,838
Emergency services,
anything like that?

577
01:05:26,905 --> 01:05:31,035
There's a- a refugee camp
being set up along 306.

578
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,704
<i>It's about 20 miles south</i>
<i>of Chillicothe.</i>

579
01:05:33,779 --> 01:05:35,804
It's where the cell signals
won't reach.

580
01:05:37,249 --> 01:05:40,241
Thanks. I'll try
heading down that way.

581
01:05:42,054 --> 01:05:43,639
Hey, did you hear that, squirt?

582
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,990
It's only four or five
hours' drive from here.

583
01:05:46,058 --> 01:05:49,050
Not that it'll do you
a damn bit of good.

584
01:05:55,067 --> 01:05:57,001
I'm hungry.

585
01:05:57,069 --> 01:06:00,334
I'm sure they got food
and a place to sleep.

586
01:06:00,406 --> 01:06:03,134
I bet they even have
other kids your age.

587
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,433
What about Mommy?

588
01:06:05,811 --> 01:06:08,746
<i>I'm sure that she would</i>
<i>want you to be okay...</i>

589
01:06:08,814 --> 01:06:11,248
before she'd ever want you
worrying about her.

590
01:06:11,316 --> 01:06:13,250
That's just the way mommies are.

591
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:16,310
I know it's hard,
but... try to-

592
01:06:17,322 --> 01:06:19,085
Hey. Hey!

593
01:06:19,158 --> 01:06:21,649
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

594
01:06:23,529 --> 01:06:25,656
Oh, shit.

595
01:07:03,569 --> 01:07:05,901
<i>Damn it.</i>

596
01:07:05,971 --> 01:07:07,905
I'm sorry.

597
01:07:07,973 --> 01:07:09,964
What do we do now?

598
01:07:11,677 --> 01:07:14,111
Someone will come along to help us.

599
01:07:14,179 --> 01:07:16,113
We just have to sit tight.

600
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:18,115
I haven't seen anybody else.

601
01:07:18,183 --> 01:07:21,710
Have you?
Not for a long time.

602
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:25,223
Look, by tomorrow morning
we'll be back on the road.

603
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:27,758
We just have to find
this refugee camp.

604
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:30,659
It's- It's only a-
It's only a couple of hours away.

605
01:07:30,729 --> 01:07:32,720
What's a refugee?

606
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,591
It's, um-

607
01:07:41,907 --> 01:07:44,239
It's someone who, um-

608
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:49,673
Well, who likes to camp.

609
01:07:54,553 --> 01:07:56,544
You know what?

610
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,850
We should try to
get some sleep, squirt.

611
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:04,293
I'm too scared to sleep.

612
01:08:04,363 --> 01:08:07,491
Oh, come on.

613
01:08:07,566 --> 01:08:10,797
Just like last summer.
King's Canyon?

614
01:08:10,869 --> 01:08:14,100
When it rained so hard
on the tent...

615
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:17,108
you wanted to go sleep in the car.

616
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,110
It's just like that.

617
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,169
- Okay?
- Okay.

618
01:08:22,614 --> 01:08:24,605
That's my girl.

619
01:08:28,053 --> 01:08:30,613
What is it?

620
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:36,150
<i>What do you see?</i>

621
01:08:39,064 --> 01:08:41,658
It's nothing.
I'm just, um-

622
01:08:41,733 --> 01:08:43,792
You know, just-just thinking.

623
01:08:56,014 --> 01:08:58,915
You know what?
I got an idea.

624
01:09:00,452 --> 01:09:02,317
Here.

625
01:09:02,387 --> 01:09:05,015
- Fix that up there.
- Okay.

626
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:07,991
- Up here.
- Hmm?

627
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,290
- There.
<i>- There.</i>

628
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:13,594
<i>That's it.</i>

629
01:09:13,665 --> 01:09:17,692
- What are we doing?
- We are making a tent.

630
01:09:17,769 --> 01:09:20,863
You're trying to
keep us safe, aren't you?

631
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,304
That's right.

632
01:09:24,376 --> 01:09:27,174
- From Mommy?
- From...

633
01:09:28,513 --> 01:09:30,140
whatever.

634
01:10:10,255 --> 01:10:13,019
There.

635
01:10:13,091 --> 01:10:15,025
How's that for a tent?

636
01:10:15,093 --> 01:10:17,874
Marta said the last
thing she would ever do

637
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:20,087
was seal herself
up in her own tomb.

638
01:10:22,267 --> 01:10:24,201
Yeah.

639
01:10:24,269 --> 01:10:26,362
- Well, it's not like that.
- Why not?

640
01:10:26,438 --> 01:10:28,429
Because it's not.

641
01:10:30,275 --> 01:10:32,266
Ah-

642
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:35,973
Go on to sleep, all right?

643
01:10:37,115 --> 01:10:39,413
Okay?

644
01:10:41,286 --> 01:10:43,277
<i>Good night, squirt.</i>

645
01:10:51,463 --> 01:10:53,454
<i>Justine.</i>

646
01:10:54,933 --> 01:10:57,026
<i>Justine.</i>

647
01:11:01,139 --> 01:11:03,130
Dad?

648
01:11:04,609 --> 01:11:06,600
Dad.

649
01:11:09,414 --> 01:11:12,406
Hmm?
What is it?

650
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,821
Go back to sleep, squirt.

651
01:11:42,447 --> 01:11:44,438
Dad.

652
01:11:50,322 --> 01:11:52,313
It's nothing, Justine.

653
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,382
<i>It's just the wind.</i>

654
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,389
<i>Justine.</i>

655
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:40,561
Mommy?

656
01:12:42,908 --> 01:12:46,537
I miss you.
I miss you so much.

657
01:12:58,089 --> 01:13:00,080
Justine!

658
01:13:03,028 --> 01:13:05,360
<i>Justine, can you hear me?</i>

659
01:13:06,598 --> 01:13:08,259
Justine, get back here!

660
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:11,063
Justine, shout if you can hear me!

661
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:13,127
<i>Justine!</i>

662
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:17,408
<i>Mommy?</i>

663
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:20,411
Honey, can you hear me?

664
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,913
Justine!

665
01:13:26,384 --> 01:13:28,875
<i>No, don't! Don't!</i>
<i>Justine!</i>

666
01:13:28,954 --> 01:13:32,253
<i>Th-That is not your mother, Justine!</i>

667
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:35,521
<i>Oh, Jesus! Come here!</i>

668
01:13:36,528 --> 01:13:38,962
<i>Come on, Justine!</i>

669
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:42,022
<i>Mommy! I want my mommy!</i>

670
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:45,627
I want my mommy!
I want my mommy!

671
01:13:45,704 --> 01:13:47,729
Stay put!

672
01:13:50,308 --> 01:13:53,072
No! Let me out!

673
01:13:53,144 --> 01:13:54,547
Justine- Please, Justine!

674
01:13:54,548 --> 01:13:57,410
Let me out! Let me out!
I hate you! I hate you!

675
01:13:57,482 --> 01:13:59,802
Please, Justine!
Justine, please! Listen!

676
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:00,576
I hate you!

677
01:14:00,652 --> 01:14:03,519
- It's your fault! You killed Mommy!
- That is not your mommy!

678
01:14:03,588 --> 01:14:07,820
- Shut up! Please! Please! Justine!
- You killed Mommy!

679
01:14:07,893 --> 01:14:10,054
- Shut up! Shut up!
- I hate you!

680
01:14:11,463 --> 01:14:14,398
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my- Oh, my God!

681
01:14:14,466 --> 01:14:19,096
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Justine, please! Please!

682
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:23,630
Oh, God. Oh, God, squirt.
I'm sorry.

683
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:26,643
Squirt, I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that.

684
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:29,737
I didn't mean to do that.
Okay? I'm sorry.

685
01:14:29,814 --> 01:14:33,341
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

686
01:14:33,418 --> 01:14:35,852
Daddy's really sorry.

687
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:37,912
I will never-

688
01:14:45,597 --> 01:14:47,690
If I went with her...

689
01:14:47,766 --> 01:14:50,030
she wouldn't be so sad...

690
01:14:50,101 --> 01:14:52,092
would she?

691
01:14:54,773 --> 01:14:56,764
You killed her.

692
01:14:58,276 --> 01:15:00,369
No, Justine.

693
01:15:00,445 --> 01:15:03,380
Yes, you did.
Your fault.

694
01:15:17,996 --> 01:15:19,930
What's that?

695
01:15:19,998 --> 01:15:22,432
Come here.
I'm so sorry.

696
01:15:24,169 --> 01:15:26,160
I'm so sorry.

697
01:15:30,241 --> 01:15:32,573
I love you so much.

698
01:16:25,263 --> 01:16:27,788
Justine, wake up.

699
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:39,902
Come on, stop!

700
01:16:41,446 --> 01:16:43,209
Please, please, please.

701
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:52,417
Oh, my God.

702
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:55,050
Attention. You will be
transferred to a secure location...

703
01:16:55,126 --> 01:16:58,584
outside existing
cellular coverage zones.

704
01:16:58,663 --> 01:17:02,429
<i>All transferees will be supplied food,</i>
<i>shelter and necessary provisions...</i>

705
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,434
<i>till the crisis is past.</i>

706
01:17:04,502 --> 01:17:09,098
Hey, squirt, come here.
Squirt, there is a bus out there.

707
01:17:09,174 --> 01:17:11,233
It is our ticket out of here. Okay?

708
01:17:11,309 --> 01:17:14,301
When I give you the word,
I need you to run straight for the bus.

709
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:16,313
You can do that?

710
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,315
- Mm-hmm.
- Good girl.

711
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,681
Come on. Come over here.
Daddy's got you.

712
01:17:21,753 --> 01:17:25,245
Okay, run. Run!

713
01:17:40,038 --> 01:17:43,098
Justine, keep going!

714
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:51,545
Come on, squirt! Run!
Run! Come on!

715
01:17:51,616 --> 01:17:55,484
You can do it. You can do it, kid.
Come on.

716
01:17:56,721 --> 01:18:00,384
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

717
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:18,872
- Justine, come on!
- She needs me.

718
01:18:21,212 --> 01:18:23,146
No. Justine.

719
01:18:23,214 --> 01:18:26,706
She is dead, and there's nothing
that we can do that can change that.

720
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:30,051
Come on.

721
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,562
Justine, look at me.

722
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:42,566
I will make this right.
I promise I will make this right.

723
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:44,761
Y-You have to believe in me.

724
01:18:44,836 --> 01:18:47,031
C-Can you do that?

725
01:18:49,107 --> 01:18:52,042
Then I need you to run
straight to the bus.

726
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:55,568
And whatever you do,
never look back.

727
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:57,638
Okay?

728
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:01,880
I love you with all my heart.

729
01:19:01,953 --> 01:19:03,944
I love you too, Daddy.

730
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:08,054
Okay.

731
01:19:08,126 --> 01:19:11,687
Now go.
I'll be right behind you.

732
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:15,489
I'm right behind you.

733
01:19:17,368 --> 01:19:19,029
<i>I love you...</i>

734
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,031
always.

735
01:19:29,447 --> 01:19:32,575
Daddy! Daddy!

736
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:34,447
Daddy!

737
01:19:35,987 --> 01:19:38,455
- Hold on, little soldier! Not so fast.
- Let me go!

738
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,457
- No, no. You're coming with us!
- Let me go!

739
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:42,493
- Let me go!
- You're coming with us, sweetie.

740
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,551
<i>No!</i>

741
01:19:46,197 --> 01:19:48,324
I know you'll never stop, Michelle.

742
01:19:50,168 --> 01:19:52,156
And there's no
place that I can take

743
01:19:52,157 --> 01:19:54,628
our daughter where she
won't try to find you...

744
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:57,072
<i>and you her.</i>

745
01:19:57,141 --> 01:19:58,520
So if you feel that you need

746
01:19:58,521 --> 01:20:00,736
to punish me for what
it is that I've done...

747
01:20:00,812 --> 01:20:03,747
<i>or if you just want someone</i>
<i>to share the loneliness...</i>

748
01:20:03,815 --> 01:20:05,749
<i>then...</i>

749
01:20:05,817 --> 01:20:07,808
I'll come with you.

750
01:20:09,254 --> 01:20:11,245
You can take me.

751
01:20:11,322 --> 01:20:15,349
<i>But please take me alone.</i>

752
01:20:17,929 --> 01:20:20,921
- I'm begging you. For Justine.
<i>- Daddy!</i>

753
01:20:20,999 --> 01:20:23,263
Daddy!

754
01:20:23,334 --> 01:20:25,359
Dad!

755
01:20:25,436 --> 01:20:27,870
<i>- Daddy!</i>
- For your daughter.

756
01:20:27,939 --> 01:20:30,931
For our- For our little girl.

757
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:34,501
Please.

758
01:20:38,249 --> 01:20:41,616
- You'll be okay with us. I promise.
- No! No. No.

759
01:20:41,686 --> 01:20:43,654
- Gonna take you-
- No! No!

760
01:20:43,721 --> 01:20:46,656
You'll be okay.
We'll take care of you. I promise you.

761
01:20:46,724 --> 01:20:49,522
- No!
- I got her. I got her.

762
01:21:05,576 --> 01:21:09,342
I always loved you, Michelle.

763
01:21:09,414 --> 01:21:12,212
Always and forever.

764
01:22:11,209 --> 01:22:13,200
Thank you.

765
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:40,931
Thank you.

766
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:55,042
Ah.

767
01:24:05,823 --> 01:24:08,007
It hurts now,
sweetheart.

768
01:24:10,928 --> 01:24:12,919
It won't always.
