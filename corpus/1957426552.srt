(intense music)

8
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,575
- Oh my god.

9
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,243
(man groaning)

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,511
You fool,

11
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,045
you haven't been on
the beat long enough

12
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,115
for your stomach to handle this.

13
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:27,053
(flies buzzing)

14
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,422
(vomiting)

15
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,789
- Jesus Christ.

16
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,726
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

17
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,695
- Freddie fuckin'
Mercury has never even

18
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,832

19
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:39,933
- Damn.

20
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,868
Who, what in the world could

21
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,902
even do something like this?

22
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,506
- Looks like what
we're dealing with here

23
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,208
is some kinda

24
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,243
sodomaniac.

25
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:55,181
(intense gloomy music)

26
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,035
- [Voiceover] Drop that shit.

27
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:52,939
(intense electronic music)

28
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,988
(people chattering)

29
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,591
- Not bad,

30
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,294
not bad at all.

31
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,195

00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,283
left out in the rain.

43
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,984
- My god.

44
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,519
You have a way with words.

45
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,754

00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,923

shit's not easy man.

53
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,038
- [Voiceover] Then

54
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,340
- Hey one day at
a time, that's it.

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,907
But I tell you what,

56
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,645

- Yo, horny ain't the word.

61
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,359
I don't even think
they got a word

62
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,663

00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,847

00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,316
- What the fuck are those?

72
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,686
- Relax son they're roofies.

73
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:23,222
Look, what do you
think alcohol is?

74
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,591
It's God's date rape drug.

75
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,093
Think guys buy girls drinks

76
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,461
just to be nice?

77
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,129
No, they buy chicks drinks

78
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,398
to loosen the waist
line of their panties.

79
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,700
Think these other assholes

80
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,068
could get laid without 'em?

81
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,269
- How's one of the first things

82
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,904
you gonna ask a man when
he come out the pen,

83
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,939
is whether or not
he been ass raped,

84
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,742
or he got dookie stains
all over his dick man?

85
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:43,976
- That's not what
I was gonna ask.

86
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,144
- Oh it's not?

87
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,145
It's not.

88
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,447
Here I am sittin' here,

89
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,915
I'm trying to have a drink,

90
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,250

three years of my life

91
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,286
and you gonna ask me
some shit like that.

92
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,554
- I didn't know
you'd get so mad.

93
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,255
- You didn't know
I'd get so mad?

94
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,924
What I look like to you

95
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,392
some kinda fuckin' fag?

96
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,527
Am I god damn
Teddy or something?

97
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,163
See, that's why
people don't like you.

98
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,832
Right there.

99
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:06,866
- People like me.

100
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,668
- No, people don't like you,

101
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,403
that's why they
call you Prejack.

102
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:14,207
You a premature
ejaculating mother fucker.

103
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,743
Damn I hate you son.

104
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,278
- He's got a point there man.

105
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,346
- I'm sorry.

106
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,248
- I gotta get outta here man.

107
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,883
I need to go somewhere

108
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,585
and get some titties
up in my face,

109
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,053
forget about you fags.

110
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,188
You know I ain't gonna
forget what you said right?

111
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,656
- I know, I said I'm sorry.

112
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,859
- You gonna pay for that.

113
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,962
All you mother
fuckers gonna pay.

114
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,331
Give me another beer man.

115
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,066
- All right all right.

116
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,234
- Hey and don't do nothing funny

117
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,568
to my drink.

118
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,337
I know how you and
your boys play.

119
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,840
That's what the fuck
I'm talkin' about

120
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,308
right there.

121
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,575
- Hello!

122
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,011
- [Ex-Convict] Shit.

123
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,246
- What can I get you?

124
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,281
- Can I get a brick
dog vodka please?

125
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,749
- Sure.

126
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,683
- [Ex-Convict] And you can
throw that on my tab home boy.

127
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:58,618
- No no no no--

128
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,284
- [Ex-Convict] What's up baby?

129
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,486
- That's on me.

130
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,921
Name's Todd.

131
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,991
- Uh, thanks Todd but
I got my own drinks.

132
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,758
- Well at least let me take 'em

133
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,294
back to your table huh?

134
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,328
I'd hate to see you spill 'em

135
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,563
all over the place,

136
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,065
ruin that pretty little
dress you're wearing.

137
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,400
(laughing)

138
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,768
- Do those lines ever work?

139
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,068
- I don't know
honey you tell me.

140
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,772
- Maybe, but I don't
think my friends

141
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,940
over there are gonna want

142
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,141
the extra company.

143
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,277
- [Prejack] Hey,
what's the wig for?

144
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,378
Are you guys coming from
chemotherapy or something?

145
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,314
- No, it's my girl's birthday

146
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,549
and we're all wigging out.

147
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,750
- Oh, it's your
friend's birthday?

148
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,018
Oh we gotta come over
and say hello now.

149
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,787
Don't you know it's a
whole year of bad luck

150
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,955
not to get hit on
on your birthday?

151
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,524
Now, do you want
your friends to have

152
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,326
a whole year of bad luck?

153
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,761
- I don't know,

154
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,962
I don't even know you guys.

155
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,831
- [Todd] Aw, we're good
people, right guys?

156
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,599
- Oh we're the best.

157
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,534
- Well, you seem okay,

158
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,304
but I still have to
check with them first.

159
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,604
- You do that.

160
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,207
We'll come over with the beers,

161
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,541
peace offering shot,

162
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,343
your friends don't
want us around,

163
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,279
well at least you got
good table service.

164
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,148
- Well, my mom always told me

165
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,783
not to take drinks
from strangers.

166
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,586
- Do you always listen to
what your mother tells you?

167
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,589
- I'll be right back.

168
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,228
So, those guys over there

169
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,563
wanna buy our drinks
and come join us.

170
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,532
- Finally, one of
these cheap bastards

171
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,733
did something.

172
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,068
Are they cute?

173
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,301
- Mm, so so.

174
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,403
- [Voiceover] So then
why bring them over?

175
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,671
They look like fucking creeps.

176
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,373
- Ugh, always the
positive one aren't we?

177
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,909
How do you know they're creeps?

178
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,077
They seem all right to me.

179
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,511
- A little bit of alcohol.

180
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,813
- I'm just saying,

181
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,914
I wouldn't trust them.

182
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,649
- Little bit of GHB.

183
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,150
- It's not like
we're screwing them,

184
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,751
they're gonna come over
and buy our drinks.

185
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:42,320
- And a little bit
of Spanish fly.

186
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,124
- [Voiceover] Makes
one great aphrodisiac.

187
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,125
- Hell yeah.

188
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,059
- [Prejack] Let's do this.

189
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,629
- You know what, I've had enough

190
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,097
wigging out for
one night anyway.

191
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,564
- [Friend] Really,
you're gonna leave?

192
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,333
- I don't have time to
deal with these scum bags.

193
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,767
- [Friend] Ugh, all right.

194
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:56,869
- You got that?

195
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,970
Oh wait a second,

196
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,071
aw one left.

197
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,907
That only leaves three.

198
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,742
- Uh, sorry boys,

199
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,976

00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,811

201
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,946

202
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,214
- Oh come on!

203
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,317
- Hey man, you can
always talk Teddy.

204
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,719
- [Man] Yo, let's get it in son.

205
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,922
- [Todd] Let's do it boys.

206
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,790
- Real funny guys

207
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,791
I'll just stick with the
big bird cage over here.

208
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,994
- Mother fuckers.

209
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,630
Mother fuckers gonna
play me like that?

210
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,869
- Well, here have a shot.

211
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,004
- Don't give a shit.

212
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,975
Ain't that some shit?

213
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,410
- I'm used to it.

214
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,211
- I know you used
to it numb nuts.

215
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,614
But I don't like being
played like that.

216
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,182
Oh yeah.

217
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,116
- Well--

218
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,251
- Mother fuckers gonna pay.

219
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,920
- At least we got a free shot.

220
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,890
- Yo.

221
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,258
You a,

222
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,527
that was one of the
girls' shots man.

223
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,463
- Oh shit.

224
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,432
Oh shit.

225
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,700
Out of my way bitch!

226
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,968
- [Voiceover] My beer!

227
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,002
- [Prejack] Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

228
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,002
- These,

229
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,305
these are my fuckin' friends.

230
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,873
Shit gonna change.

231
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,812
- [All] Hey!

232
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,450
(intense dance music)

233
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,612
- Shut up bitch,

234
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,981
I'm going to the bathroom.

235
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:49,949
- [Voiceover] Yeah Jones,

236
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,183
help her to the bathroom.

237
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,090
(high five slapping)

238
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,093
(tense electronic music)

239
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,908
- [Voiceover] Yo watch it!

240
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,344
- What up reject?

241
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,147
You look like shit.

242
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,848
Little more than usual.

243
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,584
- I had a shot.

244
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,118
- I bet you did buddy.

245
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,423
- Hey cuties!

246
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,657
- Hey Teddy.

247
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:32,825
- It's a shame to
see such delish boys

248
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,094
all alone on a
night like tonight!

249
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,696
Hey Teddy?

250
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,497
That's all I get?

251
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,332
Shit I'm the best
lookin' person in here

252
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,501

talk to you tonight,

253
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,069
and that's how you greet me?

254
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,304
- [Man] Oh Chris breathe.

255
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,906
- Well someone's
a little toasty.

256
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,907
- I think he had
a little too much.

257
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,142
- Good, that's how I like 'em.

258
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,111
- Well, come on pal,

259
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,545
I gotta get you outta here.

260
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,417
I'll catch you later Teddy.

261
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,286
- See ya!

262
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,157
I'll get those boys one day.

263
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,526
Teddy always gets his man.

264
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:14,166
(gloomy music)

265
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,802
- Shit, I forgot my jacket,

266
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,170
I'll be right back.

267
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:23,142
(footsteps tapping)

268
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,615
(eerie music)

269
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,823
- [Voiceover] Prejack.

270
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,727
Prejack.

271
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,398
(thunder booming)

272
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,633
Come here.

273
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,902
Come here Prejack I'm over here.

274
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,471
Over here.

275
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,373
- Hello?

276
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,908
Derrick?

277
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,343
- [Voiceover] This
isn't Derrick Prejack.

278
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,611
(hissing)

279
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,578
- [Prejack] Oh shit!

280
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,079

281
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,248

00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,519
Your ass is mine Jacky boy.

284
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,656

285
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:13,459
(laughing)

286
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,263
Hey Jack.

287
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,397
- Who's there?

288
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,732
I'm really gonna be sick,

289
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,634

get me outta here.

290
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,735
I drank that shot.

291
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,436
- [Voiceover] I drank that shot,

292
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,738
I drank that shot guys.

293
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,339
Get me outta here,

00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,774

295
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,209

297
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,111
Run Prejack run!

298
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,019
(Prejack breathing heavily)

299
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,353
- Too fucked up for this shit.

300
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,320
- [Voiceover] Gotcha.

301
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,422
- What are you doing?

302
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,590
What do you want from me?

303
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,091
Oh no!

304
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,326
- [Voiceover] Let me see
that pretty ass of yours.

305
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,294
- Get that knife
away from my ass.

306
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,595
No!

307
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:53,532
(Prejack screaming)

308
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,776
(killer grunting)

309
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,689
(birds chirping)

310
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,560
- Where the fuck am I?

311
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,938
And where the fuck
are my clothes?

312
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,242
What the hell did
you do last night?

313
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,977
Fucked up this time.

314
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,523
God damn it!

315
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,792
(exhaling)

316
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,328
Quiet night out with
the girls right?

317
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,531
All right.

318
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:05,504
(upbeat tropical music)

319
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,841
- God damn, those girls
were fine last night boys.

320
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,109
- Eh, I've had better.

321
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,778
- I've seen the girls
that you've been with.

322
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,114
- Yeah bro, my
cousin in the Army

323
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,216
seen less grenades
than your ass.

324
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,618
- Man fuck you guys man.

325
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,287
Chick I had last night

326
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,989
was a real ball drainer.

327
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,892
- Yeah I thought you
looked a little lighter.

328
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,260
- Now now boys,

329
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,263
last night was just a
warm up for tonight.

330
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,498
- That's right boys,

331
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,400
this place is gonna
be crawling with poon.

332
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,168
- I'm gonna eat that shit up.

333
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,038
(grunting)

334
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,243
(laughing)

335
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,879
- Speaking of poon.

336
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,380
- Oh shit.

337
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,683
Good morning!

338
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,117
- Good morning.

339
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,786
- Hey walking kinda
funny there sweetie,

340
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,621
Chauncey must have did
a number on your ass.

341
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,889
(laughing)

342
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,424
- Hit it so good
she can't walk right

343
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,092
in the morning.

344
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,260
- Oh, that's real nice,

345
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,694
you talk to a lady like that?

346
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,731
- No, no it's not at all.

347
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,599
- I see no lady's presence so

348
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,234
who gives a fuck?

349
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,170
- Really?

350
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,771
You're really gonna
talk to me like that?

351
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,039
- Why not?

352
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:14,939
We already got what
we wanted from you.

353
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,442
- And it was good.

354
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,578
- Wait, what do you mean we?

355
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,516
Got to be kidding me.

356
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,352
- Sorry sweetheart, we
don't joke around here.

357
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,788
- Actually we have very
bad bad senses of humor.

358
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,690
- All right that's enough.

359
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,126
- Hey you guys are something
else you know that?

360
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,060
- Can I give you a ride home?

361
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,529
- No, stay away from me,

362
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,998
I don't want any of you near me.

363
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,199
- Look, are you sure I--

364
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,367
- I'm sure, I just
wanna get out of here.

365
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,935

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,565
What, what's the problem man?

381
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,200
- Do you treat every woman

382
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,602
that comes through
here like that?

383
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,536
- No.

384
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,671

385
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,640
to get those sluts out
of here by the morning.

386
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,675
- You guys are unbelievable.

387
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:24,909
- Calm down guys,

388
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,512
we got more important
things to take care of.

389
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,780
Throwing a big party tonight,

390
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,014
we need booze,

391
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,681
we need snacks, and
most importantly,

392
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:31,350
we need--

393
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,418
- Drugs!

394
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,218
- Yes, thank you Trent,

395
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,487
we need more drugs.

396
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,789
Throw this party every year,

397
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,424
not letting anybody down.

398
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,626
- Shit, I don't wanna
let my dick down

399
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,427
you know what I mean?

400
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,694
Can only get the finest

401
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,229
of the mother fuckin'
fine up in this place.

402
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,431
So.

403
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,765
- You wanna do some
clam diving tonight bro.

404
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,668
- Diving in, diving in.

405
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,136
- You guys ever let up?

406
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,273
- Hamilton, what
is with this guy?

407
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,542
Why is he such a puss?

408
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,877
Do you understand what
you've been given?

409
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,580
The golden mother
fuckin' ticket to pussy.

410
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,649
I don't think he
deserves it guys.

411
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,783
- Nope, doesn't deserve it.

412
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,352
- Give him a break guys.

413
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,621
And Derrick, please
try to loosen up.

414
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,523
If you're ever gonna
lose that V of yours,

415
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,125
you're gonna have to get
that stick outta your ass.

416
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,326
- Stop the presses,

417
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,661
stop the fuckin' presses.

418
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,929
- Did I just hear that right

419
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,530
or am I just really
baked from my wake?

420
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,799
- Derrick, you're
still a virgin?

421
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,267
- No, what he meant was--

422
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,402
- What I meant was

423
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,603
he's still a virgin.

424
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,973
- Your balls must be huge.

425
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,475
- Derrick, how you go

426
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,477
this long without ever
busting one up in there?

427
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,446
- Even my autistic cousin

428
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,380
has shot one up
the cherry shoot.

429
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,649
- All right guys calm down,

430
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,684
I didn't bring it
up so we could all

431
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:39,918
bust his balls,

432
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,352
I brought up so that
this mother fucker

433
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,654
busts his own balls tonight

434
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,922
if you know what I'm saying.

435
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,891
- I'm picking up what
you're throwing down.

436
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,494
- Man we gotta get this
pussy laid tonight.

437
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,696
- Thanks guys but I really
don't think I need your help.

438
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,030
- I think you do bro.

439
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,931
- I think you do.

440
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:53,966
I think you do.

441
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,033
I think he does,

442
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,735
we're gonna get you laid.

443
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,370
We're gonna get you
laid, yeah yeah.

444
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,441
Gonna get that little
dry dick wet boy.

445
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,909
Yeah.

446
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,511
- [Chauncey] You better
get that dick some swimmies

447
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,812
it ain't ever been
swimming before.

448
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,946
- Throw that fucker right in,

449
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:08,914
that's how I learned.

450
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,349
- [Derrick] Okay guys.

451
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,252
- Just don't pull a Prejack.

452
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,553
- Oh I'm Prejacking,

453
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,054
I'm Prejacking, I
just stuck it in and.

454
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,991
- Mother fucker came before
he put the condom on man.

455
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,627
- God it's so

456
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,662
lubed.

457
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,031
- Wait a minute guys.

458
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,269
- Derrick, is this how
you always imagined it?

459
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,770
- All right enough enough.

460
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,907
(laughing)

461
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,542
- No, for real, wait a minute,

462
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,110
where's Prejack?

463
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,179
- He's probably up in
his room Prejacking.

464
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,116
- I thought, he didn't
come home with you guys?

465
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,051
- No, we all thought
he left with you.

466
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,485
- Nah, he got wasted

467
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,288
and he had one of
them spiked shots.

468
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,522
- He actually drank that?

469
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,724
- You gave him a spiked drink?

470
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,159
- I mean I told him
to drink it as a joke,

471
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,161
I never thought the
little sphincter boy

472
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,262
would actually drink it.

473
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,197
- Well, I mean,

474
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,464
we were talking with Teddy.

475
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,166
- He was with Teddy?

476
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,768
- Dude he got straight raped.

477
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,203
(laughing)

478
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,870
- You know how Teddy is,

479
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,773
he's always trying to
bring some drunk guy home,

480
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:08,940
gay or straight.

481
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,409
- Just ask Trent.

482
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,277
- He didn't fuck me,

483
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,679
I just slept on his couch,

484
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,714
I was fuckin' wasted bro.

485
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,417
- Dude, now how you
know it didn't happen?

486
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,717
- Yo fuck you man.

487
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,520
- All right guys we all
know Trent didn't get

488
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,722
straight raped, I'm
sure Prejack is fine.

489
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,490
Can we get back to business?

490
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,025
Can we start planning this party

491
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,760
without any further
interruptions?

492
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,431
(doorbell ringing)

493
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,001
What?

494
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,402
Trent!

495
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,139
- [Chauncey] Is it
Valentine's Day already Trent?

496
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,041
- [Trent] Fuck you man.

497
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,043
- Who are they...

498
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:47,412
Oh.

499
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,750
- Who would be
sending me flowers?

500
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,252
- Yeah, well who
are they from man,

501
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,086
who are they from?

502
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:54,920
- I'm lookin' dude,

503
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,154
I'm fuckin' lookin'.

504
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,089
Jesus.

505
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,290
- I hope he's cute.

506
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,925
- Wish somebody would
send me flowers.

507
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,027
- Aw, I'll send you
flowers Chaunce.

508
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,162
- Oh, Todd you're my hero.

509
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,164
- What's it say?

510
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,202
- [Chauncey] Is
it from his mommy?

511
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,037
I bet his mommy loves him.

512
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,573
- Trent's mommy loves him.

513
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,775
(smooching)

514
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,709
- What's it say?

515
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:18,744
- Doesn't say nothing dude,

516
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,312
it doesn't say nothin'.

517
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,413
- Fuck me, okay buddy.

518
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,347
- I wonder if they're from

519
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,682
Prejack's secret admirer.

520
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,650
- [Trent] What?

521
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,118
- Oh you know that dildo

522
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,120
got the same kind of
flowers yesterday.

523
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,420
- Yeah and they looked

524
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,589
just like that shit.

525
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,790
Holy shit man.

526
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,358
- That fucker didn't tell me

527
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,893
about gettin' any flowers.

528
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,795
- Nah man I fuckin'
seen it when he got it.

529
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,430
He fuckin' took the card and ran

530
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,598
right up into his room.

531
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,033
- What are we waiting for?

532
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,602
- Maybe we should
respect his privacy guys.

533
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,140
- [Both] Nah.

534
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,343
(giggling)

535
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:59,318
(suspenseful music)

536
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:05,357
- Dude, it smells like
sour milk in here.

537
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,524
- No.

538
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,226
No that's jizz man,

539
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,661
that's jizz.

540
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,829
- I don't think we
should be in here,

541
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,996
this is Prejack's room.

542
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,065
- Relax Derrick,

543
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,299
we just wanna see the flowers.

544
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,966
- And there they are.

545
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:19,037
(intense effect)

546
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,005
- What?

547
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,412
(laughing)

548
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,347
- I don't know what the fuck

549
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,381
this thing's trying to say.

550
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,682
- Hey Trent was yours as

551
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,417
anally cryptic as his?

552
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,985
- Mine was nothing like this.

553
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,455
I don't know what
this shit's about.

554
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,789
- You guys got a secret admirer,

555
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,291
that's what that shit's about.

556
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,559
- How sweet is that?

557
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,427
- Yo, we ain't got no
fuckin' secret admirer,

558
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,062
it's just somebody
fuckin' with us,

559
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,397
and how do I know
it isn't one of you

560
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,630
mother fuckers?

561
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:47,566
- Doubt it.

562
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,034
- Can we get back to the party?

563
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,269
- Yeah, fuck this home
boy shit anyway man.

564
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,237
- Right?

565
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,205
Let's forget about this shit,

566
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,740
let's get ready for the party.

567
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,974
- Right, 'cause a missing
friend's not important.

568
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,442
- He's around.

569
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,211
I'm not worried about
his pre-cumming ass.

570
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,279
Who's ready for their missions?

571
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,449
(tense music)

572
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,118
Chauncey, you're on snacks.

573
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,053
- Good dude, 'cause I
got the major munchies.

574
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,322
- [Friend] It is
the least important

575
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,723
of the supplies, but then again,

576
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,492
this is what will keep
the fat girls busy

577
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,026
while we mack on
their hot friends.

578
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:18,797
Todd, you're in charge of
the liquid pantie remover.

579
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,833
(upbeat goofy music)

580
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,740
No, make sure it's
stuff girls like.

581
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,641
- Oh.

582
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,943
Yeah.

583
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,578
- [Friend] Get some spice rum,

584
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,980
vodka, and a whisky.

585
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,915
Probably a tequila, and
don't forget the juice,

586
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,818
sour mix, and sodas, diet sodas.

587
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,853
That should cover
just about everything.

588
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:47,626
Trent, you my man are
in charge of the drugs.

589
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,761
(quick electronic music)

590
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,296
That's right, we need
all kinds of drugs.

591
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,931
Uppers,

592
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,633
downers,

593
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,334
skippy-flippies,

594
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:58,870
husker doos,

595
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,171
husker don'ts,

596
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,973
scooter dees,
jelly-stingers, trick sticks,

597
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,408
dingers, dangers, polly
wallies, bing bang,

598
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,142
hashish, flying
Willards, PCP, sinkers,

599
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,144
pot, shrooms,

600
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,312
and of course

601
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,648
the three greatest
letters in the alphabet,

602
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,515
GHB.

603
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,318
Derrick, since
Prejack's not here,

604
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,485
you're on bitch duty.

605
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,854
- You know,

606
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,389
I still can't believe
you guys aren't

607
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,956
worried about where Prejack is

608
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,425
what the fuck?

609
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,995
Ugh.

610
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:24,929
- Get every inch of
this shit hole spotless.

611
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,964
Nothing makes a girl less horny

612
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,331
than a dirty pad.

613
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,601
(doorbell ringing)

614
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,273
Damn it Cunter,

615
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,475
what do you want?

616
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,775
We're very busy.

617
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,377
- Did you guys hear?

618
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,846
- Hear what, that
you're not invited

619
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,180
to our party and
you're here to beg us

620
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,014
like you always do?

621
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,448
Yeah, I heard that.

622
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,650
- No no, about what happened
to Prejack last night.

623
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,852
- What happened to Prejack?

624
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,086
- Can I come in?

625
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,321
- To our house?

626
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,456
No fuckin' way, we got
a big party tonight,

627
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,158
I don't need you
stinkin' up the place.

628
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,659
- Guess you don't want to
know what happened to Prejack.

629
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,128
- Come on Hamilton,
yeah we wanna know,

630
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,062
just let him in.

631
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,297
- Dude it's gonna take days

632
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,232
to get the stink
out of the couch.

633
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,366
- Ah, come on Hamilton,

634
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,335
let go of the man.

635
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,736
- Fine,

636
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,104
you guys are really overstepping
your fuckin' boundaries

637
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,138
with me today.

638
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,572
Come here, Cunter.

639
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,980
So what's the big news Cunter?

640
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,616
- Hunter, you guys
know my name is Hunter,

641
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,485
it is not Cunter, so
if you guys wanna know,

642
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,586
you have to stop
calling me that.

643
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:22,587
- No way I'm gonna--

644
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,523
- No we'll call you Hunter,

645
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,756
just get on with it.

646
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,826
- Well, Prejack was
found in the alley

647
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:28,793
behind the bar.

648
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,029
- Oh woo.

649
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,364
- So he passed out in the alley,

650
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,298
that's nothing new.

651
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,633
- Well how's this for new?

652
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:39,004
His asshole was
ripped to shreds.

653
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:42,474
(intense music)

654
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,379
His guts were
practically spewing

655
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,713
out of his exit hole.

656
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,981
- How'd you hear about this?

657
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,383
- My mom's a police dispatch,

658
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,084
she got the call
late last night.

659
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,419
- Do you know what this means?

660
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,921
- Means that fuckin' Prejack

661
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,556
was a fuckin' bird shitter.

662
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,224
- Bird shitter?

663
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,926
- I always knew that kid

664
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,827
was a little sissy faggot.

665
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:03,828
I told you guys.

666
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,297
- Once everyone finds out,

667
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,531
they're not gonna
come to this party,

668
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,331
they're gonna think
that we're all

669
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,633
fuckin' fruits too.

670
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:09,768
- Really?

671
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:10,702
Is that what
they're gonna think?

672
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,237
Is that your main concern?

673
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,905
- You're right.

674
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,641
Maybe we don't have to worry.

675
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,910
Cunt, Hunter,

676
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,546
who else knows about this?

677
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,481
- Well as of now
no one else knows.

678
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,617
The story's not even
breaking until tomorrow.

679
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:26,851
- Good.

680
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,054
Then we have time to
do damage control.

681
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,288
- But as I said, that is

682
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,157
as of now no one knows,

683
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,792
but if I start babbling.

684
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,593
- You won't.

685
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,462
- I don't know.

686
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,564
I might not if--

687
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,032
- If what?

688
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,900
- [Hunter] If you guys let
me come to the party tonight.

689
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,569
- Fine, you can come.

690
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,437
But you can't talk to anybody,

691
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,939
you gotta stand in the shadows,

692
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,474
and you don't drink
any of our booze.

693
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,342
- Okay you got it you got it.

694
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,611
- Now get outta here,

695
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,746
and keep that litter box
you call a mouth shut.

696
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,281
- Okay guys, all right,

697
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,082
I'll see you later.

698
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,985
Got it, see you guys later.

699
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,387
- Fuckin' idiot.

700
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,888
- Can you believe that?

701
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,857
- What that our friend
was fuckin' ass murdered?

702
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,225
- No that fuckin'
Cunter's coming over

703
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,360
to our party tonight.

704
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,828
- This is gonna suck big time.

705
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,930
- Guys, no one cares

706
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,932
that fuckin' Prejack's dead?

707
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,300
- Ah, the guy said
he always wanted to

708
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,135
go out with a bang, so.

709
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,771
(laughing)

710
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,040
- All right.

711
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,575
Enough fuckin' around.

712
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,743
Everybody get to your duties,

713
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,044
be back here in an hour or two.

714
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,113
Let's not let Prejack ruin

715
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,016
yet another fuckin' party.

716
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,117
All right everybody

717
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,119
get your hands in.

718
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,920
(hands slapping)

719
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,691
You gonna get in on
this Derrick or what?

720
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,092
Look,

721
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,461
Prejack's dead,

722
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,230
there's nothing we
can do about that.

723
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,831
After the party tonight,

724
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,399
we'll mourn.

725
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,669
But right now we have
bigger fish to fry.

726
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,936
- Hopefully I'll be mourning

727
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,638
in the pussy of a
big titty redhead.

728
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:56,474
(laughing)

729
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,676
- Look, it's bad
luck not to have

730
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,277
the whole wolf
pack in the circle.

731
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,446
Get your hand in.

732
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,721
All right, on three.

733
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,756
One, two,

734
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:12,857
three.

735
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,325
- [All] Wolf pack!

736
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,194
- Let's get it in son.

737
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,931
(people chattering)

738
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,402
(calm hip hop music)

739
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,775
(knocking)

740
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:36,581
(people shouting)

741
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,387
♪ I know I'm on a

742
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,389
♪ I know I'm ♪

743
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,756
- Yo, Prejack got these flowers

744
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,692
with this creepy
ass message man.

745
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,528
Ends up bleeding like a
pig from his corn hole.

746
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,098
I'm afraid the same thing's
gonna happen to me man.

747
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,165
- Why don't you do
another fuckin' line man?

748
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,934
That should help.

749
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,936
First off man, I was
being sarcastic about that

750
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,137
doing another line shit,

751
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,370
that shit ain't
gonna help you none.

752
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,740
Second off, don't
be comin' up in here

753
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,374
talkin' about no ass
rape with no man.

754
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,076
I don't wanna know
nothin' about that.

755
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,244
I don't wanna hear that shit.

756
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,846
I ain't your fuckin'
psychologist.

757
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,581
What kind of person
do you think I am?

758
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,948
You think I sit around
with my buddies,

759
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,317
talkin' about gettin' ass raped?

760
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,385
No I don't, I ain't
got no friends,

761
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,887
'cause I ain't got no
time for no friends.

762
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,388
I ain't got no time
for no friends,

763
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,290
because I'm always with
some dumbass mother fucker

764
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,892
like you, talking
about his problems.

765
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,660
His boy got ass humped to death,

766
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,430
what kinda shit is that man?

767
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,865
- Sorry.

768
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,333
- Don't be man,

769
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,168
I'm just trying to be tougher.

770
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,535
Everybody says I'm too nice.

771
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,037
And everybody says drug dealers

772
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,806
are supposed to be mean, and
hard, and shit like that.

773
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,642
That's why I got
me one of these.

774
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,744
(gun clacking)

775
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,012
Pretty cool huh?

776
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,379
Makes me feel like a
mother fucking man.

777
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,314
- Can I hold it?

778
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,549
- Hell no,

779
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,750
you don't touch
another man's gun

780
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,485
what the fuck is
wrong with you kid?

781
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,853
Here's your shit,

782
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,156
could be 600.

783
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,261
(glass shattering)

784
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,800
(tense music)

785
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:10,108
(drowned out hip hop music)

786
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,853
(distant thudding)

787
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,822
- Dude, you okay?

788
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,225
(intense gloomy music)

789
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,328
Dude.

790
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,397
Is everything all
right in there?

791
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:41,739
- [Voiceover] Got ya.

792
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:43,608
- What the fuck?

793
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,676
- [Voiceover] Shut the fuck up

794
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,843
and roll over!

795
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,078
- No!

796
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,580
- [Voiceover] Well
then have it your way.

797
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,014
- Oh!

798
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,450
Oh god, please
god, no please god.

799
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,220
- [Voiceover] This is God.

800
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,422
- Oh god!

801
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,691
- [Voiceover] Not
the bearded guy,

802
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,459
it's just your ass.

803
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,761
My god.

804
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,964
- Oh, ah!

805
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,802
(laughing)

806
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,438
- [Voiceover] More!

807
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,906
Ah!

808
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:18,076
(intense grinding)

809
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,712
(knocking on door)

810
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,047
Don't even fucking
think about it.

811
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,616
- [Voiceover] Is
everything okay in there?

812
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,317
This is the hotel manager.

813
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,952
I called the police.

814
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:28,953
- Thank god.

815
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,221
See mother fucker?

816
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,756
You ain't gettin'
away with this.

817
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,024
- [Voiceover] You
lucked out this time.

818
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,325
Or did you?

819
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,561
- What?

820
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,361
- [Voiceover] Having
to tell the police

821
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,196
and then your wolf pack

822
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,797
that you were raped.

823
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,700
Your father would love
to hear that story.

824
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,335
Or how about one day,

825
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,137
when you look into
your son's eyes,

826
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,371
and he asks you why you always

827
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,407
have to sit on that
special pillow.

828
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,975
Hemorrhoids maybe?

829
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:51,943
- Fuck you!

830
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,144
- [Voiceover] That's right,

831
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,712
you'll have to explain
this to everyone

832
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,614
for the rest of your life.

833
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:57,916
How do you think
they'll treat you

834
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,216
after that?

835
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,019
Try and explain to
the girls you bang

836
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,221
before you have to take
off an adult diaper

837
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,923
before you get down.

838
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,324
'Cause you'll have to,

839
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,627
I've already done a
real number down there.

840
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,296
Ain't no shit ever

841
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,897
staying in there.

842
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,131
- Just kill me now.

843
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,433
- [Voiceover] You
had your chance.

844
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,002
I think living with this
is a worse fate for you.

845
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:21,572
Or maybe your drug dealing
friend in there can help you

846
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,373
in the bathroom.

847
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:26,511
Later sweet cheeks.

848
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,979
(smooching)

849
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,248
(laughing)

850
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,350
- [Voiceover] I don't
have time for this shit!

851
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,784
Is everything okay in there?

852
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,454
- [Trent] I'm fine, I'm fine.

853
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,688
(knocking)

854
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,123
- [Voiceover] Hello?

855
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,892
This is the fucking
hotel manager.

856
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,260
- Fuckin' ass.

857
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,461
- [Voiceover] Is
everything okay in there?

858
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,562
I hear some crazy shit
going on in there.

859
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,398
Knock knock, who's there?

860
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,434
It's the fucking hotel manager

861
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,735
and I don't have
time for this shit.

862
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,906
Did I mention I'm
the hotel manager?

863
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,774
(knocking)

864
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:57,708
I'm a hotel manager,

865
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,743
not deaf.

866
00:32:58,743 --> 00:32:59,844
I can hear you in there,

867
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,747
fucking answer me.

868
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,215
- Can I hold this?

869
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,449
- [Voiceover] I make five
dollars a fuckin' hour

870
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,951
to manage this god damn--

871
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,120
- I wanna feel like a man.

872
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,787
I wanna feel like a man.

873
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,992
(gun fires)

874
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,060
- [Voiceover] You don't
like me or somethin'?

875
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,330
(intense effect)

876
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,166
- Shit.

877
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:27,038
Aw, please don't let this
shit be for fuckin' me.

878
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:32,210
(tense music)

879
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:35,947
Holy shit dude

880
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,180
just fuckin' scared
the shit outta me.

881
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,816
- What's scary is the
mess that's inside.

882
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,385
How often you guys clean?

883
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,652
It's gross in there.

884
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,121
Maybe if you take like a

885
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,689
Sunday when you're not
doing anything in the,

886
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,457
who are they from?

887
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:47,992
- I don't know.

888
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,596
- Have you heard from
Trent at all today?

889
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:54,599
- No man, I haven't heard
from him since he left.

890
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,935
- [Voiceover] Please

think the flowers

have something to do with
what happened with Prejack?

905

00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:35,807
- Oh I'm a weirdo?

910
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:36,640
I'm a fuckin' weirdo
'cause I can put

911
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,875
two and two together?

912
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,110
Why didn't you open
the card outside then?

913
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,112
- Just in case it's
me I don't wanna know.

914
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,947
- He's got a fuckin'
point all right?

915
00:34:43,947 --> 00:34:47,085
Prejack gets flowers, dead.

916
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,853
Trent gets flowers,
still not home yet.

917
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:51,121
- He's fine.

918
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,589
Chauncey give him a call.

919
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,625
- Got it.

920
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,427
- All right, when Trent
picks up the phone

921
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,428
and talks to Chauncey,

922
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,462
I need you to,

923
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,465
I mean I need you

924
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,732

925
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,702
fuckin' thing you
got going on here.

926
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,170
- All right, look,

927
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,939
if Trent picks up then yeah
I'll drop it all right?

928
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,507
And I'll just go
along with your party.

929
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,343
- Answered.

930
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,578
- See, now put it
on speaker phone

931
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,814
so these fuckin' twats
can hear his voice.

932
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:19,549
- [Voiceover] Check the
card ya fuckin' homos.

933
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,086
I want you to see who's next.

934
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,187
- Hang it up, hang it up!

935
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,690
- Who the fuck was that man?

936
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,226
Yo D man I think
you were right bro.

937
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,961
- I knew something was up.

938
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,662

00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,232
Are you fuckin' with Hamilton?

941
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,267
For real fuckin' real
are you fuckin' with me?

942
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,502
- No dude, we're not
fuckin' with you man.

943
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,538
- This means Trent's
fucking dead.

944
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,772
- It does not fuckin' mean that.

945
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,674
- Well then what does
it mean Hamilton?

946
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,610
All right, that
sure as fuck wasn't

947
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,445
Trent's voice on the phone.

948
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,447
I guarantee ya, whoever's
name is on that card

949
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,649
is fuckin' next man.

950
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,250
- That's bullshit.

951
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,919
- We need to check that card.

952
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,520
- The only thing we need to do,

953
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,855
is we need to find Trent,

954
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,457
and we need to call
that Jamaican kid

955
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,525
from Planned Parenthood,

956
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,359
'cause as of right now,

957
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,561
we don't have any drugs.

958
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,163
- On it.

959
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,697
- Look, Hamilton I

960
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,032
important to you, but this
is our fucking lives here.

961
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,567
What about that
don't you understand?

962
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:13,037
(serene Japanese music)

963
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,342
- We're not checking
the flowers.

964
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,213
(screaming)

965
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,182
- You ass hole!

966
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,183
- What did you call me?

967
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,385
- You heard me, ass hole!

968
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,686
For far too long you've had your

All right, we're talking about

00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,926
another one of us dying here,

972
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,628
and all you care about

973
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,230
Shit's getting

975
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,833
- You wanna see what's

976
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,139
(tense music)

977
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,640
- Fuck did you do that for?

978
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,942
- I'm the fuckin' leader,

979
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,310
you will do as I say.

980
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,811
I'm the fuckin' alpha male.

981
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,146
You follow me.

982
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,048
- You're a real fuckin'
piece of work man.

983
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:57,982
- Thank you.

984
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,383
- Yeah well I've fuckin' had it,

985
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,519

was your fuckin' name

986
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,486
on that fuckin' card Hamilton,

987
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,089
I'm fuckin' out of here!

988
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:06,991
- And miss the party?

989
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,160
- Fuck your fuckin' party man.

990
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,428
- Todd Todd Todd wait.

991
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,462
Wait what if it's
your name on the card?

992
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,564
Or what if it's my name
on the card all right?

993
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,932
At least stay here,

994
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,167
at least I can watch your back

995
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,335
and you can watch mine.

996
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,470
- That's really sweet guys.

997
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,372
- Fuckin' adorable.

998
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:23,808
- All right bro,

999
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,143
I'll do this for you.

1000
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,378
(hands clapping)

1001
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,948
(cat meowing)

1002
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,316
- Are we done?

1003
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,384
Are we done?

1004
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:35,419
(sighing)

1005
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,621
- I guess so.

1006
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,123
- Good, then let's
fucking party!

1007
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:43,527
(intense dubstep music)

1008
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,136
- Derrick, I still don't
know about this man.

1009
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,438
- The killer could be anyone.

1010
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,607
We just have to narrow it down.

1011
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,775
- Do you really think
the killer's gonna come?

1012
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,377
Here, tonight.

1013
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:00,544
- I mean,

1014
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,283
I guarantee it.

1015
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,317
Whoever it is knows
we're gonna be here,

1016
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,186
it's a perfect night to strike.

1017
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,888
- I'm not feeling this bro.

1018
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,424
- Just stick with me
and we'll be fine.

1019
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,393
- I need another drink.

1020
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,594
Yesterday.

1021
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,899
- What the fuck did I just say?

1022
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,306
- My house,

1023
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,974
I can do whatever I want.

1024
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,143
House beer.

1025
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,511
- Calm down, will you please

1026
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,979
not get so wasted right now?

1027
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,415
- Look Derrick,

All right, you heard that guy.

1031
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,788
We're assholes.

1032
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:45,790
- Yeah but not everybody here

1033
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,091
wants to fuck bang us to death.

1034
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,392
I mean that's a certain
level of hatred,

1035
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,759
I don't think these guys are on.

1036
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,229
- Hurry up before I
butt fuck you to death!

1037
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:55,665
- Well, I think you can
add that guy to the list.

1038
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,102
- Come on, let's go

1039
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:01,705

1040
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:29,567

Nobody touches my hair.

- Oh yeah mind if I

00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,125
- [Chauncey] Nice.

- [Chauncey] What?

1077
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:34,531

00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,768

00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,772
But, you think

1082
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,174

Nobody's trying to rape us man.

1086
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,314

the hell's going on?

1087
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:51,781
- I don't know.

1088
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,853
But it ain't that.

1089
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,621
It ain't that.

1090
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,225
Dude I gotta get outta here,

1091
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,692
you gotta go meet
the Jamaican man

1092
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,028
from Planned Parenthood here.

1093
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,296
- All right man, all right.

1094
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,098
- You do them rest of
them lines there bra,

1095
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,467
it's the real thing.

1096
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,235
- Don't mind if I do.

1097
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,403
- [Hamilton] Aye.

1098
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,772
(sniffing)

1099
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,176
- Oh yeah, what a rush!

1100
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:20,944
The fuck?

1101
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,247
(intense music)

1102
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,884
(intense dubstep music)

1103
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,420
(all shouting)

1104
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,022
- This is the best
day of my life.

1105
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,863
- What about Blake?

1106
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,931
You know, he just
got out of jail.

1107
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,366
I mean isn't that how
those guys in jail

1108
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,968
deal with problems?

1109
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:47,171
They just rape the guy that
wronged 'em or whatever?

1110
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,672
- I don't know him that well.

1111
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,841
But, would he have
a reason to do it?

1112
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,509
- He was pretty pissed
off the other night

1113
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,845
when we left him at the bar.

1114
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,615
All you mother fuckers
is gonna pay he said.

1115
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:58,982
- Jesus that makes sense,

1116
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,451
I mean man gets out of prison,

1117
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,353
you guys are utter
pricks to him,

1118
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,921
and now he's
getting his revenge.

1119
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,890
- Does that make any sense?

1120
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,290
Derrick,

1121
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,561
Derrick, jail changes people yo.

1122
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,129
All right, you can take the

1123
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,631
softest little sissy,

1124
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,766
and it'll turn him into
a complete ass loving

1125
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,334
fuckin' animal bro.

1126
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,669
- Teddy, Teddy!

1127
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,373
- Out of your fuckin' mind man?

1128
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,009
- Whoa, calm down sweetie.

1129
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,477
- [Derrick] Teddy's always
trying to get with us,

1130
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,678
we always deny him.

1131
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,946
- Teddy is very
fuckin' aggressive.

1132
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,815
There's not that many gay guys

1133
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,651
to hook up with around here.

1134
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,618
Maybe he finally snapped.

1135
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:36,987
His shit's so backed up now,

1136
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,889
when he bangs a dude,

1137
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,226
he completely destroys
their asshole.

1138
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,496
- Slow down man, slow down.

1139
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,865
I need you to be a
little more sober.

1140
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,700
- Whoa, shit!

1141
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,303
- This shit cute.

1142
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,605
Look at you huh?

1143
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,540
- Hey Blake, what's
going on bro?

1144
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,375
Enjoying the party I see.

1145
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,411
- Yeah yeah I'm lovin' it yo.

1146
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,546
There's a lot of fine ass
ladies in here tonight,

00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:03,446

1148
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,648
- There is, there is,

1149
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,951
I love girls right,
enough bitches to where

1150
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,452
you wouldn't need to go

1151
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:12,389
butt fuckin' a guy 'til he
died or anything like that.

1152
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,026
(clears throat)

1153
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:17,962
- I got somethin'
I wanna show you.

1154
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,096
- Show us?

1155
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,831
- Yeah.

1156
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:22,066
I remember the last time

1157
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,701
I saw you I told you I
was gonna get y'all back

1158
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,036
for leaving me in that
bar by myself right?

1159
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,905
- I don't remember that at all.

1160
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,807
- Well I remember it.

1161
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:33,310
Yeah, I remember it
like it was yesterday.

1162
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,913
But you gonna wish you didn't.

1163
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,982
I'm gonna make y'all
both regret it.

1164
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,117
- Please don't butt
fuck me to death!

1165
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,685
(record scratches)

1166
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,554
- Oh Jesus.

1167
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:46,323
(coughing)

1168
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:47,458
- What the fuck is you guys'

1169
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,627
obsession with butt fuckin' man?

1170
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,962
I just wanted to show
you the fine ass lady

1171
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,564
that I brought, which by the way

1172
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,665
none of you are allowed
to even look at.

1173
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,568
You see they all have
strict instructions

1174
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:01,038
not to even talk to any
of you assholes man.

1175
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,973
- That's it, that's
your revenge?

1176
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:07,077
- Well, thank fucking god.

1177
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:08,812
- What you mean thank god?

1178
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,080
Those are some fine ass
bitches right there.

1179
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,750
You don't think they fine?

1180
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,651

1182
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:15,852
they're fine all right.

1183
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:16,787
- They better be,

1184
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,489
as much as I'm paying for 'em.

1185
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,090
Fuck it I tell you what,

1186
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,326
I'm gonna be banging all
three of 'em tonight,

1187
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,228

1188
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:25,763
- Yeah no, we just thought--

1189
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,798
- Well I just thought
the best way to get you

1190
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,533
assholes back was to
bring the finest ladies

1191
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:31,802
you will have at this party

1192
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,470
and not let you
guys touch 'em huh?

1193
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,006
(angelic choir)

1194
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:42,346
Oh oh oh, hell no Hunter!

1195
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,314
No, you on that list
too mother fucker.

1196
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:49,353
- Well, we can take
him off the list.

1197
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,721
- Yeah.

1198
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:56,160
Derrick, those bitches
are fuckin' fine man.

1199
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,828
Blake got our
asses fucking good.

1200
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,764
He got our asses
fucking good bro.

1201
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,299
- So yeah,

1202
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,469
I'm pretty good friends
with all these guys,

1203
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,838
I mean, I paid for
their first hand job

1204
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,273
when we were kids.

1205
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,375
How do you know them?

1206
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,012
(tense music)

1207
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,448
You don't speak English do you?

1208
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:21,185
(speaking in a foreign language)

1209
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,820
Yeah, of course you don't.

1210
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,955
Why would you be
here if you did?

1211
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,957
- Cunt.

1212
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:32,129
Hey my brother.

1213
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,630

00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,099
How you doin' what's going on?

1215
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,033
- How you feelin' man,

1216
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,000
- Yeah of course of course,

00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,268

1218
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:39,803

Excellent.

00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,808
So I'm setting up

1222
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:47,311

00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,346

00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,121
- So what you

1225
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,490
- I just got myself two 40s.

1226
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,624
- Two 40s huh?

1227
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:01,924
You're ready to rock.

1228
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,360
- Aw hell yeah.

1229
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,728
I got myself two 40s,

1230
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:06,396
and I got myself a condom.

1231
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:09,266
I plan on using all
of them tonight.

1232
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,502
But, like,

1233
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:12,803
I don't know some
of these girls are

1234
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:14,471
just kinda stuck up.

1235
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,074
- You just need something
to spark the convo

1236
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,509
my man.

1237
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,277
- I mean like what?

1238
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,649
- What we have here,

1239
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:29,520
we like to call
Edward Fourtyhands.

1240
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,788
- Oh like the movie.

1241
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,056
- Yes, like the movie Cunter.

1242
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,391
- It's Hunter,

1243
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,426
guys it's Hunter.

1244
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:37,761
- Now the way we
play this game is

1245
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:41,598
you can't do anything
with your hands

1246
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:45,169
until you finish those two 40s.

1247
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:47,571
- That's it?

1248
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,072
- That's it!

1249
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,175
- Well what if I have to
take a piss or something?

1250
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,010
- That's the fun of the game.

1251
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,178
You can't do anything
with your hands

1252
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,612
until your'e done with those.

1253
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,147
- Are you sure this
is gonna make girls

1254
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:57,915
talk to me?

1255
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,116
- I'm sure.

1256
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:00,184
- [Voiceover] Do

1257
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,618
playing Edwards Fourtyhands?

1258
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,720
- See, they're already
talkin' about you.

1259
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,923
- Yeah dude but
that chick was fat.

1260
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,558
- Really dude?

1261
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,927
That's the best
you're gonna do man.

1262

(squishing)

1294
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:24,201
Actually,

1296
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,672
Jangalang, jangalang.

1305
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,770

Chauncey.

1307
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:07,577
You awake?

1308
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,447
Looks like somebody

1309
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,950
had a little too much to drink.

1310
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,852
Yes, it was me.

1311
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,821
But seems like you've
had a bit more.

1312
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,291
(sniffing)

1313
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,828
Oh yes.

1315
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,999
I'll be nice.

1316
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:32,035
I promise to make it special.

1317
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,671
This isn't going to hurt a bit.

1318
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:37,774
I've waited so long for this.

1319
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,011
I promise,

1320
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,246

00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,288
(squishing)

1324
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:54,191
(eerie music)

1325
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,893
(sniffing)

1326
00:49:56,893 --> 00:50:00,297
Oh em gee.

1327
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,032
What the fuck?

1328
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,167
What's going on here?

1329
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,737
- [Voiceover] I could ask
you the same Nancy boy.

1330
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:07,971
- I didn't do this.

1331
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,007
He was like this
when I found him.

1332
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,441
- [Voiceover] But if he wasn't,

1333
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,209
what would you have done?

1334
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,513
- Well honey, that's a
horse of a different color.

1335
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,714
- [Voiceover] Well then now

1336
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,750
you'll have an ass
of a different color.

1337
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,452
(laughing)

1338
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,155
You're no better than they are.

1339
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,890
Act like they would've,

1340
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,725
then you'll die like they died.

1341
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:31,895
Here I come boy.

1342
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:35,165
(loud chainsaw buzzing)

1343
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,535
- Help me!

1344
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,404
- [Voiceover] Can't
take your own medicine?

1345
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:42,639
(screaming)

1346
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,042
Yeah, whoa, there we go.

1347
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,645
(screaming)

1348
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:49,813
Oh yeah.

1349
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:53,984
Burn baby!

1350
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:57,087
(squishing)

1351
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,027
This is getting a little too

1352
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:06,263
corny for my taste.

1353
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,665
(laughing)

1354
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:18,942
(intense dubstep music)

1355
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,615
- Do you wanna go upstairs?

1356
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,149
- [Voiceover] What?

1357
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,919
- Do you wanna go upstairs?

1358
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,220
To my room?

1359
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,187
- Oh.

1360
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,223
(laughing)

1361
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,658
- Yeah.

1362
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,197

1364
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:43,700
- Where do you

1365
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,203
I'm goin' to get it in.

1366
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:48,638
(laughing)

1367
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,574
- It means we're going to fuck.

1368
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,243
- All right I prefer
you stay down here

1369
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,479
so I can keep an eye
on you and watch.

1370
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:58,247
- Wait, you wanna watch?

1371
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:59,783
Kinky.

1372
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,852
How about everyone watch?

1373
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,056
- Nah nah, as nice
as that sounds,

1374
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:09,593
I prefer to keep my
business to myself,

1375
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:10,393
you know what I mean?

1376
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:11,428
- You know what I mean.

1377
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:13,196
- Listen Derrick,

I haven't seen anything weird

1381
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,938

1745
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:18,641
- There's no reason for
this you stupid asshole.

1746
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,575
- [Voiceover] No reason?

1747
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:21,343
Is there any reason for the pain

1748
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:22,945
you inflict on others?

1749
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:23,913
- Others?

1750
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,247

- I never hurt any of them.

1754
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,124

and raping them

1755
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:36,692
isn't hurting them?

1756
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,094
- It doesn't hurt them.

1757
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:39,362

know what happened

and when they do

1759
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,897

1760

1761
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:47,903

1762

think those drugs you use

1763
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:52,975
have any long term
effects on these girls?

1764
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:55,111
- Stop with the
fuckin' lecture dude,

1765
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:56,511
and do what you're gonna do.

1766

hard Hamilton.

1769
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:04,386

shit, asshole.

1770
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:07,189
- [Voiceover] Well
maybe this will help.

1771
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,728
- You.

1772
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:15,131
- Hamilton, I've been
looking all over for you.

1773
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:19,201
- I didn't wanna miss this.

1774
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,836
- What?

1775
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:22,303
- I see you found him Ewing.

1776
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,306
- Sure thanks to you.

1777
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,475
- What the shit
is going on here?

1778
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:28,110
How are you fuckin' anybody?

1779
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,212
And Derrick you fuckin'
know this bitch?

1780
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:31,414
- This bitch?

1781
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:32,615
This bitch?

1782
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:33,582
This bitch

1783
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:36,018
happens to be my girlfriend.

1784
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,688
- Awkward.

1785
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:40,790
- Why is that?

1786
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:42,258
- Come on.

1787
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:43,526
- You're the alpha male,

1788
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,394
please enlighten us great one,

1789
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,062
why would this be awkward huh?

1790
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,665
Why the fuck would
this be awkward!

1791
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:51,867
- I'm not gonna tell you shit.

1792
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:53,102
You're a liar.

1793
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,071
You betrayed me, you
betrayed the wolf pack

1794
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,739
and everything this
group stands for.

1795
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,674
- Everything it stands
for, which is what?

1796
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:03,145
- Tell him.

1797
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:04,380
Tell him what you did,

1798
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,082
tell them what your friends did.

1799
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,049
Tell him what your
wolf pack did.

1800
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:11,053
- God damn it.

1801
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,190
God damn.

1802
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:18,227
