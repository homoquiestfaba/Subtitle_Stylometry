00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,971
          ( Screams )           

2
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,553
         ( Dog barks )          

3
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,426
         ( Text tone )          

4
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,961
          You're texting again? 

5
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,429
        Huh?                    
                     Come on.   

6
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,630
            Put that down       
            and swim with me.   

7
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,332
In the ocean?                   
There's fish out there.         

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,867
            Your loss.          

9
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,669
         ( Text tone )          

10
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,613
    ( Ominous music )           

11
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,189
    Oh, my God. Bree!           

12
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,690
         Bree! Shark!           

13
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,563
    Bree! There's a shark!      

14
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,799
    ( Gasps )                   

15
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,681
Oh, my God! Would somebody      
help her, please?               

16
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,318
There's a shark! Bree!          
Shark! Oh, my God.              

17
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,476
          ( Roaring )           

18
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,951
                Oh, my God.     
                Are you okay?   

19
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,452
                  Are you okay? 

20
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,754
What just happened?             
              There was a shark.

21
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,656
Oh, my God.                     

22
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:57,736
SANDS: Welcome to Blue Water.   

23
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,972
  This better be good, Sands.   

24
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,007
     I stood up an admiral      
     to be here.                

25
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,344
  Trust me, Commander.          
  You're gonna want to see this.

26
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,116
What are we looking at here?    

27
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,452
              S-11's been fitted
              with cameras.     

28
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,355
        We received these images
        ten minutes ago.        

29
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,491
            My God.             

30
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,526
    Very National Geographic,   
    isn't it?                   

31
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,063
                 Freeze it.     

32
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,100
              See? He got away. 

33
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,068
 Why didn't S-11 go after it?   

34
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,805
 Because we jerked it's leash.  
 We told it to behave.          

35
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,540
          Come again?           

36
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:40,879
Like a shark-- let me let       
my daughter explain.            

37
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,149
  Like a shark, S-11 can sense  
  electrical impulses           

38
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,218
        helping it navigate.    

39
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,621
    We manipulate its ability   
    by transmitting focus       

40
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,658
        to electrical charges,  
        to a series of receptors

41
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,594
             implanted in S-11's
             cerebral cortex.   

42
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,496
I have no idea                  
what she just said.             

43
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,198
S-11 is now totally             
under our control.              

44
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:04,002
Blue Water Corp. has just       
created the Navy's next         
super weapon.                   

45
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,741
            Sands, crafty S.O.B.
            You did it.         

46
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,911
  Was there any doubt?          
  Baby girl, bring S-11 home.   

47
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:34,399
         Sir, we've got S-11    
         on an intercept path of
         a fast moving vessel.  

48
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,701
    Change course.              

49
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,903
         No, take it in closer. 

50
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,404
Commander, the swimmer was      
a chance encounter.             

51
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,840
S-11 still needs more testing.  

52
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,710
  I procured millions of dollars
  of taxpayer money to develop  
  that thing.                   

53
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,212
 Before Blue Water gets one more
 cent, I better see it perform. 

54
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,114
But the external interface      
is a prototype.                 

55
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,183
 If something were to happen--  

56
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,985
      What did you have in mind,
      Commander?                

57
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,621
     S-11 was designed to go    
     where the Navy can't right?

58
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,156
     Sneak into hostile waters, 

59
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,158
          hunt down drug runners
          and pirate vessels.   

60
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:03,161
      So you want us to treat   
      that craft like the enemy?

61
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,099
        Move in tight and pursue
        without being seen.     

62
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,433
Dad?                            

63
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,469
    Make me proud, pumpkin.     

64
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,204
    I told you to stop          
    calling me that.            

65
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,539
    Make me proud, Nicole.      

66
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,817
                      Yeah, man!
                      (Laughs ) 

67
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,704
        You can breathe now.    

68
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,751
    ( Loud snap, fizzling )     

69
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,787
      Whoa! What is that?       

70
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,021
         ( Both yell )          

71
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,064
    What's going on?            

72
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,066
     S-11 isn't responding      
     to command.                

73
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,202
 The propeller must've damaged  
 the external interface.        

74
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,438
I told you it wasn't ready      
for adverse conditions.         

75
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,174
      Get the system back       
      on line, now.             

76
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,610
    It's not working.           

77
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:26,912
 I'm engaging the kill switch.  

78
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,981
         ( Charging )           

79
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,283
              In three...       

80
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,152
            two...              

81
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,320
                  one.          

82
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,256
    It's too late, Nicole.      

83
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,558
                 Look.          

84
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,999
            Oh, my God.         

85
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,568
      What just happened?       

86
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,840
         S-11 escaped.          

87
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,108
          ( Exhales )           

88
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,084
    ( Gulls calling )           

89
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,259
So, you ever see anybody fall   
off one of these things?        

90
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,194
    Fall? Nah.                  

91
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,997
    I seen a guy                
    jump once though.           

92
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:23,101
Wife left him so he took        
a nose dive from 60 floors up.  

93
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,603
            That's horrible.    

94
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,705
It's so bad. Close your eyes.   

95
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,741
Close your eyes.                
Feel the wind in your hair.     

96
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,211
Splat!                          

97
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,249
( Laughs )                      
It's all over with.             

98
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,117
I can think of worse            
ways to go anyhow.              

99
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,552
                     Like what? 

100
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,088
Like falling face first         
in a French fryer.              

101
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,956
( Sizzles )                     

102
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:50,562
    Thanks. I'll have that      
    image in my head all day.   

103
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,430
How about getting jammed        
into a wood chipper?            

104
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,134
        Whoa.                   

105
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,974
Oh, no! Not like this!          

106
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,144
    ( Screams )                 

107
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,051
    Signals from the tracking   
    implant are fading,         

108
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,686
        but it looks like S-11's
        heading south.          

109
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,622
    Commander.                  

110
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,692
         You just unleashed an  
         eight-legged man-eating
         shark on the world.    

111
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,394
A minor setback.                

112
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,195
     If you're thinking of going
     back into that lab,        

113
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,031
    and creating a new freak,   
    forget it.                  

114
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,533
I'm cutting off all Blue Water  
funding until you get S-11 back.

115
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:32,404
        You fail, and that's    
        not all I'll cut off.   

116
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,839
    Relax, Commander.           
    We'll get S-11.             

117
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,342
Even if we have to go           
to the ends of the Earth.       

118
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,421
Okay, telemetry shows           
he's heading to Mexico.         

119
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,356
Let's get a team                
down there now.                 

120
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,566
         Any changes?           

121
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,167
                Hard to say.    

122
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,469
             The tracking       
             implant was damaged

123
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,471
            when S-11 ripped off
            its control plate.  

124
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,206
    But we're still receiving   
    ghost signals               

125
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,174
      indicating S-11's presence
      in the coastal waters.    

126
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,943
Can we pinpoint its location?   

127
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,012
        Not exactly, Dr. Sands. 

128
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,546
              But S-11 is here, 

129
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,515
        and for some reason     
        it's sticking around.   

130
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,617
        Migratory instincts.    

131
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:57,055
      It'll feed along the coast
      a few days then move on.  

132
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,625
                This is it, sir.
    We're here?                 

133
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,166
I chartered us more craft.      
Two for the recovery mission.   

134
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,434
            A fast one, I hope. 

135
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,102
It will do the job, sir.        
                         Good.  

136
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,772
Sir, I think we should also     
contact Andy Flynn.             

137
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,474
                    Flynn?      

138
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,309
        He's here in Mexico?    

139
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,145
Since you let him go            
two years ago.                  

140
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,381
    I didn't let him go, Santos.
    I fired his ass.            

141
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,051
     'Cause he demanded a raise,
     a big one.                 

142
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,952
He's a greedy bastard,          
no doubt.                       

143
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,354
But he knows these waters       
better than anyone.             

144
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,856
And he knows what               
we're up against.               

145
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:37,095
If you want S-11 back,          
Andy Flynn is your best shot.   

146
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,565
                      Ah.       

147
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,833
                 All right.     
                 Find him.      

148
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,075
    ( Background chatter )      

149
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,201
            Who's ready for some
            tequila ball?       

150
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,475
( Speaking Spanish )            
                     You missed!

151
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,243
              Let's go, ladies. 

152
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,282
                  There you go. 

153
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,219
      Andy Flynn. Still drinking
      their vodka, huh?         

154
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:37,055
  Santos! What's up, brother?   

155
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,225
What're you doing here?         
                Looking for you.

156
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,826
            No, you didn't.     

157
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,328
     Blue Water wants you back. 

158
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,930
Not a chance, man.              
Not a chance.                   

159
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,332
      If it's about the money-- 

160
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,768
Look, it's always               
about the money. All right?     

161
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,703
That idiot Sands,               
he won't pay me what I'm worth. 

162
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,805
So, I'm retired.                

163
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,908
        Not any more, amigo.    

164
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,811
                  S-11 escaped. 

165
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,852
( Metal detector beeps )        

166
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,102
    ( Detects metal )           

167
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,301
             ( Gasps, screams ) 

168
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,504
                 Please help me!
                 Please! No!    

169
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:03,808
                 Please! Please!
                 ( Screams )    

170
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,353
          ( Screams )           

171
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,557
    SANDS: Hey, Guys.           

172
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:56,027
So glad you could join us,      
Mr. Flynn.                      

173
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,062
     Do we have a location?     
No.                             

174
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,365
But like an octopus,            
he's very territorial.          

175
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,933
They won't stray far.           

176
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,135
You understand you are to       
capture S-11,                   

177
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,870
not terminate it, right?        

178
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,338
    Well, your fish might       
    have other ideas.           

179
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,910
    S-11 can be controlled,     
    Mr. Flynn.                  

180
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,678
    Let me show you.            

181
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,989
We call these interface darts.  

182
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:29,193
Once attached, I can access     
S-11's higher implants          
with my computer,               

183
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,029
allowing me to direct           
its movements.                  

184
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,865
      Like a remote control toy.
      Sounds easy.              

185
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,199
It won't be easy, believe me.   

186
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,302
First, we have                  
to tranquilize S-11.            

187
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,871
That'll make him docile.        

188
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,606
    And then he won't           
    resist commands.            

189
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,408
The tranqs will bring S-11      
to the surface,                 

190
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,410
    and then we can hit it      
    with the interface dart.    

191
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,912
Why don't we just nail it       
  underwater with your dart?    

192
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,081
They're more accurate           
if shot from a grenade launcher.

193
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,618
And since we only have          
two darts, accuracy is key.     

194
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,987
Once I establish a link,        
I can then navigate S-11        

195
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,522
to open waters                  
and our techs on the yacht      

196
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,525
    will be able to             
    fix the interface.          

197
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,694
    So, what do you say?        
    You game?                   

198
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:07,498
      Yeah. 100 grand, 200 more 
      upon completion, why not? 

199
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,568
You think a great deal of       
yourself, don't you, Flynn?     

200
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,538
Yeah, you know what I think?    

201
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,140
I think you're                  
a money-grubbing Neanderthal.   

202
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,076
And the word on you is,         

203
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:24,182
you like cheap women            
and cheaper booze. That right?  

204
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,085
         300 grand, or I go back
         to the pool.           

205
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,421
    Fine, 300 grand.            

206
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,690
     But only if you bring      
     S-11 back alive.           

207
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,559
  Otherwise, you get nothing.   

208
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,928
     This is a bad idea, Sands. 

209
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,598
 We should just 86 that freak   
 before it takes any more lives.

210
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,668
That freak represents a giant   
leap in genetic engineering.    

211
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,437
Damage it, and head will roll,  
Mr. Flynn.                      

212
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,340
Yours will be first.            

213
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,379
  Fine. Get your stuff ready.   

214
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,880
    We're going to the boat.    

215
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,483
        Santos and I will       
        meet you at the dock.   

216
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,064
 <i>Donde esta Senor Kingsberry?</i>   

217
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,586
              Ay, yi, yi.       

218
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,598
                        Classy. 

219
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,267
          You Kingsberry?       

220
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,070
Well, the locals call me Pez.   

221
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,871
What can I do for you, angel?   

222
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:58,309
        First, Pez, you can     
        stop staring at my rack.

223
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,745
        They're just boobs.     
        They're not gonna get up
        and dance or anything.  

224
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,214
                      Second... 

225
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,384
    you can tell me about this. 

226
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,619
      How'd you find me?        

227
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,822
            It's what I do.     
            I'm Stacy Everheart.

228
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,357
    An investigative reporter   
    with CNE.                   

229
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,659
             And this is        
             my cameraman Bones.

230
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:15,693
    Hey, buddy.                 

231
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,131
        You sent that to our    
        station two days ago.   

232
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,900
It-- it was a joke.             

233
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,669
                        A joke. 

234
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:25,636
         That's right.          

235
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:26,838
Oh, we like jokes.              

236
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:31,375
Sorry to waste your time.       

237
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,443
        You're lying.           

238
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,681
              A creature fitting
              this description  

239
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,950
        was sighted just last   
        week in California.     

240
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,385
        Now it's in Vallarta,   
        and you've seen it.     

241
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,322
Well I wish to                  
the devil I hadn't.             

242
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:48,226
I can't close my eyes           
without imagining that--        

243
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,995
that thing squirming            
towards me.                     

244
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:55,433
It's gotten so bad,             
I can't take my boat out.       

245
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,140
No, I'm done with that thing.   

246
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,509
There's nothing you can--       

247
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,415
What do you wanna know?         

248
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:15,686
                I'll bite, Pez. 

249
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,422
    Can we stop?                

250
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,659
Come on. We gotta burn off those
enchiladas from last night.     

251
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,829
        But we're on vacation   
        and it's Mexico.        

252
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,331
    I think it's against        
    the law to jog in Mexico.   

253
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,467
Fine. You're gonna have to      
save your breath anyway.        

254
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,902
You'll be screaming             
your lungs out soon.            

255
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,537
                     Wait. Why? 

256
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,506
Two words: Bungee jumping.      

257
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,841
I found a great spot            
over the ocean.                 

258
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,442
                  So not funny. 

259
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,911
             You know I'm afraid
             of heights.        

260
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,679
Gonna have to get over that     
sooner or later.                

261
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,215
Today's the day.                

262
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,983
All right, tell you what.       

263
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,953
Do this, spend the rest         
of the day at the spa.          

264
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,088
                  Mud baths.    
                  Seaweed wraps?

265
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,925
        Sure.                   
                Okay, you're on.

266
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,771
        ( Yells )               

267
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,719
         ( Laughing )           

268
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:25,623
                     Yes! Nice! 

269
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,391
        Babe, that was awesome. 

270
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,560
I can't believe I did it!       

271
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,995
    Who's afraid of             
    heights now, huh?           

272
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,130
                    Not my girl.
Wait, I wanna go again.         

273
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,432
            Wild child.         

274
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,838
            Vamos!              

275
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,574
        ( Yells )               

276
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,378
        ( Laughs )              
        Whoo!                   

277
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,721
    ( Growls )                  

278
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,969
It's gonna be like              
old times, Santos.              

279
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,005
Yep.                            
It's gonna be like old times.   

280
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,610
             She's got a sexy   
             little brain going,

281
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:20,745
          you ever notice that? 

282
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,346
Don't even think it, Bro.       

283
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,881
             Oh, what? I'm just 
             gonna talk to her. 

284
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,583
I heard that before,            
Remember in Cairo?              

285
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,984
The lady snake charmer          
with cobras?                    

286
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,653
                Cairo, come on. 

287
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,821
My level check went black,      
Flynn. Almost fell off.         

288
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:35,026
So, you miss me?                
                      Excuse me?

289
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,696
  You might've noticed I took a 
  little hiatus from Blue Water.

290
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:42,199
            By hiatus, you mean 
            my father fired you.

291
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:45,636
 Yeah. I did notice, Mr. Flynn. 

292
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:49,340
      Look, call me Andy.       

293
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,710
 Oh, all right.                 
 Let's just get this over with  

294
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,845
  so I can get back to work.    

295
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:58,482
    Give me your best line.     

296
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,086
        Okay. Um, here.         

297
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,257
             What?              

298
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,758
     Souvenir from Bagdad.      

299
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,928
Piece of shrapnel from an IED.  

300
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,198
Went in back here, played       
  ping-pong with my insides.    

301
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,334
    If it weren't for           
      Santos over there,        

302
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,903
      I probably wouldn't       
      have made it.             

303
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,072
    So I have him to blame.     

304
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,240
Look, I remember you too,       
Nicole, all right?              

305
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,710
     Spent your whole life      
     in that lab.               

306
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,312
    First one there,            
    last one to leave.          

307
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,047
    And I get it.               
    That was me once.           

308
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,216
    My whole life was work.     

309
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,952
  Thanks to this little guy,    

310
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,955
      it looked like there      
      was no tomorrow.          

311
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,826
      So, that's my line.       

312
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,061
What do you think?              

313
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:50,167
  Being first in the lab        
  earned me a doctorate from MIT

314
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,838
     and made me one of the best
     biomechanical engineers    
     in the country.            

315
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:57,675
         I care about what I do,
         Mr. Flynn.             

316
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:02,780
As for you, you're a mercenary. 

317
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,884
              That says it all. 

318
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,953
          Hmm. Okay.            

319
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,229
         That smooth savvy, huh?
 Oh, shut up.                   

320
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,078
     ( Techno pop plays )       

321
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,788
Okay, if that didn't get        
your booty shaking,             

322
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:44,989
have somebody check             
your pulse,                     

323
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,657
'cause you might be dead.       

324
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,026
I'm Captain Jack                
and this is PV Pirate Radio,    

325
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,128
the spring break destination.   

326
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,797
Just in case they're listening, 

327
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,666
I wanted to give a special      
shout out to the FCC,           

328
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,803
'cause those are the boys who   
kicked my ass out of America.   

329
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,005
And boys, you have              
doomed me to a life             

330
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,973
filled with sandy               
beautiful beaches,              

331
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:07,278
smoking hot senoritas           
and ice cold pina coladas.      

332
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,979
You sure taught me a lesson.    

333
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,815
Folks, I may never              
leave here.                     

334
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:14,218
( Shuts off mic )               
God, I hate it here.            

335
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,719
You're kidding me, right?       

336
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,087
 I mean this place is amazing.  

337
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,255
        Yeah, whatever.         

338
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,090
  And what is it with all this? 

339
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,059
            What do you call it?
         Sunshine?              

340
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,762
                 Yes. Sunshine. 

341
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,996
        Enough with the         
        freaking sun already.   

342
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,965
         ( Text tone )          
                  It's annoying.

343
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,934
          What do you got here? 

344
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,703
Tell you in a sec.              
You are live in five.           

345
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,008
             Hey, party people, 
             it's Captain Jack. 

346
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,277
        And you are listening   
        to PV Pirate Radio.     

347
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:43,147
First mate Stephie has just     
handed me some breaking news.   

348
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:47,351
Apparently a half shark,        
half octopus has been sighted   

349
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,454
        off the coast two miles 
        south of Playa Del Sol. 

350
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,591
      According to sources,     
      it is armed and dangerous.

351
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,726
        Yes, it's half octopus. 

352
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:56,760
         It'd be eight-armed and
         dangerous, right?      

353
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,429
        Oh.                     

354
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,965
Stephanie apparently is hitting 
the tequila a little early today

355
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,133
     and she's not sharing      
     with her captain.          

356
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,072
I always share with you.        

357
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,007
     Yeah. So what is this,     
     Stephae?                   

358
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,676
    This some mad experiment    
    gone horribly wrong?        

359
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,078
Maybe they're doing a movie.    

360
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,246
     Oh, yeah.                  
     I could see that now.      

361
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:18,649
    A former Navy Seal slash    
    oceanographer               

362
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,050
    is tracking down            
    this abomination            

363
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,752
before it takes any more lives. 

364
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,188
    I'd watch it.               

365
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,856
    Yeah, I know you would,     
    Stephanie.                  

366
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,325
     That's because you're      
     easily amused.             

367
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,262
      I've seen you mesmerized  
      watching a frozen burrito 

368
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,797
    rotate in a microwave oven. 

369
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,799
    Let's get back to the music,
    shall we?                   

370
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,469
         Coming up next,        
         it's the Cheetah Horse,

371
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,403
Very hot band out               
of New York City.               

372
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,038
Here is their latest hit.       

373
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,740
     It's called                
     "Hot Rod Hell Kitten."     

374
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:43,974
             Meow.              

375
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,010
    ( Starts music )            

376
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,112

a shark at first,               

419

        Look, even I know sharks
        aren't serial killers.  

507
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,993
  Okay? They kill for a purpose.
  And Octopi?                   

508
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,295
        Pfft. Smart as hell.    

509
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,665
And not to mention stealthy.    

510
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,433
         Okay, so they're not   
         gonna expose themselves

511
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,168
    unless they've got a damn   
    good reason not to.         

512
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,137
Maybe our neural implants       
are damaging                    

513
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,272
the impulse controls            
in S-11's brain.                

514
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,641
    Or maybe your father did    
    something to that freak.    

515
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,243
            Something you       
            don't know about.   

516
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,745
You know, a little gene splicing
behind closed doors?            

517
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,647
No, he wouldn't do that.        

518
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,316
Not without consulting          
me first.                       

519
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,551
My father is a man of science.  

520
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,386
      How 'bout you tell that   
      to the dead guy out there?

521
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,355
What's that supposed to mean?   

522
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,691
  It means that I think your dad
  intended S-11 to succeed      

523
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,226
                  at all costs. 

524
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,261
Blue Water didn't hire          
you to think.                   

525
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,797
Hired you to do a job.          

526
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,032
And if you can't do it,         
we'll find someone who can.     

527
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:53,083
          Get Tom on the phone. 

528
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,352
        Look, I don't care      
        if he's in a meeting.   

529
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,255
    Tell him Stacy Everheart    
    wants to talk to him now.   

530
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,956
          Thank you.            

531
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,093
            Yup. I'm watching   
            the recap right now.

532
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,228
    So what'd the networks say? 

533
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:08,265
      <i>TOM: Dan Everett is</i>       
      <i>replacing you, Stacy.</i>     

534
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,233
          - What?               
          - <i>I'm sorry.</i>          

535
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,668
     <i>But that's the</i>             
     <i>decision they've made.</i>     

536
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,136
    But it's my story.          

537
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,738
          Hey, Stacy!           

538
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,540
   <i>TOM: I hope you understand,</i>  
   <i>all right?</i>                   

539
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,576
    No. I understand.           

540
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,445
        Fine.                   
        ( Hangs up )            

541
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,447
Rat bastards are sending in     

542
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,815
another reporter                
to take the lead.               

543
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:26,883
                What?           

544
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,552
What is this?                   

545
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,353
             Pez figured out the
             places of attacks. 

546
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,888
    Show me.                    

547
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,558
          This is where I first 
          spotted the creature, 

548
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,260
            this was the attack 
            on the bungee tower,

549
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,462
         and this was the attack
         on the resort.         

550
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,098
So it's sticking                
to the coast heading south.     
                        Yeah.   

551
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,466
What are we supposed to do?     

552
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,402
Just head south and             
hope we run into it?            

553
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,837
  Worth a shot, and maybe we    
  can get some more footage.    

554
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,273
Then the network would have     
to make us the leads.           

555
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:55,645
You know, I bet we could cover  
a lot more miles by boat.       

556
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,650
    Fine. But you're gonna      
    double my salary,           

557
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,652
          and you're gonna      
          pay for my car.       

558
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,155
Oh, Pez, I could just           
hug you right now.              

559
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,390
I mean, if you were better      
looking and had better hygiene. 

560
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,695
Oh, what the hell.              

561
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,166
                Pez!            

562
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,602
                Sorry.          

563
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:29,512
Lock and load, boys.            
Time to get wet.                

564
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,181
( Shuts off engine )            

565
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,817
Oh, you got the helm, brother.  

566
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,619
You better watch                
your back down there.           

567
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,554
            No, watching my back
            is your job.        

568
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,656
I don't know.                   
Am I in your will?              

569
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:40,757
                You get my dog. 

570
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,225
You don't have a dog.           

571
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,893
Ah. ( Laughs )                  

572
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,697
Hey, remember. My dad doesn't   
want S-11 harmed, all right?    

573
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,899
          And we always do what 
          daddy says, don't we? 

574
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,802
             Relax, I've got 300
             thousand reasons   

575
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,704
             to bring that thing
             back in one piece. 

576
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,942
 We stick to the plan, tranq it,
 force it to the surface,       

577
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,380
     then Santos shoots it with 
     your remote control gizmo, 

578
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:07,217
          and you guys jockey it
          back to your yacht,   

579
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,853
     if your gear really works. 

580
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,588
Yeah, it does work.             

581
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,490
So make sure you don't miss.    

582
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,525
             I haven't yet.     

583
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,605
             Now I'm ready.     
             Patch him in.      

584
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,375
 <i>Guess what I</i>                   
 <i>just saw on CNE?</i>               

585
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,779
    S-11 looks impressive on TV,
    doesn't he, Commander?      

586
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,514
Are you drinking?               

587
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,883
            Yes, I am.          
            Scotch.             

588
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,418
                   <i>Good scotch.</i> 

589
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,652
        Dammit, Sands.          

590
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,220
You said you could handle this. 

591
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,255
 Listen, if you can't handle--  

592
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,023
     No, Commander, you listen. 

593
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,326
       <i>The Navy said they wanted</i>
       <i>a killing machine.</i>       

594
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,528
            That's exactly      
            what I gave them.   

595
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:55,965
          And yes, the civilian 
          deaths are a tragedy. 

596
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,601
 But greatness comes at a price.
 It always has.                 

597
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:02,472
 Just capture that freak before 
 it shows up on TV again.       

598
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,475
  If the media links this       
  to the Navy, we're screwed.   

599
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:06,576
        Don't worry, Commander. 

600
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,478
    I've got my best man on it. 

601
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:10,774
          Don't worry. Flynn can
          take care of himself. 

602
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,576
Worried?                        
Why would I be worried?         

603
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,912
         No reason.             
Hey, do me a favor.             

604
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,516
Stay out of my business         
and focus on the shooting.      

605
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,050
All right?                      

606
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,318
          Yes, ma'am.           

607
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:35,398
    ( Ominous music )           

608
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,366
          ( Growls )            

609
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,554
             What is that?      

610
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:32,989
    Ink.                        

611
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,624
                  Oh, God, no.  

612
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,767
          ( Groans )            

613
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:15,732
            Santos!             

614
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,568
     He's right behind me.      

615
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:22,805
FLYNN: He caught me in the leg. 

616
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,807
Did you try and kill it?        
                No.             

617
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,676
It pulled it out of it's hide.  

618
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:27,810
    What about the others?      

619
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,312
         They're gone.          

620
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,413
         They're dead.          

621
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,924
So what makes you think         
we'll spot it out here?         

622
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:44,794
 I don't know, but if you've got
 a better idea, I'm all ears.   

623
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,130
No, no, you're the captain.     

624
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,432
Nice yacht, by the way.         

625
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,467
                      Bite me.  

626
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,409
             ( Groans )         

627
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:12,488
What do you think?              
Two or three stitches?          

628
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,290
            This is nothing.    

629
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,926
             Remember that go-go
             dancer in Bangkok? 

630
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,562
     Crazy chick nearly bit

          Dad, S-11 is a killer,
          and they're random.

654
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,749
     I had the tech boys        
     make some adjustments      

655
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,417
    to S-11's subroutines.

We needed a killer.

667
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,350

              worked at the DMV.

758
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:53,776
    Do you feel nothing, Stacy? 

759
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:57,179
     That guy was killed right  
     in front of us inches away.

760
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:58,681
         Inches away!           

761
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:03,519
          Gosh. He was kind     
          of nice guy, you know?

762
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:06,322
        Smell a little funky,   
        but he was okay.        

763
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,224
            Now he's dead.      

764
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,793
And that's tragic truly.        

765
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,929
But the story of a lifetime     
is right out that door.         

766
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:15,798
And we can find it              
thanks to Pez's map!            

767
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:16,899
              No.               

768
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,834
      Oh, come on, Bones.       

769
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,903
    He would've wanted          
    it this way.                

770
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:25,441
Don't let his                   
death mean nothing.             

771
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,810
    You are so full of crap.    

772
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,045
I know, but you're              
coming with me anyway.          

773
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,649
                      Hell not. 

774
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,895
Your father did what?           

775
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:49,298
  Altered S-11's neural implants
  disrupting serotonin levels.  

776
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,468
     Making it more aggressive. 

777
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,470
That explains                   
all the random attacks.         

778
00:52:56,907 --> 00:53:00,943
You know what I gave up to be my
dad's perfect little scientist? 

779
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,580
        Then he goes and does   
        this behind my back.    

780
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,081
I'm sorry, Nicole.              

781
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,655
      What can I say?           
      That's my dad. I love him.

782
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,891
        ( Sonar beeps )         
        Flynn!                  

783
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,693
        It's the tracking device
        on my computer.         

784
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,662
                S-11's near.    

785
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,511
      Do you mind telling       
      us the plan?              

786
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,813
      We've been one step       
      behind that freak all day.

787
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,082
            Time to cut it off. 

788
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,156
         ( Text tone )          

789
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:52,695
You aren't gonna believe this.  

790
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,396
What?                           

791
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,532
        ( Sighs )               

792
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,336
 You're finally ready to admit  
 you're attracted to me?        

793
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,238
Thank God. The sexual           
tension was unbearable.         

794
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,907
        Ew. Gross. God. You?    

795
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,842
All right, easy.                

796
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,377
A simple no                     
would've sufficed.              

797
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,379
The Captain has feelings,       
you know?                       

798
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,914
 All right, Jack,               
 there has been another sighting

799
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:13,716
        of this creature and now
        supposedly              

800
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:15,217
  CNE is running footage of it. 

801
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:16,952
    Really. Wow.                

802
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,721
How gullible do                 
you think I am?                 

803
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,756
        Look, this isn't a joke.
        I swear.                

804
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,891
              Just, please,     
              warn the audience.

805
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,494
     Okay, I'll warn them.      

806
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:28,063
Attention all hands.            
This is your Captain speaking.  

807
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:30,733
We're getting more reports      
about this half shark,          

808
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,369
half octopus creature           
that's terrorizing the coast.   

809
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,803
But please do not panic.        

810
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:37,306
There is a way                  
we can stop this thing.         

811
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,875
Virgin sacrifices.              

812
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,577
Yes, the Mexican Fish           
and Game Commission             

813
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,812
    assures me, the only way    
    to appease this beast       

814
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,515
is to offer it                  
a beautiful virgin.             

815
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,851
Preferably,                     
18 to 25 years old.             

816
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,520
 I repeat!                      
 Sharktopus wants our virgins!  

817
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,890
So, all prospective candidates  
please email me your photos,    

818
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,959
    preferably nudes,           
    to Captain Jack             

819
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,994
     at pvpirateradio.com.      

820
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:03,065
I wish there was another way,   
I'm sorry.This is our only hope.

821
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,867
Damn you, Sharktopus!           

822
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,802
        ( Laughs )              

823
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,804
  ( Switches music back on )    

824
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,573
Oh, what?                       
Don't look at me like that.     

825
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,585
How can you                     
live with yourself?             

826
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,887
So you're not punking me        
on this thing?                  

827
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,689
                    No.         

828
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:29,758
Stephie, this has to be         
a hoax, okay? It's gotta be.    

829
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:33,862
There's no way a shark-octopus  
fishy thingy really exists.     

830
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,065
    Well I hope you're right.   
Trust me, okay?                 

831
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:39,468
There is no such thing          
as a Sharktopus.                

832
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:40,769
            ( Screams )         

833
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,405
          ( Yelling )           

834
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:44,873
          ( Growls )            

835
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,975
    ( Scream echoes )           

836
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,582
                Gotta love these
                Mexican roads.  

837
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,451
                  Where are we? 

838
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,786
Please. Just keep your          
eyes on the road.               

839
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:01,357
Driving with you, you kill us   
before Sharktopus does.         

840
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,642
        ( Reel spins )          

841
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,412
Honey, why don't we go          
back to the resort?             

842
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,647
    Not until I hook a fish.    

843
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,651
         You still worried about
         that shark we saw?     

844
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,520
    It wasn't a shark.          

845
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,590
      Look, babe, relax.        
    It's a big ocean.           

846
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:38,694
No matter what it was,          
we're not gonna see it again.   

847
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,003
    ( Light splash )            

848
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,586
            ( Whistles )        

849
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,559
         What are we doing here?
         We're two miles off    
         the last signal.       

850
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,428
        Check your map.         

851
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,663
You'll notice the distance      
between the S-11's attacks      

852
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:17,065
are nearly equal.               

853
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:18,734
How did you figure this out?    

854
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:22,304
Back at Los Arcos.              
I wasn't sure.                  

855
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:23,705
    And now you are?            

856
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,874
 Nope, but I'm sick and tired   

857
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,743
      of chasing the freak      
      around all day,           

858
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:30,979
    so, if I'm right,           
    it'll come to us.           

859
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,515
          You're in no condition
          for diving.           

860
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,683
I wasn't planning on it.        

861
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,118
We can lure S-11 to the surface 

862
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,619
without using the tranqs.       

863
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,354
    And how do we do that?      

864
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,029
                         Ugh.   
      What?                     

865
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:49,832
        Ever see five gallons   
        of fish guts before?    

866
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:08,350
         ( Reel spins )         
                          Whoa! 

867
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,753
                     Come here. 

868
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,489
Good! Did you get a fish?       

869
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:16,725
                    Come on.    

870
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:18,627
                      ( Grunts )
                      Come on!  

871
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:20,896
                    Come on.    

872
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,664
              Come on. Come on! 

873
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,501
                     ( Grunts ) 

874
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:28,036
            Ha ha!              
            Ha ha ha!           

875
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:29,571
                    Got you.    

876
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:30,906
                I can't believe 
                you bought that.

877
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,708
    Estupido!                   
            Oh, estupido?       

878
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,510
        How about now?          
        How 'bout now, honey?   

879
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:35,878
No! No!

          late to the party.    

1141
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:52,987
      I've got no bullets left  
      and we're out of grenades.

1142
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:55,022
You could use this.             

1143
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,891
Nicole, we're past that.        

1144
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,325
             Wait. Hear me out. 

1145
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:00,427
        S-11 has a kill switch. 

1146
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:02,396
Explosives laced into           
its neural implants.            

1147
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,132
But the switch became inoperable
when S-11 was damaged.          

1148
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,267
          Then what good is it? 

1149
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:09,003
    My dad.                     

1150
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,437
I think he was trying           
to tell me something.           

1151
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:14,108
I think I can access the kill   
switch from my computer.        

1152
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,177
Bones. Bones.                   

1153
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:17,611
- What?                         
- I think it's over there.      

1154
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,446
Come on, let's go.              

1155
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:22,016
But only if we establish a link 
with the interface dart.        

1156
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:25,152
We're gonna blow up             
S-11's brains.                  

1157
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:28,455
But we can only establish a link
if we get close enough          

1158
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:31,225
to the interface dart           
and S-11.                       

1159
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:34,195
    Okay. So in other words,    
    what you're trying to say is

1160
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:37,131
 that I've gotta tag that mother
 with an interface dart,        

1161
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:38,933
and you gotta be close enough   
to blow it to hell?             

1162
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,235
    Yeah.                       

1163
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:45,172
It's the plan.                  

1164
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,440
        Better than no plan.    

1165
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:52,179
Please help me find my son!     
He's missing!                   

1166
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:53,948
Calm down. What's his name?     

1167
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,516

1168
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:56,917
                     I got him. 
                     Stay here. 

1169
01:20:56,985 --> 01:21:00,421
