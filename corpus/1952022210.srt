1
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,539
Where are you taking me?
Where am I?

2
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,840
- I don't know. I'm blindfolded too.
- Davis!

3
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,813
- I'm just kidding. We're almost there.
- Almost where?

4
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,907
You are so nuts!

5
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,501
We're here.

6
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,380
What is this?

7
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:10,013
- Will you marry me?
- What?

8
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,956
Becky, I have loved you
since the 9th grade. Marry me.

9
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,528
You bought this house?

10
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,530
Bought it?
I'm an architect!

11
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,828
I designed it!
I built it!

12
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,700
You built this house...
for me?

13
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,467
For us.

14
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,408
- You are so nuts!
- And you are so sane. It's perfect!

15
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,275
This is like something
out of a fairy tale.

16
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,440
So, will you?

17
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,610
No.

18
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:57,666
I now dedicate this building
to the great city of Boston.

19
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,797
Bravo.

20
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:04,070
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

21
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,077
Thank you so much.

22
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,909
Thank you, Frank.

23
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,444
Gentlemen, welcome to the Budapest.

24
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,853
Drink up.
Everybody, more champagne.

25
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,621
Welcome to the Budapest.
Haven't seen you in a long time.

26
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:25,130
Welcome to the Budapest.
Have a great time.

27
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,807
Ah, Mr. Moseby, welcome
to The Cafe Budapest.

28
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:42,211
I still think it's a boring building,
no matter how you look at it.

29
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,309
The absolute best thing about this
building, in two words, "billable hours."

30
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,752
- But did you enjoy doing it? Whoa.
- That didn't factor in.

31
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,789
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Okay, okay.

32
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,848
- Where are you from?
- Eh?

33
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,859
Where are you from?

34
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,725
- Are you from Hungary?
- Yes, Hungary.

35
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,265
- He wants to know if you speak English.
- Uh?

36
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,626
- He said,
"Are you ticklish? Do you spank?"

37
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:03,135
Marty!

38
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,104
Gwen is
to be called Gwen.

39
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,140
Go, go, go. Work, work, work.

40
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,801
Enjoy the party, gentlemen.
Enjoy the party.

41
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,004
- She liked you.
- What are you talking about?

42
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,412
She could have liked you.
You just gotta make it happen, Davis.

43
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,713
- Hi, Davis.
- Hi, Mr. Calvin.

44
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,720
Becky is over.
That was months ago.

45
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,256
- You've gotta find a way to transcend.
- Yeah, but how?

46
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,158
- Get laid.
- Marty, you're my most disgusting friend.

47
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,752
How about Denise?
What about Patricia?

48
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,424
- I know she had the hots for you.
- What are the hots?

49
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,458
Moseby, eleven o'clock.

50
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,098
Hi, Mr. Moseby. Congratulations
on another beautiful job.

51
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,368
- Thank you, Marty.
Everyone has a right to feel proud.

52
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:45,167
Absolutely.

53
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,111
I don't know if it's the champagne
talking or not, but I wanna say,

54
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,844
your leadership has been an inspiration
to all of us on the project.

55
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,943
- I hope I've not embarrassed you.
- Not at all.

56
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,344
- Mr. Moseby, congratulations.
Very good job.

57
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:57,456
Charlie, thank you.

58
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,636
- I don't know if you know Davis
from the firm?

59
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:01,220
Davis.

60
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,695
Mr. Moseby.
Uh, the building...

61
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,698
Wow!
It's there.

62
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,564
Yes?

63
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:14,299
Uh, you know that Boston Bank building
you designed years ago?

64
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,707
I've stood on the sidewalk
for hours absorbing that structure.

65
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,143
- It still surprises me.
- Thank you, Davis.

66
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,444
Don't you think we should be going
for that kind of originality...

67
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,746
instead of these same designs
over and over,

68
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,911
this cookie-cutter
architecture?

69
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,353
Don't you feel we're just
going through the motions?

70
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,915
We are the largest
architectural firm in New England.

71
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:38,191
Evidently some people
like what we do.

72
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,234
Are you insane?

73
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,396
Why didn't you kick him in the balls
and tell him he has ugly children?

74
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,407
I thought he'd appreciate
a fresh point of view.

75
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,966
Why would you think that?
He's the boss!

76
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,172
If I could find the right doctor,
I'd have my lips sewn to his ass.

77
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,477
We're different.

78
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,617
- Yes. Come Monday,
I will still have a job.

79
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,677
Hi, Mr. Simpson.

80
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,735
Is Gwen, yes? I remember
beautiful Gwen from Hungary...

81
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,836
who speaks no English.

82
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,144
That is a drawing of
an engagement ring,

83
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,117
which I designed
and even built.

84
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,713
But, as engagement rings go,
it turned out to be a little, you know,

85
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,519
"big" for the lady.

86
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:43,585
What do you say, Gwen?
"Gwhen" do you get off...

87
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,722
and "gwhere" can we "gwo"?

88
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,925
- Oh God.
- Good night, kiddo.

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,525
- Good night.
- I'll take care of opening tomorrow.

90
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,594
Oh, you will?
I can sleep.

91
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,072
- Oh, I love you.
- No sweat.

92
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,542
Cíao.

93
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,636
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, Gwen.

94
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:04,740
Come on, chop-chop.
Let's get home.

95
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,752
Taxi!

96
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,758
Good night, little Howie.

97
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:18,163
Hey,
you tricked me.

98
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,064
Why were you pretending
to be Hungarian?

99
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,591
- Ambience.
- Ambience, yeah. But you still tricked me.

100
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,003
- I didn't trick you. I deceived you.
- What's the difference?

101
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,508
- Intention.
- Intention?

102
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,602
- Are you a law student or something?
- Hey!

103
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,944
I guessed it? You're a law student?
Where do you go to school?

104
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,474
Don't you mean
"gwhere" do I go to school?

105
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,455
I, I admit, I was
a little condescending.

106
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,652
Yeah, when you thought
I was just a waitress.

107
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,493
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- I'm not a law student.

108
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,465
Why'd you tell me
you were a law student?

109
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:59,836
I didn't. You told me I was a law student.
I just told you I wasn't a law student.

110
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,473
Listen!

111
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,241
Listen, can...
can we go somewhere?

112
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,680
- Get coffee or something?
- No, I really have to get home.

113
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,742
Share my cab.
I could give you a lift.

114
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,754
Thank you very much,
but it's real close.

115
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,915
I'll walk you.
I could use some air.

116
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,426
Okay.

117
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,736
There's all these cities
I want to live in before I die,

118
00:09:36,737 --> 00:09:38,605
and Boston happened to be one.

119
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,942
There's New York, which is
where I came up here from.

120
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:44,915
Before that there was Seattle, San
Francisco, Santa Fe, New Orleans,

121
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,918
- Akron.
- Akron?

122
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,580
Yeah, well...
It was a detour, you know.

123
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,555
But I lived there
so I count it.

124
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,819
Before that, there was
Toledo, where I grew up.

125
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:57,454
- Gosh, I've never lived anywhere.
- How can you never live anywhere?

126
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,499
Well, just here
and Dobb's Mill.

127
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,966
That's where I grew up.
It's about 50 miles from here.

128
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,230
It's one of those
white-picket-fence sort of towns,

129
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,296
with your basic church steeple,
town square,

130
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,467
and big firemen's
pancake breakfasts.

131
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,841
All the kids
grew up together.

132
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,609
And everybody knows you,
you know what I mean?

133
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:20,118
- Sure. So is that where she's from?
- Who?

134
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,780
The babe who thought the house
was too big for her finger.

135
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,449
Oh, Becky.
No, no, that's over.

136
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,254
I bet you still have
her picture in your wallet.

137
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,625
- Get outta there. Get outta my...
- C'mon, let me see.

138
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,062
Hey, you knocked me
into the water there.

139
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,124
- Who cares about wallet photos?
- You could go to jail for this.

140
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,193
No, that's her
in the 6th grade.

141
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,262
I got a more up-to-date.
Let's see, 7th grade, 8th grade, 9th...

142
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,504
Let me just jump ahead.
That's Becky, but it's over, believe me.

143
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,513
Did you see that picture?
Was she a cute baby?

144
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,640
Is that funny?
Anyway...

145
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:54,049
Here's her driver's license.
She was gonna throw this away.

146
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,021
I said, "Are you crazy?
That's a cute picture."

147
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,354
Anyway, I don't even
go up there anymore.

148
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,860
I probably should take the
ribbon off the house, right?

149
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:06,159
You mean you still own it
and nobody's living in it?

150
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,565
Yeah, it's a waste, huh?
It's just so nice up there,

151
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:12,729
especially this time of the year
with the leaves changing.

152
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:16,832
And it's got this wraparound porch
that looks onto a pond.

153
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,367
And in the living room, it's got these
switchback stairs that go up to a loft.

154
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,540
Sorry, I still get
a little excited about it.

155
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,811
I mean,
I don't use it, but...

156
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,514
- But what?
- I just can't bring myself to sell it.

157
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,682
It's like I'm stuck where I am,
like I can't change it.

158
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,692
- Did you ever feel like that?
- No.

159
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,923
- No?
- No, I...

160
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,158
I change myself
all the time.

161
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,895
If things aren't workin' out,
I change what I do, change where I live,

162
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,043
I change myself.

163
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:48,565
- You're Hungarian one minute
and a law student the next.

164
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,940
Ooh! This is fabulous!
Oh, I love it.

165
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,945
We're back where
we started from.

166
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:59,610
Ooh, yeah, it's where I live,
above the restaurant.

167
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,880
I told you it was close
but you said you wanted some air,

168
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,650
so we went for a walk.

169
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,862
Listen.

170
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,258
Could I use your phone
to call a cab?

171
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,325
- Do you mind?
- Sure, why not.

172
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,496
Good night, Ralph.
Good night, Mary.

173
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,767
Hello!

174
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,549
In return for waitressing,
I get to live here rent free,

175
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,244
which actually works out
really well for him in taxes,

176
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,413
and then what I earn is the tips,
which is really great.

177
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:41,017
You'd be surprised how well you can do,
particularly with that Hungarian thing.

178
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,960
Your lock's busted.

179
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,658
Yeah, I know. I've been
raggin' on Karol about that.

180
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,894
- Who's she?
- He.

181
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,301
He's the guy who
owns the Budapest.

182
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,305
Funny name for a guy.

183
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,672
Yeah, it is.

184
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:01,008
- Newt.
- Huh?

185
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,107
I saw it on your driver's license,
Newton Davis.

186
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,778
What kind of name
is that anyway?

187
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,014
Only my father
calls me that.

188
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,684
Yeah, my dad's name
is Bernard.

189
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,422
Bernard? That's kind of
a "Newtony" kind of name, isn't it?

190
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,397
Bernard.
Oh, Dad.

191
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,163
I remember I used to curl up on his lap,
watch "Howdy Doody" with him,

192
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,898
roll down his socks
and tickle his feet.

193
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,906
Anyway,
this is my place.

194
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:34,241
It's cozy. I like what you did
with the drape thing.

195
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,873
- Yeah, well, I'm no architect.
- It's nice.

196
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,680
I like the way you used
the negative space.

197
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,948
- You're interesting.
- Really?

198
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:48,426
Yeah, you're so...
average.

199
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,198
Guess you better show me
where your phone is.

200
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:10,246
Whoa!
I don't have a phone.

201
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,978
What?

202
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,112
Oh, I can't afford it.

203
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:20,318
I figured I didn't know anybody in town,
so I just didn't get a phone.

204
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,519
But I asked you if I
could use your phone.

205
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,758
- That's not what you asked me.
- That is exactly what I asked.

206
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:29,665
You did not. You asked me if you
could come up here and sleep with me.

207
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,930
You know that
as well as I do.

208
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,816
You said yes.

209
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,816
May I stay?

210
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,725
Yeah.

211
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,067
Dobb's Mill.
Watch your step getting off.

212
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,503
Thanks.
Bye.

213
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,831
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi, Dave.

214
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:38,262
Milk, juice...

215
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,601
cereal and bread.

216
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,606
So, Hazel,

217
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:46,576
we're lookin' at $23.85.
Should I put that on your account?

218
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,943
- Thank you, Travis.
- Okey-doke.

219
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,814
- Hey, best to Stuey.
- All right.

220
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,986
Potato, tomato,
avocado,

221
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:02,083
pint of ice cream
and steak.

222
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,823
So, miss, we're
lookin' at $34.63.

223
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:09,594
Right. Put that on the
Newton Davis account, please.

224
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,229
- I beg your pardon?
- Newton Davis, 611 Hillside.

225
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:16,297
I know Davis,
but he doesn't have an account here.

226
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,037
- Wait, you're Travis, right?
- And you are?

227
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,944
Yeah, he told me
about this store.

228
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,882
Great place! It reminds me
of when I was growing up.

229
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,079
My grandfather had a store just like
this in a little town in Ohio.

230
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,317
Uh-huh?
And your relation to Davis is?

231
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,883
Oh, gosh,
where do I begin?

232
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,327
It all happened
so fast.

233
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:43,130
I mean, well, I came here really just
to get the house together and everything.

234
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,829
He doesn't even know
that I'm here.

235
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:49,032
I told him I went to see my sister
because she was pregnant in Toledo.

236
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:52,042
I thought it would be
so great to surprise him,

237
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,738
which I hope I do.

238
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,941
I met him and then
he said to me...

239
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,917
what a great little town
this was...

240
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,387
and what a fabulous house he built
and the truth is, I'm his wife.

241
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:09,553
You're telling me,
you and him are hitched?

242
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:13,928
Yeah. I hardly
believe it myself.

243
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,731
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

244
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,071
- Hi. I'm sorry.
- Hi.

245
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,076
I couldn't help
but hear.

246
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,136
- You're married to Newton Davis?
- Yeah.

247
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,909
- I'm Becky.
- Becky?

248
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:34,611
- Metcalf.
- Becky Metcalf?

249
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,621
Oh, Davis told me
all about you.

250
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,623
I'm Gwen.
Did he tell you about me?

251
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,718
- No, I didn't even know he was married.
- Oh, well!

252
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:47,390
We really haven't told anybody yet.
It was kind of that crazy thing we did.

253
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,764
We did it on the
spur of the moment.

254
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,769
That's Davis.

255
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,896
- Hi, Becky.
- Hi, Marge.

256
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,430
- Tell me, how is he doing?
- Oh, he's great.

257
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,000
Well, you know.
He's such a fabulous guy.

258
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,707
Nowadays, it's hard to tell if a guy's
gonna be there when you wake up.

259
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,750
And you're living
in "the" house?

260
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:10,254
Starting to. Just getting groceries,
housewares, pots and pans.

261
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,155
- The hardware store is over there.
- Oh.

262
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,625
- Come on, I'll introduce you.
- Thanks.

263
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,460
Aren't you nice?

264
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,968
I don't have the cash
for all this.

265
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,339
Oh, don't be silly.
On your account.

266
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,675
- Harv, grab a... Harv?
- Huh?

267
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,840
Grab a percolator
off the shelf.

268
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:42,114
Now, you bring Davis around so we can
congratulate him, that sly boots.

269
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,884
- Well, I've gotta run.
- Okay.

270
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,289
Maybe I'll call you
for dinner sometime?

271
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,987
Great!

272
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,030
Seems like the marriage
is off to a good start.

273
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,430
Yeah, so far
it's been ideal,

274
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,061
kind of like I died
and went to heaven.

275
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,205
Oh, hi!
Great chair!

276
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,211
- You work here?
- Yes, ma'am.

277
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,444
I love it. You could practically
live in this chair, you know?

278
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,009
I don't see how.

279
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,386
- How much?
- It's twenty dollars.

280
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,755
How 'bout I give you
fifteen?

281
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,090
Well, no,
it's twenty dollars.

282
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,529
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you seventeen cash.

283
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,533
We only take cash.

284
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,967
- Do you deliver?
- Free of charge.

285
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:08,699
All right, you've got a deal.
611 Hillside.

286
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,207
Do you think you could
have it delivered by tonight?

287
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,838
What was that address again?

288
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:15,337
- 611 Hillside,
that house Newton Davis built.

289
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:19,679
- That house is vacant.
- Well, we're moving back.

290
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,878
I'm Gwen.
I'm his wife.

291
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:26,049
Mine's George.
I'm his father.

292
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:30,424
All I can say, sir,
is that I apologize.

293
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:33,794
Frankly, I was the one who,
after your son just...

294
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,924
swept me off my feet,

295
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,368
decided that maybe it would
be best if we waited...

296
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:43,271
and see if the marriage was gonna work
before we told our families about it.

297
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:47,004
Of course, Newton said,
"Oh, you're just way too levelheaded.

298
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,569
You should be
more impulsive."

299
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,582
Maybe he's right,
I don't know.

300
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,084
But I just wanna say
that you guys raised...

301
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,815
the most caring,
sharing man.

302
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,551
Thank you.

303
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:04,322
Uh, Edna, any comments?

304
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,330
Why,
I don't believe it.

305
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,696
- You don't?
- I just don't believe it.

306
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:12,225
- Which part?
- Tha... tha... that he could be so...

307
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,034
insensitive,
so irresponsible!

308
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:19,475
Because it's just like him, Edna.
The boy hasn't changed a bit.

309
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,603
What does he think
marriage is?

310
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,580
And this question goes for
you, too, young woman.

311
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,878
What do
young people today...

312
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,317
think marriage...

313
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:32,186
is?

314
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,191
You don't mean like
write an essay?

315
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,643
It's because of our
little dispute, isn't it?

316
00:26:36,644 --> 00:26:38,923
Is that why he kept this marriage a secret?

317
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:45,196
Yes, it is.

318
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,637
But he feels really badly
about all this, Mr. Davis.

319
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,800
Why, you'd never know it
to talk to him.

320
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:55,005
Perhaps because you
don't talk to him, George.

321
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,310
- He's the one who never calls or visits.
- George!

322
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,215
- You babied the boy, Edna.
- Mr. And Mrs. Davis,

323
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,449
Newton is really sorry
about, um, you know.

324
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,457
And, uh, he just
talks about it all the time.

325
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:10,517
In fact, he talked about it
the other night and he cried.

326
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:14,861
- You hear that, George?
- I'm right here, Edna.

327
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:18,460
My boy cried.

328
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:21,198
Why don't you
pick up the phone...

329
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,935
- and call the boy.
- I don't think that would be a good idea.

330
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,173
For the time being, why don't you
send messages through me.

331
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:32,444
George?

332
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,013
Well, suppose you...

333
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,718
Oh, just tell him please,
for God's sake, come home.

334
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:45,285
Oh, George.

335
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,813
Um, come in.

336
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:08,546
Come in!

337
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,986
Hello!

338
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:15,322
- Edna!
- Hello.

339
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:19,090
- Oh.
- Good morning. Is it morning?

340
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,098
Oh my.

341
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:25,603
- But if this isn't a convenient time...
- No, it's fine. Come in.

342
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,605
- I didn't mean to come before you...
- That's all right. I'm awake.

343
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:33,633
- Or dressed.
- Whoops.

344
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:38,012
So I see you've already found
a spot to put your chair.

345
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,541
Oh, yes.
Well, I'm just trying it out.

346
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,985
Oh, what's that?

347
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,785
It's just a little something
to help you get started.

348
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,292
Oh no,
I really couldn't.

349
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,385
Wow!

350
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,626
After all,
he is our only son.

351
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,834
Let's go spend it.

352
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,366
Hi, Davis.

353
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,207
Hi.

354
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,318
Martin,

355
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,877
I've been thinking about the house
in Dobb's Mill, about selling it.

356
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,720
- Sell it.
- I could pay back everyone I owe money to.

357
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,726
I agree. Could you
take a look at this?

358
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,627
Keeping this house is like
hanging onto the past.

359
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,156
- The only entrance is through
the air conditioning duct.

360
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:29,428
I was trying to solve that.

361
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,436
I think it's preventing me from having
any real relationship with another woman.

362
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,302
Right, with
Denise or Patricia.

363
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,207
Or like
that waitress the other night.

364
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,405
- The one who didn't speak English?
- Very interesting woman.

365
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,449
- You've got people exiting
into a wall! - Uh-oh.

366
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:49,681
- Did you sleep with her?
- Oh, gee, you know...

367
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,245
Yes, and I woke up in the
middle of the night...

368
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:55,315
- completely tied up in knots.
- Okay!

369
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:58,021
No, I mean
as in anxiety.

370
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,293
And I did this horrible thing;
I left.

371
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,961
I know what it is, it's Becky.
I gotta close the book on that.

372
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,936
- I'm gonna sell the house.
- There you go.

373
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,566
We just talk and talk.
There's so much to talk about.

374
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,544
We have this amazing communication.
It's like Chinese food.

375
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:15,460
Excuse me?

376
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:19,208
- Like on Thursdays
and you can't deal with dinner?

377
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,082
He comes home with this
big bag of Chinese take-out.

378
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,087
It's just...
like he knew!

379
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:28,353
- That's amazing.
- I know, Chinese food. Can you stand it?

380
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,018
That's fabulous.

381
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,299
Are you finished
with that?

382
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,931
Mmm. Ooh,
that's good.

383
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,238
So, you were starting to tell me
how the two of you met.

384
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,609
Oh, right.

385
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,807
I'm crossing
Boylston street...

386
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:55,444
and this moron doing a right on red
plows right into me and then takes off.

387
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,715
- We never did catch him.
- Were you hurt?

388
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,849
My nose was busted,
both cheekbones were cracked,

389
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,825
and the front of my jaw
was fractured.

390
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,421
They had me all taped up
like one of those mummies...

391
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,761
and all you could see were
my eyeballs and my lips.

392
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,393
- My God!
- So I'm in this hospital room...

393
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:14,996
and I'm sharing it with this woman
who works for an architectural firm.

394
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,303
Davis came in and
brought her balloons.

395
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,969
He felt sorry for me
on account of my being a mummy,

396
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,138
and he gave me
one of the balloons.

397
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,910
He came back the next day
to visit me,

398
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,475
then the next and
then the next.

399
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,489
It wasn't like a come-on
because he hadn't even seen my face.

400
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,754
It was just two people talking,
during which came out that...

401
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,796
I didn't have the insurance
to pay for the bill so he paid for it.

402
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,593
Davis did?

403
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:45,432
- How long were you in?
- Two weeks.

404
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:49,337
How could he afford that?
He's got all of his money in that house.

405
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,967
Oh, well, you know
he's an architect.

406
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:56,104
Yes, but he's just an associate.
It doesn't pay very much.

407
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,116
- You know, he got promoted.
- He has?

408
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,347
Mm-hmm, yeah.
They love him over at that firm now.

409
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,718
They do?

410
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:08,316
He's kicking big
architectural butt.

411
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:12,227
He takes me home from the hospital
and runs all these errands for me...

412
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:15,630
All this time,
he's never seen your face,

413
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,668
you're still
all wrapped up?

414
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,295
Oh, this is so Davis.

415
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,966
Then one night,
he kissed me.

416
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:27,739
And we started to...
well, you know.

417
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,871
Oooh.

418
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,315
Here I am in this mummy mask,
but it was incredible...

419
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,477
because I could be anyone.

420
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,249
Oh, God,

421
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:41,656
I can't tell you
how hot that made it.

422
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:50,657
So, then he wants to marry me
and he hasn't even seen my face.

423
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,636
So what he proposes is,
which is of course what we did,

424
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:57,038
is we got married the next week
at the hospital.

425
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,771
When the chaplain said "You may now kiss
the bride," instead of lifting the veil,

426
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:05,509
the doctor
unwrapped the gauze.

427
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:10,282
And he saw me
for the first time.

428
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,358
And he looked at me...

429
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,451
and he smiled.

430
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:23,264
And then,

431
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,167
the rest.

432
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,637
Oh.

433
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:31,140
Yeah.

434
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,162
Woo, Katie!

435
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,497
¶ Katie, Katie bo-badie
Banana-fanna fo-fadie ¶

436
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,504
¶ Fee-fi-foo, matie
Katie ¶

437
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,096
Yeah! Ollie!

438
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:13,473
- ¶ Ollie, Ollie bo-ballie
Banana-fanna... ¶ - Hello?

439
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,541
What are you
doing here?

440
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,313
What am I doing?
What are you doing here?

441
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,359
Well, I, I got kicked out of my
apartment and had no place to go.

442
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:34,296
I would have called you except you never told
me where you lived or where your office was.

443
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,925
You're the waitress,
Gwen.

444
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,834
Well, excuse me but I thought
we'd been introduced.

445
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,362
No, I recognize you. It's just,
you were wearing that Hungarian garb.

446
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,534
I had to get out
of that place...

447
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,544
because Karol and I had
a real difference of opinion...

448
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,603
of exactly when he could come
into my apartment unannounced...

449
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,740
and exactly where he could
put his hands while he was there.

450
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,145
- Didn't you have any friends
you could go to?

451
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:56,878
I'd only been in Boston 3 weeks.

452
00:35:56,954 --> 00:36:00,446
All I had was that cute
drawing you did of this house.

453
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:04,723
I knew it was in Dobb's Mill and it was
just sitting here, not doing anything.

454
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,161
- Where did all of this furniture come from?
- Bigelows.

455
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,667
How did it get here?
Some furniture stampede?

456
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,566
- I'll pay you back.
- Pay me back?

457
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,162
Oh, Bobo, no.
Come on, honey.

458
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:18,003
The men are coming tomorrow
to put in the dog door.

459
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:21,135
- What is happening?
- If you'd just listen.

460
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,407
I'm listening.
I'm listening.

461
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,746
All right.
I was hungry, okay?

462
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,786
I went to Keller's Market
to pick up some peanut butter...

463
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,241
- and that's where I overheard
Hazel telling Travis...

464
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:33,153
Whoa, whoa. Hazel?

465
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,660
- Hazel Byron.
- You know Mrs. Byron?

466
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,753
Yeah, your piano teacher?
Great gal.

467
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,764
I don't know if you heard
about her son, Stuey,

468
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:45,097
but oh, what he put
that poor woman through!

469
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:48,263
Go back to the store
where Mrs. Byron says to Mr. Keller...

470
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:52,241
Okay. She told him
to just put it on her account.

471
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,540
Charge the groceries
to me?

472
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,706
Well, I was hungry.
You gotta understand that.

473
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,773
How'd you get him
to do it?

474
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,875
I guess he was under the impression
that I was...

475
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,251
Insane?

476
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,849
No, I just told him
to put it on our account.

477
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:11,520
- Our account?
- Well, it seemed harmless.

478
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,697
You told him
you were my wife?

479
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:19,497
What was I supposed to do?
You tell me?

480
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,630
And he believed you?

481
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,267
And why wouldn't he
believe me?

482
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,608
- Well...
- I'm not good enough to be your wife?

483
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,977
- No!
- Well, Travis thinks I'm good enough.

484
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,891
- And Harvey and Lorraine
think I'm good enough.

485
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:35,109
This coffee table.

486
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,713
- What about it?
- It's my mother's.

487
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,349
I know, it's not
my taste either.

488
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,620
But all of this
represents a compromise.

489
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:46,629
- You know your mother.
- My parents think we're married?

490
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:50,861
Hey, it's not so bad!
Everything's gonna be fine.

491
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,960
Would you mind
taking your feet off the furniture?

492
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,028
Gwen.
Gwen?

493
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,472
Gwen, Gwen, Gwen!

494
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:00,374
- You can't stay here.
- Why not?

495
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,208
- I hardly know you.
- Oh, come on!

496
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,772
Where the hell
am I supposed to go?

497
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,580
- What do you mean you hardly know me?
- Gwen, I'm sorry.

498
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,746
I'm terribly sorry
for the way I acted.

499
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,585
I'm going through a difficult time
and this isn't helping.

500
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:18,527
Look, I've got maybe a hundred bucks here,
just 'til you get back on your feet again.

501
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,326
- Take it.
- Is that payment for services rendered?

502
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,562
- Oh, come on!
- I don't want your money!

503
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,229
No, just my goddamn house, right?

504
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,839
- Hello?
- Becky.

505
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:38,541
I was dying to see how everything
looked, and I saw your car outside...

506
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,379
And I, uh...

507
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,946
Oh, congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.

508
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,718
You needn't be.
You want to tell her or should I?

509
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:51,023
You're a shit.

510
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:55,031
- Maybe I'll just wait and come back.
- Becky! Becky!

511
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,533
Becky, look,
here's what happened.

512
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,502
- Whatever it is, it's between you and Gwen.
- Becky...

513
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:04,166
Let me say one thing.
That is a wonderful woman,

514
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:07,267
and yours is a
genuinely unique marriage.

515
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,710
I'll say.

516
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,509
To marry a woman
whose face you've never seen...

517
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:16,679
until your wedding day at the hospital
when the doctor removes the gauze?

518
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,314
That is unique,
my friend!

519
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,190
It made my heart
go pitty-pat.

520
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,387
Did it?

521
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,962
Do you know why
I said no to you that day?

522
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,537
It's because
you scared me,

523
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:37,768
building this house,
putting a ribbon around it.

524
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,833
I didn't want
to marry a dreamer.

525
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,378
I'm not that brave.

526
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:46,439
But when I see you
through Gwen's eyes,

527
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,179
- you look very different to me.
- How?

528
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:54,452
Well, I could see how a dreamer,
with somebody who believes in him...

529
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,255
could do great things.

530
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,456
- I heard about your promotion.
- Hmm?

531
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:04,262
Associate partner?
Wow!

532
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,769
Oh, she told you
about that?

533
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:11,137
She's very proud of you.
She deserves to be.

534
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:15,008
- I must admit, I'm a little jealous.
- Really?

535
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,741
Yeah, a little.

536
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,346
- Becky?
- Hmm?

537
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:29,390
There's something
I think you should know.

538
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,553
I slept with
Boomer Bauer?

539
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,756
It's not like you
were being promiscuous.

540
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,392
He's your old boyfriend. You got
to reminiscing, and it just happened.

541
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,402
Except now you don't know
where we stand.

542
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,667
You gave me an old boyfriend
and you named him Boomer?

543
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,267
I'm a little new at this.
But that's the beauty of it,

544
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:50,109
that's why you left Boston to come up
here and decide between me and Boomer.

545
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,240
I can't believe
you told her that.

546
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:55,911
I can't believe you can't believe it!
You've told a few whoppers yourself!

547
00:40:55,986 --> 00:41:00,446
- I told nice ones!
- Gwen.

548
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:05,359
Gwen, I love her.

549
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:08,364
I've always loved her,
but something went wrong.

550
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:13,768
She couldn't picture me as her husband.
But now, with our being married,

551
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,296
she finally sees me as
a husband-kind-of-guy.

552
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:21,105
So, I think you and I
can help each other. Here's the deal.

553
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,909
We're married but
our marriage is on the rocks.

554
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,179
Every weekend, I drive up and
try hard to save this marriage.

555
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:31,312
- I get to stay in the house?
- Absolutely!

556
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:34,653
Meanwhile, Becky's heart goes out to me,
you and I get divorced,

557
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,592
and then, boom,
I get Becky.

558
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,197
What do you say?

559
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,134
For a while there
it was really a great marriage.

560
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:53,235
Well it was
until you came into it.

561
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,457
Sweetheart,
oh sweetheart,

562
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,727
you've made me
so happy.

563
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,860
You've brought home
a princess.

564
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:25,507
- Hi, Pop.
- Son.

565
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,545
My little boy.

566
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:31,410
I see you've met Gwen.

567
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,189
Why'd you do it,
son?

568
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:42,953
- Well, I...
- Understand I like her. I like her a lot.

569
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,689
But she is something
of an acquired taste.

570
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,754
I've grown
quite fond of her.

571
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:51,096
It's just the secrecy,
not sharing the decision.

572
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:54,484
- I can't help but feel
it's part of our battle.

573
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:55,229
Oh, Pop!

574
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,900
Don't say a thing.
Gwen said it all for you.

575
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,102
- She has?
- What I'm trying to say to you...

576
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,042
is I apologize.

577
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:05,309
You do?

578
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:10,876
I won't deny
I was upset.

579
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,981
You go into debt to build a house
you won't live in...

580
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,049
so you end up
with a mortgage...

581
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,095
- and that crazy rent in the city.
- Don't start, Pop.

582
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,097
I won't.
I won't.

583
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,929
Finally you do make good decisions;
Gwen, for instance,

584
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:27,869
plus now giving up the apartment
and coming back here.

585
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,736
You told them I was
giving up my apartment?

586
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:32,742
Uh, let me think.

587
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:36,439
What she told us was
how sorry you felt.

588
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:38,947
Like the other week
when you cried?

589
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:42,213
No shame in it, son. Just don't
do it often. Nobody likes a crybaby.

590
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,084
You told them
I was sorry?

591
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:48,022
You did say you regretted
the situation, remember?

592
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:52,961
Okay, but I never said
I was giving up my apartment.

593
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,091
- Her intentions were good.
- Yes, her intentions.

594
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:00,068
But that's a whole, separate subject,
isn't it, dear?

595
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:05,666
- Up yours.
- Nicely put. What a princess, huh, Mom?

596
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:10,680
Look, Mom, Dad, I didn't particularly
want to discuss this now,

597
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:14,741
but you might as well know that, that,
that Gwen and I are separated.

598
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,616
- What?
- That's the reason she came up here.

599
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,280
What are you saying?

600
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:22,382
I'm saying
the marriage is a bust.

601
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:26,088
Go ahead, Pop, lecture me;
another immature move by Newton.

602
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:40,167
Davis.
Davis?

603
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,544
Look, I goofed, okay?

604
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:50,280
I thought I was doing you a favor
bringing you and your dad back together.

605
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,482
I don't see why we had
to get separated because of it.

606
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:56,583
- We separated because of Boomer.
- We did not.

607
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,685
I came up to
sort things out.

608
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:02,425
Geez, Boomer
was just a one-nighter.

609
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:21,578
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.

610
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:25,053
Okay, okay.

611
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,580
Stay outside, Bobo.
Okay, okay.

612
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:33,528
Honey? Sweetheart?

613
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:36,430
Look who Bobo and I
bumped into jogging?

614
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,060
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

615
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:43,698
Oh, my goodness,
look at all the furnishings.

616
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:48,541
I tried to use reflective light
to create a feeling of warmth.

617
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,709
I think I'll
go make some tea.

618
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,555
Oh, here's the tub
right next to the bed.

619
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:05,527
- Notice it's designed for two.
- Oh?

620
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,259
- I'm going!
- Yeah, bye.

621
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,994
So, you like the house?

622
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:16,562
Oh, well, uh,
how could I not?

623
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,370
It's... In fact,
it makes me realize something...

624
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:24,471
about Gwen sleeping
with that old boyfriend?

625
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:30,018
I could see how something like that
might happen.

626
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,419
You can?

627
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,548
Can't you?

628
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,924
Oh, uh, yes.

629
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,293
Which is to say that, I...

630
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:44,027
You should really be more understanding
of her and, and forgiving.

631
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:48,060
I mean,
she's just human.

632
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,039
We're all just human.

633
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:55,568
Lemon or sugar?

634
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,315
- Bye.
- Bye.

635
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,979
This was wonderful.
Thanks for the tour... oh, and the tea.

636
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,096
Mom? Dad?

637
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,065
Reverend Lipton?

638
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:24,073
In the brief time I've gotten to know
Gwen, I must say I was shocked...

639
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:29,443
when your parents came and told me
that you were both experiencing...

640
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,276
difficulties.

641
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:35,751
But so often,
just by talking it out,

642
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,549
which we could arrange
say, on a weekly basis,

643
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,892
perhaps at the church...

644
00:47:39,893 --> 00:47:42,285
- I am not going to counseling
with this woman,

645
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,293
and that is final.

646
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,057
- I'm disappointed in you.
- George, please.

647
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,776
- You've gotten all you want,
now you want out.

648
00:47:49,777 --> 00:47:50,327
George.

649
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,733
Marriage is different from a
one-night stand, or used to be.

650
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,635
And it ought to be.

651
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,072
What's everybody
coming down on me for?

652
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:01,304
- She's the one.
- The one who what?

653
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,744
The one who made up...

654
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:10,513
- Made up what?
- Who made up...

655
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:14,990
with her old boyfriend
and bedded down with him.

656
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:19,961
She slept with her old boyfriend
after we were married.

657
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,573
Maybe we should wait
out on the porch.

658
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:35,571
- You babied him, Edna.
Now he can't hold his woman.

659
00:48:35,572 --> 00:48:36,841
Oh, shut up, George.

660
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,975
- I was bored.
- What?

661
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:43,212
Let her
get it out now.

662
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,255
All I do is stay
around this house.

663
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:48,758
- He never lets me do what I want.
- Try to be specific.

664
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:51,589
Like those art classes
I wanted to take.

665
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,755
And sometimes I really want
to go to the theater.

666
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,355
Then he complains
about my thighs.

667
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,993
So great, I'll go
to dancing class.

668
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,162
He says, oh no,
it's too expensive.

669
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:04,901
- I don't believe this.
- No, no, this is good.

670
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,909
Purge, Gwen.
Purge.

671
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:10,435
The courses I want to take
at the university.

672
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,005
Do you think
he'll let me?

673
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,745
What about the, the...
uh, tennis lessons.

674
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:20,916
You quit after three weeks. The same
thing with the, the, uh, scuba diving.

675
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:24,427
Because of those comments
you made about me and my rubber suit.

676
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:27,258
I said you looked
like a porpoise.

677
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:30,994
- Is that supposed to be cute?
- Flipper was a porpoise!

678
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,127
I don't want to be
compared to Flipper.

679
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:37,105
- I'm not comparing you to Flipper.
- Think how that makes me feel.

680
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:40,974
- Shh. One at a time, please.
- Shut up!

681
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:43,274
- Wait a minute.
- Here's what the problem is.

682
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:47,078
When I come home,
you're always organizing.

683
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,084
For starters,

684
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:53,384
let's begin by both of you
trying once again...

685
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,948
to live under
the same roof.

686
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,290
Agreed?

687
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,296
For you, Gwen,

688
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:03,128
let's start by trying
to work on this idea...

689
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,193
of self-discipline, sticking
with something once you've begun it.

690
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,602
For instance, this idea
of continuing your education.

691
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:13,109
- Newton, I must say...
- I cannot afford it.

692
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:18,409
Even with your big promotion
that the whole town is talking about?

693
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,386
See you at choir practice.

694
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:34,991
Don't they gather by the river? That's
where they're gonna find your body.

695
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,226
Grow feathers and
shit in a tree!

696
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:42,397
Why did you have to bring up sleeping
with what's-his-face? I was mortified.

697
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:43,584
We made a deal.

698
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:47,705
- That doesn't give you the right
to disparage my reputation.

699
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,679
What are you talking about?
You're a con artist.

700
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,716
Don't yell at me!
We're only pretending to be married.

701
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:57,151
The only person pulling a con
is you with Becky.

702
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,986
In return for which you extorted
free rent in a furnished house...

703
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,424
and now
a college education!

704
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:06,519
- And dance classes.
- Lest we forget.

705
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:10,999
¶¶

706
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,313
- Are you nuts?
- I thought you'd love the idea.

707
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,510
- Of marriage?
- It is not a marriage.

708
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,418
It is an arrangement in which I will share
my house with her in exchange for which...

709
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:34,980
she will argue with me and
make my life look pitiful.

710
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:37,526
That's marriage.

711
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:41,997
- How are you?
- Hey, how's the baby?

712
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,634
Guys!
Hi, guys!

713
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:56,806
Well, I'll be home around 6:30.
Want me to pick up anything?

714
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,849
Oh no, that sounds good.
No, no, I like that. Okay, great.

715
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,851
Okay, bye, honey.
Gwen!
