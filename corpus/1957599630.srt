190
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,233
(suspenseful instrumental music)

191
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,132
Eagle Don escapes
from Interrogation Center.

192
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:39,732
Headed to Mission Headquarters.

193
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:43,100
(suspenseful instrumental music)

194
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,399
(car horn beeps)

195
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,166
[Man] Whoa!

196
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,266
(suspenseful instrumental music)

197
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,499
[Boy] Lance, get off my bike!

198
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,732
You're gonna break it!

199
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:01,733
Lance, come on!

200
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,066
(suspenseful instrumental music)

201
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:06,499
[Lance Voiceover]
Red alert, red alert!

202
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,966
Enemy vehicle in pursuit,
closing in fast.

203
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,632
[Boy] I'm warning you, stop!

204
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:13,499
Lance, come on, you're
gonna break it!

205
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,666
(suspenseful instrumental music)

206
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,966
(car horn honks)

207
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:19,132
I don't know what's gotten
into you, young man!

208
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,799
You stop that bike!

209
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,832
(suspenseful instrumental music)

210
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,632
Stop that bike right now!

211
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:26,967
(suspenseful instrumental music)

212
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,366
(phone ringing)

213
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:56,066
Good morning, sir.

214
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,232
(phone ringing)

215
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:58,233
You're late.

216
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,132
Four minutes, 23 seconds.

217
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:02,699
Look, I was being chased.

218
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,599
People in station
wagons were chasing me.

219
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,399
I had to lose 'em, and I had
to take a detour here.

220
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,266
- Get some coffees.
- Sure.

221
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:10,987
- Mine is straight black.
- Of course it is.

222
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,766
Well, I'll send the files over.

223
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,466
(door clicking)

224
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:18,187
I'd like to get moving on
the Harrison case.

225
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20,133
Wednesday.

226
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,133
11:30.

227
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,699
(phone clicks)

228
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,566
Yes, Trout, what is it?

229
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:27,567
We need a signature.

230
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,187
Additional surveillance
equipment.

231
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,266
Well, I have
permission to extend

232
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:37,599
the duties of the
summer recruitment program.

233
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,399
Pamela, I don't know why you're

234
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,899
so obsessed with these kids.

235
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,066
Now, don't get me wrong.

236
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:45,432
I think the program
is a great idea.

237
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:47,099
The kids spend the
summer off the streets,

238
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,566
good experience for
them, but don't

239
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:53,066
you think you're taking this
a bit too seriously?

240
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,832
What about this
young kid, Lance?

241
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,632
I don't know.

242
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:58,066
There's something
strange about this kid.

243
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,532
Really?

244
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:00,766
He's only been with
us for three weeks.

245
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:01,600
He's a bright kid.

246
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:03,232
Give him a break.

247
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,966
Maybe you're right.

248
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:06,266
(door clicking
open) (phone ringing)

249
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,387
[Pamela] Oh, hello, Lance.

250
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,999
Mrs. Lomax.

251
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,499
(door slams)
- Thank you.

252
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Sure.

253
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:14,867
The one on the left.

254
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,032
Why?

255
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,593
Well, it's your
usual, straight black.

256
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:24,232
(spoon clinking)

257
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,832
Did you spit in it?

258
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,132
[Lance Voiceover]
Lance, you sly dog.

259
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,166
He fell for it.

260
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,966
A combination of strip
nine and carbon-10.

261
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:35,499
Colorless, sweet-tasting death
within seven seconds.

262
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,900
Lance, we have a
few (Trout gags)

263
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:44,033
(Trout coughs) - How
much sugar's in this?

264
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,599
Oh, that's mine, I'm sorry.

265
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,400
Four packets.

266
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,367
Here you go.

267
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:49,367
This one's yours, sorry.

268
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:52,132
Lance, we have a few assignments

269
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,966
we'd like you to do today.

270
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:56,532
I'm putting you under
Trout's supervision.

271
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:57,467
[Lance Voiceover]
Oh, this is bad.

272
00:14:57,468 --> 00:14:58,899
This is very bad.

273
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,066
I should've poisoned him.

274
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,707
We have a number of
assignments for you.

275
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,399
These early assignments are
for character building.

276
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
PDPD.

277
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:13,199
Perception,
Discipline, Patience.

278
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,266
The three qualities
of a solid agent.

279
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:17,732
[Lance Voiceover] An assignment.

280
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:21,766
Lance Elliot sent to Paris under
the codename Eagle Don.

281
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,466
Lance, you have a
lot of potential.

282
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:26,732
But you need to learn
how to channel

283
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:27,500
that energy in the
right direction.

284
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:28,799
[Lance Voiceover] The mission?

285
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,466
Meet a girl under
the Eiffel Tower.

286
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,399
Her name, Charlene.

287
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,266
Ask her is she has a
tourist map of Nice.

288
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,466
You'll know if she answers no.

289
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:37,666
But I have a parrot named Buzz.

290
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:40,166
Especially if you plan
to join the agency.

291
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,532
After all, that's
what this summer

292
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:42,613
program is about, isn't it?

293
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:44,833
Lance.

294
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,900
Are you ready to start?

295
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,867
Absolutely.

296
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,867
Yes.

297
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,467
(sharpener whirring)

298
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:08,600
(gentle instrumental music)

299
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,432
Eagle Don joins
forces with Charlene.

300
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:16,666
Tonight, the mission begins at
the Cafe Mar-suh-lee-ay.

301
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,032
A romantic candle-lit
dinner with

302
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:20,632
red wine, passionate dessert.

303
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:23,332
The mission is to find the
parrot named Buzz.

304
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,066
I suggest we start
by searching her apartment.

305
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:29,032
(gentle instrumental music)

306
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:30,132
Cheers.

307
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,099
(sharpener whirring)

308
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,832
(gentle instrumental music)

309
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,100
(engine rumbling)

310
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:43,232
(birds chirping)

311
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:46,899
(brakes squeal)

312
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,532
I thought for years, for years

313
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,799
I thought that
perhaps you harbored

314
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,299
some resentment against me.

315
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,699
Oh, don't be silly, Rudi.

316
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,099
We were both young, reckless.

317
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,332
Look what you made out
of my little idea.

318
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,733
Out of a single home computer,
you've built an empire.

319
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,332
Oh, well, darling.

320
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,233
We have a guest.

321
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,233
Rudi Kseenbaum.

322
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,333
Rudolph Von Kseenbaum.

323
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,399
Rudi, it's certainly
my pleasure.

324
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,166
The pleasure is all mine.

325
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,599
Well, you really don't need
to get out, darling.

326
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,799
So, Rudi, it's been
about 17 years,

327
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,933
I think, since we
first became associated, and.

328
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,999
I take it you
obtained the FAA codes.

329
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,566
Of course.

330
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,632
Excellent.

331
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:43,599
(briefcase clicking)

332
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,160
Then we can proceed
to the second stage.

333
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,699
(footsteps thudding)

334
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,967
(tape clicking) (birds singing)

335
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:00,232
I have been hired
by an international

336
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,132
consortium of
businessmen to create

337
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:05,332
a very special computer virus.

338
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,932
Well, you've come
to the right place.

339
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,732
We still have a lot of
fun with computers.

340
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:10,832
Boo boop.

341
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,232
(laughs)

342
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,233
(laughs) So I hear.

343
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,566
A little bird told
me that you were

344
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,299
personally responsible
for the March

345
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,433
the 5th Michelangelo virus.

346
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,699
Well, I'm impressed.

347
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,233
That's not common knowledge.

348
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,732
(remote clicks)

349
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,999
[Narrator] Never
before has our world

350
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,132
come closer to the
brink of destruction.

351
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,999
An area of rainforest
the size of

352
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,766
a football field is being
cut every minute.

353
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:42,232
Carbon dioxide levels have
never been higher.

354
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:44,366
The UN Security
Council has elected

355
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:47,566
a Science Committee to
produce the Green Alert Report.

356
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,699
153 countries have
agreed to legislate

357
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,099
the findings of the report in an

358
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,699
effort to save the globe from
what is certain to.

359
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,132
Well, I know all that.

360
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,499
So let's get to the
interesting stuff.

361
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,866
The consortium
fears that the Green

362
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,107
Alert Report and the subsequent

363
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,999
legislation could seriously
damage their business interests.

364
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,266
Now, the Scientific Committee is

365
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:10,966
presently engaged
in a world tour.

366
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,932
In two days' time,
they will be flying

367
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:15,100
from Brazil to Atlanta, and
this is the plan.

368
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:21,632
(thudding)

369
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:25,032
The consortium would
like a scientist

370
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:28,767
to disappear unexplainedly in
the Bermuda Triangle.

371
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:32,373
Oh, that's a very nice tough.

372
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:35,999
(laughs) That's
where you come in.

373
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,266
We wish to have this done by an

374
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:40,700
untraceable, specialized
computer virus.

375
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:44,866
They are prepared
to pay $12,000.

376
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:48,199
I suggest we split
it fifty-fifty.

377
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,866
Seven for me, five
for you. (laughs)

378
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:53,307
(laughs) You haven't
changed, Rudi.

379
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,900
If the plane leaves in two days,
that's a tough schedule.

380
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:00,767
The fee's a little light.

381
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,333
But it'll be a
nice challenge, so I accept.

382
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,466
You're a great
sportsman, you know.

383
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:10,467
But I'm not business.

384
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,499
Let me show you something
I've been toying with recently.

385
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,199
May I leave this here?

386
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,299
[Cashpot] Of course, we'll
be right back!

387
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,232
(games beeping) Yep.

388
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:25,399
(laughs) This is my fun room.

389
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,033
(laughs) Incredible.

390
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,732
And you see, all these games are

391
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,766
linked up to my
central computer.

392
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,366
(games beeping)

393
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,732
Ah.

394
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:39,467
(Cashpot laughs)

395
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:40,433
Ah.

396
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:42,066
Ha, ha!

397
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,732
Yes, oh, this is
a wonderful one.

398
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:47,432
You just get in there
next to Ursula.

399
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:48,732
This is gonna kill ya.

400
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:50,266
(Rudi laughs) It is great.

401
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:51,399
Alright.

402
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,532
(door slams)

403
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:53,533
Isn't this fun?

404
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:55,899
Absolutely. (laughs)

405
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,099
How does it work?

406
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,260
Well, put on your seatbelt.

407
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,532
(seatbelt clicking)

408
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:08,732
(beeping)

409
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,432
I'm gonna put a quarter in here.

410
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,432
(clicking)

411
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:15,866
(playful instrumental music)

412
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:18,167
(engine roaring)

413
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,033
Isn't this fun?

414
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:24,032
(Rudi laughs)

415
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,332
(engine roaring)

416
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,466
(playful instrumental music)

417
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,767
(engine roaring)

418
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,667
(tires squealing)

419
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:41,767
(Rudi laughs)

420
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:46,233
Whoa!

421
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,199
(car horn beeps)

422
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,366
(woman screams)

423
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:55,899
(engine roaring)

424
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,167
(tires squealing)

425
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:03,167
(playful instrumental music)

426
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:11,766
Whoa.

427
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:13,066
(tires squealing) (glass
shattering)

428
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:15,732
(Rudi yells)

429
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,667
(Rudi sighs)

430
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:21,687
What kind of game is this?

431
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:23,533
This brakes don't work.

432
00:22:23,534 --> 00:22:25,232
It's not a game.

433
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:28,167
(creepy instrumental music)

434
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,466
Why are you doing this to me?

435
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:38,732
Oh, nothing personal.

436
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,467
It's just good business.

437
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,300
Have a nice trip, Rudi.

438
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,567
(engine roaring)

439
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:53,667
Help me!

440
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Help me, someone!

441
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,932
(glass shattering)

442
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:05,232
(light instrumental
music) (Rudi groans)

443
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:08,133
(light instrumental music)

444
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,466
(tires squealing) (Rudi
screaming)

445
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:21,533
(loud banging)

446
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:27,900
(engine rumbling)

447
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,267
(door slams)

448
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,833
(engine putters)

449
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:42,732
(papers rustling)

450
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,266
Pamela, you called?

451
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:45,499
Oh.

452
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,699
Yes.

453
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,980
Have you heard from Wynberg yet?

454
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,900
He should've received
the package by now.

455
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,366
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

456
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,666
There's been a delay with
delivery personnel.

457
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,799
You mean he hasn't
received it yet.

458
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,200
Well, it'll arrive
today for sure.

459
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:01,566
What time?

460
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:02,533
(dialing)

461
00:24:02,534 --> 00:24:03,899
Early afternoon.

462
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,532
Good.

463
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:06,767
Jim, early afternoon.

464
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:11,907
(laughs) No, of course we didn't
send it Federal Express.

465
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,533
(beeping)

466
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:19,399
About the tapes.

467
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,240
We did a computer analysis on
the Stylos tapes.

468
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:24,247
They were definitely recorded
under duress.

469
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:27,633
Well, we thought he was a man.

470
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,466
(door thuds closed)

471
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:34,967
(footsteps thudding)

472
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,532
Come here.

473
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:38,599
Gimme those.

474
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,999
I was gonna file those.

475
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,700
I know, I know.

476
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:42,199
Take this.

477
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,132
This package contains
highly confidential

478
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:46,666
documentation, level
three security.

479
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:47,766
You shouldn't even
be holding it.

480
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:49,366
No.

481
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:50,632
In fact, this is
really the FBI's business.

482
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:52,566
I shouldn't even be holding it.

483
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:55,032
I need this delivered
to Wynberg Mycronics

484
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:57,099
in Los Angeles, and I want
you to hand-deliver

485
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,099
it to Sam Wynberg,
no one else, okay?

486
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Okay.

487
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,899
I've booked you on a
10:30 flight to LA.

488
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,366
You're gonna arrive at 12:40.

489
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:10,766
You catch a cab, and you
deliver the package.

490
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,999
Wynberg's is about
35 minutes from the airport.

491
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,832
You depart LA at 2:30.

492
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,273
You'll be back home
by 10:30 tonight.

493
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,632
- Okay.
- Okay.

494
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:21,732
(papers rustling) Now
here is $200.

495
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:23,666
So go to LA, come back.

496
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:26,332
This was supposed to be
delivered yesterday.

497
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,299
The address is on the package.

498
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,832
You'll be home before anybody
realizes you've even left.

499
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,599
Look, don't let on
to anybody, - No.

500
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,732
- Especially Mrs. Lomax.
- Of course not.

501
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:38,999
- Can you handle this?
- Of course.

502
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Get outta here.

503
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:44,233
(plane engine roars)

504
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:51,066

What can I do for you?

517
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,332
Yes, we're here
to see Mr. Wynberg.

518
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,999
We are here to appeal
to his generosity

519
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,999
to help the starving,
underprivileged children of Bolivia.

520
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
Mr. Wynberg's real
busy right now.

521
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,732
However, our mission is
a most urgent one.

522
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:00,733
True, sister.

523
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,666
(dialing)

524
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,799
There are two people here
from St. Andrews

525
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,466
parish for underprivileged
children.

526
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:09,467
I'm on a deadline.

527
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:11,932
Have 'em come back tomorrow.

528
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:13,693
I'm sorry, but we
will be praying tomorrow.

529
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,732
Bless you, bless you.

530
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:19,013
I'm sorry, where were we, John?

531
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,813
John, let me call you back
a little later, okay?

532
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:25,899
Bye.

533
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,199
(clattering)

534
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,099
Sister, Father.

535
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,032
Well, ya caught
me at a bad time.

536
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:32,273
Well, this needn't take long.

537
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:36,900
(suspenseful instrumental music)

538
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,099
Is there something
I can do for you?

539
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,460
How about a donation
to the church?

540
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,966
Mr. Wynberg, we
were thinking about

541
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:55,247
something a little
more specific.

542
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
I don't understand.

543
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:07,999
We wish to acquire an
FAA security keycard from you.

544
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,099
The church will pay generously.

545
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,033
Oh, I'm sorry.

546
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:12,033
I can't help you.

547
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,066
- [Secretary] Mr.
- Wynberg, a Lance

548
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:16,466
Elliot is here with a package.

549
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:17,666
Excuse me.

550
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:18,999
Send him in.

551
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,699
This'll only take a minute.

552
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,299
(door clicks open)

553
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,132
Mr. Wynberg, package
for you, sir.

554
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:26,432
Thank ya, Lance.

555
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:27,699
Father, sister,
sorry to interrupt.

556
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,932
[Sam] Oh, Lance?

557
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:29,999
Sir?

558
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,299
Lance, take this.

559
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,300
That's not necessary.

560
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:34,900
Please, do.

561
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
Get some ice cream.

562
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:37,667
[Lance] Thank you.

563
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:42,499
(footsteps thudding)

564
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,466
(door clicks shut)

565
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:50,899
Okay, Wynberg, let's
cut the bullshit.

566
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,566
Now, we know that you are
cleared for level three security.

567
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,066
Hand over the key card.

568
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,699
I don't have one.

569
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,799
I only designed the system.

570
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
I don't use 'em.

571
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:01,932
Once last chance.

572
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:03,666
(suspenseful instrumental music)

573
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,067
Alright, take me
to the card file.

574
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,566
(Wynberg grunts)

575
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:07,567
Move it.

576
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,332
Listen, could you hold
all calls, please?

577
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,013
Because we're gonna
be praying for a while.

578
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,967
(suspenseful instrumental music)

579
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,633
(creepy instrumental music)

580
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:35,732
(thudding) (man grunts)

581
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,199

582
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,000
(thudding)

583
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Mr. Wynberg?

584
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:48,432
(thudding)

585
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:49,433
Confess, you prick.

586
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:52,166
Look, I used to
keep a card around

587
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,199
here, but I don't do it anymore.

588
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,032
Please, ya got to believe me.

589
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,266
Shit!

590
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:58,999
That kid!

591
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,080
He slipped it to the kid?

592
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,099
(suspenseful instrumental music)

593
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,099
You stupid bastard.

594
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,866
(thudding) (Wynberg groans)

595
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:11,032
(suspenseful instrumental music)

596
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:11,533
Mr. Wynberg, are you okay?

597
00:30:11,534 --> 00:30:13,232
(gasps)

598
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:15,932
Hello?

599
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:17,499
Hello?

600
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,300
(suspenseful instrumental music)

601

(heels clicking)

605
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Thank you.

606
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:39,866
You saved my life.

607
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:41,766
(girl panting)

608
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,047
Wait, don't you want my number?

609
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,666
(suspenseful instrumental music)

610
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:51,600
Okay, that's a
double cheeseburger,

611
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,899
a bacon and chili
burger, two fries,

612
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,499
a Diet Pepsi, and
a regular Pepsi.

613
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,500
That's $8.30.

614
00:30:57,967 --> 00:30:59,566
Here's a 10.

615
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:00,632
Keep the change.

616
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:01,633
Thanks.

617
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,399
(keys clacking)

618
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,999
A Lance Elliot,
he's 17 years old.

619
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,399
Male Caucasian.

620
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,333
231 Pinewood Road, Philadephia.

621
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,132
(suspenseful instrumental music)

622
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:22,966
(keys clacking)

623
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:27,432
(suspenseful instrumental music)

624
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:29,699

(suspenseful instrumental music)

628
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,232
(paper rustling)

629
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:52,632
Delivered package.

630
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,600
I think Wynberg is
in serious trouble.

631
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,633
Being pursued by a
nun and a priest.

632
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,832
Eagle.

633
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,233
This kid's living
on another planet.

634
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Did he make the plane?

635
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,566
(keys clacking)

636
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,099
Is he booked on
any flights home?

637
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,532
He missed the plane.

638
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:18,066
He could be anywhere in LA.

639
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:20,307
Shoulda nailed the little punk
when you had the chance.

640
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,100
Any relatives, friends, hotels?

641
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:30,999
(keys clacking)

642
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,733

643
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:36,433
(keys clacking)

644
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,399
(phone ringing)

645
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,399
Yep.

646
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,199
Yeah, we have a slight problem.

647
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,666
We had to terminate.

648
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,499
Also, a delivery
kid dropped off a package,

649
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,620
and we think that Wynberg
slipped the key card to him.

650
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:59,532
So you haven't got the key card?

651
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:00,813
No, Lance Elliot must have it.

652
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:04,432
Well, I assume that you'll
be sorting it out.

653
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:06,232
Of course.

654
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:08,332
There's another problem.

655
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:11,299
The airline computers require
a thumbprint ID.

656
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,299
Can't we generate the fingerprint
from the police files?

657
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,966
No time.

658
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:16,732
It's 29 hours 'till we kick off.

659
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,666
But I think we'll be alright.

660
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,666
Our FAA contact agreed
to sell us his thumbprint.

661
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:21,967
So take this down.

662
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:28,099
Meet a Dr. G. Radley at
the Los Angeles Zoo

663
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,666
tomorrow at 1:30 at
the Chimpanzees.

664
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:31,667
What is it?

665
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:33,332
1:30?

666
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:34,933
And take $20,000.

667
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:38,399
Alright.

668
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,033
Consider it done.

669
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:40,033
Okay.

670
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:43,432

today, and leave

677

for Atlanta to conclude their
3-month world tour.

678
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,199

businessmen predict

679
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,499
that the implementation of
the Green Report

680
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,620
could slide the world
into another economic recession.

take a ride through

intimate secrets.

687
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,666
Hi.

688
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,466
I need some room service.

689
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:51,699
Yes, I need, why
don't you give me

690
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,432
a hamburger, come
with French Fries?

693
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:01,067
May I have your keys?

694
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:04,699
May I have your keys?

695
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,220
Look, I'm sorry, I
got to move the car.

696
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,067

Well, welcome to Los Angeles.

00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:34,200
(upbeat instrumental music)

925
00:47:38,933 --> 00:47:40,799
(crashing)

926
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,733
(upbeat instrumental music)

927
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,099
(kids shouting)

928
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,033
(upbeat instrumental music)

929
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:59,433
(boy shouts)

930
00:48:02,733 --> 00:48:04,032
(boy screams)

931
00:48:04,033 --> 00:48:06,166
(crashing)

932
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:08,632
(upbeat instrumental music)

933
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:12,900
(cart thudding) (boy yells)

934
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,732
(kids yelling)

935
00:48:15,733 --> 00:48:17,366

941
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:40,900
(suspenseful instrumental music)

942
00:48:45,533 --> 00:48:47,866
What the hell was
that all about?

943
00:48:47,867 --> 00:48:51,266
(blades scraping ground)

944
00:48:51,267 --> 00:48:54,600
(suspenseful instrumental music)

945
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,799
Okay, I'm really
sorry about this.

946
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,132
You must've really pissed
those guys off.

947
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:03,266
Yeah, I guess so.

948
00:49:03,267 --> 00:49:06,600
(suspenseful instrumental music)

949
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,599
Shit.

950
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,866
Now what are we gonna do?

951
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:18,132
(suspenseful instrumental music)

952
00:49:18,133 --> 00:49:20,966
(kids shouting)

953
00:49:20,967 --> 00:49:23,932
(suspenseful instrumental music)

954
00:49:23,933 --> 00:49:25,767
(clicking)

955
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,767
(suspenseful instrumental music)

956
00:49:41,067 --> 00:49:42,699
(hissing)

957
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,566
(suspenseful instrumental music)

958
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,899
(hissing)

959
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,267
(suspenseful instrumental music)

960
00:49:57,467 --> 00:49:59,667
(kids shouting)

961
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,432
(flames whooshing)

962
00:50:05,433 --> 00:50:07,932
(kids shouting)

963
00:50:07,933 --> 00:50:11,267
(suspenseful instrumental music)

964
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,932
(engine roars)

965
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:21,499

00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,267
(engine rumbling)

975
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,400
(engine roars)

976
00:51:01,233 --> 00:51:02,432
Where are we?

977
00:51:02,433 --> 00:51:03,433
Downtown somewhere.

978
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,367
Listen, I appreciate your help.

979
00:51:06,368 --> 00:51:07,499
I got to get out of here.

980
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,799
Hey, wait a minute.

981
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,666
Now, I think you
are forgetting something here.

982
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,166
Right.

983
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:13,167
I'm sorry.

984
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:14,167
And the groceries, huh?

985
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,900
(rustling)

986
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,067
Here.

987
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:22,033
Alright, bye.

988
00:51:22,033 --> 00:51:23,033
Hey, wait a minute.

989
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,532
You know, we haven't
even introduced ourselves.

990
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:27,433
Elliot.

991
00:51:27,434 --> 00:51:28,832
Lance Elliot.

992
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,066
Melinda Blake.

993
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:31,067
It's a pleasure.

994
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:33,033
(rustling)

995
00:51:33,034 --> 00:51:34,732
Hey.

996
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:35,999
You know, you almost
got us killed.

997
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,132
Yeah, but I didn't.

998
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:38,832
You're fine and I'm fine.

999
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,673
Yeah, well, thanks
to me, because I saved us.

1000
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:43,499
You know, that little
stunt you pulled.

1001
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,566
I could sue you.

1002
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:46,967
Or have you arrested,
you know that?

1003
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:50,366
Let's see.

1004
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:52,532
Reckless behavior,
disturbing the peace.

1005
00:51:52,533 --> 00:51:53,613
Damage to private property.

1006
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,332
(bag rustles)

1007
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:57,653
Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.

1008
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,132
What do you want?

1009
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:00,967
Half.

1010
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:01,933
Half?

1011
00:52:01,934 --> 00:52:03,366
I can't do that.

1012
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:05,066
Oh, no, you mean you
don't wanna do it.

1013
00:52:05,067 --> 00:52:06,000
No, no, I mean I can't
do that 'cause it's not mine.

1014
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:07,699
Well, if it's not yours, then

1015
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,900
why did you just give me $300?

1016
00:52:10,767 --> 00:52:11,433
(Lance sighs)

1017
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:12,367
Oh.

1018
00:52:12,368 --> 00:52:13,499
I get it.

1019
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,099
You stole this money, and that's

1020
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,999
why those guys are chasing you.

1021
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,800
It's not as bad as it seems.

1022
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,999
I don't have time for this.

1023
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,933
I have to go.

1024
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:20,500
Can I have my money?

1025
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:21,866
Please?

1026
00:52:21,867 --> 00:52:24,027
No, I wanna know
what's going on.

1027
00:52:24,533 --> 00:52:26,999
That's classified information.

1028
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,233
If I tell you, I'm gonna
have to kill you.

1029
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,967
(light instrumental music)

1030
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,800
Hey, where you going?

1031
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,733
I can't say.

1032
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:40,733
Why not?

1033
00:52:40,734 --> 00:52:41,832
It's confidential.

1034
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:42,966
Well, I'm going with you.

1035
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:43,833
Okay.

1036
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:45,232
Good.

1037
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:48,133
(light instrumental music)

1038
00:53:02,067 --> 00:53:05,132
(elephant trumpeting)

1039
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:08,033
(light instrumental music)

1040
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,532
(bird cawing)

1041
00:53:14,533 --> 00:53:15,866
(light instrumental music)

1042
00:53:15,867 --> 00:53:18,366
(elephant trumpets)

1043
00:53:18,367 --> 00:53:20,766
(light instrumental music)

1044
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:23,167
(elephant trumpets)

1045
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,232
So who are we supposed
to meet, anyway?

1046
00:53:27,233 --> 00:53:29,099
I don't know.

1047
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,460
You don't know
who we're meeting?

1048
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:33,932
No, not exactly.

1049
00:53:33,933 --> 00:53:36,866
But I know when we
see him, we'll know.

1050
00:53:36,867 --> 00:53:38,566
You know, there must be
something you're not telling me.

1051
00:53:38,567 --> 00:53:40,599
I mean, for all I
know, there could

1052
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,266
be like this drug deal going
down or something.

1053
00:53:42,267 --> 00:53:43,233
You're out of your mind.

1054
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:44,233
It's not a drug deal.

1055
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,967
(light instrumental music)

1056
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:52,400
(monkeys chattering)

1057
00:53:55,867 --> 00:53:58,267
(people chattering)

1058
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:04,266
This is the time it said.

1059
00:54:04,267 --> 00:54:05,932
Now all we have to do is look

1060
00:54:05,933 --> 00:54:07,632
for someone suspicious-looking.

1061
00:54:07,633 --> 00:54:10,033
(chimps chattering)

1062
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,899
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1063
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:17,900
That guy over there.

1064
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,232
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1065
00:54:21,233 --> 00:54:24,432
(chimps chattering)

1066
00:54:24,433 --> 00:54:26,166
Just stay here.

1067
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:29,866
(footsteps thudding)

1068
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,267
(chimps chattering)

1069
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,100
(chimp squeals)

1070
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,933
Jesus, Lance.

1071
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:45,199
What's going on?

1072
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,999
I mean, you don't
know who you're

1073
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,466
supposed to meet,
what for, or even

1074
00:54:49,467 --> 00:54:51,499
where you're supposed
to meet him.

1075
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,220
I mean, for all you know,
it could be a her.

1076
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,333
Yeah, it could be, huh?

1077
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:58,266
(Melinda scoffs)

1078
00:54:58,267 --> 00:54:59,267
I don't believe you.

1079
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,032
Excuse me.

1080
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,799
Excuse me.

1081
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,266
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1082
00:55:06,267 --> 00:55:07,799
Shit.

1083
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,767
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1084
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:09,700
(both yelling)

1085
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,500
(footsteps thudding)

1086
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:12,667
(chimp squeals)

1087
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:17,500
Don't look back,
don't look back.

1088
00:55:17,501 --> 00:55:18,799
He was dead.

1089
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,667
Oh my god.

1090
00:55:19,668 --> 00:55:21,199
He was dead.

1091
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:21,967
That explains why
he missed the appointment.

1092
00:55:21,968 --> 00:55:23,966
Yeah, but it doesn't explain
why he was dead.

1093
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:25,032
(both panting)

1094
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:25,967
These guys are playing dirty.

1095
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:26,967
Oh god, his thumb was gone.

1096
00:55:26,968 --> 00:55:28,532
Did you see that?

1097
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,932
Somebody cut his thumb off.

1098
00:55:29,933 --> 00:55:30,100
That's one way of
getting a thumb print.

1099
00:55:30,101 --> 00:55:31,832
What?

1100
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:33,266
Forget it, nothing, let's
just keep moving.

1101
00:55:33,267 --> 00:55:35,066
Shit, Lance.

1102
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:35,733
I think somebody's following us.

1103
00:55:35,733 --> 00:55:36,733
Don't look back.

1104
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:39,166
But I think someone is
really following us.

1105
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:39,900
Yeah, I know someone's
following us.

1106
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:40,966
You know?

1107
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:41,733
How long's he been there?

1108
00:55:41,734 --> 00:55:43,266
Since the chimps.

1109
00:55:43,267 --> 00:55:44,332
Oh my god, do you
think he has a gun?

1110
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:45,799
Probably.

1111
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,567
Oh, shit, let's run.

1112
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:47,400
No, let's not run.

1113
00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:48,899
Just be calm.

1114
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,632
We're gonna go right
here and just hide, ready?

1115
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:52,199
Go, go, go, go!

1116
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,567
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1117
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:07,700
Freeze, dirt bag.

1118
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:10,366
You got a piece?

1119
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,232
(gun clicks)

1120
00:56:12,233 --> 00:56:13,033
Turn around really slow.

1121
00:56:13,033 --> 00:56:13,767
No, don't shoot.

1122
00:56:13,768 --> 00:56:14,799
Don't shoot.

1123
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,866
Trout!

1124
00:56:15,867 --> 00:56:16,700
Lance, Trout.

1125
00:56:16,701 --> 00:56:18,566
What are you?

1126
00:56:18,567 --> 00:56:19,533
The hell do you
think you're up to?

1127
00:56:19,534 --> 00:56:21,599
- What are you doing...?
- Are you

1128
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,966
- completely out of your mind?
- You

1129
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:24,432
know him?

1130
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:25,433
Did you hear me?

1131
00:56:25,434 --> 00:56:26,899
I said get straight back.

1132
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,066
Nobody was to know.

1133
00:56:29,067 --> 00:56:30,332
Now everybody knows.

1134
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:31,599
The FBI knows, I got
Lomax all over me,

1135
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,599
my job is on the,

1136
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,966
Who is this?

1137
00:56:34,967 --> 00:56:36,466
Melinda, Melinda, Trout.

1138
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:39,066
And your mother
is completely hysterical.

1139
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:41,199
Trout, I'm onto something
really big here.

1140
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,033
- Yeah, really big.
- Forget it.

1141
00:56:42,034 --> 00:56:43,099
I don't know what game you think

1142
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,166
you're playing, but it's over.

1143
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:47,299
I'm putting you on the
first plane back.

1144
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,032
Just say goodbye to
your girlfriend.

1145
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:50,666
- He's not my boyfriend.
- She's not my girlfriend.

1146
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:52,132
What is the matter with you?

1147
00:56:52,133 --> 00:56:53,466
What is this, what
is this, what is

1148
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:56,199
this strange little
espionage life?

1149
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,332
We're going this way.

1150
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:02,333
(birds chirping) (suspenseful
music)

1151
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,566
Lomax is gonna have
your job, my job.

1152
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:13,032
Don't tell Lomax.

1153
00:57:13,033 --> 00:57:15,132
Tell her nothing.

1154
00:57:15,133 --> 00:57:16,173
You better not have tried.

1155
00:57:18,033 --> 00:57:19,199
- See!
- Let's get out...

1156
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,440
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1157
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:25,266
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1158
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:26,799
What are you doing?

1159
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,166
Come on.

1160
00:57:28,167 --> 00:57:29,832
Wait a minute,
Lance, Lance, come on.

1161
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:31,399
Stop this.

1162
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,599
Lance!

1163
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,832
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1164
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:36,866
Alligators!

1165
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:40,800
(upbeat instrumental
music) (Melinda screams)

1166
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,132
(footsteps thudding)

1167
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:48,266
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1168
00:57:48,267 --> 00:57:50,432
(footsteps thudding)

1169
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:52,366
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1170
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:55,666
(footsteps thudding)

1171
00:57:55,667 --> 00:57:57,799
(men yelling)

1172
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,866
(alligator grunts)

1173
00:57:58,867 --> 00:58:00,732
(bird cawing)

1174
00:58:00,733 --> 00:58:02,299
(yelling)

1175
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,966
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1176
00:58:03,967 --> 00:58:05,632
(man yelling)

1177
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:08,967
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1178
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:12,133
Why did you guys interfere?

1179
00:58:12,134 --> 00:58:13,174
You made the kid run away.

1180
00:58:16,133 --> 00:58:17,133
Who's the brat to you?

1181
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,067
Seamus Muh-goh-ick-uh-tee of
zoo security.

1182
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:27,373
You wouldn't believe the kind of
things that happen here.

1183
00:58:28,767 --> 00:58:30,127
We're trying to
protect the animals

1184
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,732
from reckless
behavior, these kids

1185
00:58:32,733 --> 00:58:34,800
that come, feeding
the chimps with junk food.

1186
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:40,066
(elephant trumpets) (monkeys
squealing)

1187
00:58:40,067 --> 00:58:41,187
You guys got a problem here?

1188
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,199
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1189
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,120
It's getting a little crowded
around here, hmm?

1190
00:58:53,733 --> 00:58:54,733
Let's go.

1191
00:58:59,267 --> 00:59:02,633
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1192
00:59:04,633 --> 00:59:07,100
(car engine rumbles)

1193
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,267
(footsteps thudding)

1194
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,166
Lance, come on!

1195
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:15,832
Lance!

1196
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:16,999
Come on, get over here.

1197
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Move it.

1198
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:21,466
We'll take care of you.

1199
00:59:21,467 --> 00:59:22,433
Come on, get in here.

1200
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:23,566
Get 'em out out of here, now!

1201
00:59:23,567 --> 00:59:24,567
Move it!

1202
00:59:28,033 --> 00:59:30,367
(car engine roars)

1203
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:33,300
You okay?

1204
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,200
Yeah, think so.

1205
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,167
You?

1206
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:36,033
I'm okay.

1207
00:59:36,033 --> 00:59:37,000
It was close.

1208
00:59:37,001 --> 00:59:38,166
It was too close.
- I

1209
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:39,443
hope that guy's
gonna be alright.

1210
00:59:39,467 --> 00:59:40,433
Who, Trout?

1211
00:59:40,433 --> 00:59:41,400
It's gonna be fine.

1212
00:59:41,401 --> 00:59:42,432
He can take care of himself.

1213
00:59:42,433 --> 00:59:43,666
(Melinda panting)

1214
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:45,099
You know, I really
wish you would

1215
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,140
let me know what's
going on here.

1216
00:59:48,133 --> 00:59:49,100
I'm with the CIA.

1217
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,100
I'm a new recruit.

1218
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,220
This right here, this is
why we're being chased, okay?

1219
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:57,366
All that fuss for this?

1220
00:59:57,367 --> 00:59:59,832
Well this, this breaks into

1221
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:01,113
some pretty
heavy-duty computers.

1222
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,399
Sorry I drug you into all this.

1223
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,266
It's alright.

1224
01:00:07,267 --> 01:00:08,667
It's actually been
kind of exciting.

1225
01:00:11,933 --> 01:00:15,666
(car engine roars)

1226
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:16,999
So what are you gonna do now?

1227
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Probably go back
to Philly and try

1228
01:00:18,001 --> 01:00:19,081
to explain this whole mess.

1229
01:00:20,733 --> 01:00:21,899
Yeah, well, I kind of figured

1230
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,180
things weren't going as planned.

1231
01:00:24,767 --> 01:00:25,767
It could be worse.

1232
01:00:27,033 --> 01:00:29,933
(light instrumental music)

1233
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,567
(gun clicks)

1234
01:00:49,033 --> 01:00:51,299
So, where are we going?

1235
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,732
Excuse me.

1236
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:53,733
Where are we going?

1237
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,400
Shit.

1238
01:00:57,633 --> 01:01:00,532
(popping) (popping)

1239
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:03,900
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1240
01:01:08,067 --> 01:01:10,400
(car engine roars)

1241
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:14,032
We're at the zoo.

1242
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:16,632
Trout, now, listen
to me very carefully.

1243
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:17,799
You found him once.

1244
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,899
You can find him again.

1245
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,066
It's gonna be difficult.

1246
01:01:22,067 --> 01:01:24,066
And Trout, I don't need to tell

1247
01:01:24,067 --> 01:01:27,666
you this is to be kept quiet,
no FBI, no local cops.

1248
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:29,033
Just you and Lance.

1249
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:35,132
(phone clicks) (birds singing)

1250
01:01:35,133 --> 01:01:37,433
(engine rumbles)

1251
01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:43,633
(door clicks open) (heels
clack on bricks)

1252
01:01:47,067 --> 01:01:49,499
(door clicks open)

1253
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,233
(heels clack on bricks)

1254
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:56,333
(door squeaks)

1255
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,999
(computer beeping)

1256
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,233
(keys clacking)

1257
01:02:05,967 --> 01:02:07,399
(switch clicking)

1258
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,600
(keys clacking)

1259
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,967
[Cashpot] Hmm.

1260
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,900
Hey, hey.

1261
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:20,266
(Melinda groans)

1262
01:02:20,267 --> 01:02:21,267
You okay?

1263
01:02:21,268 --> 01:02:22,366
Oh, where are we?

1264
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:23,367
I don't know.

1265
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:25,466
What happened?

1266
01:02:25,467 --> 01:02:26,467
I don't understand.

1267
01:02:28,367 --> 01:02:30,366
Those guys that picked us up

1268
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:31,766
in the limo, they
weren't with the CIA.

1269
01:02:31,767 --> 01:02:33,732
I mean, I should have known.

1270
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:35,366
Goddamnit, how could I
have been so stupid?

1271
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:38,066
I thought they were with Trout.

1272
01:02:38,067 --> 01:02:39,947
Obviously that's what they
wanted us to think.

1273
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:43,133
(car engine rumbles)

1274
01:02:47,033 --> 01:02:49,499
(doors click open)

1275
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,800
(doors thudding)

1276
01:02:54,367 --> 01:02:56,299
(door slams)

1277
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,699
(shoes clacking on bricks)

1278
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,433
(briefcase clicks open)

1279
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,699
A six million dollar deposit.

1280
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,732
We will provide
the remaining six

1281
01:03:09,733 --> 01:03:11,400
when the plane crash
is completed.

1282
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:16,567
Now, this is the part I enjoy.

1283
01:03:21,367 --> 01:03:23,733
Is Rudi Kseenbaum joining us?

1284
01:03:25,633 --> 01:03:28,166
Well, didn't you hear?

1285
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:31,032
He was crushed in a
most unfortunate car accident.

1286
01:03:31,033 --> 01:03:32,033
Just two days ago.

1287
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,632
(heels clacking)

1288
01:03:36,633 --> 01:03:37,200
(speaking in foreign language)

1289
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:39,266
Well, darling.

1290
01:03:39,267 --> 01:03:40,999
Sorry to be breaking up
your little party,

1291
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,632
but we should be linking up
in about 15 minutes.

1292
01:03:42,633 --> 01:03:46,066
Well, Rhonda, this is
Martin Luh-buh-son.

1293
01:03:46,067 --> 01:03:47,932
And this is Mr. Tim
Lacey, his associate.

1294
01:03:47,933 --> 01:03:49,932
- Pleasure to meet you.
- They've been

1295
01:03:49,933 --> 01:03:52,099
sent by the consortium to
observe our progress.

1296
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,032
I was explaining to Martin that
we've had a slight delay.

1297
01:03:55,033 --> 01:03:57,899
Yes, but everything is under
control and on schedule.

1298
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,900
Well, let's go, then.

1299
01:04:00,033 --> 01:04:01,332
Let's do it.

1300
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:02,632
Thank you, gentlemen.

1301
01:04:02,633 --> 01:04:04,099
Shall I take care
of this for you, sir?

1302
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,466
You keep a beady little eye
on that, now, Eddy.

1303
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:07,467
Yes sir.

1304
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:11,300
(footsteps thudding)

1305
01:04:14,733 --> 01:04:16,066
(door slamming)

1306
01:04:16,067 --> 01:04:18,567
(footsteps thudding)

1307
01:04:21,133 --> 01:04:23,400
(machine beeping)

1308
01:04:26,267 --> 01:04:28,099
The children have woken.

1309
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,399
(machine beeps)

1310
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,066
Mr. Lance Elliot.

1311
01:04:33,067 --> 01:04:34,932
I've waited for this moment.

1312
01:04:34,933 --> 01:04:35,933
I am Cashpot.

1313
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,566
And your companion?

1314
01:04:38,567 --> 01:04:39,766
Melinda.

1315
01:04:39,767 --> 01:04:41,632
She's not a part
of this, though.

1316
01:04:41,633 --> 01:04:42,753
Well, of course she's not.

1317
01:04:45,433 --> 01:04:47,432
And she'll be
treated accordingly. (chuckles)

1318
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:48,732
(man laughs)

1319
01:04:48,733 --> 01:04:50,366
Gentlemen, I would
very much like

1320
01:04:50,367 --> 01:04:52,732
you to meet my good
friend Melinda,

1321
01:04:52,733 --> 01:04:56,533
and secret agent in
training, shh, Mr. Lance Elliot.

1322
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:00,866
I think you probably
deserve to know

1323
01:05:00,867 --> 01:05:03,532
what all this fuss
has been about.

1324
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:06,167
(plane engine roaring)

1325
01:05:08,733 --> 01:05:12,332
(satellite whirring)

1326
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:15,332
(beeping)

1327
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:16,399
The plane carrying the
Science Committee

1328
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,066
is now flying
approximately here.

1329
01:05:19,067 --> 01:05:20,532
Well, in about
seven minutes, the

1330
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:22,099
plane will be moving
into the region

1331
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,300
known as the Bermuda Triangle.

1332
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,566
As we speak,
these environmental scientists

1333
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:33,532
are probably being served lunch.

1334
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:37,999
Filet mignon, Crème de
Champignon, and red wine sauce.

1335
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,666
Or perhaps some
grilled sole squeezed

1336
01:05:40,667 --> 01:05:43,067
with a slice of fresh
lemon (laughs)

1337
01:05:45,033 --> 01:05:47,066
Is there some point
to all of this?

1338
01:05:47,067 --> 01:05:49,332
As you know, I'm in the business

1339
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:51,266
of designing very specific
computer viruses,

1340
01:05:51,267 --> 01:05:52,966
and for today's
operation, we have

1341
01:05:52,967 --> 01:05:54,247
designed a virus
to intercept the

1342
01:05:55,933 --> 01:05:57,532
flying controls and cause
the plane to crash.

1343
01:05:57,533 --> 01:05:58,599
(men laughing)

1344
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,799
Mighty nice, eh?

1345
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,840
Rhonda will demonstrate.

1346
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:06,566
(keys clacking)

1347
01:06:06,567 --> 01:06:10,933
(squealing) (beeping)

1348
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,499
Ah. (clapping)

1349
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,232
So you're gonna kill
all these people?

1350
01:06:17,233 --> 01:06:18,432
That's the general idea.

1351
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:19,333
(computer beeping)

1352
01:06:19,334 --> 01:06:20,966
How can you do that?

1353
01:06:20,967 --> 01:06:22,332
Those men are trying
to save our environment.

1354
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:23,333
How sweet.

1355
01:06:24,867 --> 01:06:26,200
You really are so naive.

1356
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,999
These praised scientists are
only doing this for themselves.

1357
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,666
Not to help you. (laughs)

1358
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:34,667
Or the planet.

1359
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:37,466
And this virus?

1360
01:06:37,467 --> 01:06:40,732
Yes, what about this virus?

1361
01:06:40,733 --> 01:06:43,332
Well, if it's so powerful, you
can infect other planes.

1362
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:46,132
So what is your point?

1363
01:06:46,133 --> 01:06:48,453
My point is you'll be killing
hundreds of innocent people.

1364
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,566
(laughs) Killing
innocent people.

1365
01:06:51,567 --> 01:06:53,966
You know, let me tell
you something, my little friend.

1366
01:06:53,967 --> 01:06:56,066
There's only one problem
with this planet.

1367
01:06:56,067 --> 01:06:58,266
Overpopulation.

1368
01:06:58,267 --> 01:07:00,267
This world is a vortex
of degradation.

1369
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,966
A cesspool of
corruption and greed.

1370
01:07:04,967 --> 01:07:06,532
Billions are
starving, others are

1371
01:07:06,533 --> 01:07:08,766
gorging themselves into a
consumer oblivion.

1372
01:07:08,767 --> 01:07:12,099
Man is the cancer of the globe.

1373
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,299
(laughs) And you're
worried about a

1374
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,499
few thousand people dying
in plain crashes.

1375
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,467
Well, personally, I
don't give a shit.

1376
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,866
(beeping)

1377
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:24,399
Man, you need some serious help.

1378
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,732
Alright.

1379
01:07:25,733 --> 01:07:27,632
That does it.

1380
01:07:27,633 --> 01:07:29,566
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1381
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:31,632
(footsteps thudding)

1382
01:07:31,633 --> 01:07:34,967
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1383
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:41,499
(door slams)

1384
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,767
(creepy laughter)

1385
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:49,333
[Melinda] No, no!

1386
01:07:53,533 --> 01:07:56,632
Now this game, you have to find

1387
01:07:56,633 --> 01:07:59,332
your way through the tunnels of

1388
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:01,567
the pyramid into
Truh-ih-puh-tuh-on Commons Tomb.

1389
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,666
That sounds like fine.

1390
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:07,500
Oh, yes, it's great fun.

1391
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:11,613
Especially if
you're not playing.

1392
01:08:12,967 --> 01:08:15,167
(evil laughter)

1393
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,366
Wait a second,
no practice round?

1394
01:08:20,367 --> 01:08:22,832
Wouldn't do ya any good.

1395
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,593
No one's ever made it out
of this room alive.

1396
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:29,466
Good to know.

1397
01:08:29,467 --> 01:08:31,300
[Man] Welcome to Cashpot's
Pyramid of Doom.

1398
01:08:33,133 --> 01:08:37,132
(light instrumental music)

1399
01:08:37,133 --> 01:08:40,332
(evil laughter)

1400
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,333
Crazy bastard.

1401
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,399
[Man] Naferatutu is your guide.

1402
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,099
Using your control,
lead him through

1403
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:52,399
the passages of
time, for only he

1404
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,733
can save you from the
obstacles of doom.

1405
01:08:57,067 --> 01:08:59,166
(footsteps thudding)

1406
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:01,432
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1407
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:03,633
(door creaking)

1408
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:09,699
(door slams shut)

1409
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,667
(clattering)

1410
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:17,533
(suspenseful instrumental music)

1411
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:23,766
Shit.

1412
01:09:23,767 --> 01:09:25,967
(axes whirring)

1413
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,099
(game beeping)

1414
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,300
(machine beeps)

1415
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,032
Locking in satellite position.

1416
01:09:42,033 --> 01:09:43,033
Locking in.

1417
01:09:44,433 --> 01:09:46,233
Gentlemen, the excitement is
about to begin.

1418
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:49,766
(grunting)

1419
01:09:49,767 --> 01:09:51,967
(keys clacking)

1420
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:55,653
We've intercepted
and have control

1421
01:09:56,733 --> 01:09:57,853
of the satellite, gentlemen.

1422
01:09:58,533 --> 01:10:00,832
(game beeping)

1423
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:03,466
(whirring)

1424
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:06,500
(ominous instrumental music)

1425
01:10:08,133 --> 01:10:11,266
(rattling)

1426
01:10:11,267 --> 01:10:14,300
(ominous instrumental music)

1427
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,766
(clattering)

1428
01:10:18,767 --> 01:10:21,767
(ominous instrumental music)

1429
01:10:31,567 --> 01:10:35,032
(Lance panting)

1430
01:10:35,033 --> 01:10:38,067
(ominous instrumental music)

1431
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:40,900
Key card?

1432
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,066
Okay.

1433
01:10:44,067 --> 01:10:45,566
Now to gain access
to the airline

1434
01:10:45,567 --> 01:10:47,332
communication
system and wait for

1435
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:48,453
it to to track flight QS337.

1436
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,199
(card scraping machine)

1437
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,266
(beeping)

1438
01:10:54,267 --> 01:10:56,332
(keys clacking)

1439
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:59,332
(beeping)

1440
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:01,866
(rattling)

1441
01:11:01,867 --> 01:11:03,332
[Man] Congratulations.

1442
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:04,366
You survived the
chamber of death

1443
01:11:04,367 --> 01:11:05,447
and entered the royal tomb.

1444
01:11:07,467 --> 01:11:10,599
But 3,000 years of purification

1445
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,566
have produced a
highly toxic gas.

1446
01:11:13,567 --> 01:11:16,432
(ominous instrumental music)

1447
01:11:16,433 --> 01:11:19,899
(gas hissing)

1448
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,933
(ominous instrumental music)

1449
01:11:29,233 --> 01:11:31,033
(creaking)

1450
01:11:34,367 --> 01:11:36,532
(footsteps thudding)

1451
01:11:36,533 --> 01:11:37,599
Sweet thing.

1452
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,199
Sorry I treated you so bad.

1453
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,200
Just doing my job.

1454
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:44,766
And now they're
so busy up there,

1455
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:47,367
we can both use a
little time out. (laughs)

1456
01:11:49,367 --> 01:11:52,232
(shovel clanging) (man grunting)

1457
01:11:52,233 --> 01:11:56,132
(ominous instrumental music)

1458
01:11:56,133 --> 01:11:57,666
(whirring)

1459
01:11:57,667 --> 01:11:59,667
(gas hissing)

1460
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,666
(beeping)

1461
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:05,667
Entering codes.

1462
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,333
(gas hissing)

1463
01:12:15,633 --> 01:12:17,599
(clanging)

1464
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,866
(ominous instrumental music)

1465
01:12:19,867 --> 01:12:21,666
(Lance panting)

1466
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:23,033
Now get me out of here!

1467
01:12:24,733 --> 01:12:26,467
(beeping)

1468
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,566
[Woman] Codes accepted.

1469
01:12:30,567 --> 01:12:31,567
The thumb?

1470
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:36,066
(clattering)

1471
01:12:36,067 --> 01:12:37,800
(beeping)

1472
01:12:45,167 --> 01:12:46,967
(thudding)

1473
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,799
(whirring)

1474
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,533
(beeping)

1475
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:06,933
We're in!

1476
01:13:06,934 --> 01:13:08,732
(beeping)

1477
01:13:08,733 --> 01:13:10,766
(clapping)
- Ha-ha, yes!

1478
01:13:10,767 --> 01:13:12,366
(beeping)

1479
01:13:12,367 --> 01:13:14,287
Gentlemen, we've entered flight
QS337's computer.

1480
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,932
(plane engine roaring)

1481
01:13:20,933 --> 01:13:24,900
We're flying at an
altitude of 31,266 feet

1482
01:13:25,867 --> 01:13:29,432
at a speed of 617 miles per hour

1483
01:13:29,433 --> 01:13:32,267
against a crosswind of 26 knots.

1484
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,566
Gentlemen, the world
is about to witness

1485
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:42,133
another mysterious phenomenon.

1486
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:50,632
(beeping)

1487
01:13:50,633 --> 01:13:53,799
Stand-by for virus transmission.

1488
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,366
(machine whirring)

1489
01:13:57,367 --> 01:13:58,600
10, nine, eight, seven.

1490
01:14:00,733 --> 01:14:01,966
(loud whirring)

1491
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:02,833
Get the screens back.

1492
01:14:02,834 --> 01:14:04,832
I have to see this.

1493
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:06,032
We've lost satellite
communication.

1494
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:07,033
We've lost the link.

1495
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,599
What?

1496
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,267
How could that happen?

1497
01:14:10,268 --> 01:14:11,366
Wait, shut down!

1498
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:12,367
Now, immediately!

1499
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,366
(man laughs)

1500
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,299
What happened?

1501
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,766
Just a precaution, gentlemen.

1502
01:14:17,767 --> 01:14:18,899
A virus without a
path through it

1503
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,633
might backfire into
our own system.

1504
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,166
(man grumbling)

1505
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:25,632
It's the satellite.

1506
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:26,999
Oh. (laughs)

1507
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Not to worry, gentlemen.

1508
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,399
It's a minor malfunction.

1509
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,399
Probably just a loose
connection. (laughs)

1510
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,666
(keys clacking)

1511
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:37,266
(ominous instrumental music)

1512
01:14:37,267 --> 01:14:38,100
It's him.

1513
01:14:38,101 --> 01:14:39,399
It's Lance.

1514
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,899
He's destroying the
satellite dish.

1515
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,566
How did he get out of there?

1516
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:44,232
This is impossible.

1517
01:14:44,233 --> 01:14:45,167
It's impossible, it's
impossible, it's

1518
01:14:45,168 --> 01:14:46,432
(slapping)

1519
01:14:46,433 --> 01:14:49,399
(ominous instrumental music)

1520
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,866
(whirring) (footsteps thudding)

1521
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:53,932
(ominous instrumental music)

1522
01:14:53,933 --> 01:14:55,399
Get Tyler.

1523
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,066
The kid's out.

1524
01:14:57,067 --> 01:14:59,132
Find him, shoot him
on sight, squash

1525
01:14:59,133 --> 01:15:00,632
him, cut him into
a million pieces,

1526
01:15:00,633 --> 01:15:02,832
I don't care what you do,
just get rid of him.

1527
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:04,299
Now, this is outrageous.

1528
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,166
I didn't pay you
millions of dollars to...

1529
01:15:07,167 --> 01:15:09,033
Oh, will you stop bleating
like a lost goat?

1530
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
It's all under control.

1531
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:16,300
See, gentlemen?

1532
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,240
Tea and strawberry scones in
the computer room.

1533
01:15:26,533 --> 01:15:28,293
Let's lock into the backup
dish and continue.

1534
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,166
(keys clacking)

1535
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:32,666
(beeping)

1536
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:35,667
(ominous instrumental music)

1537
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,800
(gate squeaking)

1538
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,266
(gun clicking)

1539
01:15:51,267 --> 01:15:54,666
(ominous instrumental music)

1540
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:56,267
We should've done
this a long time ago.

1541
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,999
(footsteps thudding)

1542
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,399
(ominous instrumental music)

1543
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,867
(footsteps thudding)

1544
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:18,099
(Lance panting)

1545
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:18,800
We got to get out of here
and get some help.

1546
01:16:18,801 --> 01:16:20,632
Yeah, easy for you to say.

1547
01:16:20,633 --> 01:16:21,467
They've got guys everywhere.

1548
01:16:21,468 --> 01:16:23,632
- I know.
- And they have guns.

1549
01:16:23,633 --> 01:16:26,132
- I know.
- And we don't.

1550
01:16:26,133 --> 01:16:28,399
(sighs) I know.

1551
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,132
(ominous instrumental music)

1552
01:16:32,133 --> 01:16:34,032
(gun clicking) (footsteps
thudding)

1553
01:16:34,033 --> 01:16:36,832
Ooh, I'm glad to see you kids
are still hanging around.

1554
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:38,833
(Lance sighs)

1555
01:16:40,733 --> 01:16:41,733
Ah.

1556
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,066
(keys clacking)

1557
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:45,167
Satellite link complete.

1558
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,932
Let's get back into the flight.

1559
01:16:49,933 --> 01:16:52,133
(keys clacking)

1560
01:16:57,967 --> 01:16:59,700
(beeping)

1561
01:17:02,233 --> 01:17:05,267
(ominous instrumental music)

1562
01:17:07,733 --> 01:17:08,799
Oh, my ankle.

1563
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,199
(man groans)

1564
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:14,433
(man screaming) (thudding)

1565
01:17:15,867 --> 01:17:17,066
Hey!

1566
01:17:17,067 --> 01:17:18,966
Hold it!

1567
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:21,832
(ominous instrumental music)
Hey!

1568
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:23,633
(grunting)

1569
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,600
Hey!

1570
01:17:33,167 --> 01:17:35,533
(locking clicking)

1571
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:38,666
(ominous instrumental music)
Open the door!

1572
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:42,933
(banging) (loud clattering)

1573
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:48,399
Hey, what the
hell's happening out there?

1574
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,099
[Man] It's Lance
and the girl, sir.

1575
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,932
They've locked themselves in
the games room.

1576
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:52,933
What do we do now?

1577
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,199
Well, they can't go anywhere.

1578
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,280
We'll deal with them later.

1579
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,232
(creaking)

1580
01:18:02,233 --> 01:18:04,299
(playful instrumental music)

1581
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,600
Don't touch anything.

1582
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:13,966
(machine beeping)

1583
01:18:13,967 --> 01:18:15,932
(keys clacking)

1584
01:18:15,933 --> 01:18:19,132
(upbeat instrumental music)

1585
01:18:19,133 --> 01:18:23,399
(playful instrumental music)

1586
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,400
(ominous instrumental music)

1587
01:18:30,233 --> 01:18:31,233
Back up.

1588
01:18:36,033 --> 01:18:39,967
(clanging) (ominous
instrumental music)

1589
01:18:42,233 --> 01:18:45,766
(keys clacking)

1590
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:48,700
(upbeat instrumental music)

1591
01:18:51,133 --> 01:18:54,032
(ominous instrumental music)

1592
01:18:54,033 --> 01:18:56,266
I don't get it.

1593
01:18:56,267 --> 01:18:58,466
I'm trying to get access into
Cashpot's computer.

1594
01:18:58,467 --> 01:18:59,499
(upbeat instrumental music)

1595
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:02,532
(electronic whirring)

1596
01:19:02,533 --> 01:19:03,799
(keys clacking)

1597
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,699
Cashpot.

1598
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:09,532
(upbeat instrumental music)

1599
01:19:09,533 --> 01:19:11,199
(machine beeping)

1600
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,200
Locked in.

1601
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:14,599
(machine beeping)

1602
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,132
Okay.

1603
01:19:16,133 --> 01:19:16,933
Let's proceed with
virus transmission.

1604
01:19:16,934 --> 01:19:18,499
Stand by.

1605
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,499
(ominous instrumental music)

1606
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,700
(keys clacking)

1607
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,599
(upbeat instrumental music)

1608
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,099
[Man] Opponent confirmed.

1609
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,366
Cashpot is not playing chess.

1610
01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:36,407
Do you still want to play?

1611
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,366
(keys clacking)

1612
01:19:40,367 --> 01:19:42,232
(upbeat instrumental music)

1613
01:19:42,233 --> 01:19:44,499
(machine whirring)

1614
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,799
Oh, we got in.

1615
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,266
I can't believe we got in.

1616
01:19:47,267 --> 01:19:49,199
How is that possible?

1617
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,166
You see, Cashpot, he linked up

1618
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:52,332
all these games to
his main computer

1619
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:54,232
to make sure nobody could win.

1620
01:19:54,233 --> 01:19:55,999
Aw, that's brilliant.

1621
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,099
(beeping)

1622
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:58,100
Transmitting the virus.

1623
01:19:59,367 --> 01:20:04,066
(keys clacking) (beeping)

1624
01:20:04,067 --> 01:20:05,199
Stop!

1625
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,200
Stop the transmission.

1626
01:20:08,467 --> 01:20:09,900
Pawn to Queen four?

1627
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:12,667
What's going on here?

1628
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,966
(beeping) (upbeat
instrumental music)

1629
01:20:16,967 --> 01:20:18,566
It's our move.

1630
01:20:18,567 --> 01:20:21,799
Move the knight.

1631
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,099
Knight to King four.

1632
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,100
Will you shut up?

1633
01:20:26,033 --> 01:20:28,766
(keys clacking)

1634
01:20:28,767 --> 01:20:31,599
(laughs) Cashpot!

1635
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,566
You little shit!

1636
01:20:35,567 --> 01:20:37,332
Well, it's your move.

1637
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,632
(keys clacking)

1638
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:40,166
No, don't touch.

1639
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:41,407
You might confuse the computer.

1640
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:44,199
What happened?

1641
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,799
Will you shut up?

1642
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,499
(upbeat instrumental music)

1643
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:49,966
Now what?

1644
01:20:49,967 --> 01:20:50,700
They're not moving.

1645
01:20:50,701 --> 01:20:51,866
He'll move.

1646
01:20:51,867 --> 01:20:53,232
He'll play the game.

1647
01:20:53,233 --> 01:20:54,966
(beeping)
- There's

1648
01:20:54,967 --> 01:20:56,927
nothing we can do until he
switches off that game.

1649
01:20:58,333 --> 01:20:59,732
Should we interrupt the
virus transmission?

1650
01:20:59,733 --> 01:21:00,866
It's too late.

1651
01:21:00,867 --> 01:21:02,066
The virus is in our buffer.

1652
01:21:02,067 --> 01:21:03,387
It might leak into
our own system.

1653
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,699
But if we move, we might be able

1654
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:09,020
to transmit while the kid's
making his move, so let's move!

1655
01:21:09,967 --> 01:21:10,833
Knight to king three.

1656
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:11,800
Pawn to queen four.

1657
01:21:11,801 --> 01:21:13,699
- The pawn?
- The knight.

1658
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:14,832
The knight?

1659
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:17,033
(keys clacking)

1660
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,466
(upbeat instrumental music)

1661
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:25,066
Oh, no.

1662
01:21:25,067 --> 01:21:27,033
[Man] Transmitting virus.

1663
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:31,333
Yeah, they moved and
they just gave us the virus.

1664
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,066
All we have to do is
just move and give it

1665
01:21:36,067 --> 01:21:37,547
right back to them,
and let's do that.

1666
01:21:39,667 --> 01:21:41,307
Look, you guys are
making a big mistake.

1667
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:46,799
I will give each of you
a million dollars.

1668
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,476
I think I'm gonna take your
Queen out, Cashpot.

1669
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,433
No.

1670
01:21:49,434 --> 01:21:50,499
Don't move.

1671
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,433
Just switch off that game.

1672
01:21:51,433 --> 01:21:52,133
(keys clacking)

1673
01:21:52,133 --> 01:21:53,133
No!

1674
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,599
That's a check.

1675
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,600
(ominous instrumental music)

1676
01:22:00,267 --> 01:22:02,466
(beeping)

1677
01:22:02,467 --> 01:22:04,667
(Cashpot sighs)

1678
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:09,867
The virus has
infected our computer.

1679
01:22:11,733 --> 01:22:14,266
(chess piece boinging)

1680
01:22:14,267 --> 01:22:16,332
(ominous instrumental music)

1681
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:17,932
(beeping)

1682
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,967
(ominous instrumental music)

1683
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,440
[Man] Sir, there are some
people at the gate.

1684
01:22:34,133 --> 01:22:35,133
Tell 'em to piss off.

1685
01:22:37,267 --> 01:22:38,766
As a representative
of the consortium,

1686
01:22:38,767 --> 01:22:40,047
I demand to know
what's going on.

1687
01:22:41,367 --> 01:22:44,400
(ominous instrumental music)

1688
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:54,166
Well, gentlemen,
Rhonda have certain

1689
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,599
things that we're
going to be dealing

1690
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,299
with, and we'll be back shortly.

1691
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,300
You can't leave.

1692
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,800
You can't abandon the mission!

1693
01:23:02,567 --> 01:23:04,966
(man grunting)

1694
01:23:04,967 --> 01:23:06,666
You're not going without us,

1695
01:23:06,667 --> 01:23:08,666
- goddamnit.
- Goddamn right, you're not.

1696
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:12,599
(ominous instrumental music)

1697
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,800
(gate whirring)

1698
01:23:17,667 --> 01:23:20,432
(footsteps thudding)

1699
01:23:20,433 --> 01:23:23,433
(ominous instrumental music)

1700
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:42,133
All units, we're in.

1701
01:23:44,267 --> 01:23:47,267
(ominous instrumental music)

1702
01:23:50,133 --> 01:23:52,266
Shawn, start sending the
rest of your men in.

1703
01:23:52,267 --> 01:23:54,232
Wait a minute.

1704
01:23:54,233 --> 01:23:56,299
Your guys know Lance
and the girl are in there?

1705
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,566
They're just fine.

1706
01:23:57,567 --> 01:23:59,032
Tell 'em to be careful, will ya?

1707
01:23:59,033 --> 01:23:59,700
I don't want those
kids getting hurt.

1708
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,299
Will you relax?

1709
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,032
I've got the situation
completely under control.

1710
01:24:03,033 --> 01:24:06,399
Shawn, look out
for the two kids.

1711
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,720
We want this as
clean as possible.

1712
01:24:09,867 --> 01:24:11,466
Freeze!

1713
01:24:11,467 --> 01:24:13,399
(gun popping)

1714
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,300
(splashing) (gate creaking)

1715
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,300
Freeze!

1716
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:16,566
(rapid popping)

1717
01:24:16,567 --> 01:24:17,300
They're shooting at us.

1718
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,300
Yes.

1719
01:24:22,367 --> 01:24:25,300
(upbeat instrumental music)

1720
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,967
Lance, are ya in there?

1721
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,732
(men shouting)

1722
01:24:39,733 --> 01:24:40,899
[Man] Hey, beat it!

1723
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:44,199
(rapid popping) (loud popping)

1724
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,200
Ahh!

1725
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:50,233
(upbeat instrumental music)

1726
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:56,166
(door clicks open)

1727
01:24:56,167 --> 01:24:57,732
Hey, hey, this is my money!

1728
01:24:57,733 --> 01:24:58,800
Six million dollars!

1729
01:25:01,267 --> 01:25:02,666
(clicking)

1730
01:25:02,667 --> 01:25:03,866
What?

1731
01:25:03,867 --> 01:25:05,299
My god, there's a bomb in there.

1732
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,132
There's a bomb!

1733
01:25:07,133 --> 01:25:09,667
(helicopter whirring)

1734
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:15,466
Come on in, let's go!

1735
01:25:15,467 --> 01:25:18,400
(helicopter engine roaring)

1736
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,532
(ominous instrumental music)

1737
01:25:27,533 --> 01:25:28,600
This way, come on!

1738
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:35,466
Close in fast!

1739
01:25:35,467 --> 01:25:37,632
They're getting
away in a chopper.

1740
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:39,399
Lance and the girl are
in there somewhere.

1741
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,499
I got to go in.

1742
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,899
(helicopter whirring)

1743
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:46,900
(ominous instrumental music)

1744
01:25:58,033 --> 01:26:00,033
(man yelling)

1745
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,200
(gate squeaking)

1746
01:26:08,367 --> 01:26:10,333
(man grunts)

1747
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,800
(man screams)

1748
01:26:26,367 --> 01:26:27,732
[Man] Freeze!

1749
01:26:27,733 --> 01:26:29,699
[Man] On the ground,
on the ground.

1750
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:33,766
(grunting) (helicopter whirring)

1751
01:26:33,767 --> 01:26:37,132
(gun clicking) (footsteps
thudding)

1752
01:26:37,133 --> 01:26:38,133
Lance?

1753
01:26:41,133 --> 01:26:44,432
(door crashing in)

1754
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:46,667
(clock ticking)

1755
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:52,466
Lance?

1756
01:26:52,467 --> 01:26:54,866
(clock ticking)

1757
01:26:54,867 --> 01:26:56,732
Lance?

1758
01:26:56,733 --> 01:27:00,799
(helicopter whirring)

1759
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,000
You know, this isn't so bad.

1760
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:04,933
We've still got 6
million dollars.

1761
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:05,933
Sure do.

1762
01:27:07,267 --> 01:27:08,932
And the beach house off
the coast in Chile.

1763
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:10,266
When in Rome.

1764
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:11,932
Know it.

1765
01:27:11,933 --> 01:27:14,032
But don't forget new identities.

1766
01:27:14,033 --> 01:27:16,399
A bit of plastic
surgery might help.

1767
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,267
Good idea. (laughs)

1768
01:27:20,967 --> 01:27:23,867
I was thinking, what about
banks in Monaco?

1769
01:27:25,867 --> 01:27:26,467
Doesn't that have a
nice ring to it?

1770
01:27:26,467 --> 01:27:27,467
Monaco, banks.

1771
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:32,332
Sounds fabulous to me.

1772
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:35,333
(ominous instrumental music)

1773
01:27:36,967 --> 01:27:39,466

1774
01:27:39,467 --> 01:27:42,333
(light instrumental music)

1775
01:28:12,033 --> 01:28:13,166
Lance?

1776
01:28:13,167 --> 01:28:14,500
Lance, can you hear me?

1777
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:18,900
(beeping)

1778
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:26,632
(upbeat instrumental music)

1779
01:28:26,633 --> 01:28:27,700
What does that mean?

1780
01:28:29,133 --> 01:28:30,966
(beeping)

1781
01:28:30,967 --> 01:28:34,632
(helicopter whirring)

1782
01:28:34,633 --> 01:28:37,332
(phone ringing)

1783
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:38,333
Hello?

1784
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,800
Hello?

1785
01:28:45,233 --> 01:28:46,399
(chess piece boinging)

1786
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,167

1787
01:28:47,168 --> 01:28:49,299
(whirring)

1788
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:50,100
Who's that?

1789
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:50,833
I don't know.

1790
01:28:50,834 --> 01:28:52,799
Hello?

1791
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,560
(helicopter whirring)
Something wrong here.

1792
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:56,900
There's something wrong!

1793
01:28:58,433 --> 01:28:59,766
We've been infected!

1794
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:01,132
Infected?

1795
01:29:01,133 --> 01:29:03,366
- I'm losing control!
- No!

1796
01:29:03,367 --> 01:29:05,466
- We're going down.
- No, no.

1797
01:29:05,467 --> 01:29:08,399
(Cashpot whimpering)
Do something!

1798
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,066
(helicopter whirring)

1799
01:29:11,067 --> 01:29:12,299
I'm losing control!

1800
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,366
Help me out!

1801
01:29:13,367 --> 01:29:14,699
Do something!

1802
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,166
(Cashpot screaming)

1803
01:29:16,167 --> 01:29:18,466
(both screaming)

1804
01:29:18,467 --> 01:29:20,499
(yelling)

1805
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,567
We're gonna do down!

1806
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,100
(woman yells)

1807
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:27,967
(woman screaming) (helicopter
whirring)

1808
01:29:27,967 --> 01:29:28,967
Going down!

1809
01:29:30,367 --> 01:29:31,666
No!

1810
01:29:31,667 --> 01:29:34,200
(helicopter whirring)

1811
01:29:36,967 --> 01:29:38,366

1815
01:29:42,667 --> 01:29:43,567
[Man] Come on, to the car!

1816
01:29:43,568 --> 01:29:45,166
[Man] That means you're

1817

(footsteps thudding)

1818
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:49,232
You got to believe us.

1819
01:29:49,233 --> 01:29:51,132
We had nothing to do with this!

1820
01:29:51,133 --> 01:29:52,766
- Forced us into it!
- [Man] In the car.

1821
01:29:52,767 --> 01:29:54,466
Lance?

1822
01:29:54,467 --> 01:29:55,899
(beeping)

1823
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:56,900
Lance, where are you?

1824
01:29:58,733 --> 01:30:01,267
(car engines roaring)

1825
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:06,773
So, what's it like
in Philadelphia?

1826
01:30:12,533 --> 01:30:15,467
