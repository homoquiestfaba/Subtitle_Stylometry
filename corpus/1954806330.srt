1
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,779
Okay.

2
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,868
- You taking off?
- Yeah.

3
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,333
- All right.
- Mysterious.

4
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,836
Happy Valentine's Day.

5
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,878
- Say, hey, my man.
- Hey, what's up, Tom?

6
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,719
- Thanks, Tom.
- Happy Valentine's Day.

7
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,327
What do you mean
you're leaving me?

8
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,329
You can't leave me
until you're actually here to leave.

9
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,332
Yes, I'm gonna argue semantics, Sara.
It's the least I can do.

10
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,334
I come home on Valentine's Day...

11
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,336
...with two bags ready to go
by the door...

12
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,339
...and a Dear John
telling me you need space?

13
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,386
Come on, what is that?

14
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,342
That is totally unoriginal...

15
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,509
...and completely devoid
of any real information...

16
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,347
...that would give me some insight
to why you're doing this.

17
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,349
Yes, I wanna know.
I'm asking you, right?

18
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:29,311
I'm not yelling. I'm just speaking
pointedly to make my point.

19
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,314
Fuck the neighbors. It's 2:00
in the morning on a Saturday night.

20
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,317
Fuck them if they don't
have a social life. No.

21
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,319
Sara, listen, don't leave me.

22
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,322
You can't leave me.
I've done everything I know how to do.

23
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,369
I've given you every ounce
of my heart and soul.

24
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,327
I've given more of myself to you
than I've given anybody.

25
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,329
And now
you're just gonna walk out?

26
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:51,333
You're just gonna throw me away
like that and not even tell me why?

27
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,335
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna be here.

28
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:59,341
I invited half the bar over to help us
celebrate Valentine's Day, remember?

29
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:04,346
Okay, all right. Well,
then I'll see you when you get here.

30
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,765
Bye.

31
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,790
Fuck.

32
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,345
Christ, Tommy,
you left five minutes too soon.

33
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,348
Seriously, five minutes.
Unbelievable. Where are the girls?

34
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,350
- What?
- Didn't you invite chicks to this?

35
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,357
- No, that's not what this is about.
- Oh, Christ. Thank God I did, huh?

36
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,314
- What?
- Broads, skirts.

37
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,317
I got a gang of girls coming
in 15 minutes. Be prepared.

38
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,324
- You don't understand.
- You don't understand.

39
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,322
After what happened to me,
I'm not sitting around...

40
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,325
...sword fighting on Valentine's Day.
I need chicks, and now.

41
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,327
- Why? What happened?
- You remember Charlotte, right?

42
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,330
- Which one's Charlotte?
- One with the thing.

43
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,333
- The fucked-up Peter Falk eye.
- Oh, yeah, sure, she was nice.

44
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,335
- I threw her out.
- Threw her out? Why?

45
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:20,339
Lt got embarrassing taking her out,
always that eye looming out at you.

46
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,466
I'm telling you,
that thing had a mind of its own.

47
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,344
- It made me feel self-conscious.
- Made you feel self-conscious?

48
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:28,347
You believe that? Me.
Chocolates, you shouldn't have.

49
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,350
You can't be with someone
you're ashamed to be seen with.

50
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:34,311
It's not practical. You spend
so much time going places...

51
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,314
...that you never go, trying not
to run into people you know.

52
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,315
Lt doesn't make any sense.

53
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:41,318
Besides, she wasn't exactly
sending rockets to the moon either.

54
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,445
- Why?
- She informed me...

55
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,321
...that the world
doesn't evolve around me.

56
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,323
She said "evolve."

57
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,326
And you didn't try to tell her
your theory of revolution?

58
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,327
- No, I cut her off.
- You cut her off.

59
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,330
- She was starting to get clingy.
- Who you trying to convince?

60
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,333
You know how they get.
"Honey, this, " "honey, that."

61
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,337
I thought I was turning into a bee.
Anyways, I cut her off on the phone.

62
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,340
- On the phone?
- On the phone.

63
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,342
- How'd she take it?
- I don't know.

64
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,347
I asked her if she'd met Tone,
she said no, you know the rest:

65
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,354
That's horrible, Sal.

66
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,356
- You said this girl was nice.
- My dog's nice.

67
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,311
- Don't see me talking dirty to her.
- I wouldn't tell anybody.

68
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,313
Butch ain't the spitting image
of Columbo.

69
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,315
- Give me a beer.
- So that was today.

70
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,317
Tonight, I'm at the bar...

71
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,484
...she comes in
with this muscle-bound beach guy...

72
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,321
...trying to make me jealous. Me.

73
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,324
Gino points them out.
I'm sauced up at this point.

74
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,371
I walk over and I say:

75
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,328
"You're not really with this
hippie-fied fag, are you?"

76
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,330
He says, "What'd you say?"

77
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,333
I pulled back my jacket enough
so he can see my piece and said:

78
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,337
"I just called you a cockeyed-loving,
biscuit-lipped, hippie-fied-looking fag.

79
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,424
- What are you gonna do?"
- Shit. What did he do?

80
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,342
What can he do?
Turned white as a ghost...

81
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,345
...and made like Ralph Kramden:

82
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:51,512
So I go back to drinking.

83
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,349
Gino comes over later
and says, "Will you look at that?"

84
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,312
And there is Fabio making out
with Columbo all over my bar.

85
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,315
Whatever. So I finish up my whiskey,
and I walk over.

86
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,318
- I slap Tarzan on the face and I say:
- Holy shit.

87
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,404
"Antonio Banderas,
you're kissing my old girl."

88
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,324
And he says, "Yeah?"
I say, "Yeah. How's my cock taste?"

89
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,325
Holy shit.

90
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,328
I strolled out,
grabbed myself a bottle of Maker's...

91
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,330
...and here I am.

92
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,334
Holy shit. And she was kissing that
Fabio guy right there in front of you?

93
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,335
Yeah.

94
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,337
- You just broke up?
- I broke up with her.

95
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,340
Why do they do that?
They're supposed to be sensitive.

96
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,342
- Women fucking suck.
- You think so?

97
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,344
But few suck well.

98
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,346
I can't tell you the last time
I had a decent blowjob.

99
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,348
I admit it is a lost art.

100
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:38,352
I stop them half the time. I'm like "Yo,
it ain't a fucking artichoke, all right?"

101
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,311
- Totally.
- Funny thing is...

102
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:42,314
...these women
think they're fantastic at it.

103
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,316
I cannot tell you how many times
I've heard:

104
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,319
"Oh, baby, you cannot handle me,
I will rock your world."

105
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,322
Then it comes time to close the deal
and it's like Flipper on Prozac.

106
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:54,326
Have you ever had a dead-fish fuck?
I would rather have a root canal.

107
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,328
These women
think just being present...

108
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,330
...is all it takes for bedroom artistry.

109
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,333
Maybe that works for a guy
that gets laid every leap year...

110
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,337
...but for a guy like me, a dead-fish
fuck could have severe ramifications.

111
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,384
I can't believe she pulled
a high-school move...

112
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,341
...and brought a date to your bar.

113
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:13,345
That violates two of the "nevers" in the
Geneva Convention of breaking up.

114
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:17,349
The first of which is that you never,
under any circumstances ever...

115
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,352
...are you to hang out
in your ex's stomping grounds...

116
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,399
...after you break up!

117
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,399
It's a big city, right?

118
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,314
Why does she have to hang out
in our bar?

119
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,317
- She never used to hang out there.
- You're right.

120
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,484
What, there's not a million other bars
in the city?

121
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,322
We don't want her there.
She's not welcome.

122
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,323
Hell, no.

123
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,325
You don't see us hanging out
at LensCrafters, do you?

124
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,328
That is only second
to the most heinous of violations...

125
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,331
...the fact that you just broke up
this morning.

126
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,332
I broke up with her.

127
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,335
You dumped that Sandy Duncan
Cyclops this morning.

128
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,337
She comes into our LensCrafters
on a date?

129
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,340
Isn't there some statute of limitations,
or time variable...

130
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,427
...or something that makes
that unconstitutional?

131
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,345
- It is fucking bullshit, Tommy.
- Fucking bullshit, Sal!

132
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,347
Keep it down.
You're gonna wake Karen.

133
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,349
She'll be here
with Frankenstein gear on.

134
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,352
Kenny! Speaking of Frankenstein,
how is your wife?

135
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,313
- Sal broke up with Charlotte.
- Which one?

136
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,317
The black fellow that used to perform
with Dean Martin.

137
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,324
Yeah, she was nice.
You two not see eye to eye?

138
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,321
Does Karen wear
that green mud on her face?

139
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,323
- Yes.
- You don't take one look...

140
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,325
...and get the shit scared out of you?

141
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,327
That's how she keeps
her skin young.

142
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,413
If that's true,
I wish she'd put some on her ass.

143
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,333
There should be some vow
which covers ass size after "I do."

144
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,336
- Like an insurance policy.
- Brilliant, ass insurance.

145
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:30,339
- There's more for you to love.
- Easy for you to say.

146
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:34,343
Sara works
out five days a week.

147
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,345
- What?
- What'd I say?

148
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:37,346
What happened?

149
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,349
Apparently, she'll be working
on her arms this evening...

150
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:43,352
...when she carries
those two suitcases out that door.

151
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,312
- What? Say, "I swear to God."
- No.

152
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,316
It's true. Three years
and I come home to a Dear John...

153
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,318
...and those suitcases
sitting by the door.

154
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,321
She's on her way over.
I have no idea what I'm gonna do.

155
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,368
- Dear John.
- On Valentine's Day. Unbelievable.

156
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,325
I'm sick.

157
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,328
I gave Sara three years of my life.
Three good years.

158
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,331
I mean, sure, we had our problems,
everybody does.

159
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,334
Lt was mostly good times.
That's how you're supposed to tell.

160
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,461
I mean, nobody's perfect, but as long
as the good times outweigh the bad...

161
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,340
...that's what's supposed to count,
right?

162
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,387
Unless she didn't see it that way.
Unless I really didn't make her happy.

163
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,345
That's bullshit, Tommy.

164
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,512
Since when is it a man's job
to make a woman happy?

165
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,348
- Want this?
- Don't think so.

166
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:25,352
My point is, you were happy, right?
For three years, you were happy.

167
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,313
You know what I'd give for that?
This, my right arm.

168
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,316
Look at me. I'm a lonely, drunken,
misogynistic asshole...

169
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,319
...who goes from
one empty relationship to another...

170
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:39,324
...whose only solace is found
at the bottom of a bottle of whiskey.

171
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,326
I can't remember a time in my life
when I was happy...

172
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,329
...for three consecutive days,
let alone three years.

173
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,332
Are you kidding me?
You know whose fault that is? Mine.

174
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,334
Because I'm responsible
for my own happiness.

175
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,337
If Sara wasn't happy,
that is her own fucking problem.

176
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,424
She didn't do the things
that she needed to do...

177
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,342
...to make sure she was happy.
You're not Dionne Warwick.

178
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,345
You're not a mind reader.
You're not a psychic friend.

179
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,432
You're Tom Reilly,
one of the best people I know.

180
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:07,352
And if she can't see that,
then she needs to go to LensCrafters.

181
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,314
Why does it hurt so bad, huh?
Why do I feel like I wanna die inside?

182
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,317
- Because you're beautiful.
- He's right, you're beautiful.

183
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm not a fag, but you're like
a real person. You are a man.

184
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,323
You think if I knew Karen
was gonna leave...

185
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,326
...I wouldn't be down here asking
you two how I could get her back?

186
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,329
- Christ, Sal too.
- You had me until you brought Sal in.

187
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,415
Very funny.
What, you don't think I got feelings?

188
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,334
You don't think I'm sensitive?
Let me tell you.

189
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:33,337
I got more feelings in my nut
than you two schoolgirls together.

190
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,339
- Come on now!
- Here we go again.

191
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,341
I know.
I know what they say about me.

192
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,343
I know what they say
about guys like me.

193
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,347
- They say we're pigs, that we're dogs.
- Ln your defense, they don't exclude.

194
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,349
I've been married five years.
My wife still says it.

195
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,351
They don't exclude. They say "all."

196
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:51,313
"All men are pigs. All men are dogs.
All men are scum."

197
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,317
They talk and talk their little asses off
about what monsters we are.

198
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,319
They don't understand
they're the ones...

199
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,322
...that created the Frankensteins
they abhor.

200
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,324
- Frankenstein's a whore?
- Leave my wife out of this.

201
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,326
Laugh all you want, but I'm serious.

202
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,329
Every womanizer, every player,
every guy juggling three broads...

203
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,332
...at the same time
is only doing so out of fear.

204
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:13,335
Fear of being crushed by a woman.

205
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:16,338
Because one day, back in the day,
they were not a player.

206
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,341
- They liked one girl, just one.
- They gave it up to her.

207
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,343
They gave it up to her. Right.

208
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,345
They gave it up
because they were romantics.

209
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,348
They gave it up to the girl they loved
and what happened?

210
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,350
They got rocked or crushed
or destroyed.

211
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,311
They got cheated on or laughed at
or something.

212
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,314
When they finished picking up the
pieces of their heart...

213
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,315
...you know what they said?

214
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,318
- Every single one made a vow.
- Never to give it up again.

215
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,320
That's right.
Never to give it up again.

216
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,322
Now we're talking
about the real bastards.

217
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,324
Guys that break hearts
occupationally.

218
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:48,328
Originally, those cats were
the most beautiful and romantic of all.

219
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,416
You know what happened?

220
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,332
They're the ones that got hurt
worst of all.

221
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,335
- Because you never get over it.
- No, God, no!

222
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,338
You never get over it.
Yes, you recover.

223
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,340
But you never get over it.
What happened?

224
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,342
When they all recovered,
you know what they all said?

225
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,346
They all said, "Okay, I see. All right.

226
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,348
If that's how it is,
I can play that way."

227
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,352
So you see, we are all responsible
for the cycle of the vicious circle.

228
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,314
- So you're saying you're afraid?
- Absolutely.

229
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,320
I ain't never getting my heart broken
again like I did when I was 16.

230
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,323
But why? Why do people hurt
each other like that?

231
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,326
Why don't they just take care of
each other's feelings? It's so easy.

232
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,333
Because people are selfish
and they don't care.

233
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,331
I mean, look, we've all done it, right?

234
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,334
We've been in that situation
where we're with another woman.

235
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,336
We know what we're about to do
is wrong...

236
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:40,339
...that if we do this, it's gonna
hurt somebody we care for badly.

237
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,341
It'll ruin everything, everything.

238
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,343
All the years of work
that we put into it...

239
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,345
...in some cases children, families...

240
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:50,349
...and yet we look, we've got this
young, hot piece of ass in front of us.

241
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:53,352
At that moment, we throw everything
away and we do it anyway.

242
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,312
We do it anyway.
We know it's gonna kill our wife...

243
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,315
...or girlfriend or whatever,
but we do it anyway.

244
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:01,318
And that, my friends,
is why we're all so fucked up.

245
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:02,445
Because we do it anyway.

246
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:05,322
We think the grass is greener
somewhere else.

247
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,325
The better deal is around the corner
ready to present itself.

248
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,327
And we forget what good friends
we have right here...

249
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:13,330
...and that the grass
is pretty fucking nice right here.

250
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:16,333
But we're not kind,
for the most part, are we?

251
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,335
We're not strong,
we're certainly not wise...

252
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,422
...so we throw away people
who are most valuable.

253
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:23,340
We waste them,
like we have them to waste. And, Sal...

254
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,343
...if you keep doing it, you're gonna
wake up one day and be old.

255
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,345
You're gonna be alone,
or worse...

256
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:32,349
...stuck with some vacuous, one-eyed
stripper who you can't talk to.

257
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,351
You wanna put a bullet in your head.

258
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,319
You missed the great ones
that you once had...

259
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,314
...and that you threw away.

260
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,316
- That's horrible.
- Frightening.

261
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,318
Almost enough
to make you wanna turn gay.

262
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:47,322
Oh, my God, I'm so excited,
I'm harder than Chinese math.

263
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,324
- Someone get me a Red Bull.
- Wayne!

264
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,491
- Hey.
- You got my message.

265
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:53,328
- You didn't tell me she was coming.
- Where you been?

266
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,331
- I've been calling you.
- Ln Hawaii, planning a wedding.

267
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,332
They're legalizing gay marriages.

268
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,335
They're so smart.
It's gonna boom their economy.

269
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,336
The world needs Samoan fags.

270
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,339
A wedding. Who's getting married?
Anyone we know?

271
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,341
- Yeah, silly, me.
- Get out.

272
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,468
- What are you talking about?
- His name is Kwame.

273
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,345
He's from the Virgin lslands.

274
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,472
Let me tell you, sweetheart,
after this weekend...

275
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,350
...that boy is definitely
not a virgin, okay?

276
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,312
Anyway, he's on his way
over here right now...

277
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,314
...because I wanted you to meet him.

278
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
- Are you out of your mind?
- You are so fucked up.

279
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,320
You're getting married. That's terrific.
I don't know what to say.

280
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,321
Say you'll come
and be my best man.

281
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,324
- Are you serious?
- Yes, who else would I choose?

282
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:36,205
Bring Sara down with you
and the four of us will have a blast.

283
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,496
- What? What did I say?
- You said plenty, asshole.

284
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,335
- Our boy got dumped tonight.
- What? Why?

285
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:42,336
She said she needed space.

286
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,339
That ho didn't think she had enough
between her legs?

287
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:46,340
- Wayne.
- I'm sorry.

288
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:49,343
But nobody
breaks my Tommy's heart.

289
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,345
I never liked her anyway.
She's an actress.

290
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:55,349
- "Oh, hi, Sara, how are you?"
- "Oh, me, me, me."

291
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,351
I swear,
I'd ask her how she was doing...

292
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,312
...and she'd tell me how
she once got a callback for Matlock.

293
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,315
That's a woman who thinks her worth
is determined by her résumé.

294
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,317
You can't deal with that.

295
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:08,320
You need someone that thinks about
you, that'll take care of you.

296
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,487
- Someone who's nurturing.
- Yeah, nurturing bitches.

297
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:13,325
I love me some nurturing bitches.
They're the best.

298
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,327
They gotta be good-looking too.

299
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,330
I can't be dealing with no ugly bitches.
Know what I'm saying?

300
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:22,334
This is God's way of trying to tell you
you're supposed to be dating men.

301
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,336
Sure, that's what I need,
a nice hairy ass.

302
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:27,339
- That'll solve everything.
- Don't start with that faggot shit.

303
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:30,342
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Lt was a joke. I was kidding.

304
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:31,430
You do it all the time.

305
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,347
It's all part of the mind-meld
faggot shit you fags pull all the time.

306
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,349
I can see the shit
coming all the way from Cleveland.

307
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:40,352
- Sal.
- Don't think I'm not onto you, Wayne.

308
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,320
You throw something here,
say something there.

309
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,320
Drop a line about this,
an innuendo about that.

310
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,317
You fuck-o's plant the seed,
and next, everyone's sucking dick.

311
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,319
- Come on, Sal.
- Oh, come on, my ass.

312
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,322
- Oh, I'd love to, but I'm engaged.
- You see what I mean?

313
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,325
You fags are like Jehovah's Witnesses
or vampires.

314
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,327
As soon as one of you
thinks you're gay...

315
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,330
...you want everyone else
in the world to be gay too.

316
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,331
Think they're gay?

317
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,334
No. First of all,
I don't think I'm gay, Sal, I am gay.

318
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,381
And secondly,
I don't want you to convert, okay?

319
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,338
I wouldn't wish that on any man.

320
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:12,342
I was simply trying to get Tom's mind
off the subject of women.

321
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,344
You guys are so pathetic,
I bet before I got here...

322
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:17,347
...that's all you were talking about.

323
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,349
Of course it was.
Look at yourselves!

324
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:23,312
You are worse than a bunch of girls.
Every straight man I know...

325
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,438
...spends their time
talking about sports, cars...

326
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,318
...or their careers, where they wanna
travel to, the last fight they got into.

327
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,321
Something.
Even if it's mundane and prehistoric...

328
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,322
...it's something other than women.

329
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,325
Have you ever overheard a
conversation between women?

330
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,327
What is it always about? Men.
That's it.

331
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:42,331
That's all they ever talk about.
And you guys are worse than them.

332
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,334
I wonder if there's a set of balls
between the three of you.

333
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,337
I can only handle being
chastised by a fag for so long...

334
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:51,340
...at least as long
as my father's on this earth.

335
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:52,347
That's really clever.

336
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:55,344
Why don't you go gay bashing
with your hoodlum friends...

337
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,346
...save us the subtlety
of your innuendo?

338
00:18:57,513 --> 00:19:00,349
If I do, I'm gonna start with you,
you big queen.

339
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,351
I mean, who hell are you anyways...

340
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,312
...you confused, fucked-up,
backwards cocksucker?

341
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,315
Think you know who you are
because you can express yourself?

342
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:11,318
Because you're out of the closet
and can be the real you?

343
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:12,319
- Come on, Sal.
- Fuck that, Tommy.

344
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,321
I'm not supposed to say anything...

345
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,323
...because as a white,
heterosexual male...

346
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,326
...I'm wrong about everything
from jump street.

347
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:23,330
I know that. I know I can't win.
But you see this kid here?

348
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,332
This kid used to be
one of my best friends.

349
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,334
All of a sudden,
he turns swish on me? Okay?

350
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,336
Now he tells me
he's gonna marry a man.

351
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,338
I gotta sit here
and pretend I dig that?

352
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,341
I don't even know
how to fucking deal with that.

353
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,349
And maybe I've had too much
to drink tonight...

354
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,346
...and maybe I'll apologize
to Wayne-o in the morning...

355
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:43,350
...but for right now, I'm gonna rip him
a new fucking asshole.

356
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,352
- That sounds fun.
- Verbally, you pervert.

357
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,312
Let me explain something to you.

358
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:51,316
You are not gay, okay?
You understand?

359
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,319
You were born a man,
and Mother Nature does not fuck up.

360
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:58,323
Being gay's not physical, it's mental.
It's a psychological situation.

361
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,410
Look, you were probably molested
as a little kid.

362
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,327
You got fucked up
about your sexuality...

363
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,330
...when you hit puberty,
and you thought to yourself:

364
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,332
"My gosh, I must be gay."
Well, you're not.

365
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,334
You were born a little boy.

366
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:14,339
You didn't speak with that lisp,
that fucking... thing either.

367
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:17,342
You're putting that on like an accent.
That is an affectation.

368
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,344
When you were a kid,
you didn't act all fruity like now.

369
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:23,348
Don't forget, Wayne-o, I've known you
since elementary school.

370
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,475
Lt is a proven fact
that some people are born gay.

371
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:29,313
It's not psychological, it's physical.
A portion of the brain...

372
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,315
- Which portion?
- The thalamus or something.

373
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,317
- Or something?
- The hypothalamus.

374
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,319
- The hypothalamus?
- I don't know!

375
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:39,323
Some certain stem in the brain grows
different in the brain of gay men.

376
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,324
- It's a proven fact.
- Says who?

377
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,326
- Says doctors.
- Which doctors?

378
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,328
- Medical doctors.
- Still vague.

379
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,330
No, I'm not.
Medical doctors have proven...

380
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,456
- Know their names?
- What?

381
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,334
You heard me, motherfucker.
Don't stall for time.

382
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,337
Do you know their names
or did you hear it's a proven fact?

383
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:56,340
I heard about it, okay,
but everybody knows...

384
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:58,342
You heard about it,
but everybody knows.

385
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:00,344
I see. Very interesting.

386
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,347
You heard about it, but everybody
knows it's a proven fact.

387
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:05,349
Sounds like a rumor to me.

388
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:09,311
See, I happen to know the name of the
doctor that said he proved that theory.

389
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:12,314
I also know the name of the doctors
that corroborated the story.

390
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:15,317
Can I hip you to a bit of potentially
earth-shattering information?

391
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:18,320
They're all gay.

392
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:23,325
All of them. Dr. Lipshits, Dipshits,
and motherfucking Mipshits...

393
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:26,328
...are motherfuckers who unethically
used their status as doctors...

394
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:29,331
...to further their own
anally suggestive ends.

395
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:32,334
He's actually right. They did a whole
exposé on those three doctors.

396
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,337
- I read the article about it in the Times.
- Can you believe that?

397
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:38,340
Motherfuckers telling people
they got weird shit...

398
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,343
...growing in their brain
so they start sucking dick.

399
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,346
I don't care if a motherfucker told me
I had a tree growing in my head.

400
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:48,350
Ain't no way this motherfucker's
ever gonna start sucking dick.

401
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,311
Can you imagine that conversation?
"Excuse me, Mr. Johnson?

402
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,312
We have bad news and good news.

403
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,313
The bad news is...

404
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,316
...we found some weird growth
in your cortex.

405
00:21:56,483 --> 00:22:00,320
The good news is, you can
start sucking dick immediately."

406
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,323
- All right, that's enough.
- Fuck that, Tommy.

407
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,325
That's enough. Guys, come on.

408
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,327
We're supposed to be happy
for Wayne tonight.

409
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,329
He's getting married.
And it's a big deal.

410
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,332
I don't care if he's marrying a goat.
We're supportive.

411
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,335
- You had me until the goat.
- It's a metaphor.

412
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,336
With Wayne you never know.

413
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:19,339
We get enough shit
from the rest of the world.

414
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,341
Last thing we need to be doing
is getting dumped on...

415
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:24,344
...by people who are supposed
to get our backs.

416
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,352
- You want this one?
- Wayne getting dumped on?

417
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,348
- I don't think so.
- He's happy, all right?

418
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,350
Look, Wayne is...
Smile for me. He's happy!

419
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:33,312
That's a lot more than I can say
for the rest of the world.

420
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:36,315
It's definitely more than I can say
for you and I, Sal.

421
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,317
Of course, he's happy, Tom.
He's gay!

422
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,318
I'm done.

423
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:42,321
He doesn't have to deal
with chick drama all the time.

424
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,323
Know how happy I would be...

425
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,325
...if I didn't have to deal
with chick drama?

426
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,328
Know how happy I'd be if I had
someone I could shoot hoops with...

427
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,331
...watch a game with, go drinking with,
play poker with...

428
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,333
...and would blow me
six times a day?

429
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,335
Are you kidding me?
I wish I could be gay.

430
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:59,338
I would be the biggest
and the best fag of them all.

431
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:01,340
I'd be king of the fags.

432
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:04,343
I just can't seem to get
in that good of shape.

433
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,347
I got no problem with the whole
being-gay aspect of it, Wayne.

434
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:10,349
All right? I really don't.

435
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:12,351
You wanna fuck a man,
that's your business.

436
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:14,438
I got no problem with that.
I like ass fucking...

437
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:16,313
...as much as the next guy.

438
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,315
I don't think you need to parade it
down the street...

439
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,317
...and tell everybody you're into that.

440
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:22,319
You wanna be left alone
to do your thing...

441
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:25,322
...then shut the fuck up
and keep it your thing.

442
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:27,324
I'm not talking about hiding
in the closet.

443
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:30,327
- Just don't shove it in my face.
- Are you done?

444
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:33,330
Probably not, but I'm tired of talking,
so go ahead.

445
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:34,331
Sal, you're right.

446
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:37,334
My gregariousness
does make me a target. I know that.

447
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:41,338
But whether you think you're right
about your psychoanalytical bullshit...

448
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:44,341
...I did not come here tonight to be
beat up or put under a microscope.

449
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,343
I came here tonight
to share my joy with you.

450
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,347
Not to be berated by people
who are supposed to be my friends.

451
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,349
I knew you were gonna be here
tonight, Sal.

452
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:54,351
And I knew
you were gonna bust my balls.

453
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:57,312
I really thought that, underneath it all,
you'd be happy for me.

454
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:01,316
I never thought you'd be so vicious.
If I'd known, I never would've come.

455
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,318
I wouldn't have invited
the man I'm going to marry...

456
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,320
...to a place
where he would be ridiculed.

457
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,322
I mean, I might be into kinky shit...

458
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:11,326
...but I am not a masochist
and I'm certainly not stupid.

459
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,746
Good night, everyone.

460
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:19,209
Come on. Go.

461
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,336
- Go.
- Wayne.

462
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,797
What?

463
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:31,346
All right, all right. Don't go.

464
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,348
Don't go?

465
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:38,687
Well, that's a joke.
Give me one good reason why not.

466
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,733
All right, all right.

467
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:50,157
I don't know how to say this, okay,
so I'm just gonna say it.

468
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,327
My girl dumped me today.

469
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,330
I'm sorry I lied to you, Tommy.

470
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,333
I came here acting like a stud,
like I gave her the Heisman...

471
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:02,336
...but truth of the matter is
she fucking dumped me.

472
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:05,339
I saw her out tonight
with some GQ fucking jawbone guy.

473
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:08,342
He was way better-looking than me,
and it hurt a little bit.

474
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,344
You know,
maybe more than just a little bit.

475
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,346
I pulled some Bogart move
on the motherfucker.

476
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:15,349
I made him look like a bitch
in front of everyone.

477
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:20,938
The truth of the matter is,
she still went home with him.

478
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:26,318
So now I'm drunk and I'm pissed...

479
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:28,320
...and I come
and take it out on you guys.

480
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:31,323
The truth of the matter is,
I'm just jealous.

481
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,327
Not that I wanna be a fag or nothing,
but you're always up, doing good.

482
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:39,331
And you don't fucking need me
being an asshole to you.

483
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:42,209
So don't go.

484
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:49,341
And I wanna meet your...

485
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:51,343
- Friend.
- Friend.

486
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,971
Oh, Sal.

487
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:58,350
Jesus Christ. Just get it over with.

488
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:02,312
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

489
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:05,315
Oh, my God, Sal's gay.

490
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,442
God. You see what happens
when you try to be nice?

491
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:10,320
Your friends think you're a fag.
So much for karma.

492
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:11,321
Don't say that, I was kidding.

493
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:14,324
I was watching through the window.
You were sweet.

494
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,326
- Don't even start.
- I'm serious, Sal.

495
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,329
I've never seen that side of you before.
You were amazing.

496
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:20,330
You were kind and vulnerable.

497
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:24,334
Not only did you embrace Wayne,
you were open emotionally as well.

498
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:28,338
- That's a tremendous step for you.
- I'm gonna put a tremendous step...

499
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,341
...upside your head if you don't
shut up with that treehugger bull.

500
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:34,344
- He's a treehugger, that's his thing.
- I know, but it's fucking lame.

501
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:37,347
With the tie-dyes and the vibes
and the Birkenstocks.

502
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:41,351
Always trying to get me to change
and grow and take it to the next level.

503
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:43,398
- I mean, does that shit work?
- What do you mean?

504
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,315
Ever get any chicks
with a lame angle like that?

505
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:47,316
Because I got a dozen chicks...

506
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:50,319
...coming through that door
in like two seconds.

507
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,326
If you cock-block
and pull out a Ouija board...

508
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,447
...I'm telling you right now,
I'm gonna shoot you.

509
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,325
- It's not an angle.
- I know it's not.

510
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,327
- It's a nonangle.
- As it should be.

511
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:00,329
I mean, it's not about getting over.

512
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,331
It's about being real,
communication.

513
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,334
How come I never see you
having any real communication...

514
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,336
...with any real chicks, like, ever?

515
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:09,503
Maybe because I don't look at women
the way you do.

516
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:12,341
I think women are beautiful.
I think they're amazing.

517
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:15,344
I think they're the most magical
of all of God's creations on Earth.

518
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:17,346
I am enamored with them.

519
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:19,348
I don't know how to pretend
like I'm not.

520
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:23,352
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about the 11 th-man theory.

521
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,312
Everybody knows
the 11 th-man theory.

522
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:28,315
No, nobody knows
the 11 th-man theory but you.

523
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:32,319
No, I know a little something
about the 11 -man theory.

524
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,321
Shut up.
What are you talking about?

525
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:36,323
Say there's a woman in a room
with 10 men.

526
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,325
And all 10 men are telling her
how beautiful she is...

527
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,327
...and how amazing she is.

528
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:42,329
They're lighting her cigarette,
buying her drinks...

529
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:44,331
...just treating her like gold.

530
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:47,334
Then all of a sudden,
in walks the 11 th man.

531
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:50,337
He takes one look at her, says,
"How you doing?"...

532
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:51,338
...and starts talking to his boys.

533
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:55,342
That's the guy she wants to be with,
the 11 th man...

534
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,344
...not any of the 10 men
treating her well...

535
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:59,346
...but the one guy
who couldn't care less.

536
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:03,350
And why? Because for some reason,
women don't want nice.

537
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:06,311
They don't want real.
They don't wanna be treated well.

538
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,313
I mean, not at first,
and sometimes not ever.

539
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,316
And I think that's crazy,
and I refuse to play that game.

540
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,318
I mean, you?
You are a master at it, Sal.

541
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,320
But it's just not me. It's not who I am.

542
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,322
I don't wanna
have to play that game.

543
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:21,326
You know, get a girl
by pretending that I don't like her.

544
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:25,330
I wanna be with a woman who's real,
who digs it when I'm nice to her...

545
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:28,333
...who doesn't see that as a weakness
or take me for granted...

546
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,336
...when I tell her she's more amazing
than anything else...

547
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:32,424
...in the entire world.

548
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:36,341
But unfortunately,
most women aren't like that.

549
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:37,342
They say they are...

550
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:40,345
...and deep down inside,
they wanna be...

551
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:43,348
...but they're not.

552
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:46,351
You know what? He's right.
I never could understand that.

553
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,312
When I was a kid,
every girl I liked had a boyfriend.

554
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:50,314
I'd have to hear about it all the time.

555
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,316
How he'd, you know,
fuck their best friends...

556
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:55,319
...cheat on them, spend their money,
wreck their car.

557
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,321
Then they'd come crying
on my shoulder...

558
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,323
...because I was a good "friend."

559
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:00,329
And I'd ask them why:

560
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,327
"Why don't you dump the guy
treating you like shit and be with me?"

561
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:07,331
I mean, I was right there. I'd lay
the world at their feet if they let me.

562
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,333
But they'd always say
the same thing.

563
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:12,336
"I can't, because I love him.
I just love him."

564
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:13,337
- Yeah.
- How would you know?

565
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,339
Believe me,
being gay doesn't exclude you...

566
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:17,341
...from the neurosis of relationships.

567
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:19,343
I wish it did. It's the same all over.

568
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,346
Everybody's playing the
"I like you, but you don't like me...

569
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:24,393
...when you do like me,
I don't like you" game.

570
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,350
- It's insane.
- Insanity.

571
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:29,311
Well, I hate to admit it,
but I actually have to agree with him.

572
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:32,314
When I was a little kid,
I used to bring girls flowers.

573
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,316
I'd write them poems and shit,
fucking songs.

574
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:36,318
I even gave one... Remember Molly?

575
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:38,320
I gave her that locket
for Valentine's Day.

576
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:40,322
Sal, you wrote songs?

577
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:43,325
Shut up. My point is this.
You remember what she did to me?

578
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:45,327
Kicked me,
threw the locket on the ground...

579
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:48,330
...and ran around telling
the whole school I had fucking cooties.

580
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:50,417
I remember that.
You went home in tears that day.

581
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:53,335
Those weren't tears,
she threw sand in my eyes too.

582
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:56,338
- We were in the first grade, man.
- No, my point is this.

583
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:58,340
Lt was like that for years...

584
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:01,343
...until I discovered the pattern
to Pac-Man.

585
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,345
You got chicks
because you could play Pac-Man?

586
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:05,347
No, stupid,
I'm making an analogy here.

587
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:07,349
Chicks got a pattern. See?
Like Pac-Man.

588
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:11,311
You remember Pac-Man, right?
Pac-Man, motherfucker, had a pattern.

589
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:14,314
As long as you played the pattern
right, you could never lose.

590
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:17,317
And George is right.
For chicks, it's the 11 th-man theory.

591
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:19,319
As soon as you figure out
how to be the 11 th man...

592
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,321
...you got no problem
banging any chick.

593
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:25,325
Only now you have to deal with some
manipulative freak you're stuck with...

594
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:27,327
...because you hooked her so good.

595
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:31,331
Which is why, gentlemen,
I resigned myself a long time ago...

596
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:33,333
...to being a rich motherfucker.

597
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,460
That way I can afford...

598
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:37,337
...to have some young,
hot, gold-digging armpiece...

599
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:42,342
...works out six to eight hours a day,
just to take care of my physical needs.

600
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,344
Well, that's limiting.

601
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,346
What about intellectually,
emotionally?

602
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,348
What about emotionally
or intellectually?

603
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:52,352
Nowadays most women
think monogamy is a type of wood.

604
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,312
They don't know how to be it.

605
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,314
They certainly don't know
how to spell it.

606
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,317
They say men cheat?
Who do you think we're cheating with?

607
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:00,319
Certainly not you, Wayne.

608
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:03,322
You think I'm gonna get emotionally
connected to a woman like that?

609
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:07,326
And if I want intellectual stimulation,
motherfucker, I'll read a book.

610
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,328
You're gonna go
the rest of your life...

611
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:12,331
...just willing to settle
for having to compartmentalize?

612
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:15,334
I don't even fucking understand what
you said, but, yeah, sure, I'll do that.

613
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:19,338
No, I'm serious. At this point in my life,
my idea of synergy...

614
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,346
...is getting a blowjob
from Pamela Anderson...

615
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:23,342
...while reading Dostoyevsky.

616
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:26,345
George, you gotta stop putting chicks
on a pedestal.

617
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:29,348
They'll just shit on you from up there.
Tom too. Christ, me too.

618
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:31,350
Hey, George,
if you want real, that's great.

619
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:34,311
Go deal with Portland bitches
with the braided armpit hair...

620
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:38,315
...and the granola-eating habit,
sporting that fucking bindi.

621
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:41,318
Hey, George. Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey. Hello? Ls that real?

622
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:43,320
Seriously, if I...? I have a question.

623
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:47,324
If I listen to Deepak Chopra,
and I read that Celestine Prophecy...

624
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:50,327
...and I... my fucking ass off all day...

625
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:52,329
...while I reek of BO
and sandalwood...

626
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:54,331
...and I got 10 different kinds
of incense...

627
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:58,335
...coming out my fucking butthole,
does that make me real?

628
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:01,338
Hey, motherfucker.
Am I real, motherfucker?

629
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:02,465
I'll tell you right now.

630
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:07,344
Motherfucker, I may bullshit women,
but I never bullshit myself.

631
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:11,348
Let me tell you,
that is the biggest crock of shit...

632
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:14,351
...I've ever heard in my entire life,
seriously.

633
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,359
- How the fuck would you know...?
- No, no, no.

634
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,313
Please. Mr. Tough-Guy.

635
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,316
Got the whole fucking wide world
sewn up in a tight little box...

636
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:22,483
...and you ain't even 40.

637
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:26,321
Well, I love you, but you ain't
doing nothing but bullshitting.

638
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:27,322
What are you talking about?

639
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:30,325
You're the biggest romantic I know,
more than any of us.

640
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:32,327
Who do you think you're fooling?

641
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,329
Come on, we've all known you
since elementary school too.

642
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:37,332
Big, tough buddy boy,
running around playing gangster.

643
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:39,334
But you didn't start out like that.

644
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,341
You wear your heart on your sleeve.
It's the biggest heart in the world.

645
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:44,339
You still can't figure out...

646
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:47,342
...how to keep people
from taking their shots at it.

647
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:49,344
You wanna talk about indoctrination,
look at yourself.

648
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:52,347
- I didn't say shit about indoctrination.
- You did.

649
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:55,350
You tried to sell Wayne
on how he's not really a homosexual...

650
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,352
...because he didn't
come out of the womb like that.

651
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,314
What about you? You think
you came out of your mother...

652
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,317
...with all that attitude
and shit that makes you you?

653
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,319
You didn't start out that way.

654
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:09,323
You gave a girl a locket necklace,
man, and wrote her a fucking song.

655
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:10,324
You wanna talk about that?

656
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,328
Or you wanna talk about the 11 th man,
game-playing, the vicious circle...

657
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:17,374
...and shit about how you're never
gonna get hurt like when you were 16?

658
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,333
Well, I think you can't help it.

659
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:22,336
I think you do have feelings,
in spite of yourself sometimes.

660
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:26,340
That is what you wrestle with.
I mean, look at yourself, my man.

661
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:29,343
You were affected tonight
by a woman with a glass fucking eye...

662
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,346
...who thought the word "prima donna"
meant "before Madonna."

663
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:36,350
Come on, you're better than that.
You could've been with any girl.

664
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:38,437
Instead, you thought
you'd hook up with a girl...

665
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,314
...so far beneath your standards
that she'd never have to hurt you.

666
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:45,317
Know what? She still hurt you.
What's the point? Why not hold out...

667
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:48,320
...for one that spins your top
and make it great with her?

668
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:51,323
How? If they're all so fucked up,
you tell me how.

669
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,326
You gotta teach them.

670
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,328
You gotta teach them, man.

671
00:33:56,495 --> 00:34:00,332
But that takes being a responsible
member of the planet, Sal.

672
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:02,334
And I don't mean
you gotta be a treehugger...

673
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:03,335
No offense, Georgie.

674
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:06,338
But everybody's so out
for the fucking "me" these days.

675
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:08,340
It's not the X generation
or the Y generation.

676
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,342
It's the brand-new
me generation.

677
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:13,345
Everybody's so busy doing their dance
in the end zone...

678
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:15,347
...they forget
to notice the big picture...

679
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:18,350
...the scoreboard that reads
that we're down by nine touchdowns.

680
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:23,313
If you meet a girl who doesn't know
how to be monogamous...

681
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,360
...you can either say:

682
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:27,317
"This girl's so fucking stupid,"
and you can dump her...

683
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:32,322
...or you can say, "Baby, come here.
Check this out: M-O-N-O-G-A-M-Y."

684
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,324
And you can show her
how to be monogamous...

685
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:36,326
...by being monogamous yourself.

686
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:38,328
You want good people, man,
make them good.

687
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:41,331
Anybody can be an asshole.
Lt takes strength to be a man.

688
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,333
Ls that what you taught Karen?

689
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,336
Are you kidding me?
That's what she taught me.

690
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,338
You remember how I was
before I met her.

691
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,340
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so do I.

692
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:53,343
Lt seems to me that
we saw a lot more of you back then.

693
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,345
But I understand,
you're pussy-whipped.

694
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:58,348
I'm not pussy-whipped.
She's my best friend, that's all.

695
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:01,351
I'd rather hang out with her
than anybody, even you.

696
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:03,312
Then what are you doing here,
sneaking off...

697
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:06,315
...as soon as she falls asleep,
when you know damn well...

698
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:08,317
...she's gonna wake up
and drag your ass upstairs...

699
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,319
...faster than you can say
"codependent"?

700
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:13,322
Yeah, but by the time that happens,
she's gonna be taking me...

701
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:14,323
- ...to exactly where I wanna be.
- Man.

702
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:16,325
- ...to exactly where I wanna be.
- Man.

703
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:20,329
You're living in a fucking fantasyland.
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

704
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:23,332
Since when did this start happening?
I mean, look at you.

705
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:26,335
Karen is a ballbuster, man.
She's a fucking ballbuster.

706
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:29,338
She is such a ballbuster,
she's got you fucked up...

707
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:30,339
...and delusional and shit.

708
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:34,343
Kenny, you're a man.
How can you live like that?

709
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,510
It's not a delusion, Sal.

710
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,346
You and I see things differently,
that's all.

711
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:40,349
You see it as ballbusting,
I see it as passionate.

712
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:41,350
- Do you see?
- You see it as:

713
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:45,312
"I gotta pick her up from the airport."
I see it as, "I get to."

714
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,313
All about how you look at it.

715
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,316
Well, I'm looking at you
like you're out of your mind.

716
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:52,319
If that's what being married's about,
you can keep that shit.

717
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:55,322
Ain't no way this motherfucker
is ever getting married, you heard?

718
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:59,326
Why don't you tell that crock of shit
to Tommy here?

719
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:00,327
He'll appreciate it.

720
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:02,329
For years,
he's cashing his chips in early...

721
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:05,332
...going home to a girl
who up and clotheslines his ass...

722
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:08,335
...and leaves him staggering around
in the street...

723
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:09,336
...wondering what he did wrong.

724
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:11,338
What he did wrong.

725
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:14,341
How about that for a mindfuck?
What? Tell me.

726
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:18,345
Come on, fuckers, tell me.
He didn't love her enough?

727
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,472
He didn't treat her well enough?
I don't think so.

728
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:24,351
We all agree, to a man, that Tommy
is the best person we know.

729
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:27,312
Seems to me I recall, back in the day,
him holding out...

730
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:30,315
...for one that spun his top,
doing what he could to make it work.

731
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,317
- But it didn't work...
- All right.

732
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,404
Because she dumped him,
fucking dumped his ass.

733
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,321
The best guy we know
does everything right.

734
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:38,323
She still dumps him.
Your theory is shit.

735
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,326
I mean, it is fucking a bunch of shit.
You wanna know why?

736
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:45,330
There's two people in a relationship,
and they're both always changing.

737
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:46,331
So no matter what you do...

738
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:50,335
...how are you able to tell what the
other person's gonna do tomorrow?

739
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:51,462
- All right, Sal.
- No...

740
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:54,339
No, all right! Fuck, Sal.

741
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:56,341
- Fuck.
- Sal, please.

742
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:58,343
No, no, Wayne,
you shut up, too, for a second.

743
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,345
I mean, you guys
are all so fucking selfish.

744
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:02,347
All of you, man.

745
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:04,349
You're talking about me
like I'm not here.

746
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:08,312
- Tommy, look, I was just...
- Fuck that. That's fucking bullshit, Sal.

747
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:11,315
I mean, you come into my home
and all you talk about...

748
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:13,317
...is your problems, your feelings,
your relationships.

749
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:16,320
Ever stop to think
what I was going through?

750
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:17,321
I'm fucking dying over here, man.

751
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:21,325
It's not tomorrow or the next day
or in the first fucking grade, Sal.

752
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:23,327
It's happening right now.

753
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:25,329
The love of my life walking
through that door any minute.

754
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:28,332
She's gonna leave me,
and I have no idea what I'm gonna do.

755
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:33,337
All I know is, I can't let that happen.
I gotta get her back.

756
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:36,340
Now, either you guys
help me figure this out now...

757
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:38,342
...or you get out of here
and let me do it on my own...

758
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:41,345
...because whether you think so
or not...

759
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:43,472
...Sara's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

760
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:48,560
And I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to get her back.

761
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:52,564
What if you don't?

762
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,778
What?

763
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:01,323
I was just...

764
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:05,327
Look, I was just
being devil's advocate, all right?

765
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:06,328
What if you don't?

766
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:10,999
What if you don't get her back?
What then?

767
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,335
Well, then I guess
I'll just be like you, Sal.

768
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:15,337
- A man without love.
- Very dramatic.

769
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,339
What kind of man is that, huh?

770
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:21,260
Angry? Vindictive? A monster?

771
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,346
But I'll be way worse than you, Sal,
because you never had what I have.

772
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:27,349
The kind of love I have
in my heart for Sara?

773
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:28,350
You lose that...

774
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:31,311
...well, I'd hate to be any girl
that crosses my path any time soon.

775
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:33,313
Shut the fuck up.
I don't wanna hear it.

776
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,317
If Sara wants to leave me,
I'll start a new chapter of an old club.

777
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:39,319
The He-Man Woman-Haters Club.
Remember that?

778
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:40,320
Remember that shit?

779
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:43,323
With Spanky and Alfalfa
and Buckwheat?

780
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,325
They had
this He-Man Woman-Haters Club.

781
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,327
They didn't take shit from Darla
or any of them bitches.

782
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:51,331
- He's lost his mind.
- They had the right idea back then.

783
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:53,333
I mean, you didn't see Darla...

784
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,420
...or any other chicks
putting on shows, did you?

785
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:57,337
No. Spanky and Alfalfa
ran the show.

786
00:38:57,504 --> 00:39:01,341
And if them bitches wanted a part,
they did what they were told.

787
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:03,343
Starsky and Hutch?
No chicks. Successful.

788
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,345
Baretta?
Lived with an old man and a bird.

789
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:08,348
No chick drama, no problem.
Batman? Gay.

790
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:12,352
But only when he gets tempted by
Catwoman did he have real problems.

791
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,313
Han Solo?
With Chewie, he was fine.

792
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:17,316
He hooks up with Leia,
his ass gets thrown in the carbonite.

793
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:20,319
Chicks are the downfall
of every great man that lived:

794
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:23,322
Mark Antony, Othello, Bill Clinton,
all of them.

795
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:25,324
And he who does not learn
from history...

796
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,326
...is doomed to repeat its mistakes.

797
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:29,372
What was I thinking?
I don't wanna be with Sara.

798
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:33,332
I want nothing to do with her.
If she walked through that door now...

799
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,458
...the best thing I could do
is throw her ass out.

800
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:39,338
I mean, this is still my house, right?
I don't care how much I love her.

801
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:42,341
She can come, she can get her shit,
and she can get the fuck out.

802
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:45,344
I never wanna see Sara again.
I never wanna see another woman.

803
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:47,346
Masturbation, the key
to the universe be.

804
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:54,019
If I never see another woman again,
it'll be too soon in this motherfucker.

805
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:04,488
I'll handle this.

806
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:11,828
Ls this where
the Valentine's thing is?

807
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:37,391
You gonna invite us in or what?

808
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:51,321
Did you see the looks on
those guys' faces when we walked in?

809
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:54,324
- I felt like a steak in a sea of piranha.
- Lt was not that bad.

810
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:55,371
These guys are cute...

811
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:58,328
...more than I can say
for the last party Rachel took us to.

812
00:42:58,495 --> 00:43:01,331
Twenty hot girls and two gross guys?
What's wrong with that?

813
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:04,334
- What you get when you work in porn.
- I don't work in porn.

814
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:05,341
I just do their hair.

815
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:07,337
- Whatever.
- What's that guy Sal doing here?

816
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:09,345
- Isn't he some gangster?
- A wannabe gangster.

817
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:11,341
A wannabe? The man carries a gun.

818
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:14,344
For show. He flashes it around.
He'd never use it.

819
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:17,347
- How would you know?
- Katherine used to go out with him.

820
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:19,349
- Is this true?
- No, it is not true.

821
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:21,351
I slept with him once,
but I never went out with him.

822
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:23,312
He was a perfect gentleman.

823
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,438
- Terrible lover, but a gentleman.
- Terrible lover?

824
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,317
- What do you mean?
- He thinks he's such a stud.

825
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:32,321
- Exactly. He doth protest too much.
- He didn't know how to do it right?

826
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:34,323
Are you kidding?
He did not know how at all.

827
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:37,326
I couldn't get this man to go down
on me if we were on the Titanic.

828
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:39,328
- Shit. Why?
- I don't know.

829
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:41,335
I think he said
he had some sort of germ thing.

830
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:43,332
- Germ thing?
- Like what? A phobia?

831
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:45,334
- A germ phobia?
- I hate when guys say that.

832
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:48,337
- It makes me feel so unsanitary.
- That's because you are.

833
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:50,339
Oh, go fuck yourselves.

834
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:52,341
But what about the penis, Kat?
Was the penis bad too?

835
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:54,343
Yeah, what's with the dick?

836
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,345
Said he's got a cock
the size of Florida.

837
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:58,347
- Is this true?
- No, it is not true. It...

838
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:00,349
- It's what?
- Like the Cape of Good Hope?

839
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:02,351
Like Cape Canaveral?

840
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:06,313
Ls it like the cape
that Superman used to wear?

841
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,315
- Ever seen a Sunday paper rolled up?
- Yes.

842
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:10,317
- Double that.
- No!

843
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:13,320
How bad could that be?
Unless the guy came in seconds.

844
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,322
Quick-draw-mcgraws are the worst.

845
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:17,324
Actually, he was the exact opposite.
He took forever.

846
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:18,371
I got so frustrated...

847
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:22,329
...riding that monster so long
without any foreplay, I went home.

848
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:24,331
- You went home?
- What, in an ambulance?

849
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:25,332
No, in my car.

850
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:28,335
But I did have such blue balls
from the whole experience...

851
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:30,337
...I had to call one of my zerves
to finish the job.

852
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:32,339
A zerves? What's a zerves?

853
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:35,342
Reserves, Amy,
as in the Army Reserves.

854
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:36,343
Always have a couple zerves...

855
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,346
...to call any time
to rectify such a situation.

856
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:41,348
Guys that fix your car,
help you move...

857
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:44,351
...come over in the night
when you hear scary noises.

858
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:45,352
- Don't you have reserves?
- No.

859
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,314
You mean to tell me there is nobody
you can call to get over a breakup?

860
00:44:49,481 --> 00:44:51,316
- I can call my mom.
- That's really not the same, is it?

861
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:55,320
Oh, honey, you are missing out.
You gotta try it sometime.

862
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:56,321
You use them like painkillers.

863
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:58,323
They tell you
the things you wanna hear:

864
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:01,326
How great you are,
how beautiful you are...

865
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:03,328
What a fucking idiot
your boyfriend is.

866
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:05,330
And you get to be totally selfish
in bed.

867
00:45:05,497 --> 00:45:06,331
Because that's what they're for.

868
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:10,335
They know they'll never be Mr. Right.
They're happy being Mr. Right-Now.

869
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:13,338
- Sure beats crying into your pillow.
- Like my mother says:

870
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:16,341
The best way to get over someone
is to get underneath someone else.

871
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:18,343
Amen, sister.

872
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,345
I can't come
from a cock the size of Florida.

873
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:22,347
I need a tongue the size of Florida.

874
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:25,350
- You need Gene Simmons in there.
- Exactly.

875
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:27,358
That's enough.
Jesus Christ, I've heard enough.

876
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,313
That's disgusting, just disgusting.

877
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:32,316
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
What happened to you?

878
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:34,482
You sound like men,
with the blue balls and zerves.

879
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:36,364
I mean, what happened to closeness
and intimacy?

880
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:39,323
When did you two
become so desensitized?

881
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:40,410
You have to have sex...

882
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,327
...at least once every millennium
before you can lecture us.

883
00:45:43,493 --> 00:45:45,329
I might be the only woman left
on Earth...

884
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:47,331
...who can lecture you
on the subject.

885
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:49,377
Listen to yourselves.
Where are your priorities?

886
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:53,337
Instead of getting some guy to rub out
an orgasm and repair your fridge...

887
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:57,341
...don't you want somebody
who will always be there for you...

888
00:45:57,508 --> 00:45:59,343
...to protect you
from those scary noises?

889
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,510
Are you delusional?
You sound like a Hallmark card.

890
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:04,348
You can't argue with me.
You used a word that does not exist.

891
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:07,351
- Really? And what word is that?
- You used the word "always."

892
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:10,312
- "Always" is the key to heartbreak.
- Why?

893
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:12,320
Because we expect
that he will always be there.

894
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:15,317
We expect we'll always be loved,
no matter what we do or look like.

895
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:19,321
That is clearly not the case, is it?
Because we get fat. We get old.

896
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:21,323
We get traded in
for younger models every day.

897
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:22,490
So the simple truth is...

898
00:46:22,491 --> 00:46:25,327
...the only "always"
is that everything changes.

899
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:27,329
Men's whims
are the most changeable of all.

900
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:29,496
So "no, " I guess,
is the answer to your question.

901
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:33,335
No, I do not want some guy to tell me
he's always gonna be there...

902
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:36,338
...to protect me from scary noises,
because then I know he's a liar.

903
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:39,341
- I can protect myself, thank you.
- With what, your vibrator?

904
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:41,343
Are you gonna massage them
to death?

905
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:42,344
- I don't need no vibrator.
- I know.

906
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:45,347
You've got the population of Uruguay
on speed dial...

907
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:47,349
...in case the Boston Celtics
don't work out.

908
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:50,352
You know, you are
such a fucking hypocrite, Laura.

909
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:53,313
You're one of those girls
who sucks a million cocks...

910
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,316
...but only slept with three guys,
so think you're some saint.

911
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:59,319
You're not. Blowjobs are exactly
the same thing as having sex.

912
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,321
Ln fact, to some men,
probably worse.

913
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:03,323
So not true.
Blowjobs are different than having sex.

914
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,326
- It's not even the same thing.
- Oh, it's not?

915
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,328
It's not the same
to take some strange man's dick out...

916
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:11,331
...when you don't know where it's been
or if he's showered...

917
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:14,334
...put it in your mouth, suck on it,
and swallow his come...

918
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:17,337
...when you've known the guy
for a few hours?

919
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,340
- You're right. Not the same thing.
- Come on, a couple hours?

920
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:23,343
What is it, then, precious?
A few days at the very most?

921
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:24,344
I mean, when you add it up...

922
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:27,347
...what is the total time
you need to spend with a guy...

923
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:30,350
...before you're on your knees
getting a throat culture?

924
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:32,352
What, six hours on the first date,
four on the next?

925
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,315
- The time the two of you had "coffee"?
- Why are you picking on me?

926
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:38,317
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

927
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:41,320
But you're full of shit,
and I wouldn't be any real friend...

928
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:45,324
...if I didn't call that nice-girl bullshit
you sell to every guy you go out with.

929
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,326
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know exactly what.

930
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:49,328
Lt means,
when you start seeing a guy...

931
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:52,331
...do you tell him about
the 8000 blowjobs you've given...

932
00:47:52,497 --> 00:47:56,335
...or do you try to sell him on the fact
that you've slept with three guys?

933
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:58,337
That's what I thought.
So don't try selling it to me...

934
00:47:58,504 --> 00:48:01,340
...because then you're not being
a good friend to me.

935
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:04,343
You want a real relationship?
Fine. Be honest.

936
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,345
If the man can't handle the truth
about you...

937
00:48:06,512 --> 00:48:08,347
...he can go fuck himself.

938
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:12,142
You can't handle the truth.

939
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:16,313
Remember that?
With the guy from the Lakers game?

940
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,316
Rachel, since when are you anyone
to tell anybody about relationships?

941
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:23,320
I'm the one woman in this room
who sees things the way they are...

942
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:25,322
...instead of seeing them
the way we want them to be.

943
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:28,325
You have stuffed animals on your bed,
bunny magnets...

944
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:30,333
...and My Secret Garden crap
around your house.

945
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:33,330
Tell me you have a firm grip
on reality.

946
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:35,332
Relationships end,
and they all end badly.

947
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:36,333
Otherwise, they wouldn't end.

948
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,337
And the only "always"
is that they always end badly.

949
00:48:40,504 --> 00:48:42,464
- You'd better change your perspective.
- I'm sorry.

950
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:45,346
- I don't choose to see it that way.
- Exactly. That's exactly my point.

951
00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:48,345
But the reality is, they do.
Think about it.

952
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:51,348
The best-case scenario
in a relationship is one of you dies.

953
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:54,351
And that's the best it ever gets.
Ls that a design flaw or what?

954
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:57,312
You meet the love of your life.
You're together 50, 60 years.

955
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:00,315
Then one of you dies, leaving
the other heartbroken and alone.

956
00:49:00,482 --> 00:49:04,319
Alone to live out your miserable life,
trying not to die from pain...

957
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:07,322
...and your only solace is bingo
and applesauce.

958
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:09,489
- You go, girl.
- And down from that, getting dumped.

959
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,326
Which I used to think was worse
than dumping.

960
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:14,329
You feel so out of control,
ugly, worthless...

961
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:16,456
...unworthy, self-conscious
and just fucking lame.

962
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:17,332
I mean, Jesus.

963
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:21,336
I used to think getting dumped was
worse than dumping someone else...

964
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:23,338
...until finally
I dumped someone myself.

965
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:25,340
Let me tell you something, ladies.

966
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:28,343
Lt is way, way, way worse
than getting dumped yourself...

967
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,346
...because now you have to deal
with the fact that it is your idea.

968
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:34,349
Lt was your action, so you're
constantly second-guessing yourself.

969
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:37,352
"Did I do the right thing?
Ls he the best I'm gonna find?

970
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:40,314
Am I gonna be alone for life
because I threw away the best thing...

971
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,316
...that's ever gonna happen to me?"

972
00:49:42,482 --> 00:49:45,319
And that comes before
you have to try to turn that person...

973
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:47,321
...into someone you could hate...

974
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:50,324
...so you could try to find a way
to live with that decision.

975
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,326
I think it's pretty clear.

976
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:55,329
I would rather get dumped
than dump someone else.

977
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:59,333
But then, I really don't ever
have to worry about that again.

978
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:01,919
Ladies.

979
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:07,341
- Can I have a Bushmills, straight?
- Yeah, you got it.

980
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:10,344
Hi. My name is Tom,
and this is my place.

981
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:14,348
And the thing is, I'm going
through a lot of unexpected things...

982
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:15,349
...and I really, really, would...

983
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:17,351
Tom, don't worry about it.

984
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:18,352
We're gonna have one drink
and then go.

985
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:21,313
I got the picture
when we walked in the door.

986
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,314
Well, I'm sorry... You did?

987
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:25,317
I don't mean
to make you feel uncomfortable...

988
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:26,318
...but what picture is that, exactly?

989
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:30,322
That your girlfriend broke up with you
and she's on her way here...

990
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:31,323
...to pick up those suitcases.

991
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,325
You got all that
from walking in here?

992
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:35,327
No, I got that from the letter
on the table.

993
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:39,331
We were all reading it in the bathroom.
Tom, it is absolutely horrible.

994
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:41,333
Oh, my God.

995
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,341
- Are you kidding me?
- What just got into her?

996
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:45,462
- No one yet, that's the problem.
- Rachel's fine.

997
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:48,340
Fucked up, insecure and emotional.
Sure, she's fine.

998
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:51,343
Do you know how hard it is
to do what she does?

999
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:55,347
- Yes, scheduling can be a problem.
- Rachel tells men where they stand.

1000
00:50:55,514 --> 00:50:58,350
- Behind her while she's bent over.
- Rachel tells men the truth.

1001
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:00,352
Not what they wanna hear,
the actual truth.

1002
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:03,319
That's admirable, considering that,
as women, we're conditioned to lie.

1003
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,316
- What are you talking about?
- I got to hear this.

1004
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:09,319
You know how a man, if he has sex
with a hundred women, he's a stud?

1005
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:11,321
A woman sleeps with 10 guys,
she's a whore.

1006
00:51:11,488 --> 00:51:14,324
How does a woman
not feel she has to lie...

1007
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:16,326
...with that ridiculous
double standard?

1008
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:18,328
That's not lying,
just not giving all the information.

1009
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:21,331
- No, that's justification.
- If men weren't so infantile...

1010
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,378
...about their women's history,
we wouldn't lie.

1011
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,336
Know how easy my relationship
would've been...

1012
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:29,339
...if I didn't have to deal with
"Did you fuck him?" questions?

1013
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:31,341
"Did you fuck him?
Did you fuck him?"

1014
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:34,344
"Who was that? Did you fuck him?
Who you on the phone with?"

1015
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:37,347
"Why's there a guy's voice
on your machine? You fuck him?"

1016
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:39,434
- The younger the guy is, the worse.
- Or Latino.

1017
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:42,352
Heaven forbid they meet anyone
you have been with.

1018
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,313
- It's sulking for days.
- Or attitude.

1019
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:47,316
- They never stop bringing shit up.
- "Why don't you fuck so-and-so?"

1020
00:51:47,482 --> 00:51:51,320
That's just when you're dealing with
their insecurities about other men.

1021
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:53,322
Don't even get me started
on the bedroom.

1022
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:56,325
Know how patient I have to be
with these oversized babies?

1023
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:57,326
Like my mother says:

1024
00:51:57,492 --> 00:52:00,329
"I already got two children,
I don't need a third."

1025
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:03,332
You admit that lying is part
and parcel to your relationships?

1026
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:06,338
Ls it lying to tell a child there's a Santa
if it makes him feel better?

1027
00:52:06,502 --> 00:52:09,338
Ls it lying not to tell a man
about fucking the Raiders...

1028
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:12,341
...if it makes him feel better
about marrying you?

1029
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:14,343
As far as I can see,
we don't have any choice.

1030
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,346
If I have to choose between
not telling a man every detail...

1031
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:20,349
...about my life
so things go smoothly...

1032
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:22,351
...or being honest
and staying up all night fighting...

1033
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:24,311
...there ain't no choice, you know?

1034
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:27,314
I do. And, Amy, you're right.
Men can't handle the truth.

1035
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:30,317
And the sooner we learn that,
the smoother things will be.

1036
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:31,318
Excuse me.

1037
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:34,321
Sorry, I can't believe
things have gotten that bad...

1038
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:37,324
...that relationships have turned
into one big coping contest...

1039
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:39,332
...we try to endure
like Chinese water torture.

1040
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:41,413
See, sweetie,
that's why I only date married men.

1041
00:52:41,495 --> 00:52:45,332
I know they're unavailable,
and there's a limit to the torture.

1042
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:48,335
That is so wrong on so many levels,
I don't even know what to say.

1043
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:50,337
You went out with Sal.
He was never married.

1044
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:54,341
I know that now, but I didn't then.
The man used to wear a wedding ring.

1045
00:52:54,508 --> 00:52:57,344
He later told me that he wore it
to attract women.

1046
00:52:57,511 --> 00:52:58,345
- Did it?
- Hell, it attracted me.

1047
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:00,347
Oh, my God, Katherine, why?

1048
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:03,350
Because, Deb,
I figure if a man is married...

1049
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:06,311
...there's gotta be something good
about him. At least he can commit.

1050
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:09,314
You make him cheat.
The commitment goes out the window.

1051
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:10,315
By that time, I'm over him.

1052
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:13,318
Don't you understand
what I'm trying to tell you here?

1053
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:15,320
- No.
- It's not about the sex, sweetie.

1054
00:53:15,487 --> 00:53:21,618
Lt never is. Anybody can have sex.
It's about the walk up the stairs.

1055
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:24,329
Okay.

1056
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:28,333
Ls it me, or is everybody else
on this planet just absolutely crazy?

1057
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,335
Oh, no, we're all definitely crazy.

1058
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:34,339
It's just the ones who think they're not
that you have to worry about.

1059
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:39,011
But what do I know?
I don't know anything.

1060
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:55,337
This is bad. This is bad.
This is really, really, really bad.

1061
00:54:55,504 --> 00:54:56,344
- Relax, Tom.
- Relax?

1062
00:54:56,505 --> 00:54:59,341
There are girls in my apartment,
hot girls, drinking.

1063
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:02,344
When Sara gets here,
she's gonna think I'm being blasé.

1064
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:03,511
- No, she's not.
- She is.

1065
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:05,347
She's not gonna think you're blasé.

1066
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:07,474
The girls being here
could work to your advantage.

1067
00:55:07,516 --> 00:55:10,352
Chicks see you with other chicks,
it make them want you more.

1068
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:12,312
I'm not out with these chicks.

1069
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:15,315
- She doesn't know that.
- You think I want her to think that?

1070
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:17,317
- I'd be done for sure.
- You're broken up. Do what you want.

1071
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,319
- It's been an hour. So?
- So? So?

1072
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:21,321
You're either broken up or not,
no gray area.

1073
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:24,324
People get fucked up
in the in-between stage.

1074
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:27,327
You're not together,
but not supposed to fuck anyone else.

1075
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:29,329
The one who fools around first
is the bad guy.

1076
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:32,332
"I can't believe you're with someone.
It's only been two weeks."

1077
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:35,335
Whoever doesn't move on always
feels like they got hit by a truck.

1078
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:38,338
Yeah, but I don't wanna move on.

1079
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:41,341
- I already feel like I got hit by a truck.
- You may wanna have another drink.

1080
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:45,345
Let me have one of those too.
Scotch, rocks. Hello, I'm Katherine.

1081
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:46,346
Hi. Ken. Of course you know Sal.

1082
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:49,349
- And this is Tom.
- Hi, what time is she getting here?

1083
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:51,351
- Great, everybody knows.
- Any second.

1084
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:53,312
Really? Do you want us to go?

1085
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:55,314
No, I'm still trying
to think out my strategy.

1086
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,316
- You ever think about using us?
- See?

1087
00:55:57,482 --> 00:55:58,482
- Maybe.
- Feel free, honey.

1088
00:55:58,483 --> 00:56:00,319
Women want what they can't have.

1089
00:56:00,485 --> 00:56:02,321
Believe me, if she walks in...

1090
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:05,324
...thinking she has the upper hand
and finds you with us...

1091
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,326
...looking like a pimp,
she might just decide to stay.

1092
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:09,328
- You think so?
- Honey, I know so.

1093
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:11,330
Ambivalence
is a powerful aphrodisiac.

1094
00:56:11,496 --> 00:56:14,333
I see someone who's actually hot.
Come on, let's go get extroverted.

1095
00:56:14,499 --> 00:56:18,337
Unless you're Sal, in which case
you come off looking like a fool.

1096
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:21,340
Yes, Sal the fool. But I understand
he has ways of making up for it.

1097
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:24,343
- I wouldn't know about that.
- Don't play coy with me.

1098
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,345
- I know you were practically engaged.
- I wouldn't say that.

1099
00:56:26,512 --> 00:56:29,348
- Yes, but you did meet Uncle Miltie.
- Can I take the Fifth?

1100
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:32,351
Please, I've been trying
to crack this bottle open for years.

1101
00:56:32,518 --> 00:56:33,352
Please, I've been trying
to crack this bottle open for years.

1102
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:35,312
Oh, my God,
those shoes are incredible.

1103
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:36,313
- Don't you love them?
- More than life.

1104
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,316
What I'd give to be a size 5.
Charles David?

1105
00:56:39,483 --> 00:56:41,318
- Prada.
- Oh, my God, they're adorable.

1106
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:43,320
- Do they do custom orders?
- My God, are you kidding?

1107
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:45,328
They're my design.
I work for the manufacturer.

1108
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,324
- Are you serious?
- Like totally.

1109
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:49,326
Oh, my God.
I'm getting married in June.

1110
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:52,329
I would love if those works of art
could be part of my ensemble.

1111
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:54,331
- Are you serious?
- Like totally.

1112
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:57,334
Oh, my God, I'm flattered.
I'll totally make it happen.

1113
00:56:57,501 --> 00:57:00,337
- Tell me everything. Ls he to die for?
- To die for this man is easy.

1114
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:03,340
- It's living for him that's hard.
- Oh, my God.

1115
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:06,343
You can't pull the 11 th-man theory
on Debbie, she's a friend.

1116
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,346
You can't fuck your friends,
who can you fuck? How you doing?

1117
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:11,348
- Hi, I'm George.
- Hi, George. I'm Amy.

1118
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:13,435
- What do you got there?
- It's an Etch A Sketch.

1119
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:16,311
I love how Tom leaves it out
to see what people do.

1120
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:18,313
So you did know what it was
when you asked?

1121
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,315
- Yeah, but, you know...
- Why did you say:

1122
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:23,318
"Hey, what do you got there?"
like you didn't know what it was?

1123
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:24,485
No, no, no, I didn't say:

1124
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:28,323
"Hey, what do you got there?" like,
"I don't know what that is."

1125
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,325
I said,
"Hey, what do you got there?" like:

1126
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:31,326
"What do you got there?" Like:

1127
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:35,330
"I know what that is, but
for some reason, I want you to tell me."

1128
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:37,332
What is that,
like some sort of game for you?

1129
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:39,334
I have no idea what to say
right now.

1130
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:43,338
You don't need to say anything, silly.
I'm kidding. Sit down.

1131
00:57:43,505 --> 00:57:45,340
- Okay.
- I'm making a picture.

1132
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:46,341
Wow, you did a whole thing.

1133
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:49,344
- It's two people holding hands.
- Holding hands. Of course.

1134
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,346
I thought it was the symbol
for United Way.

1135
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:54,349
- It stands for unity. And friendship.
- Unity? Friendship?

1136
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:56,351
Do you know how to make origami?

1137
00:57:56,518 --> 00:57:59,313
Random segues aside, no, I...
Sadly, I don't.

1138
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:01,315
But if you give me paper
and a pen...

1139
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:03,317
...I can show you something
origami-esque.

1140
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:05,319
- God, are you serious?
- Like totally.

1141
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:08,322
- Excuse me, are you Sal?
- Depends. Are you a bill collector?

1142
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:10,324
- No.
- Were you once a man?

1143
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:13,327
- No. Oh, yeah.
- You over 18? Then, yeah, I'm Sal.

1144
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:15,329
How you doing? You know Tom?

1145
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:18,332
Tom, sorry, it's taking us longer
to get out than I thought.

1146
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:20,334
I'm gonna gather the girls.
We're gonna go.

1147
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:22,336
No, no, don't go. Right, Tom?

1148
00:58:22,503 --> 00:58:25,339
I think I just heard George
break out his Ouija board.

1149
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:27,386
I can't do this.
I'm gonna go see if she's here.

1150
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:30,344
Don't do that. She's not here.
If she was, she'd be here, right?

1151
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:32,352
- Not if she's trying to find parking.
- Tom...

1152
00:58:32,513 --> 00:58:36,350
- I'm gonna go outside and check.
- Don't go.

1153
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:38,352
- Wow, he's got it bad.
- No shit.

1154
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:40,312
- I hope I never get that way.
- Me neither.

1155
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:42,314
- What'd you say your name was?
- Rachel.

1156
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:45,317
That's right, Rachel.
You're Kat's friend, huh?

1157
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:47,319
- Apparently, so are you.
- A long time ago.

1158
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:49,366
Hope she didn't have
too many bad things to say.

1159
00:58:49,488 --> 00:58:51,323
Only thing I remember her saying...

1160
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,450
...is you didn't feel well
the night you went out.

1161
00:58:53,492 --> 00:58:56,328
- Really?
- Yeah, said you were a little hoarse.

1162
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:58,330
- Really?
- Yes, he's on his way over.

1163
00:58:58,497 --> 00:59:00,332
- Oh, my God, what's his name?
- Kwame Damfu.

1164
00:59:00,499 --> 00:59:02,334
But I call him Chocolate Thunder.

1165
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:04,461
- Oh, my God, is he black?
- Girlfriend, is he ever.

1166
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:07,339
He's from the island,
so he smells like the ocean.

1167
00:59:07,506 --> 00:59:09,341
Put your ear to his chest,
you hear waves.

1168
00:59:09,508 --> 00:59:10,348
Do your parents know?

1169
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:13,345
Wouldn't know a bowling ball
if it hit them in the head.

1170
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:16,348
The world can keep their opinions
to themselves.

1171
00:59:16,515 --> 00:59:18,350
- But what about the sex?
- You gotta talk about the sex.

1172
00:59:18,517 --> 00:59:20,352
- How else will you learn?
- Learn?

1173
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:23,313
You're talking to a man who can
suck a baby through a bench.

1174
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,315
Do you think I got that way
on my own?

1175
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:27,317
I can't even believe I'm hearing this.

1176
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:30,320
- Will you teach me?
- For Prada shoes? Anything.

1177
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:31,321
Anything?

1178
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:33,323
Any one thing about yourself
you could change.

1179
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:36,326
- Five.
- One, two, three, four, five.

1180
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:39,329
I think I would like
to change the way I look at the world.

1181
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:41,331
- Green.
- Really? How so? G-R-E-E-N.

1182
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:43,333
I'd like to look at the world...

1183
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,335
...as though every single person
on Earth...

1184
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:47,337
...was totally and completely
enlightened except me.

1185
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:49,339
You don't say.

1186
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:51,341
I'd always learn something new
from everyone I meet.

1187
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:53,343
- Interesting.
- Blue.

1188
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,470
- There's no blue.
- Red.

1189
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:57,347
R-E-D. Basically,
no experience would ever be lost.

1190
00:59:57,514 --> 01:00:00,350
No matter how much adversity
you're faced with...

1191
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:03,312
...you'd always continue to grow.

1192
01:00:03,478 --> 01:00:05,478
- Pick an environmental organization.
- Greenpeace.

1193
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,317
Look under the flap for Greenpeace.

1194
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:11,320
Oh, my God.
What do you think that means?

1195
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:14,323
What do you do with your hands?
Just twist it on the stroke?

1196
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:15,324
- Or do you go handsfree?
- Oh, my God.

1197
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:17,326
I am so glad you asked me that.

1198
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:21,330
Whoever's down there for you couldn't
possibly know what you need them to.

1199
01:00:21,496 --> 01:00:24,333
It's the same with us.
I know men who make women stop.

1200
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:26,335
- "It's not a fucking artichoke."
- Are you kidding?

1201
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:29,338
- Girlfriend, I so am not.
- Do you think that's me?

1202
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:31,505
- I thought I was so good.
- Honey, every woman does.

1203
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:35,344
Lt takes a man to know a man.
Frankly, I am like the Shaolin master.

1204
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:36,345
- Are you serious?
- Totally.

1205
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:38,347
- What do I do?
- First you gotta love it.

1206
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:43,352
If you don't, you shouldn't be there.
You have to get in there and just:

1207
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:46,313
I cannot tell you what a
positive attitude will do for a blowjob.

1208
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,315
- Got it.
- Next, you gotta take it all.

1209
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:50,317
- All?
- You want perfection, don't you?

1210
01:00:50,484 --> 01:00:52,325
But what if he's, like, Shaq?
I'm a small girl.

1211
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:55,322
Then, honey, you have to learn
to unhinge like a fucking python.

1212
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:58,325
You will never be queen
until you learn to swallow the king.

1213
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:00,327
- Oh, my God.
- You gotta work that taint.

1214
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:02,329
Use a lot of saliva,
absolutely no teeth.

1215
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:05,332
Last but certainly not least,
the quintessential move.

1216
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:07,334
- The keys to the kingdom.
- Yes?

1217
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:09,336
The way to fucking bang cock
in Bangkok is...

1218
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,338
- Yeah?
- You gotta lick that ass.

1219
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:13,340
Don't even be shy about it,
sweetheart.

1220
01:01:13,507 --> 01:01:15,342
- You gotta get all up in there.
- What?

1221
01:01:15,509 --> 01:01:18,345
Ask any man who's had it done well
and they will tell you:

1222
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:22,349
"Lt ain't a blowjob
until you've tapped that ass."

1223
01:01:22,516 --> 01:01:24,351
I cringe to think
what else she had to say.

1224
01:01:24,518 --> 01:01:26,311
- She didn't say much.
- Compared to what?

1225
01:01:26,478 --> 01:01:29,314
- Girls talk. You know this.
- I guess that rules out you and me.

1226
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:31,316
- Why?
- Don't girls have a code?

1227
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:33,318
I've been Katherine,
a friend of yours, so...

1228
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:37,322
If I met a girl that'd been with a friend,
she'd be off-limits till the end of time.

1229
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:40,325
Don't you girls have that same rule?

1230
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:42,327
Some do,
but women are more competitive...

1231
01:01:42,494 --> 01:01:45,330
...so once word gets out on a man
with potential...

1232
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:47,332
...women do
some pretty outlandish shit.

1233
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:48,333
Really?

1234
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,335
Nothing so overt
as the 11 th-man theory.

1235
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:53,338
But women have to make everything
seem like the man's idea.

1236
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:56,341
- You know about 11 th-man?
- Doesn't everybody?

1237
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:58,388
- George told you, didn't he?
- Yep, at the bar.

1238
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:02,347
- Bastard.
- You see, women are more subtle.

1239
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:03,348
- They circle.
- Like sharks.

1240
01:02:03,515 --> 01:02:05,350
They get a man in their sights...

1241
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:08,312
...and put themselves
in close physical proximity to him...

1242
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:11,315
...so he's forced to make a move,
making him think he is the aggressor.

1243
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:14,318
You go through that
just to get a guy to talk?

1244
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:16,320
You have no idea
what we go through.

1245
01:02:16,486 --> 01:02:18,322
You guys are like
the fucking Godfather or something.

1246
01:02:18,488 --> 01:02:21,325
If you're so smart and know so much,
what am I supposed to do?

1247
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:24,328
You're supposed to ask me
to go outside...

1248
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:26,374
...to help you bring that thing in
from the car.

1249
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:29,333
And somehow,
we never seem to make it back.

1250
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:31,335
- Really?
- Really.

1251
01:02:31,502 --> 01:02:33,422
- Remind me never to piss you off.
- Don't worry.

1252
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:36,340
I'll make sure
you get all the right instructions.

1253
01:02:36,507 --> 01:02:38,387
What instructions?
Take two parts H, one part O.

1254
01:02:38,509 --> 01:02:40,344
Then pour them down the drain.

1255
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:42,346
You never water down
a 40-year-old Scotch.

1256
01:02:42,513 --> 01:02:45,349
I'm glad to see Tom has you around
to stay on top of these things.

1257
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:49,311
I'm trying to get as numb as possible
before Tom's girl gets here.

1258
01:02:49,478 --> 01:02:51,313
This is gonna hurt me
almost as bad him.

1259
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,315
You really think she's over him?

1260
01:02:53,482 --> 01:02:55,317
Women don't make a move
unless they're ready.

1261
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:58,320
They could be with a guy
and spend the last six months...

1262
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:01,323
...trying to get over the guy,
so when they're ready, they move on.

1263
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:03,325
Guys are totally different.

1264
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:06,328
When they break up, they do it fast,
but can spend years...

1265
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:09,331
...trying to get over the girl
because they don't think it through.

1266
01:03:09,498 --> 01:03:11,458
I take it you don't have
any huge love problems...

1267
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,335
...walking through that door.

1268
01:03:13,502 --> 01:03:14,336
No, I'm married.

1269
01:03:14,503 --> 01:03:18,340
That's why you're out at 3:00
in the morning drinking with the boys.

1270
01:03:18,507 --> 01:03:21,343
No, I'm not exactly out drinking,
I live upstairs.

1271
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:24,346
- Your wife doesn't drink?
- No, I don't sleep. I'm an architect.

1272
01:03:24,513 --> 01:03:27,349
I do most of my drawing at night,
and when my wife nods off...

1273
01:03:27,516 --> 01:03:30,352
...I sometimes come down here
to procrastinate.

1274
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:33,313
Okay, so are you gonna
stick with that one...

1275
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,316
...or you want some time
to come up with something else?

1276
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:38,324
Man, I ain't got time
to think of nothing else.

1277
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:40,320
- She's not here now.
- She's gonna be.

1278
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:42,322
The anticipation
is giving me a panic attack.

1279
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:45,325
Can you please just calm down?
Just relax and breathe.

1280
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:47,327
Oh, yeah, right. Breathe, breathe.

1281
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:49,374
People say, "Breathe,"
when you can't breathe.

1282
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:52,332
If you could, you'd be breathing.
Makes no sense.

1283
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:54,334
A lot of things don't make sense,
like waiting outside...

1284
01:03:54,501 --> 01:03:58,338
...for a woman who doesn't appreciate
you and has no idea who you are.

1285
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:01,341
- What are you talking about?
- How long have you been together?

1286
01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:02,348
- Three years?
- Yeah.

1287
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:05,345
- Did you ever think about cheating?
- No.

1288
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:07,347
- Ever lie to her? Ever hit her?
- No. No.

1289
01:04:07,514 --> 01:04:08,435
- Treat her badly?
- No.

1290
01:04:08,515 --> 01:04:10,350
- Tell her she was beautiful?
- Every day.

1291
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:12,352
- Remember her birthday?
- Course.

1292
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:15,314
And you bought her flowers,
even for no apparent reason at all?

1293
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,318
- Yeah.
- That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1294
01:04:19,484 --> 01:04:21,404
You are a good man.
You are a decent human being.

1295
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:23,327
If she doesn't know
what kind of man you are...

1296
01:04:23,488 --> 01:04:26,325
...then I am sorry,
she doesn't deserve to be with you.

1297
01:04:26,491 --> 01:04:29,328
So now you're out here,
freaking out for no good reason.

1298
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:31,330
No, I think
there's a pretty good reason.

1299
01:04:31,496 --> 01:04:34,833
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1300
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:41,340
I was gonna ask Sara
to marry me tonight.

1301
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:42,341
What?

1302
01:04:42,508 --> 01:04:45,344
I went to the bar to knock back
a couple shots of liquid courage...

1303
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:48,347
...so I can come home
and have the nerve to ask her.

1304
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:49,354
Never got the chance.

1305
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:53,352
- And she still doesn't know?
- No.

1306
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:54,311
But wait a sec. No, no, no.

1307
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:57,314
What about this party
and all of these people in there?

1308
01:04:57,481 --> 01:05:00,317
Sal invited you guys, didn't he?
I mean, I didn't.

1309
01:05:00,484 --> 01:05:01,318
I only invited him, Ken and George.

1310
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:04,321
I thought it would be cool
if they were here when I asked.

1311
01:05:04,488 --> 01:05:07,324
Surprise them all, you know,
it being Valentine's Day.

1312
01:05:07,491 --> 01:05:10,327
You're telling me
all those guys don't know either?

1313
01:05:10,494 --> 01:05:12,329
No. I think it's actually ironic...

1314
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:15,332
...that all Sara ever talked about
was us getting married...

1315
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:19,336
...and now when I'm finally ready
to do it, she's gone.

1316
01:05:19,503 --> 01:05:21,338
Do you think maybe
she got sick of waiting?

1317
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:23,340
I don't know.

1318
01:05:23,507 --> 01:05:25,342
You have to tell her.
You know that, Tom.

1319
01:05:25,509 --> 01:05:28,345
I know it's gonna seem
like really bad timing and everything...

1320
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:30,347
...but you know you have to tell her.

1321
01:05:30,514 --> 01:05:34,351
- It's not too late.
- I don't know, Deb.

1322
01:05:34,518 --> 01:05:36,311
I mean, it just doesn't seem right.

1323
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:39,314
Girl not wanting to be with you
because you don't ask her to marry...

1324
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:42,317
...within the time frame
she feels is appropriate?

1325
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:45,320
- What about love?
- Tom...

1326
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:47,322
I always wanted to marry Sara, Deb.
Always.

1327
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:50,325
I just wanted it to be my idea,
you know?

1328
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:52,327
And not feel
like I'm being pressured...

1329
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:56,331
...into doing something
I was gonna do in the first place.

1330
01:05:56,498 --> 01:06:00,335
If... If two people really love each other,
that's what should matter.

1331
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:02,462
And all this necessity to get married
and stuff...

1332
01:06:02,504 --> 01:06:04,339
...is just insecurity.

1333
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:07,342
I hate to break it to you, Tom,
but women need security.

1334
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,344
Everybody does, Deb, don't they?

1335
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:11,346
- What exactly are you trying to say?
- I'm not trying to say anything.

1336
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:13,348
- What exactly are you trying to say?
- I'm not trying to say anything.

1337
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:15,350
I just know men, that's all.

1338
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:17,352
- You do?
- Especially the married kind.

1339
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,313
And I know
that if you're sneaking out...

1340
01:06:19,479 --> 01:06:22,316
...at 3:00 in the morning
while your wife's in bed sleeping...

1341
01:06:22,482 --> 01:06:25,319
...then you're not
just down here drinking, baby.

1342
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:28,322
- You're here looking for something.
- And what do you suppose that is?

1343
01:06:28,488 --> 01:06:31,325
- Probably yesterday.
- Yesterday?

1344
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:34,328
You can't just go out and win
the Kentucky Derby every year.

1345
01:06:34,494 --> 01:06:37,331
Eventually they gotta
put you out to stud.

1346
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:40,334
But I bet you used to be the man
back in the day, didn't you?

1347
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:42,336
Okay, hold on.

1348
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:44,338
What's all this "yesterday"
and "used to be" business?

1349
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:47,341
Oh, now, sugar, don't go
getting any more gray hairs over it.

1350
01:06:47,508 --> 01:06:50,344
Lt happens to every man,
and I can tell by looking at you...

1351
01:06:50,511 --> 01:06:54,348
...I bet right before you hung it up,
you left a trail behind you.

1352
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:57,355
Probably had their panties all wet,
lungs breathing hard, talking about:

1353
01:06:57,518 --> 01:07:02,314
"Can I come by and pick up that thing
I accidentally left on purpose?"

1354
01:07:02,481 --> 01:07:04,441
But you got bored
and thought you'd settle down...

1355
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:06,318
...with a woman
who'd settle you down.

1356
01:07:06,485 --> 01:07:10,322
You didn't realize that sort of shit
got to happen from the inside.

1357
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:12,324
Ain't no woman on Earth
can do that for you.

1358
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:13,491
But now you're married...

1359
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:16,328
...with that wolf still running around
in your head, screaming:

1360
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:19,331
"Oh, I got to get out and run."

1361
01:07:19,498 --> 01:07:22,334
So that's why, on restless nights
like this when you can't sleep...

1362
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:25,337
...you feel the need to come here
and rub against it.

1363
01:07:25,504 --> 01:07:26,338
You know why, Kenny?

1364
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:29,341
Because deep down inside,
you are still the man.

1365
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:31,343
- Thank you.
- Good night.

1366
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,346
I'll be right there.
Excuse me, Tom, I'll say good night.

1367
01:07:34,513 --> 01:07:37,349
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna show Rachel that thing.

1368
01:07:37,516 --> 01:07:40,352
- What thing?
- You know, that thing in my car.

1369
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:42,312
- No, I don't know. What thing?
- You know, that thing.

1370
01:07:42,479 --> 01:07:45,315
Ln my car.
The can't-get-lost system.

1371
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:47,317
- Oh, the can't-get-lost system.
- Can't-get-lost system.

1372
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:51,321
- Also known as the Northstar system.
- The Northstar system.

1373
01:07:51,488 --> 01:07:53,323
I thought you were gonna stay
and help me out.

1374
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:57,327
I'm not good with the boy-girl thing.
Anything I say is gonna make it worse.

1375
01:07:57,494 --> 01:07:59,329
I don't think that's necessarily true.

1376
01:07:59,496 --> 01:08:01,331
I'm dealing with a force
greater than my own.

1377
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:02,378
If you'll excuse me...

1378
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:06,336
I'm gonna go show Rachel
the Northstar system in my car.

1379
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:09,339
Good night, Tom.

1380
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:12,342
I never thought I'd say this,
but Sal may have met his match.

1381
01:08:12,509 --> 01:08:14,350
Believe me,
you don't even know the half of it.

1382
01:08:14,511 --> 01:08:17,347
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

1383
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:19,514
I'm about to open the door.
What does it look like?

1384
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:21,351
When you're with me,
you don't touch a door.

1385
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:23,312
Not that you can't. I know you can.

1386
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:26,315
Lt would just be my honor
if you let me do that for you.

1387
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:29,318
Are you gonna walk on the street
when I'm on the sidewalk?

1388
01:08:29,484 --> 01:08:32,321
And behind when you go up the stairs,
in front when you go down.

1389
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:35,324
I know my Emily Post.

1390
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:37,326
- I'm impressed.
- No need, really.

1391
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:39,328
It's what every man should know
and no man really does.

1392
01:08:39,494 --> 01:08:41,330
Will you let me pick up the check?

1393
01:08:41,496 --> 01:08:45,334
You can pretend to reach, just so
I can say, "Baby, don't be ridiculous."

1394
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:48,337
Katherine did say
you were a gentleman.

1395
01:08:48,504 --> 01:08:50,339
Oh, I can be gentle sometimes...

1396
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:53,342
...till it's time to be not so gentle.

1397
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:55,344
Excuse me.

1398
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:59,348
I'm looking for 3356 Commonwealth.
Do you know where I might find this?

1399
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:02,351
Yeah, it's right there.
I just came out of there.

1400
01:09:02,518 --> 01:09:03,352
Thank you. Wait.

1401
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:07,314
Do you by chance know my friend
Wayne, for whom I am looking?

1402
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:08,315
I am Kwame Damfu.

1403
01:09:08,482 --> 01:09:11,318
Yeah, I know your friend, partner.
He's a friend of mine too.

1404
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:15,322
- I'm Sal.
- Sal. I'm so very blessed to meet you.

1405
01:09:15,489 --> 01:09:18,325
Wayne has told me
many wonderful things about you.

1406
01:09:18,492 --> 01:09:21,328
That's because he's a good person.
You should remember that.

1407
01:09:21,495 --> 01:09:24,331
- Oh, I will, always.
- That's good.

1408
01:09:24,498 --> 01:09:29,795
Because I'd hate to have to
remind you, you understand?

1409
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:33,340
Yes. I understand.

1410
01:09:33,507 --> 01:09:35,342
That's good, because right now
he may be your boy...

1411
01:09:35,509 --> 01:09:38,345
...but he's always been my boy.

1412
01:09:38,512 --> 01:09:41,348
Nice to meet you, Kwame.

1413
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:44,351
Have a good night.

1414
01:09:44,518 --> 01:09:46,311
Say I'm wrong. Say I'm wrong...

1415
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:50,315
...and I will finish my drink,
gather up my girls, and I will leave.

1416
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:52,317
But if I'm right...
Oh, baby, if I'm right.

1417
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:54,319
Then do yourself a favor, Kenny.

1418
01:09:54,486 --> 01:09:57,322
Cut yourself a break. Live a little.

1419
01:09:57,489 --> 01:09:58,323
Come with me now...

1420
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:01,326
...because life is too short,
and you only live once.

1421
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:03,328
But if you live it right,
once can be enough.

1422
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:04,329
- You really think so?
- Yes.

1423
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:07,332
- And you honestly mean that?
- Yes.

1424
01:10:07,499 --> 01:10:09,334
- Then you know what, Katherine?
- What?

1425
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:15,340
That is the most cheesiest-ass bullshit
I have ever heard in my entire life.

1426
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:18,343
But I bet the speech works
on a lot of married men, doesn't it?

1427
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,346
Backed-up fools who are tired
of fucking their wives...

1428
01:10:21,513 --> 01:10:23,348
...and hate their marriage.

1429
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:27,352
When they hear you repeat that shit,
they can't wait to get freaky with you...

1430
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:30,314
...playing "Glory Days" on the radio,
thinking they still got it.

1431
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,317
- I don't think you...
- No, no, I know. You don't think.

1432
01:10:33,483 --> 01:10:34,318
Sweetie, you probably should...

1433
01:10:34,484 --> 01:10:37,321
...because you're out
breaking a lot of people's hearts...

1434
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:40,324
...and hurting a lot of people
you don't even realize you're hurting.

1435
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:42,326
And that ain't fucking cool.

1436
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:44,328
So now go gather up your girls
and go.

1437
01:10:44,494 --> 01:10:47,331
And the next time,
try having some respect...

1438
01:10:47,497 --> 01:10:48,332
...for people's relationships.

1439
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:50,334
Nowadays, not a lot of people do.

1440
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:52,336
Kenneth Albert Anderson.

1441
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:55,339
Why are you here drinking
at 3:00 in the goddamn morning?

1442
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:57,341
- Kenny, your wife's here.
- Thank you.

1443
01:10:57,508 --> 01:10:58,429
Sorry-ass motherfucker.

1444
01:10:58,509 --> 01:11:00,344
Are you kidding me with this?
Again?

1445
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:03,347
- Come on, girls, let's go.
- Don't leave without me.

1446
01:11:03,514 --> 01:11:05,349
Wait, where's everybody go...?

1447
01:11:05,516 --> 01:11:08,352
Turn down my good shit.
I ain't never coming here again.

1448
01:11:08,519 --> 01:11:11,313
If you make me get out of bed
and come looking for you...

1449
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,314
...one more time,
just one more time...

1450
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:14,316
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?

1451
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:19,196
Then you'd better
have one of those for me.

1452
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:20,322
- Kwame.
- Wayne.

1453
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:22,449
- I'm so glad you're here.
- See what I did there?

1454
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:25,327
- That whole irate-wife thing?
- Very convincing.

1455
01:11:25,494 --> 01:11:28,334
- Let me introduce you to my friends.
- Oh, my God, Tom. Sara's outside.

1456
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:31,333
On second thought, maybe not.
Come on, let's evaporate.

1457
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,336
- What's she doing?
- She's looking for parking.

1458
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:37,339
- Shit, she can't find parking.
- Good, Sara's coming up?

1459
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:38,340
- Yeah, but we're leaving.
- George!

1460
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:41,343
Yes, can't you see?
You have a terrible green hue.

1461
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:45,347
- Are you flushed? Seeing spots?
- No, but will you take my temperature?

1462
01:11:45,514 --> 01:11:48,350
- George! She can't find parking.
- Be strong, Tommy.

1463
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:51,397
And remember, you have to tell her.
Please tell me you're gonna tell her.

1464
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:55,315
- Tell her. Don't forget.
- George!

1465
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:58,318
Would you wanna go out sometime,
get an ice-cream cone or something?

1466
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,320
- Ice-cream cone?
- Yeah.

1467
01:12:00,487 --> 01:12:01,321
Or the observatory
or Color Me Mine.

1468
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:04,324
Of course I would.
I think that would be fun.

1469
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:06,326
- Wow, great.
- George, the booze.

1470
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:08,328
The booze, George.
She's gonna think I'm celebrating.

1471
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:10,330
- I got it. No, I got it.
- Need help?

1472
01:12:10,497 --> 01:12:12,377
I put my number under "yellow"
in the... thing.

1473
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:16,336
If you wanna call me or if late at night,
there's ever a scary noise...

1474
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:19,339
...and you don't have anyone to call,
then you can call me.

1475
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:21,341
- Thanks, George.
- Yeah.

1476
01:12:21,508 --> 01:12:23,343
- George, come on.
- I'd better get going.

1477
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:25,345
Okay, well, goodbye. Bye.

1478
01:12:25,512 --> 01:12:27,347
- Bye.
- Oh, shit.

1479
01:12:27,514 --> 01:12:30,350
And thanks for having us, Tom.
I really had a good time.

1480
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:33,312
No problem, Amy.
No problem, thanks for coming.

1481
01:12:33,478 --> 01:12:37,316
You figured out
what you're gonna do yet?

1482
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:40,319
Wanna know the truth? Not a clue.

1483
01:12:40,485 --> 01:12:43,322
Then I think that you should probably
close this door...

1484
01:12:43,488 --> 01:12:47,326
...and not really open it until you've
thought of what you're gonna say.

1485
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:50,329
Look, you don't understand.
She's outside trying to find parking.

1486
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:52,331
When she does,
she's gonna come in and just...

1487
01:12:52,497 --> 01:12:55,334
- How about "I love you"?
- Excuse me?

1488
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:56,335
What about telling her you love her?

1489
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:59,338
Well, that's great and everything.
Lt is, Amy, it is.

1490
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:03,342
But, you know, it's...
It's not that simple.

1491
01:13:03,509 --> 01:13:05,344
I mean...

1492
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:08,351
It isn't like we haven't said that
to each other a million times before.

1493
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:11,350
You know, I just... I...

1494
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:14,311
I just don't think that means anything
to anybody now.

1495
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:17,314
- What are you talking about?
- I mean, it's true, isn't it?

1496
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:20,317
Either people say it too much
or they say it and don't mean it.

1497
01:13:20,484 --> 01:13:22,319
I mean, it's just words to me now.

1498
01:13:22,486 --> 01:13:23,320
Well, maybe that's because...

1499
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:26,323
...you don't really know
what those words mean yourself.

1500
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,325
Yeah.

1501
01:13:28,492 --> 01:13:32,329
Do you know what love really is,
Tom?

1502
01:13:32,496 --> 01:13:35,332
Love is a one-way street
going from you out.

1503
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:38,335
And you give it
because it makes you feel good.

1504
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:40,337
When you give it,
it makes you strong.

1505
01:13:40,504 --> 01:13:43,340
And that crazy, vulnerable,
out-of-control, scary feeling...

1506
01:13:43,507 --> 01:13:46,343
...the feeling
that most people think is love?

1507
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:50,347
It's not really love at all.
It's just the need to be loved.

1508
01:13:50,514 --> 01:13:52,349
And believe me,
it's a very different thing.

1509
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:55,352
Love isn't, "I love you,"
hoping the person's gonna say:

1510
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:58,313
"I love you too." It's
just, "I love you."

1511
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,321
It's like giving someone a gift
at Christmas...

1512
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:03,318
...and if you get anything back,
that's a bonus, that's extra.

1513
01:14:03,485 --> 01:14:05,320
But you shouldn't need
to receive it...

1514
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:08,323
...because the true strength
is in the giving of it.

1515
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:10,325
But then again,
that's just what I think.

1516
01:14:10,492 --> 01:14:14,997
But what do I know?
I don't know anything.

1517
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:24,047
- Hi.
- Hi.

1518
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:31,346
Looks like you had
a few people over tonight.

1519
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:36,101
Yeah, well, it's Valentine's Day,
remember?

1520
01:14:38,478 --> 01:14:40,314
You know, as hard as I tried...

1521
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:45,319
...I couldn't seem to figure out a way
to get those two bags into my car.

1522
01:14:45,485 --> 01:14:49,281
You want a drink or something?

1523
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:53,327
Look, okay, Sara,
look at me for a second, all right?

1524
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:56,330
For a second.
I know you got a lot on your mind.

1525
01:14:56,496 --> 01:15:01,210
I know you got a lot of things
to figure out.

1526
01:15:01,502 --> 01:15:03,337
And up until very recently,
I thought...

1527
01:15:03,504 --> 01:15:06,340
I thought I needed you here
with me in my life...

1528
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:08,342
...for me to feel the way I feel
about you.

1529
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:13,347
But just all of a sudden, I just...
I suddenly realized I don't.

1530
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:16,350
I mean, I want us to be together
and everything.

1531
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:20,312
But I just realized
I don't need you here with me...

1532
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:23,315
...in order for me to love you,
because I'm always gonna love you.

1533
01:15:23,482 --> 01:15:26,318
And if you were to leave now
and go to China for six months...

1534
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:28,320
...I'm still gonna love you.

1535
01:15:28,487 --> 01:15:30,322
And if you gain 50 pounds,
I'm still gonna love you.

1536
01:15:30,489 --> 01:15:31,323
And you know what?

1537
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:36,328
After this moment, if I never
see you again, I'm still gonna love you.

1538
01:15:36,495 --> 01:15:39,331
And if you don't feel that way
about me...

1539
01:15:39,498 --> 01:15:41,333
...I know it's gotta be tough on you...

1540
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,336
...because it's been hell on me
as it is...

1541
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:47,339
...and I know that you're
the greatest thing that ever was.

1542
01:15:47,506 --> 01:15:52,344
And I'm just lucky to have spent
the last three years of my life with you.

1543
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:55,889
But I do love you, Tom.

1544
01:15:58,517 --> 01:16:00,936
I know.

1545
01:16:01,478 --> 01:16:05,649
Maybe I should stay
and we can talk.

1546
01:16:06,483 --> 01:16:08,318
No, no, no, I think you should go.

1547
01:16:08,485 --> 01:16:09,445
I think you should go...

1548
01:16:09,486 --> 01:16:13,323
...and figure out whatever it is
you gotta figure out.

1549
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:15,325
And if you wanna come back,
come back.

1550
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:18,328
And if you don't, that's cool too.

1551
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:20,330
But whatever happens,
you gotta know:

1552
01:16:20,497 --> 01:16:22,332
You're the love of my life...

1553
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:26,879
...and I'm just lucky
to have known you.

1554
01:16:32,509 --> 01:16:35,512
Good night, Sara.

1555
01:17:09,505 --> 01:17:12,049
Hey, Tom.

1556
01:17:12,508 --> 01:17:14,343
Kitchen's clean.

1557
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,345
Good. Snap on the stereo.

1558
01:17:16,512 --> 01:17:20,891
We're gonna make
two more dirty glasses.

1559
01:23:21,502 --> 01:23:25,339
What exactly is the story
with that guy?

1560
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:27,341
Strange you should ask.

1561
01:23:27,508 --> 01:23:29,343
- Got a cock the size of Florida.
- That's what I hear.

1562
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:32,346
But his tongue,
what does he do with his tongue?

1563
01:23:32,513 --> 01:23:34,348
I hear he can part his hair
with his tongue.

1564
01:23:34,515 --> 01:23:36,350
Really? Must be the yoga.

1565
01:23:36,517 --> 01:23:38,352
- Downward-facing doggy style.
- Yeah.

1566
01:23:38,519 --> 01:23:43,315
He told me he could lick his asshole.
He did. He did, I swear to God.

1567
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:47,569
- Cut.
- Didn't you say that earlier?

1568
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:50,322
I got no... I got no problem holding...

1569
01:23:50,489 --> 01:23:53,325
You spend so much time
going to places you never go...

1570
01:23:53,492 --> 01:23:55,327
...trying not to run into people
you do know.

1571
01:23:55,494 --> 01:24:00,082
It's just... It's not practical.
Besides...

1572
01:24:00,499 --> 01:24:03,335
This chocolate looks good.

1573
01:24:03,502 --> 01:24:07,339
We're ready to rock. Let's do it.
Everybody ready?

1574
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:09,341
- You're goddamn right.
- Let's roll.

1575
01:24:09,508 --> 01:24:12,177
And action.

1576
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:16,974
Come on.

1577
01:24:17,516 --> 01:24:19,351
Because you only live once...

1578
01:24:19,518 --> 01:24:23,605
...and, you know, life is so short.

1579
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:28,318
But if you do it right
and you live it right...

1580
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:31,822
...once can be enough.

1581
01:24:34,491 --> 01:24:36,785
What?

1582
01:24:37,494 --> 01:24:42,332
I didn't expect that the scene
was gonna go that way.

1583
01:24:42,499 --> 01:24:45,460
Can be enough.

1584
01:24:46,503 --> 01:24:48,338
You can't lean in that close
to give me...

1585
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:50,385
- Why? You told me to.
- No, but not that close.

1586
01:24:50,507 --> 01:24:53,343
- Okay.
- Because then I'm pulling away.

1587
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:54,344
- All right.
- I gotta lean into you.

1588
01:24:54,511 --> 01:24:56,346
You said get up in your face.

1589
01:24:56,513 --> 01:24:58,348
- You know.
- All right, let's do it.

1590
01:24:58,515 --> 01:25:02,352
The best ensemble in a bathroom.

1591
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:05,314
The best potty performance
you'll ever see.

1592
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:09,318
Only being honest.
Are you getting this over there? Fuck.

1593
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:10,319
All right, listen up, people.

1594
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:12,321
I have one thing to say
about this last take.

1595
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:16,533
I loved it, but I'll never use it.

1596
01:25:21,496 --> 01:25:24,333
Oh, my God, Sal's gay.

1597
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:27,336
God. You see what happens
when you try to be nice?

1598
01:25:27,503 --> 01:25:29,503
Your friends think you're a fag.
So much for karma.

1599
01:25:29,505 --> 01:25:31,340
You gotta get down there
and kind of:

1600
01:25:31,507 --> 01:25:35,344
Kind of: Kind of:
Gotta get in there and just:

1601
01:25:35,511 --> 01:25:39,348
I cannot tell you the positive att...
I cannot tell you what a positive att...

1602
01:25:39,515 --> 01:25:41,350
I mean, really,
you gotta get in there and:

1603
01:25:41,517 --> 01:25:43,352
Ln there and: Kind of:

1604
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:45,312
Just kind of:

1605
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:48,315
I cannot tell you what a
positive attitude will do for a blowjob.

1606
01:25:48,482 --> 01:25:50,317
- Got it.
- Next, you gotta take it all.

1607
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:52,319
- All?
- You want perfection, don't you?

1608
01:25:52,486 --> 01:25:55,322
Yeah, but what if he's, like, Shaq?
I'm a small girl.

1609
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:57,449
Well, then, honey,
you have to learn to unhinge...

1610
01:25:57,491 --> 01:25:59,326
...like a fucking python.

1611
01:25:59,493 --> 01:26:02,329
You'll never be queen
unless you learn to swallow the king.

1612
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:05,332
Goddamn it, you've gotta learn to
unhinge like a motherfucking python.

1613
01:26:05,499 --> 01:26:08,335
You'll never be queen
unless you learn to swallow the king.

1614
01:26:08,502 --> 01:26:11,338
You've gotta unhinge like a python.
Let me tell you something.

1615
01:26:11,505 --> 01:26:15,342
Well, then, honey, you have got
to learn to unhinge like a fucking py...

1616
01:26:15,509 --> 01:26:18,345
Then you have to learn
to unhinge like a fucking python.

1617
01:26:18,512 --> 01:26:21,348
You'll never be queen
unless you learn to swallow the king.

1618
01:26:21,515 --> 01:26:23,350
Oh, my God.

1619
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:26,311
- Becky, look at his butt.
- Lt is so big.

1620
01:26:26,478 --> 01:26:28,313
Your bullshit.

1621
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,315
You know what? That's bullshit.

1622
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:33,318
- That's a lot of bullshit.
- Okay, good.

1623
01:26:33,485 --> 01:26:37,322
They don't understand that they
created the Frankensteins they abhor.

1624
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:40,325
- Frankenstein was a whore?
- Leave my wife out of this.

1625
01:26:40,492 --> 01:26:41,326
Imagine that conversation.

1626
01:26:41,493 --> 01:26:43,328
"We have some bad news
and some good news.

1627
01:26:43,495 --> 01:26:45,330
The bad news is,
we've found some growth...

1628
01:26:45,497 --> 01:26:47,332
...in the cortex of your brain.

1629
01:26:47,499 --> 01:26:50,335
The good news is...

1630
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:53,338
...you can start sucking dick
immediately."

1631
01:26:53,505 --> 01:26:56,341
Fantastic, I love that take,
but I'll never use it.

1632
01:26:56,508 --> 01:26:57,342
All right, Sal.

1633
01:26:57,509 --> 01:27:00,345
Yeah, me too. I used to love it.
Tom always... Sorry.

1634
01:27:00,512 --> 01:27:01,346
Tape this shit up.

1635
01:27:01,513 --> 01:27:05,976
Oh, my God.
What do you think that means?

1636
01:27:06,518 --> 01:27:09,313
Well, when I see dogs having sex,
I think it means...

1637
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:12,316
Good, one last time
just on that first part.

1638
01:27:12,482 --> 01:27:15,986
No, no, I don't think so.

1639
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:22,326
If the rest of the world could just
keep their opinions... to themselves.

1640
01:27:22,492 --> 01:27:25,329
If that's what being married's about,
you can keep that shit.

1641
01:27:25,495 --> 01:27:27,331
Ain't no way this motherfucker's
ever getting married.

1642
01:27:27,497 --> 01:27:29,333
- You heard?
- Whatever.

1643
01:27:29,499 --> 01:27:32,336
If that's what being married's about,
keep that shit.

1644
01:27:32,503 --> 01:27:34,338
Ain't no way this motherfucker's
ever getting married.

1645
01:27:34,505 --> 01:27:36,340
- You heard?
- Whatever.

1646
01:27:36,507 --> 01:27:38,342
If that's what being married's about,
keep that shit.

1647
01:27:38,509 --> 01:27:40,344
No way this motherfucker's
getting married.

1648
01:27:40,511 --> 01:27:43,347
Okay. Okay, good.

1649
01:27:43,514 --> 01:27:48,018
We've got all that?
It's all covered? Cut.
