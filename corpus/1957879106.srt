14
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,983
(SINGING) I want to be happy.

15
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:43,890
But I won't be happy till
I make you happy too.

16
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:49,095
Life's really worth living
when we are mirth-giving.

17
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:53,499
Why can't I give some to you?

18
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,237
When skies are gray and
you say you are blue,

19
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:02,976
I'll send the sun
smiling through.

20
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,345
I want to be happy.

21
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:10,450
But I won't be happy till
I make you happy too.

22
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,621
You owe it to yourself.

23
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,367
Bullshit, bullshit.

24
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,369
Oh, my part.

25
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,805
Bullshit, bullshit.

26
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,274
Bullshit.

27
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,142
It's all bullshit, Monica.

28
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,477
This is Hollywood.

29
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,548
Bullshit, bullshit.

30
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,420
JACK: The usual?

31
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,989
Bullshit, bullshit.

32
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,359
Oh, usual's fine.

00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,096

Oh, my part.

36
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,835
Bullshit.

37
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,336
Here.

38
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,904
You owe it to yourself.

[horn beeping]

40
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,807
Mm.

Pure heaven.

42
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,716
Jack, you are a god.

43
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:24,917
JACK: What are you reading?

44
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,320
William Shakespeare's
"Twelfth Night."

45
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,521
Shakespeare, William--

46
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,290
1564 to 1616.

47
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,460
The guy could write his ass off.

48
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,896
Well, I'm up for
Viola in the Valley.

49
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:37,964
Is that a good part?

50
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,432
Well, if you took
the trouble to read

51
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,000
the rest of the
characters' roles,

52
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,536
you'd realize that Shakespeare
didn't write any bad parts.

53
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,272
I can barely understand
my own part, Jack.

54
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,607
Give me a break.

55
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,075
I bet you Bette Davis
knows her Shakespeare.

56
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,009
[ringing]

57
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,311
She doesn't have to.

58
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,347
She's already got an Oscar.

59
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,215
Ernie's Pagoda Lounge.

60
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,917
Sorry, we're closed today--

61
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,519
private party.

62
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,954
I don't care who you are.

63
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,157
Open tomorrow.

64
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,091
Hollywood.

65
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,193
Get a load of this.

66
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,695
Real beluga caviar.

67
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,597
Martha Anne is crazy
about it, well,

68
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,232
ever since she heard
Harlow orders it

69
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:17,470
by the ton from the Caspian
Sea, wherever that is.

70
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,939
You know you can tell
if caviar is any good?

71
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,975
When the eggs are
large and unbroken.

72
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:26,012
Hey, you know
what to put that on?

73
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,048
Leave it to, doll face.

74
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,817
I trust you, Jack.

75
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,486
Around food-- food
and mixed drinks.

76
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,455
I bet you say that
to all the bartenders.

77
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:40,393
Mm, I do.

78
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,095
And you can't imagine
how helpful it's been.

79
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,631
[ringing]

80
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,066
MAN: Hey, Martha Anne.

81
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,502
We need you on set.

82
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,437
JACK: Hey Shirl.

83
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,406
Shirl?

84
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,974
Shirley?

85
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,976
SHIRLEY: Not now, Jack.

86
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,010
Here we go again.

87
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,189
[gasping]

88
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,574
MONICA: Oh, did I
serve that lady.

89
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,977
I might not be
delivered to the world

90
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,381
till I had made my
own occasion, my love.

91
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,284
What my estate is?

92
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,986
That's cute, huh?

93
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,021
Yeah.

94
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,589
Don't fucking know
what it even means.

95
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,258
(RUSSIAN ACCENT)
Get me a whiskey,

96
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:23,029
a ginger ale on the side,
and don't be stingy.

97
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,434
How you doing, Shirley?

98
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,969
How am I doing?

99
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,175
How do I look, Jack?

100
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,310
Like usual.

101
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,678
Like a drowned rat.

102
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,386
What's today?

103
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,287
JACK: Monday.

104
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,221
Oh.

105
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,162
Been up for three days.

106
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:56,996
Pills?

107
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:01,133
Mm-hm, and booze and insomnia.

108
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,301
You got a cig?

109
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:20,519
Be a darling and do that again.

110
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:24,090
It's hot out there.

111
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,758
Insomnia.

112
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,026
I know what that is.

113
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,763
But what is it?

114
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,599
She doesn't know
what insomnia is, Jack.

115
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,800
It's nothing, honey.

116
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,103
Just a bunch of
sleepless nights.

117
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,270
So?

118
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,040
A person can't be expected
to know everything.

119
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,779
Do you know where Illyria is?

120
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:53,019
Illyria is an ancient
country on the east coast

121
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,353
of the Adriatic.

122
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:59,091
Shakespeare's "Twelfth
Night" was in Illyria.

123
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,464
I was in a production
once of "Twelfth Night."

124
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,167
You were in "Twelfth Night?"

125
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,068
What part?

126
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,805
Olivia.

127
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,274
It's a lead, isn't it?

128
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,275
Uh-huh.

129
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,144
Uh, one of the leads, yes.

130
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,846
SHIRLEY: That was back
in my college days

131
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,916
on the plains of Nebraska.

132
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,051
Oh.

133
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,888
Then it wasn't a
professional production.

134
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,557
SHIRLEY: Who does professional
productions of Shakespeare,

135
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:32,625
huh?

136
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,660
Maybe someone in England.

137
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,396
So, um, what
caused the insomnia?

138
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,537
You remember
that man, Raymond?

139
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,972
Raymond, Raymond--

140
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:50,209
That I was going out with.

141
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,444
Oh, yeah.

142
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,879
Raymond what's his name?
- French.

143
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,181
Raymond [inaudible].

144
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,417
Dapper.

145
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,186
Distinguished.

146
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,654
Rich.

147
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,022
Good looking.

148
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:07,293
23rd best-dressed
man in America.

149
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,563
Raymond threw me over
for another woman.

150
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,997
A stand-in?

151
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,668
A stunt woman, part-time,
over at Republic.

152
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,236
Ugh.

153
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,003
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,238
SHIRLEY: You're sorry.

155
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,606
Heh.

156
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,510
If you're sorry--

157
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,446
Caviar?

158
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,215
Beluga.

159
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:33,719
MONICA: Yeah, nothing's too good
for Martha Anne on her 30th.

160
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,722
She's 30 years old today, huh?

161
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:40,326
How nice for her.

162
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,694
MAN: Quiet!
[ringing]

163
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:42,628
MAN: Quiet!

164
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:43,662
MAN: Stand by for picture!

165
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:44,730
MAN: Mark it.

166
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,764
Action.

167
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,599
Let's roll a few feet.
Cut.

168
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,766
[ringing]

169
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,001
Get out of that
dress, Martha Anne.

170
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,336
I can't afford to
have it sweated up.

171
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,537
We may need it later.

172
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,038
Wardrobe, change it for
the next setup, will you?

173
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,608
We're ready, Miss Harlow.

174
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,042
How's life on the set, Shirl?

175
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,580
Our set is closed.

176
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,085
We're shooting "Conquest."

177
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:12,491
[laughing]

178
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:17,163
Everybody is trying to get
a glimpse of Charles Boyer

179
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,831
as Napoleon.

180
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,366
And Miss Garbo?

181
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,903
Contrary to popular
opinion, Miss Garbo

182
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,504
can be really quite affable.

183
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:34,413
Sometimes, after hours, off
the set, Miss Gustafsson--

184
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,148
that's her real name--

185
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:41,854
and I sit around in our
underwear, chewing the fat.

186
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:45,224
Greta cooks up a batch
of Swedish meatballs.

187
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:51,897
Jack, Miss Garbo and I have
a very healthy relationship.

188
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,300
I have a healthy
relationship with the woman

189
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:00,005
I work for, unlike some
people I could mention.

190
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:04,977
I'm going to pretend
you didn't say that.

191
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:10,082
You pretend anything you want.

192
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:15,521
Greta, Miss Garbo with
the bashful Valkyrie.

193
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,257
Mm-hm.

194
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,759
Here, Shirley.

195
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,294
You owe it to yourself.

196
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,195
Jack.

197
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,070
I have such an enormous
debt to myself,

198
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,073
it would take more than a
lifetime to pay it back.

199
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,275
Whiskey can do magic
for lonely people, Shirl.

200
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,283
Whiskey.

201
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,217
Morphine.

202
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,589
[inaudible]

203
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,558
Hi!

204
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:56,228
[cat call]

205
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,129
Hi.

206
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,906
I'm a stand-in.

207
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:07,940
I'm OK.

208
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,376
$16.50 every day.

209
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,979
Other girls are on the
street, while I'm a stand-in.

210
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,281
Life is sweet.

211
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,783
Paramount or MGM,
Warner Brothers--

212
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,618
all them pay our wages.

213
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,589
In exchange, we all look
like someone strange.

214
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,658
I'm a stand-in,
that's my game.

215
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,959
I'm not in it for the fame.

216
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,694
Don't call me no glamourpuss.

217
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,496
I'm a stand-in, marvelous.

218
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,630
War in Europe.

219
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,865
PEGGY: War in Spain.

220
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,133
Newsreels.

221
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,668
They give me a pain.

222
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,169
Dust bowl, unemployment too.

223
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,171
Honey, I got things to do.

224
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,939
PEGGY: Wardrobe
wants me in a gown.

225
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,609
Makeup thinks our
hair is too brown.

226
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,344
I'm not in some unwashed mob.

227
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,078
I'm a stand-in.

228
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,179
That's my job.

229
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,347
PEGGY: I'm a stand-in.

230
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,315
I'm true blue.

231
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,550
My profession, [inaudible].

232
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,651
I'm a stand-in.

233
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:53,719
I got class.

234
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,487
I'm a lady, bet your ass.

235
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,455
I'm a stand-in.

236
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,690
So is my pals.

237
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,825
We are not your average gals.

238
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:05,064
We're together, thick and thin,
proud to be a genuine stand-in.

239
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,735
Glad to see me, big boy?

240
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:10,669
JACK: Mm-hm.

241
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,341
That poem still kills me.

242
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,742
PEGGY: God bless you, Jack.

243
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,044
Me and Martha Anne knocked
out that little ditty

244
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,915
over a couple of dozen Gin
Rickeys and some reefer.

245
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,452
I wanted to call it,
Stand-ins Never Die.

246
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,855
Course, she calls it
Fuck this Occupation.

247
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,256
We never could agree.

248
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,492
I brought some comestibles.

249
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,994
Comestibles?

250
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,529
A lot of them.

251
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,798
MONICA: I know what combustibles
are, but what are they?

252
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:40,899
Food, babe.
Eats.

253
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:41,834
Vittles.

254
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:42,968
MONICA: Oh.

255
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,070
Miss Unaware,
that's you, honey.

256
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,639
MONICA: I'm not so unaware.

257
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,907
Aware, even.

258
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,542
Will you look at
these comestibles?

259
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,777
God!

260
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,680
It's [inaudible] Do you
think I'd show up to my best

261
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,749
friend's party empty-handed?

262
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,016
I don't think so.

263
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,752
I'd better put this
all in the kitchen.

264
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,754
OK, well I'll help.

265
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,755
OK, come on.

266
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:24,042
If you're so smart,
what's a Valkyrie?

267
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:28,580
Garbo's bashful Valkyrie.

268
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,115
So what is a Valkyrie?

269
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:38,090
SHIRLEY: In Norse mythology,
she's the maiden of Odin.

270
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:43,262
She conducts the souls of
dead heroes to Valhalla.

271
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:47,566
That's the Viking version
of heaven, to you.

272
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:52,504
A Valkyrie is the
chooser of the slain.

273
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,839
You knew that?

274
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:54,773
No.

275
00:17:58,811 --> 00:17:59,878
Norse mythology.

276
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,215
Viking heaven.

277
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,554
So Garbo's the
chooser of the slain.

278
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,260
And you have a
healthy relationship

279
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,528
with the chooser of the slain?

280
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,634
I'm in show business, if
that's what you're driving at.

281
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,209
It'll be your life or mine.

282
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,611
And if you're
killed, I'll be free.

283
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:36,048
And if I'm killed,
it won't matter.

284
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,952
And if we both
die, good riddance.

285
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:40,886
So?

286
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,495
That was Betty
Davis in "Dangerous."

287
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,497
She won an Oscar for
that performance.

288
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,505
Did she break off a piece
of the gold statuette for you?

289
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,472
A foot, maybe?

290
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,044
I didn't stand in
for all of "Dangerous."

291
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,379
During part of the
shooting, I was

292
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,914
loaned out for another picture.

293
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,086
Loaned out?

294
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,189
Loaned out?

295
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:21,360
You had a teensy weensy walk-on.

296
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,429
"And She Stayed for Breakfast."

297
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,131
Was that the name of it?

298
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,101
She was there in the morning.

299
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,602
She learned from sailors.

300
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:39,578
Best Actress, 1935.

301
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,281
She did it with her socks on.

302
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,951
When Betty won that
award, I was overjoyed.

303
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,422
Did you hear me?

304
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:56,762
Best Actress, 1935.

305
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:02,668
Oh, wasn't that the year that,
uh, Garbo made "Anna Karenina?"

306
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,503
I can't imagine
Miss Garbo's ever

307
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,939
taken home an Academy Award.

308
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,174
I don't imagine she cares.

309
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,475
But you do.

310
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:16,014
Garbo's gotten
her share of awards.

311
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:20,619
The New York Film Critics picked
her best feminine performance.

312
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,288
Sounds like a sanitary napkin.

313
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,390
That was for "Anna Karenina."

314
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,262
The New York Film Critics.

315
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,743
Think any of those saps
ever worked in the movies?

316
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,946
Think again, kiddo.

317
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:54,386
The Academy Awards are voted
by people who make movies--

318
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,888
a jury of your peers.

319
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,826
Maybe the bashful
Valkyrie has no peers.

320
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,196
Garbo will get an Oscar.

321
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,298
And I mean soon.

322
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,066
Do you hear me?

323
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,868
Maybe this year for "Camille."

324
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,304
Nobody with an ounce of
sense thinks that Garbo

325
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,139
will not get an Oscar.

326
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,807
She'll never get one--

327
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,175
not ever.

328
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,344
You're nuts!

329
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,081
Is that so?

330
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,785
SHIRLEY: You're also drunk.

331
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:30,422
Oh, so now I'm a drunk?

332
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:35,794
You fucking insomnia dope fiend.

333
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,996
Since when did the
city of Los Angeles

334
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:41,733
pick you to give drunk tests?

335
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,669
Macadamia nuts?

336
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:48,040
Came all the way
from Redondo Beach.

337
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,041
SHIRLEY: Practically imported.

338
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,242
Oh thanks, Peg.

339
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,277
I could use a nut right now.

340
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,813
Been eating caviar all day.

341
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:55,747
Get her.

342
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:01,286
Whatcha reading, doll?

343
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:04,856
"Make me a willow
cabin at your gate,

344
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,793
and call upon my soul
within the house.

345
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,764
[inaudible] loyal
cantons of condemned

346
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:17,969
love, and sing them loud
even in the dead of night.

347
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,075
[inaudible] your name to
the reverberate hills,

348
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:29,448
and make the babbling gossip
of the air cry out, Olivia!"

349
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,850
Olivia de Havilland?

350
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,652
Who else?

351
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,154
Well, the Parsons must be
the babbling gossip of the air

352
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,857
they're talking about, huh?

353
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:39,791
Of course.

354
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:43,995
See?

355
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:48,266
Shakespeare's not hard when
you have the right references.

356
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,202
Shakespeare, huh?

357
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,637
Knock me over with
a feather duster.

358
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,707
Yeah, it might be kind
of hard, Peg, or haven't

359
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:56,641
you noticed?

360
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,314
Huh?

361
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,348
Your girth, honey.

362
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,784
I'm talking about your weight.

363
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,019
I'm trying to keep
up with Miss Mae West.

364
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,954
Yeah.

365
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,323
That's what I mean.

366
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:15,594
It's that Mr. Fields,
that W. C. Fields.

367
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,963
There's talk of co-starring
them in a picture together.

368
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,767
It's made her anxious,
so she puts on weight.

369
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,068
He drinks.

370
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,337
He just got out of a sanitarium.

371
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,807
He came on the set, he
kissed her on the nose,

372
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,675
and he pinched
her on the behind,

373
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,546
and he called her
his little bird mare.

374
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,648
She thinks he's fucking nuts.

375
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,017
It's made her gain.

376
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,053
And you're gaining
right along with her.

377
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,456
That's what I call loyalty.

378
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,558
That's what I
call keeping my job.

379
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,007
MAN: Johnny, get that tent in.

380
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:36,975
JOHNNY: Yes sir, boss.

381
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,010
Incoming, right in.

382
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,913
[ringing]

383
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:45,050
[inaudible]

384
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,384
MAN: Coming through.

385
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,186
Martha Anne, the dress!

386
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,120
Fuck you!

387
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,188
It's my birthday!

388
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,431
[humming]

389
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:03,201
[giggling]

390
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,341
Didn't anyone ever tell you
you should be in Vaudeville?

391
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,375
Yeah, sure.

392
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,177
I was in pictures at the time.

393
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,846
SHIRLEY: But you were
in Vaudeville, weren't

394
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,715
you, little Jackie Turner?

395
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,516
The lively songs
and terpsichore

396
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,185
of little Jackie Turner.

397
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,053
What's terpsichore?

398
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,889
Dancing, kiddo.

399
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:24,956
Dancing.

400
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,192
Later to be replaced
by the lovely sounds

401
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,361
of sand dance Jack Turner.

402
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,896
Yes.

403
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,498
I was in Vaudeville for
a while there, sure.

404
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,300
You managed
three to about 100.

405
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,334
To about 100.

406
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:37,869
Did you ever play the palace?

407
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,772
Yeah, I played
the palace, Peggy.

408
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,073
SHIRLEY: In Boise, Idaho.

409
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,912
Anything on the radio?

410
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,282
Been thinking about
dance music all day.

411
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,319
Anything to forget about
little Jackie Turner.

412
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:01,159
[music playing]

413
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,032
Me?

414
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:07,966
You.

415
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,105
(ON RADIO) You,

416
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,173
Come on, Shirl.

417
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:19,110
(ON RADIO) You never
cared for me after I

418
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,081
gave my devotion to you.

419
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:33,391
You, you gave the air
to me, spurning a love

420
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:38,163
that was honest and true.

421
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:45,670
When I met you, I let
you fall into my heart,

422
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,241
just to hurt me, desert
me, and tear me apart.

423
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,509
[ringing]

424
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,511
If that's Raymond,
I haven't been here.

425
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:58,583
He's always trying to call
me up and beg my forgiveness.

426
00:26:58,683 --> 00:26:59,484
Ernie's Pagoda.

427
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:00,452
Martha Anne!

428
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,721
It's Martha Anne.

429
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,523
Hey, where are you?

430
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:10,829
Oh, we're here, just
dancing, me and--

431
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,466
yeah, just the two of us.

432
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:18,403
Oh, uh, you coming by?

433
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,005
Oh, a drink or two.

434
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:25,143
I'm thinking about making it
an early one, blue Monday.

435
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,812
Swell, we'll see you
in a jiff, kiddo.

436
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,281
Did I give it away?

437
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,550
Think she had any suspicions?

438
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,020
Did she sound a Hollywood 30.

439
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,754
19.

440
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,956
Don't you just hate her.

441
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,325
No, I don't just hate her.

442
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,328
You do just hate her.

443
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:46,398
I believe you do just hate her.

444
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,135
SHIRLEY: Oh, you're sounding
like a Betty Davis movie again.

445
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:57,809
Martha Anne's birthday,
and she sounded so cheerful.

446
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:58,943
We'll fix that.

447
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,450
You should have
asked her how's

448
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:14,192
Erwin Reisner, the imminent
Erwin Reisner, the producer,

449
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,796
another lounge lizard.

450
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,998
Erwin Reisner and
Raymond Dubliet are

451
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:23,168
cut from the same snake skin.

452
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,271
Oh, shit.

453
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,238
Hey!

454
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,074
Do you know anything
about morphine?

455
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:33,111
Only that I'd like to try it.

456
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,179
Oh, god!

457
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,014
She's whiter than
Robert Taylor's teeth!

458
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,949
Oh, she's on her knees again.

459
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,484
She's been there before.

460
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,786
Ask Raymond Dubliet.

461
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,388
Fuck Raymond Dubliet!

462
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,289
She's back.

463
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,964
So we're in Paris.

464
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,233
It's my first time abroad.

465
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:03,608
And we check into this very
ritzy hotel, which happens

466
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:07,145
to be called the Ritz Hotel.

467
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:20,191
And I fall in love
with the bidet.

468
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:27,966
So I'm on the bidet, a
genuine French bidet,

469
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:33,438
with those warm jets of water
spraying their everloving way

470
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,307
upward to my heart--

471
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,675
Beautiful.

472
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,577
I'll say.

473
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:47,652
Raymond comes back, and I
say, "Raymond, if you really

474
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,921
worship me, you will
buy me something

475
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,223
that I can't get at home.

476
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:56,127
You will buy me a
genuine French bidet."

477
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:03,835
And he looks at me,
and he says, "Do

478
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,303
you know what a bidet costs?"

479
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:14,579
And I say, "Raymond,
if you really love me,

480
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,347
cost would be no object."

481
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,725
And he looks at me again,
and he says, "I got

482
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,894
a suggestion for you, Shirl.

483
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,967
Do handstands in the shower."

484
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,136
PEGGY: Lord Almighty,
you could hurt yourself!

485
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,741
He only took her
there for an abortion.

486
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:46,611
PEGGY: Sweet Jesus.

487
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,613
I'd never have one.

488
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,914
Oh yeah?

489
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,384
What about that
little trip to Mexico?

490
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,220
PEGGY: Jack, I think
it's time for a Martini.

491
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,562
Monica?

492
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,999
You ever tell anyone that I went
to Paris just for an abortion

493
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,935
again I will rip
every cheaply dyed

494
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,639
hair out of your empty head.

495
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:15,540
Twat!

496
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,344
Now I'm a twat.

497
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,112
SHIRLEY: Yeah,
now you're a twat!

498
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,481
Look, Shirley, if
this is about Raymond--

499
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,149
What about Raymond?

500
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,721
In case you're
wondering, I never

501
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,824
laid a hand on Raymond Dubliet.

502
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:33,891
Is that so?

503
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:34,993
Yeah.

504
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:38,930
What about Erwin Reisner?

505
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,902
You said he wasn't good
enough to write in your shoot.

506
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,437
Yeah?

507
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,474
So I lay plenty of guys I
wouldn't let write in my shoot.

508
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,743
Now that's an interesting
character trait.

509
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,344
SHIRLEY: Shut up, Jack.

510
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,780
What about Erwin?

511
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:08,660
For the record, I haven't
laid a hand on Erwin Reisner,

512
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,862
for years.

513
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,498
Other body parts?

514
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,933
I got stopped this
morning for my autograph

515
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,068
at Vine and Melrose.

516
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,840
This very cute traffic
cop said he'd see me

517
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,710
in "I'm No Angel" four times.

518
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,680
You signed
autographs as Mae West?

519
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,947
Four times!

520
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,250
And he saw me twice
in "Klondike Annie."

521
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,584
But I thought enough is enough.

522
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,254
We had cars backed up
half the way to Sunset.

523
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:40,391
Don't you think that's
a little dishonest?

524
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,360
Dishonest?

525
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,761
Lord, no.

526
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,130
The way I see it, Mae can't be
everywhere, but thanks to me,

527
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,933
she can be in two
places at once.

528
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:49,934
And the cop?

529
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,302
Did he give you the ticket?

530
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,904
PEGGY: Sweet blood Jesus, no!

531
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,006
He just wanted to gab.

532
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,008
He said, (LOW
VOICE) I'm surprised

533
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,545
you're not in some
big limousine.

534
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:05,717
I never expected to see Mae West
in overalls driving a Ford V8.

535
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:10,154
So I said, "Fritz."

536
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,456
His name was Fritz.

537
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:21,599
Fritz, I donated my limousine
to the Beverly Hills Orphanage

538
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,201
for the day.

539
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,437
And as for these
overalls, they were

540
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:30,808
a personal gift from the
late Rudolph Valentino.

541
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,977
And he swallowed that?

542
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:37,115
He said, (LOW VOICE)
you knew Valentino?

543
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:42,086
I said, intimately.

544
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,323
It was the only way to know him.

545
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:50,795
So he said, (LOW
VOICE) well, wait

546
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,964
till I tell the little woman.

547
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:58,202
So I said, you know,
you win, Fritz.

548
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,071
I gotta go make a movie.

549
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,945
And with that, I
drove away, and left

550
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,914
him standing there
at the intersection,

551
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:13,284
admiring his four
Mae West autographs.

552
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,186
I don't think that
young police officer

553
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:19,624
will soon forget meeting someone
he believes to be a star.

554
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,326
You, uh, you should
have signed autographs

555
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,862
as Rudolph Valentino.

556
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,330
That would have made his day.

557
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,266
Peggy can't even
spell Valentino.

558
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,069
PEGGY: I can't
even spell Rudolph.

559
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:34,338
Peg, you have no
sense of yourself,

560
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,508
no sense of who you really are.

561
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,242
JACK: Monica.

562
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,579
No, let me finish.

563
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,880
Sorry.

564
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,552
You completely bury yourself
into an entirely different

565
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:53,024
woman's identity, a woman
who's carving out her own image

566
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:57,195
and has forged her
own successful career.

567
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,564
And she can sign
her own autographs.

568
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,536
You ain't Mae West, Peggy.

569
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,405
You never will be.

570
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,241
That traffic cop
thought I was Mae.

571
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,310
I don't see that there
was any harm done.

572
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,778
Not to him, anyway.

573
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,754
Oh.

574
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,991
I know who's stand-in you are.

575
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,460
Takes one to know one, huh?

576
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,597
We're like dogs
of the same breed.

577
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,433
We've got to sniff
each other out.

578
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,736
Hey, how'd you like
to come to a party?

579
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,072
You think I'd fit in?

580
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,108
Right down to the slacks.

581
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,245
Yeah, you're gonna
fit in just fine.

582
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,747
What's today?

583
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,082
Is it Monday?

584
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:54,385
JACK: Only for 24 hours.

585
00:35:54,485 --> 00:36:01,158
I have a birthday
party to go to Monday.

586
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,394
You're at the party.

587
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,595
This is the party, Shirl.

588
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:12,303
Good.

589
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,905
I thought I'd miss it.

590
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:33,224
(SINGING) Tramp, tramp,
tramp, ze boys are marching.

591
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,059
Cheer up, comrades.

592
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,061
They come.

593
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,129
JACK: Hey, Rhonda.

594
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,264
Did you hitch or bus it?
- No.

595
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,501
My new friend drove me
over in her Duesenberg.

596
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,268
It's OK.

597
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,405
I know you didn't mean it.

598
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,041
PEGGY: So much nicer
when you're friends.

599
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,009
RHONDA: Christ, I
could use a drink.

600
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,512
JACK: One Martini coming up.

601
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,281
Jack, you know
what a girl wants.

602
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,887
So where is your
friend in the new Duesy?

603
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:03,788
Parking.

604
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,729
[music playing]

605
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:23,107
(SINGING) Oh they [inaudible]
that I couldn't do

606
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:28,679
with plenty of money and you.

607
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:35,353
[inaudible] worry, that money
dream, just a [inaudible]

608
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,488
buy a lot of things.

609
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,029
Hi.

610
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,699
I'm Taffy, Taffy Entwistle.

611
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,240
Hi, Taffy.

612
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,278
This is Monica and
Shirley and Miss Peggy.

613
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,178
Welcome.

614
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:02,413
Oh, thanks.

615
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,582
And the inimitable Jack.

616
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:14,659
I had a sister named Peg once.

617
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:20,031
One Hayworth Martini
coming right up.

618
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,666
Her real name was Lillian.

619
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,235
But everybody called her Peg.

620
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,903
Well, mine's Pegine.

621
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,338
What happened to her?

622
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,083
She died.

623
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:42,253
Oh, I'm sorry.

624
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,356
She's in a better place.

625
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,626
JACK: You do look like Hayworth.

626
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:49,460
Do I?

627
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,961
Thanks, Jack.

628
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,363
Here.

629
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,332
Anyone that looks as much
like Hayworth as you do

630
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,934
owes it to herself.

631
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,537
I always wanted to
look like somebody.

632
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,138
Are you from back
East like Miss Hayworth?

633
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,473
Me?

634
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,276
I'm from back nowhere,
a little town in Wyoming

635
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,111
called Beach City.

636
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:10,481
I never could figure out why
they called it that, though.

637
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,615
JACK: No beach?

638
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,550
None.

639
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,655
Maybe they named it after
somebody, a Mr. Beach.

640
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,024
The local newspaper
was called the Sand Flea.

641
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,659
You figure it out.
I can't.

642
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,561
The important thing
is you grew up there.

643
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,430
TAFFY: The important thing is I
grew up to be exactly five feet

644
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,600
7 and 1/2 inches,
the precise height

645
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,737
of one Miss Rita Hayworth.

646
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,438
A million girls
come to Hollywood,

647
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,108
but I was just
right, the right bone

648
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,576
structure, the right coloring.

649
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,246
I saw every one
of her pictures.

650
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:46,550
I was scared silly the day
that I got on the Greyhound.

651
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,187
Hollywood was like a
place out of a storybook.

652
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,989
Yeah?

653
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:55,459
What storybook have
you been reading?

654
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,694
A place with a beach, anyhow.

655
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,032
You wouldn't be having fun
with me, now, would you, Jack?

656
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,601
Doll face?

657
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:04,869
You couldn't pass the physical.

658
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,974
I don't mind being
the butt of a good joke.

659
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,509
I just don't want to
be a laughingstock.

660
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:15,179
Oh, you're in the
wrong profession, girlie.

661
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,081
TAFFY: I don't feel
that way at all.

662
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:21,185
I've been here a whole month,
and everyone's been so nice.

663
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,922
May 6, the day that Zeppelin,
the Hindenburg exploded--

664
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,124
If only we could get
the bags of hot air

665
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,293
here in Hollywood to explode.

666
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:32,062
I know she's Greta
Garbo, but honestly,

667
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,265
does she had to be so negative?

668
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,634
Don't worry about
Shirley, honey.

669
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:40,137
She's been up since Friday
painting the town bloodshot.

670
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:41,972
You know what I mean?

671
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,874
JACK: May 6 to June 6--

672
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,476
barely one cycle of
the moon, and you're

673
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,378
driving your very
own Duesenberg.

674
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,713
Barely one menstrual cycle.

675
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:54,685
MONICA: Yeah, Shirley's periods
last about 29 days a month.

676
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,755
SHIRLEY: Yes, so
don't fuck with her.

677
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:01,926
MONICA: Some flivver
you got parked outside.

678
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:02,760
That's not my car.

679
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,864
I borrowed it from props.

680
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,134
From props?

681
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,936
Entwistle' an unusual name.

682
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,170
Is it German?

683
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,338
English.

684
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:19,477
Like, maybe
Scotch-Irish or Welsh.

685
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,745
Got a little of
all of them in me.

686
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:25,082
Yeah, I've had a little
of all of them in me, too.

687
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:26,517
Me, too.

688
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,719
JACK: Monica's known for
her discerning taste in men.

689
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,391
That depends on the man.

690
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,193
TAFFY: A month's
not a long time.

691
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:39,163
And I managed to land a
job that's a real plum.

692
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,165
Could have happened to any
girl that looked like me.

693
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:49,406
Anyone who looked like Rita
Hayworth, don't you mean?

694
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:51,442
Oh wait, Jack.

695
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,043
I'd rather have a tequila.

696
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:56,146
Make it a triple with a hunk of
lime and a fist full of salt.

697
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,082
You are a regular cowgirl.

698
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,517
Cowboy, you mean.

699
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,418
- Damn mirror's cracked.
- Who gave you that?

700
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,486
Raymond?

701
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,420
I wish.

702
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,956
He didn't give me crap.

703
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,524
Oh, am I shiny?

704
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,059
Yeah.

705
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,362
You know what it is ride
around all day with your tits

706
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,631
strapped down under your
corset and your hair pinned up

707
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,332
on your hat?

708
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:18,135
Standing in is a breeze compared
to stunt work out in public.

709
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,108
Raymond Dubliet.

710
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,309
JACK: Oh god, no.

711
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,882
Pardon me.

712
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:36,186
Are you the refined
young lady who

713
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,656
lured away my gentleman friend?

714
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,226
Do you want me to say I am?

715
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:55,739
Thursday night, Raymond and
I were at the Brown Derby.

716
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,042
He got up to make a phone call.

717
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:04,315
He was calling you, wasn't he?

718
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,750
I don't recall receiving
a phone call that night.

719
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:18,195
When he came back
from that phone call,

720
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,665
he was informing me
that he was going

721
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:28,172
to throw me over for a
horse acrobat at Republic.

722
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,513
Walter Pigeon was
that the next table.

723
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:40,985
Norma Shearer was
two seats away.

724
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:45,789
And I don't mean their
fucking stand-ins.

725
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:51,128
He told me how tall you
were, all about your hair.

726
00:43:56,367 --> 00:44:01,839
He didn't tell me you
were so goddamn pretty.

727
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,141
So goddamn young.

728
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:09,880
Excuse me.

729
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,050
I'm just going to dash
off to the ladies' room.

730
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:19,723
Ugh!

731
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,425
RHONDA: Taffy!

732
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:22,359
Are you OK?

733
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,660
I'm OK.

734
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:27,631
Just don't plan to
have children with him.

735
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:28,665
You get back here, Shirley.

736
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,267
I'm gonna twist your tits off.

737
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,502
Waiting for that.

738
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,736
Oh yeah?
Ladies,

739
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,871
- Please--
- No, no, no, Jack.

740
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:34,638
I just wiped
the floor, please!

741
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:35,773
Just sit down.

742
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:36,907
And I'll tear her
vocal cords out.

743
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,275
She'll never speak
baritone again.

744
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:39,610
Come on. (SINGING)
Who's hopping in a Honda?

745
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,112
She never told
her love, but let

746
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:50,254
consume it like a worm in the
bud, feed on her damask cheek.

747
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:56,360
She pined in thought, green
and yellow melancholy.

748
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:02,933
She sat, like patience on a
monument, smiling at people.

749
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:06,470
Is this not love indeed?

750
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,240
We men may seem [inaudible].

751
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:15,179
But indeed, that shows
I'm more than will.

752
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,749
But still, we may
prove much in our vows

753
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,317
but little in our love.

754
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:28,158
That's Viola's speech
from "Twelfth Night."

755
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:31,795
Everyone in LA knows
this fucking play.

756
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,263
JACK: It's been
around for centuries.

757
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:36,800
SHIRLEY: Viola had
a few good lines,

758
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:42,039
but Olivia was really
the one who could dress.

759
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,675
MONICA: Olivia was the lead.

760
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:49,513
Even in Nebraska, I had
gowns that could kill.

761
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:58,922
If you'll excuse me, I
really do need to touch up.

762
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,592
Think I'll do some
touching up, too.

763
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:02,493
Jack!

764
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,276
MONICA: Shirl, come out.

765
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,081
Shirl, come out.

766
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:25,582
Get out of here, Monica!

767
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:29,853
[slam]

768
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,822
MONICA: You're breaking
my fucking heart.

769
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:41,298
TAFFY: Jack, you
make a fine tequila.

770
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:44,234
I love the way salt tastes on
the webby part of your hand.

771
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:51,575
You know, between your
thumb and forefinger?

772
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:53,810
What do they call them?

773
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:54,945
The webby part.

774
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,396
Let me see your hand.

775
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,830
You read palms?

776
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,766
I love all that
metaphysical stuff.

777
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:19,002
Got a Ouija and everything.

778
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:23,173
Do you believe in reincarnation?

779
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,876
Nah.

780
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,845
This is it.

781
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,446
This is all you're
ever gonna get.

782
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:42,826
Did you know that men
and women are different?

783
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:46,430
Hell, I grew up in
Wyoming with animals.

784
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,799
There's no need for
the birds and bees talk

785
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:53,670
when you're around sheep
and cows and cowboys.

786
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,473
No, I mean the hands.

787
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:57,407
Oh.

788
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:04,081
MONICA: See how
the index finger is

789
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,149
longer than the third finger?

790
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,985
TAFFY: You mean the ring finger?

791
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,953
MONICA: Yeah.

792
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,590
For men, it's generally
the other way around.

793
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,559
It is?

794
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,863
The index finger is usually
the same length or even

795
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,431
shorter than the ring finger.

796
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,903
You read that in
Ripley or something.

797
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,671
Naw, it's true.

798
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:29,273
Does everybody knows this?

799
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,012
I didn't.

800
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:39,049
Guy named Erwin Reisner
told me about it.

801
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,818
It was this little game
he used to play in bed,

802
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,487
you know, like morning after?

803
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:50,994
He'd take your hand, and
he'd hold it up to his.

804
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,136
And then he'd show you how
the fingers didn't match up.

805
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:04,441
It was kind of a
ritual with him.

806
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,210
He'd always do that.

807
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,246
You mean every time
you slept with him?

808
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,281
Hmph, no-- with
different girls.

809
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,424
Erwin Reisner, huh?

810
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,625
Yeah.

811
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:22,592
Remember that name.

812
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,864
I guess you knew
him pretty well.

813
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:30,834
No.

814
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,536
I was 18.

815
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,306
Took me right off the
20th Century Limited.

816
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:39,609
Everything I had read
or heard about Hollywood

817
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:48,585
was right there, right in
front of me, just waiting.

818
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:55,892
And before you knew it, we were
playing footsie, and handsie

819
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:57,060
and everything elsie.

820
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,365
Ain't that just like a man?

821
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:04,968
Take advantage of a poor,
sweet, innocent young girl?

822
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:06,603
Oh, I was.

823
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,039
And probably from
a good neighborhood.

824
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,374
Hell's Kitchen, honey.

825
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:23,854
I wish I were from
someplace glamorous, like you.

826
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,255
10th Avenue and 44th?

827
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,559
That's about as
glamorous as the Argon.

828
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:38,068
There are no
party decorations--

829
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:41,805
no balloons, no
streamers, no nothing.

830
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:45,308
Well, 30's a tricky age
for someone who's standing

831
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:48,545
in for a 26-year-old actress.

832
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:52,716
30's a tricky age
for any actress.

833
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,986
32, in fact--

834
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,755
1905.

835
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,391
I saw her passport when
she hopped down to Havana.

836
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,064
That makes her a full six
years older than the fucking

837
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:10,667
star she's standing in for.

838
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:11,601
Gosh.

839
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,637
Where's Havana?

840
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,538
Cuba, honey.

841
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:15,639
Cuba.

842
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:20,143
Were a gent can fix
his lady's problems.

843
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,678
Oh, that problem.

844
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,780
Yep.

845
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,681
Oh, god!

846
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:25,615
The sign!

847
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:43,600
Where the hell is Martha Anne?

848
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,601
Fuck this.

849
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,216
Hey there, blue eyes.

850
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,818
How you doing?

851
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,620
Don't call me blue eyes.

852
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,088
I don't have blue eyes.

853
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:08,592
Well you ought to, doll.

854
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:11,761
One of these days, the Swedish
swan is going to need them.

855
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,566
Just two words for you, Shirl.

856
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:19,236
Techni-- color.

857
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:22,506
Those two words
don't scare me.

858
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:28,445
I'm not afraid of Technicolor,
which is one word, by the way.

859
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:29,412
Hm.

860
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:30,680
No?

861
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,449
SHIRLEY: No.

862
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:38,054
So what if I don't have
Greta Garbo's eyes?

863
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:41,791
Nobody has Garbo's eyes.

864
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:48,431
Calma started by
projecting red and green.

865
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:55,839
Technicolor is a
process that suits me.

866
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:03,914
Those have always been
my colors, red and green.

867
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:04,981
Stop and go.

868
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:10,287
Mostly go.

869
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:22,866
Now our boy Jack here, is
living in little Jackie Turner's

870
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:29,472
scope, a process developed
at the Palace Theater

871
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:39,649
in Boise, Idaho, a process
that only Jack sees,

872
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:44,421
where they take black
and white and turn it

873
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:50,627
into a blue riddance,
mm, like they did

874
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,596
in "A Midsummer Night's Dream."

875
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,400
What fools these mortals be?

876
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:08,912
That's why Jack and I
will always be friends,

877
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:17,053
because he knows about tinting,
and I know about red and green.

878
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,931
So don't call me blue eyes.

879
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:28,832
They're hazel.

880
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,503
And no.

881
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,639
I'm not afraid of Technicolor.

882
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:41,044
[ringing]

883
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:43,880
I'll get it.

884
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,115
Quick, it's Martha Anne!

885
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:46,950
Help me put these
candles on the cake!

886
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:47,884
Quickly!

887
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:48,852
Ernie's Pagoda Lounge.

888
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:58,261
Oh, it's you.

889
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:01,698
I can't really talk right now.

890
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,100
The car is fine.

891
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,035
Turn on the radio?

892
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,936
Why?

893
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,371
All right, all right.

894
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,246
PEGGY: OK, for God's
sake, everybody,

895
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,381
please try to be nice to her.

896
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,183
And Shirley, do you
think you could pretend

897
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,285
to be pleased to see her?
Please?

898
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,989
SHIRLEY: I'll be
good, like usual.

899
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,295
MAN (ON RADIO): We
interrupt this program

900
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:33,263
for a special bulletin.

901
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:34,264
PEGGY: Happy birthday!

902
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,832
MONICA: Hey glamourpuss!

903
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:37,634
PEGGY: Happy birthday!

904
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,503
Martha Anne, happy birthday!

905
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:44,007
MAN (ON RADIO): --and
one on [inaudible]

906
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,745
--opposite Gable
in "China Seas."

907
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,915
But Kansas City native,
born Harlene Carpenter,

908
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,452
succumbed just before noon
today to a cerebral edema

909
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,787
in Los Angeles's Good
Samaritan Hospital.

910
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:00,790
With her at her bedside where
her mother, and the actor,

911
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,825
William Powell.

912
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:04,227
Repeating our
bulletin, Jean Harlow,

913
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:10,433
the blonde bombshell of the
silver screen, is dead at 26.

914
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,569
I need a drink.

915
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:26,216
I just worked with her
this morning, you know,

916
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,184
on-- on "Saratoga?"

917
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:30,120
Violet-- that's
Jean's makeup lady.

918
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,422
Sometimes she does
my makeup, too.

919
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:34,023
Violet told me that the baby--

920
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,593
that's what Violet calls her--

921
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:40,263
had a premonition
last week sometime.

922
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,432
Anyhow, Violet was
sponging off her face,

923
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:46,302
and Harlow looked at
her, and said, "Violet?

924
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,505
I have a feeling
I'm going someplace

925
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,641
and I'm never coming back."

926
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,244
Violet thought she
was talking about Palm

927
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,179
Springs or maybe even Europe.

928
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:02,752
You ever had a
premonition, Jack?

929
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:06,923
My premonitions were all
about my Hollywood career.

930
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,459
Never coming back.

931
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,995
That sounds really final.

932
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,930
You think she knew?

933
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,999
TAFFY: I believe it.

934
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,100
I really do.

935
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,302
Who the hell are you?

936
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,070
Taffy.

937
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,405
I'm Taffy.

938
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:25,008
She's Hayworth's new stand-in.

939
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:25,909
Another one?

940
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,386
Harlow never shared any
her premonitions with me.

941
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,155
Hell, I don't do her makeup.

942
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:42,392
All I do is stand in her shadow.

943
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,894
Then I stand in her light.

944
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:48,565
Then I sit down while
Harlow does her scene.

945
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,301
Martha Anne's my name, honey--

946
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,536
just Martha Anne.

947
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,672
TAFFY: Martha
Anne's a nice name.

948
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:57,674
You think so, huh?

949
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:02,412
Well, it's a name straight out
of Lake Charles, Louisiana.

950
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,848
All of us are called by
two names down there.

951
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:07,951
It's a part of their French
tradition or Napoleonic code

952
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,185
or something.

953
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:12,121
But--

954
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:17,794
In my case, it was different.

955
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:21,731
Three years before I
was born, my father

956
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,734
had already taken
a powder for Panama

957
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:28,304
or some other
equatorial paradise,

958
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:31,541
and left mom a pair of twins.

959
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,777
There was a fire.

960
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:38,014
Nobody knows how it started.

961
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:40,450
There wasn't anybody
there when it ignited,

962
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:44,721
except those baby twins.

963
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:48,258
When rescue workers
found them, they thought

964
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,026
they were burnt rag dolls.

965
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,595
Oh, sweet Jesus.

966
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:53,997
They were my sisters.

967
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:02,405
My mother had been out
all night conjuring

968
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,575
me up with some truck driver--

969
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:08,444
was a produce truck, I think.

970
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:12,315
And I was born 30
years ago today--

971
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:13,983
June 7, 1907.

972
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:22,525
My mother hated me
from that day onward.

973
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:27,263
Soon as I could walk, she would
drag me through the cemetery,

974
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:31,601
pull me along by the hand
through the tombstones.

975
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:36,072
I can still remember how
that soft earth would crunch

976
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:42,178
beneath my feet,
until we'd arrive

977
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:50,720
at those two tiny matching
headstones for two baby girls--

978
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,958
Martha and Anne.

979
00:59:55,058 --> 01:00:00,129
My momma would stick my nose
in the soft earth of those two

980
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:05,268
tiny plots and say, "Martha
Anne, if they hadn't died,

981
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:06,836
you wouldn't be alive."

982
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:11,307
Martha Anne?

983
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,080
My momma had christened
me Martha Anne.

984
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:23,686
She used to force my hand into
the engraving on the tombstones

985
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:27,123
and make me trace their names.

986
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:32,362
"If they had lived, you
wouldn't have a soul."

987
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:37,200
She'd make me pray for their
salvation, a special prayer

988
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,404
she had concocted,
offering up my chance

989
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:44,874
at heaven in
exchange for theirs,

990
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:50,179
a prayer for their eternal life.

991
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:55,218
I had to pray that my soul
would be damned to hell

992
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,920
if it meant heaven
for Martha and Anne.

993
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:03,659
It was a two-for-one deal.

994
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,929
Momma wasn't sure
God would buy it,

995
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,800
but she kept me
praying for 16 years.

996
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:14,771
I don't know what to say.

997
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,239
Yes you do.

998
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,975
All of you know it.

999
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:21,277
It's like you were
born to be a stand-in.

1000
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:28,051
MARTHA ANNE: Jack,
Harlow's dead, but alive

1001
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:30,653
forever in the
memory of her fans,

1002
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:35,191
a legend, the platinum blonde.

1003
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:36,559
Me?

1004
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:39,062
I'm really dead.

1005
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,165
If it wasn't for
Erwin, my very own man,

1006
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:47,937
a rotten snake, but all
mine, I really would

1007
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,238
think about killing myself.

1008
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:55,645
Oh, God!

1009
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:57,280
I look like death.

1010
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,916
I didn't even
realize I was crying.

1011
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:02,452
This one's going to
require major surgery.

1012
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,386
Back in a jiff.

1013
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:13,362
JACK: You think Shirley's right?

1014
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:14,497
About what?

1015
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:15,798
About me.

1016
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,967
I mean, all that little
Jackie Turner scope.

1017
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,102
What do you think?

1018
01:02:21,737 --> 01:02:24,507
Maybe there is some
process only I can see.

1019
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:26,576
She hit a nerve.

1020
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:30,513
Yeah-- the one in her arm.

1021
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:32,515
Yes, but in wine
there is truth.

1022
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:34,016
Think that goes for dope, too?

1023
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:37,787
Well, don't they make
truth serum with morphine?

1024
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:40,323
Suppose I do see things
that nobody else can.

1025
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,192
Sweet blood Jesus, Jack.

1026
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:46,162
You're supposed to be the
normal one around here.

1027
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,997
I'm counting on you to
hold this mess together

1028
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,665
until we can all go
home and just forget

1029
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:53,002
this night ever happened.

1030
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:53,903
Jack!

1031
01:02:59,775 --> 01:03:02,145
Some party, huh?

1032
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:03,713
Where's Monica?

1033
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,314
She went to the valley.

1034
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:09,118
She had a callback
on "Twelfth Night."

1035
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:10,419
Yeah, that's what she said.

1036
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,658
You think Monica lied
about her callback?

1037
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:19,896
Oh, maybe.

1038
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:21,230
Why would she lie?

1039
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:25,401
Because she's a fucking
stand-in, that's why.

1040
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,271
PEGGY: She doesn't
always talk like one.

1041
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,106
Well, no.

1042
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:35,311
No, because Monica fancies
herself as an actress.

1043
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,046
She's ashamed of
being a stand-in.

1044
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:41,951
Viola's a swell part.

1045
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:46,589
I played it once, back home
at the Neptune Theater.

1046
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:47,490
Figures.

1047
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,497
Say, who was that
call you took from?

1048
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:56,365
The call.

1049
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,868
You know the one,
the one where someone

1050
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,269
told you to put on the radio?

1051
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:06,175
Nobody.

1052
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,144
Nobody?

1053
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:13,049
Nobody just called and told
you to put on the radio?

1054
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:17,353
Could that nobody's name be
Raymond Dubliet, possibly?

1055
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,255
Rhonda, please.

1056
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,823
Well, you told
me on the way over,

1057
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:23,092
Taffy, that you and
Raymond were through.

1058
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,461
And I've never heard of
props sending out Duesenbergs

1059
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:26,729
like they were lipsticks.

1060
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,031
And Raymond has an
office on the lot, so--

1061
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:29,966
Come on, Rhonda.

1062
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:32,134
You know me.

1063
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:35,538
Yeah, I think
I'm beginning to.

1064
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:37,073
PEGGY: You're new.

1065
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:40,042
We could use some fresh
blood around here.

1066
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:41,244
We used to have Joan Crawford.

1067
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:42,178
Ugh.

1068
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,146
PEGGY: She loved
to needle people.

1069
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:47,250
I'd sit here,
drinking my Martini,

1070
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:52,154
doing my nails peacefully,
and she'd needle me.

1071
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,522
Yeah.

1072
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:57,493
Shirl finally threw her down
a flight of stairs, huh Shirl?

1073
01:04:57,593 --> 01:05:02,398
Selznick lot, stage eight.

1074
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:07,937
You're an unusual girl.

1075
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:13,909
Am I?

1076
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:16,879
I always wanted to be.

1077
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:19,315
You're not half as
naive as she pretends.

1078
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,363
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1079
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,264
Shoot, honey.

1080
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:41,570
What's "Saratoga" about?

1081
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:45,775
PEGGY: It's a racetrack
picture from Metro.

1082
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:51,614
Gable and Harlow
and Martha Anne--

1083
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:54,083
maybe they'll try to finish it.

1084
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:55,651
It's not finished?

1085
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:56,686
It's what the town's saying.

1086
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:00,956
TAFFY: Town.

1087
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:04,727
Isn't it a city yet?

1088
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:05,661
Never will be.

1089
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:10,066
OK.

1090
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,634
So it's not finished.

1091
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:13,769
Harlow's not available.

1092
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:14,670
What do they do now?

1093
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:24,480
Well, if they have most
of her closeups in the can,

1094
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,615
they might be able
to shoot around her.

1095
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:30,419
And if they don't
have all her closeups?

1096
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:32,221
They could shoot
some over-the-shoulder

1097
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,824
shots using a double.

1098
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,625
What would this
double have to do?

1099
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:39,495
PEGGY: Just stand there and
look like Harlow from the back.

1100
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:43,165
Would she have to
be the same height?

1101
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,601
I suppose not,
for those shots.

1102
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:47,336
She could be any height.

1103
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:50,272
And she could dye
her hair or wear a wig,

1104
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:51,640
if it wasn't already platinum.

1105
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:57,413
Honey, no one on
God's green earth

1106
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:01,684
is born with hair
Harlow's color.

1107
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:02,785
What about the long shots?

1108
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,959
Those would be harder to fake.

1109
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:12,561
You'd need someone
with Harlow's frame.

1110
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:14,797
Martha Anne can do it.

1111
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:18,534
She's in no shape
to do anything.

1112
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:21,203
She'll recover.

1113
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:27,943
Sweetheart, don't
even think about it.

1114
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:29,912
I'm just gathering
information.

1115
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,080
You're five inches too tall.

1116
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,181
I could crouch.

1117
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,822
Your figure doesn't go
in and out like Harlow's.

1118
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:42,124
It's all curvy like Hayworth's.

1119
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:43,259
Just curious.

1120
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:53,602
Is Martha Anne talented?

1121
01:07:56,238 --> 01:08:01,477
She's tried singing,
dancing, acting.

1122
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,580
There's no beginning
to that girl's talent.

1123
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,116
TAFFY: My father used
to say that birds don't

1124
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:10,052
fly because they have wings.

1125
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:12,254
They have wings
because they fly.

1126
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:21,030
Martha Anne has no wings.

1127
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,898
I thought so.

1128
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:24,467
Did you?

1129
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,435
Yes.

1130
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:27,636
Instantly.

1131
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:28,737
How perceptive.

1132
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:35,444
You must think I'm awful.

1133
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:44,120
But I see a real
chance for myself--

1134
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:48,023
a real opportunity.

1135
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,758
I could be in "Saratoga."

1136
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:53,329
I could be noticed.

1137
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:01,337
No one's ever going
to see me standing in.

1138
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:02,838
I could do that my whole life.

1139
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:05,207
When I die, they wouldn't
even print my obituary.

1140
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:10,346
Who wants to read about an
ex-stunt girl turned stand-in?

1141
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,853
But if they put
me in "Saratoga,"

1142
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:22,391
it could lead to something.

1143
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,828
I'd be the girl who saved
Harlow's last performance.

1144
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:26,762
I'd be in pictures.

1145
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,569
I'd be a movie star
with my own stand-in.

1146
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,644
You heard me do Viola's speech.

1147
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:46,815
Maybe-- just maybe,
I've got wings.

1148
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:52,354
I know I'm nothing.

1149
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:57,593
But with God's help,
and a little luck,

1150
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,229
I just might rise above
my station and amount

1151
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:01,463
to something.

1152
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:07,202
"Saratoga's"
Martha Anne's job.

1153
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:09,004
And no one's taking her place.

1154
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:10,272
Understand?

1155
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:20,416
[music playing]

1156
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:27,323
It's gonna rain again.

1157
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:37,199
Jack, I-- I need to
tell you something.

1158
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:40,369
You have a confession to make?

1159
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:42,137
How did you know?

1160
01:10:42,237 --> 01:10:43,872
Just part of the job, kiddo.

1161
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:45,441
Just part of the job.

1162
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:48,510
TAFFY: Monica didn't go to
the Valley for any call-back.

1163
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,547
That call she got had nothing
to do with Shakespeare.

1164
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,882
Monica's call came from Metro.

1165
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:57,286
I think it was the director, or
at least one of his assistants.

1166
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,655
He wants Monica to test
for Harlow's replacement

1167
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:00,556
in "Saratoga."

1168
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:03,859
[slam]

1169
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:10,065
Why the hell would MGM hire
Monica to stand in for Harlow?

1170
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:13,002
They already have
a Jean Harlow--

1171
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,604
Martha Anne.

1172
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:21,677
Platinum blonde, baby
blues, strange ass--

1173
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,312
besides, she's under contract.

1174
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:27,716
Come on, Jack.

1175
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:31,787
Let's go inside before
we get drenched.

1176
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:36,158
Get me a whiskey, baby,
ginger ale on the side.

1177
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:37,393
And don't be stingy.

1178
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:00,582
Where's Rhonda?

1179
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:05,454
When Dietrich
calls, Rhonda runs.

1180
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:07,389
Her master's voice.

1181
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,142
PEGGY: Are you all right?

1182
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:28,110
I'm fine.

1183
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,185
You're the new stand-in.

1184
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,619
I remember.

1185
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,322
I haven't actually
started yet.

1186
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:41,590
My star's away on vacation.

1187
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:42,925
But as soon as she
gets back, we're going

1188
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,760
right into our first film.

1189
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,530
You have nice skin,
nice bones, a good height.

1190
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:53,936
You're lucky-- a
lucky little liar!

1191
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:54,636
Excuse me?

1192
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:56,105
Oh, don't get upset.

1193
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:57,406
We're stand-ins.

1194
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:00,008
We can talk to each other.

1195
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:01,844
Have you ever seen Jean Harlow?

1196
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:05,814
TAFFY: Um, "Red Dust," "China
Seas," "Hold Your Man,"

1197
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:08,050
"Wife First," "His
Secretary," all of them.

1198
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,954
No, I mean in person.

1199
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:12,855
You mean in real life?

1200
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:18,527
No.

1201
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:25,000
I stood in for her on
all of those pictures,

1202
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,269
every one you named.

1203
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,637
You know what dead is?

1204
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,373
Dead is you can't work anymore.

1205
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:35,077
Jean Harlow can't work anymore!

1206
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:36,779
I'm sorry about Miss Harlow.

1207
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:39,248
Well, that's very
kind of you to say.

1208
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:41,083
You're very young.

1209
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:42,651
I'm 19.

1210
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,386
19?

1211
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:45,320
19.

1212
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,689
At 19, I was--

1213
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:53,896
Now I'm 30 years old.

1214
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:54,630
You still look 19.

1215
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,031
MARTHA ANNE: Shut up!

1216
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:57,833
Just shut the fuck up!

1217
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:10,112
Why did you call me a liar?

1218
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:15,684
Right there is a ladies room.

1219
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:18,520
And in that lovely little
toilet is a window,

1220
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:22,191
a skimpy little screen window.

1221
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,193
Let me tell you something, kid.

1222
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:28,630
No one but no one is taking
Harlow's place in "Saratoga--"

1223
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,065
not while I'm alive!

1224
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:30,999
Got that?

1225
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:37,372
Look, I'm new.

1226
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:38,340
I'm just starting out.

1227
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,741
I don't know anything.

1228
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:43,045
Oh, you're starting
out and I'm ending up?

1229
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:43,979
Is that what you think?

1230
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:45,180
No.

1231
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,281
I'm just confused.

1232
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:47,316
Huh.

1233
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:48,917
A stand-in, confused?

1234
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:56,625
You're very beautiful.

1235
01:14:56,725 --> 01:15:00,295
I bet you have guys
eating out of your hand.

1236
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:02,397
No, nothing like that.

1237
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,532
A boyfriend?

1238
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,100
I've only been here a month.

1239
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,538
It would take a girl like you
about one hour in this town.

1240
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:12,107
I'm here to work.

1241
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:13,275
I got a man.

1242
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,711
He's a perfect bastard.

1243
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,546
Look, I know you're upset.

1244
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,381
He's good to me
once in a while.

1245
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:25,287
When he got me pregnant he
took me on vacation to Havana.

1246
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:29,358
I'm sorry I said those things
before, about "Saratoga."

1247
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:31,426
And I'm sorry you overheard.

1248
01:15:31,526 --> 01:15:34,363
If they're gonna
finish "Saratoga,"

1249
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,498
they'll be giving me a ring--

1250
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:40,302
not Monica, not you,
not anyone else.

1251
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:42,037
Me!

1252
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:46,141
(WHISPERING) I'm
sorry I offended you.

1253
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:48,577
I'd like to be friends.

1254
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,312
We're stand-ins.

1255
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:52,347
Can't we be friends?

1256
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,716
I'll shake your hand.

1257
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:56,919
I'll buy you a drink.

1258
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:11,233
Oh!

1259
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:18,140
Did you know that men
and women are different?

1260
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,810
See how your ring finger is
longer than your index finger?

1261
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,046
Well, with men, it's
the other way around.

1262
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:27,983
Their index finger is the same
length, or maybe even longer.

1263
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,964
You're fucking my boyfriend!

1264
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:42,898
[gunshot]

1265
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:45,167
[gasp]

1266
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,302
SHIRLEY: Jesus Christ!

1267
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:48,370
Oh god, no.

1268
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,638
SHIRLEY: Oh, my god.

1269
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:50,906
Martha Anne!

1270
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:52,774
Don't give me an
excuse, Shirley.

1271
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:54,643
I never liked you, anyway.

1272
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:55,777
Martha Anne!

1273
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:56,979
MARTHA ANNE: I do
like you, Jack.

1274
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:59,414
But I got another
bullet in here.

1275
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:01,483
Don't make me kill you, too.

1276
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:04,519
Two bullets like
two sleeping babies.

1277
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,089
Get against that
wall, all of you!

1278
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:20,435
My mother gave me this gun when
I was 16, still a little girl.

1279
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,005
But that's not how
the boys acted.

1280
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:27,409
Momma thought I needed
protection, a Derringer,

1281
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:32,514
a lady-like weapon, two bullets,
enough to do the job, two

1282
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:37,419
sleeping twins, all snug in
their own little chambers,

1283
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:40,088
Martha and Anne, snug in
their own little coffins.

1284
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:46,962
Jean Harlow understood.

1285
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:51,533
I'm going away from here,
and I'm never coming back.

1286
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:52,801
JACK: Martha Anne, don't!

1287
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:53,802
PEGGY: Martha Anne,
please don't do it!

1288
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:54,970
MONICA: I got the part!

1289
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:55,971
No!

1290
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:56,705
[gunshot]

1291
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:58,240
[screaming]

1292
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,041
SHIRLEY: Monica!

1293
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:00,942
[inaudible] didn't need me.

1294
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:02,878
Maybe, maybe I'm dead!

1295
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:05,580
JACK: Martha Anne!

1296
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,082
PEGGY: Get me the police.

1297
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,116
SHIRLEY: Monica.

1298
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:09,618
Hey, is there a cop
named Fritz there?

1299
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:10,519
Gimme that.

1300
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:11,653
Yeah, it's Ernie's.

1301
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:13,622
We got a bar over
on Santa Monica.

1302
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,157
Yeah, we need an
ambulance, a Hearse,

1303
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:17,159
a couple of boys from homicide,
and the coroners, as fast

1304
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:18,093
as you can.

1305
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,128
Yeah.

1306
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:22,064
Best reading I ever did,
and no one was filming it.

1307
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,068
Oh, Martha Anne.

1308
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:29,104
[crying] Ow.

1309
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,906
Monica, you're
not going to die.

1310
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,174
You just got a shot in the arm.

1311
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:33,108
Ow.

1312
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:33,809
[sirens]

1313
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:35,343
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Ow.

1314
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:36,344
Ow.

1315
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:37,345
OK, we're getting someone.

1316
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:38,280
She's all right.

1317
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:41,116
[tires squealing]

1318
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:44,653
Yeah Ernie, I
know the lecture.

1319
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:46,888
I know how life is.

1320
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:49,591
Yeah, bad publicity.

1321
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:50,726
I know.

1322
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:53,228
I know murder is
bad for business.

1323
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:56,298
I still say the Pagoda
should stay open.

1324
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,667
No, I know how it works.

1325
01:18:58,767 --> 01:18:59,601
No, no, no, no.

1326
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:00,936
You talk to him.

1327
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:04,439
If he comes to his
senses, thank him for me.

1328
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:07,576
Ernie, we owe it to ourselves.

1329
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:08,477
OK.

1330
01:19:19,754 --> 01:19:20,822
Sure is dead around here.

1331
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:22,090
MONICA: I know.

1332
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,959
They suspended work
for one whole minute

1333
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:25,460
in memory of Harlow.

1334
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,096
11:00 to 11:01.

1335
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:28,864
Mm.

1336
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:30,432
So tell me what happened.

1337
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:32,868
You should've seen
the look on Erwin's face

1338
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:34,803
when I walked
through his office.

1339
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:37,939
Erwin Reisner?

1340
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:40,976
He didn't believe that
I had the balls to do it.

1341
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:43,178
PEGGY: Neither did I.

1342
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:47,682
So his secretary announced
me like I was royalty,

1343
01:19:47,782 --> 01:19:50,685
Eleanor Roosevelt to somebody.

1344
01:19:50,785 --> 01:19:54,189
And I looked him right
in the baby blues.

1345
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:57,192
I could read his
smarmy little mind.

1346
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,861
(LOW VOICE) What
does this bitch want?

1347
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:04,432
But it came out, "Why
Monica, what a surprise."

1348
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:08,103
So I said, "Don't get up, Erwin.

1349
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:12,874
I just need a tiny
little favor."

1350
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:15,744
So I put on my
best fuck me pout--

1351
01:20:15,844 --> 01:20:17,245
you know the one.

1352
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:18,046
I do.

1353
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:21,816
Martha Anne needs a lawyer.

1354
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,719
And you know, Erwin runs
with all the big shots.

1355
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,921
So he gives me a name.

1356
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,756
PEGGY: You got
Martha Anne a lawyer?

1357
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:28,657
[ringing]

1358
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:29,958
Uh-huh.

1359
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:31,726
Well, let me tell you
I spent my morning--

1360
01:20:31,826 --> 01:20:34,229
at the morgue.

1361
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:36,965
Sweet Jesus, it's like
a Frigidaire down there.

1362
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:41,169
And the morgue attendant
was wearing a fur coat.

1363
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:47,809
And there she was, Taffy, laying
there like a smoked trout.

1364
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:51,980
They asked me, "Is
this Taffy Entwistle?"

1365
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,883
All I could do was just nod.

1366
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:55,817
That's all it took.

1367
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:57,819
She was identified.

1368
01:20:57,919 --> 01:21:00,055
And no Raymond Dubliet?

1369
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:03,992
Not at the morgue, not at
the train depot, nowhere--

1370
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:07,295
but he did send two guys
to pick up his Duesenberg.

1371
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:11,600
Guys like that use girls
like us like tissue paper.

1372
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,635
[whistle]

1373
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:14,569
Jack!

1374
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:15,570
Jack?

1375
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:18,340
What are you doing here?

1376
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:22,811
Job interview, [inaudible],,
assistant choreographer.

1377
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:23,845
Did you get it?

1378
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:25,013
Ah, this is showbiz, Peg.

1379
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:26,381
I'll believe it
when I'm on the set.

1380
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:29,050
Oh, ah.

1381
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:32,320
Well, I spent the
morning at the morgue.

1382
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:33,922
Oh, I found this.

1383
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:35,657
I found this in Taffy's pocket.

1384
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:46,901
"Variety, September 20, 1932--

1385
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:50,805
the [inaudible] actress
Peg Entwistle, suicide.

1386
01:21:50,905 --> 01:21:54,142
Peg Entwistle, legitimate
actress who had slight picture

1387
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:57,579
experience, was found dead in
the hills back of Hollywood

1388
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,581
this morning by a pedestrian.

1389
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:02,984
According to the police, she
had evidently jumped off the H

1390
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:04,719
on the Hollywood sign.

1391
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:07,088
With her was found this note--

1392
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:11,159
afraid I am a coward, and
I'm worried for many things.

1393
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:13,962
If only I would have
done this long ago,

1394
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:16,431
I could've saved a lot of pain."

1395
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:17,799
Taffy's sister.

1396
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:20,402
Exactly.

1397
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:21,803
[sigh]

1398
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:23,505
What do you want to do?

1399
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:24,439
Martini.

1400
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:25,740
Let's get a drink!

1401
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,742
Leave it to me.

1402
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:30,278
To Taffy and Harlow.

1403
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:33,448
May god welcome them to
the kingdom of heaven,

1404
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:37,052
for eternal bliss,
salvation, and joy.

1405
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:43,024
Hey, Rhonda.

1406
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:46,194
Hey, Peg.

1407
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:47,595
How's Deitrich, Rhonda?

1408
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:52,033
Taffy.

1409
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:57,839
God, I really loved her.

1410
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:01,009
If only I could have been
here, I could have saved her.

1411
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:02,210
You'd be dead.

1412
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,679
Yeah, but you
ever meet someone,

1413
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:07,248
and you just love them?

1414
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:09,017
And maybe you have a
relationship, maybe

1415
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:12,153
you don't-- it doesn't matter.

1416
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:17,125
You love them anyway, and
you love them forever.

1417
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:18,326
You hardly knew her.

1418
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:19,661
[cat call]

1419
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:22,130
JACK: Mm, wow.

1420
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,068
Make it a Coke, Jack.

1421
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:35,043
PEGGY: She's being
a good girl tonight.

1422
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:36,945
SHIRLEY: Well, I'm
doing it for my health.

1423
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:38,546
RHONDA: Health?

1424
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:43,518
Shirl, your liver
expired with a repeal.

1425
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:47,956
And that lovely set of matched
hypodermics in your purse?

1426
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:49,824
Gone.

1427
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:50,759
That easy?

1428
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:54,262
Hell.

1429
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:59,634
See, first you take
a vial of morphine,

1430
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:03,071
and then you take a
vial of distilled water,

1431
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:06,508
and for every amount of
morphine that you take out,

1432
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:13,815
you replace it with water,
and soon it's all over.

1433
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:17,385
Well, I mean, except for
the retching your guts out

1434
01:24:17,485 --> 01:24:22,457
and the not sleeping
for 72 hours.

1435
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:24,125
But I think--

1436
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:27,295
I think more clearly now.

1437
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,631
And I see better, too.

1438
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:30,532
And what do you see?

1439
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:36,638
The future, Jack.

1440
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:41,843
Let's get out of here.

1441
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:44,546
You owe it to yourself.

1442
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:45,847
PEGGY: Yeah, Jack.

1443
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:46,915
Come on.

1444
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:49,084
You're gonna get that job.

1445
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:50,218
Come on, Jack.

1446
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:54,456
Well, I'm a stand-in.

1447
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:55,523
I'm OK.

1448
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:58,793
16.50 every day.

1449
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:02,097
Other girls are on the streets.

1450
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:03,498
I'm a stand-in.

1451
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:05,333
Life is sweet.

1452
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:11,239
Paramount or MGM, Warner
Brothers-- all of them.

1453
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:14,576
Come on, Jack!

1454
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:16,978
I'm coming.

1455
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:18,746
By, Ernie's!

1456
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:21,716
They never did have
good Chinese food, anyway.

1457
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:25,720
[music playing]

1458
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:47,936
(SINGING) I want to be
happy, but I won't be happy

1459
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:52,473
till I make you happy too.

1460
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:57,111
Life's really wroth living
when we are mirth-giving.

1461
01:26:57,212 --> 01:27:01,449
Why can't I give some to you?

1462
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:06,454
When skies are gray, and
you say you are blue,

1463
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:11,192
I'll send a sun smiling through.

1464
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:16,030
I want to be happy,
but I won't be happy

1465
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:19,634
till I make you happy too.
