1
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,659
- [Zach] They think they have to

2
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:30,423
tell you that my story is a lie.

3
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:32,915
But in reality, every bit of this happened

4
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:35,918
just the way you're about to see it.

5
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,254
(phone rings)

6
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:52,027
- [Laura] Hi, this is
Laura, leave a message.

7
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:53,191
(answering machine beeps)

8
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,470
- Hey Laura, it's Zach.

9
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,350
I'm going to the bar.

10
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,030
I was wondering if you wanna meet up for a

11
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:02,951
drink or maybe some dinner
tonight or whenever.

12
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:06,749
Call me back.

13
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:09,405
Los Angeles.

14
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:13,393
Every night feels the same in Los Angeles.

15
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:15,269
If you're a one in a million in this city,

16
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,249
there's still seven more just like you.

17
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:20,109
We're all just duplications of copies

18
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,133
of Xeroxes, each of us living proof

19
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:25,009
that there's no one and nothing here.

20
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:26,728
(phone rings)

21
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:28,238
- [Mandy] Hi, it's Mandy,
leave me a message.

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,540
(answering machine beeps)

23
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,980
- Hey Mandy, it's Zach.

24
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:34,336
I'm going to the bar.

25
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:36,671
I was just wondering if you wanna meet up.

26
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:40,908
We could get dinner or a
drink tonight or tomorrow.

27
00:01:40,908 --> 00:01:43,448
Whenever you're free.

28
00:01:43,452 --> 00:01:44,292
Call me.

29
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:09,664
(phone rings)

30
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:12,753
- [Rebecca] Hello?

31
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:13,947
- Hey, Rebecca?

32
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:14,777
It's Zach.

33
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,140
- [Rebecca] Hey, Zach.

34
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,609
- You still wanna go see that
Hieronymus Bosch exhibit?

35
00:02:18,612 --> 00:02:19,652
- [Rebecca] Sure.

36
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:21,041
- I'm going down to the
bar, I'm just wondering

37
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:22,945
if you want to meet up
for a drink tonight.

38
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:27,107
- [Rebecca] Take me to the
exhibit, we can have one after.

39
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:32,695
(dramatic acoustic guitar music)

40
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:42,537

41
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:47,865

00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:10,835

48
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:43,437
- [Rebecca] Hey!

49
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,019
I'll be right down!

50
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:50,685
â™« When you're sick and you can't get well

51

52
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,201
- [Zach] Hey there.

53
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,026
- Yo.

54
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:05,522
I'm excited.

55
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:08,806
Been wanting to see the
Bosch exhibit for weeks.

56
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:10,762
Didn't they burn him in the end?

57
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:11,796
- [Zach] Probably.

58
00:04:11,804 --> 00:04:15,974
They used to kill everyone
that was cool, didn't they?

59
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:21,027
- [Voiceover] You have
reached your destination.

60
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,148
- Oh man, is it a weekend?

61
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:25,447
- Look at the line.

62
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:27,081
- [Zach] I hate lines.

63
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,643
- [Rebecca] Yeah, I don't do lines.

64
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:30,873
- [Zach] I don't wanna be around

65
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,627
that many people right now.

66
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:35,677
Do you mind if we just
go to the bar instead?

67
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:39,918
- [Rebecca] Yeah, no, let's
just go straight then.

68
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:41,388
- We'll just go on the weekday

69
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,650
when it's not as crowded, you know?

70
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:46,474
- [Voiceover] Now turn left.

71
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,590
- [Zach] That bar was
like a little bubble.

72
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,200
My own private world.

73
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:53,028
(soft rock music)

74
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:01,611
- What are you thinking about?

75
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:02,435
- [Zach] Huh?

76
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:03,588
- You're just sitting there staring,

77
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:05,649
you're not even talking to me.

78
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:06,645
- Oh, sorry.

79
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:09,177
I do that sometimes.

80
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:20,019
- You could've had me tonight,

81
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,630
but instead you showed me what

82
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,039
a raging alcoholic you are.

83
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:24,997
- Really?

84
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:26,266
(chuckles)

85
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:28,438
I didn't realize I was doing it.

86
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,484
I thought if you get a girl drunk,

87
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:33,324
that improves your chances of sex.

88
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:37,992
- I am not even talking about sex.

89
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,617
- [Zach] Hmm?

90
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,290
Well what are you talking about?

91
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:46,446
(loud thud)

92
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,577
- [Rebecca] Ow!

93
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,499
- [Zach] You all right?

94
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,039
- [Rebecca] Nice house.

95
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:51,883
- Thanks.

96
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:55,162
Come on.

97
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:04,705
You want another drink?

98
00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:06,613
- Yeah, I just think it's real creepy that

99
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:09,059
you drove me here without even asking me.

100
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:12,567
- Yeah, well I figured that was implied.

101
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:13,989
You implied that.

102
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,673
- You misunderstood me.

103
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,415
I have a boyfriend, I just wanted to

104
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:21,168
see the Hieronymus Bosch exhibit.

105
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:26,055
- Yeah, but you kissed me earlier.

106
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:31,542
- Yeah, that happens, I just...

107
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:35,044
Wanted to see if the Earth was gonna move.

108
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:39,286
- And?

109
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:40,118
- And...

110
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:42,015
It didn't.

111
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:44,808
- Yes it did.

112
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:57,356
What?

113
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,149
- I have a boyfriend.

114
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,440
- (mumbles) tell me you're not alone.

115
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:04,942
- What does that have to do with anything?

116
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:07,482
No!

117
00:07:08,985 --> 00:07:12,565
I just told you I have
a fucking boyfriend.

118
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:14,608
- Well I don't know what to do

119
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:16,288
here, I mean I can't rape you.

120
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:19,707
- That's right you can't
rape me, motherfucker.

121
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,730
No.

122
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:22,806
- Come on, let's just go
to my room and lie down.

123
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:23,638
- No.

124
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:24,471
- Come on.

125
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:25,314
- No, no!

126
00:07:26,706 --> 00:07:27,536
Stop it!

127
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,408
- Why?

128
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,238
- No, no!

129
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:33,548
Because I have a boyfriend!

130
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:37,446
Take me home.

131
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:39,498
- I already did take you home.

132
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:40,868
- Take me to my house!

133
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:41,952
- No!

134
00:07:41,952 --> 00:07:44,202
(laughing)

135
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,384
- Freakin' now, take me!

136
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:50,336
- I will, I will, I will,
I will, I swear to God.

137
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:53,183
I swear to God I'll take you home.

138
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:57,113
(laughing)

139
00:07:58,961 --> 00:07:59,791
Come here.

140
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:01,567
Lame.

141
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:16,861
- I don't know whether
to kiss you or slap you.

142
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:18,856
- Why don't you do both?

143
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:40,576
(car revs)

144
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:43,909
(jazzy music)

145
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:45,395
I can't remember how many girls

146
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:47,151
I'm messing with right
now, I think there's

147
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:50,569
four and a half I know about for sure.

148
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,430
Why would I like Crazy Eyes more?

149
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:54,928
(phone rings)

150
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:00,634
I thought I told you
not to keep calling me.

151
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:02,384
- [Latisha] I just wanna see you so bad.

152
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:04,878
(phone rings)

153
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:07,998
- Hello?

154
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:11,026
- [Latisha] I wish I was in your bed.

155
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:13,083
I was thinking maybe you could book

156
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:16,211
me a ticket to come
visit you next weekend.

157
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:19,429
- I don't know what
I'm doing next weekend.

158
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,125
I'm drunk, let me call you in the morning.

159
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,609
- [Latisha] Okay.

160
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:24,529
I love you.

161
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:27,655
Zach?

162
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:30,578
I love you.

163
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:31,908
- Okay, goodbye.

164
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:41,908
(phone rings)

165
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:45,242
Hello?

166
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,620
- I said I love you.

167
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:48,214
- Okay, I love you.

168
00:09:49,962 --> 00:09:54,372
I'm going to sleep now, would
you please stop calling me?

169
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:55,788
- [Latisha] Okay.

170
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:06,435
(phone rings)

171
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:14,702
Hello?

172
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:15,968
- [Ex] Zach, what's wrong with you,

173
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:18,191
you were supposed to pick up your son.

174
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:19,513
- Shit.

175
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:20,395
What day is it?

176
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:21,951
- He's been sitting here for hours

177
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:23,265
waiting for you with his backpack,

178
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:25,755
he was so excited to see you.

179
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:27,431
- Can I come get him right now?

180
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:29,873
- No, that's too late.

181
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:34,025
You know what, you're not
having him until Thanksgiving.

182
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:40,352
- About Thanksgiving, I was thinking...

183
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,190
Maybe we could all just
get together for dinner.

184
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:45,889
Like we used to.

185
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:48,638
- Like a family, with your mom and dad?

186
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:50,435
- Yeah, like a family.

187
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:53,693
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.

188
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:58,981
- All right, see you.

189
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:01,361
Tell him I'm sorry, okay?

190
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:02,265
- Fuck you.

191
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:10,544
(bass guitar music)

192
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:17,722
- I need Crazy Eyes.

193
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:19,121
- Man, shut up man, fuck that bitch,

194
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,989
stop complaining about her.

195
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:22,531
You know she drinks the most disgusting

196
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:24,427
shit with cherries on the top.

197
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:26,121
She's ridiculous, man.

198
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,839
- What I'm gonna do is take her to dinner.

199
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:29,669
Then...

200
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:32,233
Oh fuck.

201
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:35,061
(heavy breathing)

202
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,335
If I can get her to share more than

203
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:39,833
two bottles of wine with me, she's gonna

204
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:42,461
want more, so I'll get a third bottle.

205
00:11:42,462 --> 00:11:45,462
Then I'll tell her there's
a fourth bottle at my house.

206
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:47,962
By then, she'll be on a sugar rush,

207
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,458
so she's gonna be craving a fourth bottle.

208
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,048
Then I'll just take her home--

209
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:56,524
- Yeah, and you'll struggle fuck her.

210
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,448
- Nah, it won't be a struggle

211
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:00,776
'cause she'll be passed out.

212
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:04,322
I'm kidding, she won't know.

213
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:06,392
She'll be so sweetened by the four or five

214
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,464
bottles of wine she'll
be dying to fuck me.

215
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,558
- [Dan] Yeah, maybe.

216
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:13,382
I still say getting four or five girls all

217
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:16,698
coked up in the jacuzzi is the best plan.

218
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:19,958
- But I gotta, I gotta
have this Crazy Eyes girl.

219
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,070
- Shut up about her.

220
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:22,205
- Don't know what it is about her.

221
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,210
- [Dan] God!

222
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:32,848
- [Zach] How you doing?

223
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:36,884
- [Rebecca] I feel like shit.

224
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,779
I can't even function,
it gets dark so early.

225
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,025
- Yeah, me too.

226
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:44,257
I don't know if I can even handle

227
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,973
being around people right now.

228
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:50,037
- Me either, I just woke up,
I haven't eaten anything.

229
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,949
I haven't even bathed in three days.

230
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:53,781
- Well...

231
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:56,383
What do you wanna do, you wanna maybe

232
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:58,243
go get a glass of wine, some food then

233
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,689
before we go to the museum?

234
00:13:00,686 --> 00:13:02,126
- Okay.

235
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:03,287
- [Zach] Okay.

236
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:07,029
- Wow, you have a kid.

237
00:13:09,717 --> 00:13:11,377
- Five year old son.

238
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:15,919
- What happened with his mom?

239
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:21,769
- I don't know, it just didn't work out.

240
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:27,869
- We've been drinking this
wine at this table for hours.

241
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:29,276
- Yeah, if we wanna go to the

242
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:31,141
exhibit we should probably leave now.

243
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:34,867
Unless you wanna just finish this one.

244
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:36,073
- Yes!

245
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:37,523
- Yeah?

246
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:39,141
Well maybe we shouldn't go tonight then,

247
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:42,007
maybe we should just, we
don't wanna be rushed.

248
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:44,049
- Yeah, when we go we're gonna wanna

249
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:47,469
take our time, look at all the paintings.

250
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:51,402
We probably don't have time tonight.

251
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:54,896
- Maybe we should get another bottle.

252
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,080
(chuckling)

253
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:56,906
Cheers.

254
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:59,283
- Whoa.

255
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:00,623
Watch it, buddy.

256
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,869
- [Zach] Well we can hang
out again soon, right?

257
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:09,167
- [Rebecca] Will you still take me

258
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:12,381
to the Hieronymus Bosch exhibit?

259
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:13,959
- [Zach] Of course.

260
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:23,279
Bye.

261
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:25,876
This kind of thing happens to everyone.

262
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,465
Even Jesus drank wine and spent time

263
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,626
with a hooker he didn't have sex with.

264
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:39,762
Yo.

265
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,755
Oh shit bro, don't worry.

266
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:43,652
- Zach, sorry man.

267
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:44,982
- It's all right.

268
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,010
- So I guess your five bottles
of wine plan didn't work.

269
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,682
- Dude, get me a drink
before this Crazy Eyes

270
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:51,803
bitch drives me permanently insane.

271
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:54,047
(chuckles)

272
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:59,884
Oh man, oh God, I need Crazy Eyes.

273
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:02,655
I gotta have Crazy Eyes dude,

274
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:06,179
I mean I will die without Crazy Eyes.

275
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:07,259
- [Dan] Yeah.

276
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:09,743
- What's Crazy Eyes?

277
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:12,949
I've never heard of that, can I get some?

278
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,563
- Crazy Eyes is this girl I took home

279
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:16,448
the other night and she made out with me

280
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:17,846
and then she slapped me and then she

281
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:20,274
talked about her boyfriend all night.

282
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,520
- And she wouldn't let
him have sex with her.

283
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,249
- What a tease.

284
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:25,864
- Yeah, and then I hung out with her again

285
00:15:25,862 --> 00:15:28,392
and she wouldn't have
sex with me then either.

286
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:30,979
- Dude, seriously, you
gotta stop over-tipping.

287
00:15:30,982 --> 00:15:33,822
- Fuck off buddy, I love you, bro.

288
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,149
- Hey Zach, have I ever told you

289
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:40,651
that I'm a lingerie designer?

290
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:42,144
- [Zach] No.

291
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:43,663
- Yeah, they're selling my lingerie

292
00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:46,413
at Barney's and Neiman Marcus and

293
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:51,428
I'm getting bigger and bigger orders.

294
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,260
- Great.

295
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:54,838
- Maybe I should come over to your

296
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:58,008
place and model them for you sometime.

297
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:00,078
- Yeah, okay.

298
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,704
Hey, you know what?

299
00:16:02,703 --> 00:16:05,113
Let's get a round of shots
too, what do you say?

300
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:06,191
- Sure, why not?

301
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:07,017
- You want a shot?

302
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,170
- Yeah, definitely.

303
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:10,382
- [Dan] Keep tipping like that,
you'll get shots all night.

304
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,723
- That's Dan "the man" Drake.

305
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,619
- Here you go, sweetie.

306
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,930
- [Autumn] Thank you.

307
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:14,758
- Cheers.

308
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:15,591
- [Zach] Cheers.

309
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:16,824
- [Autumn] Cheers, ole.

310
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:19,479
- [Dan] (laughs) Ole.

311
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:21,815
- [Zach] I'd never been
smart when it came to women,

312
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:23,709
but I knew enough to say that hooking up

313
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:25,487
with this girl would be darker than

314
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,790
getting trapped in a coalmine.

315
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:29,424
With her I'd probably wind up laying

316
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:32,838
my head on a railroad track a little bit.

317
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,020
(doorbell rings)

318
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,020
(doorbell rings)

319
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:18,723
(doorbell rings)

320
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:30,483
(doorbell rings)

321
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:31,308
The fuck?

322
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:38,627
- So?

323
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,360
Where's my little angel?!

324
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:41,968
- Yeah.

325
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:44,536
- No, I don't have him
'till Thanksgiving, mom.

326
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:47,132
- Well happy Thanksgiving, son.

327
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:58,214
- Whoa, you really do need
a woman's touch around here.

328
00:17:58,205 --> 00:17:59,035
- Mmmhm.

329
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:01,473
My mom's right, I should just

330
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:02,829
get back with my ex-wife, then

331
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:04,009
I'll only have to pay for one

332
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:05,823
house and one screeching bandit.

333
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:07,452
- [Ex] The rest of your fucking family!

334
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,573
And tell your father to get--

335
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:10,045
- Get in back, buddy.

336
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:11,923
Get in your seat.

337
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:14,711
Yeah, go fuck yourself, honey!

338
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:16,743
I can remember when
getting that shoe she just

339
00:18:16,737 --> 00:18:18,497
chucked at me like a skillet was the

340
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:20,323
most important thing in the world.

341
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,539
- Hey dad?

342
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:23,443
After mommy goes like that, how about

343
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,939
you just punch her in the nose?

344
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:27,603
- Well 'cause if I did that then men with

345
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,989
guns would come and put me in a cage.

346
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:30,821
- Oh.

347
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:33,931
Fuck you, grandpa.

348
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:37,373
Get out of here, motherfucker.

349
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:40,369
- Where did you learn those filthy words?

350
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,069
- Mommy threw shoes at us and screamed

351
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:46,342
you're crazy like your whole family.

352
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:47,184
- Oh.

353
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,620
(gun noises)

354
00:18:51,616 --> 00:18:52,866
- Are we crazy?

355
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:55,839
- (whispers) Do you understand the

356
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,169
long term psychological effect

357
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:58,348
of the absence of a father,

358
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:00,461
behaving like an adult parent?

359
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:01,576
- Mom.

360
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,263
- You know, it's not
really a religious holiday,

361
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:05,823
it's more of an acknowledgment
of a historical event.

362
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:07,185
No matter how you feel about the

363
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:09,353
colonization of America, it did happen

364
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:11,281
and we should acknowledge that.

365
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,089
Right, Big Chief?

366
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:13,937
Huh?

367
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:15,243
Oh!

368
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,549
Oh no.

369
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:19,461
(fake coughs)

370
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:20,815
(chuckling)

371
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:22,551
So we'll drop this crazy little Indian

372
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,650
off at his mama's house on our way home.

373
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:25,904
- Okay, thanks.

374
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:29,028
- You're shaking.

375
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,130
Your hand's been shaking like

376
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,217
a 90 year old's all day.

377
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:34,152
You always shake when
you've been drinking.

378
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,150
- [Zach] I haven't been
drinking that much, mom.

379
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:47,674
- You drunk drive like a faggot.

380
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:49,249
- [Dan] Oh shut up.

381
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:52,367
- [Autumn] Hey Zach!

382
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:54,755
- Hey man, guess who I brought?

383
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:59,017
- Yeah, well thanks, these are my parents.

384
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:01,371
- [Dan] Oh, guess we must...

385
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,866
This is definitely the wrong house, sorry.

386
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:07,793
- Hi, Dan Drake.

387
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:11,174
- [Rebecca] Oof!

388
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:13,122
- You're at the right
house, we were just leaving.

389
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:15,014
- Yes, come on, hun.

390
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,133
Let's go.

391
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,620
You take care, son.

392
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:19,308
- Hey, thanks for dinner.

393
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:20,217
- I'm okay.

394
00:20:21,074 --> 00:20:22,584
- It was nice.

395
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:23,408
- Bye, buddy.

396
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:24,801
- Have a good night.

397
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:26,992
Happy Thanksgiving.

398
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:30,066
- Come on, come on, (mumbles).

399
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:30,914
Come on.

400
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:35,874
(upbeat acoustic guitar music)

401
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:45,168
(muffled chatter)

402
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:52,851
- So what's your sign, Daniel?

403
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,571
- [Dan] I'm a Scorpio.

404
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:55,399
- Scorpio?

405
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:56,242
- Yeah.

406
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:57,325
- I love Scorpios.

407
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:58,462
- Really?

408
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,300
- Both of the loves of
my life were Scorpios.

409
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,130
- No shit.

410
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:09,354
- My bikini looks good here.

411
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,180
- Yeah.

412
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:11,173
- [Autumn] Right?

413
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:12,124
- Yeah, nice.

414
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:14,444
- [Autumn] Zach, can I do
my photoshoot in your house?

415
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:15,284
- Sure.

416
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:19,724
- Oh shit!

417
00:21:21,052 --> 00:21:22,662
Fuck.

418
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,366
Oh no, I have to put this back together.

419
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:25,418
- Do you need some help, or--

420
00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:28,504
- No, Rebecca, can you come inside please?

421
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:31,224
- [Rebecca] Yeah, sure.

422
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:32,824
I need a drink anyway.

423
00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:34,146
- [Autumn] Fuck.

424
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:43,164
- That's some fancy underwear.

425
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:44,319
- Yeah, if she had told me her

426
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,550
lingerie dissolved in water,

427
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:47,441
I would have invested immediately.

428
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,359
- [Dan] No shit, right?

429
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:51,905
She's pretty hot, huh?

430
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,411
- Yeah, she's hot.

431
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:58,744
- So what were you saying to Zach?

432
00:22:00,806 --> 00:22:02,386
- What?

433
00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:03,711
- I saw you talking to him and he

434
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:05,601
said you were saying crazy things to him.

435
00:22:05,598 --> 00:22:08,248
I wanna know what you were saying.

436
00:22:08,254 --> 00:22:10,984
- I wasn't saying crazy things to Zach.

437
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:13,212
Zach was saying crazy things to me.

438
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:14,214
- Like what?

439
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,750
- Whatever, he's a total
scumbag type of guy.

440
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,750
He is cute though, I could
see why you like him.

441
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,480
- Hey hey, little aardvarks.

442
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,879
- I have to pee.

443
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:35,959
- I wish I could disappear
without having to go outside.

444
00:22:40,363 --> 00:22:42,533
- I'll meet you out there.

445
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,373
- My plan was going
perfect except for the fact

446
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,991
that we're gonna die before
these bitches shut up.

447
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:58,107
(laughing)

448
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:58,941
Kampai.

449
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:08,583
- (laughs) Shut the fuck up.

450
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:10,065
You sure this isn't meth?

451
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,850
- Yeah man, it's good coke like always.

452
00:23:13,854 --> 00:23:15,554
I'll see you in a minute.

453
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,880
- Okay, see you.

454
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:20,556
(dramatic music)

455
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:28,038
(urinating)

456
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:29,368
- Hey.

457
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,616
- Hey yourself.

458
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:45,316
- [Rebecca] No no no.

459
00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:47,277
Yes yes yes yes.

460
00:23:47,277 --> 00:23:48,107
No no no.

461
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:49,955
Yes.

462
00:23:58,325 --> 00:23:59,555
Don't.

463
00:23:59,557 --> 00:24:02,337
This is my butt, that's your butt.

464
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,951
You're wearing expensive
underwear and I'm not.

465
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:06,402
- These aren't expensive?

466
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:09,221
- No, mine are working class.

467
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:12,214
- Well I like your
little working class ass.

468
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,490
- Where's Autumn and Dan Drake at?

469
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:16,908
- I don't think they're coming back.

470
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:18,062
Come here.

471
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:19,201
- No.

472
00:24:19,197 --> 00:24:22,177
- (laughs) Come on.

473
00:24:22,182 --> 00:24:23,022
Whatever.

474
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:37,414
- No, I can't.

475
00:24:37,407 --> 00:24:40,347
I don't (mumbles) for
anything, I'm too drunk.

476
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,680
I'm like a drunk robot with no feelings.

477
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:47,043
(grunts)

478
00:25:15,345 --> 00:25:17,505
(moaning)

479
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:21,735
Ow.

480
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:23,671
Ow, fuck.

481
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:30,053
I need something.

482
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,121
Do you have some Vicodin?

483
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:41,776
- So we're finally gonna go
to the Bosch exhibit today?

484
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:50,782
Forgot how much I like to cook.

485
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,098
I used to cook so much
for my ex-wife that...

486
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:56,556
(phone rings)

487
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,140
Speak of the devil.

488
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:04,126
Hello?

489
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:05,417
- [Ex] Hey.

490
00:26:05,423 --> 00:26:07,583
I'm sorry about the other day.

491
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,470
I'm just having a really hard time

492
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,518
dealing with the holidays by myself.

493
00:26:11,524 --> 00:26:14,014
- What about that surfer
guy you were going with?

494
00:26:14,012 --> 00:26:16,082
- [Ex] He moved out.

495
00:26:16,084 --> 00:26:17,674
- You're single again?

496
00:26:17,668 --> 00:26:18,498
- Yeah.

497
00:26:20,508 --> 00:26:23,398
And I'm having a really hard time.

498
00:26:23,396 --> 00:26:25,866
- Yeah, I know the feeling.

499
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:28,878
- I need a little bit more money.

500
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:30,174
You stopped giving me as much

501
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,971
because he was living with me, right?

502
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:35,661
- Yeah, I think that had
something to do with it.

503
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:38,389
- I live alone again
and I was wondering if

504
00:26:38,387 --> 00:26:42,277
you can give me as much
as you gave me before.

505
00:26:42,275 --> 00:26:44,145
- I guess so.

506
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:46,747
- Well can you call your lawyers?

507
00:26:46,747 --> 00:26:48,977
I really don't wanna talk to them anymore.

508
00:26:48,979 --> 00:26:50,619
- Yeah, fine.

509
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:51,959
- [Ex] Thank you.

510
00:26:51,963 --> 00:26:53,583
- How's the little guy?

511
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:54,578
- He's okay.

512
00:26:56,091 --> 00:26:57,541
I gave his dog away.

513
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,029
- I thought we agreed that you'd

514
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,594
take the dog to obedience school.

515
00:27:01,594 --> 00:27:03,674
- [Ex] Yeah, but I just
figured that if I get

516
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,436
him another one right
away it's gonna be fine.

517
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:09,562
- That's one way to look at it.

518
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:11,888
I gotta go, I got something on the stove.

519
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:13,347
- [Ex] Okay, bye.

520
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,920
- [Zach] Every time I hang up the phone

521
00:27:14,918 --> 00:27:16,458
I know she's about to
eat some vegan bread and

522
00:27:16,461 --> 00:27:20,601
then fuck some surfer
dude with a ponytail.

523
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,818
So you still wanna go to the

524
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:24,571
Hieronymus Bosch exhibit tonight?

525
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:33,429
- I might be in love with somebody else.

526
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:35,099
His name's Vladimir.

527
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:37,621
I think I'm in love with him.

528
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:39,101
I'm gonna check.

529
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:40,351
I should check.

530
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:42,867
- Oh yeah?

531
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:46,533
How you gonna do that?

532
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:49,873
- Well first I'm going to shave my legs.

533
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:56,649
Then I'm gonna shave my whole body.

534
00:27:56,652 --> 00:27:59,652
Then I'm going to drive to his place

535
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:05,675
and I'm going to knock on the door.

536
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,429
I'm gonna sit on the couch and then

537
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:10,103
I'm just gonna see what happens.

538
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:15,075
- When are you gonna do this?

539
00:28:16,385 --> 00:28:17,985
- Right now.

540
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,490
(jazzy music)

541
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:32,472
- [Dan] I fucked the hell
out of that girl, dude.

542
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:34,746
I fucked the hell out of her!

543
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,906
Brought her up to the park with the grass,

544
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:38,273
you know, the jacket on the grass,

545
00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:39,973
laid her down on the jacket.

546
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,390
Fucking went to town, dude.

547
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:42,865
Went to fucking town, I was putting

548
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:46,475
red welts on her ass,
she's calling me daddy.

549
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,630
Classy, I mean my plan worked, bro.

550
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:52,003
- That was not classy, man.

551
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:54,241
All they want is money, those girls.

552
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:57,081
I mean they drive me
crazy, they're insane.

553
00:28:57,081 --> 00:28:58,581
Everybody's crazy.

554
00:28:59,665 --> 00:29:01,265
We're crazy.

555
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,353
You're fucking crazy.

556
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:05,922
- I love 'em all, man.

557
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,210
I love 'em all.

558
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,628
- [Zach] What, you love all what?

559
00:29:08,632 --> 00:29:09,792
- Girls man, I just wanna fuck

560
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:12,632
'em all, I wanna fuck whole towns!

561
00:29:13,592 --> 00:29:15,662
- I suck at this game.

562
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:16,934
Not playing this anymore.

563
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,598
I gotta make a call.

564
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:26,052
- [Dan] Hey, folks, what's up?

565
00:29:28,831 --> 00:29:31,331
(phone rings)

566
00:29:35,285 --> 00:29:36,115
- Hello?

567
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:37,608
- [Zach] Hi.

568
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:39,373
I wanted to talk to you about something,

569
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:41,116
I wanted to see if...

570
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:46,655
You want to get together sometime?

571
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:49,081
Just the two of us, you know?

572
00:29:50,017 --> 00:29:52,297
Have dinner or something?

573
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,190
- Are you drunk?

574
00:29:54,188 --> 00:29:55,768
- Not really.

575
00:29:55,773 --> 00:30:00,253
- [Rebecca] Well it sounds
like you've been drinking.

576
00:30:00,252 --> 00:30:02,672
- Well you wanna have dinner?

577
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:05,928
- I'm sorry, Zach.

578
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:12,421
- Okay.

579
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,173
- [Rebecca] I'm sorry.

580
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:22,925
- It's okay.

581
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:29,257
(police sirens wailing)

582
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:33,341
(dramatic acoustic guitar music)

583
00:30:37,228 --> 00:30:40,848
Money is a medium that can
be exchanged for services.

584
00:30:40,853 --> 00:30:42,603
It has no real value.

585
00:30:43,612 --> 00:30:46,242
Really, it's just paper.

586
00:30:46,243 --> 00:30:48,743
One day it will all good poof.

587
00:30:50,403 --> 00:30:53,993
- You gave one, two,
$300 for those drinks.

588
00:31:04,675 --> 00:31:07,445
- All of you can kiss
my ass and suck my dick.

589
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,480
- [Voiceover] Dude.

590
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:11,775
- [Zach] You heard me,
suck my fucking dick.

591
00:31:11,783 --> 00:31:14,093
Give me more shots, bro.

592
00:31:14,094 --> 00:31:15,754
And get the fuck outta here Bob.

593
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,060
I don't need you looming over me.

594
00:31:19,062 --> 00:31:22,902
- You are (mumbles) it today.

595
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:29,034
- [Zach] Would I know if I was in Hell?

596
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:33,782
Or would things just
start looking like Hell?

597
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:38,446
It was all red at the bar that night.

598
00:31:38,448 --> 00:31:40,118
And full of whorees.

599
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:44,864
I caught the reflection of a Kraken,

600
00:31:47,397 --> 00:31:51,827
up from the deep, out
of the corner of my eye.

601
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,516
Give me another beer and another shot.

602
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:54,952
- Whoa, don't talk to me like a

603
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,964
dog when I'm serving you, bro.

604
00:31:57,955 --> 00:31:59,865
- Give me a fucking beer, bro!

605
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:02,934
- [Dan] You've had enough beer.

606
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,910
- Fucking I knew it.

607
00:32:04,914 --> 00:32:06,934
You guys don't love me.

608
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,150
Nobody, neither of you guys love me,

609
00:32:09,145 --> 00:32:12,515
fucking all you want is my fucking money.

610
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:16,641
You're trying to get me killed Bob, right?

611
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:18,291
Huh?

612
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:20,699
- Take the night off,
drive him home, give him

613
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:23,397
his medication, he's
obviously freaking out.

614
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:26,101
- [Zach] Nobody's taking
me home and drugging me!

615
00:32:26,097 --> 00:32:27,337
- Dude, you know what, he's right.

616
00:32:27,337 --> 00:32:29,387
You obviously have had too much to drink.

617
00:32:29,385 --> 00:32:30,965
I'm gonna call you a cab,
you're gonna go home,

618
00:32:30,969 --> 00:32:32,779
and you're gonna sleep it off, okay?

619
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,284
- You don't love me.

620
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,110
- We--

621
00:32:35,113 --> 00:32:36,493
- You don't fucking love me.

622
00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:37,779
Give me another beer.

623
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:38,607
- [Dan] No.

624
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,260
- Dan is your best
friend, you have another

625
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:41,854
beer that you're squeezing in your hand

626
00:32:41,848 --> 00:32:44,748
right there, and nobody
is trying to kill you.

627
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:46,362
- [Zach] Fuck you, man!

628
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,190
- Oh really?

629
00:32:47,193 --> 00:32:50,783
- Fuck, you're on Viagra,
and Dan Drake sells cocaine!

630
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:52,146
- What the fuck?

631
00:32:52,152 --> 00:32:52,992
Chill!

632
00:32:52,985 --> 00:32:54,285
(glass shatters)

633
00:32:54,285 --> 00:32:56,175
- [Bob] Stop it, stop it!

634
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:57,389
(glass shatters)

635
00:32:57,388 --> 00:32:58,768
That's it, that's enough.

636
00:32:58,771 --> 00:32:59,991
- Get outta here!
- That's enough.

637
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:00,899
- [Zach] Let go of me!

638
00:33:00,904 --> 00:33:02,194
- [Bob] Come on, get outta here.

639
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:03,777
- Fucking assholes!

640
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,611
- [Dan] Wait out here for the cab.

641
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:10,433
(door slams)

642
00:33:16,837 --> 00:33:18,237
- [Zach] I feel like I'm swinging

643
00:33:18,244 --> 00:33:21,974
high up in the rigging of a tossing ship.

644
00:33:21,972 --> 00:33:23,562
I must've been hit.

645
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,020
I must've been beaten up,
but I don't remember it.

646
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,450
Why can't I wake up?

647
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:33,203
I need another drink.

648
00:33:34,284 --> 00:33:36,524
I need another drink.

649
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:40,306
I tried to drown the monsters,
but they learned to swim.

650
00:33:40,308 --> 00:33:42,848
(mumbles) serpents.

651
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:44,423
Crazy Eyes.

652
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,500
(toy dinosaur roars)

653
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,903
- Dad, wake up.

654
00:33:51,827 --> 00:33:53,437
Let's fight monsters.

655
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:55,733
(toy dinosaur roars)

656
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:56,821
Wake up.

657
00:33:56,819 --> 00:33:58,799
Fight monsters.

658
00:33:58,795 --> 00:34:01,845
- Sorry buddy, I can't
fight monsters right now.

659
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:02,851
- [Max] Why?

660
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,470
- Because I'm just too tired
to fight these monsters.

661
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:09,217
- Dad, what happened?

662
00:34:14,714 --> 00:34:17,564
- I guess I was already fighting monsters.

663
00:34:17,562 --> 00:34:20,112
Maybe that's why I'm so tired.

664
00:34:20,114 --> 00:34:21,284
- Did you win?

665
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,790
- [Zach] Not quite.

666
00:34:24,787 --> 00:34:28,287
- We should fight them together, dad.

667
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,120
Wake up.

668
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,220
- Go play with your nanny.

669
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,310
(dramatic music)

670
00:34:48,707 --> 00:34:50,727
Did you beat me up last night?

671
00:34:50,732 --> 00:34:51,652
- [Dan] No.

672
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:56,932
- Well what happened
to my arm and my chest?

673
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,810
- What happened is you're batshit crazy

674
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,966
and you beat the fuck out of yourself.

675
00:35:03,592 --> 00:35:05,562
- Okay, I believe you.

676
00:35:05,556 --> 00:35:06,556
- Thank you.

677
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,890
- I only had nine drinks.

678
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:17,309
- A beer and a shot nine times?

679
00:35:17,306 --> 00:35:18,716
That's 18 drinks.

680
00:35:20,706 --> 00:35:21,536
- Oh man.

681
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:26,836
- Your mom says you're drinking too much.

682
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:33,541
Sign right here.

683
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:36,389
How's the kid?

684
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:38,361
- Good.

685
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:42,015
- [Voiceover] How many
thousands of dollars'

686
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:46,418
worth of cereal can a
kid that age really eat?

687
00:35:46,419 --> 00:35:48,269
When women like your ex get divorced,

688
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:50,346
they think they're
gonna become bag ladies.

689
00:35:50,354 --> 00:35:51,824
She's not gonna become a bad lady,

690
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:55,988
she'll always find someone
to buy her a $1,500 handbag.

691
00:35:58,186 --> 00:35:59,186
- That's it.

692
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:02,786
- [Voiceover] That's it.

693
00:36:07,594 --> 00:36:08,874
- Oh no, don't worry about it.

694
00:36:08,874 --> 00:36:10,034
- Nah, I mean come on.

695
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:11,675
- No I'm serious, your
money's no good here.

696
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:12,831
Call me in the morning, let's go for

697
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:14,735
a run if you can still
handle it, all right?

698
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:16,967
- Okay, I'm down.

699
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:18,529
Suddenly I felt like a normal guy

700
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,880
just having a drink with my buddies

701
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:22,301
and waiting on my sweetheart.

702
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:26,259
(moaning)

703
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,283
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

704
00:36:39,152 --> 00:36:40,992
Yeah, yeah, pull back!

705
00:36:44,216 --> 00:36:48,126
(gentle acoustic guitar music)

706
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,271
(vomiting)

707
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:19,172
- Heads up.

708
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,167
Crazy Eyes, six o'clock.

709
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:28,203
- So did you shave your whole body?

710
00:37:28,197 --> 00:37:30,787
- No, I chickened out.

711
00:37:30,788 --> 00:37:34,158
I went home and got drunk instead.

712
00:37:34,156 --> 00:37:35,566
- Sounds healthy.

713
00:37:36,444 --> 00:37:37,844
- Mmmhm.

714
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:39,764
- Let me buy you a drink.

715
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:40,586
Dan!

716
00:37:44,964 --> 00:37:48,214
- [Rebecca] Did we have sex last night?

717
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:52,744
- [Zach] No, are you joking?

718
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:53,569
- No.

719
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,920
- You made me stop.

720
00:37:58,918 --> 00:38:00,538
- [Rebecca] Oh.

721
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:01,979
- [Zach] Yeah.

722
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:02,809
- Sorry.

723
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:05,771
- [Zach] Yeah, it's okay.

724
00:38:07,563 --> 00:38:08,403
Whatever.

725
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:13,671
(phone rings)

726
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:19,671
Hello?

727
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:21,997
- Zach, I'm in the hospital.

728
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:25,207
Your father's had a stroke.

729
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,960
(dramatic music)

730
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:35,542
- How's he doing?

731
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:38,008
- [Voiceover] They think
he's gonna be all right.

732
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,800
I found him crawling around on the kitchen

733
00:38:39,802 --> 00:38:43,052
floor vomiting and speaking in tongues.

734
00:38:47,802 --> 00:38:50,392
(techno music)

735
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:01,724
- These margaritas are okay, but my uncle

736
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:03,591
owns this bar in the valley and he

737
00:39:03,585 --> 00:39:06,415
makes the best margarita mix ever.

738
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:09,101
He's world famous for it.

739
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:09,977
- Really?

740
00:39:09,977 --> 00:39:11,387
- [Autumn] Mmmhm.

741
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:16,453
My God, Zach, I have
totally got to get you some.

742
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,120
I mean you would really love it.

743
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:23,917
- Yeah, I like margaritas too.

744
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:27,928
- Yeah, you can tell a lot about

745
00:39:27,928 --> 00:39:30,428
a person from what they drink.

746
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,680
- Get off of me.

747
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,980
- No.

748
00:39:40,984 --> 00:39:42,324
- Get off of me.

749
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:51,073
You can't unless you choke
me until I'm unconscious.

750
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:54,267
- Will you let me fuck you if I

751
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:57,531
choke you until you're unconscious?

752
00:39:57,534 --> 00:39:59,054
- That's the only way.

753
00:39:59,046 --> 00:39:59,876
- Okay.

754
00:40:01,992 --> 00:40:06,162
Turn on your side so it
doesn't hurt you when I do it.

755
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:16,541
(coughing)

756
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:24,909
Aw, we're wasted.

757
00:40:24,906 --> 00:40:27,026
(coughing)

758
00:40:27,026 --> 00:40:28,606
This is a bad idea.

759
00:40:29,706 --> 00:40:32,606
What if you didn't wake up?

760
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:34,258
(gasps)

761
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:35,086
- Fuck.

762
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,470
- Oh God.

763
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:39,701
- Oh God.

764
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:44,442
- (groans) Fuck, I'm so hungover.

765
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:47,539
- I'm not even hungover, I'm still drunk.

766
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:50,553
I slept in my contacts
and my eyes are all goopy,

767
00:40:50,552 --> 00:40:54,302
and fuck, my whole day
is wasted, I'm wasted.

768
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:01,576
- So what are you doing today?

769
00:41:04,317 --> 00:41:05,837
- Nothing.

770
00:41:05,836 --> 00:41:10,766
We slept until four in the
afternoon and I'm still drunk.

771
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:12,362
- Maybe we could finally catch

772
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:14,863
that Hieronymus Bosch exhibit.

773
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:24,851
- [Rebecca] Stop trying to
grab my hair and ride me.

774
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:25,841
- [Zach] Woo woo!

775
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:26,795
- [Rebecca] Let go of me.

776
00:41:26,803 --> 00:41:27,803
- [Zach] Yeehaw!

777
00:41:27,804 --> 00:41:29,724
- [Rebecca] Get off me!

778
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:33,365
- Zach's rich right?

779
00:41:35,573 --> 00:41:37,323
- Yeah, yeah, he's...

780
00:41:39,053 --> 00:41:40,643
He's a millionaire.

781
00:41:42,637 --> 00:41:45,787
- [Autumn] I wish I could
just be Zach's wife.

782
00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:46,829
- [Voiceover] Whenever you're ready.

783
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:48,329
- [Dan] Thank you.

784
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,191
I got this one.

785
00:41:53,997 --> 00:41:58,157
- Leave a big tip 'cause I
plan on coming back here.

786
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:01,672
- [Voiceover] Turn left in 300 yards.

787
00:42:01,668 --> 00:42:03,978
- Hey, what are you
doing, I said go straight.

788
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,290
Why are you listening to that bitch again?

789
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:08,242
- I'm just trying to go to the bar.

790
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:09,296
- [Rebecca] Well take your pick,

791
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:12,811
you wanna listen to that bitch or to me?

792
00:42:12,812 --> 00:42:15,242
(chuckles)

793
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:16,644
- [Zach] I don't know.

794
00:42:16,644 --> 00:42:19,554
(phone rings)

795
00:42:19,548 --> 00:42:21,058
- What?

796
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:22,949
- [Voiceover] Hey baby,
what are you doing?

797
00:42:22,948 --> 00:42:25,748
- Zach was just taking me to
the Hieronymus Bosch exhibit,

798
00:42:25,747 --> 00:42:27,077
but now we're just gonna go to

799
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:29,914
the bar and get drunk instead.

800
00:42:29,908 --> 00:42:32,838
- This guy is a total dick.

801
00:42:32,835 --> 00:42:35,555
You tell him that I'm
gonna kick his fucking ass.

802
00:42:35,563 --> 00:42:37,443
(giggles)

803
00:42:37,443 --> 00:42:40,363
- [Rebecca] I'm not gonna tell him that.

804
00:42:40,355 --> 00:42:42,265
I'll talk to you later.

805
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:46,069
- Who was that?

806
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:52,832
- My boyfriend, he says
he's gonna kick your ass.

807
00:42:52,826 --> 00:42:54,656
That's all, no biggie.

808
00:42:57,186 --> 00:42:59,346
Don't worry about a thing.

809
00:43:08,717 --> 00:43:10,717
- I think mold did this.

810
00:43:12,061 --> 00:43:15,141
I think even here there's black mold.

811
00:43:21,805 --> 00:43:22,635
- Zach.

812
00:43:25,484 --> 00:43:26,324
Zach.

813
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,560
Oh, there you are.

814
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:37,292
Hey, let's get out of this fucking place.

815
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:38,542
This bed sucks.

816
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,650
I'm tied down.

817
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,650
Why, why am I tied down?

818
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:51,006
What is this place, Thailand?

819
00:43:51,011 --> 00:43:55,011
- Dad, you had a stroke,
you're in the hospital.

820
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,749
- Really?

821
00:43:58,754 --> 00:43:59,594
- Yeah.

822
00:44:05,746 --> 00:44:06,826
- Was it bad?

823
00:44:09,301 --> 00:44:11,131
- Well it wasn't good.

824
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,493
- There's a lump behind me.

825
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:17,415
There's something behind me.

826
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,571
- It's a tube, they put
a tube in your back.

827
00:44:19,565 --> 00:44:21,915
- I think it's a dead body.

828
00:44:21,924 --> 00:44:24,874
Yeah, they got me tied to a dead body.

829
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:27,129
Your mother did this to me.

830
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:30,222
(toy dinosaur roars)

831
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,050
- Godzilla isn't real, but God is.

832
00:44:38,924 --> 00:44:40,674
- [Zach] Who told you that?

833
00:44:40,668 --> 00:44:41,918
- I don't know.

834
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:47,156
- Who told you God is real?

835
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:50,884
- No one dad, no one
told me that God is real.

836
00:44:50,884 --> 00:44:52,664
- Okay, good.

837
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:54,249
'Cause it's not true.

838
00:44:54,252 --> 00:44:57,702
- I know, but many people believe it is.

839
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:00,999
- [Zach] Yeah, but many people are stupid.

840
00:45:00,995 --> 00:45:01,985
Okay?

841
00:45:01,987 --> 00:45:02,957
You know that?

842
00:45:02,956 --> 00:45:03,786
- Yeah.

843
00:45:04,843 --> 00:45:07,263
(rock music)

844
00:45:27,654 --> 00:45:30,494
(playful humming)

845
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:35,964
(phone rings)

846
00:45:35,963 --> 00:45:38,193
- Is that your son's mom?

847
00:45:38,187 --> 00:45:39,347
- No, Latisha.

848
00:45:41,091 --> 00:45:45,001
- Ugh, psycho ex-girlfriend, even worse.

849
00:45:45,003 --> 00:45:48,493
- Yeah, I'm not gonna answer it.

850
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:51,961
- Why don't you just turn your phone off?

851
00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:54,362
- Can't, what if it's an
emergency with my son?

852
00:45:54,362 --> 00:45:55,882
My dad's in the ICU.

853
00:45:55,882 --> 00:45:58,382
(phone rings)

854
00:46:00,418 --> 00:46:02,258
- She's fucking crazy!

855
00:46:02,258 --> 00:46:03,658
- I know.

856
00:46:03,658 --> 00:46:06,158
(phone rings)

857
00:46:08,178 --> 00:46:09,768
- [Voiceover] You can't
just show up here and

858
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,130
fuck me whenever you
want and them just leave.

859
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,730
- I love this show.

860
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,510
(laughing)

861
00:46:16,514 --> 00:46:19,014
(phone rings)

862
00:46:23,138 --> 00:46:25,308
- We might need an escape.

863
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,941
- You wanna go get a drink?

864
00:46:28,937 --> 00:46:31,097
- Yeah, sounds good.

865
00:46:31,097 --> 00:46:34,257
- Let's to go the bar, I need a drink.

866
00:46:35,995 --> 00:46:36,825
Psycho.

867
00:46:39,689 --> 00:46:41,739
Hey I gotta pee, will
you order me a Rebecca?

868
00:46:41,737 --> 00:46:42,567
- Okay.

869
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:53,112
- Zach my man, hey, what's happening, bro?

870
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,010
- [Zach] Plenty.

871
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:55,244
- Hey, Latisha's been calling me

872
00:46:55,238 --> 00:46:57,608
burning up the phone
lines asking about you.

873
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,226
Girl's crazy dude, she's driving me nuts.

874
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,090
- Crazy Eyes needs a vanilla
Stoli with ginger ale.

875
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:03,456
- No, she doesn't need a vanilla Stoli.

876
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:05,632
- Yeah yeah, she needs a Rebecca.

877
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,570
- [Dan] A Rebecca?

878
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,074
I've never even heard of a Rebecca,

879
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,160
it's a stupid, gross drink.

880
00:47:10,157 --> 00:47:12,567
- Dude, you gotta make the girl a Rebecca,

881
00:47:12,565 --> 00:47:15,025
she asked me to get one with cherry.

882
00:47:15,029 --> 00:47:17,129
- I'm not doing that shit for you.

883
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:20,133
- [Zach] What are you talking about?

884
00:47:23,213 --> 00:47:24,583
- Dan Drake, will you do me a favor

885
00:47:24,582 --> 00:47:28,412
and put extra extra cherries in mine?

886
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:29,653
- Yeah.

887
00:47:29,645 --> 00:47:30,645
- Thank you.

888
00:47:31,741 --> 00:47:33,241
- I need to get the hell outta here,

889
00:47:33,237 --> 00:47:35,357
man, I need to escape from this place.

890
00:47:35,364 --> 00:47:37,174
- We just got here.

891
00:47:37,172 --> 00:47:41,342
- No, I mean LA, I can't stand LA anymore.

892
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,390
- Where are we to go to?

893
00:47:43,389 --> 00:47:44,859
- I don't know.

894
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,890
Maybe New York.

895
00:47:46,892 --> 00:47:48,812
You wanna come with me?

896
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:50,889
- Really?

897
00:47:50,887 --> 00:47:52,227
- Yeah.

898
00:47:52,225 --> 00:47:53,055
- Yay!

899
00:47:53,058 --> 00:47:53,888
Cheers!

900
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:55,141
- Cheers.

901
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,485
- Yay.

902
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:57,897
- You can get off work and everything?

903
00:47:57,903 --> 00:47:59,103
- Yeah.

904
00:47:59,103 --> 00:48:00,323
Let's get belligerent.

905
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:01,898
- Let's get wasted.

906
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:04,045
- Yeah.

907
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:11,789
- You're a total dick, man.

908
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,291
You shook my hand and you immediately

909
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:15,857
tried to fuck my girlfriend.

910
00:48:15,862 --> 00:48:17,792
- No no, what I did was I shook your

911
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:20,812
hand and then I did fuck your girlfriend.

912
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:24,894
(girl shrieks)
(glass breaks)

913
00:48:24,887 --> 00:48:26,027
- [Zach] Get him, Dan!

914
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:26,874
Get him!

915
00:48:29,322 --> 00:48:31,072
Give him another one!

916
00:48:34,776 --> 00:48:36,936
- Stay down, motherfucker!

917
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:40,989
- [Zach] I don't care what
people say about Dan Drake.

918
00:48:40,993 --> 00:48:44,413
He's my friend and a genuine good person.

919
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:50,145
Whatever, it's all just
whisky under the bridge.

920
00:48:50,152 --> 00:48:51,422
- Come on, stop it!

921
00:48:51,424 --> 00:48:53,224
Come on, stop it, stop
it, get him outta here!

922
00:48:53,216 --> 00:48:54,266
Take him outta here!

923
00:48:54,273 --> 00:48:55,253
Get him out!

924
00:48:55,248 --> 00:48:56,408
Come on!

925
00:48:56,408 --> 00:48:57,738
- Fucking idiot.

926
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,600
- [Dan] This is my bar!

927
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:12,251
(phone rings)

928
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:19,779
- I thought I told you
not to call me anymore.

929
00:49:19,783 --> 00:49:22,373
- I want your dick in my mouth.

930
00:49:23,279 --> 00:49:26,229
- It's 4:30 in the morning.

931
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:29,559
- I just want your dick so bad it hurts.

932
00:49:35,044 --> 00:49:35,884
- Rebecca.

933
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:38,438
Rebecca, you up?

934
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:45,281
Okay.

935
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:48,339
My dick's in your mouth.

936
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,043
Yeah, what do you do?

937
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:54,196
(moaning)

938
00:49:59,075 --> 00:50:01,575
(dog whining)

939
00:50:05,499 --> 00:50:08,209
(whispers) Oh yeah, nice little pussy.

940
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:11,250
- [Latisha] I wanna feel
your cum dripping out of me.

941
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,000
(dramatic music)

942
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:26,506
- Dad, you know my grandpa
with the really old face?

943
00:50:26,506 --> 00:50:27,496
- Yeah.

944
00:50:27,498 --> 00:50:28,328
- He died.

945
00:50:29,546 --> 00:50:31,576
- No, your grandfather, he is very

946
00:50:31,578 --> 00:50:33,158
sick and he's in the hospital,

947
00:50:33,162 --> 00:50:34,632
but he isn't dead, I just talked

948
00:50:34,633 --> 00:50:37,423
to him today, he didn't die.

949
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:38,247
- He died.

950
00:50:40,257 --> 00:50:42,167
- No, I don't think so.

951
00:50:44,289 --> 00:50:46,719
- I know dad, I'm just kidding.

952
00:50:46,717 --> 00:50:48,717
But he's gonna die soon.

953
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:52,109
- Yeah, well, you know...

954
00:50:53,765 --> 00:50:56,465
Eventually everybody dies, buddy.

955
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:58,049
- Everybody?

956
00:50:58,053 --> 00:50:59,333
Even you?

957
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:00,172
Even me?

958
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,880
- Yeah, everybody.

959
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,910
- When we die, how do we go?

960
00:51:07,908 --> 00:51:09,158
- Nobody knows.

961
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,760
I'm going to New York, but it's
just for the weekend, okay?

962
00:51:16,764 --> 00:51:18,394
- I just want you to have as close

963
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:21,490
a bond with your son as possible.

964
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:23,514
- Mom, it's for the weekend.

965
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,260
Max is gonna be fine.

966
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:30,384
- I'm so worried about him.

967
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:34,742
- Who are you worried
about, dad or my son?

968
00:51:34,741 --> 00:51:36,781
- All three of you.

969
00:51:36,781 --> 00:51:40,311
I just, I just don't have the words.

970
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:43,409
- Jack, Jack, I'm in Puerto Rico.

971
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:45,483
(chuckles) There was some colorful

972
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,567
birds in my room the other day.

973
00:51:47,565 --> 00:51:49,895
- All the men in my life are leaving me.

974
00:51:49,904 --> 00:51:51,104
- You're not a good ex-husband.

975
00:51:51,095 --> 00:51:52,265
- I want your dick in my mouth.

976
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:55,350
- I wish I could just be Zach's wife.

977
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,070
- God.

978
00:51:58,462 --> 00:52:00,852
- Fucking Autumn, man.

979
00:52:00,846 --> 00:52:02,656
Always bitching about getting too old,

980
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:06,202
not having enough money,
she needs more money.

981
00:52:06,198 --> 00:52:07,408
- Really?

982
00:52:07,414 --> 00:52:10,874
I thought she was a lingerie designer.

983
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,540
- Lingerie designer?

984
00:52:13,385 --> 00:52:16,375
There's no such thing as
a lingerie designer, man.

985
00:52:16,377 --> 00:52:17,587
It's just a string that goes up

986
00:52:17,585 --> 00:52:20,835
your ass and it's either black or pink.

987
00:52:22,857 --> 00:52:23,687
- God.

988
00:52:25,481 --> 00:52:27,151
These fucking women.

989
00:52:29,297 --> 00:52:30,127
I mean...

990
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:34,783
That's all they want.

991
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,673
That is all they want!

992
00:52:39,057 --> 00:52:43,207
I mean I just can't take it anymore, man!

993
00:52:43,209 --> 00:52:46,889
I just can't fucking take it anymore!

994
00:52:46,888 --> 00:52:49,348
I'm fucking sick of this shit, man!

995
00:52:49,352 --> 00:52:51,572
I can't take these fucking girls!

996
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:55,038
- Whoa, what is it
about this intersection?

997
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,400
You always flip out about chicks

998
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,100
at this same intersection?

999
00:52:58,104 --> 00:52:59,404
- Do I always do that here?

1000
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,140
- [Dan] Yeah you do,
every time for a year now.

1001
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:04,406
- I don't know, I think it's that

1002
00:53:04,405 --> 00:53:07,065
weird pink building right there.

1003
00:53:08,069 --> 00:53:10,809
- Yup, pink like pussy.

1004
00:53:10,814 --> 00:53:13,064
(laughing)

1005
00:53:15,821 --> 00:53:18,241
- I just can't go on anymore.

1006
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:21,513
(sobs) Oh God.

1007
00:53:21,505 --> 00:53:23,335
- Whoa, what do you mean
you can't go on, dude?

1008
00:53:23,344 --> 00:53:24,624
Wait, hold on, whoa, Zach, you can't

1009
00:53:24,624 --> 00:53:25,744
just stop in the middle
(car honks)

1010
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:27,146
of thinks man, you're driving here.

1011
00:53:27,152 --> 00:53:29,172
- [Voiceover] Hey move
your fucking car, man!

1012
00:53:29,168 --> 00:53:30,818
- My heart.

1013
00:53:30,824 --> 00:53:34,784
My heart feels like it's wiggling around.

1014
00:53:34,776 --> 00:53:39,616
- Yeah, I'm sure it probably
does feel all wiggly.

1015
00:53:39,624 --> 00:53:40,464
- Fuck.

1016
00:53:42,768 --> 00:53:44,308
Man, I need a drink.

1017
00:53:44,312 --> 00:53:45,152
- [Dan] Yeah?

1018
00:53:45,145 --> 00:53:45,975
- I need a drink.

1019
00:53:45,978 --> 00:53:47,058
- Okay, what?

1020
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:50,601
- I need a bar.

1021
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:52,093
- [Dan] Are you all right?

1022
00:53:52,091 --> 00:53:53,891
- [Zach] I gotta get out of this town.

1023
00:53:53,886 --> 00:53:55,466
I gotta go to New York.

1024
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,390
Some struggle fuck,
some corner fuck, I even

1025
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:01,560
know a guy who swears
by the surround fuck.

1026
00:54:01,558 --> 00:54:04,358
But all that's just old
line in new bottles.

1027
00:54:04,358 --> 00:54:06,768
My technique, the New York fuck,

1028
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:09,086
never fails because what's more romantic

1029
00:54:09,093 --> 00:54:11,163
than flying her to New York, getting her

1030
00:54:11,157 --> 00:54:12,757
drunk, and taking her on a horsey ride

1031
00:54:12,758 --> 00:54:15,238
right down the middle of Times Square?

1032
00:54:15,237 --> 00:54:19,067
(jazzy acoustic guitar music)

1033
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:47,411
Well if there's anything I
can do to help, let me know.

1034
00:54:48,717 --> 00:54:50,967
- Buy me a house in Venice.

1035
00:54:53,317 --> 00:54:54,167
Eh?

1036
00:54:54,172 --> 00:54:55,182
(chuckles)

1037
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,010
Come on.

1038
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,930
- If you started having sex with me,

1039
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:02,585
then maybe I'll buy you a house.

1040
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:06,188
- It would be bad sex.

1041
00:55:07,645 --> 00:55:08,895
- I don't care.

1042
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:11,920
- I'm not a whore.

1043
00:55:12,948 --> 00:55:14,858
- It wouldn't be prostitution.

1044
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,030
I mean we're really close.

1045
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:22,938
I think it would actually be
really natural and loving.

1046
00:55:22,941 --> 00:55:26,561
Whores fuck people they don't even know.

1047
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:30,056
- I fuck people I don't even know.

1048
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,679
- Well then you're a whore already.

1049
00:55:32,683 --> 00:55:35,273
(jazzy music)

1050
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,270
(loud knocking)

1051
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:50,748
- Hey.

1052
00:55:50,749 --> 00:55:53,109
- Aww, what are you doing there, baby?

1053
00:55:53,109 --> 00:55:54,439
- I have to pee.

1054
00:55:56,575 --> 00:55:57,635
- [Zach] (mumbles)?

1055
00:55:57,636 --> 00:55:58,736
- [Rebecca] No!

1056
00:55:58,741 --> 00:55:59,961
- All right, come on.

1057
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:00,788
- Okay!

1058
00:56:09,398 --> 00:56:11,648
(grunting)

1059
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:27,319
No!

1060
00:56:27,316 --> 00:56:28,476
Get off of me!

1061
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:35,300
- (laughs) Stop.

1062
00:56:35,295 --> 00:56:37,545
(laughing)

1063
00:56:43,287 --> 00:56:47,447
You little, hey, hold still,
you wiggly little salamander.

1064
00:56:48,302 --> 00:56:50,382
(laughing)

1065
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:52,211
You're the salamander.

1066
00:56:53,301 --> 00:56:54,531
(screaming)

1067
00:56:54,534 --> 00:56:55,374
- Ow!

1068
00:57:05,581 --> 00:57:06,751
- What's this?

1069
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:11,011
- I think you bit me last night.

1070
00:57:11,013 --> 00:57:11,853
- Oh.

1071
00:57:12,933 --> 00:57:15,693
Well you must've been trying to rape me.

1072
00:57:15,685 --> 00:57:18,315
- Maybe, but at this point I don't think

1073
00:57:18,324 --> 00:57:21,364
it would even be rape, it would just be...

1074
00:57:21,357 --> 00:57:23,017
Kinky sex basically.

1075
00:57:24,756 --> 00:57:27,086
In fact, I could probably...

1076
00:57:30,301 --> 00:57:31,881
Rape you right now.

1077
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,350
And your case would never hold up.

1078
00:57:37,348 --> 00:57:40,848
In fact, you would just look like a whore.

1079
00:57:47,205 --> 00:57:49,545
- It looks like it's getting infected.

1080
00:57:49,547 --> 00:57:51,627
It's probably gonna scar.

1081
00:57:53,556 --> 00:57:54,386
- Yeah.

1082
00:57:55,395 --> 00:57:59,985
You probably left a
permanent mark on my body.

1083
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,820
- Good.

1084
00:58:02,158 --> 00:58:04,658
(phone rings)

1085
00:58:06,062 --> 00:58:07,132
- Hello?

1086
00:58:07,126 --> 00:58:08,526
- You're busted.

1087
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,606
I know you're with that girl Rebecca.

1088
00:58:14,373 --> 00:58:17,373
- Okay, well I guess that's it then.

1089
00:58:19,334 --> 00:58:21,334
- [Latisha] What do you mean that's it?

1090
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:24,304
- Well I guess that's that then, huh?

1091
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:25,581
- [Latisha] If you're in New York

1092
00:58:25,581 --> 00:58:26,891
and we're breaking up right now,

1093
00:58:26,893 --> 00:58:30,833
then you have to come do it in person.

1094
00:58:30,829 --> 00:58:32,409
- Well I, I mean...

1095
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:38,655
All right, I'll, I'm gonna figure out...

1096
00:58:39,813 --> 00:58:42,923
What to do and then I'll
call you back, okay?

1097
00:58:42,917 --> 00:58:44,247
- [Latisha] Bye.

1098
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:48,422
- Who was that?

1099
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,760
- [Zach] That was Latisha.

1100
00:58:49,764 --> 00:58:50,894
- What?

1101
00:58:50,892 --> 00:58:52,962
How does she know we're here?

1102
00:58:52,964 --> 00:58:54,614
- [Zach] I honestly have no idea,

1103
00:58:54,612 --> 00:58:56,622
did you post something online?

1104
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,820
- Of course.

1105
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,360
What's she gonna do,
come here and kill us?

1106
00:59:00,363 --> 00:59:01,803
- (chuckles) No.

1107
00:59:01,796 --> 00:59:05,956
Look, let me just go over
there and break up with her.

1108
00:59:09,988 --> 00:59:13,438
- You broke up with her months ago.

1109
00:59:13,435 --> 00:59:16,265
(soft scat music)

1110
00:59:39,593 --> 00:59:40,433
- Hey.

1111
00:59:45,913 --> 00:59:47,083
How you doing?

1112
01:00:12,688 --> 01:00:15,568
Didn't you wanna talk about something?

1113
01:00:15,567 --> 01:00:17,397
What do you wanna say?

1114
01:00:59,206 --> 01:01:01,256
(dog whines)

1115
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:04,318
(door slams)

1116
01:01:04,323 --> 01:01:07,163
(playful humming)

1117
01:01:12,754 --> 01:01:13,594
- Hey!

1118
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,505
How'd it go?

1119
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,265
- It went.

1120
01:01:20,273 --> 01:01:22,023
- Well what happened?

1121
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:24,171
- It happened.

1122
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,925
- How'd she take it?

1123
01:01:28,153 --> 01:01:29,713
- She took it.

1124
01:01:29,705 --> 01:01:32,865
- Hey, you wanna get matching tattoos?

1125
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:35,755
Huh?

1126
01:01:37,312 --> 01:01:39,432
- Yeah, well how about
this, I got an idea,

1127
01:01:39,432 --> 01:01:42,192
why don't you get one and then if

1128
01:01:42,192 --> 01:01:45,192
I want one later, then I'll get one.

1129
01:01:46,472 --> 01:01:47,822
- I want it on my lower back,

1130
01:01:47,824 --> 01:01:49,854
but I don't want it to be a tramp stamp.

1131
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:51,967
- That's what a tramp stamp is.

1132
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:53,437
- No, I just want it to be a cute

1133
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,380
little wiggly salamander crawling

1134
01:01:55,383 --> 01:01:57,383
up to the inside of my pants.

1135
01:01:57,378 --> 01:01:58,408
- I'm not saying not to get it

1136
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,730
on your lower back, I'm just saying

1137
01:01:59,725 --> 01:02:01,855
that's what a tramp stamp is.

1138
01:02:01,857 --> 01:02:03,937
That's what they call it.

1139
01:02:05,617 --> 01:02:08,947
I'm getting a call, I'll be there.

1140
01:02:08,953 --> 01:02:09,793
- Hey.

1141
01:02:10,724 --> 01:02:13,314
So do you guys do tattoos here?

1142
01:02:15,724 --> 01:02:18,244
- [Ex] Ho ho ho, merry Christmas.

1143
01:02:18,236 --> 01:02:19,296
- What?

1144
01:02:19,301 --> 01:02:20,721
It's Christmas?

1145
01:02:20,723 --> 01:02:22,783
Shit.
(laughing)

1146
01:02:22,778 --> 01:02:26,598
- No no, it's not, but
it's coming up soon and I

1147
01:02:26,602 --> 01:02:29,172
was just wondering what
you're planning for Max.

1148
01:02:29,172 --> 01:02:33,312
- Oh, well I'm in Manhattan so maybe I'll

1149
01:02:33,305 --> 01:02:36,365
go up to FAO Schwarz and
I'll get him something.

1150
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:38,320
- What about a piano?

1151
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:39,742
- [Zach] A piano?

1152
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:42,385
- Zach, it's a scientific fact

1153
01:02:42,393 --> 01:02:44,503
that it's good for his brain, okay?

1154
01:02:44,497 --> 01:02:47,477
And it's a healing thing,
we've discussed this.

1155
01:02:47,481 --> 01:02:50,981
- Maybe I'll get him a piano for my house.

1156
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,040
- Think you could run
down to the store and

1157
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:03,884
buy me some Aquaphor for
my tattoo, rub on it?

1158
01:03:06,422 --> 01:03:07,262
Hmm?

1159
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,951
(phone rings)

1160
01:03:22,188 --> 01:03:23,908
- Hi, Zach.

1161
01:03:23,907 --> 01:03:25,947
It's been so long since I heard from you.

1162
01:03:25,947 --> 01:03:27,487
Where you been?

1163
01:03:27,492 --> 01:03:31,402
- I'm in Vermont right
now, it's really beautiful.

1164
01:03:31,395 --> 01:03:35,985
I'm surrounded by nine foot
walls of snow everywhere.

1165
01:03:35,987 --> 01:03:39,247
Anyway, you wanna hang out tomorrow night

1166
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:40,761
'cause I could come to New York,

1167
01:03:40,763 --> 01:03:43,643
I could fly out there
and we could hang out.

1168
01:03:43,643 --> 01:03:44,503
- Really?

1169
01:03:44,499 --> 01:03:46,409
You'd fly here just to see me?

1170
01:03:46,411 --> 01:03:48,091
- Well yeah.

1171
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:50,801
We could go to the Aquagrill
or something like that.

1172
01:03:50,802 --> 01:03:52,802
What do you think?

1173
01:03:52,802 --> 01:03:53,642
- Hey!

1174
01:03:53,635 --> 01:03:55,185
- [Zach] Look what I've got for you.

1175
01:03:55,194 --> 01:03:56,524
- Great!

1176
01:03:56,523 --> 01:03:58,363
- Want me to put it on your tattoo?

1177
01:03:58,362 --> 01:04:00,282
- [Rebecca] Yes please.

1178
01:04:01,114 --> 01:04:02,114
- All right.

1179
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:08,602
- Ah!

1180
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:11,930
- That all right?

1181
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:13,472
- Yeah.

1182
01:04:13,468 --> 01:04:14,858
- Hey, do you mind if I stay in

1183
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,920
New York for a couple more days?

1184
01:04:16,924 --> 01:04:19,084
Just wanna do some more Christmas shopping

1185
01:04:19,084 --> 01:04:21,644
and see some of my friends out here.

1186
01:04:21,635 --> 01:04:23,115
- Yeah, that's fine.

1187
01:04:23,115 --> 01:04:24,955
I gotta get back though.

1188
01:04:24,955 --> 01:04:25,785
- Okay.

1189
01:04:28,043 --> 01:04:30,463
(loud smack)

1190
01:04:33,827 --> 01:04:36,907
Calculations collapse, formulas fail.

1191
01:04:38,043 --> 01:04:41,563
Even the New York fuck
didn't work on Crazy Eyes.

1192
01:04:41,563 --> 01:04:45,733
Now I'm left scavenging the
abyss with a hungry ghost.

1193
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:52,364
Harlots like these are the
price guys like me have to pay.

1194
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:55,355
(jazzy piano music)

1195
01:05:00,346 --> 01:05:02,506
(moaning)

1196
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,760
- [Max] Cool!

1197
01:05:26,198 --> 01:05:27,198
Thanks, dad.

1198
01:05:31,454 --> 01:05:35,474
- Hey, I'm sorry that I
told you God doesn't exist.

1199
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,080
I'm sorry about that 'cause I

1200
01:05:37,078 --> 01:05:39,808
don't really know that that's true.

1201
01:05:39,805 --> 01:05:40,915
(sneezes)

1202
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:41,747
Bless you.

1203
01:05:43,733 --> 01:05:45,713
I don't think anybody really knows

1204
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:48,809
though, you know what I mean?

1205
01:05:48,813 --> 01:05:50,273
The thing is if He does exist,

1206
01:05:50,269 --> 01:05:51,569
then he might be even more of a

1207
01:05:51,565 --> 01:05:53,285
monster than Godzilla because people

1208
01:05:53,285 --> 01:05:56,495
who believe in Him blow each other up.

1209
01:05:56,501 --> 01:05:59,081
- I know, maybe there is a God.

1210
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:04,704
â™« I'm the queen of darkness

1211
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,360

1212
01:06:06,356 --> 01:06:07,726
â™« Damn I look cute

1213
01:06:07,725 --> 01:06:10,195
â™« But I'm far from harmless

1214
01:06:10,204 --> 01:06:13,964
â™« Don't be alarmed, it's just me

1215
01:06:13,956 --> 01:06:18,066

01:06:18,071 --> 01:06:19,491

1220
01:06:28,398 --> 01:06:29,868
â™« Other boys they found me just

01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:32,360
â™« A little too hard to handle

1222
01:06:32,357 --> 01:06:34,987
â™« Damn yo, this is just a side gig

1223
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,240
â™« I'm chilling here, and it's all

1224
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:40,589
â™« Because, well, I'm just throwing it

1225
01:06:40,585 --> 01:06:42,195

01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:43,791

01:06:43,785 --> 01:06:45,365
â™« Choke that boy, those guys were gas

1228
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:47,419
â™« Just to see let's get in this scrap

1229
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:50,617
â™« Calm down, (mumbles)
I got you on your knees

1230
01:06:50,617 --> 01:06:54,777
â™« See a little pledge and
now I'm getting hungry â™«

1231
01:06:56,425 --> 01:06:57,905
- I'm gonna puke.

1232
01:06:57,906 --> 01:07:01,066
(crowd counting down)

1233
01:07:03,775 --> 01:07:07,725
- [Crowd] Five, four, three, two, one!

1234
01:07:07,727 --> 01:07:09,437
(vomits)

1235
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,239
(cheering)

1236
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,550
(dance music)

1237
01:07:14,554 --> 01:07:18,624
â™« And this is what the devil does

1238
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,728

â™« And this is what the devil does â™«

1241
01:07:26,381 --> 01:07:28,631
(groaning)

1242
01:07:32,037 --> 01:07:34,167
- [Dan] Light years later and you're the

1243
01:07:34,167 --> 01:07:37,877
same, but everyone you knew is dead.

1244
01:07:37,876 --> 01:07:39,706
- Hey Zach, oh my God.

1245
01:07:41,644 --> 01:07:44,644
Zach, we are having the coolest.

1246
01:07:44,642 --> 01:07:46,112
(laughing)

1247
01:07:46,109 --> 01:07:50,279
Conversation about time
and space and the universe.

1248
01:07:51,112 --> 01:07:53,032
- [Zach] No you're not.

1249
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:58,349
- Rebecca, do some coke so
you can hang out with us.

1250
01:08:03,068 --> 01:08:04,878
- No no no no no no, I don't want her

1251
01:08:04,876 --> 01:08:06,266
to do, don't give her coke.

1252
01:08:06,267 --> 01:08:07,747
I don't wanna stay up all night.

1253
01:08:07,747 --> 01:08:08,757
- [Autumn] What?

1254
01:08:08,755 --> 01:08:11,115
But it's New Year's!

1255
01:08:11,115 --> 01:08:12,245
I don't know why you guys think

1256
01:08:12,251 --> 01:08:13,931
I'm such a horrible person.

1257
01:08:13,931 --> 01:08:15,201
You're the only ones who think that,

1258
01:08:15,203 --> 01:08:17,003
everyone else thinks I'm a sweetheart.

1259
01:08:16,995 --> 01:08:18,505
- We don't think you're a horrible person,

1260
01:08:18,507 --> 01:08:21,137
we just know that you're not
a sweetheart, that's all.

1261
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:22,559
- [Autumn] You think I'm a bitch?

1262
01:08:22,555 --> 01:08:24,075
- [Dan] I didn't say
you were a bitch, okay?

1263
01:08:24,075 --> 01:08:25,445
I'm just saying you're not a sweetheart,

1264
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:26,990
none of your friends have ever thought so,

1265
01:08:26,994 --> 01:08:28,474
and nobody would ever say Autumn

1266
01:08:28,474 --> 01:08:30,134
is a sweetheart in a sentence.

1267
01:08:30,133 --> 01:08:31,383
- (sobs) So you're saying everyone

1268
01:08:31,378 --> 01:08:33,818
thinks I'm a horrible person?

1269
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,568
- Just the way it is.

1270
01:08:36,444 --> 01:08:38,634
- Fuck you, you fucking asshole!

1271
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:39,800
- Ow, stop it!

1272
01:08:40,638 --> 01:08:42,528
- I'm a fucking sweetheart!

1273
01:08:42,531 --> 01:08:43,971
I'm a fucking sweetheart!

1274
01:08:43,968 --> 01:08:45,298
- [Dan] Stop it!

1275
01:08:47,218 --> 01:08:51,058
- [Autumn] Everyone
thinks I'm a sweetheart!

1276
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,730
- She is kinda a sweetheart.

1277
01:08:53,731 --> 01:08:56,481
(dramatic music)

1278
01:08:59,147 --> 01:09:03,307
- It's really bad luck not to
have sex on New Year's day.

1279
01:09:05,467 --> 01:09:08,377
- I think maybe we're just friends.

1280
01:09:09,427 --> 01:09:11,427
- Well maybe I'm confused because you come

1281
01:09:11,427 --> 01:09:14,097
here and you sleep every
night naked in my bed,

1282
01:09:14,099 --> 01:09:16,789
and my friends call you my girlfriend.

1283
01:09:16,787 --> 01:09:19,197
- I don't know, I'm confused.

1284
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:22,453
I like hanging out with you, I still want

1285
01:09:22,451 --> 01:09:26,371
you to take me to the
Hieronymus Bosch exhibit.

1286
01:09:30,961 --> 01:09:35,421
- I don't wanna take you to
the Hieronymus Bosch exhibit.

1287
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:39,827
Unless you have wild,
passionate sex with me before.

1288
01:09:39,832 --> 01:09:40,672
And after.

1289
01:09:42,248 --> 01:09:43,788
- I'm sure all of his creepy weird

1290
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:46,042
sexual paintings will help.

1291
01:09:47,056 --> 01:09:48,886
- Yeah, it can't hurt.

1292
01:09:57,672 --> 01:10:00,882
- I think you should stop
trying to have sex with me.

1293
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,460
Think maybe we're just friends.

1294
01:10:04,336 --> 01:10:06,416
- I mean I don't want you
to think I'm mad at you,

1295
01:10:06,423 --> 01:10:09,733
but I'm really bored just sitting here not

1296
01:10:09,728 --> 01:10:12,558
trying to have sex with you, so...

1297
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:19,839
I'm gonna go have a beer with Dan Drake.

1298
01:10:19,839 --> 01:10:22,629
- Okay, fine, I'm leaving then.

1299
01:10:22,631 --> 01:10:23,871
- Okay, fine.

1300
01:10:23,871 --> 01:10:27,421
Maybe I'll just start drinking right now.

1301
01:10:27,415 --> 01:10:30,885
(coughing violently)

1302
01:10:30,887 --> 01:10:32,477
- Ah, that was water!

1303
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:33,969
- That was my contact lenses,

1304
01:10:33,967 --> 01:10:37,037
you just drank my contact lenses.

1305
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,610
You are such an alcoholic!

1306
01:10:39,614 --> 01:10:41,534
Happy fucking New Year!

1307
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,460
- Hey Kim, it's Zach.

1308
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:48,890
I was thinking about you, just wanted to

1309
01:10:48,894 --> 01:10:50,554
see what you've been up to, if you want to

1310
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:53,300
go for drinks or get some dinner.

1311
01:10:54,414 --> 01:10:55,504
Call me back.

1312
01:10:56,487 --> 01:10:58,607
Hey Melissa, it's Zach.

1313
01:10:58,614 --> 01:11:00,054
Been thinking about you, just wanted to

1314
01:11:00,046 --> 01:11:03,846
see if you want to get some
drinks or go to dinner.

1315
01:11:03,845 --> 01:11:05,405
Give me a call.

1316
01:11:05,414 --> 01:11:06,634
Erica?

1317
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:07,879
Hey, it's Zach.

1318
01:11:08,829 --> 01:11:12,449
- It's a good thing it's over, man.

1319
01:11:12,445 --> 01:11:13,595
- You think so?

1320
01:11:13,597 --> 01:11:15,137
- Yeah, I mean I can take it if

1321
01:11:15,141 --> 01:11:17,771
a certain weird courtship with Crazy Eyes

1322
01:11:17,765 --> 01:11:21,095
brought you to a darker place than ever.

1323
01:11:22,221 --> 01:11:24,431
- You're right, man.

1324
01:11:24,429 --> 01:11:25,719
- [Dan] Fuck those bitches.

1325
01:11:25,717 --> 01:11:27,467
- Yeah, you're right.

1326
01:11:33,364 --> 01:11:35,704
They'll never hurt us again.

1327
01:11:36,604 --> 01:11:39,464
(woman shrieking)

1328
01:11:39,459 --> 01:11:42,289
(glasses shatter)

1329
01:11:50,026 --> 01:11:52,436
- [Voiceover] Hold him, hold!

1330
01:11:56,602 --> 01:11:58,022
Get him, get him!

1331
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:11,853
(loud whack)

1332
01:12:11,846 --> 01:12:15,176
(radio tuning)

1333
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:16,851
- What am I all wet?

1334
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,060
What am I all wet?

1335
01:12:21,062 --> 01:12:22,652
What am I all wet?!

1336
01:12:30,581 --> 01:12:32,381
- I'll tell you what though, those guys

1337
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:34,871
are never coming back in here ever.

1338
01:12:34,869 --> 01:12:38,909
- I know man, that was like
a goddamn Vietcong ambush.

1339
01:12:38,908 --> 01:12:40,358
And you know what, you
wouldn't have gotten

1340
01:12:40,355 --> 01:12:41,635
hit if you had just let me knock

1341
01:12:41,635 --> 01:12:43,065
the guy out in the first place.

1342
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,357
- What are you talking about?

1343
01:12:44,363 --> 01:12:46,393
You did knock him out in the first place.

1344
01:12:46,394 --> 01:12:49,074
They hit me before we even saw him.

1345
01:12:49,066 --> 01:12:50,106
- What are you talking about?

1346
01:12:50,108 --> 01:12:51,508
I was the one who knocked the guy out.

1347
01:12:51,507 --> 01:12:54,797
I was the one that did that, okay?

1348
01:12:54,802 --> 01:12:57,642
(Rebecca sobbing)

1349
01:13:03,378 --> 01:13:06,628
(police radio chatter)

1350
01:13:08,274 --> 01:13:10,774
- [Voiceover] Come over here.

1351
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:12,790
Have you been drinking?

1352
01:13:12,786 --> 01:13:13,616
- What?

1353
01:13:13,619 --> 01:13:15,239
- [Voiceover] Have you been drinking?

1354
01:13:15,242 --> 01:13:16,082
- No!

1355
01:13:20,642 --> 01:13:21,652
Shit.

1356
01:13:21,649 --> 01:13:22,869
- [Voiceover] Come on.

1357
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:26,575
- [Rebecca] Where are you
putting me, I'm not drunk!

1358
01:13:26,577 --> 01:13:28,737
(sobbing)

1359
01:13:29,753 --> 01:13:33,723
Hey, you guys (mumbles)?

1360
01:13:33,721 --> 01:13:37,191
(coughing violently)

1361
01:13:37,193 --> 01:13:38,963
- [Zach] I woke up hungover this morning,

1362
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:41,501
but I didn't drink last night.

1363
01:13:41,496 --> 01:13:42,326
Or did I?

1364
01:13:44,905 --> 01:13:48,405
The world seemed like it was
trying to come to an end.

1365
01:13:48,408 --> 01:13:51,898
The city holding us
together was falling apart.

1366
01:13:51,896 --> 01:13:55,146
All I could think about was Crazy Eyes.

1367
01:13:56,041 --> 01:13:57,841
I couldn't remember why we were possessed,

1368
01:13:57,842 --> 01:14:01,622
but the fact was that it was too late.

1369
01:14:01,624 --> 01:14:03,124
The tires had already
hit the ice and nothing

1370
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,490
could change the next series of events.

1371
01:14:05,488 --> 01:14:07,988
(jazzy music)

1372
01:14:18,698 --> 01:14:21,448
- You didn't have to bail me out.

1373
01:14:23,066 --> 01:14:23,976
- Whatever.

1374
01:14:45,155 --> 01:14:49,275
- My car's totally totaled,
my license is suspended.

1375
01:14:49,283 --> 01:14:51,583
My boss just called up and fired me.

1376
01:14:51,579 --> 01:14:53,619
I hate my life.

1377
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:55,709
- [Voiceover] Make a u-turn when possible.

1378
01:14:55,707 --> 01:14:57,537
- Turn that bitch off!

1379
01:15:00,499 --> 01:15:02,229
- Look, I gotta stop by the hospital,

1380
01:15:02,227 --> 01:15:05,427
I have to check on my father, okay?

1381
01:15:05,426 --> 01:15:08,296
- I was just at the hospital.

1382
01:15:08,298 --> 01:15:10,588
- Yeah, well I wanna see how my

1383
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:15,154
dad's doing, so I'm
gonna go to the hospital.

1384
01:15:15,148 --> 01:15:18,228
- They're gonna think you beat me up.

1385
01:15:19,866 --> 01:15:20,946
- [Zach] Hey.

1386
01:15:24,418 --> 01:15:27,338
- Do you finally have a new friend?

1387
01:15:28,523 --> 01:15:30,943
What's your name, she's cute.

1388
01:15:31,825 --> 01:15:32,655
- Rebecca.

1389
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,949
- It's very good to meet you.

1390
01:15:36,793 --> 01:15:37,873
- Hey mom.

1391
01:15:37,865 --> 01:15:38,695
- Hi.

1392
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:44,265
Oh, they said we could probably

1393
01:15:44,267 --> 01:15:46,767
take him home in a week or so.

1394
01:15:48,323 --> 01:15:50,273
I wish I could take you two out

1395
01:15:50,274 --> 01:15:53,304
for dinner or something, but I

1396
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:55,628
stopped going to restaurants

1397
01:15:56,554 --> 01:15:59,554
because of my mold hypersensitivity.

1398
01:16:06,466 --> 01:16:08,946
- So Crazy Eyes is moving off to upstate

1399
01:16:08,946 --> 01:16:11,986
New York or wherever the hell she's from.

1400
01:16:11,994 --> 01:16:12,834
- Good.

1401
01:16:13,891 --> 01:16:16,071
I always told you that girl was a cunt.

1402
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:19,292
Your life is gonna be
unimaginably better without her.

1403
01:16:19,294 --> 01:16:20,884
- Yeah, I guess so.

1404
01:16:26,261 --> 01:16:28,431
(gunshot)

1405
01:16:31,228 --> 01:16:32,488
- Mr. Drake!

1406
01:16:32,492 --> 01:16:33,642
What have you been up to?

1407
01:16:33,644 --> 01:16:34,544
- Hey Andrew.

1408
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:35,370
- Hey.

1409
01:16:35,373 --> 01:16:37,103
- Just masturbating and crying as usual.

1410
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,500
(laughing)

1411
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,830
This is Zach.

1412
01:16:40,828 --> 01:16:42,038
- [Andrew] Anybody shooting full beers

1413
01:16:42,036 --> 01:16:44,406
with a BB gun at noon is cool by me.

1414
01:16:44,412 --> 01:16:45,552
- Yeah, he's cool.

1415
01:16:45,548 --> 01:16:46,848
- You still selling cocaine?

1416
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,442
- Yeah, only to discrete customers.

1417
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:50,283
Come on.

1418
01:16:51,243 --> 01:16:53,113
- [Andrew] I don't do cocaine.

1419
01:16:53,107 --> 01:16:55,137
I just throw it on pussy.

1420
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:57,850
Makes the clitoris grow to
the size of your finger.

1421
01:16:57,853 --> 01:16:59,093
- [Dan] Haven't heard that.

1422
01:16:59,092 --> 01:17:01,622
- Yeah, but personally,
I've never done the stuff.

1423
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,667
(gunshot)

1424
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:04,645
- Right.

1425
01:17:04,649 --> 01:17:05,749
- I can't tell you if that was

1426
01:17:05,753 --> 01:17:07,233
any good or not 'cause I don't do it.

1427
01:17:07,233 --> 01:17:09,123
- [Dan] No shit.

1428
01:17:09,121 --> 01:17:10,421
(gunshot)

1429
01:17:10,416 --> 01:17:11,856
Hey!

1430
01:17:11,855 --> 01:17:14,055
That was my fucking bird feeder, man!

1431
01:17:14,055 --> 01:17:17,395
- Come on, it's not the
worse thing I've ever done.

1432
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:20,569
(gentle scat singing)

1433
01:17:24,192 --> 01:17:25,032
Hey.

1434
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:26,809
- Hey.

1435
01:17:29,657 --> 01:17:33,407
- You haven't gotten
much progress done, huh?

1436
01:17:39,075 --> 01:17:40,155
Nice unicorn.

1437
01:17:42,306 --> 01:17:43,936
- It's a horse.

1438
01:17:43,938 --> 01:17:44,768
No horn.

1439
01:18:07,088 --> 01:18:10,758
I don't need a fucking
snow globe right now.

1440
01:18:12,328 --> 01:18:14,078
- It's nice in there.

1441
01:18:15,496 --> 01:18:16,936
Don't you sometimes wanna just

1442
01:18:16,936 --> 01:18:19,846
move inside of one of those things?

1443
01:18:22,936 --> 01:18:25,146
- Maybe you have time and money to

1444
01:18:25,151 --> 01:18:26,901
sit around wishing you could move inside

1445
01:18:26,896 --> 01:18:30,146
a snow globe, but I have real problems.

1446
01:18:35,639 --> 01:18:36,469
- So...

1447
01:18:38,015 --> 01:18:40,095
You wanna go get a drink?

1448
01:18:40,951 --> 01:18:41,951
- Of course.

1449
01:18:50,503 --> 01:18:53,003
- All right folks, that's
it, we're closing down!

1450
01:18:52,999 --> 01:18:54,119
Closing time!

1451
01:18:54,118 --> 01:18:55,888
(groans and boos)

1452
01:18:55,894 --> 01:18:58,234
- [Bob] Let's go, thank you!

1453
01:19:02,482 --> 01:19:04,982
Keep rolling people, let's go!

1454
01:19:06,307 --> 01:19:09,027
- I bet sometime soon you're gonna wanna

1455
01:19:09,026 --> 01:19:13,546
hang out with a girl
that'll actually fuck you.

1456
01:19:13,546 --> 01:19:16,176
- Stay the fuck away from us!

1457
01:19:16,178 --> 01:19:19,508
- Hey, come on, I'm just messing around.

1458
01:19:21,522 --> 01:19:23,522
You know I like to play.

1459
01:19:28,026 --> 01:19:29,336
(glass shatters)

1460
01:19:29,337 --> 01:19:31,717
- [Rebecca] I'll kill you, cunt!

1461
01:19:31,722 --> 01:19:34,062
(screaming)

1462
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,097
Fucking bitch!

1463
01:19:41,384 --> 01:19:42,224
Kill you!

1464
01:20:01,697 --> 01:20:03,857
(choking)

1465
01:20:07,756 --> 01:20:10,166
- Let me at that crazy bitch!

1466
01:20:11,876 --> 01:20:16,876
- I'm gonna have to move
back in with my mom and dad.

1467
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:20,955
I don't know what I'm
gonna do with all my stuff.

1468
01:20:23,368 --> 01:20:25,668
- Just try to relax.

1469
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:27,110
You can stay here for a few days

1470
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:29,700
while we try to sort it out.

1471
01:20:29,702 --> 01:20:31,252
- I'm just going through a rough time

1472
01:20:31,254 --> 01:20:32,584
right now, I don't know how many times

1473
01:20:32,576 --> 01:20:33,816
I have to say the same fucking thing,

1474
01:20:33,821 --> 01:20:36,161
I'm not your fucking girlfriend.

1475
01:20:36,157 --> 01:20:38,657
(phone rings)

1476
01:20:41,965 --> 01:20:42,795
- Hello?

1477
01:20:52,533 --> 01:20:53,373
I see.

1478
01:20:54,356 --> 01:20:57,106
(dramatic music)

1479
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:12,570
- My life fucking sucks.

1480
01:21:12,569 --> 01:21:14,679
I have nothing and you're a rich

1481
01:21:14,681 --> 01:21:16,231
asshole with no feelings, you don't

1482
01:21:16,225 --> 01:21:19,305
even know what it's like to struggle.

1483
01:21:51,131 --> 01:21:55,301
I wanna die, you're a useless,
unresponsive alcoholic!

1484
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:59,960
(door slams)

1485
01:22:19,821 --> 01:22:23,461
- Donald Raizman has gone past us.

1486
01:22:23,462 --> 01:22:27,382
Earth is the beginning,
death is a destination.

1487
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,290
- I'm sorry.

1488
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:49,070
Hey, do you wanna say something to daddy?

1489
01:22:50,434 --> 01:22:52,934
- Thanks for the piano, daddy.

1490
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:57,654
- Go give your daddy a hug.

1491
01:23:08,204 --> 01:23:10,064
- [Zach] I love you, buddy.

1492
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,060
- I love you too, daddy.

1493
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:21,650
- Bye.

1494
01:23:27,788 --> 01:23:30,958
(gentle scat singing)

1495
01:23:37,289 --> 01:23:38,759
- [Zach] Some people say you become

1496
01:23:38,762 --> 01:23:40,852
a man when your dad dies.

1497
01:23:42,433 --> 01:23:45,883
I don't give a fuck what people say.

1498
01:23:45,881 --> 01:23:49,131
All I could think about was Crazy Eyes.

1499
01:23:51,145 --> 01:23:53,475
- You know my grandpa
with the really old face?

1500
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,980
(gasping)

1501
01:23:54,984 --> 01:23:55,824
He died.

1502
01:24:02,384 --> 01:24:04,294
- Maybe you have time and money to

1503
01:24:04,288 --> 01:24:05,958
sit around wishing you could move inside

1504
01:24:05,963 --> 01:24:09,213
a snow globe, but I have real problems.

1505
01:24:13,059 --> 01:24:15,559
(phone rings)

1506
01:24:18,339 --> 01:24:19,169
Hello?

1507
01:24:20,066 --> 01:24:21,146
- [Zach] Hey.

1508
01:24:22,276 --> 01:24:23,106
- Hey.

1509
01:24:24,138 --> 01:24:28,348
- Sorry I haven't called
you back in a couple weeks.

1510
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:30,194
My father passed away.

1511
01:24:34,426 --> 01:24:35,256
- Sorry.

1512
01:24:37,545 --> 01:24:38,805
- How you been?

1513
01:24:38,812 --> 01:24:41,182
- [Rebecca] Good, I've
been back here in New York.

1514
01:24:41,183 --> 01:24:43,783
Working in my aunt's bar.

1515
01:24:43,783 --> 01:24:46,533
Getting hit on by creepy old men.

1516
01:24:48,047 --> 01:24:51,317
- Hey listen, as it
turns out the Hieronymus

1517
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:55,069
Bosch exhibit is going
to New York next week.

1518
01:24:56,344 --> 01:24:59,244
(chuckles)

1519
01:24:59,239 --> 01:25:00,699
- Yay.

1520
01:25:00,702 --> 01:25:04,702
(upbeat french accordion music)

1521
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:30,889
- I was supposed to leave today, but...

1522
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:32,275
I was thinking I could just stay with you

1523
01:26:32,277 --> 01:26:33,827
and we could get haircuts and you

1524
01:26:33,829 --> 01:26:36,409
could get your matching tattoo.

1525
01:26:42,605 --> 01:26:46,565
- I thought you said three days, right?

1526
01:26:46,572 --> 01:26:47,962
- Yeah, well there was all this stuff

1527
01:26:47,956 --> 01:26:49,626
that I thought I had to do, but it turns

1528
01:26:49,628 --> 01:26:51,178
out it's fell through and I could stay

1529
01:26:51,183 --> 01:26:54,353
here with you if you want me to.

1530
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:56,100
Don't you want me to?

1531
01:27:05,398 --> 01:27:08,378
- You remember what you
said about the Earth

1532
01:27:08,381 --> 01:27:11,631
not moving and love and all that stuff?

1533
01:27:13,597 --> 01:27:14,427
- Mmmhm.

1534
01:27:16,837 --> 01:27:20,667
- I just think maybe you
were right, you know?

1535
01:27:23,197 --> 01:27:24,967
- (laughs) I thought you didn't

1536
01:27:24,966 --> 01:27:28,046
care about any of that stuff.

1537
01:27:28,053 --> 01:27:28,893
- Yeah.

1538
01:27:29,933 --> 01:27:33,273
I thought I didn't care about it either.

1539
01:27:35,932 --> 01:27:36,772
But I...

1540
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,700
What time's your train?

1541
01:27:44,316 --> 01:27:45,476
- It's at two.

1542
01:27:50,284 --> 01:27:51,944
- Yeah, so you still have plenty of

1543
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:55,440
time to finish packing and get over there.

1544
01:28:04,413 --> 01:28:08,583
Here's some money for a cab
and train ticket and stuff.

1545
01:28:17,609 --> 01:28:20,579
- I'm just one of your girls now.

1546
01:28:20,581 --> 01:28:23,161
Is that what you really wanted?

1547
01:28:27,224 --> 01:28:29,894
- I don't want anything anymore.

1548
01:28:33,192 --> 01:28:37,032
It's just that you were
right and I was wrong.

1549
01:28:40,968 --> 01:28:42,828
- All this time I didn't love you because

1550
01:28:42,832 --> 01:28:45,382
I thought you were too
nice a guy, but it turns

1551
01:28:45,376 --> 01:28:49,036
out you're the biggest
asshole in the world.

1552
01:29:01,839 --> 01:29:05,009
(erratic piano music)

1553
01:29:14,347 --> 01:29:16,847
(phone rings)

1554
01:29:32,459 --> 01:29:33,379
- Hello?

1555
01:29:33,379 --> 01:29:36,109
- [Zach] Hey Britney, it's Zach.

1556
01:29:36,106 --> 01:29:37,716
- Hey Zach.

1557
01:29:37,716 --> 01:29:39,106
Good to hear from you.

1558
01:29:39,112 --> 01:29:40,782
- Dad, are you okay?

1559
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,780
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1560
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:46,950
- Hello?

1561
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,660
- I'm just a little sad about your

1562
01:29:49,664 --> 01:29:52,124
grandfather being gone, you know?

1563
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:56,290
- Dad, if there's no God or
Heaven, where did grandpa go?

1564
01:29:58,224 --> 01:29:59,474
- Nobody knows.

1565
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:04,989
- I get sad when things change,

1566
01:30:04,985 --> 01:30:07,495
like when you move into your own house.

1567
01:30:07,503 --> 01:30:10,093
- Yeah, I get sad about it too.

1568
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:13,789
Everything always changes.

1569
01:30:13,791 --> 01:30:15,941
- But a kid doesn't change, right?

1570
01:30:15,935 --> 01:30:17,935
- Yeah, that's true.

1571
01:30:17,943 --> 01:30:20,863
That's right, a kid doesn't change.

1572
01:30:26,575 --> 01:30:27,405
- Dad?

1573
01:30:27,408 --> 01:30:28,238
- Hmm?

1574
01:30:28,241 --> 01:30:29,961
- What does breaking up mean?

1575
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,448
- Breaking up?

1576
01:30:31,454 --> 01:30:33,224
I don't know.

1577
01:30:33,215 --> 01:30:35,355
All I know is it's different every time.

1578
01:30:35,358 --> 01:30:36,768
- Like snowflakes?

1579
01:30:36,767 --> 01:30:39,927
- Yeah, yeah, exactly like snowflakes.

1580
01:30:47,206 --> 01:30:48,196
- Hey dad?

1581
01:30:48,204 --> 01:30:49,254
- Yeah?

1582
01:30:49,252 --> 01:30:50,682
- If you gotta fight a monster,

1583
01:30:50,676 --> 01:30:52,436
put a bone in your nose.

1584
01:30:52,435 --> 01:30:56,595
- (laughs) That's the smartest
thing I've heard all day.

1585
01:30:59,059 --> 01:31:01,059
I could tell you pleasing details,

1586
01:31:01,059 --> 01:31:02,599
like maybe I quit drinking or

1587
01:31:02,603 --> 01:31:05,033
I ended up with a beautiful girl,

1588
01:31:05,027 --> 01:31:06,457
but I don't feel like telling you stuff

1589
01:31:06,459 --> 01:31:10,289
like that 'cause if I
told, and it was true,

1590
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:13,801
then I'd probably mess it
up like everything else.

1591
01:31:13,795 --> 01:31:17,955
(gentle piano music)
(soft humming)

1592
01:32:12,199 --> 01:32:16,579
â™« Throw your arms about me

1593
01:32:16,575 --> 01:32:20,325
â™« Like a net cast to the sea

1594
01:32:22,651 --> 01:32:27,451
â™« Tell me your thoughts about me

1595
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:30,750
â™« Tell me you'll never leave

1596
01:32:30,746 --> 01:32:34,906
â™« You'll never leave, you'll never leave

1597
01:32:40,234 --> 01:32:43,734
â™« Place your lips to mine

1598
01:32:44,626 --> 01:32:48,286
â™« Like a flower loves a bee

1599
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:54,401
â™« Tell me your dreams about me

1600
01:32:55,578 --> 01:32:59,608
â™« Make sure that I believe

1601
01:32:59,609 --> 01:33:02,859
â™« I believe, I believe

1602
01:33:08,345 --> 01:33:12,925
â™« Raise your legs and squeeze me

1603
01:33:12,929 --> 01:33:16,679
â™« Like a spider eats the fly

1604
01:33:18,729 --> 01:33:22,229
â™« Tell your desires of me

1605
01:33:23,504 --> 01:33:27,354
â™« And tell me the reason why

1606
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:31,442
â™« The reason why, the reason why

1607
01:33:36,856 --> 01:33:39,606
(harmonica solo)

1608
01:34:02,568 --> 01:34:05,818
â™« Hold your love to me

1609
01:34:07,072 --> 01:34:11,162
â™« Like the sun pinned to the sky

1610
01:34:12,704 --> 01:34:16,624
â™« Show me your feelings for me

1611
01:34:17,456 --> 01:34:21,576
â™« And swear that you'll always be mine

1612
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:25,673
â™« Always be mine, always be mine

1613
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:49,932
â™« Give me your (mumbles)

1614
01:34:49,928 --> 01:34:53,928
â™« Like blood clots in your head

1615
01:34:55,672 --> 01:35:00,592
â™« Tell me the days you'll love me

1616
01:35:00,592 --> 01:35:04,122
â™« And make sure I understand

1617
01:35:04,122 --> 01:35:07,872
â™« I understand, I understand

1618
01:35:13,626 --> 01:35:17,126
â™« Speak these words to me

1619
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:22,090
â™« Like the gospel spoke unto you

1620
01:35:23,538 --> 01:35:27,368
â™« And I'll believe your story

1621
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:32,569
â™« And know that you'll be true

1622
01:35:32,569 --> 01:35:36,739
â™« You'll be true, you'll be true â™«
