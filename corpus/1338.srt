1
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,610
Metal Cannon!

2
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,620
Fist of One Hundred Beasts

3
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,800
So, you want to live?

4
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,880
I...

5
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,610
Even if I were to take your X-Antibody...

6
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,630
...I still wouldn't live any longer.

7
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,050
You have good eyes...

8
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,050
Live for me in this new world.

9
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,150
Carry on, for our future.

10
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,920
I'm sorry to have chased you.

11
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,320
Get lost!

12
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,800
You aren't the chosen!

13
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,280
Because a Digimon like you appeared, with a strange stone on his forehead,

14
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,750
Andromon said the world is going to hell!

15
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,350
Get outta here!

16
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,550
Get lost!

17
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,590
That's enough.

18
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,210
Why... am I here...?

19
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,100
Why am I unwanted?

20
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,140
Why am I not needed...?

21
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,340
Still...

22
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,370
Why...!?

23
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,720
You think it's possible we Royal Knights can execute Project Ark?

24
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,380
It is not a matter of whether we can or cannot...

25
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,500
That is for Yggdrasil to determine.

26
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,460
We only have to fulfill our mission.

27
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,490
And will that work out...?

28
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,410
What do you mean?

29
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,540
Will we not just repeat our mistakes?

30
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,680
Are you saying that Yggdrasil is wrong?

31
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,420
The start of the Digital Hazard...

32
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,260
The X-Program my Lord Yggdrasil will execute.

33
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,720
I, Dukemon, would never--

34
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,730
X-Antibody Digimon and the like!

35
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,450
They are alien!

36
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,310
Such aliens will only bring ruin.

37
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,480
They and us...

38
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,280
We are all Digimon, are we not?

39
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,990
Please, hear me out!

40
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,860
We don't have time to bicker!

41
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,800
At this rate, all Digimon will be exterminated!

42
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Please don't say such things now...

43
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,630
Isn't it your fault that this crisis falls on us!?

44
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,780
That is wrong!

45
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,080
When the X-Program was complete, many of our friends died.

46
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,630
In fact 98% of all Digimon died.

47
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,530
In order to live... we had to flee to this new world.

48
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,140
And so you will contaminate this world as well...

49
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,120
If you had never come here...

50
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,760
Are you saying it's OK if we're the only ones to die?

51
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,560
You don't care what happens to any other Digimon!?

52
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,020
Then what about you guys?

53
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,660
Because you've come here, this child is in danger!

54
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,010
Well...

55
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,870
Sorry...

56
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,360
But we really have no time to squabble.

57
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,870
You came here knowing that, didn't you?

58
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,890
Everything is because Yggdrasil's X-Program was executed.

59
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,710
Soon this new world will be contaminated.

60
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,580
Yggdrasil will begin hunting X-Antibody Digimon!

61
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,830
Lies!

62
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,670
They plan to wipe out all the X-Antibody Digimon.

63
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,350
And behind all that, the X-Program will take this world.

64
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,430
Which in turn means that Yggdrasil itself is our common enemy, right?

65
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,890
You hold an interesting point...

66
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,290
But that's as far as it goes.

67
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,130
Before coming here, we reported it to Yggdrasil...

68
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,280
This is where you'll end.

69
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,980
How could you!?

70
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,610
Our meeting is over!

71
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,490
Everyone, get away from here!

72
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,830
Run!

73
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,910
Great Spirit!

74
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,060
Fool...

75
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,930
This would have never happened if you hadn't reported.

76
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,580
Don't tell me...

77
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,410
Even us?

78
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,000
I see...

79
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,040
You also have the X-Antibody...

80
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,090
It must have been hard for you.

81
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,210
As a friend, I have a favour to ask you.

82
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,570
Friend...?

83
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,450
That's right.

84
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,610
I'm sure you've realized...

85
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,940
I also have the X-Antibody.

86
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,950
We don't have much time.

87
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,490
I will be back.

88
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,810
Before I return, could you look after this child?

89
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,820
Please, protect this child.

90
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,940
Don't worry, I'm sure you can do it.

91
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,150
Okay.

92
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,800
Thank you.

93
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,780
Wasn't that a Royal Knight?

94
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,480
Why is one of the Network leaders...?

95
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,930
That hurts!

96
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,050
Poseidon Force!

97
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,820
Clever...

98
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,110
Return to Yggdrasil immediately.

99
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,450
It's an emergency.

100
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,000
Omegamon, present!

101
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,560
Well, let us begin...

102
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,750
Golden Magnamon.

103
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,690
Urd Terminal, Skuld Terminal...

104
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,640
The resistance groups have formed.

105
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,860
I have seen them.

106
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,580
Similar groups have formed in the Versandi Terminal as well.

107
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,670
Even in Versandi?

108
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,500
Correct.

109
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,260
Certainly...

110
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,760
Those X-Antibody Digimon intend to fight us Royal Knights squarely.

111
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,030
It's a matter of who moves first.

112
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,650
That is right...

113
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,570
What do you mean, Omegamon?

114
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,610
That we must take emergency countermeasures against this resistance.

115
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,330
However--!

116
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,650
Our mission is to guide Project Ark's course.

117
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,140
Yggdrasil's decision is final.

118
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,940
Do not waver!

119
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,690
Then it's futile...

120
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,900
Those Royal Knights...

121
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,490
They sure are strong.

122
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,880
Are they really our enemies?

123
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,320
Fool.

124
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,350
What have you been looking at recently?

125
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,600
The Royal Knights only move in accordance to Yggdrasil.

126
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,590
I don't think they'd move on their own.

127
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,130
It wouldn't solve anything.

128
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
And if it's as you say...

129
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,880
Yet it is not.

130
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,480
If the Host Computer wants to kill off all Digimon with this stone...

131
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,670
Then those Royal Knights will comply!

132
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,210
What has happened to the Royal Knights the Digimon were proud of!?

133
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,900
Well...

134
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,830
Still, I...

135
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,720
I want to believe in the Royal Knights!

136
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,170
Whatever Yggdrasil is planning...

137
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,390
We will find that out soon enough.

138
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,310
Are you okay?

139
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,510
Yes~! Mon!

140
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,800
That's good.

141
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,720
I'm just doing what I can.

142
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,680
Metal Cannon!

143
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,380
I'm no match for him...

144
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,870
They know this is futile...

145
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,730
Why do they still come!?

146
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,240
Why...

147
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,940
Garuru Tomahawk!

148
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,800
Are you all right?

149
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,470
I kept... my promise...

150
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,670
Is this the justice of the Royal Knights!?

151
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,570
It is the justice of Yggdrasil's New Digital World!

152
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,520
Garuru Burst!

153
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,220
Gaia Force!

154
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,470
Cocytus Breath!

155
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,500
Not bad.

156
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,190
However, this is the end.

157
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,090
This child--!

158
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,140
This child is dead!!!

159
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,310
Grey Sword!

160
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,800
The X-Program was completed...?

161
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,120
Don't worry.

162
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,270
I will soon die.

163
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,610
I will give this child my X-Antibody.

164
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,300
Do you want to live?

165
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,370
Please live on for me.

166
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,330
Live for me in this new world.

167
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,580
Life is just that beautiful...

168
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,440
I give this to you.

169
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,000
Power Metal!

170
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,650
Why?

171
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,160
Why do you go to such lengths to fight!?

172
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,030
Because I want to live!

173
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,640
I just want to live.

174
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,590
Even if it's just to extend my life a bit more...

175
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,960
I just want to live!

176
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,630
Yggdrasil...

177
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,630
...doesn't want that.

178
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,500
This lance--?

179
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,800
Give up, Omegamon...

180
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,050
I have not come to fight.

181
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,340
I have something to ask you.

182
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,620
Why was the X-Program launched...?

183
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,280
Do you want to know the reason?

184
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,380
Dukemon! What are you saying!?

185
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,530
Yggdrasil set off the sudden extermination of Digimon...

186
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,840
It made its decision on the Old World.

187
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,250
There is nothing to hide...

188
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,380
That's right.

189
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,740
Only a number of Digimon were chosen to come to this world...

190
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,980
...and only a certain number of Digimon will be able to advance.

191
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,770
Project Ark.

192
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,060
The X-Program was set off just for that?

193
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,770
So, you know that name...

194
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,310
However, some of us lived.

195
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,160
And those were the ones that came here.

196
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,670
Both the chosen Digimon, and the surviving Digimon... are they not all Digimon!?

197
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,700
That is wrong!

198
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,320
You are outsiders.

199
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,020
That is what Yggdrasil decided.

200
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,830
Omegamon!

201
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,720
You need not answer.

202
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,950
Yggdrasil's decision will soon reach this level.

203
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,530
What do you mean?

204
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,340
Yggdrasil has passed Project Ark to the secondary stage.

205
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,570
It will delete all Digimon.

206
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,410
How dare you!

207
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,150
That is classified information!

208
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,470
It matters not...

209
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:39,300
Both the chosen Digimon and you X-Antibody Digimon...

210
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,130
Everything will be erased.

211
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,640
To go that far--!

212
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,900
It is by my Lord Yggdrasil's command...

213
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,370
To see it carried out is the duty of us Royal Knights.

214
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,250
However, I, Dukemon, refuse!

215
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,900
You would betray Him?

216
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,420
Rather than betray my own emotions...

217
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,540
I would defy Yggdrasil.

218
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,320
I cannot help it.

219
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,870
Next time we meet, will we be enemies?

220
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,060
Too bad...

221
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,910
My dear friend, Omegamon!

222
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,040
Is there not something you want to ask to heed my defiance?

223
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,900
I will see.

224
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,580
I wish to give them a chance.

225
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,290
I will never forget this pain...

226
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,380
I waited for you, Dukemon...

227
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,500
I guess we cannot come to an understanding.

228
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,610
I bid thee adieu...

229
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,610
I cannot allow anyone to hinder Yggdrasil.

230
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,820
I will not let my heart interfere either.

231
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,310
Very well!

232
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,420
Y...You--!

233
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,500
This is the only way...

234
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,930
I have something I want to check...

235
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,780
Don't let it get to you...

236
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:09,950
What is it?

237
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,700
What is it?

238
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,970
Dukemon...

239
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,620
You look depressed...

240
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,100
Magnamon...

241
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,260
Do you hold any regrets in the battle you pursue?

242
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,070
No.

243
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,300
That confidence comes from...?

244
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,750
My will to fulfill my duty in protecting this world...

245
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,550
...as well as my pride as a Royal Knight.

246
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,530
I asked an unnecessary thing.

247
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,200
Forget it.

248
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,490
Tokomon!?

249
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,800
Stay away!

250
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,320
Tokomon...!

251
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,550
Are you Dorugamon?

252
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,990
Don't--!

253
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,560
Disappear!

254
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,590
Power Metal!

255
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,840
That attitude which drove you to fire...

256
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,450
Whatever.

257
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,060
You brought Dorugamon to Yggdrasil?

258
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,770
Why?

259
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,350
Yggdrasil commanded it.

260
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,810
What?

261
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,150
I merely returned it.

262
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,610
Dorugamon...

263
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,480
No, Dorumon...

264
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,330
...is not a digital being born in our world.

265
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,490
He is Yggdrasil's experimental being.

266
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,980
That is Yggdrasil's very words.

267
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,330
For what...?

268
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,350
Who knows.

269
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,280
I do not understand Yggdrasil's reasoning.

270
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,960
We Royal Knights...

271
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,460
...have perhaps gone too far...

272
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,800
Dukemon...

273
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,300
Where has your Core gone...?

274
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,030
What was it that you wanted to check?

275
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,920
And this reasoning of Yggdrasil's...

276
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:21,020
There is still much that I do not know...

277
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,890
Where's Dorugamon!?

278
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,320
He's not with you?

279
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,770
R...Royal Knights!

280
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,330
The Royal Knights did something?

281
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,680
No one will hurt you here, don't worry.

282
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,890
You don't need to cry...

283
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,910
Hey!

284
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,860
What?

285
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,230
You must be blind...

286
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,230
Just leave him.

287
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,610
He's probably going for disassembly anyway.

288
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,630
I can't leave something I've found.

289
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,420
Even if he's not alive... I won't leave him.

290
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,210
Don't come crying to me for help...

291
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,180
You know what he is, right?

292
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,600
I just heard from WarGreymon.

293
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,260
He was looking for info on a pal the Royal Knights were after.

294
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,690
In any case, this guy's unique.

295
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,130
He's wanted?

296
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,350
That's what WarGreymon said.

297
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,210
So?

298
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,240
You think we should tell him he's here?

299
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,420
If WarGreymon is looking for him, then we'll let him know.

300
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,520
But I'm afraid the Royal Knights will find out where we are...

301
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,650
WarGreymon knows the risk...

302
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,040
I'll believe in his decision.

303
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,190
Even if it puts all our friends here in danger!?

304
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,680
Have you forgotten what kind of era we live in!?

305
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,840
All our friends in the Digital World are in danger anyway.

306
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,820
I can't think that any one of us is safe.

307
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,740
Fine.

308
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,100
Well, I'll let WarGreymon know!

309
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,650
Don't worry!

310
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,230
I'm sure he's fine!

311
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,710
He won't die so easily.

312
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,920
Yeah! Not so easily!

313
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,290
We're gonna speed up, so hang on tight!

314
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,030
Top Gun!

315
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,300
Get away from the entrance!

316
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,150
Escape further inside!

317
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,700
Leave that guy!

318
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,420
If I was gonna leave him, I wouldn't have picked him up in the first place.

319
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,670
Go on without me.

320
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,570
Lead everyone to the secret platform.

321
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,560
I'll follow behind the rear.

322
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,190
Why do you go to such lengths for this guy!?

323
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,430
I won't let a friend die...

324
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,680
That's all.

325
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,230
What are you waiting for!?

326
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,090
Move it!

327
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,240
Metal!

328
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,930
Metal! Go!

329
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,290
I'll take care of this.

330
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,260
Evacuate everyone!

331
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,140
But--!

332
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,190
Too many are injured!

333
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,830
If this keeps up, this fight will be meaningless!

334
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,080
I'll follow later!

335
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,490
Don't worry!

336
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,740
Fall back to the platform!

337
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,960
Help carry the injured if you can!

338
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,950
Cocytus Breath!

339
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,300
We'll be waiting for you!

340
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,940
Now it's time for me to go wild!

341
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,180
We'll be safe once we pass here.

342
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,500
Don't rush.

343
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,810
Stay calm and go.

344
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,130
This way!

345
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,540
Yeah...

346
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,520
There's a platform up ahead that leads to the hidden road.

347
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,280
There is?

348
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,280
Here...!

349
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,750
This is bad...

350
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,970
Stay here until I tell you to.

351
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,580
Agreed?

352
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,010
Okay!

353
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,570
Good kid...

354
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,370
Keep it orderly!

355
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,640
This way! Over here!

356
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,970
You...

357
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,920
The least I can do is shoot one!

358
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,700
Don't push yourself.

359
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,600
You too.

360
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,120
It's me!

361
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,750
Those who can fight, move out!

362
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,260
We'll back up WarGreymon!

363
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,030
MetalGarurumon?

364
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,090
He stayed behind to fight off the enemies...

365
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,770
He gave us the time to escape.

366
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,160
Please... wait for him!

367
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:39,710
What's this?

368
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,540
Did something happen to the exit?

369
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,680
At this rate...!

370
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,600
No!

371
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,430
I promised him!

372
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,780
I said I'd wait for him.

373
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:56,560
But--!

374
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,260
He'll come!

375
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,030
I'm sure of it!

376
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,290
Wait!

377
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,350
Nice timing.

378
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,300
Here too!?

379
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,960
Take care of him...

380
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,230
Thunder Cloud!

381
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:10,980
Mon! There!

382
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,230
Tokomon!

383
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,100
You survived!

384
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,580
Sorry for making you worry.

385
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,280
Poseidon Force!

386
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:47,740
Wake up!

387
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,310
Mon! Please, wake up!

388
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,430
Tokomon?

389
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:22,960
Why...?

390
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,260
Why?

391
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,400
Hang in there!

392
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:37,830
STOP!!!

393
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,130
What the hell are you!?

394
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,610
You...!

395
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,200
We saved you!?

396
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,760
What?

397
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,940
I-I'm...

398
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,170
I'm...

399
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:32,210
Why...?

400
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:40,090
Is this the result of the experimental being?

401
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:49,040
Why... this form...

402
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:02,820
I must...

403
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,300
It's still him...

404
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:14,990
Mon!

405
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,260
Everyone stay calm!

406
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,830
He just assumed their form...

407
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,290
There has to be a reason behind it!

408
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,710
His heart is still with us!

409
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:03,750
So, that's it...

410
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,480
Yggdrasil has seen the future.

411
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:16,860
This is what we Royal Knights speculated with Project Ark's deployment.

412
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:18,700
This is the outcome.

413
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,870
And this is in accordance with the deployment?

414
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,010
What Dukemon meant about the "mistakes"...

415
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,530
And you agree?

416
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,000
I will make certain of Yggdrasil's decision!

417
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,170
Wait! Omegamon!

418
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,640
Final Elysion!

419
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:13,220
I, Dukemon, have returned from the Data Space.

420
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,390
WarGreymon, MetalGarurumon...

421
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,220
Lead them all away!

422
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:33,150
Dorugremon and I shall take care of the rest here!

423
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,200
Let's go!

424
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:41,720
Understood!

425
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,590
Those that can fly, cover those that can't!

426
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,660
Once we clear the wall, we'll head for the forest!

427
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:48,820
Right!

428
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,330
I'll be all right...

429
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:51,760
Head somewhere safe.

430
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,070
Mon!

431
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:57,990
I'll come as soon as I can...

432
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:59,510
I promise.

433
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:02,980
I'll leave the rest to you!

434
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,150
Royal Saber!

435
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,590
You were all right!

436
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,580
So, you worried...

437
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:38,290
I...

438
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:43,820
Is it truly okay for me to still be alive?

439
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:49,570
If I were dead... then things wouldn't be like this!

440
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:55,990
You wish that I, Dukemon, should answer that?

441
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,010
What the hell am I?

442
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,510
Why the hell am I here!?

443
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:06,140
Everything has the will to live.

444
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:12,150
From the very first time life existed, that much has not changed...

445
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,090
Dorugremon!

446
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:22,880
Go to Yggdrasil!

447
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,190
Do you not want to know who you really are?

448
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,200
You will find all your answers there.

449
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:58,110
What has happened to Yggdrasil even I, Dukemon, do not know...

450
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:01,130
However, the only way in is there!

451
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:02,420
But--!

452
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,790
I, Dukemon, am enough to hold them here.

453
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:11,880
You must go to my Lord Yggdrasil.

454
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:17,270
Should I, Dukemon, fall... then that is my own sought answer.

455
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:24,700
I'll go!

456
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,130
It's futile, Omegamon!

457
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,650
No one can touch Yggdrasil!

458
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:05,530
Intangible things are troublesome.

459
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,260
I have vowed my loyalty to Yggdrasil...

460
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,980
However, that is why I have said I cannot tolerate my master's motives.

461
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,260
Selfishness does not become you.

462
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,410
Then what is this chaos!?

463
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,730
That is...

464
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,650
Why are you here?

465
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,760
This is not a place for one like you...

466
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:46,040
Leave this place this instant!

467
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:50,750
Dukemon opened the path for me...

468
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:52,360
Dukemon?

469
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,020
I came to find the answer...

470
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,800
I want to see Yggdrasil!

471
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,130
There is nothing to ask.

472
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:03,420
Interesting...

473
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:05,840
Impossible!

474
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:12,120
You want to meet Yggdrasil, whom even the Royal Knights cannot touch?

475
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:18,080
On top of that, the one who opened the path for you was my dear friend Dukemon...?

476
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,720
Then, before you reach that answer...

477
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:25,580
...you must defeat me!

478
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,030
I will fulfill your wish if you do so...

479
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:31,710
Defeat you!? No--!

480
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:45,940
Why must you always get so emotional?

481
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,910
He may be Yggdrasil's experiment...

482
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,100
But didn't I say he was not a digital being?

483
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,260
No...

484
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,490
I think he and I are on the same wavelength...

485
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:06,920
Then, whichever one of us reaches Yggdrasil's Core and grasps that answer... that will be fine.

486
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:12,390
That fact that Dukemon opened the path for you has further meaning.

487
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,410
Show me your true form!

488
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:17,480
Wait...

489
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:19,250
There's no time!

490
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:22,840
If I don't hurry up, the Digital World will--!

491
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:28,600
Are you saying that when you meet Yggdrasil and find your answer...

492
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,450
...the Digital World will be saved!?

493
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,100
How conceited!

494
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:43,460
You think you can do what I could not...

495
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:45,920
What is waiting for us at Yggdrasil!?

496
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,780
No...!

497
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:49,930
I  don't want to fight...!

498
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,140
I have no reason to fight you!

499
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,160
If you do not, then I do...

500
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:00,910
For what did you come here for?

501
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,870
For the existence of everything!

502
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,660
Then, fight...

503
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:11,610
Being prepared is more than just words.

504
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:15,710
Prove that you came here ready to die for the existence of everything!

505
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,610
You aren't the one I want to fight!

506
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,490
So you still say that?

507
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,160
Then who is it?

508
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,230
That's what I want to find out by meeting Yggdrasil!

509
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,210
What are you saying!?

510
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,420
Any intruder would have been destroyed.

511
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,290
Tell us what we want to know!

512
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,920
The Royal Knights protect the order of the Digital World...

513
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:07,400
For one like you to approach Yggdrasil would oppose that order!

514
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,350
This is the end.

515
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:27,990
Live for me in this new world.

516
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:31,470
Please, live on for me.

517
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:35,460
Carry on, for our future.

518
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,630
Life is just that beautiful...

519
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,840
You must go to my Lord Yggdrasil.

520
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:49,320
Should I, Dukemon, fall... then that is my own sought answer.

521
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,090
Light!

522
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,640
You are?

523
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,020
It can't be...!

524
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,030
I am Alphamon.

525
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,400
That's impossible!

526
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:31,970
While I'm looking at Alphamon... such was said to never exist!

527
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:32,880
An apparition...

528
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,000
A legend among the Royal Knights!

529
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,590
Even so, here I stand.

530
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:43,350
And thanks to you, I now know what I must do...

531
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:49,920
I cannot excuse Yggdrasil's intervention in this...

532
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:56,160
Dukemon led you here for that reason...

533
01:03:58,370 --> 01:03:59,380
I have confirmed...

534
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,190
...and I will acknowledge you.

535
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,270
Come, and together we will bear witness.

536
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:10,280
Stop!

537
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,670
The Royal Knights are to protect the order of the Digital World.

538
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,130
For the future, that is what you always said!

539
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:17,720
Is this order?

540
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:20,370
Seems you have only just realized...

541
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:24,870
When the order of the Digital World begins to collapse,

542
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:29,180
Yggdrasil's order is something to be concerned about.

543
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:32,520
The Royal Knights never move unless told...

544
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:34,760
You will still go without waiting for such a gracious command!?

545
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,300
I will go.

546
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,930
Just as my dear friend Dukemon would have done.

547
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:43,660
This is troublesome...

548
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,730
Our friends are in trouble.

549
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,990
All Digimon face a state of crisis...

550
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:52,520
Yet you still hold high your holy words.

551
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:20,460
No...

552
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,240
It is because we <i>are</i> in a state of crisis.

553
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:25,180
Order is necessary.

554
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:22,610
Who are you!?

555
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,660
This is...

556
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,680
Digitalize of Soul!

557
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:15,590
Let us go.

558
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:04,800
This is... Yggdrasil?

559
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:08,410
I wish to see Yggdrasil.

560
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,430
Where is your Core?

561
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,770
What are you really trying to accomplish?

562
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:15,730
I wish to know as well.

563
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:22,480
Why must Project Ark be executed with such overpowering force?

564
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:28,450
Yggdrasil...

565
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:32,600
If you intend on remaining silent, you better prepare yourself.

566
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:41,750
No matter what we do, there is no way we'll get out in one piece.

567
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:47,460
Magnamon has already warned Yggdrasil of our coming.

568
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,630
We are traitors.

569
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:22,690
If Yggdrasil insists on remaining silent, then there is only one option.

570
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:26,140
This might be the end of everything...

571
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:31,580
Then, what will we learn from this?

572
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:33,520
There is only one thing I'm sure of.

573
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:39,270
No matter what we do, at this rate, the Digital World will be destroyed.

574
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,820
Then...

575
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,820
We cannot stand idly by.

576
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,250
Ultimate War Blade King Dragon Sword

577
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,790
So that's how it is...

578
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,020
What is the meaning of this?

579
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:10,920
I entrust this to you...

580
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,380
I can't, but what about...

581
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,900
He is my shadow...

582
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:25,190
If I hadn't met my friends... I wouldn't have become this.

583
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:27,630
I might have been just like him.

584
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:35,010
However, I am proud to have met you all in this Digital World.

585
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:40,060
I give my life over to you...

586
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:12,160
Yggdrasil!

587
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:16,480
Is this what you wish for!?

588
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:21,630
I still do not understand...

589
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:23,670
But I will settle this!

590
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:34,320
All Delete!

591
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:24,210
I remember up until then...

592
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:28,060
Yggdrasil was also desperate...

593
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:34,510
I'm finally beginning to understand the reason behind Project Ark.

594
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:36,080
I'm listening...

595
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:42,970
My Lord, Yggdrasil, generally intervened with this world...

596
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:48,740
However, the world is a complex place...

597
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:53,810
This is where it thought about "fixing" it.

598
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:57,090
And that is Project Ark...?

599
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:58,600
Most likely...

600
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:06,450
However, my Lord didn't have the power to carry it out on its own.

601
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:12,080
And that's why it thought up that experimental being.

602
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:17,010
In the end, we were also merely pawns of Yggdrasil's?

603
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:18,490
As I said before...

604
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:21,760
Yggdrasil was desperate.

605
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:25,590
Most likely, like you, it only wanted to live...

606
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,540
Just like all life has this desperation to live...?

607
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:35,530
From now on, they can be happy...

608
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:03,460
I was looking for you!

609
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:05,660
Mon!
