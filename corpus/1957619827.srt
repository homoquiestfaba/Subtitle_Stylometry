00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,203
- All right, hold it!

21
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,037
Listen up.

22
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,441
There's no more
choppers at the airport.

23
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,843
Now get us out of here.

24
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,011
You guys make sure
  you look around.

25
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,046
You don't leave nothing
for Charlie, okay?

26

(guns firing)

40
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,882
Move, move, move!

(explosions booming)

48
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,268
- Jimmy T!

49
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,179
Come on!

50
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,413
Go, go, go, go!

51
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,394
(speaking foreign language)

52
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,826
- Gonzo, you all set
 with the code books?

53
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,294
- Yeah.

54
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,463
Let's get this stuff
 down to Mr. Henderson.

55
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,799
Help me with this stuff.

56
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,734
Let's go.

57
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,143
- This makes a man
  sicker than shit.

58
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,419
That the last of it, Gonzo?

59
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,686
- Almost, Chief.

60
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,556
- You still pulling out
at 18:00, Mr. Henderson?

61
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,059
- If Ben has set the charges
 by then, we're out of here.

62
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,431
- Go fetch the rest, Gonzo.

63
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,267
- Aye-aye, Chief.

64
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,370
- Thomas, if I find
 anything readable

65
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,739
in there when it's
 done, it's your ass.

66
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,573
- Aye-aye, Chief.

67
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,917
- I don't know.

68
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,385
I was getting to like it here.

69
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,995
Goddamn it.

70
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,336
- Well, let's just make
 sure we're not the last two

71
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,605
to die in this hell hole, okay?

72
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,607
- [Chief] Aye-aye to that, Sam.

73
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,110
(tense music)

74
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,057
- I lost my glasses.

75
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:40,793
- Hey, come on, you guys!

76
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,627
Let's go!

77
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,501
- I wanna go home.

78
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,342
- Come on, come on.

79
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,516
- Did you check him?

80
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,389
(explosion booms)

81
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,061
- [Soldier] What the?

82
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,730
What are they doing?

83
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:20,966
- Come on!

84
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,301
Come back!

85
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,736
Come back!

86
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,238
(tense music)

87
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,547
(woman crying)

88
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,217
(speaking foreign language)

89
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,749
(man yelling)

90
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:46,051
(explosions booming)

91
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,322
(guns firing)

92
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,927
- [Soldier] Incoming!

93
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,696
(explosions booming)

94
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:58,697
You mothers!

95
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,535
(men shouting)

96
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,373
(guns firing)

97
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,409
(explosions booming)

98
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,012
- [Soldier] I need a stretcher!

99
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,185
(guns firing)

100
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,020
- Three-five, Binh.

101
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,421
Give me Three-Five.

102
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,289
- Come in.

103
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,623
Come in Three-Five.

104
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:29,061
Come in.

105
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,464
(explosions booming)

106
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,200
(man yelling)

107
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,869
- Where's our goddamn air cover?

108
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,105
(guns firing)

109
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,006
- That's it!

110
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,374
Hey, pull back!

111
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,208
Pull back!

112
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,780
(men shouting)

113
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,553
- [Soldier] Fall back!

114
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,488
Start getting down!

115
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,823
Get under cover!

116
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,860
- Tango Victor Three-Five,
  this is Bravo Three-Seven.

117
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,928
Come in Three-Five.

118
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:03,762
Come in.

119
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:04,596
- Go ahead, Three-Seven.

120
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,597
This is Three-Five.

121
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,999
- I need a medevac, Three-Five.

122
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,168
And where the
 hell's my air cover?

123
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,136
- Request temporarily
 denied, Three-Seven.

124
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,271
No can do.

125
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,806
- Three-Five, this is Holland.

126
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,541
I've got wounded up here and
 I can't hang on much longer.

127
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,242
You're gonna have to
  pack up 40 more body bags

128
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,178
if I don't get some
 help up here and now.

129
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,113
- [Soldier] Zebra One,
 this is Alpha Tango.

130
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,314
We've been overrun.

131
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,383
I repeat, we've been overrun.

132
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,318
The enemy's taken
  over the village.

133
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,820
- [Soldier] Move it, damn it!

134
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,088
I said, move it, soldier!

135
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,923
- I don't need this shit.

136
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,458
- [Soldier] Let's go!

137
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,059
Get the lead out, damn it!
  - I don't need this shit!

138
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,796
(helicopter blades whirring)

139
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,214
- In my estimation, now's
 the time to finish 'em off,

140
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,915
but my hands are
  ties on this one.

141
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,687
A Company from 101st Armored
 Division's on the move

142
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,390
and we're gonna have to move
 way faster than this, Captain.

143
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,258
VC have taken the city of Wet.

144
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,526
They took the radio station

145
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,495
and they blasted the
 Presidential Palace.

146
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,031
Counting on you to get
  Bravo Company out of here.

147
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,098
Let's go, Captain.

148
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:13,932
Good luck.

149
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:14,833
Let's get moving.

150
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,377
- Their defenses
are in shambles.

151
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,348
Their morale, broken.

152
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,017
Very soon the South will fall.

153
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,252
(men cheering)

154
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,453
- [Soldier] To victory!

155
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,721
- Are we ready to
 march through Saigon?

156
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,156
(men cheering)

157
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,625
- [Soldier] Bash anybody
who stands in your way!

158
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,559
To victory!

159
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,904
(subdued music)

160
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,783
(horn honks)

161
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,988
(people chattering)

162
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,934
(horn honking)

163
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,207
- Come on, you guys.

164
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,208
Move it!

165
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,042
Let's go!

166
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,882
I know if this captain's
gonna wait for us.

167
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,250
- I know.
  - Come on!

168
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,618
- But I don't think
 they'll wait for us.

169
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,886
- They better wait for us.

170
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,287
Otherwise, I don't know
how the hell we're gonna

171
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,389
get out of here
  and up to Saigon.

172
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,792
(horn honks)

173
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,461
(siren wailing)

174
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,099
(people chattering)

175
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,740
(horn honking)

176
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,574
- [Soldier] Stop!

177
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,408
Stop!

178
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,012
- What's going on?

179
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:07,946
- [Soldier] The road is closed.

180
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:08,914
You cannot pass this way.

181
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,182
- [Woman] Fuck!

182
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,456
- Where are we going?

183
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,557
- Just keep going straight.

184
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,393
We've gotta get
  to HQ to find Len.

185
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,662
- HQ?

186
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,030
- Yeah, maybe he can help us.

187
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,864
- Okay.

188
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:26,698
- Could you just move?

189
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,367
Can't you go faster?

190
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,539
(horn honking)

191
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,406
Back it up!

192
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,240
Move it!

193
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,777
Can't you back it up?

194
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,178
I mean, just move!

195
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,013
What are doing?

196
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:41,847
Get away!

197
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,015
No, get away!

198
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,316
Let's go!

199
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,184
Stop it!

200
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,418
What are they doing?

201
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,252
Just stop!

202
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,589
Move, move!

203
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,025
Just stop it!

204
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,226
Get your hand out of the window!

205
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,194
- [Man] We've gotta
 get out of here.

206
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,128
- Leave us alone!

207
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,463
We're not doing anything!

208
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,298
Stop!

209
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,166
- Come on.

210
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,267
Come with me.

211
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,102
Come on!

212
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:10,342
(speaking foreign language)

213
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:15,214
(people shouting)

214
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,715
Come on, this way.

215
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,089
Come on.

216
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,157
Hurry, hurry!

217
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,160
Go!

218
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,369
Inside, inside!

219
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,578
(banging on door)

220
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,688
- Children, go to your rooms.

221
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,295
(wolf whistles)

222
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,329
- Hey, baby.

223
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,530
How about some action?

224
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:17,476
- Welcome to the Church
of Our Lady of Lord.

225
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,310
- Thank you.

226
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,012
He's a...

227
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,948
He's a pretty smooth talker.

228
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,519
- Mickey picked up quite a lot
 from his mother's clientele.

229
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,689
Are you a photographer?

230
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,258
- No.

231
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,760
Actually, I'm down here
shooting a documentary

232
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,861
on Len Jordan.

233
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,865
Now we're just hoping
he can help us get out.

234
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,334
But first, we have
  to get up to HQ.

235
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,136
- God works in mysterious ways.

236
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,771
I believe we can
help each other.

237
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,873
- Let's go home, boys.

238
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,109
Let's head due south.

239
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:51,910
Let's move.

240
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:55,947
Let's go!

241
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,620
(subdued music)

242
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,369
- Five, four, three, two.

243
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,439
(explosions booming)

244
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,635
- 7th Fleet for you, Sam.

245
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,647
- Jehovah, this is Able Team.

246
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,116
- [Man On Radio] Able
 Team, this is Jehovah.

247
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,017
You are instructed to
 go back to Soc Trang

248
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,452
to pick up Len Jordan.

249
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,321
Repeat, pick up Len Jordan.

250
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,590
- Roger.

251
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,999
We've gotta turn around
and go get Len Jordan

252
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:21,933
out of Soc Trang.

253
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,002
- Fuck.

254
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,238
Let him grab a chopper.

255
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,440
- He's bringing full dossiers

256
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,641
of all the locals
  that helped us.

257
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,243
- Can he hang on
 until we get there?

258
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,277
- He's gonna have to.

259
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,980
- I hope he has
 enough fuel up there.

260
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,382
Fuck, we've got hardly
 enough gas and ammo as it is.

261
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,251
- What the hell, Gonzo?

262
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,153
We did come here to
 fight a war, right?

263
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,420
- Fuck that hero shit.

264
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:47,659
- Let's go get him.

265
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:54,833
- All right.

266
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,770
Probably take us a
 day to make it to sea.

267
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,572
They're be a chopper there.

268
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,441
Hopefully, the Navy
 will send a ship.

269
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,044
Take us back to the real world.

270
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,183
(speaking foreign language)

271
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,685
(tense music)

272
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,588
(engine sputtering)

273
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,806
- [Man] Hello, GI.

274
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:44,576
Hello.

275
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:47,913
Hello, GI.

276
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:50,882
Hello.

277
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:51,783
(guns firing)

278
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:52,617
- Shit!

279
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,212
(men yell)

280
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:28,553
(speaking foreign language)

281
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,025
(explosions booming)

282
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,427
- Spin it, Chief.

283
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,732
(guns firing)

284
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,660
(explosion booms)

285
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,410
(explosion booms)

286
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,422
- Let's hope your Len
 Jordan is a miracle worker.

287
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,858
(kid crying)

288
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,963
(explosions booming)

289
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,103
(guns firing)

290
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:00,011
(speaking foreign language)

291
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,086
- There's Len.

292
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:08,987
Follow him.

293
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:14,192
(tense music)

294
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,331
- Something's up ahead.

295
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,277
- [Man] GI!

296
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,111
GI!

297
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:35,980
GI!

298
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,950
- [Woman] Hello, GI.

299
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,585
Hello.

300
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:41,419
- Binh.

301
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,826
(people shouting)

302
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,537
- South China's about to fall!

303
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,875
(explosion booms)

304
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,347
(guns firing)

305
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:23,094
(explosions booming)

306
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,535
- Don't cry.

307
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,137
It'll be all right.

308
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,744
(speaking foreign language)

309
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,814
(explosions booming)

310
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,987
(kids screaming)

311
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,835
(explosion booms)

312
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,136
- We lost the other truck.

313
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:20,018
(speaking foreign language)

314
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,677
- [Sam] Jordan, it's a
 pleasure to meet you.

315
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,978
- Yeah, you too, Henderson.

316
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,316
- I thought there'd
 be more of you.

317
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,084
- Had a little trouble
 with the trucks.

318
00:30:58,756 --> 00:30:59,691
(explosion booms)

319
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,360
(kids screaming)

320
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,533
- [Woman] Okay, get the kids.

321
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,467
Get 'em, come on.

322
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,468
- [Man] Okay, come on.

323
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,070
- All right, kids.

324
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,605
Come on.

325
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,573
- Come on, come on.

326
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,242
All right, let's go.

327
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:20,612
Len!

328
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:24,716
Len!

329
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,787
- Mary.

330
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,190
- I've got these
Amaratian kids with me.

331
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,424
- Yeah?

332
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,926
- Their fathers are
 all in the States

333
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,462
and you know how the Vietnamese
feel about these kids.

334
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,130
I mean, what do you
 think's gonna happen

335
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,498
when the NVA takes over?

336
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,234
- Well, Mary.

337
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,068
- No, no, no, no.

338
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,303
Wait, this is great.

339
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,404
This is the ending
  to your story.

340
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,672
I mean, just think about it.

341
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,040
The last American to leave

342
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,842
and he takes all
 these kids with him.

343
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,145
- Oh, Mary, I'd
 really like to help.

344
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,114
I really would, but.

345
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,081
- It's okay.

346
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,784
We can go ahead and
 take 'em with us.

347
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:00,952
It's gonna slow us
  down a little bit.

348
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,954
We'll have to move
now, but it'll be okay.

349
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,022
- Good.

350
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,323
Who are you?

351
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,791
- I'm Sam Henderson,
 the skipper.

352
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:07,625
How you doing?

353
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:08,459
- Mary.

354
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,294
Fine.

355
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:12,897
So, it's okay?

356
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,436
- Come on, kids.

357
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,038
Move out.

358
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,707
(subdued music)

359
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:27,712
(explosion booms)

360
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,280
(kids scream)

361
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,249
(dramatic music)

362
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,352
(explosions booming)

363
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,000
- [Binh] Come on.

364
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,834
Hurry up.

365
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:50,668
Inside.

366
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,404
(dramatic music)

367
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:13,524
(speaking foreign language)

368
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,106
(tense music)

369
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,615
(guns firing)

370
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,385
(dramatic music)

371
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,297
- Hey, you're
 gonna have to move.

372
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:27,331
I can't see a thing.

373
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,566
- Just another minute.

374
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,034
The light's really
  good right now.

375
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,712
(engine revs)

376
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,482
Goddamn it!

377
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,616
I told you I'd be
 just another minute.

378
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:52,423
- Look, I am probably blowing
 my chance at immortality here,

379
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,624
but we've got a job to do.

380
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,126
It's called get the
 hell out of here

381
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,861
and your career is not a
  high priority on my list.

382
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:57,695
All right?

383
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,367
- Hey.

384
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,102
Why don't you just chill out?

385
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:06,904
Stay out of his face.

386
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,439
Go back and film the
 nun, and those kids,

387
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,540
and stuff for a while.

388
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,275
Okay?

389
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,682
(dramatic music)

390
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,803
What's going on
  here, Lieutenant?

391
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,037
- We've gotta go
  back another way.

392
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:42,607
- We gotta get the hell
out of here right now.

393
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,976
The fastest way is
straight down the river.

394
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,645
- Well, ordinarily
 I'd agree with you,

395
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,815
but on the way back up here we
 ran across some NVA sampans.

396
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,283
If they know we're around,

397
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,751
they're probably waiting right
 around the corner for us.

398
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,855
- You know, I'm still the
  senior officer here, son.

399
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,390
- No.

400
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,925
- What the hell you mean, no?

401
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,960
- You're not the
 senior officer here.

402
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,462
Look, Jordan.

403
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,863
I know you've been doing
  a bang-up job around here,

404
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:06,998
but you've gotta
 remember one thing.

405
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,566
You're ex-military.

406
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,434
The Comm 7th Fleet sent me
  back here to pick you up

407
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,969
and I gotta get you out.

408
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,638
If anything happens to you,
 they're gonna hang it on me.

409
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,540
So, we're gonna do
 things my way, okay?

410
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,910
- They're gonna hang
 your ass, Henderson.

411
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:31,756
(explosion booms)

412
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:36,394
- Off starboard!

413
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:39,330
(explosion booms)

414
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,731
- [Mary] Help me!

415
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:49,607
(guns firing)

416
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,743
(dramatic music)

417
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,246
(kids crying)

418
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,844
(explosions booming)

419
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,614
(kids screaming)

420
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,449
- Chief!

421
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,283
Chief!

422
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,354
- Yeah.

423
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,589
- Check the port bow, quick.

424
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,911
- Here you go.

425
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,548
- How many, motherfuckers?

426
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,350
You want me to puke?

427
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,552
Turkey loaf or nothing.

428
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,555
- Gonzales, why don't you go
see if we have any turkey loaf?

429
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:15,026
- We'll see.

430
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,896
- You make me a movie
 star in Hollywood?

431
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,865
- It's not for Hollywood.

432
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,199
- You got cigarette?

433
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,768
- [Mary] How old are you?

434
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,602
- Old enough.

435
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,436
I'm like seven.

436
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,005
Too bad.

437
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,643
- [Gonzales] Here.

438
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,179
- Hey, good feature, huh?

439
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,013
Hurry up.

440
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,924
- So, you're name's Mickey.

441
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,659
- Real name's Quang.

442
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,696
Chase used to call me
  Mickey, like Mickey Mouse.

443
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,466
- Do you know your father?

444
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,535
- Ma say his name's Bill.

445
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,805
He's come from Minnesota.

446
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,740
- Maybe we can
  help you find him.

447
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,476
- [Mickey] Minnesota
is close to California?

448
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:06,310
- [Mary] No.

449
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,478
- Forget it.

450
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,481
I want California,
Hollywood, Disney Land.

451
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,526
- Animals and kids, huh?

452
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,794
- Yeah, there's one
back there that can give

453
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,696
Dennis the Menace a
 run for his money.

454
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,737
Hey.

455
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:33,571
Hey, you guys.

456
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:34,405
You thirsty?

457
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,239
Here's some water.

458
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,942
Hey, Henderson.

459
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,511
I'm gonna hand you my camera,
 but don't get it wet, okay?

460
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,763
Lieutenant Henderson, what's
 your opinion of Len Jordan

461
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,031
and his private war
 in the Mekong Delta?

462
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:04,268
- I'm sorry, what's
 the question?

463
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,670
- What is your
 opinion of Len Jordan

464
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,106
and his private war
 in the Mekong Delta?

465
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:14,612
- Uh.

466
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,648
Well, I guess it
 takes a lot of guts

467
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:22,319
to resign your commission and
 take on the war by yourself.

468
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,691
A lot of people think
 that if the top brass

469
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:28,893
would've listened to Len Jordan,

470
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,694
South Vietnam would
 come out on top.

471
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:35,533
- Um.

472
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,170
I think something just bit me.

473
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:39,970
- What?

474
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,041
- There's a lot of these things.

475
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,943
- Probably leeches.

476
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,744
- Leeches?

477
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,818
Can't you just be careful?

478
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:56,787
- Would you just hold still?

479
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,621
We only have one more.

480
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,422
Hold on.

481
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,631
- They're the most God-awful
 things I've ever seen.

482
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:10,668
- You're welcome.

483
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,039
- Thanks.

484
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,307
- I've gotta get back to work.

485
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,447
- Hey.

486
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:25,983
You better now, kiddo?

487
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,587
Don't worry about it, Mary.

488
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,288
I've seen real strong
 men come undone

489
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,890
when they run into those things.

490
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,993
- Well, it doesn't make me
  feel any less humiliated.

491
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:36,827
- Aw, come on.

492
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,661
Cheer up.

493
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,184
- What's the matter?

494
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,789
- It's a little public around
 here right now, you know?

495
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:06,624
You know what I mean?

496
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:07,458
- Yeah.

497
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:13,430
I'll just wait till
 dark before attacking.

498
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,765
- That's better.

499
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:43,327
(tense music)

500
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,164
I figure we ought to
 make pretty good time

501
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,131
after it gets dark.

502
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,602
Won't be able to tell us from
 the rest of the refugees.

503
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,471
You know, I was thinking.

504
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,740
About 10 clicks down this river,

505
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,910
there's an old special
  ops cache we used to have.

506
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,812
Got gas, ammo, guns.

507
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,481
We ought to pull in there.

508
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,351
- Sounds good.

509
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,455
(tense music)

510
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,029
(kids laughing)

511
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,314
- Henderson.

512
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,148
- Yeah.

513
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,151
- We got a welcoming
 party up ahead.

514
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,426
You listen to me.

515
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,361
Drop me and the
 boys off down river.

516
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,699
You go back, draw their fire,
 we'll come in from behind.

517
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,168
- What makes you so sure?

518
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,870
- Just a hunch.

519
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,140
I know what the hell
 I'm talking about.

520
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:40,511
- Okay, Chief.

521
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,445
Take us in.

522
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:46,550
(suspenseful music)

523
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:05,569
(speaking foreign language)

524
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,394
(explosion booms)

525
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:07,097
(dramatic music)

526
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,067
(guns firing)

527
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,502
- Hold your fire!

528
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,772
(guns firing)

529
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,216
(grunting)

530
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,144
(gun firing)

531
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,819
(punches thudding)

532
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,322
(guns firing)

533
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,535
(soldier yells)

534
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,511
(tense music)

535
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:02,512
There he is.

536
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:34,244
Okay, let's get
 out of here, Chief.

537
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,300
(subdued music)

538
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,437
- I was so worried about you.

539
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,573
- (chuckles) I don't know why.

540
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,845
I always land on my feet.

541
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,083
- My camera was ruined.

542
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:16,420
It doesn't matter.

543
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,957
As long as you're okay.

544
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,037
What's gonna happen to us?

545
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,808
- What do you mean?

546
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:43,280
- We've meant so
 much to each other.

547
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:45,849
I just don't want it to end.

548
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,254
- It doesn't have to, honey.

549
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,860
I'll be back with the
wife and kids, I'm sure.

550
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,429
But when I come to Los Angeles,

551
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:05,569
will you still be there for me?

552
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,205
- That's all?

553
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,781
- Mary, you know
  I'm a family man.

554
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:23,720
- So, I'm not good enough
  for your image, huh?

555
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:25,822
- Baby, don't.

556
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,973
(kids chattering)

557
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,589
Well, there you go.

558
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,558
5,000 rounds of 50 caliber ammo.

559
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,328
There's five grand
  more back there.

560
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,030
- The way we went through
  all the ammo getting here,

561
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,033
I figured if we got into another
firefight, we'd be history.

562
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,989
(speaking foreign language)

563
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,858
(tense music)

564
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:35,692
- Hi.

565
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,106
- Hey, Sam.

566
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,076
What do you think about this?

567
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:57,414
- I like it.

568
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:58,448
All right, grab what you can.

569
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,050
Let's get out of here.

570
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,518
Come on.

571
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:02,352
Now.

572
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,444
- What the hell do
 you think you're doing

573
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:28,645
going around scaring?

574
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,446
- You're making too much
noise in the jungle.

575
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,647
I could've been Charlie.

576
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,684
- But you really just like
showing my mistakes, don't you?

577
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,420
- It's kind of fun.

578
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:48,298
- I can't do anything.

579
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:51,101
I can't steer a boat,
 I can't shoot a gun.

580
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:54,237
Without my camera, I can't
 even record this damn thing.

581
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,705
- Look, in wartime,

582
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:58,308
people have a habit of
rising to the occasion.

583
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,377
But do what you have to
  do and you'll do it well.

584
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:05,248
- Lieutenant, what...

585
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,554
Could you tell me what you
 really think of Len Jordan?

586
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,625
- My name is Sam.

587
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,093
And you can forget
 the lieutenant stuff

588
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,829
because I'm trying to get used
 to being a civilian again.

589
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:21,831
- You're avoiding my question.

590
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:22,666
- I know.

591
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,743
(suspenseful music)

592
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,058
- What the hell?

593
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,227
I wasn't doing anything, turkey.

594
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,695
- Hey, what the hell are
you doing with these?

595
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,964
- Nobody else wanted them.

596
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,166
- You'll die of lung
cancer before you're 30.

597
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,000
- 30?

598
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,002
It's a long way off.

599
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,437
- Hey, you know something?

600
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,505
It gets there a lot
 faster than you think.

601
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,810
- Give back my Salems.

602
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,978
- You believe this kid?

603
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:10,714
Oh, what the hell.

604
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:13,149
There's a war on.

605
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:15,352
Here, but you only
  get one at a time.

606
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,527
(tense music)

607
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:29,966
- What's that?

608
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,236
- You tell me and
  we'll both know.

609
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:49,486
(gun firing)

610
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:52,255
(dramatic music)

611
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,991
- Sister, get the
 kids on the boat, now!

612
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,259
Move, come on!

613
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,093

(speaking foreign language)

619
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,454
- Mary, get to the boat.

620
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:58,455
Go on, move.

626
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,591
I'll get her.

627
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:38,461
(guns firing)

628
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:57,380
Okay, move.

00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:02,185

632
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:36,753
- Let's get the
  hell out of here!

633
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:37,587
Come on!

634
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,159

638
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:37,647
Hey.

639
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:41,584
- Children, stop that.

640
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:42,485
Come on, let's go.

641
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,164
(tense music)

642
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,979
- Can't wait till we
 hit those sea breezes.

643
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,349
- I just hope the Navy
 hasn't pulled out.

644
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:16,452
- How could they?

645
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:18,821
I mean, especially since
 we have a war hero onboard.

646
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,726
- Back home I don't
think people give a damn

647
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:24,894
about this war anymore.

648
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:28,531
I've got a feeling the Navy
 brass feels the same way.

649
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:29,732
Even about war heroes.

650
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:42,378

Gonzales, well, he's an expert
 in what we're gonna need.

711
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:19,482
- Then do it.

712
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,787

 marks on their arm.

713
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:25,821
Big, big scars.

714
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,189

But if I do make it back,

731
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,274
you're gonna kick
 this habit for good.

732
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,944
Is that a deal?

733
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:57,146

01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:02,518

737
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,588

738
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:06,422

- Yeah.

740
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,695
Yeah, that's a deal, kid.

741
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:30,279
(tense music)

742
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:10,219
- I've gotta get closer.

743
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:12,188
You stay here.

744
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:33,576
(speaking foreign language)

745
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:01,730
(gasping)

746
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:22,751
(dramatic music)

747
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:29,625
(speaking foreign language)

748
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:44,673
(grunting)

749
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,281
(tense music)

750
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:00,289
Move, Gonzo.

751
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,262
- Mr. Henderson.

752
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:48,237
- [Mickey] Gonzo, you're back.

753
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,508
(Gonzales chuckles)

754
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:55,144
- Hey, I told you I'd come back.

755
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:55,944
- Mm-hmm.

756
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:08,290
(both laugh)

757
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:09,358
- Come on.

758
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:10,192
- Yeah.

759
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:15,798
- Henderson, your idea stinks.

760
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,667
- You got a better idea?

761
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:19,501
- Yeah.

762
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:21,770
Go back up the river.

763
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:24,707
Try and find another way out.

764
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:26,775
- We'd just get
  more of the same.

765
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,010
- I don't buy that.

766
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,945
- It's not your
decision to make, is it?

767
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:35,884
Gonzo, charges ready?

768
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:38,554
- All set, Sam.

769
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:39,955
- Chief, you a good swimmer?

770
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:43,225
- I'll go, Mr. Henderson.

771
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,994
I was the best swimmer
 in my class, sir.

772
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:46,829
- Okay.

773
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:49,398
All right, Chief.

774
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:50,966
I want you at the helm.

775
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:52,668
First light what I'm gonna do
 is I'm gonna send up a flare.

776
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:54,503
That's your signal
  to start the run.

777
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,306
When we hit top speed, that's
 when we'll blow the bridge.

778
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:06,148
If you get through,
 we're home free.

779
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,419
(suspenseful music)

780
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:42,044
(speaking foreign language)

781
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:05,814
Okay, Gonzo.

782
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:07,182
Get back to the boat.

783
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,617
Tell Chief we're on schedule.

784
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:11,253
- See you on the other side.

785
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:12,087
- Okay.

786
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:42,484
- [Mary] Those should buy
 somebody a nice retirement.

787
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:50,559
- Buy a hell of a lot of
 weapons for the resistance.

788
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:54,029
- Well, if I were you, I'd
  be real careful with that.

789
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:56,131
I mean, you don't want it to
 fall into the wrong hands.

790
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:59,534
I keep hearing these rumors
 that the war's over with

791
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:02,170
and there may be some people
 who lack your patriotism.

792
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:06,741
- Hey.

793
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:12,814
Believe me, I'll
do what's right.

794
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,917
- [Gonzales] Chief.

795
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:18,320
- What's happening?

796
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,554
- Everything's set.

797
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:21,123
We're on schedule.

798
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:22,090
- Let's get ready.

799
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:22,924
Let's go.

800
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:31,733
- Whatever happens later, I
 want you to stay down below.

801
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:32,801
Do you understand?

802
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:33,635
- Yes.

803
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:36,571
- This is for you.

804
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,043
This has always kept me safe.

805
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:45,680
Now it's going to protect you.

806
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:48,784
- Are you giving me this?

807
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:49,985
- [Gonzales] Yeah.

808
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:53,922
- To keep or just to wear?

809
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:54,990
- It's yours.

810
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:04,199
(tense music)

811
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:18,947
(speaking foreign language)

812
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:45,707
- Here we go.

813
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:02,524
- Okay, boys.

814
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:03,725
Let's move it.

815
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:06,461
(dramatic music)

816
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:46,901
(speaking foreign language)

817
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,638
- Gonzo, what the
hell's Sam waiting for?

818
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:35,043
If he doesn't blow it now,
 we can kiss our ass goodbye.

819
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:42,684
- Cover me.

820
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:51,760
(guns firing)

821
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:57,499
(explosions booming)

822
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:09,611
(men yelling)

823
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:18,887
(kids crying)

824
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,127
(explosions booming)

825
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,563
(gun firing)

826
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:32,700
(yells)

827
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:45,814
(explosion booms)

828
01:24:57,959 --> 01:25:00,962
(explosions booming)

829
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:04,499
(gun fires)

830
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:12,006
(explosions booming)

831
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:14,509
(kids crying)

832
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:19,414
(guns firing)

833
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:27,522
(men yelling)

834
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:38,299
(speaking foreign language)

835
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:40,935
Hit it!

836
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:48,576
(explosions booming)

837
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:51,779
(grunting)

838
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:02,724
(explosion booms)

839
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:05,226
(men yelling)

840
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:26,514
(explosions booming)

841
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:31,419
(man yells)

842
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:40,695
(yelling)

843
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:08,189
- Where's Thomas?

844
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:10,792
- [Sam] He didn't make it.

845
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:16,464
(tense music)

846
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:18,666
Chief, what's the damage?

847
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:19,901
- She took a hit
 on the port engine.

848
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:21,970
She's taking in a lot of water.

849
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:23,905
- All right, we're gonna
  have to lighten the load.

850
01:27:42,523 --> 01:27:43,558
- Not that one.

851
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:47,996
That one stays.

852
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:49,497
- What?

853
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:50,765
- So, why do you want to
  hold onto these dossiers?

854
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,033
We just throw 'em over,
they go to the bottom.

855
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:52,867
Go ahead, guys.

856
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:53,835
Now.

857
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:55,269
- If this goes, I go with it.

858
01:27:56,671 --> 01:27:57,839
- [Sam] I don't know what
  you're talking about.

859
01:27:57,839 --> 01:27:59,507
- I do.

860
01:27:59,507 --> 01:28:02,777
Our American war hero figured
 he could clean up on this war.

861
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:04,879
He's got a crate full of gold.

862
01:28:04,879 --> 01:28:09,450
- Yeah, I ain't leaving
here empty-handed.

863
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:12,286
- A real war hero, huh?

864
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:24,599
(guns fire)

865
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:26,601
(yells)

866
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:31,739
- What do you wanna do?

867
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:36,277
- Fuck you.

868
01:28:38,312 --> 01:28:42,817
(gun fires)
 (grunts)

869
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:52,026
(gun fires)

870
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:12,680
- Skipper.

871
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:16,284
(grunting)

872
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:17,251
You're okay, Chief.

873
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,887
We're going home.

874
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:39,340
(dramatic music)
