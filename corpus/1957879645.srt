[Joanna] I love her so much, Felix.

21
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,557
- She is just so beautiful.
- Just like her mum.

22
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,226
- [chuckles]
- Oh...

23
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,730
We are gonna have
the most peaceful Christmas this year.

24
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,523
- Just the three of us.
- [whispers] Yes.

25
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,317
[chuckles softly]

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,611
You're sure your parents don't mind
that we're not going to them this year?

27
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,154
They're fine, darling.

28
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,697
I told them we'll see them
in the New Year.

29
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,367
Oh, good. I just
couldn't face the journey.

30
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,412
I mean, this little munchkin is
enchanting, but she's exhausting.

31
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,582
Plus, I <i>hate</i> the holidays.

32
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,542
I just find everyone so annoying.

33
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:52,422
Well, we are going to be alone.

34
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,715
Hmm.

35
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,093
My family were pretty appalling
last year, weren't they?

36
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,053
- Your family are mad.
- [chuckles softly]

37
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,263
- I know.
- [chuckles]

38
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,015
But it all ended well, darling.

39
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,811
- I love you.
- I love you.

40
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,400
[phone ringing and vibrating]

41
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,612
- [baby crying]
- [angry whisper] Hello. Who is this?!

42
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,155
It's Caroline. Your sister?

43
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,951
Caroline, are you insane
calling this late?

44
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,704
Joanna, what are you talking about?
It's not late, it's 8 PM.

45
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,872
I left you three messages,
and you never called me back.

46
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,082
Is that Chloe crying?

47
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:31,503
Who else would it be? She was sleeping
and you have woken her up.

48
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,714
God knows how long it's gonna
take me to get her down again.

49
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,217
Well, I am sorry, but why do you keep
a phone in her bedroom? It's absurd.

50
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,471
She was in bed with me, Caroline.
Now, what do you want?

51
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,931
Have you heard from Vicky?

52
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,560
[scoffs] No, of course I haven't spoken
to Vicky lately.

53
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,104
- She's off in Tibet, finding herself.
- [Felix] Shh...

54
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,106
Of course. I'm in London.

55
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,983
We need to call an emergency
sisters meeting.

56
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,945
Oh, God. What has
the Christmas family done now?

57
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,323
It's Dad! He's disappeared!

58
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,826
What? Again?

59
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,763
Sisters! Come in quick. I've got milk on.

60
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,439
I haven't slept a wink since you called.
I am exhausted.

61
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,902
All I do is pick up
all this stuff, bring it here,

62
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,947
and the second I turn around again,
it's just come back. Oh, yeah.

63
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,200
Okay, Caroline, my tree isn't decorated.

64
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,118
Can you just stop staring at it?

65
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,703
[chuckles softly] I wasn't.

66
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,872
- Yes, you were.
- I only bought it yesterday.

67
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,916
It's lovely.

68
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,959
She's adorable.

69
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:57,714
Yeah. She's Daddy's little girl.
[chuckles]

70
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,758
So, it's good to see you
in London, Caroline.

71
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,593
How's everything at the manor?

72
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,720
Oh, you know, wonderful.
[chuckles softly]

73
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,058
Okay, can we just start
this emergency sisters meeting?

74
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,392
Okay, that's my cue to leave.

75
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,938
- No, baby. Baby, stay.
- No, it's fine. It's perfectly fine.

76
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,316
I'll be with little baby girl upstairs if
you need me. Come on, bubba.

77
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,152
Let's leave Mummy
to talk with her sisters.

78
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,406
I had a call two days ago from Jackie.

79
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,826
We've kind of developed a friendship.

80
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,869
- Really?
- Really.

81
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,706
And guess what? She and Dad
broke up two months ago.

82
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,084
Dad told her that he wasn't
in love with her anymore

83
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,378
and he told her to pack
her things and leave.

84
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,796
Just like that?

85
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,799
You see? He finally saw through her.

86
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,677
And I saw through her
the minute I met her, remember that.

87
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,387
Well, actually,
I think she's rather sweet.

88
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,348
I mean, when I spoke to her yesterday,
she seemed very sad about the whole thing.

89
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,975
And she's terribly worried about Dad.

90
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,270
- You've spoken to her too?
- Yes, of course.

91
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,980
Anyway, she's been trying
to call him for days

92
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,690
and he's just completely disappeared.

93
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,025
The neighbors went round to the house,
and it's all closed up.

94
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,318
But Jackie went to the house,

95
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,988
and she had a quick look
at Dad's credit card statements.

96
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,950
And Dad has made several payments
from a hotel in Nevis, in the Caribbean.

97
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,036
I've tried to call him there, he's not
taking any calls. Completely disappeared.

98
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,623
I think Dad is having
a massive emotional reaction.

99
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,584
He must be totally depressed.

100
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,879
What... what does Mum say about all this?

101
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,381
Well, Mum's on a cruise
in the Nile with Uncle John.

102
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,633
- Ugh.
- [Caroline] Yes, but it's fine.

103
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,011
It's fine. Everything's fine.

104
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,722
Why? Why is it fine?

105
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,807
Well, because I booked tickets
for the three of us.

106
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,601
We're going to the Caribbean
this afternoon.

107
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,019
What?

108
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,104
Yes. Boost Dad's morale,
perk him up a bit,

109
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,316
and we'll all be back here in England
by the 22nd, just in time for Christmas.

110
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,069
- You two are insane. That is a...
- [Felix] It's a wonderful idea.

111
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,449
I couldn't help but listen.

112
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,328
Darling, you need to do this.

113
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,873
You know, go find your dad, get some sun,
and come back for Christmas.

114
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,543
There is no way I am leaving you two.

115
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,253
That would make me a terrible mother.

116
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,548
You're a wonderful mother.
But you need a break.

117
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,551
It's only for a few days.
And you do look a little bit...

118
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,552
What?

119
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,763
- Exhausted.
- Mm-hmm.

120
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,890
Really?

121
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,644
Well, I mean...

122
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,648
Okay, I... I could do
with a bit of sleepy time.

123
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,941
Definitely, sweetheart.

124
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,319
Jolly good. You might want to start
packing. The flight leaves at four.

125
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,779
- Four?
- What?

126
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,700
- Oh, baby.
- [Felix shushes]

127
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,119
Mummy has to leave you, darling.

128
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:37,207
And she's never left you before, but she
has to go with her annoying sisters.

129
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,754
Okay, girls, let's do it.

130
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,423
Great. Let's go save Dad.

- Thanks, man.
- Great job, man.

[chuckles]

141
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,435
Mr. Christmas, great name
for the holidays, right?

142
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,314
- Can I get a "ho ho ho"?!
- Ho ho ho!

143
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,109
- Ho ho ho!
- Ho ho ho!

Wow, Megan, you've got
some serious moves out there.

148
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,412
Well, you can say the same
for yourself, James.

149
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,832
[chuckles softly] I love the Caribbean
twist on that song.

moment to take your drink order?

- Oh, that's like a week away, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,479
I made a promise to myself I wouldn't plan
anything that far ahead anymore.

159
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,733
Well, if you can plan
as far as this afternoon,

160

maybe you could join us
at the beach yoga session.

172
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,820
You're looking at the new owner
of this little piece of paradise.

173
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,325
I haven't exactly moved in yet,

174
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,619
but I'm spending more and more time here.

175
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,372
Congratulations.

176
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,044
Mind if I ask you a private question?

177
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,629
Sure.

178
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,174
You're a big star back in America.

179
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:06,012
Why are you hiding out on a little
Caribbean island, singing in a beach bar?

180
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,144
I reckon everybody on this island
is asking that same question.

181
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:19,359
I wouldn't know.
I don't really take part in gossip.

182
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,112
I'll be honest with you, my friend.

183
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,283
Back in the day...

184
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,121
I woke up every morning
just living to write another song.

185
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,084
Music was everything.

186
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,921
I wrote a bunch of songs.

187
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,549
And got damn lucky a couple times.

188
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,469
Real lucky.

189
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,431
But my Dad always said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good."

190
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,601
- He was right about that.
- [both chuckle]

191
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,479
Anyhow...

192
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,233
what goes up must come down.

193
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,279
Yeah, I learned that the hard way.

194
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,074
Music business...

195
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,369
became all about the business.

196
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,706
Music just got lost.

197
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,627
I dried up.

198
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,880
Couldn't write a damn song if I had to.

199
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,634
Just wasn't inspired.

200
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,514
One day I got to thinking...

201
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,933
music is a common thread

202
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,769
between the heart and soul
and the universe.

203
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,357
Yeah. Anyway...

204
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,154
I'm still searching.
I just don't know what I'm searching for.

205
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,741
But I'll tell you one thing that changed.
When I came here?

206
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,246
I was at peace.

207
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,291
Just loved it here.

208
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,169
And I never left.

209
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,757
I'll drink to that.

210
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,051
- [glasses clink]
- Right on, my brother.

211
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,642
[upbeat music playing]

212
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,608
[Joanna] I hope Dad is on this island.

213
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,278
[meditative music playing]

214
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,741
That's it. Breathe.

215
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:38,539
Let the majesty of the island feel it.

216
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,922
- Inhale...
- [inhales deeply]

217
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:50,218
Exhale out. That's good.

218
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,016
Listen to the silence.

219
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,854
I can't believe you didn't make us
a reservation at the hotel.

220
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,273
It would have tipped him off
that we were coming, and knowing Dad,

221
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,651
he would have just disappeared
to another island or something.

222
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,362
Well, okay, but we better
find him before Christmas

223
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,489
because I need to get back to my baby.

224
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,824
I know. But we had to come here
and find Dad.

225
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,868
I mean, we... we don't know where he is.

226
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,788
It can't be that difficult.
It's a very small island.

227
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,374
[meditative music playing]

228
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,252
[Vaughn] Listen to the silence.

229
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,295
Dad! Dad?!

230
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,130
Look! Look at over there!

231
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,342
[shouting] Dad! Dad!

232
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,636
[sisters shouting in unison] Dad!

233
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,430
- Dad!
- Daddy!

234
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,057
Daddy, it's us! Dad!

235
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,893
Ladies, we're having a yoga session here.

236
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,853
- [James] Oh, dear Lord.
- Please.

237
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,481
- [sisters] Dad! Dad!
- Do you know these people?

238
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,317
- I'm afraid I do.
- [Joanna] Dad!

239
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,153
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

240
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,822
It's not a problem.

241
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,156
Sorry.

242
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,035
- [Joanna] Dad! Come on!
- All right! You three!

243
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:58,953
Dad!

244
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,247
Dad, what are you doing here?

245
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,916
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm doing yoga on the beach.

246
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,461
- Well, yeah, we can see that.
- We have been worried sick about you.

247
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,796
[Paulina] Dad, you're doing yoga?

248
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,634
- What are you doing here, girls?
- Well, you totally disappeared.

249
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,429
Jackie rang me. She was
in a complete panic.

250
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,889
All right. I told Jackie
that she was too young for me.

251
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,766
She had to move on with her life.

252
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,270
Dad, we don't care about Jackie.
We care about you.

253
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,732
Yes. We've called the hotel so many times.
I've left so many messages.

254
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,027
Can't a man disappear without being
hunted down by his nosy daughters?

255
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,612
- [Caroline] No.
- You see?

256
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,281
This is what our father is like.

257
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,326
Joanna, what are you even doing here?
What about Felix and Chloe?

258
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,286
They're at home, in London.

259
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,038
And I'm here because these two nutcases

260
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,206
imagined you lying half dead
on a beach somewhere.

261
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,501
<i>I</i> am here to rescue you, Daddy.

262
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,296
Aren't you just a little
bit happy to see us, Dad?

263
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,798
[chuckles] Of course I am.

264
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,467
Come here. Give me a hug.

265
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,886
[smooches]

266
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:04,060
[James] All right.
Get you all checked in.

267
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,395
Once you're settled in,
we have a lot to discuss.

268
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,775
Now that's what I call a family.

269
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,237
[sentimental music playing]

270
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,097
Hey, it's me.

271
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,891
Hey. Hi, honey. You made it, then.

272
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:48,437
- [Chloe crying]
- Oh, look at that beautiful little baby.

273
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,399
[chuckles] As you can see,
we've got a crying baby.

274
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,359
[Felix shushing]

275
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,821
- It's good. Have you found your dad yet?
<i>- Hey.</i>

276
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,574
Hey. Yeah, Dad is absolutely fine.

277
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:04,203
Can you believe it? He was doing yoga
on the beach when we arrived.

278
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,498
Yoga? [chuckles] Good for him.

279
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,460
Look, darling, I've got a crying baby
here. I think she's hungry.

280
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,964
Oh, well, kiss her for me.
Does she miss me?

281
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,757
Of course she does.

282
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,427
<i>It's all right.
Say bye-bye to Mummy.</i>

283
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,720
- Love you.
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>

284
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,973
<i>Look, get some sleep.
I've gotta go. All right.</i>

285
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,307
- [phone beeps]
- Miss you.

286
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,393
- [birds chirping]
- [door opens]

287
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,232
- So?
- Hey, Daddy.

288
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,817
How is my little granddaughter doing?

289
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,487
Oh, Daddy, she is just gorgeous.

290
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,865
- Do you have a picture?
- I do.

291
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,908
There. Look at that, that was yesterday.

292
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:43,909
Ah.

293
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,662
I mean, don't get me wrong.
She's a handful.

294
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,957
[scoffs] No surprise there.
Look who her mother is.

295
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,459
[chuckles sarcastically]

296
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,626
Well, she's adorable.

297
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,086
- How's Felix doing?
- He's fine.

298
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,674
Oh. And you?
How are you, my daughter?

299
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,760
I'm fine.

300
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,555
Though, I am pretty stressed
most of the time.

301
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,640
I mean, having a baby is wonderful.

302
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:10,186
But it's a bit like being
in the eye of a storm.

303
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,897
It's magnificent, fabulous...

304
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,192
but scary.

305
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,987
I don't know if I'm doing
everything right, Dad.

306
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,448
I mean, there's just so much
for me to remember.

307
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:29,163
Some of the time, I just self-indulgently
throw myself on the sofa and cry.

308
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,334
- Does that make me a bad mum?
- Not at all.

309
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,378
Your mother and I were lost
when you came along.

310
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,632
We were just 17 years old.
Your mother was scared senseless.

311
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,177
But you'll see, it gets easier day to day.

312
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,138
- Sure?
- Absolutely.

313
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,890
It's the circle of life.

314
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,611
Now get up, I told your sisters to meet us
at my favorite place in Nevis for a drink.

315
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,988
Are you okay, Dad?

316
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,450
Of course. Come on, let's go.

317
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,828
[chuckles]

318
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,251
[lively music playing]

319
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,551
I swear, the first diaper
I changed nearly made me pass out.

320
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,803
I mean, she seemed
such a tiny little thing.

321
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,471
Where did it all come from?

322
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,431
- [chuckling]
- Whereas Felix,

323
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,351
he took to it like a duck to water.

324
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,686
Honestly, I really think they have

325
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,690
some little secret sign language
going on behind my back.

326
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,650
Having a child changes a woman.

327
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,235
It brings out the best in her.

328
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,820
Are you saying,
I was any different before?

329
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,448
What? No. Not at all.

330
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,741
- Caroline?
- Hmm?

331
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,827
How about you and Peter?
How are things with you two?

332
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,788
Oh, well... after last year's crisis,

333
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,624
things are just perfect.

334
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,918
We now have sex twice a week,
Saturdays and Wednesdays.

335
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,128
[chuckles softly]

336
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,172
Oh, gosh, you probably
mark it down in your awful little planner.

337
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,800
Oh, I don't need to.
I have an alert on my phone.

338
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:09,096
I never knew that shopping for sexy
lingerie could be quite so exciting.

339
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,056
You have no idea how many
shades of red there are.

340
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,558
Unbelievable!

341
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,894
She'll be telling us
what he says in bed next.

342
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,812
"Yes." That's what he says in bed.

343
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,982
- Yes. [giggles]
- [Joanna] God.

344
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:24,695
What has become of my... my nomad,
runaway, insane daughter Vicky?

345
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,363
Where is she? What's up?

346
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,866
Well, she's in Tibet... or India.
One of them.

347
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,161
Anyway, she's on an ashram
studying meditation

348
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,288
and getting in touch with her inner self.

349
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,957
Or with her guru's outer self. [chuckles]

350
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,461
[laughs] You know you can never change
a free spirit, Joanna.

351
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,338
You of all people should know that.

352
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:48,260
And you, you ditched
this whole Beatle thing?

353
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,722
Yeah. I finished my thesis,
and I shed my Fab Four persona.

354
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:56,769
Yes. And this... this new skin
you're sporting is...?

355
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,395
Can't you tell?

356
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:04,902
Only the greatest female
blues singer of the '60s.

357
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,531
- Janis Joplin!
- Ah.

358
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:13,118
I am writing a book about her days
in Haight-Ash bury.

359
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,537
San Fran, Woodstock, that whole thing.

360
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,498
- Fascinating.
- Promise me...

361
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,293
at some point,

362
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:26,590
you'll take the time
to think about you, Paulina.

363
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,636
That beautiful girl inside.

364
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,764
She deserves to see
the world too, you know.

365
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,601
What about that girl that, you know,

366
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,687
the pretty girl that you met
at... at the bar?

367
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,606
The... the really cute one when we all went
out and got drunk at the local pub.

368
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,024
Oh, gosh, what a night that was.

369
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,443
Yeah, when Jackie
nearly blew your house up.

370
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,529
We broke up.

371
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,698
I believe I've evolved.

372
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,034
Okay, so speaking of breaking up, Dad,

373
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,036
why don't you tell us all about Jackie?

374
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,580
Yes. She seemed so good for you.

375
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,457
Was she?

376
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,752
Well... yes. Yes, she was.

377
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,507
But we... evolved too.
I had to let her go...

378
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,178
in favor of some... new beginnings.

379
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:17,391
But what's important is now.

380
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:21,228
This very moment, I am
on a Caribbean island...

381
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,565
with three of my magnificent
four daughters,

382
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,316
and I couldn't be happier.

383
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,652
This couldn't be more beautiful,
more wonderful.

384
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,154
To the Christmas family.

385
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,656
- Christmas family.
- Christmas family.

386
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,741
- Cheers.
- [glasses clink]

387
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,246
Oh, my God!

388
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,331
[country music playing]

389
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,046
It can't be, can it?

390
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,923
What?

391
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,341
What is it, Paulina? Spit it out.

392
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:56,513
Only one of the greatest
country singers of all time.

393
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,390
Jimmy Ray Love!

394
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,726
Jimmy. Jimmy, come on over here,
and say hi to my daughters.

395
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,519
Come on. Come on, sit here, Paulina.

396
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,855
- [Jimmy] How you doing, my friend?
- [Paulina chuckles nervously]

397
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,566
This is Jimmy. This is Caroline...

398
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,568
Joanna... and Paulina.

399
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,154
And, um, there is a fourth one
wandering about somewhere

400
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,573
in search of her inner
consciousness or something.

401
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,035
Well, well, well, James,
aren't you full of surprises?

402
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,745
Actually, not.

403
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,372
I knew the second I saw 'em
get off that boat down there.

404
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,709
- These your kids.
- They also said Dad.

405
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,878
- [sisters laugh]
- Well, that was a good call.

406
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,214
Anyway, it's nice to meet you girls.

407
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:34,760
I am just floored that my Dad
knows Jimmy Ray Love.

408
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,846
Yeah. Well...

409
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,557
it's actually just the opposite of that.

410
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:43,936
I'm honored to know your dad,
call him my friend.

411
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,773
Everybody on this island will
tell you the exact same thing.

412
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:52,194
"Tell Me That You Love Me."
I love that song so much.

413
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,446
Me too. I love it too.

414
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,115
Yes. Well, here's to...

415
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,700
legendary songs
sung by legendary singers.

416
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,160
- Yes.
- Legendary songs.

417
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,870
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

418
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:02,913
[Caroline giggles]

419
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,582
[fire crackling]

420
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,586
["Time" begins]

421
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,835
[song continues]

422
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,859
[gentle country music playing]

423
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:46,535
Joanna! Joanna!

424
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,789
- Oh...
- Morning!

425
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,292
For God's sake, Caroline. I was asleep.

426
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,210
Oh, well, now you're awake. [chuckles]

427
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,461
What do you want?

428
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,755
Wasn't last night wonderful?

429
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:02,926
Well, yeah, if you don't
have a massive hangover.

430
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,722
Oh. It's so lovely here.
I can see why Dad enjoys it.

431
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,349
You know, Caroline,
I will pay you anything

432
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,269
if you just let me go back
to sleep for an hour.

433
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,146
[James] Good morning, girls.

434
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,522
Oh.

435
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,774
Another glorious day in paradise.

436
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,694
Hello, Dad. Nice to see
that somebody's up and at it.

437
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:25,532
Yes. Well, this is your first day
and your introduction to the island.

438
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,826
First up, a boat ride on a catamaran.

439
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,453
- Ooh.
- A catamaran?

440
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,748
- Yes, it's a multihull boat.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Caroline.

441
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,583
I know what a catamaran is.

442
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,127
But if I'm gonna go out
under this burning orb,

443
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,796
I'm gonna need to borrow some sunscreen.
I didn't have time to buy any.

444
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,423
I have some in my cabin,
just help yourself.

445
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,675
I'm gonna go out and get some coffee.
We leave in one hour.

446
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,511
Time to get dressed. Chop-chop.

447
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,600
I hate you.

448
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,534
[drawer opens]

449
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,246
[drawer closes]

450
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,414
[humming]

451
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:49,950
Oh, my...

452
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,622
[birds chirping]

453
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,048
[sighs heavily]

454
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,729
[tearfully] How long have you known?

455
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:26,236
A few months ago,
I was feeling very tired.

456
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:31,783
I had them run some tests,
and it turned out I had cancer.

457
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,622
- Does Jackie know?
- No. I never told her. I...

458
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,668
I didn't want her to be around,
not to see any of this.

459
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,216
Dad, you need to get treatment.

460
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,178
You can't stay here. You... you have
to come home with us.

461
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,095
No.

462
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,890
I'm not doing chemo.

463
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,809
I'm not gonna waste away
on some hospital bed in London.

464
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,604
I'm gonna deal with this
on my own terms...

465
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,734
watching the sun rise and set, right here.

466
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,198
Listen to me.

467
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,452
I need you to promise me something.

468
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,083
I need you to swear
that you will not tell your sisters.

469
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,630
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

470
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:32,552
Let me enjoy these couple
of days with my beautiful daughters.

471
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,221
Do this for me.

472
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,806
Let this be my Christmas present.

473
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,561
- Please.
- It's a lot to ask.

474
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,065
I know.

475
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,442
But I believe I can trust you
to make that promise.

476
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,694
Yes?

477
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,491
Okay.

478
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,246
- [sniffles]
- Now, don't we have a...

479
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,747
boat ride in a couple of minutes?

480
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,837
I...

481
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,173
[sniffles]

482
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,844
I love you.

483
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,763
I love you more.

484
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,517
[sniffles]

485
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,020
[James sighs]

486
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,858
[seagulls squawking]

487
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,246
[Megan] So... four daughters?

488
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,206
[both chuckle]

489
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,626
You certainly kept that one quiet.

490
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,380
You really are a man of mystery,
Mr. Christmas.

491
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,550
Well, not really, Megan.

492
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,843
[Megan chuckles]

493
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,431
You see, honestly, I carry a bit of shame
about my daughters

494
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,518
which lasted until they forgave me
just last Christmas.

495
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,857
Several years ago, my wife fell in love
with my older brother.

496
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,109
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

497
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,739
And rather than having them
watch me self-destruct, I...

498
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,159
I left them.

499
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,206
Well, they are here now.

500
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,917
And they must love you very much.

501
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,419
[scoffs, chuckles]

502
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,134
Megan seems like a nice person.

503
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,386
Mm-hmm.

504
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,889
- But?
- But what?

505
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,141
Well, usually when you make
that noise, there's a "but."

506
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:48,063
- No, not at all. But...
- There you are.

507
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,690
Don't you think it's just
a little too soon after Jackie?

508
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:54,152
If Dad wants to have fun,
he should have fun.

509
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,820
It's none of our business.

510
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,158
Who are you,
and what have you done with Joanna?

511
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,286
[chuckles softly]

512
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,580
I still think we should find out
more about her, though.

513
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,667
- Start digging.
- Why is it always me?

514
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,503
Because you look so sweet and innocent,
and nobody suspects you.

515
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,296
Wow.

516
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,925
Some light, huh? [chuckles]
Another wonderful day.

517
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,514
So, Megan, are you and my Dad together?

518
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,307
Oh, my God! I can't
believe she just asked that.

519
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:27,310
- [fake laughs]
- No, we're not.

520
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:28,895
Megan and I are
just friends, Paulina.

521
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,648
Friends are good.

522
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,943
- Happy now?
- [light chuckle]

523
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,861
And what about you, Paulina?

524
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,531
Joanna and Caroline seem happily married.

525
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,325
Oh, I'm... I'm single. And I'm a lesbian.

526
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,035
Ah.

527
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,872
How about you, Megan?

528
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:51,000
Well, my parents aren't around anymore.

529
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:54,713
But even though I'm alone,
I could never leave the island.

530
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,589
Nevis is my home.

531
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,299
So, no husband then?

532
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,636
No. But I have been in love.

533
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,390
You know, before this interrogation
gets any sillier, I'm going swimming.

534
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,975
Hang on to that for me, will you?

535
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,311
- [laughs loudly]
- Yes, he is...

536
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,980
- Oh, he really is.
- Oh! [laughs]

537
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,735
- [laughing]
- Aw...

538
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:19,362
Come on in, girls! This is amazing.

539
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,781
[contented sigh]

540
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,326
[seagulls squawking]

541
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,370
[cheering and applause]

542
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:13,500
["Where'm I Gonna Live" begins]

543
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,397
Y'all sing it now!

544
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,860
[song continues]

545
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,493
Whoo!

546
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,870
[cheering]

547
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,457
[Jimmy] The Christmas family!

548
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,917
[cheering continues]

549
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,927
[sentimental music playing]

550
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,354
[crickets chirping]

551
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,071
[waves rolling in]

552
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,784
It was quite an eventful day.

553
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,453
Yes. Dad, thank you so much.

554
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,956
Well, thank Megan.

555
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,708
She put together the best parts.

556
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,085
I have an idea.

557
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:07,382
Why don't y'all share one of your favorite
Christmas memories with us?

558
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,721
Um...

559
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,264
Yeah, I have one.

560
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,517
I'd love to hear it.

561
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,729
I was five, I think.

562
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:25,149
I was rooting around
Dad's record collection.

563
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,443
All these wonderful old vinyls.

564
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,362
And I closed my eyes,

565
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,406
and I pulled out a random album.

566
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,699
When I opened them,

567
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:36,035
it was Tamia Motown's
<i>Christmas Greats.</i>

568
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,663
And I put the record on,
and Dad came in

569
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,332
and he caught me dancing
to the Jackson Five,

570
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:45,211
singing "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town."
[chuckles]

571
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,922
He was laughing his head off.

572
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,507
And when I was done...

573
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,511
he gave me the album to keep.

574
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,430
My first ever record.

575
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,682
I still have it.

576
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,271
What about you, Megan?

577
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,109
Ah, I'm not really one for reminiscing.

578
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,612
Oh, come on. You must have
one memory to share.

579
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,282
Well...

580
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,703
I do remember one Christmas Eve

581
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,290
when my father was helping my mother
put up the Christmas tree,

582
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,793
and he suddenly just stopped
and kissed her.

583
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:31,174
I never knew anyone
to kiss with so much love as they did.

584
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,806
- [sighs] Your turn, Caroline.
- [Joanna] Oh, no.

585
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,141
Don't open Pandora's box.

586
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,770
Oh, stop it. It's easy.

587
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:44,979
Last Christmas.

588
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:49,776
After being away for 15 years,

589
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:53,362
Dad came back,
and we were a family again.

590
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,575
And it was crazy and chaotic...

591
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,579
but it was perfect.

592
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,002
Joanna.

593
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,296
My favorite Christmas memory...

594
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,048
You don't have to say it, Joanna.

595
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,008
Oh, but I do.

596
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,636
It was snowing.

597
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,263
Mum had taken the other girls
to the Christmas fair,

598
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:23,017
leaving just me and Dad home together.

599
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,814
So, we snuggled up and we watched
a Christmas movie on TV.

600
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,442
Then Dad said,

601
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,529
"Get your coat and gloves.

602
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,532
We're gonna go out and build
a snowman for your sisters."

603
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,870
I was so excited, and we built
the biggest snowman ever.

604
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:48,084
Then Dad picked me up and he said...

605
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,338
Do you remember what you said?

606
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,761
I said I would always
love you and protect you...

607
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,682
and I would never, ever leave you.

608
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,938
That's right. You know what, Dad?

609
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,983
You never did leave me.

610
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:18,322
You were with me every minute...

611
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:21,742
of every day of my life.

612
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,878
What about you, Jimmy Love?

613
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,671
- For real?
- [Paulina] Yeah.

614
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,553
My favorite Christmas memory...

615
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,264
this one.

616
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:48,269
Watching y'all be the family I never had.

617
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,235
[soft melodious music playing]

618
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,444
[toilet flushes]

619
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,245
[sentimental music playing]

620
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,471
[birds chirping]

621
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,436
Morning, Daddy.

622
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,525
[James] You're up early.

623
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,777
Oh, I want to make the most of this trip.

624
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,447
What's the plan for today?

625
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,410
Let's start with some breakfast.

626
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,163
[cozy festive music playing]

627
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:32,915
I'm stuffed.

628
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,002
- Is this you or me?
- You.

629
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,547
Ah.

630
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,633
- Good morning, Mr. Christmas.
- Good morning, Vanessa.

631
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:46,387
- You didn't forget me, right?
- How could I forget you?

632
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,888
If you've finished breakfast, shall we?

633
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,557
- We shall, indeed.
- Where are we going?

634
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,935
Come along, girls. Vanessa
runs a program for kids.

635
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,854
[Caroline] Oh, program for kids.

636
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,398
How old is <i>she?</i>

637
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:01,569
["O Christmas Tree" big band version
playing throughout]

638
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,199
So, we bake the cookies.

639
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:33,536
And then we deliver them to the older
people in our community

640
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,830
who can't go out and shop
for themselves anymore.

641
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,915
We do this because...

642
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,626
[all] Sharing is caring!

643
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:46,257
I'm sorry, children...
I... I've gotten so old I...

644
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,760
I can barely hear what you're saying.
Would you mind repeating that, please?

645
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,346
Sharing is caring!

646
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,597
Eh?

647
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,724
[kids] Sharing is caring!

648
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,685
[all laughing]

649
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,854
[laughs] Oh, that's better.

650
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,523
Go ahead, Leo.

651
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,650
Is your last name really Christmas?

652
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:07,862
Yes. My name is James Christmas.

653
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,905
Do you know Santa personally?

654
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:13,200
I'd have to say that Santa and I

655
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,536
have a very special bond.

656
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,913
I hope he likes our Christmas cookies.

657
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:20,249
Oh, I'm sure he will, Jackson.

658
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,960
Well, kids, I think
we should say a huge thanks

659
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,546
and a big applause to Mr. Christmas!

660
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,173
- [kids] Yeah!
- Thank you, Mr. Christmas!

661
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,549
Thank you. Thank you, children.

662
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,134
Now we gotta go deliver these cookies,

663
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,971
and I tell you what. Cenita, Jackson,
Christian, Leo, you come with me.

664
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,723
Caroline, you will ride shotgun.

665
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,058
Come on, kids. Let's get ready
to deliver these cookies.

666
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,144

667

[kids giggling]

668
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,531
Good, kids. Good job. Merry Christmas.

669
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,660
Merry Christmas.

670
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,457
Merry Christmas.

671
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,337
Go ahead up the stairs, kids.
Give them cookies.

672
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,797
- There you go.
- [woman] Merry Christmas.

673
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,674
Thank you, thank you.

674
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:15,221
They're so pretty. Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

675
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,973
- Oh, this is lovely.
- [coughing]

676
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,600
Dad, you okay?

677
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,228
What's up?

678
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,815
Suddenly, I don't feel very good. Uh...

679
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,776
Would you mind driving home?

680
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,863
No, of course. You don't look very well.

681
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,949
- [dog barking]
- [birds chirping]

682
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,703
[sentimental music playing]

683
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,873
I... I just need to rest a little.

684
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:44,959
I probably ate something bad.

685
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,961
[groans] I'll be fine.

686
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,130
You're burning up a little.

687
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:55,302
- They're good kids, aren't they?
- Yes. Yes, they are.

688
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,600
You know, I never ever
meant to hurt you, Caroline.

689
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,818
You do know how much
I love you and your sisters, don't you?

690
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,071
Of course.

691
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,951
I, uh, need to lie down.
I'm gonna take a nap. [sniffles]

692
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,123
We can, uh,
have some dinner tonight.

693
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,126
Okay. Get some rest.

694
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,230
[breathes heavily]

695
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,451
What's going on?

696
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,704
I don't know. Something's up.

697
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,166
We were delivering cookies,
and everything was fine,

698
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,836
and then he started coughing,
and he has a fever.

699
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,172
He's resting.

700
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,718
What is it, Joanna?

701
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,346
- Nothing.
- You're lying.

702
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,681
What? Why is she lying?

703
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:24,975
She knows something. Spit it out.

704
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,605
I can't. I made a promise.

705
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,106
What promise?

706
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,654
Joanna. Tell us.

707
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,323
[Paulina] Please.

708
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,871
Okay. Yeah.

709
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,207
Let's... let's go sit down.

710
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,843
Well?

711
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,263
Dad has cancer.

712
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:05,182
You're not serious?

713
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,601
I'm not gonna joke
about something like this, am I?

714
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,021
No, no, of course not, but...

715
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,191
When? How?

716
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,737
- Caroline, what are you doing?
- I'm calling Vicky.

717
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,614
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I mean, she has to know.

718
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,324
I have to call her.
No, she has to know!

719
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:26,245
Please stop! Our Daddy is sick.

720
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,665
[crying]

721
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:35,963
I can't believe this.
When did you find out?

722
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:40,426
Yesterday. But he made me promise
not to tell you both.

723
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:46,098
He just wants to enjoy
this time with his daughters.

724
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:51,228
Well, obviously Jackie doesn't know,
otherwise she'd be here.

725
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,650
What are we gonna do?

726
00:53:56,734 --> 00:54:00,404
Look, you two have to behave
as if you don't know.

727
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,156
- What?
- [Joanna] Please.

728
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,657
I promised.

729
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:08,245
We can't just ignore the fact
that he's sick, finish our little vacation

730
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:12,374
and wave goodbye
for the last time. Can we?

731
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,754
Absolutely not.

732
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,925
Here's what we're going to do.
We're gonna keep his secret.

733
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,928
But the three of us have to do
everything we possibly can

734
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,930
to show him how precious he is to us.

735
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,600
And we have to convince him
to come back to England with us

736
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,852
so he can get treatment
and we can take care of him.

737
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,978
Agreed?

738
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,230
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

739
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,443
Okay, we have a mission to accomplish.

740
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,028
Absolutely. Of course we do.

741
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,113
Father Christmas
is not dying on our watch.

742
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:46,742
[phone ringing]

743
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,623
- Hi, darling.
- Hey. Hi, sweetheart.

744
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,999
How's my little girl?

745
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,584
<i>Oh, she's fast asleep.</i>

746
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:57,920
<i>You okay?</i>

747
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,299
- Not really.
- What's wrong?

748
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,801
It's Dad.

749
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,303
He's got cancer.

750
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,055
Oh, no.

751
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,724
Oh, honey.

752
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,519
<i>Babe, I'm so sorry.</i>

753
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,146
<i>You are gonna bring him home, right?</i>

754
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,399
I'm not sure.

755
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,861
Look...

756
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,154
Honey, um...

757
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,280
anything you need,

758
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:28,116
I'm here for you, okay? I love you.

759
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,328
I love you too.
Kiss that little baby for me.

760
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,830
<i>Of course.</i>

761
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:35,249
<i>I'm gonna go. I don't really feel like
talking now, but...</i>

762
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,084
I'll call you later, okay?

763
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,294
Okay. Love you.

764
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,714
- Lots of love. Bye.
- [phone beeps off]

765
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:47,427
- [sighs]
- [sentimental music playing]

766
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:12,786
[phone ringing and vibrating]

767
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:16,832
[phone beeps]

768
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,210
- Yeah?
- Hey, my brother.

769
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,045
Hey, Jimmy. How are you, man?

770
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:23,881
What are you and your girls doing tonight?

771
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,758
- I don't think we have anything planned.
<i>- Oh, really?</i>

772
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:31,013
Why don't you let me treat
y'all to a big dinner down at Sunshine's?

773
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:34,099
Maybe some of that house rum
of his, if you know what I'm saying?

774
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,726
Well, that's awfully nice of you.

775
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,770
<i>It might be a nice way
to send the girls off.</i>

776
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,731
Okay, then. Well, I'll see you
when you get here.

777
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,817
We'll see you later. Thanks.

778
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:55,412
Do you ever run out
of amazing places here?

779
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:58,332
- It's incredible.
- What are these?

780
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:02,336
It's a homemade rum,
made with a secret ingredient.

781
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,713
- What secret ingredient?
- Sunshine.

782
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,089
- Oh.
- [laughs]

783
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,050
It's called a Killer Bee.

784
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,469
You gotta be careful,
they're dangerous and addictive.

785
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,055
Here's to Killer Bees
and the island of Nevis.

786
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,222
Killer Bees!

787
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,934
- Nevis.
- [all] Nevis.

788
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,936
- There's Sunshine now.
- [Joanna] Hey, there.

789
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,520
We're gonna need
some more Killer Bees.

790
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:21,772
More Killer Bees be right up.

791
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,148
- Thank you.
- [Jimmy] Thank you, sir.

792
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,651
- Be right back with your food.
- [all] Thank you.

793
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:27,653
Thank you, sir. Well done.

794
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:31,114
Well, seems like
y'all know a lot about me,

795
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:35,243
so how about I learn
a little bit about you all?

796
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,663
Carolina, is it true you live
in a castle?

797
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:41,416
Oh, that old thing.
[chuckles] Yes.

798
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,586
But really, it just was passed down
through my husband's family.

799
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,130
You know, 16th century,
go off, fight a war,

800
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:49,591
come back, get a castle
for your troubles.

801
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,720
Joanna, what about you?

802
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,431
Oh, well, I am a fashion editor.

803
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:59,643
And I'm also mummy
to a beautiful little girl.

804
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,021
Now, you and this Janis thing.

805
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,691
If it's just a phase,
it's working for you.

806
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:08,318
And if you gonna be somebody,
be Janis, I always say.

807
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,903
[chuckles]

808
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,738
Oh, you didn't see her
during her Beatles phase.

809
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,949
She had a mop top for a long time.

810
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,826
It was only for 10 years, Caroline.

811
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,287
When I was a little girl,

812
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,665
I fell in love with The Beatles,
especially Paul.

813
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,544
And when I grew up, I chose to do
my thesis on them.

814
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,838
I consider myself
a bit of a method writer.

815
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,756
I like to live in their style, you know?

816
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,967
I think it helps the process.

817
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,053
[sentimental music playing]

818
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,473
- Cheers. To the process.
- Very proud of you.

819
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:40,100
- [Joanna] Cheers.
- [Caroline] Whoo.

820
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,436
- [Jimmy] Whoa.
- [Joanna] Oh, wow.

821
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,354
- [Jimmy] Sunshine.
- [Joanna] Look at that.

822
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:46,648
- Yes, I am.
- Yum.

823
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,483
Oh, Dad.

824
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,617
- [Caroline] Good night.
- [James] Night, Jimmy Ray.

825
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,454
Good night, girls, James!

826
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,545
- How you feeling, Dad?
- Great. I'm content.

827
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,590
I have my three girls
with me. [chuckles softly]

828
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:14,885
- I do get it, you know.
- What's that?

829
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:19,014
The pull of this place.
It's like paradise.

830
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,683
I think I had too many Killer Bees.

831
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:22,893
[Joanna chuckles]

832
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,645
You know what? I miss Vicky.

833
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:30,150
Oh, I know. I tried calling her, but she
answers her phone like once a month.

834
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:34,696
Well, let's send her a video message,
the four of us.

835
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,073
- Oh.
- That's a good idea.

836
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:39,034
- Paulina, you will be the cameraman.
- Yeah. I have my phone.

837
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,662
- [Caroline] Okay.
- Okay.

838
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:43,955
- [phone beeps]
- Go.

839
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,373
[all] Hi, Vicky!

840
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,958
- Hi, hun.
- We miss you.

841
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:49,503
Listen. I... I miss you,
sweetheart, every day.

842
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,714
And I... I just want to say,
you know, be safe, and I...

843
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,843
I want you to have a wonderful life.

844
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,178
I love you.

845
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,429
- We love you.
- We love you.

846
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:02,390
- Stay safe.
- [all] Bye. Bye.

847
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:03,600
- [phone beeps]
- Sent.

848
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,229
Oh, yes. You know
what you should do, Dad?

849
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,356
You should come back
to England with us

850
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,441
- and have Christmas there.
- [in unison] Yes.

851
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:15,445
[chuckles] No, no. I don't think so.

852
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,614
I... the weather
does not agree with me.

853
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,908
It's not that bad.

854
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,993
Don't you want to have
Christmas with us, Daddy?

855
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:23,745
Well, then, I'll do one better.

856
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,664
Why don't we all stay
and have Christmas here?

857
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,998
- [gasps] Yes!
- Yes?

858
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,959
Oh, we could bring everyone out.
Peter and the Kids.

859
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,168
Uh, Felix and Chloe.

860
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,129
- Yes. And Vicky and Mum and Uncle John.
- [Caroline] Yes.

861
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,798
All right, all right.
Let's not get carried away.

862
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,342
Caroline, don't go changing
your Christmas traditions.

863
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,718
I know how important they are to you.

864
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,638
No. Come on, Caroline can
live dangerously for one year,

865
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:45,308
- can't you, Caroline?
- Yes. Yes, yes, I can.

866
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,769
Come on, Dad. Say yes.

867
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:52,065
- May I sleep on it?
- Okay.

868
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,526
- I'm going to bed. Good night, ladies.
- Yeah, all right.

869
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:57,112
- [Caroline and Joanna] Good night.
- [Paulina] Good night, Dad.

870
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,702
What do we think?

871
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,287
I don't know.

872
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,292
I don't want to lose my Daddy.

873
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,253
[crickets chirping]

874
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:36,985
You told them.

875
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:42,824
They're your daughters, Dad.
They needed to know.

876
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,455
Why don't you go sleep on that?

877
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,711
Good night.

878
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,648
- Good morning, ladies.
- Morning.

879
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,982
Where's my Dad?

880
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,318
Your father left you this note.

881
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,653
Thank you.

882
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:24,449
"Meet me here." And an address.

883
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,996
Oh, gosh.

884
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,331
[vehicle approaching]

885
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:55,480
[door closes]

886
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:09,077
- What is this place?
- I bought it.

887
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,871
I'm thinking about slapping
a fresh coat of paint on it.

888
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,792
Best view on the island,

889
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,461
and that rhythm is just perfect.

890
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:22,757
Now, if you three would kindly be seated,

891
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,885
I have something to explain to you.

892
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,972
[sentimental music playing]

893
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:38,356
This thing I have, this cancer.

894
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:42,986
It's in my head.
It's called a meningioma.

895
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:46,865
It started with headaches and dizziness,
a couple of blackouts.

896
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,784
They have to monitor its growth.

897
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,454
When it reaches a certain size,
the only option is to operate.

898
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:56,249
If and when that happens,
I will have to decide what to do.

899
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,293
If I choose to do that,

900
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,880
then I will decide
where to have the operation.

901
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:05,133
Until then, I am staying here.

902
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:10,013
So you slept on our suggestions
and ignored them.

903
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,016
I want you to go back to your families...

904
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,436
and to your dreams.

905
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:19,814
And it is not because I don't love you,

906
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:23,193
it's because I want you
to remember me like this.

907
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,153
It's not fair.

908
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,823
You know perfectly well you would get
much better treatment at home,

909
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,784
with all of us around you.

910
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,328
How could you do this to us?

911
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:37,123
I do not want you
to change your life for me.

912
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,585
And more importantly,

913
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:44,714
I do not want you to watch me fade away.

914
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:48,843
I will not allow it.

915
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,304
That's why you will be getting
on that plane in the morning.

916
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:53,556
That's why you left Jackie, isn't it?

917
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,225
Yes.

918
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:59,020
Jackie is a vibrant,
beautiful young woman.

919
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,856
Her time is better spent elsewhere.

920
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:08,029
So, you're basically just pushing away
everybody who's ever loved you.

921
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:09,823
It's so selfish!

922
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,324
[crying]

923
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,645
It's not fair.

924
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:47,277
You can't just ask us
to leave, just like that.

925
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,321
"Bye, Dad. See you at your funeral."

926
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,158
[sobbing]

927
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,243
Cancer is treatable.

928
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:00,123
And I waited so long
to have you back in my life,

929
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,168
and now I'm going to lose you again,
but this time forever.

930
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,296
[sobbing]

931
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:10,508
You're not gonna lose me. I promise.

932
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,773
Oh. Hello, Leo.

933
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:28,193
Hi, Mr. Christmas.
I have a question for you.

934
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:29,903
Go ahead.

935
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:33,156
Would you please be my instructor
for my sailing class today?

936
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,200
Of course.

937
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,118
Is it okay if I bring
my daughters along too?

938
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:39,579
- Okay.
- Very well then.

939
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:40,955
See you soon.

940
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,208
Mm-hmm. Bye.

941
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,381
[upbeat music playing]

942
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,610
I heard you are leaving the island soon.

943
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:17,325
[sighs]

944
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,618
You know...

945
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:22,038
they want the children on the island

946
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:25,208
to love and respect the water

947
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,086
as much as they love
and respect each other.

948
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,672
Yeah.

949
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:33,967
Yeah, I can see that.

950
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:38,388
[upbeat music continues]

951
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,891
You have to keep the boat straight.

952
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,936
I know. I'm trying.
Just has a mind of its own.

953
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:48,356
Ooh. Oh! We're getting it,

954
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:49,983
we're getting it! [chuckles]

955
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,992
- Am I doing okay?
- Yes, you're doing great.

956
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,745
- Then why are you staring at me?
- Your eyes are beautiful.

957
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,082
You look like a princess to me.

958
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:09,210
Oh, sweetheart. You're the princess.

959
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:11,129
- [giggles]
- Come on.

960
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,936
Mr. Christmas, can I ask you something?

961
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:29,731
Do you have a girlfriend?

962
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:34,861
Tough question, Leo.
What makes you ask such a thing?

963
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,655
My Mom was wondering.
I heard her asking her friend.

964
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,365
I see.

965
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:40,700
So, do you have one?

966
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:46,122
Uh... I, uh... Well...

967
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:50,543
Mom! Mr. Christmas
doesn't have a girlfriend!

968
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,052
Where's your dad, Leo?

969
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,596
Gone. My parents are divorced.

970
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,599
I think you'd make a great dad.

971
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,268
Well, that's...
That's very kind of you, Leo.

972
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:09,437
Uh, why don't we just
focus on the sailing for now, huh?

973
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,481
- Okay.
- You ready to come about?

974
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:12,815
- Yep!
- [groaning]

975
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,322
It's obvious, right?

976
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:22,408
[sentimental music playing]

977
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,164
Yes.

978
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,251
Yes, it is.

979
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,260
[soft chuckle]

980
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,728
[sad chuckle]

981
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:53,314
[groans] Great sailing, everybody!

982
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:56,025
Well done. Give yourselves a hand.

983
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,777
Now, listen up, you squabs,

984
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,446
I'm buying each and every
one of you some ice cream.

985
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,989
- On me, let's go!
- [kids] Yay!

986
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:04,867
Get that ice cream.

987
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:11,249
[sentimental music playing]

988
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,757
Paulina.

989
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:26,180
How is it possible to feel so sad
and so happy at the same time?

990
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:30,518
I've never felt like this before.

991
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,146
None of us have.

992
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:45,032
[wind blowing]

993
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,621
[Caroline] Well, the weather's turned,
but look at that view.

994
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:52,623
You don't get a view like
that in London, do you?

995
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,083
[Joanna] No, you don't.

996
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,251
[chuckles softly]

997
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:59,422
What about you, Megan?
You ever been to London?

998
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:00,882
A few times.

999
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:05,052
I really love the energy,
but it's a little too busy for me.

1000
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:07,138
Everyone has their favorite place,

1001
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:10,558
but it's often accompanied
by their favorite person.

1002
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:16,314
Hmm. Don't you agree, Dad?

1003
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:19,609
If you're in your perfect place,
it's best to be with somebody you love?

1004
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,194
[Paulina] I know what you mean.

1005
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,864
There's no point being in paradise
if you've no one to share it with.

1006
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,617
Yes. Quite.

1007
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,537
What about you, little sister?
Have you been enjoying the sights?

1008
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:35,750
Very much. Very much indeed.

1009
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:39,420
- [phone ringing]
- Oh.

1010
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:40,630
Excuse me, everyone.

1011
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:45,009
Hang on. Hello? Hello?

1012
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,677
Hang on.

1013
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,430
Hello? Hang on a sec.

1014
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,808
Let me just get better reception.
Hang on.

1015
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:57,772
Hey.

1016
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:01,150
<i>Hi, honey. Hi.</i>

1017
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:05,154
[chuckles] Gosh, it is
really cold here right now.

1018
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:07,657
Oh. Well, this might warm you up.

1019
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:18,042
Oh, that is amazing. Wow.

1020
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,920
<i>So, is your dad coming home?</i>

1021
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:24,048
No, actually.

1022
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,758
No?

1023
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,885
<i>Yeah, he's bought himself this...</i>

1024
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:30,012
beautiful little beach house

1025
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:32,557
and he's gonna stay right here.

1026
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,059
That's a pity.

1027
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:39,021
Anyway, I've got
some great news for you.

1028
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,315
<i>Your old boss Michael,
he called this morning.</i>

1029
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,569
<i>He wants you to be chief editor
of the new magazine he's launching!</i>

1030
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:48,114
[gasps] Oh, my God. Really?

1031
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,365
Really!

1032
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,951
<i>Honey.</i> [laughs]

1033
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:55,705
This is everything you ever wanted.

1034
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,375

Merry Christmas, everybody. God bless you.

Thank you, Jimmy Ray Love,

1062
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:30,234
for that moving rendition
of this sacred song.

1063
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:34,572
There is no more beautiful time
of the year than Christmas.

1064
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:40,870
We are three days away
from the birth of a child

1065
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:44,498
that completed the most
holy of families.

1066
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:49,128
And that is what I want
to talk to you about tonight...

1067
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,629
Family.

1068
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:55,718
We are all the product
of a father and a mother.

1069
01:15:57,428 --> 01:16:01,098
And no matter the circumstances
of our birth,

1070
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:04,477
we all breathe in the miracle of life

1071
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:07,480
and the goodness of God.

1072
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:11,525
You may travel to a faraway place,

1073
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:13,569
you may have dreams

1074
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:16,155
that take you along an unknown path,

1075
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:21,702
you may find love there, or hope...

1076
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:28,959
but you never let go
of the memories of family

1077
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:31,879
that lies locked here in your heart.

1078
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:38,094
You never let go of the love
you have for them.

1079
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,807
And even when we get older,

1080
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:48,020
we cherish and hold on to the memories
that we share with one another.

1081
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:54,693
And those memories, we hope,
will never fade away.

1082
01:16:57,488 --> 01:17:02,284
So, I would like you to join hands
as one family tonight,

1083
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:05,037
under the moon and the stars,

1084
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:08,207

1085
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:12,586

What do you mean?

1093
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:51,834
I guess you could call it
this old country boy's intuition.

1094

- [James] Fancy a walk?
- Sure.

1095
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:03,304
[James] You know, I used to take long
walks with my granddad years ago. Yeah.

I had earlier with Felix?

1099
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:27,119

And don't even try
to make me change my mind.

1108
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:48,140
You've always taught us
to follow our dreams,

1109
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:50,476
and... my dreams changed.

1110
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:54,355
I want you to get to know
your granddaughter.

1111
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:57,441
And I really want her to know you.

1112
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:01,153
And live with you for a while.

1113
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,156
I don't know what to say.

1114
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:09,078
I think it's a wonderful idea.
You should be happy, Dad.

1115
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:13,374
I am happy, especially to meet
my new granddaughter.

1116
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,586
Being with those kids
today just made me realize

1117
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,673
that that's the sort of life
I want for my daughter.

1118
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,512
And we're going to visit too.
Peter's thrilled at the idea.

1119

to stock up on sunscreen,

1121
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:32,518
And what about you?

1122
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,145
Do you have some reason
for returning to the island

1123
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:37,856
other than to see your dear old dad?

1124
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:42,820
Let's just say I have my reasons.

1125
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:43,946
- [James] Ah.
- Hmm.

So this is what the real Paulina
looks like.

1145

Yes. Sorry.

1146
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:08,364
It's not quite as dramatic as Janis,

1147
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,783
or the Beatles, for that matter.

1148
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,493
I wanted to give you something.
